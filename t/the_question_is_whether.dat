25|$|Undue {{influence}} is an equitable doctrine that involves one person {{taking advantage of}} a position of power over another person through a special relationship such as between parent and child or solicitor and client. As an equitable doctrine, the court has discretion. When no special relationship exists, <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> there was a relationship of such trust and confidence that it should give rise to such a presumption.|$|E
25|$|Originalism {{allows the}} dead hand of prior generations to control {{important}} contemporary issues to an extraordinary and unnecessary level of detail. While {{everyone agrees that}} broad constitutional principles should control, if <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> abortion is a fundamental right, why should past centuries-old intentions be controlling? The originalist's distinction between original meaning and original intention here is unclear due {{to the difficulty of}} discussing meaning in terms of specific details that the Constitutional text does not clarify.|$|E

25|$|Other {{mechanisms}} {{have also}} been proposed, in particular, Alfvén waves, wave modes involving the magnetic field first noted by Hannes Alfvén (1942), which have been observed in the laboratory and in space. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> these waves might just be {{a different way of}} looking at the above process, however, because this approach does not point out a different energy source, and many plasma bulk phenomena can also be described in terms of Alfvén waves.|$|E
500|$|At {{a status}} hearing on July 14 (which Hastert again did not attend), the parties updated the court on {{preparations}} for trial. At the hearing, Green again condemned leaks, stating in court: [...] "The indictment has effectively been amended by leaks from the government. It {{is now an}} 800-pound gorilla in this case. It has been injected in this case I think impermissibly. (<b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>is)</b> <b>whether</b> I wrestle with that gorilla or I don't wrestle with that gorilla." [...] Green {{also said that the}} defense would file a motion to dismiss the indictment, possibly under seal. Judge Durkin [...] "cautioned that even if he allows part or all of the motion to be hidden from the public, his ruling would be public and likely would disclose sealed portions of the motion." [...] At the same hearing, the prosecution said that they expected a trial to last about two weeks.|$|E
500|$|Ballo {{committed}} suicide, {{hours after}} hearing {{the results of the}} personality test conducted by Scientology. She jumped from the fourth floor of her dorm room in Nice, France, two hours after getting the results of the test. She left behind a note, along with the results of the Scientology personality test. The results of the personality test were found among her belongings by her family. In April 2008, Aftenposten noted that the French police were investigating connections between Scientology and Ballo's death. The investigation was being headed by a judge in France. In April 2008 the French police interviewed two leaders of Scientology in France. Prosecutor Eric de Montgolfier opened an investigation into the incident in France, in April 2008. A French investigating prosecutor told Dagbladet, [...] "We are almost convinced that it is a suicide. But <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> something encouraged her to this." [...] Prosecutors stated in December 2008 that they could not determine a direct link between the Scientology personality test and Ballo's death.|$|E

500|$|The first {{principle}} {{when deciding}} {{if there is}} certainty of intention {{is the nature of}} the language used; the words, as said in Wright v Atkyns, [...] "must be imperative". Past this, there is no requirement that particular language be used. In Re Kayford, Megarry J held that [...] "it is well settled that a trust can be created without using the word [...] "trust" [...] or [...] "confidence" [...] or the like; <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> in substance a sufficient intention to create a trust has been manifested". In Paul v Constance, [...] it was held that the phrase [...] "the money is as much yours as it is mine" [...] was sufficient to translate to a trust. A trust will not be formed if it is clear that some other intention was there, such as the intention to make a pure gift, as in Jones v Lock. Historically, precatory words such as [...] "it is hoped" [...] and [...] "it is desired" [...] were held to be valid. Since Lambe v Eames, the courts have instead taken the approach that the circumstances and the reading of the statement as a whole are the factors, and that no particular words will impose a trust on their own.|$|E
500|$|Realizing that Congress {{might not}} pass {{legislation}} for a coin to commemorate a film industry celebration, the organizers sought a historical event {{with a major}} anniversary to occur in 1923, which could be honored both at the fair and on the coin. [...] The obvious candidate was the Boston Tea Party of 1773, but according to numismatists Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen in their volume on U.S. commemorative coins, that episode [...] "could not be tortured into even the vaguest relevance to California, let alone to Los Angeles". On December18, 1922, California Congressman Walter Franklin Lineberger introduced a bill to strike a half dollar in commemoration of the centennial of the Monroe Doctrine, with the Los Angeles Clearing House (an association of banks) given the exclusive right to purchase the pieces from the government at face value. [...] Lineberger claimed that Monroe's declaration had kept California, then owned by Mexico, {{out of the hands}} of European powers. [...] The bill was questioned in the House of Representatives by Michigan Congressman Louis Cramton, and in the Senate by Vermont's Frank Greene, who stated, [...] "it seems to me that the question is not one of selling a coin at a particular value or a particular place. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> the United States government is going to go on from year to year submitting its coinage to this—well—harlotry." [...] Despite these objections, the bill was enacted on January24, 1923; a mintage of 300,000pieces was authorized.|$|E
500|$|Slant Magazine writer Sal Cinquemani {{compared}} the album unfavorably to In the Zone, saying that although Blackout [...] "scores well, and its hotness quotient is remarkably high, [...] isn't {{much of a}} step forward for Britney following 2003's surprisingly strong In the Zone, for which she received a writing credit on {{a majority of the}} songs (as opposed to a scant three here)." [...] Andy Battaglia of The A.V. Club said Blackout [...] "counts both as a significant event and as a disquieting aberration that couldn't be more mysteriously manufactured or bizarrely ill-timed" [...] in which [...] "every song counts as markedly progressive and strange." [...] Alexis Petridis from The Guardian called it [...] "a bold, exciting album: <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> anyone will be able to hear its contents over the deafening roar of tittle-tattle." [...] He elaborated that when faced with a public image in freefall, an artist has two options: making music [...] "that harks back to your golden, pre-tailspin days" [...] to [...] "underlin your complete normality" [...] or [...] "to throw caution to the wind: given your waning fortunes, what's the harm in taking a few musical risks?" [...] Petridis commented that Spears opted for the latter and the results were [...] "largely fantastic." [...] Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times said, [...] "The electronic beats and bass lines are as thick as Ms. Spears's voice is thin, and as the album title suggests, the general mood is bracingly unapologetic." [...] Sanneh added that said Spears became a spectral presence in her own album, explaining that when compared to her previous records, [...] " [...] cuts a startlingly low profile on Blackout [...] Even when she was being marketed as a clean-cut ex-Mouseketeer, and even when she was touring the country with a microphone that functioned largely as a prop, something about her was intense." [...] Peter Robinson of The Observer stated that Spears [...] "delivered the best album of her career, raising the bar for modern pop music with an incendiary mix of Timbaland's Shock Value and her own back catalogue." [...] The Phoenixs Ellee Dean said the album [...] "may be more a tribute to the skills of the A-list producers who guided her through the disc than to any of her own talents. But at least she was smart enough to accept that guidance." [...] In his consumer guide for MSN Music, critic Robert Christgau gave the album a B+ and said that [...] "From 'Gimme More's 'It's Britney bitch' hiya to 'Piece of Me's single-of-the-year sonics, from 'Ooh Ooh Baby's 'feel you deep inside' to 'Perfect Lover's 'touch me there', this album is pure, juicy, plastic get-naked." [...] Blackout was ranked by Rolling Stone at number fifty on their list of the 100 Best Albums of 2007. The album topped Billboards Reader's Choice poll as the best album of the year.|$|E

Some might not be advantaged—they might even be disadvantaged—but the bulk must not be.|$|E
2500|$|The {{report was}} the first one by the United Nations to {{determine}} that crimes against humanity were perpetrated in the DPRK. Talking about these crimes, the Chair of the COI stated: [...] "Unlike earlier totalitarian states and oppressive conduct, the world cannot now lament, 'if only we had known...' Now, the world does know. And <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> the world will respond effectively and take the necessary action." ...|$|E
50|$|Keene LJ {{said that}} even when there <b>were</b> express words, <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> context and {{character}} of the agreement made them apt for incorporation into individual contracts.

2500|$|Justin Brookman, of the Center for Democracy and Technology, {{expressed}} concern regarding {{the impact of}} IoT on consumer privacy, saying that [...] "There are {{some people in the}} commercial space who say, 'Oh, big data — well, let's collect everything, keep it around forever, we'll pay for somebody to think about security later.' <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> we want {{to have some sort of}} policy framework in place to limit that." ...|$|E

2500|$|After being {{appointed}} {{commanding general}} of U.S. forces by President John Adams in 1798, Washington turned down Burr's {{application for a}} brigadier general's commission during the Quasi-War with France. Washington wrote, [...] "By all that I have known and heard, Colonel Burr is a brave and able officer, but <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> he has not equal talents at intrigue."

50|$|As a consequence, they argued, the 1788 Pennsylvania law, {{in all its}} {{provisions}} applicable to this case, should <b>be</b> voided. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> Pennsylvania law violated the constitutional guarantee of fugitive slave return and the 1793 Act of Congress, passed to implement it.|$|R
50|$|The Commission sent {{a letter}} to IBM that it was {{bringing}} proceedings for abusing a dominant position, under EU competition law, inviting it to put a case.

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> Web-log {{commentary}} helps or damages an academic's career. It is {{a shameful}} question. Intellectuals {{should not be}} worrying about [...] "careers", the tenured among us least of all. Despite the First Amendment, which only really protects one from the government, most Americans who speak out can face sanctions from other institutions in society. Journalists are fired all the time for taking the wrong political stance. That is why most bloggers employed {{in the private sector}} are anonymous or started out trying to be so.|$|E
2500|$|As of December 2010, the PCA border has {{not been}} demarcated {{and there is still}} no {{agreement}} on who constitutes a [...] "resident of Abyei" [...] for the purposes of voting in the Abyei referendum. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> to include Arab nomads (the Messiria tribe), who have historically stayed in the region every year for six months. If the Misseriya Arabs are prevented from voting, the region will likely go to South Sudan. While the Dinka Ngok and Messiria tribe maintained a peaceful coexistence during the civil war, the division of Sudan has created mistrust between the two people.|$|E
2500|$|Brown {{did in fact}} punch a producer, {{knocking}} him down, {{but no one can}} say which producer it was. Some writers say it was David O. Selznick, who fired him in anger over script changes for A Star is Born (an adaptation of What Price Hollywood). In Sixty Years of Hollywood, John Baxter (author) [...] asserts the victim was the producer of The Devil is a Sissy and resulted in Brown's being replaced as director of the film. There is no question about Brown's having punched a producer; <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> the punch was career-ending.|$|E
