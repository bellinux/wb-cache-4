5|$|In 1962, Kestin and Persen {{published}} a paper describing solutions for heat transfer when the thermal boundary layer is contained entirely within the momentum layer and for various wall temperature distributions. For {{the problem of}} a flat plate with a temperature jump at , they propose a substitution that reduces the parabolic thermal boundary-layer equation to an ordinary differential equation. <b>The</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> equation, the temperature {{at any point in}} the fluid, can be expressed as an incomplete gamma function. Schlichting proposed an equivalent substitution that reduces the thermal boundary-layer equation to an ordinary differential equation whose solution is the same incomplete gamma function.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> dilemma {{was simple}} but {{nonetheless}} ingenious. Late in 1971, an Egyptian officer suggested {{the use of}} small, light, gasoline fueled pumps that could be ferried across the canal in inflatable rafts to blast through the sand barrier by hydraulic mining. The suggestion proved worthwhile, and the Egyptian Military ordered some 300 British-made pumps. Tests showed that five of these pumps could remove 1,500 cubic metres of sand in three hours. In 1972 another 150 more powerful German-made pumps were purchased. A combination of three British-made and two German-made pumps {{made it possible to}} clear a passage in two hours.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> {{problem is}} to wind the sense coil in two pairs, each {{displaced}} from {{either side of the}} centerline by 22.5 degrees. This makes the error in one coil the opposite of the other, a condition that remains true around the entire circle. The correction is never perfect, the precise angles had to be experimented with on every radiogoniometer.|$|E

25|$|Black feminist {{criminology}} is <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> problem. It takes {{four factors}} into account: One, it observes the social structural oppression of Black women. Two, it recognizes the Black community and its culture.

These four factors will help distinguish Black women from Black males into an accurate branch of learning {{in the criminal justice}} system.|$|E
25|$|In 1803 Gian Francesco Malfatti {{posed the}} problem of cutting three {{cylindrical}} columns out of a triangular prism of marble, maximizing the total volume of the columns. He assumed, as did many others after him, that <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> problem was given by three tangent circles within the triangular cross-section of the wedge. That is, more abstractly, he conjectured that the three Malfatti circles have the maximum total area of any three disjoint circles within a given triangle.|$|E
25|$|Jessop's {{original}} {{designs for}} the harbour included a dam with an 'overfall', {{with the level of}} the water determined by the height of the dam's crest. As a result of the accumulation of mud and silt in the harbour, ships entering the narrow harbour were frequently being grounded. In 1832 Brunel was called upon to provide <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> problem and designed the sluice system, still in use today, to remove excesses of foul-smelling silt and mud.|$|E

25|$|Before ratifying the Constitution in 1787, the {{thirteen}} states were {{bound by the}} Articles of Confederation, which authorized the Continental Congress to conduct foreign diplomacy and granted sovereignty to the states. By 1787, both Congress and the states had accumulated considerable debt from the Revolutionary War, but the Articles of Confederation denied Congress the powers of taxation and regulation of foreign and interstate commerce. Alexander Hamilton, {{along with many other}} Framers, believed <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> and problems of federal law enforcement could be solved with a strong centralized government.|$|E
25|$|Temperature {{measurement}} {{was initially}} done by Basset using an optical pyrometer {{to measure the}} intensity of the incandescent light from the sample. Colleagues at UC Berkeley were better able to utilize the black body radiation and more accurately measure the temperature. The hot spot produced by the laser also created large thermal gradients in between the portions of sample that were hit by the focused laser and those that were not. <b>The</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> problem is ongoing but advances have been made with the introduction of a double-sided approach.|$|E
25|$|But just as French vignerons were {{recovering}} from oidium came a new mysterious ailment that caused decay or {{death in the}} grapevines. The cause was a tiny louse, known as phylloxera, imported from North America. This louse targets the rootstock of the vine. <b>The</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> epidemic also came from North America in the grafting of naturally resistant American rootstocks to the European vines. However, while the importing of this new North American plant material helped {{to stave off the}} phylloxera epidemic, it brought with it yet more problems-the fungal disease of downy mildew that first surfaced in 1878 and black rot that followed in the 1880s.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> {{problem is}} {{the removal of the}} turbine. The ramjet engine {{consists}} mostly of a large tube, and is relatively easy to air-cool by forcing extra air around the engine. Experimental ramjet aircraft of the era, like the Lockheed X-7, were reaching speeds as high as Mach4. There are numerous problems with the ramjet engine, however. Fuel economy, or thrust specific fuel consumption in aircraft terms, is extremely poor. This makes general operations like flying from one airbase to another expensive propositions. More problematic is the fact that ramjets rely on forward speed to compress the incoming air, and become efficient above Mach1.|$|E
25|$|Their {{goal was}} to find {{experimental}} designs for investigating the dependence of some measured quantity {{on a number of}} independent variables (factors), each taking L levels, {{in such a way as}} to minimize the variance of the estimates of these dependencies using a limited number of experiments. Interactions between the factors were considered negligible. <b>The</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> problem is to find an experimental design where each combination of levels for any pair of factors appears the same number of times, throughout all the experimental runs (refer to table). A complete factorial design would satisfy this criterion, but the idea was to find smaller designs.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> problem {{throughout}} most of American history was to keep its standing army small, relying on augmentation from militias (the predecessor of modern-day Reserve forces, to include the National Guard) and volunteers. While armed forces were built up during wartime, the pattern after every war {{up to and including}} World War II was to demobilize quickly and return to something approaching pre-war force levels. However, {{with the advent of the}} Cold War in the 1950s, the need to create and maintain a sizable peacetime military force engendered new concerns of militarism and about how such a large force would affect civil-military relations in the United States. For the first time in American history, the problem of civil-military relations would have to be managed during peacetime.|$|E

25|$|Deaf clubs, {{popular in}} the 1940s and 1950s, were also an {{important}} part of deaf culture. During this time there were very few places that the deaf could call their own– places run by deaf people for deaf people. Deaf clubs were <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> need. Money was made by selling alcohol and hosting card games. Sometimes these ventures were so successful that the building used by the club was able to be purchased. However, the main attraction of these clubs was that they provided a place that deaf people could go to be around other deaf people, sometimes sharing stories, hosting parties, comedians, and plays. Many of today’s common ABC stories were first seen at deaf clubs. The clubs were found in all of the major cities, New York City being home to at least 12. These clubs were an important break from their usually solitary day spent at factory jobs.|$|E
25|$|A similar {{situation}} occurs in general relativity with the gravitational singularity {{associated with the}} Schwarzschild solution that describes the geometry of a black hole. The curvature of spacetime at the singularity is infinite which {{is another way of}} stating that the theory does not describe the physical conditions at this point. It is hoped that <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> paradox will be found with a consistent theory of quantum gravity, something which has thus far remained elusive. A consequence of this paradox is that the associated singularity that occurred at the supposed starting point of the universe (see Big Bang) is not adequately described by physics. Before a theoretical extrapolation of a singularity can occur, quantum mechanical effects become important in an era known as the Planck time. Without a consistent theory, there can be no meaningful statement about the physical conditions associated with the universe before this point.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to a lack}} of flexibilities in European {{copyright}} and database law, {{the mining}} of in-copyright works such as web mining without the permission of the copyright owner is not legal. Where a database is pure data in Europe there is likely to be no copyright, but database rights may exist so data mining becomes subject to regulations by the Database Directive. On the recommendation of the Hargreaves review this led to the UK government to amend its copyright law in 2014 to allow content mining as a limitation and exception. Only the second country in the world to do so after Japan, which introduced an exception in 2009 for data mining. However, due to the restriction of the Copyright Directive, the UK exception only allows content mining for non-commercial purposes. UK copyright law also does not allow this provision to be overridden by contractual terms and conditions. The European Commission facilitated stakeholder discussion on text and data mining in 2013, under the title of Licences for Europe. The focus on <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> legal issue being licences and not limitations and exceptions led to representatives of universities, researchers, libraries, civil society groups and open access publishers to leave the stakeholder dialogue in May 2013.|$|E
