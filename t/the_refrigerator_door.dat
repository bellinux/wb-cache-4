25|$|Sister Abhaya was {{reported}} missing {{on the morning of}} 27 March 1992. She had woken at 4:00am to study for exams, and was last known to have gone to the kitchen for a drink. <b>The</b> <b>refrigerator</b> <b>door</b> was left ajar, a bottle of water was spilled on the floor and a single slipper sat under the fridge – its pair was found beside the convent hostel’s well. After a brief search, Sister Abhaya’s body was found in the convent hostel’s well {{in the early hours of}} the same day. Kottayam West Police Station upgraded their investigation to that of an unnatural death.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the mode of}} moisture transport and their effect on energy consumption during open and closed door condition. Moisture can be transported into <b>the</b> <b>refrigerator</b> during closed and opening door conditions.

The rate of moisture transport during open and closed door condition and energy consumption are calculated. The result of this study shows that <b>the</b> <b>refrigerator</b> with <b>door</b> openings consumes 8 more energy than <b>the</b> same <b>refrigerator</b> without <b>door</b> openings. <b>The</b> extra power consumption due to moisture transport during the period of 10 year by <b>the</b> <b>refrigerators</b> in Malaysia is calculated and found that 4 of the total energy is consumed...|$|R

It was adapted for theater and staged in London, England in 2014 and in Paris, France in 2016.

5000|$|The song {{originally}} debuted {{during the}} comedy sketch [...] "Live Organ Transplants". The paramedic (John Cleese), upon failing to persuade Mrs. Brown (Terry Jones) to donate her liver, opens <b>the</b> <b>refrigerator</b> <b>doors</b> {{to reveal a}} man wearing a pink morning suit (Eric Idle). The man accompanies Mrs. Brown through outer space singing various statistics about the galaxy. The upshot of the song (which follows a synthesized instrumental montage that, in the movie, is accompanied by a computer-animated picture of a woman being impregnated) is that {{in the grand scheme of}} the universe, the likelihood of Mrs. Brown's existence was almost zero, but that she should [...] "pray that there's intelligent life somewhere up in space, 'cause there's bugger all down here on Earth". The singer returns to <b>the</b> <b>refrigerator,</b> at which point Mrs. Brown admits that the singer convinced her to hand over her liver.|$|R
50|$|Tony {{talks to}} Dr. Melfi about his crew and their {{perception}} of him. Melfi comments that Tony tries to project himself as an alpha male. She suggests he should act {{as if he is}} fine, and do something to let the subordinates know he remains a decisive leader. At Satriale's, Tony tries to bait Perry into a confrontation under the pretext that he slammed <b>the</b> <b>refrigerator</b> <b>doors</b> but he does not respond. With his crew looking on, Tony punches his bodyguard, starting a one-sided fight that ends with Perry bleeding on the floor and Tony defiantly walking away, seemingly unscathed. Afterwards, Tony retreats to the bathroom and vomits blood. Leaning on the bathroom sink and looking at himself in the mirror, Tony gives himself a twisted, satisfied smile. The moment is short-lived, however, as Tony violently vomits again in the toilet.|$|R
50|$|Such {{deaths were}} not {{uncommon}} for children in the United States before the passage of <b>the</b> <b>Refrigerator</b> Safety Act in 1956. Children would occasionally play in abandoned refrigerators and become trapped. The first reactions to the deaths were to ask people not to abandon refrigerators and to detach <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> of unused <b>refrigerators.</b> At least one state, Oklahoma, enacted legislation making the abandonment of a refrigerator with a latch in a location where a child might find it a felony. In the mid- to late 1950s troops of people would sometimes search out abandoned <b>refrigerators,</b> detaching <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> and smashing the locks. However, these efforts were not entirely effective, and children were still dying inside of refrigerators {{that had not been}} found and dismantled. The continued occurrence of refrigerator deaths led to a law that required a change in <b>the</b> way <b>refrigerator</b> <b>doors</b> stay shut. <b>The</b> act applied to all <b>refrigerators</b> manufactured in <b>the</b> United States after October 31, 1958, and is largely responsible for the adoption of the magnetic mechanism that is used today instead of a latch.|$|R

5|$|If handled {{correctly}} {{early in}} life, guinea pigs become amenable to {{being picked up}} and carried, and seldom bite or scratch. They are timid explorers and often hesitate to attempt an escape from their cage even when an opportunity presents itself. Still, they show considerable curiosity when allowed to walk freely, especially in familiar and safe terrain. Guinea pigs that become familiar with their owner will whistle on the owner's approach; they will also learn to whistle {{in response to the}} rustling of plastic bags or <b>the</b> opening of <b>refrigerator</b> <b>doors,</b> where their food is most commonly stored. In Switzerland, owning a single guinea pig is considered harmful to its well-being and forbidden by law.|$|R

40|$|As the DOE {{standards}} for energy usage become increasingly more strict, and refrigerator manufacturers seek to further improve <b>refrigerator</b> efficiency, <b>door</b> openings {{will become a}} significant portion of the equation which to date has largely gone untapped. This study investigates the heat transfer coefficients present on the interior surfaces of <b>the</b> <b>refrigerator</b> during open <b>door</b> conditions. Flow visualization and air exchange studies were also performed, providing a complete picture of the convective heat gains occurring during door openings. Surface heat transfer coefficients were found to range from 0. 551 W/m 2 (0. 175 BTU/ft 2 -hr) on the floor of <b>the</b> <b>refrigerator</b> with three shelves in place, to 5. 208 W/m 2 (1. 651 BTU/fF-hr) on the upper-most front plates in the cabinet. The coefficients are directly affected by the airflow patterns in <b>the</b> <b>refrigerator,</b> which are a function of the number of shelves present. Simple temperature measurements were taken to evaluate how the air temperature within the cabinet responds before, during, and after the door is opened. The air temperature decay after the door is closed was found to be in nearly perfect agreement with an exponential decay curve having a time constant of approximately 50 seconds. Further investigations involving different shelf configurations and new shelf designs (including some present shelf designs) were studied and recommendations provided on reducing the overall heat gain during door openings.

40|$|Maintaining {{the vaccine}} cold chain is an {{essential}} part of a successful immunization programme, but in developed countries faulty procedures may occur more commonly than is generally believed. A survey was conducted in a health district in central Italy to assess the methods of vaccine transportation and storage. Of 52 primary vaccination offices inspected, 39 (76. 5 %) had a refrigerator for vaccine storage but only 17 (33. 3 %) kept records of received and stored doses. None of the seven main offices selected for monitoring had a maximum and minimum thermometer and none monitored the internal temperature of <b>the</b> <b>refrigerator.</b> Moreover, other faulty procedures, such as the storage of food and laboratory specimens in vaccine <b>refrigerators</b> and <b>the</b> storage of vaccines on <b>refrigerator</b> <b>door</b> shelves, indicated that the knowledge and practice of vaccine storage and handling were often inadequate.
