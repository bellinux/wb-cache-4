5|$|On 17 September 1595 Clement VIII had {{accepted}} the decision of Henry IV of France to convert to the Catholic Church, which Henry had previously made to secure the French monarchy, and presided over a ceremony of papal absolution. This removed the excommunication order placed on him by Sixtus V. The Spanish faction had previously opposed the pope <b>taking</b> <b>these</b> actions, but the French negotiators had talked {{of the possibility of}} schism, which along with Henry's victories in the French Wars of Religion, overcame their opposition.|$|E

The police remained outside {{for more than half}} an hour, <b>taking</b> <b>these</b> preliminary measures, while the assailants were raping and murdering the women inside the house. The police dawdled at the scene, and made no effort to make the assailants aware of their presence.|$|E

5|$|The age of {{the bones}} at death matched that of Richard when he was killed; they were dated to about the period of his death and were mostly {{consistent}} with physical descriptions of the king. Preliminary DNA analysis showed that mitochondrial DNA extracted from the bones matched that of two matrilineal descendants, one 17th-generation and the other 19th-generation, of Richard's sister Anne of York. <b>Taking</b> <b>these</b> findings into account along with other historical, scientific and archaeological evidence, the University of Leicester announced on 4 February 2013 that it had concluded beyond reasonable doubt that the skeleton was that of Richard III.|$|E
5|$|Touching {{the names}} of the dead on {{memorials}} was common gesture of grieving in the inter-war period; sometimes mourners would also kiss the names. Visitors to the memorials on the Western front would often photograph or trace on paper the relevant names on the memorials, <b>taking</b> <b>these</b> reminders back with them to their homes. By contrast, the naming of the dead played a less significant role in Italy, where formal lists of the war dead were not established until the mid-1920s; local communities compiled their own lists, used to produce local memorial plaques, but the national lists remained inaccurate for many years.|$|E
5|$|Heartland Food Corporation (Heartland) {{came into}} {{existence}} when Miami-based franchisee Al Cabrera purchased {{a large chunk of}} stores, 130 locations primarily in the Chicago and the upper mid-west, from the failed franchise AmeriKing for a bargain basement price of $16million, or approximately 88% of their original value in December 2003. <b>Taking</b> <b>these</b> stores, he and his partners created a new company called Core Value Partners to renovate and update the locations which had deteriorated during Ameriking's decline. During this time, the company was renamed Heartland Food Corp. and it purchased 120 additional stores from other financially distressed owners and completely revamped them as well. The resulting purchases made Mr. Cabrerra Burger King's largest minority franchisee and Heartland one of BKC's top franchisee groups at the time. By 2006, the company was valued at over $150million, and was sold to New York-based GSO Capital Partners.|$|E

5|$|The Allied plan {{consisted}} of a three-division landing of US forces led by Major General Lucian Truscott to secure a bridgehead on the first day. Their flanks were to be protected by French, American, and Canadian commando units. Within twenty-four hours, 50,000–60,000 troops and 6,500 vehicles were to be disembarked. The airborne landings would concentrate in an area near Draguignan and Le Muy, {{with the aim of}} <b>taking</b> <b>these</b> towns to prevent German counterattacks against the beaches. The bulk of the American force then had to advance quickly to the north along the Rhône River, to take the towns of Lyon and Dijon and make contact with the Allied forces in Northern France. After the successful initial landing, units of the French ArmyB were to land, tasked with the taking of the French ports of Toulon and Marseille.|$|E

Other medications, including medications for urinary incontinence and the antihistamine medication diphenhydramine (Benadryl), also may worsen confusion.|$|E

25|$|A {{secondary}} objective of Operation Kilshon was to simultaneously create a continuous frontline {{between the various}} isolated Jewish localities. For this aim, Brigadier General David Shaltiel, Haganah's former envoy to Europe, was deployed along with a troop of 400 Haganah soldiers and 600 militia soldiers. Emil Ghuri, the new leader of the Army of the Holy War, also envisaged <b>taking</b> <b>these</b> districts and mobilized 600 soldiers for the mission, but prepared no specific operation.|$|E
25|$|Collectively <b>taking</b> <b>these</b> {{characteristics}} of the neighboring Linear Pottery culture into consideration, scholars have theorized that additional Cucuteni-Tryilian sites may be found, including locations that may be detached from the main settlements, where there may be evidence {{of the practice of}} cremation. Archaeologists have discussed broadening the search areas around known Cucuteni-Trypillia settlements to cover a much wider area, and to employ modern techniques to help try to find evidence of outlying sites where evidence of funerary activities could be found.|$|E
