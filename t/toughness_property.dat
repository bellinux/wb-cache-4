40|$|Polymer {{composites}} are {{engineered materials}} widely being used {{and yet not}} completely understood for their dynamic response. It is important to fully characterize material properties before using them for applications in critical industries, like that of defense or transport. In this project, {{the focus is on}} determining dynamic fracture <b>toughness</b> <b>property</b> of fiber reinforced polymer composites by using a combined numerical- experimental methodology. Impact tests are conducted on Split-Hopkinson pressure bar with required instrumentation to obtain load-history and initiation of crack propagation parameters followed by finite element analysis to determine desired dynamic properties. Single edge notch bend(SENB) type geometry is used for Mode-I fracture testing and similarly end-notched flexure (ENF) type of geometry is proposed to test the samples for Mode-II type of fracture. Two different linear elastic fracture mechanics approaches are used- crack opening displacement and strain energy release rates. Dynamic fracture toughness values of around 50 MPa[square root of m] and 100 MPa[square root of m] in Mode-I, whereas, around 40 MPa[square root of m] and 6 MPa[square root of m] in Mode-II are observed for carbon-epoxy and fiberglass-epoxy composites respectively. To provide a better estimate of material response, Hashin damage model is employed which takes into account non-linear behavior of composites. As observed in previous studies, values estimated using a non-linear response of composite laminates are nearly three times as high, therefore, using a linear elastic material model could underestimate a material's capacity to sustain dynamic loads without failure. It is concluded that fracture initiation <b>toughness</b> <b>property</b> is rate dependent and is higher when subjected to dynamic loads. Microscopic examination of damaged samples and a higher value of dynamic fracture toughness for fiberglass-epoxy laminates as compared to carbon-epoxy laminates suggest that dynamic fracture toughness is also a function of many other variables like mode of fracture, dominant damage criteria, manufacturing process, constituent materials and their ratios...|$|E

In comparison with pure Fe 2 B phase, the intrinsic brittleness of Fe 2 B phase with chromium is lower. In addition, the valence electron structure of Fe 2 B containing various chromium content is calculated by the method of bond length difference (BLD).

The {{results showed that the}} upset welded steels had good fracture <b>toughness</b> <b>properties,</b> but values were lower than the as-received material. The fracture toughness value of the base material was 6420 in-lbs/sq. in., while the welded steels averaged 3660 in-lbs/sq. in. Hydrogen exposure lowered the fracture toughness values of the as-received steel by 43 % to 3670 in-lbs/sq. in. and the welded steels by 21 % to 2890 in-lbs/sq. in. The fracture morphologies of the unexposed steels showed that ductile fracture occurred by the microvoid nucleation and growth process. The size of the microvoids on the fracture surfaces of the welded steels were much smaller and more closely spaced that those found on the base material fracture surfaces. The change in the size and spacing of the microvoids indicates that the fracture <b>toughness</b> <b>properties</b> of the welded steels were lower than the base steels because of the higher concentration of microscopic precipitates on the weld plane.

However, {{to the best of}} the authors’ knowledge, nanoscale fracture of shale materials has rarely been examined. Fracture <b>toughness</b> <b>property</b> of shale has been typically studied by observing crack growth of notched macroscale specimens subjected to flexural or tension loads. This research discusses the possible characterization of fracture toughness of shale using contact mechanics at the nanoscale. The analysis method is based on two traditional fracture toughness measurement methods which are used for some different materials. One is the radial crack length measurement method and the other one is based on evaluating the energy absorbed by radial cracks propagating from the indentation imprint in brittle materials. Nanoindentation experiments performed using Berkovich and Cube corner nanoindenter are reported. The Young’s Modulus, Hardness and fracture toughness of shale are extracted from nanoindentation experiments. Fracture toughness for different types of shale are evaluated using both crack length measurement and an equivalent elastic crack energy approach and are compared to macroscale fracturetoughness of different types of shale from the literature. Mechanical properties for different types of shale are calculated from nanoindentation tests and mineralogy is found {{to play an important role}} in controlling mechanical properties of shales. An increase in organic content and clay minerals content decreases both Young’s Modulus and Hardness of shale. But the deviation of fracture toughness calculation results in this project cannot be ignored comparing with results from macroscale tests. There is some influence for fracture toughness measurement by size effect and shale heterogeneity. Shale heterogeneity and compositional variability should be considered as serious challenges in quantifying the mechanical properties of shale in the future work...|$|E

Near surface modifications in the hardness was investigated by employing the Vickers indentation method. Crack lengths and geometry were then measured by using the optical. A co-ordinate measuring machine was used to investigate the diamond indentations and to measure the lengths of the cracks. Thereafter, computational and analytical methods were employed to determine the K 1 C. An increase in the K 1 C of both ceramics was found by the CO 2 and the fibre laser surface treatment {{in comparison to the}} as-received surfaces. The K 1 C of the CO 2 laser radiated surface of the Si 3 N 4 was over 3 % higher in comparison to that of the fibre laser treated surface. This was by softening of the near surface layer of the Si 3 N 4 which comprised of lower in hardness, which in turn increased the crack resistance. The effects were not similar with the ZrO 2 ceramic to that of the Si 3 N 4 as the fibre laser radiation in this case had produced a rise of 34 % compared to that of the CO 2 laser radiation. This occurred due to propagation of lower crack resulting from the Vickers indentation test during the fibre laser surface treatment which inherently affected the end K 1 C though an induced compressive stress layer. The K 1 C modification of the two ceramics treated by the CO 2 and the fibre laser was also believed to be influenced by the different laser wavelength and its absorption co-efficient, the beam delivery system as well as the differences in the brightness of the two lasers used...|$|E

The effect of electron beam irradiation on mechanical properties of PA 6 /HDPE/EVA/HDPE-g- MAH/MMT nanocomposite were investigate at the dosage range of 0 - 200 kGy and 3. 0 MeV. The mechanical properties of the samples such as tensile test, flexural test and elongation at break were measured by universal tensile machine. Hardness and impact test were measured using Zwich Roell hardness tester and Izod Impact Tester. The nanocomposites were characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometer, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Thermogravimetric Analyzer (TGA). X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) were used for morphology characterization. The result revealed that incorporation of 2 wt% of HDPE-g-MAH and 5 wt% of organoclay increase the strength and stiffness of the sample but reduced the <b>toughness</b> <b>property.</b> The results exhibited enhancement of mechanical properties with incorporation of 1 phr EVA but slightly decreased for further addition of EVA content.

From XRD measurement, not all characteristic basal appear in the range of 20 = 2 - 10 ° which indicated that organoclay are exfoliated and intercalated during melt processing.

40|$|Hybrid fabrics {{represent}} a rapidly emerging branch of reinforcements in composite materials. A justified {{use of these}} textiles requires {{a good understanding of}} their role on the failure behaviour and the mechanical performance of Intraply Woven Hybrid Composite (IWHC). This thesis presents a methodology, which helped to describe and explain the failure behaviour of IWHC using combined experimental and analytical results. In addition it has been demonstrated that Finite Element (FE) models can be used successfully to evaluate the extent of damage under impact loading. The efficiency of the models has been tested against the experimental results and other established micro-mechanical models. Tensile tests supported by non-destructive techniques such as acoustic emission, X-ray and strain field measurements have been conducted to characterise the mechanical behaviour, damage modes and the mechanisms of failure. The experimental tensile results have identified the non-linear plastic damage behaviour, while the FE results have indicated the linear elastic damage behaviour. The overall picture of the failure mechanism has been established by combining the results gathered from the FE and the experimental analyses. The results of the longitudinal tensile tests show an increase in stiffness and strength properties with the increase in the carbon content in the carbon-aramid hybrid composite. Fibre dominated elastic properties have been predicted with an acceptable accuracyb ut predictionf or matrix-dominatedb ehaviourh ash ad significante rrors. This study has identified three major damage events during the tensile loading process at different strain levels. These include a) onset of damage initiated by debonding of aramid fibres, b) formation of clusters of damaged carbon fibres c) necking of aramid fibres at the high stress concentration areas (crimp regions). Eventually, when the content of unbroken fibres is insufficient to withhold the load, abrupt failure occurs locally. Furthermore the residual compressive strengths of the hybrids have been assessed after subjecting them to low velocity impact loading. All the experimental data have been used to support and test the FE models of impact loading. X-ray and scanning electron microscopy techniques have been used to identify the extent and mechanism of damage operating during the impact loading. It has been shown that the lower stiffness property in the hybrid composite has prevailed over the high <b>toughness</b> <b>property.</b> Interesting trends have been established for the flexure energy absorption, impact energy absorption and damage tolerance in compression after impact testing for hybrid composites with different carbon contents.

40|$|The {{effect of}} Nb microalloying on {{structure}} and physical properties of {{quenched and tempered}} 13 %Cr martensitic stainless steel was investigated. Excellent strength and adequate <b>toughness</b> <b>properties</b> were obtained by 0. 10 wt% Nb addition to low interstitial (N 0. 01 wt%, C < 0. 02 wt%) steel. The effect of Nb in 13 %Cr steels with high N content was also studied in a commercial martensitic stainless steel sample containing higher levels of N and also alloyed with V. The microstructure, precipitate morphology and dispersion and volume fraction of reverse austenite were characterized. The strength properties obtained in the steel with 0. 10 %Nb are significantly {{higher than those of}} the V-containing steel. The study shows that whereas amount, size and dispersion of precipitates of microalloying elements contribute to enhanced strength, the optimum volume fraction of reverse austenite formed contributes to enhanced ductility and <b>toughness</b> <b>properties.</b> More importantly, high Nb additions to low N - 13 %Cr- 1 %Mo steel are found to improve significantly resistance against pitting corrosion significantly...|$|R
40|$|One {{part of the}} {{experimental}} work done {{in the course of}} the qualification of a "Fitness for Service" assessment of electron beam welded ARIANE 5 booster cases was the investigation of the strength, deformation and <b>toughness</b> <b>properties</b> of individual material zones present in the weld with the aim to select most critical zones. For this, tensile tests on subsized specimens and fracture mechanics tests on real weld and weld thermal simulated microstructures were conducted...|$|R
40|$|High {{strength}} steels {{have been}} available for years, but their use required more welding control and fabrication processes than conventional strength steels. A new grade of high performance steel, HPS- 485 W or HPS- 70 W, developed by a cooperative program between the Federal Highway Administration, the American Iron and Steel Institute, and the Department of the Navy in August 1994; uses a new chemical composition that provides improved welding and <b>toughness</b> <b>properties...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{heuristic}} mathematical {{basis is}} {{proposed for the}} experimental correlations found between ultrasonic propagation factors and fracture toughness factors in metallic materials. A crack extension model is proposed wherein spontaneous stress (elastic) waves produced during microcracking are instrumental in promoting the onset of unstable crack extension. Material microstructural factors involved in this process are measurable by ultrasonic probing. Experimental results indicate that ultrasonic attenuation and velocity measurements will produce significant correlations with fracture <b>toughness</b> <b>properties</b> and also yield strength...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{strength}} differences (mismatch) between weld metal and two base metals {{as well as}} local variations of strength within weld metal/HAZ zones on the <b>toughness</b> <b>properties</b> were discussed. The significance of local fracture toughness measurement technique was also discussed by comparing the CTOD results of [delta] 5 and British Standard [delta]BS. Some differences between the two techniqes were discussed in particular for CGHAZ toughness of similar and dissimilar joints. Nadaljuje se kot: Materiali in tehnologij...|$|R
