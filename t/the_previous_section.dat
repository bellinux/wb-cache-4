5|$|By refraining {{from the}} advance a2-a3 White tries {{to gain a}} tempo on the lines of <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>section,</b> making it more {{difficult}} for Black to initiate the Re8–e6–h6 or Ra8–a6–h6 lifts. After the moves 6.Be2 0-0 7.0-0 Re8 8.Nc3 Ngxe5 9.Nxe5 Nxe5 White has tried two different plans.|$|E
5|$|The {{derivation}} {{outlined in}} <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>section</b> contains {{all the information}} needed to define general relativity, describe its key properties, and address a question of crucial importance in physics, namely how the theory {{can be used for}} model-building.|$|E
5|$|As a result, most geysers form {{in places}} where there is {{volcanic}} rhyolite rock which dissolves in hot water and forms mineral deposits called siliceous sinter, or geyserite, along {{the inside of the}} plumbing systems which are very slender. Over time, these deposits strengthen the channel walls by cementing the rock together tightly, thus enabling the geyser to persist, as mentioned in <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>section.</b>|$|E
30|$|Let us {{quantify}} this {{using the}} tools of <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>sections.</b>|$|R
30|$|Finally, {{we provide}} some {{examples}} {{to illustrate the}} conclusions in <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>sections.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{approximate}} solutions {{introduced in}} <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>sections</b> will be illustrated with some examples.|$|R
5|$|Between the two {{unstable}} regimes {{mentioned in}} <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>section,</b> and influenced {{by all the}} factors described above that contribute to balance (trail, mass distribution, gyroscopic effects, etc.), {{there may be a}} range of forward speeds for a given bike design at which these effects steer an uncontrolled bike upright. It has been proven that neither gyroscopic effects nor positive trail are sufficient by themselves or necessary for self-stability, although they certainly can enhance hands-free control.|$|E
5|$|Since exp(1) {{is equal}} to e and exp(x) {{satisfies}} this exponential identity, it immediately follows that exp(x) coincides with the repeated-multiplication definition of e'x for integer x, and it also follows that rational powers denote (positive) roots as usual, so exp(x) coincides with the e'x definitions in <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>section</b> for all real x by continuity.|$|E
5|$|Special {{relativity}} {{is defined}} {{in the absence of}} gravity, so for practical applications, it is a suitable model whenever gravity can be neglected. Bringing gravity into play, and assuming the universality of free fall, an analogous reasoning as in <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>section</b> applies: there are no global inertial frames. Instead there are approximate inertial frames moving alongside freely falling particles. Translated into the language of spacetime: the straight time-like lines that define a gravity-free inertial frame are deformed to lines that are curved relative to each other, suggesting that the inclusion of gravity necessitates a change in spacetime geometry.|$|E
30|$|In this section, we list some {{definitions}} and theory used in <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>sections.</b>|$|R
30|$|In this section, {{we provide}} {{an example to}} {{illustrate}} results from <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>sections.</b>|$|R

5|$|Within Mississauga, {{the freeway}} {{encounters}} its narrowest right-of-way, sandwiched between residential subdivisions {{on either side}} that prevent further expansion. It crosses the Credit River Valley, where a second bridge is under construction. The segment east of the Credit River is being examined for expansion possibilities, but, like <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>section,</b> there is little room for more lanes without property acquisition. After crossing Etobicoke Creek, which forms the boundary between Mississauga / Peel Region and Toronto, the route curves eastward to meet Highway427 at a large sprawling interchange. The QEW formerly continued beyond this interchange to the old Toronto city limits at the Humber River; this section was downloaded from provincial to municipal ownership on April1, 1997, and {{became part of the}} Gardiner Expressway.|$|E

30|$|This section {{presents}} the performance {{obtained for the}} quality control algorithm proposed in <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>sections.</b>|$|R
30|$|In this section, we {{construct}} {{an example to}} demonstrate the results obtained in <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>sections.</b>|$|R
30|$|In this section, {{we present}} {{numerical}} experiments to illustrate theoretical results obtained in <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>sections.</b>|$|R

30|$|As {{applications}} of our main results established in <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>sections,</b> we consider <b>the</b> following examples.|$|R
30|$|In <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>sections,</b> we {{have assumed}} {{deterministic}} traffic rates for communications between VMs and constant power consumption for active servers; however, in practice these quantities are random and vary as functions of time. In this section, we extend the optimization problem of <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>sections</b> {{to a more}} realistic model, where VM communication rates and server power consumption are considered as random variables.|$|R
30|$|In {{this section}} we will analyze the {{theoretical}} results presented in <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>sections</b> by numerical examples.|$|R
25|$|Authors {{for whom}} finite {{differences}} mean finite difference approximations define the forward/backward/central differences as the quotients given {{in this section}} (instead of employing the definitions given in <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>section).</b>|$|E
25|$|When k = n or n1 {{we saw in}} <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>section</b> that V'k(Fn) is a {{principal}} homogeneous space, and therefore diffeomorphic to the corresponding classical group. These {{are listed in the}} table at the right.|$|E
25|$|If {{observation}} {{is confined to}} regions sufficiently remote from a system of charges, a multipole expansion of the exact polarization density can be made. By truncating this expansion (for example, retaining only the dipole terms, or only the dipole and quadrupole terms, or etc.), the results of <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>section</b> are regained. In particular, truncating the expansion at the dipole term, the result is indistinguishable from the polarization density generated by a uniform dipole moment confined to the charge region. To the accuracy of this dipole approximation, as shown in <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>section,</b> the dipole moment density p(r) (which includes not only p but the location of p) serves as P(r).|$|E
30|$|Analogous to <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>sections,</b> {{we first}} derive the {{transmit}} powers as {{functions of the}} transmission time.|$|R

25|$|The {{next step}} is to prove that H2(E/F) is cyclic of order exactly |E/F|; <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>section</b> shows that it has at most this order, so it is {{sufficient}} to find some element of order |E/F| in H2(E/F).|$|E
25|$|If E has a {{terminal}} object e and if F is fibred over E, then the functor ε from cartesian sections to Fe defined {{at the end}} of <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>section</b> is an equivalence of categories and moreover surjective on objects.|$|E
25|$|Notice that {{by using}} the fact that any set of linearly {{independent}} vectors can be completed to a basis, we implicitly used the axiom of choice, which was not needed for the concrete example in <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>section</b> but one.|$|E
