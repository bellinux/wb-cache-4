Security concerns dealing with {{the protection of the}} execution environment from malicious agents are extensively being tackled. We concentrate on the reverse problem, namely how a mobile agent can be protected from malicious behaviour of the execution environment, which is largely ignored. We will identify the problem of trust as the major issue in this context and describe a trusted and tamper-proof hardware {{that can be used to}} divide this problem among several principals, each of which has to be trusted with a special task. We show that the presented approach can be used to mitigate an important problem in the design of open systems. 1 Introduction The notion of trust has long been recognized as being of paramount importance for the development of secure systems [8, 16, 28].

40|$|Trust Management {{researchers}} have created several sound frameworks for well-defined problems {{based on their}} deep understanding {{of the field and}} {{the current state of the}} art. However, Trust Management experts are rarely contacted for the design of distributed business applications. Developers of these kinds of business applications are not familiar with latest results and are only aware of a very limited set of applicable solutions. This hinders the adaption of these novel security solutions into provided future services. To support the integration of Trust Management into these areas we defined a design process, which can be applied systematically by developers. Based on the design process they can use their scenario knowledge to narrow down their design space and finally select from a limited set of applicable implementations the best fit. We extended the static TrustFraMM meta-description of Trust Management in a way to enable it to support the exploration and exclusion of existing <b>trust</b> <b>functionality</b> implementations. We built our process on a number of requirements collected through our user-centered design approach. We also provide a possible visualization of the process which we evaluated using a paper prototype. Our process had a positive user acceptance among the questioned users...|$|R

40|$|Background Insomnia is {{a common}} {{psychological}} complaint. Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), although effective, is little used {{because of lack of}} trained providers. Computerised CBT-I (CCBT-I) may be a solution to this shortfall in access. Aim To explore patient and health professional perspectives and the role of social networking, to develop a novel CCBT-I programme to increase access to this form of intervention. Design and setting Qualitative methods underpinned by the theory of planned behaviour in primary care in Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire. Method Semi-structured interviews and focus groups with a purposive sample of health professionals and adults with insomnia. Results A total of 23 health professionals and 28 patients were interviewed. Features designed to engender <b>trust</b> and improve <b>functionality</b> were perceived to improve uptake and adherence to CCBT-I. Trust lay in programme accreditation; for professionals, trust derived from evidence of effectiveness; for patients, trust depended on the doctor–patient relationship, professional support, the quality of online peer support, and perceptions of risk. Patients wanted mobile applications; access in short periods; self-assessment; interactive, personalised information on sleep; and moderated contact with other users. Patients and practitioners differed over whether useful information could be distinguished from less useful or potentially incorrect information. Conclusion Improving uptake and adherence to online programmes for insomnia requires design features focusing on <b>trust</b> and <b>functionality.</b> Enabling greater patient control and interaction with other users and professionals may stimulate positive experiences of online therapy. CCBT-I would enable greater access to treatment but is limited by lack of online access or poor computer literac...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{the idea of}} offline count-limited {{certificates}} (or clics for short), and show how these can be implemented using minimal <b>trusted</b> hardware <b>functionality</b> already widely available today. Offline count-limited certificates are digital certificates that: (1) specify usage conditions that depend on irreversible counters, and (2) are used in a protocol that guarantees that any attempt to use them in violation of these usage conditions will be detected even if the user of the certificate and the verifying party have no contact at all {{with the outside world}} {{at the time of the}} transaction. Such certificates enable many interesting applications not possible with traditional (unlimited use) certificates, including count-limited delegation and access, offline commerce and trading using cashlike migratable certificates, and others.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} providing <b>trusted</b> computing <b>functionality</b> in high availability systems. We {{consider the}} case where data is required to be encrypted with a TPM protected key. For redundancy, and to facilitate high availability, the same TPM key is stored in multiple computational units, each one ready to take over if the main unit breaks down. This requires the TPM key to be migratable. We show how such systems can be realized using the secure storage of the TPM. Hundreds of millions TPM 1. 2 chips have been shipped but with the recent introduction of TPM 2. 0, more manufacturers are expected to start shipping this newer TPM. Thus, a migration from TPM 1. 2 to TPM 2. 0 will likely {{be seen in the}} next few years. To address this issue, we also provide an API that allows a smooth upgrade from TPM 1. 2 to TPM 2. 0 without having to redesign the communication protocol involving the dierent entities.

Software updates after delivery of the vehicle to patch or enhance existing soft-ware, or delivery of digital content for in-car info-tainment has become a common issue also within the automotive area. In order to prevent misuse {{that could lead to}} real manufacturer’s loss or dam-age or even affect the operational safety of a vehi-cle, embedded software and digital content need to be protected.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} divided into two {{distinct}} parts. The first part of the thesis explores the role Trusted Computing can play in securing Internet-based Card Not Present (CNP) transactions. We highlight how Trusted Platform Module (TPM) enabled Platforms, as are currently available in the marketplace, can be used as adjuncts to CNP enabling protocols, such as SSL and 3 -D Secure. As an extension to this, we demonstrate how newer Trusted Computing technologies, such as processor, chipset and operating system extensions, can provide a measured virtualisation layer on top of which emulated EMV (chip and pin) cards can run. The second part of this thesis looks at how Trusted Computing can be used to add security functionality to a number of computing paradigms. Firstly, we examine how Trusted Computing can be used to provide stable pseudonymous identities on top of which reputation systems can be built for Peer-to-Peer systems.

40|$|With {{the growth}} of the Internet, various types of {{services}} are rapidly expanding; such services include the World Wide Web (WWW), the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and remote login. Consequently, managing authentication information, e. g., user ID/password pairs, keys, and certificates- is difficult for users, since the amount of required authentication information has been increased. To address this problem, researchers have developed a Single Sign-On (SSO) system that makes all the services available for a user via a one-time authentication: however, existing authentication systems cannot provide such SSO services for all kind of services on the Internet, even if the service provider deploys the SSO server. Further, existing systems also cannot provide the SSO service which does not make it conscious of a network domain to a user on secure network environment. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new SSO system with a hardware token and a key management server to improve the safety, ubiquity, and adaptability of services. Further, we implement the proposed system and show its effectiveness through evaluation. Adding any functions for this system provides various conveniences to us.

This paper aims at making the first steps towards the design and implementation of an open source and interoperable security architecture that pre-vents both classical and malware phishing attacks.

40|$|The problem: Insomnia is {{the most}} {{commonly}} reported psychological complaint in Britain. Although hypnotic drugs are widely used for treatment of insomnia, they are only licensed short term and adverse effects are common. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), which is effective and safe long term, is recommended first line but is not widely used nor available, {{in part because of}} the lack of trained providers. In response to this, Computerised Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CCBT) has been advocated. Existing CCBT programmes can suffer from poor rates of uptake, adherence and completion. We aimed to investigate patients and practitioners’ views on how CCBT for insomnia (CCBT-I) could be improved by incorporating features of modern technology including social networking functions. The approach: We used a qualitative design and the theory of planned behaviour to underpin the study. Interviews and focus groups were held with adult service users and health professionals using a topic guide designed to elicit participants’ beliefs, intentions and controlling factors that might facilitate or create barriers to the uptake and adherence to CCBT-I. We explored the data using thematic analysis supported by Nvivo. Findings: We interviewed 23 health professionals and 28 patients. We identified multi-faceted issues focused on meta-themes of <b>trust</b> and <b>functionality</b> which were perceived to increase likelihood of successful uptake and adherence. Trust and confidence would be increased if CCBT-I was perceived to be evidence-based and accredited; when referral was from a trusted professional within a supervised package of care; and when online support and follow-up were provided. Interaction with other users, by integrating CCBT-I with social networking, was perceived to provide mutual support but concerns from people with sleep problems included apprehension about online ‘strangers’ and concerns from practitioners included information security. Asynchronous communication such as posting a note, commenting on a forum or adding to a thread was considered safer than engaging in real-time on-line communication. To improve functionality patients wanted mobile applications; access in short periods; self-assessment of insomnia and its causes; more personalised information on sleep; an interactive approach; and contact with other users to be moderated or overseen. Consequences: Although previous qualitative studies have looked at CCBT uptake and adherence, none have looked at insomnia exclusively or explored the feasibility, advantages and drawbacks of online communication between participants. Improving uptake and adherence to online programmes for insomnia requires attention to design features which are focused on <b>trust</b> and <b>functionality.</b> Although computerised therapies for insomnia would allow more people to access treatment, some would not be suitable for online therapies because of lack of online access or poor computer literacy.

40|$|Abstract. Today, {{digital content}} is {{routinely}} distributed over the Inter-net, and consumed in devices based on open platforms. However, on open platforms users can run exploits, reconfigure the underlying operating system or simply mount replay attacks since {{the state of}} any (persistent) storage can easily be reset to some prior state. Faced with this difficulty, existing approaches to Digital Rights Management (DRM) are mainly based on preventing the copying of protected content thus protecting the needs of content providers. These inflexible mechanisms are not ten-able {{in the long term}} since their restrictiveness prevents reasonable usage scenarios, and even honest users may be tempted to circumvent DRM systems. In this paper we present a security architecture and the correspond-ing reference implementation that enables the secure usage and transfer of stateful licenses (and content) on a virtualized open platform. Our architecture allows for openness while protecting security objectives of both users (flexibility, fairer usage, and privacy) and content providers (license enforcement). In particular, it prevents replay attacks that is fundamental for secure management and distribution of stateful licenses. Our main objective is to show the feasibility of secure and fairer distri-bution and sharing of content and rights among different devices.

In such a system, not only the software but also the hardware needs {{to be included in}} platform attestation. Glas et al. [41, 42] integrate a TPM with an FPGA system. They introduce a component called Trust-Block that is responsible for securely booting the system. The FPGA itself is split into a user-programmable part and a static section. All reconfiguration of the FPGA has to be performed via functionality provided by this static section. It is also responsible for measuring the new system configuration into the TPM. Eisenbarth et al. [43] also integrate TC into an FPGA system but they do not use a dedicated TPM chip but integrate the TPM functionality as custom logic into the FPGA. Using a so-called Bitstream Trust Engine, they realize authenticity and integrity guarantees. Additionally, they also measure the TPM's implementation netlist. The main advantages of this approach are that the TPM itself becomes part of the chain of <b>trust,</b> TPM <b>functionality</b> can be easily updated and extended and TPM performance can be increased. Schelleckens et al. [44] also aim to integrate TPM functionality into FPGA-based systems. Contrary to other approaches, they do not rely on additional hardware or hardware modifications to realizes TPM functionality but use physical unclonable functions. These are unique characteristics inherent to all ICs including SRAM-based FPGAs. These functions can be used to realize secure key storage which in turn provides the foundation for a TPM implementation.|$|R

Abstract—Interdependencies between different security pat-terns can influence the properties of a particular pattern when applied {{in conjunction with other}} patterns.

As an example, we use the interesting case in which the proper integration of two patterns provides stronger security properties than the simple unification of the two properties. Formally, this increase in secu-rity is achieved by linking parameters of refined versions of the individual properties. The example shows the combination of two different authenticity properties (authenticity of a device based on <b>trusted</b> platform module <b>functionality</b> and authenticity of a user by using SSL).

This publication shows the usage of the already available Trusted Platform Module to allow for distribution channel protection and to leverage overall security by allowing the secure identification of a specific device. It also explains a few additional <b>Trusted</b> Platform Module <b>functionalities</b> that can be used...|$|R
30|$|A Cluster based Trust-aware Routing Protocol (CBTRP) {{to protect}} packets from the attackers was {{proposed}} in [39]. With the aim to provide security, trust-based security systems {{were presented in}} different network architectures [40 – 43]. To overcome the drawbacks of conventional security systems, the uncertainty reasoning has been assessed as the probabilistic technique with trust in MANET where mobility is considered with greater importance [38, 39]. In most of such uncertain management methodologies, {{the distance of the}} nodes is calculated with respect to Euclidean distance. However, this distance calculation suits only for a specific distance function [44, 45]. To handle this distance computation issue in uncertain space, Voronoi diagrams have been introduced by [46, 47]. This computational geometric structure is applied for decomposition of network space into polygonal regions, to evaluate the distance distribution [48, 49]. The distribution of mobile nodes with increased network capacity and throughput in hexagonal structures was introduced in [50]. The regular hexagonal partitions have proven its flexibility to form non-overlapping clusters in large ad hoc networks [51]. In order to secure network <b>functionalities,</b> <b>trust</b> management has been widely applied in ad hoc networks [52 – 57]. These methodologies prevent various attacks that might affect the system passively or actively.|$|R
