5|$|Adverse {{effects from}} {{medications}} {{are reported in}} 10 to 90% of people, depending on how and from whom the data is collected. Most adverse effects are dose-related and mild. Some examples include mood changes, sleepiness, or an unsteadiness in gait. Certain medications have side effects that are not related <b>to</b> <b>dose</b> such as rashes, liver toxicity, or suppression of the bone marrow. Up to a quarter of people stop treatment due to adverse effects. Some medications are associated with birth defects when used in pregnancy. Many of the common used medications, such as valproate, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbitol, and gabapentin {{have been reported to}} cause increased risk of birth defects, especially when used during the first trimester. Despite this, treatment is often continued once effective, because the risk of untreated epilepsy is believed to be greater than the risk of the medications. Among the antiepileptic medications, levetiracetam and lamotrigine seem to carry the lowest risk of causing birth defects.|$|E

25|$|Today, {{morphine}} and codeine {{are available}} in various forms as single formulation products, which are easier <b>to</b> <b>dose</b> and are much cheaper than opium tincture. Thus, opium is rarely prescribed to treat pain in contemporary medicine. Further, opium tincture contains 17% to 19% alcohol, by volume, which may complicate its use as an analgesic in patients for whom alcohol is contraindicated.|$|E
25|$|Bromide compounds, {{especially}} sodium bromide, {{remained in}} over-the-counter sedatives and headache remedies (such {{as the original}} formulation of Bromo-Seltzer) in the US until 1975, when bromides were outlawed in all over-the-counter medicines, due to chronic toxicity. Bromide's exceedingly long half life in the body made it difficult <b>to</b> <b>dose</b> without side effects (see below). Medical use of bromides in the US was discontinued at this time, as many better and shorter-acting sedatives were known by then.|$|E
25|$|Idiosyncratic (type B) injury occurs without warning, when agents cause non-predictable {{hepatotoxicity}} in susceptible individuals, {{which is}} not related <b>to</b> <b>dose</b> and has a variable latency period. This type of injury {{does not have a}} clear dose-response nor temporal relationship, and most often does not have predictive models. Idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity has led to the withdrawal of several drugs from market even after rigorous clinical testing as part of the FDA approval process; Troglitazone (Rezulin) and trovafloxacin (Trovan) are two prime examples of idiosyncratic hepatotoxins pulled from market.|$|E

25|$|Progesterone is {{extensively}} {{converted into}} allopregnanolone (as well as pregnanolone) upon oral ingestion {{due to a}} large first-pass effect (>90% metabolism), and allopregnanolone has a relatively short elimination half-life in the circulation. For these reasons, there are dramatic and highly supraphysiological spikes in allopregnanolone concentrations followed by steep declines with each oral intake of progesterone. Hence, allopregnanolone levels fluctuate substantially (e.g., 15-fold) and in an unphysiological manner with oral progesterone during treatment. Moreover, consumption of food with oral progesterone increases its absorption by two-fold, which may further compound fluctuations in neurosteroid levels if food intake with progesterone is not consistent from dose <b>to</b> <b>dose.</b>|$|E

In their book Trick or Treatment?, Edzard Ernst and Simon Singh conclude that [...] "The concepts of orthomolecular medicine are not biologically plausible and not supported by the results of rigorous clinical trials.

In humans, {{a dose of}} 1 sievert carries a 5.5% risk of developing cancer, and this risk {{is assumed to be}} linearly proportional <b>to</b> <b>dose</b> even for low doses. Ionizing radiation causes deletions in chromosomes. If a developing organism such as an unborn child is irradiated, it is possible a birth defect may be induced, but it is unlikely this defect will be in a gamete or a gamete-forming cell. The incidence of radiation-induced mutations in humans is small, as in most mammals, because of natural cellular-repair mechanisms, many just now coming to light. These mechanisms range from DNA, mRNA and protein repair, to internal lysosomic digestion of defective proteins, and even induced cell suicideâ€”apoptosis ...|$|E
2500|$|Furthermore, {{regardless}} of if {{a nuclear attack}} on a city is of the surface or air-burst variety or a mixture of both, the advice to shelter in place, {{in the interior of}} well-built homes, or if available, fallout shelters, as suggested in the film Duck and Cover, will drastically reduce one's chance of absorbing a hazardous dose of radiation. A real-world example of this occurred after the Castle Bravo test where, in contrast to the crew of the Lucky Dragon, the firing crew that triggered the explosion safely sheltered in their firing station until after a number of hours had passed and the radiation levels outside fell <b>to</b> <b>dose</b> rate levels safe enough for an evacuation to be considered. The comparative safety experienced by the Castle Bravo firing crew served as a proof of concept to civil defense personnel that Shelter in place (or [...] "buttoning up" [...] as it was known then) is an effective strategy in mitigating the potentially serious health effects of local fallout.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} to what extent changes in speech after C-IMRT treatment are related <b>to</b> mean <b>doses</b> <b>to</b> the tongue and velopharynx (VP). In 34 patients with advanced hypopharyngeal, nasopharyngeal, or oropharyngeal cancer, changes in speech from pretreatment to 10 weeks and 1 year posttreatment were correlated with mean <b>doses</b> <b>to</b> the base of tongue (BOT), oral cavity (OC) and tonsillar fossa/soft palate (VP). Differences in anteroposterior tongue position, dorsoventral degree of tongue to palate or pharynx constriction, grooving, strength, nasality, and laryngeal rise, were assessed by acoustic changes in three speech sounds that depend on a (post-) alveolar closure or narrowing (/t/, /s/, /z/), three with a tongue to palate/pharyngeal narrowing (/l/, /r/, /u/), and in vowel /a/ at comfortable and highest pitch. Acoustically assessed changes in tongue positioning, shape, velopharyngeal constriction, and laryngeal elevation were significantly related <b>to</b> mean <b>doses</b> <b>to</b> the tongue and velopharynx. The mean <b>dose</b> <b>to</b> BOT predicted changes in anteroposterior tongue positioning from pre- to 10 -weeks posttreatment.

Week 52 remission, response, and mucosal healing rates were assessed in ULTRA 2 adalimumab-randomised patients who escalated <b>to</b> weekly <b>dosing.</b> Patients were stratified by week 8 response per partial Mayo score. Kaplan-Meier and logistic regression analyses estimated time <b>to</b> weekly <b>dosing</b> and defined predictors of escalation <b>to</b> weekly <b>dosing,</b> respectively.

The rate of escalation <b>to</b> weekly <b>dosing</b> was 16. 3 % (20 / 123) for week 8 responders and 38. 4 % (48 / 125) for week 8 nonresponders. Week 52 remission, response and mucosal healing rates with weekly dosing were 20 %, 45 %, and 45 % for week 8 responders and 2. 1 %, 25 % and 29. 2 % for nonresponders, respectively (NRI).

40|$|Metabonomics {{has been}} used {{for a long time to}} help to {{understand}} drug metabolism, drug safety, drug efficacy, and the etiology and progression of disease states, and is thus of central importance to drug discovery and development.

In this respect pharmacometabonomics is the metabolic profiling equivalent of pharmacogenomics, which itself can enable some degree of prediction of drug effects prior <b>to</b> <b>dosing,</b> based on genomic profiles.
