2500|$|Jay Leno in 2012 {{featured}} <b>the</b> <b>LFA</b> on his internet car enthusiast program Jay Leno's Garage {{where he}} looked at in-depth features of <b>the</b> Lexus <b>LFA</b> including <b>the</b> carbon fiber construction, interior features and the engine. Leno heaped praises on <b>the</b> Lexus <b>LFA</b> engineering, attention to details and quality of work all around. Leno took the car for a test drive in the California mountains and had raving impressions of <b>the</b> <b>LFA</b> driving dynamics, handling, chassis rigidity and engine sound. Leno stated that <b>the</b> <b>LFA</b> was [...] "one of the greatest supercars ever built and certainly the best supercar ever to have come out Japan". Leno was very impressed with <b>the</b> <b>LFA's</b> city driving abilities {{and thought it was}} a very [...] "docile car around town". Leno summarized <b>the</b> <b>LFA</b> as [...] "certainly, there might be cars out there that could individually do things better than <b>the</b> <b>LFA.</b> Maybe a bit quicker or handling a bit better. But, no other car I know of does everything so extremely well".|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>LFA</b> {{appeared}} on Top Gear USA {{in the third}} quarter of 2011 in the [...] "Beating Tanner" [...] episode where Tanner did a hotlap around Infineon Raceway in <b>the</b> <b>LFA</b> while competing against Adam and Rutledge doing the same lap in <b>the</b> <b>LFA</b> around 'Infineon Raceway in a video game. Tanner Foust ran a quickest lap around Infineon Raceway in 1:44.|$|R
50|$|The Leyte Football Association was {{established}} on March 8, 2003 and was initially {{known as the}} Futbol Sociedad de Tacloban/Leyte (FSL). The FSL was formally reorganized as the Leyte Football Association in April 29, 2009 and elected its first officers as <b>the</b> <b>LFA.</b> Dan Palami was elected as <b>the</b> first <b>LFA</b> President. <b>The</b> <b>LFA</b> {{was admitted to the}} Philippine Football Federation (PFF) on November of the same year. <b>The</b> <b>LFA</b> became <b>the</b> 33rd regular member of the PFF on November 30, 2010.|$|R
2500|$|The {{magazine}} wrote, [...] "In fact, <b>the</b> <b>LFA</b> hits 100 mph four-tenths {{faster than}} the GT-R — and just keeps going. As both flash past the quarter-mile marker, <b>the</b> <b>LFA</b> never looks back". The magazine also found <b>the</b> <b>LFA</b> to be superior in dynamic handling. Regarding challenges in launching <b>the</b> <b>LFA</b> with its automated transmission without having {{the ability to use}} its launch control, Motor Trend noted, [...] "It works, but not all of the time. A great launch means only a chirp of the tires and blistering acceleration, but vary the rpm just bit and <b>the</b> <b>LFA</b> torches its rubber before rocketing down the strip. A slight delay between paddle actuation and SMG response further complicates a fast start." [...] Motor Trend awarded the win in this comparison to Lexus LFA.|$|R

2500|$|Car and Driver {{concluded}} in its review of <b>the</b> <b>LFA</b> and its performance that the carbon-fiber sports car rated as a [...] "bargain" [...] {{compared to the}} more expensive Enzo Ferrari and Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren. In May 2010, Motor Trend ran <b>the</b> <b>LFA</b> through several track tests and praised its driving dynamics and performance. <b>The</b> <b>LFA</b> has also been criticized for being sold at a price much higher than comparable sports cars.|$|R
2500|$|Battle of the Supercars did a {{head-to-head}} {{comparison of}} Audi R8 V10 with <b>the</b> Lexus <b>LFA</b> with Tanner Foust driving <b>the</b> <b>LFA</b> and Paul Tracy driving the R8 V10 at the runways of Westover Air Reserve Base.

This test also saw LFA using launch control {{for the first time}} in the 0-100-0mph test, which led to <b>the</b> <b>LFA</b> accelerating from [...] much faster than the R8 V10.|$|R

Its participants were two plane-loads of Scottish pupils and teachers from 31 local authorities - typically two pupils from a school accompanied by a teacher. This research, funded by the Holocaust Educational Trust and the Pears Foundation, involved these participants being invited to complete an online questionnaire with selected follow-up interviews.

However, {{it was noted that}} <b>the</b> <b>LFA</b> cost 3 times more than the Gallardo, and is £130,000 more than the Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano but not faster than it; Jeremy Clarkson also noted that <b>the</b> 202mph <b>LFA</b> costs 6 times more than the 193mph Nissan GT-R but is not 6 times faster. In response, Evo's review of <b>the</b> <b>LFA</b> pointed out that the performance of [...] "a Bugatti Veyron is not 12 times more than the GT-R", with reviewer Chris Harris observing that no cars are 6 times more than a GT-R either. In Top Gear (Series 19, Ep.2) Jeremy Clarkson states at the start that <b>the</b> <b>LFA</b> is <b>the</b> best car he's ever driven and in the end, quoted, [...] "If I could have any car ever made given to me I'd pick a dark blue Lexus LFA."

40|$|A simple lateral-flow assay (LFA) {{based on}} a {{monoclonal}} antibody (MAb 70 - 17) was developed {{for the detection of}} foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) under nonlaboratory conditions. <b>The</b> <b>LFA</b> was evaluated with epithelial suspensions (n = 704) prepared from current and historical field samples which had been submitted to the Pirbright Laboratory (United Kingdom) and from negative samples (n = 100) collected from naïve animals in Korea. Four FMDV serotypes (type O, A, Asia 1, and C) were detected in <b>the</b> <b>LFA,</b> but not <b>the</b> remaining three FMDV serotypes (SAT 1, SAT 2, and SAT 3). The diagnostic sensitivity of <b>the</b> <b>LFA</b> for FMDV types O, A, C, and Asia 1 was similar, at approximately 87. 3 %, to that of 87. 7 % obtained with antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Ag-ELISA). The diagnostic specificity of <b>the</b> <b>LFA</b> was 98. 8 %, compared to 100 % for the Ag-ELISA. These results demonstrate that <b>the</b> <b>LFA</b> using <b>the</b> FMDV MAb 70 - 17 to detect FMDV is a supportive method for taking rapid measurements at the site of a suspected foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in Asia before diagnosing the disease in the laboratory, thereby offering the possibility of implementing control procedures more rapidly...|$|R
