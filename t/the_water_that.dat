5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} react vigorously or explosively with cold water, {{producing}} an aqueous solution of a strongly basic alkali metal hydroxide and releasing hydrogen gas. This reaction becomes more vigorous {{going down the}} group: lithium reacts steadily with effervescence, but sodium and potassium can ignite and rubidium and caesium sink in water and generate hydrogen gas so rapidly that shock waves form in <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>that</b> may shatter glass containers. When an alkali metal is dropped into water, it produces an explosion, {{of which there are}} two separate stages. The metal reacts with the water first, breaking the hydrogen bonds in the water and producing hydrogen gas; this takes place faster for the more reactive heavier alkali metals. Second, the heat generated by {{the first part of the}} reaction often ignites the hydrogen gas, causing it to burn explosively into the surrounding air. This secondary hydrogen gas explosion produces the visible flame above the bowl of water, lake or other body of water, not the initial reaction of the metal with water (which tends to happen mostly under water). The alkali metal hydroxides are the most basic known hydroxides.|$|E
5|$|Balch's {{investigations}} into geomorphology and hydrology {{led to his}} decision {{to try to find}} the origins of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>that</b> rose to the surface at Wookey Hole Caves, the source of the River Axe. In 1901, he led a team of miners and cavers to dig into Swildon's Hole, where he found the 'Forty Foot Pot' as well as chambers full of stalagmites. Despite the publicity around the find, Balch refused to disclose the location of the cave as he believed it was too dangerous for amateur explorers. The farmer who owned the land denied them entrance the following year, turning the valley into a fish farm, so the team headed upstream where they discovered Eastwater Cavern, one of Balch's personal favourites.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>water</b> <b>that</b> {{flows through}} the Roman Baths is {{considered}} unsafe for bathing, partly due to its having passed through the still-functioning original lead pipes, and up until World War II, it was advertised {{on the basis of}} the radioactivity it contained. However, the more significant danger is now considered to be infectious diseases. In October 1978, a young girl swimming with the Bath Dolphins, a local swimming club, in the restored Roman Bath contracted meningitis and died, leading to the closure of the bath for several years. Tests showed that Naegleria fowleri, an extremely dangerous disease-causing amoeba, was in the water. The newly constructed Thermae Bath Spa nearby, designed by Nicholas Grimshaw and Partners, and the refurbished Cross Bath allow modern-day bathers to experience the waters via a series of more recently drilled boreholes.|$|E
5|$|Zoroastrians were {{subjected}} to public discrimination through dress regulations – not allowed to wear new or white clothes, and compelled by enactments to wear the dull yellow raiment already alluded to as a distinguishing badge. They {{were not allowed to}} wear overcoats but were compelled to wear long robes called qaba and cotton geeveh on their feet even in winter. Wearing eyeglasses, long cloak, trousers, hat, boots, socks, winding their turbans tightly and neatly, carrying watch or a ring, were all forbidden to Zoroastrians. During the rainy days they were not allowed carry umbrellas or to appear in public, because <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>that</b> had run down through their bodies and cloths could pollute the Muslims. Zoroastrian men in Yazd would carry a large shawl that they would place under their feet when visiting a Muslim's home so as to prevent the carpet from being polluted. Forbidden from riding horses and only allowed to ride mules or donkeys, upon facing a Muslim they had to dismount. Not until 1923, was the general proscription against Zoroastrians' riding horses and donkeys lifted by Reza Shah.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} Malvern water is {{attributable}} to its source. Malvern Hills are amongst the oldest and hardest rocks found in the United Kingdom, with their geology responsible {{for the quality of}} Malvern's spring water. The hills consist of Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rock, the oldest of which are about 670 million years old. The rocks are characterised by low porosity and high secondary permeability via fissures. Malvern water is rainwater and snow meltwater that percolates through fissures created by the pressures of tectonic movements about 300 million years ago when advancing sedimentary layers of Silurian shale and limestone were pushed into and under older Precambrian rock. When the fissures are saturated, a water table forms and the water emerges as springs around the fault lines between the strata. Depending on rainfall, the flow can vary from as little as 36 litres (8 gallons) per minute to over 350 litres (77 gallons) per minute. The water permeates through the rock which, because of its hardness, leaves little or no mineral traces in the water, {{while at the same time}} the very fine cracks act as a filter for other impurities. Rainfall on the Malvern Hills is thought to be sufficient to account for all <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>that</b> runs out of the springs, reflected for example in some spring flows six to eight weeks after heavy rainfall, and in reduced flows after a dry period.|$|E

25|$|Although Kyrgyzstan has {{abundant}} {{water running}} through it, its water supply {{is determined by}} a post-Soviet sharing agreement among the five Central Asian republics. As in the Soviet era, Kyrgyzstan {{has the right to}} 25% of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>that</b> originates in its territory, but the new agreement allows Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan unlimited use of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>that</b> flows into them from Kyrgyzstan, with no compensation for the nation at the source. Kyrgyzstan uses the entire amount to which the agreement entitles it, but utilization is skewed heavily in favor of agricultural irrigation. During the Soviet era, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan shared their abundant water resources with Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan during summer, and these three nations shared oil and gas with Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan in winter. According to the International Crisis Group, the skewed system that is currently in place could cause irreversible regional destabilization, and needs to be dealt with by international actors to avoid a crisis in Central Asia. In 1994 agriculture accounted for about 88% of total water consumption, compared with 8% by industry and 4% by municipal water distribution systems. According to World Bank experts, Kyrgyzstan has an adequate supply of high-quality water for future use, provided the resource is prudently managed.|$|E
