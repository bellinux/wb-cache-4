5|$|After the discovery, Libby Sheldon of University College London {{conducted}} several <b>tests</b> <b>to</b> {{verify the}} painting's age, including spectroscopy and laser microscopy. The {{age of the}} inscription was taken into consideration, and found to be contemporaneous {{with the rest of}} the painting. Pigments, including a type of yellow pigment rarely found after 1600, were appropriate for the 16th century. Dendrochronological analysis later showed that the work was too late to be a life portrait of Jane, but did not rule out the possibility of reproduction.|$|E
5|$|Aqueous {{extracts}} of {{the fruit}} bodies contain polysaccharides that have been shown in laboratory <b>tests</b> <b>to</b> be highly efficient at inhibiting infection by tobacco mosaic virus. Several bioactive compounds have been isolated and identified from the mushroom, including allitol, stearic acid, furan-3-carboxylic acid, (22E,24R)-3β-hydroxyergosta-5,22-diene, 3β-hydroxy-5α,8α-epidioxy-24ξ-methylcholesta-6-ene, dihydrofuran-2,5-dione,3β-hydroxy-5α,8α-epidioxyergosta-6,22-diene, palmitic acid, uracil, cis-butenedioic acid, thioacetic anhydride, succinic acid, 1-ethylic-βD-glycoside, 2-acetamino-2-deoxy-β-D-glucose, and cerebrosideB.|$|E
5|$|Cancer {{screening}} uses medical <b>tests</b> <b>to</b> detect {{disease in}} {{large groups of}} people who have no symptoms. For individuals with high risk of developing lung cancer, computed tomography (CT) screening can detect cancer and give a person options to respond to {{it in a way that}} prolongs life. This form of screening reduces the chance of death from lung cancer by an absolute amount of 0.3% (relative amount of 20%). High risk people are those age 55–74 who have smoked equivalent amount of a pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years including time within the past 15 years.|$|E

This {{included}} <b>tests</b> <b>to</b> investigate the properties of isotopes such as tritium and determine the neutron capture cross section of elements and compounds that might be used to construct future reactors, or occur in impurities.

5|$|Ethanol {{extracts}} of {{the fruit}} body are high in antioxidant activity, and have been shown in laboratory <b>tests</b> <b>to</b> have anti-inflammatory activity comparable to the drug diclofenac. Studies with mouse models have also demonstrated hepatoprotective (liver-protecting) ability, possibly by restoring diminished levels of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase caused by experimental exposure to the liver-damaging chemical carbon tetrachloride.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, various {{companies}} were established to research subjects and provide practice <b>tests</b> <b>to</b> teams. Two {{of the major}} ones were Acalon Cards and Exams and DemiDec, formed by former coach Dan Spetner and former Decathlete Daniel Berdichevsky, respectively. The two offer exams and study guides that can augment or replace USAD's official materials. USAD explicitly discouraged teams from ordering materials from third-party companies in the late 1998, though it later removed their discouragement from the curriculum page. USAD republished their discouragement {{just a few weeks}} after removing it, but did not publish such a warning in 2002.|$|E

Categorical {{variables were}} compared using the Chi-square test and the Fisher exact test in case of small numbers. Related samples were compared using the paired-samples t <b>test</b> <b>to</b> compare means. A p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. After using the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing for the eight different POP-Q points, the p value for statistical significance regarding these points was lowered from 0.05 to 0.006 (alpha 0.05). Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 18.0 (SPSS inc., Chicago, IL).|$|R
5|$|In {{the later}} {{days of the}} trial, Quisling's health suffered, {{largely as a result}} of the number of medical <b>tests</b> <b>to</b> which he was subjected, and his defence faltered. The prosecution's {{powerful}} final speech placed responsibility for the Final Solution being carried out in Norway at the feet of Quisling, using the testimony of German officials. The prosecutor Annæus Schjødt called for the death penalty, using laws introduced by the government-in-exile in October 1941 and January 1942.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that some trees are interconnected through their root system, forming a colony. The interconnections are made by the inosculation process, a kind of natural grafting or welding of vegetal tissues. The <b>tests</b> <b>to</b> demonstrate this networking are performed by injecting chemicals, sometimes radioactive, into a tree, and then checking for its presence in neighbouring trees.|$|E

The MSE can also be considered part of the comprehensive physical examination performed by physicians and nurses although it may be performed in a cursory and abbreviated way in non-mental-health settings. Information is usually recorded as free-form text using the standard headings, but brief MSE checklists are available for use in emergency situations, for example by paramedics or emergency department staff.|$|E

5|$|Kritschgau and Skinner put Mulder under {{additional}} <b>tests</b> <b>to</b> verify his abnormal brain activity. They again inject Mulder with phenytoin, {{but this}} time they are caught by Fowley and Mulder goes into a seizure. Meanwhile Dr. Barnes, in a bizarre type of experiment, kills his driver, but the driver soon reanimates and kills him instead. Scully flies back to the U.S. and visits Mulder at the hospital. On the African coast, Ngebe arrives with the police, finding Dr. Barnes dead and the spaceship gone.|$|E
5|$|Malaria: During {{the early}} 1940s, quinine {{was the chief}} anti-malarial drug. Made from the bark of the South American cinchona tree, quinine was in short supply during the war, so {{scientists}} began searching for an alternative treatment. The test subjects allowed themselves to be bitten by malarial mosquitoes and when the fever reached its peak in three to four days, were given experimental treatments. At the University of Minnesota, twelve CPS men underwent <b>tests</b> <b>to</b> determine the recovery period for those infected with malaria. This research documented the debilitating effects {{of the disease and}} the amount of time required for a complete recovery.|$|E
5|$|Nine days later, {{he checked}} into Methodist Hospital in Houston {{for a series}} of {{physical}} and psychological <b>tests</b> <b>to</b> determine the cause of his mysterious arm problems. An angiogram revealed an obstruction in the distal subclavian and axillary arteries of the right arm. Richard's blood pressure in his left arm was normal but pressure was nearly absent in his right arm due to the completely obstructed artery. On July 25, however, the arteries in his neck were studied, and the doctors reached a conclusion that all was normal and no surgical treatment needed to be performed.|$|E

Four accelerated <b>tests</b> were devised <b>to</b> simulate the possible degradation processes mentioned above. These four tests are: a thermal shock <b>test</b> <b>to</b> simulate the wide variation of temperature expected in space (260 C to - 100 C), a cyclic temperature <b>test</b> <b>to</b> stimulate the 6 minute temperature cycle anticipated in space, a mechanical vibration <b>test</b> <b>to</b> simulate mechanical bonding, folding and handling, and a humidity <b>test</b> <b>to</b> simulate terrestrial environment effects.
