5|$|When Turkey {{decided to}} join in the war {{on the side of the}} Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy), the Ottoman Sultan, Mehmed V. Reshad (1844–1918) {{declared}} a jihad against the Allied Powers (Britain, France and Russia) and issued a fatwa calling on Muslims all around the world to throw <b>their</b> <b>lot</b> with the Caliphate. This move had a huge impact on Muslims throughout the world as the Ottoman Sultan was revered as the Caliph of Islam and long considered by Indian Muslims as the final bulwark of Muslim power following the collapse of the Moghul empire in India. Overnight, Muslims serving under the British Army, such as the sepoys, faced an existential dilemma and their loyalty being torn between their ummah (community, brotherhood) and their British colonial superiors.|$|E
5|$|After this turmoil, Severus faced no more {{internal}} threats for {{the rest}} of his reign, and the reign of his successor Caracalla passed uninterrupted for a while until he was murdered by Macrinus, who proclaimed himself emperor. Despite Macrinus having his position ratified by the Roman senate, the troops of Varius Avitus declared him to be emperor instead, and the two met in battle at the Battle of Antioch in 218 AD, in which Macrinus was defeated. However, Avitus himself, after taking the imperial name Elagabalus, was murdered shortly afterwards and Alexander Severus was proclaimed emperor by both the Praetorian Guard and the senate who, after a short reign, was murdered in turn. His murderers were working on behalf of the army who were unhappy with <b>their</b> <b>lot</b> under his rule and who raised in his place Maximinus Thrax. However, just as he had been raised by the army, Maximinus was also brought down by them and despite winning the Battle of Carthage against the senate's newly proclaimed Gordian II, he too was murdered when it appeared to his forces as though he would not be able to best the next senatorial candidate for the throne, Gordian III.|$|E

25|$|By {{the fall}} of 1942, about 150 Jews from Norway had fled the country. The Jewish {{population}} in Norway had experienced some mistreatment specifically targeted at them, but the prevailing sense was that <b>their</b> <b>lot</b> {{was the same as}} all other Norwegians.|$|E
25|$|Walter and Ruth Younger, {{their son}} Travis, along with Walter's mother Lena (Mama) and Walter's sister Beneatha, {{live in poverty}} in a {{dilapidated}} two-bedroom apartment on Chicago's south side.

His plan is to invest in a liquor store in partnership with Willy and Bobo, street-smart acquaintances of Walter's.|$|E
5000|$|Late 1980's - Court receivership. Apparently {{related to}} a {{preceding}} period of [...] "several cycles of growth, recession, internal turmoil and stagnation.

25|$|The Warsangali clan {{within the}} British {{protectorate}} {{on the eastern}} coast who under their spirited leader Garaad Mahamud 'Ali Shire had now decided to throw in <b>their</b> <b>lot</b> with the Dervishes and in January 1908, fired on a British dhow as it was landing on their coast. This incident {{has led to a}} hostile exchange of letters with the consul at Berbera and it was evident that the Dervishes would soon be on the March again.|$|E
25|$|Most of Boston's Italian {{immigrants}} were southern Italians who had little money {{and could not}} speak English. They faced many hardships in the early years, including exploitation and discrimination. Contrary to popular myth, they did not improve <b>their</b> <b>lot</b> solely by working hard; they held protest rallies, organized labor unions, and were extremely active in the Democratic party. In addition, they were aided by local charitable organizations, mutual aid societies, and federal {{programs such as the}} Works Progress Administration and the G.I. Bill.|$|E
25|$|Their opponents {{probably}} {{had the support}} of people who had wanted to continue the war even after the defeat at Aegates Island. The Mercantile Class, whose interests were hurt by the war, and would be marginalized by the abandonment of overseas operations, also supported this faction. People disenfranchised by the ruin of the navy and disruption of trade might have thrown in <b>their</b> <b>lot</b> with this group and eventually Hasdrubal the Fair emerged as the leader. Hamilcar, furious that Sicily had been given up too soon, while he had been undefeated, could rely on support from this party.|$|E
50|$|The Legislature gave four lots on Lady Street to the Presbyterian and Episcopal congregations {{with the}} {{condition}} that they pay half their value to the Baptist and Methodist congregations to assist in construction of their churches.

50|$|Megargel was {{established}} {{as a result of}} the Gulf, Texas and Western Railroad extending services to Jacksboro and Seymour. The town {{was established}} in 1910. The community developed multiple businesses within three months because the purchasers of land who established businesses sixty days after acquiring <b>their</b> <b>lots</b> received discounts as an incentive to do so.|$|R
50|$|Much of {{the wild}} areas have been {{destroyed}} {{to make room for}} urban development. Housing developments have replaced native habitats with ornamental plants and lawns, pushing the wildland-urban interface further out.

25|$|Under AriarathesIV, Cappadocia {{came into}} {{relations}} with Rome, {{first as a}} foe espousing the cause of Antiochus the Great, then as an ally against Perseus of Macedon. The kings henceforward threw in <b>their</b> <b>lot</b> with the Republic as against the Seleucids, to whom they had been {{from time to time}} tributary. AriarathesV marched with the Roman proconsul Publius Licinius Crassus Dives Mucianus against Aristonicus, a claimant to the throne of Pergamon, and their forces were annihilated (130BC). The imbroglio which followed his death ultimately led to interference by the rising power of Pontus and the intrigues and wars which ended in the failure of the dynasty.|$|E
25|$|Ford's other {{publications}} range from microbial research and elucidating newly threatening infections to examining scientists' dissatisfaction with <b>their</b> <b>lot.</b> Other areas of his interests are {{the invention of}} a space microscope commissioned by Brunel University, {{to be used by}} European Space Agency , safety of the water supply and the rising incidence of head lice and , his discovery of new phenomena in blood coagulation, the excretory mechanisms of plants and investigations of the 'ingenuity' of living cells that alter our understanding of the living cell. Ford's proposal for biohazard legislation led to supportive articles in Nature and The Times and has led to the introduction of worldwide biohazard controls.|$|E
25|$|After the 1970s {{peripheral}} lot regulation {{increased and}} infrastructure in the periphery improved, driving land prices up. The poorest and the newcomers were now unable to purchase <b>their</b> <b>lot</b> and build their house, and {{were forced to}} look for a housing alternative. As a result, favelas and precarious tenements (cortiços) appeared. These housing types were often located closer {{to the center of the}} city: favelas could sprawl in any terrain that had not previously been utilized (often dangerous or unsanitary) and decaying or abandoned buildings for tenements were abundant inside the city. Favelas went back into the urban perimeter, occupying the small lots that had not yet been occupied by urbanization—alongside polluted rivers, railways, or between bridges.|$|E
5000|$|Cootamundra was {{incorporated}} as a township on 9 August 1861, {{and the first}} settlers bought <b>their</b> <b>lots</b> in early 1862. Like many other towns in the Riverina, it was originally populated by those attracted by the gold rush of the 1860s, but became a quiet yet prosperous agricultural community after the local deposits were exhausted.|$|R
50|$|There were {{numerous}} models available, {{but to make}} the homes look custom, the footprints were rotated on <b>their</b> <b>lots</b> and flipped {{with a minimum of}} 3 different roof lines available: folded plate roof lines, butterfly roofs, ranch, and dramatic overhangs. The homes also featured unique decorative block work and stone screens and were generally finished in sanded stucco.|$|R
50|$|The area burnt down in 1812; some howeowners rebuilt <b>their</b> <b>lots</b> in stone, {{while others}} could allow only wooden buildings. Vasily Pushkin, uncle of Alexander Pushkin, owned such single-story wooden house at 36, Staraya Basmannaya. The poet himself {{was born in}} nearby Malaya Pochtovaya Street (exact {{location}} of his birthplace remains disputed and was previously stated as either 40 or 57, Baumanskaya Street).|$|R
25|$|The {{wellspring of}} the {{principle}} of humanity is in the essence of social morality which {{can be summed up in}} a single sentence, Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them. This fundamental precept can be found, in almost identical form, in all the great religions, Brahminism, Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Islam, Judaism and Taoism. It is also the golden rule of the positivists, who do not commit themselves to any religion but only to the data of experience, in the name of reason alone. It is indeed not at all necessary to resort to affective or transcendental concepts to recognize the advantage for men to work together to improve <b>their</b> <b>lot..</b>|$|E
25|$|Hoffa began union {{organizational}} work at {{the grassroots}} level through his employment as a teenager with a grocery chain, a job which paid substandard wages and offered poor working conditions with minimal job security. The workers were displeased with this situation and tried to organize a union to better <b>their</b> <b>lot.</b> Although Hoffa was young, his bravery and approachability in this role impressed fellow workers, and he rose to a leadership position. By 1932, after defiantly refusing to work for an abusive shift foreman, who inspired Hoffa's long career of organizing workers, he left the grocery chain, in part because of his union activities, and Hoffa was then invited to become an organizer with the Local 299 of the Teamsters in Detroit.|$|E
25|$|The Library's famous Rose Main Reading Room (Room 315) is {{a majestic}} , with -high ceilings.

It is also equipped with computers providing access to library collections and the Internet as well as docking facilities for laptops. Readers study books brought to them from the library's closed stacks. There are special rooms named for notable authors and scholars, {{many of whom have}} done important research and writing at the Library. But the Library has always been about more than scholars; during the Great Depression, many members of the general public, out of work, used the Library to improve <b>their</b> <b>lot</b> in life, as they still do.|$|E
50|$|Two other {{properties}} that prevailed against eminent domain eventually did sell: Sabatini's restaurant received $2.1 {{million and a}} pawnshop sold for $1.6 million. <b>Their</b> <b>lots</b> became {{part of a large}} lawn flanking a taxi stand for Trump's casino. Coking remained in her house until 2010, when she moved to a retirement home in the San Francisco Bay Area near her daughter and grandchildren.|$|R
5000|$|The second colony, called [...] "Los Terrenitos" [...] (English: [...] "The Little Lands"), and {{established}} around 1913, {{was in the}} valley between the Verdugo and Sierra Madre Mountains, the current site of Tujunga.

25|$|Henry and Ellen Smith are {{a middle-aged}} married couple who have {{settled into a}} routine life {{in the suburbs of}} New York. Henry feels that the spice has gone out of their marriage, while Ellen is more content with <b>their</b> <b>lot</b> in life. When the couple comes into a {{financial}} windfall, Henry suggests that they take separate vacations. Reluctantly, Ellen agrees, and Henry departs to test the waters of New York City's nightlife. In the city, he meets up with Skeets, and the two go out on the town, eventually ending up pursuing Gloria Dawn and her friend Merle, Broadway dancers. After sitting at home and bemoaning her fate with her housekeeper, Whiffen, for a several days, eventually Ellen decides what is good for the goose is good for the gander, and she also departs to have some fun in New York.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, Harry B. Macklowe, the {{developer}} of the Metropolitan Tower, planned a large office tower {{that would have}} included not only his own site at the Metropolitan Tower, but also the restaurant's and the lot on which Carnegie Hall Tower was erected. There was an agreement with Carnegie Hall about <b>their</b> <b>lot,</b> but Stewart-Gordon, who owned the lot dividing the project, refused to sell. Macklowe also offered to buy the air rights only and to give room for her restaurant inside the new tower building, but Stewart-Gordon declined. No matter what she was offered, Stewart-Gordon refused to sell the lot. During the planning of the Carnegie Hall Tower at 152 W. 57th St., {{on the other side}} of the Russian Tea Room, again Stewart-Gordon declined to sell its site or its air rights. The result is the narrow twenty-foot gap, separating the Metropolitan and Carnegie Hall towers.|$|E
25|$|The {{rise of the}} {{minstrel}} show {{coincided with}} the growth of the abolitionist movement. Many Northerners were concerned for the oppressed blacks of the South, but most had no idea how these slaves lived day-to-day. Blackface performance had been inconsistent on this subject; some slaves were happy, others victims of a cruel and inhuman institution. However, in the 1850s minstrelsy became decidedly mean-spirited and pro-slavery as race replaced class as its main focus. Most minstrels projected a greatly romanticized and exaggerated image of black life with cheerful, simple slaves always ready to sing and dance and to please their masters. (Less frequently, the masters cruelly split up black lovers or sexually assaulted black women.) The lyrics and dialogue were generally racist, satiric, and largely white in origin. Songs about slaves yearning to return to their masters were plentiful. The message was clear: do not worry about the slaves; they are happy with <b>their</b> <b>lot</b> in life. Figures like the Northern dandy and the homesick ex-slave reinforced the idea that blacks did not belong, nor did they want to belong, in Northern society.|$|E

50|$|The city {{subsequently}} grew northward with settlers initially building Victorian {{homes on}} large estates. Property taxes increased with {{the demand for}} city services, and residents responded by subdividing and selling off <b>their</b> <b>lots,</b> increasing building density. Further development of Midtown continued through the 1940s when workers from Wichita’s burgeoning aviation industry moved into the neighborhood. By the 1960s, however, Midtown had entered a period of decline.|$|R
