50|$|In Western music, scale {{notes are}} often {{separated}} by equally <b>tempered</b> tones or <b>semitones,</b> creating 12 notes per octave. A scale uses {{a subset of}} these 12. There are other traditional tempered scale systems dividing the octave to equal intevals in other numbers than 12. Examples are 53 in the Middle East, and 72 in southern India.|$|R
5000|$|Like a decibel's {{relation}} to intensity, a cent is a ratio between two close frequencies. For the ratio to remain constant over the frequency spectrum, the frequency range encompassed by a cent must be {{proportional to the}} two frequencies. An equally <b>tempered</b> <b>semitone</b> (the interval between two adjacent piano keys) spans 100 cents by definition. An octave—two notes that have a frequency ratio of 2:1—spans twelve semitones and therefore 1200 cents. Since a frequency raised by one cent is simply multiplied by this constant cent value, and 1200 cents doubles a frequency, the ratio of frequencies one cent apart is precisely equal to 2 = , the 1200th root of 2, which is approximately [...]|$|E
50|$|In the 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries, when Turkish musicians {{switched}} from their traditional notation systems—which were not staff-based—to the European staff-based system, they refined the European accidental system {{so they could}} notate Turkish scales that use intervals smaller than a <b>tempered</b> <b>semitone.</b> There are several such systems, which vary {{as to how they}} divide the octave they presuppose or the graphical shape of the accidentals. The most widely used system (created by Rauf Yekta Bey) uses a system of four sharps (roughly +25 cents, +75 cents, +125 cents and +175 cents) and four flats (roughly −25 cents, −75 cents, −125 cents and −175 cents), none of which correspond to the tempered sharp and flat. They presuppose a Pythagorean division of the octave taking the Pythagorean comma (about an eighth of the tempered tone, actually closer to 24 cents, defined as the difference between seven octaves and 12 just-intonation fifths) as the basic interval. The Turkish systems have also been adopted by some Arab musicians.|$|E
5000|$|The savart {{is named}} after the French {{physicist}} and doctor Félix Savart (1791-1841) who advocated the earlier similar interval of the French acoustician Joseph Sauveur (1653-1716). Sauveur proposed the méride, eptaméride (or heptaméride), and decaméride. In English these are meride, heptameride, and decameride respectively. The octave is divided into 43 merides, the meride is divided into seven heptamerides, and the heptameride is divided into ten decamerides. There are thus 43 &times; 7 [...] 301 heptamerides in an octave. The attraction of this scheme to Sauveur was that log10(2) {{is very close to}} [...]301, and thus the number of heptamerides in a given ratio is found to a high degree of accuracy from simply its log times 1000. This is equivalent to assuming 1000 heptamerides in a decade rather than 301 in an octave, the same as Savart's definition. The unit was given the name savart sometime in the 20th century. [...] A disadvantage of this scheme is that there are not an exact number of heptamerides/savarts in an equal <b>tempered</b> <b>semitone.</b> For this reason Alexander Wood used a modified definition of the savart, with 300 savarts in an octave, and hence 25 savarts in a semitone.|$|E
5000|$|Greek music theoreticians such as Simon Karas {{continue}} {{up to the}} end of {{the twentieth}} century to regard the intonation nenano as [...] "exotic," [...] although they do not always agree, whether the echos plagios devteros intonation is hard or soft chromatic. Anonymous authors like the one of the 16th-century Papadike (EBE 899) maintained, that one of the minor tones in the tetrachord of nenano should be either smaller or larger than a <b>tempered</b> <b>semitone,</b> approaching the smallest interval of a third or a quarter of a tone. The banishment of instrumental musical practice and its theory from the tradition of Byzantine chant has made it very difficult to substantiate any such claims experimentally, and traditional singers use different intonations depending on their school. The only possible conclusions can be drawn indirectly and tentatively through comparisons with the tradition of Ottoman instrumental court music, which important church theoreticians such as the Kyrillos Marmarinos, Archbishop of Tinos considered a necessary complement to liturgical chant. However, Ottoman court music and its theory are also complex and diverging versions of modes exist according to different schools, ethnic traditions or theorists. There, one encounters various versions of the [...] "nenano" [...] tetrachord, both with a narrow and with a wider minor second either at the top or at the bottom, depending on the interval structure of the scale beyond the two ends of the tetrachord.|$|E
