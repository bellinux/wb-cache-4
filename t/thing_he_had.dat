There were only two Allied aircraft large enough: the British Avro Lancaster and the US Boeing B-29 Superfortress. The United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) wanted to use the B-29 if at all possible, even though it required substantial modification. Ramsey supervised the test drop program, which began at Dahlgren, Virginia, in August 1943, before moving to Muroc Dry Lake, California, in March 1944. Mock ups of Thin Man and Fat Man bombs were dropped and tracked by an SCR-584 ground based radar set of the kind that Ramsey had helped develop at the Radiation laboratory. Numerous problems were discovered with the bombs and the aircraft modifications, and corrected.|$|E

A writer for the New York Post noted that following his identification, Wright sat [...] "with a lurch which told better than anything else the cost in strength to him of the <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> done."

500|$|Naming the {{characters}} after {{members of his}} own family, Homer was named after Groening's father Homer Groening, who himself had been named after ancient Greek poet Homer. Very little else of Homer's character was based on him, and to prove that the meaning behind Homer's name was not significant, Groening later named his own son Homer. According to Groening, [...] "Homer originated with my goal to both amuse my real father, and just annoy him a little bit. My father was an athletic, creative, intelligent filmmaker and writer, and the only <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> in common with Homer was a love of donuts." [...] Although Groening has stated in several interviews that Homer was named after his father, he also claimed in several 1990 interviews that a character in the 1939 Nathanael West novel The Day of the Locust was the inspiration for naming Homer. Homer's middle initial [...] "J", which stands for [...] "Jay", is a [...] "tribute" [...] to animated characters such as Bullwinkle J. Moose and Rocket J. Squirrel from The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show, who got their middle initial from Jay Ward.|$|E
500|$|As Kesler was {{returning}} from injury, Vancouver placed centre Manny Malhotra {{on injured reserve}} (IR) {{for the remainder of}} the season. In regards to the move, Gillis stated he felt Malhotra was vulnerable to serious injury because of an eye injury he suffered in 2011. The decision was made despite Malhotra playing in 78 games in the 2011–12 season and nine games in 2013. Gillis further noted that he had reservation about him playing in the previous season, but wanted to give Malhotra a chance to adapt. After watching him play, Gillis did not see the types of changes that would not put him at a higher risk of injury. Upon placing Malhotra on IR, Gillis called it the hardest <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> done as a GM. NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly released a statement on the situation, saying [...] "the League is satisfied and has approved the team's and player's joint decision to discontinue the player's participation in NHL games at this time on the basis of the player’s current medical condition and the risk of injury that such condition poses." [...] The Canucks also announced that Malhotra would remain with the team in some capacity, but would not return to the ice including in the playoffs.|$|E

500|$|In 1910, {{when he was}} 62, the Los Angeles Police Department hired Wyatt {{and former}} Los Angeles detective Arthur Moore King at $10.00 per day to carry out various tasks [...] "outside the law" [...] such as {{retrieving}} criminals from Mexico, which he did very capably. This led to Wyatt's final armed confrontation. In October 1910, he was asked by former Los Angeles Police Commissioner H. L. Lewis to head up a posse to protect surveyors of the American Trona Company who were attempting to wrest control of mining claims for vast deposits of potash {{on the edge of}} Searles Lake held in receivership by the foreclosed California Trona Company. Wyatt and the group he guarded were regarded as claim jumpers and were confronted by armed representatives of the other company. King wrote, [...] "it was the nerviest <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> ever seen". With guns pulled, Wyatt came out of his tent with a Winchester rifle, firing a round at the feet of Federal Receiver Stafford W. Austin. [...] "Back off or I'll blow you apart, or my name is not Wyatt Earp". The owners summoned the U.S. marshal, who arrested Earp and 27 others, served them with a summons for contempt of court, and sent them home. Earp's actions did not resolve the dispute, which eventually escalated into the [...] "Potash Wars" [...] of the Mojave Desert.|$|E
500|$|In the 2015–16 season, Laich's {{offensive}} production rapidly declined, {{while his}} $4.5 million cap hit stuck out {{as one of}} the only adverse aspects of a league-leading Capitals squad. On February 27, 2016, the Capitals placed Laich on waivers for the purpose of sending him to the Hershey Bears of the AHL. The following day, {{on the eve of the}} trade deadline, Laich, along with Connor Carrick and a second round selection (Carl Grundström) in the 2016 draft, were traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs, his boyhood team, in exchange for Daniel Winnik and a fifth round pick (Beck Malenstyn) in the 2016 draft. The purpose of the trade was to give the Capitals salary cap relief to use toward younger core player contracts that needed re-signing the following off-season. Capitals GM Brian Maclellan called the trade, when asked, the hardest <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> done as General Manager of the team. [...] Laich had been the longest tenured active professional Washington-area athlete at the time of the trade, concluding his service of 12 years with the franchise. In what easily stands as the most emotional trade in Capitals history since Laich was dealt to Washington in a package for Peter Bondra, one journalist wrote [...] "It's ironic that money is what ultimately forced the Caps to move Laich. This is a guy who loves the game so much, he'd probably play for free." ...|$|E
500|$|Lamb {{described}} the incident for Dolan in far more detail. He {{said that on}} 25 June he had finished his woodworking job at 15:00, refused to work overtime (having put in 62 hours that week), then drunk six beers at home during the afternoon and gone to sleep at 21:00. He woke up soon after, he said, and loaded his uncle's shotgun, intending to kill himself. [...] "Next thing I knew," [...] he continued, [...] "I was on the street." [...] He told Dolan {{that he had seen}} people [...] "as if they were on television". He heard the sound of a gun being fired as if it were coming from far away, and remembered a voice that was not his own saying [...] "Put up your hands". He then remembered hearing the dim, far-off gun again, a vision of a terrified man standing before him, then yet another shot. He told Dolan he remembered crossing the street, seeing a girl's outline in a doorway and [...] "somehow" [...] shooting at her. Lamb then said he had fired at a passing car, and that [...] "everything seemed unreal." [...] He said that the next <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> memory of was confronting an elderly lady at a house nearby, suddenly thinking [...] "what the hell am I in here for" [...] and leaving. He concluded his account by saying that he had hailed a cab from the corner of Pillette and Tecumseh Road and gone back to his uncle's house.|$|E

500|$|Bathurst reprised {{the role}} in the Cold Feet series, which ran for five years from 1998 to 2003. He {{described}} the character of David as an [...] "emotional cripple", originally with little depth. The third series features an affair between David and a political activist played by Yasmin Bannerman. Bathurst appreciated the opportunity to bring some depth to a previously one-dimensional character, but was more impressed with the storylines {{that came out of}} the affair, rather than the affair itself: [...] "It was the deception, the guilt and the recrimination rather than the actual affair, which was neither interesting nor remarkable". Like other cast members, Bathurst was able to suggest storylines as the series went on; one episode features David celebrating his fortieth birthday and Bathurst suggested the character could get a Harley-Davidson motorbike. Granada paid for him to take motorcycle lessons and a test. On the day before taking his test, the filming of a scene where David takes off on his new bike was scheduled. Bathurst [...] "wobbled, missed the camera and crashed into the pavement", leading director Simon Delaney to exclaim it was the funniest <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> ever seen. In another episode, David buys a racehorse – ostensibly as a birthday present for his wife – in a plot born out of Bathurst's own love of horseracing. The role made him more widely recognisable and he often received prospective scripts that were [...] "obvious rewrites of the character". He turned them down, preferring to play a [...] "good person", which would be more interesting from a dramatic point of view.|$|E
500|$|In the 1971 Candidates matches, Fischer {{was set to}} {{play against}} Soviet {{grandmaster}} and concert pianist Mark Taimanov in the quarter-finals. [...] "Their match was to begin in May 1971 in Vancouver, Canada, on the beautiful campus of the University of British Columbia." [...] "Analysts and players alike predicted that Fischer would win the Candidates, but not without a struggle. Tal predicted that Fischer would win 5½–4½ against Taimanov." [...] " [...] saw himself as the firm favorite in the Taimanov match. He was not alone; the noncommunist press was of the same mind. Only Taimanov insisted that he could win, dismissing Fischer as a mere computer". Taimanov had reason to be confident. He was backed by the firm guidance of Botvinnik, who [...] "had thoroughly analysed Fischer's record and put together a 'dossier' on him", from {{when he was in}} talks to play Fischer in a match [...] "a couple of years earlier". After Fischer defeated Taimanov in the second game of the match, Taimanov asked Fischer how he managed {{to come up with the}} move 12. N1c3, to which Fischer replied [...] "that the idea was not his—he had come across it in the monograph by the Soviet master Alexander Nikitin in a footnote". Taimanov said of this: [...] "It is staggering that I, an expert on the Sicilian, should have missed this theoretically significant idea by my compatriot, while Fischer had uncovered it in a book in a foreign language!" [...] With the score at 4–0, in Fischer's favor, the fifth game adjournment was a sight to behold. Schonberg explains the scene:Taimanov came to Vancouver with two seconds, both grandmasters. Fischer was alone. He thought that the sight of Taimanov and his seconds was the funniest <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> ever seen. There Taimanov and his seconds would sit, six hands flying, pocket sets waving in the air, while variations were being spouted all over the place. And there sat Taimanov with a confused look on his face. Just before resuming play [...] the seconds were giving Taimanov some last-minute advice. When poor Taimanov entered the playing room and sat down to confront Fischer, his head was so full of conflicting continuations that he became rattled, left a Rook en prise and immediately resigned. Fischer beat Taimanov by the score of 6–0. [...] "The record books showed that the only comparable achievement to the 6–0 score against Taimanov was Wilhelm Steinitz's 7–0 win against Joseph Henry Blackburne in 1876 in an era of more primitive defensive technique." [...] "Who would have imagined that any challenger's match would ever have been decided by a perfect score, when the participants are all to be ranked among the strongest players in the world?" [...] "It is difficult to portray to non-chess players the magnitude of such a shutout. A typical result between well-matched players might be, say, six wins to four, with nine draws". Taimanov later recalled, [...] "When Grand Masters play, they see the logic of their opponent's moves. One's moves may be so powerful that the other may not be able to stop him, but the plan behind the moves will be clear. Not so with Fischer. His moves did not make sense..." ...|$|E
