40|$|This is {{the first}} part of a series of papers {{studying}} <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> double categories for which horizontal bicategory and object category are given.

We establish a formal framework within which <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> internalizations can be correctly formulated. Further, we introduce the condition of a double category being globularily generated. We prove that <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> internalizations for a decorated bicategory admits a solution if and only if it admits a globularily generated solution, and we prove that the condition of a double category being globularily generated is precisely the condition of a solution to <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> internalizations for a decorated bicategory being minimal. The study of the condition of a double category being globularily generated will thus be pivotal in our study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> internalizations.

However, Abeam and the 1st SAS represented his first attempt at inflating the apparent strength of Allied forces, a tactic he would use significantly over the rest of the war.
