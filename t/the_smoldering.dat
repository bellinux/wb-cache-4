25|$|As drought {{conditions}} continue, groundwater levels {{drop and}} this provides excellent conditions for fires to develop. With hot, dry weather and no moisture underground, trees lose moisture and become very flammable in dry conditions. This leads to wildfires which usually {{is the main}} impact of drought in the United Kingdom, with moorland vegetation such as heather badly affected as the peat bogs dry out. Also, these fires can continue, even when seemingly put out, as <b>the</b> <b>smoldering</b> peat re-ignites the dry vegetation. However, during severe droughts, many trees can burn, and people's lives can be at risk, as in the 1976 drought when a fire encroached on a hospital, and only a wind direction change saved the patients' lives. As embers can be transported easily, and if drought is severe enough, fires can start miles away from their original position as they are transported by wind and even dust devils. With these situations, roads are often closed to prevent loss of life and further damage. These fires also can destroy wildlife habitats, and this can also threaten wildlife.|$|E

Designed by electric power pioneer Frank J. Sprague, the trolley system opened its first line in 1888, and electric streetcar lines rapidly spread to other cities across the country. Sprague's system used an overhead wire and trolley pole to collect current, with electric motors on the car's trucks.

It is expected that the UIS will eventually replace the existing array of thermocouples as a non-intrusive technique without compromising data acquisition. Smoldering is defined as a non-flaming, self-sustaining, propagating, exothermic, surface reaction, deriving its principal heat from heterogeneous oxidation of <b>the</b> fuel. <b>Smolder</b> of cable insulation is of particular concern in the space program; to date there have been a few minor incidents of overheated and charred cables and electrical components reported on Space Shuttle flights.

The experiments are part of a project studying <b>the</b> transition from <b>smoldering</b> to flaming under conditions encountered in spacecraft facilities, i. e., microgravity, low velocity variable oxygen concentration flows. Because the microgravity experiments are planned for the International Space Station, the foam samples had to be limited in size for safety and launch mass reasons. The feasible sample size is too small for smolder to self propagate because of heat losses to the surroundings. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>smolder</b> propagation and <b>the</b> transition to flaming had to be assisted by reducing heat losses to the surroundings and increasing the oxygen concentration. The experiments are conducted with small parallelepiped samples vertically placed in a wind tunnel. Three of the sample lateral-sides are maintained at elevated temperature and the fourth side is exposed to an upward flow and a radiant flux. It is found that decreasing the flow velocity and increasing its oxygen concentration, and/or increasing the radiant flux enhances the transition to flaming, and reduces the time delay to transition. Limiting external conditions for the transition to flaming are reported for this experimental configuration. The results show that smolder propagation and transition to flaming can occur in relatively small fuel samples if the external conditions are appropriate.

[...] Support for centralizing the defense housing effort was also increasing, and resulted in the February 24, 1942 establishment of the National Housing Agency by Executive Order of the President. Those individuals sympathetic to centralization were not very supportive of experimental housing programs. Even prior to the formal outbreak of war, the entire defense housing program, under pressure from Congressional conservatives and industry officials, began to make a significant switch to private sector initiatives to get the defense housing job done. Supporters of this new direction strongly believed that private industry was far more efficient, and [...] "..could utilize a few lots here and a favorably located site there, wholly unsuitable for large-scale Government projects." [...] Congressional support of the private construction industry came in the legislative form of Title IV of the Lanham Act, passed in the Spring of 1941. This legislation provided 100% financing for speculative builders of housing for workers in defense areas. Obviously Title IV was meant to serve the same housing market as the mutual housing program. Evidence also suggests that the staff of the NHA was far more conservative than had been the staff of the FWA. This swing to the right was completed when 700 members of the consolidated staff were laid off; many of those leaving were among the most progressive, and many programs, including the mutual housing program, were officially ended. This newly consolidated agency moved quickly to develop programs that were especially supportive of private initiative programs for solving the defense housing need, and generally supportive of Title IV. [...] Colonel Lawrence Westbrook noted in 1945 testimony that the NHA had destroyed the mutual housing program even at a time when requests for expansion of the program were pouring in from across the nation. Although news of the mutual housing concept had spread quickly through the labor union network, and many committees had been organized by workers to aid the implementation of the plan locally, all committees had to be told that the program was experimental in nature and no more staff could be made available to work with them.|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study has been}} carried out to investigate the effects of buoyancy on smoldering of polyurethane foam. The experiments are conducted with a high void fraction flexible polyurethane foam as fuel and air as oxidizer, in a geometry that approximately produces a one dimensional <b>smolder</b> propagation. <b>The</b> potential effect of buoyancy in the process is analyzed by comparing upward and downward smolder propagation through a series of normal gravity and variable gravity experiments. Both opposed and forward mixed (free and forced) flow smolder configurations are studied. In opposed <b>smolder</b> <b>the</b> oxidizer flow opposes <b>the</b> direction of <b>smolder</b> propagation, and in forward smolder both move in the same direction. Variable gravity free flow tests are also conducted in an aircraft flying a parabolic trajectories that provides low gravity periods of up to 25 sec. Measurements are performed of <b>the</b> <b>smolder</b> reaction propagation velocity and temperature {{as a function of the}} location in the sample interior, the foam and air initial temperature, the direction of propagation and the air flow velocity. This information is used in conjunction with previously developed smolder theoretical models to determine <b>the</b> <b>smolder</b> controlling mechanisms and the effect of gravity. Three zones in the fuel sample with clearly defined smolder characteristics are identified. A zone close to <b>the</b> igniter where <b>smolder</b> is affected by the external heat, a zone at the end of <b>the</b> sample where <b>smolder</b> is affected by the environment, and a zone at the end of <b>the</b> sample where <b>smolder</b> is affected by the environment, and a zone, in the middle of the foam, that is free from external effects. This last zone is the most characteristic of one dimensional, self-supported <b>smolder,</b> and <b>the</b> one that is studied in greater detail. In mixed flow convection buoyancy induced flows together with the forced flow are the primary mechanism of oxidizer transport to the reaction zone, while diffusion has a secondary importance. In natural convection, downward <b>smoldering</b> is of <b>the</b> opposed type while upward <b>smoldering</b> resembles more <b>the</b> forward type. For opposed flow smoldering, both natural and forced, <b>the</b> <b>smolder</b> propagation velocity is found to increase with the oxidizer mass flux reaching the reaction zone. This result confirms predictions from previously developed theoretical models that <b>the</b> <b>smolder</b> velocity is proportional to the oxygen mass flow. The experimental data is correlated in terms of a non-dimensional smolder velocity derived from these models, the results show very good agreement between theory and experiments for strong <b>smolder.</b> To implement <b>the</b> models, an analysis of the gas flow field is developed where the effect of significantly different permeabilities between char and foam is been Extinction is observed for very low and for very high flow rates, which shows that smolder is controlled by a sensitive competition between oxygen supply and heat losses to and from the reaction zone. Under these conditions the models do not describe the experiments well. <b>The</b> forward flow <b>smolder</b> experiments show that forward smoldering is controlled not only by the competition between oxygen supply and heat losses to and from the reaction zone but also by the competition between pyrolysis and oxidation. For low flow velocities a regime resembling the opposed flow is observed. As the air flow velocity is increased, foam pyrolysis followed by char oxidation is <b>the</b> controlling <b>smolder</b> mechanism. For both these conditions the theoretical models describe the experiments well. Increasing the flow velocity further results in a smolder propagation velocity controlled by total fuel consumption, in downward burining. For upward burning transition to flaming is observed for very high air flow velocities. This last regime is not well predicted by the theoretical models. The results from the experiments in variable gravity environment conducted in the KC- 135 A and Leajet airplanes confirm the normal gravity observations that the competition between heat losses and oxidizer transport is the major mechanism controlling <b>smolder.</b> <b>The</b> absence of convective flow in low gravity results in higher temperature in the unburnt fuel and char due to smaller heat losses to the surroundings. However, the oxidizer transport to the reaction zone also decreases and as a result the temperature at the reaction zone decreases indicating a weakening of the eaction, The presence of pyrolytic reactions in foward smolder and their capability to inhibit <b>smoldering</b> complicates <b>the</b> above described <b>smolder</b> mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|The {{transition}} from forward smoldering to flaming in polyurethane foam is observed using indepth thermocouples and ultrasound probing. The experiments are conducted with small parallelepiped samples vertically {{placed in an}} upward wind tunnel. Three of the vertical sample sides are maintained at elevated temperature and the fourth is exposed to an upward oxidizer flow and a radiant heat flux. An ultrasound probing technique is {{used to measure the}} line-of-sight average permeability of the sample at the same heights as <b>the</b> thermocouples. <b>The</b> <b>smolder</b> front propagation is tracked by both the thermocouples and ultrasound data, which show an increase in temperature and permeability upon passage of <b>the</b> <b>smolder</b> front. <b>The</b> permeability data also show that the transition to flaming is preceded by rapid fluctuations in permeability in the char region below <b>the</b> <b>smolder</b> front, indicating <b>the</b> formation of pores by secondary char oxidation. The pores provide locations for the onset of gas-phase ignition (i. e. transition to flaming). The results from all the tests indicate that the formation of pores is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the transition to flaming. Two novel measures of the intensity of the secondary char oxidation are introduced: the time derivative of permeability, and the secondary char oxidation velocity. The time derivative of permeability, which provides a measure of the pore formation rate, is found to increase as the oxygen concentration and/or radiant heat flux increase, and to indicate the likelihood of the transition to flaming. The permeability data offers a means to track the propagation of the secondary char oxidation, and to calculate the secondary char oxidation velocity, which is found to be strongly correlated to the transition to flaming. A simplified energy balance model is able to predict the dependence of the secondary char oxidation velocity on oxygen concentration and radiant heat flux...|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{have been}} {{conducted}} to study the controlling mechanisms involved in <b>the</b> transition from <b>smoldering</b> to flaming of a porous combustible material, flexible polyurethane foam, with an air flow forced across one of the porous-fuel surfaces. The experiments are performed in a small-scale, vertical, combustion wind tunnel, with the air flow forced upward and parallel to an exposed foam surface that forms one of {{the walls of the}} tunnel test section. Smolder is initiated {{at the bottom of the}} sample and propagates upward in the same direction as the forced and buoyancy-induced flows. <b>The</b> resulting <b>smolder</b> is therefore two-dimensional and forward. Thermocouple measurements of the foam interior, along with visual observations, when compared with schlieren interferometry images of the gas phase at the porous-fuel/air-flow interface, indicate that transition to flaming occurs inside the hot char region below <b>the</b> <b>smolder</b> front and not at the interface. An innovative ultrasonic imaging technique is employed to track the evolution of the char per-meability in real time, evincing that the char continues to react and increase substantially in permeability long after <b>the</b> primary <b>smolder</b> front has passed. The ongoing heterogeneous reactions in the char region result in the formation of large voids that provide locations for the onset of homogeneous gas-phase reactions. Furthermore, the higher permeability of the char favors the flow of oxidizer, as well as pyrolysis vapors produced by <b>the</b> primary <b>smolder</b> reaction, into <b>the</b> char interior, which, in conjunction with the reduced heat losses, leads to the onset of a homogeneous gas-phase ignition. This process results in the transition from slow smoldering to fast, exothermic, gas-phase reactions, which rapidly engulfs the entire fuel sample in flames...|$|R
