25|$|Later in 1972, Sammartino {{was asked}} back by McMahon Sr. {{to regain the}} title. After refusing McMahon's initial offer, Sammartino was offered a {{percentage}} of all the gates when he wrestled and a decreased work schedule that only included major arenas. Soon after, Sammartino and then champion Pedro Morales teamed up {{for a series of}} tag team matches. In a televised match, Professor Tanaka blinded both men with salt and they were maneuvered into fighting each other. When their eyes cleared, they kept fighting each other. Two weeks later, all syndicated wrestling shows in the WWWF showed a clip of Sammartino and Morales signing a contract for a title match at Shea Stadium. When McMahon gestured for them to shake hands, both wordlessly <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>away.</b> On September 1, 1972, Sammartino and Morales wrestled to a 65-minute draw at Shea Stadium in New York.|$|E

Lauria {{opened the car door}} to leave and noticed a man quickly approaching the car. Startled and angered by the man's sudden appearance, she said, [...] "Now what is this..." [...] The man produced a pistol from the paper bag that he carried and crouched. He braced one elbow on his knee, aimed his weapon with both hands, and fired. Lauria was struck by one bullet that killed her instantly. Valenti was shot in her thigh, and a third bullet missed both women. The shooter <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>away</b> quickly, without saying a word.|$|E

As Lenore looked she saw this man, suddenly becoming aware of Dorn's scrutiny, hastily <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>away.</b>|$|R
