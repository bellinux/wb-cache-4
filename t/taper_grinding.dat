40|$|Methods for {{accurate}} grinding of face-hobbed bevel gears {{have not been}} developed to date, the main obstacles being their epicycloidal lengthwise tooth curve and slot width <b>taper.</b> <b>Grinding</b> them while preserving their geometry would be desirable, as the epicycloidal tooth curve makes face-hobbed gears less sensitive to misalignments and deflections. To this end, we propose a method based on a flared-cup grinding wheel, whereby generated members are ground by a two-parameter enveloping process, while non-generated ones are finished by a one-parameter enveloping motion. Machine motions are synthesized exploiting the capabilities of 6 -axis hypoid generators. Interference between parts is avoided...|$|E

The plant had to outsource their partially machined shaft for tapper grinding for a certain rating of alternator. A small study was conducted for identifying is there any opportunity to do the operation within the plant. Next approach was {{to solve the problem}} with in the plant's available resource, with high quality and law cost. Machining time and labour cost was calculated. Finally the profit of the company for {{a certain period of time}} is calculated within the available data's. This attempt helped us to know about the production process of different rated alternators, working of different departments in the firm, problems faced by a company. This machine is used to produce external cylindrical surface. The surfaces may be straight, tapered, steps or profiled. Broadly there are three different types of cylindrical grinding machine as follows: 1. Plain centre type cylindrical grinder 2. Universal cylindrical surface grinder 3.

40|$|The {{nature of}} {{grinding}} burn in steels {{and its relation}} to workpiece temperature has been studied in surface grinding using a new experimental approach. First, a test method called <b>taper</b> <b>grinding</b> is developed for efficiently analyzing the effects of grinding process parameters. The method is applied to study forces, residual stress, hardness, temperatures, and the onset and evolution of burn. Second, by using nano-indentation on taper-sectioned ground surfaces, an accurate assessment has been made of the true hardness of ground surfaces. Hardness variations occurring over spatial extents of just a few microns have been resolved. The first occurrence of visible discoloration, i. e. onset of visible burn, on a ground surface is found to correlate with drastic changes in its hardness, residual stress and microstructure. Visible burn is seen to be associated with either a softening or a re-hardening of the surface. The microstructure of a re-hardened layer is found to resemble that of a white etching layer (WL), a characteristic microstructure of steels. Third, measurements of the workpiece temperature field have been made at high spatial and temporal resolution using a charge-coupled device (CCD) based infra-red (IR) imaging system. Various characteristics of the temperature field and their dependence on process parameters have been analyzed. It is shown that the onset of visible burn occurs at a fixed temperature for the steel. Predictions of workpiece temperatures, and efforts to compare them to measured temperature values, {{have been found to be}} influenced by uncertainty in the knowledge of the grinding geometry. ...|$|E
40|$|Bimetallic {{castings}} {{are widely}} used in the mining industries as construction material for crushers which have to perform high abrasive resistance at the outer side and excellent machinability at the inner side. To manufacture bimetallic casting goods cconsecutive centrifugal and gravity casting methods are commonly applied. Centrifugal and consecutive casting come up with geometrical constraints at the parting line of both materials. This research dealed with the manufacturing of <b>tapered</b> <b>grinding</b> roll by applying gravity casting method. The possibilities of casting the white cast iron outer ring in the preheated ductile cast iron of the inner ring were investigated. The inner ring was first heated up by casting liquid metal around the inner side, which prevented the inner ring from cracking due to rapid expansion during the casting process and to provide adequyate shrinkage of inner ring during solidification. After achieving the desired temperature of the inner ring, the liquid metal of white cast iron was then poured into the cavity to form the outer ring. The preheating temperature of the inner ring was mainly derived from the linear thermal expansion of both quasi isotrophic material and the diffusion at the parting line. This preheating temperature has to facilitate the formation of metallurgical bonding and avoid cracks due to the difference of shrinkage value between inner and outer ring. The preheating temperature {{was set up in}} the range of 500 °C - 1000 °C and the flushing time was fixed for 7 seconds. Studies on the microstructure of sample material have revealed a formation of metallurgical bonding at all of the preheating temperature. The width of the diffusion at the interface area varied between 291 µm at 500 oC preheating temperature, 301 µm at 625 oC, 834, 8 µm at 750 °C, 909, 1 µm at 875 °C and 1027, 7 µm at 1000 °C. By preheating temperature of higher than 750 °C fusion occured at the interface area between inner and outer material. This research concludes that the casting of bimetallic by applying gravity casting method can be done by preheating the inner ring to 625 oC, interface temperature of 1150 oC, flushing time of 7 seconds and pouring the white cast iron outer ring at the temperature of 1430 o...|$|R
50|$|One {{of the few}} {{surviving}} falchions (the Conyers falchion) {{is shaped}} {{very much like a}} large meat cleaver, or large bladed machete. This type is also illustrated in art (e.g. the Westminster Hall mural, shown to the right) The type seems to be confined to the 13th and 14th centuries. However apart from the profile they present a very thin blade, often only 1.2 mms thick spines 7 cms from the point with a full flat <b>grind</b> <b>tapering</b> to a very acute edge. Current theories are that they were the anti-cloth armour weapon of the day.|$|R
40|$|Cylpebs are {{slightly}} <b>tapered</b> cylindrical <b>grinding</b> media with {{a ratio of}} length to diameter of unity. The manufactures have made conflicting claims regarding the milling performance of Cylpebs in comparison with balls. One major point of interest is which one grinds finer at the same operating conditions. The difficulty in comparison {{is due to the}} shape difference. The two grinding media have different surface area, bulk density and contact mechanisms in grinding action. Comparative tests were conducted using the two types of grinding media in a laboratory Bond ball mill at various conditions of equality such as media mass, size distribution, surface area and input specific energy. The laboratory results indicate that at the same specific energy input level the Cylpebs produce a product with slightly less oversize due to their greater surface area, but essentially the same sizing at the fine end as that produced with the balls. The reason may be that the advantage of greater surface area is balanced by the line contact and area contact grinding actions with the Cylpebs. A new ball mill scale-up procedure [Man, Y. T., 2001. Model-based procedure for scale-up of wet, overflow ball mills, Part 1 : outline of the methodology. Minerals Engineering 14 (10), 1237 - 1246] was employed to predict grinding performance of an industrial mill from the laboratory test results. The predicted full scale operation was compared with the plant survey data. Some problems in the original scale-up procedures were identified. The scale-up procedure was therefore modified to allow the predicted ball mill performance to match the observed one. The calibrated scale-up procedure was used to predict the Cylpebs performance in the full scale industrial mill using the laboratory tests results. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|With annual global {{sales of}} {{approximately}} $ 5 billion [1], {{tapered roller bearing}} consumers increasingly valued energy efficient products [2]. Two of the world’s largest bearing producers, SKF [3] and Timken [4] promoted energy efficient bearings based on their abilities to grind rollers to reduced radial deviation from round (OOR). Bearing designers, however, {{did not know if}} roller geometries specified placed limitations on roller roundness. Testing under shop floor conditions at Timken, the researcher discovered a positive linear regression between roller nominal diameter and OOR. The basis for the regression was under geometric roller rounding conditions found to exist when through feed centreless <b>grinding</b> <b>tapered</b> rollers, synchronous regulating wheel vibrations transferred at higher amplitude to larger nominal diameter rollers. This research pointed energy efficient bearing design in a new direction. For example, tapered roller bearing designers typically specified rollers of minimum length to reduce problems associated with rolling contact. Bearings assembled from shorter rollers, to retain the same load capacity, required fewer rollers of larger nominal diameter. This research, however, found all things equal larger nominal diameter rollers suffered from increased OOR. Bearings designed to reduce power losses associated with rotational displacements benefited from employing more, smaller nominal diameter rollers...|$|R
40|$|We propose and {{demonstrate}} a reflective-distributed surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor {{based on the}} twin-core fiber. Firstly, we {{study the effects of}} the fiber dual <b>tapered</b> (DT) probe <b>grinding</b> angle on the SPR dynamic range. The results show that for larger grinding angles, the resonance wavelength increases, resulting in a higher testing sensitivity. By using this method, we can make the sensor operate in an optimal waveband. Secondly, {{on the basis of the}} results above, we grind the DT probe to be an asymmetric wedge shape to configure two grinding angles (6 &# 0176; and 17 &# 0176;) to realize the distributed sensing. Results show that, with the refractive index detecting a range of 1. 333 &# 8211; 1. 385, we can get two separated sensing zones, 591 &# 8211; 715 nm and 729 &# 8211; 966 nm, the testing sensitivity are 2385 nm/RIU and 4558 nm/RIU respectively. By using this method, we can detect multiple analytes in the same sensing area simultaneously, besides that we can also effectively compensate for the errors caused by background index interference, and the refractive index change resulting from the non-specific binding, or physical absorption and others. It worth to say that by using this method, we can adjust and control the resonance wavelength by changing the fiber grinding angle, while keeping the testing sensitivity is not reduced. For practical applications, this reflective distributed fiber-based sensor is much suitable for biochemical sensing, it has small size and can enter a small testing spaces (&# 0956;m scale). The diameter of the twin-core fiber is the only 125 &# 0956;m, which helps to be integrated into a micro-fluidic chip. In this paper, we integrate the fiber probe into an infusion needle to simulate blood vessels on-line monitoring...|$|R
