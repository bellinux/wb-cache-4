Existing communication systems face increasing difficulties in fulfilling these requirements. In particular, the efficient provision of reliable group communication services in ATM-Networks remains a major unresolved issue.

The first one, called RLMCP (Reliable Lightweight Multicast Protocol), is a simple and efficient adaptation layer protocol for the Service Specific <b>Convergence</b> <b>Sublayer</b> of AAL 5.

The framework permits to select the combination of error control mechanisms most suitable for the application requirements in a specific communication scenario. The achievable performance is analysed, identifying the influence of group size, cell loss rate and path capacity on throughput and delay. Guidelines are presented for selection of the error control scheme most appropriate for a specific communication scenario. ...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} issues {{emerging}} in satellite networks is the ecient and assured delivery of data. TCP/IP over ATM over poor quality links is known to fail catastrophically. The major source of this failure is that TCP incorrectly assumes all loss or corruption of data is due to network congestion, so TCP re-acts inappropriately. In general, two approaches can be consid-ered. In the rst approach, TCP distinguishes between conges-tion and non-congestion errors and handles the non-congestion errors properly. In the second approach, TCP is shielded from non-congestion errors, so that it doesn't invoke unnecessary con-gestion control mechanisms. In this paper, a Service Specic Coordination Function for Transparent Assured Delivery with AAL 5 (SSCF-TADA 5) is de-scribed. SSCF-TADA 5 operates to guarantee the transparent as-sured delivery of data in TCP/IP over ATM over degraded phys-ical link conditions such as those encountered on a satellite radio link, which is characterized by long propagation delay, high error rate with burst errors, and low throughput. Therefore, TCP is totally shielded from non-congestion errors resulting from poor physical link conditions. SSCF-TADA 5 coordinates between the user plane AAL 5 service interface and the Service Specic Con-nection Oriented Protocol (SSCOP), thereby forming a new Ser-vice Specic <b>Convergence</b> <b>Sublayer</b> (SSCS) supporting Classical IP over ATM. We discuss the design of SSCF-TADA 5, and then compare TCP/IP performance with and without SSCF-TADA 5. The results of the test show that assured delivery with SSCF-TADA 5 signicantlymitigates the degradation in the most severe cases, which combine high error rate with high channel utiliza-tion. ...|$|R

MPEG- 2) over ATM best effort services, such as Available Bit-Rate (ABR) and Unspecific Bit-Rate (UBR), efficient video-oriented control mechanisms for improving the video quality {{in the presence of}} loss have to be designed. In this thesis, we proposed and evaluated a new quality of service control framework for use with modified Unspecific Bit Rate service. We surveyed a number of issues related to the coding and control of MPEG- 2 video data streams transmitted over ATM networks, analyzed the network factors affecting the quality of service of real-time video applications and showed how this proposed video-oriented QoS control framework improve the performance for such services. The presented framework relies on four components: a dynamic frame-level priority data partition mechanism based on MPEG- 2 data structure and feedback from the network; an enhanced ATM Adaptation Layer type 5 (AAL- 5) associated with a new slice-based MPEG- 2 encapsulation strategy; a forward error correction (FEC) mechanism, which is implemented at the AAL- 5 service specific <b>convergence</b> <b>sublayer</b> to provide the error detection and recovery capability, and a video-oriented cell discarding scheme, which adaptively and selectively adjusts discard level according to switch buffer occupancy, video cell payload types and FEC drop tolerance. This best-effort video delivery framework is evaluated using simulation and real MPEG- 2 video data. The overall objective of this proposed framework is twofold. First, ensuring a graceful picture quality degradation by minimizing cell loss probability for critical video data while guaranteeing a bounded cell transfer delay. Second, optimizing the network effective throughput by reducing the transmission of non useful data. In comparison to previous approaches, the performance evaluation has shown a significant reduction of the bad throughput and minimization of losses of Intra- and Predictive-coded frames at the video slice layer...|$|R
