40|$|This paper {{examines}} voting {{by members}} of Congress on three <b>trade</b> <b>bills</b> introduced in 1993 and 1994 : the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the agreements concluded in the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations (GATT), and most-favored nation status for China. We first review recnet political economy models of trade policy and then presenting a brief legislative history of the three bills, use these models to formulate an empirical specification of political behavior. In our empirical tests, we find evidence that campaign contributions given be political action committees influenced legislators' votes on both the NAFTA and GATT bills. Contributions from labor groups were associated with votes against freer trade, while contributions from business groups were associated with votes in favor of freer trade. We also find that the broad policy views of the legislators, industry employment in each member's state or congressional district, and general economic conditions in the district or state affected voting on the <b>trade</b> <b>bills.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|We {{explore the}} effects of {{localized}} economic shocks from trade on roll-call behavior and electoral outcomes in the U. S. House, 1990 – 2010. We demonstrate that economic shocks from Chinese import competition—first studied by Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2013 a) —cause legis-lators {{to vote in the}} more protectionist direction on <b>trade</b> <b>bills</b> but cause no change in their voting on all other bills. At the same time, these shocks have no effect on the reelection rates of incumbents, the probability an incumbent faces a primary challenge, or the partisan control of the district. Though changes in economic conditions are likely to cause electoral turnover in many cases, incumbents exposed to negative economic shocks from trade appear able to fend off these effects in equilibrium by taking strategic positions on foreign-trade bills. In line with this view, we find that the effect on roll-call voting is strongest in districts where incumbents are most threatened, electorally. Taken together, these results paint a picture of responsive incumbents who tailor their roll-call positions on <b>trade</b> <b>bills</b> to the economic conditions in their districts...|$|E

40|$|We {{test whether}} fixed {{exchange}} rate regimes are ever credible in emerging markets by analyzing the behavior of short-term domestic <b>trade</b> <b>bills</b> across countries during the classical gold standard period, {{the most widely used}} hard peg in modern financial history. We exploit the fact that global capital markets were unfettered in order to identify the currency-risk component using uncovered interest parity for 17 of the largest emerging market borrowers for the period 1870 - 1913. We show that five years after a country joined the gold standard, the currency risk premium averaged at least 285 basis points for emerging market economies. We estimate that investors expected exchange rates to fall by roughly 28 percent even after emerging market borrowers joined the gold standard. Positive currency risk premiums that persisted long after gold standard adoption suggests that hard pegs for emerging market borrowers may never be fully credible. ...|$|E
40|$|The Panic of 1907 is an {{important}} episode in American financial history because it led, in part, {{to the creation of}} the Federal Reserve. Although much has been written about the crisis, little has been said about its underlying causes. This study identifies the San Francisco earthquake and its subsequent conflagration as the proximate cause of the panic. London fire-houses insured San Francisco during this period. The payment of claims by British insurance companies following the quake and fire produced a large capital outflow in the fall of 1906, forcing the Bank of England to nearly double interest rates and discriminate against US <b>trade</b> <b>bills.</b> These actions pushed the US into a recession and made markets vulnerable to shocks that otherwise would have been transitory in nature. World financial markets crashed in October 1907 with the collapse of the Knickerbocker Trust Company in New York. ...|$|E
40|$|In Germany, {{small firms}} are financed chiefly by small banks, which are grouped into two systems: the savings banks (Sparkassen) and the credit cooperatives. The {{government}} actively supports {{the financing of}} investments in small industry - especially business start-ups. The author explains how small firms are financed in Germany. The author contends that small and meduim-size firms contribute {{a lot to the}} German economy. Small firms are not subject to the control institutions - such as supervisory board seats, proxy voting and equity holdings - that shape the relationships between large firms and large banks. The author also points out that small banks, which are part of a decentralized market structure, over come imperfections in the financial market by building institutions that supersede the market mechanism. The savings bank and credit cooperatives systems have each developed an internal capital, not unlike those within large banks operating nationwide. Only central institutions participate in the domestic money market, to place the system's excess liquidity or to raise funds to cover the systems deficits. Also, the funding programs of the government banks {{can be seen as a}} refinancing mechanism that especially helps small banks.

40|$|The unwillingness of the US House of Representatives {{to renew}} {{fast-track}} authority in 1997 and 1998 means that further trade liberalization for the United States {{is likely to}} slow down or grind to a halt, since negotiators elsewhere know that any agreements reached could be modified by the US Congress. This political impasse raises several overarching questions: Does the status of fast track represent a temporary or a permanent setback in the postwar trend toward freer trade? Is it due simply to lax efforts in mobilizing groups that support trade liberalization, or is US trade policy becoming more protectionist? More generally, what {{were the most important}} economic and social factors shaping congressional voting on trade legislation in the 1990 s? How do these factors differ for the various <b>trade</b> <b>bills</b> Congress considered over this period? * Baldwin and Magee attempt to answer these questions by analyzing three key trade bills: NAFTA in 1993; the legislation implementing the Uruguay Round agreements in 1994; and the House bill seeking to renew fast-track authority in 1998. The authors provide a brief legislative history of each, and then outline a conceptual framework for their analysis. Focusing on district and state economic conditions, ideological leanings, and campaign contributions, they find both predictable and surprising relationships in the data. ...|$|E
40|$|In his Presidential Address to the Economic Society of South Africa (September 1981), Gerhard De Kock {{submitted}} that 'A shortcoming of past {{monetary policy}} in South Africa {{has been an}} inadequate recognition {{of the significance of}} financial markets, particularly such short-term markets as those for Treasury bills, short-term public-sector stock debt, bank acceptances, <b>trade</b> <b>bills</b> and call loans to discount houses. In analysing financial developments and in framing and applying monetary policy, the monetary authorities have perhaps devoted relatively too much attention to banking and other financial institutions and legislation, and relatively too little attention to developments in the various short-term financial markets' (De Kock, 1981, p. 327). In contradistinction, this study focuses directly on the determination of short-term interest rates in South Africa (SA), and abstracts where possible from the quagmire of institutional detail. Further, given the complexities inherent in any analysis of financial rates, we adopt the principle of Modigliani and Sutch (1966), of the need for a 'theoretically grounded and empirically tested understanding of the basic forces' (1966, p. 180) which tend to determine variations in short-term interest rates. Hence, although the subject lies in the realm of macroeconomic analysis, the micro-theoretic foundations of interest rate behaviour are considered. Accordingly, in line with current economic thought, emphasis is given to the formation of expectations by market participants, and to the related question of financial market efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Awokuse, Titus O. The {{increase}} in the number of organized interest groups and their lobbying activities in the United States (US) government in the past forty years have raised concerns regarding their implications for US public policy (CRS Report for Congress, 2006). This, coupled with the threat of foreign influence has led to the enactment of various laws, including the Foreign Agents Registration Acts, in order to maintain transparency in the US political system. In 1995, the Lobbying Disclosure Act was unanimously passed by the US congress to create a more effective and equitable system for administrating and enforcing disclosure requirements. Despite the efforts made by the Congress to avoid influence of interest groups in the policy making process, studies have shown that lobbying of organized interest groups does have a significant effect on policy outcomes, including trade policy. Influence of organized domestic groups have been reported by several analysts (Gawande and Bandyopadhyay 2000; Gawande and Hoekman 2006; Mitra et al., 2002) using the Grossman-Helpman (G-H) protection for sale modeling framework. The G-H approach assumes perfect competition and predicts cross-sectional differences in protection via three explanatory variables; namely the import elasticity, import penetration ratio and whether or not the industry is politically organized. In the last decade, this framework has been extended to incorporate foreign lobbying (Gawande et al, 2006), with significant evidence of foreign lobbying influence on US trade policy. However, a recent study which incorporates monopolistic competition into the G-H framework found that measuring the impact foreign lobbying without accounting for the presence of FTA is likely to overestimate the effect of foreign lobbying on Canadian trade policy (Stoyanov, 2009). Thus, a re-examination of the impact of foreign lobbying on US trade policy seems appropriate. Such an investigation using US data could provide additional policy insights since earlier studies did not account for the presence of preferential market access between trading partners. This study bridges a gap in the literature by re-examining the impact of foreign lobbying on US trade policy using the G-H model with monopolistic competition. The analysis focuses on congressional votes on foreign <b>trade</b> <b>bills</b> for the year 1997. Variables used in the model specification include level of protection (dependent variable), import elasticity, market shares and whether or not the industry is politically organized. Import penetration and the dummy variable for political organization were estimated using instrumental variables because of potential endogeneity of these variables. Based on the empirical results from our analyses there is some empirical support for the monopolistic competition model of endogenous trade policy; the preferred specification with NTB coverage ratio as dependent variable gives results consistent with the predictions of the model. However, the result presents domestic firms as sole determinants of US trade policy. The results of this study further shows that, contrary to the predictions of the benchmark G-H model unorganized firms do enjoy some level of protection from the government. Thus, an investigation of endogenous trade policy without accounting for the imperfect market structure which exists in reality might be underestimating the effect of protection on unorganized domestic firms.
