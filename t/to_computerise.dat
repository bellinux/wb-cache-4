The ONS release data to The Data Archive on schedule which coincides with the public release dates. Main Topics : From June 1983 onwards data have been produced in ward-based aggregations. Postcode sector aggregations are for the entire period from October 1982 onwards. Earlier data from October 1982 to August 1985 are also aggregated to Employment Office areas. Data for both stocks and flows (those joining or leaving the claimant count in the month) are produced. From May 1999, data on age and duration for stocks relate only <b>to</b> <b>computerised</b> claims processed clerically (currently fewer than 1 % of claims). Prior to May 1999, age and duration data for stocks include clerically processed claims for only quarter months (January, April, July and October). Data are also produced relating to claimants under 18, students, married women, and for stocks only, claimants under 60 claiming for less than 4 weeks, claimants under 60 claiming for more than 4 weeks, claimants over 60 claiming for less than 4 weeks, and claimants over 60 claiming for more than 4 weeks. For flows these data relate only <b>to</b> <b>computerised</b> claims. For stocks, they relate to all claims up to April 1999, and <b>to</b> <b>computerised</b> claims for May 1999 onwards. For datasets up to April 1999, data are produced relating to claimants whose employment is temporarily stopped - these data are discontinued from May 1999 onwards. <br...|$|R

When the government moved <b>to</b> <b>computerise</b> identification cards, members of religious minorities, such as Bahá'ís, could not obtain identification documents.

5000|$|The NHS {{encountered}} {{significant problems}} with the information technology (IT) innovations accompanying the Blair reforms. The NHS's National Programme for IT (NPfIT), {{believed to be the}} largest IT project in the world, is running significantly behind schedule and above budget, with friction between the Government and the programme contractors. Originally budgeted at £2.3 billion, present estimates are £20-30 billion and rising. There has also been criticism of a lack of patient information security. The ability to deliver integrated high quality services will require care professionals to use sensitive medical data. This must be controlled and in the NPfIT model it is, sometimes too tightly to allow the best care to be delivered. One concern is that GPs and hospital doctors have given the project a lukewarm reception, citing a lack of consultation and complexity. Key [...] "front-end" [...] parts of the programme include Choose and Book, intended to assist patient choice of location for treatment, which has missed numerous deadlines for going [...] "live", substantially overrun its original budget, and is still (May 2006) available in only a few locations. The programme <b>to</b> <b>computerise</b> all NHS patient records is also experiencing great difficulties. Furthermore, there are unresolved financial and managerial issues on training NHS staff to introduce and maintain these systems once they are operative.|$|E
