Her personal best jump and the Russian national record is 2.07 metres, achieved on her 29th birthday at the Russian track and field championships of 2011. Her best indoors was achieved at the Hochsprung mit Musik meeting 2012 in Arnstadt with 2.06 m. She thereby improved her Russian indoor national record by two centimeters.

25|$|The 2001 season held {{significant}} career {{highs and}} lows for the athlete. She started the year by taking her third U.S. Indoor title in the long jump. She was chosen to compete at the 2001 IAAF World Indoor Championships in Lisbon, Portugal. Burrell gave the greatest performance of her career with a jump of 7.03m – her first time over the seven-meter mark. This was enough to win the gold medal some five centimeters ahead of the defending champion, Russian athlete Tatyana Kotova. The jump brought Burrell into the top <b>ten</b> long <b>jumpers</b> on the all-time indoor lists and made her the second best American indoors, behind Jackie Joyner-Kersee. She began preparing for the outdoor season, but suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury to her knee in April which ruled her out for the entire season. The injury effectively ended her career as she competed sparingly thereafter but never again won a national title.|$|R
2500|$|The {{results of}} Vlašić's final {{year as a}} junior showed further {{development}} as a high jumper. She set a new indoor best of 1.92m at the 2002 European Indoor Championships and was the favourite to win the 2002 World Juniors. She won the competition {{by a margin of}} nine centimetres, setting a new personal best of 1.96m and attempting the symbolic two metres height. She failed to pass the bar but remained pleased with her achievements: [...] "This was the first time I tried the 2-metre mark. That would have been a bonus. Today what matters is the gold. I am very happy I retained my world junior title". At the final major event of the season, the European Championships, she could not repeat her previous form and finished in fifth place.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to investigate for vertical jumping the relationships between muscle actions, movement pattern and jumping achievement. <b>Ten</b> skilled <b>jumpers</b> performed jumps with preparatory countermovement. Ground reaction forces and cinematographic data were recorded. In addition, myoelectric activity (EMG) was recorded from seven leg muscles. EMG-signals were rectified and low-pass filtered to obtain EMG-levels. The latter, which were assumed to reflect activation levels, rose to a plateau in the sequence m. semitendinosus, long head of m. biceps femoris, m. gluteus maximus, m. vastus medialis, m. rectus femoris, m. soleus, m. gastrocnemius. It was attempted to link the EMG-pattern to the purpose of the push-off, namely to maximize the effective energy (Ey) of the mass center of the body (MCB). The term Ey designates the sum of the potential energy of MCB and the kinetic energy due to the vertical velocity of MCB. One of the requirements for maximization of Ey is that the mono-articular extensor muscles release as much energy as possible before toe-off occurs. It is argued that this requirement can only be satisfied if the vertical velocity differences between the proximal and distal ends of body segments reach their peaks in a sequence. The sequence that is realized by the pattern of muscular activation is upper body, upper legs, lower legs, feet. Another important requirement is that the mechanical energy released by the muscles is optimally used. This requirement can be satisfied by transportation of energy via the biarticular m. rectus femoris and m. gastrocnemius...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] This study {{investigated}} the characteristics of postural control following postural disturbance in elite athletes. [Subjects] <b>Ten</b> elite ski <b>jumpers</b> and <b>ten</b> control subjects participated in this study. [Methods] Sub-jects were required to maintain balance without stepping following unexpected horizontal surface perturbation in a forward or backward direction. [Results] A lower and reproducible peak magnitude {{of the center of}} mass velocity was shown in the athlete group compared to the control group. Cross-correlation analyses showed longer time lags at the moment of peak correlation coefficient between trunk flexor and extensor muscle activities, and shorter time lags and higher correlations between ankle flexor and extensor muscle activities were shown in the athlete group than in the control group. [Conclusion] The elite ski jumpers showed superior balance performance following sur-face perturbations, more reciprocal patterns in agonist-antagonist pairs of proximal postural muscles, and more co-contraction patterns in distal postural muscles during automatic postural responses than control individuals. This strategy may be useful in sports requiring effective balance recovery in environments with a dynamically changing surface, as well as in rehabilitation...|$|R
