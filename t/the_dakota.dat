5|$|Treaties between European {{settlers}} and <b>the</b> <b>Dakota</b> and Ojibwe gradually forced the natives off their lands {{and on to}} smaller reservations. In 1861, residents of Mankato formed the Knights of the Forest, with a goal of eliminating all Indians from Minnesota. As conditions deteriorated for <b>the</b> <b>Dakota,</b> tensions rose, leading to <b>the</b> <b>Dakota</b> War of 1862. The result of the six-week war was the execution of 38 Dakota and the exile {{of most of the}} rest of <b>the</b> <b>Dakota</b> to the Crow Creek Reservation in Dakota Territory. As many as 800 white settlers died during the war.|$|E

5|$|Before European {{settlement}} of North America, Minnesota was populated by a subculture of Sioux called <b>the</b> <b>Dakota</b> people. As Europeans settled the east coast, Native Americans {{moved away from}} them causing migration of the Anishinaabe (also known as Ojibwe) and other Native Americans into the Minnesota area. The first Europeans in the area were French voyageur fur traders who arrived in the 17th century and began using the Grand Portage to access trapping and trading areas further inland. Late that century, Anishinaabe migrated westward to Minnesota, causing tensions with <b>the</b> <b>Dakota</b> people. Explorers such as Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut, Father Louis Hennepin, Jonathan Carver, Henry Schoolcraft, and Joseph Nicollet mapped out the state.|$|E
