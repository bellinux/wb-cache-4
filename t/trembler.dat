5|$|In 1898, the British naturalist Henry Ogg Forbes {{described}} a second species of Necropsar, N. leguati, {{based on a}} skin in the World Museum Liverpool, specimen D.1792, which was labelled as coming from Madagascar. He suggested that this was actually the bird mentioned by Tafforet, instead of N. rodericanus from mainland Rodrigues. Walter Rothschild, however, believed the Liverpool specimen to be an albinistic specimen of a Necropsar species supposedly from Mauritius. In 1953, Japanese writer Masauji Hachisuka suggested that N. leguati was distinct enough to warrant its own genus, Orphanopsar. In a 2005 DNA analysis, the specimen was eventually identified as an albinistic specimen of the grey <b>trembler</b> (Cinclocerthia gutturalis) from Martinique.|$|E
25|$|The Benz Patent-Motorwagon and the Ford Model T used a <b>trembler</b> coil {{ignition}} system. A <b>trembler</b> coil was a battery-powered induction coil; the <b>trembler</b> interrupted the current through the coil and caused a quick series of sparks during each firing. The <b>trembler</b> coil would be energized at an appropriate {{point in the}} engine cycle. In the Model T, the four-cylinder engine had a <b>trembler</b> coil for each cylinder; a commutator (timer case) delivered power to the <b>trembler</b> coils. The Model T would be started on battery but then switched to an alternator.|$|E
25|$|The {{ignition}} system {{used in the}} Model T was an unusual <b>trembler</b> coil system to drive the spark plugs, as used for stationary gas engines, rather than the expensive magnetos that were used on other cars. This ignition also made the Model T more flexible as to the quality or type of fuel it used. The need for a starting battery and also Ford's use of an unusual AC alternator located inside the flywheel housing encouraged the adoption of electric lighting (standard fitment as of 1915), rather than oil or acetylene lamps, but it also delayed the adoption of electric starting, which was not offered until 1919. The Model T engine was produced for replacement needs, as well as stationary and marine applications until 1941, well after production of the Model T had ended. It was also utilized in the drivetrain of the Fordson tractor, which was produced in the US until 1928, and in Ireland until 1964.|$|E

500|$|Tremella mesenterica (common names include yellow brain, golden jelly fungus, yellow <b>trembler,</b> and witches' butter) is {{a common}} jelly fungus in the Tremellaceae family of the Agaricomycotina. It is most {{frequently}} found on dead but attached and on recently fallen branches, especially of angiosperms, as a parasite of wood decay fungi in the genus Peniophora. The gelatinous, orange-yellow fruit body of the fungus, which can grow up to [...] diameter, has a convoluted or lobed surface that is greasy or slimy when damp. It grows in crevices in bark, appearing during rainy weather. Within {{a few days after}} rain it dries into a thin film or shriveled mass capable of reviving after subsequent rain. This fungus occurs widely in deciduous and mixed forests and is widely distributed in temperate and tropical regions that include [...] Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, North and South America. Although considered bland and flavorless, the fungus is edible. Tremella mesenterica produces carbohydrates that are attracting research interest because of their various biological activities.|$|E

2500|$|The extinct Mascarene {{starlings}} are of uncertain relationships. Only {{one species}} is known from specimens taken while {{the bird was}} still extant; the other remains only known from subfossil bones and apparently one early traveller's description.

5000|$|<b>Tremblers</b> are a New World {{group of}} {{passerine}} birds related to mockingbirds and New World catbirds. Like these, {{they are in}} the Mimidae family. There are 2-4 species in one genus, Cinclocerthia: ...|$|R
5000|$|These do {{not form}} a clade but are a {{phenetic}} assemblage. It is rather likely than not — though {{by no means}} robustly supported — that the sage thrasher is a basal lineage among a group also consisting of mockingbirds and Toxostoma thrashers. The Caribbean thrashers occupy varying positions in an assemblage consisting of them, the <b>tremblers,</b> and the New World catbirds. Here, the white-breasted thrasher appears to be quite basal though {{it is impossible to}} place it anywhere with certainty, whereas the pearly-eyed thrasher is probably quite close to the <b>tremblers.</b> (Hunt et al. 2001, Barber et al. 2004) ...|$|R
50|$|The IBA was {{identified}} as such by BirdLife International because it supports, populations of bridled quail-doves, green-throated caribs, Antillean crested hummingbirds, scaly-breasted thrashers, pearly-eyed thrashers, brown <b>tremblers,</b> forest thrushes, Montserrat orioles and Lesser Antillean bullfinches.|$|R
2500|$|In {{this mode}} of operation, the coil would [...] "buzz" [...] continuously, {{producing}} a constant train of sparks. The entire apparatus {{was known as the}} 'Model T spark coil' (in contrast to the modern ignition coil which is only the actual coil component of the system). Long after the demise of the Model T as transportation they remained a popular self-contained source of high voltage for electrical home experimenters, appearing in articles in magazines such as Popular Mechanics and projects for school science fairs as late as the early 1960s. In the UK these devices were commonly known as <b>trembler</b> coils and were popular in cars pre-1910, and also in commercial vehicles with large engines until around 1925 to ease starting.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ignition}} system {{was similar to}} that of the Model T,with a flywheel-mounted low-tension magneto and <b>trembler</b> coils. The ignition timing was manually advanced or retarded with the spark advance lever mounted near the steering column, which rotated the timer. The cooling was by thermosiphon. (In later decades, a high-tension magneto and a water pump would be added.) The transmission was a three-speed spur gear (the three forward speeds ranged from approximately 2 to 6mph). A worm drive reduction set and a differential made up the rear. The design of the rear was patented for its ease of manufacture and service. Brakes were not provided on early Fordsons, as high-ratio worm sets generally transmitted rotation in one direction only, from the worm element to the gear element, because of the high power loss through friction. To stop the tractor, the driver depressed the clutch.|$|E
2500|$|The Model T (built {{into the}} flywheel) {{differed}} from modern implementations by not providing high voltage {{directly at the}} output; the maximum voltage produced was about 30 volts, and therefore also had to be run through the spark coil to provide high enough voltage for ignition, as described above, although the coil would not [...] "buzz" [...] continuously in this case, only going through one cycle per spark. In either case, the low voltage was switched to the appropriate spark plug by the [...] 'timer' [...] mounted {{on the front of}} the engine. This performed the equivalent function to the modern distributor, although by directing the low voltage, not the high voltage as for the distributor. The timing of the spark was adjustable by rotating this mechanism through a lever mounted on the steering column. As the precise timing of the spark depends on both the 'timer' and the <b>trembler</b> contacts within the coil, this is less consistent than the breaker points of the later distributor. However, for the low speed and the low compression of such early engines, this imprecise timing was acceptable.|$|E
