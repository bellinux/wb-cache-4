5|$|Wiggins and {{his mother}} were very close, and her 1983 Alzheimer's disease {{diagnosis}} {{may have contributed to}} his drug problems. He was devastated that she {{would not be able to}} enjoy his success in the major leagues. In the last few years of Wiggins' life, he enjoyed a closer relationship with his father, Albert, and he often took his children on visits to see <b>their</b> <b>grandfather.</b> Wiggins had a very difficult time with his father's death in May 1990.|$|E
5|$|As a {{constitutional}} monarch, his education was {{followed closely by}} the National Assembly, which demanded from Itanhaém progress reports concerning his studies. During this time, Pedro II was kept unaware of events occurring outside the palace, including political matters. News which did intrude upon the emperor and his sisters concerned deaths within their family. In December 1834, they learned of the early and unanticipated death of their father. A few months later <b>their</b> <b>grandfather</b> Francis II, who had shown great interest in his grandchildren, died (June 1835). These losses drew the emperor and his sisters closer together and strengthened their sense of family, {{despite the absence of}} their parents.|$|E
5|$|In October 1840, their {{paternal}} grandfather Kamanawa II requested his grandsons {{to visit}} him {{on the night before}} his execution for the murder of his wife Kamokuiki. The next morning the Cookes allowed ʻĪʻī to bring Kaliokalani and his brother Kalākaua to see Kamanawa for the last time. It is not know if their sister was also taken to see him. Later sources, especially in biographies of Kalākaua indicated that the boys witnessed the hanging of <b>their</b> <b>grandfather</b> at the gallows. Historian Helena G. Allen noted the indifference the Cookes' had toward the request and the traumatic experience it must have been for the boys.|$|E
60|$|The young labourers over a {{great part}} of the south and east, at least of England--though never so well off, for several generations, as they are now--are growing up thriftless, shiftless; inferior, it seems to me, to <b>their</b> <b>grandfathers</b> in everything, save that they can usually read and write, and <b>their</b> <b>grandfathers</b> could not; and that they wear smart cheap cloth clothes, instead of their grandfathers' smock-frocks.|$|R

5|$|The Duke of York {{converted}} to Roman Catholicism in 1668 or 1669, but Mary and Anne {{were brought up}} as Anglicans, pursuant to the command of Charles II. They were moved to their own establishment at Richmond Palace, where they were raised by their governess Lady Frances Villiers, with only occasional visits to see their parents at St James's or <b>their</b> <b>grandfather</b> Lord Clarendon at Twickenham. Mary's education, from private tutors, was largely restricted to music, dance, drawing, French, and religious instruction. Her mother died in 1671, and her father remarried in 1673, taking as his second wife Mary of Modena, a Catholic who was only four years older than Mary.|$|E
5|$|The area of low {{pressure}} preceding {{the development of}} Bertha produced rough surf and rip currents along the Florida coastline. In Perdido Key State Recreation Area, two children were swimming in an unguarded area when they swept away by the currents. <b>Their</b> <b>grandfather</b> attempted to rescue them, but drowned in the rough waters. Another family rescued the two children. The large circulation of Bertha produced light rainfall across Florida, with Pensacola and Destin reporting 2.75inches. Extreme southern portions of Alabama received over 3inches (75mm) of rain from the storm, while western Dauphin Island reported over 5inches (125mm).|$|E

Marge is upset that Homer would choose fishing over their marriage, which Homer fails to {{understand}} as he visualizes Marge {{turning into a}} catfish. Homer takes a walk instead of returning to bed. On the dock, he finds an abandoned fishing pole. The pole, with General Sherman on the line, yanks him off the pier into a small rowboat, and onto the lake. From their cabin window, Marge watches Homer battle General Sherman and gets frustrated. At home, Bart and Lisa's party has ended and {{the house is a}} total mess. Watching Grampa cry and fearing that he will get in trouble, they frantically clean up the house for him.|$|E

5|$|On 11 June 1874 the Victoria Rooms {{hosted a}} meeting to promote what was {{described}} as a College of Science and Literature for the West of England and South Wales, which became University College, Bristol, an educational institution which existed from 1876 to 1909. It was the predecessor institution to the University of Bristol, which gained a Royal Charter in 1909. The meeting was attended by the then President of the British Association and Sir William Thompson (later Lord Kelvin). This meeting {{has been described as a}} partial success, as it gained the support of Albert Fry and Lewis Fry, members of the influential Fry family (the Fry name being known for the chocolate business set up by <b>their</b> <b>grandfather</b> and developed by their father Joseph Storrs Fry). Lewis Fry was a Quaker, lawyer and later a Liberal and Unionist Member of Parliament from 1885–1892 and 1895-1890 for the constituency Bristol North. In 1898 the third congress of the British Association for the Advancement of Science was held at the rooms.|$|E
5|$|Several {{months after}} Belle's death, Aden and Nicole begin a relationship, which becomes {{strained}} when Nicole {{tells him that}} she loves him, but Aden does not return the sentiment. A repentant Aden pays Nicole more attention and {{they are able to}} get their romance back on track. Aden's brother Justin (Matthew Walker) is involved in a car accident, which causes short-term memory loss, but prompts him to admit that he too was abused by <b>their</b> <b>grandfather.</b> He regains his memory, and recalls that Larry was in the car {{at the time of the}} accident. He and Aden find their father dead. Convinced that the police will think Justin killed him, Aden decides that they should bury Larry. The police become suspicious nonetheless, and the two are arrested for murder, until a phone call made to Aden's phone from Larry confirms that he caused his own death by irresponsible driving. Justin convinces Aden to move to the city. When Nicole refuses to go with him, he leaves anyway.|$|E
5|$|The {{second and}} eldest {{surviving}} child of Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI and Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, Archduchess Maria Theresa was born {{early in the}} morning of 13May 1717, at the Hofburg Palace, Vienna, shortly after the death of her elder brother, Archduke Leopold, and was baptised on that same evening. The dowager empresses, her aunt Wilhelmine Amalia of Brunswick-Lüneburg and grandmother Eleonor Magdalene of the Palatinate-Neuburg, were her godmothers. Most descriptions of her baptism stress that the infant was carried ahead of her cousins, Maria Josepha and Maria Amalia, the daughters of Charles VI's elder brother and predecessor, Joseph I, before the eyes of their mother, Wilhelmine Amalia. It was clear that Maria Theresa would outrank them, even though <b>their</b> <b>grandfather,</b> Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I, had his sons sign the Mutual Pact of Succession, which gave precedence to the daughters of the elder brother. Her father was the only surviving male member of the House of Habsburg and hoped for a son who would prevent the extinction of his dynasty and succeed him. Thus, the birth of Maria Theresa was a great disappointment to him and the people of Vienna; Charles never managed to overcome this feeling.|$|E
