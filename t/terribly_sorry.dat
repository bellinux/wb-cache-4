Due to a failed weld, a steel cable snapped {{from a car}} being towed and hit the extra's car, damaging her skull. The extra, identified as Gabriela Cedillo, had to undergo brain surgery. The injury has left her permanently brain-damaged, paralyzed on her left side and her left eye stitched shut. Paramount admitted responsibility for the accident and covered all of Cedillo's medical costs. Nevertheless, Cedillo's family filed a lawsuit on October 5, citing seven counts of negligence against Paramount, and several other defendants (not including Bay), with total damages sought in excess of $350,000. Cedillo's attorney, Todd Smith, said, [...] "This was an attractive 24-year old girl who had dreams and aspirations involving acting, {{and this kind of}} injury may well have a serious impact on her dreams." [...] The filed complaint reads that [...] "Cedillo has endured and will in the future endure pain and suffering; has become disfigured and disabled; has suffered a loss of the enjoyment of a normal life; has been damaged in her capacity to earn a living; has incurred and will in the future incur expenses for medical services, all of which are permanent in nature." [...] In response to the suit, Paramount released the following statement: [...] "We are all <b>terribly</b> <b>sorry</b> that this accident occurred. Our thoughts, prayers and best wishes are with Gabriela, her family and loved ones. The production will continue to provide all the help we can to Gabriela and her family during this difficult time." [...] On May 2012, it was revealed that an $18 million settlement had been reached between Paramount and the Cedillo family.|$|E

At the time, Irish republicans were marking the 50th {{anniversary of the}} Easter Rising. Although the IRA was inactive, loyalists such as Paisley warned that {{it was about to}} be revived and launch another campaign against Northern Ireland.

Many of its members were also members of the UCDC and UPV, including UCDC secretary and UPV leader Noel Doherty. Paisley publicly thanked the UVF for taking part in a march on 7 April. In May and June, the UVF petrol bombed a number of Catholic homes, schools and businesses. It also shot dead two Catholic civilians as they walked home. These are sometimes seen as the first deaths of the Troubles. Following the killings, the UVF was outlawed and Paisley denied any knowledge of its activities.

2500|$|A Financial Times interviewer, Emily Stokes, {{wrote in}} 2013 that Silvers viewed editing as [...] "an instinct.

Stokes commented that Silvers [...] "radiates a genial warmth [...] {{it is part of}} the editor's role ... not to be swayed by friendships with authors but to let reviewers express their genuine views." [...] Silvers described some of the diplomatic aspects of the job: [...] "The act of reviewing can have a deep emotional effect. People get hurt and upset. You have to be aware of that, but you can't flinch. [...] sometimes. You say, 'No, I'm <b>terribly</b> <b>sorry,</b> I can't visualise that in the paper. I don't think it's adequate to the subject.'" [...] James Atlas wrote of a typical day for Silvers: [...] "In the late afternoon, he'd rush out to a lecture at the Council on Foreign Relations, show up at a dinner party, and then head back to the office to deal with the next breaking crisis." [...] His New York Times obituary noted: [...] "Silvers brought to [...] a self-effacing, almost priestly sense of devotion. ... loath to grant interviews. ... He arrived at the office early and left late, if at all, to the kind of heavyweight cocktail party that was, for him, a happy hunting ground for writers and ideas." ...|$|E

He {{was such}} a good fellow, such a sportsman, and, above all, so young, that one hated the thought that, laugh as he might, beneath his {{laughter}} there lay the pain of that awful memory. He seemed so happy, too. It was only in moments of confidence, in those heart-to-heart talks when men reveal their deeper feelings, that he ever gave a hint that all was not well with him. As, for example, when Ellerton, who is always in love with someone, backed him into a corner one evening and began to tell him the story of his latest affair, he had hardly begun when such a look of pain came over Wilton's face that he ceased instantly. He said afterwards that the sudden realization of the horrible break he was making hit him like a bullet, {{and the manner in which}} he turned the conversation practically without pausing from love to a discussion of the best method of getting out of the bunker at the seventh hole was, in the circumstances, a triumph of tact.|$|E

Because he is quite incapable (he recognizes this {{later on in the}} story and presumes his study stole his social life) and has almost finished his study (and thus has to hurry), he answers an ad of a marriage counselor.

The marriage counselor suddenly turns up delivering him photographs of women, which he initially ignores.

50|$|Pauline Frederick is {{credited}} with being the first female reporter to broadcast from China. After her war correspondence tour she ended her radio relationship with NBC but continued reporting for newspapers and ABC radio, covering the Nuremberg Trials. However, Frederick only reported “on the air once—when Hermann Göring took the stand and the first-string male reporter was busy doing something else”. Despite her respected work, journalism was still a male-dominated business, and Pauline {{was not one of}} the boys. She later remarked on a comment by a male industry executive that a women’s voice does not carry authority: “I am <b>terribly</b> <b>sorry</b> that I didn’t have courage enough in those days to tell him that I knew his wife’s voice carried plenty of authority in his house”. Frederick’s desire for a career as a news journalist remained strong even though she had been denied a job by NBC and CBS. She retained employment as an independent writer for ABC, furnishing them with articles that were considered women’s-interest pieces. While reporting for ABC, Frederick was asked to report on a women’s tutorial that was designed to teach women “How to Get a Husband” and that piece became some of her best-known work. She was later quoted as saying about the fluffy women’s article “I don’t think I learned anything from it, and I don’t think the audience did either”. In 1946, she accepted an assignment from ABC to travel to Uruguay to cover the presidential inauguration there. Later that year she landed an assignment to report on the final journey of the RMS Queen Mary as a troop ship; during the cruise she conducted an exclusive interview with General and Mrs. Dwight D. Eisenhower. Of her struggles throughout her career, she once remarked, “all news activities are about people and the ability to cover should not be judged by the sex of the reporter but by the reporting ability”.|$|E
5000|$|Jim Garlow has preached {{that instead}} of relying upon the {{government}} to provide medicine or medical care, the poor should look to God to provide medicine; if God does not provide medicine then the poor simply are undeserving. [...] On “Janet Mefferd Today” recently, right-wing pastor Jim Garlow suggested the government should stop assuming responsibility for providing “health and welfare” services so that churches can take over the social safety net and eliminate “freeloaders.” [...] Jim Garlow {{went on to explain}} that he has little patience, or even love, for the poor: [...] "He opined, “The fact to the matter is, I’m not proud of it and it’s not the best solution but it is what it is, our society today is based on a monetary economy. That means {{that if you want to}} acquire something, you have to pay for it. Like I said, it’s not the best solution but there’s no escaping it. And I’m <b>terribly</b> <b>sorry</b> to have to say this, but the fact that we have poor people even in this kind of society means something. It means that those people must not be worthy of the good life if God made them poor. And it’s the same with medications - if they deserved them, God would have given them the money for them through some mysterious way known only to Him.” “So, I’m sorry for all the poor people who are on welfare, who are struggling, who are suffering and who are not ashamed of taking half of our national budget to buy Mars bars and Evian bottled water,” the pastor said. “But at the end of the day, ask yourselves why you’re poor. Perhaps you have done something to deserve such a life, perhaps you’ve made mistakes. Bottom line - God doesn’t make mistakes and he sees everything. So, if you’re going through hardships and poverty and can’t afford medications, the man upstairs probably has a good reason for doing that.” ...|$|E
50|$|Set at the Ponkwasset Hotel in Boston, {{the first}} act begins with Bartlett and his friend Cummings having a {{conversation}} about Bartlett’s love life. Bartlett is depressed and {{has turned into a}} misanthrope because a girl he went on a date with was not interested in him anymore. As Bartlett is cursing all women and voicing his anger toward the entire female race, Cummings tries to cheer his friend up. He tells him the story of a girl who is still miserable about a break up that happened two years ago in hopes to prove to Bartlett that women do, indeed, have hearts. While they are speaking, General Wyatt, barges in yelling and cursing at Bartlett, ordering him to leave the hotel immediately. Then, when Constance and her mother enter the room, Constance faints at first sight of Bartlett. However, as General Wyatt approaches Bartlett he realizes that he has made the terrible mistake of yelling at a man he has never met before. Nevertheless, Bartlett is very upset and disturbed at the entire situation and storms out of the hotel. Cummings stays to speak with General Wyatt and realizes the general is <b>terribly</b> <b>sorry</b> for his earlier behavior. Once they are alone, General Wyatt tells Cummings the reason why he acted the way he did. Two years ago, Mrs. Wyatt brought Constance to Paris and Constance fell in love with an American man. However, when General Wyatt met the man he was very skeptical about him and soon found out that he was actually married. As a result of this unfortunate discovery, General Wyatt forced this man to end all relations with Constance, leaving her absolutely miserable and harboring a great deal of resentment towards her father, which has lasted for the past two years. Ironically, this was the same exact story that Cummings was telling Bartlett about just a few minutes ago. Although General Wyatt initially insisted that Bartlett leave the hotel premises to protect Constance, when Bartlett returns the general begs him to stay at Constance’s request. Despite some initial skepticism, Bartlett agrees to stay.|$|E

The set of states is States = ValVar where Var = fx; yg and Val = Z. We have just one predicate, so the set of abstract states States # = f 0; 1; g is the set of trivectors with one component. Therefore the abstract program will have just one variable v 1. Consider the assignment x: = x + 1. The corresponding abstract statement is v 1 : = H(cond 1; cond 0), where the func-tion H takes two boolean expressions (with free variable v 1) to a value in f 0; 1; g and can be expressed by a nested conditional H(cond 1; cond 0) = cond 1 ? 1 : cond 0 ? 0 :. We compute cond 1 and cond 0 by under-approximating the weakest precondition; cond 1 false becaus...|$|E

Ukie’s letter, your v-mail {{letter of the}} 14 th of Nov., and your air mail letter[s] of the 16 th and 17 th of November arrived {{as well as a}} Christmas package from Harold 2 ̆ 6 Alma and the cigarette lighter from Mort. This regular mail delivery is doing wonders for my morale even though it hasn’t suffered of late. That party for Sanford sounded darn cute. Gee, hon, I’m so <b>terribly</b> <b>sorry</b> that you didn’t feel so well that evening. Darling, I’ve asked you to mentioned [sic] the dates you receive my letters—merely to determine how long my letters take to reach you. You know, I’ve sent you the suede brush in the same package I mailed you the film. Some of the remarks in this letter may be rather disjoined [sic] since I am scanning your letters for queries, etc. Is it considered a privilege to join the Cleve. Assoc. for Nursery Education? Do join, ear, if you think that you’ll get anything which will benefit you professionally. As far as money, dear, don’t worry your pretty little head. I can’t spend money here for “love or money. ” I think we’ll be sitting pretty nicely by the time the war is over and I hope it’s over tomorrow. That little story of the “Jones Boys” is cute. All of the officers are getting a kick out of it. And as far as that article by Richard Harding—we said the same thing ever since we had the opportunity to visit San Antonio. Darling, I’m becoming quite a correspondent, if I have to say so myself. I’m right up to the minute on all my correspondence and have been averaging 6 to 7 letters per night. Sweets, if you were at my side, you’d be doing all the letter writing—you know it, don’t you? What I wouldn’t give to have you at my side—Oh, Boy! Just one hour of love!! Lt. Haygood[‘s], one of the battery officer’s [sic] wife is expecting a baby around Christmas. Gee, but he worries himself sick and is really “sweating it out. ” Watching him makes me glad that we didn’t plunge before I came over. The Rueben’s [sic] Xmas box arrived in excellent shape. It contained anchovies, salted pecan nuts, mints, gums, book, cheese spread, gum, candy 2 ̆ 6 canned frankfurters. Each item was individually wrapped in pieces of “P. M. ” paper. This makes the second time I received anchovies. The first came in Rosen’s [sic] package. I really and truly like them, too. Ukie’s picture is rather charming and does her proud. I’m sending out some G. I. Christmas cards if I can get to it. Say, sweets, how is your dieting coming along? I’m awaiting a report on latest developments. This evening we took pictures of our little cellar “den. ” If the pictures come out O. K. I’ll send you the negatives. There’s an awful lot of “rigarole” [sic] you’ve got to go through to get films printed. First you’ve got to send the roll of exposed film to a censor who develops the film 2 ̆ 6 censors it. Your negatives are returned and I’ve yet to learn where you get them printed. Are you adding any photos to the album? Why not? O. K., so you are. You know, I’d like to spend about 10 minutes with you in a “hollering session” followed by a love session (frustrated personality). I suppose you know I’m saving all your letters and {{hope to be able to}} read them to our kids when we gather around the fire for a family bull session. That will be fun, darling. Honestly, honey, I’m feeling swell and my morale is excellent. As soon as the censorship ban is lifted I’ll be able to tell you all about our outfit[‘]s contribution to history. Are you saving all the clippings about the 9 th Army[?] I want to put them in a scrap book. Goodnight, darling. It’s late and I must have my 10 hrs. sleep. I love you like mad and can’t wait to have you in my arms. Vic [Transcription ends...|$|E
40|$|Transcription begins] Thursday Night – 11 / 16 / 44 Dearest darling, This letter will {{probably}} be quite lengthy as I {{have a lot to}} tell you since I merely wrote you a V-mail last night. Boy, if all I wrote you was a V-mail, I must have been really sick. Well, truthfully, I was! I got the “curse” yesterday afternoon. I was through at work about 5 : 15 and I stopped and got Sanf’s birthday cake. It was really a very different looking cake, cause the trimming looked as if real roses surrounded the cake. I got to your folks’ house about 6 : 00. When Sanf got home, he was really and truly surprised and pleased with the cake. Gosh, it sounded almost as if he never had a cake on his birthday before. Then, of course, I gave him the ring, and dammit, it was too large and Sanf will have to send it back and have it made smaller. I don’t know how they “screwed me” up but they did. Well, anyhow, everyone was real excited about the ring (including Sanf), but I felt kind of funny, since ours was the only present there. Your Mom served: tomato juice, tuna fish salad, veg. soup, roast tongue and peas, and pineapple. Well, I didn’t say a word about anything, even though my diet doesn’t allow me to eat half the stuff she served. But to top it off I never heard of tuna fish and meat in the same meal. Still I ate and kept still. A couple of hours after dinner I started to feel sick, and by the time I got home, I was really ill and threw up everything I ate. Of course, I would never tell your folks, but that settles it—that is the last time I eat there. I told the folks about the incident with Sonia at Lindners, and Sanf and the folks admitted that that’s the way Sonia is. If you don’t make a “fuss” over her (which I didn’t) she doesn’t bother to speak to you. After dinner your Mom went to a shower for the Spitalany girl. Gosh, I’m glad I missed having all that “crap!” My folks came up after dinner and Sanf was really thrilled with the pajamas they bought him. Al P. and a friend of his came up and we all sat around and “gabbed. ” I had expected to stay until your Mom got back from the shower, but about 9 : 30 I began to feel so lousy, I knew I had to get home, so I left. I felt badly leaving, but I sure didn’t want to get sick at your house! Our social worker (connected with the nursery) and myself got into a talk yesterday after teachers’ meeting and I found out that her name is Holdstein, and she is a cousin (by marriage) to Bart. Bart had mentioned your name and she asked me if I was a relation. Bart is still not in the army. He has some kind of defense job! Teachers’ meeting yesterday was excellent, even though we didn’t delve into personalities! I like most of our staff—all except that Mrs. Cox—the old hag! The colored teacher we have is a honey and seems to be respected by everyone concerned! Had a letter from Kitty Speert yesterday—that is, besides your letter. Today, I heard from Rhoda Mensche—poor Rhoda—neither Mort or Sanf has written her! Enclosed find two articles I thought you would enjoy. Send me my suded [?} brush if you get the chance. I can’t seem to find a decent one—even to buy! Today Mom surprised me and bought me a beautiful tan, cashmere sweater, and darn, it is too small! I think she is too damn sweet to me! It rained, rained and rained all day today. The kids, of course, were more noisy than ever since they had no chance to run off their energy outside. Boy, they really seemed to get on my nerves today. However, the thing I love most about my work is how quickly the time passes. I want every day to fly by until I’m with you once more. Than [sic] time can stand still! According to a bulletin that came out on the 15 th—all nursery school teachers will get an “increase in living wage”—that is, a $ 10 raise each pay period (every 4 wks.) for 6 mos. If I see the am’t on my pay check, than [sic] I’ll believe it! Not another damn thing new! I adore you like mad. You know, darling, it seems like ages since I’ve seen you. I miss you so very much. Take care of yourself, sweetheart, and keep your pen moving! Ever yours, Edith P. S. Was asked to join the Cleve. Assoc. for Nursery Education—I had to fill out [a] card—then, I’ll know whether I can be an active or associate member. Also—was asked to one of their lectures Mon. nite., 11 / 20. Heard from Mont—he’s still around. THE JONES BOYS It seems there were two brothers by the name of Jones. The married one was John, the single one was Joe. Joe was the owner of a dilapidated old row boat. Strangely enough, on the day John’s wife died, Joe’s row boat filled with water and sank. A few days later a kindly old lady met Joe on the street and mistaking him for John said: “Oh, Mr. Jones, I was <b>terribly</b> <b>sorry</b> to hear of your great loss; you must feel terrible, I’m sure. ” “Well, I’m not a bit sorry,” replied Joe. She was a rotten old thing, unfit from the start. Her bottom was all chewed up. She smelled of old dead fish and the first time I got into her, she made water faster than anything I ever saw. She had a crack in her back and a hole in her front, and the hold kept getting bigger every time I used her. It got so I could hardly handle her at all; and when everyone else used her, she would leak like anything. But this is what finished her: Four guys from town came down looking for a good time. They asked me if I would rent her to them. I warned them what she was like, but they said that they didn’t care, {{that they would like to}} take a crack at her anyhow. The result was, the crazy fools all tried to get into her at once and it was too much for her—she cracked right in the middle. ” The kindly old lady fainted! Kitty sent this—I gave the other copy to Sanf! [Transcription ends...|$|E
