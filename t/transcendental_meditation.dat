5|$|In February 1968, the Beatles {{travelled}} to Rishikesh {{in northern}} India {{to attend an}} advanced <b>Transcendental</b> <b>Meditation</b> (TM) training session at the ashram of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Their visit {{was one of the}} band's most productive periods and received widespread media attention. The Beatles' interest in the Maharishi was led by George Harrison's commitment, and it changed Western attitudes about Indian spirituality and encouraged the study of <b>Transcendental</b> <b>Meditation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite {{smoking in}} some of his films, Eastwood is a lifelong non-smoker, has been {{conscious}} of his health and fitness since he was a teenager, and practices healthful eating and daily <b>Transcendental</b> <b>Meditation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gregorio {{learned the}} <b>Transcendental</b> <b>Meditation</b> {{technique}} after reading a Wall Street Journal article {{about it in}} 1971. He appeared with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, Clint Eastwood and others on an episode of the Merv Griffin show in 1975.|$|E
5|$|A {{positive}} capsule {{review in}} the Los Angeles Times noted that the authors use logic to point out transparencies in the assertions of <b>Transcendental</b> <b>Meditation.</b> John Horgan, in his book Rational Mysticism, questions Persinger's neutrality and says that in his book he treats religious beliefs and spiritual practices as mental illness.|$|E
5|$|A {{practitioner}} of <b>transcendental</b> <b>meditation</b> (TM) {{since the early}} seventies, Josephson became a visiting faculty member in 1975 of the Maharishi European Research University in the Netherlands, part of the TM movement. He also held visiting professorships at Wayne State University in 1983, the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore in 1984, and the University of Missouri-Rolla in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Early in his career, Rosenthal {{learned the}} <b>Transcendental</b> <b>Meditation</b> {{technique}} while in South Africa, {{but found that}} as a medical student and a medical resident he didn't have time to practice. Then 35 years later, after one of his patients had a dramatic improvement {{as a result of}} TM, he began practicing again and then began recommending it to his patients. In 2011, he published , which debuted at number seven on the New York Times' Best Sellers: Hardcover Advice, How-To And Miscellaneous list. Earlier that year, Rosenthal published preliminary research on the potential influence of TM on Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s Josephson took up <b>transcendental</b> <b>meditation</b> {{and turned his}} {{attention}} to issues outside the boundaries of mainstream science. He set up the Mind–Matter Unification Project at the Cavendish to explore the idea of intelligence in nature, the relationship between quantum mechanics and consciousness, and the synthesis of science and Eastern mysticism, broadly known as quantum mysticism. Those interests have led him to express support for topics such as parapsychology, water memory and cold fusion, and have made him a focus of criticism from fellow scientists.|$|E
5|$|Starr and {{his wife}} left on 1 March, after a ten-day stay; McCartney left after one month due to other commitments; Lennon and Harrison stayed about six weeks, then left {{abruptly}} following financial disagreements and rumours of inappropriate behaviour by the Maharishi. Harrison later apologised for {{the way that he}} and Lennon had treated the Maharishi, and he gave a benefit concert in 1992 for the Maharishi-associated Natural Law Party. In 2009, McCartney and Starr performed at a benefit concert for the David Lynch Foundation, which raises funds for the teaching of <b>Transcendental</b> <b>Meditation</b> to at-risk students.|$|E
5|$|TM and Cult Mania is a non-fiction {{book that}} {{examines}} assertions {{made by the}} <b>Transcendental</b> <b>Meditation</b> movement (TM). The book is authored by Michael Persinger, Normand Carrey and Lynn Suess and published in 1980 by Christopher Publishing House. Persinger is a neurophysiologist and has worked out of Laurentian University. He trained as a psychologist {{and focused on the}} impacts of religious experience. Carrey is a medical doctor who specialized in psychiatry. He focused his studies into child psychiatry with research at Dalhousie University, and has taught physicians in a psychiatry residency program in the field of family therapy. Suess assisted Persinger in researching effects of geological phenomena on unidentified flying object sightings in Washington; the two conducted similar research in Toronto and Ottawa.|$|E
5|$|George Harrison {{first met}} Joe Massot while the Beatles were filming Help! in early 1965. He agreed {{to write the}} musical score for Massot's film Wonderwall in October 1967, after the Bee Gees had become unavailable. It was Harrison's first formal music project outside the Beatles and coincided with his {{continued}} immersion in Indian classical music. Since 1966, this association with India had given Harrison a distinct musical identity beside the band's primary songwriters, John Lennon and Paul McCartney. While he had minimal interest in the Beatles' main projects during 1967 – the album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and their television film Magical Mystery Tour – Harrison led the group {{in terms of their}} shared philosophical direction, as his bandmates followed him in embracing <b>Transcendental</b> <b>Meditation</b> under the guidance of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the songs}} on the album were written during March and April 1968 at a <b>Transcendental</b> <b>Meditation</b> course in Rishikesh, India. The group {{returned}} to EMI Studios (now known as Abbey Road Studios) in May to commence recording sessions that lasted through to October. During these sessions, arguments broke out among the Beatles, and witnesses in the studio saw band members quarrel over creative differences. Another divisive element was the constant presence of John Lennon's new partner, Yoko Ono, whose attendance at the sessions broke with the Beatles' policy regarding wives and girlfriends. After a series of problems, including producer George Martin taking a sudden leave of absence and engineer Geoff Emerick quitting, Ringo Starr left the band briefly in August. The same tensions continued throughout the following year, leading to the eventual break-up of the Beatles in April 1970.|$|E
5|$|Cynthia {{attributed}} {{the start of}} the marriage breakdown to Lennon's use of LSD, and as a result, she felt that he slowly lost interest in her. When the group travelled by train to Bangor, Wales in 1967 for the Maharishi Yogi's <b>Transcendental</b> <b>Meditation</b> seminar, a policeman did not recognise her and stopped her from boarding. She later recalled how the incident seemed to symbolise the end of their marriage. After Cynthia arrived home at Kenwood, she found Lennon with Ono and left the house to stay with friends. Alexis Mardas later claimed to have slept with her that night, and a few weeks later he informed her that Lennon was seeking a divorce and custody of Julian on grounds of her adultery with him. After negotiations, Lennon capitulated and agreed to let her divorce him on the same grounds. The case was settled out of court in November 1968, with Lennon giving her £100,000 ($240,000 in US dollars at the time), a small annual payment and custody of Julian.|$|E
5|$|This decade also {{witnessed}} {{the emergence of}} a variety of new religious movements and newly established religions in the United States, creating a spiritual milieu from which the New Age drew upon; these included the San Francisco Zen Center, <b>Transcendental</b> <b>Meditation,</b> Soka Gakkai, the Inner Peace Movement, the Church of All Worlds, and the Church of Satan. Although there had been an established interest in Asian religious ideas in the U.S. from at least the eighteenth-century, many of these new developments were variants of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Sufism which had been imported to the West from Asia following the U.S. government's decision to rescind the Asian Exclusion Act in 1965. In 1962 the Esalen Institute was established in Big Sur, California. It was from Esalen and other similar personal growth centers which had developed links to humanistic psychology that the human potential movement emerged, which would also come to exert a strong influence on the New Age.|$|E

25|$|DLF funded <b>Transcendental</b> <b>Meditation</b> {{courses for}} {{students}} at the Lowell Whiteman Primary School in Boulder, Colorado in 2008. In 2009, Church and State magazine reported that the Americans United for the Separation of Church and State had characterized the David Lynch Foundation's funding of <b>Transcendental</b> <b>Meditation</b> for public school students as undermining the constitutional {{separation of church and}} state. In 2011, music mogul Russell Simmons announced plans to provide financial support to the David Lynch Foundation to teach TM at Hillhouse High School in New Haven, Connecticut. In 2009 the DLF provided $120,000 to fund a <b>Transcendental</b> <b>Meditation</b> Club at the Tucson Magnet High School in Arizona, U.S. which had offered TM courses to 160 students, staff, and faculty as of 2010.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, six {{public schools}} were each awarded $25,000 {{to begin a}} TM program {{and a total of}} twenty five public, private, and charter schools in the United States had offered <b>Transcendental</b> <b>Meditation</b> to their students. In 2006, the Terra Linda High School in San Rafael, California {{canceled}} plans for <b>Transcendental</b> <b>Meditation</b> classes due to concerns of parents that it would be promoting religion. In the San Francisco area there are three schools that offer the technique as part of their school program, funded primarily by the David Lynch Foundation. The Visitacion Valley Middle School began the program in 2007 and the Everett Middle School and John O’Connell High School began the program sometime after that. The Maharishi Institute, an African university, was founded in 2007 and uses the <b>Transcendental</b> <b>Meditation</b> technique in its programs.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Transcendental</b> <b>Meditation</b> {{technique}} {{is a specific}} form of mantra meditation developed by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. It {{is often referred to}} as <b>Transcendental</b> <b>Meditation</b> or simply, TM. The meditation practice involves the use of a mantra, and is practiced for 15–20 minutes twice per day, while sitting with closed eyes. It is reported to be one of the most widely practiced, and among the most widely researched, meditation techniques, with hundreds of studies published. The {{technique is}} made available worldwide by certified TM teachers in a seven step course and fees vary from country to country. Beginning in 1965, the <b>Transcendental</b> <b>Meditation</b> technique has been incorporated into selected schools, universities, corporations and prison programs in the U.S.A., Latin America, Europe, and India. In 1977, the TM technique and the Science of Creative Intelligence were deemed religious activities as taught in two New Jersey public schools. Subsequently the TM technique has received some governmental support.|$|E

25|$|Another common {{practice}} of SBNRs is mindfulness meditation, {{which is based}} on the writings of the Vietnamese Buddhist monk Thích Nhất Hạnh. The most successful Eastern-based meditation movement to be transported to and reformulated for a Western audience is <b>Transcendental</b> <b>Meditation.</b> Founded by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, <b>Transcendental</b> <b>Meditation</b> is based on a simplified form of yoga consisting of two fifteen- to twenty-minute periods daily where the practitioner is taught to sit comfortably, relax, and chant a one-syllable mantra. The purpose of this mantra is to help practitioners let go of their attachment to the external world and focus their spiritual energy inwards.|$|E
25|$|The Maharishi {{initiated}} {{thousands of}} people, then developed a TM teacher training {{program as a}} way to accelerate the rate of bringing the technique to more people. He also inaugurated a series of world tours which promoted <b>Transcendental</b> <b>Meditation.</b> These factors, coupled with endorsements by celebrities who practiced TM and claims that scientific research had validated the technique, helped to popularize TM in the 1960s and 1970s. By the late 2000s, TM had been taught to millions of individuals and the Maharishi was overseeing a large multinational movement. Despite organizational changes and the addition of advanced meditative techniques in the 1970s, the <b>Transcendental</b> <b>Meditation</b> technique has remained relatively unchanged.|$|E

25|$|The Maharishi {{believed}} {{that in order}} to maintain the continuity of <b>Transcendental</b> <b>Meditation</b> it had to be taught by trained teachers in dedicated centers.
