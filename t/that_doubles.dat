The origins of the dulcian are obscure, but by the mid-16th century it was available {{in as many as}} eight different sizes, from soprano to great bass. A full consort of dulcians was a rarity; its primary function seems to have been to provide the bass in the typical wind band of the time, either loud (shawms) or soft (recorders), indicating a remarkable ability to vary dynamics to suit the need. Otherwise, dulcian technique was rather primitive, with eight finger holes and two keys, indicating that it could play in {{only a limited number of}} key signatures.|$|E

The Village Voice editor Drew Hinshaw wrote that her and M.I.A.'s lyrical chemistry acts as a [...] "the real amorous game", calling it [...] "a fun duet, suggesting a two-girls-at-play theme <b>that</b> <b>doubles</b> in size". Alexis Petridis from The Guardian deemed it the best song from the album, praising M.I.A.'s [...] "incredible pop melody" [...] and [...] "off-kilter backing of squelching electronics and sub-bass" [...] and observed how her instrumentation [...] "has also uniquely managed to calm down Aguilera's usual attention-all-shipping vocal approach into something weirder: dead-eyed, thickly smeared with dubby echo".

[...] Lee DeVito of Metro Times called it [...] "a bit repetitive" [...] but said it is probably his favorite track on the album. Saeed Saeed of The National said he favored the album's version over its demo, and that, [...] "hankfully, Kanye West rescued it by throwing out the lameness and added the dark and claustrophobic sounds of his seminal 2013 album Yeezus". Bernard Zuel from The Sydney Morning Herald said it is [...] "colder and harder sounding, {{in the way of}} West's own recent work.

Melinda Newman of HitFix commented [...] "the soulful, exuberant, mid-tempo finger snapper, 'Love On Top' is deliciously sunny and sweet." [...] James Reed of The Boston Globe wrote that [...] "Love on Top' sounds like the pretty young thing of Michael Jackson's 'P.Y.T.' grew up to make a sequel to that 1983 hit." [...] Similarly, Joanne Dorken of MTV UK who described [...] "Love On Top" [...] as [...] "scream 'classic disco', catchy, [...] more uptempo and differing {{from the rest of}} the album", concluded that the song shows Beyoncé's versatility and that it is [...] "very Jackson 5". Ben Cardew of Music Week stated that [...] "Love On Top" [...] is summery and [...] "laidback, rather than massively immediate". However, he added that it proves to be a grower as it [...] "ratchets up the key changes on the final third", further writing that Beyoncé's voice sounds [...] "particularly impressive". A mixed review came from Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly, who compared Beyoncé's work on [...] "Love On Top" [...] to that of past idols such as Luther Vandross and Diana Ross, but felt the tone overshadowed her style, stating [...] "she gets lost in her idols' polyester-swathed shadows." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times noted that the song was [...] "slinky but nowhere near sexy" [...] adding that it sounds like a song young Brandy Norwood would release.|$|E
