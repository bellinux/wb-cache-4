Although this was publicly praised as an act of sportsmanship on Steinitz's part, Steinitz may have desperately needed the money.|$|E
25|$|The {{meaning of}} the factor of (σ2/2)τ is {{relatively}} subtle. For dminus& and m this corresponds {{to the difference between}} the median and mean (respectively) of geometric Brownian motion (the log-normal distribution), and is the same correction factor in Itō's lemma for geometric Brownian motion. The interpretation of d+, as used in Delta, is subtler, and can be interpreted most elegantly as change of numéraire. In more elementary terms, the probability that the option expires in <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> value of the underlying at exercise are not independent – the higher the price of the underlying, {{the more likely it is}} to expire in <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> higher the value at exercise, hence why Delta is higher than moneyness.|$|E

25|$|Anthropologist David Graeber {{has noted}} that, historically, the first wage labor {{contracts}} {{we know about}} – whether in ancient Greece or Rome, or in the Malay or Swahili city states in the Indian Ocean – were in fact contracts for the rental of chattel slaves (usually the owner would receive a share of <b>the</b> <b>money,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> slave, another, with which to maintain his or her living expenses.)

In August 2003, a jury found Zarinsky {{responsible}} for the death and awarded Bette Bernoskie $9,500,000 plus interest. In 2004, $154,000 was seized from Zarinsky's assets, and Bette Bernoskie divided this award among her legal representatives and her six children. In July 2007, a New Jersey Appellate Court reversed the decision and ordered the money returned to Zarinsky, citing his inability to put on a proper defense. Bette Bernoskie no longer had <b>the</b> <b>money,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> New Jersey Patrolmen's Benevolent Association then organized efforts to repay it. It was their intention that neither Bette Bernoskie nor her children would ever give back the award money.|$|E

Fortunately for Alexios IV, Phillip had good {{connections}} with the new leader of the Fourth Crusade, Boniface I of Montferrat (Theobald III, Count of Champagne had died in 1201). Therefore, when Alexios offered 500 Knights, 10,000 soldiers along with food and money to help the Crusaders with their drive to Egypt, Doge Dandolo and the other leaders of the Fourth Crusade happily accepted this new challenge. Both <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> troops were desperately needed by the Crusaders as they had neither in the quantities they required- especially to pay of the Venetian debt of 34,000 silver marks.

25|$|Funding of the Crown's {{operation}} in the provinces is split between the federal and provincial governments. As the viceroy is a federal appointee, the federal Crown pays in two parts—In Capital City Expenses and Out of Capital City Expenses—for some of the lieutenant governors' costs of office; his or her salary, which, like the governor general's, is fully taxed; and, through the Department of Canadian Heritage, a superannuation to retired lieutenant governors, though this money is actually garnished off of the individual's salary during his or her time in office. The provincial coffers supply the relevant lieutenant governor for other expenses of office, travel costs, and the upkeep of official residences, amongst other necessities. However, there is no uniform way in which each province distributes <b>the</b> <b>money,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> amounts will also vary, depending on the facilities available to the Queen's representative, how they are used, which departments support them, and how they expenditures {{are listed in the}} provincial estimates.|$|E

25|$|Many items {{have been}} used as {{commodity}} money such as naturally scarce precious metals, conch shells, barley, beads etc., as well as many other things that are thought of as having value. Commodity money value comes from the commodity out of which it is made. The commodity itself constitutes <b>the</b> <b>money,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> money is the commodity. Examples of commodities that {{have been used}} as mediums of exchange include gold, silver, copper, rice, Wampum, salt, peppercorns, large stones, decorated belts, shells, alcohol, cigarettes, cannabis, candy, etc. These items were sometimes used in a metric of perceived value in conjunction to one another, in various commodity valuation or price system economies. Use of commodity money is similar to barter, but a commodity money provides a simple and automatic unit of account for the commodity which is being used as money. Although some gold coins such as the Krugerrand are considered legal tender, there is no record of their face value {{on either side of the}} coin. The rationale for this is that emphasis is laid on their direct link to the prevailing value of their fine gold content.|$|E

500|$|A {{real estate}} boom {{occurred}} in the U.S. {{after the end of}} the First World War, with a particular surge in the construction of new skyscrapers between 1925 and 1931. In New York, a quarter of the financial district was rebuilt between 1928 and 1931, with [...] of new office space added between 1925 and 1929 alone. In Chicago, limited wartime construction created supply shortages, and rent levels rose in response by around 100 percent between 1919 and 1924. This level of potential profits encouraged an explosion of new building projects in the city. The boom inflated prices in the real estate market, leading to speculative financing and building projects, including the introduction of 100 percent mortgages for new builds.
