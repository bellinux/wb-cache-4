500|$|Wanting <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> {{represent}} {{life and}} death as an opposition, and instead to show {{the way in which}} each is inevitably and profoundly involved with the other, Kiarostami has devised a cinema that does more than just present the viewer with the documentable [...] "facts," [...] but neither is it simply a matter of artifice. Because [...] "existence" [...] means more than simply life, it is projective, containing an irreducibly fictive element, but in this [...] "being more than" [...] life, it is therefore contaminated by mortality. Nancy is giving an interpretation of Kiarostami's statement that lying {{is the only way to}} truth.|$|E
500|$|In 1990, Lundgren {{starred in}} Craig R. Baxley's sci-fi thriller I Come in Peace (also known as Dark Angel) {{opposite}} Brian Benben, Betsy Brantley, Matthias Hues and Jay Bilas. Lundgren plays Jack Caine, a tough Houston cop with an inner sensitivity, {{who does not}} let the rules of police procedure prevent him pursuing his mission {{to wipe out the}} White Boys, a gang of white collar drug dealers who killed his partner while he was waylaid stopping a convenience store robbery. Lundgren said of his role, [...] "What attracted me to Dark Angel is that I get <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> action. There's some romance, some comedy, some drama. I actually have some clever dialogue in this one. I get to act. One author said [...] "Universe (1987) or Dark Angel (1990), demonstrates that nature and his [...] hairdresser have suited him perfectly to Nazi genetically engineered baddie roles." ...|$|E
500|$|Chamberlain thanked his teammates. [...] "It wouldn't {{even have}} been close to {{possible}} without them. They wanted me to get it as much I did." [...] He added, [...] "They had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> give up open shots. They had to avoid fouls and pass me the ball in traffic." [...] Knicks' player Richie Guerin felt the Warriors broke a code of honor in sports by embarrassing an opponent and setting a record outside the normal flow of the game. Although effusive in his praise of Chamberlain, Guerin nonetheless estimated that if the game had played out normally, Chamberlain would have finished 15 to 20 points shy of 100. Chamberlain countered he could have scored 140 if the Knicks [...] "had played straight-up basketball." [...] New York coach Eddie Donovan suggested, [...] "The game was a farce. They would foul us and we would foul them." [...] The Knicks' Naulls stated, [...] "The game was not a fluke ... I thought it was absolutely authentic." [...] Imhoff said Zinkoff's announcements did not help the Knicks' cause.|$|E

500|$|Work on DJ Hero 2 started {{some months}} after the first game was completed, as the {{development}} team had endured heavy working hours to meet the release deadline. [...] FreeStyleGames' creative director Jamie Jackson said that DJ Hero 2 took about seven months to complete. While {{they were able to}} easily build on the existing framework for DJ Hero, FreeStyleGames wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> include new mixes, and sought to include additional features such as the Battle Mixes into the game. [...] Many of the game's new features are a result of feedback from players, including the game's social modes and improvements in the game's interface to provide a cleaner look and instantaneous visual feedback to the player. The team also worked at improving the game's graphics; the appearance of DJ Heros graffiti-based menus gave the impression of being a hip-hop game, but FreeStyleGames wanted to distance DJ Hero 2 from that. They also wanted to clean up the gameplay's interface, providing better feedback to the player and making it easily to tell when they were winning or losing. [...] While DJ Hero 2 does not use Kinect or PlayStation Move motion-sensing technology, Jackson had not ruled them out for a future iteration of the game.|$|E
500|$|From 1969 to 1976, Shearer was {{a member}} of The Credibility Gap, a radio comedy group that {{included}} David Lander, Richard Beebe and Michael McKean. The group consisted of [...] "a bunch of newsmen" [...] at KRLA 1110, [...] "the number two station" [...] in Los Angeles. They wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> straight news, so they hired comedians who were talented vocalists. Shearer heard about it from a friend so he brought over a tape to the station and nervously gave it to the receptionist. By the time he got home, there was a message on his answering machine asking, [...] "Can you come to work tomorrow?" [...] The group's radio show was canceled in 1970 by KRLA and in 1971 by KPPC-FM, so they started performing in various clubs and concert venues. While at KRLA, Shearer also interviewed Creedence Clearwater Revival for the Pop Chronicles music documentary. In 1973, Shearer appeared as Jim Houseafire on How Time Flys, an album by The Firesign Theatre's David Ossman. The Credibility Gap broke up 1976 when Lander and McKean left to perform in the sitcom Laverne & Shirley. Shearer started working with Albert Brooks, producing one of Brooks' albums and co-writing the film Real Life. Shearer also started writing for Martin Mull's television series Fernwood 2 Night. In the mid-1970s, he started working with Rob Reiner on a pilot for ABC. The show, which starred Christopher Guest, Tom Leopold and McKean, was not picked up.|$|E

2500|$|The pursuit course taught pilots tactics; acrobatics; {{and fancy}} formation, night, and {{cross-country}} flying. They became proficient in landing on small fields, aerial gunnery, individual combat, battle maneuvers, and bomb dropping. [...] Initially flying Curtiss Jennies for gunnery training, {{they were assigned}} to DH-4s and then to SE-5s. Training exposed them to Army paperwork and the duties of operations, armament, radio, engineering, supply, and mess officers. Running about six months, the course aimed <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> qualify men for the silver wings of the airplane pilot.

60|$|The Moors in Africa revolted, and Belisarius next went {{to subdue}} them. While he was there, the Goths in Italy began {{to recover from}} the blow he had given them, and chose a brave young man named Totila to be their king. In a very short time he had won back almost all Italy, for there really were hardly any men left, and even Justinian had only two small armies to dispose of, and those made up of Thracians and Isaurians from the shores of the Black Sea. One of these was sent with Belisarius to attack the Goths, but was not strong enough <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> hold Totila in check, and Justinian would not even send him all the help possible, because he dreaded the love the army bore to him. After four years of {{fighting}} with Totila he was recalled, and a slave named Narces, who had always lived in the women's apartment in the palace, was sent to take the command. He was really able and skilled, and being better supported, he gained a great victory near Rome, in which Totila was killed, and another near Naples, which quite overcame the Ostrogoths, so that they never became a power again. Italy was restored to the Empire, and was governed by an officer from Constantinople, who lived at Ravenna, and was called the Exarch.|$|E

60|$|Constance {{began to}} see how the whole woman, brought up to affluence, had been {{suddenly}} crushed by the change; and almost the more so for her husband's high and cheerful resolution, which had forced back her feelings into herself. Her powers had barely sufficed for the cares of her household and her numerous family, and her endurance had consisted in 'suffering, and being still.' No murmur had escaped, but only by force of silence. She had not weakened his energies by word or look of repining; but while his physical life was worn out by toil and hardship, her mental life had almost been extinguished in care, drudgery, and self-control; and all his sweetness, tenderness, and cheerfulness had not been able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> to enable her to hold out, without manifesting her suffering. Enid had been a very suitable name for her; though without a Geraint in any respect to blame for what she underwent, she had borne all in the same silent and almost hopeless spirit, and with the same unfailing calm temper: but outside her own house, she had never loved nor taken real interest in anything since the day she drove from the door of Vale Leston; she had merely forced herself to seem to do so, rather than disappoint her eager husband and children.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dear {{and more}} than dear Bishop,--It would be vain for me to write to you, if I pretended <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> express my heart's wish that I could say {{something}} of the doings and sufferings which now for years past we of course associate with your name, so as to encourage and support you in your present manifold distress. But (especially for reasons known only to myself) I must leave that altogether to Him who helps His own to do and suffer. One thing only I would say, that to us at our great distance {{it looks as if}} the sanguis martyrum were being to you as the semen Ecclesiae, and you know how such things were hailed in the time of St. Cyprian. May it please God before long to give you some visible earnest of this sure blessing! but I suppose that if it tarry, it may be the greater when it comes. Our troubles as a Church, though of a different kind, are not small. The great point with me is, lest, if in our anxiety to keep things together, we should be sinfully conniving at what is done against the faith, and so bringing a judgment upon ourselves. I do not for a moment think that by anything which has yet been done or permitted our being as a Church is compromised (though things look alarmingly as if it might be before long), but I fear that her well-being is more and more being damaged by our entire and conscious surrender of the disciplinary part of our trust, and that if we are apathetic in such things we may forfeit our charter. There is no doubt, I fear, that personal unbelief is spreading; but I trust that a deeper faith is spreading also; it is (at Oxford, e.g.) Pusey and Moberly, &c., against the Rationalists and other tempters. As to the question of the Bible being (not only containing) the Word, I had no scruples in signing that Declaration. One thought which helped me was, the use made in the New Testament of the Old, which is such as to show that we are not competent judges as to what passages convey deep moral or religious meanings or no. Another, that in every instance where one had the means of ascertaining, so far as I have known, the Bible difficulty has come right: therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that so it would be in all the rest, if we knew the right reading and the right interpretation of the words. And as to what are called the Divine and Human Elements, I have seemed to help myself with the thought that the Divine adoption (if so be) of the human words warrants their truthfulness, as a man's signature makes a letter his own; but whether this is relevant, I doubt. My wife and I are both on the sick list, and I must now only add that we never forget you.|$|E
