The two stowaway on a ship to the Citadel, though are uncovered and turned over to C-Sec once they arrive. Though they try to tell of the evidence they have found, they are ignored and told to leave the Citadel. Later, they are suddenly attacked by Jacobus, injuring Tali and mortally wounding Keenah. After being chased through the Citadel, Tali eventually traps Jacobus in an incinerator, killing him, though Keenah collapses and dies.|$|E
5|$|The EO-10 crew, {{launched}} aboard Soyuz TM-13 on 2 October 1991, was {{the last}} crew to launch from the USSR and continued the occupation of Mir through {{the fall of the}} Soviet Union. <b>The</b> <b>crew</b> <b>is</b> notable for having launched as Soviet citizens and returning to earth as Russians. The newly formed Russian Federal Space Agency (Roskosmos) was unable to finance the unlaunched Spektr and Priroda modules, instead putting them into storage and ending Mir's second expansion.|$|E

50|$|After {{spending}} {{a number of}} days alone on the tiny islet, <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>was</b> greeted by men from a village on a nearby island who arrived in canoes, having seen washed-up flotsam from <b>the</b> raft. <b>The</b> <b>crew</b> <b>were</b> taken back to the native village, where they were feted with traditional dances and other festivities.

Kirk informs Spock that Starfleet intelligence has discovered that the Romulans are attempting to use time travel and are sending more ships to investigate. Captain Kirk goes to sleep, and awakes as Ensign Kirk on the VSS ShiKahr, which appears to otherwise be the Enterprise. The Ensign is a drug addled ex-convict who has been on board for only a day.|$|E
5|$|Venturers are {{expected}} to know and live by the Venturing Oath and Venturing Code. They associate and work directly with adults as partners, but <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>is</b> led by elected youth officers who are given opportunities to learn and apply leadership skills. Venturers plan and participate in interdependent group experiences dependent on cooperation. An emphasis on high adventure provides opportunities for team-building and practical leadership applications. A series of awards provide opportunities for recognition and personal growth. Each award requires the Venturer to teach {{what they have learned}} to others returning the skill and knowledge back to the community and enabling the Venturer to master those skills.|$|E
5|$|Captain Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) {{continues}} to struggle in deciphering an encrypted Starfleet {{message that they}} previously obtained through the Hirogen relay system (""). Neelix (Ethan Phillips) returns to Voyager with a guest, Arturis (Ray Wise), who helped him obtain supplies. Arturis learns of the encoded message and offers to help decrypt it. He is successful, and finds that the message is from Starfleet Command, with a nearby set of coordinates where their means of getting back home can be found. Though the rest of <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>is</b> elated at this news, Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan) remains cautious, given that the Borg {{have never been able}} to assimilate Arturis' species. Voyager arrives at the provided coordinates to find an unmanned Starfleet vessel, the Dauntless, of unknown design. Aboard, they find the ship uses quantum slipstream technology, which will allow them to arrive back in the Alpha Quadrant within a few months.|$|E

5|$|Convinced of Barclay's claims, the Doctor {{prepares to}} destroy the ship when Chakotay (Robert Beltran) arrives and gives an {{alternative}} story: The Doctor is indeed the Voyager EMH, but his program is stuck in the malfunctioning holodeck. <b>The</b> <b>crew</b> <b>is</b> trying to extricate his program so he only needs to wait it out; if he destroys the ship as Barclay suggests, it will prematurely end {{the program and the}} Doctor will be lost. Even though Barclay introduces Kes (Jennifer Lien) as Zimmerman's wife, the Doctor finally opts to believe in his holographic existence. The simulation ends and the Doctor finds himself on the holodeck; Chakotay's story was true and the Doctor is safely returned to sickbay.|$|E
5|$|Shipping {{incidents}} {{resulting from}} the storm caused several deaths. A schooner carrying seven people sunk, killing all its occupants. A tug boat sank {{off the coast of}} Mobile, Alabama while towing a lumber barge; the fate of <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>is</b> unknown. A ship named the American SS Catopazi sank between Charleston, South Carolina and the northern coast of Cuba, with all 30 crew members lost. Near Daytona Beach, a vessel carrying 2,000 cases of liquor sank along with all six crewmen. The last incident, involving a yacht, occurred off the coast of Georgia. The ship sank near Savannah, Georgia with the 12 crew members drowning. The total loss of life at sea was at least 55. Shipping throughout the East Coast was crippled by the storm as vessels were forced to seek shelter at port.|$|E
5|$|Tennessee (Danny McBride) is {{the pilot}} of the Covenant and Maggie Faris' husband. During a space walk to repair the solar {{recharge}} sails of the Covenant, Tennessee inadvertently intercepts a signal from Shaw, which prompts the colonization mission to divert towards the signal's source. While {{the brunt of the}} crew embarks on an excursion {{to the surface of the}} Engineer home world, Tennessee pilots Covenant in high orbit. Due to an ionic storm, he is unable to have adequate communication with the expedition. To regain communications, Tennessee brings Covenant dangerously close to the storm, which allows Daniels to privately reveal to him that Maggie is dead. Tennessee pilots a cargo lander down to the surface of the planet and extracts Daniels, Lope and David impersonating Walter, assisting with killing an Alien in the process. Aboard Covenant, <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>is</b> alerted to an Alien stowaway, prompting Tennessee to work with Daniels to dispose of it. They lure it to the terraforming bay, where it is ejected into space. Tennessee subsequently returns to cryosleep before Daniels does.|$|E

5|$|As the {{expansion}} of the Schwarzwelt is threatening to destroy Earth, the United Nations send in multiple teams, led by Gore, to investigate and eradicate the phenomenon. During their attempt to enter the Schwarzwelt, all ships but the Red Sprite are destroyed. During their missions, <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>is</b> helped by Arthur, who gradually accumulates knowledge of the Schwarzwelt and develops a personality. During an early mission within the Schwarzwelt, Gore is killed. As the protagonist and members of the Red Sprite's crew explore the regions of the Schwarzwelt, they slowly uncover the truth behind its existence. In ancient times, humans were controlled by the forces of God. His rule over them was broken when the Mother Goddess Mem Aleph destroyed him, breaking his hold on Earth. Residing within the Schwarzwelt, Mem Aleph saw humans abusing Earth's environment and consequently corrupting her dimension. Determined to remove those humans responsible for the corruption and return the world to its ancient state, Mem Aleph unleashed the Schwarzwelt. The remaining forces of God, mainly represented by Mastema, intend to use the Schwarzwelt to spread their influence across the world, removing free will to create a united utopia. Key items are the Cosmic Eggs, objects created by Mem Aleph that can reshape the world when combined by the core of the Schwarzwelt.|$|E
5|$|Now infected, Wesley uses {{a digital}} sample of Captain Picard's voice to lure key {{engineering}} crew-members {{away from the}} engineering deck. He erects a force field around the area with his tractor beam device and assumes control of the ship. He allows one of the engineers, Mr. Shimoda (Benjamin W.S. Lum), who is acting in a childlike manner, into the force field. Mr. Shimoda manages to remove all of the isolinear chips from the engine control station and plays with them like toys. As the supergiant star collapses, a fragment is blown into a direct impact course with the two Federation ships, and without the chips in place, they cannot move out of its way. Chief Engineer Sarah MacDougal (Brooke Bundy) manages to disable Wesley's force field, and Data is sent to replace the chips. He reports {{that he will not}} have enough time. Wesley reverses the ship's tractor beam, repelling the Enterprise off the Tsiolkovsky, giving themselves the necessary additional seconds for Data to replace the chips enabling the ship {{to move out of the}} way. <b>The</b> <b>crew</b> <b>is</b> cured of the ailment, and Picard partially credits Wesley for helping to prevent a disaster.|$|E
5|$|Old Kazran is soon {{visited by}} {{holographic}} {{images of the}} ship's crew in the present. After observing the effects of Abigail's singing, <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>is</b> singing Christmas carols, the sound frequencies of which are helping to stabilise the ship but cannot prevent it from crashing. Amy appears to Kazran and implores his help, but he waves away the holograms. The Doctor appears, and Kazran surmises that he is there to show Kazran his future, {{but he could not}} care less if he dies old and alone; he reveals that Abigail had an incurable disease on entering cryostorage and will only have one more day to live. As he cannot decide which day that should be, Kazran chastises the Doctor for believing he could change his mind. Unbeknownst to Kazran, the Doctor has brought young Kazran with him; the realisation of how much his bitter future self now resembles his feared father causes a change of heart in Kazran (making his own memory of his future self the show's version of the ghost of Christmas yet to come), and he quickly agrees to release the controls to save the ship.|$|E

5|$|Rodimus, {{being given}} {{half of the}} Matrix, decides to lead {{a search for the}} fabled Knights of Cybertron in the hope that they can help restore order to Cybertron. Taking to the stars on board the ship called the Lost Light, Rodimus is joined by Ultra Magnus and Drift as his second-and-third-in-commands, Ratchet, Chromedome, Rewind, Swerve, Brainstorm, Rung, Whirl and a {{reformed}} Cyclonus, among several others. Following an unexpected quantum jump upon launch, the Lost Light is hurled off into the depths of space, where <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>is</b> joined by Skids and contends with a stowaway Sparkeater. A visit to Delphi by Ratchet to help cure a plague introduces the threat of the Decepticon Justice Division, who then feature in a Decepticon-dedicated story menacing a band of misfit Decepticons, and also brings the facility's surviving patients and staff onto the ship—including Fortress Maximus, whose post-traumatic stress causes him to snap and nearly kill Rung. Hoping to cure Rung's damaged brain, Rewind gathers a small group together to recount a shared story from their past about Orion Pax foiling a Senate plot to discredit the burgeoning Decepticon movement in the days of Functionism. Chromedome is manipulated by Drift into carrying out a plan laid out by Prowl: using his mnemosurgery skills to tap the memories and learn the secrets of mass-murdering Decepticon Overlord, secretly hidden on board the Lost Light. Unfortunately, Chromedome accidentally allows Overlord to escape, and Rewind has to sacrifice himself to jettison the monster from the ship before the section of the ship is blown up. Drift admits to responsibility for Overlord's actions, resulting in his exile, even though Rodimus later reveals he {{was a part of the}} plot as well. Ultra Magnus is also fatally wounded in the battle, but when his body disappears from the ship's Medibay, the crew track it to Luna 1, where they discover and foil a twisted plot by Chief Justice Tyrest to wipe out all those Transformers he sees as tainted by original sin.|$|E
