5|$|The {{construction}} of a von Neumann computer depended {{on the availability of}} a suitable memory device on which to store the program. During the Second World War researchers working on the problem of removing <b>the</b> <b>clutter</b> from radar signals had developed a form of delay line memory, the first practical application of which was the mercury delay line, developed by J. Presper Eckert. Radar transmitters send out regular brief pulses of radio energy, the reflections from which are displayed on a CRT screen. As operators are usually interested only in moving targets, it was desirable to filter out any distracting reflections from stationary objects. The filtering was achieved by comparing each received pulse with the previous pulse, and rejecting both if they were identical, leaving a signal containing only the images of any moving objects. To store each received pulse for later comparison it was passed through a transmission line, delaying it by exactly the time between transmitted pulses.|$|E

In response, Drew Curtis noted the following reasons for the redesign: [...] "Websites have to evolve over time. Otherwise {{you end up with}} a layout anachronism like the Drudge Report. The old design was put into place years ago, over time changes were nailed on to the design like loose shingles on a leaky roof.

500|$|By {{the late}} 1950s, however, antiaircraft surface-to-air {{missiles}} (SAMs) could threaten high-altitude aircraft, {{as demonstrated by}} the 1960 downing of Gary Powers' U-2. The USAF Strategic Air Command (SAC) was aware of these developments and had begun moving its bombers to low-level penetration even before the U-2 downing. This tactic greatly reduces radar detection distances through the use of terrain masking; using features of the terrain like hills and valleys, the line-of-sight from the radar to the bomber can be broken, rendering the radar (and human observers) incapable of seeing the target. Additionally, radars of the era were subject to [...] "clutter" [...] from stray returns from the ground and other objects, which meant a minimum angle existed above the horizon where they could detect a target. Bombers flying at low altitudes could remain under these angles simply by keeping their distance from the radar sites. This combination of effects made SAMs of the era ineffective against low-flying aircraft. The same effects also meant that low-flying aircraft were difficult to detect by higher-flying interceptors, since their radar systems could not readily pick out opposing aircraft against <b>the</b> <b>clutter</b> from ground reflections (lack of look-down/shoot-down capability).|$|E
500|$|At {{approximately}} 04:00, {{the whole}} formation {{had to change}} direction by 154degrees, a near complete reversal in direction, to stay within their training area. The frigates had to change direction first to maintain their protective positions ahead of Tafelberg on the new heading. President Krugers options were to turn 200 degrees to port, or 154degrees to starboard. While the latter turn was smaller and tactically sound, it was more dangerous as it involved turning towards the other two ships. Critically, the inexperienced officer of the watch (OOW) elected to turn to starboard, and initiated a turn with 10degrees of rudder rather than the standard 15degree turn. A 10degree turn had a larger radius and would take longer to execute than a 15degree turn, thereby allowing Tafelberg more time to close on the ship turning in front of her. Shortly after beginning the turn, an argument ensued between the OOW and the Principal Warfare Officer (PWO) over the proper amount of wheel to apply. About {{two-thirds of the way}} through the turn, the operations room lost radar contact with Tafelberg in <b>the</b> <b>clutter</b> because the high-definition navigation radar was broken and the ship was using the less-precise search radar. The OOW was unable to recover the situation, and Tafelbergs bow impacted President Kruger on her port side at 03:55. The impact tore a large hole in her side and killed 13 of the 15 men sleeping near the point of collision. The ship took on a large list and the captain ordered [...] "abandon ship" [...] at 04:32. The exercise was immediately terminated and the other ships present began rescue operations. More ships, both military and civilian, began arriving after dawn as did aircraft from the South African Air Force. A total of 177 crewmen of the 193 aboard were rescued.|$|E
