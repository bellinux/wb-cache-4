A principle of maximum entropy production is formulated for non-equilibrium statistical systems: close to a bifurcation, the stable branch is the one on which the system produces entropy at the greatest rate. In order to test this principle, the model is used to simulate convection and to simulate the relaxation to equilibrium of a fluid with a non-uniform initial heat distribution. The following results are found: Close to the bifurcation from conduction-domi-nated to mixing-dominated behaviour, a fluid in a gravitational field with non-uni-form heat distribution relaxes to equilibrium by the path that maximizes entropy production: the mixing-dominated path.

40|$|Producing a {{local control}} can {{significantly}} increase {{the variation in}} velocity of the flow surrounding rocks (large roughness elements) in a river, which is important as fish and invertebrates require variation in velocity in their habitat {{in order to survive}} and to breed. Thus the creation of a local control in a rehabilitated river will be useful for encouraging the formation of a natural habitat in that river. This report details research carried out on the velocity distribution around two protruding cylinders, representing large roughness elements, placed perpendicular to the flow in a laboratory flume. The research is conducted mainly by <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>computer</b> <b>modelling</b> in RiverFLO- 2 D, which is verified by laboratory experiments.

40|$|A low {{pressure}} nuclear thermal propulsion (LPNTP) system, which {{takes advantage of}} hydrogen dissociation/recombination, was proposed {{as a means of}} increasing engine specific impulse (Isp). The effect of hydrogen dissociation/recombination on LPNTP Isp is examined. A <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>computer</b> <b>model</b> was used to show that the optimum chamber pressure is approximately 100 psia (at a chamber temperature of 3, 000 K), with an Isp approximately 15 s higher than at 1, 000 psia. At high chamber temperatures and low chamber pressures, the increase in Isp is due to both lower average molecular weights caused by dissociation and added kinetic energy from monatomic hydrogen recombination. Monatomic hydrogen recombination increases the Isp more then hydrogen dissociation. Variations in the mole fraction of monatomic hydrogen are similar to variations in static pressure along the axial nozzle position. Most recombination occurs close to the nozzle throat. Practical variations in nozzle geometry have minimal impact on recombination. Other models which can simulate a wider range of nozzle designs should be used in the future. The uncertainty of the hydrogen kinetic reaction rates at high temperatures (approximately 3, 000 K) affects the accuracy of the analysis and should be verified with simple bench tests...|$|E

Modelling results predict that face-controlled strain fringes will grow around smooth core-objects and strain fringes with displacement-controlled and face-controlled fibres around core-objects with rough surfaces. The surface roughness of the core-object determines if fibres in the fringes track the opening trajectory, since fibres follow asperities {{on the surface of the}} core-object. Rotation of the core-object and the fringes with respect to an external reference frame and with respect to each other influences the geometry of the fibres.

40|$|A <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>computer</b> <b>model</b> is {{presented}} to study the development of microstructure and crystallographic texture in polycrystalline films growing on amorphous substrates, which often exhibit strong textures. In particular, the analysis focuses {{on the influence of}} growth parameters such as the crystal habit, the relative growth rate along different crystal directions, the nucleation density on the substrate surface and the substrate topography. The simulation explains the development of fiber and in-plane textures in polycrystalline films growing from randomly oriented nuclei. These textures result from a geometric selection of the orientation of crystals, mainly due to differences in growth rates along different crystal directions. The calculated distribution of crystal orientations and its evolution with time are in agreement with textures observed in films deposited under growth conditions, corresponding to zone 2 of the structure zone model. The growth of crystals composing of a polycrystalline film is mainly constrained by the growth of adjacent crystals and the geometry of the environment where crystal growth takes place.

40|$|The fed human stomach {{displays}} regular peristaltic contraction {{waves that}} {{originate in the}} proximal antrum and propagate to the pylorus. High-resolution concurrent manometry and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of the stomach suggest a primary function of antral contraction wave (ACW) activity unrelated to gastric emptying. Detailed evaluation is difficult, however, in vivo. Here we analyse the role of ACW activity on intragastric fluid motions, pressure, and mixing with computer simulation. A <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>computer</b> <b>model</b> of the stomach was developed with the 'lattice-Boltzmann' numerical method from the laws of physics, and stomach geometry modelled from MRI. Time changes in gastric volume were specified to match global physiological rates of nutrient liquid emptying. The simulations predicted two basic fluid motions: retrograde 'jets' through ACWs, and circulatory flow between ACWs, both of which contribute to mixing. A well-defined 'zone of mixing', confined to the antrum, {{was created by the}} ACWs, with mixing motions enhanced by multiple and narrower ACWs. The simulations also predicted contraction-induced peristaltic pressure waves in the distal antrum consistent with manometric measurements, but with a much lower pressure amplitude than manometric data, indicating that manometric pressure amplitudes reflect direct contact of the catheter with the gastric wall. We conclude that the ACWs are central to gastric mixing, and may also play an indirect role in gastric emptying through local alterations in common cavity pressure...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} an important role for the inward rectifier K+ current (I K 1) in stabilizing rotors responsible for ventricular tachycardia (VT) and fibrillation (VF). To test this hypothesis, we used a line of transgenic mice (TG) overexpressing Kir 2. 1 –green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein in a cardiac-specific manner. Optical mapping of the epicardial surface in ventricles showed that the Langendorff-perfused TG hearts were able to sustain stable VT/VF for 350 ± 1181 s {{at a very high}} dominant frequency (DF) of 44. 6 ± 4. 3 Hz. In contrast, tachyarrhythmias in wild-type hearts (WT) were short-lived (3 ± 9 s), and the DF was 26. 3 ± 5. 2 Hz. The stable, high frequency, reentrant activity in TG hearts slowed down, and eventually terminated in the presence of 10 µM Ba 2 +, suggesting an important role for I K 1. Moreover, by increasing I K 1 density in a <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>computer</b> <b>model</b> having realistic mouse ionic and action potential properties, a highly stable, fast rotor (≈ 45 Hz) could be induced. Simulations suggested that the TG hearts allowed such a fast and stable rotor because of both greater outward conductance at the core and shortened action potential duration in the core vicinity, as well as increased excitability, in part due to faster recovery of Na+ current. The latter resulted in a larger rate of increase in the local conduction velocity {{as a function of the}} distanc...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{theoretical}} models of cardiac electrical stimulation or defibrillation predict a complex spatial pattern of transmembrane potential (Vm) around a stimulating electrode, {{resulting from the}} formation of virtual electrodes of reversed polarity. The pattern of membrane polarization {{has been attributed to}} the anisotropic structure of the tissue. To verify such model predictions experimentally, an optical technique using a fluorescent voltage-sensitive dye was used to map the spatial distribution of Vm around a 150 -microns-radius extracellular unipolar electrode. An S 1 -S 2 stimulation protocol was used, and vm was measured during an S 2 pulse having an intensity equal to 10 x the cathodal diastolic threshold of excitation. The recordings were obtained on the endocardial surface of bullfrog atrium in directions parallel and perpendicular to the cardiac fibers. In the longitudinal fiber direction, the membrane depolarized for cathodal pulses (and hyperpolarized for anodal pulses) but only in a region within 445 +/- 112 microns (and 616 +/- 78 microns for anodal pulses) {{from the center of the}} electrode (n = 9). Outside this region, vm reversed polarity and reached a local maximum at 922 +/- 136 microns (and 988 +/- 117 microns for anodal pulses) (n = 9). Beyond this point vm decayed to zero over a distance of 1. 5 - 2 mm. In the transverse fiber direction, the membrane depolarized for cathodal pulses (and hyperpolarized for anodal pulses) at all distances from the electrode. The amplitude of the response decreased with distance from the electrode with an exponential decay constant of 343 +/- 110 microns for cathodal pulses and 253 +/- 91 microns for anodal pulses (n = 7).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{compared the}} ability of a one-dimensional computer model and a <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>computer</b> <b>model</b> to model water flow over a flood plain. It used observed data from 1986 and 1994 flood events on the 50 km 2 Waihao River Flood Plain. The observed data was collected by a survey of the flood plain residents. The data was generally given at buildings and other easily remembered locations and also from photographs and videos of the flood event. The photographs verified the flood levels given by the residents and provided more flood levels. The Canterbury Regional Council also provided a map of the areas flooded from these floods. Further data from the Canterbury Regional Council on river discharges, stopbank overtopping and breaching was analysed to give flows onto the flood plain. The details of the Waihao River Flood Plain topography were stored in a Digital Terrain Model in a computer package called ARC/INFO. The details of the flood plain flow resistances of the flood plain using Mannings ‘n’ values were digitised into ARC/INFO. This information was imported into the computer models using software designed for this purpose. The dissertation used the Danish Hydraulic Institute MIKE 11 computer model for the onedimensional analysis and for the two-dimensional analysis a computer program under development by C. Beffa of Switzerland. The results showed that the two-dimensional model gave results with less standard error than the one-dimensional model. A calibration to obtain the best fit to the surveyed flooded area was undertaken with the two-dimensional model showed that in this case the observed flood levels were underpredicted. The results showed that for the two-dimensional model the standard error of the differences in the calculated and surveyed flood levels was less than expected error from the digital terrain model and the flood levels. This lesser standard error also validated the collection of observed flood level data from flood plain residents. The dissertation showed that both models MIKE 11 and 2 de could give good results, with the two-dimensional results marginally better, for the flooding in areas where recent flooding had not occurred which could have been used for calibration.

40|$|AbstractActin {{polymerization}} {{is responsible}} for moving {{a wide variety of}} loads, from the protrusion of membrane-bound filopodia and lamellipodia of immune, cancer, and other motile cells, to the propulsion of some intracellular pathogens. A universal explanation of the forces and velocities generated by these systems has been hampered by a lack of understanding in how a population of independent filaments pushes these loads. Protrusion of a lamellipodium by the very filaments supporting the membrane load is thought to operate by the Brownian ratchet mechanism, with overall organization governed by the dendritic-nucleation/array-treadmilling model. We have incorporated these two models into a <b>two-dimensional,</b> stochastic <b>computer</b> <b>model</b> of lamellipodial protrusion, and studied how force and velocity generation varied under different assumptions. Performance is very sensitive {{to the extent to which}} the work of protrusion is shared among individual polymerization events within the filament population. Three identified mechanisms promote this “work-sharing”: 1), Most systems, including lamellipodia, utilize a self-organizing distribution of filament-load distances which serves to decrease the effective size of a monomer and dramatically improve performance. 2), A flexible membrane allows for consistent performance over wide leading edges. 3), Finally, very flexible filaments are capable of sharing work very uniformly, and therefore, of near-perfect theoretical performance. Transient tethering to the lamellipodial membrane limits their efficacy, however, and mandates a minimum filament stiffness. Overall, we estimate lamellipodia to operate with 40 -nm bending-length filaments and low characteristic tether forces. Modeled lamellipodia exhibit sigmoidal force-velocity relationships and share the work of protrusion only moderately well among filaments, performing at approximately one-half of theoretical force and velocity maximums. At this level of work-sharing, the natural monomer size is optimal for generating velocity...|$|R

Such a steady state solution is reached in all calculations performed. The steady state for a chain where initially all diatoms are spaced equally (equidistant spacing) has forces that encourage the formation of cell pairs with less distance between one another.

40|$|A 1030 : 1 carbon steel, {{heat-sink}} nozzle was tested. The {{test conditions}} included a nominal chamber pressure of 2413 kN/sq m and a mixture ratio range of 2. 78 to 5. 49. The propellants were gaseous oxygen and gaseous hydrogen. Outer wall temperature measurements {{were used to}} calculate the inner wall temperature and the heat flux and heat rate to the nozzle at specified axial locations. The experimental heat fluxes were compared to those predicted by the <b>Two-Dimensional</b> Kinetics (TDK) <b>computer</b> <b>model</b> analysis program. When laminar boundary layer flow was assumed in the analysis, the predicted values were within 15 % of the experimental values for the area ratios of 20 to 975. However, when turbulent boundary layer conditions were assumed, the predicted values were approximately 120 % higher than the experimental values. A study was performed to determine if the conditions within the nozzle could sustain a laminar boundary layer. Using the flow properties predicted by TDK, the momentum-thickness Reynolds number was calculated, and the point of transition to turbulent flow was predicted. The predicted transition point was within 0. 5 inches of the nozzle throat. Calculations of the acceleration parameter were then made to determine if the flow conditions could produce relaminarization of the boundary layer. It was determined that if the boundary layer flow was inclined to transition to turbulent, the acceleration conditions within the nozzle would tend to suppress turbulence and keep the flow laminar-like...|$|R

40|$|Data {{from the}} Helios 1 {{spacecraft}} {{have been used}} to determine an empirical value for the polytropic index for the free-streaming solar wind. Application of this non-adiabatic polytropic index to a <b>two-dimensional</b> solar wind <b>computer</b> <b>model</b> to simulate the effects of thermal heat conduction has been investigated. The current project involves the insertion of this empirically-derived polytropic index into a magnetohydrodynamic model of solar wind propagation. This <b>computer</b> <b>model</b> is used to predict the time for shocks originating at the Sun to travel to Earth. This information is important for the protection of Earth-orbiting satellites. The model is a two and one-half-dimensional numerical code that solves the magnetohydrodynamic equations using the two-step Lax-Wendroff scheme. The shock jump ratios of the plasma parameters are determined using the Rankine-Hugoniot relations. In addition, the shock model requires a representative background solar wind as an initial condition. The original background solar wind is similar to the results obtained by Parker (Astrophysical Journal, 1958) and Weber and Davis (Astrophysical Journal, 1967). Changes to this initial condition are made by applying the non-adiabatic polytropic index to a three-dimensional, steady-state, magnetohydrodynamic model of the solar wind. The adjustments to the steady-state model produce a background solar wind that compares well to Helios 1 data. This new background solar wind is used as the initial condition for the 2 D shock model. The shock model is also adjusted to include the effects of heat conduction. Comparison of model results with observational data indicate that these changes produce average transit times that are only 45 minutes late. Before the changes to the 2 D shock model and its initial solar wind condition were made, the average prediction time was two hours late. Adjusting the shock model to include the effects of heat conduction but using the original background solar wind produces an average transit time that is less than one hour early. A few specific events are discussed in greater detail...|$|R
