5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{learns that}} her {{apartment}} building is being {{converted into a}} condominium and is told that she must purchase her apartment or face a rent increase. She decides {{that she wants to}} buy her apartment and the one above her, and turn <b>them</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> dream home. When she learns that her neighbor, Brian (Nate Corddry), will not be bribed out of his apartment, she agrees to move in with him, seemingly to save money, hoping to drive him out with her behavior. At work, Liz is disgusted by her staff writer, Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander) peeing in bottles to stop global warming. However, she decides to adopt this behavior to force Brian to leave; she is successful.|$|E
5|$|Martha then suffers {{the pain}} of losing Jack when he is accidentally shot by Angelo Rosetta (Luke Jacobz). Whilst grieving, Jack's cousins, Xavier (David Jones-Roberts) and Hugo Austin (Bernard Curry) arrive in Summer Bay for the funeral and she takes <b>them</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> home. Martha later falls for Hugo and they begin a relationship. A few months later, Martha is {{led to believe that}} Hugo is going to propose to her, but instead he ends their relationship, leaving Martha {{confused}} and upset. Martha is then kidnapped by Hugo's ex-wife Suzy Sudiro (Tasneem Roc). Angelo saves Martha and she assists him with the capture and arrest of Derrick Quaid (John Atkinson).|$|E
5|$|Carlo Maggi, a Catholic {{acquaintance}} of Momolo's {{who was also}} a retired judge, sent a report of Lepori's refutation to Scazzocchio, who asked Antonelli to pass it on to the Pope. A cover letter attached to Maggi's statement described it as proof that Morisi's story was false. Scazzocchio also forwarded an affidavit from the Mortara family doctor, Pasquale Saragoni, who acknowledged that Edgardo had fallen sick when he was about a year old, but stated that he had never been in danger of dying, and that in any case Morisi had been herself bedridden at the time she was supposed to have baptised the boy. A further report sent from Bologna in October 1858, comprising the statements of eight women and one man, all Catholics, corroborated the doctor's claims about the sicknesses of Edgardo and Morisi respectively, and alleged that the former maid was given to theft and sexual impropriety. Four women, including the servant Anna Facchini and the woman who had employed Morisi after she left the Mortaras, Elena Pignatti, claimed that Morisi had regularly flirted with Austrian officers and invited <b>them</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> employers' homes for sex.|$|E

5|$|Facing {{accumulated}} debts (including {{payments for}} her property in Auburn), Tubman fell prey in 1873 to a swindle involving gold transfer. Two men, one named Stevenson {{and the other}} John Thomas, claimed to have in their possession a cache of gold smuggled out of South Carolina. They offered this treasure – worth about US$5,000, they claimed – for US$2,000 in cash. They insisted that they knew a relative of Tubman's, and she took <b>them</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> home, where they stayed for several days. She knew that white people in the South had buried valuables when Union forces threatened the region, and also that black men were frequently assigned to digging duties. Thus the situation seemed plausible, and a combination of her financial woes and her good nature led her {{to go along with}} the plan. She borrowed the money from a wealthy friend named Anthony Shimer, and arranged to receive the gold late one night. Once the men had lured her into the woods, however, they attacked her and knocked her out with chloroform, then stole her purse and bound and gagged her. When she was found by her family, she was dazed and injured, and the money was gone.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Madonna {{collaborated with}} {{photographer}} Steven Klein for an art installation project called X-Static Process. The installation portrayed Madonna in different incarnations of her spiritual practices– from yogi, prophet, queen to freak and pole dancer. The publication was a worldwide success, {{leading to a}} number of exhibitions in New York, London, Paris, Düsseldorf, Berlin and Florence. After the exhibition was over, Madonna was inspired by the images from the exhibitions and decided to incorporate <b>them</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> then unplanned tour and asked Klein to help her with the task. She then began developing her sixth concert tour called Re-Invention World Tour. The poster released for the tour used one of the images from the installation project. It featured Madonna in a seventeenth-century-style dress, crawling on all fours towards the camera. The central theme of the show was unity versus violence. It was divided into five acts with different themes: French Baroque-Marie Antionette Revival, Military-Army, Circus-Cabaret, Acoustic and Scottish-Tribal segments. During the Q Awards, Elton John accused Madonna for lip-synching in her shows which gained great controversy but was denied by Madonna's representatives. Although musician Prince's Musicology Live 2004ever tour was initially projected to be the highest grossing tour of 2004, Billboard Boxscore published that the Re-Invention Tour had sold 55 out of the 56 shows and grossed $125 million. At the 2004 Billboard Touring Awards, Re-Invention Tour received the Top Tour while Madonna's tour manager Caresse Henry was awarded the Top Manager award. A documentary, titled I'm Going to Tell You a Secret, which chronicled the tour, was released in 2005.|$|E
5|$|In October 2012, {{new details}} emerged in her murder investigation. Charges were brought against Jorge Antonio Hernández Silva (alias El Silva) and José Adrián Hernández Domínguez (alias El Jarocho), {{two men who}} were alleged to have murdered Martínez Pérez. Silva, who had already been arrested, confessed to the murder. According to Silva's confession, the {{reporter}} knew Domínguez and therefore allowed both of <b>them</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> house {{on the night of}} her murder. After some conversation, Domínguez grew angry and started beating Martínez Pérez with the intention of forcing her to reveal where she hid her money and other valuable possessions. Silva then joined his accomplice in the beating until they killed her. Investigators said that the attackers had plunged the journalist's head into a toilet bowl, hit her on the head several times with brass knuckles, and threw her against a tub, where she cracked her skull. Martínez Pérez unsuccessfully tried to defend herself by grabbing a kitchen knife and stabbing one of the attackers in the forearm, but they managed to outweigh her because she only weighed 108lbs (48.9kg). Both men then stole a plasma TV, two cellphones, a laptop computer, a camera and a small box, and the journalist's wristband from her home before leaving the crime scene.|$|E

25|$|Rossakoff {{arrives at}} Poirot's flat. She happily confesses to Poirot that {{she put the}} jewels in the professor's pocket as she had found them in her own bag when the raid started, and {{so she had to}} get rid of them as quickly as she could. It was Varesco who planted them on her and she admits that he is the true owner of the premises. Poirot takes her into the next room where Higgs and Cerberus are waiting. Higgs can handle any dog and took the {{otherwise}} fierce animal out during the raid. Poirot asks Rossakoff to order the obedient dog to drop what it is holding in its mouth and it does so. A small sealed packet of cocaine drops to the ground. A shocked Rossakoff loudly proclaims her innocence and Poirot says he believes her – the true criminal is Alice who is in league with Verasco. She carried the drugs in her large skirt pockets and dropped <b>them</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> clients' pockets on the dance floor. When the raid occurred and the lights went out temporarily, Poirot was waiting by Cerberus and heard her put the packet in the dog's mouth – and Poirot took the opportunity to cut off a sample of cloth from her sleeve as proof.|$|E

500|$|A {{month after}} the [...] Eastern Daily Press report, in April 1967, the head was stolen from Howard's shop; other {{valuables}} and a cash box were left, suggesting that the thief specifically wanted the head. Police investigated, but the crime remained unsolved. In her private diary, Valiente claimed that the head had been stolen by Cardell, {{and that he had}} buried it in Charlwood. The Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White has stated that [...] "it appears that the [...] tradition died out around that time". Some of its teachings through the correspondence course however survived; they were adopted by the Gardnerian Wiccan high priestess Eleanor Bone, who added <b>them</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> own Book of Shadows. She then passed these teachings on to her initiates Madge Worthington and Arthur Eaglen, who established the Whitecroft line of Gardnerians.|$|E

Les's wife, Pam Coker (Lin Blakley), struggles with this and ends their marriage. In one of several attempts to win Pam back, Les burns all of Christine's belongings. Babe witnesses this and steals a half-burnt photograph of Christine. Badland said that Babe is [...] "quite Dickensian in the way that she finds things and slips <b>them</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> pocket to use against people!" [...] The storyline was revisited in May 2016 when Babe begins anonymously blackmailing Les and Pam in exchange for her silence. Of Babe's motivation to blackmail the Cokers, Badland said that [...] "Babe hasn't got any respect for Pam and Les and she's using them to get money. It's as simple as that really." [...] She also said that she [...] "resents seeing [...] and Pam together as a unit" [...] after he rejects her romantic advances, because she has [...] "never had what they have".|$|E

When Jimmy's natural resistance to telepathy allowed him to break free from Miss Sinister's control and he went rogue, the New Marauders were deployed to retrieve him. In the process, they confronted the Time-Displaced Original X-Men, who had tracked down Jimmy after he was detected by Cerebro. Following a brief confrontation against the X-Men and Jimmy, during which Marvel Girl learned of Miss Sinister's involvement, the New Marauders were ordered by their superior to leave.|$|E

Joey Guerra, on a review for the Houston Chronicle, praised Aguilera for being [...] "no mere copycat" [...] but [...] " [...] essential pieces from other performers, other sounds, other eras and blends <b>them</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> own sexy style", further concluding that the artist [...] "claims her pop throne".

Fortunately, however, the suggestions seemingly made in the overzealous words of some of these leading elders were never acted upon. The church never incorporated <b>them</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> polity. Indeed, {{it would have been a}} violation of divine instruction given in the New Dispensation had the church attempted to establish such procedure.

Many of these rhythms and sounds were part of her Southwestern roots. Likewise, a country sound and style, a fusion of country music and rock 'n' roll called Country rock, started to exert its influence on mainstream pop music around the late 1960s, and it became an emerging movement Ronstadt helped form and commercialize. However, as early as 1970, Ronstadt was being criticized by music [...] "purists" [...] for her [...] "brand of music" [...] which crossed many genres. Country Western Stars magazine wrote in 1970 that [...] "Rock people thought she was too gentle, folk people thought she was too pop, and pop people didn't quite understand where she was at, but Country people really loved Linda." [...] She never categorized herself and stuck to her genre-crossing brand of music.|$|E

She led a life of public prayer and labour which attracted other Filipino laywomen to live with her.
