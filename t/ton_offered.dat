The main innovation is filling the tower by electron gas, which can create pressure up one atmosphere, has negligible small weight and surprising properties. The suggested mast has following advantages in comparison with conventional space elevator: 1. Electrostatic AB tower may be built from Earth surface without the employment of any rockets. That decreases the cost of electrostatic mast by thousands of times. 2. One can have any height and has a big control load capacity. 3. Electrostatic tower can have {{the height of a}} geosynchronous orbit (36, 000 km) WITHOUT the additional top cable as the space elevator (up 120, 000 - 160, 000 km) and counterweight (equalizer) of hundreds of <b>tons.</b> 4.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedForward deployed naval forces {{are expected to}} remain the principal military option for underscoring U. S. foreign policy objectives abroad. But as the numbers of deployable ships decline, keeping the forward deployment of adequate numbers of U. S. Navy forces will become increasingly difficult. Since no nation possesses unlimited resources, determining the correct number, capability, and mix of warships is extremely difficult, if not impossible. As large numbers of expensive combatants become less affordable and, in a sense perhaps, irreplaceable, their liabilities can outweigh their unparalleled capabilities. Small, 1, 500 <b>ton</b> corvettes can <b>offer</b> a solution by way {{of their ability to}} apply appropriate naval force at the decisive point, at the decisive moment. Although small combatants are not part of present American naval strategy, this thesis concludes that small corvettes can reliably contribute to several of the roles and forward presence missions of the future. This conclusion is based on three interrelated factors: national strategy, fiscal constraints, and emerging or anticipated technologies. The flotilla, as postulated, presents a complementary and necessary balance to the combatant fleet of 2010, without sacrificing American military tactical advantage or strategic commitment as a world leader. The penalty of building only large and expensive warships could prove inadequate numbers for success in war or availability in peace[URL] United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|Optical {{technologies}} play nowadays {{a crucial}} role in different network scenarios (e. g., data centres, metro and access networks), mainly due to their support for higher bandwidth and scalability in comparison to electronic-based opaque solutions. In this context, the deployment of the Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm over optical networks has gained interest from both industry and research communities, spawning several implementations over multiple well documented use cases. However, in Transparent Optical Networks (<b>TONs),</b> where nodes <b>offer</b> optical switching capabilities, neighbouring nodes adjacencies have to be manually configured at both data and control plane levels, which is a lengthy task that can potentially lead to misconfiguration. Alternative solutions rely on the use of supervisory networks or dedicated channels. Nevertheless, implementing these methods requires both effort and resources to provide adjacencies discovery, making the awareness of the correct underlying topology by the SDN controller a tedious and occasionally very complex process. In this paper, we present a novel SDN-based cost-effective topology discovery method, allowing TONs to automatically learn physical adjacencies between optical devices. In particular, this is achieved by means of a test-signal mechanism and the OpenFlow protocol. The SDN control plane and optical agent implementations, as well as the message exchange flow between the subsystems and the controller are described. Then, the proposed discovery mechanism is experimentally assessed over an emulated TON test-bed, analysing the average time required for the optical topology discovery in different network scenarios.

40|$|In Mediterranean countries, {{olive tree}} pruning residue {{represents}} an abundant {{source of energy}} biomass, still largely unexploited for lack of cost-effective harvesting technology. The authors tested two industrial pruning harvesters, capable of overcoming the limits of lighter units appeared in the past years. One of the machines was designed for application to a powerful farm tractor, whereas {{the other was a}} self-propelled dedicated harvester. Data were collected from 10 operations, covering a total of 69 hectares and producing over 190 tonnes of wood fuel. Recorded productivity varied between 3 and 9 tonnes per scheduled machine hour (SMH), or 2 - 7 oven dry tonnes (odt) SMH- 1. Harvesting cost varied from 17 to 52 € t- 1, with an average value of 28 € t- 1 : these values correspond, respectively to 22, 70 and 40 € odt- 1. This compares very favourably with the average 1 - 1. 5 <b>ton</b> SMH- 1 <b>offered</b> by lighter commercial units. Productivity was related to residue density, row length and forwarding distance. Mechanical availability was high and over 90 %, for both machines. The authors also developed a simple deterministic model capable of predicting harvesting productivity and cost, as a function of significant site and economic conditions. The model {{can also be used to}} determine the break-even utilization level, below which the operational flexibility of a tractor-mounted operation becomes preferable to the higher productivity of a specialised unit. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|In {{the last}} few years we have seen a growing {{interest}} in machine learning approaches to computer vision and, especially, to semantic labeling. Nowadays state of the art systems use deep learning on millions of labeled images with very successful results on benchmarks, though it is unlikely to expect similar results in unrestricted visual environments. Most learning schemes essentially ignore the inherent sequential structure of videos: this might be a critical issue, since any visual recognition process is remarkably more complex when shuffling video frames. Based on this remark, we propose a re-foundation of the communication protocol between visual agents and the environment, which is referred to as learning to see like children. Like for human interaction, visual concepts are acquired by the agents solely by processing their own visual stream along with human supervisions on selected pixels. We give a proof of concept that remarkable semantic labeling can emerge within this protocol by using only a few supervised examples. This is made possible by exploiting a constraint of motion coherent labeling that virtually <b>offers</b> <b>tons</b> of supervisions. Additional visual constraints, including those associated with object supervisions, are used within the context of learning from constraints. The framework is extended in the direction of lifelong learning, so as our visual agents live in their own visual environment without distinguishing learning and test set. Learning takes place in deep architectures under a progressive developmental scheme. In order to evaluate our Developmental Visual Agents (DVAs), in addition to classic benchmarks, we open the doors of our lab, allowing people to evaluate DVAs by crowd-sourcing. Such assessment mechanism might result in a paradigm shift in methodologies and algorithms for computer vision, encouraging truly novel solutions within the proposed framework...|$|R
40|$|Este trabalho tem o seu foco no estudo da expressão hiuotesía, na {{literatura}} de tradição paulina, que é, em toda a Sagrada Escritura, a única que a utiliza. Embora haja trabalhos significativos sobre a questão, esta pesquisa estabelece um estudo comparativo entre a hiuotesía no contexto imediato de Gl 4, 1 - 7, circunstanciada pela expressão plerôma tou chrónou e de Ef 1, 3 - 10, onde, curiosamente, é utilizada a expressão plerôma tõn Kairôn. Nessa comparação reside a originalidade da presente pesquisa. Como os dois textos que reportam este termo encontram-se em contextos literários mais amplos, a primeira tarefa diz respeito ao estudo da estrutura de cada um desses contextos. Em seguida, passa-se ao estudo exegético de cada um deles, levando-se em conta aspectos semânticos, sobretudo em sua abordagem diacrônica. Com isto chega-se a identificar o alcance do vocábulo hiotesía e das expressões plerôma tou chrónou e plerôma tõn Kairôn em cada perícope A análise e comparação desses dois textos da tradição paulina evidenciam que as dessemelhanças existentes entre eles são decorrentes de paradigmas distintos que demandam, por isso mesmo, diferenciadas abordagens teológicas. Nesse sentido, o autor de Ef, ao se apropriar das expressões hiuotesía e plerôma tõn Kairôn, apresenta, de sua parte, uma nova e diferente interpretação do que o autor de Gl, anteriormente, dissera ao servir-se das expressões plerôma tou chrónou e hiuotesía. This work {{concentrates on}} the study of the expression hiuotesía in the writings of the Pauline tradition, the only one to use it in all the Holy Scriptures. Though significant works have been written on this matter, our present research frames a study on hiuotesía in the immediate context of Gal 4 : 1 - 7 and accompanied by the expression plerôma tou chrónou, as compared with that of Eph 1 : 3 - 10 where, stringly, the expression plerôma tõn Kairôn is used. In this comparison lies the originality of the present research. Since each of the texts that employ this term must be seen in it ampler literary context, the first task is to study the structure of each of those contexts. Next, follows the exegetical study of each of them, taking into consideration semantic aspects, especially in their diachronic approach. We thus manage to identify the range of the word hiuotesía and expression plerôma tou chrónou and plerôma tõn Kairôn in each pericope. Analysis and comparison between these two texts of the Pauline tradition show that the dissimilarities between them result from distinct paradigms which, therefore, demand differing theological approaches. In this sense, the author of Eph, by making his own the expressions hiuotesía and plerôma <b>tõn</b> Kairôn, <b>offers,</b> for his part, a new interpretation, differing from what the author of Gal had previously said by using the expressions plerôma tou chrónou and hiuotesía...|$|R
