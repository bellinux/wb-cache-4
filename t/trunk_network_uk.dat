Previous methods are first examined. We then present {{the results of a}} cost comparison of DAR and AAR using simple sizing techniques. Finally, more powerful techniques are examined based on the implied cost method of Kelly. 1. DYNAMIC ALTERNATIVE ROUTING (DAR) DAR was developed for application to the <b>UK</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>network</b> [1]. The development and motivation for it are described fully by Stacey and Songhurst [2]. The <b>UK</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>network</b> comprises a top tier of 55 fully-interconnected Digital Main Switching Units (DMSUs), and a lower tier of local exchanges, each of which is connected to two DMSUs.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the interrelatedness between the hierarchical structure of China׳s urban system and high-speed railway (HSR) network planning {{at the national}} level. As a multi-layered system, the Chinese HSR can be categorized into three sub-networks, namely, the national HSR <b>trunk</b> <b>network,</b> the national HSR extensional network, and the intercity HSR network. By examining the direct HSR network connection, HSR nodal connection, and HSR operational frequency of 287 prefecture-level cities, this study demonstrates that the hierarchies of China׳s administrative, demographic, and economic urban systems strongly influence HSR network planning. The national HSR <b>trunk</b> <b>network</b> prioritizes the connection of top-level central cities, whereas the extensional network prioritizes cities at the lower level of the urban system. Moreover, the national HSR system forms {{the backbone of the}} HSR network structure based on a national scale, whereas the intercity HSR system satisfies the travel needs within urban agglomerations based on the regional level...|$|R
