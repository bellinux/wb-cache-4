5|$|Angel sharks {{in general}} are highly {{threatened}} by commercial trawl fisheries due to their susceptibility to capture and low rate of reproduction, and angel shark species elsewhere {{are known to have}} declined markedly under fishing pressure. <b>Trawling</b> activity in the Yellow Sea {{and other parts of the}} northwestern Pacific is intense and, coupled with pollution, has had a serious impact on the local ecosystem. The Japanese angelshark population is suspected to have declined by up to 50% or more under these conditions, leading the species to be assessed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

5|$|Overfishing is {{a serious}} threat to {{seamount}} ecological welfare. There are several well-documented cases of fishery exploitation, for example the orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus) off the coasts of Australia and New Zealand and the pelagic armorhead (Pseudopentaceros richardsoni) near Japan and Russia. The {{reason for this is that}} the fishes that are targeted over seamounts are typically long-lived, slow-growing, and slow-maturing. The problem is confounded by the dangers of <b>trawling,</b> which damages seamount surface communities, and the fact that many seamounts are located in international waters, making proper monitoring difficult. Bottom <b>trawling</b> in particular is extremely devastating to seamount ecology, and is responsible for as much as 95% of ecological damage to seamounts.|$|E

West Coast. The <b>trawl</b> we tested differed from typical slope <b>trawls</b> {{in that it was}} a low-rise, two-seam <b>trawl</b> with a severely cut back headrope. We used an alternate haul, randomized block design to compare catches of the experimental <b>trawl</b> with those of a typical four-seam, high-rise <b>trawl</b> and to examine diel changes in catch rates for both <b>trawls.</b> The experimental <b>trawl</b> produced catches similar to the control <b>trawl</b> for all commercially valuable flatfish, except arrowtooth flounder Atheresthes stomias, which was reduced 24 %. Catches of most rockfish and roundfish were significantly reduced in the experimental <b>trawl</b> (50 – 94 % depending on species). However, the catches of darkblotched rockfish Sebastes crameri and redbanded rockfish S. babcocki were not reduced significantly in the experimental <b>trawl.</b> Nighttime catches were reduced 30 – 99 % for most rockfish species, the greatest reductions occurring in the experimental <b>trawl.</b> The large nighttime catch reduction for several rockfish species for both <b>trawls</b> along with no catch reduction in Dover sole Microstomus pacificus, suggests that fishing only at night may be a viable bycatch-reduction strategy for some rockfish species.

Using underwater video footage recorded inside <b>trawl</b> nets, we evaluated behavioural aspects of interactions between common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and <b>trawl</b> nets in the Pilbara <b>trawl</b> fishery. The interaction rates were very high; in 85 hours of footage collected from 36 <b>trawls,</b> dolphins were recorded inside <b>trawl</b> nets during 29 (81 %) <b>trawls</b> and outside <b>trawl</b> nets in 34 (94 %) <b>trawls,</b> and for up to 98 % and 99 % of the <b>trawl</b> duration, respectively. The proportion of foraging behaviours was significantly higher for dolphins inside the net (54 %) than those outside the net (31 %), indicating that dolphins were presented with a concentrated food source inside the net. Dolphins observed outside the net spent time ‘trampolining’ and socialising, indicating that they were motivated by several factors to approach and interact with <b>trawl</b> nets. Twenty-nine individuals were identified inside the net, some returning to the net numerous times within each <b>trawl</b> and between different <b>trawls</b> and fishing trips. Our results suggest that these dolphins are highly motivated to interact with <b>trawl</b> nets and that entering nets may be a specialised behaviour exhibited only by a subset of trawler-associated dolphins.

5|$|The shock {{from the}} ocellated {{electric}} ray is not dangerous to humans. It occasionally {{appears in the}} home aquarium trade, but is difficult to keep because it requires live invertebrates for food. The ocellated electric ray and other electric rays are used as model organisms in biomedical research because their electric organs are rich in ion channels and acetylcholine receptors, which play important roles in the human nervous system. The protein agrin, which concentrates acetylcholine receptors during human embryonic development, was first isolated from this species. Though the ocellated electric ray is not utilized economically, it is caught incidentally by shrimp trawlers. Its mortality from fishing has not been quantified but {{is thought to be}} high, considering that <b>trawling</b> operations in the Atlantic are known to take Diplobatis species in large numbers. The catch rate is also probably underestimated due to problematic identification. Given the restricted range of this species and the intensity of <b>trawling</b> within its habitat, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} abundance, seamounts {{are one of}} the most common marine {{ecosystems}} in the world. Interactions between seamounts and underwater currents, as well as their elevated position in the water, attract plankton, corals, fish, and marine mammals alike.

There are ongoing concerns on the negative impact of fishing on seamount ecosystems, and well-documented cases of stock decline, for example with the orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus). 95% of ecological damage is done by bottom <b>trawling,</b> which scrapes whole ecosystems off seamounts.|$|E
