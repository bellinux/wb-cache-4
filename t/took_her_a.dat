5|$|Born in Brussels on 15 September 1505, between ten {{and eleven}} in the morning, Archduchess Mary of Austria {{was the fifth}} child of King Philip I and Queen Joanna of Castile. Her birth was very difficult; the Queen's life was in danger and it <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> month to recover. On 20 September, she was baptized by Nicolas Le Ruistre, Bishop of Arras, and named after her {{paternal}} grandmother, Mary of Burgundy, {{who had died in}} 1482. Her godfather was her paternal grandfather, Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I.|$|E
25|$|In June 1940, {{at the age}} of 34, {{she married}} Tom Cookson, a teacher at Hastings Grammar School. After {{experiencing}} four miscarriages late in pregnancy, it was discovered she was suffering from a rare vascular disease, telangiectasia, which causes bleeding from the nose, fingers and stomach and results in anemia. A mental breakdown followed the miscarriages, from which it <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> decade to recover.|$|E
25|$|There {{was a small}} {{theater at}} the studio where {{contract}} players put on plays. While Kanin was acting in Irwin Shaw's Bury the Dead, {{she came to the}} attention of Michael Kanin, who had just been hired as a writer in the B unit. Michael was trained as an artist and had turned to commercial art and painting scenery for burlesque houses to help support his parents during the Depression. They were introduced by a mutual friend, and Michael practically asked Kanin to marry him right then and there, but it <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> little while to come around to the idea.|$|E

500|$|Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly was {{positive}} towards both this episode and the season premiere, [...] "Within," [...] awarding the episodes an [...] "A-". George Avalos and Michael Liedtke from the Contra Costa Times praised the episode {{and noted that}} the Scully/Dogget dynamic and the hunt for Fox Mulder worked towards the show's strengths. Tom Janulewicz from Space.com positively commented on Scully's conversion from skeptic to believer, writing, [...] "Regardless of whether it's aliens, flukemen, or pizza delivering vampires, The X-Files is all about phenomena that don't stand {{in the face of}} 'rational' explanations. It <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> long time, but like Mulder before her, Scully eventually came to accept that there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in her philosophy." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{portion of}} the clip's premise was {{inspired}} by Jackson's then-relationship with record producer Jermaine Dupri, which was unconfirmed and had generated speculation within the media. Meyers explained, [...] "In the other video we were shooting, {{she came out of}} the trailer wearing a So So Def jacket, and that's when I got the idea, 'it would be great if you do a whole video if you look like you do now when you're going home'. It <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> minute, she thought about it, she asked JD if he'd be okay with doing the video, 'cus I was begging and I was like, 'if I could get the two of you in a simple video together, it's gonna be gold.' She asked and he said yea, and that's when my video came to life." [...] Meyers also had the idea for Dupri's cameo due to persistent rumors of their relationship circulating in the media, saying [...] "That's the whole concept here, a real simple video and then the slam dunk is JD's in the video. He hasn't been in any of her stuff and all the rumors of 'are they together, are they not together.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|At VidCon 2015, Black {{revealed}} {{that she had}} been working on an album which she hoped to release by the end of 2015. According to her, the album will not be anything like her previous songs. She had been working on the album since releasing her song Friday; however, but it <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> while to be free from Ark Music Factory and find producers with whom she was comfortable. However, no album or new original songs were released. Towards the end of 2015, Black performed a cover of [...] "Wild" [...] by Troye Sivan. Black created a web video in January 2016 on Go90 called [...] "Life After Friday". In the show, Black graduates from high school, tells her parents she is not going to college, and follows her adventures after moving to Los Angeles.|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{you allow}} me to <b>take</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> message?--telling <b>her</b> that you are safe and under my roof, where it is {{obviously}} more prudent that you should remain at present." ...|$|R
60|$|Nanina debated {{with herself}} {{for a moment}} whether she should answer the letter in the hardest way, to her, by writing, or, in the easiest way, in person; and decided on going to the studio and telling the master-sculptor {{that it would be}} {{impossible}} for her to serve him as a model, at least for some time to come. It would have <b>taken</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> long hour to say this with due propriety on paper; it would only <b>take</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> few minutes to say it with her own lips. So she put on her mantilla again and departed for the studio.|$|R
60|$|Dubiously Claire {{started the}} engine. It sang jubilantly, {{and it did}} not stop. Again was the road open to her. Again was the {{settlement}} over there, to which it would have <b>taken</b> <b>her</b> <b>an</b> hour to walk, only six minutes away.|$|R
2500|$|When Oppewall was {{assigned}} art {{director for the}} 2006 spy film [...] The Good Shepherd, it <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> week to organize the number of set locations due to the large amounts of settings in the script, which included Cuba, Guatemala, LÃ©opoldville, London, Moscow, New York and New Haven, Connecticut, among other places. Although {{the vast majority of}} the movie was filmed in New York, the only scenes that are actually set in New York take place in a house in Far Rockaway, Queens. As a result, many sets had to be constructed under Oppewall's direction, including a Skull and Bones headquarters and the Berlin set, which was built on the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Oppewall built sets based on Skull and Bones, Central Intelligence Agency and other clandestine organizations after she consulted with a former CIA operative and researched books of interviews with spy agency insiders. Since the lead character played by Matt Damon originally aspired to be a poet, Oppewall incorporated many visual poetic symbols into the film, including a large number of mirrors to represent the duplicity of the CIA, full rigged ships as symbols of the state and eagle symbols, which were used in ironic situations such as suspect interrogations.|$|E
2500|$|Jobs and Apple {{became more}} successful, and his {{relationship}} with Brennan grew more complex. In 1977, the success of Apple was now {{a part of their}} relationship, [...] and Brennan, Daniel Kottke, and Jobs moved into a house near the Apple office in Cupertino. Brennan eventually took a position in the shipping department at Apple [...] Brennan's relationship with Jobs was deteriorating as his position with Apple grew, and she began to consider ending the relationship through small changes. In October 1977, Brennan was approached by Rod Holt, who asked her to take [...] "a paid apprenticeship designing blueprints for the Apples." [...] Both Holt and Jobs felt {{that it would be a}} good position for her, given her artistic abilities. Holt was particularly eager that she take the position and puzzled by her ambivalence toward it. Brennan's decision, however, was overshadowed by the fact that she realized she was pregnant and that Jobs was the father. It <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> few days to tell Jobs, whose face, according to Brennan [...] "turned ugly" [...] at the news. At the same time, according to Brennan, at the beginning of her third trimester, Jobs said to her: [...] "I never wanted to ask that you get an abortion. I just didn't want to do that." [...] He also refused to discuss the pregnancy with her. Brennan herself felt confused about what to do. She was estranged from her mother and afraid to discuss the matter with her father. She also did not feel comfortable with the idea of having an abortion. She chose instead to discuss the matter with Kobun, who encouraged her to have and keep the baby, and pledged his support. Meanwhile, Holt was waiting for her decision on the internship. Brennan states that Jobs continued to encourage her to take the internship, stating she could [...] "be pregnant and work at Apple, you can take the job. I don't get what the problem is." [...] Brennan however notes that she [...] "felt so ashamed: the thought of my growing belly in the professional environment at Apple, with the child being his, while he was unpredictable, in turn being punishing and sentimentally ridiculous. I could not have endured it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, we're fellow-critics, father"--she {{accepted}} this opening. [...] "I perfectly adopt your term." [...] But it <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> minute to go further. [...] "I saw Mr. Crim-ble here {{half an hour}} ago." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Thank you {{for telling}} me; I didn't know," [...] said Kit. [...] "I'll <b>take</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> sack as I {{go down the}} dale." [...] He paused and hesitated, {{with his hand on}} the open gate. [...] "But it's rather cold. Am I keeping you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Katharine directly, {{but she did}} not {{remember}} when or where she had seen him. It <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> moment or two to remember why Mary should ask her if she had seen Ralph.|$|E
60|$|Her {{voice broke}} {{in a kind}} of passionate sob, and it <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> moment or two to recover herself, even while Clyffurde stood by, mute and with well-nigh broken heart, his very soul so filled with sorrow for her that there was no room in it even for resentment.|$|E
60|$|Animated by {{this new}} {{idea that she}} had really seen Godfrey, and what was much worse, that Godfrey had really seen her upon an {{occasion}} when she would have much preferred to remain invisible to him, she was filled with remorse, and determined to write him a letter. Like that {{of the young man}} himself to his father, its composition <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> good deal of time.|$|E
60|$|I {{attempted}} to <b>take</b> <b>her</b> hand <b>a</b> second time; but she broke from me, and {{hurried into the}} house.|$|R
60|$|It <b>took</b> <b>her</b> but <b>a</b> {{short while}} {{to reach the}} place, but to her {{surprise}} nobody was in sight.|$|R
6000|$|... "Or yes, Mrs. Savor, you may <b>take</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> while;" [...] {{and she put}} {{the child}} {{into the arms of}} the {{bereaved}} creature, who had fallen desolately back in her chair. She hugged Idella up to her breast, and hungrily mumbled her with kisses, and moaned out over her, [...] "Oh dear! Oh my! Oh my!" ...|$|R
60|$|It {{took her}} two seconds {{to realize that}} the 'One in Authority' was a miserable incompetent, {{incapable}} of recognizing merit when it was displayed before him. It took her five minutes to dress. It <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> minute to run downstairs and out to the news-stand {{on the corner of the}} street. Here, with a lavishness which charmed and exhilarated the proprietor, she bought all the other papers which he could supply.|$|E
6000|$|It <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> {{minute to}} say, while her fine eye only rolled; {{but when she}} spoke that organ boldly rested and the truth vividly appeared. [...] "I ask because people like you, Lord John, strike me as {{dangerous}} to the--how shall I name it?--the common weal; and because of my general strong feeling that we don't want any more of our national treasures (for I regard my great-grandmother as national) to be scattered about the world." ...|$|E
6000|$|The child, after nodding {{her head}} and smiling as she read each fresh invitation, turned the slate over, and, with some little triumph at showing that she could write too, began slowly to trace some large text letters in {{extremely}} crooked lines. It <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> long time--especially as Mr. Blyth was breathlessly {{looking over her shoulder}} all the while--to get through these words: [...] "Thank you for being so kind to me. I will go with you anywhere you like." ...|$|E
50|$|Didons commander, Captain Captain Pierre Milius, {{decided to}} await {{the arrival of the}} British ship, and <b>take</b> <b>her</b> as <b>a</b> prize.|$|R

60|$|Hilary {{looked at}} that round, not too cleanly hand. He could see her {{watching}} him between her fingers. It was uncanny, almost horrible, like {{the sight of a}} cat watching a bird; and he stood appalled at the terrible reality of his position, at the sight of his own future with this girl, with her traditions, customs, life, the thousand and one things {{that he did not know}} about her, that he would have to live with if he once <b>took</b> <b>her.</b> <b>A</b> minute passed, which seemed eternity, for into it was condensed every force of her long pursuit, her instinctive clutching at something that she felt to be security, her reaching upwards, her twining round him.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I drew a breath, set my teeth, {{gripped the}} {{starting}} lever with both hands, {{and went off}} with a thud. The laboratory got hazy and went dark. Mrs. Watchett came in and walked, apparently without seeing me, towards the garden door. I suppose it <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> minute or so to traverse the place, but to me she seemed to shoot across the room like a rocket. I pressed the lever over to its extreme position. The night came like the turning out of a lamp, and in another moment came to-morrow. The laboratory grew faint and hazy, then fainter and ever fainter. To-morrow night came black, then day again, night again, day again, faster and faster still. An eddying murmur filled my ears, and a strange, dumb confusedness descended on my mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "Just selfishness, ma'am. I {{could not}} bring myself to {{run the risk of}} having to give her up. She was mine as much as his, and was a hundred times more to me than she could be to him. I <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> baby from her dead mother's arms. I fed her and nursed her, taught her her first words and her first prayer. Why should I offer to give her up to him who, likely enough, would not accept the offer when it was made to him? But I always {{intended}} to make it some day. It was my duty to give her the chance at least; but I kept on putting off the day, till that Saturday when she was so nearly drowned; then I saw my duty before me." ...|$|E
