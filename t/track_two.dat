500|$|Beyoncé is a {{fourteen}} track {{set with}} seventeen short films: a video for each audio <b>track,</b> <b>two</b> extra videos {{to accompany the}} two-part tracks [...] "Haunted" [...] and [...] "Partition", {{as well as a}} bonus video for [...] "Grown Woman", which lacks an equivalent audio counterpart. Departing from the traditional R leanings of its predecessor, 4 (2011), Beyoncés songs are predominantly alternative R. Hence, musically, the album may be located in the post-dubstep era, fusing electronic music with R and soul. The album's dark, moody production is more textured than previous releases and songs are characterized by heavy bass and loud hi-hats, as well as prominent synthesizers. A quality of restraint features among most songs [...] "with subdued pulses, ambient effects and throbbing grooves that sneak up on you, threatening to explode but only occasionally transforming".|$|E

Giuliani even read the lyrics to the song in a live press conference. Joel replied in a statement, [...] "There are a lot of important issues facing the voters in this Senate race.
