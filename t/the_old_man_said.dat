Bowers and I went to Kaufman’s store to get the money and Van Triplett and Foster {{remained}} behind. We came back with the dust and I unrolled it and showed them the sack, and <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>said</b> he did not know if that was gold, and Bowers said, ‘Open it and show it to him, as he don’t know gold dust when he sees it,’ but I did not open it, and [...] just about to roll it up again, when Foster grabbed it and handing it to <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man,</b> <b>said,</b> “Git!” and I started to grab the old man when they held me and said if I made a noise it would not be well for me. I pulled away from them and started after the old man, but could not see him and then went across the street and asked a party where there was an officer: that I had been robbed of $3,000 by some men over there.|$|E
2500|$|McCreight told Flying Hawk how Indians {{had killed}} his great {{grandfather}} in 1794. [...] How an Indian had {{hidden behind a}} log on the river bank and shot him through the groin while steering a houseboat on the Kiskiminetas River but {{a few miles from}} The Wigwam. [...] He asked the Chief how he would explain such a wholly uncalled-for criminal act. [...] Slow to reply, the Chief wanted to ask if this man was a soldier. [...] Told that he had been a captain in the Revolution, <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>said</b> that either the Indian knew the white man, or was drunk when he did the shooting. [...] Investigation of the affair showed that the Indian had been in Pittsburgh and had been drinking that day. [...] But, as the captain shot the Indian, both assailant and victim were dead and nothing was done or could be done about it.|$|E
2500|$|The second tale, {{related by}} the travel writer Will R. Bird, occurs {{at a time}} when men from the north shore of the Minas Basin used to cross the water to buy horses from farmers in the Annapolis Valley. During his summer travels in the late 1950s, Bird {{encountered}} an oldtimer on a farm near the Parrsboro golf course across the harbour from Partridge Island. [...] "You ever hear of our sea horse?" [...] the oldtimer asked. [...] "There ain't nothing to match it in Nova Scotia." [...] The story begins when Tom Smith crosses over to buy a mare from a man in Canning. The mare then had a black foal that [...] "was one of the finest ever seen on this shore." [...] After about seven years, the farmer from Canning showed up at Smith's farm and, obviously regretting that he had sold the mare, he offered Smith [...] "more'n twice the going price" [...] for his fast, black horse. [...] "Tom was a man who watched the dollars and he just couldn't resist," [...] the oldtimer said. The farmer from Canning took the boat back while Smith drove the horse around the Basin to deliver it. [...] "He was no more'n back home," [...] <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "when he happened to look toward the pasture and there was the black horse. Tom couldn't believe his eyes." [...] When he went down to the beach, he saw hoof marks showing where the animal had come ashore. Apparently, the horse had known to wait for low tide before attempting the crossing, but, it [...] "made a mighty long swim just the same." [...] The story ends with Smith returning to Canning to give the money back. [...] "He told the man he couldn't sell a horse that wanted to be with him that much, and the stranger agreed." ...|$|E

50|$|Formerly island {{people used}} {{to pay homage to}} saints buried in ziyaraiy (tombs with a roof and white flags) by visiting the place in a group.
