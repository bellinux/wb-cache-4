5|$|Amazon {{lost three}} in the battle and six in her wreck, with 15 wounded, while Indefatigable did not lose a single man killed, {{suffering}} only 18wounded. The discrepancy in losses during <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> likely due to the extreme difficulty the French crew had in aiming their guns given their ship's instability in heavy seas.|$|E
5|$|Jim Reardon {{directed}} the episode and has noted {{he remembers the}} episode for several scenes in which <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> viewed through windows, such as when Homer prank calls the dean. The animators were short on time, so {{for the design of}} Benjamin they took an earlier drawing of director Rich Moore and made it African-American.|$|E
5|$|A {{more recent}} {{development}} is the electric action which uses low voltage DC to control the key and/or stop mechanisms. Electricity may control the action indirectly through air pressure valves (pneumatics), in which case <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> electro-pneumatic. In such actions, an electromagnet attracts a small pilot valve which lets wind go to a bellows ("pneumatic") which opens the pallet. When electricity operates the action directly without the assistance of pneumatics, it is {{commonly referred to as}} direct electric action. In this type, the electromagnet's armature carries a disc pallet.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>actions</b> <b>are</b> Mauser-style with controlled-feed {{and come}} in both left and {{right-handed}} variations {{in a number of}} different sizes to fit different cartridges. They are similar to Winchester Model 70 actions but with more safety features. <b>The</b> <b>actions</b> <b>are</b> noted for being extremely strong.|$|R

5|$|Although {{set in a}} hospital, it uses {{no medical}} storylines; <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> {{produced}} {{by a series of}} soap opera-style twists and turns in the personal lives of the characters. They proceed through a series of often absurd sketch-like scenes, or by sequences where the film is slowed down or sped up, often emphasizing the body language of the characters. The show had eight writers. Two series were made by the Talkback Thames production company for Channel 4.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> fully implemented, the EPA {{estimates}} that 2.6million tons of smog-causing {{nitrogen oxide emissions}} will be eliminated each year. Soot or particulate matter will be reduced by an estimated 110,000tons a year. The reduction in sulfur will also prevent an estimated 8,300premature deaths, 5,500cases of chronic bronchitis and 17,600cases of acute bronchitis in children. In addition, an estimated 360,000asthma attacks and 386,000cases of respiratory symptoms in asthmatic children will also be avoided every year.|$|E
5|$|Dirge of Cerberus is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} third-person shooter. Battles occur in real-time, with the HUD displaying {{information such as}} Vincent's hit points and magic points, the currently selected item and quantity thereof, and a cross-hair to aid in targeting enemies. <b>The</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> viewed from an over-the-shoulder perspective similar to Resident Evil 4, although players can switch to a first-person perspective if they wish. Defeating enemies yields EXP, {{and at the end}} of each stage, the player can either use that EXP to level up, increasing Vincent's stats, or convert it to Gil (the in-game currency), which can then be used to purchase items and equipment upgrades.|$|E
2500|$|The {{notion of}} group <b>action</b> can <b>be</b> {{put in a}} broader context by using <b>the</b> <b>action</b> groupoid [...] {{associated}} to <b>the</b> group <b>action,</b> thus allowing techniques from groupoid theory such as presentations and fibrations.

5|$|In {{languages}} {{other than}} English, its name also reflects the action it resembles. Sports journalist Alejandro Cisternas, from Chilean newspaper El Mercurio, {{compiled a list}} of these names. In most cases, they either refer to the kick's scissor-like motion, such as the French ciseaux retourné (returned scissor) and the Greek psalidaki, or to its bicycle-like action, such as the Portuguese pontapé de bicicleta. In other languages, the nature of <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> described: German Fallrückzieher (falling backward kick), Polish przewrotka (overturn kick), Dutch omhaal (turnaround drag), and Italian rovesciata (reversed kick).|$|E
5|$|Southey {{uses the}} poem to {{describe}} various superstitions and myths, {{with a heavy}} reliance on repetition of various themes that link the myths together. Although based in Islamic theology, most of <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> mechanical instead of emphasising possible moral truths that {{can be drawn from}} the plot. Though the main character is purported to be a Muslim, the story actually takes place thousands of years before Islam, in ancient Babylon. Critics gave the work mixed reviews, with some emphasising the strong morality within the work or the quality of the poetry. However, other critics felt that the lack of a strong lyrical structure and the use of Middle Eastern myths detracted from the poem.|$|E
5|$|The play {{is set in}} an English {{boarding}} house. One of the lodgers locks {{himself in}} his room, leaving a note stating that he has decided to retire from the world until the world has changed. Other lodgers and his sister try to coax him out and establish what the problem is. <b>The</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> punctuated by songs performed by Bob Dylan.|$|E

5|$|In 1603, {{he painted}} a double {{portrait}}, {{now in the}} Metropolitan Museum, New York, of the prince and his boyhood friend John Harington, son of Lord Harington of Exton (see above). The double portrait is set outdoors, a style introduced by Gheeraerts in the 1590s, and Peake's combination of figures with animals and landscape also foreshadows the genre of the sporting picture. The country location and recreational subject lend the painting an air of informality. <b>The</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> natural to the setting, a fenced deer-park with a castle and town in the distance. Harington holds a wounded stag by the antlers as Henry draws his sword to deliver the coup de grâce. The prince wears at his belt a jewel of St George slaying the dragon, an allusion to his role as defender of the realm. His sword is an attribute of kingship, and the young noble kneels in his service.• Strong English Icon, 234. The stag is a fallow deer, a non-native species kept {{at that time in}} royal parks for hunting. A variant of this painting in the Royal Collection, painted c. 1605, features Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex, in the place of John Harington and displays the Devereux arms.|$|E
5|$|Intact and {{relatively}} detailed histories of Greece, such as Herodotus's The Histories, Thucydides's History of the Peloponnesian War, and Xenophon's Hellenica cover {{the period from}} roughly 500–362 BC. No extant history specifically covers the relevant period of Greek history (359–336 BC), although it is included within various universal histories. The main source for the period is Diodorus Siculus's Bibliotheca historica, written in the 1st century BC, which is therefore a secondary source. Diodorus devotes Book XVI to the period of Philip's reign, but <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> much compressed, and due to {{the scope of the}} work, this book also contains details of happenings during the same period elsewhere in the ancient world. Diodorus is often derided by modern historians for his style and inaccuracies, but he preserves many details of the ancient period found nowhere else. Diodorus worked primarily by epitomising the works of other historians, omitting many details where they did not suit his purpose, which was to illustrate moral lessons from history; his account of the period therefore contains many gaps.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> {{compressed}} and truncated, {{beginning in}} medias res with Pandarus already working for Troilus and praising his virtues to Cressida over {{those of the}} other knights they see returning from battle, but comically mistaking him for Deiphobus. The Trojan lovers are together only one night before the hostage exchange takes place. They exchange a glove and a sleeve as love tokens, but the next night Ulysses takes Troilus to Calchas' tent, significantly near Menelaus' tent. There they witness Diomedes successfully seducing Cressida after taking Troilus' sleeve from her. The young Trojan struggles with what his eyes and ears tell him, wishing not to believe it. Having previously considered abandoning the senselessness of war in favour of his role of lover and having then sought to reconcile love and knightly conduct, he is now left with war as his only role.|$|E
50|$|Verbal {{aspect is}} {{distinguished}} in English {{by using the}} simple or progressive (continuous) forms. He washed the dishes indicates that <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>was</b> finished; He was washing the dishes indicates that <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>was</b> ongoing (progressive). Serbo-Croatian, like all Slavic languages, has the aspect built into the verbs, rather than expressing it with different tenses.|$|R

50|$|Despite these advantages, leaderless {{resistance}} is often unstable.

If <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> <b>are</b> too successful, <b>the</b> result will be formation of support groups and other social structures—structures vulnerable to network analysis.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> {{preceded by}} a brief prologue, {{delivered}} by Apollo. Venus and Cupid are then discovered, in conversation, on a desolate seashore. Venus informs Cupid that Duke Theseus of Athens, together with Ariadne, will soon be arriving {{on the island of}} Naxos on their way to Athens. They are fleeing from Crete, where the pair have been complicit in the slaying of Ariadne's monster half-brother, the Minotaur, in the labyrinth below the palace of her father, King Minos. Venus is aware that Theseus intends to abandon Ariadne on Naxos, and to proceed to Athens alone. Cupid offers to rekindle Theseus's passion for Ariadne, but Venus has decided to unite her with the god Bacchus, and asks Cupid to arrange this.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} {{having sex with}} Tammy, Ron comes to work wearing a red shirt and black pants, which prompts Tom to observe that Ron always dresses like golf pro Tiger Woods after having sex. This joke was written before the story of Woods' extramarital affairs scandal broke in the news in November 2009. Andy {{is said to have}} auditioned for the reality {{television}} show Survivor and the television game show Deal or No Deal. During an audition tape, he is shown gutting a fish to prove he could perform on Deal or No Deal, even though <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>is</b> far more appropriate for Survivor. During one scene, to Leslie's shock and confusion, Tammy said she would rather be Cleopatra, the last pharaoh of Egypt's Ptolemaic dynasty, than Eleanor Roosevelt, the former First Lady and wife of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt.|$|E

25|$|Action {{is a part}} of an {{alternative}} approach to finding such equations of motion.
