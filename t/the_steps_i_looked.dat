40|$|The {{aim of this}} diploma thesis was {{to analyse}} {{services}} provided by a hotel in the historical center of Český Krumlov and to evaluate the customer satisfaction with these services. As <b>the</b> next <b>step,</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> into a proposal to improve some of those services and to design new ones, which have, so far, been missed by the customers in the offer. The work {{was based on a}} survey, which was carried out during the summer and {{in the beginning of the}} autumn 2008. The opening part of the thesis mentions theoretical basis connected with the specialised literature. The work itself continues with the results of the survey (questionnaire). The closing part of the work suggests improvements and new packages of services for clients...|$|R

A voice called to me, [...] "Get light, and behold me from above! Get light! get light!"

The voice again!--the voice was heard again!--"Sacrifice to me in secret, as thy brethren sacrifice! Give me the living where the living are, and the dead where the dead!" [...] The air came up cold, and the voice ceased, and the lamp was like sun, and moon, and stars--it gave no light {{in the place of}} darkness!' ...|$|R

40|$|One way {{to analyze}} how our brains {{function}} is to apply statistical models to neural data. In 1998, Shadlen and Newsome observed that a balanced random walk integrate-and-fire model can model experimental data such as single-unit recordings of rhesus monkeys. Using this model, I study the spike count correlation of two neurons under varying conditions. Through simulations, <b>I</b> <b>look</b> at the relationship of spike count correlation across two neurons to firing input rate when the inputs are independent and correlated. After this <b>step,</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> at whether an oscillatory input affects synchrony, i. e., synchronous firing of two neurons in close temporal proximity. It is crucial to understand what affects synchrony as a little change in synchrony can cause huge impacts in cellular processes {{in the brain and}} in how neurons communicate with each other. 1 Carnegie Mellon University Jonathan W.

In contrast, no nanobubbles are formed at the lower side of <b>the</b> <b>steps,</b> <b>i.</b> e., <b>the</b> most hydrophilic area. The width of this nanobubble-free zone is approximately 20 nm. We thus establish a correlation between surface topography and nanobubble formation.
