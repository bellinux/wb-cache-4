Custine's lovely daughter-in-law came daily to the {{courthouse}} to sit at his feet; eventually, the prosecutors accused the judges of postponing a verdict {{so that they could}} continue <b>to</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>at</b> her. The Revolutionary Tribunal convicted him of treason and he was executed by guillotine on the following day, 28 August 1793.|$|E
5|$|Stargazy pie is a pastry-based fish pie which, by tradition, {{is filled}} with whole pilchards. Critically, the pilchards must retain their heads, which then poke through the pastry top, {{appearing}} <b>to</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>at</b> the stars. The position of the fish allows the oil that is released during cooking to drain into the pie, adding a fuller flavour and ensuring the pie is moist. The celebrity chef Rick Stein suggested also poking the pilchards' tails through the pie crust to give the effect of leaping through water.|$|E
5|$|When Love Was Blind is a 1911 American silent short drama film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film focuses on young blind woman, May Read, who is saved from her burning home by Frank Larson. In the act of saving her, Frank is disfigured, but the two fall and love, marry and have a child. Two years later, the family physician offers to restore May's sight through a surgery. Frank consents despite his fears that May will not love him if she gazes upon his disfigured face. The surgery is a success and the doctor tells May not to remove the bandages. May ignores this warning and is permanently blinded after attempting <b>to</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>at</b> her husband, but she is content knowing her baby is beautiful. Directed by Lucius J. Henderson and starred Lucille Younge, the film was a critical success. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

She was found by Alexis, who took her back inside. Stars next appeared on April 20, 2005. Sam and Jason were in Italy looking for Michael and stopped <b>to</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>at</b> a shooting star. Jason promised Sam that he would bring her back to Italy to spend time together. The star gazing later inspired Jason to buy Sam a star shaped necklace, which became a tangible item of the theme of stars in their relationship. Jason later gifted Sam with the star necklace on May 11, 2005 and Sam wore the necklace daily.|$|E

25|$|Rusk {{was born}} on November 20, 1871 in Knox County, Illinois to James A. and Josie A. Rusk. His family emigrated from Illinois to Washington Territory {{in the fall of}} 1874. They settled in eastern Klickitat County in an area known as Wood Gulch. In 1878, Rusk’s only sibling, Leah, was born. Several years later, in 1879, they moved {{to the foot of the}} Columbia Hills in the lower Klickitat Valley near Warwick. Over the next year, Rusk’s father built the Happy Home stage station. Rusk often went to the top of the Columbia Hills <b>to</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>at</b> the various peaks of the Cascade Range. They lived in this place until Rusk was 15. They then moved to a {{homestead}} on the banks of the Klickitat River near Soda Springs in January 1887.|$|E
500|$|Froissart {{writes of}} the meeting in his Chronicles, saying that Isabeau stood {{motionless}} while being inspected, exhibiting perfect behavior {{by the standards of}} her time. Arrangements were made for the two to be married in Arras, but on the first meeting Charles felt [...] "happiness and love enter his heart, for he saw that she was beautiful and young, and thus he greatly desired <b>to</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>at</b> her and possess her". She did not yet speak French and may not have reflected the idealized beauty of the period, perhaps inheriting her mother's dark Italian features, then unfashionable, but Charles most certainly approved of her because the couple were married three days later. Froissart documented the royal wedding, joking about the lascivious guests at the feast and the [...] "hot young couple".|$|E
500|$|The {{great white}} shark {{is one of only}} a few sharks known to {{regularly}} lift its head above the sea surface <b>to</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>at</b> other objects such as prey. This is known as spy-hopping. This behavior has also been seen in at least one group of blacktip reef sharks, but this might be learned from interaction with humans (it is theorized that the shark may also be able to smell better this way because smell travels through air faster than through water). White sharks are generally very curious animals, display intelligence and may also turn to socializing if the situation demands it. At Seal Island, white sharks have been observed arriving and departing in stable [...] "clans" [...] of two to six individuals on a yearly basis. Whether clan members are related is unknown but they get along peacefully enough. In fact, the social structure of a clan is probably most aptly compared to that of a wolf pack; in that each member has a clearly established rank and each clan has an alpha leader. When members of different clans meet, they establish social rank nonviolently through any of a variety of interactions.|$|E

2500|$|In heaven, he explains, {{there is}} a {{procession}} led by Zeus, who looks after everything and puts things in order. All the gods, except for Hestia, follow Zeus in this procession. While the chariots of the gods are balanced and easier to control, other charioteers must struggle with their bad horse, which will drag them down to earth if {{it has not been}} properly trained. [...] As the procession works its way upward, it eventually makes it up to the high ridge of heaven where the gods take their stands and are taken in a circular motion <b>to</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>at</b> all that is beyond heaven.|$|E
2500|$|An alarmed, but cloistered, Pauline {{began to}} write letters to Thérèse and {{attempted}} various strategies to intervene. Eventually Thérèse recovered after she had turned <b>to</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>at</b> the statue of the Virgin Mary placed in Marie's room, where Thérèse had been moved. She reported on 13 May 1883 {{that she had seen}} the Virgin smile at her. She wrote: [...] "Our Blessed Lady has come to me, she has smiled upon me. How happy I am." [...] However, when Thérèse told the Carmelite nuns about this vision at the request of her eldest sister Marie, she found herself assailed by their questions and she lost confidence. Self-doubt made her begin to question what had happened. [...] "I thought I had lied – I was unable to look upon myself without a feeling of profound horror." [...] "For a long time after my cure, I thought that my sickness was deliberate and this was a real martyrdom for my soul." [...] Her concerns over this continued until November 1887.|$|E
2500|$|Felix, being bisexual, was {{not certain}} {{if he was}} [...] "fit for marriage." [...] Still, {{he was drawn to}} Irina and her icon-like beauty when he first {{encountered}} her. [...] "One day when I was out riding I met a very beautiful girl accompanied by an elderly lady. Our eyes met and she made such an impression on me that I reined in my horse <b>to</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>at</b> her as she walked on," [...] he wrote in his memoirs. One day in 1910, he was paid a visit by Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich and Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna and was happy to discover the girl he had seen on the riding trail was their only daughter, Irina. [...] "This time I {{had plenty of time to}} admire the wondrous beauty of the girl who was eventually to become my wife and lifelong companion. She had beautiful features, clear-cut as a cameo, and looked very like her father." [...] He renewed his acquaintance with Irina in 1913 and was even more drawn to her. [...] "She was very shy and reserved, which added a certain mystery to her charm.... Little by little, Irina became less timid. At first her eyes were more eloquent than her conversation but, as she became more expansive, I learned to admire the keenness of her intelligence and her sound judgment. I concealed nothing in my past life from her, and, far from being perturbed by what I told her, she showed great tolerance and comprehension." [...] Yusupov wrote that Irina, perhaps because she had grown up with so many brothers, showed none of the artifice or lack of honesty that had put him off relations with other women.|$|E
