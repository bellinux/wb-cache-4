5|$|Parsons' newfound {{credentials}} and financial security {{gave him the}} opportunity to travel more widely throughout the U.S. as an ambassador for Aerojet, meeting with other rocket enthusiasts. In New York he met with Karl Germer, the head of the O.T.O. in North America and in Washington, D.C. he met Poet Laureate Joseph Auslander, donating some of Crowley's poetry books to the Library of Congress. He also became a regular at the Mañana Literary Society, which met in Laurel Canyon at the home of Parsons' friend Robert A. Heinlein and included science fiction writers including Cleve Cartmill, Jack Williamson, and Anthony Boucher. Among Parsons' favorite works of fiction was Williamson's Darker <b>Than</b> <b>You</b> <b>Think,</b> a novelette published in the fantasy magazine Unknown in 1940, which inspired his later occult workings. Boucher used Parsons as a partial basis for the character of Hugo Chantrelle in his murder mystery Rocket to the Morgue (1942).|$|E

The recording {{took place on}} October 16 and October 17, 1989. Malkmus {{was influenced by the}} rehearsal style of jazz musicians as significant to the EP's recording, saying [...] "When we start recording, we're really focused on what we're doing. We know how it's going to sound in the studio. We don't have to worry if it's sounding good in the rehearsal space. We take those prescriptions from the great jazz people and applied them to our own framework." ...|$|E

500|$|While Malkmus {{was still}} abroad, Kannberg {{moved in with}} a friend and his roommate Jason Fawkes in Sacramento, California. Fawkes and Kannberg formed a new band called Pa, with Fawkes on drums. Kannberg said, [...] "I didn't know if Pavement {{was going to do}} {{anything}} so I just said, 'Let's start another band.'" [...] The duo frequently jammed, and considered a future release on Drag City. Pa recorded a series of instrumental demos, including new songs [...] "Two States", [...] "Forklift", and [...] "Collapse", at Young's Louder <b>Than</b> <b>You</b> <b>Think</b> studios during a trip to Stockton. After Kannberg and Fawkes had returned to Sacramento, Malkmus visited and the group decided to turn the Pa songs into a Pavement project. Malkmus wrote lyrics to [...] "Forklift" [...] and presented the band with [...] "two or three other songs" [...] he had previously written.|$|E
500|$|Pavement {{was formed}} in 1989 in Stockton, California, by Stephen Malkmus and Scott Kannberg. Malkmus and Kannberg had {{previously}} performed together in the band Bag O' Bones. Pavement had its start playing at open mike nights at clubs and bars. The songs the band played during this time were mostly covers, although they also performed many original songs that would later be released on Slay Tracks. Malkmus recalls, [...] "It was pretty reasonable {{to be able to}} make a single for $1,000, so we decided to go for it. We didn't have any real plans because we weren't a real band." [...] Two local studios existed in Stockton, the cheaper and less professionally minded of which was Gary Young's Louder <b>Than</b> <b>You</b> <b>Think</b> Studio. The band decided to record at Young's studio due to their admiration of other local punk bands who had recorded there, including The Young Pioneers and The Authorities. Kannberg reportedly borrowed $800 from his father to record Slay Tracks.|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} film a B rating, {{saying that the}} tale [...] "is {{surprisingly}} good and surprisingly gruesome fun. Eklund makes {{the most of the}} maniac role and Breslin is a sympathetic victim." [...] Reviewer Dwight Brown wrote, [...] "The script gives Berry a blue-collar character she can make accessible, vulnerable and gutsy... Chestnut is not suitably gallant and stalwart as her caring lover and a cop on a mission... This film is a whole lot scarier <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> it's going to be." [...] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote, [...] "An effectively creepy thriller about a 911 operator and a young miss in peril, The Call is a model of low-budget filmmaking." [...] She praised its [...] "clean, clever premise" [...] and said that Berry's Jordan is [...] "an old-fashioned hero in many respects, so it's fitting that Mr. Anderson uses old-fashioned filmmaking techniques, like crosscutting, to build tension and old-school exploitation tricks like evil to justify taking the story dark and then dark and bonkers." ...|$|E

500|$|Actor James Anderson {{was cast}} as Oliver. Before {{assuming}} the role, he shadowed a real F1 doctor on ward rounds – an experience he found difficult. [...] "We were approaching beds {{in which people}} were waking up from heart attacks and coming around quite distressed sometimes. It was really difficult {{to be there with}} a patient.

[...] The actor experienced [...] "an extended period of anxiety" [...] upon joining the series, and recalls: [...] "It took me about six months to have any sense {{of what was going on}} and then the second six months to feel comfortable [...] but only because it's such a well-oiled machine. You're coming in as a little cog, so you have to discover how to work in that and that takes a while." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{episode is}} the first to deal with the concept of time travel, the next being [...] "The Constant" [...] in the fourth season. Unlike other {{flashback}} sequences to this point, this is positioned as actual time travel for Desmond. However, in this episode ground rules are established to prevent paradoxes in the story line as a result of time travel. Had these rules not been established, the writers feared that viewers would lose interest because the stakes of the characters would be lessened. In an interview, Henry Ian Cusick, who plays Desmond, said shooting the episode was both [...] "fun" [...] and [...] "tiring". Cusick said that when shooting the episode [...] "you're finishing late and starting early", but he enjoyed working with director Jack Bender because [...] "he pushes you to, to try and go a little bit further <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> you can". The London scenes were shot in Honolulu. This led to several continuity errors, such as a British Army recruitment poster for a Scottish regiment (which would not recruit in England) featuring the word [...] "Honour" [...] being incorrectly spelled in the American English [...] "Honor" [...] and a photograph of a British soldier using an American M4 carbine and urging people to join the [...] "military" [...] (instead of the [...] "army", as a British poster would say).|$|E
