40|$|The present article {{considers}} four aspects {{in which}} the trade secret method is less efficient than the patents method: litigation costs, transaction costs, financing costs, and employment costs. The {{main part of the}} article is devoted to the proposal of establishing a particular type of <b>trade</b> secrets <b>registry,</b> with the intention that it will reduce the above-mentioned costs and will improve the efficiency of the trade secret method. I propose a structure for the registration of trade secrets that is likely to solve most of the problems left unresolved by the escrow companies and the Indonesian legislation. A <b>trade</b> secret <b>registry</b> may seem to be a contradiction in terms, because the purpose of a registry is to make public the information registered with it, whereas trade secrets must be kept confidential. But the proposed registry integrates these two principles, so that a part of it remains confidential and another part is open to the public. As part of the <b>registry,</b> <b>trade</b> secrets would be deposited confidentially through coded communication, including dating of the deposit. But, the identity of the holders of the rights with respect to these secrets (including those possessing secondary rights, such as licensees and holders of a mortgage) and the identity of those bound by confidentiality regarding the secrets deposited (such as employees of the owner of the trade secret) will be public information. The proposed registry would be handled by the registrar of trade secrets, a quasi-judicial figure empowered to resolve judicial disputes when necessary...|$|R
5000|$|The UK ETS was a {{voluntary}} cap-and-trade scheme where participants were allocated an allowance of emissions, which included other GHGs {{as well as}} carbon, and if a participating company emitted less than their cap for that year they could trade the remaining allowances. It has now closed to new participants but allowances are still traded. While this may appear as recourse to the market to effectively govern carbon emissions, the fact remains “in order to govern through markets, governments must first create those markets through the exercise of a hierarchical authority”. The UK ETS {{was created by the}} Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), the then responsible government department, and it was the government’s ambitious emissions reduction target that “spurred the UK to innovate with” [...] this particular instrument. The <b>Trading</b> <b>Registry</b> for emissions is also run through DECC, exemplifying the government’s centralisation of the process and while it was left to businesses to decide how to manage their carbon emissions, and the market to decide the price, it was the governments desire to reach emissions targets and “reduce (the) economic cost” of doing so that was being represented.|$|R
