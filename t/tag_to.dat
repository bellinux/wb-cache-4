5|$|Also bird banding. The {{attachment}} of a small, individually numbered {{metal or}} plastic <b>tag</b> <b>to</b> the leg or wing {{of a wild}} bird to enable individual identification. This helps in {{keeping track of the}} movements of the bird and its life history. Upon capture for ringing, it is common to take measurements and examine the conditions of feather , amount of subcutaneous fat, age indications and sex. The subsequent recapture or recovery of the bird can provide information on migration, longevity, mortality, population, territoriality, feeding behaviour and other aspects that are studied by ornithologists. Bird ringing is the term used in the UK and in some other parts of Europe; while the term bird banding is more often used in the U.S. and Australia.|$|E
5|$|Timetoget started {{negotiations}} with the Swedish company BK <b>Tåg</b> <b>to</b> try to establish a cooperation that would allow Swedish engineers to be used. At the same time, the minority shareholders, who owned 11% of the company, demanded that they could take over NSB's shares without compensation, and that all debt to NSB be deleted. Arne Wam responded by stating that NSB wanted to liquidate the company. NSB therefore offered to purchase all shares in the company at par value, despite the company not having any net assets.|$|E

5|$|Following the battalion's {{return from}} East Timor {{it was again}} {{restructured}} to resume {{its role as a}} two-company commando battalion. However, in 2001 the Australian Government directed the permanent establishment of a second <b>TAG</b> <b>to</b> be based on the east coast of Australia. The TAG is supplemented by clearance divers from the Navy Clearance Diving Branch who form the Water troop. A Company was subsequently raised as a commando company in 2002. Following the creation of SOCOMD in 2002 and the Bali bombings in October that year, further resources became available. The battalion was subsequently involved in security operations for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Queensland in 2002. Elements of the battalion were also involved in the boarding of a North Korean freighter, the MV Pong Su—which was suspected of drug smuggling—off Newcastle on 20 April 2003. In 2005, a fourth commando company was subsequently raised, with D Company being formed. Later, the battalion was tasked with supporting the security arrangements for the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne. In 2014, elements of the regiment were deployed to Brisbane to protect the G20 Leaders Summit held in the city on 15 and 16 November.|$|E

25|$|Protein {{purification}} tags: Some {{expression vectors}} include proteins or peptide sequences {{that allows for}} easier purification of the expressed protein. Examples include polyhistidine-tag, glutathione-S-transferase, and maltose binding protein. Some of these tags may also allow for increased solubility of the target protein. The target protein is fused to the protein tag, but a protease cleavage site positioned in the polypeptide linker region between the protein and the tag allows the <b>tag</b> <b>to</b> be removed later.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, the {{intention}} was announced {{to extend the}} line back to Belgrave & Birstall. The former station had been vandalised and the Railway {{had no choice but}} to demolish the buildings. In 1990, a station called Leicester North was opened a hundred metres to the south of Belgrave & Birstall. This shift in location placed the new station inside Leicester's city boundary, allowing the 'Leicester' <b>tag</b> <b>to</b> be included in the name, along with unlocking extra funds to assist in the construction.|$|E
25|$|A tag team {{match was}} next. The Smoking Gunns (Bart and Billy) faced The Blu Brothers (Jacob and Eli), with their manager Uncle Zebekiah at ringside. The Blu Brothers held the {{advantage}} {{for the majority of}} the match, making quick tags to work over Billy. Billy eventually made the hot <b>tag</b> <b>to</b> Bart, who gained the immediate advantage but was booted in the face by Jacob. Bart regained the advantage, pushing Jacob into Eli. The Gunns followed up with their Sidewinder finisher for the pin.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 1990s, {{increased}} spending power, via a stronger British Pound at the time, enabled fans {{to take the}} song overseas when following tours of the English national cricket team. Because of that particular song, {{and the fact that}} it seemed to represent English fans' activity of standing in the hot sun drinking lager all day, it became a description as well as a song. David Lloyd and Ian Botham used the <b>tag</b> <b>to</b> describe the supporters whilst commentating for Sky Sports during England's tours from 1993 to 1995.|$|E
50|$|MP4 {{also allows}} the {{embedding}} of an ID3 tag, {{and this is}} widely supported, especially in Apple's iTunes, which uses MP4 standards in its audio and video file formats. Apple also uses ID3 <b>tags</b> <b>to</b> provide a Parental Advisory or Clean Version (radio edit) rating for audio tracks or music videos bought on the iTunes Store. Other container-based formats use their own tagging formats. Example are Ogg and FLAC, which use Vorbis comments. Adding ID3 <b>tags</b> <b>to</b> these would break the container structure. Earlier versions of Winamp such as 2.xx have been proven able to add ID3v1 and ID3v2 <b>tags</b> <b>to</b> MP1 and MP2 files.|$|R

25|$|A pet door (also {{known as}} a cat flap or dog door) is an opening in a door to allow pets to enter and exit without the main door's being opened. It may be simply covered by a rubber flap, {{or it may be}} an actual door hinged on the top that the pet can push through. Pet doors may be mounted in a sliding glass door as a new (permanent or temporary) panel. Pet doors may be unidirectional, only {{allowing}} pets to exit. Additionally, pet doors may be electronic, only allowing animals with a special electronic <b>tag</b> <b>to</b> enter.|$|E
25|$|Regulated {{games are}} overseen by referees or marshals, who patrol {{the course to}} ensure {{enforcement}} of the rules {{and the safety of}} the players. If a player is marked with paint, they will call him out, but competitors may also be expected to follow the honor code; a broken ball means elimination. Field operators may specify variations to this rule, such as requiring a <b>tag</b> <b>to</b> certain body locations only – such as the head and torso only. There are game rules that can be enforced depending on the venue, to ensure safety, balance the fairness of the game or eliminate cheating.|$|E

25|$|Man-made GFP became {{commonly}} {{used as a}} fluorescent <b>tag</b> <b>to</b> show which cells or tissues express specific genes. The genetic engineering technique fuses the gene {{of interest to the}} GFP gene. The fused DNA is then put into a cell, to generate either a cell line or (via IVF techniques) an entire animal bearing the gene. In the cell or animal, the artificial gene turns on in the same tissues and {{the same time as the}} normal gene, making GFP instead of the normal protein. Illuminating the animal or cell reveals what tissues express that protein—or at what stage of development. The fluorescence shows where the gene is expressed.|$|E
25|$|There {{was also}} a story that was widely {{circulated}} {{over the years and}} famously recounted in Lawrence Ritter's The Glory of Their Times, that at one point Cobb was on first; he bragged to Wagner {{that he was going to}} steal second and threatened to assault him physically doing it; Wagner defiantly dared him to try it and placed an especially rough <b>tag</b> <b>to</b> Cobb's mouth; and the two exchanged choice words. Cobb denied it in his autobiography, and the play-by-play of the 1909 World Series confirms that the event could not have happened as stated: Cobb was never tagged out by Wagner in a caught-stealing. The Pirates won the series four games to three behind the pitching of Babe Adams.|$|E
25|$|Situs inversus {{is found}} in about 0.01% of the population, or about 1 person in 10,000. In the most common situation, situs inversus totalis, it {{involves}} complete transposition (right to left reversal) {{of all of the}} abdominal organs. The heart is not in its usual position in the left chest, but is on the right, a condition known as dextrocardia (literally, right-hearted). Because the relationship between the organs is not changed, most people with situs inversus have no medical symptoms or complications, although they should wear a medical identification <b>tag</b> <b>to</b> warn emergency medical staff that the patient's internal organs are reversed from normal so they can act accordingly, e.g. by listening for a heartbeat on the right rather than left side of the chest.|$|E
