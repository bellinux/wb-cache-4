5|$|Despite the {{official}} opening occurring in 1846, {{the construction of}} the Albert Dock was not fully completed until 1847. In 1848, a new dock office was built and the dock itself was upgraded to feature a hydraulic cargo handling hoist system, {{the first of its kind}} in the world. Over the next decade several more buildings where added including houses for the piermaster, his assistant & the warehouse superintendent; and a cooperage. Warehousing in the dock was also expanded to meet <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>demand</b> by joining together the eastern and western ends of the Southern Stack.|$|E

He saw an opportunity to buy the material cheaply on the black market, and make a profit in the West, where <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>demand</b> among Stuttgart collectors was raising memorabilia prices up to ten times the amount he would pay. The trade was illegal in East Germany, and the export of what were deemed items of cultural heritage was banned. Among the items smuggled out of East Germany were weapons.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the opening}} of Melbourne Airport, Melbourne's main airport was Essendon Airport which was officially {{designated}} an international airport in 1950. In the mid-1950s, over 10,000 passengers were using Essendon Airport and the limitations of Essendon Airport were beginning to become apparent. Essendon Airport's facilities were insufficient to meet <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>demand</b> for air travel; the runways were too short to handle the then new jet airliners and the terminals failed to handle the increase in passengers, by the mid-1950s, an international overflow terminal was built in a new northern hangar. Due to the encroachment of the urban boundary, the airport had become surrounded by residential housing, meaning that expansion of Essendon Airport was not possible.|$|E
5|$|The {{environmental}} impact of aviation in the United Kingdom is increasing due to <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>demand</b> for air travel in the country. In the past 25 years the UK air transport industry has seen sustained growth, {{and the demand for}} passenger air travel in particular is forecast to increase more than twofold, to 465 million passengers, by 2030. Two airports; London Heathrow Airport and London Gatwick Airport, are amongst the top ten busiest airports in the world for international passenger traffic. Whilst {{more than half of all}} passengers travelling by air in the UK currently travel via the five London area airports, regional airports have experienced the most growth in recent years, due to the success of 'no-frills' airlines over the last decade.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{believed that}} the changes were needed because of the collapse in unskilled jobs in the economy, which means that young school leavers at 16 years of age are finding it increasingly more difficult to find employment, consequentially in many cases making them unemployable. Within the last 40 years, the number of unskilled jobs available have more than halved, from 8 million in the 1960s to 3.5 by 2007, with predictions of further drops to just 600,000 by 2020 due to <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>demand</b> for skilled labour. This, together with fewer students continuing their further education, increase the difficulty for young school leavers to find work if they were either not able, or chose not to, stay on at school and complete further education.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the opening}} of Phase 1, {{ridership}} on the Lexington Avenue Line at the 68th Street, 77th Street, 86th Street, and 96th Street stations decreased in January 2017 compared to in January 2016. The Second Avenue Line's three stations and the renovated Lexington Avenue–63rd Street station saw an average weekday ridership of more than 150,000 {{by the end of}} January. The 72nd Street station was the busiest of the line's new stations, with an average daily ridership of 44,000. By April, taxi usage in the area also saw a decline of more than 20% compared to before the line's opening. By May 15, Second Avenue ridership had increased to 176,000 passengers a day, reducing overall usage on the Lexington Avenue Line by 26% while representing a 42% increase from the Second Avenue ridership in January. Because of <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>demand,</b> Q service will be increased by one downtown trip in the morning and by one uptown trip in the evening on November 6, 2017. In addition, one northbound R trip was rerouted from the IND Queens Boulevard Line to further boost service. This trip will return southbound in the evening in Q service.|$|E
