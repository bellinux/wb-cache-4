5|$|As {{a result}} of {{complaints}} by {{family members of the}} victims and others <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> was failing to hold its personnel accountable, the U.S. Senate and U.S. House conducted their own investigations into the shootdown and the U.S. military's response to it. Also, Ronald R. Fogleman, the USAF's new Chief of Staff, conducted his own review of the actions taken by the USAF against the officers involved in the incident.|$|E
5|$|Because Justice Anthony Kennedy did {{not join}} Stevens' opinion as to several parts, largely {{on the grounds of}} {{judicial}} parsimony (that is, having decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> commissions had no foundation, the core question of the case was decided and the Court did not need to go further), those sections were without a majority in support.|$|E
50|$|A later Newsweek {{investigation}} {{concluded that}} as many as five thousand civilians were killed during Speedy Express.

5|$|Beginning in September 1864, Indianapolis was {{the site}} of the trials by a {{military}} commission of several men accused and convicted of treason. In a landmark civil liberty case that became known as Ex parte Milligan, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the convictions, On April 3, 1866, the Court ruled <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> trial was illegal because the civilian courts were open and functioning during the war. Following the Court's ruling, the men were released.|$|E

5|$|Gambira faced a {{total of}} sixteen charges {{for his role in}} the protests, {{including}} membership in an unlawful association and illegal movement across borders. In October 2008, Gambira's lawyer, Aung Thein, resigned from his case, saying <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> government would not allow him the materials to prepare an adequate defence. On one occasion, Gambira refused to appear in court himself, stating that the trial of a forcibly disrobed monk was disrespectful to Buddhism.|$|E

5|$|It {{was during}} this period that the Soviets started to assert {{themselves}} in several new theaters of action, in particular through Cuban proxies during the Angolan Civil War starting in 1975 and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. U.S. strategy to this point had been focused on containing Communism and preparation for war in Europe. The new Soviet actions revealed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> lacked capability outside these narrow confines.|$|E
5|$|The Secretary of State Nguyễn Đính Thuan and Interior Minister Bùi Văn Lương {{were caught}} off guard by the attacks. The initial {{perception}} was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> establishment had suddenly cracked down on the Buddhists because they were deemed {{to be a threat}} to the war effort. The government propagated a theory which held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> felt compelled to take action after pro-Buddhist student unrest on 17–18 August. In Huế, student protestors had turned on an ARVN officer after he fired in their direction. The attacks were preceded by a large rally at Xá Lợi during which some monks had called for the overthrow of the Diệm regime and denounced the anti-Buddhist statements of the de facto first lady Madame Nhu. However, observers dismissed government claims that the raids were spontaneous.|$|E
5|$|A new {{aristocracy}} {{known as}} the Kazoku was established. It merged the ancient court nobility of the Heian period, the Kuge, and the former Daimyo, feudal lords subordinate to the Shogun. It also established the Imperial Diet, consisting of the House of Representatives and the House of Peers. Members of the House of Peers were {{made up of the}} Imperial Family, the Kazoku, and those nominated by the Emperor, while members of the House of Representatives were elected by direct male suffrage. Despite clear distinctions between powers of the executive branch and the Emperor in the Meiji Constitution, ambiguity and contradictions in the Constitution eventually led to a political crisis. It also devalued the notion of civilian control over the military, which meant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> could develop and exercise a great influence on politics.|$|E

5|$|By late December 1991, {{just over}} a month after victory had been proclaimed in Vukovar, opinion polls found that 64 percent wanted {{to end the war}} {{immediately}} and only 27 percent were willing for it to continue. Milošević and other senior Serbian leaders decided against continuing the fighting, as they saw it as politically impossible to mobilise more conscripts to fight in Croatia. Desertions from the JNA continued as the well-motivated and increasingly well-equipped Croatian Army became more difficult to counter. By the end of 1991, Serbia's political and military leadership concluded that it would be counter-productive to continue the war. The looming conflict in Bosnia also required <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> resources tied up in Croatia be freed for future use.|$|E
5|$|Fogleman's {{investigation}} led {{to several}} of the officers involved in the incident receiving further administrative discipline. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) subsequently refused U.S. Senate subpoenas for four USAF officers {{to be interviewed for}} the Senate investigation, which was never publicly released. The U.S. House investigation, conducted in part by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> investigative and judicial systems had operated mostly as designed, but also noted that the DoD had refused access to key witnesses.|$|E
5|$|Fonda argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> {{campaign}} in Iraq will turn {{people all over}} the world against America, and asserted that a global hatred of America would result in more terrorist attacks in the aftermath of the war. In July 2005, Fonda announced plans to make an anti-war bus tour in March 2006 with her daughter and several families of military veterans, saying that some war veterans she had met while on her book tour had urged her to speak out against the Iraq War. She later canceled the tour due to concerns that she would divert attention from Cindy Sheehan's activism.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{measures}} the deterrence and substitution effects of <b>the</b> <b>military's</b> drug testing program. Data used {{is from the}} 1995 and 1980 versions of the Department of Defense "Survey of Health Related Behaviors Among <b>Military</b> Personnel" and <b>the</b> 1995 and 1979 versions of the "National Household Survey on Drug Abuse. " The statistical analyses examine three separate but related topics: (1) The deterrence effect of <b>the</b> <b>military's</b> drug prevention programs; (2) The possible substitution of legal for illegal substances; and (3) The role of selection bias in estimates of the deterrence effect. <b>The</b> results indicate <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military's</b> drug testing program is a deterrence to illicit drug use. The results also provide evidence <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military's</b> drug testing program produces an unanticipated positive effect of reducing heavy alcohol consumption. Lastly, results of our analysis indicate {{that there is no}} selection bias; individuals who are likely to choose military service would not be less prone to use illicit drugs than their civilian counterparts {{in the absence of the}} testing program.

50|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{strengthen}} Parliament’s supervision over <b>the</b> <b>military’s</b> budget concerning defense expenditures, the government initiated amendments to the Law on Public Financial Management and Control in 2003. Though there are still difficulties in implementing these amendments, the change established a new base for full parliamentary oversight of defense expenditures.

5|$|Having {{learned that}} Obote was {{planning}} to arrest him for misappropriating army funds, Amin seized power in a military coup on 25 January 1971, while Obote was attending a Commonwealth summit meeting in Singapore. Troops loyal to Amin sealed off Entebbe International Airport and took Kampala. Soldiers surrounded Obote's residence and blocked major roads. A broadcast on Radio Uganda accused Obote's government of corruption and preferential treatment of the Lango region. Cheering crowds were reported {{in the streets of}} Kampala after the radio broadcast. Amin announced that he was a soldier, not a politician, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> government would remain only as a caretaker regime until new elections, which would be announced when the situation was normalised.

Additionally, Elmi stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> had implemented a new biometric registration system, wherein each recently trained and armed soldier is photographed and fingerprinted. By the end of 2014, 17,000 national army soldiers and police officers had registered for the new biometric remuneration system. 13,829 SNA soldiers and 5,134 Somali Police Force officials were biometrically registered in the system as of May 2015.|$|E

Alley suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> should retreat back to the barracks at Camp Ghezo and leave Dahomeyan politics to the career politicians. The view was unpopular, and he was outvoted by his military comrades. Alley eventually became little more than Kouandété's mouthpiece.|$|E

5|$|Kouandété {{launched}} another coup against Soglo on December 17, but he {{was forced}} to hand power to Alley two days later. His administration oversaw {{the creation of a new}} constitution and a presidential election, Dahomey's first since 1964. The results were annulled because of a boycott that prevented almost three-quarters of the country from voting. Alley lost popularity with the suggestion <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> should retreat back to the barracks, and was eventually reduced to a mouthpiece for Kouandété. On July 17, 1968, Alley was forced to hand power to Emile Zinsou, a veteran politician.|$|E

Instead of sleeping in the bedroom, he decides to sleep downstairs in an easy chair and watch pornography. When he is awoken by Joanne, he mumbles Scully's name. While changing his clothes, Mulder receives {{a telephone call from}} Smoodge, who explains <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> has surveyed the wreckage of the craft from the night before, finding one of the human pilots merged into a rock but still alive.

Each officer and cell would be given orders and would commence {{as soon as the}} shelling of al-Badr's palace began. Key areas that would be secured included Al-Bashaer palace (al-Badr's palace), Al-Wusul palace (Reception area for dignitaries), the radio station, the telephone exchange, Qasr al-Silaah (The Main Armory), and the central security headquarters (Intelligence and Internal Security).|$|E
50|$|Whether reform {{from within}} {{is a better}} {{solution}} than disassociation: Many who agree that there are problems in <b>the</b> <b>military</b> argue <b>that</b> these will be better solved if those who recognize them as problems gain influence in <b>the</b> <b>military</b> rather than avoiding it. Others argue in response <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military's</b> problems are structural, and that its disciplinary hierarchy prevents successful internal pressure. This debate occurs mostly in narrower contexts, such as debates about whether left-wing activists should join <b>the</b> <b>military</b> or whether universities in the U.S. should have ROTC programs, rather than in discussions of general enlistment.|$|R
