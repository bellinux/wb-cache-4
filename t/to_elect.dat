5|$|At {{the start}} of the conclave, electors from the zelanti faction {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>elect</b> Giuseppe Renato Imperiali, but this was not possible because of his unpopularity with both France and Spain.

The electors were confident that they would be able <b>to</b> <b>elect</b> him, because more cardinals were arriving to participate in the conclave, and it became public in Rome that Piazza was likely to be the new pope. Albani did not support this because he had not {{been a part of the}} negotiations despite being the original elector to suggest Piazza, and undermined his election by proposing Vincenzo Orsini as an alternate candidate.|$|E

5|$|The {{cardinals}} then attempted <b>to</b> <b>elect</b> Vidoni again, but Chigi was now {{opposed to}} {{him out of}} anger at the French for excluding d'Elci.

The Spanish then attempted <b>to</b> <b>elect</b> Benedetto Odescalchi, but d'Ailly declared that no one would be allowed to be elected unless they owed loyalty to Louis XIV.

5|$|Gilbert Foliot's letters {{provide some}} {{background}} to Chesney's election, showing that King Stephen of England and Stephen's brother Henry of Blois, the Bishop of Winchester, attempted to secure Lincoln {{for one of}} their relatives: the royal candidates were the abbots of Fécamp, Westminster, and St Benet's of Hulme. They were rejected by Pope Eugene III, {{paving the way for}} the chapter <b>to</b> <b>elect</b> Chesney. Foliot relates that the electors from the chapter travelled to London, where they proceeded <b>to</b> <b>elect</b> Chesney in front of Foliot, Theobald, and some other bishops. That account is contradicted by Chesney's profession of obedience to Theobald, which claims that the election took place on 13December 1148 at Westminster. Henry of Huntingdon and Ralph de Diceto, both medieval chroniclers, approved of the election and mentioned the unanimous nature of Chesney's selection. That Chesney's brother William was a firm supporter of Stephen's probably helped reconcile Stephen and his brother to Chesney's election.|$|E
