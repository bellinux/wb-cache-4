2500|$|Gradient elution {{decreases}} {{the retention of}} the later-eluting components so that they elute faster, giving narrower (and taller) peaks for most components. This also improves the peak shape for tailed peaks, as the increasing concentration of the organic eluent pushes the tailing part of a peak forward. This also increases the peak height (the peak looks [...] "sharper"), which is important in <b>trace</b> <b>analysis.</b> The gradient program may include sudden [...] "step" [...] increases {{in the percentage of}} the organic component, or different slopes at different times – all according to the desire for optimum separation in minimum time.|$|E
2500|$|The pulses {{generated}} by the detector are processed by pulse-shaping amplifiers. It takes time for the amplifier to shape the pulse for optimum resolution, and there is therefore a trade-off between resolution and count-rate: long processing time for good resolution results in [...] "pulse pile-up" [...] in which the pulses from successive photons overlap. Multi-photon events are, however, typically more drawn out in time (photons did not arrive exactly at the same time) than single photon events and pulse-length discrimination can thus be used to filter most of these out. Even so, {{a small number of}} pile-up peaks will remain and pile-up correction should be built into the software in applications that require <b>trace</b> <b>analysis.</b> To make the most efficient use of the detector, the tube current should be reduced to keep multi-photon events (before discrimination) at a reasonable level, e.g. 5–20%.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In this paper, {{we present}} a topic level {{expertise}} search framework for heterogeneous networks. Different from the traditional Web search engines that perform retrieval and ranking at document level (or at object level), we investigate the problem of expertise search at topic level over heterogeneous networks. In particular, we study this problem in an academic search and mining system, which extracts and integrates the academic data from the distributed Web. We present a unified topic model to simultaneously model topical aspects of different objects in the academic network. Based on the learned topic models, we investigate the expertise search problem from three dimensions: ranking, citation <b>tracing</b> <b>analysis,</b> and topical graph search. Specifically, we propose a topic level random walk method for ranking the different objects. In citation <b>tracing</b> <b>analysis,</b> we aim to uncover how a piece o...|$|R
