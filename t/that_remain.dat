5|$|Within {{parallel}} computing, {{there are}} specialized parallel devices <b>that</b> <b>remain</b> niche areas of interest. While not domain-specific, {{they tend to}} be applicable to only a few classes of parallel problems.|$|E
5|$|Abilities are {{classified}} into action and support categories. Action abilities consume magic points (MP) and include magic spells and special moves {{that are used}} in battle. Support abilities provide functions <b>that</b> <b>remain</b> in effect indefinitely and must be equipped with magic stones to be functional. The maximum number of these stones increases as the characters level up.|$|E
5|$|Alligators {{have created}} a niche in wet prairies. With their claws and snouts they dig at low spots and create ponds free of {{vegetation}} <b>that</b> <b>remain</b> submerged throughout the dry season. Alligator holes are integral {{to the survival of}} aquatic invertebrates, turtles, fish, small mammals, and birds during extended drought periods. The alligators then feed upon some of the animals that come to the hole.|$|E

5|$|American crows are {{socially}} monogamous cooperative breeding birds. Mated pairs form large families {{of up to}} 15 individuals from several breeding seasons <b>that</b> <b>remain</b> together for many years. Offspring from a previous nesting season will usually remain with the family to assist in rearing new nestlings. American crows do not reach breeding age {{for at least two}} years. Most do not leave the nest to breed for four to five years.|$|E
5|$|As {{noted by}} Pavel Alexandrov and Hermann Weyl in their obituaries, Noether's {{contributions}} to topology illustrate her generosity with ideas and how her insights could transform entire fields of mathematics. In topology, mathematicians study {{the properties of}} objects <b>that</b> <b>remain</b> invariant even under deformation, properties such as their connectedness. A common joke is that a topologist cannot distinguish a donut from a coffee mug, since they can be continuously deformed into one another.|$|E

They have a 2000-seat stadium {{to the south}} of the town and are the only team besides the England {{national}} football team to wear the 3 lions badge. The King George V playing fields are all <b>that</b> <b>remain</b> of the Mount Field, which in 1876 hosted a first-class match between Kent and Hampshire County Cricket Club.|$|E
5|$|Finite {{symmetry}} {{groups such}} as the Mathieu groups are used in coding theory, which is in turn applied in error correction of transmitted data, and in CD players. Another application is differential Galois theory, which characterizes functions having antiderivatives of a prescribed form, giving group-theoretic criteria for when solutions of certain differential equations are well-behaved. Geometric properties <b>that</b> <b>remain</b> stable under group actions are investigated in (geometric) invariant theory.|$|E
5|$|In {{the study}} of natural selection, the {{population}} of Soay sheep <b>that</b> <b>remain</b> {{on the island of}} Hirta have been used to explore the relation of body size and coloration to reproductive success. Soay sheep come in several colors, and researchers investigated why the larger, darker sheep were in decline; this occurrence contradicted the rule of thumb that larger members of a population tend to be more successful reproductively. The feral Soays on Hirta are especially useful subjects because they are isolated.|$|E

5|$|Organisations <b>that</b> <b>remain</b> {{critical}} of Edinburgh Zoo's work include the Animal Liberation Front, who have voiced their distaste {{for the quality}} of the enclosure that formerly housed polar bears. The Born Free Foundation has also stated several times that the zoo fails in its conservation work, as well as opposing the zoo's plans to house elephants.|$|E
5|$|Splash dams, greased chutes, {{railroad}} landings, railroad {{branch lines}} and steam donkey operations {{were among the}} strategies utilized to exploit the watershed's resources of timber. Unfortunately, railroad embankments and fills used to build up tributaries had artificially straightened them in the process, and erosion increased dramatically on the barren hillside, causing many streams to become much siltier than they naturally would be. Nearly all the old-growth forest in the watershed is now gone, and the forests <b>that</b> <b>remain</b> are mostly second-growth stands.|$|E

5|$|The {{launch of}} the first weather satellite, TIROS-I, in 1960, {{introduced}} new forecasting techniques <b>that</b> <b>remain</b> important to tropical cyclone forecasting to the present. In the 1970s, buoys were introduced to improve the resolution of surface measurements, which until that point, were not available at all over sea surfaces.|$|E
5|$|The scuttling {{was carried}} out on 21 June 1919. Intervening British guard ships were able to beach {{a number of the}} ships, but 52 of the 74 interned vessels sank.
