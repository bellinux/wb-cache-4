40|$|Metrology and Tooling are {{considered}} as discrete disciplines within Manufacturing Engineering, however, assembly tooling often {{acts as a}} checking mechanism. Assembly tooling has the primary function of controlling part location during assembly; with a secondary requirement as a quality gate. In-tool checks are manual mechanical checks of the assembly, these gauging checks assume the tooling has the correct, nominal geometry. Tooling conformance is certified periodically; however these intervals can be up to three years. Further examination of the metrology requirements within the aerospace industry with respect to large scale assembly tooling identify a requirement to: reduce manual metrology checks, reduce tooling recertification time, and enable greater automation. Currently, {{there is a lack}} of integration between metrology and Wing-box assembly tooling. This research investigates how to increase manufacturing confidence with respect to tooling conformance; and, ultimately improve the manufacturing process for aero-structures, through the increased and enhanced use of metrology in the assembly tooling environment. The Metrology Enhanced Tooling for Aerospace (META) framework has been created to provide a robust framework for deploying metrology in the tooling environment. The major elements of the framework are subsequently detailed and demonstrated in three chapters: i) large volume metrology networks, for the measurement of tooling structures; testing instrument performance, quantifying and improving the uncertainty estimation, and ultimately, establishing a rapid measurement process for assembly tooling; ii) embedded metrology systems demonstrates how local measurement systems can be utilised to replace and improve on, traditional in-tool checks; and iii) metrology feedback presents an example of an automated <b>tooling</b> <b>pick-up</b> that manipulates the assembly to achieve the design intent. The contributions can be summarised as: firstly, the creation of the META framework for the deployment of metrology in assembly tooling environment, accommodating and facilitating a number of the future tooling and assembly requirements. Secondly, the establishment of a generic commissioning methodology and measurement strategy for the rapid measurement of assembly tooling to increase tooling confidence. The research output was demonstrated in a case study, through a combination of physical measurement and digital automation simulation to prove the process time was greatly decreased from current methods...|$|E

40|$|Study question: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{establish}} the usefulness of an oocyte retrieval simulator (PICKUPSIM, Accurate srl) for training gynaeco- logists in basic oocyte pick-up techniques. Summary answer: The PICKUPSIM proves to be an adequate and safe train- ing <b>tool</b> for oocyte <b>pick-up,</b> for both novice and non-novice gynaecologists. What is known already: Oocyte retrieval is a common surgical procedure in assisted reproduction treatment. Standard practice is currently to perform a rec- ommended number of procedures under supervision, until the trainee reaches proficiency, but this approach is not tailored on the individual nor safe for the patient. On the contrary, simulator-based training may provide a safe and con- trolled environment for learning basic skills. Study design, size, duration: Prospective, single-centre study at Ferrara Uni- versity Hospital including a total of 13 participants (5 “non novices,” account- ing for Group A and 8 “novices” accounting for Group B) who performed two simulation sessions 1 week apart from each other. Participants/materials, setting, methods: The PICKUPSIM is a box simu- lator, equipped with a transvaginal probe, a needle and a foot pedal pump for aspiration of the follicles. The haptic feedback simulates the resistance to pene- tration of the soft tissues traversed by the Ovum Aspiration Needle, in particular the ovarian surface and the ovarian follicle. Scenarios are based on real clinical images and displayed on a wide-view monitor. The participants also completed a questionnaire on the training system. Main results and the role of chance: The non-novices (Group A) aspired a significantly higher number of follicles in the first try, but proved to be generally slower than the novices (Group B). As to the second try, Group A showed better results in terms of time, while keeping constant the average number of aspired follicles. The novices significantly increased the average number of follicles aspired, reaching results comparable to those of Group A and slightly reduced the medium time needed to complete the procedure. Overall, the two groups improved their performances both in terms of time and efficiency. Most of the participants (81. 8...|$|R
