5|$|Iguanodon gives {{its name}} to the unranked clade Iguanodontia, a very populous group of ornithopods with many species known from the Middle Jurassic to the Late Cretaceous. Aside from Iguanodon, the best-known members of the clade include Dryosaurus, Camptosaurus, Ouranosaurus, and the duck-bills, or hadrosaurs. In older sources, Iguanodontidae was shown as a {{distinct}} family.

In practice, animals like Callovosaurus, Camptosaurus, Craspedodon, Kangnasaurus, Mochlodon, Muttaburrasaurus, Ouranosaurus, and Probactrosaurus were usually assigned to this family.|$|E

25|$|BPR is {{different}} from other approaches to organization development (OD), especially the continuous improvement or TQM movement, {{by virtue of its}} aim for fundamental and radical change rather than iterative improvement.

For being able to reap the achievable benefits fully, the use of information technology (IT) is conceived as a major contributing factor. While IT <b>traditionally</b> <b>has</b> been used for supporting the existing business functions, i.e. it was used for increasing organizational efficiency, it now plays a role as enabler of new organizational forms, and patterns of collaboration within and between organizations.|$|E
