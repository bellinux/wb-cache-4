5|$|Washington {{is in the}} {{northern}} part of <b>the</b> <b>humid</b> subtropical climate zone (Köppen: Cfa) However, under the Trewartha climate classification, the city has a temperate maritime climate (Do). Winters are usually chilly with light snow, and summers are hot and humid. The District is in plant hardiness zone 8a near downtown, and zone 7b elsewhere in the city, indicating a humid subtropical climate.|$|E
5|$|Aarhus is in <b>the</b> <b>humid</b> {{continental}} climate zone (Köppen: Dfb) {{and the weather}} is influenced by low-pressure systems from the Atlantic which result in unstable conditions throughout the year. Temperature varies a great deal across the seasons with a mild spring in April and May, warmer summer months from June to August, frequently rainy and windy autumn months in October and September and cooler winter months, often with snow and frost, from December to March. The city centre experiences the same climatic effects as other larger cities with higher wind speeds, more fog, less precipitation and higher temperatures than the surrounding, open land.|$|E
5|$|Buenos Aires {{is located}} in <b>the</b> <b>humid</b> {{subtropical}} climate zone (Köppen climate classification: Cfa). Due to the maritime influences from the adjoining Atlantic Ocean, its climate is temperate with extreme temperatures (both hot and cold) being rare. Thus, cold air coming directly from the south are moderated by the Atlantic Ocean and warmer than winds from the southwest (which are not moderated by it).|$|E

5|$|The title monster was {{designed}} by production designer Richard Cassarino, who created the suit for $500, and was built over a diver's wetsuit. Conditions inside the suit were very hot; combined with <b>the</b> <b>humid</b> weather, this caused Clarke, who performed his own stunts in the film, to sweat profusely. The original mask is currently owned by archivist and occasional actor Bob Burns. Cassarino later worked as production designer for the 1958 film Hell Squad, and also was responsible for designing the sea creature costume in the science fiction film Destination Inner Space (1966).|$|E

5|$|Utica has a {{continental}} climate with four distinct seasons {{and is in}} <b>the</b> <b>humid</b> continental climate (or warm-summer climate: Köppen Dfb) zone, characterized by cold winters and temperate summers. Summer daytime temperatures range from 70–82°F (21-28°C), with an average winter daytime temperature below -3°C (27°F). The city is in USDA plant hardiness zone 5a, and native vegetation can tolerate temperatures from -10°F to -20°F (-28.9°C to -26.1°C).|$|E
5|$|Southern Manitoba (including {{the city}} of Winnipeg), falls into <b>the</b> <b>humid</b> {{continental}} climate zone (Köppen Dfb). This area is cold and windy {{in the winter and}} has frequent blizzards because of the open landscape. Summers are warm with a moderate length. This region is the most humid area in the prairie provinces, with moderate precipitation. Southwestern Manitoba, though under the same climate classification as the rest of Southern Manitoba, is closer to the semi-arid interior of Palliser's Triangle. The area is drier and more prone to droughts than other parts of southern Manitoba. This area is cold and windy in the winter and has frequent blizzards due to the openness of the prairie landscape. Summers are generally warm to hot, with low to moderate humidity.|$|E
5|$|The bobcat is an {{adaptable}} animal. It prefers woodlands—deciduous, coniferous, or mixed—but {{unlike the}} other Lynx species, it does not depend exclusively on the deep forest. It ranges from <b>the</b> <b>humid</b> swamps of Florida to desert lands of Texas or rugged mountain areas. It makes its home near agricultural areas, if rocky ledges, swamps, or forested tracts are present; its spotted coat serves as camouflage. The population of the bobcat depends primarily on the population of its prey; other principal factors {{in the selection of}} habitat type include protection from severe weather, availability of resting and den sites, dense cover for hunting and escape, and freedom from disturbance.|$|E

5|$|All such {{episodes of}} severe drought {{correlate}} with El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. El Niño-related droughts {{have also been}} implicated in periodic declines in Indian agricultural output. Nevertheless, ENSO events that have coincided with abnormally high sea surfaces temperatures in the Indian Ocean—in one instance during 1997 and 1998 by up to —have resulted in increased oceanic evaporation, resulting in unusually wet weather across India. Such anomalies have occurred during a sustained warm spell {{that began in the}} 1990s. A contrasting phenomenon is that, instead of the usual high pressure air mass over the southern Indian Ocean, an ENSO-related oceanic low pressure convergence centre forms; it then continually pulls dry air from Central Asia, desiccating India during what should have been <b>the</b> <b>humid</b> summer monsoon season. This reversed air flow causes India's droughts. The extent that an ENSO event raises sea surface temperatures in the central Pacific Ocean influences the extent of drought.|$|E
5|$|Armour {{has been}} {{employed}} in battles in Japan since the Yayoi period. Some {{of the oldest}} extant items from the 4th to the 7th centuries were excavated from kofun and have been designated as archaeological National Treasures. These ancient armours were of two types: a tight fitting solid plate cuirass (tankō) and a skirted lamellar type (keikō), both believed {{to be based on}} Chinese or Korean prototypes. This list includes more recent pieces of armour, developed as result of a trend toward (lamellar) scale armour that began in Japan in the 6th to the 7th centuries and matured in the mid-Heian period (9th to 10th centuries). Combining materials such as leather and silk with iron or steel parts, these armours had the advantage of being light, flexible, foldable and shock absorbent. They were generally lacquered to protect them from <b>the</b> <b>humid</b> climate and were used widely from the late Heian period to the mid-14th century. A complete set consisted of a helmet, mask, neck guard, throat protector, breastplate with shoulder guards, sleeve armour, skirt, greaves, shoes and a pennant attached to the back.|$|E
5|$|At 8:00pm the Japanese {{sent two}} Type 95 tanks with bright {{headlights}} into the plantation. The {{men from the}} 2/10th tried to disable them with sticky bombs, but due to <b>the</b> <b>humid</b> conditions the bombs failed {{to adhere to the}} Japanese armour. In the fighting that followed over the course of two and a half hours, the Australians suffered heavy casualties. Receiving indirect fire support from the 2/5th Field Regiment's 25 pounder guns situated near Gili Gili, they repelled four frontal attacks. However, by midnight the Japanese were inside the Australian position and in the confusion the 2/10th withdrew in some disorder to a number of scattered positions on {{the west bank of the}} Gama, which they reached by about 2:00am on 28 August. A further assault, however, by tank-mounted infantry forced them back further, moving back through the 61st and 25th Infantry Battalions towards No. 3 Airstrip, which was still under construction, south of Kilarbo. During the brief engagement around KB Mission, they had lost 43 men killed and another 26 wounded.|$|E
5000|$|Geologic {{evidence}} {{from the beginning and}} end of <b>the</b> African <b>Humid</b> Period suggests that both the onset and termination of <b>the</b> African <b>Humid</b> Period were abrupt. In fact both events likely occurred on a timescale of decades to centuries. The onset and termination of <b>the</b> African <b>Humid</b> Period both occurred when the insolation cycle reached a value of roughly 4.2% higher than today. However, shifts in the insolation cycle are too gradual to cause abrupt climate transitions like those seen at the onset and termination of <b>the</b> African <b>Humid</b> Period all on their own. So to account for these rapid shifts in the climate of the Sahara, several nonlinear feedback mechanisms have been proposed. One of the most common sets of nonlinear feedback mechanisms considered, are vegetation-atmosphere interactions. Computer models looking at vegetation-atmosphere interactions and insolation across North Africa have shown the ability to simulate the rapid transitions between [...] "green Sahara" [...] and [...] "desert Sahara" [...] regimes. Thus the results from these models suggest the possible existence of a vegetation-insolation threshold, which if reached, allows the Sahara region to rapidly transition from [...] "green Sahara" [...] to [...] "desert Sahara" [...] and vice versa.|$|R
