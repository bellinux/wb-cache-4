[...] He added that [...] "Many possibilities come <b>to</b> <b>mind.</b> <b>A</b> process of dialogue has started that gives signs of hope between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Is it a reaction to that or not? I don't know." ...|$|E
500|$|Robert Koehler of Variety {{gave the}} film a {{negative}} review, saying [...] "cooking up new Rube Goldberg torture contraptions isn't {{enough to get}} Saw II out of the shadow of its unnerving predecessor". Gregory Kirschling of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B minus, saying [...] "Saw II is just barely a better B flick than Saw" [...] and that both films are [...] "more clever and revolting than they are actually chilling". He praised Bell's performance as Jigsaw, saying [...] "As the droopy-lidded maniac in the flesh, Tobin Bell is, for all the film's gewgaws, Saw II sturdiest horror, a Terence Stamp look-alike who calls <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> <b>a</b> seedy General Zod lazily overseeing the universe from his evildoer's lair". [...] He ended his review: [...] "Where Saw II lags behind in Saw's novelty, it takes the lead with its smoother landing, which is again primed to blow the movie wide open, but manages a more compelling job of it than the original's cheat finish".|$|E
500|$|His {{hallmark}} was his raw {{voice and}} ability to convey strong emotion. Richie Unterberger of Allmusic noted his [...] "hoarse, gritty vocals, brassy arrangements, an emotional way with both party tunes and aching ballads." [...] In the book Rock and Roll: An Introduction, authors Michael Campbell and James Brody suggested that [...] "Redding's singing calls <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> <b>a</b> fervent black preacher. Especially in up-tempo numbers, his singing is more than impassioned speech but less than singing with precise pitch." [...] According to the book, [...] "Redding finds a rough midpoint between impassioned oratory and conventional singing. His delivery overflows with emotion" [...] in his song [...] "I Can't Turn You Loose". Booker T. Jones described Redding's singing as energetic and emotional, but said that his vocal range was limited, reaching neither low nor high notes. Peter Buckley, in The Rough Guide to Rock, describes his [...] "gruff voice, which combined Sam Cooke's phrasing with a brawnier delivery" [...] and later suggested he [...] "could testify like a hell-bent preacher, croon like a tender lover or get down and dirty with a bluesy yawp".|$|E

5000|$|The {{story of}} Amtrak waste {{disposal}} brings <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> <b>an</b> amusing song of 40 to 50 years ago. I {{have no idea}} who wrote the lyrics but they were sung to the tune of Dvorak's 'Humoresque.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Much of the sonnet {{seems to}} be focused on a debate as to whether the old style or the new is superior. In fact, the opening lines stating that [...] "If there be nothing new, but that which is Hath been before…" [...] call <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> <b>a</b> similar passage that would have far {{outdated}} Shakespeare, but that would have been familiar to most learned men of his day. In the biblical book of Ecclesiastes, chapter 1, verse 9, it is written that [...] "The thing that hath been is that which shall be; and that which hath been done is that which shall be done; and there is no new thing under the sun." ...|$|E
2500|$|More {{is known}} about Phrynichus. He won his first {{competition}} between 511 BC and 508 BC. He produced tragedies on themes and subjects later exploited in the golden age such as the Danaids, Phoenician Women and Alcestis. He was the first poet we know of to use a historical subject – his Fall of Miletus, produced in 493-2, chronicled {{the fate of the}} town of Miletus after it was conquered by the Persians. Herodotus reports that [...] "the Athenians made clear their deep grief for the taking of Miletus in many ways, but especially in this: when Phrynichus wrote a play entitled [...] "The Fall of Miletus" [...] and produced it, the whole theatre fell to weeping; they fined Phrynichus a thousand drachmas for bringing <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> <b>a</b> calamity that affected them so personally and forbade the performance of that play forever." [...] He is also thought {{to be the first to}} use female characters (though not female performers).|$|E
2500|$|With his {{adaptation}} of Tekkonkinkreet Arias, with Production Designer Shinji Kimura, had re-imagined the manga's Treasure Town as a chaotic pan-Asian hybrid, part Hong Kong, part Bombay, with futuristic and industrial elements densely layered over {{a foundation that}} borrowed much from images of Shōwa-era Tokyo. New York Times critic Manohla Dargis, in her review of Tekkonkinkreet, describes Treasure Town as [...] "a surreal explosion of skewed angles, leaning towers, hanging wires, narrow alleys and gaudily cute flourishes that bring <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> <b>a</b> yakuza cityscape {{by way of a}} Hello Kitty theme park." [...] Indeed, Tekkons sumptuous art direction was widely praised, with Production Designer Kimura receiving the Best Art Direction award at the 2008 Tokyo International Anime Fair. Tekkon was further lauded, not only for Arias' innovative use of computer graphics techniques and seamless integration of digital and traditional animation, but also for the film's handmade, documentary-style approach to storytelling. After an early Tekkon screening at the Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival, filmjourney.org editor Doug Cummings elaborated: ...|$|E
50|$|Thematically, {{the poem}} belongs among those poems {{treating}} absence or separation. Hilton Landry groups the sonnet with others, such as 54 and 55, {{in which the}} speaker is forced <b>to</b> call <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> <b>an</b> inferior mental substitute for his absent beloved.|$|R
50|$|The {{conductor}} Ernest Ansermet {{remarked that}} this movement called <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> <b>an</b> aria of Bach {{while at the}} same time seeming quite modern. The Allegro vivace finale features a series of solos, effectively a sonata rondo before the coda for full orchestra.|$|R

2500|$|Priming {{effects can}} be found {{with many of the}} tests of {{implicit}} memory. Tests such as the word-stem completion task, and the word fragment completion task measure perceptual priming. In the word-stem completion task, participants are given a list of study words, and then asked to complete word [...] "stems" [...] consisting of 3 letters with the first word that comes <b>to</b> <b>mind.</b> <b>A</b> priming effect is observed when participants complete stems with words on the study list more often than with novel words. The word fragment completion task is similar, but instead of being given the stem of a word, participants are given a word with some letters missing. The lexical decision task can be used to demonstrate conceptual priming. In this task, participants are asked to determine if a given string is a word or a nonword. Priming is demonstrated when participants are quicker to respond to words that have been primed with semantically-related words, e.g., faster to confirm [...] "nurse" [...] as a word when it is preceded by [...] "doctor" [...] than when it is preceded by [...] "butter". Other evidence has been found through brain imaging and studies from brain injured patients. Another example of priming in healthcare research was studying if safety behaviors of nurses could be primed by structuring change of shift report. A pilot simulation study found that there is early evidence to show that safety behaviors can be primed by including safety language into report.|$|E

40|$|It {{is hard to}} {{appreciate}} freedom until you experience losing it. It {{may be difficult for}} someone born in a democracy to understand, but it’s somewhat like comparing what a wild bird feels when locked in a cage, as opposed to a bird born in captivity that regards a cage as its natural environment. When I am asked about academic freedom in Iraq, it is this parallel that leaps <b>to</b> <b>mind.</b> <b>As</b> a former lecturer at the University of Baghdad who has recently completed a PhD in the UK, I have felt the difference acutely...|$|R

60|$|I cannot call <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> <b>a</b> {{reason why}} you should not think some {{passages}} in 'The Power of Sound' equal to anything I have produced.

Those little elephants were definitely walking boogie-woogie, eight to the bar. I wrote 'Baby Elephant Walk' as a result.|$|R

60|$|Since {{the reading}} of my letter, Brother Gimblet had been at {{intervals}} wiping one eye with an end of his spotted blue neckerchief, and grinning to himself.
