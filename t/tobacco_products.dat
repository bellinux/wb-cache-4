5|$|After {{returning}} to Edmonton in 1982 and {{learning of the}} lead-level findings from the 1981 expedition, Beattie struggled to find a cause. Possibilities included the lead solder used to seal the expedition's food tins, other food containers lined with lead foil, food colouring, <b>tobacco</b> <b>products,</b> pewter tableware, and lead-wicked candles. He came {{to suspect that the}} problems of lead poisoning compounded by the effects of scurvy could have been lethal for the Franklin crew. However, because skeletal lead might reflect lifetime exposure rather than exposure limited to the voyage, Beattie's theory could be tested only by forensic examination of preserved soft tissue as opposed to bone. Beattie decided to examine the graves of the buried crewmen on Beechey Island.|$|E

40|$|The Tobacco Free Initiative {{announces the}} release of a best {{practices}} report highlighting Canadian <b>tobacco</b> <b>product</b> regulation.

And most noteworthy, this best practice shows how Canada, in an effort to promote public health goals, creatively maneuvered around the limitations of the ISO smoking machine testing protocol by amending their regulation to require manufacturers to additionally test using a more intense testing regimen. Henceforth, this Canadian intense testing regimen, has since been adopted by the TobReg in its first recommendation: Guiding principles for the development of <b>tobacco</b> <b>product</b> research and testing capacity and proposed protocols for the initiation of <b>tobacco</b> <b>product</b> testing.

5|$|Aphthous {{stomatitis}} is {{uncommon in}} people who smoke, {{and there is also}} a correlation between habit duration and severity of the condition. Tobacco use is associated with an increase in keratinization of the oral mucosa. In extreme forms, this may manifest as leukoplakia or stomatitis nicotina (smoker's keratosis). This increased keratinization may mechanically reinforce the mucosa and reduce the tendency of ulcers to form after minor trauma, or present a more substantial barrier to microbes and antigens, but this is unclear. Nicotine is also known to stimulate production of adrenal steroids and reduce production of TNF-α, interleukin-1 and interleukin-6. Smokeless <b>tobacco</b> <b>products</b> also seem to protect against aphthous stomatitis. Cessation of smoking is known to sometimes precede the onset of aphthous stomatitis in people previously unaffected, or exacerbate the condition in those who were already experiencing aphthous ulceration. Despite this correlation, starting smoking again does not usually lessen the condition.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} foods and {{substances}} {{have been found}} to disturb sleep, due to stimulant effects or disruptive digestive demands. Avoiding nicotine, caffeine (including coffee, energy drinks, soft drinks, tea, chocolate, and some pain relievers), and other stimulants in the hours before bedtime is recommended by most sleep hygiene specialists, as these substances activate neurobiological systems that maintain wakefulness. Alcohol near bedtime is frequently discouraged by clinicians, because, although alcohol can induce sleepiness initially, the arousal caused by metabolizing alcohol can disrupt and significantly fragment sleep. Smoking <b>tobacco</b> <b>products</b> before bed is also thought to reduce one's quality of resting by decreasing the time spent in deep sleep, leading to sleep fragmentation and nocturnal restlessness. Both consumption of a large meal just before bedtime, requiring effort to metabolize it all, and hunger have been associated with disrupted sleep; clinicians may recommend eating a light snack before bedtime. Lastly, limiting intake of liquids before bedtime can prevent interruptions due to urinations.|$|E
5|$|After Denmark ceded Norway to Sweden in 1814, Aalborg {{lost its}} {{important}} {{role as the}} country's centre for Norwegian trade. Its former prosperity also suffered {{as a result of}} difficulties with the herring industry as the fish disappeared after the sea breached the Agger Tange (which had linked Thy with the rest of Jutland at the western end of Limfjord) in the 1825 North Sea storm. The after effects of the state bankruptcy in 1813 also contributed to widespread poverty in the city. In the mid-19th-century, Aalborg was overtaken by Aarhus as the largest city in Jutland. Towards the end of the 19th century there was however an upturn. In 1865, the pontoon bridge over Limfjord was completed, and in 1869, the railway reached the city with a railway bridge over the sound to Vendsyssel three years later. The harbour facilities were also improved, making Aalborg Denmark's second port. Aalborg became the country's main producer of <b>tobacco</b> <b>products</b> and spirits, followed in the 1890s by fertilisers and cement. By 1901, the population had increased to almost 31,500.|$|E
