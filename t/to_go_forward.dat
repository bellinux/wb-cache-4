5|$|Another {{spin-off}} starring Rainn Wilson as Dwight Schrute {{running a}} bed-and-breakfast and beet farm, titled The Farm, was proposed in early 2012. In October 2012, however, NBC decided not <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> with the series. The backdoor pilot episode instead aired {{as part of}} the ninth and final season of The Office on March 14, 2013.|$|E

In January 2017 Gaiman confirmed the miniseries will be available on Amazon Prime in 2018 and will be broadcast on the BBC after its Amazon release.|$|E

You push the joystick <b>forwards</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>forwards,</b> left <b>to</b> <b>go</b> left, right <b>to</b> <b>go</b> right and pull back to stop. Perimeter-monitoring sensors detect when a collision with a person or object is imminent and alerts the driver by emitting a noise and vibrating. At the same time, it alerts people around it of its movements through use of light and sound.|$|R

The proposal {{is not expected}} <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> due to the opposition from The Coalition and the Greens. Internet service providers Telstra and Optus have both agreed to voluntarily block some content.|$|E
5|$|Shira and Yochay remain {{distant from}} one another afterwards, and he announces {{that he plans to}} move with Mordechai to marry the widow in Belgium.

5|$|McKay {{stated that}} he {{believed}} Kimball could still serve as an apostle even if he underwent a complete laryngectomy and advised him <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> with the procedure. Martin subsequently surgically removed one of Kimball's vocal cords {{and half of the}} other, leaving him barely able to speak above a hoarse whisper. After several weeks of enforced silence, Kimball slowly recovered, and by November 1957, he was allowed by his physician to resume speaking in public. Kimball's voice remained raspy throughout the rest of his life, and he usually wore an ear-mounted microphone to help magnify his voice, even when he was speaking at normal microphone-equipped pulpits.|$|E
40|$|There {{is general}} {{agreement}} that Europe has <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>forwards</b> {{or it will}} go backwards. There are concerns that a political union, which might be necessary to save the euro, would mean a further loss of national sovereignty, and that the European Union might become a new superpower. Within national capitals, politicians have for so long blamed Europe for difficult decisions, that they feel unable to mobilise political support for any new steps towards integration...|$|R

5|$|Over {{the ensuing}} decades, the Erie Railroad fell into debt {{along with its}} competitor, the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad. On September 16, 1960, the Interstate Commerce Commission {{approved}} the railroads <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> with a merger, creating the new Erie-Lackawanna Railroad on October 15, 1960. The new railroad lasted only 16 years. In 1976, the Erie Lackawanna and several other large railroad companies were merged into the newly formed federal Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail). At this point, stations had to fight for survival. The station depot at Harriman has been closed and boarded up since at least 1970. Passenger train service, however, remained intact through the early 1980s.|$|E
5|$|A {{concurrent}} use registration, in United States trademark law, {{is a federal}} trademark registration of the same trademark to two or more unrelated parties, with each party having a registration limited to a distinct geographic area. Such a registration is achieved by filing a {{concurrent use}} application (or by converting an existing application to a concurrent use application) and then prevailing in a concurrent use proceeding before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board ("TTAB"), which is a judicial body within the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO"). A concurrent use application may be filed {{with respect to a}} trademark which is already registered or otherwise in use by another party, but may be allowed <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> based on the assertion that the existing use can co-exist with the new registration without causing consumer confusion.|$|E
5|$|Data-driven, Romney often {{played the}} role of a devil's {{advocate}} during exhaustive analysis of whether <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> with a deal. He wanted to drop a Bain Capital hedge fund that initially lost money, but other partners disagreed with him and it eventually made billions. He opted out of the Artisan Entertainment deal, not wanting to profit from a studio that produced R-rated films. Romney served {{on the board of directors}} of Damon Corporation, a medical testing company later found guilty of defrauding the government; Bain Capital tripled its investment before selling off the company, and the fraud was discovered by the new owners (Romney was never implicated). In some cases, Romney had little involvement with a company once Bain Capital acquired it.|$|E

5|$|Lody {{described}} anti-Zeppelin precautions he {{had heard}} about in London and provided details of the conversions of the Cunard Line steamships RMS Aquitania and Lusitania for their wartime service, which he had seen while in Liverpool. Once again the letter was intercepted by the British and not allowed <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> to Stockholm. Lody and Lee spent another evening in Dublin before going on a day-trip by coach to Glendalough to see the lough and the surrounding countryside. On 2 October they parted with an agreement to meet again in Killarney the following day. Lee travelled to Drogheda, where he stayed overnight, while Lody went straight to Killarney and found {{a room at the}} Great Southern Hotel (now the Malton Hotel).|$|E
5|$|The 1970 {{election}} {{included all}} of the civilian leaders of the country since independence with Apithy, Ahomadégbé, Maga, and Zinsou running against one another. The military decided to hold the elections on a staggered schedule with {{different areas of the}} country voting on different dates. This staggering meant that each of the candidates strategically tried to gain votes in later voting regions based upon the earlier results: bribery and irregularities in the election were rampant. Just before voting began in Atakora, the last department to vote which was a stronghold for Maga, Ahomadégbé supporters instigated violence to undercut turnout. Maga would have won the presidency if he had earned the most votes in Atakora, but instead of allowing the vote <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward,</b> de Souza suspended the election and immediately called on all sides to come to an agreement forming the next government.|$|E
5|$|Meeting Sweet at The Bronze, Buffy {{offers a}} deal to Sweet: she will {{take the place of}} her sister if she can’t kill him. When asked by Sweet what she thinks about life, Buffy gives her pessimistic take on its meaning ("Something to Sing About"). When the others arrive, she divulges that Willow took her from heaven, and Willow reacts with horror at finding out what she’s done. Upon divulging this truth, Buffy gives up on singing and dances so frenetically that she begins to smoke — on the verge of combusting as Sweet’s other victims have been shown to do — until Spike stops her, telling her that the only way <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> is to just keep living her life. Xander then reveals that he, not Dawn, called Sweet, hoping he would be shown a happy ending for his {{marriage}} plans. Sweet, after releasing Xander from the obligation to be Sweet's “bride”, tells the group how much fun they have been ("What You Feel—Reprise") and disappears. The Scoobies realize that their relationships have been changed irreversibly by the secrets revealed in their songs ("Where Do We Go from Here?"). Spike leaves The Bronze, but Buffy follows him out, and they kiss ("Coda").|$|E

5|$|The 1987 {{season was}} a {{disappointment}} for the Giants. They lost their first two {{games of the season}} before the 1987 NFL Players Strike. As opposed to the players strike five years previous, NFL owners made a decision <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> with replacement players. Unlike other teams such as the Washington Redskins and Houston Oilers, who made specific and elaborate plans to deal with the replacement games, the Giants made no plans. This resulted in the Giants losing all three replacement games, putting their record at 0–5 before the strike was over and the regular players returned. Though the Giants went a respectable 6–4 over their final 10 games, they were out of the playoffs at 6–9. A particular disappointment was the running game, which due to injuries to the offensive line (including tackle Karl Nelson missing the entire season due to Hodgkin's disease) struggled all season. Standouts included tight end Mark Bavaro, who led the team in catches with 55, and three of the Giants linebackers making the Pro Bowl—Taylor, Carl Banks (who was voted the team's MVP by the players), and Carson.|$|E
25|$|Reactions may {{proceed in}} the forward or reverse {{direction}} until they go to completion or reach equilibrium. Reactions that proceed {{in the forward}} direction to approach equilibrium are often described as spontaneous, requiring no input of free energy <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward.</b> Non-spontaneous reactions require input of free energy <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> (examples include charging a battery by applying an external electrical power source, or photosynthesis driven by absorption of electromagnetic radiation {{in the form of}} sunlight).|$|E

50|$|To help an AGV {{navigate}} it can use {{three different}} steer control systems. The differential speed control {{is the most}} common. In this method there are two independent drive wheels. Each drive is driven at different speeds in order to turn or the same speed to allow the AGV <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>forwards</b> or backwards. The AGV turns {{in a similar fashion}} to a tank. This method of steering is the simplest as it does not require additional steering motors and mechanism. More often than not, this is seen on an AGV that is used to transport and turn in tight spaces or when the AGV is working near machines. This setup for the wheels is not used in towing applications because the AGV would cause the trailer to jackknife when it turned.|$|R

Executive producer Brian Minchin said the series would {{try not to be}} as dark as prior Doctor Who spin-off show, Torchwood. Minchin, who was also at the same time executive director on Doctor Who itself, was asked by Radio Times why they decided to do a spin-off from Doctor Who at this particular point in time, and he answered the rationale behind the decision <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>forwards</b> with the new series was because they were so comfortable with the idea of Patrick Ness {{at the helm of the}} show.|$|R
