5|$|In {{military}} ordnance, tungsten or uranium {{is used in}} {{armour plating}} and armour piercing projectiles, {{as well as in}} nuclear weapons <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>efficiency</b> (by reflecting neutrons and momentarily delaying the expansion of reacting materials). In the 1970s, tantalum was found to be more effective than copper in shaped charge and explosively formed anti-armour weapons on account of its higher density, allowing greater force concentration, and better deformability. Less-toxic heavy metals, such as copper, tin, tungsten, and bismuth, and probably manganese (as well as boron, a metalloid), have replaced lead and antimony in the green bullets used by some armies and in some recreational shooting munitions. Doubts have been raised about the safety (or green credentials) of tungsten.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{furnaces}} {{are equipped}} {{with an array of}} supporting facilities <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>efficiency,</b> such as ore storage yards where barges are unloaded. The raw materials are transferred to the stockhouse complex by ore bridges, or rail hoppers and ore transfer cars. Rail-mounted scale cars or computer controlled weight hoppers weigh out the various raw materials to yield the desired hot metal and slag chemistry. The raw materials are brought {{to the top of the}} blast furnace via a skip car powered by winches or conveyor belts.|$|E

5|$|Hershey Creamery Company, {{also known}} as Hershey's Ice Cream, is a creamery that {{produces}} Hershey's brand ice cream, sorbet, sherbet, and frozen yogurt, and other frozen treats such as smoothies and frozen slab style ice cream mixers. Founded by Jacob Hershey and four of his brothers in 1894 (all of whom have no relation to Milton S. Hershey and the chocolate company that he founded, also in 1894), it {{was taken over by}} the Holder family in the 1920s. The company {{was one of the first}} to offer consumers pre-packaged ice cream pints. In 1998, it modernized its operations <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>efficiency</b> and reduce overhead. With their shared names and cities of origin, Hershey Creamery and Hershey Company have had a tumultuous relationship marked by multiple lawsuits over trademark issues. In the mid-1990s, the companies settled their most recent legal battles out of court, with the creamery agreeing to add a disclaimer to its ice cream products to note that it is not affiliated with The Hershey Company.|$|E

25|$|Advances in {{nanofabrication}} {{techniques and}} concerns about energy shortage make people interested in this idea. The main challenge is <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>efficiency,</b> which is now only a few percent, compared with efficiencies of up to about 95 per cent for standard rotational electromagnetic generators.|$|E
25|$|Following {{significant}} improvements in {{the efficiency of the}} steam engine in 1765, industrialization of beer became a reality. Further innovations in the brewing process came about with the introduction of the thermometer in 1760 and hydrometer in 1770, which allowed brewers <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>efficiency</b> and attenuation.|$|E
25|$|To achieve {{reductions}} in labor and dock servicing time, McLean followed Roy Fruehauf's lead and became vigilant about standardization.

25|$|Until 1994, the {{vertically}} integrated public utility, ENDE (Empresa Nacional de Electricidad) {{dominated the}} sector. In 1994, Bolivia initiated an infrastructure reform program {{that included the}} privatization of the major state owned enterprises. The Electricity Law 1994/1604 mandated the privatization of the electricity system and the unbundling of generation, transmission and distribution activities. The law aimed <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>efficiency</b> in the sector, promote competition and encourage investment.|$|E
25|$|The Australian Rail Track Corporation has {{recently}} resleepered the track with concrete sleepers, upgraded the signals and installed new loops <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>efficiency.</b> In mid-2011 they eased about 58 sections of curves on the line, increasing line speed for the XPT and freight trains. The curve easing was done without land purchases, so the track changes would be minor, staying within the existing corridor.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{government}} of Christian Democrat President Eduardo Frei, the law was amended in 1998 to promote private sector participation. The stated motive was <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>efficiency,</b> to improve service quality and to mobilize capital to extend wastewater treatment. Subsequently, all regional branches of SENDOS, {{as well as the}} water and sanitation companies of Santiago and Valparaiso, were privatized. Staffing was further reduced, new complaints management procedures were introduced and the share of collected wastewater treated increased significantly.|$|E

25|$|Refined coal is {{the product}} of a coal-upgrading {{technology}} that removes moisture and certain pollutants from lower-rank coals such as sub-bituminous and lignite (brown) coals. It is one form of several precombustion treatments and processes for coal that alter coal's characteristics before it is burned. The goals of precombustion coal technologies are <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>efficiency</b> and reduce emissions when the coal is burned. Depending on the situation, precombustion technology can be used in place of or as a supplement to postcombustion technologies to control emissions from coal-fueled boilers.|$|E
25|$|The APU (auxiliary power unit) {{does not}} need to supply bleed air when the main engines are not operating. Aerodynamics are {{improved}} {{due to the lack of}} bleed air vent holes on the wings. By driving cabin air supply compressors at the minimum required speed, no energy wasting modulating valves are required. High-temperature, high-pressure air cycle machine (ACM) packs can be replaced with low temperature, low-pressure packs <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>efficiency.</b> At cruise altitude, where most aircraft spend the majority of their time and burn the majority of their fuel, the ACM packs can be bypassed entirely, saving even more energy. Since no bleed air is taken from the engines for the cabin, the potential of engine oil contamination of the cabin air supply is eliminated.|$|E
