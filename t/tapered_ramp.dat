50|$|A crag (sometimes spelled cragg, or in Scotland craig) is a rocky hill or mountain, {{generally}} {{isolated from}} other high ground. Crags are formed when a glacier or ice sheet passes over {{an area that}} contains a particularly resistant rock formation (often a granite, volcanic plug or some other volcanic structure). The force of the glacier erodes the surrounding softer material, leaving the rocky block protruding from the surrounding terrain. Frequently the crag serves as a partial shelter to softer material {{in the wake of}} the glacier, which remains as a gradual fan or ridge forming a <b>tapered</b> <b>ramp</b> (called the tail) up the leeward side of the crag.|$|E
40|$|The {{monolithic}} integration of an ultrafast photodetector with an spot size transformer is presented. Using a shifting mask technique optimized <b>taper</b> <b>ramp</b> profiles are fabricated. The integrated devices exhibit {{a more than}} doubled responsivity (0. 7 A/W) and about one magnitude higher misalignment tolerances compared to devices without spot size converters. The ultra large bandwith (f 3 dB> 50 GHz) and the excellent high power behaviour is unimpaired by {{the integration of the}} spot size converter...|$|R
40|$|In the State of Florida, {{several types}} of exit ramps are used, {{including}} single-lane exit <b>ramp</b> with a <b>taper,</b> single-lane exit <b>ramp</b> without a <b>taper,</b> two-lane exit <b>ramp</b> with an optional lane, and two-lane exit ramp without an optional lane. Drivers exiting freeways need to make maneuver decisions (lane change, lane merge, and decelerate) prior to exit ramps in order to access cross roads at interchanges. Different exit ramp types lead to varying driving maneuvers when exiting, affecting the operational and safety performance on freeways. Based on the facts, there are several issues {{that need to be}} addressed in selecting the most optimum types of freeway exit ramps. This article mainly focuses on the comparison of operational performances of different ramp types and tries to present a method for choosing the optimal one. A data collection of 24 sites in Florida were conducted, and traffic simulations by Traffic Software Integrated System: Corridor Simulation were employed. Mathematical models were built to evaluate impacts of these ramps based on simulations. And an analytical hierarchy process method was applied to assign significance weight for all selected measures of effectiveness in terms of Florida questionnaire. Finally, an aggregate numerical evaluation was provided according to calculated data...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{investigated}} the actual truck acceleration capability at metered on-ramps. Truck acceleration performance {{data were collected}} through a video-based data collection method. A piecewise constant acceleration model was employed to capture truck acceleration characteristics. It {{was found that the}} existing acceleration length will affect truck drivers’ acceleration behavior. At the <b>taper</b> type <b>ramp</b> that has limited acceleration distance, acceleration profile indicated a decreasing trend with distance. While for the ramp with an auxiliary lane that has sufficient acceleration distance, {{it was found that the}} acceleration behavior is to have a high acceleration rate in the beginning, then acceleration rate decrease with speed increase, and high acceleration rate again as drivers approach the merging area. Field data show that the truck acceleration performance data documented in the ITE’s (Institute of Transportation Engineers) “Traffic Engineering Handbook” are much lower than the field collected data. Also, based on the regression analysis of speed versus distance profiles, it was found that the AASHTO’s (American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials) Green Book acceleration length design guidance is insufficient to accommodate trucks at metered on-ramps. The required acceleration lengths for medium and heavy trucks are approximately 1. 3 and 1. 6 times of the Green Book design guideline, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Interstate {{highways}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} important components of the transportation infrastructure in America. Freeway ramps play an important role in the whole interstate transportation system. This paper researches the traffic flow characteristics of four typical exit ramps in USA, which are tapered one-lane exit, tapered two-lane exit, parallel one-lane exit and parallel two-lane exit. Computer simulation software, such as CORSIM and HCS are applied as the main tools in this research. ANOVA and Tukey are used for statistical purpose. It compares the maximum capacity, average running speed and the total lane change number of those four exit ramps. It is found that no matter in terms of traffic discharging rate or total lane charging number; the tapered two-lane exit has the best operational performance. <b>Tapered</b> one-lane exit <b>ramp</b> has the least capacity. Parallel one-lane exit and parallel two-lane exit have very limited traffic operational difference in terms of capacity and running speed. It is recommended that parallel two-lane exit ramp should not be designed along the freeway if the right of way along arterial road is enough. It is observed from the simulation data that the grade of freeway, truck percentage, restricted to the truck use of certain lane(s) and the location of exit sign have significant impact on the running speed and total lane change number. An uphill can decrease the running speed dramatically while more truck brings more lane change, causing safety concerns. It is found that when trucks are restricted to the right two most lane, there will be less lane change number comparing with trucks are not restricted. Location of exit sign operates well at the distance between 4000 ft to 5000 ft. does have a significant impact on the operational speed and total lane change number before, within or after functional area of an exit, based on the data analysis of simulation runs...|$|R
