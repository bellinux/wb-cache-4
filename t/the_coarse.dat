5|$|Banksia grossa, {{commonly}} known as <b>the</b> <b>coarse</b> banksia, is a species of shrub in the plant family Proteaceae endemic to Southwest Australia. It is one of fourteen species of banksia of the series Abietinae, all of which bear predominantly cylindrical or oval inflorescences. Collected in 1965, it was described in 1981 by Alex George. Its thick leaves and large seeds distinguish it from {{other members of the}} Abietinae, and are the basis of its species name.|$|E

5|$|The Olympic venues were {{designed}} to reflect Norwegian culture and character. The hall was designed to play on Scandinavian folklore, such as the Hall of the Mountain King in Henrik Ibsen's Peer Gynt and the caves of fairy-tale trolls. This has for instance been emulated {{through the use of}} shotcrete on the walls to give a dark and mysterious impression. Lighting is used to create high contrast, such as from the entrance which is dark with pools of light, to the main hall which is brightly lit, to emphasize its size. The dark entrance is also used to adjust the spectators' eyes so the main hall seems brighter. A contrast has also been used between the grandstands' slender lines and <b>the</b> <b>coarse</b> finish of the cavern rock. Red was chosen as the hall's main color because of natural occurrence of red in the rock. Glass tiles are used as they give associations to ice. Ventilation, energy and other installations use shine metal, representing silver embedded in the rock. The main hall is designed as an amphitheater with close contact between spectators and athletes.|$|E

5|$|While 18thcentury metal mines {{had worked}} on the {{principle}} of adult men digging the ore and women and children picking and cobbing the ore ready for smelting, in the new large-scale mines of the early 19thcentury working practices changed. The strenuous underground work was still carried out by male workers, as was breaking large rocks with heavy hammers ('ragging'). In copper mines, very young girls, and sick and injured older women, carried out the simple work of picking. Girls in their late teens forced the broken ore through a broad mesh to sort the ore ('riddling'), and used hammers to break the large chunks of ore left by the riddling process into smaller chunks. Girls in their mid-teens cobbed the resulting chunks, separating the valuable ore from waste rock. Grown women would carry out the heavy manual labour of breaking rocks with hammers ('spalling'), of crushing sorted ore to small grains ready for smelting ('bucking') and of transporting ore between various pieces of apparatus. An experienced bal maiden working as a spaller would produce approximately one ton (2240lb; 1016kg) of broken ore per day, {{depending on the type of}} stone. In the tin mines, in which ore could be crushed far more finely than copper before smelting, cobbing and bucking did not take place. Instead, the chunks of spalled ore were mechanically stamped to fine grains, and washed into a series of collecting pits to separate <b>the</b> <b>coarse</b> 'rough' from the fine 'slimes'. The resulting rough and slimes were separated out on large wooden frames ('buddling' and 'framing' respectively), to extract the tin ore from the surrounding dust and grit.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{bentonite}} {{alone or}} amended with natural soils {{for construction of}} liners for water-retention and waste- containment facilities is very common. The importance of bentonite content in reducing the hydraulic conductivity of liners is well recognised. The study illustrates {{the role of the}} size of <b>the</b> <b>coarser</b> fraction in controlling the hydraulic conductivity of the clay liner. It has been shown that at low bentonite contents the hydraulic conductivity of the liner varies {{depending on the size of}} <b>the</b> <b>coarser</b> fraction apart from clay content. At a given clay content, the hydraulic conductivity increases with an increase in the size of <b>the</b> <b>coarser</b> fraction. But when the clay content is more than that which can be accommodated within the voids of <b>the</b> <b>coarser</b> fractions, <b>the</b> hydraulic conductivity is controlled primarily by clay content alone.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>coarse</b> outer fibers {{have been}} {{traditionally}} used by nomads to make ropes and tents.

However, the current increasing demand for the down fiber from the international market means that the fine fiber is mostly sold. The rarity of the white hair implicates that ropes made out of white and black Yarn is admired for its appearance and uniqueness. In west Sichuan, China, 34% of the animal fiber comes from yak hair alone. In Bhutan, the long hair is used for weaving tents, bags, rugs and slings, whereas in Mongolia it is used for clothing tents and bags. To obtain the optimal length, nomads comb the hair and then spin it into yarn. During this process, the loom determines {{the width of the}} tent squares and the length of the tent. The tent squares are then sewn tightly together by men.|$|E
