40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Financial Accounting)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. The {{report of}} <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> officer {{is of little}} or no value. There is {{uncertainty}} about the duties of <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> officer where there are material omissions and mistakes in <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> records and financial statements of the close corporation because the report of <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> officer must only state that the financial statements are in agreement with <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> records. Nowhere in the Close Corporation Act it is stated what the duties of <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> officer are whether he is aware or not of such mistakes or omissions. The close corporation doesn't require <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> officer to do an audit on the books and records of the close corporation, and <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> officers are therefore {{under the impression that}} they may not be held liable for all the debts of the close corporation. <b>The</b> <b>accounting</b> officer is however vulnerable as his duties in terms of the Close Corporation Act are far reaching and he cannot fulfil his duties completely unless he has done an audit, and can therefore be held liable for the debts of the close corporation. He can further be held liable for the debts of the close corporation due to the following: 7. 1 the shortcomings in the Close Corporation Act nr. 69 of 1984; 7. 2 the impracticability of the Close Corporation Act; 7. 3 the vagueness and indistinctness of certain articles in the Act that <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> officer must comply with or are exposed to; 7. 4 <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> officer may use his professional judgment to investigate <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> records of <b>the</b> close corporation, and nothing prohibits him to do so if he think it lit. If however he is of the opinion that {{it is not necessary to}} investigate <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> records, this will contribute towards <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> officer becoming liable for the debts of the close corporation, although the Act doesn't require <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> officer to do an audit on the books and records of the close corporation. In the case where <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> officer decides to investigate the books and records of the close corporation, his duties are extensive because he takes the decision to investigate. 7. 5 <b>The</b> <b>accounting</b> officer act in many cases as advisor/bookkeeper/ accountant for the CC, because of the size and nature of the entity, and by doing that, he then participates in the management of the CC and he is then vulnerable in terms of section 64 of the Close Corporation Act to be liable for all the debts of the corporation, without being <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> officer's intention to participate in the management of the close corporation. 7. 6 The powers of <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> officer are not fully addressed in the Close Corporation Act and <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> officer is not properly protected by the Act. Because of the current Close Corporations Act, the interpretation and use thereof, <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> officer is excessively vulnerable to creditors and third parties of the close corporation and he can be held liable for all the debts of the close corporation.

5|$|Bank Markazi v. Peterson, 578 U.S. ___ (2016), was a United States Supreme Court {{case that}} found that a law which only applied to a {{specific}} case, identified by docket number, and eliminated all of the defenses one party had raised does not violate {{the separation of powers}} in the United States Constitution between the legislative (Congress) and judicial branches of government. The plaintiffs in the trial court, respondents in the Supreme Court, were several parties who had obtained judgments against Iran for its role in supporting state-sponsored terrorism, particularly the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings and 1996 Khobar Towers bombing, and sought execution against a bank account in New York held, through European intermediaries, on behalf of Bank Markazi, the state-owned Central Bank of Iran. The initial plaintiffs obtained court orders preventing the transfer of funds from <b>the</b> <b>account</b> in 2008 and initiated their lawsuit in 2010. Bank Markazi raised several defenses against the execution against <b>the</b> <b>account,</b> including that <b>the</b> <b>account</b> was not an asset of the bank, but rather an asset of its European intermediary, under both New York state property law and §201(a) of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act. In response to concerns that existing laws were insufficient for <b>the</b> <b>account</b> to be used to settle the judgments, Congress included a section within a 2012 bill, codified after enactment as 22 U.S.C. §8772, that identified the pending lawsuit by docket number, applied only to the assets in the identified case, and essentially abrogated every legal basis available to Bank Markazi to prevent the plaintiffs from executing their claims against <b>the</b> <b>account.</b> Bank Markazi then argued that §8772 was an unconstitutional breach of the separation of power between the legislative and judicial branches of government, because it effectively directed a particular result in a single case without changing the generally applicable law. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and, on appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit both upheld the constitutionality of §8772 and cleared the way for the plaintiffs to execute their judgments against <b>the</b> <b>account,</b> which held about $1.75billion in cash.|$|E
