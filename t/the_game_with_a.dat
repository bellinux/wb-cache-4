5|$|Four days later, the Dukes {{were blown}} out 39–68 by #7 West Virginia. Saunders {{led the team}} with only 12points. One analyst {{attributed}} this loss to the skill of the Mountaineers, an abysmal night by star Bill Clark, {{as well as the}} continued absence of Melquan Bolding and now senior captain Jason Duty, who missed <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sprained ankle.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, the World Junior Hockey Championship was a {{round robin}} tournament. The teams {{with the top}} three records won the gold, silver and bronze medals.

Canada entered <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 4–1–1 record, and had already been assured the bronze medal. A victory against the Soviets would have guaranteed Canada the silver, and a victory by more than four goals would have won the gold medal. The Soviet Union, entering <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 2–3–1 record, had already been eliminated from medal contention. The match-up between the two squads was deliberately scheduled {{to be the final}} game of the tournament as organizers expected {{at least one of the}} teams would be playing for the gold medal.|$|E

Both James and Dickerson went on to careers in the NFL; Dickerson achieved superstar status with the Los Angeles Rams from 1983-1986, and with the Indianapolis Colts from 1987-1991. The Mustangs entered <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> 8-3 record, impressive considering they played in the tough Southwest Conference (SWC).|$|R

5|$|Defeating monsters earns the {{character}} experience points, and after earning enough points, {{the character}} will gain an experience level, improving their hit points, magic capability, and other attributes. Monsters may drop treasure to be looted. On the other hand, the character dies {{if they lose}} all their hit points. As most roguelikes feature the concept of permadeath, this represents {{the end of the}} game, and the player will need to restart <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> newly made character. Roguelikes are nearly always turn-based, with the game only reacting when the player makes an action with the character. This allows players to evaluate a difficult situation, such as being cornered by several monsters, at their own pace and determine the best strategy.|$|E
