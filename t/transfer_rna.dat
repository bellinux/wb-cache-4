5|$|Some RNA {{molecules}} play {{an active}} role within cells by catalyzing biological reactions, controlling gene expression, or sensing and communicating responses to cellular signals. One of these active processes is protein synthesis, a universal function where RNA molecules direct the assembly of proteins on ribosomes. This process uses <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> (tRNA) molecules to deliver amino acids to the ribosome, where ribosomal RNA (rRNA) then links amino acids together to form proteins.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent work by Har Gobind Khorana {{identified}} {{the rest of}} the genetic code. Shortly thereafter, Robert W. Holley determined the structure of <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> (tRNA), the adapter molecule that facilitates the process of translating RNA into protein. This work was based upon Ochoa's earlier studies, yielding the latter the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1959 for work on the enzymology of RNA synthesis.|$|E
5|$|<b>Transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> (tRNA) {{is a small}} RNA {{chain of}} about 80 {{nucleotides}} that transfers a specific amino acid to a growing polypeptide chain at the ribosomal site of protein synthesis during translation. It has sites for amino acid attachment and an anticodon region for codon recognition that binds to a specific sequence on the messenger RNA chain through hydrogen bonding.|$|E
50|$|Other genes (MT-TH, MT-TL1, and MT-TV) encode {{mitochondrial}} specific <b>transfer</b> <b>RNAs</b> (tRNAs).|$|R
50|$|The coding {{differences}} {{are thought to}} be a result of chemical modifications in the <b>transfer</b> <b>RNAs</b> that interact with the messenger RNAs produced as a result of transcribing the mtDNA sequences.|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} {{preparation}} of an ion exchange paper {{which can be used}} as a solid carrier in the <b>transfer</b> of <b>RNA</b> from gels. In addition to detection by blot hybridization to specific probes, <b>transferred</b> <b>RNA</b> can be characterized by cell-free translation in situ. Preparation of the paper is simple, inexpensive and reproducible. Examples of applications are shown and possible other applications are discussed...|$|R
5|$|A typical protein-coding gene {{is first}} copied into RNA as an {{intermediate}} {{in the manufacture of}} the final protein product. In other cases, the RNA molecules are the actual functional products, as in the synthesis of ribosomal RNA and <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA.</b> Some RNAs known as ribozymes are capable of enzymatic function, and microRNA has a regulatory role. The DNA sequences from which such RNAs are transcribed are known as non-coding RNA genes.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the length}} of RNA chain, RNA {{includes}} small RNA and long RNA. Usually, small RNAs are shorter than 200nt in length, and long RNAs are greater than 200nt long. Long RNAs, also called large RNAs, mainly include long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and mRNA. Small RNAs mainly include 5.8S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), 5S rRNA, <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> (tRNA), microRNA (miRNA), small interfering RNA (siRNA), small nucleolar RNA (snoRNAs), Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA), tRNA-derived small RNA (tsRNA) and small rDNA-derived RNA (srRNA).|$|E
5|$|In transcription, the codons {{of a gene}} are copied into {{messenger}} RNA by RNA polymerase. This RNA copy is then decoded by a ribosome {{that reads}} the RNA sequence by base-pairing the messenger RNA to <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA,</b> which carries amino acids. Since there are 4 bases in 3-letter combinations, there are 64 possible codons (43combinations). These encode the twenty standard amino acids, giving most amino acids more than one possible codon. There are also three 'stop' or 'nonsense' codons signifying {{the end of the}} coding region; these are the TAA, TGA, and TAG codons.|$|E
40|$|A conserved {{response}} to stress involves endonucleolytic cleavage of cytoplasmic <b>transfer</b> <b>RNAs</b> (tRNAs) by ribonucleases that are normally secreted or sequestered. Ribonuclease activation or release is an intriguing new aspect of cellular stress responses, {{with a potential}} impact on translation, apoptosis, cancer, and disease progression...|$|R
40|$|<b>Transfer</b> <b>RNAs</b> (tRNAs) deliver {{amino acids}} to the {{ribosome}} during mRNA translation. Gingold etÂ al. now {{provide evidence that}} alterations in the cellular tRNA repertoire are tightly coordinated with changes in mRNA expression. These changes in the tRNA repertoire dictate translational programs that distinguish differentiating from proliferating cells...|$|R

5|$|The {{genetic code}} {{is a key}} part of the story of life. The main {{hypothesis}} for life's origin is the RNA world hypothesis. Any model for the emergence of genetic code is intimately related to a model of the transfer from ribozymes (RNA enzymes) to proteins as the principal enzymes in cells. In line with the RNA world hypothesis, <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> molecules appear to have evolved before modern aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, so the latter cannot be part of the explanation of its patterns.|$|E
5|$|The {{genetic code}} is {{the set of}} rules by which {{information}} encoded within genetic material (DNA or mRNA sequences) is translated into proteins by living cells. Translation is accomplished by the ribosome, which links amino acids in an order specified by mRNA, using <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> (tRNA) molecules to carry amino acids and to read the mRNA three nucleotides at a time. The genetic code is highly similar among all organisms and can be expressed in a simple table with 64 entries.|$|E
5|$|These {{so-called}} non-coding RNAs ("ncRNA") can be encoded {{by their}} own genes (RNA genes), but can also derive from mRNA introns. The most prominent examples of non-coding RNAs are <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), {{both of which are}} involved in the process of translation. There are also non-coding RNAs involved in gene regulation, RNA processing and other roles. Certain RNAs are able to catalyse chemical reactions such as cutting and ligating other RNA molecules, and the catalysis of peptide bond formation in the ribosome; these are known as ribozymes.|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} RNA {{molecules}} {{have been found}} over the last 20 years to have a remarkable range of functions beyond the well-known roles of messenger, ribosomal and <b>transfer</b> <b>RNAs.</b> Here, we present a general categorization of all non-coding RNAs and briefly discuss the ones that affect transcription, translation and protein function...|$|R
25|$|Small {{nucleolar}} RNAs (snoRNAs) are a {{class of}} small RNA molecules that primarily guide chemical modifications of other RNAs, mainly ribosomal <b>RNAs,</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>RNAs</b> and small nuclear RNAs. There are two main classes of snoRNA, the C/D box snoRNAs, which are associated with methylation, and the H/ACA box snoRNAs, which are associated with pseudouridylation.|$|R
5000|$|... ppGpp and pppGpp {{were first}} {{identified}} by Michael Cashel in the 1960s. These nucleotides {{were found to}} accumulate rapidly in Escherichia coli cells starved for amino acids, and inhibit synthesis of ribosomal and <b>transfer</b> <b>RNAs.</b> It is now known that (p)ppGpp is also produced in response to other stressors, including carbon and phosphate starvation.|$|R
5|$|Amino acids {{are made}} into {{proteins}} by being joined {{together in a}} chain of peptide bonds. Each different protein has a unique sequence of amino acid residues: this is its primary structure. Just as {{the letters of the}} alphabet can be combined to form an almost endless variety of words, amino acids can be linked in varying sequences to form a huge variety of proteins. Proteins are made from amino acids that have been activated by attachment to a <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> molecule through an ester bond. This aminoacyl-tRNA precursor is produced in an ATP-dependent reaction carried out by an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. This aminoacyl-tRNA is then a substrate for the ribosome, which joins the amino acid onto the elongating protein chain, using the sequence information in a messenger RNA.|$|E
5|$|The first {{complete}} DNA {{sequence of}} an E. coli genome (laboratory strain K-12 derivative MG1655) {{was published in}} 1997. It {{was found to be}} a circular DNA molecule 4.6 million base pairs in length, containing 4288 annotated protein-coding genes (organized into 2584 operons), seven ribosomal RNA (rRNA) operons, and 86 <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> (tRNA) genes. Despite having been the subject of intensive genetic analysis for about 40 years, a large number of these genes were previously unknown. The coding density was found to be very high, with a mean distance between genes of only 118 base pairs. The genome was observed to contain a significant number of transposable genetic elements, repeat elements, cryptic prophages, and bacteriophage remnants.|$|E
5|$|Transcription in archaea {{more closely}} resembles {{eukaryotic}} than bacterial transcription, with the archaeal RNA polymerase being {{very close to}} its equivalent in eukaryotes; while archaeal translation shows signs of both bacterial and eukaryal equivalents. Although archaea only have one type of RNA polymerase, its structure and function in transcription seems {{to be close to}} that of the eukaryotic RNA polymerase II, with similar protein assemblies (the general transcription factors) directing the binding of the RNA polymerase to a gene's promoter. However, other archaeal transcription factors are closer to those found in bacteria. Post-transcriptional modification is simpler than in eukaryotes, since most archaeal genes lack introns, although there are many introns in their <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> and ribosomal RNA genes, and introns may occur in a few protein-encoding genes.|$|E
40|$|Studies on <b>transfer</b> <b>RNAs,</b> as {{amino acid}} {{adapters}} in protein biosynthesis, and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, as enzymes that catalyze specific aminoacylation reactions, started in Croatia {{in the laboratory}} of Professor @eljko Ku}an in the early 1970 s. This paper is {{an overview of the}} approaches and ideas that kept many of his collaborators on the same track for several decades...|$|R
2500|$|The {{genetic code}} was {{expressed}} into proteins. These were assembled from {{free amino acids}} by translation of a messenger RNA by a mechanism composed of ribosomes, <b>transfer</b> <b>RNAs,</b> {{and a group of}} related proteins. The ribosomes were composed of two subunits, one big 50S and one small 30S. [...] Each ribosomal subunit was composed of a core of ribosomal RNA surrounded by ribosomal proteins. Both types of RNA molecules (ribosomal and <b>transfer</b> <b>RNAs)</b> {{played an important role in}} the catalytic activity of the ribosomes. Only 20 amino acids were used, to the exclusion of countless other amino acids. Only the L-isomers of the amino acids were used. ATP was used as an energy intermediate. Several hundred enzymes made of protein catalyzed chemical reactions that extract energy from fats, sugars, and amino acids, and that synthesize fats, sugars, amino acids, and nucleic acid bases using arbitrary chemical pathways.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT All RNA {{species in}} yeast cells {{are subject to}} turnover. Work over the past 20 years has defined {{degradation}} mechanisms for messenger <b>RNAs,</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>RNAs,</b> ribosomal RNAs, and noncoding RNAs. In addition, numerous quality control mechanisms that target aberrant RNAs have been identified. Generally, each decay mechanism contains factors that funnel RNA substrates to abundant exo-and/or endonucleases. Key issues for future work include determining the mechanisms that control the specificity of RNA degradation and how RNA degradation processes interact with translation, RNA transport, and other cellular processes...|$|R
5|$|As {{both the}} amine and {{carboxylic}} acid groups of amino acids can {{react to form}} amide bonds, one amino acid molecule can react with another and become joined through an amide linkage. This polymerization of amino acids is what creates proteins. This condensation reaction yields the newly formed peptide bond and a molecule of water. In cells, this reaction does not occur directly; instead, the amino acid is first activated by attachment to a <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> molecule through an ester bond. This aminoacyl-tRNA is produced in an ATP-dependent reaction carried out by an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. This aminoacyl-tRNA is then a substrate for the ribosome, which catalyzes the attack of the amino group of the elongating protein chain on the ester bond. As {{a result of this}} mechanism, all proteins made by ribosomes are synthesized starting at their N-terminus and moving toward their C-terminus.|$|E
5|$|Translation is {{the process}} by which a mature mRNA {{molecule}} is used as a template for synthesizing a new protein. Translation is carried out by ribosomes, large complexes of RNA and protein responsible for carrying out the chemical reactions to add new amino acids to a growing polypeptide chain by the formation of peptide bonds. The genetic code is read three nucleotides at a time, in units called codons, via interactions with specialized RNA molecules called <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> (tRNA). Each tRNA has three unpaired bases known as the anticodon that are complementary to the codon it reads on the mRNA. The tRNA is also covalently attached to the amino acid specified by the complementary codon. When the tRNA binds to its complementary codon in an mRNA strand, the ribosome attaches its amino acid cargo to the new polypeptide chain, which is synthesized from amino terminus to carboxyl terminus. During and after synthesis, most new proteins must fold to their active three-dimensional structure before they can carry out their cellular functions.|$|E
5|$|This ring {{structure}} {{is very similar}} to that of the proteins RNase PH and PNPase. In bacteria, the protein RNase PH, which is involved in tRNA processing, forms a hexameric ring consisting of six identical RNase PH proteins. In the case of PNPase, which is a phosphorolytic RNA-degrading protein found in bacteria and the chloroplasts and mitochondria of some eukaryotic organisms, two RNase PH domains, and both an S1 and KH RNA binding domain are part of a single protein, which forms a trimeric complex that adopts a structure almost identical to that of the exosome. Because of this high similarity in both protein domains and structure, these complexes are thought to be evolutionarily related and have a common ancestor. In bacteria, a separate RNase PH protein exists that is involved in <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> processing, which has been shown to adopt a similar six-membered ring structure, but in this case consisting of 6 identical protein subunits. The RNase PH-like exosome proteins, PNPase and RNase PH all belong to the RNase PH family of RNases and are phosphorolytic exoribonucleases, meaning that they use inorganic phosphate to remove nucleotides from the 3' end of RNA molecules.|$|E

These results indicate that these RNA's are transcribed in vivo from a strand with a composition similar to that from which messenger RNA's are copied and presumably by the same mechanism...|$|R
25|$|Many {{types of}} {{transcribed}} RNA, such as <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA,</b> ribosomal RNA, and small nuclear RNA, do not undergo translation into proteins.|$|E
25|$|Every mRNA {{consists}} of three parts: a 5' untranslated region (5'UTR), a protein-coding region or open reading frame (ORF), and a 3' untranslated region (3'UTR). The coding region carries information for protein synthesis encoded by the genetic code to form triplets. Each triplet of nucleotides of the coding region is called a codon and corresponds to a binding site complementary to an anticodon triplet in <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA.</b> Transfer RNAs with the same anticodon sequence always carry an identical type of amino acid. Amino acids are then chained together by the ribosome according {{to the order of}} triplets in the coding region. The ribosome helps <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> to bind to messenger RNA and takes the amino acid from each <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> and makes a structure-less protein out of it. Each mRNA molecule is translated into many protein molecules, on average ~2800 in mammals.|$|E
