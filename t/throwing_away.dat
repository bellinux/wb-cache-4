5|$|After Dorothy's wedding {{much of the}} {{documentation}} of Olivia's life ceases. She moved out of Brunswick Gardens in 1924, <b>throwing</b> <b>away</b> personal correspondence and giving away hundreds of books. Hope Shakespear died on 5 July 1923; within months Olivia moved to an apartment in West Kensington, taking with her two maids {{who had been with}} the family for decades. Her life continued unchanged, filled with social events. In September 1926, Dorothy gave birth to a son, Omar Pound, who in 1927 was brought from France to be raised in England. Olivia became his guardian and Dorothy spent summers with her mother and son.|$|E
5|$|During {{a series}} of combats held to {{celebrate}} King Joffrey Baratheon's name day, the captive Sansa Stark saves the drunkard Ser Dontos Hollard's life by convincing Joffrey {{to make him a}} fool instead of killing him. The festivities are interrupted by the arrival of Tyrion Lannister, who has been sent to the capital to act as Hand of the King in his father's stead. Cersei is furious, but accepts the new situation after her brother assures her that he will only act as an advisor. When Tyrion learns that Cersei has let Arya Stark escape after the execution of her father, he mocks her for <b>throwing</b> <b>away</b> two valuable hostages, as he'd planned to trade the girls for Jaime.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the food}} thrown away {{could have been avoided}} (4,100,000 tonnes, 61 per cent of the total amount of food waste) and with better {{management}} could have been eaten or used. Unavoidable foods, such as vegetable peelings and tea bags, account for 19 per cent of the total, with the remaining 20 per cent being unavoidable through preferences (e.g. bread crusts) and cooking types (e.g. potato skins). However, the vast majority of consumers (90%) are unaware of the amount of food they throw away; individuals who believed that their household wasted no food were shown to be <b>throwing</b> <b>away</b> 88kg of avoidable food per year.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there were}} {{calls for a}} public competition, William Wyon's son, Leonard Charles Wyon was chosen to execute the new design. Both the Queen and Prince Albert took a keen {{interest}} in the work, and repeated visits by Wyon to Buckingham Palace and Osborne House were necessary before Victoria gave her approval. There is a tale that the Queen returned the penny sent her for final approval by post, but a postman opened the parcel, <b>throwing</b> <b>away</b> the coin in disgust when he realised all that was inside was a penny. The new bronze pieces were made current by a proclamation dated 17 December 1860, and public reaction was positive, both for Wyon's designs and for the weight, which had been halved. The new coins were widely distributed through post offices, and in 1861, the Mint began the recall of the old copper pieces, paying a small premium and for the transport. The old copper coins soon vanished from towns; progress in rural areas was more gradual. The pre-1860 copper penny was demonetised after 1869 in Britain (though accepted at full face value by the Mint until 1873) and in 1877 for the colonies.|$|E
5|$|Howard Browne, who {{had been}} on a leave of absence from Ziff-Davis to write fiction, took over as editor and began by <b>throwing</b> <b>away</b> 300,000 words of {{inventory}} that Palmer had acquired before he left. Browne had ambitions of moving Amazing upmarket, and his argument was strengthened by Street & Smith, one of the longest established and most respected publishers, who shut down all of their pulp magazines in the summer of 1949. The pulps were dying, {{largely as a result of}} the success of pocketbooks, and Street & Smith decided to concentrate on their slick magazines. Some pulps struggled on for a few more years, but Browne was able to persuade Ziff and Davis that the future was in the slicks, and they raised his fiction budget from one cent to a ceiling of five cents per word. Browne managed to get promises of new stories from many well-known authors, including Isaac Asimov and Theodore Sturgeon. He produced a dummy issue in April 1950, and planned to launch the new incarnation of Amazing in April 1951, the 25th anniversary of the first issue. However, the economic impact of the Korean War, which broke out in June 1950, led to budget cuts. The plans were cancelled, and Ziff-Davis never revived the idea.|$|E

5|$|Jigsaw then leads Tapp to the asylum's crematorium, {{where he}} informs Tapp {{that some people}} {{actually}} desire his tests, much to Tapp's surprise. At the crematorium is Obi Tate, an arsonist who had put advertisements in the newspaper seeking for Jigsaw to test him. Tapp saves him from a burning furnace, but Obi is still frustrated {{because he wanted to}} survive his own test. Feeling that Tapp is <b>throwing</b> <b>away</b> a gift from Jigsaw, Obi runs away. Tapp then ventures through a theater, where he finds evidence that a former Jigsaw victim being held there. He soon finds that it is Jeff Thomas, the man who was saved by Sing while he and Tapp were in Jigsaw's lair. Jeff has since become suicidal from Tapp's incessant questioning, and has been recaptured by Jigsaw. Tapp saves Thomas from a wall of spikes. Thomas is still frustrated, so he runs away, wounded. As this was the last victim in the asylum, Tapp is free to pursue Jigsaw, but encounters Pighead again. Jigsaw informs Tapp that Pighead wishes to surpass Jigsaw and sabotage Tapp's game, so he must be stopped. Tapp confronts and kills Pighead; Jigsaw rhetorically asks him if he's a murderer, {{in order to get a}} key to proceed.|$|E
5|$|Three {{straight}} draws {{followed in}} December, the first away to league leaders Aston Villa. United were fortunate {{to pick up}} a point given their opponents dominance in the second half, and were careless at Tottenham Hotspur, <b>throwing</b> <b>away</b> a 2–0 lead. Solskjær put United two goals ahead, but in the 39th minute Gary Neville received a red card for a second bookable offence, tugging on David Ginola's shirt. Spurs captain Sol Campbell brought his team back into the match with 20 minutes remaining and on the cusp of stoppage time powered a header in the top left-hand corner, sparking jubilant scenes at White Hart Lane. Chelsea grabbed a creditable draw at Old Trafford to stake their championship credentials four days later and United, who were without their manager Ferguson for the Middlesbrough game were beaten 3–2; their last defeat of the season. On Boxing Day the team collected three points against Nottingham Forest and merited a point at Stamford Bridge in the last match of 1998 to solidify their position in the top four.|$|E
5|$|At about 5 a.m., Parsons {{stopped at}} a Texaco service station 23 miles to the north. He was wearing Ernest's clothes and had assumed his identity. Parsons told the station {{attendant}} he needed to hose out red construction paint from the car's interior and offered to give him Ernest's construction tools. The attendant said that he observed Parsons <b>throwing</b> <b>away</b> clothing, books, posters and carpentry tools into a dumpster. Parsons asked the attendant about the distance to Denver and spoke of Ernest's 9-year-old son as his own. He purchased cigarettes and food with Ernest's MasterCard credit card before leaving. At 7:23 a.m., Parsons used the credit card to check into a Quality Inn at Richfield, Utah. He used the card again at about 10 a.m. to purchase seat covers and floor mats from Kmart {{to cover up the}} blood stains in the car. A clerk called the Richfield Police Department after Parsons attempted to purchase $300 worth of items at 12:34 p.m. and the credit card was found to be over its limit. The attendant back at the Texaco station called the Beaver County Sheriff's Office after discovering bloody items in the dumpster. Deputy Raymond Goodwin found Ernest's bank statement and Parsons' bloody clothes in the dumpster. After calling Ernest's wife Beverley, the officers concluded that the person who visited the service station was not Richard Ernest. At about 4:25 p.m. on August 31, a Utah Highway Patrol officer found Parsons sleeping in Ernest's car at the Red Creek rest area on Interstate 70, west of Salina, Utah. When Parsons was brought into the Richfield police station where the bloody clothes were gathered, he continued to insist that he was Ernest. When officers asked for his street address, Parsons asked for a lawyer. Sheriff Kenneth Yardley recalled that Parsons asked if he could keep his book to read.|$|E
