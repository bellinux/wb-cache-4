5|$|Cameroon {{has one of}} {{the highest}} school {{attendance}} rates in Africa. Girls attend school less regularly than boys do because of cultural attitudes, domestic duties, early marriage, pregnancy, and sexual harassment. Although attendance rates are higher in the south, a disproportionate number of <b>teachers</b> <b>are</b> stationed there, leaving northern schools chronically understaffed.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>teachers</b> <b>were</b> more {{concerned}} about some problems than others. Male <b>teachers</b> <b>were</b> less concerned about limited budgets, fixed class hours, {{and the lack of}} supporting materials than <b>were</b> female <b>teachers.</b> Inexperienced <b>teachers</b> <b>were</b> more worried about fixed class schedules and the lack of supporting materials than <b>were</b> experienced <b>teachers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The current head <b>teacher</b> <b>is</b> Kristinn Breiðfjörð Guðmundsson. Previous head <b>teachers</b> <b>were</b> Arnfinnur Jónsson (1985 - 1992) and Ragnar Gíslason (1992 - 2002).|$|R

5|$|Born about 1110, Foliot {{became a}} monk of Cluny, {{probably}} in about 1130. He became Prior of Cluny Abbey, then Prior of Abbeville, a Cluniac house. There are some indications that he studied law at Bologna, {{and he may}} have studied under Robert Pullen, the English theologian, either at Oxford or Exeter. He also acquired a knowledge of rhetoric as well as the liberal arts. The names of two of his early <b>teachers</b> <b>are</b> known, but nothing else of them. Foliot also learned biblical exegesis, probably from Pullen.|$|E
50|$|Another {{incident}} occurred in 2010 when a relief <b>teacher</b> <b>was</b> dismissed after students pushed, swore at and assaulted him. The <b>teacher</b> <b>was</b> ordered {{to leave the}} premises but later took the Department of Education to the industrial relations commission. It {{was found that the}} <b>teacher</b> <b>was</b> unfairly dismissed, the students involved having a history of falsely accusing teachers, and the department was ordered to rehire the teacher.|$|R
50|$|As of 2014 {{all of the}} <b>teachers</b> <b>were</b> non-Hispanic/Latino White, {{and almost}} all of the <b>teachers</b> <b>were</b> U.S. {{citizens}} and native English speakers, {{with the exception of the}} French teacher, a French citizen.|$|R
50|$|Men predominated as {{teachers}} {{until the early}} 19th century, but by the mid-19th century most <b>teachers</b> <b>were</b> women. Women could <b>be</b> <b>teachers</b> only if they were unmarried; {{as soon as they}} married, another <b>teacher</b> <b>was</b> hired. Women were paid half the salaries as men.|$|R
5|$|Primary school <b>{{teachers}}</b> <b>are</b> general {{teachers who}} have received their training at either the University of Iceland or the University of Akureyri. The typical course lasts three years. Lower secondary teachers may also be trained at the University of Iceland. A BA or BS degree is required in this situation. The courses {{are designed to be}} both academic and practical. Municipalities are responsible for the employment of teachers. Optional in-service teacher training courses are offered on an annual basis.|$|E
5|$|Cultural activities, {{including}} the annual religious festivals, in Puri are: The Puri Beach Festival held from 5 to 9 November every year, and the Shreekshetra Utsav held from 20 December to 2 January every year. The cultural programmes include unique sand art, display {{of local and}} traditional handicrafts and food festival. In addition, cultural programmes are held for two hours on every second Saturday of the month at the district Collector's Conference Hall near Sea Beach Police Station. Odissi dance, Odissi music and folk dances {{are part of this}} event. Odissi dance is the cultural heritage of Puri. This dance form originated in Puri from the dances performed by Devadasis (Maharis) attached to the Jagannatha Temple who performed dances in the Nata mandapa of the temple to please the deities. Though the devadasi practice has been discontinued, the dance form has become modern and classical and is widely popular; many of the Odissi virtuoso artists and gurus (<b>teachers)</b> <b>are</b> from Puri. Some of the famous Odissi dancers are Kelucharan Mohapatra, Mayadhar Raut, Sonal Mansingh, Sanjukta Panigrahi and many more.|$|E
5|$|In New York City, a {{group of}} {{teenagers}} audition to study at the High School of Performing Arts, where they are sorted into three different departments: Drama, Music and Dance. Accepted in the Drama department are Montgomery MacNeil, a closeted homosexual, Doris Finsecker, a shy Jewish girl, and Ralph Garci, who succeeds after failed auditions for Music and Dance. In the Music department, Bruno Martelli is an aspiring keyboardist whose electronic equipment horrifies Mr. Shorofsky, a conservative music teacher. Lisa Monroe is accepted in the Dance department, despite having {{no interest in the}} subject. Coco Hernandez is accepted in all three departments because of her all-around talent. Leroy Johnson goes to the school, performing as part of a dance routine for an auditioning friend, but the dance <b>teachers</b> <b>are</b> more impressed by his talents than hers.|$|E
40|$|<b>Teacher</b> {{absenteeism}} <b>is</b> {{a serious}} problem for school systems. Using an existing model of attendance behavior as a guide, attitudinal, demographic and absenteeism data from 265 secondary <b>teachers</b> <b>were</b> examined. Canonical correlation analysis revealed that absenteeism among <b>teachers</b> <b>was</b> significantly related to distance to work, gender, job involvement, and overall job satisfaction...|$|R

5|$|Most <b>teachers</b> <b>are</b> {{required}} to address HIV/AIDS in their curricula; although instructors are, {{for the most}} part, committed to helping their students understand and avoid the disease, they face many obstacles that prevent them from informing their students about HIV/AIDS in productive ways. For example, some teachers cannot advise their students to remain faithful to their sexual partners without seeming hypocritical because they engage in extramarital sexual relations themselves. Others feel uncomfortable discussing sexual matters with their students, and some believe that, due to their limited training, they are not knowledgeable enough about HIV/AIDS to direct classroom discussions about the disease. In addition, many teachers feel unsupported by community members, who often either deny {{the extent of the}} epidemic or believe that HIV/AIDS should not be addressed in the classroom.|$|E
5|$|State schools provide {{textbooks}} free {{of charge}} to their students, while private schools generally require their students {{to pay for their}} textbooks, enabling the latter to change their textbooks and textbook editions more frequently. All primary schools have at least four computers, one printer, a large monitor and a teacher's laptop computer in their classrooms, while many secondary schools have specialised rooms necessary to teach subjects such as Home Economics and Food Technology. An average of 22.5 students are enrolled per primary school class, with the average rising to 24.3 in secondary school classes. Primary school <b>teachers</b> <b>are</b> expected to dedicate five hours per week to each of Maltese, English and mathematics, one hour per week to science, two hours per weeks to arts and crafts, two hours per week to social studies, one hour and 15 minutes per week to social studies, and {{two and a half hours}} per week to physical education and religion. State school syllabi at the secondary level are set by the local examination bodies.|$|E

25|$|The town's <b>teachers</b> <b>were</b> also {{placed in}} a {{difficult}} position. They were forced to swear loyalty to Faubus's bills. Even though Faubus's idea of private schools never played out, the <b>teachers</b> <b>were</b> still expected to attend school every day and prepare {{for the possibility of}} their students' return. The <b>teachers</b> <b>were</b> completely under Faubus's control and the many months that the school stayed empty only served as a cause for uncertainty in their professional futures.|$|R

25|$|Because {{of these}} {{difficulties}} many <b>teachers</b> <b>are</b> {{turning to the}} web for PLCs. <b>Teachers</b> <b>are</b> finding groups through Twitter, Facebook, and other social media websites {{that allow them to}} interact with teachers from across their country to brainstorm and exchange ideas. These groups can be helpful for those with PLCs already at their current school and those without PLCs.|$|E
25|$|The Bronx Science faculty {{includes}} educators {{with advanced}} degrees, including PhDs, {{and many have}} taught at universities.

50|$|From the 1917 Hosic Report, the <b>teacher</b> <b>was</b> {{urged to}} focus on {{developing}} the individual writer rather than certain forms and rules. The <b>teacher</b> <b>was</b> to observe {{and respond to the}} maturing of each student’s growth in thought and expression. This sounds very much like <b>teachers</b> <b>were</b> being instructed to teach in response to the individual learner rather than just deliver a scripted program. <b>Teachers</b> <b>were</b> told to offer many opportunities for students to write and speak on topics that were familiar and of interest to them so that they could give attention to correctness and present thoughts to convince and interest others. The belief was that composition should grow out of the experiences of the child.|$|R

5000|$|Take {{a look at}} New Jersey's tenure {{system as}} an example. Currently under New Jersey's tenure system, a <b>teacher</b> <b>is</b> placed on {{probation}} for three years during which time the <b>teacher</b> <b>is</b> evaluated using a system called AchieveNJ. [...] During or after these three years, the principal must decide if the school will grant tenure to this teacher. If so, the <b>teacher</b> will <b>be</b> asked to work there for a fourth year and will be granted tenure. The principal is able to fire a teacher {{at any time during}} the probation period. However, once a <b>teacher</b> <b>is</b> tenured, the principal can no longer fire a teacher without just cause. The <b>teacher</b> <b>is</b> then protected by tenure. There are four reasons a <b>teacher</b> may <b>be</b> fired in New Jersey once they are tenured. The reasons include: incapacity, inefficiency, unbecoming conduct and just cause. A teacher being fired for any of these reasons is given a chance to defend their case.|$|R
