30|$|Speaker {{recognition}} systems perform {{extremely well}} in neutral <b>talking</b> environments [1 – 4]; however, such systems perform poorly in stressful <b>talking</b> environments [5 – 13]. Neutral <b>talking</b> environments {{are defined as}} the <b>talking</b> environments in which speech is generated assuming that speakers are not suffering from any stressful or emotional <b>talking</b> conditions. Stressful <b>talking</b> environments are defined as the <b>talking</b> environments that cause speakers to vary their generation of speech from neutral <b>talking</b> condition to other stressful <b>talking</b> conditions such as shouted, loud and fast.|$|R

On Sunday mornings, congregants {{meet at the}} temple for Sunday School, which begins with prayers and hymns. After that, the preacherusually a ministerpresides over a <b>talk</b> during which he reads from the Bible and presents the material to be covered throughout the week. During the <b>talk,</b> {{it is common for}} members of either sex to read a cited verse from the Bible. At the end of the <b>talk,</b> more hymns and prayers are recited and voluntary offerings are given. Sunday evening services begin with hymns and prayers, after which members of the congregation of both sexes recite from the Bible or sing hymns. A shorter <b>talk</b> is held with the aim of deepening the Sunday School's <b>talk.</b>|$|E
30|$|A <b>talking</b> head can {{be driven}} by text or speech. The text-driven <b>talking</b> head {{consists}} of TTS and <b>talking</b> head. The TTS synthesizes the audio with phoneme information from the input text. Then the phoneme information drives the <b>talking</b> head. The speech-driven <b>talking</b> head uses phoneme information from original sounds. Text-driven <b>talking</b> head is flexible {{and can be used}} in many applications, but the quality of speech is not so good as that of a speech-driven <b>talking</b> head.|$|R

30|$|In literature, {{there are}} many studies that focus on speech {{recognition}} and speaker recognition fields in stressful <b>talking</b> environments [5 – 13]. Specifically, these two fields are investigated by very few researchers in shouted <b>talking</b> environments. Therefore, the number of studies {{that focus on the}} two fields in such <b>talking</b> environments is limited [7 – 11]. Shouted <b>talking</b> environments are defined as the <b>talking</b> environments in which when speakers shout, their aim is to produce a very loud acoustic signal, either to increase its range of transmission or its ratio to background noise [8 – 11]. Speaker recognition systems in shouted <b>talking</b> environments can be used in criminal investigations to identify the suspected persons who uttered voice in a shouted <b>talking</b> condition and in the applications of <b>talking</b> condition recognition systems. <b>Talking</b> condition recognition systems can be used in medical applications, telecommunications, law enforcement, and military applications [12].|$|R

40|$|The {{work of this}} {{research}} is devoted to studying and enhancing <b>talking</b> condition recognition in stressful and emotional <b>talking</b> environments (completely two separate environments) based on three different and separate classifiers. The three classifiers are: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), Second-Order Circular Hidden Markov Models (CHMM 2 s) and Suprasegmental Hidden Markov Models (SPHMMs). The stressful <b>talking</b> environments that have been used in this work are composed of neutral, shouted, slow, loud, soft and fast <b>talking</b> conditions, while the emotional <b>talking</b> environments are made up of neutral, angry, sad, happy, disgust and fear emotions. The achieved results in the current work show that SPHMMs lead each of HMMs and CHMM 2 s in improving <b>talking</b> condition recognition in stressful and emotional <b>talking</b> environments. The results also demonstrate that <b>talking</b> condition recognition in stressful <b>talking</b> environments outperforms that in emotional <b>talking</b> environments by 2. 7 %, 1. 8 % and 3. 3 % based on HMMs, CHMM 2 s and SPHMMs, respectively. Based on subjective assessment by human judges, the recognition performance of stressful <b>talking</b> conditions leads that of emotional ones by 5. 2 %.
