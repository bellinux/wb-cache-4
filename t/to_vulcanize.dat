5000|$|Charles Goodyear, first American <b>to</b> <b>vulcanize</b> rubber, {{lived in}} Naugatuck {{as a young}} man; his brother, Henry Goodyear, founded the Goodyear Metallic Rubber Shoe Company in Naugatuck that {{became part of the}} United States Rubber Company in 1892.|$|E
50|$|Trinitrobenzene is used {{primarily}} as a high explosive for commercial mining and military use. Some other uses include a narrow-range pH indicator, an agent <b>to</b> <b>vulcanize</b> natural rubber, and a mediating agent to mediate the synthesis of other explosive compounds.|$|E
50|$|A steam {{connection}} {{is attached to}} {{each end of the}} assembled hose, and pressurized steam is injected into the hose. This makes the liner swell against the inner jacket and causes the thin sheet of uncured rubber <b>to</b> <b>vulcanize</b> and bond the liner to the inner jacket.|$|E
50|$|Leatheroid is {{cellulose}} material {{very similar}} <b>to</b> <b>vulcanized</b> fibre in physical properties and uses. It is prepared using unsized cotton rag paper (as is vulcanized fibre) and mineral acid.|$|R
50|$|Jute soles {{typically}} include fully or partially {{vulcanized rubber}} beneath the jute soles for long-lasting espadrille shoes. Sometimes crepe soles {{are used as}} out-soles although those are not as durable compared <b>to</b> <b>vulcanized</b> ones. Jute braid soles might include heels made of wood or EVA foam.|$|R
50|$|Following {{a devastating}} fire in 1925, Papworth Industries {{opened a new}} well-equipped trunk-making factory in 1926 that was able to produce {{a wide range of}} goods from utility fibre {{suitcases}} to handcrafted attaché cases, from canvas kit bags <b>to</b> <b>vulcanized</b> fibre cabin trunks. A reputation far and wide was soon established and the buyer from Saks Fifth Avenue is recorded as coming in person to select items for the prestigious New York store.|$|R
50|$|The core of {{the balls}} are formed by {{compression}} molding with chemical reactions. First, polybutadiene is mixed with additives, then extruded, pressed using a calender and cut into pieces which are placed in a mold. The mold is subjected to high pressure and high temperature for about 30 minutes, enough time <b>to</b> <b>vulcanize</b> the material.|$|E
50|$|Ancient Mesoamerican civilizations {{used the}} morning glory species Ipomoea alba {{to convert the}} latex from the Castilla {{elastica}} tree and also the guayule plant to produce bouncing rubber balls. The sulfur in the morning glory's juice served <b>to</b> <b>vulcanize</b> the rubber, a process predating Charles Goodyear's discovery by at least 3,000 years. Aztec priests in Mexico were also known to use the plant's hallucinogenic properties (see Rivea corymbosa).|$|E
50|$|Most sulfur {{produced}} {{is transformed}} into sulfur dioxide, which is further transformed into sulfuric acid, a very common industrial chemical. Other common uses include being a key ingredient of gunpowder and Greek fire, and being used to change soil pH. Sulfur is also mixed into rubber <b>to</b> <b>vulcanize</b> it. Sulfur is used in some types of concrete and fireworks. 60% of all sulfuric acid produced is used to generate phosphoric acid.|$|E
50|$|Vulcanized fibre is a {{laminated}} plastic {{composed of}} only cellulose. The material is a tough, resilient, hornlike {{material that is}} lighter than aluminium, tougher than leather, and stiffer than most thermoplastics. The newer wood-laminating grade of vulcanized fibre is used to strengthen wood laminations used in skis, skateboards, support beams and as a sub-laminate under thin wood veneers.A product very similar <b>to</b> <b>vulcanized</b> fibre is leatheroid. Leatheroid, however, is made using a different chemical process.|$|R
50|$|In March 2013, Howard and Carroll {{conducted}} a video {{interview with the}} Active mail order company's YouTube channel, explaining the innovation of Howard signature model shoe that had been manufactured with a cup sole, as opposed <b>to</b> the <b>vulcanized</b> sole that Howard had preferred over the preceding five years. Howard explained that Carroll had managed to design a cup sole akin <b>to</b> a <b>vulcanized</b> sole, {{in addition to other}} technical aspects, and had therefore proceeded with the release of the design. Johnston stated in a March 2013 interview for the Independent Truck Company that the shoe design was his favorite Lakai design since working for the company.|$|R
50|$|The working {{principle}} of the Mooney viscometer consists in the measurement of the torque necessary to rotate a disc in a cylindrical chamber filled with the rubber compound <b>to</b> be <b>vulcanized.</b> A number proportional with {{the value of this}} torque is taken as viscosity index (Mooney viscosity).|$|R
50|$|As the {{material}} further warms during initial {{rotation of the}} serrated disk and the rubber begins to shear, the viscosity lowers and torque required decreases. Eventually, the torque will reach an inflection point, where the rubber begins <b>to</b> <b>vulcanize</b> and torque begins increasing. A shear pin on the machine prevents damage as the testing material stiffens. Comparing the torque versus time curves for different materials allows direct correlation of material viscosity and scorch time.|$|E
50|$|He {{brought a}} ton of Mexican chicle with him, in hopes of selling it to raise funds to help him return to power in his own country. He persuaded Thomas Adams of Staten Island, New York to buy it. Adams, a {{photographer}} and inventor, intended <b>to</b> <b>vulcanize</b> the chicle {{for use as a}} rubber substitute. Adams' efforts at vulcanization failed, but he noticed that Santa Anna liked to chew the chicle, which the ancient Mayans had done.|$|E
5000|$|The Rotating disk viscometer, or [...] "Mooney Machine" [...] {{as it is}} {{sometimes}} {{referred to in the}} rubber industry, is the standard viscometer for measuring material viscosity and scorch time for rubber before vulcanization. It was developed in the 1930s by Melvin Mooney. For a specific temperature, scorch time describes {{how long it will take}} the material <b>to</b> <b>vulcanize.</b> For example, a scorch time at ambient temperature indicates the rubber will be able to remain unvulcanized at room temperature for an extended period of time.|$|E
50|$|The process {{started with}} paper made from cotton rags. Before the {{processing}} of wood pulp and chemical wood pulps in the mid-19th century, the dominant fibre source for paper making was cotton and linen rags. The cotton rag sheet produced for conversion <b>to</b> <b>vulcanized</b> fibre is made like a sheet suitable for saturating. A paper is made for saturating by omitting any sizing additive, either beater added or surface applied. Today most paper sheets made for writing, printing, and coating have internal (beater added) sizing provided by rosin, alkyl succinic anhydride (ASA), or alkyl ketene dimer (AKD) and surface sizing provided by starch. A sheet made for saturating {{would have none of}} those chemical ingredients. The unsized saturating cotton fibre paper prepared for vulcanized fibre would be passed through a vat containing a zinc chloride solution.|$|R
50|$|The {{polymerizing}} {{temperature is}} approximately 5℃ {{in the case}} of SBR and 5∼10℃ {{in the case of}} NBR. Since rubber molecule types have a smaller number of branches than hot rubber polymerized at high temperature (50℃) and are characterized by good stereoregularity, cold rubber has superior processability as well as the ability <b>to</b> produce <b>vulcanized</b> materials with good tensile strength, expansion and aging resistance, and flex resistance.|$|R
40|$|Thiokol Propulsion {{has worked}} {{extensively}} to replace 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane (TCA) with ozone depleting chemicals (ODC) -free solvents {{for use in}} the manufacture of the Reusable Solid Rocket Motor (RSRM) for the Space Shuttle Program. As Thiokol has transitioned from sub-scale to full-scale testing and implementation of these new solvents, issues have been discovered which have required special attention. The original intent of Thiokol's solvent replacement strategy was to replace TCA with a single drop-in solvent for all equivalent applications. We have learned that a single candidate does not exist for replacing TCA. Solvent incompatibility with process materials has caused us to seek for niche solvents and/or processing changes that provide an ODC-free solution for special applications. This paper addresses some of the solvent incompatibilities, which have lead to processes changes and possible niche solvent usage. These incompatibilities were discovered during full-scale testing of ODC-free solvents and relate <b>to</b> <b>vulcanized</b> rubber and bond systems in the RSRM. Specifically, the following items are presented: (1) Cure effects of d-limonene based solvents on Silica Filled Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer (SF-EPDM) rubber. During full-scale test operations, Thiokol discovered that d-limonene (terpene) based solvents inhibit the cure of EPDM rubber. Subsequent testing showed the same issue with Nitrile Butadiene Rubber (NBR). Also discussed are efforts to minimize uncured rubber exposure to solvents; and (2) Cured bond system sensitivity to ODC-free solvents. During full scale testing it was discovered that a natural rubber <b>to</b> steel <b>vulcanized</b> bond could degrade after prolonged exposure to ODC-free solvents. Follow on testing showed that low vapor pressure and residence time seemed to be most likely cause for failure...|$|R
50|$|In 1884 Montgomery {{received}} a {{patent for a process}} <b>to</b> <b>vulcanize</b> and de-vulcanize India rubber. In 1895 {{and again in}} the period 1901 to 1904, Montgomery occasionally supplemented his aeronautical research with work in other branches of science, including electricity, communication, astronomy and mining. In 1895 he received four patents (American, German, British, and Canadian) for improvements in the efficiency of petroleum burning furnaces. In 1897 he took a teaching position at Santa Clara College and directed study of wireless telegraphy with Father Richard Bell. They were first to successfully transmit messages from Santa Clara College to San Francisco. Montgomery also patented two gold concentrator devices to assist miners in extracting gold from beach sands (see patent list).|$|E
50|$|The {{discovery}} of the process <b>to</b> <b>vulcanize</b> rubber was made by Charles Goodyear in 1838, and was granted a US Patent in 1844. In late 1843, Thomas Hancock filed for a UK patent, which was also granted in 1844, after the Goodyear patent had been granted. In 1852, while traveling in England, Charles Goodyear discovered that Thomas Hancock's company was producing vulcanized rubber and sued. It was discovered that Thomas Hancock had been shown a sample of Goodyear's rubber in 1842, {{but he had not}} been told the process that made it, and that Hancock said that he came up with his process independently. The last of the suits were settled in 1855. Vulcanization stabilized the rubber allowing it to be both durable and flexible. Shortly thereafter, several people expanded on experimentation of rubber coated fabrics.|$|E
5000|$|With World War I, Germany {{experienced}} a rapid liberalization of sexual values and {{sexually transmitted diseases}} spread rapidly. During this time, the majority of condoms were still made of [...] "skin": chemically treated intestine or bladder. [...] Rubber condoms were also available; they were made by wrapping raw rubber sheets around molds, then dipping them in a solution <b>to</b> <b>vulcanize</b> the rubber. In 1912, Fromm invented the cement dipping method, which made a thinner, seamless condom. [...] Instead of working with rubber as a solid material, it was mixed with gasoline or benzene. This made it a liquid in which molds could be dipped. [...] Fromm patented his invention in 1916. Mass production started in 1922 and was a great success—Fromms Act, as they were called, becoming the first brand-name condoms—which allowed the entrepreneur soon to open up branches in Denmark, the United Kingdom, Poland, and the Netherlands. Fromms became a synonym for condom in Germany. In 1920 Fromm was naturalized a German citizen. In 1928, the first condom vending machines were installed by Fromm's company, but the interior ministry only allowed it to advertise the hygienic advantages of condoms, not the condom's use as a contraceptive, because it feared a further decrease of the birth rate.|$|E
50|$|In 1893 Jonas Spaulding {{opened a}} leatherboard mill in Milton, {{organizing}} the business as J. Spaulding and Sons. His sons were Leon C., Huntley N. and Rolland H., of whom Huntley and Rolland {{would serve as}} governors of New Hampshire. Jonas and his sons would undertake the construction of another leatherboard mill in North Rochester around 1900. Jonas died before the North Rochester mill became operational. The brothers continued to run the business successfully and brought the Spaulding Brothers leatherboard mill in Townsend Harbor, Massachusetts, under the J. Spaulding and Sons banner in 1902. They were successful with a machine to manufacture shoe counters and with experiments <b>to</b> make <b>vulcanized</b> fibre. In 1912 they opened a purpose-built facility <b>to</b> make <b>vulcanized</b> fibre in Tonawanda, New York. In 1913 J. Spaulding and Sons opened a second leatherboard mill in Milton. They also acquired the Kennebunk Manufacturing Company (KEMACO), which made lunch boxes and violin cases using leatherboard and vulcanized fibre and at one time had facilities in Milton as well.|$|R
25|$|Natural rubber is an {{elastomer}} and a thermoplastic. Once {{the rubber}} is vulcanized, {{it turns into}} a thermoset. Most rubber in everyday use is <b>vulcanized</b> <b>to</b> a point where it shares properties of both; i.e., if it is heated and cooled, it is degraded but not destroyed.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to basic diving skills training, public safety divers require specialized training for recognizing hazards, conducting risk assessments, search procedures, diving in zero visibility, using full-face masks with communication systems, and recovering evidence that is admissible in court. Some {{of the water}} {{they are required to}} dive in is contaminated, and they may be required <b>to</b> wear <b>vulcanized</b> drysuits, with diving helmets sealed to the suit, and utilize surface supplied air. At times, the decontamination process that takes place out of the water can be longer than the dive time.|$|R
40|$|Based on a {{previous}} model compound study, we investigated the melt reactivity of Si-H and Si-vinyl end-functionalized siloxane oligomers towards polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) {{in the presence of}} platinum(0) -catalyst. We clearly observed grafting of the Si-H functional oligomer onto PBT and have also indications for grafting of the Si-vinyl oligomer. The grafting efficiencies and kinetics of both siloxane model compounds are compared and roughly quantified by infrared spectroscopy. This result indicates that the same reactive groups that are used <b>to</b> <b>vulcanize</b> silicone gums at high temperature {{can also be used to}} favor compatibility with a polyester matrix, opening perspectives toward polyester-siloxane thermoplastic elastomers...|$|E
40|$|The {{thesis is}} devoted to {{properties}} of mixtures based on elastomers and PVC, since large part of blends used in the industry contains a soft elastomer component. There were chosen commercial grades of rubber and suspension type of PVC. Studied polymer blends were prepared under the same conditions. Using of suitable additive combination that acts as lubricant, activator for vulcanization and thermal stabilizer for PVC is the important point of this work.

40|$|A {{process for}} bonding {{elastomeric}} material to a metal part includes coating a heat curable adhesive on {{the surfaces of}} the metal part to be bonded. The metal part is placed in a mold, a bottom plate and an upper transfer pot of a transfer molding machine is preheated to a predetermined cure temperature. A predetermined quantity of uncured elastomeric material is loaded into the transfer pot. The mold containing the adhesive coated metal part is clamped to the bottom plate, and almost contemporaneously, the uncured elastomeric material is pressed into the mold while maintaining heat and pressure in the mold for a time sufficient <b>to</b> <b>vulcanize</b> and thereby cure the elastomeric material simultaneously with the adhesive, whereby contacting surfaces of the metal part are strongly bonded to the vulcanized elastomeric material...|$|E
40|$|AbstractProperties of deproteinized {{natural rubber}} (DPNR) were {{investigated}} {{in order to}} apply the DPNR latex as non-allergy vulcanized rubber thin film products. Removal of proteins from natural rubber was made by incubation of high ammonium natural rubber latex (HA-NR) with urea 0. 1 wt%, 1 hour {{in the presence of}} surfactant at room temperature (DPNR). The nitrogen content of the DPNR was reduced to 0. 05 wt%, which was lower than 0. 45 wt% of HA-NR under the test condition. The reduction of protein content can be confirmed by observation a chemical structure through FT-IR technique. It is suggesting that the urea treatment is an effective method to remove protein from rubber latex. Then, physical properties of the DPNR latex were investigated. Amount of water soluble protein was observed through modified lowry method and it was found that water soluble protein content after incubation HA-NR with urea was reduced to 15 g/g (DPNR) from 4, 245 g/g (HA-NR). It was found that VFA number of DPNR was lower than that of HA-NR due to lower amount of protein presence in rubber latex. The particle size and charge of rubber latex was examined by dynamic light scattering and zeta potential to compare between un-vulcanized latex and vulcanized latex. The mechanical properties were then observed when we applied the DPNR latex <b>to</b> <b>vulcanized</b> rubber glove...|$|R
40|$|The {{vulcanization}} transition - the crosslink-density-controlled equilibrium {{phase transition}} from the liquid to the amorphous solid state - is explored analytically from a renormalization group perspective. The analysis centers on a minimal model that accounts for both the thermal motion of the constituents and the quenched random constraints imposed on their motion by the crosslinks, as well as particle-particle repulsion which suppresses density fluctuations. A correlation function involving fluctuations of the amorphous solid order parameter, the behavior of which signals the vulcanization transition, is examined, its physical meaning is elucidated, and the associated susceptibility is constructed and analyzed. A Ginzburg criterion for the width (in crosslink density) of the critical region is derived and {{is found to be}} consistent with a prediction due to de Gennes. Certain universal critical exponents characterizing the vulcanization transition are computed, to lowest nontrivial order, within the framework of an expansion around the upper critical dimension of six. This expansion shows that the connection between vulcanization and percolation extends beyond mean-field theory, at least to first order in the departure from the upper critical dimension. The relationship between the present approach <b>to</b> <b>vulcanized</b> matter and other approaches is explored in the light of this connection. To conclude, some expectations for how the vulcanization transition is realized in two dimensions, developed with H. E. Castillo, are discussed. Comment: 23 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
50|$|Tellurium suboxide, {{a mixture}} of {{tellurium}} and tellurium dioxide, {{is used in the}} rewritable data layer of some CD-RW disks and DVD-RW disks. Bismuth telluride is also used in many microelectronic devices, such as photoreceptors. Tellurium is sometimes used as an alternative <b>to</b> sulfur in <b>vulcanized</b> rubber.

40|$|Polychloroprene is a diene rubber, {{but unlike}} other diene rubbers, its {{compounding}} with various additives and curing mechanisms is different. A derivative of thiourea, ethylene thiourea (ETU), {{is widely used}} <b>to</b> <b>vulcanize</b> chloroprene rubber (CR), and the vulcanizates thus obtained exhibit excellent mechanical properties, good aging resistance, and very good sealing properties. However, {{the problem is that}} ETU is reported to be a potent carcinogenic compound, and hence, the effective substitution for ETU has been extensively explored. In this study, we used a naturally occurring amino acid derivative, dimethyl L-cystine, as an ecofriendly compound for the vulcanization of CR. It had a significant influence on the curing characteristics and mechanical properties, such as modulus, tensile strength, elongation at break, and hardness values. The concentration of this novel crosslinking agent and also the curing temperature were optimized. In the presence of dimethyl L-cystine, the amount and activity of magnesium oxide also exhibited significant influences on the crosslinking characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Sulfur was {{the first}} agent used <b>to</b> <b>vulcanize</b> the first {{commercial}} elastomer, i. e. natural rubber (NR). At present, accelerated sulfur vulcanization is suitable not only for natural rubber (NR) and its synthetic counterpart (IR), but also for other synthetic rubbers such as polybutadiene rubber (BR), styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), nitrile rubber (NBR), butyl rubber (IIR) and ethylene-propylene-diene rubber (EPDM). Even though the sulfur vulcanization of natural rubber was discovered more than 150 years ago, its mechanism is still not completely understood. In fact, {{one of the fundamental}} issues to establish is whether the predominant reaction pathway is via ionic or free-radical intermediates or both and which is the influence of the number and variety of the ingredients used in the vulcanization recipe in terms of network properties. In this contribution, a numerical model useful to correlate reaction kinetic parameters and experimental oscillating disk cure meter (ASTM test D 2084) curves, fitted by means of a simple mathematical model, is presented. The numerical approach is applied to systems with marching behavior, plateau level and reversion. Combining the present mathematical model with all analytical data for single recipes, it is possible to estimate in advance the optimal vulcanization temperature of real items, also in relation with their dimensions...|$|E
30|$|It can be {{seen from}} Fig.  3 that the {{vulcanization}} temperature and the vulcanization time have a great influence on the torque of the foamed EPDM rubber. When the vulcanization temperature is 150  °C, the vulcanization temperature is low, the scorch time is extremely short, the foaming has not started, and the rubber has begun <b>to</b> <b>vulcanize.</b> When the foaming agent starts to decompose, the degree of crosslinking is already high, {{and it is difficult to}} form cells, so it cannot be vulcanized at this temperature. When the vulcanization temperature is 180  °C, the vulcanization process will be over vulcanized in less than 10  min. At this time, the vulcanization rate drops rapidly, and the foaming agent decomposes in a large amount, which causes the gas generated by the decomposition to substantially destroy the EPDM rubber matrix, causing the cells to collapse, and the resulting foamed EPDM rubber has major defects. Therefore, it cannot be vulcanized at this temperature. Observing a few curves, it can be found that when the vulcanization time is 15  min, the vulcanization period is basically reached, and the vulcanization rate is faster [16]. Therefore, the effect of vulcanization at a vulcanization temperature of 155  °C to 175  °C for 15  min to 35  min on the damping sound absorption properties of the foamed EPDM rubber will be discussed.|$|E

Modification was one in two stages. In first stage, Natural Rubber(NR) was re placed by the blends of Chlorobutyl (ClIIR) and NTR, while keeping accelerator system constant. Blends of C 1 IIR and NTR were selected as 100 / 0 (KR/C 1 IIR), 90 / 10, 80 / 20, 70 / 30, 60 / 40. After examining physical properties of above vulcanisates as men ioned in Chapter I and cost factor, the blend of 80 / 20 (N 3 /C 1 IIR) was selected to carry out the second part. In the second part, accelar at or system was changed from semi efficient <b>vulcanizing</b> <b>to</b> efficient <b>vulcanizing</b> while keeping the blend of SR/C 1 IIR 80 / 20 constant. In this study, it was observed that system (I) and (£) (-Table 13) give better test results than other systems investigated.

25|$|The {{transition}} from a traditional wooden sole <b>to</b> one of <b>vulcanized</b> rubber {{may be attributed to}} Charles Goodyear and Leverett Candee. The qualities of rubber, though fascinating to Goodyear, were highly dependent on temperature: it was tacky when hot, brittle when cold. Vulcanization of rubber tempered its properties so that it was easily molded, durable, and tough. A rubberized elastic webbing made Goodyear's galoshes (circa 1890) easy to pull on and off.|$|R
