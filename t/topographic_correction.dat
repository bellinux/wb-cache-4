5000|$|<b>Topographic</b> <b>correction</b> (also called terrain correction): In rugged mountains, as {{a result}} of terrain, the {{effective}} illumination of pixels varies considerably. In a remote sensing image, the pixel on the shady slope receives weak illumination and has a low radiance value, in contrast, the pixel on the sunny slope receives strong illumination and has a high radiance value. For the same object, the pixel radiance value on the shady slope will be different from that on the sunny slope. Additionally, different objects may have similar radiance values. These ambiguities seriously affected remote sensing image information extraction accuracy in mountainous areas. It became the main obstacle to further application of remote sensing images. The purpose of <b>topographic</b> <b>correction</b> is to eliminate this effect, recovering the true reflectivity or radiance of objects in horizontal conditions.

This study compares the influence of 2 atmospheric and 4 <b>topographic</b> <b>correction</b> methods on two Landsat-TM images in the Romanian Carpathian mountains. The results show that atmospheric corrections improve the images substantial in flat regions. However, in mountain areas, the influence of topographic corrections is more important than atmospheric corrections.

The combined application of atmospheric and <b>topographic</b> <b>correction</b> techniques improves the accuracy of land cover mapping significantly and allows to distinguish more land cover classes with an acceptable class purity. This is especially important for the analysis of forest transitions that typically result in patch landscapes with a mixture of various stages of forest degradation and forest regeneration. status: publishe...|$|E

However, few studies have investigated the exact effects of DEM with different resolutions on the correction of imagery. Taking the topographic corrections on the Landsat- 7 ETM+ images acquired from the rugged terrain of the Yangjiahe river basin (P. R.

The main objective of these initiatives has been focused on improving land cover mapping. Despite of some discussions that include spectral approaches, no attention has been given to the impact of such correction on the spectral characterization of different targets. That impact can influence relationships commonly explored between radiometric data from orbital imagery and biophysical and/or geophysical parameters. TM/Landsat 5 images (orbit 218, row 76) from a mountainous region located between São Paulo, Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro states (Brazil) were converted to surface reflectance values. Two <b>topographic</b> <b>correction</b> methods considering different sampling strategies were applied. The local illumination was taking into account during the result analysis in order to evaluate the selective effect of the <b>topographic</b> <b>correction</b> on the spectral characterization of bare soils and vegetated surfaces.

Quite small amounts of erosion during the period of lowered surface temperature result in perturbations to heat flow which are nearly constant, or decrease smoothly with depth, damping the sigmate variation and rendering it undetectable.
