25|$|A {{number of}} {{publications}} have outlined clearly instructional strategies {{that teachers can}} use to implement dialogue journal interaction effectively, both in writing and orally. The strategies that <b>teachers</b> <b>use</b> depend on {{the age of the}} students, their proficiency {{in the language of the}} interaction, and the purposes of the class and the interaction. The teacher’s strategies may also be designed to have an impact on the students’ language use and learning.|$|E
25|$|While {{most studies}} of {{dialogue}} journals {{focus on the}} development of student writing, several researchers have explored their use and value for developing and assessing students' reading competence, especially students acquiring English as a second language. Some <b>teachers</b> <b>use</b> dialogue journals as an opportunity for students and a teacher to discuss books that students are reading. In dialogue journal interactions, {{regardless of whether or not}} the topic is about reading assignments, reading and writing are integrated as communicative activities.|$|E
40|$|Research {{examining}} {{the effects of}} language on initial impressions suggests that more favorable ratings are assigned to individuals using powerful rather than powerless language. While the effects of powerful language have been examined in contexts such as the interview, crisis intervention, and the court room, little consideration {{has been given to}} the effects of powerful and powerless language on students 2 ̆ 7 impressions. This study is designed to (1) extend the existing research on students 2 ̆ 7 perceptions by arguing that teachers 2 ̆ 7 use of powerful and powerless language influences students 2 ̆ 7 impressions, (2) address the relationship of gender and status on students 2 ̆ 7 perceptions, and (3) examine the role of uncertainty reduction during impression formation. Three hypotheses were specifically tested: (1) students will perceive <b>teachers</b> <b>using</b> powerless language less favorably than <b>teachers</b> <b>using</b> powerful language, (2) students will assign <b>teachers</b> <b>using</b> powerless language less favorable ratings of their course than <b>teachers</b> <b>using</b> powerful language, and (3) <b>teachers</b> <b>using</b> powerless language will generate higher levels of student uncertainty than <b>teachers</b> <b>using</b> powerful language. In addition, two research questions were asked: (1) does teacher gender affect students 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of the teacher, and (2) does teacher status affect students 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of the teacher?^ One hundred and sixty students were assigned to one of eight experimental conditions: two language (powerful and powerless), two gender, (male and female), and two status (professor and GTA). Measurements included an impression index, an uncertainty instrument, and a student perception scale. ^ Results indicate that students assign favorable ratings to <b>teachers</b> <b>using</b> powerful language. Students rated teachers with powerful language more favorably on all dimensions of the impression formation scale. In addition, students 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of the course were also rated higher when <b>teachers</b> <b>used</b> powerful language. Students reported higher levels of uncertainty when <b>teachers</b> <b>used</b> powerless language. <b>Teacher</b> gender and status appear to have no measurable effects on impression formation. However, teacher gender did affect students 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of the class. ...|$|R

One thousand and four-hundred ninety-seven students {{filled in the}} classroom discipline strategy questionnaire that assessed {{their perceptions of the}} strategies their English <b>teachers</b> <b>used</b> to discipline the classroom. The results showed that Iranian EFL <b>teachers</b> appeared to <b>use</b> recognition/rewarding strategies more often to discipline their classes, while using aggression and punishment were the least common classroom discipline strategies. Female <b>teachers</b> <b>used</b> punishment, discussion, and aggression strategies more in comparison to male teachers.

40|$|A study {{examined}} the relationship between <b>teacher</b> <b>use</b> of power and teacher effectiveness in samples of adult learners and traditional undergraduate students. The primary goal was to provide educators with practical information that may assist them in adapting their classroom communication styles to different student audiences. Subjects, 71 traditional undergraduate students and 105 adult learners enrolled in a variety of courses offered through the college of continuing education at a large midwestern university, completed questionnaires designed to measure <b>teacher</b> effectiveness and <b>use</b> of power in the classroom. Findings showed that in this sample of adult learners, teacher effectiveness ratings were significantly and negatively related to <b>teacher</b> <b>use</b> of coercive power and positively related to <b>teacher</b> <b>use</b> of expert power. In the sample of traditional undergraduate students, teacher effectiveness ratings were significantly correlated with <b>teacher</b> <b>use</b> of expert and referent power.

25|$|Ink is {{made from}} {{lampblack}} (soot) and binders, and comes in inksticks which must be rubbed with water on an inkstone until the right consistency is achieved. Much cheaper, pre-mixed bottled inks are now available, but these are used primarily for practice as stick inks are considered higher quality and chemical inks {{are more prone to}} bleeding over time, making them less suitable for use in hanging scrolls. Learning to rub the ink {{is an essential part of}} calligraphy study. Traditionally, Chinese calligraphy is written only in black ink, but modern calligraphers sometimes use other colors. Calligraphy <b>teachers</b> <b>use</b> a bright orange or red ink with which they write practice characters on which students trace, or to correct students' work.|$|E
25|$|Romanization is not {{normally}} taught in Taiwan's public schools at any level. Consequently, most Taiwanese {{do not know}} how to romanize their names or addresses. <b>Teachers</b> <b>use</b> only Zhuyin ("bopomofo") for teaching and annotating the pronunciation of Mandarin. There have been sporadic discussions about using a romanization system during early education to teach children Mandarin pronunciation (like how students in Mainland China learn Mandarin using Hanyu Pinyin). However, like all other aspects of romanization in Taiwan, this is a controversial issue. The plan in the early 2000s to adopt Pinyin was delayed due to disagreements over which form to use (Tongyong or Hanyu). The move is complicated by the massive effort needed to produce new instructional materials and retrain teachers.|$|E

2500|$|The OLPC {{project has}} also been criticized for {{allegedly}} adopting a [...] "one-shot" [...] deployment approach {{with little or no}} technical support or teacher training, and for neglecting pilot programs and formal assessment of outcomes in favor of quick deployment. Some authors attribute this unconventional approach to the OLPC promoters' alleged focus on constructivist education and 'digital utopianism'. Mark Warschauer, a Professor of University of California at Irvine and Morgan Ames, at the time of writing, a PhD candidate at Stanford University, have pointed out that the laptop by itself does not completely fill the need of students in underprivileged countries. The [...] "children’s machines", as they have been called, have been deployed to several countries, for example Uruguay, Peru, and in the US, Alabama, but after a relatively short time, their usage has declined considerably, sometimes because of hardware problems or breakage, in some cases, as high as 27% to 59% within the first two years, and sometimes {{due to a lack of}} knowledge on the part of the users on how to take full advantage of the machine. However, another factor has recently been acknowledged; a lack of a direct relation to the pedagogy needed in the local context to be truly effective. Uruguay reports that only 21.5% of <b>teachers</b> <b>use</b> the laptop in the classroom on a daily basis, and 25% report using it less than once a week. In Alabama, 80.3% of students say they never or seldom use the computer for class work, and Peru, teachers report that in the first few months, 68.9% use the laptop three times per week, but after two months, only 40% report such usage. Those of a low socio-economic level tend to not be able to effectively use the laptop for educational purposes on their own, but with scaffolding and mentoring from teachers, the machine can become more useful. According to one of the returning OLPC executives, Walter Bender, the approach needs to be more holistic, combining technology with a prolonged community effort, teacher training and local educational efforts and insights.|$|E

This study focused on the teaching techniques <b>used</b> by English <b>teacher</b> in teaching third grade students of Raffles International School Balikpapan. The purposes of this study were: (1) to know the teaching techniques that are used by the English teacher in teaching third grade students, (2) to describe the implementation of teaching techniques that used by the English teacher in teaching third grade students. The research design of this study was descriptive qualitative. The subject of this study was the English teacher who taught English to the third grade students.
