25|$|The {{ultraviolet}} index or UV Index is {{an international}} standard measurement {{of the strength of}} sunburn-producing ultraviolet (UV) radiation at a particular place and time. <b>The</b> <b>scale</b> <b>was</b> developed by Canadian scientists in 1992, then adopted and standardized by the UN's World Health Organization and World Meteorological Organization in 1994. It is primarily used in daily forecasts aimed at the general public, and is increasingly available as an hourly forecast as well.|$|E
25|$|Cash fares are distance-related. <b>The</b> <b>scale</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} intended to be broadly comparable with buses, but this proved to be unfinanceable. In January 2013 the adult single fare from Birmingham to Wolverhampton was £2 by bus and £3.60 by tram, although the tram journey is much quicker even when the bus routes are congestion-free. By 2016 the tram fare had risen to £4. In November 2013 Birmingham City Council indicated plans to introduce a smart-card system (similar to Transport for London's Oyster Card) to improve access, alongside a range of measures including a new Tube-style map and electric bus networks. This has now launched and is called the Swift card.|$|E

25|$|In 1971, Dr. Tetsuya Theodore Fujita {{introduced}} {{the idea for}} a scale of tornado winds. With the help of colleague Allen Pearson, he created and introduced what came to be called the Fujita scale in 1973. This is what the F stands for in F1, F2, etc. <b>The</b> <b>scale</b> <b>was</b> based on a relationship between the Beaufort scale and the Mach number scale; the low end of F1 on his scale corresponds to the low end of B12 on the Beaufort scale, and the low end of F12 corresponds to the speed of sound at sea level, or Mach 1. In practice, tornadoes are only assigned categories F0 through F5.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{proposed}} {{scales for}} quantifying {{the significance of}} transmissions between Earth and potential extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI). The Rio Scale, ranging from 0 to 10, was proposed in 2000 {{as a means of}} quantifying the significance of a SETI detection. <b>The</b> <b>scale</b> <b>was</b> designed by Iván Almár and Jill Tarter to help policy-makers formulate an initial judgment on a detection’s potential consequences. The scale borrows heavily from the Torino Scale, which is used to categorize the hazard of impact of near-earth objects (NEOs). The IAA SETI Permanent Study Group officially adopted this scale both as a means of bringing perspective to claims of ETI detection and as an acknowledgement that even false ETI detections could have disastrous consequences, which should be mitigated.|$|E
25|$|Since the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale was {{introduced}} in 1953, comprehensive {{research has been done}} regarding the validity of the scale. across different cultures. In 1967, a study of cross-cultural differences in <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> <b>was</b> done between 9 year-old Japanese, French, and American students. The data concluded that Japanese and French students tested significantly lower on anxiety scores compared to the American students. Thus, there are strong cross-cultural differences related to the scores on the TMAS. Additional studies of the validity of the TMAS include a study between South African Natives and South African Europeans in 1979. Both groups included individuals with varying levels of education.This study found that the TMAS is sensitive to certain cross-cultural differences, but precautions should be taken when interpreting scores from the scale in non-Western cultures, regardless of the individual’s education level.|$|E

25|$|String {{theory was}} {{originally}} {{developed during the}} late 1960s and early 1970s as a never completely successful theory of hadrons, the subatomic particles like the proton and neutron that feel the strong interaction. In the 1960s, Geoffrey Chew and Steven Frautschi discovered that the mesons make families called Regge trajectories with masses related to spins {{in a way that}} was later understood by Yoichiro Nambu, Holger Bech Nielsen and Leonard Susskind to be the relationship expected from rotating strings. Chew advocated making a theory for the interactions of these trajectories that did not presume that they were composed of any fundamental particles, but would construct their interactions from self-consistency conditions on the S-matrix. The S-matrix approach was started by Werner Heisenberg in the 1940s as a way of constructing a theory that did not rely on the local notions of space and time, which Heisenberg believed break down at the nuclear scale. While <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> <b>was</b> off by many orders of magnitude, the approach he advocated was ideally suited for a theory of quantum gravity.|$|E
