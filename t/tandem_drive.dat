5000|$|In {{the spring}} of 1958, Scania-Vabis {{introduced}} {{a new generation of}} trucks, with newly designed six-cylinder engines, stronger chassis components and a new, more spacious and comfortable cab. The cab would be used for all conventional trucks until 1980. The largest model, called L75, had a ten litre engine. The truck was also offered with a trailing axle. This version was called the LS75, with an “S” for [...] "support axle". For real heavy duty work Scania-Vabis offered a version with <b>tandem</b> <b>drive</b> rear axles. It was called LT75, with “T” for [...] "tandem". The L75 series trucks came with air brakes, but power steering was still an option. From 1961 the truck was offered with a turbo-diesel.|$|E
40|$|Over 15 {{years of}} {{research}} at the Department of Mechanical Engineering of K. U. Leuven has resulted {{in the development of the}} high-end Leuven piezomotor. The Leuven motor is an all-in-one coarse/fine positioning device that offers large stroke (> 100 mm), wide speed range (1 nm/s to over 100 mm/s) and atomic resolution (< 1 nm). Moreover, by using reliable piezo transducers and a suitable tribopair, the Leuven motor can easily travel distances over 25 km. The force output of piezomotors can be increased by parallel operation. To serve this purpose, a novel suspension mechanism that supports <b>tandem</b> <b>drive</b> of the Leuven motor is developed. The particular design moreover allows the integration of an additional stepping drive mode. This mode is highly controllable, and therefore e. g. allows stable slow-speed motion.

40|$|Heavy-duty Engines. ” The thrust is to {{identify}} gross emitters, particularly high NOx emitters, and hence reduce their contribution to the emissions inventory, leading ultimately to improvements in air quality. Objectives of this study included identification of a suitable system that would both identify high emitters and realistically quantify emissions from in-service vehicles (System 1) and of a suitable system only for detection of gross emitters (System 2). Dynamometers Heavy-duty vehicles are not at present certified holistically for emissions, but rather their engines are certified to meet energy-specific emissions output levels. For I&M, {{it will be necessary}} to operate a vehicle on a chassis dynamometer and to draw power from the vehicle drive wheels through rollers. These dynamometers may be equipped with flywheels, and may use a variety of power absorbers.

40|$|Dynamic {{systems for}} screening, control and {{identification}} of different protein-ligand interactions are presented. Dynamic chemistry {{is used to}} produce new compounds/constituents in situ that can interact with a target molecule. Several entities can be introduced {{at the same time}} and interact with one another. These molecules make a dynamic combinatorial library (DCL) which is used in dynamic combinatorial chemistry (DCC). DCC is a recently introduced approach to generate dynamically interchanging libraries of compounds. These libraries are made of different building blocks that reversibly interact with one another and spontaneously assemble to encompass all possible combinations. If a target molecule, for instance a receptor is added to the system and one or more molecules show affinity to the target species, these compounds will, according to Le Châtelier´s principle, be amplified on the expense of the other non-bonding constituents. To further advance the technique, especially when biological systems are targeted, new reaction types and new screening methods are necessary. This thesis describes the development of different reversible reactions, thiol/disulfide interchange, transthiolesterification and the nitroaldol (Henry) reaction as means of generating reversible covalent bond reactions. Two different types of target proteins are used, enzymes belonging to the hydrolase family and the plant lectin Concanavalin A. Dynamic combinatorial resolution (DCR) is presented. This new concept relies on the consecutive kinetic resolution of dynamic combinatorial libraries, leading to complete amplification and control of dynamically interchangeable processes. By applying a kinetically controlled step to a thermodynamically controlled system, complete transformation and amplification can be obtained. The concept has been demonstrated by developing transthiolesterification and nitroaldol exchange reactions to generate diversity, forming libraries under thermodynamic control, and used in one-pot processes with kinetically controlled enzyme-mediated resolution. The results demonstrate that the reaction types are useful for the generation of dynamic libraries, and that the dynamic combinatorial resolution concept is highly valuable for efficient substrate identification, asymmetric synthesis, and library screening. The thesis also describes three other dynamic chemistry protocols. The first one describes dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of nitroaldol adducts by combined lipase catalysis. The second one describes finding lectin inhibitors from a glycodisulfide library and the third one describes finding an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase using a <b>tandem</b> <b>driven</b> dynamic self-inhibition approach.

2500|$|Gene drives {{may provide}} a {{powerful}} tool to restore balance of ecosystems by eliminating invasive species. Concerns regarding efficacy, unintended consequences in the target species as well as non-target species have been raised particularly in the potential for accidental release from laboratories into the wild. Scientists have proposed several safeguards for ensuring the containment of experimental gene drives including molecular, reproductive, and ecological. Many recommend that immunization and reversal drives be developed in <b>tandem</b> with gene <b>drives</b> in order to overwrite their effects if necessary. [...] There remains consensus that long-term effects must be studied more thoroughly particularly in the potential for ecological disruption that cannot be corrected with reversal drives.|$|R

50|$|In 1965 {{one of new}} Tampella 122 K 60 cannons was {{equipped}} with a <b>tandem</b> axle <b>driven</b> by the Nemo transmission system. This was tested with single wheels at first but later double wheels were used. The hauler was a Sisu KB-45 off-road lorry with a hydraulic system mounted {{on the front end}} and the oil container installed between the cabin and platform. This was tested in Santahamina during summer 1967, with the KB-45 hauling an SAT-produced trailer. The KB-45 had a weight of 6 490 kg and traction of 48 000 Nm; the trailer weighed 5 220 kg and delivered 30 000 Nm; the combination produced 72 000 Nm. The effect of the tyre size was not considered. Later the system was tested with a Sisu K-141 4×2 together with a field cannon 130 K 54 and Vanaja KK-69 ET 6×6 coupled with a three-axle carriage powered by a separate aggregate-run pump. The test proved even these trucks, not designed for off-road use, could haul heavy cannons in rough terrain using the Nemo system. During the trials it was observed that the trailers even pushed their haulers forward.|$|R

50|$|The Aerial Steamer, made by Thomas Moy, {{sometimes}} called the Moy-Shill Aerial Steamer, was an unmanned <b>tandem</b> wing aircraft <b>driven</b> by a 3 hp (2.25 kW) steam engine using methylated spirits as fuel.

It was tested in June 1875 on a circular rolled gravel track of nearly 300 ft (90 m) diameter. It did not reach a speed of above 12 mph (19 kph), but a speed of around 35 mph (56 kph) {{would be necessary to}} lift off. However it is credited with being the first steam-powered aircraft to have left the ground under its own power by the historian Charles Gibbs-Smith.|$|R
