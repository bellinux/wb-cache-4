5|$|When Michael {{finds out}} about Kevin's predicament, he gives Kevin his condolences, but subtly remains bitter that Kevin is ruining his {{birthday}} fun. Dwight and Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) are less subtle than they <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> being when discussing their secret relationship within earshot of Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak). After goofing {{around at the}} store, Jim and Pam return to the office.|$|E
5|$|Norgrove {{was removed}} from the scene via {{helicopter}} and received medical care, but she died. It was reported initially that she had been killed by one of her captors setting off a suicide vest. According to The Guardian, insurgents often put on suicide vests if they <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> in danger of being attacked. Taliban commanders Mullah Basir and Mullah Keftan (who were holding Norgrove) were among those killed in the raid, according to an Afghan intelligence official. Other women and children in the compound were uninjured, and no members of the rescue team were wounded.|$|E

25|$|Kappa legends {{are said}} {{to be based on the}} Japanese giant {{salamander}} or hanzaki, an aggressive salamander that grabs its prey with its powerful jaws. Other theories suggest they are based on historical sightings of the now extinct Japanese river otter as seen from a distance, otters have been known to stand upright and a drunk, frightened or hallucinating person may <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> seeing a humanoid entity and not a wild animal.|$|E

As of Season 3, {{they are}} aware of the clones, but <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> simply Alison's sisters. Gemma has a knack for showing up at awkward moments, such as when Sarah (dressed as Alison) was trying to keep Paul from killing Vic, when her parents were burying Dr. Leekie's body, and when Alison and Donnie were having some time to themselves.|$|E
25|$|As for the Chinese, I {{have the}} highest opinion {{not only of the}} Chinese character, but of the Chinese fitness for self-government. I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> eminently fitted to make a {{republic}} successful. China, for instance, is infinitely better fitted than is Russia for development along republican lines. In fact, China has always been practically a republic. It has had its dynasties of rulers, but the political unit of China has always been the village. The village people have always had their influence upon the Government. What is more, the average Chinaman is intelligent.|$|E

25|$|Psychology has {{demonstrated}} that {{being a part of}} a team has a direct influence on attitude and behavior of team members. Members of a team <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> more similar to each other than people on the outside. There are two main characteristics that define team interactions – identity and interdependence. For a group to become a team the members must identify with each other and exhibit some degree of interdependence on each other. These two characteristics were tested to determine if a computer can be a teammate.|$|E
25|$|Four factors {{exist that}} cause {{a person to}} be optimistically biased: their desired end state, their {{cognitive}} mechanisms, the information they have about themselves versus others, and overall mood. The optimistic bias is seen {{in a number of}} situations. For example: people believing that they are less at risk of being a crime victim, smokers believing that {{they are less likely to}} contract lung cancer or disease than other smokers, first-time bungee jumpers believing that they are less at risk of an injury than other jumpers, or traders who <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> less exposed to losses in the markets.|$|E
25|$|China's Education Ministry {{published}} research on September, 2014, that only 70% {{percent of people}} of the PRC had good understanding and speaking skill of Putonghua despite People's Republic of China Government was promoting Putonghua on TV, radio and public services like buses and like that to develop Putonghua as PRC official language to ease communication between all people of the PRC, because many ethnic groups had their own dialects, so it was problem to understand each other. To develop the Putonghua as the official common language of the PRC is difficult sometimes because some ethnic groups that are using other dialects don't like using the Putonghua because they <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> losing their own native dialect and cultural identity, for example, when {{in the summer of}} 2010 appeared some reports of increasing the using of the Putonghua on a local TV broadcasting in Cantonese dialect in the province of Guangdong, then thousands of Cantonese-speaking citizens were protesting on the demonstration against the plan.|$|E

25|$|Mick and Stan's {{relationship}} {{starts to}} thaw, annoying Shirley. Mick attempts to reunite Shirley with her estranged son, Dean Wicks (Matt Di Angelo), with little success. Tina {{refers to the}} incident involving a young Mick in the bathtub, citing the event as happening after their mother left. This confuses Mick, and he concludes that it was Stan who tried to kill him and attacks him, prompting Shirley {{to admit that she}} had attempted to drown him. Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) finds out from Shirley that Mick is actually her son, his father is a man named Andy and her mother Sylvie Carter (Linda Marlowe) concealed the pregnancy and brought Mick up as her and Stan's son. Shirley warns Phil not to tell Mick. Despite not being able to swim and having a phobia of water, Mick signs up to a sponsored swim in aid of his friend Billy Mitchell's (Perry Fenwick) young daughter, Janet Mitchell (Grace), who has Down's syndrome. He starts to learn at the local swimming pool, and confesses his fear to his friend, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). Ian helps him overcome this fear and he makes progress. Linda tells Mick she wants another baby after she realises her children are too old to require her constant attention. Mick convinces Linda {{that this is not a}} good idea, but proposes to her, as they are not actually married, though their families <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>are.</b> Linda turns down the proposal, liking things as they are, and then she finds out that Dean has overheard this conversation.|$|E
25|$|In {{the seventh}} and final book, Hermione accompanies Harry on his quest to destroy Voldemort's {{remaining}} Horcruxes. Before leaving on the quest, she helps {{ensure the safety of}} her parents by placing a false memory charm on them, making them <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> Wendell and Monica Wilkins, whose lifetime ambition is to move to Australia. She inherits Dumbledore's personal copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, which allows her to decipher some of the secrets of the Deathly Hallows. She prepared for their departure and journey by placing an Undetectable Extension Charm on a small beaded purse so she is able to fill the infinite depths of the bag with materials they will need. Hermione's spell saves her and Harry from Lord Voldemort and his snake Nagini in Godric's Hollow, although the ricochet snaps Harry's wand. When she, Ron, and Harry are captured by Snatchers, who are on the hunt for Muggle-borns under the Ministry's orders, Hermione disguises Harry by temporarily disfiguring his face with a Stinging Jinx. She also attempts to pass herself off as former Hogwarts student Penelope Clearwater and a half-blood to avoid persecution, but is later recognised and taken to Malfoy Manor where Bellatrix Lestrange tortures her with the Cruciatus Curse in an attempt to extract information on how Hermione, Harry, and Ron came to possess Godric Gryffindor's sword (which was supposed to be safe in the Lestrange vault at Gringotts). Even under torture, Hermione is able to use her quick thinking to lie to Bellatrix that the sword is a fake. When the others are able to escape their cell, Bellatrix threatens to slit Hermione's throat. Hermione, Harry, Ron and the other prisoners being held in Malfoy Manor are eventually rescued by Dobby.|$|E

Rigby expressed her feelings towards the family's exit, saying: [...] "I'm sad it's coming to an end. I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> quite emotional when they left. I don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> quite ready to go. But I suppose they'll all be doing new things." ...|$|R
5000|$|He also {{discussed}} {{how the other}} Family Guy actors reacted when they heard Brian would be killed in the episode, saying: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> glad it wasn't them. Laughs. I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> surprised, as anyone would <b>be</b> and I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> pretty stunned especially this far into the show. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> as shocked as anyone." [...] He also explained why they decided to replace Brian with another dog, saying: [...] "It felt like the way that this show was conceived by Seth all those years ago, was this entire family unit including the parents, kids and a dog. So by losing Brian, {{it felt like a}} void needed to be filled both comically, and also for the interpersonal relationships between all the characters. We felt that we needed to fill that role." ...|$|R

500|$|García Márquez {{believed}} {{that most of}} the information available on Bolívar was one-dimensional: [...] "No one ever said in Bolívar's biographies that he sang or that he was constipated... but historians don't say these things because they <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not important." [...] In the epilogue to the novel, García Márquez writes that he researched the book for two years; the task was difficult, both because of his lack of experience in conducting historical research, and the lack of documentary evidence for the events of the final period of Bolívar's life.|$|E
500|$|The Force Unleashed is {{intended}} to make players <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> [...] "actually, finally, in a Star Wars movie". It is the first game on which LucasArts and Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) collaborated since they both relocated to the Letterman Digital Arts Center in San Francisco, California. This collaboration allowed the companies to co-develop tools to make film-quality effects. LucasArts worked with ILM's Zeno tool framework and helped ILM build its Zed game editor. Lucas said having the two companies working {{together in the same}} building was [...] "a great collaboration".|$|E
