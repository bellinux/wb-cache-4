He ousted the former chairman Ulf Kristersson at the controversial congress known as the Battle of Lycksele, securing 58 of the delegates' votes where Kristersson gained only 55. The congress was controversial because it was the culmination of a long ideological battle within <b>the</b> <b>Moderate</b> Youth League between the conservatives and the libertarians; Reinfeldt represented the conservatives and Kristersson the libertarians. Reinfeldt later stated that although the effects of that deep ideological division and battle in the party lingered on within <b>the</b> <b>Moderate</b> Youth League, he also felt that it was a defining moment in his life. Had he lost the battle he would most likely not be in politics today. From 1995 to 1997 he was chairman of the Democrat Youth Community of Europe.|$|E

My research questions are; have the Social Democrats and <b>the</b> <b>Moderates</b> gotten closer within: 1) Labor market policies, 2) Education policies, 3) The view of migration and integration between 1990 - 2013. My method is to read party programmes from both parties starting year 1990 and 1993, 2001 and 2013, by using this approach I will see how the parties have developed alongside each other within the areas of subject. My conclusions are that the two parties have gotten closer within labor market policies and education policies. In the case of labor market policies it is <b>the</b> <b>Moderates</b> that have gotten closer the Social Democrats and its rhetoric surrounding the worker’s secure units and the Social Democrats have gotten closer <b>the</b> <b>Moderates</b> by wanting facilitates for companies.
