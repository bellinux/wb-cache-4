40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to see how Swedish actors adopt {{directive}} 2014 / 40 /EU and why it is adopted the way it is - with the example of the Swedish government, Swedish Match and Tobaksfakt, based on the actors input into the European Commission's proposal. The study's three research questions are: 1) How does the selected actors influence the <b>tobacco</b> <b>directive</b> 2014 / 40 /EU? 2) In what way do the selected actors adopt the 2014 / 40 /EU <b>tobacco</b> <b>directive</b> 3) Why are directive 2014 / 40 /EU adopted in the way proposed? The study's approach is through a 'Goodness of fit- perspective' see first the actors position then compare this to the new law. In this way see how they are going to adopt the directive. An analyze on argument of three Swedish contributions to the revision of the previous <b>tobacco</b> <b>directive</b> and a comparative analyze will be the methods. The conclusion of the study is that the Swedish government and Swedish Match have influenced in some parts and Tobaksfakta have influenced in most of the parts. The study also concludes that the directive 2014 / 40 /EU will be received with adaptation and absorption into Sweden's politics and policy's. Why it is received in this way has to do with the exception that Sweden holds from the ban of oral tobacco in EU but this conclusion can't be fully stated.

40|$|In my thesis, I {{summarized}} {{the main reasons}} for specific German position towards tobacco advertising directives. In my opinion, the main reason consisted in tobacco companies and lobby groups activity. Adoption of <b>tobacco</b> <b>directive</b> was partly inevitable, but the above mentioned interest groups succeeded (via Germany) in limiting the directive's impact and postponing its adoption. Long-term and elaborated tobacco company's strategy succeeded in persuasion the German public. They, inter alia, indirectly force them to believe that tobacco industry is essential for the German economic growth. In my opinion, the strategy was successful because of its complexity and sophistication. Even though Germany was not successful before European Court of Justice with its second action for directive annulment, it still indirectly achieved to limit the directive impact and postponed its adoption for several years. But at the end, Germany was also forced (under the threat of fine) to implement the directive into its legal system...|$|E
40|$|In 1998 the {{advertising}} ban of the EC directive was {{challenged by the}} Federal Republic of Germany. One reason for Germany's fierce opposition to the EC directive is the conviction that a ban of tabacco advertising is an ineffective way to curb smoking. In this article I look for empirical studies {{for the relationship between}} advertising and smoking. If one distinguishes the effect of advertising on adults from the effects on children and adolescents one can make a point for {{the advertising}} ban. Empirical evidence shows that the various ways limiting youth access to cigarettes were not very successful. New research on the problem how fear appeals may motivate acceptance of action recommendations demonstrates that mere information on the health risks of smoking will be unable to persuade the youth of their personal vulnerability. Small steps to regulate tobacco seem unable to prevent the youth becoming nicotine addicts. In Germany the participation rate of youth smoking has recently increased dramatically.

40|$|AbstractThe {{pharmacokinetic}} (PK) {{profile of}} nicotine delivered by an Electronic Vapour Product (EVP) was characterised in a 2 -part study in smokers. The {{study was designed}} as a randomised, controlled, four-way crossover trial. Part 1 compared an unflavoured e-liquid (UF 2. 0 %) and a flavoured e-liquid (FL 2. 0 %) to a conventional cigarette (CC; JPS Silver King Size, 0. 6  mg) and a licensed nicotine inhalator (Nicorette®; 15  mg). Part 2 compared e-liquids with increasing nicotine concentrations (0 %, 0. 4 %, 0. 9 %, 2. 0 %). Subjects used each different product for a daily use session. In Part 1, maximum plasma nicotine concentration (Cmax) for UF 2. 0 %, FL 2. 0 %, Nicorette® and CC was 3. 6, 2. 5, 2. 5 and 21. 2  ng/mL, respectively. The time to maximum plasma nicotine concentration (Tmax) was longer for the EVP (UF 2. 0 %, 9. 0  min; FL 2. 0 %, 10. 0  min) and the nicotine inhalator (13. 0  min) compared to CC (3. 0  min). In Part 2, EVP with 0 %, 0. 4 %, 0. 9 % and 2. 0 % nicotine produced Cmax values of 0. 6, 1. 0, 1. 9 and 3. 6  ng/mL, respectively. At the maximum nicotine concentration of 2 % as prescribed by the European <b>Tobacco</b> <b>Directive,</b> the EVP achieved nicotine delivery that was comparable to the inhalator.

40|$|In June 2001, the European Commission {{passed a}} new Directive for tobacco products, which, in {{addition}} to other regulations, obliges the manufacturers and importers of tobacco products in the EU to disclose the ingredients used in their products and also to submit data on the toxicological properties of these ingredients in burnt and unburnt form. The idea of monitoring and regulating additives used for tobacco products is rather old. Almost 200 years ago, C. F. Hareless in Nuremberg [cited in P. J. Schneider: Über die Gifte; Tübingen, 1821] established 12 rules for the correct use of ingredients in manufacturing tobacco products and vinegar. These rules cover almost all aspects for a consumer-friendly, responsible and safe use of additives for tobacco products and could, therefore, have served as an example for the present EU <b>Tobacco</b> <b>Directive.</b> For instance, Hareless states in Rule 4 that the manufacturer submits to the health department the prescriptions of all added ingredients in snuff and smoking tobacco. It was also planned that the responsible authority can perform unannounced “empirical” and “chemical” tests of the finished products (Rules 7 and 8). Although these rules call for strong regulation of ingredients, they do not challenge the use of additives in snuff and smoking tobacco because ingredients may contribute to the quality, acceptability and also the safety of the product. The Directive rightly asks for toxicological data of ingredients in burnt form, in order {{to be sure that the}} use of additives does not increase the biological effects of tobacco products. The review of Paschke, Scherer and Heller in this issue of BeiträgezurTabakforschung International/Contributions to Tobacco Research has compiled data from published papers on the toxicological effects of ingredients in burnt form. The authors did not intend to evaluate the presented methods and data, therefore, this review is more a reference work rather than a scientific article. It is obvious from the material presented that there is a lack of Standard Methods for testing the toxicological properties of tobacco ingredients in burnt form. The huge number of different approaches presented in this review points to the difficulties in defining suitable methods for this purpose. Despite these limitations, it is justified to state that the data so far available give no evidence that ingredients in use today increase the toxicity of tobacco smoke...|$|E

40|$|Background: To {{reduce the}} {{possibility}} of cigarette appearance misleading consumers about harm caused by the product, the European Commission’s draft <b>Tobacco</b> Products <b>Directive</b> proposed banning cigarettes < 7. 5 mm in diameter. It appears however, following a plenary vote in the European Parliament, that {{this will not be}} part of the final <b>Tobacco</b> Products <b>Directive.</b> To reduce the appeal of cigarettes, the Australian Government banned the use of branding on cigarettes and stipulated a maximum cigarette length as part of the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act. We explored the role, if any, of cigarette appearance on perceptions of appeal and harm among adolescents. Methods: Focus group research with 15 -year-olds (N = 48) was conducted in Glasgow (Scotland) to explore young people’s perceptions of eight cigarettes differing in length, diameter, colour and decorative design. Results: Slim and superslim cigarettes with white filter tips and decorative features were viewed most favourably and rated most attractive across gender and socio-economic groups. The slimmer diameters of these cigarettes communicated weaker tasting and less harmful looking cigarettes. This was closely linked to appeal as thinness implied a more pleasant and palatable smoke for young smokers. A long brown cigarette was viewed as particularly unattractive and communicated a stronger and more harmful product. Conclusion: This exploratory study provides some support that standardising cigarette appearance could reduce the appeal of cigarettes in adolescents and reduce the opportunity for stick design to mislead young smokers in terms of harm...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Sponsorship of Formula One (F 1) motor racing, {{which has}} been used as an {{indirect}} medium of tobacco advertising for several decades, was prohibited by the 2005 European Union <b>Tobacco</b> Advertising <b>Directive.</b> Most F 1 tobacco sponsorship of motor racing in the EU has since ceased, {{with the exception of the}} Scuderia Ferrari team, which continues to be funded by Philip Morris. In 2007, the Marlboro logo on Ferrari cars and other race regalia was replaced by an evolving ‘barcode’ design, which Ferrari later claimed was part of the livery of the car, and not a Marlboro advertisement. Objective To determine whether the ‘barcode’ graphics used by Ferrari represent ‘alibi’ Marlboro advertising. Methods Academic and grey literature, and online tobacco industry document archives, were searched using terms relevant to tobacco marketing and motorsport. Results Tobacco sponsorship of F 1 motor racing began in 1968, and Philip Morris has sponsored F 1 teams since 1972. Phillip Morris first used a ‘barcode’ design, comprising red vertical parallel lines below the word Marlboro on the British Racing Motors F 1 car in 1972. Vertical or horizontal ‘barcode’ designs have been used in this way, latterly without the word Marlboro, ever since. The modern ‘barcode’ logos occupied the same position on cars and drivers' clothing as conventional Marlboro logos in the past. The shared use of red colour by Marlboro and Ferrari is also recognised by Philip Morris as a means of promoting brand association between Marlboro and Ferrari. Conclusion The Ferrari ‘barcode’ designs are alibi Marlboro logos and hence constitute advertising prohibited by the 2005 EU <b>Tobacco</b> Advertising <b>Directive...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis article {{offers a}} {{detailed}} legal and policy {{analysis of the}} most far-reaching and already controversial measures presently envisaged by the reform of the EU <b>Tobacco</b> Products <b>Directive,</b> standardized packaging and visual display bans of tobacco products, under EU law. In line with the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control - the former prohibits logos, colors, brand images, and promotional elements on packaging other than brand names displayed in a mandated size, font and place, whereas the latter forbids the display of tobacco products at points of sale. Although the analysis predominantly focuses on the adoption of EU-wide schemes mandating these measures {{within the framework of}} the revision of the <b>Tobacco</b> Products <b>Directive,</b> it also discusses the legal implications stemming from the adoption of similar mechanisms at the national level. While the actual case law may effectively substantiate the EU's competence to embrace both standardized packaging and display ban, the introduction of these measures, by revealing the shifting nature of the EU overall tobacco policy from the free movement imperative to a public health objective, questions the almost limitless EU's authority to harmonize pursuant the internal market legal basis. In the light of the above, the article examines how these measures score not only under the principle of conferral but also those of proportionality and subsidiarity as well as the trademark system and the fundamental rights regime. Once more, a legislative initiative in the field of tobacco is set to test, under the pressure of the relevant industry, the outer limits not only of EU's legislative action but also of its underlying decision-making process...|$|R
