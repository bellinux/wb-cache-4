5|$|Clearly, some tumors {{evade the}} immune system and go on to become cancers. <b>Tumor</b> <b>cells</b> often have a reduced number of MHC class I {{molecules}} on their surface, thus avoiding detection by killer T cells. Some <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> also release products that inhibit the immune response; for example by secreting the cytokine TGF-β, which suppresses the activity of macrophages and lymphocytes. In addition, immunological tolerance may develop against tumor antigens, so {{the immune system}} no longer attacks the <b>tumor</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|E
5|$|On microscopy, the <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> are {{typically}} described as small, round and blue, and rosette patterns (Homer Wright rosettes) may be seen. Homer Wright rosettes are <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> around the neuropil, {{not to be}} confused with pseudorosettes, which are <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> around a blood vessel. They are also distinct from the pseudorosettes of an ependymoma which consist of <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)–positive processes tapering off toward a blood vessel (thus a combination of the two). A variety of immunohistochemical stains are used by pathologists to distinguish neuroblastomas from histological mimics, such as rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, lymphoma and Wilms' tumor.|$|E

5|$|The main {{response}} {{of the immune system}} to tumors is to destroy the abnormal cells using killer T cells, sometimes with the assistance of helper T cells. Tumor antigens are presented on MHC class I molecules in a similar way to viral antigens. This allows killer T cells to recognize the tumor cell as abnormal. NK cells also kill tumorous cells in a similar way, especially if the <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> have fewer MHC class I molecules on their surface than normal; this is a common phenomenon with tumors. Sometimes antibodies are generated against <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> allowing for their destruction by the complement system.|$|E
40|$|Beta(1) integrins play {{a crucial}} role in {{supporting}} <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> attachment to and invasion into the extracellular matrix. Endotoxin/LPS introduced by surgery has been shown to enhance tumor metastasis in a murine model. Here we show the direct effect of LPS on <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> adhesion and invasion in extracellular matrix proteins through a beta(1) integrin-dependent pathway. The human colorectal <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> lines SW 480 and SW 620 constitutively expressed high levels of the beta(1) subunit, whereas various low levels of alpha(1), alpha(2), alpha(4), and alpha(6) expression were detected. SW 480 and SW 620 did not express membrane-bound CD 14; however, LPS in the presence of soluble CD 14 (sCD 14) significantly up-regulated beta(1) integrin expression; enhanced <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> attachment to fibronectin, collagen I, and laminin; and strongly promoted <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> invasion through the Matrigel. Anti-beta(1) blocking mAbs (4 B 4 and 6 S 6) abrogated LPS- plus sCD 14 -induced <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> adhesion and invasion. Furthermore, LPS, when combined with sCD 14, resulted in NF-kappaB activation in both SW 480 and SW 620 cells. Inhibition of the NF-kappaB pathway significantly attenuated LPS-induced up-regulation of beta(1) integrin expression and prevented <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> adhesion and invasion. These results provide direct evidence that although SW 480 and SW 620 cells do not express membrane-bound CD 14, LPS in the presence of sCD 14 can activate NF-kappaB, up-regulate beta(1) integrin expression, and subsequently promote <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> adhesion and invasion. Moreover, LPS-induced <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> attachment to and invasion through extracellular matrix proteins is beta(1) subunit-dependent...|$|R
40|$|Testicular cancer {{accounts}} for about 1 % of all cancers in men. Malignant testicular tumors are divided into two main groups: germ <b>cell</b> <b>tumors</b> and non-germ <b>cell</b> <b>tumors.</b> Germ <b>cell</b> <b>tumors</b> are subdivided into two groups: seminomas and nonseminomatous germ <b>cell</b> <b>tumors</b> such as embryonal carcinoma, yolk sac tumor, teratoma, choriocarcinoma, and mixed germ <b>cell</b> <b>tumor.</b> Non-germ <b>cell</b> <b>tumors</b> consist of Leydig <b>cell</b> <b>tumor,</b> Sertoli <b>cell</b> <b>tumor,</b> granulosa <b>cell</b> <b>tumors,</b> fibroma–thecoma tumors, mixed sex cord–stromal tumors, lymphoma, leukemia, and metastases.

5|$|Another {{important}} role {{of the immune system}} is to identify and eliminate tumors. This is called immune surveillance. The transformed cells of tumors express antigens that are not found on normal cells. To the immune system, these antigens appear foreign, and their presence causes immune cells to attack the transformed <b>tumor</b> <b>cells.</b> The antigens expressed by tumors have several sources; some are derived from oncogenic viruses like human papillomavirus, which causes cervical cancer, while others are the organism's own proteins that occur at low levels in normal cells but reach high levels in <b>tumor</b> <b>cells.</b> One example is an enzyme called tyrosinase that, when expressed at high levels, transforms certain skin cells (e.g. melanocytes) into tumors called melanomas. A third possible source of tumor antigens are proteins normally important for regulating cell growth and survival, that commonly mutate into cancer inducing molecules called oncogenes.|$|E

5|$|Histologically, cholangiocarcinomas are classically well to {{moderately}} differentiated adenocarcinomas. Immunohistochemistry {{is useful}} in the diagnosis and {{may be used to}} help differentiate a cholangiocarcinoma from hepatocellular carcinoma and metastasis of other gastrointestinal tumors. Cytological scrapings are often nondiagnostic, as these tumors typically have a desmoplastic stroma and, therefore, do not release diagnostic <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> with scrapings.|$|E
40|$|Tumor {{angiogenesis}} {{is essential}} for tumor growth and metastasis, and intratumoral microvessel density correlates with prognosis in breast carcinoma. Yet, how intratumoral microvessel density correlates with <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> and intratumoral endothelial cell proliferation remains incompletely understood. To this end, we stained 57 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded breast carcinomas with antibody MIB 1 to determine <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> Ki 67 labeling index and with anti-CD 34 to observe microvessels. We correlated the <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> Ki 67 labeling index and mitotic figure index with intratumoral microvessel density. Using a double labeling technique combining antibody MIB 1 and anti-CD 34, we measured intratumoral endothelial cell proliferation in 20 of these cases and correlated these findings with <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> Ki 67 labeling index, mitotic figure index, and intratumoral microvessel density. The intratumoral Ki 67 -labeling index was 45 -fold greater (P < 0. 000001) than that of microvessels in adjacent benign breast. Yet, endothelial cell Ki 67 labeling index did not correlate with intratumoral microvessel density, <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> Ki 67 labeling index, or mitotic figure index nor did intratumoral microvessel density correlate with <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> Ki 67 labeling index or mitotic figure index. These findings suggest that, although endothelial cells are actively proliferating within the tumor, intratumoral microvessel density and intratumoral endothelial cell proliferation are independent {{of each other and}} of <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation. Thus, intratumoral microvessel density, endothelial <b>cell</b> proliferation, and <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation may be regulated by separate mechanisms...|$|R

5|$|The {{relationship}} between cellular proliferation and mitochondria {{has been investigated}} using cervical cancer HeLa cells. <b>Tumor</b> <b>cells</b> require an ample amount of ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) in order to synthesize bioactive compounds such as lipids, proteins, and nucleotides for rapid cell proliferation. The majority of ATP in <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> is generated via the oxidative phosphorylation pathway (OxPhos). Interference with OxPhos have shown to cause cell cycle arrest suggesting that mitochondria {{play a role in}} cell proliferation. Mitochondrial ATP production is also vital for cell division in addition to other basic functions in the cell including the regulation of cell volume, solute concentration, and cellular architecture. ATP levels differ at various stages of the cell cycle suggesting that there is a {{relationship between}} the abundance of ATP and the cell's ability to enter a new cell cycle. ATP's role in the basic functions of the cell make the cell cycle sensitive to changes in the availability of mitochondrial derived ATP. The variation in ATP levels at different stages of the cell cycle support the hypothesis that mitochondria {{play an important role in}} cell cycle regulation. Although the specific mechanisms between mitochondria and the cell cycle regulation is not well understood, studies have shown that low energy cell cycle checkpoints monitor the energy capability before committing to another round of cell division.|$|E

Higher-grade endometrioid adenocarcinomas have less well-differentiated cells, have more solid sheets of <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> no longer organized into glands, and {{are associated with}} an atrophied endometrium.

40|$|Activation of the induced {{receptor}} {{for advanced}} glycation endproducts (RAGE) leads to initiation of NF-κB and MAP kinase signaling pathways resulting in propagation and perpetuation of inflammation. RAGE knock out animals are {{less susceptible to}} acute inflammation and carcinogen induced tumor development. We have reported that most forms of <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> death result in release of the RAGE ligand, HMGB 1. We now report a novel role for RAGE in the <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> response to stress. Targeted knockdown of RAGE in the <b>tumor</b> <b>cell,</b> leads to increased apoptosis, diminished autophagy and decreased <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> survival. In contrast, overexpression of RAGE is associated with enhanced autophagy, diminished apoptosis and greater <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> viability. RAGE limits apoptosis through a p 53 dependent mitochondrial pathway. Moreover, RAGE-sustained autophagy is associated with decreased phosphorylation of mTOR and increased Beclin- 1 /VPS 34 autophagosome formation.
