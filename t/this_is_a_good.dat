5|$|The combat was {{generally}} well-received, with some reviewers noting {{that it is}} mostly unchanged from the original Knights of the Old Republic. GameSpot compared the combat from the first Knights of the Old Republic to the second, {{saying that it is}}n't well-balanced in both; however, the reviewer wrote that it helps the combat remain spontaneous. GameZone said that the combat is not changed from the first Knights of the Old Republic to the second, but that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> thing since the combat in the original was enjoyable. IGN praised the game's AI, saying that it is easy to control the main character alone without controlling the party members. GameSpy's reviewer, on the other hand, said that he encountered problems with the combat AI that were not present in the original Knights of the Old Republic.|$|E

25|$|Nowadays {{it appears}} that the almshouses rival the inmates in their decayed circumstances, for, while the black and white paint-work is tidy, the facade shows an {{alarming}} inclination to land at the feet of those who stand in front to admire it. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> little build¬ing, adding much to the town's seafront, and worthy of careful renovation. Happily the James Butcher Housing Association is now undertaking this work.|$|E
25|$|Other ways of {{measuring}} innovation {{have traditionally been}} expenditure, for example, investment in R (Research and Development) as percentage of GNP (Gross National Product). Whether <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> measurement of innovation has been widely discussed and the Oslo Manual has incorporated some of the critique against earlier methods {{of measuring}}. The traditional methods of measuring still inform many policy decisions. The EU Lisbon Strategy has set as a goal that their average expenditure on R should be 3% of GDP.|$|E

25|$|In 1908, Latvian {{linguists}} Kārlis Mīlenbahs and Jānis Endzelīns elaborated {{the modern}} Latvian alphabet, which slowly replaced the old orthography used before. Another {{feature of the}} language, in common with its sister language Lithuanian, that was developed at that time is that proper names from other countries and languages are altered phonetically to fit the phonological system of Latvian. Even if the original language also uses the Latin alphabet, this process takes place. Moreover, the names are modified {{in order to ensure}} that they have noun declension endings, declining like all other nouns. For example, a place such as Lecropt (a Scottish parish) is likely to become Lekropta; the Scottish village of Tillicoultry becomes Tilikutrija. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> example of linguistic purism in this language.|$|E
25|$|The urate to {{creatinine}} (breakdown {{product of}} creatine phosphate in muscle) concentration ratio in urine is elevated. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> indicator of acid overproduction. For children under {{ten years of}} age with LNS, a urate to creatinine ratio above two is typically found. Twenty-four-hour urate excretion of more than 20mg/kg is also typical but is not diagnostic. Hyperuricemia (serum uric acid concentration of >8mg/dL) is often present but not reliable enough for diagnosis. Activity of the HGPRT enzyme in cells from any type of tissue (e.g., blood, cultured fibroblasts, or lymphoblasts) that is less than 1.5% of normal enzyme activity confirms the diagnosis of Lesch–Nyhan syndrome. Molecular genetic studies of the HPRT gene mutations may confirm diagnosis, and are particularly helpful for subsequent 'carrier testing' in at-risk females such as close family relatives on the female side.|$|E
25|$|Recombination {{frequency}} is {{a measure}} of genetic linkage and is used {{in the creation of a}} genetic linkage map. Recombination frequency (θ) is the frequency with which a single chromosomal crossover will take place between two genes during meiosis. A centimorgan (cM) is a unit that describes a recombination frequency of 1%. In this way we can measure the genetic distance between two loci, based upon their recombination frequency. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> estimate of the real distance. Double crossovers would turn into no recombination. In this case we cannot tell if crossovers took place. If the loci we're analysing are very close (less than 7 cM) a double crossover is very unlikely. When distances become higher, the likelihood of a double crossover increases. As the likelihood of a double crossover increases we systematically underestimate the genetic distance between two loci.|$|E
2500|$|Later {{amendments}} of the Homestead Act allocated more land, {{as much as}} {{in other}} words, <b>a</b> section. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> revision to apply to land that was drier or more desolate than the earlier, more desirable lands already settled.

500|$|To {{help fund}} the future works, the church {{announced}} plans in January 2008 to sell [...] of undeveloped, wooded property it owns on Hampton Lane to Shelter Development Corp. {{for construction of}} a senior citizen housing complex. A zoning change application was submitted to Baltimore County officials to allow sixteen residential units per acre (current zoning limits density to two residential units per acre) {{for a total of}} 80100beds. The Hampton Improvement Association, representing neighboring Hampton, Maryland residents, said they [...] "...oppose zoning changes that would allow higher density residential development and require trees to be knocked down". Then-pastor David Cooney told the Baltimore Sun, [...] "We entered into this with Shelter, believing <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> use for the land [...] that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> company and a needed service". In the face of community objections, however, Shelter and the church subsequently announced on March 3, 2008, that the development plans had been dropped. A Shelter official said that his company and Towson United Methodist Church had jointly {{come to the conclusion that}} [...] "this is not something we are going to pursue". Pastor Cooney said, [...] "It had become clear that we weren't going to be able to reach a compromise and we certainly don't want to be at war with our neighbors". In the wake of the plan's shelving, the president of the Hampton Improvement Association told the Towson Times that his group wishes to work with Towson United Methodist Church to find an alternative use for the land besides commercial development, as they [...] "don't want to preclude the church from trying to get some money out of it." [...] In April 2008, Dr. Cooney said that the church [...] "did not set out to sell this land; the proposal came to us, and we have no other plans to sell or develop the land".|$|E
500|$|IGN's regular Fringe {{reviewer}} Ramsey Isler {{rated the}} episode 8/10. He compared the plot to Lost, remarking [...] "Apparently one thoroughly confusing and unnecessarily convoluted TV series wasn't enough... But hey, I understand why J.J. and his Fringe collaborators... {{might have done}} this. They had kind of written themselves into a corner {{where one of the}} universes had to go, and they couldn't stretch that storyline out forever. A restart like <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> way to allow themselves room to write something new, even if it may require some clever thinking to explain themselves out of this situation adequately." [...] Isler had trouble rating the finale, noting that he had to see how the events are explained in the fourth season before he can make a complete judgment.|$|E
500|$|The result marked Manchester United's first Shield {{defeat in}} 13 years, {{and was the}} ninth time Arsenal had won the Charity Shield. Arsenal became the first {{southern}} club since Tottenham Hotspur in 1962 to win the Shield outright. Wenger described the scoreline as [...] "unexpected" [...] and cited the first goal as crucial in the match, given the weather conditions. He was content with how his international players, {{who had been in}} the World Cup, coped with the game's physicality. Wenger believed the result gave Arsenal a psychological boost for the Champions League campaign, as the club planned to stage their home matches at Wembley Stadium. Bergkamp felt the result showed that Arsenal had what it took to retain the Premier League title: [...] "We've still got the same mentality and that will be the basis for this year's challenge. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> start.

[...] The Journal of Information Ethics wrote, [...] "This is less an analytic study than a personal survey of situations or occurrences articulated in an informal, colloquial, and anecdotal fashion. It is not aimed at the intelligentsia or legal profession, although members of these groups would certainly benefit from the details."
