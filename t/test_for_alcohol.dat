Bolte and the occupants of the other car were taken to the Ballarat Base Hospital, where blood samples were taken to <b>test</b> <b>for</b> <b>alcohol</b> levels.

Subsequently, further samples were collected from the hospital by the police, but these were found to have been substituted, and the sample box containing them had been unlocked by an unknown person. An enquiry found that it would have been unfair to proceed with prosecution because of interference with the evidence.|$|E

500|$|The storyline in this episode, which {{features}} Tracy having to wear an ankle bracelet to monitor alcohol levels in his sweat {{due to a}} {{driving under the influence}} arrest, is based on events which actually happened to actor Tracy Morgan, who portrays Tracy Jordan. Morgan has twice been arrested for drunk driving: once in December 2005 and once in November 2006. He was sentenced to 36 months probation, fined US$390, and mandated to attend an alcohol education program at the 2005 arrest. As a result of the 2006 arrest, Morgan was fined US$1000 and had his drivers license suspended for six months. Morgan was also ordered to wear a Secure Continuous Remote Alcohol Monitoring (SCRAM), [...] "an ankle bracelet worn to <b>test</b> <b>for</b> <b>alcohol</b> vapors that come out of the skin".|$|E

30|$|Results: Overall, 4518 major TBI {{patients}} {{were seen in}} provincial hospitals during the study period. The mean age of TBI patients was 51 [*]±[*] 25  years; 72  % were male. The majority of injuries {{were the result of}} blunt trauma (93  %), with relatively few major TBIs resulting from penetrating trauma (7  %). The most common mechanisms of injury were falls (46  %) and motor vehicle crashes (27  %). Analysis of census-based subpopulations demonstrated that injury rates varied significantly by geography (from 25 to 65 TBIs per 100, 000 population). <b>Testing</b> <b>for</b> <b>alcohol</b> was performed in 43  % of cases. Patients who were <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> <b>alcohol</b> tended to be male (79  %) and middle-aged (mean age 44 [*]±[*] 20  years). A positive BAC (i.e., ≥ 2  mmol/L) was found in 47  % of patients who were tested. Mean acute LOS was similar for all three BAC groups. Mortality was independently predicted by increasing age (odds ratio [OR][*]=[*] 1.01; p[*]<[*] 0.001), male gender (OR[*]=[*] 1.30; p[*]=[*] 0.049), an ISS between 16 and 75 (OR[*]=[*] 2.67; p[*]<[*] 0.001), a maximum AIS head of 5 or 6 (OR[*]=[*] 3.21; p[*]<[*] 0.001), injuries occurring outside of the capital city of Halifax (OR[*]=[*] 1.70; p[*]<[*] 0.001), and having a lower BAC level (OR[*]=[*] 0.99; p[*]<[*] 0.001).|$|R

40|$|For {{the second}} time in succession, the Regional Organization for Traffic Safety {{conducted}} an alcohol campaign in the Dutch province of North Brabant, at the end of 1990 and the beginning of 1991.

On the basis of these data collected by the police, the SWOV Institute for Road Safety Research investigated the effects of the campaign on alcohol use by car drivers in the province of North Brabant. The most important results of the study were: (1) After the end of the campaign, alcohol use by car drivers in the province of North Brabant appeared to been have stabilized at a relatively low level, compared with the before situation; (2) In comparison with previous measurements, no further decrease was found in alcohol use by car drivers; (3) Male drivers between 25 and 50 years of age were found to be the most problematic age group; (4) Alcohol use increased strongly, particularly later on in the night-time; and (5) On Friday night the number of offenders were twice as much as on Saturday night...|$|R

50|$|Since 2007, St. Viator High School {{has used}} hair samples to test {{each of its}} 1,000 {{students}} for drugs {{in the fall and}} then conduct random screens {{during the rest of the}} school year. Starting in 2013, the school will also <b>test</b> <b>for</b> <b>alcohol.</b> Private schools have broader legal authority to test students for illegal substances than their public counterparts. And while a few area public high schools do conduct drug testing, the practice is limited to teens in sports or other extracurricular activities. Yet even among private schools, testing students' hair for alcohol use appears to be particularly rare. The testing company, Massachusetts-based Psychemedics Corp., said St. Viator is among a handful nationwide using the company's new hair <b>test</b> <b>for</b> <b>alcohol.</b> At St. Viator, students are notified of their mandatory testing appointments on the morning of the test. At lunchtime, a school official snips off a sample of about 60 hairs from the crown of each chosen student's head. The alcohol test measures ethyl glucuronide, or EtG, to indicate alcohol consumption in the previous three months. The tests take about a week to process and are capable of indicating a minimum average consumption of two to three drinks per week. Students who test positive must attend a meeting with their parents, counselor and the school president. After 100 days, the student must pay about $85 for another test, and a second positive could lead to expulsion. Private schools can in general mandate drug and alcohol tests at their own discretion.|$|E

Lion Laboratories won the Queen's Award for Technological Achievement in 1980 for development of the first hand-held electronic breath-alcohol instrument (Alcolmeter), and this device was later marketed worldwide.

40|$|Abstract. Although most {{research}} {{on the effect of}} minimum legal drinking age (LDA) laws on proxies for alcohol-related fatalities find effects of higher LDAs in reducing such fatalities, recent research that supposedly controls for drinking expe-rience claims that higher LDAs have little or no effect. This study examines the actual amount of alcohol in the blood of fatally injured drivers per licensed driver in states where more than 80 percent of such drivers were <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> <b>alcohol</b> and where licensure data were available for the period 1982 - 1986. The involvement of alcohol in fatal crashes increases with age as the LDA is approached. A higher LDA is associated with fewer alcohol-related crashes among those younger than the LDA. No effect of drinking experience was evident, but this study finds an age-related bias in previously used proxies <b>for</b> <b>alcohol</b> involvement that results in overestimates of alcohol levels in younger drivers...|$|R

NHTSA specifically notes that alcohol-related {{does not necessarily mean}} a driver or non-occupant was <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> <b>alcohol</b> and that the term does not indicate a collision or fatality was caused by the presence of alcohol. On average, about 60% of the BAC values are missing or unknown. To analyze what they believe is the complete data, statisticians simulate BAC information.
