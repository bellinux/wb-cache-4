5|$|Congress {{passed the}} Organic Act of 1871, which {{repealed}} the individual charters {{of the cities}} of Washington and Georgetown, and created a new <b>territorial</b> <b>government</b> for the whole District of Columbia. President Grant appointed Alexander Robey Shepherd {{to the position of}} governor in 1873. Shepherd authorized large-scale projects that greatly modernized Washington, but ultimately bankrupted the District government. In 1874, Congress replaced the <b>territorial</b> <b>government</b> with an appointed three-member Board of Commissioners.|$|E
5|$|The {{modern day}} <b>territorial</b> <b>government</b> has matured in Yellowknife to become {{effective}} and responsible. The government in Yellowknife had largely gained back its powers on par with the pre-1905 government that was dissolved during creation of Alberta and Saskatchewan. The civil service has been effectively consolidated into the city of Yellowknife; and has gained control over administering its own elections from Elections Canada. Education is now {{under the jurisdiction of}} the <b>territorial</b> <b>government</b> and the territory has most powers afforded to the rest of the provinces. There has even talk by the Federal government of the territories gaining provincial status in the future.|$|E

5|$|Harrison {{began his}} {{political}} career when he resigned from the military effective June 1, 1798. and campaigned among {{his friends and family}} for a post in the Northwest <b>Territorial</b> <b>government.</b> With the aid of his close friend Timothy Pickering, who was serving as U.S. Secretary of State, Harrison received a recommendation to replace Withrop Sargent, the outgoing territorial secretary. President John Adams appointed Harrison to the position in July 1798. Harrison frequently served as acting territorial governor during the absences of Governor Arthur St. Clair.|$|E
5|$|The Government of Canada {{purchased}} the North-Western Territory and Rupert's Land from the Hudson's Bay Company in 1868, {{under the terms}} of the Rupert's Land Act 1868 for £300,000 British pounds. Both purchased territories were largely uninhabited, consisting mostly of uncharted wilderness. After the purchase, the Government decided to merge both of the properties into a single jurisdiction and appoint a single <b>territorial</b> <b>government</b> to run both. The purchase of the two territories added a sizable portion of the current Canadian landmass.|$|E

5|$|The {{council was}} short-lived: {{there was just}} one {{legislative}} session. Less than a year after its formation, the smallpox crisis in the District of Keewatin subsided. The Department of the Interior determined that a <b>territorial</b> <b>government</b> for the district was no longer needed. The entire council resigned and was effectively dissolved after being requested to do so on April 16, 1877, by Secretary of State James Aikins. Aikins had the council resign as a cost-saving measure; also he did not want members of the council to abuse the powers of their appointments.|$|E
5|$|The {{first session}} of the Forty-second Congress convened on March 4, 1871. During his first term, Parker helped to secure {{pensions}} for veterans in his district and campaigned for a new federal building {{to be built in}} St. Joseph. He sponsored a failed bill designed to enfranchise women and allow them to hold public office in United States territories. He also sponsored legislation to organize the Indian Territory under a <b>territorial</b> <b>government.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>territorial</b> <b>government</b> {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Premier Frederick Haultain struck a deal with the federal Government of Canada in early 1905 to bring provincial powers to the territories. This {{led to the creation of}} the provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta from the southernmost and most populous areas of the territory. The Northwest Territories, reduced to its northern, lightly populated hinterland, continued to exist under the 1870s constitutional status under control of the federal government. A new council was convened in Ottawa, Ontario to deal with the region.|$|E

Lānaʻi, and Kahoʻolawe). During this term, his brother-in-law, Joseph Apukai Akina, would serve as Speaker of the House of Representatives while his son-in-law David Kalei Kahaulelio served as sergeant-at-arm of the Senate.|$|E
5|$|A NAC {{meeting was}} held outside Blantyre on 25 January. It was {{alleged that the}} meeting {{discussed}} in detail {{a plan for the}} overthrow of the <b>territorial</b> <b>government</b> and the massacre of the territory's whites and any blacks who collaborated with them. (although a subsequent Royal Commission found there was insufficient evidence to make such a claim). Welensky obtained the meeting's proceedings in early February and decided to act, calling a meeting of the federal and territorial governments. Federal troops were deployed to Nyasaland on 21 February, the Governor proclaimed a state of emergency on 3 March and the nationalist leaders were arrested and flown to jails in Southern Rhodesia. In the subsequent fortnight, riots broke out and troops used force to end the violence. Almost 50 people died in the unrest.|$|E
5|$|During {{his initial}} {{session in the}} {{territorial}} legislature in 1850, Deady served on the judicial committee and helped draft many of the laws in the territory. The Oregon Territory had just been created by the United States Congress in 1848, with the <b>territorial</b> <b>government</b> taking control in early 1849. Following the 1850 to 1851 session, {{the secretary of the}} territory, Edward D. Hamilton, asked Deady to assist in publishing the laws passed by the legislature for all previous sessions of the legislative assembly. Deady helped with this process, in what became the first volume of laws published in Oregon.|$|E

5|$|English and French are {{recognized}} by the Constitution of Canada as official languages. All federal government laws are thus enacted in both English and French, with government services available in both languages. Two of Canada's territories give official status to indigenous languages. In Nunavut, Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun are official languages alongside the national languages of English and French, and Inuktitut is a common vehicular language in <b>territorial</b> <b>government.</b> In the Northwest Territories, the Official Languages Act declares that there are eleven different languages: Chipewyan, Cree, English, French, Gwich'in, Inuinnaqtun, Inuktitut, Inuvialuktun, North Slavey, South Slavey and Tłįchǫ. Multicultural media are widely accessible {{across the country and}} offer specialty television channels, newspapers and other publications in many minority languages.|$|E
5|$|In 1808, when Congressman Benjamin Parke {{resigned}} from office, Harrison ordered {{a special election}} to fill the vacancy. Jennings entered the race against Harrison's candidate, Thomas Randolph, the attorney general for the territory, and John Johnson, a Vincennes native who {{had the support of}} the antislavery group. Randolph promised not to introduce slavery into the territory unless the majority of his constituents agreed, while Johnson remained silent on the issue. Jennings, an antislavery candidate from the eastern portion of the territory, rode from settlement to settlement to give speeches against slavery. Jennings spoke against what he believed to be Randolph's aristocratic tendencies, ties to Harrison's <b>territorial</b> <b>government,</b> and the issue of slavery in the territory. Jennings found his greatest support among the growing Quaker community {{in the eastern part of}} the territory.|$|E
5|$|Lovejoy {{was elected}} in 1848 to {{what would be the}} final session of the Provisional Legislature, which was held in late 1848 into early 1849. However, Lovejoy now {{representing}} Vancouver District north of the Columbia River resigned before the session started. In September 1848, he traveled with a group to California during the California Gold Rush, but returned aboard the brig Undine in January 1849 after six weeks in California. During the same session he resigned from, he was selected by the Provisional Legislature as Supreme Judge of the government on February 16, 1849, but never served and the Provisional government was dissolved the following month {{with the arrival of the}} <b>territorial</b> <b>government.</b>|$|E

40|$|The article {{analyses}} {{the veto}} power of <b>territorial</b> <b>governments</b> in Brazil, {{by examining the}} parliamentary behaviour of state caucuses (bancadas) {{as well as their}} institutional veto opportunities when it comes to matters related to sub-national governments’ revenues and decision-making authority over their own taxes, policy responsibilities and expenditures. The “imposition of losses” upon <b>territorial</b> <b>governments</b> characterized legislative production during the 1989 - 2006 period, even though these decisions were intensely negotiated. The article concludes that the decision-making centralization at the central arenas, the absence of additional veto arenas and the ease with which constitutional amendments may be approved characterize decision-making on federal issues in Brazil. Furthermore, state caucuses (bancadas) do not act as collective players, since they vote divided along party lines. These institutional factors limit the veto power of <b>territorial</b> <b>governments</b> in Brazil...|$|R
5|$|The Queen {{was also}} remembered for her support of Buddhist and Shinto priests in Hawaii {{and became one}} of the first Native Hawaiians to attend a Vesak Day (Buddha's Birthday) celebration of May 19, 1901, at the Honwangji mission. Her {{attendance}} in the celebration helped Buddhism and Shintoism gain acceptance into Hawaiian society and prevented the possible banning of the two religions by the <b>Territorial</b> <b>government.</b> Her presence was also widely reported in Chinese and Japanese newspapers throughout the world, and earned her the respect of many Japanese people both in Hawaii and in Japan itself.|$|E
5|$|The {{rebellion}} {{resulted in}} the creation of the Province of Manitoba (inclusive of Fort Garry) and a delay in establishing governance in the Territories. In 1870, the Northwest Territories and Manitoba formally entered the Canadian confederation. The two jurisdictions remained partially conjoined: under the Temporary Government Act, 1870. The Temporary North-West Council was appointed in 1872, mainly from members of the new Manitoba Legislative Assembly, with the Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba serving as the leader of the <b>territorial</b> <b>government.</b> The Governor and Council were mandated to govern the Territories through the Manitoba Act and did so from outside of the Northwest Territories. Fort Garry served as the first seat of government for both jurisdictions.|$|E
5|$|Given Alaska's limited {{road and}} rail infrastructure, the <b>territorial</b> <b>government</b> saw the {{advantages}} of aerial transport. In 1925, the territorial legislature authorized the spending of up to $40,000 per year on airfield construction. Between that year and 1927, more than 20 airfields were built. By 1930, Alaska had more than 100. In Fairbanks, airplanes flew from a field that doubled as a baseball diamond until 1931, when the city bought the field, installed infrastructure, and named it Weeks Field. By the late 1930s, {{there were more than}} four dozen airplanes in the town of about 3,000 people, giving Fairbanks the reputation of having the most airplanes per capita in the world. Because of Fairbanks' location halfway between New York City and Tokyo, it became a crucial stop on the first around-the-world flights. Wiley Post's 1933 solo circumnavigation stopped in Fairbanks, as did Howard Hughes' 1938 effort.|$|E
