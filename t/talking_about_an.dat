It made sense because it opened up for us a way of <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>an</b> actual poem in an actual classroom, and because the technique of focusing upon a poem as language rather than as history or biography or morality, gave a whole new meaning to and justification for the teaching of poetry (qtd. in Singh 1991).|$|E

When SCORE launched in 1958, Barbree broadcast the story, knowing the military would not deny it once the satellite was in space.|$|E

[...] "You're <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>an</b> institutional nightmare," [...] said Tim Weiner, author of the book [...] Former 9/11 Commission chairman Lee H.

40|$|In this paper, I {{will analyze}} {{the use of}} the ﬁrst person pronoun “Watashi ha” and “Watashi φ” in conversations about “personal matters”. With {{reference}} to Kushida. s (2006) procedures in the opening of “personal matters talk”, in this paper I will present the following six ways of openings: <b>a)</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> new “personal matter” when inserting reason description/explanation, b) <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> common experience as an example, c) emphasizing a contrasting experience as an example, d) creating <b>an</b> opportunity to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> one. s own experience, e) <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> “personal matter” as a topic change, f) <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> “personal matter” as a response. Moreover, I will analyze the frequency of “Watashi ha” and “Watashi φ” in each of the openings. The ﬁndings showed that “Watashi φ” can be used in most of the cases. However, in the case of c) emphasizing a contrasting experience as an example and f) <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> “personal matter” as a response, the use of “Watashi ha” is preferred...|$|R

500|$|Jackson met 15-year-old actress/model Brooke Shields in 1981, at the Academy Awards. From there, {{the pair}} enjoyed a close relationship. Speaking in 2009, she {{reflected}} {{that they were}} close because sex was never an issue for them. Although the headlines in the media referred to Shields' <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>an</b> [...] "asexual Jackson" [...] after his death, what she actually said was, “As he grew older and the more he started to change physically, the more asexual he became to me.” She also said that as she grew up and started having boyfriends, she would confide in him about her intimate experiences, as he was curious. She said, [...] "he was {{like a little kid}} who talked about the bases – what first base was, what second base was" [...] – and his curiosity was understandable given his guarded life.|$|E
500|$|Seen {{as a joke}} {{referencing}} {{the demise}} of the Beatles' record label, the Apple logo was presented on Extra Texture as an eaten-away apple core. In addition, the blue inner-sleeve photo of Harrison – [...] "grinning like a Monty Python choirboy", in the words of Robert Christgau – was captioned [...] "OHNOTHIMAGEN" [...] ("Oh not him again"), Harrison's self-deprecating take on his dwindling popularity in 1974–75. The album's full title was a pun on the slogan that street-corner paperboys would yell out to sell late-breaking news editions of their newspapers: [...] "Extra! Extra! Read all about it!" [...] Harrison had intended to call the album Ohnothimagen, until a studio discussion with Paul Stallworth suggested an alternative. According to Harrison, just as he himself was <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>an</b> overdub needing something [...] "extra", Stallworth happened to say the word [...] "texture".|$|E
500|$|Even if the Nazko swarm were {{a warning}} of a {{volcanic}} eruption, Hickson doubted {{it would turn}} out to be a highly explosive eruption like those that can occur in subduction-zone volcanoes. [...] "We're not <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>an</b> injection of tonnes of ash many kilometers into the air like the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption or the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption. We're talking about something very small, relatively localized that should have a fairly limited impact... but it'll be extremely exciting", Hickson said. If an eruption were to occur, Hickson suggested that it would be characterized by a lava fountain that sends globs of lava [...] into the air. This is similar to those that occur in Hawaii. Hickson said that a Nazko eruption could be a tourist attraction, but warned that noxious gases such as carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide would be released during the event.|$|E

Early in their marriage they had a low income, and Branch's husband took on several odd jobs, {{in addition to his}} work as a youth pastor, {{in order to make a}} living. He describes living with Branch in a [...] "shabby place" [...] in Tulsa, Oklahoma where they struggled to pay $480 a month in rent. Later they bought a house in Tulsa, and rented it out while they were living in Colorado; they got into financial difficulties when the tenants stopped paying the rent, and they accepted the bank's decision to foreclose the mortgage, as that cleared their debt. They appeared on the Christian news magazine program, the 700 Club, <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>an</b> incident in which their baby daughter was revived after drowning in their bathtub, and they attributed their child's survival to the power of prayer, having been inspired after seeing The Passion of the Christ a few days earlier.|$|E
500|$|According to Greil Marcus, Martin Scorsese {{said that}} the first fifteen minutes of his 1976 film Taxi Driver was based on Astral Weeks. Marcus {{referred}} {{to the impact of}} the album, calling it a [...] "common language", and relates that [...] "I was so shocked when I was teaching a seminar at Princeton just a couple years ago, and out of 16 students, four of them said their favorite album was Astral Weeks." [...] Marcus goes on to say, [...] "Now, how did it enter their lives? We're <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>an</b> album that was recorded well before they were born, and yet it spoke to them. They understood its language as soon as they heard it." [...] Elvis Costello described Astral Weeks as [...] "still the most adventurous record made in the rock medium, and there hasn't been a record with that amount of daring made since". Johnny Depp, in a Rolling Stone interview in 2008, recalled how when he was a preteen his older brother (by ten years), tiring of Johnny's favourite music of the time said, [...] "'Try this.' And he put on Van Morrison's Astral Weeks. And it stirred me. I'd never heard anything like it." [...] Joan Armatrading has said that Astral Weeks was the first album she purchased as a teenager and that it opened her up musically. In August 2010, director and choreographer, Jessica Wallenfels, staged a production in Portland, Oregon of a rock opera/story ballet of Astral Weeks called [...] "Find me Beside You".|$|E

John Evenson, who never ate supper, lolled on the sofa, and amused himself by contradicting everybody. O’Bleary ate {{as much as he}} could conveniently carry, and Mrs. Tibbs felt a due degree of indignation thereat; Mr. Gobler and Mrs. Bloss conversed most affectionately on the subject of pill-taking, and other innocent amusements; and Tomkins and Wisbottle ‘got into an argument;’ that is to say, they both talked very loudly and vehemently, each flattering himself that he had got some advantage about something, and neither of them having more than a very indistinct idea of what they were <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> <b>An</b> hour or two passed away; and the boarders and the plated candlesticks retired in pairs to their respective bedrooms. John Evenson pulled off his boots, locked his door, and determined to sit up until Mr. Gobler had retired. He always sat in the drawing-room an hour after everybody else had left it, taking medicine, and groaning.|$|E
60|$|Such was {{the angle}} of Shaw's {{energetic}} attack; {{and it is not}} to be denied that there was exaggeration in it, and what is so much worse, omission. The argument might easily be carried too far; it might end with a scene of screaming torture in the Inquisition as a corrective to the too amiable view of a clergyman in The Private Secretary. But the controversy is definitely worth recording, if only as an excellent example of the author's aggressive attitude and his love of turning the tables in debate. Moreover, though this point of view involves a potential overstatement, it also involves an important truth. One of the best points urged in the course of it was this, that though vice is punished in conventional drama, the punishment is not really impressive, because it is not inevitable or even probable. It does not arise out of the evil act. Years afterwards Bernard Shaw urged this argument again in connection with his friend Mr. Granville Barker's play of Waste, in which the woman dies from an illegal operation. Bernard Shaw said, truly enough, that if she had died from poison or a pistol shot it would have left everyone unmoved, for pistols do not in their nature follow female unchastity. Illegal operations very often do. The punishment was one which might follow the crime, not only in that case, but in many cases. Here, I think, the whole argument might be sufficiently cleared up by saying that the objection to such things on the stage is a purely artistic objection. There is nothing wrong in <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>an</b> illegal operation; there are plenty of occasions when it would be very wrong not to talk about it. But it may easily be just a shade too ugly for the shape of any work of art. There is nothing wrong about being sick; but if Bernard Shaw wrote a play in which all the characters expressed their dislike of animal food by vomiting on the stage, I think we should be justified in saying that the thing was outside, not the laws of morality, but the framework of civilised literature. The instinctive movement of repulsion which everyone has when hearing of the operation in Waste is not an ethical repulsion at all. But it is an æsthetic repulsion, and a right one.|$|E
