40|$|Women {{living with}} {{rheumatoid}} arthritis are restricted in {{their choice of}} footwear by the deformities in their feet. Research has shown that this in turn limits the choice of clothes they can wear, where they can go {{and what they can}} do. Despite pioneering work undertaken in the design of comfort footwear, there is an ongoing disconnection between the approaches of an aesthetically <b>trained</b> <b>shoe</b> designer, and a medically trained foot clinician. This {{can be seen in the}} context of specialist therapeutic footwear, and on the high street where the socially and personally expressive aesthetics of fashion are often in conflict with the functional understandings held within medicine. A more sensate and dynamic view of clothing is explored, to suggest how this opens up the study of the physical, bio-medical body alongside the clothed, socio-cultural body. The authors propose that the personal, social and functional complexity of footwear brings a unique opportunity for research at the intersection of fashion design and medicine, where mutually limiting attitudes and practices can be identified. We outline the potential for re-orientation in the ‘patient’/health practitioner and ‘user’/design practitioner relationships and indicate how social innovation may be fostered through inclusive and participatory design method...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{harvesting}} allows making sensors or transmitters electrically autonomous. Several {{studies have}} been proposed {{but in most cases}} lack of electrical and mechanical parts integration and practical application purpose. Here, with the aim of supply a Bluetooth step-counter placed in the sole of a <b>training</b> <b>shoe,</b> a complete system is presented. It consists of a magnetoinductive transducer embedded with an electronic interface for power conditioning and exploits only the energy recovered by the impact on the ground. A 27 × 16 mm cylindrical device containing the transducer, the electronic interface, the step-counter electronics and the protective shell is developed. Energy recovery derives from the magnet free oscillation following the shoe impact. The proposed interface exploits pulse width modulation to perform transducer output rectification and to emulate optimal load impedance while charging a storage capacitor. Numerical and experimental analysis show effective optimal resistive load emulation and energy recovery gain of 2 compared to the standard AC-DC interface. Prototypes has been manufactured and tested. Considering a sample foot-step, energy recovery is 360 μJ against 400 μJ dissipated on optimal resistor. Mean energy recovery over a complete run is 644 μJ/foot-step. In spite of variable excitation, energy recovery at each foot-step is larger than the required and allows the step-counter transmitting the information...|$|R
