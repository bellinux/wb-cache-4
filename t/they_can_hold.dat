5|$|The post is {{somewhat}} analogous to a Secretary in a State government. But because of seniority, office-bearers can hold senior positions {{such as that}} of Principal Secretary of a state government department, and in Union Territories, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>hold</b> the position of Chief Secretary of a UT government.|$|E
5|$|The {{objective}} in a detonation level is to plant and detonate explosive devices {{on a number}} of enemy positions, which can consist of anti-aircraft guns, tanks and armored cars. Some positions must be hit twice for them to be destroyed. Players can protect their positions by defusing the explosives before they detonate. In one variation of this game mode, one side has to defend their positions for a set amount of time, with the destruction of each piece of equipment giving the enemy team more time. The defenders win if <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>hold</b> their positions long enough for the time to run out, while the attackers win when all objectives have been destroyed. In the alternate version, both teams must attack the other's objectives while defending their own. The first team to destroy all of the enemy's equipment wins.|$|E
25|$|The main {{motivation}} {{cited for}} this shift is that commuters prefer papers which <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>hold</b> easily on public transport, {{and it is}} presumably hoped that other readers will also find the smaller formats more convenient.|$|E

25|$|Most {{familiar}} systems cannot achieve negative temperatures because adding energy always {{increases their}} entropy. However, some systems have a {{maximum amount of}} energy that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>hold,</b> and as they approach that maximum energy their entropy actually begins to decrease. Because temperature {{is defined by the}} relationship between energy and entropy, such a system's temperature becomes negative, even though energy is being added. As a result, the Boltzmann factor for states of systems at negative temperature increases rather than decreases with increasing state energy. Therefore, no complete system, i.e. including the electromagnetic modes, can have negative temperatures, since there is no highest energy state , so that the sum of the probabilities of the states would diverge for negative temperatures. However, for quasi-equilibrium systems (e.g. spins out of equilibrium with the electromagnetic field) this argument does not apply, and negative effective temperatures are attainable.|$|E
25|$|The debates {{lasted about}} 90 minutes each, {{did not include}} commercials, and had a preset time for each answer and each reply, and the {{obligation}} to film only the speaking person at any given time. The candidates were also forbidden to bring any kind of notes with them, even though they could write some down during the debate, and no audience was allowed to participate. This set of rules was very unusual in Italian political talk shows, where politicians usually interrupt each other, talk simultaneously and {{for as long as}} <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>hold</b> the word. Questions to candidates are posted by two journalists from the Italian press: the moderator himself was not allowed to ask any questions, but only to present the debate and guarantee respect of the rules. At the end of the debates, the candidates are allowed to make a final statement of 3 minutes.|$|E

500|$|The Beatles signed Epstein's first {{management}} contract, but Epstein did not. He {{later told}} Taylor, [...] "Well, {{if they ever}} want to tear it up, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>hold</b> me but I can't hold them". (Note: English law would have enforced the contract through the doctrine of part performance). The contract stated that Epstein would receive a management commission of 25 per cent of the group's gross income after a certain financial threshold had been reached. The Beatles argued for a smaller percentage, but Epstein pointed {{out that he had}} been paying their expenses for months without receiving anything in return. On 1 October 1962, four days before the release of [...] "Love Me Do", Epstein signed Lennon and McCartney to a three-year NEMS publishing contract.|$|E
500|$|... "Ghosttown" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by American singer Madonna for her thirteenth studio album, Rebel Heart (2015). It was released to radio stations on March 13, 2015, as the album's second single. The song was written by Madonna, Jason Evigan, Evan Bogart, and Sean Douglas, and produced by Madonna, Billboard and Evigan. Madonna had listened to Douglas's previous works and had requested studio time with him. Together with the other songwriters, they wrote [...] "Ghosttown" [...] in three days. A pop ballad, the song {{was inspired by the}} imagery of a destroyed city after armageddon, and how the survivors carry on with their lives, with love being the only thing <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>hold</b> onto.

500|$|The chicks are {{at first}} covered with greyish-white down and develop rapidly. Within a week <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>hold</b> their heads up and shuffle {{around in the}} nest. The female tears up the food brought by the male and {{distributes}} it to the chicks. Initially these make a [...] "chittering" [...] sound but this soon changes into a food-demanding [...] "snore". By two weeks old they are already half their adult weight and look naked {{as the amount of}} down is insufficient to cover their growing bodies. By three weeks old, quills are starting to push through the skin and the chicks stand, making snoring noises with wings raised and tail stumps waggling, begging for food items which are now given whole. The male is the main provider of food until all the chicks are at least four weeks old at which time the female begins to leave the nest and starts to roost elsewhere. By the sixth week the chicks are as big as the adults but have slimmed down somewhat by the ninth week when they are fully fledged and start leaving the nest briefly themselves. They are still dependent on the parent birds until about thirteen weeks and receive training from the female in finding, and eventually catching, prey.|$|E
