40|$|Two-photon {{excitation}} {{fluorescence microscopy}} allows in vivo high-resolution imaging of human skin structure and biochemistry with a penetration depth over 100 mm. The major damage mechanism during two-photon skin imaging {{is associated with}} the formation of cavitation at the epidermal-dermal junction, which results in <b>thermal</b> mechanical <b>damage</b> of the tissue. In this report, we verify that this damage mechanism is of thermal origin and is associated with onephoton absorption of infrared excitation light by melanin granules present in the epidermal-dermal junction. The <b>thermal</b> mechanical <b>damage</b> threshold for selected Caucasian skin specimens from a skin bank as a function of laser pulse energy and repetition rate has been determined. The experimentally established <b>thermal</b> mechanical <b>damage</b> threshold is consistent with a simple heat diffusion model for skin under femtosecond pulse laser illumination. Minimizing <b>thermal</b> mechanical <b>damage</b> is vital for the potential use of two-photon imaging in noninvasive optical biopsy of human skin in vivo. We describe a technique to mitigate specimen <b>thermal</b> mechanical <b>damage</b> based on the use of a laser pulse picker that reduces the laser repetition rate by selecting a fraction of pulses from a laser pulse train. Since the laser pulse picker decreases laser average power while maintaining laser pulse peak power, <b>thermal</b> mechanical <b>damage</b> can be minimized while two-photon fluorescence excitation efficiency is maximized. © 2004 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers...|$|R

25|$|The eye focuses {{visible and}} {{near-infrared}} light onto the retina. A laser beam can be focused to an intensity on the retina {{which may be}} up to 200,000 times higher than {{at the point where}} the laser beam enters the eye. Most of the light is absorbed by melanin pigments in the pigment epithelium just behind the photoreceptors, and causes burns in the retina. Ultraviolet light with wavelengths shorter than 400nm tends to be absorbed by lens and 300nm in the cornea, where it can produce injuries at relatively low powers due to photochemical damage. Infrared light mainly causes <b>thermal</b> <b>damage</b> to the retina at near-infrared wavelengths and to more frontal parts of the eye at longer wavelengths. The table below summarizes the various medical conditions caused by lasers at different wavelengths, not including injuries due to pulsed lasers.|$|E
25|$|Lasers {{can cause}} damage in {{biological}} tissues, {{both to the}} eye and to the skin, due to several mechanisms. <b>Thermal</b> <b>damage,</b> or burn, occurs when tissues are heated {{to the point where}} denaturation of proteins occurs. Another mechanism is photochemical damage, where light triggers chemical reactions in tissue. Photochemical damage occurs mostly with short-wavelength (blue and ultra-violet) light and can be accumulated over the course of hours. Laser pulses shorter than about 1 μs can cause a rapid rise in temperature, resulting in explosive boiling of water. The shock wave from the explosion can subsequently cause damage relatively far away from the point of impact. Ultrashort pulses can also exhibit self-focusing in the transparent parts of the eye, leading to an increase of the damage potential compared to longer pulses with the same energy. Photoionization proved to be the main mechanism of radiation damage at the use of titanium-sapphire laser.|$|E

40|$|Perforatability and <b>thermal</b> <b>damages</b> {{of dental}} hard tissues with {{two kinds of}} YAG laser are {{investigated}} {{for the purpose of}} making the cavity and forming the abutment tooth. The perforatability of dentin with laser beam depends on the absorptivity for laser beam, the laser power, the pulse duration and the number of laser pulses. Approximately 65 % of Er:YAG laser beam is absorbed at irradiated surface of dentin, but the absorptivity for Nd:YAG laser beam is only 17 %. High perforatability is accomplished using Er:YAG laser because of its higher absorptivity. There is a linear relation between the perforated depth and the number of pulses. Higher laser power and larger pulse duration improve the perforatability, in the same time, induce <b>thermal</b> <b>damages</b> on dental hard tissue such as thermal cracks and burning of dentin.

In this paper, the cavity preparation is performed for human dentin tissue with Nd:YAG laser and Er:YAG laser to investigate the effects of water. The <b>thermal</b> <b>damages</b> caused on dentin tissue are microscopically observed and the perforatability is evaluated from the dimensions of cavity perforated. The <b>thermal</b> <b>damages</b> caused on dentin tissue is reduced by water, especially very fine cavity can be achieved in the cavity preparation with Er:YAG laser, while the perforatability with laser beam is decreased by water. The audible sound pressure level is also measured to investigate the feasibility of sound monitoring as the removal-monitoring method. It is found that the sound pressure level increases linearly with the extent of removed dental tissue...|$|R
25|$|There {{are eight}} clades of Symbiodinium phylotypes. Most {{research}} has been completed on the Symbiodinium clades A–D. Each {{one of the eight}} contributes their own benefits as well as less compatible attributes to the survival of their coral hosts. Each photosynthetic organism has a specific level of sensitivity to photodamage of compounds needed for survival, such as proteins. Rates of regeneration and replication determine the organism's ability to survive. Phylotype A is found more in the shallow regions of marine waters. It is able to produce mycosporine-like amino acids that are UV resistant, using a derivative of glycerin to absorb the UV radiation and allowing them to become more receptive to warmer water temperatures. In the event of UV or <b>thermal</b> <b>damage,</b> if and when repair occurs, it will increase the likelihood of survival of the host and symbiont. This leads to the idea that, evolutionarily, clade A is more UV resistant and thermally resistant than the other clades.|$|E

The battery had signs of short circuiting and thermal runaway. Despite this, on January 24 the NTSB announced that it had not yet pinpointed the cause of the Boston fire; the FAA would not allow U.S.-based Dreamliners to fly again until the problem was found and corrected. In a press briefing that day, NTSB Chairwoman Deborah Hersman said that the NTSB had found evidence of failure of multiple safety systems designed to prevent these battery problems, and stated that fire must never happen on an aircraft. The Japan Transport Safety Board (JTSB) has said on January 23 that the battery in ANA jets in Japan reached a maximum voltage of 31 V (lower than the 32 V limit like the Boston JAL 787), but had a sudden unexplained voltage drop to near zero. All cells had signs of <b>thermal</b> <b>damage</b> before thermal runaway. ANA and JAL had replaced several 787 batteries before the mishaps.

40|$|Objective: {{to examine}} {{changes in the}} {{autonomic}} nervous system (ANS) function in patients with carbon monoxide poisoning {{in relation to the}} condition severity. Subjects and methods. The ANS was studied in 114 patients aged 15 to 82 years with carbon monohydrate poisoning who were treated at the N. V. Sklifosovsky Research Institute of Emergency Care, Moscow, in 2004 — 2008. Cardiointervalographic readings were analyzed in relation to the condition severity, the presence of <b>thermal</b> <b>damages</b> to the skin and upper airway, and that of blood alcohol. Results. Within the first hours after poisoning, the function of the ANS was found to be impaired, which was associated with the development of hypersympathicotonia caused by the increased activity of its sympathetic part and the decreased tone of the parasympathetic one. The magnitude of hypersympathicotonia depends on the severity of poisoning, on the presence of <b>thermal</b> <b>damages</b> to the upper respiratory tract and that of blood alcohol. The preponderance of the tone of the ANS parasympathetic part suggests the disturbance of adaptive and compensatory mechanisms and the likely poor prognosis of the poisoning. Conclusion.

2500|$|Different {{waveforms}} can be {{used for}} different electrosurgical procedures. [...] For cutting, a continuous single frequency sine wave is often employed. [...] Rapid tissue heating leads to explosive vaporization of interstitial fluid. If the voltage is sufficiently high (> 400 V peak-to-peak) the vapor sheath is ionized, forming conductive plasma. Electric current continues to flow from the metal electrode through the ionized gas into the tissue. Rapid overheating of tissue results in its vaporization, fragmentation and ejection of fragments, allowing for tissue cutting. In applications of a continuous wave the heat diffusion typically leads to formation of a significant <b>thermal</b> <b>damage</b> zone {{at the edges of the}} lesion.

Thus, there are several methods available for testing <b>thermal</b> shock <b>damage</b> resistance of refractories. Among them, a very common method is the quench test, which consists of quenching a hot refractory bar into water. After that a retained mechanical property is determined.

It manifests a power threshold {{in the range of}} MW for the majority of dielectric materials, which depends on the duration and on the wavelength of the laser pulse. Optical breakdown is related to the dielectric breakdown phenomenon which was studied and modeled successfully {{towards the end of the}} 1950s. One describes the effect as a strong local ionization of the medium, where the plasma reaches densities beyond the critical value (between 1020 and 1022 electrons/cm³). Once the plasma critical density is achieved, energy is very efficiently absorbed from the light pulse, and the local plasma temperature increases dramatically. An explosive Coulombian expansion follows, and forms a very powerful and damaging shockwave through the material that develops on ns timescale. In liquids one talks about cavitation bubbles. If the rate of plasma formation is relatively slow, in the nanosecond time regime (for nanosecond excitation laser pulses), energy is transferred from the plasma to the lattice, and <b>thermal</b> <b>damages</b> can occur. In the femtosecond time regime (for femtosecond excitation laser pulses) the plasma expansion happens on a timescale smaller than the rate of energy transfer to the lattice, and <b>thermal</b> <b>damages</b> are reduced or eliminated.
