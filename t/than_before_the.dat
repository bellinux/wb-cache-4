5|$|Due to First World War losses, Cunard began a post-war {{rebuilding}} programme including eleven intermediate liners. It {{acquired the}} former Hapag Imperator (renamed the Berengaria) {{to replace the}} lost Lusitania as the running mate for Mauretania and Aquitania, and Southampton replaced Liverpool as the British destination for the three-ship express service. By 1926 Cunard's fleet was larger <b>than</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> war, and White Star was in decline, having been sold by IMM.|$|E
5|$|The second {{conviction}} left Knight {{even worse}} off <b>than</b> <b>before.</b> <b>The</b> company {{he was working}} for before his second trial refused to re-employ him. Jobless, he engaged himself in community work in his church, Covenant Community Methodist Church, and often visited a pub in Boat Quay of which his wife was a partner. He faded quietly from public life.|$|E
5|$|West Alsek was {{selected}} for a test program {{by the addition of}} coal pulverizers—units that crushed coal and mixed it with air for injection into the boilers. She became the first steamship to cross the Atlantic ocean depending solely on pulverized coal. Test results showed that she sailed faster and used less coal <b>than</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> conversion. West Alsek was later abandoned by the USSB and scrapped in 1933.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{judicial}} system and legal codes of the Weimar Republic remained in use {{during and after the}} Nazi era to deal with non-political crimes. The courts issued and carried out far more death sentences <b>than</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Nazis took power. People who were convicted of three or more offences—even petty ones—could be deemed habitual offenders and jailed indefinitely. People such as prostitutes and pickpockets were judged to be inherently criminal and a threat to the racial community. Thousands were arrested and confined indefinitely without trial.|$|E
5|$|Not {{far from}} Beaverkill Road is {{the east end}} of the {{spillway}} road, which was closed as a security precaution following the September11, 2001 attacks, but reopened after construction of a new alignment of NY28A was completed in 2012. Past the spillway road, NY28A continues east, briefly crossing the Blue Line and leaving Catskill Park as it passes another spillway. At the spillway's southeastern tip is a junction with Stone Church Road, where the route turns back to the north and reenters the park. Now in the town of Hurley, NY28A continues to follow the irregular reservoir shoreline to the northeast, but on a slightly further inland alignment <b>than</b> <b>before.</b> <b>The</b> land here remains wooded, but more frequently broken by houses on the southern side.|$|E
5|$|On September17, a {{hurricane}} {{was observed in}} the mid-Atlantic by the bark Phantom. Later that day, the Phantom sank, though all of the crew survived. They described {{the system as a}} 'perfect hurricane' with a lull around midnight on September17 before the wind changed direction and blew with even greater force <b>than</b> <b>before.</b> <b>The</b> hurricane continued travelling on a northwest track and between September22 and the night of September23 it was encountered by the Hudson, the City of Washington and the bark Lanark. The system weakened to a tropical storm early on September24 and dissipated later that day about 610mi (980km) east of Cape Race, Newfoundland. Until reanalysis, this storm was considered two separate systems, including in the 1995 study by Partagas and Diaz. However, they stated that further information could indicate a single storm.|$|E

5|$|P. lanceolata shrubs {{destroyed}} by bushfire regenerate through seedlings surviving through seedbank in the soil. The Ku-ring-gai Chase {{study found that}} seedlings germinated within two years of a 1994 bushfire, although some appeared up to six years afterwards, while germination {{was not related to}} any particular season. Plants take six years to reach maturity. Thus, more frequent bushfires prevent recruitment and hence endanger populations. However, plants in Lane Cove National Park were recorded maturing three years after an especially intense bushfire. What triggers germination is unknown, and seedlings have also arisen from areas disturbed by sand mining, sometimes growing in higher concentrations <b>than</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> disturbance. The natural lifespan of a plant appears to range from 25 to 60 years.|$|E
5|$|Red wares were {{imported}} from southeastern Utah until , when the Chacoans switched to orange ware products originating from northeastern Arizona, near Kayenta. After 1000, almost no pottery {{was fired in}} the canyon, but was instead produced in outlying communities with access to {{a steady supply of}} firewood for their kilns. During the period from 1030 to 1100, significantly more pottery was imported to the canyon <b>than</b> <b>before.</b> <b>The</b> extensive Puebloan trade network that dispersed stoneware products throughout the region suggests that, although evidence of large-scale production is lacking, proficient local artisans supplied distant communities as well as their own.|$|E
5|$|When County cricket resumed in England in 1946, Yorkshire won the County Championship. Yardley scored 788 runs at {{an average}} of 23.17, with just one century, for Yorkshire against Nottinghamshire. With the ball, he was used less {{frequently}} <b>than</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> war and took only nine wickets. He was not selected for any Test matches, but appeared for England in a Test trial and scored 39 and 11. He also played twice for the MCC and represented the Gentlemen against the Players, making 29 and a duck in a heavy defeat for the amateurs. Critics regarded his season as unsuccessful, but he was chosen as vice-captain to Hammond on the tour to Australia that winter, continuing his pre-war role.|$|E

5|$|A 2016 study led by Harvard University health {{economics}} professor Benjamin Sommers found that residents of Kentucky and Arkansas, which both accepted the Medicaid expansion, {{were more likely}} to receive health care services and less likely to incur emergency room costs or have trouble paying their medical bills <b>than</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> expansion. Residents of Texas, which did not accept the Medicaid expansion, did not see a similar improvement during the same period. Kentucky opted for increased managed care, while Arkansas subsidized private insurance. The new Arkansas and Kentucky governors have proposed reducing or modifying their programs. Between 2013 and 2015, the uninsured rate dropped from 42% to 14% in Arkansas and from 40% to 9% in Kentucky, compared with 39% to 32% in Texas. Specific improvements included additional primary and preventive care, fewer emergency departments visits, reported higher quality care, improved health, improved drug affordability, reduced out-of-pocket spending and increased outpatient visits, increased diabetes screening, glucose testing among diabetes patients and regular care for chronic conditions.|$|E
5|$|From 1915 onwards the MTT had {{to compete}} against {{unregulated}} private buses, often preceding the trams on the same route to steal fares, which the MTT countered by opening their own motor bus routes from 1925. The South Australian government began regulating buses within the state in 1927, although some private operators used {{a provision in the}} Australian constitution to their advantage. By notionally marking each ticket as a fare from the pickup point to Murrayville, Victoria (but allowing passengers to board or alight sooner) companies avoided having to abide by the regulation for some time. Up until the end of World War I, most Adelaideans were dependent on public transport for daily journeys. The introduction of private automobiles decreased passenger numbers until petrol rationing during World War II led to a resurgence in patronage; patronage remained higher <b>than</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> war, until rationing was discontinued in 1951.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{dramatic}} loss of any group of animals has been to wading birds. Their numbers were estimated by eyewitness accounts to be approximately 2.5million in the late 19th century. However, snowy egrets (Egretta thula), roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja), and reddish egrets (Egretta rufescens) were hunted {{to the brink of}} extinction for the colorful feathers used in women's hats. After about 1920 when the fashion passed, their numbers returned in the 1930s, but over the next 50years actions by the C further disturbed populations. When the canals were constructed, natural water flow was restricted from the mangrove forests near the coast of Florida Bay. From one wet season to the next, fish were unable to reach traditional locations to repopulate when water was withheld by the C Birds were forced to fly farther from their nests to forage for food. By the 1970s, bird numbers had decreased 90%. Many of the birds moved to smaller colonies in the WCAs to be closer to a food source, making them more difficult to count. Yet they remain significantly fewer in number <b>than</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> canals were constructed.|$|E

5|$|The {{population}} was highly {{supportive of the}} war efforts. The political left supported the war (unlike World War I, which Socialists opposed.) The churches showed much less pacifism than in 1914. The Church of God, based in Anderson, had a strong pacifist element, reaching a high point in the late 1930s. The Church regarded World War II as a just war because America was attacked. Anti-Communist sentiment has since kept strong pacifism from developing in the Church of God. Likewise the Quakers, with a strong base near Richmond, generally regarded World War II as a just war and about 90% served, although there were some conscientious objectors. The Mennonites and Brethren continued their pacifism, but {{the federal government was}} much less hostile <b>than</b> <b>before.</b> <b>The</b> churches helped their young men to both become conscientious objectors and to provide valuable service to the nation. Goshen College set up a training program for unpaid Civilian Public Service jobs. Although the young women pacifists were not liable to the draft, they volunteered for unpaid Civilian Public Service jobs to demonstrate their patriotism; many worked in mental hospitals.|$|E

25|$|The Bush Doctrine was {{polarizing}} both {{domestically and}} internationally.

25|$|The Ashkenazic melodies {{from central}} and western European Jewry are used far less today <b>than</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Holocaust, but still survive in some communities, {{especially}} in Great Britain.
