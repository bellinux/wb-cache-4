25|$|Piaget {{argued that}} {{children}} and adults used speech for different purposes. In order to confirm his argument, he experimented analyzing a child’s interpretation of a story. In the experiment, the child listened to a story and then told a friend that same story in his/her/their own words. The purpose of <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> how children verbalize and understand each other without adult intervention. Piaget wanted to examine the limits of naturalistic observation, {{in order to understand}} a child’s reasoning. He realized the difficulty of studying children's thoughts, as {{it is hard to know}} if a child is pretending to believe their thoughts or not. Piaget was the pioneer researcher to examine children’s conversations in a social context – starting from examining their speech and actions – where children were comfortable and spontaneous (Kose, 1987).|$|E

50|$|The aim in <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> ASD children’s’ {{reactions}} to various mechanical toys including remote-controlled robots and mechanized animal toys {{to determine which}} features lead to increased social interaction between the mechanical toy and the child and ASD children’s interaction with a typically developing (TD) peer {{in the context of}} the different mechanical toys. The Focus Foundation sought to extend the results from a single child interacting with these mechanical toys to interactions between two children while engaging with the toys. Shared play was observed in the context of a variety of different robots and/or mechanized animals to see what increased social engagement behaviors.|$|E

50|$|The SilEye-Alteino and Anomalous Long Term Effects in Astronauts' Central Nervous System (ALTEA) {{projects}} {{have investigated the}} phenomenon aboard the International Space Station, using helmets similar in nature {{to those in the}} ALFMED experiment. The SilEye project has also examined the phenomenon on Mir. The purpose of <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> the particle tracks entering the eyes of the astronauts when the astronaut said they observed a LF. In examining the particles, the researchers hoped to gain a deeper understanding of what particles might be causing the LF. Astronauts wore the SilEye detector over numerous sessions while on Mir. During those sessions, when they detected a LF, they pressed a button on a joystick. After each session, they recorded down their comments about the experience. Particle tracks that hit the eye during the time when the astronauts indicated that they detected a LF would have had to pass through silicon layers, which were built to detect protons and nuclei and distinguish between them.|$|E
