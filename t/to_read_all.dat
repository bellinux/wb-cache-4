5|$|Because he {{was delayed}} {{in getting the}} website online, Munroe {{had a lot of}} time {{thinking}} about the design of the blog. He eventually chose to display his entries as individual pages rather than using an infinite scrolling page, as he considers the latter more difficult to digest. Munroe usually chooses questions he already knows something interesting about, or after reading a scientific paper, he keeps an eye out for questions in which he can bring it up. Munroe has said that the volume of questions has been high enough that it is impossible <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>all</b> of them. Answering a question and writing a post takes him about a day of solid work.|$|E
25|$|Some {{also have}} the custom <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>all</b> three paragraphs, along with {{a whole list of}} {{sections}} from Psalms, Tachanun, and other prayers. Altogether this is known as the K'riat Shema she-al ha-mitah. According to Arizal, reading this prayer with great concentration is also effective in cleansing one from sin. This is discussed in the Tanya.|$|E

Most cryptographic algorithms and protocols make certain assumptions (random key or nonce choices, for example), and when those assumptions are violated, all security is lost.|$|R

25|$|Later, {{he notes}} that Ran and Rivash were the source of Rema’s claim that women could not be called up <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>all</b> the {{portions}} of the Torah. Ran’s comment is ambiguous (so that he might agree that they could take any three aliyyot), but Rivash assumes that Ran agreed with him that women could only take the seventh or, perhaps, the reading added on for the maftir. Further, when Hagahot Maimoniyot limits slaves to the seventh portion, the comment closes by citing his teacher, the more famous R. Meir of Rothenburg.|$|E
25|$|Two {{collections}} of academic essays that analyse the show have been published: Gilmore Girls and the Politics of Identity (2008) and Screwball Television: Critical Perspectives on Gilmore Girls (2010). In 2002, four young adult novels were published that adapted scripts {{from the first}} and second seasons into novel form, told from Rory's first-person point of view. There have also been two unofficial guides to the series Coffee At Luke's: An Unauthorized Gilmore Girls Gab Fest (2007) and The Gilmore Girls Companion (2010). The show has also produced a book club, in which followers aim <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>all</b> 339 books referenced on the show, and inspired a cook book called Eat Like a Gilmore.|$|E

25|$|Witnesses {{are urged}} to prepare for {{congregation}} meetings by studying the assigned Watch Tower literature, and are expected <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>all</b> magazines and books published by the Society. One analysis noted that each year Witnesses are expected to read more than 3,000 pages of the Society's publications, according to its suggested program for personal study. Much of the literature is illustrated extensively, with sociologist Andrew Holden observing utopian, post-Armageddon images of happy Witnesses in bright sunshine and pristine environments, often playing with formerly wild animals such as lions and tigers, in contrast to dark-colored images of unfavorable activities such as murders, burglaries and promiscuity that highlight the moral dangers outside the organization.|$|E
500|$|While a Queen's Scholar at Westminster School, Hakluyt {{visited his}} guardian, whose conversation, {{illustrated}} by [...] "certain bookes of cosmographie, an universall mappe, and the Bible", made Hakluyt resolve to [...] "prosecute that knowledge, {{and kind of}} literature". Entering Christ Church, Oxford, in 1570 with financial support from the Skinners' Company, [...] "his exercises of duty first performed", he set out <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>all</b> the printed or written voyages and discoveries that he could find. He took his Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) on 19 February 1574, and shortly after taking his Master of Arts (M.A.) on 27 June 1577, began giving public lectures in geography. He {{was the first to}} show [...] "both the old imperfectly composed and the new lately reformed mappes, globes, spheares, and other instruments of this art". Hakluyt held on to his studentship at Christ Church between 1577 and 1586, although after 1583 he was no longer resident in Oxford.|$|E
500|$|The Titan's Curse {{received}} relatively positive reviews, {{which often}} lauded the humor and {{action in the}} story. Children's Literature, which commended the book's fast pace and humor, wrote, [...] "Readers will relate to good natured Percy, the protagonist." [...] Kirkus Reviews awarded it a starred review with, [...] "This third in the Olympians series makes the Greek myths come alive in a way no dreary classroom unit can... will have readers wondering how literature can be this fun. This can stand alone, though newcomers to the series will race {{back to the first}} two volumes and eagerly await a fourth installment." [...] School Library Journal praised the [...] "adventurous" [...] plot as well as the book's appeal: [...] "Teachers will cheer for Percy Jackson and the Olympians as they inspire students to embrace Greek mythology and score the ultimate Herculean challenge: getting kids <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> <b>All</b> in all, a winner of Olympic proportions and a surefire read-aloud." [...] Booklist's starred review approved of the novel's humor action, and plotting: [...] "The Percy Jackson & the Olympians series is built around a terrific idea—that the half-mortal offspring of Greek gods live among us, playing out struggles of mythic scale—and Riordan takes it from strength to strength with this exciting installment, adding even more depth to the characters and story arc while retaining its predecessors' nonstop laughs and action." [...] Kidsreads raved, [...] "Rick Riordan's Olympian adventures have gained great popularity thanks to their combination of humor, adventure and a winning hero ... Readers who are familiar with ancient mythology will enjoy Riordan's tongue-in-cheek approach; those who aren't just might be tempted to go to the original sources to learn more." ...|$|E

500|$|Three {{reviewers for}} Computer Gaming World had {{conflicting}} reactions. Ken St. Andre—designer of the Tunnels & Trolls RPG—approved {{of the game}} despite his dislike of the D system, praising the art, the mixture of combat and puzzles, and surprises. He concluded, [...] "take it from a 'rival' designer, Pool of Radiance has my recommendation for every computer fantasy role-playing gamer". Tracie Forman Hicks, however, stated that over-faithful use of the D system left it behind others like Ultima and Wizardry. She also disliked the game's puzzles and lengthy combat sequences. Scorpia also disliked the amount of fighting in a game she otherwise described as a [...] "well-designed slicer/dicer", concluding that [...] "patience (possibly of Job) [...] required {{to get through this}} one". Shay Addams from Compute! stated that experienced role-playing gamers [...] "won't find anything new here", but recommended it to those who [...] "love dungeons, dragons, and drama". In their March 1989 [...] "The Role of Computers" [...] column in Dragon magazine #143, Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser (often called [...] "The Lessers") gave Pool of Radiance a three-page review. The reviewers praised Pool of Radiance as [...] "the first offering that truly follows AD game rules", calling it a [...] "great fantasy role-playing game" [...] that [...] "falls into the must-buy category for avid AD game players". The reviewers advised readers to [...] "rush out to your local dealer and buy Pool Of Radiance". They considered it SSI's flagship product, speculating that it would [...] "undoubtedly bring thousands of computer enthusiasts into the adventure-filled worlds of TSR". The Dragon reviewers criticized the [...] "notoriously slow" [...] technology of the C64/128 system but added that the C64/128 version would become nearly unplayable without a software-based fastloader utility which Strategic Simulations integrated into the game. Conversely, the reviewers felt that the MS-DOS version was extremely fast, so much so that they had to slow the game operation down in order <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>all</b> the on-screen messages. They found that the MS-DOS version played at twice the speed of the C64/128 version when using the Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA) graphics mode.|$|E

2500|$|In a 1982 {{interview}} with The New Music Butler claimed, [...] "If {{the moral majority}} don't understand it they'll try to put it down, or get other people <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>all</b> sorts of things into it... The moral majority sort of people {{picked up on the}} Satanic part of it. I mean, most of it was about stopping wars and that side of it, and some science fiction stuff. There wasn't that much Satanic stuff, and what there was it wasn't exactly for the devil or anything like that; it was just around at the time and we just brought it to people's attention." [...] In the documentary The Black Sabbath Story, Vol. 1, Butler expresses his frustration at how fans misinterpreted the band's lyrics, stating that [...] "for instance, on 'Hand of Doom' they'll pick up one sentence out of that and blow it up into this big thing, like as if we're telling everyone to go and shoot smack. The whole song is against drugs." ...|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} fools enter the synagogue, and seeing people occupying {{themselves}} with the law, ask how a person learns the law. They answer that first a person reads from children’s materials, then from the Torah, then from the Prophets ( [...] , Nevi'im), and then from the Writings ( [...] , Ketuvim). Then the person learns the Talmud, then the law ( [...] , halachah), and then the Midrash ( [...] , haggadot). Hearing this, fools ask themselves when they can learn all that, and turn to leave. Rabbi Jannai compared this to a loaf suspended in the air. The fool exclaims {{that no one can}} bring it down. But the wise person says that someone put it there and takes a ladder or stick and brings it down. So fools complain that they are unable <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>all</b> the law. But wise people learn a chapter every day until they read all the law. God said in [...] "it is not too hard for you," [...] but if you find it too hard, it is your own fault, because you do not study it.|$|E
