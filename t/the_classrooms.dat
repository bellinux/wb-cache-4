The ACLU also won cases challenging schools in New Mexico which were taught by clergy and had crucifixes hanging in <b>the</b> <b>classrooms.</b> In the 1960s, the ACLU, in response to member insistence, turned its attention to in-class promotion of religion. In 1960, 42 percent of American schools included Bible reading. In 1962, the ACLU published a policy statement condemning in-school prayers, observation of religious holidays, and Bible reading. The Supreme Court concurred with the ACLU's position, when it prohibited New York's in-school prayers in the 1962 Engel v. Vitale decision. Religious factions across the country rebelled against the anti-prayer decisions, leading them to propose the School Prayer Constitutional Amendment, which declared in-school prayer legal. The ACLU participated in a lobbying effort against the amendment, and the 1966 congressional vote on the amendment failed to obtain the required two-thirds majority.|$|E

40|$|Although a {{great deal}} of {{research}} has been done on classroom language learning, relatively little research has been done on language learning outside <b>the</b> <b>classroom.</b> <b>The</b> aim of this presentation, therefore, is both to reassert the fundamental relevance of the world of learning beyond <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> to <b>the</b> idea of autonomy and to address certain problems that arise in the conceptualisation of this world. The presentation will address three central questions: 1. How can we conceptualize learning beyond <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> in its own terms (without, for example, using <b>the</b> term <b>classroom)</b> ? 2. How can we conceptualize learning beyond <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> independently of particular settings and modes of practice? 3. How can we best describe the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> and <b>the</b> world beyond <b>the</b> <b>classroom?</b> I will argue that, in the 21 st century, second language learning increasingly tends to straddle the divide between institutionalised education and daily life, such that the development of autonomy is best understood as an outcome of relationships between learning in and out of <b>the</b> <b>classroom,</b> rather than engagement in one or the other. 12 page(s...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAlthough {{application}} {{of technology in}} <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> has been introduced {{for the last two}} decades, some teachers are still resistance to use technology in <b>the</b> <b>classroom.</b> This study is designed to investigate Malaysian teachers’ perceptions of using technology in <b>the</b> <b>classroom.</b> In this study perception is regarded as interpretation of events among Malaysian teachers due to past experiences, current understanding, present situation and information. Qualitative research is used as the mode of inquiry for this research study. The main mode of data collection is the questionnaire that elicits information on the respondents’ views of the use of technology on <b>the</b> <b>classroom.</b> Participants for this study were seven local English teachers in Malaysia. The findings indicate that although Malaysian English teachers were using technology and have positive perceptions towards using technology in <b>the</b> <b>classroom,</b> they feel it is crucial for them to undergo training in this aspect. They view time constraint and access to equipment as the main obstacles to implementing technology in <b>the</b> <b>classroom.</b> This research concludes that although Malaysian teachers are faced with some difficulties in implementing technology in <b>the</b> <b>classroom,</b> they see a value in technology and want to use technology in <b>the</b> <b>classroom...</b>|$|R
