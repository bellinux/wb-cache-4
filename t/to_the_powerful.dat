5|$|As was customary, {{the treaty}} {{would have to}} be {{approved}} by the nobles and knights of both lands. The meeting between the nobility of Pomerelia and Greater Poland took place between 13–15 September 1284 in the town of Nakło, where they confirmed the rights of Przemysł II over Gdańsk Pomerania. The unification of Pomerelia and Greater Poland was not the only decision made by Przemysł II and Mestwin II. The favors shown by the Duke of Pomerelia <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>powerful</b> witnesses of the agreement from Greater Poland showed that they were also keenly interested in the close integration of the two lands.|$|E

5|$|Initially conservative, {{working with}} Wilson (who was elected president) {{inspired}} Barkley {{to become more}} liberal. On April 24, 1912, he first spoke on the House floor, favoring the administration-backed Underwood–Simmons Tariff Act which lowered tariffs on foreign goods. He endorsed Wilson's New Freedom agenda, including the 1913 Federal Reserve Act and the 1914 Federal Trade Commission Act. Because of {{his support for the}} administration, he was assigned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>powerful</b> Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee and became the first freshman to preside over a session of the House. As a member of the Interstate Commerce Commission, he supported the Clayton Antitrust Act and sought to end child labor in interstate commerce through the Keating–Owen Act in 1916. He also supported measures to extend credit to and fund road improvements in rural areas.|$|E
5|$|Primitive {{fish have}} a four-chambered heart, but the {{chambers}} are arranged sequentially {{so that this}} primitive heart is quite unlike the four-chambered hearts of mammals and birds. The first chamber is the sinus venosus, which collects deoxygenated blood, from the body, through the hepatic and cardinal veins. From here, blood flows into the atrium and then <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>powerful</b> muscular ventricle where the main pumping action will take place. The fourth and final chamber is the conus arteriosus which contains several valves and sends blood to the ventral aorta. The ventral aorta delivers blood to the gills where it is oxygenated and flows, through the dorsal aorta, {{into the rest of}} the body. (In tetrapods, the ventral aorta has divided in two; one half forms the ascending aorta, while the other forms the pulmonary artery).|$|E
5|$|Sir Thomas Hungerford {{bought the}} {{property}} from the Bunghersh family in 1369 for £733. By 1385 the manor {{was known as}} Farley Hungerford, after its new owner. Sir Thomas Hungerford was a knight and courtier, who became rich as the Chief Steward <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>powerful</b> John of Gaunt and then the first recorded Speaker of the House of Commons. Thomas decided to make Farleigh Hungerford his principal home and, between 1377 and 1383, built a castle on the site; unfortunately he did not acquire the appropriate licence to crenellate from the king before commencing building, and Thomas had to acquire a royal pardon in 1383.|$|E

5|$|Tadeusz Rejtan {{was born}} on 20 August 1742 in Hruszówka (now, Hrushauka, Belarus) (date as given in the Polish Biographical Dictionary, some other sources give other dates). He {{was the son of}} a minor, but {{relatively}} wealthy noble, Dominik Rejtan, podkomorzy of Nowogródek (today Navahrudak, Belarus) and Teresa Wołodkowicz.

His grandfather, also named Michał, was the skarbnik (treasurer) of Mazyr. The family had been aligned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>powerful</b> Radziwiłł family, and Tadeusz would also pledge his allegiance to them.|$|E
5|$|The {{army was}} well {{organised}} {{and this was}} the reason for PulakeshinII's success beyond the Vindyas. It consisted of an infantry, a cavalry, an elephant corps and a powerful navy. The Chinese traveller Hiuen-Tsiang wrote that the Chalukyan army had hundreds of elephants which were intoxicated with liquor prior to battle. It was with their navy that they conquered Revatidvipa (Goa), and Puri on east coast of India.

Phips suspended the court proceedings, pardoned several people sentenced to death, and released more than 100 being held in jail before trial. He became enmeshed in related controversies that resulted in his recall to England to answer a variety of charges. Phips died in London at the age of 44 before the charges against him could be heard.|$|E

5|$|Soon after, Rebecca {{contacts}} the hacker, {{and says}} that she has convinced TriOptimum to authorize the station's destruction; she provides him with details {{on how to do}} this. After obtaining the necessary codes, the hacker initiates the station's self-destruct sequence and flees to the escape pod bay. There, the hacker defeats Diego a second time, then attempts to disembark. However, SHODAN prevents the pod from launching; it seeks to keep the player aboard the station, while the bridge—which contains SHODAN—is jettisoned to a safe distance. Rebecca tells the hacker that he can still escape if he reaches the bridge; SHODAN then intercepts and jams the transmission. After defeating Diego for the third time and killing him for good, the hacker makes it to the bridge as it is released from the main station, which soon detonates. He is then contacted by a technician who managed to circumvent SHODAN's jamming signal. The technician informs him that SHODAN can only be defeated in cyberspace, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>powerful</b> shields that protect its mainframe computers. Using a terminal near the mainframe, the hacker enters cyberspace and destroys SHODAN. After his rescue, the hacker is offered a job at TriOptimum, but he declines in favor of continuing his life as a hacker.|$|E
5|$|Richard I was crowned King in 1189 and {{announced}} {{his intention to}} join the Crusades; this inflamed anti-Jewish sentiment. Rumours began to spread that the king had ordered that the English Jews be attacked. In York, tensions broke out into violence the following year. Richard de Malbis, who owed money <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>powerful</b> Jewish merchant Aaron of Lincoln, exploited an accidental house fire to incite a local mob to attack the home and family of a recently deceased Jewish employee of Aaron in York. Josce of York, {{the leader of the}} Jewish community, led the local Jewish families into the royal castle, where they took refuge in the wooden keep. The mob surrounded the castle, and when the constable left the castle to discuss the situation, the Jews, fearing the entry of the mob or being handed over to the sheriff, refused to allow him back in. The constable appealed to the sheriff, who called out his own men and laid siege to the keep. The siege continued until 16 March when the Jews' position became untenable. Their religious leader, Rabbi Yomtob, proposed an act of collective suicide to avoid being killed by the mob, and the castle was set on fire to prevent their bodies being mutilated after their deaths. Several Jews perished in the flames but the majority took their own lives rather than give themselves up to the mob. A few Jews did surrender, promising to convert to Christianity, but they were killed by the angry crowd. Around 150 Jews died in total in the massacre. The keep was rebuilt, again in wood, on the motte, which was raised in height by 13 feet (4 metres) at a cost of £207.|$|E
