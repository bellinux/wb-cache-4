5|$|A {{flexible-fuel vehicle}} (FFV) or dual-fuel vehicle (colloquially called a flex-fuel vehicle) is an {{alternative}} fuel vehicle with an internal combustion engine designed to run {{on more than one}} fuel, usually gasoline blended with either ethanol or methanol fuel, and both fuels are stored in the same common tank. Modern flex-fuel engines are capable of burning any proportion of the resulting blend in the combustion chamber as fuel injection and spark timing are adjusted automatically according to the actual blend detected by a fuel composition sensor. Flex-fuel vehicles are distinguished from bi-fuel vehicles, where two fuels are stored in separate tanks and <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>runs</b> on one fuel at a time, for example, compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), or hydrogen.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, General Electric built one ES44AC, GECX 3000, as a {{test bed}} for their NextFuel natural gas power kit. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>runs</b> on {{liquefied}} natural gas from a fuel tender. The unit is currently part of BNSF's GE LNG test set, partnered with BNSF ES44AC no. 5815.|$|E
500|$|Bi-fuel {{vehicles}}. The term flexible-fuel vehicles {{is sometimes}} used to include other alternative fuel vehicles that can run with {{compressed natural gas}} (CNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG; also known as autogas), or hydrogen. However, all these vehicles actually are bi-fuel and not flexible-fuel vehicles, because they have engines that store the other fuel in a separate tank, and <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>runs</b> on one fuel at a time. Bi-fuel vehicles {{have the capability to}} switch back and forth from gasoline to the other fuel, manually or automatically. The most common available fuel in the market for bi-fuel cars is natural gas (CNG), and by 2008 there were 9,6 million natural gas vehicles, led by Pakistan (2.0 million), Argentina (1.7 million), and Brazil (1.6 million). [...] Natural gas vehicles are a popular choice as taxicabs in the main cities of Argentina and Brazil. Normally, standard gasoline vehicles are retrofitted in specialized shops, which involve installing the gas cylinder in the trunk and the CNG injection system and electronics.|$|E

2500|$|The 86's engine, {{known by}} the Toyota code 4U-GSE and Subaru code FA20, is a {{naturally}} aspirated four-cylinder engine that uses Subaru's horizontally opposed boxer engine design, {{with the addition of}} Toyota's D-4S injection system, which uses both direct and port fuel injection. Given its placement, the 86 can be considered having a front engine, rear wheel drive drivetrain layout. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>runs</b> on 98 RON (premium unleaded) fuel and features a 12.5:1 compression ratio and a bore and stroke of [...] that results in [...] at 7,000 rpm and [...] of torque at 6,000 rpm. As part of the 86's low-weight design, the car utilizes an aluminium hood, a solid roof, and a trunk as opposed to a hatchback. [...] The boxer engine sits as far back and as low as possible in the engine bay for a weight distribution of 53% in front and 47% in the rear. The low-sitting engine provides a lower center of gravity, allowing the engine to sit lower than the Nissan GTR and just 0.6 inches higher than the Lexus LFA.|$|E
50|$|The engine has {{timing belt}} change {{interval}} of 180,000 Km as IKCO has announced. IKCO states if <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>runs</b> only on CNG {{it will not}} need any special maintenance until 250,000 km(average) and if <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>runs</b> with both CNG and gasoline {{the number will increase}} to more than 250,000 km.|$|E
