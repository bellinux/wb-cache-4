5|$|Castro {{proclaimed the}} new {{administration}} a direct democracy, in which Cubans could assemble at demonstrations to express their democratic will. As a result, he rejected the need for elections, claiming that representative democratic systems served the interests of socio-economic elites. U.S. Secretary of State Christian Herter announced <b>that</b> <b>Cuba</b> was adopting the Soviet model of rule, with a one-party state, government control of trade unions, suppression of civil liberties, {{and the absence of}} freedom of speech and press.|$|E
5|$|In May 1970, {{the crews}} of two Cuban fishing boats were kidnapped by Florida-based {{dissident}} group Alpha 66, who demanded <b>that</b> <b>Cuba</b> release imprisoned militants. Under U.S. pressure, the hostages were released, and Castro welcomed them back as heroes. In April 1971, Castro was internationally condemned for ordering {{the arrest of}} dissident poet Heberto Padilla; Padilla was freed, but the government established the National Cultural Council to ensure that intellectuals and artists supported the administration.|$|E
5|$|In September 1973, he {{returned}} to Algiers to attend the Fourth Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). Various NAM members were critical of Castro's attendance, claiming <b>that</b> <b>Cuba</b> was aligned to the Warsaw Pact and therefore should not be at the conference. At the conference he publicly broke off relations with Israel, citing its government's {{close relationship with the}} U.S. and its treatment of Palestinians during the Israel–Palestine conflict. This earned Castro respect throughout the Arab world, in particular from the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who became his friend and ally. As the Yom Kippur War broke out in October 1973 between Israel and an Arab coalition led by Egypt and Syria, Cuba sent 4,000 troops to defend Syrian territory from Israeli incursions. Leaving Algiers, Castro visited Iraq and North Vietnam.|$|E

The proposal would also be supplemented by partial economic sanctions {{and the establishment of}} a special security committee. This was accepted by the U.S. who agreed to defend the new scheme. In his key speech to the organization, Dean Rusk stated <b>that</b> <b>Cuba's</b> alignment with the Sino-Soviet block was incompatible with the inter-American system, and such measures were imperative.|$|R

5|$|Major Francis L. Dade, {{military}} commandant at Key West, received intelligence <b>that</b> <b>Cuba</b> and Spain were arming the Indians; investigations did {{not confirm}} the rumor. Reports coming from Fort Brooke, near present-day Tampa, noted that Indians {{in the area}} were resisting orders {{from the federal government}} to emigrate to Mississippi, contradicting the assertions made by the federal authorities that the Indians had agreed to emigrate peacefully. Dade, two companies of soldiers, and all of the available arms were sent to Fort Brooke at Tampa Bay, the port designated for the commencement of the Indians' emigration. The Indians answered by concentrating all of their forces in the New River region. On December 28, 1835, Dade and 107soldiers were ambushed en route from Tampa Bay to Fort King, near present-day Ocala. Only three soldiers survived; the attackers lost only three men.|$|E
5|$|In 1977 the Ethio-Somali War {{broke out}} over the disputed Ogaden region as Somalia invaded Ethiopia; {{although}} a former ally of Somali President Siad Barre, Castro had warned him against such action, and Cuba sided with Mengistu Haile Mariam's Marxist government of Ethiopia. He sent troops {{under the command of}} General Arnaldo Ochoa to aid the overwhelmed Ethiopian army. After forcing back the Somalis, Mengistu then ordered the Ethiopians to suppress the Eritrean People's Liberation Front, a measure Castro refused to support. Castro extended support to Latin American revolutionary movements, namely the Sandinista National Liberation Front in its overthrow of the Nicaraguan rightist government of Anastasio Somoza Debayle in July 1979. Castro's critics accused the government of wasting Cuban lives in these military endeavors; the anti-Castro Center for a Free Cuba has claimed that an estimated 14,000 Cubans were killed in foreign Cuban military actions. When U.S. state critics claimed that Castro had no right to interfere in these nations, he countered <b>that</b> <b>Cuba</b> had been invited into them, pointing out the U.S.' own involvement in various foreign nations.|$|E

25|$|Nonetheless, {{during the}} 19th century, vocal nationalists like Jose Marti {{inspired}} Cubans to rebel against their colonizers. Many nationalists saw Spain as incapable of supporting a booming Cuban economy. Cuba {{made use of}} new industrial technologies, such as steam engines, well before their large-scale introduction in Spain. Nationalists thus concluded <b>that</b> <b>Cuba</b> was entering a new stage of modernity, while Spain was {{becoming more and more}} obsolete, and holding Cuba back from economic and political success.|$|E
25|$|On his {{way back}} to Japan, Perry {{anchored}} off of Keelung in Formosa, known today as Taiwan, for ten days. Perry and crewmembers landed on Formosa and investigated the potential of mining the coal deposits in that area. He emphasized in his reports that Formosa provided a convenient, mid-way trade location. Perry's reports noted that the island was very defensible and it could serve as a base for exploration in a similar way <b>that</b> <b>Cuba</b> had done for the Spanish in the Americas. Occupying Formosa could help the United States counter European monopolization of the major trade routes. The United States government failed to respond to Perry's proposal to claim sovereignty over Formosa.|$|E

25|$|Lambert's Internationalist Communist Party (PCI) in France and the Socialist Labour League (SLL) in Britain did {{not take}} part in the reunification congress, but discussions {{continued}} on the topic. The PCI and SLL maintained the ICFI under their own leadership, opposing key elements in the reunification documents, including the view that the July 26 Movement had created a workers' state in Cuba. They argued instead that Cuba's revolution did not bring power to the working class; the SLL believed <b>that</b> <b>Cuba</b> had remained a capitalist country. In their view, the International's support for the Cuban and Algerian leaderships reflected a lack of commitment to the building of revolutionary Marxist parties. While not rejecting reunification in itself, the continuing ICFI argued that a deeper political discussion was needed to ensure that Pablo's errors were not deepened.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{had long}} been {{interested}} in acquiring Cuba from the declining Spanish Empire. As with Texas, Oregon, and California, American policy makers were concerned <b>that</b> <b>Cuba</b> would fall into British hands, which, according to the thinking of the Monroe Doctrine, would constitute {{a threat to the}} interests of the United States. Prompted by John L. O'Sullivan, in 1848 President Polk offered to buy Cuba from Spain for $100million. Polk feared that filibustering would hurt his effort to buy the island, and so he informed the Spanish of an attempt by the Cuban filibuster Narciso López to seize Cuba by force and annex it to the United States, foiling the plot. Nevertheless, Spain declined to sell the island, which ended Polk's efforts to acquire Cuba. O'Sullivan, on the other hand eventually landed in legal trouble.|$|E
