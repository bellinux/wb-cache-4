5|$|Between {{the early}} 16th {{and the late}} 17th centuries, an {{original}} tradition of stone tented roof architecture developed in Russia. It was quite unique and different from the contemporary Renaissance architecture elsewhere in Europe, though some research terms the style 'Russian Gothic' and compares it with the European Gothic architecture of the earlier period. The Italians, with their advanced <b>technology,</b> <b>may</b> have influenced {{the invention of the}} stone tented roof (the wooden tents were known in Russia and Europe long before). According to one hypothesis, an Italian architect called Petrok Maly may have been an author of the Ascension Church in Kolomenskoye, one of the earliest and most prominent tented roof churches.|$|E

50|$|In {{the romantic}} or {{ecological}} critique of technology, technical progress boosting productivity often {{does not mean}} human progress at all.

5|$|Shells {{are used}} decoratively in many ways. They can be pressed into {{concrete}} or plaster to make decorative paths, steps or walls {{and can be}} used to embellish picture frames, mirrors or other craft items. They can be stacked up and glued together to make ornaments. They can be pierced and threaded onto necklaces or made into other forms of jewellery. Shells have had various uses in the past as body decorations, utensils, scrapers and cutting implements. Carefully cut and shaped shell tools dating back 32,000 years have been found in a cave in Indonesia. In this region, shell <b>technology</b> <b>may</b> have been developed in preference to the use of stone or bone implements, perhaps because of the scarcity of suitable rock materials.|$|E
5|$|The {{biological}} and geological future of Earth can be extrapolated {{based upon the}} estimated effects of several long-term influences. These include the chemistry at Earth's surface, the rate of cooling of the planet's interior, the gravitational interactions with other objects in the Solar System, and a steady increase in the Sun's luminosity. An uncertain factor in this extrapolation is the ongoing influence of technology introduced by humans, such as climate engineering, which could cause significant changes to the planet. The current Holocene extinction is being caused by technology and the effects may last {{for up to five}} million years. In turn, <b>technology</b> <b>may</b> result in the extinction of humanity, leaving the planet to gradually return to a slower evolutionary pace resulting solely from long-term natural processes.|$|E
25|$|Assistive {{technology}} in sports {{is an area}} of technology design that is growing. Assistive technology is the array of new devices created to enable sports enthusiasts who have disabilities to play.

25|$|In recent years, the {{literature}} on life cycle assessment of energy technology has begun to reflect the interactions between the current electrical grid and future energy technology. Some papers have focused on energy life cycle, while others have focused on carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases. The essential critique given by these sources is that when considering energy technology, the growing nature of the power grid {{must be taken into}} consideration. If this is not done, a given class of energy <b>technology</b> <b>may</b> emit more CO2 over its lifetime than it mitigates.|$|E
25|$|A more {{successful}} series of calculators using a reflective DSM-LCD {{was launched in}} 1972 by Sharp Inc with the Sharp EL-805, which was a slim pocket calculator. This, and another few similar models, used Sharp's Calculator On Substrate (COS) technology. An extension of one glass plate needed for the liquid crystal display {{was used as a}} substrate to mount the needed chips based on a new hybrid technology. The COS <b>technology</b> <b>may</b> have been too costly since it was only used in a few models before Sharp reverted to conventional circuit boards.|$|E
25|$|Although Napata {{remained}} Meroë's religious center, northern Kush eventually {{fell into}} disorder {{as it came}} {{under pressure from the}} Blemmyes, predatory nomads from east of the Nile.

Additionally, Meroë maintained contact with Arab and Indian traders along the Red Sea coast and incorporated Hellenistic and Indian cultural influences into its daily life.

25|$|However, read {{range is}} both a {{function}} of the reader and the tag itself. Improvements in <b>technology</b> <b>may</b> increase read ranges for tags. Tags may be read at longer ranges than they are designed for by increasing reader power. The limit on read distance then becomes the signal-to-noise ratio of the signal reflected from the tag back to the reader. Researchers at two security conferences have demonstrated that passive Ultra-HighFID tags normally read at ranges of up to 30 feet, can be read at ranges of 50 to 69 feet using suitable equipment.|$|E
25|$|Self-repairing – Although {{of limited}} extent {{compared}} to well vascularised tissue (e.g. muscle), the valve leaflets do retain some capacity for repair {{due to the}} presence of regenerative cells (e.g. fibroblasts) in the connective tissue from which the leaflets are composed. As the human heart beats approximately 3.4x109 times during a typical human lifespan this limited but nevertheless present repair capacity is critically important. No heart valve prostheses can currently self-repair but replacement tissues grown using stem cell <b>technology</b> <b>may</b> eventually offer such capabilities.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea is not}} new: TimeTrax Technologies Corporation, led by CEO Elliott Frutkin, {{developed}} an application to record songs to MP3 and tag them with the artist and title information directly from the XM network. In 2005, XM attempted to thwart this practice by discontinuing the required XM PCR radio. TimeTrax responded by quickly rolling out adaptive interfaces to allow almost any XM subscriber to use their tuner to build music libraries directly from XM broadcasts. There is speculation that these fumbles by XM and its attitude towards the Time Trax <b>technology</b> <b>may</b> have been the warning shot of major troubles between the RIAA and XM.|$|E
