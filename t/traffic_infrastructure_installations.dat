In the first part are generally funds and state funds. In the second part I'm focusing my work directly on The State fund of <b>traffic</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> I explain a meaning of word "fund" {{at the beginning of}} my diploma work and then a system of funds (I try to show the grade of state funds between other funds). Next I deal with state funds' problems. There I generally describe state funds and try to show constituents, which have all state funds. After that follows a recitation of state funds and a part about each of them (except of The State fund of <b>traffic</b> <b>infrastructure).</b> I describe main impositions, an organization, a budget, receipts and expenditures of state funds. Then I attend to The State fund of <b>traffic</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> At the beginning of this part I describe a common interpretation about it, main impositions, an organizational structure (names of corporate members in each authority of fund) and a budget. The second part is divided into four sections: 1) Common interpretation about The State fund of <b>traffic</b> <b>infrastructure</b> (main impositions, an organization, a budget). 2) After that follows part [...] ...|$|R

The BFS human behaviour {{model is}} presented for a traffic situation. The key elements (perception, cognition, reaction) {{of the human}} behaviour are identified. Also possible limitations and errors in all elements of human behaviour are presented. The model is presented as the butterfly on the flower under the shower of interventions. The flower is environment describing <b>traffic</b> <b>infrastructure</b> composed of the environment, technology and organization. The body of the butterfly is human cognition with personality and motivation. The left wing of the butterfly is the driver’s perception. The {{right wing of the}} butterfly is the driver’s reaction. The butterfly presents the driver, the flower presents the road – the <b>traffic</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and the shower presents the shower of humanization interventions into the <b>traffic</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and into the driver. The drops from the shower are related to identified limitations in the <b>traffic</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and to the driver.

In the paper, the evaluation of projects is {{made on the basis of}} comparing the costs on construction of the <b>traffic</b> <b>infrastructure</b> with benefits which the construction will bring, i. e. the macroeconomic aspects within the decision-making process regarding the investments need to be quantified on the basis of Cost – Benefit analysis...|$|R

To deal with traffic congestion, two {{approaches}} can be adopted: one is to expand {{the capacity of the}} current <b>traffic</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and the second is to employ methods for better usage of the existing infrastructure. The second approach is preferred since it does not include expensive and environment-impacting changes on the <b>traffic</b> <b>infrastructure.</b>|$|R

The paper describes specific measures, methods and practices that will improve the current unsatisfactory state of matters in this field. If accepted by the public sector, the results may lead to increasing the transparency of the public commissioning process in <b>traffic</b> <b>infrastructures,</b> to name more effective public spending of money from EU structural funds and to improving the longevity, sustainability and utilization of <b>traffic</b> <b>infrastructure...</b>|$|R

In Brno, this urban trend has been present since the late 1960 s up to the present day.

40|$|Nowadays, under {{conditions}} in which forest areas are being opened with increasing number of forest roads due to great need for forest resources, {{the need for a}} well-kept system of forest roads becomes a necessary prerequisite in the process of intensification of forest ecosystems management. Cadastre of primary forest <b>traffic</b> <b>infrastructure</b> on the territory of the Republic of Croatia has already been established, and now the need for secondary forest road cadastre arises. Development of secondary forest road cadastre methodology will make a great and important step in inventarisation of the entire secondary forest <b>traffic</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> Although this is a comprehensive and very demanding job, it will result in numerous benefits to forest profession. Once established, a comprehensive forest <b>traffic</b> <b>infrastructure</b> cadastre will be able to easily and relatively quickly supplement newly built forest communications. Based on numerous analyses of primary and secondary forest <b>traffic</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> forest experts can enhance the quality of forest communications spatial configuration and direct the process of further primary and secondary forest opening up with the final goal of establishing the optimal primary and secondary forest network from technical-technological, economic, environmental-ecological and sociological-aesthetic point of view...|$|R

40|$|The {{move towards}} {{automated}} driving is gaining ground. This paper reviews {{the development process}} of self-driving technology and discusses the safety and efficiency advantages of autonomous vehicles. The discussion shows that the existing traffic management system, including transport infrastructures and regulations, should be changed accordingly to maximize the advantages of autonomous driving. Thus, this paper subsequently gives an insight of the traffic management from three aspects: fully self-driving <b>traffic</b> <b>infrastructures,</b> mixed <b>traffic</b> <b>infrastructures</b> and regulations. First, it is summarized in detail what should be adjusted in intersections, parking lots, pedestrian crossings, ramps, signs and markings. With the transformation of <b>traffic</b> <b>infrastructures,</b> the advantages of driverless car will be more pronounced on account of increased capacity, reduced delay and land use. Also, this paper indicates that the implementations of strict product liability for self-driving car manufacturers and no-fault tort liability for users are applicable to automated vehicle accidents...|$|R

30|$|The actual {{total of}} other initial costs depends on, among other factors, the {{available}} infrastructure in the selected location.

Considering the level of infrastructure development in most of the rural areas of Nigeria in locations included in this study, other initial costs such as that for land, <b>infrastructure,</b> <b>installation,</b> and grid integration are assumed to be 40 % of the total initial cost (or about 67 % of the wind turbine and tower cost).|$|R
