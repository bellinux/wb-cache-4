50|$|The first {{widely used}} {{solid-state}} negative resistance device was the tunnel diode, invented in 1957 by Japanese physicist Leo Esaki. Because they have lower parasitic capacitance than vacuum tubes {{due to their}} small junction size, diodes can function at higher frequencies, and tunnel diode oscillators proved able to produce power at microwave frequencies, above the range of ordinary vacuum tube oscillators. Its invention set off a search for other negative resistance semiconductor devices for use as microwave oscillators, resulting in {{the discovery of the}} IMPATT diode, Gunn diode, <b>TRAPATT</b> <b>diode,</b> and others. In 1969 Kurokawa derived conditions for stability in negative resistance circuits. Currently negative differential resistance diode oscillators are the most widely used sources of microwave energy, and many new negative resistance devices have been discovered in recent decades.|$|E
40|$|For {{over thirty}} years, Stan Amos has {{provided}} students and practitioners with a text they {{could rely on}} to keep them {{at the forefront of}} transistor circuit design. This seminal work has now been presented in a clear new format and completely updated to include the latest equipment such as laser <b>diodes,</b> <b>Trapatt</b> <b>diodes,</b> optocouplers and GaAs transistors, and the most recent line output stages and switch-mode power supplies. Although integrated circuits have widespread application, the role of discrete transistors is undiminished, both as important building blocks which students must understand a...|$|R
2500|$|These two {{requirements}} {{imply that}} a device used for amplification need a physical structure {{different from that}} of a typical avalanche transistor. The Controlled Avalanche Transit-time Triode (CATT), designed for microwave amplification, has a quite large lightly-doped region between the base and the collector regions, giving the device a collector-emitter breakdown voltage [...] fairly high compared to bipolar transistors of the same geometry. The current amplification mechanism is the same of the avalanche transistor, i.e. carrier generation by impact ionization, {{but there is also a}} transit-time effect as in IMPATT and [...] <b>TRAPATT</b> <b>diodes,</b> where a high-field region travels along the avalanching junction, precisely in along the intrinsic region. The device structure and choice of bias point imply that ...|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / November 14 - 16, 1978 / Hyatt House Hotel, Los Angeles, CaliforniaThis paper {{summarizes}} {{results that}} have been achieved with various types of microwave solid state power amplifying devices and presents some projections of advances that can be expected within approximately a five year period. The frequency band surveyed extends from 1 to 100 GHz. The emphasis is on CW or high duty cycle pulse applications, where long life is of great importance, such as in a satellite communication system. The types of devices considered include the gallium arsenide field-effect transistor (GaAs FET), IMPATT diodes, bipolar transistors, Gunn <b>diodes,</b> <b>TRAPATT</b> <b>diodes</b> and electron bombarded semiconductor (EBS) devices. An overview of the technology of microwave power combiners is also included...|$|R
