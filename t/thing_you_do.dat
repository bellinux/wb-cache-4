5|$|Tyler began {{a career}} in {{modeling}} {{at the age of}} 14, but, after less than a year, she decided to focus on acting. After her film debut Silent Fall (1994), she appeared in supporting roles in Empire Records (1995), Heavy (1996) and That <b>Thing</b> <b>You</b> <b>Do!</b> (1996). Tyler later achieved critical recognition in the leading role in Bernardo Bertolucci's Stealing Beauty (1996), playing a teenage girl visiting her deceased mother's artist friends in Italy. She followed this by appearing in supporting roles including Inventing the Abbotts (1997) and Robert Altman's black comedy Cookie's Fortune (1999). She also appeared in Armageddon (1998), where she played the daughter of Bruce Willis's character and love interest of Ben Affleck's character.|$|E
5|$|Grissom {{has been}} noted and remembered in many film and {{television}} productions. Before he became widely known as an astronaut, the film Air Cadet (1951) starring Richard Long and Rock Hudson briefly featured Grissom early in the movie as a U.S. Air Force candidate for flight school at Randolph Field, San Antonio, Texas. Grissom was depicted by Fred Ward in the film The Right Stuff (1983) and (very briefly) in the film Apollo 13 (1995) by Steve Bernie. He was portrayed in the 1998 HBO miniseries From the Earth to the Moon (1998) by Mark Rolston. Actor Kevin McCorkle played Grissom in the third-season finale of the NBC television show American Dreams. Bryan Cranston played Grissom as a nervous variety-show guest in the film That <b>Thing</b> <b>You</b> <b>Do!</b> Actor Joel Johnstone portrays Gus Grissom in the 2015 ABC TV series The Astronaut Wives Club.|$|E
5|$|Hanks {{made his}} debut as a {{director}} and screenwriter in the 1996 musical comedy That <b>Thing</b> <b>You</b> <b>Do!</b> Later in the same year, he founded with Gary Goetzman, his own film and television production company called Playtone. In 1998, Hanks executive produced the Emmy Award-winning docudrama miniseries From the Earth to the Moon and starred in Steven Spielberg-directed epic war film, Saving Private Ryan, which earned him his fourth nomination for Best Actor at the Academy Awards. Later that year, he reunited with Meg Ryan in another Ephron directed-romantic comedy, You've Got Mail. He also reprised his role in Toy Story, for its sequel, Toy Story 2. In 2000, Hanks starred in Cast Away, which earned him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor– Motion Picture Drama and a fifth nomination for Academy Award for Best Actor. In 2001, he executive produced Emmy Award-winning World War II mini-series Band of Brothers and the romantic comedy, My Big Fat Greek Wedding. The following year {{at the age of}} 45, he became the youngest person to receive the lifetime achievement award from the American Film Institute. This was followed in 2004, by BAFTA Los Angeles awarding him the Stanley Kubrick Britannia Award for Excellence in Film.|$|E

500|$|In New Zealand, {{the game}} was banned on December 11, 2003, with {{possession}} deemed an offence. Bill Hastings, the Chief Censor, stated [...] "it's a game where the only <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> is kill everybody you see ... You have to at least acquiesce in these murders and possibly tolerate, or even move towards enjoying them, which is injurious to the public good." [...] The game was similarly [...] "refused classification" [...] in Australia on September 28, 2004 by the Classification Review Board, despite having already been on sale {{for almost a year}} at the time with the classification of MA15+ (restricted to ages 15 and over).|$|E

500|$|She later {{appeared}} in That <b>Thing</b> <b>You</b> <b>Do!</b> (1996), {{a movie about}} a fictional one-hit wonder rock band called The Wonders, following their whirlwind {{rise to the top}} of the pop charts, and just as quickly, their plunge back to obscurity. The film was written and directed by Tom Hanks. It grossed over $25million worldwide, and was met with favorable reviews. The following year, she {{appeared in}} Inventing the Abbotts in 1997, in which she played the daughter of Will Patton and Barbara Williams' characters. The movie is based on a short story by Sue Miller. Entertainment Weekly declared Tyler's performance as [...] "lovely and pliant". That same year, Tyler was chosen by People magazine as one of the 50 Most Beautiful People.|$|E
500|$|Climax Studios {{began with}} the game's plot, which the {{development}} team considered the main appeal of the series. Early in the game's development, some team members visited a psychiatrist for research. The use of ice as a visual theme originated partly because the developers wanted to create an Otherworld for the game, as previous games in the series had featured the same theme as Silent Hill, and because snowfall is common in the northeastern or midwestern United States, where the fictional town is located. Falling snow was added to limit the player's visibility and build an atmosphere of dread. The developers included a system of psychological profiling that adjusted gameplay elements based on the player's interaction with the game. Writer Sam Barlow explained the system: [...] "ultimately every little <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> in the game or piece of content you can interact with can be assigned a little personality score. This is all added into a very classical psychometric profile of your personality that can then be mapped onto research." [...] The opening questionnaire has little significance in the player's profile. Capturing the multiple variations of gameplay elements for submission to the Entertainment Software Rating Board proved to be difficult, according to the game's producer, Tomm Hulett. Loading times were eliminated from the game to maintain a sense of immersion for the player.|$|E
500|$|James Cromwell {{was cast}} as Zefram Cochrane, {{the pilot and}} creator of Earth's first warp capable vessel. The {{character}} of Zefram Cochrane had {{first appeared in the}} Original Series episode [...] "", played by Glenn Corbett. Cromwell's Cochrane is much older and has no real resemblance to Corbett, which did not bother the writers. They wanted to portray Cochrane as a character going through a major transition; he starts out as a cynical, selfish drunk who is changed by the characters he meets {{over the course of the}} film. Although the character was written with Cromwell in mind, Tom Hanks, a fan of Star Trek, was approached for the role by Paramount first, but he had already committed to the film That <b>Thing</b> <b>You</b> <b>Do!</b> and had to reject the part. Frakes commented that it would have been a mistake to cast Hanks as Cochrane due to him being so well known. Cromwell had a long previous association with Star Trek, having played characters in The Next Generation episodes [...] "" [...] and [...] "", as well as a role in [...] [...] " [...] actually came in and read for the part", Frakes said. [...] "He nailed it." [...] Cromwell described his method of portraying Cochrane as always playing himself. Part of the actor's interest in the film was his involvement in Steven M. Greer's Center for the Study of Extraterrestrial Intelligence, which offers training for first contact scenarios. In this film, Cromwell's Cochrane became the first character to use the phrase [...] "star trek" [...] in the history of the franchise ("You're all astronauts, on some kind of star trek.") ...|$|E
