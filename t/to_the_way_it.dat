5|$|Israeli {{military}} {{officials said the}} Palestinians intended to build a mosque on {{the ruins of the}} site. The statement came after workers repairing the tomb painted the site's dome green, the colour of Islam. A Palestinian Authority spokesman denied the allegations and said that Arafat had ordered the renovations and for the synagogue to be rebuilt. Ghassan Shakaa, the mayor, claimed that city officials simply wanted to return the building <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> looked before it came into Israeli hands in the 1967 Mideast war.

Wallace discovers that his biological father is alive and takes a romantic interest in Jackie.|$|E
5|$|Stone {{wanted to}} {{recreate}} the Kennedy assassination in Dealey Plaza. His producers had to pay the Dallas City Council {{a substantial amount of}} money to hire police to reroute traffic and close streets for three weeks. He only had ten days to shoot all of the footage he needed and so he used seven cameras (two 35mm and five 16mm) and 14 film stocks. Getting permission to shoot in the Texas School Book Depository was more difficult. They had to pay $50,000 to put someone in the window from which Oswald was supposed to have shot Kennedy. They were allowed to film in that location only between certain hours with only five people on the floor at one time: the camera crew, an actor and Stone. Co-producer Clayton Townsend has said that the hardest part was getting the permission to restore the building <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> looked back in 1963. It took five months of negotiation.|$|E

Using a Turing machine equivalent programming language, the system itself occasionally executes self-delimiting, initially highly random "self-modification programs" which modify the context-dependent probabilities of future action sequences (including future self-modification programs). (2) The system keeps only those probability modifications computed by "useful" selfmodification programs: those which bring about more payoff (reward, reinforcement) per time than all previous self-modi [...] ...|$|R
