2500|$|When {{the crank}} {{is driven by}} the {{connecting}} rod, a problem arises when the crank is at <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (0°) or bottom dead centre (180°). [...] At these points in the crank's cycle, a force on the connecting rod causes no torque on the crank. [...] Therefore, if the crank is stationary and happens to be at one of these two points, it cannot be started moving by the connecting rod. [...] For this reason, in steam locomotives, whose wheels are driven by cranks, the connecting rods are attached to the wheels at points separated by some angle, so that regardless of the position of the wheels when the engine starts, at least one connecting rod will be able to exert torque to start the train.|$|E

For example, ignition timing is normally specified as degrees of crankshaft rotation before <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (BTDC).

40|$|The study {{investigates the}} {{mechanism}} of ring-liner lubrication {{in the vicinity of}} the <b>top</b> and bottom <b>dead</b> <b>centres</b> of an internal combustion engine. Predicting lubricant transient behaviour is critical when the inlet reversal leads to thin films and inherent metal-to-metal interaction. It was found that the cavitation, which is located at the trailing edge of the contact before reversal, briefly survives after reversal as a confined bubble at the leading edge. This depletes the film promoting starvation. Several algorithms were compared. It is concluded that the lubricant film is thinner than initially thought...|$|R
50|$|This is {{different}} from the design of other oval style chainrings, which have the smaller effective chainring diameter coincide with the cranks being at <b>top</b> and bottom <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (TDC and BDC), thus making the crank easier for the rider to turn through BDC for a constant chain tension. By having the chainring at its peak effective diameter with the cranks level, where the rider has maximum leverage over the crank during the power stroke, these designs are supposed to make better use of the rider's power output.|$|R

5000|$|While the {{coupling}} rods of a locomotive can be completely balanced by weights on the driving wheels since their motion is completely rotational, the reciprocating {{motions of the}} pistons, piston rods, main rods and valve gear cannot be balanced in this way. A two-cylinder locomotive has its two cranks [...] "quartered" [...] — set at 90° apart — so that the four power strokes of the double-acting pistons are evenly distributed around the cycle {{and there are no}} points at which both pistons are at <b>top</b> or bottom <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> simultaneously.|$|R
40|$|A special type of the {{gas engine}} with {{external}} combustion is called Stirling engine. The mechanism has two pistons with two volumes inside. The pistons are connected together through cooler, regenerator and warmer. The engine effectivity depends on the piston movement behaviour. The usual sinusoidal time curve leads to low effectiveness. The quick movement from lower to upper position with a certain delay in both <b>top</b> and bottom <b>dead</b> <b>centres</b> is more effective. The paper deals with three types of mechanisms, analyzing the piston movement, and their behavior. Special emphasize is taken to the piston movement regime...|$|R
40|$|DOI: [URL] chainrings and novel {{pedal to}} crank {{interfaces}} {{have been designed}} to optimize variables related to cycling performance (e. g. peak crank torque and efficiency), with conflicting results in terms of performance. Therefore, the aim of the present article was to review the theoretical background of noncircular chainrings and novel pedal to crank interfaces and their effects on biomechanical, physiological and performance variables. Reducing internal work, crank peak torque, and time spent at the <b>top</b> and bottom <b>dead</b> <b>centres</b> (12 o’clock and 6 o’clock positions, respectively) were among the various targets of noncircular chainrings and novel pedal to crank interface design. Changes in joint kinematics without effects on muscle activation were observed when cyclists were assessed using noncircular chainrings and novel pedal to crank interfaces. Conflicting results for economy/efficiency explain the unclear effects of noncircular chainrings on cycling performance and the positive effects of some novel pedal to crank interfaces on cycling economy/efficiency...|$|R

40|$|This {{article has}} been {{published}} in the journal, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part C: Journal of Mechanical Engineering Science [© PEP]. The definitive version is available at: [URL] paper provides a detailed analysis of the compression ring–bore/liner conjunction. The analysis includes ring–bore conformability and global in-plane deformation of ring fitted in situ. The analysis for fitted ring in an out-of-round bore shows very good agreement with precise measurements, using a coordinate measuring machine. The analysis also includes the lubricated conjunction under a transient regime of lubrication, taking into account combined elastohydrodynamics and asperity interactions. The transient nature of the tribological conjunction has been demonstrated, particularly the prevalent mixed/boundary regime of lubrication at the <b>top</b> and bottom <b>dead</b> <b>centres.</b> The analysis is applied to a high performance motorbike engine subjected to very high impact loads and engine speeds of the order of 13 000 r/min. Furthermore, the predictions of the model show good conformance to the measurements of friction reported by other research workers...|$|R

50|$|The valve {{is usually}} {{constructed}} as a circular poppet valve with a conical seat, {{inserted into the}} cylinder from the outside. A protrusion on the inside is hit by the piston as it approaches <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre,</b> forcing the valve open.|$|E
50|$|More generally, the <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> is any {{position}} of a crank where the applied force is straight along its axis, meaning no turning force can be applied. Many sorts of machines are crank driven, including unicycles, bicycles, tricycles, various types of machine presses, gasoline engines, diesel engines, steam locomotives, and other steam engines. Crank-driven machines rely on the energy stored in a flywheel to overcome the <b>dead</b> <b>centre,</b> or are designed, {{in the case of}} multi-cylinder engines, so that <b>dead</b> <b>centres</b> can never exist on all cranks at the same time.
