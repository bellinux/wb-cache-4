She continued to keep house, cook and sew for wealthy families for 15 years.

5|$|In the {{interests}} of accuracy, Heyer once purchased a letter written by the Duke of Wellington so <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> precisely employ his style of writing. She claimed that every word attributed to Wellington in An Infamous Army was actually spoken or written by him in real life. Her knowledge of the period was so extensive that Heyer rarely mentioned dates explicitly in her books; instead, she situated the story by casually referring to major and minor events of the time.|$|E
5|$|Laurent {{had also}} planned another feature film, Putain de pluie!, {{produced}} by Alain Attal's Productions du Trésor, whose script she co-wrote with Morgan Perez and which {{she intended to}} direct.

Knowing <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> speak French, and had already acted in French in one of the short films in Paris, je t'aime, she offered the first role to Natalie Portman, who declined because of the script's language.|$|E

5|$|On 17 April 1555, Elizabeth was {{recalled}} {{to court}} to attend {{the final stages of}} Mary's apparent pregnancy. If Mary and her child died, Elizabeth would become queen. If, on the other hand, Mary gave birth to a healthy child, Elizabeth's chances of becoming queen would recede sharply. When it became clear that Mary was not pregnant, no one believed any longer <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have a child. Elizabeth's succession seemed assured.|$|E
5|$|Paine resumed {{teaching}} and painted portraits to supplement her earnings, {{allowing her to}} support herself and send money to her mother, stepfather and their family, who had moved to Connecticut.

5|$|While hiking at {{a family}} reunion in 1980, Brodie became unusually tired. She was shortly {{diagnosed}} with metastatic lung cancer, although she had never smoked. Between chemotherapy treatments, she pushed ahead to complete the Nixon study, her three children and a daughter-in-law providing moral and editorial support in her time of need. Knowing <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> never complete a full biography, she ended the manuscript with Nixon's pre-presidential years, lending it an unfinished quality.|$|E
5|$|After a short honeymoon, Beatrice and {{her husband}} {{fulfilled}} their promise {{and returned to the}} Queen's side. The Queen made it clear <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not cope on her own and that the couple could not travel without her. Although the Queen relaxed this restriction shortly after the marriage, Beatrice and Henry travelled only to make short visits with his family. Beatrice's love for Henry, like that of the Queen's for the Prince Consort, seemed to increase the longer they were married. When Henry travelled without Beatrice, she appeared happier when he returned.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} the first 15 {{years of the}} sentence, Lebrón's social worker told her <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> ask for parole, {{but she did not}} display interest in the proposal, never signing the required documentation. Due to this lack of interest, she was mandated to attend a meeting before a penitentiary committee, where she presented a written deposition expressing her position about the parole proposal as well as other subjects including terrorism, politics and the United States' use of the atomic bomb. Following this the other inmates reacted with skepticism over her intentions to refuse the offer, which made her distance herself from them and focus her attention in studying as well as writing poetry. During this timeframe, Lebrón's interest in religion grew. Lebrón's daughter Gladys died in 1977, while her mother was in prison.|$|E

Part of her wishes to be normal, so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be carefree {{and spend time}} with Garrett, for whom she has a tender spot in her heart. However, for the most part, she is just as ruthless and cruel as her father. Although she confesses to Garrett often <b>that</b> <b>she</b> wishes <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{get rid of this}} part of herself, she knows well enough <b>that</b> <b>she</b> never will.|$|R

5|$|Britten {{had been}} in poor health since {{undergoing}} heart surgery in 1973, and on 4 December 1976 he died.

That year she made her final festival appearance as a performer when she stood in for the indisposed conductor André Previn at the Snape Maltings Training Orchestra's inaugural festival concert. On retirement, she accepted the honorary title of Artistic Director Emeritus.|$|E
