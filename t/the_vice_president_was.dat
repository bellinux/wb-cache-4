5|$|Contemporaneously to {{establishment}} {{of the office of}} the President, representatives of the Congress of People's Deputies voted to remove Article 6 from the Soviet constitution which stated that the Soviet Union was a one-party state controlled by the Communist Party which, in turn, played the leading role in society. This vote weakened the Party and its hegemony over the Soviet Union and its people. Upon death, resignation, or removal from office of an incumbent President, the Vice President of the Soviet Union would assume the office, though the Soviet Union collapsed before this was actually tested. After the failed August Coup <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> <b>was</b> replaced by an elected member of the State Council of the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} before the shooting, Vice President George H. W. Bush {{received}} the assignment of running crisis management in case of emergency despite Secretary of State Alexander Haig's objection. When the White House learned of the assassination attempt, however, Bush was over Texas aboard Air Force Two, which did not have secure voice communications, and his discussions with the White House were intercepted and given to the press. <b>The</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president</b> <b>was</b> notified in Fort Worth, Texas of the shooting within eight minutes, but relying on the initial reports that Reagan was unharmed his plane flew to Austin for a speech. After learning that the president was wounded, Air Force Two refueled in Austin before returning to Washington at what its pilot described as the fastest speed in the plane's history.|$|E
5|$|Due to a miscommunication, the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (MPDC) {{failed to}} follow its own search {{parameters}} in Rock Creek Park, leaving Levy's body to decompose for a year. Furthermore, the MPDC had been informed, and soon dismissed, that Ingmar Guandique, already arrested for attacking women in Rock Creek Park, had confessed to attacking Levy. The MPDC instead put {{much of its}} focus on the revelation that Levy {{was having an affair}} with Congressman Gary Condit, a married Democrat then serving his fifth term representing California's 18th congressional district, and a senior member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Condit had an overwhelming alibi (he was in meetings with <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President),</b> <b>was</b> never named as a suspect by police and was eventually cleared of any involvement in the disappearance. However, due to the cloud of suspicion raised by the intense media focus on the missing intern and the later revelation of the affair, Condit lost his bid for re-election in 2002.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President's</b> color (with fringe, tassels, and {{ornamental}} flagstaff) {{is displayed}} in his office, usually {{along with the}} flag of the United States and sometimes others, and sometimes as a backdrop when he speaks. [...] The flag will be flown from the after masthead of a U.S. Navy ship while <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> <b>is</b> aboard, and <b>the</b> Navy also prescribes several other flag sizes to use in various situations when <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> <b>is</b> present.

25|$|Bearing {{similarities}} {{with the}} office as created in the 1935 Constitution before that Constitution was abolished by the Marcos regime, the current office of <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> <b>was</b> re-established under the 1987 Constitution.|$|E
25|$|Selecting <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> <b>was</b> {{a simpler}} process. Whichever {{candidate}} received the second {{greatest number of}} votes became Vice President. The Vice President, unlike the President, was not required to receive votes from {{a majority of the}} electors. In the event of a tie for second place, the Senate would choose who would be Vice President from those tied, with each Senator casting one vote. It was not specified in the Constitution whether the sitting Vice President could cast a tie-breaking vote for Vice President under the original formula.|$|E
25|$|In the 1796 election, John Adams, the Federalist Party presidential candidate, {{received}} {{a majority of}} the electoral votes. However, the Federalist electors scattered their second votes, resulting in the Democratic-Republican Party presidential candidate, Thomas Jefferson, receiving the second highest number of electoral votes and thus being elected Vice President. It became apparent that if <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> <b>was</b> a defeated electoral opponent of the President the two might not work together effectively. By having the President and Vice President elected on a party ticket, this possibility would be eliminated but it raised a different flaw in the arrangements.|$|E

25|$|Historically, <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> <b>was</b> {{not given}} an {{official}} residence. However, the Vice President also held office {{along with the}} President at the Executive Building (now Kalayaan Hall) in the complex of Malacañang Palace from 1935 until 1972, when the position was abolished under martial law and the 1973 Constitution. When the position was reinstated, Vice President Salvador H. Laurel held office at the former Legislative Building on Padre Burgos Avenue, Manila, until the building became the National Museum of Fine Arts of the National Museum of the Philippines. The Vice President's office {{was transferred to the}} Philippine International Convention Center, and again to the PNB Financial Center, both in Pasay, Metro Manila in 2005. In 2011, the Coconut Palace also in Pasay was designated as the principal workplace of the Vice President of the Philippines. Beginning June 30, 2016, the office was transferred to the Quezon City Reception House in Quezon City.|$|E
500|$|The vice {{president}} had in recent administrations {{been considered a}} relatively low-level political functionary, whose activities were generally limited to the constitutional function of presiding over the Senate. Hobart, however, became a close adviser to McKinley and his Cabinet members, although he was not called upon to attend Cabinet meetings. Reporter Arthur Wallace Dunn wrote of Hobart in 1922, [...] "for {{the first time in}} my recollection, and the last for that matter, <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> <b>was</b> recognized as somebody, as a part of the Administration, and as a part of the body over which he presided".|$|E
500|$|Less certain was {{the choice}} for the vice presidency, which {{contained}} little definitive job description in the constitution. The only official role of <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president</b> <b>was</b> {{as the president of}} the Senate, a duty unrelated to the executive branch. The Constitution stipulated that the position would be awarded to the runner-up in the presidential election, or the person with the second highest amount of electoral votes. Because Washington was from Virginia, many, including Washington himself (who remained neutral on the candidates) assumed that a vice president would be chosen from one of the northern states to ease sectional tensions. In an August 1788 letter, Thomas Jefferson wrote that he considered John Adams and John Hancock, both prominent citizens from Massachusetts, to be the top contenders. He suggested John Jay, James Madison, and John Rutledge as other possible candidates. In January 1789, upon hearing that Adams would probably win the vice presidency, Washington wrote to Henry Knox, saying [...] " [...] entirely satisfied with the arrangement for filling the second office." ...|$|E

500|$|Investigative {{reporters and}} Democratic {{operatives}} had pursued rumors that Agnew had been corrupt {{during his years}} as a Maryland official, but they {{had not been able to}} substantiate them. In February 1973, Agnew heard of the investigation and had Attorney General Richard Kleindienst contact Beall. The vice president's personal attorney, George White, visited Beall, who stated that Agnew was not under investigation, and that prosecutors would do their best to protect Agnew's name. In June, Matz's attorney disclosed to Beall that his client could show that Agnew not only had been corrupt, but that payments to him had continued into his vice presidency. These later payments would not be barred by the statute of limitations; Agnew could be prosecuted. On July 3, Beall informed the new Attorney General, Elliot Richardson, and at the end of the month Nixon, through his chief of staff, Alexander Haig, was informed. Agnew had already met with both Nixon and Haig to assert his innocence. On August 1, Beall sent a letter to Agnew's attorney, formally advising that <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president</b> <b>was</b> under investigation for tax fraud and corruption. Matz was prepared to testify that he had met with Agnew at the White House and given him $10,000 in cash. Another witness, Jerome B. Wolff, head of Maryland's road commission, had extensive documentation that detailed, as Beall put it, [...] "every corrupt payment he participated in with then-Governor Agnew".|$|E
500|$|Fillmore {{had spent}} the four months between the {{election}} and swearing-in being feted by the New York Whigs and winding up affairs in the comptroller's office. Taylor had written promising influence in the new administration, but the president-elect mistakenly thought that <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president</b> <b>was</b> a cabinet member, which was not true in the 19th century. Fillmore, Seward and Weed had met and come to general agreement on how to divide federal jobs in New York. Seward, once he went to Washington, made friendly contact with Taylor's cabinet nominees, advisers, and the general's brother, and an alliance between the incoming administration and the Weed machine was soon under way behind Fillmore's back. [...] In exchange for support, Seward and Weed were allowed to designate who would fill federal jobs in New York, with Fillmore given far less than had been agreed. When Fillmore, after the inauguration, discovered this, he went to Taylor, but the only result was that the warfare against Fillmore's influence became open. Fillmore supporters like Collier, who had nominated him at the convention, were passed over for candidates backed by Weed, who was triumphant even in Buffalo. This greatly increased the influence of Weed in New York politics, and diminished Fillmore's. According to Rayback, [...] "by mid-1849, Fillmore's situation had become desperate." [...] Despite his lack of influence, he was pestered by office seekers and those seeking to lease or sell a house to him, as there was then no official residence for the vice president. [...] He enjoyed one aspect of his office, due to his lifelong love of learning: he became {{deeply involved in the}} administration of the Smithsonian Institution as a member ex officio of its Board of Regents.|$|E
2500|$|The {{only time}} the Senate chose <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president</b> <b>was</b> in 1837. In that instance, the Senate adopted an {{alphabetical}} roll call and voting aloud. The rules further stated, [...] "f {{a majority of}} the number of senators shall vote for either the said Richard M. Johnson or Francis Granger, he shall be declared by the presiding officer of the Senate constitutionally elected Vice President of the United States"; the Senate chose Johnson.|$|E

2500|$|Gonzales {{fought with}} Congress to keep Vice President Dick Cheney's Energy Task Force {{documents}} from being reviewed. His arguments were ultimately upheld by courts.

2500|$|Atchison {{was very}} popular with his fellow Senate Democrats. When the Democrats {{took control of the}} Senate in December 1845, they chose Atchison as President pro tempore, placing him third in {{succession}} for the Presidency, and also giving him the duty of presiding over the Senate when <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> <b>was</b> absent. He was then only 38 years old and had served in the Senate just two years. In 1849 Atchison stepped down as President pro tempore in favor of William R. King. [...] King in turn yielded the office back to Atchison in December 1852, since King had been elected Vice President of the United States. Atchison continued as President pro tempore until December 1854.|$|E
2500|$|Vice President Spiro Agnew lit the 1971 National Christmas Tree. Protesters briefly {{interrupted}} {{the beginning of}} Agnew's speech, chanting for peace, before Agnew and seven-year-old Gary Morris (a child in the institutional care of the city) lit the tree. On December 15, Women Strike for Peace was granted permission by Judge Joseph Cornelius Waddy of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to place an anti-war display next to the National Christmas Tree, {{but they did not}} have time to erect a display before the lighting ceremony. The tree-topper that year resembled a white snowflake, while the tree itself was decorated with red and white bulbs in clusters amid a wider blanket of gold lights. There were 56 trees in Pageant of Peace, plus an extra tree for POW/MIAs. Vice President Agnew again lit the tree in 1972. Assisting <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> <b>was</b> Eric Watt, 10-year-old son of future Secretary of the Interior James G. Watt. More than 9,000 green bulbs, 1,000 clear bulbs, and 250 [...] globe bulbs were used to decorate the tree. The U.S. Army supplied floodlights which also helped to illuminate the tree, which was kept lit 24 hours a day. There were 57 trees representing the 50 U.S. states and territories at the Pageant of Peace, with another 75 evergreen trees for decoration. The trees were again placed {{in the shape of a}} giant [...] "V" [...] rather than two parallel rows. The American Mining Congress declined to supply the smaller trees in 1972, so the state of Pennsylvania agreed to do so. Former President Harry S. Truman died on December 26, 1972. All performances at the Pageant of Peace were cancelled on December 28 (the national day of mourning for Truman), although the tree remained lit for security reasons. Although there were no protests at the tree lighting ceremony, anti-war protests were held at the Pageant of Peace on December 25 and December 30.|$|E
