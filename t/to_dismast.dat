500|$|As the American ship approached, Broke {{spoke to}} his crew, ending with a {{description}} of his philosophy of gunnery, [...] "Throw no shot away. Aim every one. Keep cool. Work steadily.

500|$|Historical {{analysis}} of the battle has praised Barlow's conduct: his tactics of refusing to allow the French ship to come alongside and board his vessel, thereby turning the French superiority in numbers into a disadvantage was commended by William James, and historian Tom Wareham has noted that the standing British practice of firing into enemy hulls {{rather than at the}} rigging as practiced by the French gave Barlow an advantage against the crowded decks of Africaine. Saulnier too has been praised for his efforts to avoid combat with his ship so overladen and for the subsequent valour with which his crew and their passengers fought so fiercely for two hours against mounting odds and in the face of [...] "truly dreadful" [...] casualties, although he was also subject to criticism in France when it emerged that he had removed the quoins from his guns in an effort to force his men to fire at the British rigging rather than the hull: Bonaparte ordered that in future his ships intended [...] "not <b>to</b> <b>dismast</b> the enemy, but to do him as much harm as possible." ...|$|E

50|$|It {{was in the}} {{aftermath}} of the battle that Redmill and the old Polyphemus won their spurs, having suffered just six casualties in the battle and very little in the way of structural damage, Polyphemus needed no repairs and could parcel out her supplies to other ships in more desperate need, as well as offer a tow <b>to</b> <b>dismasted</b> ships which could no longer sail unaided. The British flagship Victory was just such a victim, and during the week of ferocious storms which followed the battle, Redmill nursed his stricken superior back to Gibraltar by means of an enormous towrope attached with great difficulty to the bow of Victory and at the other end to Redmill's own cabin on Polyphemus.|$|R
25|$|Lloyd's List {{reported}} on 28 January 1800 that La Fraternite, {{which had been}} sailing from Liverpool to Africa, had returned <b>to</b> Liverpool <b>dismasted.</b> Before she returned she had encountered Pursuit. While Pursuit had been sailing from London to Jamaica, she had repelled an attack by a French privateer, but {{at the cost of}} the death of all her officers, except her master, who had been severely wounded. La Fraternite had put a mate on board Pursuit to help her return to port.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not so, Greenly," [...] {{returned}} Sir Gervaise calmly. [...] "You see he edges away already, {{and will}} be down among his other ships in five minutes; {{we should have a}} general action with twice our force. What is done, is well done, and we will let it stand. It is something <b>to</b> have <b>dismasted</b> the enemy's commander-in-chief; do you look to it that the enemy don't do the same with ours. I heard shot rattling aloft, and every thing now bears a hard strain." ...|$|R
50|$|Sibylle {{departed}} Saint-Domingue, {{along with}} the 14-gun corvette Railleur, escorting a 16-ship convoy bound for North America. On 2 January 1783, the convoy was chased by the 44-gun ship of the line HMS Endymion and the 32-gun frigates HMS Emerald and Magicienne. Kergariou-Locmaria signaled the convoy to pursue its route with the Railleur, and endeavoured to cover its retreat, first engaging Magicienne. In the ensuing exchange of fire, Kergariou-Locmaria was severely wounded, but his first officer, Morel d'Escures, took command and managed <b>to</b> <b>dismast</b> Magicienne. Sibylle retreated when the Endymion and Emerald intervened. Thomas Graves, who commanded Magicienne, later addressed two engravings of the battle, one representing its beginning, and the other its end.|$|E

5|$|Both Foudroyant and Lion {{were too}} {{battered}} {{to provide an}} effective tow <b>to</b> the <b>dismasted</b> French ship, {{and as a result}} Penelope was left to bring the shattered Guillaume Tell into Syracuse on Sicily. Eventually the ship was repaired sufficiently for the journey to Britain, and there was added to the Royal Navy under the name HMS Malta. Malta was, with HMS Tonnant captured two years earlier at the Nile, the most powerful third rate in the British fleet, and served for many years, participating at the Battle of Cape Finisterre in 1805.|$|R
50|$|Recommissioned {{into the}} Channel Fleet under Captain James Gambier, she fought at the Glorious First of June in 1794, {{distinguishing}} herself in action against Mucius and Tourville, and {{becoming one of}} only two British ships <b>to</b> be completely <b>dismasted</b> in the battle. After repairs, she was sent to the Mediterranean, joining Admiral William Hotham in time {{to take part in the}} Battle of Hyeres in July.|$|R
500|$|The attack began {{well as the}} British {{destroyed}} several batteries [...] {{and took}} 55 prisoners of war, but soon the greater French numbers began to tell and the landing parties were pushed back to their beachheads in some confusion, having lost 32 killed, including Captain Long, 61 wounded and 105 missing, of which 15 dead, 33 wounded and 77 missing were British troops. General Watrin claimed this as a victory, inflating the numbers engaged and inaccurately claiming to have caused 1,200 casualties to the allies as well as having captured 200 men. Watrin also claimed <b>to</b> have <b>dismasted</b> a frigate and destroyed several smaller craft with fire from his batteries; none of the British warships reported any damage.|$|R
60|$|In these {{vast and}} solitary waters, <b>to</b> be <b>dismasted</b> {{is perhaps the}} worst calamity. Let the ship turn turtle and go down, and at least the pang is over. But men chained on a hulk may pass months {{scanning}} the empty sea-line and counting the steps of death's invisible approach. There is no help but in the boats, and what a help is that! There heaved the Currency Lass, for instance, a wingless lump, and the nearest human coast (that of Kauai in the Sandwiches) lay about a thousand miles to south and east of her. Over the way there, to men contemplating that passage in an open boat, all kinds of misery, {{and the fear of}} death and of madness, brooded.|$|R
50|$|Golding came {{seventh in}} the 2000-2001 Vendée Globe solo non stop round the world race having lost seven days <b>to</b> the <b>dismasting</b> of his Open 60, again called Group 4. His present Open 60 {{campaign}} is sponsored by Ecover, a Belgian ecological cleaning products company which has sponsored his team since 2001. In 2004, he won the IMOCA World Championship and successfully defended his title the following year, in which he also won the 2005 FICO World Championship. In the 2004 Vendée Globe, Golding finished third despite losing his keel — an accident which had caused boats in previous Vendée Globe races to overturn — {{on the last day}} of the race. He sailed the last fifty miles with a tiny sailplan to keep the boat upright.|$|R
5|$|The {{notion that}} the ship would have nailed her flag and never surrendered, as Barère claimed, is never {{accounted}} {{in any of the}} reports. Though Jean François Renaudin never explicitly states that he surrendered, he does mention that he had his flag flown half-mast in distress when he was surrounded by British ships, indicating that he was requesting assistance from the enemy. Griffiths observes that Vengeur was <b>dismasted</b> <b>to</b> the point that there would have been nothing on which to nail a flag anyway, and James makes mentions of Vengeur hoisting the Union Jack in submission.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{are likely}} to have a quiet night of it," [...] said the captain, glancing his eyes round at the heavens; [...] "and at eight o'clock to-morrow let all hands be called, when we will turn-to with a will, and make a brig of the old hussey. This topmast will do to bear the strain of the spare main-yard, unless there come another gale, and by reefing the new {{mainsail}} we shall be able to make something out of it. The topgallant-mast will fit of course above, and we may make out, by keeping a little free, to carry the sail: at need, we may possibly coax the contrivance into carrying a studding-sail also. We have sticks for no more, though we'll endeavour to get up something aft, out of the spare spars obtained from the store-ship. You may knock off at four bells, Mr. Leach, and let the poor fellows have their Saturday's night in peace. It is a misfortune enough <b>to</b> be <b>dismasted,</b> without having one's grog stopped." ...|$|R
50|$|John Crookshanks, {{commanding}} officer of the convoy’s escort, sent the brig to protect the merchantmen and ordered HMS Lark to attack the Glorioso. The result of this was that the heavy gunfire from the Spanish ship of the line left the British fifth-rate frigate badly damaged in the hull and the rigging. HMS Warwick then arrived and began to engage the Glorioso, only <b>to</b> be completely <b>dismasted</b> and forced <b>to</b> withdraw. The Glorioso was hit by four cannon balls in the hull, and suffered damage to the rigging. There were five killed (two of whom were civilians) and 44 wounded on the Glorioso. Despite widespread damage, HMS Warwick had only four seamen killed and 20 wounded.|$|R
5|$|As Bellerophon slowly drifted away, she was sighted by the 74-gun , {{approaching}} the centre. It was by now about 9 pm; {{in the darkness}} Swiftsures captain, Benjamin Hallowell, was unable <b>to</b> identify the <b>dismasted</b> ship and presumed {{that she was a}} damaged French ship attempting to escape. He debated firing into her, but decided to hold fire and press on to the French centre, where he eventually came to anchor astern of Orient, close to Bellerophons original position. Darby had by this time recovered sufficiently to resume command, and at his order the battered Bellerophon came to anchor at the east end of the bay, and her crew began making repairs. The battle raged throughout the night, and eventually ended in a decisive victory for the British. The next five days were spent repairing the ship and burying the dead. 49 men were killed and 148 wounded on Bellerophon. Eight more died of their wounds in the following week.|$|R
60|$|Luckily, {{this ship}} was {{ballasted}} with fresh water, and Captain Truck passed {{the night in}} negotiating a transfer of his steerage passengers, under an apprehension that, in the crippled state of his own vessel, his supplies might be exhausted before he could reach America. In the morning, the offer of being put on board the store-ship was made to those who chose to accept it, and all in the steerage, with most from the cabin, profited by the occasion <b>to</b> exchange a <b>dismasted</b> vessel for one that was, at least, full rigged. Provisions were transferred accordingly, and by noon next day the stranger made sail on a wind, the sea being tolerably smooth, and the breeze still ahead. In three hours {{she was out of}} sight to the northward and westward, the Montauk holding her own dull course to the southward, with the double view of striking the trades, or of reaching one of the Cape de Verdes.|$|R

6000|$|Collingwood was gifted {{with great}} {{political}} penetration. As yet, however, all was conjecture concerning the enemy; and Nelson, having victualled and watered at Tetuan, stood for Ceuta on the 24th, still without information of their course. Next day intelligence arrived that the CURIEUX brig {{had seen them}} on the 19th, standing to the northward. He proceeded off Cape St. Vincent, rather cruising for intelligence than knowing whither to betake himself; and here a case occurred that {{more than any other}} event in real history resembles those whimsical proofs of sagacity which Voltaire, in his Zadig, has borrowed from the Orientals. One of our frigates spoke an American, who, a little to the westward of the Azores, had fallen in with an armed vessel, appearing <b>to</b> be a <b>dismasted</b> privateer, deserted by her crew, which had been run on board by another ship, and had been set fire to; but the fire had gone out. A log-book and a few seamen's jackets were found in the cabin; and these were brought to Nelson. The log-book closed with these words: [...] "Two large vessels in the W.N.W.:" [...] and this led him to conclude that the vessel had been an English privateer, cruising off the Western Islands. But there was in this book a scrap of dirty paper, filled with figures. Nelson, immediately upon seeing it, observed that the figures were written by a Frenchman; and after studying this for a while, said, [...] "I can explain the whole. The jackets are of French manufacture, and prove that the privateer was in possession of the enemy. She had been chased and taken by the two ships that were seen in the W.N.W. The prizemaster, going on board in a hurry, forgot to take with him his reckoning: there is none in the log-book; and the dirty paper contains her work for the number of days since the privateer last left Corvo; with an unaccounted-for run, which I take to have been the chase, in his endeavour to find out her situation by back reckonings. By some mismanagement, I conclude she was run on board of by one of the enemy's ships, and dismasted. Not liking delay (for I am satisfied that those two ships were the advanced ones of the French squadron), and fancying we were close at their heels, they set fire to the vessel, and abandoned her in a hurry. If this explanation be correct, I infer from it that they are gone more to the northward; and more to the northward I will look for them." [...] This course accordingly he held, but still without success. Still persevering, and still disappointed, he returned near enough to Cadiz to ascertain that they were not there; traversed the Bay of Biscay; and then, as a last hope, stood over for the north-west coast of Ireland against adverse winds, till, on the evening of the 12th of August, he learned that they had not been heard of there. Frustrated thus in all his hopes, after a pursuit, to which, for its extent, rapidity, and perseverance, no parallel can be produced, he judged it best to reinforce the Channel fleet with his squadron, lest the enemy, as Collingwood apprehended, should bear down upon Brest with their whole collected force. On the 15th he joined Admiral Cornwallis off Ushant. No news had yet been obtained of the enemy; and on the same evening he received orders to proceed, with the VICTORY and SUPERB, to Portsmouth.|$|R
