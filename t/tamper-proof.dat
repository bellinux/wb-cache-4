Unlike previously proposed techniques, the novel approach provides spatial and frequency domain information on how the signal is modified.

Tamper detection is possible in the localized spatial and frequency regions of the given signal.

40|$|Three major aspects in the {{protection}} of digital documents have been pointed out, each of them with different requirements: first copyright protection, protecting ownership and usage rights# secondly <b>tamper-proofing,</b> aiming at checking documentintegrity# and thirdly authentication, the purpose {{of which is to}} check the authenticity of a document. While robust watermarks are typically used for copyright protection, fragile or semi-fragile watermarks are proposed to solve tamperproofing and authentication. However both concepts are generally proposed separately# further, most of robust watermarking schemes are vulnerable to the copy attack, whichallows copying a watermark from one document to another without need for any apriori knowledge [4]. In this paper we propose an hybrid watermarking method which joins a highly robust watermark with a fragile/semi-fragile watermark, combining copyright protection and <b>tamper-proofing,</b> and being at the same time resistant against copy attack# the fragile information is inserted in a way which fully preserves the robust part...|$|R
2500|$|Early {{locomotives}} were {{fitted with}} a valve controlled by a weight suspended from the end of a lever, with the steam outlet being stopped by a cone-shaped valve. As there was nothing to prevent the weighted lever from bouncing when the locomotive ran over irregularities in the track, thus wasting steam, the weight was later replaced by a more stable spring-loaded column, often supplied by Salter, a well-known spring scale manufacturer. The danger of these devices was that the driving crew could be tempted to add weight to the arm to increase pressure. Most early boilers were {{fitted with a}} <b>tamper-proof</b> [...] "lockup" [...] direct-loaded ball valve protected by a cowl. In the late 1850s, John Ramsbottom introduced a safety valve that became popular in Britain during {{the latter part of the}} 19th century. Not only was this valve <b>tamper-proof,</b> but tampering by the driver could only have the effect of easing pressure. George Richardson's safety valve was an American invention introduced in 1875, and was designed to release the steam only at the moment when the pressure attained the maximum permitted. This type of valve is in almost universal use at present. Britain's Great Western Railway was a notable exception to this rule, retaining the direct-loaded type until the end of its separate existence, because it was considered that such a valve lost less pressure between opening and closing.|$|E

This means that fuses can only be replaced by the preset (Type S) fuse rating.

2500|$|On [...] June 17, 1831, the Best Friend {{earned a}} rather grisly first [...] {{it became the}} first {{locomotive}} in the US to suffer a boiler explosion. [...] The blast {{is said to have}} been caused by the fireman tying down the steam pressure release valve; he had tired of listening to it whistle, so to stop the noise he closed the valve permanently (another account has the fireman placing a stout piece of lumber on the safety valve and sitting on it). Another reason may have been the fireman was trying to overpressure the boiler as the locomotive was expected to perform hard work i.e. climbing a gradient upon setting off. This was common practice and a common cause of boiler bursts until a <b>tamper-proof</b> safety valve was produced. The blocked valve caused the pressure within the boiler to exceed its capacity, and it exploded. The resulting blast was said to have hurled metal fragments over a wide area and killed the fireman. The locomotive's engineer Nicholas Darrell was uninjured in the explosion.|$|E
2500|$|By 14 August the {{division}} had {{pushed to the}} north bank of the River Noireau, where the crossings had been measured by the RE Reconnaissance Party. During the night of 15/16 August the infantry waded across and established a bridgehead, while 204 Fd Co advanced with a waterproofed bulldozer, three tipper lorries of flexboards, four landing stage units and two boat units, and No 1 Platoon got to work on clearing mines, building a tank ford and a trestle bridge. Downstream the river split into two streams, but No 2 Platoon erected two Class 9 trestle bridges. Meanwhile, 553 Fd Co began work on {{the division}}'s first Bailey bridge across the demolished road bridge.

5000|$|A bulla ( [...] , plural bullae) is an inscribed clay or {{soft metal}} (such as lead or tin) or bitumen or wax token used in {{commercial}} and legal documentation {{as a form}} of identification and for <b>tamper-proofing</b> whatever is attached to it (or, in the historical form, contained in it). In their oldest attested form, as used in the ancient Near and Middle East of the 8th millennium BCE onwards, bullae were hollow ball-like clay envelopes that contained other smaller tokens that identified the quantity and types of goods being recorded. In this form, bullae represent one of the earliest forms of specialization in the ancient world, and likely required skill to create. From about the 4th millennium BCE onwards, as communications on papyrus and parchment became widespread, bullae evolved into simpler tokens that were attached to the documents with cord, and impressed with a unique sign (i.e. seal) to provide the same kind of authoritative identification and for <b>tamper-proofing.</b> Bullae are still occasionally attached to documents for these purposes (cf. papal bull).|$|R
