5|$|The {{parliament}} of Croatia declared Croatia's {{independence and}} dissolved {{its association with}} Yugoslavia on 25 June 1991. The Croatian parliament's decision was partially boycotted by left-wing parliament deputies. The European Community and <b>the</b> <b>Conference</b> <b>on</b> Security and Cooperation in Europe urged Croatian authorities to place a three-month moratorium on the decision.|$|E
5|$|Croatia held an {{independence}} {{referendum on}} 19 May 1991, following the Croatian parliamentary elections of 1990 {{and the rise}} of ethnic tensions that led to the breakup of Yugoslavia. With 83 percent turnout, voters approved the referendum, with 93 percent in favor of independence. Subsequently, Croatia declared independence and the dissolution of its association with Yugoslavia on 25 June 1991, but it introduced a three-month moratorium on the decision when urged to do so by the European Community and <b>the</b> <b>Conference</b> <b>on</b> Security and Cooperation in Europe through the Brioni Agreement. The war in Croatia escalated during the moratorium, and on 8 October 1991, the Croatian Parliament severed all remaining ties with Yugoslavia. In 1992, the countries of the European Economic Community granted Croatia diplomatic recognition and Croatia was admitted to the United Nations.|$|E
5|$|Hughes, in {{his speech}} at the opening session of <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> <b>on</b> November 12, 1921, made the American proposal—the U.S would {{decommission}} or not build 30 warships if Great Britain did the same for 19 vessels, and Japan 17 ships. The secretary was generally successful, and agreements were reached on this and other points, including settlements to disputes over islands in the Pacific, and limitations {{on the use of}} poison gas. The naval agreement was limited to battleships and to some extent aircraft carriers, and in the end did not prevent rearmament. Nevertheless, Harding and Hughes were widely applauded in the press for their work. Harding had appointed Senator Lodge and the Senate Minority Leader, Alabama's Oscar Underwood, to the U.S. delegation; they helped ensure that the treaties made it through the Senate mostly unscathed, though that body added reservations to some of the treaties.|$|E

5|$|In May 1958, Britain had {{informed}} that US {{that it would}} be willing to join a testing moratorium on 31 October 1958, by which point it would have finished its hydrogen-bomb testing, conditional on the US providing Britain with nuclear information following amendment of the McMahon Act. The US Congress approved amendments permitting greater collaboration in late June. Following Soviet assent on 30 August 1958 to the one-year moratorium, the three countries conducted a series of tests in September and October. At least 54 tests were conducted by the US and 14 by the Soviet Union in this period. On 31 October 1958 the three countries initiated test-ban negotiations (<b>the</b> <b>Conference</b> <b>on</b> the Discontinuance of Nuclear Tests) and agreed to a temporary moratorium (the Soviet Union joined the moratorium shortly after this date). The moratorium would last for close to three years.|$|E
5|$|In a 2011 {{paper for}} <b>the</b> <b>Conference</b> <b>on</b> Human Factors in Computing Systems, authors Anna Eaglin and Shaowen Bardzell {{discussed}} the Magic Wand {{within the context}} of devices used in sexual behavior that were not originally created for that purpose. A 2012 study published in the journal Sexual and Relationship Therapy evaluated seven vibrators for use with clinical therapy for sexual stimulation. They found that the Magic Wand displayed a high degree of movement and oscillation. The researchers suggested that their data could be used by therapists to select the optimum vibrator which could deliver both effectiveness and sensitivity for their clients.|$|E
5|$|On 13 August 2012, Fuller {{signed for}} League Two side Barnet on a free transfer, along with Gillingham team-mate Curtis Weston. He made his debut for the Bees in a 1–1 draw with Bristol Rovers on 21 August 2012. He {{would go on}} to make 39 league appearances, {{cementing}} his place as the club's first choice right-back. Barnet started the 2012–13 season poorly, failing to win any of their first 12 league matches and were ultimately relegated to <b>the</b> <b>Conference</b> <b>on</b> goal difference after finishing in 23rd place. Barnet's relegation required manager Edgar Davids to release a number of players as an austerity measure to accommodate the fact that the club would be operating on a smaller wage budget in the 2013–14 season, and it was announced on 22 May 2013 that Fuller would be released along with 12 other players.|$|E

5|$|British {{knowledge}} of thermonuclear weapons {{was based on}} work done at the Los Alamos Laboratory during the war. Two British scientists, Bretscher and Fuchs, had attended <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> <b>on</b> the Super (as it was then called) there in April 1946, and Chadwick had written a secret report on it in May 1946. The Classic Super design was unsuccessful. Fuchs and John von Neumann had produced an ingenious alternative design, for which they filed a patent in May 1946. This was tested in the American Operation Greenhouse George test in May 1951, but was also found to be unworkable. There was also some intelligence about Joe 4 derived from its debris, which was provided to Britain under the 1948 Modus Vivendi. Penney established three megaton bomb projects at Aldermaston. Orange Herald, under Bryan Taylor, a large boosted fission weapon; Green Bamboo an interim thermonuclear design similar to Soviet Layer Cake used in Joe 4 and the American Alarm Clock; and Green Granite, a true thermonuclear design. Orange Herald {{would be the first}} British weapon to incorporate an external neutron initiator.|$|E
5|$|Five ECMM {{observers}} {{were killed in}} the attack, including four Italians and one Frenchman. The victims were Lieutenant Colonel Enzo Venturini, helicopter pilot, Staff Sergeant Marco Matta, co-pilot, Sergeant Major Fiorenzo Ramacci, Sergeant Major Silvano Natale, and Ship-of-the-line Lieutenant Jean-Loup Eychenne. The Italian personnel were drawn from the 5th Army Aviation Regiment Rigel. The second helicopter carried a diplomat and three Italian ECMM observers, none of whom were harmed. The crash site was toured by the police, ECMM staff and journalists, and EC representatives visited Belgrade to receive a report on the incident from Yugoslav authorities. The action of the Yugoslav Air Force was condemned by <b>the</b> <b>Conference</b> <b>on</b> Security and Co-operation in Europe, the United Nations Security Council, and the EC Council of Ministers. The Italian ambassador to Yugoslavia was recalled to Rome for consultations. Subsequently, Italy cancelled an air traffic agreement with Yugoslavia, causing Jat Airways to cancel Belgrade–Rome flights. In addition, ECMM operations were suspended for several days.|$|E

5|$|The Geneva Conference {{opened on}} 8 May 1954, {{the day after}} the {{surrender}} of the garrison. Ho Chi Minh entered <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> <b>on</b> the opening day with the news of his troops' victory in the headlines. The resulting agreement temporarily partitioned Vietnam into two zones: the North was administered by the communist Democratic Republic of Vietnam while the South was administered by the French-supported State of Vietnam. The last units of the French Union forces withdrew from Indochina in 1956. This partition was supposed to be temporary, and the two zones were meant to be reunited through national elections in 1956. After the French withdrawal, the United States supported the southern government, under Emperor Bao Dai and Prime Minister Ngo Dinh Diem, which opposed the Geneva agreement, and which claimed that Ho Chi Minh's forces from the North had been killing Northern loyalists and terrorizing people both north and south. The North was supported by both the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Soviet Union (USSR). This arrangement proved tenuous and escalated into the Vietnam War (Second Indochina War), eventually bringing 500,000 American troops into South Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|The subject came {{up again}} in 1930, during <b>the</b> <b>Conference</b> <b>on</b> Codification of International Law, held in The Hague. A strong {{contingent}} of women from America joined international women's groups to change the existing nationality laws, but the women were unable to agree on wording. Intense lobbying by women, and a massive parade demonstration, failed to influence the conferees, and the international law continued to hold that a woman's nationality followed her husband's. In response, Macmillan organised an International Committee for Action on the Nationality of Married Women early the next year. Six {{of the most influential}} international women's groups sought a broad base of support from working women. Macmillan's stated goal was to delay ratification of the Hague Convention, and to make certain that a woman's nationality would not change without her consent, and that the nationality of a couple's children would not be more influenced by the father's nationality. The new committee was successful in lobbying the League of Nations to address the problem, but when the League constituted a study group, that group was split between two intractable factions. On one side were those who wanted a married couple to have exactly one nationality, based on that of the husband, {{and on the other side}} were those like Macmillan who favoured independent citizenship between spouses, with the possibility of wives having different citizenship than their husbands, and children to be allowed dual citizenship. In 1932, the women's group, at an impasse, were pushed aside as ineffectual by the League of Nations, who decided in favour of ratifying the Hague Convention. The women's group disbanded, and the Hague convention was ratified in 1937.|$|E
