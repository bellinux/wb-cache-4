5|$|Life for the blue-collar men of {{the port}} is {{increasingly}} hard and work is scarce. As union leader, Sobotka has taken it on himself to reinvigorate the port by lobbying politicians to support much-needed infrastructure improvement initiatives. Lacking the funds needed {{for this kind of}} influence, Sobotka has become involved with a smuggling ring. Around him, his son and nephew also turn to crime, as they have few other opportunities to earn money. It becomes clear to the Sobotka detail that the dead girls are related to their investigation, as they were in a container <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> smuggled through the port. They again use wiretaps to infiltrate the crime ring and slowly work their way up the chain towards The Greek, the mysterious man in charge. But Valchek, upset that their focus has moved beyond Sobotka, gets the FBI involved. The Greek has a mole inside the FBI and starts severing his ties to Baltimore when he learns about the investigation.|$|E
5|$|Following the public's {{positive}} {{reaction to the}} graphics of the Final Fantasy VII Technical Demo for PS3 presented at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in 2005, {{it was decided to}} release the role-playing video game Final Fantasy XIII on the PlayStation 3 rather than the PlayStation 2 as originally planned. In August 2005, the Technology Division began working on the White Engine, a PlayStation 3 engine <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> exclusively used for Final Fantasy XIII. Eight months later, however, it was decided to repurpose the engine to further make it compatible with other projects such as the action RPG Final Fantasy Versus XIII (later rebranded and repurposed into Final Fantasy XV) and the massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) Final Fantasy XIV. In order for the company to stay competitive in a multi-platform environment, support of the engine was extended from the PlayStation 3 to the Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows, both of which were successful in Western markets. This marked the official development start of a company-wide engine for whose purpose the Technology Division was expanded into the Research and Development Division in September 2006. Murata remained the division's general manager with a full-time staff at his disposal.|$|E

The Meteor {{played a key role}} during the Suez Crisis; on 28 October 1956, an Israeli NF.13 took part in Operation Tarnegol, in which it successfully located and shot down an Egyptian Ilyushin Il-14 that had been carrying several high-ranking Egyptian Military officers {{on the eve of the}} crisis. The operation had intended to shoot down the Il-14 <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> carrying the supreme commander of the Egyptian armed forces, Abdel Hakim Amer, however a different aircraft had been inadvertently attacked and destroyed instead. After deploying paratroopers east of the Suez Canal, the Israeli Air Force continued to support them on the ground predominantly using its jet aircraft, fearing its propeller-driven aircraft would be vulnerable against Egypt's own jet fighters.|$|E

25|$|Smith, {{although}} {{running for}} his campaign, {{would refuse to}} leave without beginning the skeleton of a new park and parkway system for Long Island {{and make sure the}} land needed would be in property of the state. Smith continued ripping the politicians and that they were on the side of those in Wheatley Hills and pledged to keep the parkway out of their neighborhood. However, Smith argued that the sentiment had changed in Wheatley Hills and that most of the residents were in support of the project. However, Hewitt and Hutchinson refused to permit the money because they would not touch any money until the Southern State Parkway was completed. Smith denied that agreement ever occurred. The money <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> use was from unappropriated state land in New York City. The money for purchasing land would go to those who agreed with the LISPC on prices or those who could not afford to give away the land.|$|E
25|$|Homeopathy {{achieved}} {{its greatest}} {{popularity in the}} 19th century. It {{was introduced to the}} United States in 1825 by Hans Birch Gram, a student of Hahnemann. The first homeopathic school in the US opened in 1835, and in 1844, the first US national medical association, the American Institute of Homeopathy, was established. Throughout the 19th century, dozens of homeopathic institutions appeared in Europe and the United States, and by 1900, there were 22 homeopathic colleges and 15,000 practitioners in the United States. Because medical practice of the time relied on ineffective and often dangerous treatments, patients of homeopaths often had better outcomes than those of the doctors of the time. Homeopathic preparations, even if ineffective, would almost surely cause no harm, making the users of homeopathic preparations less likely to be killed by the treatment <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> helping them. The relative success of homeopathy in the 19th century may have led to the abandonment of the ineffective and harmful treatments of bloodletting and purging and to have begun the move towards more effective, science-based medicine.|$|E
25|$|Modern-day {{authorities}} disagree as to {{how much}} of Gerard's Herball was original. Garret made a chance visit to the Norton publishing shop, where he discovered the proofs of the Herball, and alerted the Nortons as both to errors he discovered in the proofs and to the incorporation of some of L'Obel's material in Gerard's new book. This story is recounted by L'Obel in his Stirpium illustrationes (1655) in which he accuses Gerard of plagiarism. Although they were not concerned about plagiarism, the Nortons, fearing errors in a book <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an expert reference guide, hired L'Obel, as an internationally recognized expert on plants (who had as Gerard’s friend, unwittingly contributed to his book) to proof the translations, fix the mismatched illustrations, and right its textual wrongs. When Gerard discovered L'Obel's thankless efforts, he had him dismissed. Although Gerard was an experienced collector and plantsman, unlike L'Obel he lacked scholarship, as is evident in his dedication to Burghley, where he paints a picture of himself as a gardener. Gerard dismissed L'Obel's criticisms as being due to his unfamiliarity with English idioms. Norton decided to proceed with publication despite these difficulties. He decided against using Dodoens' original illustrations since this would have revealed the actual source of the material, but instead rented woodblocks from Nicolaus Bassaeus in Frankfurt, about 1,800 in all, only 16 being original. However, Gerard was then faced with the difficulty of matching them to the text and frequently mislabelled them.|$|E

During the filming of [...] "Unusual Suspects"—an episode that would largely feature Byers feeling a romantic connection to Susanne—Harwood removed his wedding ring, deducing that in 1989, when the episode took place, Byers had not been married yet. However, [...] "Three of a Kind"—which takes place in 1999—features Byers once again romantically drawn to Susanne. Harwood explained, [...] "And then [...] brought back the character Suzanne [...] Modeski back in season six, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in the present. So I had to redo my back story; I said Byers had been divorced".|$|E

[...] Furthermore, Eastwood's 2014 movie American Sniper was met with strong critical praise, especially from many Republicans who called it a pro-War on Terror, pro-Republican, and patriotic film; Eastwood responded by saying that such notions represented a [...] "stupid analysis" [...] and that the movie had nothing to do with political parties. Eastwood responded to critics of American Sniper by saying his film was [...] "the biggest anti-war statement any film can make", and that the film depicts [...] "the fact of what [...] does to the family and the people who have to go back into civilian life like Chris Kyle did" [...] and [...] "what it (war) does to the people left behind." ...|$|E

500|$|Thom Brennaman {{immediately}} {{hailed the}} game {{as one of the}} greatest upsets in the history of sports; Charissa Thompson told coach Jerry Moore that it was [...] "one of the greatest upsets in college football history." [...] Many media outlets described it as one of, if not the greatest, upsets in the history of college football. The win marked the first time an FCS team had beaten a ranked FBS program. [...] Dan Wetzel of Yahoo! Sports wrote that: [...] "This game was supposed to be the prime example of what had gone wrong in money hungry college football. The powers that be had expanded the season a couple years back, adding an extra game so big schools could bring in cream-puff opponents while collecting millions in revenue. Michigan had never played a I-AA opponent in its history. Now we know why, the Wolverines were ducking them. Instead of an easy tune-up for Michigan, Appalachian State leaves with its most profound victory ever and a check for $400,000 <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> their pay for getting punished." [...] Sports Illustrated writer Stewart Mandel wrote that he felt [...] "utterly unqualified" [...] to put the game into perspective, and said [...] "there's no logical reason whatsoever this should have happened. But it did. And it wasn't the slightest bit fluky." [...] He also expressed disappointment that he would not be able to vote for the Mountaineers in his AP Poll ballot, explaining that [...] "it may well turn out that Michigan was grossly overrated, but all I know is this: There will not be 25 other teams that accomplish more this opening weekend than Appalachian State did Saturday. There won't even be five." [...] Pat Forde of ESPN.com called it [...] "the most astonishing college football result I can remember," [...] saying that [...] "we'll still be talking about it a few decades from now. Especially in the locker rooms of every huge underdog, where they'll say, 'If Appalachian State can beat Michigan, why can't we shock the world, too?.'" [...] He felt the upset was particularly impressive because upsets of such a magnitude do not happen often in college football. The New York Times writer Viv Bernstein called the game [...] "one of the biggest upsets in college football history" [...] and called it [...] "a stunning upset by any measure."
