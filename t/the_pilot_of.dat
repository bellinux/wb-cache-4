5|$|On 29 September 1940, a mid-air {{collision}} occurred over Brocklesby, New South Wales, Australia. The accident was unusual {{in that the}} aircraft involved, two Avro Ansons of No.2 Service Flying Training School RAAF, remained locked together after colliding, and then landed safely. The collision stopped the engines of the upper Anson, but those of the machine underneath continued to run, allowing the pair of aircraft to keep flying. Both navigators and <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>of</b> the lower Anson bailed out. <b>The</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>of</b> the upper Anson {{found that he was}} able to control the interlocked aircraft with his ailerons and flaps, and made an emergency landing in a nearby paddock. All four crewmen survived the incident, and the upper Anson was repaired and returned to flight service.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept for}} the Fuchikoma came from one climactic {{scene of the}} film: the battle between Motoko Kusanagi and the big spider-like tank in the museum of paleontology. Based on this tank design, mecha creators Shōji Kawamori and Atsushi Takeuchi made a smaller version, {{designed}} for one person, {{that would be used}} by the police. Thus, the player becomes <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>of</b> one of these combat machines.|$|E

5|$|Animal House {{inspired}} Co-Ed Fever, another sitcom {{but without}} {{the involvement of the}} film's producers or cast. Set in a dorm of the formerly all-female Baxter College, <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>of</b> Co-Ed Fever was aired by CBS on February 4, 1979, but the network canceled the series before airing any more episodes. NBC also had its Animal House-inspired sitcom, Brothers and Sisters, in which three members of Crandall College's Pi Nu fraternity interact with members of the Gamma Iota sorority. Like ABC's Delta House, Brothers and Sisters lasted only three months.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} opening ceremony, United States {{broadcaster}} NBC was criticised for its coverage, as omitting performers less-known in the US. John Clarke, writing for Forbes, said it was wrong not to air performances from Ray Davies and Muse, as well as delaying the performance from The Who by an hour to broadcast <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>of</b> the sitcom Animal Practice followed by the late local news. While in New Zealand, Prime TV were also criticised for delayed coverage, running 20 minutes behind Sky Sport. In the Philippines, TV5 was also criticised because it only aired the first hour of coverage of the ceremony and highlights were incorporated into its morning news programme, Good Morning Club.|$|E

5|$|Barry Took, who had {{produced}} {{a series of}} ultimately unsuccessful documentaries for the BBC about working men's clubs, was partially responsible for the choice of location for the exterior shots. The programme which drew the highest ratings of the series focused on Burnlee Working Men's Club, a club in the small West Yorkshire town of Holmfirth and Took saw Holmfirth's potential as the backdrop of a television show. Took's idea was passed to James Gilbert and Roy Clarke via Duncan Wood, who {{was at that time}} filming Comedy Playhouse. Gilbert and Clarke then travelled to Holmfirth and decided to use it as the setting for <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>of</b> Last of the Summer Wine.|$|E

Since the deaths of these early aviation pioneers, the scale of fatal aircraft accidents has increased in proportion to the size and capacity of airplanes.|$|E

5|$|Forest Hill {{was a new}} air base, {{and roads}} and {{buildings}} were still under construction when its first course of flying training commenced with Avro Ansons on 29July 1940. One of the Ansons crashed in August, killing its instructor and a student. Later that month the second flying course began, on CAC Wirraways. The school was then reorganised into Initial and Advanced Squadrons. On 29September, two Ansons collided in mid-air and became locked together. Both navigators bailed out, to be followed shortly afterwards by the injured pilot of the lower aircraft. <b>The</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>of</b> the upper Anson, however, {{found that he was}} able to control the interlocked aircraft using his ailerons and flaps, coupled with the engine power of the Anson underneath.
