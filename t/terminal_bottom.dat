40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{notion of}} UNIT-to-UNIT inter-action is {{introduced}} to analyse dependency relations between {{words in a}} sentence. A UNIT is a basic framework for concept representation and is composed of many slots. After generating a parsed tree from an input sentence, our se-mantic interpretation begins traversing. the tree {{from right to left}} to discern the case frame in a stage as early as possible, since Japanese is a language in which verb is in the sentence-final and has a case frame. UNIT-to-UNIT inter-action, which is performed at each node of the parsed tree, follows a bottom-up progression. There are UNIT descriptions at <b>terminal</b> (<b>bottom)</b> nodes and the UNIT descriptions are modified o...|$|E

50|$|In Canada, the {{visibility}} and altitude requirements {{are similar to}} those in the U.S., but most controlled airspace outside of <b>terminal</b> areas <b>bottoms</b> out at 2200 ft AGL, so there is more room to scud run legally. In northern Canada, there is little controlled airspace at all, below the high-level class A airspace.|$|R

It could, however, be treated as an unbalanced 3-port by splitting one of the terminals into three common terminals shared between the ports.|$|R
5000|$|While {{the exact}} opening date is not known, {{the ski area}} was in {{operation}} {{by the end of}} the 1940s, serviced by surface lifts. In 1963 New Hampshire's second gondola lift was installed at Mt. Whittier. The gondola was unusual in that it had three <b>terminals</b> - a <b>bottom</b> <b>terminal</b> on the east side of [...] Route 16, a second lower terminal at the base of the ski area, and a top terminal near the summit of Nickerson Mountain. The remains of the gondola, including the towers and cables, still cross Route 16 today.|$|R
2500|$|The {{plug and}} {{socket-outlet}} system defined in BS1363 {{is a result of}} one of the report's recommendations. [...] Britain had previously used a combination of 2A, 5A and 15A round pin sockets. [...] In an appendix to the main report (July 1944), the committee proposed that a completely new socket-outlet and fused plug should be adopted as the [...] "all-purpose" [...] domestic standard. [...] The main report listed 8 points to consider in deciding the design of the new standard. The first of these was stated as “To ensure the safety of young children it is of considerable importance that the contacts of the socket-outlet should be protected by shutters or other like means, or by the inherent design of the socket-outlet.” [...] Others included flush fitting, no need for a switch, requirements for <b>terminals,</b> <b>bottom</b> entry for the cable, and contact design. [...] The appendix added 5 further [...] "points of technical detail" [...] including requirements that plugs could not be inserted incorrectly, should be easy to withdraw, and should include a fuse.|$|R

50|$|The La Fave Block {{is located}} on the intersection's {{southwest}} corner. Its official address is 405 S. Hunter. It is in the developed area of downtown Aspen a block north of the gondola's <b>bottom</b> <b>terminal</b> across East Durant Avenue and a block west of the pedestrian mall along East Cooper between South Mill and South Galena streets. An alley connects South Galena and South Hunter just south of the block.|$|R
50|$|The R16s, {{like the}} older Arnines, R10s, and R11s, {{featured}} {{three sets of}} mid-carbody passenger windows on each side. One set contained an illuminated rollsign box {{in lieu of a}} second window. This sign box had three readings arranged vertically - the top two being the train's <b>terminals,</b> and the <b>bottom</b> being the route. This window and signbox pattern became standard for later cars until the R40s. The R16 would also be the last car class delivered with cross wise seating until the R44 order in 1972.|$|R
50|$|For the 2013-2014 season, Doppelmayr built two new chairlifts. At Golden Peak base area, the resort's last {{remaining}} double chairlift, Gopher Hill (#12), {{was replaced with}} a recycled Doppelmayr triple chairlift purchased from Beaver Creek. The upgrade to Gopher Hill increased uphill capacity for the ski and ride school, especially for three- to six-year-old skiers and riders who must ride the lift with an adult. The <b>bottom</b> <b>terminal</b> was slightly moved from the original location. More significantly, the Mountaintop Express (#4) lift was upgraded to a high speed six pack. It was the first new Doppelmayr detachable chairlift to be built at Vail since the Avanti Express lift in 1989. It increased uphill capacity on the lift line by 33% from 2,800 people per hour to 3,600 people per hour, matching the uphill capacity of Gondola One. The new lift follows a slightly different alignment from the old lift, with the <b>bottom</b> <b>terminal</b> being moved 90 feet east of its original location to decrease cross-traffic in the area. The Mountaintop Express was the first detachable chairlift in North America to utilize a conveyor belt at the loading area, {{a system that is}} widely utilized at European ski resorts, shown to cut down on stops and slows, shortening the ride time (since the Mountaintop Express lift, almost every new six pack built at Vail Resorts properties has included a loading carpet, including the Colorado SuperChair at Breckenridge, the King Con Express at Park City Mountain Resort, and Vail's own Avanti Express lift).|$|R
50|$|The R17, {{like many}} older New York City Subway cars {{built for the}} A Division, also {{features}} two sets of mid-carbody passenger windows on each side. Normally arranged in two pairs of three on the R15, on the R17 one set of windows on each side contains a rollsign {{in lieu of a}} third window. The sign contains three readings arranged vertically on its box - the top two being the train's <b>terminals,</b> and the <b>bottom</b> being the train's route. This window and signbox pattern, first appearing on the R16 became the blueprint for the later R21 and R22, the Redbirds, and even influenced the design of trains still in service today. The R32 fleet uses a similar rollsign design to that first found on the R16.|$|R
40|$|The β roll {{molecules}} with sequence (GAGAGAGQ) 10 stack via hydrogen bonding to form fibrils {{which have}} been themselves been used to make viral capsids of DNA strands, supramolecular nanotapes and pH-responsive gels. Accelerated molecular dynamics (aMD) simulations are used to investigate the unfolding of a stack of two β roll molecules, (GAGAGAGQ) 10, {{to shed light on}} the folding mechanism by which silk-inspired polypeptides form fibrils and to identify the dominant forces that keep the silk-inspired polypeptide in a β roll configuration. Our study shows that a molecule in a stack of two β roll molecules unfolds in a step-wise fashion mainly from the C <b>terminal.</b> The <b>bottom</b> template is found {{to play an important role}} in stabilizing the β roll structure of the molecule on top by strengthening the hydrogen bonds in the layer that it contacts. Vertical hydrogen bonds within the β roll structure are considerably weaker than lateral hydrogen bonds, signifying the importance of lateral hydrogen bonds in stabilizing the β roll structure. Finally, an intermediate structure was found containing a β hairpin and an anti-parallel β sheet consisting of strands from the top and bottom molecules, revealing the self-healing ability of the β roll stack...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{our recent}} work in implementing a word-spotting {{system based on}} the ANGIE framework {{and the effects of}} varying the nature of the sublexical constraints placed upon the wordspotter 's filler model. ANGIE is a framework for modelling speech where the morphological and phonological substructures of words are jointly characterized by a context-free grammar and are represented in a multi-layered hierarchical structure. In this representation, the upper layers capture syllabification, morphology, and stress, the preterminal layer represents phonemics, and the <b>bottom</b> <b>terminal</b> categories are the phones. ANGIE provides a flexible framework where we can explore the effects of sublexical constraints within a word-spotting environment. Our experiments with spotting city names in ATIS validate the intuition that increasing the constraints present in the model improves performance, from 85. 3 FOM for phone bigram to 89. 3 FOM for a word lexicon. They also empirically strengthens our belief [...] ...|$|R
50|$|In 1998, Ten Mile Station {{opened at}} the bottom of the Falcon SuperChair, {{replacing}} the Falcon's Aerie restaurant at the top of Peak 10. The following year, the original Quicksilver SuperChair was replaced with Quicksilver Super6, a high speed six pack. The original quad was relocated to Owl's Head resort in Quebec, where it still operates. Quicksilver Super6 runs from the Village base area up the Silverthorne trail (to the south of Lift A) and ends at Ten Mile Station. It also carries the unique distinction of being North America's first and only double-loading chairlift. The <b>bottom</b> <b>terminal</b> of the lift has two separate loading areas, with an automated switch piece of railing being utilized to direct every other chair to the second loading station. Coinciding with this was the addition of a midway unload station on Lift A near where it passes the top of Quicksilver Super6, allowing skier traffic to bail out early for access to Ten Mile Station.|$|R
50|$|In 2008, Breckenridge began {{developing}} Peak 8 and Peak 7, {{intending to}} make Peak 8 the mountain's central hub. This was noticeable in that beginning in 2008, the mountain started opening with Peak 8 first before opening Peak 9 {{in the early}} season. From 2008 to 2010, One Ski Hill Place was constructed at Peak 8 base, in between Lift 5 and Lift 7, on {{what used to be}} a parking lot, and opened to the public in 2010. The lodge has a new food court facility and a cocktail lounge known as the T-Bar (not to be confused with the T-Bar servicing Horseshoe Bowl). Also in 2008, a new base area opened on Peak 7 at the BreckConnect Gondola's second midstation. Two lodges, the Crystal Peak Lodge and Grand Lodge on Peak 7, anchor the base area. As part of construction, the Independence SuperChair was extended downhill, its <b>bottom</b> <b>terminal</b> now located between Crystal Peak Lodge and Grand Lodge's south building and Ski Hill Road immediately north of Peak 8 base was rerouted.|$|R
50|$|Rafferty ran the Snow King ski {{operation}} on his own, {{as a part-time}} job, from 1939 until 1946. That year a new corporation, the Jackson Hole Winter Sports Association, was formed with its immediate purpose being {{to take advantage of}} the post-war boom in the ski industry nationwide by installing a chairlift to the top of Snow King. The association raised $40,000 from local investors, bought an old tramway which had been used in a gold mining operation in Colorado near Salida, and hired a Denver contractor to construct a lift from it. Included in the purchase were structural beams for the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>terminals,</b> bullwheels, cables, towers, and carriers. The ore buckets that originally hung from the carriers were replaced with single chairs. The lift was installed in 1946-1947 and was an instant sensation, carrying 200 chairs per hour; in its first full year of operation more than 8,500 rode the lift to the top of the mountain. Rafferty was hired as the association’s full-time director, and continued to manage the ski operations until his retirement in 1974.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to Peak 7, {{a new high}} speed quad was built to connect Peak 9 to Peak 8. The Peak 8 SuperConnect replaced the aging Lift 4 and improved navigation between the two peaks (prior to 2002, transitioning from Peak 9 to Peak 8 required going {{to the top of}} Peak 9 and taking a black trail called Shock or a blue run called Union to the bottom of Lift 4). It originates on Peak 9 at the junction of the trails Red Rover and Sundown (just down a hill from Lift A), crosses over the Beaver Run SuperChair and Lift C, runs to a midway load and turn station at Lift 4's loading station, then runs up Lift 4's line to end near the Vista Haus. To guarantee that chairs are available for people using the mid-station, a system of automatic loading gates was introduced. These gates open when the chairs are turning into the loading area and activate a sensor. The gates are programmed to send select chairs through the <b>bottom</b> <b>terminal</b> empty, to be filled by people loading at the midstation.|$|R
50|$|Key {{features}} of Baskerville are its E where the bottom arm projects {{further than the}} upper, a J with a ball <b>terminal</b> at the <b>bottom,</b> and where the loop rises {{to the top and}} right to join the main stem and a g where the bottom loop is open. Some fonts cut for Baskerville have an 'R' with a straight leg; in others it is curved. Many characters have clear ball terminals, in contrast to the more wedge-shaped serifs of earlier fonts. Most distinctive is the italic, in which the J has a centre-bar and many other italic capitals have flourishes, The 'p' has a tail pointing downwards and to the left (similar to the entrance stroke that would be made with a pen) and the w has a clear centre loop and swash on the left. In general, Baskerville's type has been described as 'rounder, more sharply cut' than its predecessors. (Some distinctive {{features of}} the capitals are discarded in many revivals, as seen below.) Baskerville's type featured text figures or lower-case numbers, the only form which was used at the time. The capitals are very bold, and (like Caslon's) have been criticised for being unbalanced to the lower-case at large sizes.|$|R
40|$|Abstract–A {{low power}} high {{performance}} Delta-Sigma modulator for portable measurement applications {{is presented in}} this paper. To reduce the power consumption and ensure high performance, a comprehensive system-level design adopting a new method to determine the DC gain value of Operational Transconductance Amplifier (OTA) and considering the effect of 1 /f noise is introduced. Besides, a novel power efficient current mirror Class-AB OTA with a fast-settling less-error switched-capacitor common-mode feedback (SC CMFB) circuit is proposed in this design. And the <b>bottom</b> <b>terminal</b> parasitic-effect of Poly-Insulator-Poly (PIP) capacitors is also considered. Therefore, about extra 20 % of the capacitance {{is added to the}} total capacitance load. In addition, an area-efficient power-efficient resonator is adopted to realize a coefficient of 1 / 90 for 50 % power and 75 % area cost reduction over the conventional design. The chip is implemented in a low cost standard 0. 35 μm CMOS. Its total power is only 20 μW at a 1. 5 V supply, and the measured Dynamic Range (DR) is 95 dB over the 1 kHz bandwidth. The designed modulator shows very high Figure-of-Merit (FOM) among the recent low power high performance modulators. Keywords–low power, high performance, Delta-Sigma modulator, switched capacitor circuits To reduce the cost of chip fabrication, this paper focuses on the design in a low cost 0. 35 μm CMOS. Through the comprehensive system-level design and the use of novel power efficient OTA and resonator, the proposed modulator in this paper can also achieve low power and high performance without needing an advanced or special process. Section II discusses the details of system-level design for low power high performance applications. A new method to determine the DC gain values of OTAs and the effect of 1 /f noise are introduced. Then, section III shows the main circuit building blocks design. A novel power efficient OTA and an area-efficient power-efficient small-coefficient resonator are adopted in this design.
