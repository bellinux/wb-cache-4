5|$|After {{a dispute}} over stolen goods turns violent, Sobotka's son Ziggy is charged {{with the murder of}} one of the Greek's underlings. Sobotka himself is arrested for smuggling; he agrees to work with <b>the</b> <b>detail</b> to help his son, finally seeing his actions as a mistake. However, the Greek learns about this through his mole inside the FBI and has Sobotka killed. The {{investigation}} ends with the fourteen homicides solved but the perpetrator already dead. Several drug dealers and mid-level smuggling figures tied to the Greek are arrested, but he and his second-in-command escape uncharged and unidentified. The Major is pleased that Sobotka was arrested; the case is seen as a success by the commanding officers, but is viewed as a failure by <b>the</b> <b>detail.</b>|$|E

40|$|Cataloguing is {{all about}} {{recording}} <b>the</b> <b>details</b> of an information artifact technically called work. It aims at recording <b>the</b> <b>details</b> accurately and comprehensively. The accuracy deals with the correctness or the perfection with which <b>the</b> <b>details</b> are entered, whereas comprehensiveness refers {{to the extent to}} which <b>the</b> <b>details</b> are provided in a catalogue record (Graham, 1990). Both these factors, exactness and extent, affects the eventual retrieval of the information resource. Hence, the cataloguers give paramount importance while creating the catalogue records. It is interesting to note that Sung (2013) has listed ten essential qualities expected of a cataloguer...|$|R
5|$|Despite this he {{had neither}} an office nor office staff, {{dealing with all}} the {{correspondence}} himself. Much of <b>the</b> <b>detail</b> of his works were held in his memory. He travelled with a personal valet and later had a cashier. But all his letters were written by him; it is recorded that on one occasion after {{the rest of his}} party had gone to bed, 31 letters had been written by Brassey overnight. Although he won a large number of contracts, his bids were not always successful. It has been calculated that for every contract awarded, around six others had been unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|During a rainy {{holiday in}} Hastings {{at the end}} of November 1903, Potter {{outlined}} a tale about a cat, a dog, and a tea party she called Something very very NICE. She discussed the Lakefield sketches as backgrounds for the tale with Warne. He proposed a large format volume similar to L. Leslie Brooke's Johnny Crow's Garden to do justice to <b>the</b> <b>detail</b> of the illustrations, but the entire project was set aside when The Tale of Benjamin Bunny and The Tale of Two Bad Mice were chosen for development and publication in 1904.|$|E
5|$|During {{this time}} the church at Llanbadarn Fawr {{gradually}} declined, as the population of Aberystwyth dramatically outgrew the original settlement, {{and more and more}} chapels of ease became independent parish churches. By the mid-nineteenth century the fabric of the church had also deteriorated {{to such an extent that}} serious remedial work was deemed necessary. Unfortunately, although necessary, this work also swept away much of <b>the</b> <b>detail</b> of the interior of the church. Today, apart from the Celtic crosses and the baptismal font there is nothing mediaeval or even early modern; most of what is visible today is nineteenth century, apart from the structure of the church, and some earlier monuments.|$|E

5|$|One {{security}} conscious commenter on the Engadget {{consumer electronics}} blog addressed the privacy {{implications of the}} oversize bills given the limitations of personal paper shredders, by speculating on {{whether it would be}} more practical to dispose of these large bills by burning them to protect personal information. An editor for the libertarian monthly Reason also speculated about the usefulness of the detailed information to government investigators. The original Ars Technica blog posting, on the other hand, dismissed privacy concerns, showing that <b>the</b> <b>detail</b> pages do not contain sensitive information.|$|E
5|$|Phelan {{reacts to}} McNulty's report by {{complaining}} to senior Police Department figures, embarrassing them into creating a detail dedicated to investigating Barksdale. However, {{owing to the}} department's dysfunction, the investigation is intended as a façade to appease the judge. An intradepartmental struggle between the more motivated officers on <b>the</b> <b>detail</b> and their superiors spans the whole season, with interference by the higher-ups often threatening to ruin the investigation. The detail's commander, Cedric Daniels, acts as mediator between the two opposing groups of police.|$|E
5|$|Potter's weariness with {{depicting}} rabbits {{is reflected}} in the book's pictures. Of the twenty-six illustrations, eight depict Mr. McGregor and seventeen the garden and its structures. There are almost no close-ups of the rabbits and none with <b>the</b> <b>detail</b> found in Benjamin Bunny. When the rabbits are depicted, they are viewed in the middle distance in order to include all six as well as the garden background. They are depicted with little or no facial expression. It is likely Potter (a farm owner at the date of the book's composition) had come to view rabbits as undifferentiated pests rather than individual personalities. Several drawings for the illustrations for The Flopsy Bunnies were given to the British Museum in 1946.|$|E

5|$|The figures, the {{minutely}} detailed clothes, and {{the architecture}} of the room and windows are depicted {{with a high degree of}} realism. Van Eyck's mastery at handling oil can be seen in the differing breadths of brush strokes. The precision of <b>the</b> <b>detail</b> achieved is especially noticeable in the rendering of threads of St. Donatian's blue and golden embroidered cope and mitre, in the weave of the oriental carpet, and in the stubble and veins on van der Paele's aging face.|$|E
5|$|The {{first draft}} {{and part of}} the editing process was {{completed}} before Fleming's death and the manuscript had passed through the hands of his copy editor, William Plomer, but it was not as polished as other Bond stories. Much of <b>the</b> <b>detail</b> contained in the previous novels was missing, as this was often added by Fleming in the second draft. Publishers Jonathan Cape passed the manuscript to Kingsley Amis for his thoughts and advice on the story, although his suggestions were not subsequently used.|$|E

5|$|The {{resulting}} skyscrapers reflected these debates: the Railway Exchange, the Peoples Gas and the Illinois Continental and Commercial Bank Buildings {{were each}} substantial, quarter-block wide palazzo cubes of common height, their facades divided into a classical tripartite design, and sporting classical columns and other features. Despite the apparent uniformity of design, individual buildings varied considerably in <b>the</b> <b>detail</b> {{of their designs}} in effort to express their particular identities, the Peoples Gas Building using texture and the Railway Exchange Building white terracotta, for example.|$|E
5|$|These {{investigators}} were overseen by two commanding officers {{more concerned with}} politics and their own careers than the case, Deputy Commissioner Ervin Burrell (Frankie Faison) and Major William Rawls (John Doman). Assistant state's attorney Rhonda Pearlman (Deirdre Lovejoy) acted as the legal liaison between <b>the</b> <b>detail</b> and the courthouse and also had {{a sexual relationship with}} McNulty. In the homicide division, Bunk Moreland (Wendell Pierce) was a gifted, dry-witted, hard-drinking detective partnered with McNulty under Sergeant Jay Landsman (Delaney Williams), the sarcastic, sharp-tongued squad supervisor. Peter Gerety had a recurring role as Judge Phelan, the official who started the case moving.|$|E
5|$|When Wright {{designed}} the Heller House in 1896, it marked his {{move away from}} styles that were popular into an era of geometric and highly modern designs. Wright's design exhibits the influence of Wright's mentor, Louis Sullivan, and demonstrates Wright's move towards Prairie School homes which would epitomize much of his early work. Sullivan's influence {{can also be seen}} in the floral pattern of the Richard Bock plaster frieze on the home's third floor, although during the 1970s, restoration work—which utilized sandblasting—destroyed much of <b>the</b> <b>detail</b> on the frieze.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIt {{is known}} that surface {{texturing}} improves the tribological properties under hydrodynamic lubrication. Generally, {{it is said that}} the effect of surface texturing under hydrodynamic lubrication is due to the hydrodynamic pressure. It is considered that the occurrence of the hydrodynamic pressure is related to <b>the</b> <b>details</b> of <b>the</b> lubricant flow. However, experimental approach to observe <b>the</b> <b>details</b> of <b>the</b> lubricant flow and <b>the</b> <b>details</b> discussion about <b>the</b> lubricant flow on textured surface are insufficient. In this study, we investigated the lubricant flow on the textured surface under hydrodynamic lubrication by in-situ observation.
