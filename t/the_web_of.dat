40|$|Three-point flexure {{tests on}} <b>the</b> <b>webs</b> <b>of</b> 12 {{pultruded}} Glass Reinforced Plastic (GRP) Wide Flange (WF) specimens are described. <b>The</b> <b>webs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> specimens were tested with their ends either simply or semi-rigidly supported. Dual knife-edge fixtures and rigid steel supports were designed and fabricated to simulate these support conditions. A series of low load tests {{were carried out}} on <b>the</b> <b>webs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> WF specimens for both types of end conditions and deflections and strains were recorded at mid-span. Using simple beam analysis models {{in conjunction with the}} test data, both the transverse elastic modulus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>web</b> and <b>the</b> rotational stiffness per unit length of the web-flange junctions of each specimen were determined. <b>The</b> <b>webs</b> <b>of</b> five <b>of</b> <b>the</b> specimens were failed under simply supported end conditions and the remaining seven under semi-rigid end conditions. From these failure tests the initial failure strengths of the web-flange junctions and the ultimate bending strengths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>webs</b> were determined. <b>The</b> failure loads and modes of failure for both sets of end conditions have also been quantified...|$|R

5|$|Both serials were {{promptly}} {{released on}} iTunes, with DVD releases following {{over the next}} few months. Both on the iTunes and the DVD release, episode 3 of <b>The</b> <b>Web</b> <b>of</b> Fear was represented by a tele-snap reconstruction, edited by John Kelly. Episode 3 {{had been part of the}} same find, but by the end of protracted negotiations for the return of the film cans, the episode had disappeared from the cache, with the presumption that it was sold to a private collector.|$|E
5|$|Following {{months of}} rumours, in October 2013 a BBC press conference {{announced}} {{the return of}} 11 episodes (two of which previously existing) from a television relay station {{in the city of}} Jos, Nigeria. In the course of his work abroad, Philip Morris of Television International Enterprises Archives had discovered episodes 1-6 of The Enemy of the World and episodes 1-6 of <b>The</b> <b>Web</b> <b>of</b> Fear. and returned 11 of these to the BBC. The return of the nine missing episodes was the single largest recovery of Doctor Who episodes in 25 years, resulting in only the second full serial from Troughton's first two seasons to be restored to the BBC.|$|E
5|$|Following the purges and {{subsequent}} recoveries, {{gaps in the}} Doctor Who archive are spread unevenly through its first eleven seasons. Major losses mostly affect First and Second Doctor serials; although two stories are missing just one episode each (The Tenth Planet, Episode 4 and <b>The</b> <b>Web</b> <b>of</b> Fear Episode 3), other stories are lost altogether. Patrick Troughton's era as the Second Doctor is particularly affected; of the fourteen stories comprising his first two seasons, only The Tomb of the Cybermen and The Enemy of the World are complete, and these only exist due to telerecordings later returned from Hong Kong and Nigeria, respectively.|$|E

5|$|There was broad {{agreement}} between Taft and Knox on major foreign policy goals; the U.S. would not interfere in European affairs, and would use force {{if necessary to}} enforce the Monroe Doctrine in the Americas. The defense of the Panama Canal, which was under construction throughout Taft's term (it opened in 1914), guided United States {{foreign policy in the}} Caribbean and Central America. Previous administrations had made efforts to promote American business interests overseas, but Taft went a step further and used <b>the</b> <b>web</b> <b>of</b> American diplomats and consuls abroad to further trade. Such ties, Taft hoped, would promote world peace. Taft pushed for arbitration treaties with Great Britain and France, but the Senate was not willing to yield its constitutional prerogative to approve treaties to arbitrators.|$|E
5|$|The 1066 Norman conquest {{brought a}} new set of Norman and French churchmen to power; some adopted and embraced aspects of the former Anglo-Saxon {{religious}} system, while others introduced practices from Normandy. Extensive English lands were granted to monasteries in Normandy, allowing them to create daughter priories and monastic cells across the kingdom. The monasteries were brought firmly into <b>the</b> <b>web</b> <b>of</b> feudal relations, with their holding of land linked to the provision of military support to the crown. The Normans adopted the Anglo-Saxon model of monastic cathedral communities, and within seventy years the majority of English cathedrals were controlled by monks; every English cathedral, however, was rebuilt to some extent by the new rulers. England's bishops remained powerful temporal figures, and in the early 12th-century raised armies against Scottish invaders and built up extensive holdings of castles across the country.|$|E

2500|$|Double-tailed tent spiders usually {{build their}} <b>webs</b> in {{branches}} <b>of</b> trees or shrubs, using surrounding leaves and twigs as a framework. <b>The</b> <b>webs</b> are composed <b>of</b> two distinct parts.

It serves to discourage prey from entering from <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>web</b> complex. At <b>the</b> bottom is a horizontally-oriented, exceptionally finely-meshed <b>web</b> (<b>the</b> 'orb web') about [...] in diameter.
