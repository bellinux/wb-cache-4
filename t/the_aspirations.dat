5|$|Separatist {{movements}} {{also exist}} {{in two other}} former princely states located in Northeast India—Tripura and Manipur. These separatist movements are generally treated by scholars as {{being part of the}} broader problem of insurgencies in North-east India, rather being a result of specific problems in integrating the princely states into India, as the Kashmir problem is and, in particular, to reflect the failure of the Government of India to adequately address <b>the</b> <b>aspirations</b> of tribal groups in the Northeast, or to tackle the tensions arising from the immigration of people from other parts of India to the north-eastern areas.|$|E
5|$|Haywood {{observed}} {{how the government}} frequently took the side of business to defeat the tactics and <b>the</b> <b>aspirations</b> of the miners. During an 1899 organizing drive in Coeur d'Alene, with pay cuts as a motivating issue, the company hired spies and then fired organizers and pro-union miners. Some frustrated miners responded with violence and when two men were killed, martial law was declared. As they had done in a strike in Coeur d'Alene seven years earlier, soldiers acted as strike breakers. They rounded up hundreds of union members without formal charges {{and put them in}} a filthy, vermin-infested warehouse without sanitation services for a year. They were so crowded that the soldiers locked the overflow of prisoners in boxcars. One local union leader was imprisoned for 17 years.|$|E

40|$|It is {{important}} to thoroughly remove the thrombus within <b>the</b> course of <b>aspiration</b> thrombectomy; otherwise, it may lead to further embolization. The performance of <b>the</b> <b>aspiration</b> thrombectomy device with a generic geometry is studied through the computational approach. In order to model <b>the</b> thrombus <b>aspiration,</b> a real left coronary artery is chosen while thrombi with various sizes are located at the bifurcation area of the coronary artery and, {{depending on the size}} of the thrombus, it is stretched toward the side branches. The thrombus occupies the artery resembling the blood current obstruction in the coronary vessel similar to the situation that leads to heart attack. It is concluded that <b>the</b> <b>aspiration</b> ability of <b>the</b> thrombectomy device is not linked to the thrombus size; it is rather linked to <b>the</b> <b>aspiration</b> pressure and thrombus age (organized versus fresh thrombus). However, <b>the</b> <b>aspiration</b> time period correlates to the thrombus size. <b>The</b> minimum applicable <b>aspiration</b> pressure is also investigated in this study...|$|R

5|$|The {{government}} had promulgated the Powers of Nomad Shiekhs Ordinance in 1922, and had recognized and reinforced the judicial powers of over 300 tribal leaders by 1923. They had ignored <b>the</b> <b>aspirations</b> of educated Sudanese in government employment {{to take a}} greater role in administration. The principle of indirect rule had also given the Sayyids, including Abd al-Rahman, more power to prevent changes demanded by the secular opposition. In a shift of policy, the Graduates' General Congress was launched in 1938 as a forum for the intelligentsia of Sudan to express their opinions and as an alternative voice to that of the tribal leaders, who had become discredited.|$|E
5|$|Belgrano {{was born}} in Buenos Aires, the fourth child of Italian {{businessman}} Domingo Belgrano y Peri and Josefa Casero. He {{came into contact with}} the ideas of the Age of Enlightenment while at university in Spain {{around the time of the}} French Revolution. Upon his return to the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, where he became a notable member of the criollo population of Buenos Aires, he tried to promote some of the new political and economic ideals, but found severe resistance from local peninsulars. This rejection led him to work towards a greater autonomy for his country from the Spanish colonial regime. At first, he unsuccessfully promoted <b>the</b> <b>aspirations</b> of Carlota Joaquina to become a regent ruler for the Viceroyalty during the period the Spanish King Ferdinand VII was imprisoned during the Peninsular War (1807–1814). He favoured the May Revolution, which removed the viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros from power on 25 May 1810. He was elected as a voting member of the Primera Junta that took power after the ouster.|$|E
5|$|On Schröter's {{death in}} 1782, Horn {{decided to move}} to Paris to try a living as a musician. He left his home with little money and a {{suitcase}} of clothes. En route to Paris, he encountered a stranger in Hamburg by the name of Winkelman, who persuaded the impressionable Horn that London would better serve <b>the</b> <b>aspirations</b> of a young German musician than France. Winkelman accompanied him to London, but upon arriving, stole almost all of Horn's money and disappeared. Destitute and knowing no English, he wandered the streets of London before encountering a German-speaking Irishman, who sympathised with his plight. The man took Horn to the piano shop of Longman and Broderip at Cheapside, where Horn played the piano for its co-proprietor, Francis Fane Broderip. Impressed, Broderip introduced Horn to the Saxon ambassador John Maurice de Brühl. de Brühl recommended Horn to Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Marquess of Stafford, who hired him as his daughters' music teacher.|$|E

40|$|When {{pursuing}} multiple goals over time, {{the amount}} of time (i. e., resources) available affects which goal is pursued: people prioritize (i. e., spend time on) the goal furthest from <b>the</b> <b>aspiration</b> level when there is plenty of time available to attain <b>the</b> <b>aspiration</b> level on <b>the</b> multiple goals but switch to prioritize the goal closest to <b>the</b> <b>aspiration</b> level when <b>the</b> time available starts to run out (e. g., Schmidt, Dolis, 2 ̆ 6 Tolli, 2009). Although <b>the</b> <b>aspiration</b> level is <b>the</b> most commonly examined goal level, other goal levels possessing different psychological meanings (e. g., minimally acceptable or status quo goal levels) also exist. I examined the effect of multiple goal levels (i. e., the minimally acceptable level and <b>the</b> <b>aspiration</b> level) on goal prioritization decisions. I hypothesized that when people were provided with both the minimally acceptable level and <b>the</b> <b>aspiration</b> level, they would prioritize attaining the minimally acceptable level over <b>the</b> <b>aspiration</b> level. Participants (N= 316) engaged in a fully within-persons decision-making task where they repeatedly decided which of two goals to allocate their time to. The amount of time available for allocation was systematically varied. Results indicated that people first strived for the minimally acceptable level on one goal. When they attained the minimally acceptable level on that goal, they switched to striving for the minimally acceptable level on the second goal. Only when people attained the minimally acceptable levels for both goals did they strive for <b>the</b> <b>aspiration</b> level (on one of the goals). The only exception is when they had insufficient time to attain both minimally acceptable goal levels; in that case, they focused only on one goal and strived for <b>the</b> <b>aspiration</b> level on that goal. Results imply that when choosing which goal to prioritize, people consider multiple goal levels. Implications of multiple goal levels for goal pursuit, goal revision, and theories of motivation are discussed...|$|R
