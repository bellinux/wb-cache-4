5|$|On 31 October 2009, in a {{game against}} the Sacramento Kings, a bat descended onto the court at the AT Center, causing a {{stoppage}} of play. As the bat flew past, Ginóbili swatted the bat to the ground with his hand. He then carried the creature off the court, earning <b>the</b> <b>applause</b> of the crowd. On 9 April 2010, the Spurs and Ginóbili agreed to a three-year, $39 million contract extension through the 2012–13 season.|$|E
5|$|Bradman {{thought his}} faster bowlers could not extract much bounce {{from the surface}} and soon removed the short leg fielder, and pursued a 63 {{off-side}} field with three slips and a deep point, trying to encourage the English openers {{to cut through the}} vacant area between the slips and extra cover. However, they declined Bradman's incentive and decided to bat in a low-risk manner, favouring straight-batted shots. After 80 minutes of batting, England's openers reached 50, the first time they had put on a half-century in the series. Hutton and Washbrook appeared set for the long haul, and did not react to <b>the</b> <b>applause.</b> They continued on cautiously, and persisted in eschewing the cross-batted cut and pull shots and relying on the safe accumulation of singles.|$|E
5|$|In September 1960, Castro flew to New York City for the General Assembly of the United Nations. Staying at the Hotel Theresa in Harlem, he {{met with}} journalists and anti-establishment figures like Malcolm X. He also met Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, with the two {{publicly}} condemning the poverty and racism faced by Americans in areas like Harlem. Relations between Castro and Khrushchev were warm; they led <b>the</b> <b>applause</b> to one another's speeches at the General Assembly. Subsequently, visited by Polish First Secretary Władysław Gomułka, Bulgarian Chairman Todor Zhivkov, Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser and Indian Premier Jawaharlal Nehru, Castro also received an evening's reception from the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.|$|E

5|$|Thaïs (1894), {{composed}} for Sanderson, was moderately received. Like Werther, it did {{not gain}} widespread popularity among French opera-goers until its first revival, which was {{four years after the}} premiere, by when the composer's association with Sanderson was over. In the same year he had a modest success in Paris with the one-act Le portrait de Manon at the Opéra-Comique, and a much greater one in London with La Navarraise at Covent Garden. The Times commented that in this piece Massenet had adopted the verismo style of such works as Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana to great effect. The audience clamoured for the composer to acknowledge <b>the</b> <b>applause,</b> but Massenet, always a shy man, declined to take even a single curtain call.|$|E
5|$|The first {{performance}} of Falstaff was at La Scala in Milan on 9 February 1893, nearly {{six years after}} Verdi's previous premiere. For the first night, official ticket prices were thirty times greater than usual. Royalty, aristocracy, critics and leading figures from the arts all over Europe were present. The performance was a huge success under the baton of Edoardo Mascheroni; numbers were encored, {{and at the end}} <b>the</b> <b>applause</b> for Verdi and the cast lasted an hour. That was followed by a tumultuous welcome when the composer, his wife and Boito arrived at the Grand Hotel de Milan.|$|E

Even more hectic scenes ensued when he went to Rome in May for the opera's premiere at the Teatro Costanzi, when crowds of well-wishers at the railway station initially forced Verdi to take refuge in a tool-shed. He witnessed the performance from the Royal Box at the side of King Umberto and the Queen.|$|E
60|$|But {{although}} the lists rang with <b>the</b> <b>applauses</b> of his dexterity, {{it was evident}} that he must at last be overpowered; and the nobles around Prince John implored him with one voice to throw down his warder, and to save so brave a knight from the disgrace of being overcome by odds.|$|R

25|$|The Royal Academy of Music, in {{recognition}} of a lifetime of contribution {{to the field of}} early music, awarded Pallis an Honorary Fellowship. At age eighty-nine his Nocturne de l’Ephemere was performed at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London; his niece writes that “he was able to go on stage to accept <b>the</b> <b>applause</b> which he did with his customary modesty.” When he died he left unfinished an opera based on the life of Milarepa.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>applause,</b> {{by which}} the orator had been {{frequently}} interrupted, at this point became so vociferous and long continued {{that it was impossible}} for him to proceed.

For a couple of weeks thereafter, Cline appeared regularly on Godfrey's radio program. Disagreements over creative control caused Godfrey to fire her.|$|E
25|$|During {{that time}} he {{remained}} busy, spending some time with Turina (who was ill for part of it), visiting the conservatory and meeting {{with many of the}} students and his old teacher, Zingarelli (to whom he had dedicated Norma), and attending a performance of Capuleti at the San Carlo with Turina and Florimo on 5 February in the presence of King Ferdinand II. The King led <b>the</b> <b>applause</b> for the composer, resulting in his being called to the stage and thus enjoying a very warm welcome from the people of Naples.|$|E
25|$|For all this, Roose's {{popularity}} as a goalkeeper {{was based}} only {{in part on}} his abilities; he {{was also one of}} the great crowd-pleasers of the Edwardian period. Supporters recall him putting on gymnastic displays from his crossbar when play was safely at the other end of the pitch. At a time when other goalkeepers walked onto the pitch at the beginning of a game, Roose was also unusual in running on briskly, acknowledging <b>the</b> <b>applause</b> of the crowd.

25|$|In June 2009, Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, an abolitionist, {{was elected}} President of Mongolia. He began using his {{prerogative}} of pardon {{to prevent the}} application of the death penalty. On January 14, 2010, he announced that he would henceforth use his prerogative to pardon all persons sentenced to death. He stated that most countries in the world had abolished the death penalty, and that Mongolia should follow their example; he suggested that it be replaced with a 30-year prison sentence. The decision was controversial; when Elbegdorj announced it in Parliament, a significant number of represesentatives chose not to give <b>the</b> <b>applause</b> customarily due after a presidential speech.|$|E
25|$|State of the Union speeches usually last {{a little}} over an hour, {{partly because of the}} large amounts of applause that occur from the {{audience}} throughout. <b>The</b> <b>applause</b> is often political in tone, with many portions of the speech being applauded only by members of the President's own party. As non-political officeholders, members of the Supreme Court or the Joint Chiefs of Staff rarely applaud in order to retain the appearance of political impartiality. In recent years, the presiding officers of the House and the Senate, the Speaker and the Vice President, respectively, have departed from the neutrality expected of presiding officers of deliberative bodies, as they, too, stand and applaud in response to the remarks of the President with which they agree.|$|E
25|$|But if he {{was eager}} in his own defence he was no less so in that of others. In 1721 a drunken nobleman reeled on to {{the stage of the}} theatre and {{assaulted}} the manager, Rich, whose life was saved by Quin's prompt armed interference. This resulted in a riot, and thereafter a guard was stationed in all theatres. In 1732 Quin appeared at Covent Garden, returning to Drury Lane from 1734 to 1741, and in 1742 was again at Covent Garden, where he remained until the close of his career. On 14 November 1746 Quin played Horatio and Garrick Lothario to the Calista of Mrs Cibber in Rose's Fair Penitent. <b>The</b> <b>applause</b> of the audience was so great as to disconcert if not actually to alarm the two actors.|$|E

25|$|Thaksin {{initiated}} two key healthcare policies: subsidised {{universal health}} care and low-cost universal access to anti-retroviral HIV medication (ARVs). Thaksin's 30-baht/visit universal healthcare program won <b>the</b> <b>applause</b> of the general public, but was criticised by many doctors and officials. Prior to the program's introduction, {{a large portion of}} the population had no health insurance and only limited access to healthcare. The program helped increase access to healthcare from 76% of the population to 96%. The program also increased workloads for health care employees, and caused many doctors to change to higher paying careers. It has also been criticised for being underfunded by the government. The program caused some hospitals to seek alternative sources of income, leading to a boom in medical tourism, with 1.3million foreign patients earning Thailand THB33billion (US$800million) in 2005.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, Mosby was unhappy, {{despite the}} electoral victory {{of his friend}} Garfield in November and his son Beverley joining him as vice-consul. His {{repeated}} requests for leave to return home and visit {{the rest of his}} family kept being denied, as were most requests for supplies or funds, and one relative was removed from the Lighthouse Board. In addition to the press and bureaucratic sniping, Mosby found his salary insufficient to support socialization among the local merchant class. Still, as the new year began, Mosby won a slander lawsuit brought against him in Hong Kong by Peter Smith, the sailors' boardinghouse keeper associated with ex-consul Bailey, reporting that he defended himself to <b>the</b> <b>applause</b> of jury and spectators, as well as laughter of the distinguished judge. By the time Mosby received notice that his U.S. leave had been approved, President Garfield had been assassinated and was hanging on to life. Garfield died on September 20, and President Chester Arthur considered promoting Mosby to the similar post at Shangai (with higher living expenses), but Mosby wanted to either return home or remain in Hong Kong. Thus he remained in exile and dealt with the implications of the Chinese Exclusion Acts, the growing opium trade and the brewing war between France and China.|$|E
