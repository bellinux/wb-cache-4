5|$|As Reyes brings William back to Scully's apartment, Comer's {{artifact}} flies over William and hovers {{above his}} head. Scully, realizing something is wrong, plans to drive William to somewhere safe. At the same time, Doggett notices the Overcoat Woman watching them nearby. As Scully and Reyes drive away, Doggett confronts {{the woman at}} gunpoint, but she runs him over. Scully places William {{under the care of}} The Lone Gunmen, but they are soon ambushed by the Overcoat Woman. With Melvin Frohike (Tom Braidwood) and Richard Langly (Dean Haglund) incapacitated, the woman opens <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> van to find John Fitzgerald Byers (Bruce Harwood) holding William. The woman puts a gun to Byers' head.|$|E
5|$|Decatur House (748 Jackson Place NW) is {{allegedly}} {{haunted by}} the ghost of Stephen Decatur. In 1820, Commodore James Barron challenged Commodore Decatur to a duel over comments Decatur had made regarding Barron's conduct in the Chesapeake-Leopard Affair of 1807. The two men duelled on March 20, and Decatur was mortally wounded in the stomach. Decatur was rushed back to his home, and died there on March 22. A year after Decatur's death, his ghost reportedly began appearing at the house—standing in a second floor window looking out at H Street NW or leaving <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house {{with a box of}} dueling pistols. So many witnesses saw the specter of Decatur that the window was walled up. Some people have also claimed that they can hear his widow, who became hysterical at his death, weeping in the house.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} three {{soldiers}} entered, a fire started and travelled up the curtains {{and out of the}} second-floor window, severely burning the staff sergeant. A second wave of abseilers cut him free, and he fell to the balcony below before entering the embassy behind the rest of his team. Slightly behind Red Team, Blue Team detonated explosives on a first-floor window, forcing Sim Harris, who had just run into the room, to take cover. Much of the operation {{at the front of the}} embassy took place in full view of the assembled journalists and was broadcast on live television, thus Harris's escape across the parapet of a first-floor balcony was famously captured on video. As the soldiers emerged onto the first-floor landing, Lock tackled Oan to prevent him attacking the SAS men. Oan, still armed, was subsequently shot dead by one of the soldiers. Meanwhile, further teams entered the embassy through the back door and cleared the ground floor and cellar. The SAS then began evacuating hostages, manhandling them down the stairs towards <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> embassy. Two of the terrorists were hiding amongst the hostages; one of them produced a hand grenade when he was identified. An SAS soldier, who was unable to shoot for fear of hitting a hostage or another soldier, pushed the grenade-wielding terrorist to the bottom of the stairs, where two other soldiers shot him dead.|$|E

25|$|Charmaine's {{body was}} {{initially}} stowed {{in the coal}} cellar of Midland Road until Fred was released from prison. He would later bury her naked body in the yard close to <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flat, and although he remained adamant he had not dismembered this particular victim, a subsequent autopsy suggested the body had been severed at the hip (although this damage may {{have been caused by}} building work Fred conducted at the property in 1976). In addition, several bones—particularly patellae, finger, wrist, toe and ankle bones—were missing from her skeleton, leading to the speculation the missing parts had been retained as keepsakes (this would prove to be a distinctive discovery in all the autopsies of the victims exhumed in 1994).|$|E
25|$|Jugan {{was born}} in Glassport, Pennsylvania on October 16, 1957. He became {{interested}} in pro wrestling as a child after attending a live event at the McKeesport Palisades. Jugan later became a regular studio audience member on the famed Saturday night television program Studio Wrestling. Although the show was restricted to people over 18, Jugan was often sneaked in through <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> WIIC-TV studio by Bruno Sammartino's manager {{and sat in the}} back row of the bleachers. Jugan was studying photography in school at the time and began taking pictures at the matches. An official ringside photographer during the final years of Studio Wrestling, he eventually started submitting photos and writing for various wrestling magazines and newsletters. He was also president of a fanclub for Luis Martinez.|$|E

25|$|The gang {{attempted}} to rob {{the bank in}} Northfield at about 2pm. To carry out the robbery, the gang divided into two groups. Three men entered the bank, two guarded the door outside, and three remained near a bridge across an adjacent square. The robbers inside the bank were thwarted when acting cashier Joseph Lee Heywood refused to open the safe, falsely claiming that it was secured by a time lock even as they held a Bowie knife to his throat and cracked his skull with a pistol butt. Assistant cashier Alonzo Enos Bunker {{was wounded in the}} shoulder as he fled through <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bank. Meanwhile, the citizens of Northfield grew suspicious of the men guarding the door and raised the alarm. The five bandits outside fired into the air to clear the streets, driving the townspeople to take cover and fire back from protected positions. They shot two bandits dead and wounded the rest in the barrage. Inside, the outlaws turned to flee. As they left, one shot the unarmed cashier Heywood in the head. Historians have speculated about the identity of the shooter but have not reached consensus.|$|E
500|$|By chance, Johnson {{and three}} of his men, Lieutenant Daniel Toler and Sergeants Love and Miller, were still awake and {{discussing}} tactics. [...] Mexican troops {{had been told that}} the house where Johnson was quartered was one of their targets, yet a lamp burned in the window, signalling that this was the home of a loyalist. [...] Out of an abundance of caution, a group of troops knocked on the door. [...] Before the Texians could open the door, they heard the gunfire from the town square. [...] Toler looked out a window and saw uniformed troops on the porch. [...] Without opening the door, he told the soldiers, in Spanish, that there were no troops there, but he would open the door momentarily. [...] The fighting moved into the street, and soldiers who had been guarding <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house rushed around to the front. [...] Johnson, Toler, Love, and Miller dashed out the back door and escaped.|$|E
500|$|While Korn {{was looking}} for a place to record their debut album, they asked {{producer}} Ross Robinson to produce their album. After accepting the offer, Robinson suggested they record at Indigo Ranch, Malibu, California. The band would record the majority of the album there, while additional recording took place at Bakersfield's Fat Tracks. Korn recorded most of the album with all members playing simultaneously, as opposed to recording instruments separately. The [...] "distinctive" [...] sound and quality of music was given off by their instruments, rather than the production. The bagpipes on [...] "Shoots and Ladders" [...] are often thought to have been recorded on a mountain-top. However, they were actually recorded with a microphone set up at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> studio while Jonathan Davis walked past outside playing. As he walked further from the microphone, this led to the sound naturally fading quieter. Korn finished recording their self-titled album by the end of June 1994.|$|E

500|$|The Battle of Noordhorn, {{fought on}} 30 September 1581, was a pitched {{battle of the}} Dutch Revolt, fought between a Spanish army {{commanded}} by Colonel Francisco Verdugo – consisting of Walloon, German, Spanish and Albanian soldiers – and a Dutch States rebel army under the Englishman John Norreys – comprising English, Scottish, Dutch and Walloon troops – {{in the province of}} Friesland. In 1580, the Dutch stadtholder of Friesland, George van Lalaing, Count of Rennenberg, had shifted its allegiance from the Dutch to the Spanish side. [...] This opened a new front at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dutch Republic, forcing the States-General to dispatch forces to the north. That year the Dutch, under the leadership of John Norreys, succeeded in relieving the town of Steenwijk. In July 1581, Rennenberg died and was replaced by the Spaniard Francisco Verdugo, whose arrival in Friesland with reinforcements changed the situation. On 30 September Verdugo forced Norreys to give battle using a strategy of attrition.|$|E
2500|$|There was {{a special}} case {{established}} under the State Management Scheme where the brewery and licensed premises were bought and run by the state until 1973, most notably in Carlisle. During the 20th century elsewhere, both the licensing laws and enforcement were progressively relaxed, and there were differences between parishes; in the 1960s, at closing time in Kensington at 10:30pm, drinkers would rush over the parish boundary {{to be in good}} time for [...] "Last Orders" [...] in Knightsbridge before 11pm, a practice observed in many pubs adjoining licensing area boundaries. Some Scottish and Welsh parishes remained officially [...] "dry" [...] on Sundays (although often this merely required knocking at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pub). These restricted opening hours led to the tradition of lock-ins.|$|E
2500|$|Steve Boca was a grocer who was {{attacked}} {{in his bedroom}} as he slept, by an axe-wielding intruder on August 10, 1919. Boca awoke during the night to find a dark figure looming over his bed. Upon regaining consciousness, Boca ran to the street to investigate the intrusion, and found that his head had been cracked open. The grocer ran {{to the home of}} his neighbor, Frank Genusa, where he lost consciousness and collapsed. Nothing had been taken from the home, yet, once again, a panel on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> home had been chiseled away. [...] Boca recovered from his injuries, but could not remember any details of the trauma. [...] It should be noted that this attack took place after the emergence of the infamous axeman letter.|$|E

2500|$|Synagogues {{and easily}} {{recognizable}} Jewish properties and symbols throughout Britain were targeted by attackers. In Hendon, London, {{windows of the}} Raleigh Close synagogue were smashed {{and a piece of}} paper was found with the words [...] "Jews are sin". Blackpool and St John's Wood synagogues received telephone calls threatening that they would be blown up, and the walls of Plymouth Synagogue were attacked and marked with anti-semitic signs and slogans: [...] "Hang all Jews" [...] and [...] "Destroy Judah". In other attacks on Jewish targets, gravestones in a Jewish cemetery were uprooted in Birmingham, [...] "Hitler was right" [...] was daubed on properties in North Wales, and Jewish property in Halifax, Pendleton, Lancashire, Bolton, Holyhead and Southend were also attacked. In a further incident, <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> JC representative's home in Cardiff was marked [...] "Jews—good old Hitler". On 5 August 1947, The Times and Jewish Chronicle reported that in Eccles near Manchester, a crowd of 700 people [...] "cheered each hit" [...] as missiles pelted Jewish properties smashing their windows.|$|E
2500|$|On December 1, 2006, {{despite the}} PRD's plans to prevent Calderón from taking office, the inauguration {{in front of}} Congress was able to proceed. Hours before Calderón's arrival, lawmakers from the PRD and PAN parties began a brawl, in which several representatives threw punches and pushed, while others shouted at each other. PRD representatives shouted [...] "Fuera Fox" [...] ("Out with President Fox") and blew whistles, while PAN representatives responded back with [...] "Mexico, Mexico". Minutes before Calderón and Fox walked into Congress, the {{president}} of the Chamber of Deputies announced a legal quorum, thus enabling Calderón to legally take the oath of office. At 9:45am CST, all Mexican media cut to the official national broadcast, where commentators discussed the situation and showed scenes inside the Palace of the Chamber of Deputies, Palacio de San Lázaro. At 9:50am CST, Calderón entered the chamber through <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> palace and approached the podium, where he took the oath as required by the Constitution. After the anthem, opposition continued to yell in Spanish [...] "Felipe will fall". PAN representatives shouted back, [...] "Sí se pudo" [...] (Yes, we did it!).|$|E
2500|$|At around 5:00a.m. on July 9, 2011, {{at least}} eight alleged gunmen of the Gulf Cartel entered the first {{domicile}} of the Cázares family in neighborhood San Francisco in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico {{to carry out a}} kidnapping. The first house was owned by Rodolfo Cázares Garza. The kidnappers were wearing military-style uniforms and ski-masks, but the victims noticed that they were sporting white-colored sneakers, speaking vulgarities, and looking for valuable house possessions, which suggested they were not law enforcement or military personnel. They stormed each of the bedrooms in the house to round up the victims before blindfolding them (except for two children). Once the kidnappers ordered the patriarch to open the family's safe, they forced all the family into their vehicles before taking off. By 7:00a.m., the Gulf Cartel kidnappers reached the second home of the Cázares in neighborhood Río and forced the family to open their front door. [...] "We have your brother", one of the kidnappers said as the others guarded the entrance booth of the neighborhood with assault rifles. Four more relatives were kidnapped at the second domicile, owned by Rodolfo's brother Héctor Cázares Garza. However, one of them managed to escape through <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house before running to the third house of the Cázares a few blocks away. A few minutes later, the kidnappers made their way into the third house, owned by Alberto Cázares Garza, one of the other brothers. By 8:00a.m., 18 members of the Cázares family were kidnapped. This mass abduction stood out from other kidnapping cases in Mexico because all of the victims were related.|$|E
