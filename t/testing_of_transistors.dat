40|$|Aim. The aim of {{the study}} is to {{determine}} the impact of structural and technological parameters on the resistance of the bipolar static induction transistor. Methods. The paper provides a comparative analysis of the advantages of bipolar static induction transistor compared to the bipolar power transistors, MOSFETs and insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT). Considered are structural and technological parameters that influence the resistance of BSIT-transistor. Result. As a result of experimental study on silicon substrates were formed <b>test</b> prototypes <b>of</b> BSIT <b>transistor</b> structure, are presented calculation and experimental works. Obtained are the resistance dependencies <b>of</b> the <b>transistor</b> cell on the thickness of the epitaxial film; the resistance dependencies <b>of</b> BSIT <b>transistor</b> cell on the effective gate length for different values of the impurity concentration in the epitaxial film; dependencies resistance <b>of</b> the <b>transistor</b> cell on the gate length at different values of the epitaxial film thickness; the resistance dependencies <b>of</b> BSIT <b>transistor</b> cell on the distance between the mask for the p-region and the gate; dependencies on the multiplication the cell resistance by its area on the gate length. Conclusion. When increasing the gate length (Lk) and the mask length for the p-region (lp +) in the transistor structure, the resistance decreases and the dependence of multiplication of the cell resistance by its area Q on the gate length has this case the minimum. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} {{known as}} Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) impacts the operational characteristics of Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) devices, and tends to have a stronger effect on p-channel devices. This instability is observed with an applied "on" biasing during normal operation and can be accelerated with thermal stress. A normal applied electrical bias on CMOS transistors {{can lead to the}} generation of interface states at the junction of the gate oxide and the transistor channel. The hydrogen that normally passivates the interface states can diffuse away from the interface. As a result, the threshold voltage and transconductance will change. These interface states can be measured to determine the susceptibility to NBTI of the devices. For this purpose, a charge pumping experiment and other On-the-Fly techniques at certain temperatures can provide the interface state density and other valuable data. NBTI can impact current technological fabrication processes, such as those provided to the government from IBM.
