5|$|Kant {{argued that}} {{rational}} beings {{can never be}} treated merely as means to ends; they must always also be treated as ends themselves, requiring that their own reasoned motives must be equally respected. This derives from Kant's claim that reason motivates morality: it demands that we respect reason as a motive in all beings, including other people. A rational being cannot rationally consent to being used merely {{as a means to}} an end, so they must always be treated as an end. Kant justified this by arguing that moral obligation is a rational necessity: that which is rationally willed is morally right. Because all rational agents rationally will themselves to be an end and never merely a means, it is morally obligatory that they are treated as such. This {{does not mean that we}} can never treat a human as a means to an end, but <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> do, we also treat him as an end in himself.|$|E

25|$|Bohm's {{proposed}} implicate order applies both {{to matter}} and consciousness. He {{suggested that it}} could explain the relationship between them. He saw mind and matter as projections into our explicate order from the underlying implicate order. Bohm claimed <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> look at matter, we see nothing that helps us to understand consciousness.|$|E

25|$|Measuring consumers' {{conscious}} and subconscious through studying their biological sensorimotor, {{cognitive and affective}} response to marketing stimuli, called neuromarketing, is of increasing interest to marketers {{in order to gain}} insight into how they consume. Dawkins (1989) explained <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> die we leave behind genes and memes; genes being the unit of genetic information, and memes the units of cultural information. Neuromarketing aims to examine the memory of these memes in order to manipulate them.|$|E
25|$|An {{increase}} in the RD temperament leads us to seek out those behaviors or substances {{that will allow us}} to remain in a pleasant physical and/or mental state, attributing to the fact that we humans are hedonistic individuals, seeking to avoid pain and embracing pleasurable stimuli. Our pleasure and reward systems in the brain are hyper-activated, which makes us display continuous approach behaviors to the reward in question. Our neuro-circuity is as such <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> stop having access to such pleasurable objects of desire, we then experience negative consequences (withdrawal symptoms). Addictive behaviors then arise to alleviate such negative consequences and the cycle continues.|$|E
25|$|The {{vertices}} of the polytope {{are also}} called basic feasible solutions. The {{reason for this}} choice of name is as follows. Let d denote the number of variables. Then the fundamental theorem of linear inequalities implies (for feasible problems) that for every vertex x* of the LP feasible region, there exists a set of d (or fewer) inequality constraints from the LP such <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> treat those d constraints as equalities, the unique solution is x*. Thereby we can study these vertices by means of looking at certain subsets of the set of all constraints (a discrete set), rather than the continuum of LP solutions. This principle underlies the simplex algorithm for solving linear programs.|$|E

25|$|When Corinna (wife) {{arrives with}} Mervyn {{it is clear}} <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> saw Nan in act 1, Jerome had {{modelled}} her on Corinna. In fact the actress who played Nan (the robot) in act 1 now plays Corinna (the wife) in act 2. Geain doesn't arrive at this point as she has gone to visit a shop first. We first see her on the video screen {{at the door to}} the flat. Because of her masculine hair and clothing Jerome initially mistakes her for a local hooligan, and she enters looking surly, unwashed and very unfeminine – in complete contrast to the delightful 9-year-old girl shown on screen in Act 1. This makes Jerome very upset. Nan/Zoe's child-minding programming kicks in and she takes Geain to the kitchen for a drink. When they return shortly afterwards Nan/Zoe has transformed Geain, who is now clean, feminine and wearing a night-dress. She is still uncooperative, but has already developed a degree of respect for Nan/Zoe who takes her to the bedroom to put her to bed.|$|E

[...] Another senior Obama advisor said Biden [...] "is always prepared to be the skunk at the family picnic to make sure we are as intellectually honest as possible." [...] On June 11, 2010, Biden represented the United States at the opening ceremony of the World Cup, attended the England v.

The episode outperformed the 3.5 rating/9 share of CBS' crime drama series [...] in the 18—49 category. The Office creator Greg Daniels said he was particularly proud of this, {{especially in light of}} the series' upcoming 100th episode, [...] "Company Picnic"; Daniels said of beating CSI, [...] "Who would have thought <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> aired for the first time?" ...|$|E
500|$|Heikkinen was the {{one bright}} spot in the Wolverines’ 1937 season. In early November 1937, Anderson {{described}} Heikkinen as “the smallest but best lineman in the Michigan forward wall.” Anderson continued in his praise for Heikkinen: “Heik has shown the stuff in both of our tough games against Minnesota and Northwestern [...] [...] [...] Minnesota didn’t split our guards more than twice during the game. Heik was responsible {{for a lot of}} that. My conception of a good guard is one that stops anything that comes his way on defense and leads the blocking on offense. Heik has done just <b>that.</b> <b>When</b> <b>we</b> have the ball he is our fifth man in the backfield. He pulls out most of our plays and bowls over the opposition. We have made most of the gains through the line over his position.” ...|$|E
500|$|Kirchherr {{described}} {{how difficult it}} was to be accepted as a female photographer in the 1960s: [...] "Every magazine and newspaper wanted me to photograph the Beatles again. Or they wanted my old stuff, even if it was out of focus, whether they were nice or not. They wouldn't look at my other work. It was very hard for a girl photographer in the 60s to be accepted. In the end I gave up. I've hardly taken a photo since 1967." [...] Kirchherr was quoted as saying <b>that</b> <b>When</b> <b>We</b> Was Fab (Genesis Publications 2007), would be her last book of photographs: [...] "I have decided it is time to create one book in which I am totally involved so that it contains the pictures I like most, printed the way I would print them, even down to the text and design.... This book is me and that is why it will be the last one. The very last one." ...|$|E

500|$|The Ludys {{argue that}} one's love {{life should be}} both guided by and {{subordinate}} to one's relationship with God. They suggest that, [...] "if God's plan and purpose for you is marriage, then the person you will one day marry... is alive and wandering the earth" [...] and that this knowledge should encourage people to act {{in such a way}} that their future spouses would be pleased. The Ludys contest the definition of [...] "true love" [...] as an emotion; instead, they define [...] "true love" [...] as the choice to commit to another person no matter what happens. Eric writes that [...] "there are two ways each of us can approach life: spending our days meeting our needs or looking for ways to meet others' needs. The mystery is <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> spend our life focused on our own needs, we are never satisfied... but when we pour out our life and focus on how we can serve others... our deepest needs are met as well!" ...|$|E
500|$|Crewmen aboard Minas Geraes began {{planning}} for a revolt years before 1910, according to João Cândido Felisberto, an experienced sailor who would later become {{the leader of the}} Revolt of the Lash. The conspirators were motivated by the treatment of enlisted men in the Brazilian Navy, extending beyond the lash to even their substandard food, which led to not-uncommon outbreaks of beriberi. Some had formed a committee and had been meeting secretly for years in Rio de Janeiro. This semi-formal organization was only expanded when they were sent to Newcastle in the United Kingdom for training—the operation of such large and complex warships required specific skills. When interviewed years after the mutiny, Felisberto said that they [...] "maintained the committees in the very hotels where we were residing, awaiting the construction of the ships. Almost two years paid by the Brazilian government, we sent messengers to sound out the situation here [...] We did this so <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> arrive, we would be prepared to act"—they were just [...] "waiting for a date and for power," [...] referring to the brand-new warships.|$|E
500|$|Despite all {{the glowing}} reviews, FreeSpace 2 sold poorly. The April 2000 issue of PC Gamer stated that only 26,983 copies {{had been sold}} {{in the first six}} months of its release. These figures were {{acknowledged}} as disappointing, and described as awful by Kulas. [...] He, however, stated that as the team had stayed within budget by sticking to schedule, Volition should at least be breaking even with the estimated final sales of the game. In NowGamer's interview with Jim Boone, a producer at Volition, he stated that this could have been due to joysticks' being sold poorly because they were [...] "going out of fashion" [...] because more modern first-person shooters, such as Quake, were [...] "very much about the mouse and [...] keyboard". He went further on to state [...] "Before <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> did Descent for example, it was perfectly common for people to have joysticks – we sold a lot of copies of Descent. It was around that time [...] the more modern FPS with mouse and keyboard came out, as opposed to just keyboard like Wolfenstein [...] or something.".|$|E

500|$|Filming for {{the season}} began on August 31, and ended on December 19, 2015, with Edward J. Pei serving as {{director}} of photography. Unlike the first season, episodes were filmed concurrently, two at a time. Discussing the series' location move, Head of Marvel Television Jeph Loeb explained that [...] "Agent Carter season one took place in New York in 1946. It wasn't like {{we could go to}} New York and find 1946, so we shot in L.A. But that's part of the reason <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> talked about it, we said, 'You know what? This season let's stay in L.A.' Because so much of L.A. still looks like it did in 1946." [...] Butters expanded by saying the move to L.A. [...] "was something we had talked about {{in the middle of the}} first season... we realized that not only was it a good idea for the storytelling, but also...it's much easier for us to shoot L.A. for L.A. than try to shoot L.A. for New York." [...] She added the season hoped to film at Musso & Frank Grill, the Formosa Cafe, the Griffith Observatory, racetracks, piers, and other locations in Downtown Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|The next day, Churchill filed {{a lawsuit}} in state court {{claiming}} that the firing was retribution for his expressing politically unpopular views. The jury in Churchill's suit for reinstatement weighed the university's claims of academic misconduct per jury instructions it received in the case. As Stanley Fish said, [...] "It was the jury’s task to determine whether Churchill’s dismissal would have occurred independently of the adverse political response to his constitutionally protected statements." [...] The jury found that the alleged misconduct would not have led to Churchill's firing and rejected the university's academic misconduct claim as the grounds for dismissal. On April 1, 2009, a Colorado jury found that Churchill had been wrongly fired, and awarded $1 in damages. As {{one of the jurors}} said later in a press interview, [...] "it wasn't a slap in his face or anything like <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> didn't give him any money. It's just that [...] David Lane kept saying this wasn't about the money, and in the end, we took his word for that." [...] Churchill's counsel asked Chief Judge Larry J. Naves of the Denver District Court to order reinstatement in light of the verdict.|$|E
500|$|Revolutions per Minute was {{released}} on April 8, 2003. Like The Unraveling, it failed to reach any major record charts, but did reach number thirty-five on the Independent Albums chart in the United States. Critics praised the album for its impassioned lyrics and unique blend of hardcore punk and melodic hardcore; Brian Hiatt of Rolling Stone called Revolutions per Minute [...] "easily among the finest punk records of the past decade". To support the album, Rise Against traveled with other Fat Wreck Chord bands like Anti-Flag, None More Black, and No Use for a Name on North American and Japan based tours, and participated in the 2003 Warped Tour in North America. When asked about the band's early years with Fat Wreck Chords, Principe said: [...] "Our goal was to be on Fat Wreck Chords and just sell enough records so <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were home from tour, we wouldn't have to get jobs...Of course, that was all before we had families and children and numerous responsibilities. That was the beauty. And then the longer we did it things just kept coming our way." ...|$|E
