25|$|A truck breaks down. Three fugitives from justice get out {{and find}} {{themselves}} in the city of Mahagonny: Fatty the Bookkeeper, Trinity Moses, and Leocadia Begbick. Because the federal agents pursuing them will not search this far north, and they are in a good location to attract ships coming south from the Alaskan gold fields, Begbick decides that they can profit by staying where they are and founding a pleasure city, where men can have fun, because <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> in the world to rely on.|$|E

25|$|Descartes {{explains}} how {{he made a}} mention of the two questions, the existence of God, and the soul, in his Discourse on Method. Following this, he received objections, {{and two of them}} he considers are of importance. The first is how he concludes that the essence of the soul is a thing that thinks, excluding all other nature. To this he says that he has a clear perception that he is a thinking thing, and has no other clear perception, and from this he concludes that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> in the essence of the self.|$|E
25|$|In the Roman Liturgy {{the office}} of Nones is {{likewise}} constructed after {{the model of the}} Little Hours of the day; it is composed of the same elements as in the Rule of St. Benedict, with this difference: that instead of the three psalms (125-127), the three groups of eight verses from Psalm 118 are always recited. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> characteristic of this office in this liturgy. The hymn, which was added later, is the one already in use in the Benedictine Officeâ€”Rerum Deus tenax vigor. In the monastic rules prior to the 10th century certain variations are found. Thus in the Rule of Lerins, as in that of St. Caesarius, six psalms are recited at Nones, as at Terce and Sext, with antiphon, hymn and capitulum.|$|E
25|$|In episode 4, Agnes urges Kat {{to return}} to Spain, and when Dermott learns of this, he confronts Agnes about taking him from his mother. In episode 5, Agnes tells Dermott to keep Kat away from the christening of Bernie Kelly's (Susan Ateh) baby, but Dermott says Kat has made him feel welcome and invited him to meet his {{brothers}} in Spain, so Agnes reveals that Dermott has a twin sister. Dermott confronts Kat over this, {{who said she was}} waiting for the right time and insists <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> that Dermott does not know. In episode 6, Bernie, a local garda, asks Kat about the last time she saw Lance and Kat wonders if she suspects something happened, but Bernie denies this. Meanwhile, Kat is unaware that Alfie is having an operation on his brain tumour. Alfie asks Dermott to find Kat and bring her to the hospital, as it means they are unable to go back to Spain. Bernie works out that Dermott was involved in Lance's death, and sees him on the beach with Kat. Kat tells Dermott that Bernie was asking about him. He sees the garda arriving so takes Kat in a boat, saying they will try to find the whale that was recently seen off the coast. Bernie shouts at him to stop and calls the coastguard. Kat asks Dermott if he did something to Lance. Dermott then accidentally crashes the boat into a rock and Kat is thrown into the water and then cut by the propellor. Dermott gets Kat out of the sea but there is nobody around to help. Meanwhile, Alfie has his operation but loses his pulse and the medical staff start to resuscitate.|$|E

500|$|Offa of Mercia, who reigned from 757 to 796, was the {{dominant}} force in Anglo-Saxon England {{in the second}} half of the eighth century. The relationship between Offa and Cynewulf, who was king of Wessex from 757 to 786, is not well documented, but it seems likely that Cynewulf maintained some independence from Mercian overlordship. Evidence of the relationship between kings can come from charters, which were documents which granted land to followers or to churchmen, and which were witnessed by the kings who had power to grant the land. In some cases a king will appear on a charter as a subregulus, or [...] "subking", making it clear that he has an overlord. Cynewulf appears as [...] "King of the West Saxons" [...] on a charter of Offa's in 772; and he was defeated by Offa in battle in 779 at Bensington, but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> to suggest Cynewulf was not his own master, and he is not known to have acknowledged Offa as overlord. Offa did have influence in the southeast of the country: a charter of 764 shows him in the company of Heahberht of Kent, suggesting that Offa's influence helped place Heahberht on the throne. The extent of Offa's control of Kent between 765 and 776 is a matter of debate amongst historians, but from 776 until about 784 it appears that the Kentish kings had substantial independence from Mercia.|$|E

Although some {{scholars}} have identified this person with pope Vigilius, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> to support the identification besides the name. The form of address that Jordanes uses and his admonition that Vigilius [...] "turn to God" [...] would seem to rule out this identification.|$|E

[...] The settler press continued to denounce the Parihaka meetings as [...] "schools of fanaticism and sedition" [...] and said Te Whiti and Tohu needed to be [...] "taught the lesson of submission and obedience".|$|E
