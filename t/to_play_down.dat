5|$|Despite {{attempts}} by Paul I <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>down</b> Potemkin's role in Russian history, his name {{found its way}} into numerous items of common parlance. The phrase Potemkin village entered common usage in Russia and globally, despite its fictional origin. A century after Potemkin's death, the Battleship Potemkin was named in his honour. The ship became famous for its involvement in the Russian Revolution of 1905 and subsequent dramatization in The Battleship Potemkin, a Soviet movie by Sergey Eisenstein, which at one point was named the greatest film of all time. The name of the giant seaside staircase in Odessa, featured in the movie, eventually became known as the Potemkin Stairs.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the opening}} of the Games, the International Olympic Committee was keen <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>down</b> the risk that athletes faced from pollution; however, the {{organizing}} body considered rescheduling of endurance events (such as the cycling road race) if the pollution levels were too high. Athletes partaking in these events can consume 20 times the amount of oxygen as a sedentary person. A higher level of pollution in the air could adversely affect performance, damage or irritate an athlete's lungs, or exacerbate respiratory conditions, such as asthma.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from some}} early season games for MCC and A. J. Webbe's XI, all of Bosanquet's cricket in 1901 was for Middlesex. He {{maintained}} his faster style of bowling but {{also began to}} bowl slow leg breaks, with the as-yet unrecognised googly mixed in as variation. Later, he found he could not effectively maintain both styles and decided to concentrate on spin, gradually dropping his quick bowling. His bowling brought him 36 wickets {{at an average of}} 37.52 in 1901 but did not take more than three wickets in a single innings. With the bat, it took until July for him to pass fifty runs in an innings but his form improved in August with four fifties. He ended the season with consecutive centuries against Surrey and Essex. In total, Bosanquet scored 1,240 runs at an average of 32.63, and Warner regarded him as one of the three most reliable batsmen in the Middlesex side. After the season, Bosanquet went on his third tour of America, captaining a team himself. From January to April 1902, he toured the West Indies with Richard Bennett's team. He scored 623 runs at an average of 34.61 with five fifties and 55 wickets at an average of 15.47, including figures of eight for 30 in one innings. Bosanquet's cricket followed a similar pattern in 1902. He scored 749 runs at an average of 24.96, with a century against Cambridge. However, he did not pass fifty after the end of May until his last game of the season. With the ball, he took 40 wickets at an average of 21.17. These included 10 wickets against Oxford and 10 against Nottinghamshire; the latter performance, when he took seven for 57 in the second innings was described as remarkable by Wisden. It {{was the first time that}} his new bowling style attracted attention, although Bosanquet himself tried <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>down</b> the success for fear of alerting batsmen to his googly.|$|E

25|$|Politically Sivatte {{maintained}} his previous stand: recognition of Don Javier as legitimate leader combined with opposition to regency formula, to dynastic compromise and to appeasement versus Francoism. Except Catalonia and partially Navarre {{he failed to}} mobilize much support. This changed in the early 1950s, when calls for terminating the regency became widespread and endorsed even by Fal himself. When during Congreso Eucaristico in Barcelona in 1952 Don Javier effectively declared himself the king, Sivatte could have claimed a personal triumph. This so-called Acta de Barcelona was immediately followed {{by a number of}} statements which seemed <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>down</b> the declaration, vacillation which started to erode Sivatte’s recognition of Don Javier.|$|E

Instead Dundas, after witnessing Prussian army manoeuvres in Silesia in 1784, favoured the army model that Frederick the Great had created.

500|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the actual details of the case were known in southeastern South Australia for decades after the murders, from the 1920s a number of {{variations}} on the story appeared in print and were retold by local historians. The two key aspects of these accounts were that Brown was guilty of poisoning rather than shooting the Aboriginal people, and had subsequently undertaken an epic horse ride to Adelaide to successfully establish his alibi. The authors Foster, Hosking and Nettelbeck have concluded that this evolution of the story worked <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>down</b> the seriousness of the crime, and demonstrated that the story had been filtered through a prism of the [...] "pioneer legend" [...] of the South Australian frontier.|$|E

Even {{though there was a}} storyline where she was terrified about singing in a school play, I wasn't nervous at all. I had to try really hard to make myself feel nervous." [...] She revealed she had <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>down</b> her voice and make it [...] "a bit cleaner" [...] and a [...] "bit more inexperienced". This was due to the fact {{it was meant to be}} that she had never sung before – [...] "I have to pull her back a bit."

By contrast, Arsenal made their 21st Community Shield appearance, and won 13, including one shared in 1991. They went into the match as holders of the Shield, having defeated Manchester City a year earlier. Both clubs had only once met before in the Shield, when Chelsea won by two goals to one in 2005. Arsenal had failed to beat Chelsea in all competitions since 2011, and [...] Mourinho was undefeated against his opponent Arsène Wenger in 13 matches.

500|$|Nandanar's tale is retold {{numerous}} times through folk tales, plays, literature and art forms like Villu Paatu and [...] "musical discourses".

500|$|Practising {{throughout}} 1899 and 1900, Bosanquet {{began to}} use the googly in minor matches before using it in important cricket. His first use of the new delivery in first-class cricket came in the match against Leicestershire in 1900 in which he scored two centuries. In the second innings, Samuel Coe had scored 98 when Bosanquet, still known as a fast-bowler, bowled his off break; the ball bounced four times and the batsman was stumped (although, writing in 1925, Bosanquet recalled Coe had been bowled). Bosanquet later wrote that the wicket [...] "was rightly treated as a joke, and {{was the subject of}} ribald comment". Middlesex captains permitted him to try googlies if there was little pressure on, but he later wrote: [...] "Though I could claim some five or six wickets before the close of the season, my efforts produced far more laughter than dismay in the hearts of opposing batsmen". But Bosanquet persisted with the delivery and soon began to be noticed by influential cricketers who recognised the potential of the googly. Previously, some bowlers occasionally bowled unintended googlies, but were unable to control them. Although batsmen were accustomed to off break or leg break bowlers, it was an unprecedented problem to face a bowler who could bowl both types of delivery at will, disguising which one he bowled. Bosanquet persuaded teammates to remain silent as he wished to maintain the impression that his off break was an accident so that batsmen were not expecting it. He further tried <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>down</b> his successes: he feigned surprise, acting as if they were similarly accidental.|$|E
