25|$|Indoors, an avocado tree {{is usually}} grown from <b>the</b> <b>pit</b> <b>of</b> an avocado fruit. This is often done by {{removing}} the pit from a ripe, unrefrigerated avocado fruit. The pit is then stabbed {{with three or four}} toothpicks, about one-third of the way up from the flat end. The pit is placed in a jar or vase containing tepid water. It should split in four to six weeks and yield roots and a sprout. If there is no change by this time, the avocado pit is discarded. Once the stem has grown a few inches, it is placed in a pot with soil. It should be watered every few days. Avocados have been known to grow large, so owners must be ready to re-pot the plant several times.|$|E

500|$|Because of the Hays Code, {{lesbianism}} after 1930 {{was absent}} from most films, even those adapted with overt lesbian characters or plot devices. Lillian Hellman's play The Children's Hour was {{converted into a}} heterosexual love triangle and retitled These Three. Biopic Queen Christina in 1933, starring Greta Garbo, veiled most of the speculation about Christina of Sweden's affairs with women. Homosexuality or lesbianism was never mentioned outright in the films while the Hays Code was enforced. The reason censors stated for removing a lesbian scene in 1954's <b>The</b> <b>Pit</b> <b>of</b> Loneliness was that it was, [...] "Immoral, would tend to corrupt morals". The code was relaxed somewhat after 1961, {{and the next year}} William Wyler remade The Children's Hour with Audrey Hepburn and Shirley MacLaine. After MacLaine's character admits her love for Hepburn's, she hangs herself; this set a precedent for miserable endings in films addressing homosexuality.|$|E

Little of Hall's novel can be discerned in its story of a butch lesbian who is blinded with acid and run over by a truck, freeing the naïve young roommate she seduced to find love with a fullback.
