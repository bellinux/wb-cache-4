5|$|Between {{chapters}} in which Penelope is narrating, the twelve maids speak on topics from their point-of-view. They lament their childhood as slaves with no parents or playtime, sing of freedom, and {{dream of being}} princesses. They contrast their lives to Telemachus' and wonder {{if they would have}} killed him as a child if they knew he would kill them as a young man. <b>They</b> <b>blame</b> Penelope and Eurycleia for allowing them to unjustly die. In Hades, they haunt both Penelope and Odysseus.|$|E
5|$|Gilly and Steph {{take a walk}} {{round the}} village on bonfire night where she finally admits she's scared of dying, they have a heart to heart {{conversation}} where she realises she's it is how {{she is going to}} die that scares her. When the pair see restaurant Il Gnosh on fire, Gilly rings for help whilst Steph runs into the burning building to save Amy Barnes (Ashley Slanina-Davies) and her children. Gilly stands on a ladder outside and begs her to come out, however she tells him she's ready to die and walks back into the flames. Gilly deals with his grief by becoming angry that Steph has 'left' him. After Rhys tries to comfort him, Gilly goes into Steph's room and trashes it after seeing that she has still kept her photo of her and Max Cunningham (Matt Littler) on their wedding day, placed on a table. Gilly argues with Steph's family as <b>they</b> <b>blame</b> him for not saving her and disagree on the funeral arrangements. Frankie then tells him that Steph had never loved him and that Max would have done anything to save Steph from the fire, making him further deeply upset and angry. He starts drinking heavily, causing trouble on many occasions.|$|E
5|$|To repair Zulf's {{damage to}} the Bastion, the Kid starts {{collecting}} Shards, a lesser form of Cores. As he obtains the penultimate shard needed, the Ura attack the Bastion, damaging it and abducting Zia. In the next seven days, The Kid engages in sporadic skirmishes in Ura territory. When he finally blasts through an Ura outpost and meets Zia, she tells him that she had left with the Ura voluntarily to find out their intentions; Rucks had previously told Zia that the Bastion {{had the ability to}} somehow fix the Calamity. The Kid travels to the once-underground Ura homeland to retrieve the last shard. There, he discovers Zulf being attacked by his own people: the battle with the Kid has devastated the Ura forces, and <b>they</b> <b>blame</b> Zulf for bringing the Kid to their home. The Kid can choose to drop his weapon to help Zulf or leave him. If he leaves Zulf behind, the Kid destroys the remnants of the Ura and escapes through a skyway. If he chooses to carry Zulf, Ura archers initially open fire on them but ultimately cease fire and watch silently as the Kid and Zulf take the skyway back to the Bastion.|$|E

Locke promises to fix the situation. He takes Eddie hunting and holds Eddie at gunpoint. Eddie says that Locke was chosen because his psych profile said he would be [...] "amenable for coercion".

500|$|Sunsoft was not {{interested}} in the game for PC, and was instead focused on the video game console market. At the time, consoles had no hard drives and small memory buffers, meaning the game had to be designed around these technical constraints. To solve this issue, they compartmentalized parts of the game's environments into the different Ages. The Millers decided that most people did not like puzzles. Thus, a good puzzle would feel familiar and part of the world—not like a puzzle, but something for players to figure out like a circuit breaker in their house, using observation and common sense. Cyan did not have fans to please, and did not know exactly who the game would appeal to; Robyn felt like {{they did not have to}} second-guess their choices and could [...] "explore the world as we were designing" [...] and build a game for themselves. In a 2016 interview, Rand Miller stated that they strived to design the puzzles in Myst and their subsequent games by trying to balance three aspects: the puzzles themselves, the environment, and the story. Rand also stated they wanted to make sure that clues to the solutions to puzzles were apparent and presented to the player in a manner for these connections to be made: [...] "once the player finds the solution, if <b>they</b> <b>blame</b> us, then we haven’t done a good job. But if <b>they</b> <b>blame</b> themselves, then we have." ...|$|E

Also, <b>they</b> <b>blame</b> the port itself for this, not the Downtown traffic. They state that at Port Everglades, they can make three to four runs a day, versus Port of Miami where [...] "you're lucky if you get in two," [...] states truck driver Alejandro Arrieta, due to waiting time at the port, which is often several hours. Port Everglades also has major {{redevelopment}} plans underway that includes its own deep dredging to a [...] depth; they also claim to have surpassed the Port of Miami, which {{has long been known}} as the [...] "Cruise Capital of the World" [...] as well as the [...] "Cargo Gateway to the Americas," [...] in both cruise traffic and cargo tonnage handled.|$|E
500|$|In A Game of Thrones (1996), Tyrion is {{introduced}} {{as the third}} and youngest child of wealthy and powerful Tywin Lannister, the former Hand of the King, and Joanna Lannister, who dies giving birth to him. Tyrion's elder sister Cersei is the Queen of Westeros by virtue of her marriage to King Robert Baratheon, and Cersei's male twin Jaime {{is one of the}} Kingsguard, the royal bodyguard. Described as an ugly ("for all the world like a gargoyle"), malformed dwarf with different colored eyes, green and black, Tyrion possesses the golden blond hair of a Lannister but has a complicated relationship with the rest of them. While he is afforded the privilege and luxuries of his family, he is treated as a [...] "second class noble" [...] because of his stature. Tyrion's mother Joanna died giving birth to him and Tywin and Cersei loathe him because <b>they</b> <b>blame</b> him for her death. While Tywin bears no affection for Tyrion, he nevertheless feels a sense of duty to his son, raising him in the Lannister fold and extending Tyrion a share of the family wealth. In contrast to Tywin and Cersei, Jaime has great affection for Tyrion and treats him with kindness, respect, friendship and love. Lev Grossman of Time wrote in 2011: ...|$|E
500|$|In the November–December 1999 {{edition of}} El Machete, the EPB {{addressed}} the momentum gained {{by the recent}} Vieques Navy protests, recapitulating that the independence movement had opposed {{the presence of the}} military on that island since the original residents were evicted during the 1940s. The organization then accused all politicians of the subsequent PPD/PNP administration of suffering what they called [...] "USMAIL syndrome", a willingness to cooperate with any military interest of the United States and helping the federal government prosecute those that interfered with their practices in Vieques. The group reaffirmed their belief that Rodríguez Cristóbal was tortured and murdered while in federal custody and stated that the Navy had [...] "lied [...] manipulated" [...] the public to justify their operations, failing to fulfill a promise to [...] "economically develop the island and its population, to eliminate unemployment, [...] keep the island fee of environmental damage, [...] to keep military practices at a minimum [...] return any terrain demes unnecessary." [...] The EPB expressed that they perceived that not only were neither of these fulfilled, but that the situation in Vieques had worsened since the arrival of the military, comparing it to the treatment that the federal government gave to Native Americans. Despite considering the protests an unitary event, the organization questioned if the appearance of some PNP/PPD politicians was intended to attract votes and mentioned a counter measure adopted by congressmen Inhofe and Warner, where Roosevelt Roads Base would be closed if the Navy was expelled from Vieques, as an attempt to dissuade the public. The EPB disregarded this campaign, citing that it was employing [...] "backstreet psychological techniques" [...] and underestimating the intelligence of Puerto Ricans, predicting that it would fail and warning that if the Navy continued to conduct live ammo drills in Vieques, they would respond [...] "According to the rules of military struggles. Selecting the right scenery and action." [...] The group also citicsized representative Edwin Mundo's defense of the Navy, as well as his relationship with ex-pat Raúl Alarcón, whom <b>they</b> <b>blame</b> of sabotaging the career of independentist artists such as Danny Rivera in the United States.|$|E

[...] On November 2, he again expressed sympathy with frustrations about the economy but also said many of the complaints levied at the Fed, including those made against the steps it took during the financial crisis, are misguided. “The concerns about the Fed are based on misconceptions,” he said. “A very simplistic interpretation of that [...] was that we were doing that because we wanted to preserve banker salaries. That was obviously not the case.” Dallas Federal Reserve President Richard W. Fisher said that he was [...] "somewhat sympathetic" [...] to the views of the protesters, and added, [...] "We have too many people out of work. We have a very uneven distribution of income. We have a very frustrated people, and I can understand their frustration." ...|$|E
2500|$|After four decades, the historiography on him {{is still}} contested territory. The left {{wing of the}} Labour Party {{considers}} him a traitor whose betrayals of true socialism laid the foundations for Thatcherism. They point to his decision in 1976 to allow the International Monetary Fund to control the government budget. They accuse him of abandoning the traditional Labour commitment to full employment. <b>They</b> <b>blame</b> his rigorous pursuit of a policy of controlling income growth for the [...] "Winter of Discontent". Writers {{on the right of}} the Labour Party complained that he was a weak leader who was unable {{to stand up to the}} left. The [...] "New Labour" [...] writers who admire Tony Blair identify him with the old-style partisanship that was a dead end, which a new generation of modernisers had to repudiate. [...] Practically all commentators agree that Callaghan made a serious mistake by not calling an election in the autumn of 1978. Bernard Donoughue, a senior official in his government, depicts Callaghan as a strong and efficient administrator who stood heads above his predecessor Harold Wilson. The standard scholarly biography by Kenneth Morgan is generally favourable – at least for the middle of his premiership – while admitting failures at the beginning, at the end, and in his leadership role after Thatcher's victory. The treatment found in most textbooks and surveys of the period remains largely negative.|$|E

2500|$|Korean {{nationalist}} historiography {{has dominated}} the field of Korean studies in the Republic of Korea (South Korea) since 1945. From 1945 to the late 1960s, South Korean national historiography began {{to move away from}} biographies of heroic figures in the Korean independence movement towards analyzing nationalist incidents such as the March 1st Movement. Still, South Korean nationalist historiography aims to refute what historian Lee Ki-baek called a [...] "colonial view of Korean history", to which Japanese and foreign scholars supposedly still subscribed. One such [...] "colonial view" [...] was that the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) was stagnant, which nationalist historians studied Goryeo institutions to try to refute with evidence of dynamism and change. But there are more than twice the number of articles and monographs on the Joseon than there are for Goryeo, since South Korean historians assume that there was a potential fundamental, irreversible change from traditionalism to modernism during that time. This change, so say historians like Choe Yŏng-hŭi, which inhibited by the various Japanese invasions from the 16th century and ultimate annexation, which <b>they</b> <b>blame</b> for social instability and armed banditry. Kim Chol-choon, writing in 1970, evaluated the state of South Korean historiography as lacking a [...] "critical spirit". In 1978, nationalist historian Kang Man'gil challenged the existing periodization of South Korean history into [...] "colonial" [...] and [...] "postliberation" [...] blocs, instead suggesting that {{the second half of the}} 20th century should be characterized as one of [...] "division", preceding the creation of a unified, ethnic Korean state. His attack on the [...] "colonial" [...] Korean historiography proposed a new [...] "self-determining historiography" [...] (chuch'ejŏk sagwan). Since the 1970s, fringe elements in the South Korean historical community have also tried to resurrect Shin's irredentist focus on Manchuria. The normalization of China–South Korea relations and visits to Koreans in China have increased interest in the region, although efforts at [...] "Recovering the Ancient Lands", as one irredentist author puts it, are marginal in the public sphere.|$|E
