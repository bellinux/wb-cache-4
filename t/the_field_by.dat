5|$|American {{football}} {{in the early}} 1900s had become increasingly violent; with no forward pass, the ball carrier would be typically pushed and pulled up <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>by</b> his own players in massive formations that often resulted in serious injuries. In 1905, 18 deaths, three at the college level, were attributed to football; 159 serious injuries were also reported, 88 at the college level.|$|E

5|$|Antrodia serialiformis {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to A.serialis, but the latter has larger spores (6.3–8 by 2.2–3.3µm).

40|$|<b>The</b> {{gravitational}} <b>field</b> shielding <b>by</b> scalar <b>field</b> {{and type}} II superconductors are theoret- ically investigated. In {{accord with the}} well-developed five-dimensional fully covariant Kaluza-Klein theory with a scalar <b>field,</b> which unifies <b>the</b> Einsteinian general relativity and Maxwellian electromagnetic theory, <b>the</b> scalar <b>field</b> cannot only polarize the space as shown previously, but also flatten the space as indicated recently. The polariza- tion of space decreases <b>the</b> electromagnetic <b>field</b> <b>by</b> increasing <b>the</b> equivalent vacuum permittivity constant, while the flattening of space decreases <b>the</b> gravitational <b>field</b> <b>by</b> decreasing <b>the</b> equivalent gravitational constant. In other words, <b>the</b> scalar <b>field</b> can be also employed to shield <b>the</b> gravitational <b>field.</b> A strong scalar <b>field</b> significantly shield <b>the</b> gravitational <b>field</b> <b>by</b> largely decreasing <b>the</b> equivalent gravitational constant. According {{to the theory of}} gravitational <b>field</b> shielding <b>by</b> scalar <b>field,</b> <b>the</b> weight loss experimentally detected for a sample near a rotating ceramic disk at very low tempera- ture can be explained as the shielding of <b>the</b> Earth gravitational <b>field</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Ginzburg- Landau scalar field, which is produced by the type II superconductors. The significant shielding of gravitational <b>field</b> <b>by</b> scalar <b>field</b> produced <b>by</b> superconductors may lead to a new spaceflight technology in future...|$|R

5|$|The {{match is}} mostly remembered for Billy Bremner and Kevin Keegan being jointly {{dismissed}} from <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>by</b> referee Bob Matthewson in the 60th minute {{after they had}} a fight. Keegan, who claimed provocation, was furious about being sent off and threw his shirt away. Bremner copied him and the two players were afterwards charged with bringing football into disrepute. The FA Disciplinary Committee imposed tough punishments but were themselves heavily criticised by people in football who doubted their competence.|$|E
5|$|The ninth-ranked Hurricanes boasted a 721 regular-season record, {{including}} {{wins over}} Southern California and Florida. The Hurricanes were led on <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>by</b> three-time All-American lineback Ted Hendricks, {{who would later}} go on to a Hall of Fame career in the National Football League. Off the field, the Hurricanes were coached by Charlie Tate, who would head the Hurricanes football team until 1970.|$|E

5|$|Although the puffball was {{originally}} described as new to science by Elizabeth Eaton Morse in 1935, {{it was not}} published validly until 60 years later. The species is named for its resemblance to Calvatia sculpta, from which it can be usually distinguished in <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>by</b> its less prominent pyramidal warts, and microscopically by the antler-like branches of its capillitium (thread-like material among the spores). Calbovista subsculpta is a good edible species while its interior flesh (the gleba) is still firm and white. As the puffball matures, its insides become dark brown and powdery from mature spores.|$|E
5|$|During {{the regular}} season, the Hokies {{averaged}} 29.3 {{points per game}} and scored at least 21 points in 22 consecutive games—a streak dating to the 1995 season. Virginia Tech's offense was led on <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>by</b> quarterback Al Clark, who passed for 1,476 yards and 10 touchdowns. He also ran for 344 yards during the regular season. At the beginning of December, however, Clark underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left knee in order to repair damaged cartilage in the joint. Due to the long recovery time involved with the surgery, it was questioned if he would play in the Gator Bowl or {{if he would be}} able to play at full strength. Four days prior to the game, Clark's presence at the game was put even more in doubt when he caught the flu and developed a 102-degree fever. Clark's backup, redshirt freshman quarterback Nick Sorensen, completed 11 of his 21 pass attempts during the season for 140 yards and two touchdowns.|$|E

Harrya atriceps is a closely related rare species from Costa Rica. In contrast to its more common relative, it lacks reddish color in its stipe scabers and has a black cap, although it has a similar yellow stipe base.|$|E
5|$|Graeme Le Saux and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink {{were passed}} fit for Chelsea, but John Terry was {{omitted from the}} {{starting}} lineup, having woken up ill {{on the morning of}} the final. For Arsenal, goalkeeper David Seaman came in place of Richard Wright, who deputised for him in the earlier rounds of the competition. Chelsea were led onto <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>by</b> Roberto Di Matteo, who had been forced to retire from football earlier in the season due to a serious injury. After an uneventful first half, Chelsea settled much the quicker of the two and created several chances to score. Arsenal withstood the pressure and took the lead in the 70th minute, when Ray Parlour scored from 25 yards. They made sure of victory after Fredrik Ljungberg scored from a similar distance.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, Brown again ran for governor, {{entering}} a crowded Democratic primary that included Lieutenant Governor Steve Beshear, former governor Julian Carroll, Grady Stumbo, and political newcomer Wallace Wilkinson. He entered the race late – filing his candidacy papers in late February before the primary election in late May. When Brown approached {{the state capitol}} to file his papers, Beshear met him outside the filing office and challenged him to an impromptu debate, but Brown declined. As Brown quickly became the frontrunner, Beshear attacked his lavish lifestyle {{in a series of}} campaign ads, one of which was based on the popular television show Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. Other ads by Beshear played up Brown's ties to James P. Lambert, while still others claimed that Brown would raise taxes. Brown refuted Beshear's claims in ads of his own, and the battle between Beshear and Brown opened an opportunity for Wilkinson – who distinguished himself from <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>by</b> advocating for a state lottery – to make a late surge. He defeated Brown, his closest competitor, by a margin of 58,000 votes.|$|E
