40|$|The {{research}} {{aimed to}} determine the diversity of endophytic fungi in soybean crop with different resistance against Sclerotium rolfsii and find out their potential antagonist in controlling S. rolfsii by in vitro and in vivo. Materials {{used in this study}} were soybean with a variety of Wilis (susceptible variety) and Sinabung (resistant variety). This research was conducted at the Microbiology Laboratory of Central Laboratory of Life Science (LSIH), Brawijya University and in the <b>trial</b> <b>plantation</b> of Malang Research Institute for Food Crops, Lawang, Malang subdistrict in September 2015 until May 2016. Type of experimental design used was Complete Randomized Design with 16 treatments and three times repetitions at in vitro experiment with 16 treatments and four times repetitions at in vivo experiment. Observation on in vitro test is covering to colony morphology of fungal pathogens on PDA medium. On the test of in vivo, it was observed a disease occurrence and effectiveness rate of endophytic fungi. There are 15 species of endophytic fungi produced from isolation, namely Trichoderma sp., Aspergillus sp. 2, Aspergillus sp. 3, Acremonium sp. 1, Acremonium sp. 2, Acremonium sp. 3, Acremonium sp. 4, Fusarium sp. 1, Fusarium sp. 2, Cephalosporium sp, Microsporum sp., Penicillium sp., and unidentified fungi called W 2 and W 4. The highest inhibitory of endophytic fungi against S. rolfsii by Aspergillus sp. 2 is 89. 18 % (in vitro) and 61. 21 % (in vivo), while Trichoderma sp. 91. 88 % (in vitro) and 63. 29 % (in vivo). Diversity index value of Wilis variety is higher than Sinabung, i. e. 1. 878 and 1. 606 respectively. While dominance index value of Sinabung variety is 0. 2035 and Wilis is 0. 1528...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} of project AFG/ 82 / 003 was {{to assist the}} Government of Afghanistan improve forestry planning, management and development to meet the country's increasing demand for forest products, through strengthening the Department of Forestry and Range. The project concentrated upon training the Department's personnel {{in order to improve}} its planning and technical capabilitiesThe project focused largely upon fast-growing species, mainly poplars, and on nursery development management. Formal training courses were conducted on poplar cultivation, nursery development, seed collection, and improved charcoal production. Twenty-one Afghan foresters were sent abroad for specialized trainingThe project also provided technical support to the tree planting programme, and assisted in the construction of improved forest nurseries. <b>Trial</b> <b>plantations</b> were established in Jangal-e-Markaz Deh Murad Khan and Chaman, using improved varieties of poplars, pines, and other species. Extension activities to demonstrate poplar raising were undertaken, and a series of brochures was prepared for the use of individuals and groups of progressive farmers in KabulProgrammes to develop forestry are by their nature slow. In spite of the late start, and several constraints, project AFG/ 82 / 003 was successful during its first two years. It was therefore recommended that a second phase of the project should follow, with the {{main objective}} of supporting the Guzergah Forestry Centre, and that training continue, to further strengthen the Department of Forestry and Rang...|$|R
40|$|In the Neotropics, {{there is}} a growing {{interest}} in establishing plantations of native tree species for commerce, local consumption, and to replant on abandoned agricultural lands. Although numerous <b>trial</b> <b>plantations</b> have been established, comparative information on the performance of native trees under different regional environments is generally lacking. In this study, we evaluated the accumulation and partitioning of above-ground biomass in 16 native and two exotic tree species growing in replicated species selection trials in Panama under humid and dry regional environments. Seven of the 18 species accumulated greater total biomass at the humid site than at the dry site over a two-year period. Species specific biomass partitioning among leaves, branches and trunks was observed. However, awide range of total biomass found among species (from 1. 06 kg for Dipteryx panamensis to 29. 84 kg for Acacia mangium at Soberania) justified the used of an Aitchison log ratio transformation to adjust for size. When biomass partitioning was adjusted for size, a majority of these differences proved to be a result of the ability of the tree to support biomass components rather than the result of differences in the regional environments at the two sites. These findings were confirmed by comparative ANCOVAs on Aitchison-transformed and non-Aitchison-transformed variables. In these comparisons, basal diameter, height and diameter at breast height were robust predictors of biomass for the pooled data from both sites, but Aitchison-transformed variables had little predictive power...|$|R

40|$|A dispute has {{erupted in}} Madagascar between naturalists and the Water and Forests Service, {{on the subject}} of {{reforestation}} with eucalyptus. The matter specifically concerns the 3, 000 hectares of plantations established since 1908 at Périnet, in a highly degraded forest invaded by bamboos, to supply fuelwood for railway engines. Yet this aversion for eucalyptus trees seems unwarranted given the convincing results of the <b>trial</b> <b>plantations</b> at Anamalazaotra, but also outside Madagascar, in Brazil, Kenya, Morocco and Ethiopia for example. Madagascar's capital, Tananarive, and its surroundings are now wooded thanks to the eucalyptus plantations (E. robusta, E. maculata) and their vigorous stump shoots that provide the local population with wood for cooking and construction. Eucalyptus plantations could also halt the erosion which is becoming widespread in Madagascar, particularly on the barren lavaka-scarred slopes of the Lake Alaotra basin. Madagascar's tree species are slow-growing, and eucalyptus has no equal for wood production. The use of eucalyptus can only be rejected for the purely sentimental reason that the species does not belong to the indigenous forest. Furthermore, in Madagascar's eastern forests, the climate is humid enough for an under-storey to develop and thus prevent erosion. Finally, it is to be deplored that naturalist societies should wish to challenge the one colonial service that is directly acting against for¬est destruction by listing certain areas for protection, fighting wildfires, protecting useful species and carrying out rehabilitation work. Attempting to discredit the forests service is ultimately harmful to the conservation of Madagascar's forests. Abstract adapted by the editorial team. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
