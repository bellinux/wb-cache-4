40|$|Homogeneous charge {{compression}} ignition (HCCI) engines {{have the benefit}} of high efficiency with low emissions of nitrogen oxides and particulates. These benefits are due to the autoignition process of the dilute mixture of fuel and air during compression. However, because there is no direct ignition trigger, control of ignition is inherently more difficult than in standard internal combustion engines. This difficulty necessitates that a feedback controller be used to keep the engine at a desired (efficient) setpoint in the face of disturbances. Because of the nonlinear autoignition process, the sensitivity of ignition changes with the operating point. Thus, gain scheduling is required to cover the entire operating range of the engine. Controller tuning can therefore be a time intensive process. With the goal of reducing the time to tune the controller, we use extremum seeking (ES) to tune the parameters of various forms of combustion <b>timing</b> <b>controllers.</b> Additionally, in this dissertation we demonstrate how ES can be used for the determination of an optimal combustion timing setpoint of an experimental HCCI engine. The use of ES has the benefit of achieving both optimal setpoint (for maximizing the engine efficiency) and controller parameter tuning tasks quickly. The lack of a direct combustion trigger makes control of combustion timing during transients especially challenging. To aid in HCCI engine control during transients, we have developed a model {{that can be used to}} derive a controller for a thermally-managed, gasoline and natural gas fueled HCCI engine. The model uses an ignition threshold derived from detailed chemical kinetic simulations of HCCI engine combustion to provide an estimate for the combustion timing. The ignition threshold is a function of both temperature and pressure. An estimate of the residual gas fraction from the previous cycle can also be obtained, which is essential information due to the strong temperature sensitivity of HCCI ignition. This model allows the synthesis of nonlinear control laws, which can be utilized for control of an HCCI engine during transient...|$|R

Secondly, a similar result is produced for timetriggered CAN (TTCAN), a version of CAN based on timedriven schedule. Thirdly, these analyses are applied to an example message set and used to discuss the dependability of event-triggered and time-triggered communication in the presence of electromagnetic interference.

For {{the past}} 10 {{years it has}} become clear that {{biological}} movement is made up of sub-routine type blocks, or motor primitives, with a central <b>controller</b> <b>timing</b> the activation of these blocks, creating synergies of muscle activation. This paper shows {{that it is possible to}} use a factorial hidden Markov model to infer primitives in handwriting data.

Also, the variation in the data can to a large extent be explained by timing variation in the triggering of the primitives. Once an appropriate set of primitives has been inferred, the characters can be represented as a set of timings of primitive activations, along with variances, giving a very compact representation of the character. Separating the motor system into a motor primitive part, and a timing control gives us a possible insight into how we might create scribbles on paper. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Since {{centralized}} control of urban networks with detailed modeling approaches is computationally complex, devel-oping efficient hierarchical control strategies based on aggregate modeling {{is of great}} importance. The dynamics of a heteroge-neous large-scale urban network is modeled as R homogeneous regions with the macroscopic fundamental diagrams (MFDs) representation. The MFD provides for homogeneous network regions a unimodal, low-scatter relationship between network vehicle density and network space-mean flow. In this paper, the optimal hybrid control problem for an R-region MFD network is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear optimization problem, where two types of controllers are introduced: 1) perimeter controllers and 2) switching signal <b>timing</b> plans <b>controllers.</b> The perimeter controllers are located {{on the border between}} the regions, as they manipulate the transfer flows between them, while the switching controllers influence the dynamics of the urban regions, as they define the shape of the MFDs and as a result affect the internal flows within each region. Moreover, to decrease the computational complexity due to the nonlinear and nonconvex nature of the optimization problem, we reformulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem utilizing piecewise affine approximation techniques. Two different approaches for transformation of the original model and building up MILP problems are presented, and the performances of the approximated methods along with the original problem formulation are evaluated and compared for different traffic scenarios of a two-region urban case study.

This approach combines real-time simulation and analysis for best controller design and verification under worst-case timing. I...|$|R

5000|$|There {{is a large}} {{spectrum}} of asynchronous design styles, with tradeoffs between robustness and performance (and other parameters such as power). The choice of design style depends on the application target: reliability/ease-of-design vs. speed. The most robust designs use 'delay-insensitive circuits', whose operation is correct regardlessof gate and wire delays; however, only limited useful systems can be designed with this style. Slightly less robust, but much more useful, are quasi-delay-insensitive circuits (also known as speed-independent circuits), such as delay-insensitive minterm synthesis, which operate correctly regardless of gate delays; however, wires at each fanout point must be tuned for roughly equal delays. Less robust but faster circuits, requiring simple localized one-sided <b>timing</b> constraints, include <b>controllers</b> using fundamental-mode operation (i.e. with setup/hold requirements on when new inputs can be received), and bundled datapaths using matched delays (see below).

40|$|The {{overhead}} of DRAM refresh {{is increasing}} with each density generation. To help offset {{some of this}} overhead, JEDEC designed the modern Auto-Refresh command with a highly optimized architecture internal to the DRAM-an architecture that violates the <b>timing</b> rules external <b>controllers</b> must observe and obey during normal operation. Numerous refresh-reduction schemes manually refresh the DRAM row-by-row, eliminating unnecessary refreshes to improve both energy and performance of the DRAM. However, {{it has been shown}} that modern Auto-Refresh is incompatible with these schemes, that their manual refreshing of specified rows through explicit Activate and Precharge precludes them from exploiting the architectural optimizations available internally for Auto-Refresh operations. This paper shows that various DRAM timing parameters, which should be followed during normal DRAM operations can be reduced for performing Refresh operation, and by reverse engineering those internal timing parameters at system-init time an external memory controller can use them in conjunction with individual Activate and Precharge commands, thereby reducing the performance overhead afforded Auto-Refresh, while imultaneously supporting row-by-row refresh reduction schemes. Through physical experiments and measurement, we find that our optimized scheme reduces tRFC by up to 45 % compared to the already highly-optimized Auto-Refresh mechanism. It is also 10 % more energy-efficient and 50 % more performance-efficient than the non-optimized row-by-row refresh. Further evaluations done by simulating future 16 Gb DDR 4 devices show how the reduction in tRFC improves the application performance and energy efficiency. The proposed technique enhances all of the existing refresh-optimization schemes that use row-by-row refresh, and it does so without requiring any modification to the DRAM or DRAM protocol...|$|R

A real time simulation is being conducted at Ames to investigate how FMS arrivals and approach transitions - with and without the support of CTAS tools - effect the flow of arriving traffic within TRACER airspace and the controllers' task performance. Four conditions will be investigated and compared to today's technique of controlling traffic with tactical vectoring: 1. FMS arrivals and approach transitions are available for controllers to issue to equipped aircraft - traffic permitting; 2. Speed advisories that match CTAS' runway balancing and sequencing plan are displayed to Feeder controllers; 3.
