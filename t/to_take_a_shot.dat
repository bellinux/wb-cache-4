5|$|Before {{the second}} half, no substitutions {{were made by}} either teams as Galatasaray kicked-off the match. During the third minute, Vieira picked Parlour, but his shot hit {{the outside of the}} goal. Galatasaray almost scored the opening goal, when Okan Buruk played in Hakan Şükür, whose shot hit the right post. Arsenal {{attempted}} to strike, with Sylvinho passing Hagi, and finding Henry, who in turn put in a cross for Keown, only for his shot to go over. Later throughout the match, Parlour sent a long ball into the Galatasaray midfield, but no Arsenal player was there to pick up the ball. A free-kick was given to Bergkamp after a foul on Overmars, which was cleared with a Popescu header. Galatasaray attempted an attack on the counter – Capone gave the ball to Hagi, who lost his balance while preparing <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot.</b> After receiving a pass, Hagi put in a wide cross for Şükür, but he was denied a shot on target after a clearance. Arsenal had another chance, when Henry snatched the ball from Korkmaz, and entered the penalty area, only to see his shot to go off target.|$|E
5|$|Within {{a minute}} of Chelsea kicking off the match, Le Saux was booked for a {{challenge}} on Lauren. Arsenal were awarded the first corner {{of the game in}} the eight minutes later, but nothing came out of it as Adams fouled Mario Melchiot in the penalty box. The opening half-hour was mostly event-free, with neither side dominating and few goalscoring opportunities fashioned. Chelsea adopted a tactic of narrowing the pitch and using little width, which sedated Arsenal's typically fluent football. Guðjohnsen tested the Arsenal defence by making dangerous runs, but one in the 12th minute was ruled as a foul. Arsenal's first chance came a minute later when Henry used his pace to run towards the Chelsea goal. He set up Sylvain Wiltord, whose shot was blocked by Desailly. Vieira struggled to match the energetic performance of his opponent Frank Lampard and in the 17th minute Vieira's careless pass was intercepted by the England midfielder. Lampard decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot,</b> forcing a save from Seaman. Four minutes later Vieira started a move which almost gave Arsenal the lead. A ball over the top found Bergkamp in the Chelsea area, but he guided his header just wide. In the 26th minute Vieira was awarded the final's first yellow card for a foul on Guðjohnsen. A confrontation between Melchiot and Fredrik Ljungberg occurred in the 33rd minute, but referee Mike Riley decided not to brandish a card, instead choosing to have a few words with the players. Campbell's failed clearance a minute later presented Guðjohnsen with goal-scoring opportunity, but he hit his shot directly at Seaman. As the match drew nearer to half-time, Arsenal started to find their rhythm and played their usual passing game. They created the best chance of the first half, when a cross from Wiltord found Lauren, who headed the ball just over the crossbar. Hasselbaink, largely ineffective as he was blighted with injury, combined with Guðjohnsen to split open the Arsenal defence, but the move was halted as Riley called offside.|$|E
25|$|The {{style of}} the game is quick, {{accelerated}} by the close confines of the floor and a shot clock. The shot clock requires the attacking team <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> on goal within 30 seconds of gaining possession of the ball. In addition, players must advance the ball from their own defensive end to the offensive side of the floor within 10 seconds.|$|E

25|$|Penalties {{are awarded}} for major {{infringements}} or foul {{play and the}} team that receives them can choose <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> at goal {{in an attempt to}} score three points. They can also use the penalty to kick for territory or tap the ball and continue running it. Three points are awarded if a team member drop kicks a goal during general play.|$|E
25|$|In The Dark Flight Down by Marcus Sedgwick, Chapter 5 {{describes}} {{a game of}} Snapdragon being played during the wake of Director Korp. The rules are described as a drinking game, whereby should a player drop the raisin, they have <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot.</b> Boy recalls Valerian playing (and winning) the game with absinthe as the alcohol which burns, including how he used to show off as the game wore on.|$|E
25|$|The {{best thing}} {{was simply the}} {{privilege}} {{and the challenge of}} being able <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> at the first female captain, transcending stereotypes that I was very familiar with. I was able to do that in front of millions of viewers. That was a remarkable experience—and it continues to resonate. The downside of that is also that it continues to resonate, and threatens to eclipse all else in one's long career if one does not up the ante and stay at it, in a way that may not ordinarily be necessary. I have to work at changing and constantly reinventing myself in a way that probably would not have happened had Star Trek not come along. I knew that going in, and I think that all of the perks attached to this journey have been really inexpressively great. So the negatives are small.|$|E

25|$|At the 2002 Winter Olympics, {{having been}} {{selected}} by Gretzky to captain the roster, Lemieux led the Canadian men's team into Salt Lake City, United States. The team {{had failed to}} win a {{gold medal at the}} Olympics in fifty years but were still considered favourites to win. Lemieux was second to Joe Sakic in team scoring with six points in five games, and led the team to gold by defeating the United States 5-2 in the final game. Lemieux showcased his amazing hockey intelligence during the gold medal game against the United States. With Team Canada trailing 1-0 in the first period, Lemieux made {{one of the most famous}} and savvy plays in Olympic hockey history. After a cross-ice pass from Lemieux in the neutral zone, Canadian defenceman Chris Pronger carried the puck across the blue line into the American zone, and fired a pass across the zone. Lemieux then faked like he was receiving the pass and proceeded <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> at the net, all while letting the puck slide through his legs, knowing he had forward Paul Kariya streaking behind him. Lemieux's fake caused American goalie Mike Richter to lunge in Lemieux's direction, and thus created a wide open net for Kariya to fire the puck in, as he received the pass from Pronger after Lemieux let it go to Kariya. During the tournament, his hip injury required several painkilling injections to keep him on the ice, and he only played one more NHL game after the Olympics before being lost for the season.|$|E
25|$|The first {{significant}} action {{was a free}} won by Dublin's Barry Cahill in the second minute. Cahill called forward his goalkeeper Stephen Cluxton <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot.</b> Cluxton's attempt drifted {{to the left and}} wide. In the sixth minute Donegal's Christy Toye was hauled down by two Dublin players. Michael Murphy sent the resulting free wide. In the seventh minute Dublin's Alan Brogan shot spectacularly wide. A high challenge from Dublin's James McCarthy led to a yellow card in the eight minute. Colm McFadden scored the resulting free from inside the 45-metre line to give the opening point of the match to Donegal. In the tenth minute Dublin's Bernard Brogan ran through on the Donegal goal but his shot past Paul Durcan went to the left and wide. He made up for this two minutes later when he equalised by putting over Dublin's opening point from a free. The first 14 minutes of the match featured 12 frees. In the twenty-first minute Dublin's Bernard Brogan again attempted to score a point but his effort went to the right and wide. In the game's twenty-fourth minute Ryan Bradley restored Donegal's lead, evading the efforts of most of Dublin's players to send the ball between the posts and score the first point from play. One minute later, Bernard Brogan sent over a free to bring the game level again. In the twenty-ninth minute Kevin Cassidy sent Donegal into the lead again with a point from play via the outside of his boot. Colm McFadden added another point from play a minute later to send Donegal into a two-point lead for the first time. One minute after that, Alan Brogan sent another effort to the right and wide. Diarmuid Connolly and Cluxton added to Dublin's wide tally just before the break. Dublin did not score from play in the first half.|$|E

500|$|The saucer in the {{original}} game design was supposed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> {{as soon as it}} appeared. This action was altered so there would be a delay before the saucer shoots, leading to [...] "lurking" [...] from players. Lurking is a strategy in which the player uses thrust to keep the ship in motion, leaves 1 or 2 asteroids undamaged, and hunts for saucers, allowing the player to pick off as many 1,000-point UFOs as possible and play indefinitely on a single credit. Since the saucer could only shoot directly at the player's position on the screen, the player could [...] "hide" [...] {{at the opposite end of}} the screen and shoot across the screen boundary, while remaining relatively safe. Complaints from operators losing revenue due to lurking led to the creation of an EPROM restricting such chances. Usage of the names of Saturday Night Live characters [...] "Mr. Bill" [...] and [...] "Sluggo" [...] to refer to the saucers in an Esquire article about the game led to Logg receiving a cease and desist letter from a lawyer with the [...] "Mr. Bill Trademark." ...|$|E
500|$|By June 1917, Dallas had {{achieved}} over 20victories in aerial combat. This experience, and his leadership ability, {{led to his}} appointment as commanding officer of No.1 Naval Squadron on 23June 1917. The unit {{had been forced to}} cut back its operational strength from 18 aircraft to 15 due to lack of pilot replacements and a shortage of spare parts for the aging Triplanes. It had also moved airfields, to an unprepared site at Bailleul. As a leader, Dallas made a point of shepherding new pilots through their first flights, and even setting them up with their first victories by manoeuvring enemy aircraft into a good position for the rookie <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot.</b> [...] On the ground, he proved to be an efficient organiser, designing and directing construction of the new air base. It was also during this time that he wrote a treatise on air combat tactics, extracts of which have survived. Both the air base layout and the treatise displayed his talent as a sketch artist. On 2November, No.1 Squadron moved airfields once more, to Middle Aerodrome, which put it back under overall RNAS control. The unit received its first eight new Sopwith Camels on 9November as replacements for the Triplanes. On 11November, Dallas was again mentioned in despatches, this time by Field Marshal Haig. After gaining its full complement of Camels, No.1 Squadron was transferred to England, and took up home defence duties at Dover. On 16February 1918, Dallas led his squadron back to France, where it was based at Téteghem, supporting units on operations along the Belgian coast. He commanded it for another six weeks, until 31March.|$|E

2500|$|... three-second rule in basketball. If you {{are passing}} through the 8-meter or {{following}} your offender, then you will not get called for 3 seconds.

2500|$|The goalkeeper {{also may}} try to {{distract}} the penalty taker, as the expectation is on the penalty taker to succeed, hence more pressure on the penalty taker, making him more vulnerable to mistakes. For example, in the 2008 UEFA Champions League Final between Manchester United and Chelsea, United goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar pointed to his left side when Nicolas Anelka stepped up <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> in the penalty shoot out. This was because all of Chelsea's penalties went to the left. Anelka's shot instead went to Van der Sar's right, which was saved. Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar used a method of distracting the players called the [...] "spaghetti legs" [...] trick to help his club defeat Roma to win the 1984 European Cup. This tactic was emulated in the 2005 UEFA Champions League Final, which Liverpool also won, by Liverpool goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek, helping his team defeat Milan.|$|E
2500|$|If a team {{is awarded}} a penalty {{they can choose}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> at goal, kick the ball or tap the ball with their foot and run it. A {{successful}} shot at goal scores three points. The opposing team must stand still with their hands beside their sides until after the ball has been kicked at the goal. If the ball is kicked into touch the team that kicked it gets the throw in at the resulting line-out and it is always taken where the ball crosses the line. Free kicks are similar, except a shot at goal {{can not be taken}} and if the ball is kicked into touch the kicking team does not receive the throw at the ensuing line-out. There is also no gain in ground from the free kick if kicked directly into touch, unless it was taken from behind the kicking team's 22-metre line. Opposition players can also try and charge down free kicks as soon as the kicker makes a move to kick. The captain can always choose to take a scrum from a penalty or free kick. A player can claim a mark by catching the ball directly from a kick (except a kick-off) inside their own 22 and shouting [...] "mark" [...] at the same time. The player that claimed the mark cannot be tackled and is awarded a free kick.|$|E
