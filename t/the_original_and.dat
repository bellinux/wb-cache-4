Kameo was included in Rare Replay, an August 2015 compilation of 30 Rare titles for the Xbox One, alongside documentary-style videos about the game's development and its planned sequel. The latter was canceled {{after a few months}} of production due to both poor sales of <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>and</b> Microsoft's new focus on games for its Kinect peripheral.|$|E

5|$|A second Overmind {{is created}} in Brood War, formed from {{the merging of}} several cerebrates.

The second Overmind is captured and drugged by the United Earth Directorate, who use its control of the Swarm to bolster its own forces in the Koprulu Sector, but it is ultimately slain by Zeratul.|$|E

5|$|Although Mazariegos {{had managed}} to {{establish}} his new provincial capital without armed conflict, excessive Spanish demands for labour and supplies soon provoked the locals into rebellion.

5|$|Although Mazariegos {{had managed}} to {{establish}} his new provincial capital without armed conflict, excessive Spanish demands for labour and supplies soon provoked the locals into rebellion. The colonists demanded that the Indians supply them with food, wood for construction and firewood, and that they build new houses for the Spanish. In addition, pigs had been introduced by the Spanish and were causing great damage to the natives' maize fields. In August 1528, Mazariegos replaced the existing encomenderos with his friends and allies; the natives, seeing the Spanish isolated and witnessing the hostility between <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>and</b> newly arrived settlers, took this opportunity to rebel and refused to supply their new masters.

5|$|Although Watts {{received}} many offers {{to buy the}} painting, he had agreed to donate his most important works to the nation and felt {{it would be inappropriate}} not to include Hope. Consequently, later in 1886 Watts and his assistant Cecil Schott painted a second version. On its completion Watts sold <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>and</b> donated the copy to the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert Museum); thus, this second version is better known than the original. He painted at least two further versions for private sale.|$|E
5|$|Although the tree-ring {{analysis}} of the Philadelphia painting firmly places it in van Eyck's workshop, the technical evidence fails to prove indisputably whether van Eyck or a workshop member painted it. Until the early 1980s {{it was thought that}} the Philadelphia panel was <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>and</b> the Turin panel a copy, but x-ray analysis revealed a highly developed and sophisticated design underneath the paint that is accepted as by Jan van Eyck's hand. Infrared reflectography further disclosed extensive underdrawings beneath the original paint; the artist even made alterations to the composition after laying down the underdrawings and completing the painting. The underdrawings are typical of van Eyck's work and similar to those found in the Ghent Altarpiece, thereby, according to Luber, tying the Turin version to van Eyck.|$|E
