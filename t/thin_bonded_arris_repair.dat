40|$|Pavements {{have been}} {{overlaid}} with <b>thin</b> <b>bonded</b> portland cement concrete (PCC) for several years. These projects have had traffic detoured {{for a period}} of 5 - 10 days. These detours are unacceptable to the traveling public and result in severe criticism. The use of <b>thin</b> <b>bonded</b> fast track overlay was promoted to allow a <b>thin</b> <b>bonded</b> PCC overlay with minimal disruption of local traffic. This project demonstrated the concept of using one lane of the roadway to maintain traffic while the overlay was placed on the other and then with the rapid strength gain of the fast track concrete, the construction and local traffic is maintained on the newly placed, <b>thin</b> <b>bonded</b> overlay. The goals of this project were: 1. Traffic usage immediately after placement and finishing. 2. Reduce traffic disruption on a single lane to less than 5 hours. 3. Reduce traffic disruption on a given section of two-lane roadway to less than 2 days. 4. The procedure must be economically viable and competitive with existing alternatives. 5. Design life for new construction equivalent to or in excess of conventional pavements. 6. A 20 year minimum design life for rehabilitated pavements...|$|R

40|$|<b>Thin</b> <b>bonded</b> {{films have}} many {{applications}} (i. e. in information {{storage and processing}} systems, and etc.). In many cases, <b>thin</b> <b>bonded</b> films {{are in a state}} of residual tension, which can lead to film cracking and crack extension in one layer often accompanies failure in whole systems. In this pa-per, we analyze a channel crack advanced throughout thickness of an elastic <b>thin</b> film <b>bonded</b> to a dissimilar semi-infinite substrate material via finite element method (FEM). In order to simplify modeling, the problem is idealized as plane strain and a two-dimensional model of a film bonded to an elastic substrate is proposed for simulating channel crack in thin elastic film. Film is mod-eled by common 4 -node and substrate by infinite 4 -node meshes. The stress intensity factor (SIF) for cracked thin film has been obtained as a function of elastic mismatch between the substrate and the film. The results indicate that in elastic mismatch state, SIF is more than match state. On the other hand, mismatch state is more sensitive to crack than match state. And SIF has also in...|$|R

40|$|The Iowa {{road system}} has {{approximately}} 13, 000 miles of Portland Cement Concrete Pavements, {{many of which}} are reaching the stage where major rehabilitation is required. Age, greater than anticipated traffic, heavier loads and deterioration related to coarse aggregate in the original pavement are some of the reasons that these pavements have reached this level of distress. One method utilized to rehabilitate distressed or underdesigned PCC pavements is the <b>thin</b> <b>bonded</b> Portland Cement Concrete overlay. Since the introduction of <b>thin</b> <b>bonded</b> overlays on highway pavements in 1973, the concrete paving industry has made progress in reducing the construction costs of this rehabilitation technique. With the advent of the shotblast machine, surface preparation costs have decreased from over $ 4. 00 per square yard to most recently $ 1. 42 per square yard.

40|$|<b>Thin</b> <b>bonded</b> {{concrete}} overlay {{are commonly}} used nowadays in repairing concrete structures. Nevertheless, {{the performance of the}} structural system (repaired structure) depends on the sound bond behaviour between old and new concretes. Frequently, adhesives based on epoxy resins provide this liaison. In this work the behaviour of three different types of based epoxy adhesives was observed in the bonding of different strength concrete class. Samples for backscattered scanning electron microscopy (BSE) were prepared from extracted pieces - containing the bonding layer - of non reinforced concrete slabs overlaid with <b>thin</b> <b>bonded</b> steel fibre reinforced concrete (SFRC) layer. Different features of each bonding layer epoxy resin type which may explain differentiate mechanical pull-off results as well as failure modes were observed.

Therefore, although the stress calculation itself seems to favour a <b>thinner</b> <b>bond</b> coat, this will lead to deeper vertical cracks.

It has no mechanical strength (other than the surface tension of the grease and the resulting adhesive effect) and will need an external mechanical fixation mechanism.
