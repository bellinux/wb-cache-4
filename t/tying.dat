40|$|AbstractAngiopoietin- 1 (Ang 1) and Ang 2 are ligands for the {{receptor}} {{tyrosine kinase}} <b>Tie</b> 2. Structural {{data suggest that the}} two ligands bind <b>Tie</b> 2 similarly. However, in endothelial cells Ang 1 activates <b>Tie</b> 2 whereas Ang 2 can act as an apparent antagonist. In addition, each ligand exhibits distinct kinetics of release following binding. These observations suggest that additional factors influence function and binding of angiopoietins with receptors in the cellular context. Previous work has shown that Ang 1 binding and activation of <b>Tie</b> 2 are inhibited by <b>Tie</b> 1, a related receptor that complexes with <b>Tie</b> 2 in cells. In this study we have investigated binding of Ang 1 and Ang 2 to <b>Tie</b> 2 in endothelial cells. In contrast to Ang 1, binding of Ang 2 to <b>Tie</b> 2 was found to be not affected by <b>Tie</b> 1. Neither PMA-induced <b>Tie</b> 1 ectodomain cleavage nor suppression of <b>Tie</b> 1 expression by siRNA affected the ability of Ang 2 to bind <b>Tie</b> 2. Analysis of the level of <b>Tie</b> 1 co-immunoprecipitating with angiopoietin-bound <b>Tie</b> 2 demonstrated that Ang 2 can bind <b>Tie</b> 2 in <b>Tie</b> 2 :Tie 1 complexes whereas Ang 1 preferentially binds non-complexed <b>Tie</b> 2. Stimulation of <b>Tie</b> 1 ectodomain cleavage did not increase the agonist activity of Ang 2 for <b>Tie</b> 2. Similarly, the <b>Tie</b> 2 -agonist activity of Ang 2 was not affected by siRNA suppression of <b>Tie</b> 1 expression. Consistent with previous reports, loss of <b>Tie</b> 1 ectodomain enhanced the agonist activity of Ang 1 for <b>Tie</b> 2. Importantly, Ang 2 was still able to antagonize the elevated Ang 1 -activation of <b>Tie</b> 2 that occurs on <b>Tie</b> 1 ectodomain loss. Together these data demonstrate that Ang 1 and Ang 2 bind differently to <b>Tie</b> 2 at the cell surface and this is controlled by <b>Tie</b> 1. This differential regulation of angiopoietin binding allows control of <b>Tie</b> 2 activation response to Ang 1 without affecting Ang 2 agonist activity and maintains the ability of Ang 2 to antagonize even the enhanced Ang 1 activation of <b>Tie</b> 2 that occurs on loss of <b>Tie</b> 1 ectodomain. This provides a mechanism by which signalling through <b>Tie</b> 2 can be modified by stimuli in the cellular microenvironment...|$|R

40|$|The <b>Tie</b> 1 {{receptor}} {{tyrosine kinase}} was isolated over a decade ago, but so far no ligand {{has been found to}} activate this receptor. Here, we have examined the potential of angiopoietins, ligands for the related <b>Tie</b> 2 receptor, to mediate <b>Tie</b> 1 activation. We show that a soluble Ang 1 chimeric protein, COMP-Ang 1, stimulates <b>Tie</b> 1 phosphorylation in endothelial cells with similar kinetics and angiopoietin dose dependence when compared with <b>Tie</b> 2. The phosphorylation of overexpressed <b>Tie</b> 1 was weakly induced by COMP-Ang 1 also in transfected cells that do not express <b>Tie</b> 2. When cotransfected, <b>Tie</b> 2 formed heteromeric complexes with <b>Tie</b> 1, enhanced <b>Tie</b> 1 activation, and induced phosphorylation of a kinase-inactive <b>Tie</b> 1 in a ligand-dependent manner. <b>Tie</b> 1 phosphorylation was also induced by native Ang 1 and Ang 4, although less efficiently than with COMP-Ang 1.

40|$|A {{critical}} role for <b>Tie</b> 1, an orphan endothelial receptor, in blood vessel morphogenesis {{has emerged from}} mutant mouse studies. Moreover, it was recently demonstrated that certain angiopoietin (Ang) family members can activate <b>Tie</b> 1. We report here that Ang 1 induces <b>Tie</b> 1 phosphorylation in endothelial cells. <b>Tie</b> 1 phosphorylation was, however, <b>Tie</b> 2 dependent because 1) Ang 1 failed to induce <b>Tie</b> 1 phosphorylation when <b>Tie</b> 2 was down-regulated in endothelial cells; 2) <b>Tie</b> 1 phosphorylation was induced {{in the absence of}} Ang 1 by either a constitutively active form of <b>Tie</b> 2 or a <b>Tie</b> 2 agonistic antibody; 3) in HEK 293 cells Ang 1 phosphorylated a form of <b>Tie</b> 1 without kinase activity when coexpressed with <b>Tie</b> 2, and Ang 1 failed to phosphorylate <b>Tie</b> 1 when coexpressed with kinase-defective <b>Tie</b> 2. Ang 1 -mediated AKT and 42 / 44 MAPK phosphorylation is predominantly <b>Tie</b> 2 mediated, and <b>Tie</b> 1 down-regulates this pathway. Finally, based on a battery of in vitro and in vivo data, we show that a main role for <b>Tie</b> 1 is to modulate blood vessel morphogenesis by virtue of its ability to down-regulate <b>Tie</b> 2 -driven signaling and endothelial survival. Our new observations help to explain why <b>Tie</b> 1 null embryos have increased capillary densities in several organ systems.
