5|$|After the August 1943 Quebec Agreement merged the British and American {{atomic bomb}} projects, Mark Oliphant persuaded the Admiralty to release Massey {{to work on}} the Manhattan Project. In November 1943, Massey set out with Oliphant for the Radiation Laboratory at the University of California in Berkeley in a B-24 Liberator bomber. The Radiation Laboratory's part was to develop an {{electromagnetic}} isotope separation process. Massey was in charge of its Theoretical Group, which included American David Bohm and Australian Eric Burhop. They studied <b>the</b> <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> electric discharges in magnetic fields, today known as Bohm diffusion, and studied the ionization of uranium compounds used as feed in the electromagnetic uranium enrichment process such as uranium tetrachloride (UCl4) and uranium hexafluoride (UF6). Oliphant returned to Britain in March 1945, and was replaced as head of the British mission in Berkeley by Massey. Wartime papers produced by the group were collected and published in <b>The</b> <b>Characteristics</b> <b>of</b> Electrical Discharges in Magnetic Fields (1949).|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} that for any finite/co-finite set of primes there exists a network which has a rate 1 {{solution}} {{if and only if}} <b>the</b> <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> finite field belongs to the given set. We generalize this result to show that for any positive rational number k/n, and for any given finite/co-finite set of primes, there exists a network which has a rate k/n fractional linear network coding solution if and only if <b>the</b> <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> finite field belongs to the given set. For this purpose we construct two networks: N_ 1 and N_ 2; the network N_ 1 has a k/n fractional linear network coding solution if and only if <b>the</b> <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> finite field belongs to the given finite set of primes, and the network N_ 2 has a k/n fractional linear network coding solution if and only if <b>the</b> <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> finite field belongs to the given co-finite set of primes. Recently, a method has been introduced where characteristic-dependent linear rank inequalities are produced from networks whose linear coding capacity depends on <b>the</b> <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> finite field. By employing this method on the networks N_ 1 and N_ 2, we construct two classes of characteristic-dependent linear rank inequalities. For any given set of primes, the first class contains an inequality which holds if <b>the</b> <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> finite field does not belong to the given set of primes but may not hold otherwise; the second class contains an inequality which holds if <b>the</b> <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> finite field belongs to the given set of primes but may not hold otherwise. We then use these inequalities to obtain an upper-bound on the linear coding capacity of N_ 1 and N_ 2. Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv: 1610. 0800...|$|R
