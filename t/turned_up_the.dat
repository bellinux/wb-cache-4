5|$|The {{episode was}} a coup for Channel 4, who erected crush {{barriers}} outside their building {{to hold back}} fans when the cast arrived for a press conference (though no fans actually <b>turned</b> <b>up).</b> <b>The</b> broadcaster also commissioned a behind-the-scenes program from Princess Productions. Hosted by British television personality Johnny Vaughan, The One Where Johnny Makes Friends features comedic tongue-in-cheek interviews with all six main cast (Vaughan contacted Kudrow by payphone, claiming that he couldn't make international calls from his dressing room) and was broadcast on Channel 4 on May 6, 1998.|$|E
5|$|Psittacosaurus {{was first}} {{described}} as a genus in 1923, by Henry Fairfield Osborn. He named the type species P. mongoliensis, for the location of its discovery in Mongolia, placing it in the new family Psittacosauridae. Remains of this dinosaur were first discovered the year before, on the third American Museum of Natural History expedition to the Gobi Desert of Mongolia, {{when one of the}} expedition's drivers found the type specimen (AMNH6254), which preserves a nearly complete skull, as well as a post cranial skeleton lacking sections of the limbs. This same expedition <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> remains of many other famous Mongolian dinosaurs, including Protoceratops, Oviraptor, and Velociraptor. Many later expeditions by various combinations of Mongolian, Russian, Chinese, American, Polish, Japanese, and Canadian paleontologists also recovered specimens from throughout Mongolia and northern China. In these areas, Psittacosaurus mongoliensis fossils are found in most sedimentary strata dating to the Aptian to Albian stages of the Early Cretaceous Period, or approximately 125 to 100Ma (million years ago). Fossil remains of over 75 individuals have been recovered, including nearly 20 complete skeletons with skulls. Individuals of all ages are known, from hatchlings less than 13centimetres (5in) long, to very old adults reaching nearly 2metres (6.5ft) in length.|$|E

25|$|Before the team's next {{match at}} NYRB, Andrea Mancini was {{released}} {{to join the}} New York Cosmos, freeing up an international roster slot, and allowing the team to activate Kamara, who had sat out over six weeks with a hamstring injury. Without Acosta, United seemed hopelessly overmatched by the potent NYRB in a match scheduled to honor the 15th anniversary of the September 11th attacks. Indeed, the Red Bulls went ahead {{in the first half}} following a Nyarko defensive turnover that led to a historic goal by Bradley Wright-Phillips, giving BWP the most goals over a 3-year stretch by any player in league history. In the second half, Wright-Phillips caught Hamid leaning towards the far post and slammed it past him to the near side, giving NY a 2-0 lead. The New York team only <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> pressure, but Hamid responded with multiple highlight reel saves to keep his team in the match. In the 89th minute, a loose ball in the box came to Birnbaum, and he delivered with a shot that narrowed the gap to 2-1. Then, in the 5th minute of stoppage time, a loose ball in the box came to Neagle for an easy tap-in, and United emerged with a shocking draw against the run of play. The result {{was the first time that}} NYRB had ever surrendered a 2-goal lead in Red Bull Arena.|$|E

500|$|Storm and the Hurricanes {{were the}} {{headlining}} {{group at the}} first [...] "Beat Night", in the Orrell Park Ballroom, in March 1961. They were also invited for a season at the Butlins camp in Skegness in Lincolnshire. Sam Leach (a Liverpool promoter) arranged a series of dance nights at the Palais Ballroom in Aldershot, starting on 9 December 1961. The first Saturday featured The Beatles, but as the local newspaper forgot to run the advertisement only 18 people <b>turned</b> <b>up.</b> <b>The</b> second Saturday was arranged for Rory Storm and the Hurricanes to perform, and as it was advertised this time, 210 people paid to get in.

500|$|Manohla Dargis, whilst {{generally}} ambivalent {{towards the}} film, called the lead performances {{one of its}} principal attractions. [...] "With their volume <b>turned</b> <b>up,</b> <b>the</b> appealing, impeccably professional Mr. Firth and Mr. Rush rise to the acting occasion by twinkling and growling as their characters warily circle each other before settling into the therapeutic swing of things and unknowingly preparing for the big speech that partly gives the film its title," [...] she wrote. The Daily Telegraph called Guy Pearce's performance as Edward VIII [...] "formidable ... with glamour, charisma and utter self-absorption". Empire said he played the role well as [...] "a flash harry flinty enough to shed a nation for a wife." [...] The New York Times thought {{he was able to}} create [...] "a thorny tangle of complications in only a few abbreviated scenes". Hooper praised the actor in the DVD commentary, saying he [...] "nailed" [...] the 1930s royal accent. Richard Corliss of Time magazine named Colin Firth's performance one of the Top 10 Movie Performances of 2010.|$|E
500|$|Superior Publishers, however, {{defied the}} ban, while also {{moving into the}} U.S. market. Watchdogs <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> heat, and in 1953 a {{distributor}} {{was found guilty of}} distributing obscenities. Some of Superior's titles found themselves in Fredric Wertham's notorious and influential diatribe on the influence comics had on juvenile delinquency, Seduction of the Innocent, published in 1954. The United States Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency, established in 1953, had public hearings a few months later, and called upon Kamloops. BC Member of Parliament E. Davie Fulton, one of Superior publisher William Zimmerman's most outspoken enemies, as a witness. The Comics Code Authority was soon formed, and Superior, like fellow American publisher EC Comics, saw their sales dwindle throughout 1955. Prosecutions increased throughout Canada, with Superior successfully defending themselves in one, and another supposedly comics-related murder was reported in Westville, Nova Scotia. Superior shut its doors in 1956, and until the 1970s, English Canadian newsstand comic book publishing was no more, although a number of [...] "giveaway" [...] comics continued to be produced by Orville ' [...] Productions and Owen McCarron's Comic Book World, who produced the educational and cautionary comics for governments and corporations, aimed at kids and teens.|$|E

500|$|After {{working in}} Stampede {{for a while}} The Fabulous Kangaroos started to travel across the United States, {{headlining}} shows wherever they went due {{to their ability to}} rile up crowds with their heel (bad guy) tactics. On one occasion in August 1958, The Kangaroos, or [...] "Kangaroo Men" [...] as they were billed, nearly caused a riot in Madison Square Garden during a match against Antonino Rocca and Miguel P√©rez; the fans began to throw fruit and stones at them. After the match ended without a decisive winner, the promoters stepped in, <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> arena lights, and played the National Anthem to stop a potential riot. This was a common tactic used at the time by the New York promoters to prevent riots and help the heels leave the arena unharmed. Later that year, Costello and Heffernan started working for Dory Funk‚Äôs NWA Western States promotion based in Amarillo, Texas. Here, The Kangaroos won their first title as a team when they defeated Pepper Gomez and El Medico to win the Texas version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship on 17 November 1958. Their first title reign was short lived, however, as Pepper Gomez and Rito Romero defeated them to regain the titles two weeks later.|$|E
500|$|Loudwire's Mary Ouellette, who {{attended}} the same show, felt that Thirty Seconds to Mars emphatically invited the crowd into their self-proclaimed cult, conducting a [...] "straight up rock 'n' roll sermon", while Linkin Park took a different direction fueled by the [...] "latest in technology and good old-fashioned angst". She concluded in her review, [...] "Strangely enough, the combined forces made {{for one of the}} most memorable tours of the summer." [...] Andrej Ivanov from The Scene Magazine {{who attended}} the show in Montreal, gave a positive review and hailed Linkin Park's [...] "outstanding setlist" [...] and Thirty Seconds to Mars' musicianship. He also complimented special guest AFI for [...] "bringing it back to our angsty teenage years". Chris Riemenschneider of the Star Tribune, while praising Thirty Seconds to Mars' performance, gave a negative response to the set by Linkin Park, noticing that older tracks were abbreviated to make room for a drum solo and less impactful songs. In his review for The Arizona Republic, Ed Masley commended the set by Linkin Park featuring a [...] "well-chosen mixture of career-defining hits and album tracks" [...] and hailed the inspirational and charismatic performance by Thirty Seconds to Mars. Mary Bonney from LA Music Blog, reviewing the concert at the Hollywood Bowl, felt that the tour delivered an [...] "epic rock experience that <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> heat".|$|E
500|$|On 11 August 1910, American {{paleontologist}} Barnum Brown {{discovered the}} remains of a large group of Albertosaurus at another quarry alongside the Red Deer River. Because of the large number of bones and the limited time available, Brown's party did not collect every specimen, but made sure to collect remains from all of the individuals that they could identify in the bonebed. Among the bones deposited in the American Museum of Natural History collections in New York City are seven sets of right metatarsals, along with two isolated toe bones that did not match any of the metatarsals in size. This indicated the presence of at least nine individuals in the quarry. The Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology rediscovered the bonebed in 1997 and resumed fieldwork at the site, which is now located inside Dry Island Buffalo Jump Provincial Park. Further excavation from 1997 to 2005 <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> remains of 13 more individuals of various ages, including a diminutive two-year-old and a very old individual estimated at over [...] in length. None of these individuals are known from complete skeletons, and most are represented by remains in both museums. Excavations continued until 2008, when the minimum number of individuals present had been established at 12, on the basis of preserved elements that occur only once in a skeleton, and at 26 if mirrored elements were counted when differing in size due to ontogeny. A total of 1,128 Albertosaurus bones had been secured, the largest concentration of large theropod fossils known from the Cretaceous.|$|E

According to Gruff Rhys the band made separate videos for Rings Around the Worlds three singles as they saw the videos included on the DVD release of the album as [...] "pure art" [...] whereas they needed promotional music videos that were more like adverts for the songs. The video begins with {{a shot of the}} band in an all white room playing along to the track.

At one point, the band are shown in silhouette in homage to the cover of Hot Rocks 1964-1971 by The Rolling Stones. As the video ends, the camera pans back to show a television in a room with a man having a telephone conversation. The camera continues to pan back showing this image on a television on a shelf in a small room. The camera pans back through three more televisions, each showing an image of the last shot, ending with a TV in a wallpapered room next to an electric fire.
