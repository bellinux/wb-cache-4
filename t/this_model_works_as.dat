For models to be useful, they have to accurately depict the larger system that they are describing. A novel man-made system, known as an agrivoltaic structure, is being constructed at Biosphere 2 near Oracle, Arizona.

These two predictions were tested using low-tech solutions that are affordable for classroom teachers. Predictions were tested using water and scales to measure soil moisture; infrared guns to measure plant and panel temperature; and HOBO air temperature sensors. There was little quantitative data to support the claim that plants grew better in shade than sun; however, the model system is young and may need time to grow. While some observational evidence supported the second prediction, the data was not significant. Both sets of data appeared to be highly dependent on environmental factors, such as sun position.

40|$|This Master’s Thesis {{presents}} a privacy scheme for anonymous RFID payments {{applied to the}} car toll context. The scheme enables a fast and convenient way of collecting car toll, requiring no interaction between the toll and the car owner. Meanwhile, an anonymous and untraceable payment solution is provided. Additional properties given by the protocol are protection for the tag carrier against replay attacks and forged payments {{as well as the}} possibility to challenge invalid transactions. The payment scheme is based on RFID technology, providing limited computational resources. As these limitations restricts the cryptographic toolbox available to ensure the security of the scheme, finding a compromise between computational capacity and security has been {{at the heart of the}} work. The payment scheme builds on the pseudonym protocol introduced by David Molnar, Andrea Sopper and David Wagner, making use of pseudo random functions and a back-end system to interpret pseudonyms. Furthermore, we introduce a challenge-response protocol as well as pseudo random function signatures to ensure additional security properties. To formulate possible adversary attacks as well as define security requirements for the system an adversary <b>model</b> is presented. <b>This</b> <b>model</b> also <b>works</b> <b>as</b> a stance for the proofs verifying the same security requirements.

Janus particles half-coated {{with a metal}} such as platinum or gold are promising active particle systems for targeted drug delivery. Most studies of Janus active particles have been performed on planar surfaces. Active particle motion in curved surfaces such as single and double emulsion drops {{is yet to be}} explored and could offer a path for the fabrication of active particle clusters. The aim of this research was to design, fabricate and study two active particle systems that will serve as model systems for future studies of active particles in drops.

40|$|Contemporary {{social work}} {{with young people}} and their {{families}} is facing major challenges {{with the advent of}} the Internet and social media, particularly in the sphere of fostering. The identified challenges are concerned with issues of safeguarding that are related more often than not to threats outside of the familial home (Firmin, 2013). Another significant challenge includes the relevance of child protection processes and systems that are currently geared towards children under ten years of age (Gorin and Jobe, 2013; Hanson and Holmes, 2014; The Association of Directors of Children’s Services, 2013 and the Department of Education, 2014). It will be argued that the challenges outlined are being managed using a psychologically informed <b>model</b> of social <b>work</b> which is reliant upon theoretical approaches such as ecological, systems and attachment theories, all of which have a predisposition to individual pathology and the ability of the service users to change if the correct social work intervention is applied (Goodyer, 2012). <b>This</b> <b>model</b> of social <b>work</b> <b>as</b> it relates to fostered young people means that behaviours such as irresponsibility, immaturity and an inability to comprehend the possible consequences feed into the taken for granted assumption that there is a link between vulnerability and risk (Goodyer, 2012; Fursland, 2011; and Stephenson, 2009). This discussion paper will explore how risk and vulnerability involving fostered young people and their use of the Internet and social media is managed using a psychologically informed <b>model</b> of social <b>work.</b> <b>This</b> exploration will not only give attention to the manifestations of this type of practice as it relates to fostered children, there will also be a focus on the shortcomings of the model.

40|$|The care {{of chronic}} disease {{has become the}} main {{challenge}} for healthcare institutions around the world. As the incidence and prevalence of chronic diseases continue to increase, {{it is a big}} challenge for traditional hospital-based healthcare to meet requirements of patients. To meet the growing needs of patients, moving the front desk of healthcare from hospital to home is essential. Home-based healthcare for chronic disease involves many different organizations and healthcare providers. Therefore, there are interoperability problems for cooperation among the various organizations and healthcare providers to provide efficient and seamless home-based healthcare.   This thesis aims to point out an appropriate technical solution to interoperability problems in home-based healthcare. There are different levels of interoperability, such as pragmatic, semantic and syntactic. We explored alternative solutions specifically for syntactic interoperability. We started to identify the interoperability problems among different healthcare centers by interviews and online surveys. Based on this empirical study, we mainly used two current techniques, namely peer-to-peer (P 2 P) networks and cloud computing, to design prototypes for sharing healthcare data. Comparing these two techniques, we found the cloud-based solution figured out most of the problems encountered in healthcare interoperability.   To identify state of the art, and pinpoint the challenges and possible future directions for applying a cloud-based solution, a systematic literature review was carried out on cloud-based healthcare solutions. Based on the literature reviewed, we suggest a hybrid cloud model, with access controls and techniques for securing data, could be an acceptable solution for home-based healthcare in the future. <b>This</b> cloud <b>model</b> would <b>work</b> <b>as</b> a community for both healthcare providers and recipients, as well as other stakeholders, such as family members and other patients with similar symptoms. Then we conducted a questionnaire study with healthcare recipients and interviewed healthcare providers to gather the requirements for the design of the community. Based on the concept of ‘community’ from the activity theory model, we designed a prototype to demonstrate our proposed solution.     Finally, we proposed the conceptual hybrid cloud model. In our hybrid cloud model, hospitals and primary healthcare centers could continue using their own databases as private clouds. For home-based healthcare data, we argued, the best approach is to store and process the data in public clouds. Healthcare recipients, as the owners of their health data in public clouds, should then decide who can access their data and the conditions for sharing. To evaluate <b>this</b> <b>model,</b> we conducted a two-step case study of diabetes healthcare in Blekinge, Sweden. We found that our improved hybrid cloud model will be feasible in the future for home-based healthcare, and it will benefit both healthcare providers and recipients. To apply <b>this</b> <b>model</b> in practice, we suggest that a professional IT healthcare education team should be created to support both healthcare providers and recipients...|$|R
