5000|$|The {{earliest}} ribosomal gene sequence {{data indicated}} that Symbiodinium had lineages whose genetic divergence {{was similar to that}} seen in other dinoflagellates from different genera, families, and even orders. This large phylogenetic disparity among clades A, B, C, etc. was confirmed by analyses of the sequences of the mitochondrial gene coding for cytochrome c oxidase subunit I among Dinophyceae. Most of these clade groupings comprise numerous reproductively isolated, genetically distinct lineages (see ‘Species diversity’), exhibiting different ecological and biogeographic distributions (see ‘Geographic distributions and patterns of ‘diversity’).

40|$|Species of Fucus {{are among}} the {{dominant}} seaweeds along Northern Hemisphere shores, but <b>taxonomic</b> <b>designations</b> often are confounded by significant intraspecific morphological variability. We analyzed intra- and inter-specific phylogenetic relationships within the genus (275 individuals representing 16 taxa) using two regions of the mitochondrion: a variable intergenic spacer and a conserved portion of the 23 S subunit. Bayesian ML and MP analyses verified a shallow phylogeny with two major lineages (previously reported) and resolved some intra-lineage relationships. Significant species-level paraphyly/polyphyly was observed within lineages 1 A and 2.

40|$|Background: Preterm {{delivery}} causes substantial {{neonatal mortality}} and morbidity. Unrecognized intra-amniotic infections caused by cultivation-resistant microbes {{may play a}} role. Molecular methods can detect, characterize and quantify microbes independently of traditional culture techniques. However, molecular studies that define the diversity and abundance of microbes invading the amniotic cavity, and evaluate their clinical significance within a causal framework, are lacking. Methods and Findings: In parallel with culture, we used broad-range end-point and real-time PCR assays to amplify, identify and quantify ribosomal DNA (rDNA) of bacteria, fungi and archaea from amniotic fluid of 166 women in preterm labor with intact membranes. We sequenced up to 24 rRNA clones per positive specimen and assigned <b>taxonomic</b> <b>designations</b> to approximately the species level.
