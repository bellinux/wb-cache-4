40|$|The {{buckling}} {{strength of a}} new cold-formed hollow flange channel section known as LiteSteel beam (LSB) is governed by lateral distortional buckling characterised by simultaneous lateral deflection, twist and web distortion for its intermediate spans. Recent research has developed a modified elastic lateral buckling moment equation to allow for lateral distortional buckling effects. However, it {{is limited to a}} uniform moment distribution condition that rarely exists in practice. <b>Transverse</b> <b>loading</b> introduces a non-uniform bending moment distribution, which is also often applied above or below the shear centre (load height). These loading conditions are known to have significant effects on the lateral {{buckling strength}} of beams. Many steel design codes have adopted equivalent uniform moment distribution and load height factors to allow for these effects. But they were derived mostly based on data for conventional hot-rolled, doubly symmetric I-beams subject to lateral torsional buckling. The moment distribution and load height effects of <b>transverse</b> <b>loading</b> for LSBs, and the suitability of the current design modification factors to accommodate these effects for LSBs is not known.

40|$|We perform {{molecular}} dynamics simulations {{to investigate the}} shock response of idealized hexagonal columnar nanocrystalline Cu, including plasticity, local shear, and spall damage during dynamic compression, release, and tension. Shock loading (one-dimensional strain) is applied along three principal directions of the columnar Cu sample, one longitudinal (along the column axis) and two transverse directions, exhibiting a strong anisotropy in the response to shock loading and release. Grain boundaries (GBs) serve as the nucleation sites for crystal plasticity and voids, due to the GB weakening effect as well as stress and shear concentrations. Stress gradients induce GB sliding which is pronounced for the <b>transverse</b> <b>loading.</b> The flow stress and GB sliding are the lowest but the spall strength is the highest, for longitudinal loading. For the grain size and loading conditions explored, void nucleation occurs at the peak shear deformation sites (GBs, and particularly triple junctions); spall damage is entirely intergranular for the <b>transverse</b> <b>loading,</b> while it may extend into grain interiors for the longitudinal loading. Crystal plasticity assists the void growth at the early stage but the growth is mainly achieved via GB separation at later stages for the <b>transverse</b> <b>loading.</b> Our simulations reveal such deformation mechanisms as GB sliding, stress, and shear concentration, GB-initiated crystal plasticity, and GB separation in nanocrystalline solids under shock wave loading...|$|E
