5|$|Fellow {{citizens}} & compatriots—I am besieged, by {{a thousand}} {{or more of}} the Mexicans under Santa Anna—I have sustained a continual Bombardment & cannonade for 24 hours & have not lost a man. The enemy has demanded a surrender at discretion, otherwise, the garrison are to be put to the sword, if the fort is taken—I have answered the demand with a cannon shot, & our flag still waves proudly from the walls. I shall never surrender or retreat. Then, I call on you in the name of Liberty, of patriotism & everything dear to the American character, <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> aid, with all dispatch—The enemy is receiving reinforcements daily & will no doubt increase to three or four thousand in four or five days. If this call is neglected, I am determined to sustain myself as long as possible & die like a soldier who never forgets what is due to his own honor & that of his country—'Victory or Death.|$|E
500|$|Spotnitz's {{favorite}} magician was Ricky Jay, and so, for the episode, Jay {{was brought}} in to play the part of The Amazing Maleeni. Initially, however, the episode hit a snag. The production crew discovered that Jay's production agency had not been informed and that he would be unable to guest star in the episode. The staff's back-up magician, David Blaine, was unavailable for shooting as well. Series creator Chris Carter, however, later stated that the show would not take no for an answer: [...] "We got on the phone with him. He agreed <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> offices to talk about the script and ended up doing some card tricks for us that reduced Frank and I to being six-year-olds again." [...] Jay eventually agreed to do the part, but requested that he only do the tricks he was accustomed to doing. Thus, many of Jay's trademark tricks were included in the episode's script. Gilligan, in retrospect, later noted, [...] "There was no choice other than Ricky Jay as far as we were concerned. He was not looking forward to the idea of playing a magician because I think he felt that magicians were never portrayed very realistically in movies or television shows." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, we'll {{get down}} to New York by three o'clock this afternoon. That will give us nine hours in which {{to have a good}} time. You've got <b>to</b> <b>come</b> up <b>to</b> <b>our</b> house for dinner," [...] {{continued}} Luke; and so it was arranged.|$|R

6000|$|RUTH. I'd {{have gone}} {{home to my}} {{people in the country}} long ago, but they've never got over me marrying Honeywill. I never was waywise, Mr. Cokeson, but I'm proud.

6000|$|... "Oh yes," [...] {{replied the}} little man; [...] "if you were <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> {{committee}} meetings {{you would see}} for yourself. Everything is most carefully gone into; we endeavour to sift the wheat from the chaff." ...|$|E
5000|$|As a family, we’ve {{always been}} {{involved}} with The Tolkien Society and when I was a kid they used <b>to</b> <b>come</b> up <b>to</b> <b>our</b> small farm in Wales for Summer Moots.

6000|$|... 'I admire your taste, sir,' says Mr. Chestle. 'It does you credit.

6000|$|... "Well, well, Oracle," [...] he said, [...] "cost what it may, {{she must}} have it as she likes it.

6000|$|... "She and I meet under greater {{constraint}} than ever. Things {{might go}} on in this way for two years without my getting any insight into her feeling toward me. That is the whole state of affairs, Hans. Neither you nor I have injured the other, that I can see.

6000|$|... "When {{they brought}} the railway across the country, they made {{afterwards}} smaller railways, of shorter width, <b>to</b> <b>come</b> down <b>to</b> <b>our</b> town-a hundred miles.

60|$|<b>To</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> own country: My Lord Bacon {{was a great}} freethinker, when {{he tells}} us, that {{whatever}} has the least relation to religion, is particularly liable to suspicion; by which he seems to suspect all the facts whereon most of the superstitions (that is to say, what the priests call the religions) {{of the world are}} grounded.

6000|$|... "If that be so," [...] said Lancey, after a {{pause and}} deep sigh, [...] "it seems to me no manner of use to build ironclads at all, {{and that it would}} be better, as well as cheaper, in time <b>to</b> <b>come,</b> <b>to</b> fight all <b>our</b> battles with torpedo-boats." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} what I am going to do. I am {{going to give a}} dinner to this party.

5000|$|A {{letter written}} by Mill in 1854 {{suggests}} Taylor {{was reluctant to}} be described as joint author of Mill's books and articles; [...] "I shall never be satisfied unless you allow our best book, the book which is <b>to</b> <b>come,</b> <b>to</b> have <b>our</b> two names on the title page. It ought to be so with everything I publish, for the better half of it all is yours". The reasons for her reluctance may include the likely response to a philosophical text published by Mill only or as a coauthored work.|$|R
