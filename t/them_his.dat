5|$|Hilary's clerks {{were trained}} in administration, and one of <b>them,</b> <b>his</b> nephew Jocelin, was named {{chancellor}} of Chichester Cathedral by his uncle. Jocelin later became Archdeacon of Lewes, and a royal judge. A number of Hilary's clerks served with Thomas Becket for a time, most of them after leaving Hilary's service.|$|E
5|$|The last {{sentence}} {{of the passage}} is similar to one from the Republican era Biography of Song Yue, Prince of E. But instead of teaching <b>them</b> <b>his</b> own technique, it states Yue taught what he had learned from Zhou to his soldiers who were victorious in battle.|$|E
5|$|While {{a medical}} {{resident}} in the 1960s, Paul {{was influenced by}} Friedrich Hayek's The Road to Serfdom, which caused him to read other publications by Ludwig von Mises and Ayn Rand.

5|$|Alexander had no {{experience}} in affairs of state. However, {{he was determined to}} make the best of a difficult situation and represent his father as best he could. Adopting an air of cool indifference to the government, he rarely made the effort to read official documents before he rubber-stamped <b>them.</b> <b>His</b> functions were limited, and amounted to visiting the Macedonian front to support the morale of the Greek and Allied troops. Since Venizelos's return to power, Athens was at war with the Central Powers, and Greek soldiers battled those of Bulgaria in the north.|$|E
5|$|Burnell died in Berwick, on 25 October 1292. His body, {{without his}} heart, is interred in the nave of Wells Cathedral; {{his heart was}} buried at Bath Abbey. Although he was usually busy with royal business, Burnell managed to expand his bishopric and provide for his relatives. He amassed great wealth, and {{acquired}} numerous estates in Shropshire, Worcestershire, Somerset, Kent, Surrey and elsewhere. At his death, he owned 82 manors over 19 counties, most of <b>them</b> <b>his</b> personal property rather {{than that of the}} diocese of Bath and Wells.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Muntz {{decided to}} sell blank tapes and VCRs as loss leaders to attract {{customers}} to his showroom, where he would then try to sell <b>them</b> <b>his</b> projection TV systems. His success continued through the early 1980s until he invested heavily in the Technicolor Compact Video Cassette (CVC), a 1/4in(0.6cm) system designed to compete with Betamax, VHS, and the Super 8 film home-movie system. The CVC format failed in the marketplace, sales quickly eroded, and Muntz's store closed soon after.|$|E

5|$|Kasab filed a mercy {{petition}} {{with the}} President of India, which was rejected on 5 November. Kasab was hanged in Pune's Yerwada jail in secret on 21 November 2012 at 7:30am and naming the operation as operation 'X'. The Indian mission in Islamabad informed the Pakistan government about Kasab's hanging through letter. Pakistan {{refused to take}} the letter, which was then faxed to <b>them.</b> <b>His</b> family in Pakistan was sent news of his hanging via a courier.|$|E
5|$|Later, when Rosier has an {{accident}} outside the village, he is rescued by the Romani, who treat the mayor with their traditional healing practices. He sells <b>them</b> <b>his</b> father's house, {{in order to}} protect them from the Fascist policy of imprisoning the homeless. Lundi enrolls the children in her school. The freedom-loving Romani recognize that these French are trying to help but struggled with life in a fixed place and the rules of formal education.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, at {{the same}} time during the kidney crisis, United States President Barack Obama has decided to visit Quahog, and Chris' entire English class is {{assigned}} to write an essay about hope. He consults his sister Meg for her opinion and she lists her personal opinion on the subject, which Chris plagiarizes. Meg is angered that he has decided to take her words and call <b>them</b> <b>his</b> own, but she is eventually given credit for co-writing the speech, and she and Chris introduce Obama to the school. President Obama then enters the school's auditorium, and begins singing and playing the guitar as students swoon over his performance.|$|E
5000|$|The record (a metal {{book written}} on sheets of gold) was passed through generations.

5|$|Mr. Bean {{often seems}} unaware of basic {{aspects of the}} way the world works, and the {{programme}} usually features his attempts at what would normally be considered simple activities, such as going swimming, using a television set, interior decorating, or going to church. The humour largely comes from his original (and often absurd) solutions to problems and his total disregard for others when solving <b>them,</b> <b>his</b> pettiness, and occasional malevolence.|$|E
5|$|Pitts and Tuck renamed {{their product}} from Spacewar to Galaxy Game due to anti-war {{sentiment}} and founded {{a company called}} Mini-Computer Applications in June 1971 to operate the game as it neared completion. The development of the prototype machine took around {{three and a half}} months. By August, they were well into development and had gotten permission to place the machine at the Tresidder student union building at Stanford as a test site. It was then that they received a call from Nolan Bushnell, who had heard of their project and wanted to show <b>them</b> <b>his</b> similar project he was working on.|$|E
5|$|Prokofiev's latest opera projects, among <b>them</b> <b>his</b> {{desperate attempt}} to appease the {{cultural}} authorities, The Story of a Real Man, were quickly cancelled by the Kirov Theatre. The snub, in combination with his declining health, caused Prokofiev to progressively withdraw from public life and from various activities, even his beloved chess, and increasingly devote himself to his own work. After a serious relapse in 1949, his doctors ordered him to limit his composing to an hour a day.|$|E

5|$|Smuts {{thrived in}} this environment. With these new vistas of {{knowledge}} and learning now revealed that he spared no effort in his attempts to master <b>them.</b> <b>His</b> surviving notebooks from this period reveal the range and breadth of his studies: Latin, Greek, German, the Classics, Optical Physics, Inorganic Chemistry and Metallurgy, Organic Chemistry and Agriculture, and Geology - to name but a few. Once again, as had been the case at Riebeek West, this was not merely study {{for the sake of}} exams - as ever, Smuts continued to study avidly outside the confines of the curriculum.|$|E
5|$|Stewie hitches a {{ride with}} a trucker and so Brian follows {{him all the way}} to Canada. On the way, Stewie accidentally causes a traffic pileup by {{discharging}} a flare pistol in the cab of the truck, which catches fire and explodes. Crashing his car in a chain reaction, Brian becomes angry and tells Stewie that Santa does not exist. Stewie becomes frustrated and continues to attempt to hitchhike, corecing Brian to join him. The pair then encounter a Canadian who gives <b>them</b> <b>his</b> snowmobile.|$|E

5|$|The Emperor assured Mary {{that he had}} {{no doubts}} about her loyalty to the Roman Catholic Church. He had learned that the Queen could not easily be bullied, {{especially}} not in matters which affected her personally. Yet, upon leaving the States General in October 1531, Charles gave her a warning, saying that if his parent, wife, child or sibling became a follower of Luther, he would consider <b>them</b> <b>his</b> greatest enemy. Mary was thus forced to suppress Protestantism in the Netherlands, regardless of her own religious tolerance. However, she always strived to enforce her brother's laws on religion as little as possible. She was accused of protecting Protestants on several occasions.|$|E
5|$|The Romans did not, however, remove Nabis {{from the}} Spartan throne. Even though Sparta was a {{landlocked}} and effectively powerless state, the Romans wanted an independent Sparta {{to act as}} a counterweight against the growing Achaean League. Nabis' allegiance was secured {{by the fact that he}} had to surrender five hostages, amongst <b>them</b> <b>his</b> son, Armenas. The Romans did not restore the exiles, wishing to avoid internal strife in Sparta. They did, however, allow any woman who was married to an ex-helot but whose husband was in exile to join him.|$|E
5|$|The illness {{emphasised}} certain {{traits in}} his character. He argued cuttingly, his biting satire did not shrink at insults, and his expressions could be rude and cruel. Though in general Marx had a blind {{faith in his}} closest friends, nevertheless he himself complained that he was sometimes too mistrustful and unjust even to <b>them.</b> <b>His</b> verdicts, not only about enemies but even about friends, were sometimes so harsh that even less sensitive people would take offence… There must have been few whom he did not criticize like this… not even Engels was an exception.|$|E
