5|$|He {{lived on}} for four more years, {{spending}} {{his days in}} his palace gardens. He saw his tetrarchic system fail, <b>torn</b> <b>by</b> the selfish ambitions of his successors. He heard of Maximian's third claim to the throne, his forced suicide, his damnatio memoriae. In his own palace, statues and portraits of his former companion emperor were torn down and destroyed. Deep in despair and illness, Diocletian may have committed suicide. He died on 3 December 312.|$|E

Finding Kraken to be {{vulnerable}} to manipulation by their psychic powers, as he was still <b>torn</b> <b>by</b> latent subconscious loyalty to his late master Judd, {{they were able to}} use him as their agent to free Judge Death from captivity and begin their conquest of the city. Had Dredd not resigned, they might not have found their task so easy. Dredd eventually returned to the city and defeated them.|$|E

5|$|For Catherine, these {{entertainments}} {{served a}} political purpose {{that made them}} worth their colossal expense. She presided over the royal government {{at a time when}} the French monarchy was in steep decline. With three of her sons on the throne in succession and the country <b>torn</b> <b>by</b> religious civil war, Catherine set out to show not only the French people but foreign courts that the Valois monarchy was as prestigious and magnificent as it had been during the reigns of Francis I and her husband Henry II. At the same time, she believed these elaborate entertainments and sumptuous court rituals, which incorporated martial sports and tournaments of many kinds, would occupy her feuding nobles and distract them from fighting against each other to the detriment of the country and the royal authority.|$|E

25|$|Additionally, the {{military}} was <b>torn</b> <b>by</b> hostilities between officers originating from the colonial-era KNIL, who wished for a small and elite professional military, and {{the overwhelming majority of}} soldiers who started their careers in the Japanese-formed PETA, who were afraid of being discharged and were more known for nationalist-zeal over professionalism.|$|E

Individuals that are elderly, smokers, or those having had cortisone injections often have weaker tendon tissue that fails without a significant injury. By contrast those whose tendon was <b>torn</b> <b>by</b> a substantial fall often have good quality tendon that can be repaired if surgery is performed promptly after the injury.|$|E

25|$|The Bactrian king Euthydemus I {{and his son}} Demetrius I {{crossed the}} Hindu Kush {{mountains}} and began the conquest of the Indus valley.

When Demetrius advanced far into India one of his generals, Eucratides, made himself king of Bactria, and soon in every province there arose new usurpers, who proclaimed themselves kings and fought against each other.|$|E
