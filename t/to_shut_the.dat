5|$|Braham's {{return to}} Britain {{was not a}} welcome one. His family found him {{exceptionally}} difficult to live with. His short temper and aggressiveness manifested themselves when journalists came to the family's home in Leicestershire searching for a war-story to print. Braham, who despised publicity, physically ejected them from his property. His decision <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> media {{out of his life}} likely explains why, even {{as one of the most}} successful aces, he was virtually unknown in Britain outside the RAF. Braham had also become despondent about the political climate in a country that reduced Winston Churchill to Leader of the Opposition, where the black market was rife and rationing was set to become an indefinite feature of post-war Britain into the 1950s.|$|E

Arkansas then scored on a Matt Jones run, but failed the two-point conversion, which is required versus an extra point in the third overtime or later. The Volunteers answered the call on their first play, a 25-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Tony Brown, but the Volunteers also failed the two, sending the game into a fifth extra period.|$|E
25|$|In other {{reactors}} {{the coolant}} {{acts as a}} poison by absorbing neutrons {{in the same way}} that the control rods do. In these reactors power output can be increased by heating the coolant, which makes it a less dense poison. Nuclear reactors generally have automatic and manual systems to scram the reactor in an emergency shut down. These systems insert large amounts of poison (often boron in the form of boric acid) into the reactor <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> fission reaction down if unsafe conditions are detected or anticipated.|$|E

Braniff International lauded the CAB's quick decision as the carrier had stated that because of its tenuous cash position {{that it might have}} <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> routes down if an agreement was not approved. Braniff ceased operations on May 12–13, 1982, and Eastern took over the routes earlier than the planned June 1, 1982, commencement of service date.|$|E

25|$|A {{study by}} UBS, {{reported}} on April 12, 2011, predicts that around 30 nuclear plants may be closed worldwide, with those located in seismic zones {{or close to}} national boundaries being the most likely <b>to</b> <b>shut.</b> <b>The</b> analysts believe that 'even pro-nuclear countries such as France {{will be forced to}} close at least two reactors to demonstrate political action and restore the public acceptability of nuclear power', noting that the events at Fukushima 'cast doubt on the idea that even an advanced economy can master nuclear safety'.

25|$|The second plant, Gentilly-2, is a 675-megawatt CANDU-PHW unit {{commissioned}} in 1983, after a 10-year construction period. On August 19, 2008, {{after several}} years of studies, the government of Quebec and Hydro-Québec announced its decision to go ahead with Gentilly-2's refurbishment in 2011 and 2012 at a cost of C$1.9 billion. The project was to extend the plant's useful life until 2035. However, on October 3, 2012, the Québec government announced it would accept Hydro-Québec's recommendation to shut down Gentilly-2. The cost <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> plant down was estimated at $2 billion, whereas the estimate for the cost of a refurbishment had increased to $4.3 billion.

25|$|The bailout valve (BOV) is an {{open circuit}} demand valve built into a rebreather {{mouthpiece}} or {{other part of the}} breathing loop. It can be isolated while the diver is using the rebreather to recycle breathing gas and opened {{while at the same time}} isolating the breathing loop when a problem causes the diver to bail out onto open circuit. The main distinguishing feature of the BOV is that the same mouthpiece is used for open and closed-circuit, and the diver does not have <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> Dive/Surface valve, remove it from their mouth, and find and insert the bailout demand valve in order to bail out onto open circuit. Although costly, this reduction in critical steps makes the integrated BOV a significant safety advantage.|$|E

25|$|Aristotle (384–322 BC) first {{recorded}} that burning coals produced toxic fumes. An ancient method of execution was <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> criminal {{in a bathing}} room with smoldering coals. What was not known was the mechanism of death. Greek physician Galen (129–199 AD) speculated {{that there was a}} change in the composition of the air that caused harm when inhaled. In 1776, the French chemist de Lassone produced CO by heating zinc oxide with coke, but mistakenly concluded that the gaseous product was hydrogen, as it burned with a blue flame. The gas was identified as a compound containing carbon and oxygen by the Scottish chemist William Cumberland Cruikshank in 1800. Its toxic properties on dogs were thoroughly investigated by Claude Bernard around 1846.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after this}} decision, the {{municipal}} authorities of Paris were summoned. They were ordered <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> city gates and arm the citizenry {{to prevent any}} attempt at a Protestant uprising. The king's Swiss Guard was given the task of killing a list of leading Protestants. It is difficult today to determine the exact chronology of events and to know the moment the killing began. It seems probable that a signal was given by ringing bells for matins (between midnight and dawn) at the church of Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois, near the Louvre, which was the parish church of the kings of France. The Swiss guards had expelled the Protestant nobles from the Louvre castle and then slaughtered them in the streets.|$|E
