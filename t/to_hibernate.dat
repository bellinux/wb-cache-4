5|$|Dwarf lemurs are {{the only}} {{primates}} known <b>to</b> <b>hibernate</b> for extended periods. Unlike other hibernating mammals from temperate regions, which have to awaken regularly for a few days, dwarf lemurs experience five months of continuous deep hibernation (May through September). Before and after this deep hibernation, there are two months (April and October) of transition, where they will forage on a limited basis to reduce demands on their fat reserves. Unlike any other hibernating mammal, the body temperature of hibernating dwarf lemurs will fluctuate with the ambient temperature rather than remaining low and stable.|$|E
5|$|Amphibian skin is {{permeable}} to water. Gas exchange {{can take}} place through the skin (cutaneous respiration) and this allows adult amphibians to respire without rising {{to the surface of}} water and <b>to</b> <b>hibernate</b> at the bottom of ponds. To compensate for their thin and delicate skin, amphibians have evolved mucous glands, principally on their heads, backs and tails. The secretions produced by these help keep the skin moist. In addition, most species of amphibian have granular glands that secrete distasteful or poisonous substances. Some amphibian toxins can be lethal to humans while others have little effect. The main poison-producing glands, the paratoids, produce the neurotoxin bufotoxin and are located behind the ears of toads, along the backs of frogs, behind the eyes of salamanders and on the upper surface of caecilians.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{conserve}} {{energy and water}} in their highly seasonal environment, mouse lemurs and dwarf lemurs exhibit seasonal behavioral cycles of dormancy where the metabolic rate and body temperature are lowered. They are the only primates known to do so. They accumulate fat reserves in their hind legs and the base of their tail before the dry winter season, when food and water are scarce, and can exhibit daily and prolonged torpor during the dry season. Daily torpor constitutes less than 24 hours of dormancy, whereas prolonged torpor averages two weeks in duration and signals hibernation. Mouse lemurs have been observed experiencing torpor that lasts for several consecutive days, but dwarf lemurs are known <b>to</b> <b>hibernate</b> for six to eight months every year, particularly {{on the west coast}} of Madagascar.|$|E
40|$|White-nose {{syndrome}} (WNS) {{is causing}} unprecedented declines in {{several species of}} North American bats. The characteristic lesions of WNS are caused by the fungus Geomyces destructans, which erodes and replaces the living skin of bats while they hibernate. It is unknown how this infection kills the bats. We review here the unique physiological importance of wings <b>to</b> <b>hibernating</b> bats {{in relation to the}} damage caused by G. destructans and propose that mortality is caused by catastrophic disruption of wing-dependent physiological functions. Mechanisms of disease associated with G. destructans seem specific <b>to</b> <b>hibernating</b> bats and are most analogous to disease caused by chytrid fungus in amphibians...|$|R

50|$|During winter months, in latitudes {{with snow}} cover, {{all members of}} this group {{hibernate}} as adult butterflies. During hibernation, hidden in various shelters, the butterflies are dormant. The camouflage provided by crypsis is obviously advantageous <b>to</b> <b>hibernating</b> butterflies. The potential predators will have difficulties in seeing the dormant butterflies. With their wings closed, exposing only the ventral cryptically coloured underside, they blend in with their surroundings.|$|R
5|$|The player's character, the part-slug and {{part-cat}} Slugcat, uses {{spears and}} rocks {{to survive a}} hostile, ruined, and obtuse 2D world {{in search of the}} family from whom it was separated. The player is given little explicit guidance and is free to explore the world in any direction via pipes and passages that pass through 1600 static screens, each with randomized enemies. The Slugcat can jump and use debris as weapons to avoid and hurt other creatures while foraging for sparse food, which is used <b>to</b> <b>hibernate</b> in scarce, designated safe rooms. Hibernation resets the day cycle and saves the player's progress. The player can move between regions by having the Slugcat hibernate multiple times without dying. If the player does not reach the hibernation point quickly, a crushing rain will pour, both flooding the world and possibly pummeling the Slugcat to death.|$|E
5|$|In some lowland {{areas the}} adult {{salamanders}} will remain active all winter long, excluding cold spells. However, {{during the cold}} winter months in the northern parts of its range, the long-toed salamander burrows below the frost-line in a coarse substrate <b>to</b> <b>hibernate</b> in clusters of 8–14 individuals. While hibernating, it survives on protein energy reserves that are stored in its skin and along its tail. These proteins serve a secondary function {{as part of a}} mixture or concoction of skin secretions that is used for defense. When threatened, the long-toed salamander will wave its tail and secrete an adhesive white milky substance that is noxious and likely poisonous. The color of its skin can serve as a warning to predators (aposematism) that it will taste bad. Its skin colors and patterns are diverse, ranging from a dark black to reddish brown background that is spotted or blotched by a pale-reddish-brown, pale-green, to a bright yellow stripe. An adult may also drop part of its tail and slink away while the tail bit acts as a squirmy decoy; this is called autotomy. The regeneration and regrowth of the tail is one example of the developmental physiology of amphibians that is of great interest to the medical profession.|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{relatively}} cool and dry climate in which M. flavitarsis lives, {{it is the only}} species in the Mischocyttarus genus <b>to</b> <b>hibernate</b> and will seek shelter {{for the duration of the}} months of October through April. Typically, only female wasps will hibernate, with male wasps rarely being observed during the hibernation season. Female wasps will hibernate in cracks in eaves and roofs, cavities in electric light boxes, loose bark, logs, rocks, boxes, and attics. Rarely, females will emerge on warm winter days to fly in the sun before returning <b>to</b> <b>hibernate</b> for the duration of winter.|$|E

25|$|In southeastern Europe, H. pomatia {{lives in}} forests, open habitats, gardens, vineyards, {{especially}} along rivers, confined to calcareous substrate. In central Europe, {{it occurs in}} open forests and shrubland on calcareous substrate. It prefers high humidity and lower temperatures, and needs loose soil for burrowing <b>to</b> <b>hibernate</b> and lay its eggs. It lives up to 2100 m above sea level in the Alps, but usually below 2000 m. In the south of England, it is restricted to undisturbed grassy or bushy wastelands, usually not in gardens; it has a low reproduction rate and low powers of dispersal.|$|E

25|$|Three {{types of}} hibernacula have been {{designated}} {{depending on the}} amount of use each receives from year to year. Priority One hibernacula are those that consistently have greater than 30,000 Indiana bats hibernating inside each winter. Priority Two hibernacula contain 500 to 30,000 bats, and Priority 3 hibernacula are any with fewer than 500 bats. At least 50% of Indiana bats are thought <b>to</b> <b>hibernate</b> in the 8 Priority One hibernacula, which can be found in Indiana (3 hibernacula), Missouri (3), and Kentucky (2). Estimates of hibernating populations in 2001 suggest that Priority One hibernacula have experienced a 48% decline since 1983. Overall, populations have fallen approximately 57% since 1960 across all hibernacula.|$|E

40|$|White-nose {{syndrome}} (WNS) is {{a disease}} responsible for unprecedented mortality in hibernating bats in the northeastern U. S. This previously unrecognized disease has spread very rapidly since its discovery in January 2007, and poses a considerable threat <b>to</b> <b>hibernating</b> bats throughout North America. As WNS spreads, the challenges for understanding and managing the disease continue to increase. Given the escalating complexity of these challenges, a highly coordinated effort is required for State, Federal, and Tribal wildlife agencies, and private partners to respond effectively to WNS and conserve species of bats. The plan proposed herein details the elements that are critical to the investigation and management of WNS, identifies key action items to address stated goals, and outlines the role(s) of agencies and entities involved in this continental effort...|$|R

MacReady, Garry, and Nauls decide to dynamite the complex, hoping to destroy the Thing. As they set the explosives, Blair kills Garry and Nauls disappears. Blair transforms into a much larger monster and attacks, destroying the detonator, but MacReady still triggers the blast with a stick of dynamite, destroying the base.|$|E
25|$|The {{animal life}} {{in these areas}} is also {{relatively}} rich. The zone is particularly important to the brown bear, which likes <b>to</b> <b>hibernate</b> the winter away in dens along the mountainside. In spring, the brown bears descent to the plains, and only return to the mountain when the berries do. These terrains are also favored stomping grounds of the Eurasian lynx. Both species, brown bear and Eurasian lynx, are protected in Sweden. Besides the red fox, the other predators, which are the wolverine, the gray wolf and the Arctic fox, are much rarer {{and do not have}} a fixed location in the park. The park shelters an important population of moose that pass the summer on the mountain, but prefer to spend the winter in areas less snowy. There are no more wild reindeerin the park, which is part of those few Swedish mountains not included in the area of pasture of domestic reindeer. Muskox, which left the area almost 4000 years ago, were reintroduced in Norway and sometimes wander near the park. Among the smaller animals, one can cite the red squirrel, the European pine marten, and the mountain hare. Like other Swedish mountains, the Norway lemming is present in Fulufjället, but in a patchy fashion, extremely numerous some years and almost absent others. This phenomenon is still not entirely understood.|$|E
500|$|The Eastern small- footed bat is {{most often}} {{detected}} during hibernation, and has been counted at approximately 125 hibernacula. They {{are one of the}} last species to enter hibernation in the fall and the first to leave in the spring, with a hibernation period lasting from late November to early April. [...] They have been found in very cold caves and mines and can tolerate lower temperatures than other bat species. (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998) Unlike most other bat species they prefer <b>to</b> <b>hibernate</b> in caves and mines that are very short in length (150m) and are most often found hibernating near the entrance of their hibernacula where temperatures sometimes dip below zero, and the humidity is very low. (Barbour and Davis 1969; Merritt 1987; Harvey 1992). This location choice may put them at a greater risk of white nose syndrome and estimates from hibernating bats suggest the disease caused a 12% decrease in their population since 2006. These bats also tend <b>to</b> <b>hibernate</b> individually, or in groups of less than 50, and have also been found hibernating with other species of bats, which makes them very difficult to find. Many bat biologists have speculated that the species may hibernate outside of caves and mines. Skin temperature patterns of small-footed bats found roosting on talus slopes during periods of extreme cold in March provide support for this idea.|$|E

500|$|While {{the gray}} mouse lemur {{is found in}} both primary and {{secondary}} deciduous forests, they have lower population densities in secondary forests. This is because variations in gray mouse lemur abundance are linked to their capacity to enter torpor during the dry season, especially for females, which tend <b>to</b> <b>hibernate</b> longer than males. In primary forests, they can maintain daily torpor or hibernation {{as long as their}} body temperatures remain below , but in secondary forests that have fewer large trees, temperatures are higher and inhibit the gray mouse lemur's ability to maintain torpor for prolonged periods of time. [...] In addition, the gray mouse lemur in secondary forests tend to have a lower body mass than those in primary forests, as well as lower survival rates. This is likely because those with lower body mass are less likely to enter torpor, and therefore expend around 40% more energy than those that do maintain torpor.|$|E
