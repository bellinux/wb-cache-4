25|$|Following {{the death}} of Bartolo, his wife Josefa {{encouraged}} their son Federico to take over <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>at</b> the young age of 17. Shortly after Federico took the helm, Spanish dictator Miguel Primo de Rivera, closed the frontier with Gibraltar in the 1920s making it harder to do business and maintain his widowed mother, brother and two sisters. This {{was the first of}} a repeating pattern of political obstacles which the family business would have to face from governments in Madrid. The next decade continued to be troublesome times for Gibraltar with the Spanish Civil War at its doorstep. The end of the war in 1939 reopened access to the Spanish market for Gibraltarian merchants. Commodities such as tobacco and coffee were scarce in the post civil war Spain and Federico, together with his younger brother Bartolo were able to sell vast quantities of coffee there. Their renown La Negrita brand became so popular in southern Spain that it was even mentioned in a famous chirigota, a satirical folksong so typical of the Cádiz Carnival.|$|E

500|$|According to Taraborrelli, [...] "Many female artists {{behave like}} a diva for a period when they reach superstar status, and the 'Who's That Girl?' tour marked the {{beginning}} of Madonna's." [...] For instance, she would not allow crew members to talk directly to her; they had to talk to her representatives, lest they distract her from <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>at</b> hand. She also forbade her dancers from speaking to her and her musicians were not permitted to even look at her unless they were onstage with her. Moreover, when coming on and off the stage, Madonna demanded that road managers hold sheets around her in order to shield her from the eyes of [...] "those who couldn't help but stare". DeMann commented: [...] "She has a way of demanding that compels you to give her your undivided attention", to which Taraborrelli felt that such behavior actually was an indication of how successful and strong Madonna was. [...] "You don't {{behave like a}} bitch until you are that successful. The tour sure helped cement her star status", he commented.|$|E
