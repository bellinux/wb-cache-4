25|$|The {{establishment}} of the DSJ Architects partnership led to immediate work in building houses of religious worship. Although Dyson’s personal office received professional awards for a remodeling of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church (1991) in Porterville, California, that integrated functional improvements with new decorative enrichment, his participation in DSJ Architects resulted designs for new facilities for four Christian churches and a Buddhist temple. Two schemes were prepared for the United Japanese Christian Church (1991/1992) in Clovis, California, which reveal a reconception of the form between the two versions unusual in Dyson work. The realized building exhibits several features that continue to develop in subsequent projects, notably the sweeping simplicity of sparingly embellished space in a light filled sanctuary and an entrance embracing from high overhead the approach of worshipers with elongated steel trellis forms. In St. Mary’s Catholic Church (1994) in Sanger, California, the extension of twelve wings in the entrance <b>trellis</b> <b>work</b> refers to the Christian apostles and forms a symbolic canopy over a monumental sixteen foot high statue of the Virgin Mary. The Huber Memorial Chapel for the First Congregational Church (1997) in Bakersfield, California, refines the entrance adornment into a single vector of joined steel spars jutting forward from the cornice in a visual reference to hands joined in prayer.|$|E

They have a suit of rooms over them, with small windows of wooden lattice, of intricate but regular carved work, and some have frames cased with thin gold. The squares have a large apartment on each side, open in front, with two supporting pillars, which break the view and give it all the appearance of the proscenium or front of the stage of the older Italian theaters. They are lofty and regular, and the cornices of a very bold cane-work in alto relievo. A drop-curtain of curiously plaited cane is suspended in front, and in each we observed chairs and stools embossed with gold, and beds of silk, with scattered regalia.|$|E

Thus {{this paper presents}} the design of an adaptive Viterbi decoder that uses survivor path with parameters for wireless communication {{in an attempt to}} reduce the power and cost {{and at the same time}} increase the speed. Viterbi Algorithm is the optimum-decoding algorithm for convolutional codes and has often been served as a standard technique in digital communication systems for maximum likelihood sequence estimation. The Add-Compare-Select (ACS) and Trace Back (TB) units and its sub circuits of the decoder have been operated in deep pipelined manner to achieve high transmission rate. In this paper register exchange based survivor unit is used as they have better throughput when compared to trace back using memory. Branch metric is calculated for either upper or lower half of trellis, which leads to reduction of power consumption. The Trellis code structure is divided into two segments. The first segment of the <b>Trellis</b> <b>works</b> in normal Viterbi mode while the second works in modified T-algorithm. The designed Adaptive Viterbi Decoder is able to detect and correct up to four errors. The design is optimized with respect to time, area and power and the netlist is generated. The netlist obtained after synthesis undergoes the physical design process. The synthesized circuits are placed and routed in the standard cell design environment and implemented on a Xilinx FPGA device...|$|R

In less than six weeks Mr. Carr and his daughters were installed in a new house, built near the site of the double cabin, which was again transferred to the settlement, in order to give greater seclusion to the fair guests. It was a long, roomy, one-storied villa, with a not unpicturesque combination of deep veranda and <b>trellis</b> <b>work,</b> which relieved the flat monotony of the interior and the barrenness of the freshly-cleared ground.

40|$|Fibre Reinforced Plastics offer several {{advantages}} over other {{materials such as}} decreased part counts, weight savings, and flexibility. The obstacles to the further expansion of composites use, particularly in cost-conscious industries such as the car industry, include volume, cost, and quality. Liquid Composite Moulding, where the dry textile reinforcement is shaped prior to application of the plastic matrix, offers to address these drivers by offering potential for automation, speed, and quality control. However, the preforming of the dry reinforcement is rarely automated, and its results are variable and hard to predict or control. This thesis aims to facilitate better preforming process design and control. The dominant deformation mechanism that allows reinforcements to conform to a 3 D surface is <b>trellis</b> shear. <b>Work</b> is therefore presented on shear characterisation of textile reinforcements using the picture frame and the bias extension tests. Several approaches to normalising these tests to achieve method-independent shear data are proposed, and compared. Of these, a normalisation technique for the bias extension test based on energy considerations {{appears to be the}} most appropriate. A constitutive modelling approach, based on the meso-mechanical deformation mechanisms identified in the reinforcement, is developed for characterising the asymmetric shear properties exhibited by non-crimp fabrics. The results from this model are compared with experimental data. Finally, an energy minimising kinematic drape method is developed to account for the use of automated reinforcement blank-holders, and methods for modelling process variability using the code are investigated.

40|$|Trellis {{decoding}} is {{a popular}} method to recover encoded information corrupted during transmission over a noisy channel. Prominent members of this class of decoding algorithms are the Viterbi algorithm, which provides maximum likelihood estimates, and the BCJR algorithm, which is a maximum a posteriori estimator commonly used in iterative decoding. In this thesis, the Viterbi algorithm is chosen since it provides a good trade-off between achievable coding gain and implementation complexity. This {{is the basis for}} considerations on simplified, hybrid, and, most importantly, flexible VLSI architectures. Algorithm simplifications are necessary to reduce the computational burden laid on an implementation platform. In our <b>work</b> on <b>trellis</b> decoding blocks, a simplification that lowers the number of arithmetic operations is derived and evaluated. By using a complementary code property, the arithmetic complexity of the main part on the Viterbi algorithm is reduced by 17 %. Synthesized blocks show varying savings for cell area and estimated power consumption. A comparison to a competing simplification shows the advantage in a hardware implementation of our work for the important class of rate 1 / 2 convolutional codes. Hybrid architectures try to combine benefits of several approaches to lower the drawbacks of the individual contributors. For survivor path processing in Viterbi decoders, a new hybrid approach is proposed. A low-latency algorithm, whose implementation complexity quickly increases with the number of trellis states, is combined with a scalable RAM-based method. As a result, the developed hybrid architecture exhibits a better latency-complexity behavior compared to other hybrid approaches. Flexible VLSI architectures to cover several communication standards become increasingly important as fabrication costs for microchips rise rapidly with every new process generation. In the context of flexible <b>trellis</b> decoding, earlier <b>work</b> mostly concentrated on varying encoder memory and thus the number of <b>trellis</b> states. This <b>work</b> studies the effects on hardware size and throughput introduced by flexibility if the code rate is varied. The investigation of a decoder for bandwidth-efficient codes, which was fabricated in a 0. 13 um digital CMOS process and verified for functionality, distinguishes between task- and rate-flexibility. A comparison is carried out between flexible designs, which decode both convolutional and TCM codes and provide two or three transmission rates. It is concluded that the larger number of rates is more beneficial from a cost [...] flexibility viewpoint...|$|R

A geochemical, mineralogical and petrological study of four Fe–Ti(–V) oxide bodies located in the understudied Angolan part of the KIC has been performed.

From Empfelde, a village half way from Ratzeburg, I walked to Hamburg through deep sandy roads and a dreary flat: the soil everywhere white, hungry, and excessively pulverised; but the approach to the city is pleasing. Light cool country houses, which you can look through and see the gardens behind them, with arbours and <b>trellis</b> <b>work,</b> and thick vegetable walls, and trees in cloisters and piazzas, each house with neat rails before it, and green seats within the rails. Every object, whether the growth of nature or the work of man, was neat and artificial. It pleased me far better, than if the houses and gardens, and pleasure fields, {{had been in a}} nobler taste: for this nobler taste would have been mere apery. The busy, anxious, money-loving merchant of Hamburg could only have adopted, he could not have enjoyed the simplicity of nature. The mind begins to love nature by imitating human conveniences in nature; but this is a step in intellect, though a low one--and were it not so, yet all around me spoke of innocent enjoyment and sensitive comforts, and I entered with unscrupulous sympathy into the enjoyments and comforts even of the busy, anxious, money-loving merchants of Hamburg. In this charitable and catholic mood I reached the vast ramparts of the city. These are huge green cushions, one rising above the other, with trees growing in the interspaces, pledges and symbols of a long peace. Of my return I have nothing worth communicating, except that I took extra post, which answers to posting in England. These north German post chaises are uncovered wicker carts. An English dust-cart is a piece of finery, a chef d'auvre of mechanism, compared with them and the horses!--a savage might use their ribs instead of his fingers for a numeration table.

50|$|Paradoxically, however, as {{his career}} progressed Repton drew {{more and more}} on picturesque ideas. One major {{criticism}} of Brown's landscapes was the lack of a formal setting for the house, with rolling lawns sweeping right up to the front door.

He also designed {{one of the most famous}} 'picturesque' landscapes in Britain at Blaise Castle, near Bristol. At Woburn Abbey, Repton foreshadowed another nineteenth-century development, creating themed garden areas including a Chinese garden, American garden, arboretum and forcing garden. At Stoneleigh Abbey in 1808, Repton foreshadowed another nineteenth-century development, creating a perfect cricket pitch called 'home lawn' in front of the west wing, and a bowling green lawn between the gatehouse and the house.|$|E

Ribs were built from spruce <b>trellis</b> <b>work.</b> There was a secondary spar behind the main one and an over-all fabric covering. A trim tab was positioned inboard on {{the trailing edge of}} each half-span. The rear wing was similarly constructed but fixed in place.

Early in his career, Repton defended Brown's reputation during the 'picturesque controversy'. However, as his career progressed Repton came to apply picturesque theory {{to the practice of}} landscape design. He believed that the foreground should be the realm of art (with formal geometry and ornamental planting), that the middle ground should have a parkland character of the type created by Brown and that the background should have a wild and 'natural' character.
