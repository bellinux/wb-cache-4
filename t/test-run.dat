The Di6 would have motors from Siemens, who had bought MaK, and would be optimized for Norwegian conditions and standards. The contract was worth NOK380 million, or NOK32 million per unit. At the same time, NSB also made an order for 20 smaller diesel-electric locomotives from MaK, the Di8. Between the two new classes, they were to replace all the Di3s.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, the Oslo City Council {{decided to}} build a four-line metro to the new suburbs {{to the east of}} the city center. The plans called for the system to open in 1966, with the {{conversion}} of the Østensjø Line and the Lambertseter Line of the Oslo Tramway, and the new Furuset Line and Grorud Line. The system would feature higher and longer platforms, allowing step-free access to six-car trains, automatic train protection and third-rail power supply. This would make the metro incompatible with the existing tramways in Oslo. The first units in the T1000 series were two single-car prototypes designated T. They were <b>test-run</b> on the existing tramways from 1959 to 1960, and were then put into service on the Kolsås Line. Prone to technical faults, they were taken out of regular service in 1982.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s, NSB {{started to}} {{consider}} {{replacement of the}} class. In 1971 and 1973, El 11 and El 13 were <b>test-run</b> on the line, and {{it was concluded that}} El 11 would be suitable with minor adjustments. However, the 1960s replacement of steam locomotives had caused a shortage of electric locomotives. Not until 1980 did NSB start the upgrade process of two El 11s. From 1980s, only a single El 9 was stationed on the Flåm Line during winter, and the other two were used for local trains on the Bergen Line in Hallingdal. If the unit stationed in Flåm was out of order, it was replaced by a Class 64 unit. Lack of spare parts and limited reliability accelerated the need to replace the units in scheduled trains. The first unit was taken into use on the Flåm Line in 1983 and the second in 1984. Two El 9s were transferred to Ål Station and Voss Station where they hauled work trains. Unit 2062 was taken out of service in 1983. The other two remained in regular service until 1988. Unit 2063 has been painted green and is on display at Flåm Station, while 2064 has retained the red color scheme and is stored at Tinnoset Station, belonging to the Norwegian Railway Museum.|$|E

40|$|Context & motivation: Today, {{embedded}} systems are increasingly interconnected and {{operate in a}} rich context of systems and internet-based services. Iterative development is one strategy of developing such cyber-physical systems. It enables exploration of early prototypes of a feature {{in the context of}} its intended use and collecting telemetric data from <b>test-runs.</b> This is a rich data source that can be leveraged for learning behavioural requirements for a feature. Question/problem: However, we found practitioners struggling with deriving requirements for the next iteration from such <b>test-runs</b> in a systematic and repeatable way. Principal ideas/results: We allow test drivers to add markers when the system behaves unexpectedly by introducing a dedicated feedback tool. Preliminary evaluation shows that these markers lead to better feedback to the development team and indicates a positive impact on the development cycle. Contribution: We give an example, report experiences, and discuss industrial implications of feedback systems and in situ requirements gathering in iterative system development...|$|R
40|$|Cyber-physical {{systems are}} {{nowadays}} {{used as the}} term for systems which perceive data from their surroundings for algorithmic processing and enrichment by digital informa-tion to generate interactions in their specific context. In recent days, a prominent example for these systems are au-tonomously driving vehicles that continuously have to sense their environment to calculate the next set points for their control algorithms. The development of these complex and interconnected systems requires the combined utilization of simulations and <b>test-runs</b> in reality to assess the system’s quality and to increase the developer’s and customer’s confi-dence in the resulting implementation. The combination of interactive as well as unattended simulated system tests {{has to be in}} tight coordination with their real counterparts to derive reliable results {{on the one hand and}} to save valuable resources on the other hand.

40|$|Abstract: Vehicle’s {{passengers}} and other traffic participants are protected {{more and more}} by integral safety systems. They continuously perceive the vehicle’s environment to prevent dangerous situations by e. g. emergency braking systems. Furthermore, increasingly intelligent vehicle functions are still of major interest {{in research and development}} {{to reduce the risk of}} accidents. However, the development and testing of these functions should not rely only on validations on proving grounds and on long-term <b>test-runs</b> in real traffic; instead, they should be extended by virtual testing approaches to model potentially dangerous situations or to re-run specific traffic situations easily. This article outlines meta-metrics as one of today’s challenges for the software engineering of these cyber-physical systems to provide guidance during the system development: For example, unstable results of simulation <b>test-runs</b> over the vehicle function’s revision history are elaborated as an indicating metric where to focus on with real or further virtual test-runs; furthermore, varying acting time points for the same virtual traffic situation are indicating problems with the reliability to interpret the specific situation. In this article, several of such meta-metrics are discussed and assigned both to different phases during the series development and to different levels of detailedness of virtual testing approaches. ...|$|R

500|$|NOK400,000 was {{borrowed}} and NOK510,000 {{invested in}} a ferry from Moen & Sønns. It arrived at Levanger on 31 December 1957 and was named Innherredsferja.

During the <b>test-run</b> {{it became clear that}} the quay at Vangshylla was [...] too narrow to allow the ferry to dock. The first ferry service had ten different route combinations in each direction, and the fees were based on three different zones.

The initial prices were NOK1 for one person in Zone 1, NOK2.50 in Zone 2 and NOK3.5 in Zone 3. For cars, the prices were NOK5, 10 and 14, respectively. On workdays, the ferry made two round trips to Ytterøy and Levanger, three round trips to Venneshamn and five round trips to Vangshylla and Kjerringvik. At Levanger, both ferries corresponded with north- and southbound trains on the Nordland Line at Levanger Station, which is within walking distance of the quay.

Non-verbal vocalisations such as laughter, breathing, hesitation, {{and consent}} play an {{important}} role in the recognition and understanding of human conversational speech and spontaneous affect.

As classifiers we employ Hidden Markov Models, Conditional Random Fields, and Support Vector Machines, respectively. For discussion of extensive parameter optimisation <b>test-runs</b> with respect to features and model topology, 2. 9 k non-verbals are extracted from the spontaneous Audio-Visual Interest Corpus. 80. 7 % accuracy can be reported with, and 92. 6 % without a garbage model for the discrimination of the named classes. ...|$|R
