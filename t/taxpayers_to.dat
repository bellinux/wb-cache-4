5|$|It {{has always}} been {{important}} for the Space Telescope to capture the public's imagination, given the considerable contribution of <b>taxpayers</b> <b>to</b> its construction and operational costs. After the difficult early years when the faulty mirror severely dented Hubble's reputation with the public, the first servicing mission allowed its rehabilitation as the corrected optics produced numerous remarkable images.|$|E
5|$|UBS France {{executive}} Patrick de Fayet {{was among}} three local branch executives being investigated. UBS wealth management bankers allegedly {{broke the law}} by enabling French <b>taxpayers</b> <b>to</b> hide their assets in UBS-controlled offshore assets to avoid paying taxes. The bankers undertook to direct their French clients' assets to UBS's Switzerland operation, rather than keep the money in France. UBS set aside approximately US$2 billion in expected liability for its currency rigging and French tax evasion cases.|$|E

25|$|During {{his time}} as Chancellor, funding for the University System began to shift from state <b>taxpayers</b> <b>to</b> private hands, which {{required}} campuses to seek revenue from tuition increases, from outside research grants and contracts, and from outside donations.

25|$|A {{tax credit}} {{is a tax}} {{incentive}} which allows certain <b>taxpayers</b> <b>to</b> subtract {{the amount of the}} credit they have accrued from the total they owe the state. It may also be a credit granted in recognition of taxes already paid or, as in the United Kingdom, a form of state support.|$|E
25|$|The {{school board}} chose to not {{participate}} in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program.

25|$|Income {{inequality}} can {{be addressed}} by pre-tax (market) income policies ("pre-distribution") that raise worker pay, as well as after-tax policies that raise taxes on higher-income <b>taxpayers</b> <b>to</b> fund transfers to lower-income taxpayers ("redistribution"). President Obama attempted both strategies, with some success in reducing both the pre-tax and after-tax share of income of the top 1% measured 2012 to 2013 (the most recent CBO data available as of December 2016), which means the share of income of the bottom 99% increased.|$|E

5000|$|The {{decision}} {{here that}} section 260 {{did not apply}} extended the prior [...] "choice principle" [...] from Keighery v Federal Commissioner of Taxation. That case allowed the <b>taxpayer</b> <b>to</b> choose between two alternatives in the act, the Mullens decision allowed a <b>taxpayer</b> <b>to</b> enter {{a particular set of}} circumstances described by the act for the purpose of gaining the effects it described, even if those effects were beneficial. This latter principle was subsequently used in cases such as Cridland.|$|R
25|$|In {{response}} to the 1890 Amendments to the federal Morrill Act, Virginia designated the normal school {{as one of its}} land grant colleges. The United States Congress required that states either open their land-grant colleges (supported by all <b>taxpayers)</b> <b>to</b> all races or else establish additional land-grant educational facilities for blacks. Following the Reconstruction era, white Democrats had regained power in the Virginia state legislature (and across the former Confederacy); they had established Jim Crow racial segregation in public facilities, including schools and colleges.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, {{the federal}} income tax varied from a bracket of 1% (for single tax payers) and 0.77% (for married <b>taxpayers)</b> <b>to</b> the maximum rate of 11.5%. Individuals earning below 13,600 and couples earning below 27,000 Swiss francs were exempt. On cantonal level, tax rates varies heavily, Obwalden adapted a 1.8% flat tax on all {{personal}} income following a cantonal referendum in 2007. In most cantons, the rate is proportional with a maximum rate of 6.5% in Bern, whereas in Zurich it was 13% and in Geneva 17.58-.76% (depending upon taxes as single or jointly).|$|E
25|$|Proponents of a {{consumption}} tax {{argue that the}} income tax system creates perverse incentives by encouraging <b>taxpayers</b> <b>to</b> spend rather than save: a taxpayer is only taxed once on income spent immediately, while any interest earned on saved income is itself taxed. To the extent that this is considered unjust, it may be remedied {{in a variety of}} ways, e.g. excluding investment income from taxable income, making investments deductible and therefore only taxing them when gains are realized, or replacing the income tax by other forms of tax, such as a sales tax.|$|E
50|$|Second, {{there could}} be a benefit to prepaying {{expenses}} if the <b>taxpayer</b> expects <b>to</b> be in a lower tax bracket in the next taxable year. It is more worthwhile for a <b>taxpayer</b> <b>to</b> reduce his taxable income in a year when the income will be taxed at a higher bracket.|$|R
50|$|The {{courts have}} ruled {{that there is}} no legal {{requirement}} that an IRS tax form bear an OMB control number in order for a <b>taxpayer</b> <b>to</b> be legally obligated to file Federal income tax returns and pay the related taxes, and there is no requirement of an OMB number in order for the <b>taxpayer</b> <b>to</b> be properly convicted of tax crimes—as these are tax obligations imposed by statute and therefore cannot be obviated by presence or lack of an OMB control number on a tax form.|$|R

25|$|Rental {{income is}} subject to real estate income tax in Iran. A fixed {{deduction}} of 25% of the gross income is extended to all <b>taxpayers</b> <b>to</b> account for income-generating expenses. The net income, which is 75% of the gross rent, is then {{subject to the same}} rates as in the above table (max. 35%). Rental income is exempted from real estate tax if the property is a residential property leased as such and measures up to 150 sq. m. if it is located in Tehran (up to 200 sq. m. if it is located {{in other parts of the}} country).|$|E
25|$|Tax {{choice is}} {{the theory that}} taxpayers should have more control with how their {{individual}} taxes are allocated. If taxpayers could choose which government organizations received their taxes, opportunity cost decisions would integrate their partial knowledge. For example, a taxpayer who allocated more of his taxes on public education would have less to allocate on public healthcare. Supporters argue that allowing <b>taxpayers</b> <b>to</b> demonstrate their preferences would help ensure that the government succeeds at efficiently producing the public goods that taxpayers truly value. This would end real estate speculation, business cycles, unemployment and distribute wealth much more evenly. Joseph Stiglitz's Henry George Theorem predicts its sufficiency because—as George also noted—public spending raises land value.|$|E
25|$|U.S. persons owning {{or having}} {{signatory}} authority of these foreign accounts or other specified financial assets must report {{them on a}} new IRS Form 8938, Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets, which is filed with the person's U.S. tax returns if the accounts are generally worth more than US$50,000; a higher reporting threshold applies to U.S. persons who are overseas residents and joint filers. Account holders {{would be subject to}} a 40% penalty on understatements of income in an undisclosed foreign financial asset. Understatements of greater than 25% of gross income are subject to an extended statute of limitations period of 6 years. It also requires <b>taxpayers</b> <b>to</b> report financial assets that are not held in a custodial account, i.e. physical stock or bond certificates.|$|E

25|$|Plans for {{relocation}} {{were first}} mooted {{in the early}} 1990s, but due to various objections and financial obstacles, the club has continued to play at Fratton Park. Most recently, plans for relocation have included new stadia on a site offered by the Royal Navy at Horsea Island, between Stamshaw and Port Solent, and on reclaimed land in Portsmouth Harbour beside the existing naval base. The former was mooted as a possible 2018 FIFA World Cup venue as part of England's bid process. However, {{the cost to the}} city's <b>taxpayers</b> <b>to</b> join the bid was deemed too great a risk to take. A third, oft returned-to option, is to build a new stadium {{on the site of the}} existing Fratton Park.|$|E
25|$|On October 24, 2012, American federal {{prosecutors}} filed a $1 billion civil lawsuit against Bank of America for mortgage fraud under the False Claims Act, which provides for possible penalties of triple the damages suffered. The government asserted that Countrywide, which {{was acquired by}} Bank of America, rubber-stamped mortgage loans to risky borrowers and forced <b>taxpayers</b> <b>to</b> guarantee billions of bad loans through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The suit was filed by Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, the inspector general of FHFA and the special inspector for the Troubled Asset Relief Program. In March 2014, Bank of America settled the suit by agreeing to pay $6.3 billion to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and to buy back around $3.2 billion worth of mortgage bonds.|$|E
