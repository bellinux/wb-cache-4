5000|$|Because of its late {{reproductive}} age, low reproductive rate, high young mortality, {{and long}} lifespan, the ornate box turtle {{is subject to}} pressure from intrinsic factors that limit the population growth. [...] Young turtles are vulnerable to predation until the shell {{is strong enough to}} be a major protection (except from being run over by cars). [...] The loss of any older females is a problem, because they don’t get replaced very fast. Climatic factors are also possible threats to the ornate box turtle. Because the sex of turtles is strongly influenced by temperature, the sex ratio can be changed by climatic extremes and result in a population that is mostly all one sex for several years in a row. This gender imbalance would affect the survival of small groups that would be threatened by the occurrence of a genetic bottleneck which means the gene pool would be too small and cause inbreeding and mortality. The bottleneck effect is a double-edged sword for species that live a long time because the loss of genetic diversity would not be as obvious or as severe, but once it occurred, it would be harder to recover. [...] The other thing about the ornate box turtle’s life history <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> for its survival is its home range philopatry, which means that it returns to the same area every time and so disruptions in the area make it more vulnerable.|$|E
