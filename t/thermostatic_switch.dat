In 1922, he collaborated with fellow MIT professor William H. Timbie on Principles of Electrical Engineering, an introductory textbook. AMRAD's lucrative contracts from World War I had been cancelled, and Bush attempted to reverse the company's fortunes by developing a <b>thermostatic</b> <b>switch</b> invented by Al Spencer, an AMRAD technician, on his own time. AMRAD's management {{was not interested in}} the device, but had no objection to its sale. Bush found backing from Laurence K. Marshall and Richard S. Aldrich to create the Spencer Thermostat Company, which hired Bush as a consultant. The new company soon had revenues in excess of a million dollars. It merged with General Plate Company to form Metals & Controls Corporation in 1931, and with Texas Instruments in 1959. Texas Instruments sold it to Bain Capital in 2006, and it became a separate company again as Sensata Technologies in 2010.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{intercooler}} {{required a}} radiator, the radiator under the starboard wing was halved {{in size and}} the intercooler radiator housed alongside. Under the port wing a new radiator fairing housed a square oil cooler alongside the other half-radiator unit. When the engine was running at low speed, one radiator section provided enough coolant; a <b>thermostatic</b> <b>switch</b> turned off the starboard radiator section until more power was called for and extra engine cooling was required.|$|E
5000|$|In automobiles, a {{mechanical}} fan provides engine cooling and prevents the engine from overheating by blowing or drawing air through a coolant-filled radiator. The fan may be driven with a {{belt and pulley}} off the engine's crankshaft or an electric motor switched on or off by a <b>thermostatic</b> <b>switch.</b>|$|E
50|$|Edward E. Freeman {{invented a}} system to control a hot air furnace that uses three <b>{{thermostat}}ic</b> <b>switches</b> for its operation. A room thermostat starts the stoker. Another thermostat (or limit switch) opens the stoker circuit when {{the air in the}} furnace reaches a predetermined temperature, irrespective {{of the fact that the}} room thermostat may still call for heat. This second thermostat operates to prevent unsafe conditions due to overheating. The third thermostat is also in the furnace. It controls a fan which forces hot air from the furnace to the rooms. It does not permit the fan to start until the air in the furnace reaches a specified degree of heat. But, at that point, it starts the fan, which continues to run, even though the limit switch has stopped the stoker, so long as the furnace is hot and the room thermostat calls for heat. The patent was on the combination patent of three <b>thermostatic</b> <b>switches,</b> not on any of the switches alone and not on the combination of the fan switch and the limit switch.|$|R
50|$|In November 1932, Mid-Continent mailed Mercoid {{a formal}} notice of {{infringement}} of the Cross patent. In August 1935, Mid-Continent brought suit against E.O. Smith of Carthage, Missouri, for infringement of the Cross patent by installing {{in his home}} a heating system including controls manufactured by Mercoid. Mercoid provided the defense of Smith but was not made {{a party to the}} suit. Mid-Continent prevailed against Smith. In September 1940, Mid-Continent sued Mercoid in Chicago federal district court for contributory infringement of the Cross patent. Mercoid, Mid-Continent, and Honeywell did not make heating systems; they sold <b>thermostatic</b> <b>switches</b> and related products. On Mercoid's motion, the court made Honeywell an involuntary co-plaintiff.|$|R
5000|$|... e. Although Beech did not {{encounter}} {{any problem}} in detanking during acceptance tests, {{it was not}} possible to detank oxygen tank no. 2 using normal procedures at KSC. Tests and analyses indicate that this was due to gas leakage through the displaced fill tube assembly added. [...] f. The special detanking procedures at KSC subjected the tank to an extended period of heater operation and pressure cycling. These procedures had not been used before added, and the tank had not been qualified by test for the conditions experienced. However, the procedures did not violate the specifications which governed the operation of the heaters at KSC. [...] g. In reviewing these procedures before the flight, officials of NASA, ER, and Beech did not recognize the possibility of damage due to overheating. Many of these officials were not aware of the extended heater operation. In any event, adequate <b>thermostatic</b> <b>switches</b> might have been expected to protect the tank added. [...] h. [...] "A number of factors contributed to the presence of inadequate <b>thermostatic</b> <b>switches</b> in the heater assembly. The original 1962 specifications from NR to Beech Aircraft Corporation for the tank and heater assembly specified the use of 28 V added dc power, which is used in the spacecraft. In 1965, NR issued a revised specification which stated that the heaters should use a 65 V added dc power supply for tank pressurization; this was the power supply used at KSC to reduce pressurization time. Beech ordered switches for the Block II tanks but did not change the switch specifications to be compatible with 65 V dc." ...|$|R
50|$|A fan-assisted {{radiator}} {{contains a}} heat exchanger fed by hot {{water from the}} heating system. A <b>thermostatic</b> <b>switch</b> energises an electric fan which blows air over the heat exchanger to circulate it in a room. Its advantages are small relative size and even distribution of heat. Disadvantages are fan noise {{and the need for}} both a source of heat and a separate electrical supply.|$|E

50|$|Engine-driven {{fans are}} often {{regulated}} by a viscous-drive clutch from the drivebelt, which slips {{and reduces the}} fan speed at low temperatures. This improves fuel efficiency by not wasting power on driving the fan unnecessarily. On modern vehicles, further regulation of cooling rate is provided by either variable speed or cycling radiator fans. Electric fans are controlled by a <b>thermostatic</b> <b>switch</b> or the engine control unit. Electric fans also {{have the advantage of}} giving good airflow and cooling at low engine revs or when stationary, such as in slow-moving traffic.|$|E
50|$|For {{backward}} compatibility with traditional <b>switching</b> <b>thermostatic</b> controllers, OpenTherm specified {{that if the}} two wires are connected together then the boiler will switch on.|$|R
40|$|Fencing, {{particularly}} electric fencing, {{is widely}} used across South Africa for livestock and game ranching practices. Recent studies found that leopard tortoises (Stigmochelys pardalis) {{are more prone to}} dying from electrocution along electric fences than any other taxa. However, no studies have quantified tortoise mortality along non-electric fences or assessed the impact of fence structure. With South Africa being home to more tortoise species {{than anywhere else in the}} world, thus is a conservation concern. This study quantifies tortoise mortalities associated with electrified and non-electrified fences and relates these rates to fence structure (mesh or strand). Open veld transects are used as controls to estimate background mortality. This study also reports the distribution and abundance of different fence types along 2200 km of roads in the southeastern Karoo, allowing the cumulative impacts of different fence types to be estimated. All fence types had significantly higher tortoise mortalities than open veld transects. Leopard tortoise mortalities were significantly higher along electric fences than non-electric fences. Despite forming only approximately 4 % of all roadside fencing, electric fences account for 56 % of leopard tortoise mortalities. This study validates concern for increased electric fence use in the future and the potential impacts on leopard tortoises. When considering the current abundance of fence types and their associated mortalities, the total number of leopard tortoise mortalities along electric and non-electric fences are similar. Angulate tortoise (Chersina angulata) mortalities were significantly higher along mesh fences than strand fences, but did not differ between electric and non-electric fences. Angulate tortoises appear to wedge themselves in mesh fences and are unable to escape. This study highlights the current threat of non-electric fencing on tortoises as no similar findings have been reported. These additional tortoise mortalities should be considered alongside other emerging threats when questioning the longevity of these tortoise populations, not only in the Karoo, but globally. The implementation and practicality of previously suggested mitigation strategies are discussed and alternative mitigation strategies are suggested. This study concludes that raising of the electric strands is impractical and the implementation of rock aprons are ineffective. Live tortoises displayed active behavior when temperature was above 20 Â°C, thus <b>thermostatic</b> <b>switches</b> for electric fences could potentially reduce tortoise mortalities without compromising fences function...|$|R
50|$|A {{thermostatic}} {{storage heater}} will automatically regulate {{the temperature in}} a room throughout the day. However, the operator may wish to switch the <b>thermostatic</b> <b>switch</b> to the minimum setting overnight to lower the room temperature. If the room is empty during the day, {{it is better to}} keep the thermostat at the minimum setting and then increase the setting when the room is occupied in the evening. Some thermostatic heaters also make use of on-peak electricity when there is not enough stored heat to maintain the requested temperature; the user may wish to be aware of this and lower the settings.|$|E
50|$|Walter M. Cross {{invented a}} hot-air furnace system with three main elements: (1) a motor driven stoker for feeding {{fuel to the}} {{combustion}} chamber of a furnace, (2) a room <b>thermostatic</b> <b>switch</b> for controlling the feeding of fuel, and (3) a combustion stoker switch to prevent the fire's going out in warm weather not requiring domestic heating. The room thermostat the supply of heat, or discontinues its supply, by closing or opening the circuit to the stoker motor at the required temperatures. The combustion stoker switch, or holdfire control, responds to a low temperature in the furnace by causing the stoker to feed fuel so as to prevent the furnace fire from going out. The control of the combustion stoker switch is effective in mild weather when the room thermostat may not call for heat for a considerable period.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "shoulder" [...] {{joint of}} Opportunitys arm has had {{troubles}} since Sol 2 (January 25, 2004), the rover's second day on Mars. Engineers {{discovered that the}} heater on the shoulder azimuth joint, which controls side-to-side motion of the robotic arm, was stuck in the [...] "on" [...] position. Closer investigation revealed that the on-off switch had probably failed during assembly, test, and launch operations on Earth. Fortunately for Opportunity, the rover was equipped with a built-in safety mechanism called a [...] "T-stat box" [...] (<b>thermostatic</b> <b>switch)</b> that provided protection against overheating. When the shoulder azimuth joint, also known as Joint 1, got too hot, the T-stat switch automatically opened and temporarily disabled the heater. When the joint got cold again, the T-stat closed. As a result, the heater stayed on all night but not all day.|$|E
50|$|Heated {{air intake}} systems operate on the {{principle}} of increasing the temperature of the air. The fuel will more effectively stay in suspension in the air rather than falling out of suspension and forming droplets {{on the floor of the}} manifold. Warm air from the outside of an exhaust manifold is drawn up into the air cleaner to increase the air temperature as quickly as possible after the engine starts. The air cleaner assembly incorporates a thermostatic vacuum switch that responds to the air temperature after the air filter element and actuates a vacuum motor that moves the control flap to allow the air to be drawn from a cooler location such as the top of the engine bay or outside the engine bay. If the air becomes too cold, the <b>thermostatic</b> <b>switch</b> will automatically change back to drawing heated air from around the outside of the exhaust.|$|E

5000|$|The Freeman patent was {{assigned}} to Honeywell, which licensed five of its manufacturing competitors. The licenses grant a nonexclusive right to make, use, and sell a [...] "combination furnace control" [...] which {{is defined as a}} <b>thermostatic</b> <b>switch</b> usable for a Freeman installation and designed in one unit to control the fan and limit circuits. Royalty payments to Honeywell are based on the sales of the combination furnace controls, which are not patented as such (the system that includes them is patented) but have no use except in practicing the patent. The court of appeals said that the combination furnace control provides [...] "the sequence of operations which is the precise essence of Freeman's advance in the art," [...] in that it [...] "accomplishes the sequence of operations of the Freeman patent" [...] and [...] "distinguished the invention" [...] from the prior art.Each licensee was required to provide a notice to the effect that purchasing the control confers a license for one installation of the Freeman heating system. Minneapolis-Honeywell tried on several occasions to induce Mercoid to take a license but was unsuccessful.|$|E
5000|$|The safety {{mechanism}} worked until Opportunity approached the first winter on Mars. As the Sun began to retreat {{lower in the}} sky and solar power levels dropped, it became clear that Opportunity {{would not be able to}} keep the batteries charged with a heater draining power all night long. On Sol [...] (May 28, 2004), rover operators began using a procedure known as [...] "deep sleep," [...] during which Opportunity disconnected the batteries at night. Deep sleep prevented the stuck heater (and everything else on the rover except the clock and the battery heaters) from drawing power. When the Sun came up the next morning and sunlight began hitting the solar arrays, the batteries automatically reconnected, the robotic arm became operational, the shoulder joint warmed up, and the <b>thermostatic</b> <b>switch</b> opened, disabling the heater. As a result, the shoulder joint was extremely hot during the day and extremely cold at night. Such huge temperature swings, which tend to make electric motors wear out faster, were taking place every sol.|$|E
40|$|There is {{provided}} a {{climate control system}} for a parked vehicle that includes a solar panel, <b>thermostatic</b> <b>switch,</b> fans, and thermoelectric coolers. The solar panel can serve as the sole source of electricity for the system. The system affords convenient installation and removal by including solar panels that are removably attached to the exterior of a vehicle. A connecting wire electrically connects the solar panels to a housing that is removably mounted to a partially opened window on the vehicle. The <b>thermostatic</b> <b>switch,</b> fans, and thermoelectric coolers are included within the housing. The <b>thermostatic</b> <b>switch</b> alternates {{the direction of the}} current flow through the thermoelectric coolers to selectively heat or cool the interior of the vehicle. The interior surface of the thermoelectric coolers are in contact with interior heat sinks that have air circulated across them by an interior fan. Similarly, the exterior surface of the thermoelectric coolers are in contact with exterior heat sinks that have air circulated across them by an exterior fan...|$|E
