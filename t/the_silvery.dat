5000|$|<b>The</b> Mississippi <b>Silvery</b> Minnow {{gets its}} name {{in part to}} its appearance. Majority of this fish is covered in silver scales that are very {{reflective}} with a large dark stipe {{down the center of}} their back. The average minnow length is between 12 and 13 centimeters. <b>The</b> Mississippi <b>Silvery</b> Minnow has a lateral line on each side of its body. These minnows have a pair of pectoral fins, along with a pair of small pelvic fins. <b>The</b> Mississippi <b>Silvery</b> Minnow, like many other minnows, have an anal fin, dorsal fin, and a powerful caudal fin. The dorsal fin is very centered between the head and the caudal fin. All fins on the fish have no makings and are transparent. <b>The</b> Mississippi <b>Silvery</b> minnow closely resembles the Cypress minnow.|$|R

25|$|As they {{approach}} {{the time when they}} are ready to migrate out to the sea the parr lose their camouflage bars and undergo a process of physiological changes which allows them to survive the shift from freshwater to saltwater. At this point salmon are called smolt. Smolt spend time in the brackish waters of the river estuary while their body chemistry adjusts their osmoregulation to cope with the higher salt levels they will encounter in the ocean. Smolt also grow <b>the</b> <b>silvery</b> scales which visually confuse ocean predators. When they have matured sufficiently in late spring, and are about 15 to 20 centimetres long, the smolt swim out of the rivers and into the sea. There they spend their first year as a post-smolt. Post-smolt form schools with other post-smolt, and set off to find deep-sea feeding grounds. They then spend up to four more years as adult ocean salmon while their full swimming ability and reproductive capacity develop.|$|E

500|$|Like other fairywrens, male red-winged fairywrens {{have been}} {{observed}} carrying brightly coloured petals to display to females {{as part of a}} courtship ritual. In this species, the petals that have been recorded have been yellow or, rarely, white. Petals are displayed and presented to a female in the male fairywren's own, or another's, territory. The [...] "face fan" [...] display is commonly seen as a part of aggressive or sexual display behaviours; it involves the flaring of the blue ear tufts by erecting the feathers. <b>The</b> <b>silvery</b> blue upper back feathers are also used more prominently in display than other species.|$|E
500|$|The gills are {{narrowly}} adnate (attached squarely to the stem) {{or have a}} short decurrent tooth, and {{are packed}} close together, with 30–38 gills reaching the stem. They are broad anteriorly (4–7mm), white or whitish, in age flushed with pink, often with sordid-brownish stains, and with edges pallid and even. The stem is [...] long, [...] thick, very brittle and cartilaginous, equal, and tubular. It sometimes has a well-developed pseudorrhiza that resembles white cotton, and the base is covered with stiff white hairs, and often it stains reddish brown. The surface has fine straight or sometimes twisted longitudinal striations.

[...] Then, as the bronzer foliage takes on more mature tones, the sky is radiant and streaked with green and orange, and then again, further into autumn, the leaves take on violet tones something of the color of a ripe fig, and this violet effect manifests itself most fully with the contrast of the large, whitening sun within its pale halo of light lemon.

The miller initially offers no resistance and allows Olivero to release the woman, whom he recognises by the colour of her skin to be Sally, one of the two green children who had mysteriously arrived in the village on the day he left, thirty years earlier; Olivero also recognises the miller as Kneeshaw, an ex-pupil at the village school where he had once taught. During a struggle between the two men Kneeshaw is accidentally drowned in the mill pond.

Pareles further noted that [...] "The wardrobe entices men, but it's also a means of self-assertion". J.

Lee Hildebrand of the San Francisco Chronicle praised the costumes saying that [...] "every one [...] fabulously glamorous, most of them tailored to highlight the singer's ample cleavage {{and a pair of}} legs to rival Tina Turner's. At one point, when the legs were concealed by a long scarlet gown, wind blew from underneath to expose them."

Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter also echoed her statements, [...] "to say that Beyonce looks terrific is probably redundant. Her fashion parade of form-fitting, eye-catching costumes -- most notably a belly dancer's get-up in which she demonstrated some hip-shaking moves that indicated Shakira better watch her back -- provided ample opportunities for shameless leering."

[...] Irish Independents Eamon Sweeney noted that Knowles looked [...] "absolutely stunning" [...] and added, [...] "I have to confess that the sight of Beyoncé ripping off a short cocktail dress to reveal a barely there bodysuit will linger in my memory for years to come." [...] A writer of The StarPhoenix wrote that Knowles looked like a [...] "silver-clad siren rose" [...] further saying that [...] "it was almost surreal to see the woman who frequents the covers of fashion magazines in the same room". Tonya Turner from The Courier-Mail praised Knowles for looking [...] "every bit the dream girl in a sparkling silver floorlength gown".|$|E
