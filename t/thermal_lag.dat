40|$|This paper {{considers}} the possible benefits of mitigation {{of climate change}} for coastal areas with {{a strong emphasis on}} sea-level rise as {{this is one of the}} most certain consequences of human-induced global warming.

Therefore, while climate stabilisation reduces coastal impacts during the 21 st century, compared to unmitigated emissions, the largest benefits may occur in the 22 nd century (and beyond). The results of the analysis suggest that a mixture of adaptation and mitigation policies need to be considered for coastal areas, as this will provide a more robust response to human-induced climate change than either policy in isolation. This requires the joint evaluation of mitigation and adaptation in coastal areas, ideally using a probabilistic risk-based methodology, which would be a departure from existing analyses.

Calvin Alexander, Jr. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xi, 164 pages, appendices A-F + 23 supplemental files (TXT; tab-delimited numerical data) Water temperature at springs generally provides useful information concerning aquifer geometry and recharge. Temperature monitoring at 25 springs and cave streams in southeastern Minnesota has shown four distinct thermal patterns {{that can be}} interpreted in terms of heat exchange effectiveness along a flow path {{and the nature of}} recharge. The patterns provide information {{about the size of the}} flow path, recharge type and duration, and aquifer depth. Water temperature is generally an interactive tracer, where heat exchange rapidly occurs when water and aquifer rock are at different temperatures. In a multi-tracer experiment at Freiheit Spring, MN, uranine, chloride, and δD breakthrough curves were essentially identical and conservative. In contrast, the water temperature interacted with the aquifer as it moved along the flow path, producing a damped, <b>lagged</b> <b>thermal</b> signal at the spring. However, both the conservative and nonconservative tracers provide useful geometrical information. By summing discharge between the initial increase in stage produced by a pressure pulse and the chloride peak, the conduit volume is estimated as 51 m 3. Using a heat transport simulation to reproduce the modified thermal signal requires a planar flow path with a hydraulic diameter of 7 cm. Both methods together suggest a bedding plane flow path that is 3. 5 cm high by 10 m wide, in agreement with the observed spring geometry. The different tracers provide complementary information and stronger constraints on flow path geometry than could be obtained using a single tracer. Finally, numerical simulations were run to determine variables controlling thermal retardation in karst conduits. The <b>lag</b> of a <b>thermal</b> peak in the water is proportional to a conduit's length; is proportional to the square root of recharge duration, rock thermal conductivity, rock specific heat, and rock density; and is inversely proportional to a conduit's hydraulic diameter, velocity, water specific heat, and water density. These individual relationships were then combined to form one collective function, which, when plotted against <b>thermal</b> peak <b>lag</b> produced a line in log-log space. The relationship between the <b>thermal</b> peak <b>lag</b> and the combined function potentially enables estimates of conduit geometry using <b>thermal</b> peak <b>lag</b> data...|$|R

50|$|It {{is hard to}} say {{something}} general about the soil thermal properties at a certain location because these are {{in a constant state of}} flux from diurnal and seasonal variations. Apart from the basic soil composition, which is constant at one location, soil thermal properties are strongly influenced by the soil volumetric water content, volume fraction of solids and volume fraction of air. Air is a poor thermal conductor and reduces the effectiveness of the solid and liquid phases to conduct heat. While the solid phase has the highest conductivity it is the variability of soil moisture that largely determines thermal conductivity. As such soil moisture properties and soil thermal propertiess are very closely linked and are often measured and reported together. Temperature variations are most extreme at the surface of the soil and these variations are transferred to sub surface layers but at reduced rates as depth increases.

This {{is due to a}} discontinuous correction factor in the processing software that compensates for the temperature dependence of the RH sensor. Results from chamber experiments regarding the temperature and RH dependence of RS- 06 G RH sensors under steady-state conditions showed a wet bias exceeding 7 % RH below ~+ 10 °C. As this result contradicted previous in-flight intercomparisons that used the original manufacturerʼs correction, we investigated a possible additional dry bias caused by a <b>thermal</b> <b>lag</b> in the RH sensor. We speculated that the <b>thermal</b> <b>lag</b> of the RH sensor typically causes a dry bias during a tropospheric ascent, which largely compensates for the wet bias related to the temperature and RH dependence of the RH sensor.

The effect of the <b>thermal</b> <b>lag</b> was considered using indium as a standard and corrections of > 5 ˚C were required at rates in excess of 5, 000 ˚C/s. As readily observed in conventional DSC (CDSC), PEEK exhibited a double melting endotherm and this was attributed to a melting-recrystallisation-melting process. The absence of recrystallisation above 250 ˚C allowed a Hoffman-Weeks analysis {{to be carried out}} over a broader temperature range than is general possible in CDSC. The interplay between <b>thermal</b> <b>lag</b> and re-crystallisation was analysed using heating rates covering 5 orders of magnitude.
