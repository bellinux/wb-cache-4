It's perfectly possible feathers began as fluffy extensions of reptilian scales to act as insulators... The earliest feathers might have been a different approach to hairiness among reptiles keeping warm.|$|E
5|$|Daksinakaali is {{typically}} shown {{with her right}} foot on Shiva's chest—while depictions showing Kaali with her left foot on Shiva's chest depict the even more fearsome Vamakaali. The pose shows the conclusion of an episode in which Kaali was rampaging out of control after destroying many demons. Shiva, fearing that Kaali would not stop until she destroyed the world, could only <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> way to pacify her. He {{lay down on the}} battlefield so {{that she would have to}} step on him. Seeing her consort under her foot, Kaali realized that she had gone too far, and calmed down. In some interpretations of the story, Shiva was attempting to receive Kaali's grace by receiving her foot on his chest.|$|E
5|$|In 1993 the {{evolutionary}} biologist Stephen Jay Gould compared Paley to Voltaire's Doctor Pangloss, {{the man who}} could argue any case (however hopeless). Gould is struck that Paley can claim that even the agonising pain of gallstones or gout could indicate the goodness of a loving God, with the justification that it felt so good when the pain stopped. Gould makes it clear he finds Paley's argument incorrect scientifically, but states that he respects it as a coherent and well-defended philosophy. Gould particularly respects Paley's method of identifying alternative possibilities and then systematically refuting them. Gould notes that Paley envisages a Lamarckist kind of evolution and rebuts it with the observation that men have not lost their nipples through disuse. However, Gould writes, Paley did not manage to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> more alternative, natural selection, which has no purpose at all but just kills off whatever works less well in every generation.|$|E

5|$|Nobody except Leslie {{really cares}} about the trip: Ron (Nick Offerman) just wants to fish, Ben (Adam Scott) failed to bring a tent, and Tom (Aziz Ansari) just wants to relax in his huge tent filled with luxury {{electronic}} items. Tom expresses confusion as to why Ben, a state auditor who had been helping with Pawnee's financial problems, has not returned to his old job at Indianapolis; Ben does not explain his reasons, but it is hinted he harbors romantic feelings for Leslie. Meanwhile, Andy (Chris Pratt) sets up a romantic tent for April (Aubrey Plaza) in the wrong campsite miles away, forcing him to trek through the wilderness to find everyone and leaving April miserable on the campsite without Andy. During brainstorming sessions, nobody produces any good ideas because they assume Leslie will <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>one.</b> However, she worriedly confides to Ann and Ben she cannot think of anything {{on the same level}} of the harvest festival.|$|E

500|$|Charles McNulty of the Los Angeles Times, though mildly {{critical}} {{of a few}} of the show's elements still was impressed with Fun Home, saying [...] "There have been plenty of new American musicals better put together than Fun Home, but I can't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> in recent years that has touched me as much with its tender, ironic and courageous vulnerability." [...] He states that the show's seeming weaknesses are part of the reason it succeeds, saying that it [...] "gets off to a choppy start, takes unnecessary musical detours and is staged in a rough-hewn style that sometimes seems more accidental than intentional" [...] but that it [...] "succeeds not despite these flaws but in large measure because of them. Bechdel's ironically self-aware and inwardly searching sensibility is honored by a musical that isn't afraid to reveal its awkward side." ...|$|E

500|$|Swanton {{believed}} that Constantine {{was the first}} West Indian cricketer to make an impression on the British public: [...] "he... personified West Indian cricket from the first faltering entry in the Test arena in 1928 until the post-war emergence of the trinity of Worrell, Weekes and Walcott." [...] Swanton continued: [...] "There have been many all-rounders with better records... {{but it is hard}} to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> who made a more sensational impact [...] impossible to imagine his superior as a fielder anywhere." [...] In 1934 Neville Cardus described Constantine as a [...] "genius" [...] and the [...] "most original cricketer of recent years". R. C. Robertson-Glasgow called Constantine the most exciting cricketer to watch of all his contemporaries. This was partly because his style of cricket meant that he could alter the course of a match in a short space of time, although he developed his technique to minimise risk.|$|E
500|$|The package {{illustration}} for Fate of Atlantis {{was inspired}} by the Indiana Jones movie posters of Drew Struzan. It was drawn by Eaken within three days, following disagreements with the marketing department and an external art director over which concept to use. Clint Bajakian, Peter McConnell and Michael Land created the soundtrack for the game, arranging John Williams' main theme [...] "The Raiders March" [...] for a variety of compositions. The DOS version uses sequenced music played back by either an internal speaker, the FM synthesis of an AdLib or Sound Blaster sound card, or the sample-based synthesis of a Roland MT-32 sound module. During development of the game, William Messner-Loebs and Dan Barry wrote a Dark Horse Comics series based on Barwood's and Falstein's story, then titled Indiana Jones and the Keys to Atlantis. In an interview, Eaken mentioned hour-long meetings of the development team {{trying to come up with}} a better title than Fate of Atlantis, though the staff members could never <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> and always ended up with names such as [...] "Indiana Jones Does Atlantis". The final title was Barwood's idea, who first had to convince the company's management and the marketing team not to simply call the game [...] "Indy's Next Adventure".|$|E
500|$|Staff writer Tracy Tormé was {{not pleased}} with the [...] "1940s tribal Africa" [...] theme of the aliens, and because the combat scene {{towards the end of}} the episode resembled the Kirk versus Spock fight in [...] episode [...] "Amok Time". Fellow Star Trek writer Maurice Hurley said that it was [...] "a good idea, but the {{execution}} just fell apart. Again, if you take that script and if the actors had been told to give it a different twist, that show would have been different. But it became too baroque and fell apart. But the concept of having a guy say 'I have to have somebody kill my wife and this is the person' is a good idea." [...] Some of the cast, including Jonathan Frakes, sought to prevent the episode from being re-aired. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly in 2012, Patrick Stewart agreed with fans that considered the season 2 episode [...] "" [...] to be [...] "the first truly great episode of the series", stating that the first season [...] "had several quite weak episodes"; referring to [...] "Code of Honor" [...] in particular he said, [...] "I can <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> very early on that involved a race of black aliens that we all felt quite embarrassed about." ...|$|E

Ringmaster offers a behind-the-scenes look at would-be guests who apply to a Springer-like show. The same year, Springer also released an unrelated autobiography named Ringmaster. He quipped, [...] "I can only <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> title a year." ...|$|E
2500|$|Literary critic Harold Bloom {{argued that}} even though the word misandry is {{relatively}} unheard of in literature {{it is not hard to}} find implicit, even explicit, misandry. In reference to the works of Shakespeare Bloom argued [...] "I cannot <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> instance of misogyny whereas I would argue that misandry is a strong element. Shakespeare makes perfectly clear that women in general have to marry down and that men are narcissistic and not to be trusted and so forth. On the whole, he gives us a darker vision of human males than human females." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, McCartney {{said the}} initial {{idea for the}} song began with Bobby Rydell's hit [...] "Forget Him" [...] with its call and {{response}} pattern, and that [...] "as often happens, you <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> song when you write another ... I'd planned an 'answering song' where a couple of us would sing 'she loves you' and the other ones would answer 'yeah yeah'. We decided that was a crummy idea {{but at least we}} then had the idea of a song called 'She Loves You'. So we sat in the hotel bedroom for a few hours and wrote it—John and I, sitting on twin beds with guitars." [...] It was completed the following day at McCartney's family home in Forthlin Road, Liverpool.|$|E

2500|$|However, Sampson {{controversially}} left Harkes off the World Cup squad, citing [...] "leadership issues", {{although the}} decision was never fully explained at the time. The bitterness resulting from the omission and {{the irony of the}} [...] "Captain for Life" [...] title would serve as the inspiration for his autobiography, Captain for Life: And Other Temporary Assignments (...) , co-written with Denise Kiernan and published in 1999. In the book, Harkes criticized Sampson for lacking [...] "credibility to a group of guys who had hundreds and hundreds of caps among them" [...] and [...] "putting a huge amount of pressure on young, internationally inexperienced players", and concluded, [...] "I can't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> thing that Steve did right {{in the months leading up}} to the World Cup". The 1998 team went on to lose all three games in the group stage, finishing last overall.|$|E
2500|$|... "River" [...] is an {{instrumental}} track, of which Nicky suggested its title {{as the music}} made him <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> when he heard it. He knew Enya had the final decision over song titles if she preferred another, but she liked his title and went with it. Nicky spoke about Enya's style of composing for song: [...] "There are five synths Midi'd but then she plays chords over these random arpeggiators with notes popping in and out where you don't expect them. Somehow she makes that work". [...] "The Longships" [...] makes reference to the longship war boats used by the Vikings, who first invaded Ireland in AD 795 and settled in Dublin by AD 841. [...] "Na Laetha Geal M'óige", translated from Gaelic as [...] "The Brighter Days of My Youth", is about the reminiscence of the days during Enya's childhood, and receives a dedication in Gaelic to her grandparents.|$|E

[...] Also, Kennedy and the Democrats hammered relentlessly at the administration's foreign and defense policies, citing a [...] "missile gap" [...] that left the U.S. at a disadvantage against the Soviet's ICBM forces. [...] This charge was proven untrue the following year. [...] Also, {{the collapse of the}} 1960 summit between Eisenhower, Soviet Premier Nikita Khruschev, French President Charles de Gaulle and British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, over the downing of an American U-2 spy plane over Soviet territory provided Democrats with ample ammunition. In addition, on August 24, Eisenhower made what some consider the worst gaffe of his presidency by responding to a reporter's question about the contributions of Vice President Nixon to major decisions: [...] "If you give me a week, I might <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>one.</b> I don't remember."

2500|$|In {{his guest}} review for Roger Ebert's website, Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times {{outright}} panned the film, giving it zero {{out of four}} stars, calling it [...] "aggressively tasteless", and {{going so far as}} to say [...] "Movie 43 is the Citizen Kane of awful". He wrote that the film has nothing in common with The Groove Tube and The Kentucky Fried Movie, two [...] "very funny and influential" [...] sketch-comedy films. He additionally criticized Movie 43 for what he calls [...] "female humiliation", saying that although the men are [...] "jerks, idiots, dolts and fools", the women have it even worse. Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph described Farrelly's film as [...] "the work of a confused man thrashing around in an industry he no longer understands". Peter Howell of the Toronto Star gave the film zero out of four stars and called it the worst film he had ever seen. Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News gave it a negative review, saying, [...] "As a film critic, I've seen nearly 4,000 movies over the last fifteen years.
