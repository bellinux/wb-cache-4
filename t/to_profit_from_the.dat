5|$|The castle {{became the}} {{administrative}} centre for the earldom {{and was used}} by Robert's court. There was already an existing market held at nearby St Stephen's church by the local canons, but Robert appropriated it and moved the market to outside his new castle, intending <b>to</b> <b>profit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> trade. A watermill was built to the south-west of the castle.|$|E
5|$|The {{extension}} to Golders Green {{would take the}} railway out of the urban and suburban areas and into open farmland.

5|$|In 1258, Henry faced {{a revolt}} among the English barons. Anger had grown {{about the way}} the King's {{officials}} were raising funds, the influence of the Poitevins at court and his unpopular Sicilian policy; even the English Church had grievances over its treatment by the King. The Welsh were still in open revolt, and now allied themselves with Scotland. Henry was also critically short of money; although he still had some reserves of gold and silver, they were totally insufficient to cover his potential expenditures, including the campaign for Sicily and his debts to the Papacy. Critics suggested darkly that he had never really intended to join the crusades, and was simply intending <b>to</b> <b>profit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> crusading tithes. To compound the situation, the harvests in England failed. Within Henry's court there was a strong feeling that the King would be unable to lead the country through these problems.|$|E
5|$|Meeker {{was born}} in Butler County, Ohio, to Jacob and Phoebe Meeker. His family {{relocated}} to Indiana {{when he was a}} boy. He married Eliza Jane Sumner in 1851; the following year the couple, with Ezra's brother and with their newborn son, set out for the Oregon Territory, where land could be claimed and settled on. Although they endured hardships on the Trail in the journey of nearly six months, the entire party survived the trek. Meeker and his family briefly stayed near Portland, then journeyed north to live in the Puget Sound region. They settled at what is now Puyallup in 1862, where Meeker grew hops for use in brewing beer. By 1887, his business had made him wealthy, and his wife built a large mansion for the family. In 1891 an infestation of hop aphids destroyed his crops and took much of his fortune. He later tried his hand at a number of ventures, and made four largely unsuccessful trips to the Klondike, taking groceries and hoping <b>to</b> <b>profit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> gold rush.|$|E

50|$|Service {{plans are}} seen mainly in office stores and {{electronics}} retailers, {{largely because of}} perceived fragility of electronics hardware and insecurity {{over the use of}} refurbished product. Some items such as computers and sale items produce very little profit for retailers, so selling service plans and accessories is essential <b>to</b> <b>profiting</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> transaction (see Loss leader). In these cases, service plans are usually bundled with additional high-margin services, such as phone support, at reduced prices to add to the perceived value of purchasing them.|$|R
