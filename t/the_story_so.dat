5|$|In 2000, the U.S. Department of Justice {{completed}} {{the investigation into}} Jowers' claims but did not find evidence to support allegations about conspiracy. The investigation report recommended no further investigation unless some new reliable facts are presented.

5|$|The Country Sunrise News {{stated that}} the drama has a fast pace. Mallory Clarkson of the London Community News {{reported}} that, while She Has a Name is an emotional play, there are lighter moments where audience members can laugh. Similarly, Lana Michelin of the Red Deer Advocate asserted that the play's sporadic humorous points maintain the audience's engagement with <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>so</b> they do not become numb to the play's emotional pulls. Kooman stated {{that he tried to}} write the play {{in a way that would}} shock audiences without disturbing them to the point that they would not recommend it to friends.|$|E

Some of the chapters of <b>the</b> <b>story</b> have been told in extended flashbacks, dreams, and visions. This is the order of <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>so</b> far. There are three large gaps between <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> with adventures {{that have yet to}} be told.|$|R
5|$|The {{story was}} {{conceived}} around a protagonist whose abilities {{can not be}} measured through standardized evaluation; as such, he is mistakenly categorized as a poor performing student or an irregular. This premise served as a basis for the character, Tatsuya Shiba. Satō has two processes for scripting the story arcs: the first is to create scenarios to have characters behave and interact in certain ways; the second is to plan a scene, then script <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>so</b> it leads to that scene. Satō professed that he does not feel his characters are alive or have a will of their own when scripting them.|$|E
5|$|Tintin et les Picaros began {{serialisation}} in both Belgium and France in Tintin-l'Hebdoptmiste {{magazine in}} September 1975. It was then {{published in a}} collected volume by Casterman in 1976. For this publication, a page was removed from <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>so</b> that it would fit the standard 62-page book format. The page in question was located between pages 22 and 23 of the published book, and featured Sponz attempting to smash a glass, but accidentally breaking a statue of Bordurian political leader Kurvi-Tasch instead. A launch party {{was held at the}} Hilton Hotel in Brussels.|$|E
5|$|A major {{difference}} between And Then There Were None and Murder on the Orient Express that Sheldon pointed out {{was that in the}} former, the premise of the novel was that no one solved the murder. This forced Sheldon to desperately {{try to find a way}} to integrate clues into <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>so</b> that the player could actually discover the murderer, although the game remained quite uninteractive. In Murder on the Orient Express, the actual novel follows an investigation, so Sheldon could more easily integrate clues to lead to all three possible solutions. Sheldon also excised unnecessary puzzles from Murder on the Orient Express, as they were an unpopular feature of its predecessor.|$|E

5|$|In {{this stage}} of the myth, Horus is a {{vulnerable}} child beset by dangers. The magical texts that use Horus's childhood as the basis for their healing spells give him different ailments, from scorpion stings to simple stomachaches, adapting the tradition to fit the malady that each spell was intended to treat. Most commonly, the child god has been bitten by a snake, reflecting the Egyptians' fear of snakebite and the resulting poison. Some texts indicate that these hostile creatures are agents of Set. Isis may use her own magical powers to save her child, or she may plead with or threaten deities such as Ra or Geb, so they will cure him. As she is the archetypal mourner in the first portion of <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> <b>so</b> during Horus's childhood she is the ideal devoted mother. Through the magical healing texts, her efforts to heal her son are extended to cure any patient.|$|E

50|$|Producer E. J. Carroll {{bought the}} rights to Rudd's stories for £500. He {{originally}} wanted American director Wilfred Lucas to make the film, but he refused as he felt the subject matter was too intrinsically Australian. Carroll did not have {{the rights to}} Bert Bailey's play adaptation of <b>the</b> <b>stories,</b> <b>so</b> <b>the</b> script comes directly from Steele Rudd's original works. This means it does not feature additions made by the play, such subplots involving murder and a love triangle.|$|R

25|$|The plays The Merchant of Venice and A Midsummer Night's Dream by William Shakespeare both {{influenced}} Breaking Dawn. Meyer {{decided that}} Alice would write her instruction to Bella {{on a page}} from The Merchant of Venice to give a clue that the final confrontation {{at the end of}} the book would be a mental one—not a physical battle—like the one {{at the end of the}} play. It also hints that the novel would have a happy ending for the couples, as in The Merchant of Venice. Originally it was the novel Jane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë that Alice tore a page from, but Jane Eyre had nothing to do with <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> <b>so</b> Meyer changed it.|$|E

The next footage was shown at the Games Convention in August when a {{finished}} version of the opening level was shown. The designers revealed the game opened roughly half-way through <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>so</b> that players would have an action-based level to begin {{in which they could}} control both Lyra/Pan and Iorek, rather than beginning the game in Jordan College with only Lyra available for control. They also explained that the Alethiometer will function in the game primarily as a means for expanding the story and unlocking bonus content rather than being something completely necessary for completing the game.|$|E

The Seven Crystal Balls serialisation finally concluded on 22 April 1948, {{four and a half years}} after it had begun.|$|E

500|$|In {{the years}} since the film's release, Warner Bros. has {{attempted}} to buy back Raucher's ten percent of the film as well as his rights to <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>so</b> it could be remade; Raucher has consistently declined. The 1988 film Stealing Home has numerous similarities to both Summer of '42 and Class of '44, with several incidents (most notably a subplot dealing with the premature death of the protagonist's father and the protagonist's response to it) appearing to have been directly lifted from Raucher's own life; Jennifer O'Neill stated in 2002 she believes [...] "Home" [...] was an attempted remake of [...] "Summer".|$|E
