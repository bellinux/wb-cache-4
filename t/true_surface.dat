50|$|Meanwhile, Gabriel Angelos has tracked Gorgutz's warband {{all the way}} to the Vault, one of {{the many}} passageways to Acheron's <b>true</b> <b>surface</b> below its outer shell. He destroys Wazmakka's cannon that was brought there to break open the vault. The Inquisitor orders the {{bombardment}} of the Vault despite Angelos being in the immediate vicinity of it, in an attempt to destroy it and cut off any access to the Spear. The Imperial orbital bombardment does not have the intended effect of sealing the Vault, but rather, breaks it open. Kyre sees the destruction of The Vault as an opportunity to lead his forces down to the <b>true</b> <b>surface</b> of Acheron. Enraged, Librarian Orion and Chaplain Diomedes swears vengeance on the Inquisitor for (seemingly) killing the Chapter Master and opening the way for Kyre. It is not until Lady Solaria informs them of news of Angelos' survival from Inquisitor Horst that they shift priorities towards regrouping with Angelos on the surface instead.|$|E
5000|$|Platinum {{black is}} widely used as a thin film {{covering}} solid platinum metal, forming platinum electrodes for applications in electrochemistry. The process of covering platinum electrodes with such a layer of platinum black is called [...] "platinization of platinum". The platinized platinum has a <b>true</b> <b>surface</b> area {{much higher than the}} geometrical surface area of the electrode and, therefore, exhibits action superior to that of shiny platinum.|$|E
5000|$|A {{surface state}} is {{described}} by the energy [...] and its wave vector [...] parallel to the surface, while a bulk state is characterized by both [...] and [...] wave numbers. In the two-dimensional Brillouin zone of the surface, for each value of [...] therefore a rod of [...] is extending into the three-dimensional Brillouin zone of the Bulk. Bulk energy bands that are being cut by these rods allow states that penetrate deep into the crystal.One therefore generally distinguishes between <b>true</b> <b>surface</b> states and surface resonances. <b>True</b> <b>surface</b> states are characterized by energy bands that are not degenerate with bulk energy bands. These state are existing in the forbidden energy gap only and are therefore localized at the surface, similar to the picture given in figure 3. At energies where a surface and a bulk state are degenerate, the surface and the bulk state can mix, forming a surface resonance. Such state can propagate deep into the bulk similar to Bloch waves, while retaining an enhanced amplitude close to the surface.|$|E

40|$|Our {{goal is to}} {{accurately}} estimate the error in any prediction of a regression model. We propose a probabilistic regression framework for basis function regression models, which includes widely used kernel methods such as support vector machines and nonlinear ridge regression. The framework outputs a point specific estimate of {{the probability that the}} <b>true</b> regression <b>surface</b> lies between two user specified values, denoted by y 1 and y 2. More formally, given any y 2 > y 1, we estimate the Pr(y 1 f(x)), where y is a <b>true</b> regression <b>surface,</b> x is the input, and f(x) is the basis function model. Thus the framework encompasses the less general standard error bar approach used in regression...|$|R
50|$|The {{eighteen}} {{regions are}} actually platforms above the <b>true</b> <b>surface</b> of Mitral; the excavation probe cannot fly or hover (although it can rise and lower itself slightly on hydraulics), and moving off a platform causes the player to fall {{onto the surface}} and become marooned.

5000|$|Another theory {{associated}} with hypergiant stars {{is the potential}} to form a pseudo-photosphere, that is a spherical optically dense surface that is actually formed by the stellar wind rather than being the <b>true</b> <b>surface</b> of the star. Such a pseudo-photosphere would be significantly cooler than the deeper surface below the outward-moving dense wind. This has been hypothesized {{to account for the}} [...] "missing" [...] intermediate-luminosity LBVs and the presence of yellow hypergiants at approximately the same luminosity and cooler temperatures. The yellow hypergiants are actually the LBVs having formed a pseudo-photosphere and so apparently having a lower temperature.|$|E

Learning of the Spear on Acheron from Macha, Gorgutz wants the [...] "SUPER pointy stikk" [...] all for himself. Ronahn leads Gorgutz straight to Kyre's outposts and Gorgutz kills the Wraithlord Valador, another lieutenant of Kyre. While Kyre is preoccupied fighting Gorgutz's forces, Macha, Jain Zar, and a handful of Striking Scorpions raid Kyre's main base where the Spirit Stone of Farseer Taldeer is kept. Macha's strike group barely escapes with the aid of sympathizers within Kyre's ranks as well as a surprise attack from a detachment of Gorgutz's Orks.|$|E

40|$|Minimax L_ 2 {{risks for}} high-dimensional nonparametric {{regression}} are derived under two sparsity assumptions: (1) the <b>true</b> regression <b>surface</b> is a sparse function that depends only on d=O(n) important predictors among {{a list of}} p predictors, with p=o(n); (2) the <b>true</b> regression <b>surface</b> depends on O(n) predictors but is an additive function where each additive component is sparse but may contain two or more interacting predictors and may have a smoothness level different from other components. For either modeling assumption, a practicable extension of the widely used Bayesian Gaussian process regression method is shown to adaptively attain the optimal minimax rate (up to n terms) asymptotically as both n,p→∞ with p=o(n).

5000|$|Roberts built a {{range of}} machine tools, some to his own design, the first being a gear-cutting machine. For {{accurately}} checking {{the dimensions of the}} gears he adapted the sector, which he developed for sale to other engineers. [...] Roberts adopted rotary cutters, which he had seen used at Maudslays. This is one of the earliest records of a milling cutter used in engineering. In 1816 he made the first reliable wet gas meter. In 1817 he made a lathe able to turn work 6 ft. This had a back gear to give an increased range of speeds, and a sliding saddle to move the tool along the work. The saddle was driven by a screw through gearing which could be disengaged when the end of the cut was reached. Also in 1817 he built a planing machine to allow the machining of flat surfaces. Previous to this flat surfaces were laboriously made by hand with the fitter using hammers and chisels, files and scrapers to get a <b>true</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{very bright}} {{areas on the}} FG {{material}} result from genuine high specimen signal yield and not from erratic charging or other artifacts familiar with plastics in vacuum SEM. High yield of edges, oblique incidence, etc. can {{for the first time}} be studied from the <b>true</b> <b>surfaces</b> without obstruction in ESEM. Mild charging, if present, may produce stable contrast characteristic of material properties and {{can be used as a}} means for studies of the physics of the surfaces. The images presented in this series are reproductions from photographic paper with limited bandwidth, on which attempting to bring up detail in dark areas results in saturating the bright areas and vice versa, whilst a lot more information is usually contained on the negative film. Electronic manipulation of the signal together with modern computer graphics can overcome some old imaging limitations.|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The work described by this thesis is a comparison of pore opening geometry for <b>true</b> <b>surface</b> microfilters. <b>True</b> <b>surface</b> microfilters {{can be thought of}} as very fine sieves, with pore sizes less than 10 microns. All other types of so-called microfiltration membranes do not rely on sieving, but obtain their pore retention rating by particle collection mechanisms similar to depth filters. Particle deposition within such microfilters results in permeate flow rate dechne, for a fixed pressure filtration, or pressure drop rise, for a fixed rate filtration. The <b>true</b> <b>surface</b> microfilter pore geometnes considered were circular and slotted, and microfilters with filtering dimension of less than 10 microns were used. The slotted pore microfilters are not commercially available and had to be made in the laboratory as part of this study. The technique used was to plate nickel onto an existing substrate, thereby reducing the pore dimension until It was within the microfiltration range. The plating was by electroless nickel solution and not by galvanic means. Significant development of the electroless platmg technique led ultimately to the successful manufacture of process scale slotted surface microfilters [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{quality of}} a passiv e film on a {{semiconductor}} is evaluated by its insulation abil ity and durability. In the course of developing passivation techniques, it becomes necessary to investigate various properties of the film and their elation to the film quality. One of the important properties {{of the film is}} its roughness factor R, i. e., the ratio of the <b>true</b> <b>surface</b> area, Atrue, to the macroscopic geometrical area, Ageom. The <b>true</b> <b>surface</b> area is successfully determined by gas adsorp-tion techniques, i. e., the so-called BET method (1).

40|$|The {{structure}} of the spinach thylakoid outer surface has been examined by deepetching, a technique which exposes the <b>true</b> <b>surfaces</b> of biological membranes by sublimination of frozen dilute buffer. The membrane surface is covered with large (150 ~, average diameter) and small (90 ~ average diameter) particles. Approximately 30 % of the large particles can be removed under conditions reported to selectively remove carboxydismutase from the membrane surface. The remaining large particles can be removed only under conditions which cause a loss of coupling factor activity. When purified coupling factor is readded to membranes from which all coupling factor activity has been removed, large particles reappear, indicating that they represent coupling factor molecules. Since the number of particles {{and the amount of}} ATPase activity in the reconstituted and control membranes were the same, coupling factor molecules may be attached to specific binding sites.
