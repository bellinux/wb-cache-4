25|$|Skeptical researchers, such as Ernest Taves and Barry Singer, {{have noted}} how mysteries and the paranormal are very popular and profitable. This {{has led to}} the {{production}} of vast amounts of material on topics such as the Bermuda Triangle. They were able to show that some of the pro-paranormal material is often misleading or inaccurate, but its producers continue to market it. Accordingly, they have claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>is</b> biased in favor of books, TV specials, and other media that support the Triangle mystery, and against well-researched material if it espouses a skeptical viewpoint.|$|E

If only we had got it right and let the market play God instead.Based on the premise <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>is</b> the solution to all the problems of the human race, it is, too, a very religious fundamentalism.

25|$|Yield curves {{are usually}} upward sloping asymptotically: {{the longer the}} maturity, the higher the yield, with {{diminishing}} marginal increases (that is, as one moves to the right, the curve flattens out). There are two common explanations for upward sloping yield curves. First, it may be <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>is</b> anticipating {{a rise in the}} risk-free rate. If investors hold off investing now, they may receive a better rate in the future. Therefore, under the arbitrage pricing theory, investors who are willing to lock their money in now need to be compensated for the anticipated rise in rates—thus the higher interest rate on long-term investments.|$|E

The first FD-OCT imaging study was reported by the laboratory of Prof. Guillermo James Tearney and Prof. Brett Bouma based at Massachusetts General Hospital in 2008. Intravascular FD-OCT was first introduced in the market in 2009 by LightLab Imaging, Inc. and Terumo Corporation launched a second solution for coronary artery imaging in 2012. The higher imaging speed of FD-OCT enabled the widespread adoption of this imaging technology for coronary artery imaging. It is estimated that >100,000 FD-OCT coronary imaging cases are performed yearly, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>is</b> increasing by approximately 20% every year.|$|E
2500|$|Critics have {{blamed the}} belief in {{rational}} markets {{for much of the}} late-2000s financial crisis. [...] In response, proponents of the hypothesis have stated that market efficiency does not mean not having any uncertainty about the future, that market efficiency is a simplification of the world which may not always hold true, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>is</b> practically efficient for investment purposes for most individuals.|$|E

2500|$|During April 1980, a {{group of}} Dominican industralists began {{to meet with the}} {{intention}} of formalizing a stock market and creating a regulating body guarded by the transparency and the efficiency of the operations in this market. This group consisted of Ricardo Valdéz Albízu, Hector Rizek, Ramón Mena, Winston Marrero, Otto Montero, Frederic Eman-Zadé, Luis Sabater and Rosendo Alvarez III. During 1987 this original group contacted Robert Bishop, the former vice-president of the New York Stock Exchange, to assist with the markets creation. The Dominican Republics first stock exchange finally came into legal existence under Presidential Decree No. 554-89 that was passed on February 20, 1989, but actually did not begin formal operations until December 1991. [...] It was originally known as the Bolsa de Valores de Santo Domingo Inc. In 1997, {{as a result of the}} fact that its activities extended into other cities of the country, it changed its name to Bolsa de Valores de la República Dominicana. This means <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>is</b> still relatively new, and the concept of both an equity and capital market is just coming into consciousness.

I am greatly afraid that the inquiry will raise some alarm, as a measure leading to the French system of putting corn into requisition. For that was preceded by an inquisition somewhat similar in its principle, though, according to their mode, their principles are full of that violence which here is not much to be feared. It goes on a principle directly opposite to mine: it presumes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>is</b> no fair test of plenty or scarcity.
