5|$|Bubble lights, {{a type of}} {{incandescent}} novelty light, {{were invented}} by Carl Otis in 1935, who then sold the patents to the NOMA (National Outfit Manufacturer's Association) Electric Corporation. NOMA launched the novelty lights on the Christmas market in 1946 when war shortages ended. Bubble lights became hugely popular. Their main feature was a sealed glass <b>tube</b> <b>with</b> a colored bubbling liquid inside.|$|E
5|$|The {{clarinet}} is a musical-instrument family {{belonging to}} the group known as the woodwind instruments. It has a single-reed mouthpiece, a straight cylindrical <b>tube</b> <b>with</b> an almost cylindrical bore, and a flared bell. A person who plays a clarinet is called a clarinetist (sometimes spelled clarinettist).|$|E
30|$|With the single-corner {{capillary}} models, the normalized threshold {{radius of}} the <b>tubes</b> <b>with</b> complex polygonal cross sections can be calculated by the superposition method. In the next two sections, the <b>tubes</b> <b>with</b> equilateral polygonal cross sections, with corners that can be superposed independently, and more complex <b>tube</b> shapes, <b>with</b> interactional corners, are modeled and discussed in detail.|$|R
30|$|In these tubes, {{when two}} {{immiscible}} fluids flow with {{the form of}} piston-like flow, the curvatures of the interfaces are controlled by the capillary pressure; the distributions of the fluids denote their saturations, which have a significant influence on the flow behaviors. Theoretical analysis of the fluid distributions (Jia et al. 2007) indicates that triangular capillary <b>tubes</b> <b>with</b> the same shape factor have slightly different wetting phase saturation profiles. When the contact angle is < 50 °, the saturations of each fluid in different triangular <b>tubes</b> <b>with</b> the same shape factor are similar, but {{the difference in the}} saturations increases slightly with increasing contact angle, after exceeding 50 °. <b>Tubes</b> <b>with</b> shape factors between 0.07958 and 0.06250 are more complicated than triangular tubes, and the saturation profiles of the fluids in irregular <b>tubes</b> <b>with</b> the same shape factor are unknown. Accordingly, it is necessary to study the saturation profiles in <b>tubes</b> <b>with</b> complicated cross sections, and the saturation analysis between the <b>tube</b> bundles <b>with</b> the same shape factor is also a focal point in this research.|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to design {{requirements of the}} National Transonic Facility, aerodynamic tests were conducted to determine the pressure-drop, flow-uniformity, and turbulence characteristics of various heat-exchanger configurations {{as a function of}} Reynolds number. Data were obtained in air with an indraft flow apparatus operated at ambient temperature and pressure. The unit Reynolds number of the tests varied from about 0. 06 x 10 to 6 th power to about 1. 3 x 10 to 6 th power per meter. The test models were designed to represent segments of full-scale tube bundles and included bundles of round <b>tubes</b> <b>with</b> plate fins in both staggered and inline tube arrays, round <b>tubes</b> <b>with</b> spiral fins, elliptical <b>tubes</b> <b>with</b> plate fins, and an inline grouping of <b>tubes</b> <b>with</b> segmented fins...|$|R
5|$|The {{plants are}} {{sometimes}} grown as ornamentals. Dead stems decay {{to leave a}} hollow wooden <b>tube</b> <b>with</b> a pattern of lengthwise slits. These are sometimes used as canes or to make curios. The Roman Catholic Penitentes of New Mexico formerly tied fresh stems to their bare backs in Holy Week processions. The Zuni people use the imbricata variety ceremonially.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} {{commonly}} used configurations of manifold. The oldest type is a <b>tube</b> <b>with</b> a connector on each end which {{is attached to}} the cylinder valve outlet, and an outlet connection in the middle, to which the regulator is attached. A variation on this pattern includes a reserve valve at the outlet connector. The cylinders are isolated from the manifold when closed, and the manifold can be attached or disconnected while the cylinders are pressurised.|$|E
5|$|Millipedes breathe {{through two}} pairs of spiracles located ventrally on each segment near {{the base of the}} legs. Each opens into an {{internal}} pouch, and connects to a system of tracheae. The heart runs {{the entire length of the}} body, with an aorta stretching into the head. The excretory organs are {{two pairs of}} malpighian tubules, located near the mid-part of the gut. The digestive tract is a simple <b>tube</b> <b>with</b> two pairs of salivary glands to help digest the food.|$|E
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{models for}} the prediction of failure pressures and leak rates under normal operation and design-basis accident conditions in steam generator <b>tubes</b> <b>with</b> axial and circumferential cracks. These models were first validated through failure and leak rate tests at room temperature and at 282 C on <b>tubes</b> <b>with</b> rectangular, triangular, and trapezoidal notches fabricated by electrodischarge machining. They were then compared with failure and leak rate tests conducted on <b>tubes</b> <b>with</b> laboratory-generated outer-diameter stress corrosion cracks and steam generator <b>tubes</b> <b>with</b> field-induced stress corrosion cracks, which have highly complex morphology. Complex crack profiles are addressed using a model based {{on the concept of}} equivalent rectangular cracks. The predictions of the models are in reasonable agreement with test results, the time-dependent initiation and increase of leak rates observed in some tests cannot be predicted by the model...|$|R

The walls of the signal tower were 8inches thick while it had a roof of 3inches of KNC armour. 2inch torpedo bulkheads were fitted abreast the magazines and shell rooms of 'A', 'X' and 'Y' turrets, but this increased to 4inches abreast 'P' and 'Q' turrets to compensate for their outboard location.|$|E
5|$|Triceratops has an {{extended}} cameo, being sick with an unidentified disease. Its appearance {{was a particular}} logistical nightmare for Stan Winston when Spielberg asked to shoot the animatronic of the sick creature earlier than expected. The model, operated by eight puppeteers in the Kaua'i set, wound up being the first dinosaur filmed during production. Winston also created a baby Triceratops for Ariana Richards to ride on, a scene cut from the film for pacing reasons. Gary Rydstrom combined the sound of himself breathing into a cardboard <b>tube</b> <b>with</b> the cows near his workplace at Skywalker Ranch to create the Triceratops vocals.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the third week of development, the embryonic ectoderm forms a thickened strip called the neural plate. By the fourth week of development the neural plate has widened to give a broad cephalic end, a less broad middle part and a narrow caudal end. These swellings represent {{the beginning}}s of the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain. Neural crest cells (derived from the ectoderm) populate the lateral edges of the plate at the neural folds. In the fourth week in the neurulation stage the neural plate folds and closes to form the neural tube, bringing together the neural crest cells at the neural crest. The neural crest runs the length of the <b>tube</b> <b>with</b> cranial neural crest cells at the cephalic end and caudal neural crest cells at the tail. Cells detach from the crest and migrate in a craniocaudal (head to tail) wave inside the tube. Cells at the cephalic end give rise to the brain, and cells at the caudal end give rise to the spinal cord.|$|E

5|$|Franklin's machine used a {{belt and}} pulley system that could be {{operated}} by one person turning a crank. A large pulley {{was attached to the}} crank-handle, and a much smaller pulley was attached to a large glass globe. An iron axle passed through the globe. This allowed the globe to be rotated at high speed. When the crank was turned, the glass globe rubbed against a leather pad, which generated a large static charge, similar to the electrical charge that could be created by rubbing a glass <b>tube</b> <b>with</b> wool cloth by hand. The machine was unique improvement over others made in Europe at the time, as the glass globe could be spun faster with much less labor. A few revolutions of the handle was all that was needed to charge a Leyden jar.|$|E
5|$|No single {{method for}} {{confirming}} tracheal tube placement {{has been shown}} to be 100% reliable. Accordingly, the use of multiple methods for confirmation of correct tube placement is now widely considered to be the standard of care. Such methods include direct visualization as the tip of the tube passes through the glottis, or indirect visualization of the tracheal tube within the trachea using a device such as a bronchoscope. With a properly positioned tracheal tube, equal bilateral breath sounds will be heard upon listening to the chest with a stethoscope, and no sound upon listening to the area over the stomach. Equal bilateral rise and fall of the chest wall will be evident with ventilatory excursions. A small amount of water vapor will also be evident within the lumen of the <b>tube</b> <b>with</b> each exhalation and there will be no gastric contents in the tracheal tube at any time.|$|E
5|$|Pale Blue Dot, {{which was}} {{taken with the}} narrow-angle camera, was also {{published}} {{as part of a}} composite picture created from a wide-angle camera photograph showing the Sun and the region of space containing the Earth and Venus. The wide-angle image was inset with two narrow-angle pictures: Pale Blue Dot and a similar photograph of Venus. The wide-angle photograph was taken with the darkest filter (a methane absorption band) and the shortest possible exposure (5 milliseconds), to avoid saturating the camera's vidicon <b>tube</b> <b>with</b> scattered sunlight. Even so, the result was a bright burned-out image with multiple reflections from the optics in the camera and the Sun that appears far larger than the actual dimension of the solar disk. The rays around the Sun are a diffraction pattern of the calibration lamp which is mounted in front of the wide-angle lens.|$|E
