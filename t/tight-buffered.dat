5000|$|A {{fiber pigtail}} is a single, short, usually <b>tight-buffered,</b> optical fiber {{that has an}} optical {{connector}} pre-installed on one end and a length of exposed fiber at the other end.|$|E
50|$|A fanout kit {{is a set}} {{of empty}} jackets {{designed}} to protect fragile <b>tight-buffered</b> strands of fiber from a cable. This allows the individual fibers to be terminated without splicing, and without needing a protective enclosure such as a splicebox. This is normally an option with fiber distribution cable, or sometimes loose-buffer or ribbon cable, because these types of cable contain multiple strands that are designed for a permanent termination.The ribbon fanout pigtails include: Ribbon cable, Fanout kit, Fanout tubing and Connectors.|$|E
50|$|Breakout-style fiberoptic cable (also called {{breakout}} cable or fanout cable), is an {{optical fiber cable}} containing several jacketed simplex optical fibers packaged together inside an outer jacket. This differs from distribution-style cable, in which <b>tight-buffered</b> fibers are bundled together, with only the outer cable jacket of the cable protecting them. The design of breakout-style cable adds strength for ruggedized drops, however the cable is larger and more expensive than distribution-style cable. Breakout cable is suitable for short riser and plenum applications and also for use in conduits, where a very simple cable run is planned to avoid {{the use of any}} splicebox or spliced fiber pigtails.|$|E
50|$|The strain margin {{requirements}} tend to favour cable designs using multiple loose tubes. <b>Tight-buffer</b> cable designs {{do not provide}} sufficient strain margin and the optical fibre transmission performance is compromised under strong winds, heavy ice accretions and at high temperatures. In cables based on a single loose tube design, the optical fibres have too much freedom of movement along the cable axis. Consequently, mechanical {{energy in the form}} of wind-induced vibration of the host conductor causes the optical fibres to move gradually ‘downhill’ and allowing the excess fibre length to collect in the low point of the span. This uneven distribution of excess fibre length compromises the optical performance of the cable with increased optical attenuation at low temperatures in the relatively crowded sections of tube in the middle of spans and at high temperatures where the fibres are under strain at the high sections close to the towers. These problems are worse on longer spans.|$|R
5000|$|A {{patch cord}} is always fitted with {{connectors}} at both ends. A pigtail {{is similar to}} a patch cord and is the informal name given to a cable fitted with a connector at one end and bare wires (or bare fibre) at the other. In the context of copper cabling, these cables are sometimes referred to as blunt patch cords and the non-connectorized end ("the pigtail") is intended to be permanently attached to a component or terminal. Optical fiber pigtails, in contrast to copper pigtails, can be more accurately described as a connector than a cable or cord. A fiber pigtail is a single, short, usually <b>tight-buffered,</b> optical fiber that has an optical connector pre-installed on one end and a length of exposed fiber at the other end. The end of the fiber pigtail is stripped and fusion spliced to a single fiber of a multi-fiber trunk. Splicing of pigtails to each fiber in the trunk [...] "breaks out" [...] the multi-fiber cable into its component fibers for connection to the end equipment.|$|E
40|$|Fiber jacket has a {{function}} of protecting fibers from harsh environment; it also {{has an impact on}} the measured strain accuracy. In this paper, we report on our study of jacket effect to distributed Brillouin sensor system on strain measurement accuracy for constant load stretching and constant length stretching using the 900 m m <b>tight-buffered</b> fiber (Type-A) and the 250 m m optical fiber (Type-B). We have studied the time-varying performance under the stretching of constant load and length. It was found that, within 48 hours under constant load stretching, the strain value of the Type-A measured by BOTDR (Brillouin optical time-domain reflectometer) increased with time, while the Type-B it kept stable. Within 48 hours under constant length stretching, the strain value of the Type-A decreased with time, while the Type-B it kept stable. After relaxation, the strain value of the Type-B reached zero within 1 hour, while the Type-A declined gradually. We found the creep deformation and stress relaxation of jacket to be the leading cause to this phenomena...|$|E
40|$|Constructing tunnels {{in highly}} {{congested}} urban cities is a challenge, as the construction will inevitably {{take place in}} close proximity to existing structures both above and below ground. As more tunnels are being constructed, it is inevitable that some tunnels will be constructed {{in close proximity to}} existing tunnels and monitoring of the existing tunnels in this case is paramount for the design and construction works. The discrete nature of conventional monitoring instrumentation requires significant interpolation and judgement {{in order to understand the}} overall behaviour of the tunnel itself. Subsequently, conservative design approaches will have to be adopted to cater for the gaps in knowledge, which could lead to unnecessary delays and high costs. Distributed fibre optic strain sensing systems based on Brillouin Optical Time Domain Reflectometry (BOTDR) could offer an alternative; in this paper a case study is presented where fibre optic cables were deployed to monitor the response of the cast iron Royal Mail tunnel in the vicinity of London Liverpool Street Station during the construction of Crossrail’s new platform tunnel directly below it. Single mode single core <b>tight-buffered</b> cables were attached directly to the intrados of the cast iron tunnel lining of the Royal Mail tunnel to understand its response during the construction works. This paper focuses on the challenges and considerations in deploying the fibre optic system in the tunnel and presents some of the data, which demonstrates the potential benefit of using such a system in real, complex tunnelling scenarios...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{advancement}} in distributed fiber-optic sensing offers new possibilities for performance monitoring {{in the field}} of geotechnical and civil engineering. Brillouin optical time-domain reflectometry (BOTDR) is a commercially available technology that allows distributed strain measurements in the microstrain range along the full length of an optical fiber. By integrating a single fiber-optic cable into soil or a structure, an unprecedented amount of reasonably accurate (± 30 με), spatially resolved data could be obtained. Since the BOTDR data is influenced by both strain and temperature, it is important that methods to separate the two effects are fully understood. This paper describes the BOTDR temperature compensation method by implementing appropriate thermal expansion coefficients of optical cables and structures to the raw data. In the laboratory study, validation of the instrumentation technique was conducted in a concrete beam by embedding two types of optical cables consisting of <b>tight-buffered</b> and loose-tubed coatings to measure thermal strains response during concrete curing. Temperature readings inferred from optical fibers were found to be in accordance to the thermocouples. A field study of axially loaded concrete pile subjected to cooling and heating cycle is presented. Measurements in the test pile and adjacent borehole indicate similar strain profiles and temperature changes between BOTDR and conventional instrumentation such as vibrating wire strain gauges and thermistors. General steps to derive the temperature compensated strain profiles observed in the thermal pile as a result of cooling and heating is presented. The data enables load-transfer profiles to be interpreted and used as framework to understand pile response to temperature changes...|$|E
