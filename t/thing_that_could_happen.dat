25|$|The {{departure}} in 1979 of animators Don Bluth, Gary Goldman and John Pomeroy, {{along with}} a further four animators and four assistant animators from Disney's feature animation studio, caused a considerable disturbance in the animation industry. The 11 animators who left represented about 17% of the studio's animation staff, a loss that delayed the release of The Fox and the Hound by six months. Ron W. Miller, the president and CEO of The Walt Disney Company at the time, remarked that although the timing of their departure was unfortunate, it was “possibly the best <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>happen</b> to our animation group”. Bluth expressed concerns that as Disney's productions became more technically advanced, the story seemed to lose importance. The aim of his new studio was to “return animation to its glorious past”, concentrating on strong stories, and using traditional animation techniques that {{had fallen out of}} favour at Disney. Animation historian Jerry Beck observed that Don Bluth Productions was clearly set up in direct opposition to Disney; even Aurora Productions, who backed the studio's first feature, The Secret of NIMH, was made up of former Disney executives.|$|E

[...] Some saw his entrance in the race {{as an attempt to}} split the African American vote. However, O'Malley received endorsements from prominent African American politicians in August, including Rawlings, fellow state Delegate Kenneth Montague, and Conway. Rawlings credited O'Malley's [...] "track record of empowering black Americans." [...] He also received an endorsement from Schaefer. Some African Americans charged Rawlings with [...] "stabbing us in the back" [...] over the endorsement.|$|E
500|$|Edward's {{supporters}} {{felt that}} he had [...] "been hounded from the throne by that arch humbug Baldwin", but many members of the establishment were relieved by Edward's departure. Mackenzie King wrote in his diary on 8 December 1936 that Edward's [...] "sense of right or wrong has been largely obliterated by the jazz of life he has led for years" [...] and, upon receiving news of Edward's final decision to abdicate, [...] "if {{that is the kind of}} man he is it is better he should not be longer on the Throne." [...] Edward's own Assistant Private Secretary, Alan Lascelles, had told Baldwin as early as 1927: [...] "I can't help thinking that the best <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>happen</b> to him, and to the country, would be for him to break his neck." ...|$|E

500|$|Pablo is tall (...) , {{good in the}} air, and as {{a younger}} player was noted for his pace. Albacete {{teammate}} Miquel Buades suggested that those key attributes made him [...] "the worst <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>happen</b> to a forward". His coach at both Albacete and Atlético, César Ferrando, said {{he had all the}} qualities needed for his position, which included anticipation and the intelligence to keep things simple. Again according to Ferrando, Pablo rarely fouled, because [...] "he doesn't need to. He has a whole arsenal of defensive resources." [...] A 2006 World Cup profile suggested he was [...] "much happier on the ball than first impressions may suggest", and could look [...] "ungainly". A scout's assessment of his running style as [...] "ugly" [...] reportedly discouraged Real Madrid from pursuing an early interest in him.|$|E
500|$|When O'Malley {{admits he}} cares for Christine, she finally breaks down and reveals the ugly truth. Her {{husband had been}} {{corrupted}} by the power and adulation he received. He became a fascist, plotting {{to gain control of}} the United States and use his enormous influence to turn Americans to fascist ideals. She shows O'Malley papers stored in the arsenal which reveal how Forrest (backed by secretive, ultra-wealthy, power-hungry individuals) planned to use racism, anti-union feeling, and antisemitism to divide the country, turning one group against another if it became too powerful to control, in order to create the chaos that would let him seize power. Christine discovered the plot the day before her husband's death. She went riding the next morning and came upon the washed-out bridge. She could have warned her husband, but decided that a [...] "clean death in the rain was the best <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>happen</b> to Robert Forrest". O'Malley convinces her to help him write a book detailing Forrest's scheme.|$|E
500|$|That {{arrangement}} did {{not last}} long, and by February 1936, Briskin's role at the studio was changing. While still with the same title, {{he was no longer}} subservient to Kahane, having full control over all RKO production. In February 1936 Briskin was mentioned along with a handful of other producers as being in such demand that they could write their own ticket, the others mentioned included Thalberg, David O. Selznick, Darryl F. Zanuck, Hunt Stromberg, and Sol Wurtzel. By April of that year, Briskin was putting his mark on RKO. He purchased quite a few properties, signed numerous actors, and lured successful producers to the studio, such as Edward Small. Later that year, RKO gained the rights to the successful Irish play, The Plough and the Stars, by playwright Seán O'Casey. This led to Briskin being responsible for bringing Barry Fitzgerald to Hollywood for his American film debut. Fitzgerald was one of four members of the play's original cast at the Abbey Theatre in Dublin, who Briskin signed to appear in the film version of the same name. By the middle of the year, RKO was solidly Briskin's, with the full backing of studio head Leo Spitz, This led to Kahane, who had been with the studio since its inception, resigning in August, several months prior to the expiration of his contract, and heading to a vice-presidency at Columbia. For the upcoming 1936–37 production season, Briskin announced that he intended to have at least three star-caliber performers in each film. In September, Briskin was elected to the AMPAS board of governors, along with several others including Clark Gable, Darryl Zanuck, and Cecil B. DeMille. The following month, Briskin initiated a policy wherein the younger players under contract to RKO could appear in stage productions in stock and little theater companies for short periods, in order for the actors to gain experience. Also in October, Briskin was chosen to succeed Louis B. Mayer as chairman of the motion picture community chest. In 1936 Briskin led RKO to its most productive year up to that date. Before the end of the year, a new medium was being introduced, television. When asked about the threat this new entertainment source might pose to the film industry, Briskin thought that TV would actually help films. He felt that it might be the [...] "... greatest <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>happen</b> to the industry." [...] Rationalizing that [...] "... 10 years ago when radio broadcasting began many feared people would sit at home with earphones and listen to the free radio entertainment. Instead, the movies have had their best years since radio broadcasting came in ..." [...] In December, reports began to surface that he was up for a long term contract at RKO, however, due to an impending reorganization, he was only given a one-year extension, with a promise of a long-term deal once the reorganization was complete. Briskin made the decision to begin color films at RKO. He was also responsible for bringing the Poverty Row producer, Maury M. Cohen, into RKO.|$|E

2500|$|Though pederasty {{was once}} {{accepted}} in many cultures, some modern observers have retrospectively labeled it abusive. Enid Bloch argues that many Greek {{boys who were}} involved in paederastic relationships may have been harmed by the experience, if the relationship included anal sex. Bloch writes that the boy may have been traumatized by knowing that he was violating social customs. According to her, the [...] "most shameful <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>happen</b> to any Greek male was penetration by another male." [...] In this respect Bloch is in accord with Greek sexual morality, which also recognized a difference between ethical pederasty which excluded anal sex and [...] "hubristic" [...] pederasty which was believed to debase the boy as well as the man who penetrated him.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2007, Robin is shot in {{the stomach}} during a hostage {{situation}} at the Metro Court Hotel. Emily Quartermaine (Natalia Livingston), {{with the assistance of}} Carly Corinthos (Laura Wright) and Patrick (via telephone), saves Robin's life. While Robin was in peril, Patrick was a wreck. At the culmination of the hostage crisis, Robin's friend, Nikolas Cassadine (Tyler Christopher), carries Robin out of the Metro Court to safety. She undergoes surgery to remove the bullet in her abdomen. At the hospital, Patrick tells her that he thought the worst <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>happen</b> to him was him testing positive for HIV but he realized that HIV would be a blessing compared to losing her because he loves her [...] "beyond reason". On March 2, 2007, Robin is released from the hospital and brought home to her Uncle Mac's house to recuperate. Patrick's HIV test results came back as an affirmative negative. Both were relieved.|$|E
2500|$|According to Rae Wear, Bjelke-Petersen demanded total {{loyalty of}} the media and was unforgiving and vindictive if {{reporting}} was not to his satisfaction. In 1984, he reacted to a series of critical articles in the Courier-Mail by switching the government's million-dollar classified advertising account to the rival Daily Sun. He banned a Courier-Mail reporter who was critical of his excessive use of the government aircraft and Wear claims other journalists who wrote critical articles became the subject of rumour-mongering, were harassed by traffic police, or found that [...] "leaks" [...] from the government dried up. Journalists covering industrial disputes and picketing were also afraid of arrest. In 1985, the Australian Journalists Association withdrew from the system of police passes because of police refusal to accredit certain journalists. Journalists, editors and producers were also deterred from critical stories by Bjelke-Petersen's increasing use of defamation actions {{in order to try to}} [...] "stop talk about a corrupt government". Queensland historian Ross Fitzgerald was threatened with criminal libel in 1984 when he sought to publish a critical history of the state. The premier and his ministers launched 24 defamation actions against the Opposition leader and Labor Party and trade union figures, with 14 of them publicly funded. He saw no role for the media in making government accountable, telling the Australian Financial Review in 1986: [...] "The greatest <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>happen</b> to the state and the nation is when we get rid {{of the media}}. Then we would live in peace and tranquillity and no one would know anything." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite the Big 8's {{official}} {{ruling on}} the matter, the reactions from many {{on all sides}} were not {{in agreement with the}} Big 8 committee in the end. When asked at the Look All-America gathering in New York City Missouri All-American, Danny LaRose said, [...] "It'll always be a 9–1 season as far as I'm concerned. And I think the other players will feel that way, too." [...] However, LaRose also expressed his admiration of the Big Eight [...] "for standing up for what was right – enforcing its own rules". Also at the gathering, Colorado All-American guard Joe Romig echoed similar feelings when he said, [...] "I don't care what the NCAA or the Big Eight does. We lost the game at Kansas. Nothing will change that." [...] Meanwhile, Kansas All-American quarterback John Hadl expressed more concern about his teammate when asked at the All-America gathering and had this to say, [...] "He's a good guy. I hope it doesn't hit him too hard." [...] Missouri head coach Dan Devine expressed his apparent disappointment in the process adopted by the Big 8 when he said, [...] "This is the worst <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>happen</b> in inter-collegiate athletics. I mean {{the fact that they were}} playing a boy not knowing he was ineligible. That should have been determined before he played." [...] For his part then executive secretary of the Big 8, Reaves Peters, said the case was the [...] "toughest case to come before us in history".|$|E
2500|$|In 1893, after {{receiving}} a letter from Cosima Wagner telling {{him that he had}} to read Gobineau's Essai sur l'inégalité des races humaines, Chamberlain, who was fluent in French, duly complied with her request. Chamberlain accepted Gobineau's belief in an Aryan master-race, but rejected his pessimism, writing that Gobineau's philosophy was [...] "the grave of every attempt to deal practically with the race question and left only one honorable solution, that we at once put a bullet through our heads". Chamberlain's time in Vienna shaped his anti-Semitism and Pan-Germanism. Despite living in Vienna from 1889 to 1909 when he moved to Bayreuth, Chamberlain had nothing but contempt for the multi-ethnic, multi-religious Habsburg empire, taking the viewpoint that the best <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>happen</b> to the Austrian empire would be for it to be annexed by Germany to end the Völkerchaos (chaos of the peoples). Vienna had a large Jewish population (until 1938, Vienna was about [...] 10% Jewish), and Chamberlain's time in Vienna marked the only time in his life when he actually encountered Jews. Chamberlain's letters from Vienna constantly complain about how he was having to meet and deal with Jews, every one of whom he detested. In 1894 after visiting a spa, Chamberlain wrote: [...] "Unfortunately like everything else...it has fallen {{into the hands of the}} Jews, which includes two consequences: every individual is bled to the utmost and systematically, and there is neither order nor cleanliness". In 1895, he wrote: However, we shall have to move soon anyway, for our house having been sold to a Jew...it will soon be impossible for decent people to live in it...Already the house being almost quite full of Jews, we have to live in a state of continual warfare with the vermin which is a constant and invariable follower of this chosen people even in the most well-to-do classes. In another letter of 1895, Chamberlain wrote he was still influenced by French anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's critique of the Jews as mindlessly materialistic, writing that Proudhon was [...] "one of the most acute minds of the century" [...] and [...] "I find many points of contact between the Wagner-Schiller mode of thought and the anarchism of Proudhon." [...] At the same time, Chamberlain's marriage to Anna began to fall apart as his wife was frequently sick and though she assisted her husband with his writings, he did not find her very intellectually stimulating. Chamberlain started to complain more and more that his wife's frequent illnesses forced him to tend to her and were holding back his career.|$|E
