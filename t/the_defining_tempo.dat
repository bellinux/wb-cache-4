2500|$|Italian {{instrumental}} music was studied and emulated all over Europe. [...] The sonata, concerto, sinfonia, oratorio and other musical forms all originated in Italy. [...] Italian terminology <b>defining</b> <b>the</b> <b>tempo</b> and mood {{of a musical}} passage was universally adopted in Western music. [...] The music of Italian composers, such as Corelli, Scarlatti, and Vivaldi, was studied or transcribed by many other composers of the day, most notably Bach. [...] In addition, many composers, such as Handel, Gluck and Mozart studied or worked in Italy, and subsequently became famous for their {{instrumental music}} and operas.|$|R

For problem gamblers, financial concerns may often be among the first recognized signs of the problem, and many of the troubles brought with problem gambling are financial. Nonetheless, the financial well-being in the everyday life of problem gamblers is not yet widely studied, even though a lot is known about the processes inside the mind of a problem gambler. What kinds of practices, meanings and experiences related to money and financial issues problem gamblers have in their everyday life? Analyzing thematic, qualitative interviews with problem gamblers it is discussed how problem gamblers use money as a medium to exercise control over their gambling: gambling is not merely chaotic, but disposable incomes <b>define</b> <b>the</b> <b>tempo</b> and intensity of gambling. Problem gambling is often about winning back the lost money, but what happens in problem gambler’s life when enabling to chase losses? Furthermore, it is studied how problem gamblers recover financially. Variety of treatment options are available for problem gamblers, but what kinds of survival techniques they have from financial problems? Specific attention is paid on how welfare structures and financial assistance support problem gamblers in the recovery. The results have implications in designing the financial support mechanisms for problem gamblers...|$|R
40|$|Meter {{is known}} to play a {{paramount}} role in the aesthetic appreciation of music, yet computational modelling remains deficient compared to other dimensions of music analysis. Classical audio-based methods detect the temporal repartition of notes, leading to an onset detection curve that is further analysed, in a second step, for periodicity estimation. Current {{state of the art}} in onset detection, based on energy and spectral flux, cannot handle complex but common musical configurations such as dense orchestral textures. Our proposed im-provement of the flux method can detect new notes while ignoring spectral fluctuation produced by vibrato. Concerning periodicity estimation, we demonstrate the limitation of immediately restricting the range of tempi and of filtering out harmonics of periodicities. We show on the contrary how a complete tracking of a broad set of metrical levels offers {{a detailed description of the}} hierarchical metrical structure. One metrical level is selected as referential level <b>defining</b> <b>the</b> <b>tempo</b> and its evolution throughout the piece, by comparing the temporal integration of the autocorrelation score for each level. Tempo change is expressed independent-ly from the choice of a metrical level by computing the difference between successive frames of tempo ex-pressed in logarithmic scale. A new notion of dynamic metrical centroid is introduced in order to show how particular metrical levels dominate at particular moments of the music. Similarly, dynamic metrical strength is defined as a summation of beat strength estimated on dominant metrical levels. The model is illustrated and discussed through the analysis of classical music excerpts...|$|R
5000|$|The work's title {{suggests}} {{an impression of}} overwhelming radiance [...] The central idea of the composition is the simultaneous layering of five different tempos. These are chosen in various combinations from a scale of seven metronomic tempos: 30, 40, 53.5, 71, 95, 134, and 180 per minute. The selection of tempos can focus on the faster or slower tempos, or combinations emphasizing the strongest oppositions. Many of the notated durations are longer than the vibraphone can sustain. For this reason, the sounds in the recording are lengthened electronically and amplitude modulated to supply an internal pulsation that <b>defines</b> <b>the</b> <b>tempo</b> for each layer [...] The pitches are drawn from the five melodic lines of the form scheme for Hoch-Zeiten for choir. This form scheme in turn consists of the final (Sunday) segment of the three-layered Licht superformula, with a superimposed faster version of the entire superformula compressed to the same length (only with the Lucifer layer left out). Each of these five lines is partitioned according to its changes of pitch into seven segments. Because the pitches in the different lines do not always change at the same time, the segmentation is different in each layer, and the composite changes produce a series of slow chord changes with fourteen phases. These fourteen phases also determine the tempo changes in each layer. For example, the five layers at the beginning (from high to low) are in tempos 30, 40, 95, 71, and 53.5. At {{the second of the}} fourteen sections, only the second layer changes, from 40 to 134, while the other four layers continue at their previous speeds and pitches. At the third chord, the upper four parts all change immediately, while the lowest layer begins a slow accelerando, and so on. An extra section, corresponding to the final fermata of the superformula, is added at the end. This is a quotation of the Sunday Song from the Sieben Lieder der Tage (Seven Songs of the Days), from Evas Lied, act 2, scene 4 of Montag aus Licht. Two inserts and a short introduction are also added. Each of the five layers is then composed out into two heterophonic parts, bringing the total number of parts to ten [...]|$|R

5000|$|In all of Moran's works, {{one finds}} these edited events have been finessed {{in order that}} the peculiarities of their {{internal}} rhythms align to an underlying tempo. In other words (to revert to {{the example of a}} chair), if the character sits and then stands, not only does the score express the nature of the character's actions and the setting, but also that the event itself be constructed as a work of music (i.e., the nuances of the event's details are on a shared tempo).

The separate elements of the events are heard to be [...] "tuned" [...] (or subtly pitched) in order to create harmonic relationships together, again emphasized in part by the work's underscoring. In these works, all events are presented as music and choreography.|$|R
