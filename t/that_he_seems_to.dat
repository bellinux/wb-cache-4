Meanwhile, Ensign Sato and Doctor Phlox are {{attacked}} in San Francisco, and Phlox is kidnapped. Captain Archer and Lieutenant Reed investigate the scene, and Reed is given a secret assignment by a secretive agent <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> know. Commander T'Pol, seeking information from Sato, conducts her first mind-meld, and the two realize that the attackers spoke Rigelian. They discover that a Rigelian freighter recently left orbit and head off in pursuit.|$|E

25|$|Hence Halbertsma {{expected}} to be appointed professor of Dutch language and literature, and several times such an appointment seemed almost within his grasp, but each time it slipped away. His sharp pen probably {{played a role in}} this, but there were other reasons, too. In 1830, he lost out from the surplus of applicants washing over the Netherlands from the universities of Belgium, which at that time had just seceded from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, and after 1840 a different type of scientist was called for, with a more specialised knowledge than Halbertsma commanded. That in 1837 he was awarded an honorary doctorate in literature by the University of Leiden, was scant consolation to him. In part because of these disappointments, Halbertsma balanced {{on the edge of a}} burn-out for a long time, and especially in 1839, when he was passed over yet again, he went through a deep crisis. It was only in the 1860s, when he was in his seventies, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have achieved a state of mental composure.|$|E

Although this characterization of Licinius as anti-Christian is somewhat doubtful, {{the fact is}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have been far less open in his support of Christianity than Constantine. Therefore, Licinius was prone to see the Church as a force more loyal to Constantine than to the Imperial system in general, as the explanation offered by the Church historian Sozomen.|$|E
500|$|One {{commentator}} {{has said}} that Wilfrid [...] "came into conflict with almost every prominent secular and ecclesiastical figure of the age". Hindley, a historian of the Anglo-Saxons, states that [...] "Wilfrid would not win his sainthood through the Christian virtue of humility". The historian Barbara Yorke said of him that [...] "Wilfrid's character was such <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> {{have been able to}} attract and infuriate in equal measure". His contemporary, Bede, although a partisan of the Roman dating of Easter, was a monk and always treats Wilfrid a little uneasily, showing some concern about how Wilfrid conducted himself as a clergyman and as a bishop. The historian Eric John feels that it was Wilfrid's devotion to monasticism that led him to believe that the only way for the Church to be improved was through monasticism. John traces Wilfrid's many appeals to Rome to his motivation to hold together his monastic empire, rather than to self-interest. John also challenges the belief that Wilfrid was fond of pomp, pointing out that the comparison between the Irish missionaries who walked and Wilfrid who rode ignores the reality that the quickest method of travel in the Middle Ages was on horseback.|$|E

2500|$|It was in New York City <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have {{developed}} {{his theory of}} music education, which he used in later years teaching in New England schools. [...] Ide had his young students take part in musical activities before getting much training in theory. [...] In imitation of the ancient Greeks, he emphasized three things in music training: [...] rhapsodizing (improvising or composing on the spot), sight-reading, {{and the ability to}} accompany (especially requiring a sense of harmony). [...] His approach also included the idea of “total theater,” which centers on creative and educational audience participation. [...] He also made use of ethnic and folk melodies in his theory training, especially as an aid to student composition. [...] Together, these ideas formed the foundation of his music teaching (and music theater compositional) practices ...|$|E
2500|$|Christopher R. Weingarten of The Village Voice {{wrote that}} Wayne's lyrics [...] "still walk some {{fascinating}} line between signifying unmistakable genius, curious savant, or total dick", but viewed the album as lacking substance, stating [...] "Wayne's {{big problem is}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> {{like the idea of}} rock music more than any actual rock music itself". Pitchfork Media's Ryan Dombal called Rebirth [...] "an unlikely, unqualified, and quite unbelievable rock album". Slant Magazine's Jesse Cataldo described it as [...] "a total misperception of what makes a rock record" [...] and found its sound [...] "mostly unrecognizable, a twisted amalgam of tacky set pieces collected from throughout the genre's history". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian stated, [...] "Given that everyone knows Carter can do so much better than this, it all smacks a bit of condescension, of locating a different audience, then talking down to them". Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly stated, [...] " [...] Jordan returned to the basketball court after one ill-fated season in the farm leagues; we can only hope for the same for Wayne".|$|E
2500|$|The Qianlong Emperor's massive art {{collection}} became an intimate {{part of his}} life; he took landscape paintings with him on his travels in order to compare them with the actual landscapes, or to hang them in special rooms in palaces where he lodged, to inscribe them on every visit there. [...] "He also regularly added poetic inscriptions to the paintings of the imperial collection, following {{the example of the}} emperors of the Song dynasty and the literati painters of the Ming dynasty. They were a mark of distinction for the work, and a visible sign of his rightful role as emperor. Most particular to the Qianlong Emperor is another type of inscription, revealing a unique practice of dealing with works of art <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have developed for himself. On certain fixed occasions over a long period he contemplated a number of paintings or works of calligraphy which possessed special meaning for him, inscribing each regularly with mostly private notes on the circumstances of enjoying them, using them almost as a diary." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hesiod's {{inclusion}} and praise of Hecate in the Theogony has been troublesome for scholars, in <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> hold her in high regard, while {{the testimony of}} other writers, and surviving evidence, suggests that {{this may have been}} the exception. One theory is that Hesiod's original village had a substantial Hecate following and that his inclusion of her in the Theogony was a way of adding to her prestige by spreading word of her among his readers. [...] Another theory is that Hekate was mainly a household god and humble household worship could have been more pervasive and yet not mentioned as much as temple worship. [...] In Athens Hecate, along with Zeus, Hermes, Hestia, and Apollo, were very important in daily life as they were the main gods of the household. [...] However, {{it is clear that the}} special position given to Hecate by Zeus is upheld throughout her history by depictions found on coins depicting Hecate on the hand of Zeus as highlighted in more recent research presented by d'Este and Rankine.|$|E
2500|$|Film critic Jonathan Romney {{writes that}} the film has been {{interpreted}} in many different ways; as being about the crisis in masculinity, sexism, corporate America, and racism: [...] "It's tempting to read The Shining as an Oedipal struggle not just between generations but between Jack's culture of the written word and Danny's culture of images...." [...] Romney writes, [...] "Jack also uses the written word to more mundane purpose – to sign his 'contract' with the Overlook. 'I gave my word,' [...] which we take to mean 'gave his soul' in the [...] Faustian sense. But maybe he means it more literally – by the end [...] he has renounced language entirely, pursuing Danny through the maze with an inarticulate animal roar. What he has entered into is a conventional business deal that places commercial obligation [...] over the unspoken contract of compassion and empathy <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have neglected to sign with his family." [...] These varied interpretations spawned the 2012 documentary Room 237, directed by Rodney Ascher, which provides an in-depth exploration of various interpretations of, and myths surrounding, the film.|$|E
2500|$|In 1874, Edmé Félix Alfred Vulpian {{coined the}} term {{mouvement}} fibrillaire, a term <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have used to describe both atrial and ventricular fibrillation. John A. MacWilliam, a physiologist who had trained under Ludwig and who subsequently became Professor of Physiology at the University of Aberdeen, gave an accurate description of the arrhythmia in 1887. This definition still holds today, and is interesting {{in the fact that}} his studies and description predate the use of electrocardiography. His description is as follows: [...] "The ventricular muscle is thrown into a state of irregular arrhythmic contraction, whilst there is a great fall in the arterial blood pressure, the ventricles become dilated with blood as the rapid quivering movement of their walls is insufficient to expel their contents; the muscular action partakes of the nature of a rapid incoordinate twitching of the muscular tissue … The cardiac pump is thrown out of gear, and the last of its vital energy is dissipated in the violent and the prolonged turmoil of fruitless activity in the ventricular walls." [...] MacWilliam spent many years working on ventricular fibrillation {{and was one of the}} first to show that ventricular fibrillation could be terminated by a series of induction shocks through the heart.|$|E
