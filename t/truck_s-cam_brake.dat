A jiiction interface contact pressure-dependent {{model for the}} coupling between the lined brake shoe assembly and the brake drum is described. Using this model, natural modes and f i e uencies are predicted which compare well with measured data for the brake assembly.

40|$|The SAE Recommended Practice 51802, Brake Block Effectiveness Rating [I], has {{the purpose}} of {{establishing}} a uniform procedure for determination and classification of brake effectiveness for commercial vehicle brakes. The practice provides a means to characterize the friction properties of truck brake lining materials in a representative <b>S-cam</b> <b>brake.</b> However, the test {{has been found to}} exhibit an unacceptably large range of variability in the implied friction coefficient for the lining. It has been postulated that some of the: variability arises from factors within the brakes that are used for the test-specifically, dimensional tolerances, and possibly friction in the moving parts. A computer model of an S-. cam brake was developed under this work to help examine various brake parameter sensitivi~ties. The model calculates brake torque for a specified set of geometry, friction properties, arid constant input air chamber force. It assumes that the brake {{is in a state of}} equilibrium defined by equalized wear rates on the leading and trailing shoe linings. The parameter!sensitivity findings indicate that a potentially significant source of torque variability is related to possible offsets between the drum turning axis and the spiderlshoe assembly centerline.

50|$|The driven truck axles {{are with}} {{planetary}} reduction, single axle capacity being 10-14 tonnes for steering and 10-20.5 tonnes for non-steering axles; the tandem configurations for the steering axles are rated to 20-28 tonnes and non-steering 20-41 tonnes. The non-steering axles {{are also available}} as tridem configurations with 39-61.5 tonnes. The capacities of steering, non driven axles are between 8 and 12 tonnes. Some non-driven, non-steering axles with a capacity of 13 tonnes {{are also in the}} selection. The non-steering axles are with <b>S-cam</b> drum <b>brakes,</b> whereas some of the steering axles are equipped with disc or wedge brakes.|$|R
50|$|The {{driven axles}} for the {{container}} handling equipment are with planetary reduction. The single non-steering axle capacity is 30-32 tonnes; the tandem applications are rated to 26-41 tonnes. The driven steering axles are with 12-18 tonnes capacity and the non-driven option is only available with 10 tonnes capacity. <b>S-cam</b> and disc <b>brakes</b> are applied on both steering and non-steering axles, the heavier steering driven option being fitted with wedge brakes.|$|R
2500|$|On the A0 {{model the}} front Rockwell steer-drive axle has Hendrickson {{parabolic}} taper leaf springs. The rear tridem unit is sprung by Hendrickson-Turner air suspension. The rearmost axle is a steer-drive unit. All axles are Rockwell SVI 5MR hub-reduction with differential locks. Steering is power-assisted, {{and has an}} auxiliary pump should the main pump fail. Mechanical linkage also provides operator control in event of hydraulic oil pressure loss. [...] Rockwell (now AxleTech) <b>S-cam</b> drum <b>brakes</b> are fitted. A CM Automotive central tire inflation system (CTIS) is fitted, this having four predetermined terrain settings (Highway, Cross-Country, Mud & Snow, Emergency) that enable the operator to adjust tire pressure and lock-up to suit the terrain being crossed. A Run Flat mode checks tire pressures regularly and inflates as needed to compensate for leak(s).|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a mathematical model for an air brake system in the presence of leaks. Brake systems in trucks are crucial for ensuring the safety of vehicles and passengers on the roadways. Most trucks in the US are equipped with <b>S-cam</b> drum <b>brake</b> systems and they are sensitive to maintenance. Brake defects such as leaks are a major cause of accidents involving trucks. Leaks in the air brake systems affect braking performance drastically by decreasing the peak braking pressures attained and also increasing the time required to attain the same, thereby resulting in longer stopping distances. Hence {{there is a need for}} detecting leaks in an air brake system. In this thesis, a mathematical model for an air brake system in the presence of leaks is developed with a view towards developing an automatic leak detection system in the near future. The model developed here builds on an earlier research at Texas A&M University in which a "fault free" model of an air brake system is developed, i. e., a mathematical model of an air brake system that predicts how the pressure in the brake chamber evolves as a function of the brake pedal input when there are no leaks in the air brake system. In order to develop a model for an air brake system in the presence of leaks, one must characterize a "leak". A leak may be characterized by the location and its size. Since the pipes are short, the location of the leak does not significantly affect the evolution in the brake pressure as much as its size. For this reason, "effective area" of the leak was chosen as a characteristic of the leak. It was estimated by fitting an empirical relation for leak with leak flow measurement data. The supply pressure and effective area of leak comprised the inputs to the model along with the displacement of the foot pedal (treadle valve plunger). The model was corroborated with the experimental data collected using the setup at Texas A&M University...|$|R
