5|$|Historians have {{remarked that}} here Darwin {{anticipated}} the modern {{concept of an}} ecological niche. He did not suggest that every favourable variation must be selected, nor that the favoured animals were better or higher, but merely more adapted to <b>their</b> <b>surroundings.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the nineteenth century, the works of Sir Walter Scott were best-sellers in France. His novels {{captured}} {{the ebb and flow of}} society, and he demonstrated the far-reaching impact of major historical changes. A slew of authors in France attempted to replicate Scott's success, but their works were isolated from one another and divorced from <b>their</b> <b>surroundings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Chabas studied under {{artists such}} as Tony Robert-Fleury, William-Adolphe Bouguereau, and Albert Maignan. Although his earlier works were {{generally}} portraits, most of the painter's later production consisted of nude girls and young women. The lakes and rivers of France were common settings for his paintings, which gave prominence to the interaction of light with the models and <b>their</b> <b>surroundings.</b> September Morn is typical of his style.|$|E
5000|$|Whether the {{assimilation}} or contrast effect prevails {{depends on the}} psychological closeness, with people feeling psychologically disconnected with <b>their</b> social <b>surroundings</b> being more likely to show contrast effects. Assimilation effects occur when the subject feels psychologically connected to <b>their</b> social <b>surroundings.</b>|$|R

5|$|Galiella rufa is a {{saprobic}} species, {{and grows}} either solitarily, but more usually in groups or in clusters on decaying hardwood branches and logs. The fungus fruits {{in late summer}} and autumn. The fungus has been noted to fruit readily on logs used for the cultivation of the shiitake mushroom. The fruit bodies are readily overlooked as they blend in with <b>their</b> <b>surroundings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Grasshoppers exemplify a {{range of}} anti-predator adaptations, {{enabling}} them to avoid detection, to escape if detected, {{and in some cases}} to avoid being eaten if captured. Grasshoppers are often camouflaged to avoid detection by predators that hunt by sight; some species can change their coloration to suit <b>their</b> <b>surroundings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Microbes simply secrete {{digestive}} enzymes into <b>their</b> <b>surroundings,</b> while animals only secrete these enzymes from specialized cells in their guts, including {{the stomach and}} pancreas, and salivary glands. The amino acids or sugars released by these extracellular enzymes are then pumped into cells by active transport proteins.|$|E

5|$|Thelephora palmata is an ectomycorrhizal species, forming mutualistic {{associations}} with conifers. Fruit bodies grow singly, scattered, or in {{groups on the}} ground in both coniferous and mixed forest and grassy fields. A preference has been noted for moist ground, and locations along woodland paths. An uncommon species, fruit bodies can be difficult to see because they blend well into <b>their</b> <b>surroundings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Buildings {{lost during}} the 20th century include schools and several chapels serving various Christian denominations. The former St John the Evangelist's Anglican church was {{declared}} redundant {{and sold to}} Brighton's Greek Orthodox community; meanwhile, a distinctive Modernist church {{was built in the}} 1960s for Spiritualists. A cluster of historic early 19th-century houses and other structures survived the redevelopment, and several were awarded listed status by English Heritage. These buildings and <b>their</b> <b>surroundings</b> were afforded further protection in 2008 when the city council designated the Carlton Hill conservation area.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{bacteria}} form close spatial {{associations that}} are essential for their survival. One such mutualistic association, called interspecies hydrogen transfer, occurs between clusters of anaerobic bacteria that consume organic acids, such as butyric acid or propionic acid, and produce hydrogen, and methanogenic Archaea that consume hydrogen. The bacteria in this association are unable to consume the organic acids as this reaction produces hydrogen that accumulates in <b>their</b> <b>surroundings.</b> Only the intimate association with the hydrogen-consuming Archaea keeps the hydrogen concentration low enough to allow the bacteria to grow.|$|E

50|$|By photographing {{a person}} in <b>their</b> natural <b>surroundings,</b> {{it is thought that}} {{you will be able to}} better {{illuminate}} their character, and therefore portray the essence of their personality, rather than merely a likeness of their physical features. It is also thought that by photographing {{a person in}} <b>their</b> natural <b>surroundings,</b> the subject will be more at ease, and so be more conducive to expressing themselves, as opposed to in a studio, which can be a rather intimidating and artificial experience.|$|R
5|$|Dominican {{folk music}} is an oral tradition, learned informally through {{watching}} others perform. As of 1987, most performers of traditional music were either over 50 {{years old or}} under 35, which indicates an ongoing revival of previously declining traditions. Music is evaluated based on both characteristics of the music, such as complex syncopated rhythms, {{as well as social}} factors, such as the ability of the performers to improvise and respond to <b>their</b> <b>surroundings</b> and to keep the audience excited and participating in the music.|$|E
5|$|Fish are cold-blooded, and {{in general}} their body {{temperature}} {{is the same as}} that of <b>their</b> <b>surroundings.</b> They gain and lose heat through their skin and during respiration and are able to regulate their circulation in response to changes in water temperature by increasing or reducing the blood flow to the gills. Metabolic heat generated in the muscles or gut is quickly dissipated through the gills, with blood being diverted away from the gills during exposure to cold. Because of their relative inability to control their blood temperature, most teleosts can only survive in a small range of water temperatures.|$|E
5|$|John Ratzenberger and Kathy Najimy as John and Mary, respectively. John and Mary both {{live on the}} Axiom and are so {{dependent}} on their personal video screens and automatic services that they are oblivious to <b>their</b> <b>surroundings,</b> for instance not noticing that the ship features a giant swimming pool. However, they are brought out of their trances after separate encounters with WALL-E, eventually meeting face-to-face for the first time.|$|E

5|$|Most {{microorganisms}} {{and plants}} can biosynthesize all 20 standard amino acids, while animals (including humans) must obtain {{some of the}} amino acids from the diet. The amino acids that an organism cannot synthesize on its own {{are referred to as}} essential amino acids. Key enzymes that synthesize certain amino acids are not present in animals â€” such as aspartokinase, which catalyses {{the first step in the}} synthesis of lysine, methionine, and threonine from aspartate. If amino acids are present in the environment, microorganisms can conserve energy by taking up the amino acids from <b>their</b> <b>surroundings</b> and downregulating their biosynthetic pathways.|$|E
5|$|Scott's {{influence}} is felt throughout the novel. Lengthy {{descriptions of the}} countryside are interrupted constantly by tangents explaining the history of Brittany and its people. The pastoral setting is integrated into the plot, particularly the guerrilla combat of the Chouans. In complementing individual with environs Balzac also shows the influence of James Fenimore Cooper, whose The Last of the Mohicans had impressed the French author. Like the Mahicans of Cooper's novel, the Chouan insurgents are skilled at using <b>their</b> <b>surroundings,</b> {{coming out of the}} woods in more ways than one.|$|E
5|$|The steep conical cinder cones of Edziza {{were formed}} by lava {{fountain}} eruptions, emitting particles and blobs of congealed lava {{from a single}} vent. As the gas-charged lava is blown violently into the air, it breaks into small fragments that solidify and fall as cinder around the vent to form a circular or oval cone. Edziza's cinder cones have bowl-shaped craters at their summits and rise {{more than a hundred}} metres above <b>their</b> <b>surroundings.</b> Cinder cones are widespread in British Columbia as well as throughout other volcanic terrains of the world.|$|E

5|$|There {{are four}} {{different}} general schemes in which diffusion may take place. Tracer diffusion and chemical diffusion {{differ in the}} level of adsorbate coverage at the surface, while intrinsic diffusion and mass transfer diffusion differ {{in the nature of the}} diffusion environment. Tracer diffusion and intrinsic diffusion both refer to systems where adparticles experience a relatively homogeneous environment, whereas in chemical and mass transfer diffusion adparticles are more strongly affected by <b>their</b> <b>surroundings.</b>|$|E
5|$|There {{are seven}} {{recognized}} subspecies across {{the range of}} these wrens and they differ slightly in song and appearance. The birds are generally inconspicuous, avoiding the open for extended periods of time. When out in the open, they investigate <b>their</b> <b>surroundings</b> and are rarely stationary. After finding a mate, pairs maintain a territory and stay together for several years. Both sexes give out alarm calls, but only males sing to advertise territory. Carolina wrens raise multiple broods during the summer breeding season, but can fall victim to brood parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds, among other species. Some populations {{have been affected by}} mercury contamination.|$|E
5|$|These {{monitors}} {{will rise}} {{up on their}} hind legs to check <b>their</b> <b>surroundings,</b> a behavior that has also been documented in Gould's monitors (V.gouldii). They are known to exhibit a warning posture, in which they carry their tails rolled up behind them. According to native belief, they will give a warning call if they see crocodiles. In general V.salvadorii avoids human contact, but its bite is capable of causing infection, like the Komodo dragon's. One fatality was reported from a bite in 1983 when a Papuan woman was bitten and later died from an infection.|$|E
