5|$|Early in his career, Jim Henson's {{work was}} aimed at mature audiences. His {{television}} program Sam and Friends was designed for young adults. During this period, his characters often appeared on late-night, comedy television programs The Jimmy Dean Show and The Ed Sullivan Show. Throughout the 1960s, Jim Henson used his puppets for profane, irreverent comedy. These early Henson creations made references <b>to</b> <b>substance</b> abuse and sexual intercourse; The A.V. Club said Henson was probably influenced {{by the work of}} Ralph Bakshi, who was also active during the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Individuals {{with severe}} mental illness, {{including}} schizophrenia, {{are at a}} significantly greater risk of being victims of both violent and non-violent crime. Schizophrenia {{has been associated with}} a higher rate of violent acts, but most appear to be related to associated substance abuse. Rates of homicide linked to psychosis are similar to those linked <b>to</b> <b>substance</b> misuse, and parallel the overall rate in a region. What role schizophrenia has on violence independent of drug misuse is controversial, but certain aspects of individual histories or mental states may be factors. About 11% of people in prison for homicide have schizophrenia while 21% have mood disorders. Another study found about 8-10% of people with schizophrenia had committed a violent act in the past year compared to 2% of the general population.|$|E
25|$|A {{criticism}} of Chancery practice as it {{developed in the}} early medieval period was that it lacked fixed rules and that the Lord Chancellor was exercising an unbounded discretion. The counter-argument was that Equity mitigated the rigour of the common law by looking <b>to</b> <b>substance</b> rather than to form.|$|E

Other cross-tolerant sedative hypnotics, such as barbiturates or alcohol, increase the risk of benzodiazepine dependence.

25|$|From this {{it can be}} {{seen that}} {{attributes}} are related <b>to</b> <b>substance</b> in some way. It is not clear, however, even from Spinoza's direct definition, whether, a) attributes are really the way(s) substance is, or b) attributes are simply ways to understand substance, but not necessarily the ways it really is.|$|E
25|$|Low {{levels of}} effortful control can render the {{individual}} {{less able to}} distract themselves from unpleasant feelings or overcome strong affective impulses, resulting in maladaptive responses to distress – such as continued substance use. Low effortful control may also interact with negative and positive affect, predisposing individuals <b>to</b> <b>substance</b> or behavioural use, and impair their ability to control use.|$|E

25|$|To try {{to reduce}} their anxiety and {{alleviate}} depression, people with social phobia may use alcohol or other drugs, which can lead <b>to</b> <b>substance</b> abuse. It is estimated that one-fifth of patients with social anxiety disorder also suffer from alcohol dependence. However, some research suggests SAD is unrelated to, or even protective against alcohol-related problems. Those who suffer from both alcoholism and social anxiety disorder {{are more likely to}} avoid group-based treatments and to relapse compared to people who do not have this combination.|$|E
25|$|Critics of {{this model}} argue that it ignores {{research}} linking domestic violence <b>to</b> <b>substance</b> abuse and psychological problems. Some modern research into the patterns in DV has found {{that women are more}} likely to be physically abusive towards their partner in relationships in which only one partner is violent, which draws the effectiveness of using concepts like male privilege to treat domestic violence into question. Some modern research into predictors of injury from domestic violence suggests that the strongest predictor of injury by domestic violence is participation in reciprocal domestic violence.|$|E
25|$|Individuals {{differ in}} the way by which they metabolize substances, such as alcohol; these {{positive}} reinforcing effects are partly predetermined. Individual reactivity {{to the effects of}} substances may affect motivation to use. For example, if a person experiences strong positive (and weak negative) effects from a substance, due to their biochemical profile, their expectations of the positive effects from the substance will be heightened, therefore increasing their desire for continued use, resulting in dependence. According to this model, the experience of the positive mood enhances implicit attention <b>to</b> <b>substance</b> cues and implicit associations between reward and substance use.|$|E

40|$|Validation of an {{aggregate}} exposure model for substances in consumer products: {{a case study}} of diethyl phthalate in personal care products Christiaan Delmaar 1, Bas Bokkers 1, Wouter ter Burg 1 and Gerlienke Schuur 1 As personal care products (PCPs) are used in close contact with a person, they are a major source of consumer exposure <b>to</b> chemical <b>substances</b> contained in these products. The estimation of realistic consumer exposure <b>to</b> <b>substances</b> in PCPs is currently hampered by the lack of appropriate data and methods. To estimate aggregate exposure of consumers <b>to</b> <b>substances</b> contained in PCPs, a person-oriented consumer exposure model has been developed (the Probabilistic Aggregate Consumer Exposure Model, PACEM). The model simulates daily exposure in a population based on product use data collected from a survey among the Dutch population. The model is validated by comparing diethyl phthalate (DEP) dose estimates to dose estimates based on biomonitoring data. It was found that the model’s estimates compared well with the estimates based on biomonitoring data. This suggests that the person-oriented PACEM model is a practical tool for assessing realistic aggregate exposures <b>to</b> <b>substances</b> in PCPs. In the future, PACEM will be extended with use pattern data on other product groups. This will allow for assessing aggregate exposure <b>to</b> <b>substances</b> in consumer products across different product groups...|$|R

25|$|Another {{important}} factor {{to consider is}} the individual differences {{in the experience of}} pleasurable effects brought on by the substance or behaviour. It is reasoned that certain individuals may be more sensitive to the pleasurable effects and thus experience them with greater intensity, resulting in addiction. For example, over-responsiveness <b>to</b> <b>substance</b> affects has been found in cocaine addicts – an increased response to methylphenidate in the brain regions associated with emotional reactivity and mood. Thus, strong emotional responses that addicted individuals show in response to substances or behaviours might be results of enhanced sensitivity to their effects.|$|E
25|$|The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) {{is funding}} pilot studies and {{clinical}} trials investigating {{the use of}} MDMA in psychotherapy to treat posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), social anxiety in autistic adults, and anxiety in terminal illness. In November 2016, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved large-scale phase 3 clinical trials involving the use of MDMA {{for the treatment of}} PTSD in individuals who do not respond to traditional prescription drugs or psychotherapy. MDMA has also been proposed as an adjunct <b>to</b> <b>substance</b> abuse treatment. In 2017, doctors in the UK began the first clinical study of MDMA in alcohol addiction.|$|E
25|$|According to this model, {{substance}} abuse problems may arise under two different personality traits: low BIS and high BAS. Since the BAS promotes {{the individual to}} pursue actions that may result in reward, BAS sensitivity {{is involved in the}} initiation of addiction. Significant associations have been found between high BAS such as alcohol misuse in school girls, hazardous drinking in men, illicit drug abuse, and tobacco use. BAS sensitivity is a significant predictor of reactivity <b>to</b> <b>substance</b> cues, or cravings. Conversely, BIS sensitivity is involved in avoiding negative situations or affect (such as withdrawal). Low BIS has been positively associated with continuing the addiction to relieve feelings of withdrawal, or for continued use to alleviate negative affect.|$|E
50|$|It is not {{uncommon}} for those dependent or addicted <b>to</b> <b>substances</b> <b>to</b> enter or remain in a state of polypharmacy misuse.

40|$|My aim in {{this paper}} is to examine Aristotle’s notions of {{priority}} in order to determine which sort of priority he ascribes <b>to</b> <b>substances.</b> I try <b>to</b> show that we cannot accept the traditional idea that a substance’s priority must be understood as existential independence. Aristotle rather ascribes <b>to</b> <b>substances</b> a priority in terms of completion, as he ascribes to substances-of-something some specific sort of causal-explanatory priority. Besides that, Aristotle argues, against Platonism, that these two sorts of priority (completion priority and causal-explanatory priority) must be kept apart from each other in any successful ontology...|$|R
25|$|Prospective {{epidemiological}} studies {{do not support}} the hypotheses that comorbidity of substance use disorders with other psychiatric illnesses is primarily a consequence of substance abuse or dependence or that increasing comorbidity is largely attributable to increasing use of substances. Yet emphasis is often on the effects of substances on the brain creating the impression that dual disorders are a natural consequence of these substances. However addictive drugs or exposure to gambling will not lead to addictive behaviors or drug dependence in most individuals but only in vulnerable ones, although, according to some researchers, neuroadaptation or regulation of neuronal plasticity, and molecular changes, may alter gene expression in some cases and subsequently lead <b>to</b> <b>substance</b> use disorders.|$|E
25|$|Metaphysical naturalists do {{not believe}} in a soul or spirit, nor in ghosts, and when {{explaining}} what constitutes the mind they rarely appeal <b>to</b> <b>substance</b> dualism. If one's mind, or rather one's identity and existence as a person, is entirely the product of natural processes, three conclusions follow according to W.T. Stace. First, all mental contents (such as ideas, theories, emotions, moral and personal values, or aesthetic response) exist solely as computational constructions of one's brain and genetics, not as things that exist independently of these. Second, damage to the brain (regardless of how) should be of great concern. Third, death or destruction of one's brain cannot be survived, which is to say, all humans are mortal. Stace, however, believes that ecstatic mysticism calls into question the assumption that awareness is impossible without data processing.|$|E
25|$|Some time later, Donna (revealed to {{be another}} false name) converses with a fellow police officer, Mike, and the {{audience}} learns that New-Path {{is responsible for the}} manufacture and distribution of Substance D; ironically they use victims of the drug to tend their crops, since (being nearly mindless) they can be trusted not to reveal New-Path's secret. Donna expresses her growing ethical aversion to their police work, in which they deliberately selected Arctor—without his knowledge—to become addicted <b>to</b> <b>Substance</b> D all along; his health was sacrificed so that he might eventually enter a New-Path rehabilitation center unnoticed as a genuine addict and collect incriminating evidence of New-Path's Substance D farms. Donna and Mike debate whether Arctor's mind will recover enough so that he grasps the situation and returns from serving his sentence with substantial evidence to shut down New-Path.|$|E

25|$|In November 2011, after 44 years, a {{compilation}} box {{set of the}} Beach Boys' Smile sessions was finally released by Capitol Records. Parks was personally absent from The Smile Sessions advertising campaign and liner notes, and {{refused to comment on}} the box set, despite initially giving his approval. In promotional interviews for The Smile Sessions and the Beach Boys' 50th Reunion Tour, Mike Love suggested that Smile collapsed due <b>to</b> <b>substance</b> abuse, and that the project was heavily influenced by Parks' drug use. One interview included an off-the-cuff comment by Brian Wilson saying that it was Parks who introduced him to LSD and amphetamines, something Parks has previously denied. Later in 2011, Parks formally responded to these claims via his web site in a post that accused Love of Mammon and historical revisionism. In February 2013, The Smile Sessions {{went on to win the}} Grammy Award for Best Historical Album.|$|E
25|$|Labelled drug-related {{expenditures}} {{are defined as}} the direct planned spending that reflects the voluntary engagement {{of the state in}} the field of illicit drugs. Direct public expenditures explicitly labeled as drug-related can be easily traced back by exhaustively reviewing official accountancy documents such as national budgets and year-end reports. Unlabelled expenditure refers to unplanned spending and is estimated through modeling techniques, based on a top-down budgetary procedure. Starting from overall aggregated expenditures, this procedure estimates the proportion causally attributable <b>to</b> <b>substance</b> abuse (Unlabelled Drug-related Expenditure = Overall Expenditure × Attributable Proportion). For example, to estimate the prison drug-related expenditures in a given country, two elements would be necessary: the overall prison expenditures in the country for a given period, and the attributable proportion of inmates due to drug-related issues. The product of the two will give a rough estimate that can be compared across different countries.|$|E
25|$|Whether an {{individual}} develops certain diseases or disorders is also established, {{to a certain}} degree, {{on the basis of}} nature and nurture. Genes often predispose individuals to certain disorders or diseases, while environmental factors can trigger the onset. Susceptibility of diabetes is determined by inherited differences in DNA, but environmental factors such as diet, weight, age, and physical activity seem to be triggering the onset of the disease. Genetic make-up, in addition to the environment with which the genes are exposed to, is influencing the behaviour of consumers with regard to the food choices they make. Addiction <b>to</b> <b>substance</b> abuse is partially determined by genes, which predispose individuals to have addictive personalities; however the stimuli with which an addiction develops is dependent on the environment. Addiction is persistent and compulsive, and has a significant impact upon consumer behaviour. Individuals who experience substance abuse, for example, are prone to basing their consumption primarily around the purchasing of alcohol, even {{at the expense of other}} important aspects of well-being.|$|E
