Originated from a general {{premise that the}} <b>unmanned</b> <b>aircraft</b> regulations should evolve from the existing standards for manned aircraft of equivalent class or category, the light fixed wing <b>unmanned</b> <b>aircraft</b> equivalence to the manned aircraft is defined {{in the form of}} sets of equivalency and non-equivalency based on the established administrative type of methodology of impact kinetic energy comparison. The basic flight characteristics of the existing operational light fixed wing <b>unmanned</b> <b>aircraft</b> are analyzed assuring proper input for determination of the more realistic <b>unmanned</b> <b>aircraft</b> impact kinetic energy in controlled and uncontrolled flight into terrain crash scenarios used for the evaluation of established methodology adequacy for equivalence determination.

40|$|<b>Unmanned</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{systems are}} {{currently}} being used primarily for military applications, but with the evolution of avionics technology, a huge market in civil applications is emerging. However, most civil applications require <b>unmanned</b> <b>aircraft</b> systems to access non segregated airspace. Current use limitations of non segregated airspace make it extremely difficult to extensively evaluate operational concepts and mission profiles. Using real flights to test the complete <b>unmanned</b> <b>aircraft</b> system mission infrastructure involves costs and risks. Therefore, simulators must be used prior to real flight campaigns to test and validate un manned aircraft system components, and they {{must take into account}} all the actors involved in the nonsegregated airspace. This paper describes the development of a software- in-the-loop simulator called ISIS+ to evaluate the automated operations of <b>unmanned</b> <b>aircraft</b> systems in nonsegregated airspace and to test new software components of the <b>unmanned</b> <b>aircraft</b> systems with other avionics components. The ISIS+ simulator provides a realistic simulation environment in which the <b>unmanned</b> <b>aircraft</b> system software components can be developed under real air traffic scenarios while taking into account all the unmanned aircraftsystem’ speculiarities. The <b>unmanned</b> <b>aircraft</b> system is integrated with Early Demonstration and Simulation Platform, an air traffic simulation environment, in order to explore the <b>unmanned</b> <b>aircraft</b> system behavior, conflicting traffic, and air traffic controllers’ requests with the airspace actors. The integration is carried out using automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast messages and considers the <b>unmanned</b> <b>aircraft</b> system as an active actor in the networked environment to simulate future Single European Sky ATM Research and Next Generation Air Transportation System scenariosPostprint (published version...|$|R

40|$|This work {{describes}} the testing involved in generating an acoustic signature {{profile of a}} small multi-rotor <b>unmanned</b> <b>aircraft</b> system. A typical multi-rotor <b>unmanned</b> <b>aircraft</b> system, with a weight of approximately 2. 1 kg, was used for sound pressure level measurements. This study established a relationship between distance, altitude and sound pressure level, finding that the sound decays approximately in line with 6 dB(A) reduction for a doubling of distance. The effect of {{the orientation of the}} multi-rotor <b>unmanned</b> <b>aircraft</b> system was also investigated. It was determined that the sound profile does not vary significantly around the periphery of the multi-rotor <b>unmanned</b> <b>aircraft</b> system in the propeller-plane. However, when measured with the observer underneath the multi-rotor <b>unmanned</b> <b>aircraft</b> system, the sound pressure level was found to vary by as much as 10 dB(A), with the greatest sound pressure level at approximately 45 ° from horizontal. Finally, an acoustic array was used to measure key frequencies for the main sound sources: motors and propellers. It was found that extraneous noise from the multi-rotor <b>unmanned</b> <b>aircraft</b> system frame vibration and mounting methods was also common. Despite relatively low levels of sound being measured (especially when compared with conventional aircraft and rotorcraft), the increasing numbers of <b>unmanned</b> <b>aircraft</b> systems in urban environments, close to humans and dwellings, suggests that increasing complaints are likely. Thus, further research was suggested, including expanding the range of multi-rotor <b>unmanned</b> <b>aircraft</b> system to be tested, introducing DGPS, improving the mounting for indoor testing, and psychoacoustic analysis of the sound...|$|R

40|$|<b>Unmanned</b> <b>aircraft</b> are {{expected}} to increase in use in civil applications over the coming years, particularly for the so-called dull, dirty and dangerous missions. <b>Unmanned</b> <b>aircraft</b> will undoubtedly require some form of autonomy {{in order to ensure}} safe operations: communications failure could render a completely human-piloted <b>unmanned</b> <b>aircraft</b> dangerous to other airspace users. In order to be used for civil applications, <b>unmanned</b> <b>aircraft</b> must gain government regulatory approval in a process known as certification. This paper presents an approach to gathering evidence for certification of autonomous <b>unmanned</b> <b>aircraft</b> based on formal methods (in particular formal model checking) and flight simulation. In particular, rational agent-based autonomous systems are examined. Rational agents for <b>unmanned</b> <b>aircraft</b> can be model checked using implicit models of the aircraft’s physical environment specified in terms of the different sensor inputs the autonomous system may receive. However this presents difficulties when trying to model check the agents relative to physical quantities such as those found in regulatory documents like the CAA Air Navigation Order. It is shown how this can be remedied using an explicit physical model of the environment within the model checker, and how this explicit physical model can itself be verified through comparison with flight simulations.
