Different types of fault current limiters are available but the SFCL, thanks to its intrinsic properties, with an extremely non-linear resistivity, {{can be seen as a}} natural fault current limiter. At this day, the resistive SFCL (rSFCL) and the inductive SFCL (iSFCL) appear to be the most used in electrical network. Some papers deal with rSFCL and iSFCL but most of them reduce the comparison to the three-phase short-circuit only. However, despite it's one of the most critical case, it is not the most common. For example, if a phase-to-phase short circuit with earth connection occurs close to a transformer with low zero sequence impedance, its amplitude could be higher than the three-phase one. The proposed study, based on symmetrical components, takes into account various fault types (i. e. single line-to-ground fault, line-to-line fault, double line-to-ground fault, three-phase fault) at different locations in meshed and non-meshed HV power system. Comparisons were made by studying the initial symmetrical short-circuit current and the first peak short-circuit current at the fault point and near the fault location (parallel transmission line, generator, …). Various SFCL impedance values and SFCL locations were studied to determine which type of SFCLs is the most effective. In addition, we studied the effects of the power system parameters changes in presence of SFCL (i. e. transformer connection, X/R line ratio). Results show that the rSFCL is the most suitable to limit the first peak of the fault current. About the optimal location the SFCL, we conclude that the <b>transformer</b> <b>feeder</b> is more interesting than the line feeder. In fact, for a power system with parallel transmission lines, we show that a line feeder position induces a significant increase of the current in the healthy line leading to a breaker trip...|$|E

40|$|Determination of the {{placement}} and rating of <b>transformers</b> and <b>feeders</b> {{are the main}} objective of the basic distribution network planning. The bus voltage and the feeder current are two constraints which should be maintained within their standard range. The distribution network planning is hardened when the planning area is located far from the sources of power generation and the infrastructure. This is mainly {{as a consequence of}} the voltage drop, line loss and system reliability. Long distance to supply loads causes a significant amount of voltage drop across the distribution lines. Capacitors and Voltage Regulators (VRs) can be installed to decrease the voltage drop. This long distance also increases the probability of occurrence of a failure. This high probability leads the network reliability to be low. Cross-Connections (CC) and Distributed Generators (DGs) are devices which can be employed for improving system reliability. Another main factor which should be considered in planning of distribution networks (in both rural and urban areas) is load growth. For supporting this factor, <b>transformers</b> and <b>feeders</b> are conventionally upgraded which applies a large cost. Installation of DGs and capacitors in a distribution network can alleviate this issue while the other benefits are gained. In this research, a comprehensive planning is presented for the distribution networks. Since the distribution network is composed of low and medium voltage networks, both are included in this procedure. However, the main focus of this research is on the medium voltage network planning. The main objective is to minimize the investment cost, the line loss, and the reliability indices for a study timeframe and to support load growth. The investment cost is related to the distribution network elements such as the <b>transformers,</b> <b>feeders,</b> capacitors, VRs, CCs, and DGs. The voltage drop and the feeder current as the constraints are maintained within their standard range. In addition to minimizing the reliability and line loss costs, the planned network should support a continual growth of loads, which is an essential concern in planning distribution networks. In this thesis, a novel segmentation-based strategy is proposed for including this factor. Using this strategy, the computation time is significantly reduced compared with the exhaustive search method as the accuracy is still acceptable. In addition to being applicable for considering the load growth, this strategy is appropriate for inclusion of practical load characteristic (dynamic), as demonstrated in this thesis. The allocation and sizing problem has a discrete nature with several local minima. This highlights the importance of selecting a proper optimization method. Modified discrete particle swarm optimization as a heuristic method is introduced in this research to solve this complex planning problem. Discrete nonlinear programming and genetic algorithm as an analytical and a heuristic method respectively are also applied to this problem to evaluate the proposed optimization method...|$|R

The effectiveness of the proposed distributed cooperative voltage control scheme is verified through simulations.

30|$|Among all {{negative}} impacts that DERs may introduce to the distribution system concerned, congestion {{is likely to}} be the most fatal one as it may directly damage the devices such as distribution <b>transformers</b> and <b>feeders.</b> In general, congestions in a distribution system may be caused by various factors, e.g. very high power consumption during peak hours, concentrated charging of EVs and excessive power generation from DGs. Distribution system congestion has been studied in some existing publications, and two kinds of methods proposed, i.e. market-based methods and direct control methods. Market-based methods include the day-ahead dynamic tariff, distribution capacity market, intra-day shadow price and flexibility service market [14]. For example, a congestion fee based market mechanism is proposed in [15] where the DSO predicts possible congestions for the coming trading day and publishes tariffs prior to the clearing of the day-ahead market to alleviate distribution congestions; the notion of flexibility clearing houses (FLECH) is proposed in [16] to enable small scale DERs to participate in flexibility service trading; a novel plan that establishes an individual charging plan for each EV to mitigate distribution system congestion while meeting the requirements of EV owners is developed in [17]; three potential strategies for congestion management are presented in [18]. The direct control methods include network reconfiguration, active power control and reactive power control. For instance, an optimal reconfiguration-based dynamic tariff (DT) method considering feeder reconfiguration in calculating DT is proposed for congestion management and line loss reduction in distribution networks with high penetration of EVs in [19].|$|R

40|$|Implementing {{distributed}} utility can {{strengthen the}} local distribution system and help avoid or delay {{the expense of}} upgrading <b>transformers</b> and <b>feeders.</b> The gas turbine-generator set is an attractive option based on its low front-end capital cost, reliable performance at unmanned stations, and environmental performance characteristics. This report assesses gas turbine utilization issues from a perspective of fuel supply pressure requirements and discusses both cost and operational factors. A primary operational consideration for siting gas turbines on the electric distribution system is whether the local gas distribution company can supply gas at the required pressure. Currently available gas turbine engines require gas supply pressures of at least 150 {{pounds per square inch}} gauge, more typically, 250 to 350 psig. Few LDCs maintain line pressure in excess of 125 psig. One option for meeting the gas pressure requirements is to upgrade or extend an existing pipeline and connect that pipeline to a high-pressure supply source, such as an interstate transmission line. However, constructing new pipeline is expensive, and the small volume of gas required by the turbine for the application offers little incentive for the LDC to provide this service. Another way to meet gas pressure requirements is to boost the compression of the fuel gas at the gas turbine site. Fuel gas booster compressors are readily available as stand-alone units and can satisfactorily increase the supply pressure to meet the turbine engine requirement. However, the life-cycle costs of this equipment are not inconsequential, and maintenance and reliability issues for boosters in this application are questionable and require further study. These factors may make the gas turbine option a less attractive solution in DU applications than first indicated by just the $/kW capital cost. On the other hand, for some applications other DU technologies, such as photovoltaics, may be the more attractive option...|$|R

As an example a critical situation may arise if protective relays trip {{a large part of}} the dispersed generation due to undervoltage at a short-circuit event. On the other hand it is crucial that the protection system acts correctly to protect life and property in other situations. These qualities are referred to as security and dependability. There are a number of different kinds of anti-islanding or loss-of-mains protections. Some are implemented in practice while others are still on a research level. This thesis provides an analysis of benefits and drawbacks of methods that are applied today. The ability of the different methods to avoid nuisance tripping and provide robust protection is investigated. To draw the attention to industrial experience, some cases are described where dispersed generations were nuisance tripped. Recordings from islanding events are presented and analyzed. Performance of present anti islanding protections is commented. A comparison of grid codes in Sweden, Denmark and Germany serves as an example of the situations in different countries. Today there are differences in the connection requirements depending on different designs of the distribution systems. These varying requirements lead to different demands on the islanding detection devices. The thesis summarizes the technical requirements on the islanding portion of the protection system. To compare the protection algorithms, they are exposed to challenging situations in a common simulation environment.
