40|$|Large <b>temperature</b> <b>gradients</b> {{exacerbate}} {{various types}} of defects including early-life failures and delay faults. Efficient detection of these defects requires that burn-in and test for delay faults, respectively, are performed when <b>temperature</b> <b>gradients</b> with proper magnitudes are enforced on an Integrated Circuit (IC). This issue {{is much more important}} for 3 -D stacked ICs (3 -D SICs) compared with 2 -D ICs because of the larger <b>temperature</b> <b>gradients</b> in 3 -D SICs. In this paper, two methods to efficiently enforce the specified <b>temperature</b> <b>gradients</b> on the IC, for burn-in and delay-fault test, are proposed. The specified <b>temperature</b> <b>gradients</b> are enforced by applying high-power stimuli to the cores of the IC under test through the test access mechanism. Therefore, no external heating mechanism is required. The tests, high power stimuli, and cooling intervals are scheduled together based on temperature simulations so that the desired <b>temperature</b> <b>gradients</b> are rapidly enforced. The schedule generation is guided by functions derived from a set of thermal equations. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods...|$|R

5|$|The liquid thermal {{diffusion}} process {{was based on the}} discovery by Carl Ludwig in 1856 and later Charles Soret in 1879, that when a <b>temperature</b> <b>gradient</b> is maintained in an originally homogeneous salt solution, after a time, a concentration gradient will also exist in the solution. This is generally known today as the Soret effect. David Enskog in 1911 and Sydney Chapman in 1916 independently developed the Chapman–Enskog theory, which explained that when a mixture of two gases passes through a <b>temperature</b> <b>gradient,</b> the heavier gas tends to concentrate at the cold end and the lighter gas at the warm end. This was experimentally confirmed by Chapman and F.W. Dootson in 1916.|$|E
5|$|Because {{glass is}} very brittle in its solid state, {{it is often}} prone to {{cracking}} upon heating and cooling, especially if the heating and cooling are uneven.

40|$|Context. The {{physical}} {{properties of the}} so-called Ostriker isothermal filament have been classically used as a benchmark to interpret {{the stability of the}} filaments observed in nearby clouds. However, recent continuum {{studies have shown that the}} internal structure of the filaments depart from the isothermality, typically exhibiting radially increasing <b>temperature</b> <b>gradients.</b> Aims. The presence of internal <b>temperature</b> <b>gradients</b> within filaments suggests that the equilibrium configuration of these objects should be therefore revisited. The main goal of this work is to theoretically explore how the equilibrium structure of a filament changes in a nonisothermal configuration. Methods. We solve the hydrostatic equilibrium equation by assuming <b>temperature</b> <b>gradients</b> similar to those derived from observations. Results. We obtain a new set of equilibrium solutions for nonisothermal filaments with both linear and asymptotically constant <b>temperature</b> <b>gradients.</b> For sufficiently large internal <b>temperature</b> <b>gradients,</b> our results show that a nonisothermal filament could present significantly larger masses per unit length and shallower density profiles than the isothermal filament without collapsing by its own gravity. Conclusions. We conclude that filaments can reach an equilibrium configuration under nonisothermal conditions. Detailed studies of both the internal mass distribution and <b>temperature</b> <b>gradients</b> within filaments are then needed to judge the physical state of filaments. © ESO, 2013...|$|R

5|$|Because {{there is}} a {{temperature}} difference between the core and the surface, or photosphere, energy is transported outward. The two modes for transporting this energy are radiation and convection. A radiation zone, where energy is transported by radiation, is stable against convection and {{there is very little}} mixing of the plasma. By contrast, in a convection zone the energy is transported by bulk movement of plasma, with hotter material rising and cooler material descending. Convection is a more efficient mode for carrying energy than radiation, but it will only occur under conditions that create a steep <b>temperature</b> <b>gradient.</b>|$|E
5|$|From {{the core}} {{out to about}} 0.7 solar radii, thermal {{radiation}} is the primary means of energy transfer. The temperature drops from approximately 7 million to 2 million kelvins with increasing distance from the core. This <b>temperature</b> <b>gradient</b> {{is less than the}} value of the adiabatic lapse rate and hence cannot drive convection, which explains why the transfer of energy through this zone is by radiation instead of thermal convection. Ions of hydrogen and helium emit photons, which travel only a brief distance before being reabsorbed by other ions. The density drops a hundredfold (from 20 g/cm3 to 0.2 g/cm3) from 0.25 solar radii to the 0.7 radii, the top of the radiative zone.|$|E
5|$|Mimas, the {{innermost}} {{of the round}} moons of Saturn and directly interior to Enceladus, is a geologically dead body, even though it should experience stronger tidal forces than Enceladus. This apparent paradox can be explained in part by temperature-dependent properties of water ice (the main constituent of the interiors of Mimas and Enceladus). The tidal heating per unit mass is given by the formula , where ρ is the (mass) density of the satellite, n is its mean orbital motion, r is the satellite's radius, e is the orbital eccentricity of the satellite, μ is the shear modulus and Q is the dimensionless dissipation factor. For a same-temperature approximation, the expected value of qtid for Mimas is about 40 times that of Enceladus. However, the material parameters μ and Q are temperature dependent. At high temperatures (close to the melting point), μ and Q are low, so tidal heating is high. Modeling suggests that for Enceladus, both a 'basic' low-energy thermal state with little internal <b>temperature</b> <b>gradient,</b> and an 'excited' high-energy thermal state with a significant <b>temperature</b> <b>gradient,</b> and consequent convection (endogenic geologic activity), once established, would be stable. For Mimas, only a low-energy state {{is expected to be}} stable, despite its being closer to Saturn. So the model predicts a low-internal-temperature state for Mimas (values of μ and Q are high) but a possible higher-temperature state for Enceladus (values of μ and Q are low). Additional historical information is needed to explain how Enceladus first entered the high-energy state (e.g. more radiogenic heating or a more eccentric orbit in the past).|$|E

5|$|A {{subtropical}} cyclone is {{a weather}} {{system that has}} some characteristics of a tropical cyclone and some characteristics of an extratropical cyclone. They can form between the equator and the 50th parallel. As early as the 1950s, meteorologists were unclear whether they should be characterized as tropical cyclones or extratropical cyclones, and used terms such as quasi-tropical and semi-tropical to describe the cyclone hybrids. By 1972, the National Hurricane Center officially recognized this cyclone category. Subtropical cyclones began to receive names off the official tropical cyclone list in the Atlantic Basin in 2002. They have broad wind patterns with maximum sustained winds located farther from the center than typical tropical cyclones, and exist in areas of weak to moderate <b>temperature</b> <b>gradient.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cumulus {{clouds are}} often {{precursors}} of {{other types of}} cloud, such as cumulonimbus, when influenced by weather factors such as instability, moisture, and <b>temperature</b> <b>gradient.</b> Normally, cumulus clouds produce little or no precipitation, but they can grow into the precipitation-bearing congestus or cumulonimbus clouds. Cumulus clouds can be formed from water vapor, supercooled water droplets, or ice crystals, depending upon the ambient temperature. They come in many distinct subforms, and generally cool the earth by reflecting the incoming solar radiation. Cumulus clouds are part of the larger category of free-convective cumuliform clouds, which include cumulonimbus clouds. The latter genus-type is sometimes categorized separately as cumulonimbiform due to its more complex structure that often includes a cirriform or anvil top. There are also cumuliform clouds of limited convection that comprise stratocumulus (low-), altocumulus (middle-étage) and cirrocumulus. (high-étage). These last three genus-types are sometimes classified separately as stratocumuliform.|$|E

5|$|In GMAW {{the primary}} cause of {{porosity}} is gas entrapment in the weld pool, which occurs when the metal solidifies before the gas escapes. The gas can come from impurities in the shielding gas or on the workpiece, as well as from an excessively long or violent arc. Generally, the amount of gas entrapped {{is directly related to the}} cooling rate of the weld pool. Because of its higher thermal conductivity, aluminum welds are especially susceptible to greater cooling rates and thus additional porosity. To reduce it, the workpiece and electrode should be clean, the welding speed diminished and the current set high enough to provide sufficient heat input and stable metal transfer but low enough that the arc remains steady. Preheating can also help reduce the cooling rate in some cases by reducing the <b>temperature</b> <b>gradient</b> between the weld area and the base material.|$|E
5|$|Synthesis of c-BN uses same methods {{as that of}} diamond: Cubic {{boron nitride}} is {{produced}} by treating hexagonal boron nitride at high pressure and temperature, much as synthetic diamond is produced from graphite.

The addition of {{a small amount of}} boron oxide can lower the required pressure to 4–7GPa and temperature to 1500°C. As in diamond synthesis, to further reduce the conversion pressures and temperatures, a catalyst is added, such as lithium, potassium, or magnesium, their nitrides, their fluoronitrides, water with ammonium compounds, or hydrazine. Other industrial synthesis methods, again borrowed from diamond growth, use crystal growth in a <b>temperature</b> <b>gradient,</b> or explosive shock wave. The shock wave method is used to produce material called heterodiamond, a superhard compound of boron, carbon, and nitrogen.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of a stable star {{is in a state}} of hydrostatic equilibrium: the forces on any small volume almost exactly counterbalance each other. The balanced forces are inward gravitational force and an outward force due to the pressure gradient within the star.

5|$|The local {{gravitational}} acceleration at the poles {{is greater than}} at the equator, so, by the Von Zeipel theorem, the local luminosity is also higher at the poles. This {{is seen as a}} variation in effective temperature over the star: the polar temperature is near 10,000K, while the equatorial temperature is 7,600K. As a result, if Vega were viewed along the plane of its equator, then the luminosity would be about half the apparent luminosity as viewed from the pole. This large temperature difference between the poles and the equator produces a strong 'gravity darkening' effect. As viewed from the poles, this results in a darker (lower intensity) limb than would normally be expected for a spherically symmetric star. The <b>temperature</b> <b>gradient</b> may also mean Vega has a convection zone around the equator, while the remainder of the atmosphere is likely to be in almost pure radiative equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|The thermal {{diffusion}} process was based on Sydney Chapman and David Enskog's theory, which explained that when a mixed gas passes through a <b>temperature</b> <b>gradient,</b> the heavier one tends to concentrate at the cold end and the lighter one at the warm end.

It was developed by US Navy scientists, but was not one of the enrichment technologies initially selected for use in the Manhattan Project. This was primarily due to doubts about its technical feasibility, but the inter-service rivalry between the Army and Navy also played a part.|$|E

The cost was estimated at $500,000. The pilot plant was authorized by Rear Admiral Earle W. Mills, the Assistant Chief of the Bureau of Ships on 17 November 1943. Construction commenced on 1 January 1944, and was completed in July. The NBTL was responsible for the design, construction and operation of the steam and cooling water systems, while the NRL dealt with the columns and subsidiary equipment. Captain Thorvald A.
