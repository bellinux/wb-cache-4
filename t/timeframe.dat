The reason which we chose to check for return reversal at those <b>timeframes</b> is because it provides a good spread from all the <b>timeframes</b> {{that we used to}} generate the models. In case the change in price at the next step is 0, we look for the nearest non-zero value in the future. Only bid data are used, since we also used bid data in training the models.|$|R
5|$|Like the {{original}} film, Stephen Chiodo {{is set to}} be the director and Charles Chiodo is set to produce.

5|$|After {{advancing}} to the Imperial Age, players can also construct a Wonder, an extremely expensive non-military building. On many gameplay modes, building a Wonder triggers a victory countdown—unless it's destroyed within a certain <b>timeframe,</b> the building player wins.

These changes are designed to improve the timely reporting and resolution of adjustment requests, improve consistency among Reserve Banks in handling adjustment requests, and eliminate unnecessary documentation supporting adjustment requests, {{commonly referred to as}} “Documents to Follow” (DTF). These changes will become effective May 1, 2001. <b>Timeframes</b> for Reporting <b>Timeframes</b> for submitting adjustment requests were revised, as appropriate, to encourage timely reporting and promote the prompt resolution of errors.

5|$|Afternoon is {{the time}} {{occurring}} between noon and evening. The specific range of time this encompasses varies in one direction: noon is currently defined as a constant 12:00 pm, but when afternoon ends is dependent on when evening begins, {{for which there is}} no standard definition. However, before a period of transition from the twelfth to fourteenth centuries, noon instead referred to 3 pm—possible explanations include shifting times for prayers and midday meals, along which one concept of noon was defined—and so afternoon would have referred to a narrower <b>timeframe.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although Fleming {{provided}} no dates within his novels, two writers have identified different timelines based on events and situations within the novel series as a whole. John Griswold and Henry Chancellor—both {{of whom have}} written books on behalf of Ian Fleming Publications—put the events of Casino Royale in 1951; Griswold allows a possible second <b>timeframe</b> and considers the story could {{have taken place in}} either May to July 1951, or May to July 1952.|$|E
5|$|Australia is {{the second}} of only two nations to have participated in IBAF-sanctioned {{continental}} tournaments {{for more than one}} continent: the Asian Baseball Championship between 1971–1993, and the Oceania Baseball Championship since 2003. The first nation to achieve this was Guam, who competed in the Asian tournament within the same <b>timeframe</b> as Australia, though they were involved in the first Oceania tournament in 1999.|$|E

During the same <b>timeframe,</b> the community of Hale embarked on a project to beautify the length of M-65 in town. The project cost $877,929 and installed park benches, new lighting, sidewalks and plantings along the highway. Funding for the venture came {{from the federal government}} and MDOT.|$|E

It was during an engagement at the London Palladium that Barbette was found engaged in sexual activity with another man. His contract was cancelled and he {{was never able to}} obtain a work permit for England again.|$|E
5|$|However, Thio Li-ann {{believes}} that it is undesirable that {{the law does not}} impose a <b>timeframe</b> for the calling of by-elections. If a by-election is not called promptly upon a parliamentary seat falling vacant, the electors in the GRC in question will be represented to a lesser extent. This is particularly pertinent where more than one MP vacates his or her seat or when the seat vacated is that of a minority candidate. Should the latter situation arise, the rationale behind the GRC scheme – to guarantee minority representation in Parliament – would be defeated.|$|E

5|$|In adults, {{the initial}} {{treatment}} for paracetamol overdose is gastrointestinal decontamination. Paracetamol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is complete {{within two hours}} under normal circumstances, so decontamination is most helpful if performed within this <b>timeframe.</b> Gastric lavage, better known as stomach pumping, may be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening and the procedure can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion. Activated charcoal {{is the most common}} gastrointestinal decontamination procedure as it adsorbs paracetamol, reducing its gastrointestinal absorption. Administering activated charcoal also poses less risk of aspiration than gastric lavage.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Air Force {{had already}} begun to up the ante in its anti-infiltration campaigns by unleashing B-52 Stratofortress bombers against the trail in December 1965. From April through June 1966 there were 400 B-52 anti-infiltration sorties against the system. The PAVN countered this effort by concentrating more {{anti-aircraft}} artillery weapons within its logistical network. Between 1964 and the end of 1967 there were 103,148 tactical air sorties launched against the trail, including 1,718 B-52 strikes. During the same <b>timeframe</b> 132 U.S. aircraft or helicopters were shot down over Laos.|$|E

One of the novels, Flashman and the Redskins, is in two parts: part one takes place in 1849–50, while the second covers 1875–76. Although the main series of stories finishes in 1894, Flashman lives on until 1915 and appears in his late 80s in another Fraser novel, Mr American.|$|E

5|$|After {{completing}} the first 15 {{years of the}} sentence, Lebrón's social worker {{told her that she}} could ask for parole, but she did not display interest in the proposal, never signing the required documentation. Due to this lack of interest, she was mandated to attend a meeting before a penitentiary committee, where she presented a written deposition expressing her position about the parole proposal as well as other subjects including terrorism, politics and the United States' use of the atomic bomb. Following this the other inmates reacted with skepticism over her intentions to refuse the offer, which made her distance herself from them and focus her attention in studying as well as writing poetry. During this <b>timeframe,</b> Lebrón's interest in religion grew. Lebrón's daughter Gladys died in 1977, while her mother was in prison.|$|E
