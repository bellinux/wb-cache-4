500|$|While Saw {{received}} mixed reviews, {{a general}} consensus among reviewers was that {{fans of the}} film series would enjoy it. Reviewer for Xbox 360 Achievements Alan Pettit wrote that while he enjoyed the game, {{it was not an}} outstanding title. Pettit commented that the game suffered due to the choice of Zombie Studios as the developer and that the franchise could be successful if a sequel was made with changes in developer and budget. Although he claimed it was repetitive, Pettit mentioned that [...] "If there was only one thing the game did well, I'd say the puzzles that are put before you are excellently constructed, well thought out and best of all, difficult enough <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> get it on your first attempt." [...] The resulting score from Pettit's review was a 74 out of 100.|$|E

500|$|Approached by Rhimes {{about the}} concept, Strickland {{agreed to the}} storyline on the {{conditions}} {{that it would not}} be limited to a single episode and would significantly impact the character. She liked the script, describing it as [...] "humanizing the victims and just really creating a legitimate experience for the audience in a way <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> see on network television". As well as communicating with RAINN representatives, the actress visited the Rape Treatment Center at UCLA Medical Center in Santa Monica and saw a young girl being admitted, which shaped her performance. Strickland also researched reactions to sexual assault by survivors, their friends and families. The decision to portray King's resistance to reporting her rape was reached after consultation with the Rape Treatment Center. Strickland defended the choice, calling it an essential aspect of King's character development. Most of the episode focused on King's psychological response to the rape. According to Strickland, ...|$|E
