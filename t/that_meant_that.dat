5|$|Because of his long-running {{television}} {{career and}} eccentric demeanour, Moore was widely recognised {{and became a}} popular public figure. In 1976 {{it was used to}} good effect for an April Fools' Day spoof on BBC Radio 2, when Moore announced a once-in-a-lifetime astronomical event <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> if listeners could jump at that exact moment, 9.47 a.m. they would experience a temporary sensation of weightlessness. The BBC received many telephone calls from listeners alleging they experienced the sensation. He was a key figure in the establishment of the International Birdman event in Bognor Regis, which was initially held in Selsey.|$|E
5|$|Several factors, however, soon {{reduced the}} value of the treaty for Prussia. Treaty of Reichenbach of July 27, 1790, meant that Prussia was no longer {{considering}} a war with Austria; the Polish–Prussian alliance now had only an anti-Russian angle. Then, on September 9, the Great Sejm, despite some opposition, declared that Commonwealth territories could not be divided. As Prussia was expecting to receive Gdańsk and Toruń from the Commonwealth as a compensation in a subsequent treaty (with Commonwealth being compensated through territorial gains from another neighbor), the Sejm declaration <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> no territory could be traded to another state made the Commonwealth a much less valuable party for Prussian long-term goals. Already in fall and winter of 1790, Prussian diplomacy begun negotiations with Russians, and hinting at its abandoning of Poland.|$|E
5|$|The {{cities of}} Ionia {{remained}} independent {{until they were}} conquered by the Lydians of western Asia Minor. The Lydian king Alyattes II attacked Miletus, a conflict that ended with a treaty of alliance between Miletus and Lydia, <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> Miletus would have internal autonomy but follow Lydia in foreign affairs. At this time, the Lydians were also {{in conflict with the}} Median Empire, and the Milesians sent an army to aid the Lydians in this conflict. Eventually a peaceable settlement was established between the Medes and the Lydians, with the Halys River set up as the border between the kingdoms. The famous Lydian king Croesus succeeded his father Alyattes in around 560 BC and set about conquering the other Greek city states of Asia Minor.|$|E

5|$|In late 1918, the British Labour Party {{called for}} the {{establishment}} of an international conference of socialist parties, the Labour and Socialist International. Lenin saw this as a revival of the Second International, which he had despised, and formulated his own rival international socialist conference to offset its impact. Organised with the aid of Zinoviev, Trotsky, Christian Rakovsky, and Angelica Balabanoff, the First Congress of this Communist International ("Comintern") opened in Moscow in March 1919. It lacked global coverage; of the 34 assembled delegates, 30 resided within the countries of the former Russian Empire, and most of the international delegates were not recognised by any socialist parties in their own nations. Accordingly, the Bolsheviks dominated proceedings, with Lenin subsequently authoring a series of regulations <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> only socialist parties endorsing the Bolsheviks' views were permitted to join Comintern. During the first conference, Lenin spoke to the delegates, lambasting the parliamentary path to socialism espoused by revisionist Marxists like Kautsky and repeating his calls for a violent overthrow of Europe's bourgeoisie governments. While Zinoviev became Comintern's President, Lenin retained significant influence over it.|$|E
5|$|In the {{penultimate}} {{round of}} matches, Dane van Niekerk made the highest {{score of the}} competition, 91 runs, to propel the Loughborough Lightning to 168 for 6, the highest team total of the tournament. During the Surrey Stars' response, van Niekerk {{was also one of}} three bowlers to take two wickets to help limit the Stars to 134 runs, and secure the Lightning a place at finals days. The Vipers travelled to Taunton unbeated before their match against the Western Storm. Batting first, the Vipers reached 137 for 3; Suzie Bates scored 57 runs and Charlotte Edwards got 30. In their reply, the Western Storm lost Rachel Priest early, but two big partnership involving Stafanie Taylor, who scored 78 not out, helped them to victory with 13 balls remaining. The final match of the day pitted the two northern sides against each other in the women's 'Roses' match. Yorkshire batted first in Manchester and scored 166; Alex Blackwell got 59 runs, and a slow over-rate meant that Yorkshire received six additional runs before the final over. In Lancashire's chase, Danielle Hazell took four wickets, and Katherine Brunt took a hat-trick to bowl the Thunder out for 71 runs. <b>That</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> Yorkshire and Lancashire had each won once during the tournament, and irrespective of results in the last round of group matches, neither could qualify for finals day; both the Southern Vipers and Western Storm would join the Loughborough Lightning.|$|E

25|$|On {{the evening}} of August 1 the London Irish moved to a lying-up area in the wadis below the foothills of Centuripe. No {{transport}} {{was able to get}} forward and <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> all ammunition, food, and other supplies had to be man-handled causing a delay.|$|E
25|$|Some of the state's {{regulations}} {{failed to}} adequately address the situation. After the 1987 drowning, {{it was reported}} that the Tidal Wave Pool was considered a pool by the state, not a ride. Under state regulations at the time, <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> the company merely had to keep the water clean and make sure that certified lifeguards were on duty.|$|E

25|$|After taking over, the JPA {{decided to}} cut costs and sell the Blackbeard, the backup vessel built in 1956. <b>That</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> {{whenever}} the Jean Ribault had problems, ferry service would be suspended. On February 5, 2009 the ferry was put into dry dock for routine maintenance, but hull corrosion required an extra week of repairs, and there was no service for a month.|$|E
25|$|Novo Ecijanos {{suffered}} {{a lot from}} the system. Nueva Ecija was more often able to meet production quotas {{compared to the other}} districts. Despite this, tobacco policy imposed a lower price on tobacco from areas closer to Manila. <b>That</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> first-class tobacco leaf grown and harvested from Nueva Ecija was priced lower by one dollar, compared to those from Ilocos, La Union and Cagayan Valley.|$|E
25|$|Effectively, <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> Fantasy {{owned and}} {{controlled}} all Stax material recorded after May 1968 and {{the handful of}} pre-May 1968 Stax singles and albums Atlantic initially declined to distribute nationally in the 1960s (none of which were hits). Fantasy also gained control and ownership of all unreleased tracks and alternate takes of Stax recordings, including those recorded before May 1968, and gained the right to issue new recordings under the Stax Records banner.|$|E

5000|$|The {{linguist}} Rasmus Rask <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> it {{was possible}} to discern the Danish female name Signe at the end of side A, sih(k)i, but that the text otherwise was written in a grammatically corrupt language form. Wimmer questioned whether {{it was possible}} to read any word at all in <b>that</b> segment, but <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> in that case it was more likely to be the verb signe [...] "bless" [...] than a name.|$|R
25|$|Thereupon, {{instead of}} {{founding}} {{itself on the}} singular, concrete individual subject, as did classic philosophy, including contractualism (Hobbes, John Locke and Rousseau) but also political economy, Marx began with the totality of social relations: labour, language and all which constitute our human existence. He claimed that individualism {{was the result of}} commodity fetishism or alienation. Some critics have claimed <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> Marx enforced a strict social determinism which destroyed the possibility of free will.|$|E
25|$|To {{overcome}} these obstacles, the Stavka assigned 11 divisions and 9 tank and assault gun regiments to the Leningrad Front. <b>That</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> there were 19 divisions, 2 division strength fortified regions, 2 tank brigades, 14 tank and assault gun regiments at the Isthmus, {{all of which}} included over 220 artillery and rocket launcher batteries (almost 3,000 guns/launchers). Around 1,500 planes from the 13th Air Army and the Baltic Fleet naval aviation {{also contributed to the}} operation which included surface and naval infantry units of the Baltic Fleet.|$|E
25|$|The changes {{affected}} {{the nature of}} candidates chosen. Under Butt, the party's MPs were a mixture of Catholic and Protestant, landlord and others, Whig, Liberal and Conservative, often leading to disagreements in policy <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> MPs split in votes. Under Parnell, the number of Protestant and landlord MPs dwindled, as did the number of Conservatives seeking election. The parliamentary party became much more Catholic and middle class, {{with a large number}} of journalists and lawyers elected and the disappearance of Protestant Ascendancy landowners and Conservatives from it.|$|E
2500|$|The {{official}} translation {{offered by}} contemporary leaders was [...] "universal brotherhood", {{but it was}} widely acknowledged <b>that</b> <b>that</b> expression <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> the Japanese were [...] "equal to the Caucasians but, to the peoples of Asia, we act as their leader".|$|R
5000|$|In {{regard to}} clarity, most ancient {{teachers}} felt <b>that</b> clarity <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> rhetors should use words in their ordinary or everyday senses. The object of clarity was to allow meaning to [...] "shine through" [...] like light through a window.|$|R
5000|$|This {{realization}} focused {{within him}} in a sudden sparkflash computation, and in the clear brilliance of that illumination, the boy Pall understood a profoundness. His life, hitherto a child's plaything, devoid of direction-seemingly! Or had there in fact always been a plan-a plan within a plan within a plan (whatever <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> (whatever <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> (whatever <b>that</b> meant)))?-was now encompassed by a terrible purpose. He knew {{the meaning of the}} word terrible, and he knew {{the meaning of the word}} purpose. And therefore he understood deeply the meaning of [...] "terrible purpose".

25|$|The Natchez chiefdom was {{destroyed}} in the 1730s by the French; Natchez speakers took refuge among their neighbors and accompanied {{them when they were}} eventually driven to Oklahoma on the Trail of Tears. <b>That</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> Natchez speakers were frequently multilingual in Creek, Cherokee, Natchez, and English, and the language gradually became endangered, and it is now generally considered extinct in spite of recent revitalization efforts. What is known of the language comes mostly from its last fluent speakers, Watt Sam and Nancy Raven, who worked with linguist Mary R. Haas in the 1930s.|$|E
25|$|Vic Jackson was {{prominent}} allrounder, bowling off breaks {{at a brisk}} {{pace with}} a rather low arm <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> he sometimes bowled a slow looping delivery. He played with Leicestershire until 1956, scoring 14379 runs and taking 930 wickets. His career best figures of 8 for 43 were taken against Glamorgan in his final season. With the bat he scored 21 hundreds, scoring 170 against Northamptonshire in 1948 as his best. He passed a thousand runs, eleven times and took 112 wickets in 1955 to complete the double. He took over ninety wickets on three occasions.|$|E
25|$|The {{case had}} been {{expected}} to reveal the details of previous settlements the paper had made, including the £1million spent in 2009, settling with three phone hacking victims, and the unfair dismissal claim won by Clive Goodman. Clifford had won court rulings in February earlier that year <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> the News of the World {{would have had to}} disclose previously secret information regarding which journalists were involved in hacking voicemail messages. A judge ruled that Glenn Mulcaire had to disclose the names of all the journalists who targeted Clifford and also those who received transcripts of the messages. With the eventual settlement, however, the information was not made public.|$|E
50|$|The {{years of}} turmoil <b>that</b> {{followed}} <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> {{little of the}} original plan was implemented.

5000|$|On June 28, Mafalda Portela was the {{contestant}} {{with the}} least amount of votes. However, the judges decided to use their only save on her. <b>That</b> decision <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> two singers would have to be eliminated the following week (Gonçalo and Albert).|$|R
60|$|He spoke lightly, {{and with}} a pretty little graceful bow to his aunt, but there was {{something}} in his eyes and smile that conveyed to her a dread <b>that</b> he <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> he only resigned himself for the time and looked beyond.|$|R
