In order to do that, I use municipal data from 2005 and, through an econometric analysis that includes spatial correlations, evaluate the impact of armed conflict on several health, education and basic sanitation indicators. The results show that armed conflict has affected the government effectiveness in providing such services. This leads one to think that, at least at <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>levels,</b> armed conflict would be putting at risk one of the basic principles of decentralization, the capacity to satisfy citizens’ needs through public service provision...|$|R
