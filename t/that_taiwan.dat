5|$|In the 1990s, Boeing and BAE Systems assumed {{management}} of the Harrier family following corporate mergers that saw Boeing acquire McDonnell Douglas and BAe amalgamate with other defense companies to form BAE Systems. Between 1969 and 2003, 824 Harriers of all models were delivered. In 2001, Flight International reported <b>that</b> <b>Taiwan</b> might meet its requirement for a short take off and vertical landing (STOVL) aircraft by purchasing AV-8Bs, outfitted with the F-16 Fighting Falcon's APG-66 radar. A Taiwanese purchase would have allowed the production line to stay open beyond 2005. Despite the possibility of leasing AV-8Bs, interest in the aircraft waned as the country switched its intentions to procuring the F-35 and upgrading its fleet of F-16s.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the more}} {{significant}} impacts of containment was {{the outbreak of the}} Korean War. In June 1950, Kim Il-sung's North Korean People's Army invaded South Korea. Stalin approved and sent advisers to plan the North Korean invasion. To Stalin's surprise, the UN Security Council backed the defense of South Korea, though the Soviets were then boycotting meetings in protest <b>that</b> <b>Taiwan</b> and not Communist China held a permanent seat on the Council. A UN force of personnel from South Korea, the United States, the United Kingdom, Turkey, Canada, Colombia, Australia, France, South Africa, the Philippines, the Netherlands, Belgium, New Zealand and other countries joined to stop the invasion.|$|E
5|$|When Ronald Reagan's {{administration}} {{took power}} in 1981, the export restrictions {{put in place}} by the Carter administration were slowly relaxed. At first, the FX program continued as normal, but a number of events eroded the value of the program and limit the F-5G's potential sales. The signing of the 1982 US-PRC Joint Communiqué was a major agreement on arms sales, which continued blocking sales of the F-5G to Taiwan. By this point the Taiwanese had started their own light-fighter project, the AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-kuo. In signing the Communiqué, the U.S. was signaling <b>that</b> <b>Taiwan</b> would not receive modern aircraft, therefore the Ching-kuo became Taiwan's primary focus. As a result, the F-5G's sales potential remained unestablished.|$|E

25|$|The {{position}} of most supporters of Taiwan independence {{is that the}} PRC is the government of China, <b>that</b> <b>Taiwan</b> {{is not part of}} China, and the 'Republic of China (Taiwan)' is an independent, sovereign state. The Democratic Progressive Party states <b>that</b> <b>Taiwan</b> has never been {{under the jurisdiction of the}} PRC, and that the PRC does not exercise any hold over the 23 million Taiwanese on the island. On the other hand, the {{position of}} most Chinese reunification supporters is that the Chinese Civil War is still not concluded as no peace agreement has ever been signed. Therefore, the current political separation across the Taiwan strait is only temporary and a reunified China including both mainland China and Taiwan will be the result.|$|E
25|$|Islam is {{generally}} {{perceived to be}} alien to traditional Chinese culture by the general Taiwanese population despite the fact <b>that</b> <b>Taiwan</b> is a society with freedom of religion and high tolerance. Generally there are no negative perceptions of Islam in Taiwan; additionally, Muslims in Taiwan enjoy complete freedom.|$|E
25|$|The {{opening of}} The Taichung Airport did spark a spat of {{partisan}} controversy about being incomplete and safety concerns were raised.

25|$|In August 2002 the {{government}} adopted Tongyong Pinyin by an administrative order that local governments {{had the authority}} to override within their jurisdiction. In October 2007, with the DPP administration still in power, it was announced <b>that</b> <b>Taiwan</b> would standardize the English transliterations of its Chinese Mandarin place names {{by the end of the}} year, after years of confusion from multiple spellings, by using the locally developed Tongyong Pinyin.|$|E
25|$|However, as of 2016, the {{conflict}} between these two theories still {{plays a role in}} internal Taiwanese politics. The popular sovereignty theory, which the Pan-Green Coalition emphasizes, suggests <b>that</b> <b>Taiwan</b> could make fundamental constitutional changes by means of a popular referendum. The ROC legal theory, which is supported by the Pan-Blue Coalition, suggests that any fundamental constitutional changes would require that the amendment procedure of the ROC constitution be followed.|$|E
25|$|The blue-and-white canton of the ROC flag {{is often}} used as the party flag of the KMT.

At one level, the flag represents a clear symbol <b>that</b> <b>Taiwan</b> is not governed by the same government as Mainland China, as this flag is different from the flag of the People's Republic of China (PRC).|$|E

25|$|The United States {{entered the}} War in December 1941. All {{military}} attacks against Japanese installations and Japanese troops in Taiwan {{were conducted by}} United States military forces.

25|$|During the {{campaign}} for the 2010 general election, candidate and former Prime Minister Francis Billy Hilly announced that, if elected, he would break off relations with the ROC and establish them with the PRC. Dr Tarcisius Tara Kabutaulaka, of the University of Hawaii, commented <b>that</b> <b>Taiwan</b> funded constituency development programmes in the Solomons, and that Members of Parliament were thus unlikely to support any severing of diplomatic relations with the ROC.

25|$|Chen's and the Democratic Progressive Party {{position}} on Taiwan's political status is <b>that</b> <b>Taiwan</b> is already an independent, sovereign nation named the Republic of China. This has {{the implication that}} a declaration of independence is unnecessary as Taiwan is already independent. This view point, however, is subject to change in each election campaign. At the same time, {{it also has the}} implication that the pledge by Chen to preserve the status quo or not change Taiwan's sovereign status would not preclude a declaration of independence but would preclude acceptance of the one China policy.|$|E
25|$|As of March 2012, a {{poll by the}} Global Views Monthly {{indicated}} that support for Taiwanese independence has risen. According to the survey 28.2 percent of respondents {{indicated that}} they support a formal declaration for Taiwan independence, a rise of 3.7 percent compared to a similar poll conducted earlier in 2012. Asked whether Taiwan would eventually declare itself a new and independent nation, 49.1 percent replied yes while 38 percent responded negatively, the Global Views Monthly said. Only 22.9 percent agreed <b>that</b> <b>Taiwan</b> should eventually unify with China, while 63.5 percent disagreed.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{presence}} of the ROC flag in Taiwan also distinguishes the fact <b>that</b> <b>Taiwan</b> and ROC territorial islands elsewhere fall under jurisdiction of a country separate from that of mainland China, the People's Republic of China (PRC). The hoisting of the ROC flag is even advocated by the most extreme Taiwanese independence supporters, such as Taiwan Solidarity Union members when emphasizing the separate and independently governed systems and territories of the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China in mainland China.|$|E

25|$|The {{recordkeeping}} {{and development}} of the economic history of Taiwan started in the Age of Discovery. In the 17th century, the Europeans realized <b>that</b> <b>Taiwan</b> is located on the strategic cusp between the Far East and Southeast Asia. Two main European empires that competed to colonize it were the Dutch and Spanish Empires. Taiwan also became an intermediate destination for trade between Western European empires and East Asia states. The history of Taiwan as a colony of the Dutch Empire, Kingdom of Tungning, Qing China, and Empire of Japan between 1630 and 1945 was based heavily on economics.|$|E
25|$|A two-day {{event of}} {{international}} symposium addressing contemporary challenges facing Muslim minorities {{was held in}} Taipei on 13–14 April 2015. Organized by Muslim World League, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and several non-governmental organizations, the event was attended by participants from more than 20 countries and territories. Speaking at the opening ceremony, Foreign Affairs Minister David Lin said that the symposium represents a confidence by the world Muslim community in the promotion of religious equality by the government. Lin also added <b>that</b> <b>Taiwan</b> has helped the conflicts happening in parts of Iraq and Syria by aiding more than US$8.25 million in assistance, including 350 prefabricated shelters to refugees.|$|E
25|$|The KMT {{took control}} of Taiwan's {{monopolies}} that had been owned by the Japanese prior to World War II. They nationalized approximately 17% of Taiwan's GNP and voided Japanese bond certificates held by Taiwanese investors. These real estate holdings as well as American aid such as the China Aid Act and the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction helped to ensure <b>that</b> <b>Taiwan</b> would recover quickly from war. The Kuomintang government also moved the entire gold reserve from the Chinese mainland to Taiwan, and used this reserve to back the newly issued New Taiwan dollar to stabilize the new currency and {{put a stop to}} hyperinflation.|$|E
