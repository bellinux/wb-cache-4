40|$|In three veins {{from the}} lower part of Deep Sea Drilling Project Hole 504 B, 298 meters below the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>basement,</b> primary augite is {{replaced}} by aegirine-augite. This transformation occurs only in subophitic basalts, at the contact with veins which always include a dark-olive, Mg-rich clay mineral. Talc occurs in one of these veins; it can be regarded either as a vein constituent or as a product of augite alteration. Melanite (Ca,Fe,Ti-rich garnet) appears in only one of these three veins, where a Ca-carbonate is associated with a Mg-rich clay mineral. The occurrence of melanite in Hole 504 B could be due to the conjunction of particular conditions: (1) basalt with a subophitic texture, (2) presence of hydrothermal fluids carrying Ca, Fe, Si, Ti, Al, Mg, and Na, (3) rather high temperatures.

30|$|The second {{thermal profile}} (in Fig.  9) {{is a great}} example of the {{disparity}} in temperature distribution between a region of very low sedimentary cover with no coal (west side) and a region of very thick sedimentary cover (East side—up to 3000  m) with thick Permian coal layers and a very thick Greta coal layer which has extremely insulating thermal conductivities (~[*] 0.3  W/mK). Thermal profile 2 provides a direct correlation between thick sedimentary cover and coal measures, and a shallow 150  °C isotherm. The lack of sedimentary cover {{at the beginning of the}} profile (up to 80  km along the profile line) results in basement heat being refracted up to this low-conductivity pathway. Thermal profile 4 exhibits two comparatively low-temperature geotherms (at 80 and 145  km along the profile line), which correlate with reduced coal thickness and increased distance to <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>basement.</b>|$|E

Again, elevated 150  °C isotherms are associated with both sediment and coal thickness, and distance to the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the <b>basement.</b> The latter effect is a function of both the high concentration of radiogenic elements in the basement rocks, generating significant heat (Blevin et al. 2010), and the relatively high conductivity <b>of</b> crystalline <b>basement.</b>|$|R

Among the data collected, a high-resolution bathymetric dataset aquired on the northwestern slope of the ridge offers some important preliminary insights into the tectonic evolution of the ridge and the adjoining lower continental slopes and ocean basin. The NE-SW trending Walvis Ridge has a trapezoid shape and is likely built up by thick sequences of plateau basalts, with <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>basement</b> rocks inclined to the south. Sediments are almost absent on the NW side of the ridge, preserving a fascinating mountainscape formed early in the tectonic history, most probably on-land. This interpretation is supported by clear denudational features, like steep cliffs up to 150 m high, and deeply incised valleys, defining paleo-drainages.

40|$|The Gunnedah Basin in New South Wales {{has long}} been an {{important}} coal and gas resource, but limited information exists on the temperature structure or crustal architecture at depth to enable development of its geothermal potential. Here we combine gravity modelling, seismic-reflection surveys and borehole drilling results to develop a 3 D depth to basement structural map and geological model of the basin. The 3 D structure of the Gunnedah Basin is characteristic of a typical intracontinental rift basin. Gravity modelling of the Lachlan Fold Belt basement, using borehole and seismic-reflection controls, shows a 2 - 3. 5 km-deep approximately north-south-oriented channel between the basement highs of the Rocky Glen Ridge in the west and Boggabri Ridge in the east. Extensional basal volcanics during the Late Carboniferous-Early Permian fill this channel.

It consists of four major geomorphological units, which are associated with multiple phases of volcanic activity between 140 Ma and 120 Ma. This project tries to decipher the gradual development of the Mozambique Ridge as well as its role within the break-up of Gondwana. In order to address these open questions high-resolution seismic reflection data was gathered during cruise SO- 232 with RV Sonne. 	 Seismic reflection data reveals various magmatic centres and intra-basement reflections that extend up to several hundred ms TWT below <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>basement.</b> Such massive flows are characteristic of oceanic plateau eruptions. Primary volcanic features associated with the formation of the different segments of the MozR can be identified and separated from secondary volcanic features, indicating magmatic reactivation after its initial build-up. The internal reflections generally dip away from their magmatic centres and individual reflectors are typically traced 5 - 15 km. Various faults cutting through basement and sedimentary units are interpreted as extensional tectonic features. These observations imply that MozR is of LIP origin and underwent multiple magmatic and tectonic phases during its development.

The three packages are greatly varying in lithology, depositional environment, hydrocarbon accumulations, {{as well as its}} thickness and areal distribution. The previous works indicate that the southern portion of the gulf is dominated by tilted-basement blocks and NE–SW offset linear highs; meanwhile, the central and northern parts of the gulf comprise several elongated depositional basins. Numerous geophysical studies were carried out to detect the most probable locations for the structural and stratigraphic traps. The deep structural highs on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>basement</b> surface are focal points to determine the oil accumulations within the sedimentary basins. The pre-Miocene uplifts were put into focus as the main sources of potentiality in the Gulf of Suez. Unfortunately, seismic has no efficiency to well explore/reach such deep-seated structures. Contrary, it is found that gravity interpretation by stripping is more effective to reveal the deeper constituents of interest. It calculates the gravity effect of shallow sources/structures of known densities and geometries, where the removal of such shallow gravity effects may lead to show the gravity effects resulted from the deep-seated disturbances in the subsurface. Therefore, the gravity stripping is more accurate and reliable than the mathematical filtering or separation methods, since the filtered maps contain false anomalies with inaccurate amplitudes.|$|E

40|$|We {{construct}} a three-dimensional P wave velocity {{model of the}} southern California crust by combining existing one-dimensional models, each describing a region defined by surface geology, and calibrate the model with travel times from three explosions. The model is expressed as blocks, each of a given slowness. The variance of the P wave travel time residuals of ≈ 1000 earthquakes relocated in and near the Los Angeles basin, where the model is most detailed, is half that of the catalog locations in the standard one-dimensional model for southern California. Starting from the forward model, we invert ≈ 21, 000 P wave arrivals from earthquakes for hypocenters and block slownesses using the technique of Roecker (1981). The variance of these P wave travel time residuals decreases 47 % during the inversion. Many of the blocks representing the upper crust and midcrust are well sampled and well resolved. The resulting model is useful both for locating earthquakes and for comparing the geologies of the different regions. For example, the velocity structure of the Los Angeles basin represents seismically slow sediments on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>basement</b> rocks having velocities similar to the granitic rocks under the Peninsular Ranges. Moho is between 26 and 32 km depth. In contrast, the Ventura basin has mostly slower sediments above a deeper, higher-velocity basement.

40|$|International audienceThe Gulf of Corinth (GOC), Greece is {{a rapidly}} extending, active {{continental}} rift {{with a record}} of large, damaging earthquakes. An extensive multichannel seismic (MCS) survey of the GOC conducted in 2001 provided, in addition to the processed MCS images, the opportunity to constrain velocity structure using refracted arrivals recorded along a 6 -km-long streamer. We use first-arrival traveltimes to derive tomographic P-wave velocity models for several profiles collected in the central portion of the GOC. Eight of the profiles are closely spaced, north– south lines crossing the GOC and extending into the Gulf of Itea (GOI); a ninth profile is an east–west-oriented tie line. The N–S profiles image the relatively simple velocity structure of the deep Corinth rift basin and more complicated structure of the northern margin of the currently active rift. Integration of the velocity models with migrated MCS sections shows that south of the GOI the basement, which comprises Mesozoic nappes, occurs at a velocity of 4. 5 km s − 1 in the velocity models, although the actual velocity at, or just below, the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>basement</b> is probably closer to 5 – 5. 5 km s − 1.

40|$|Secondary {{minerals}} filling {{veins and}} vesicles in volcanic basement at Deep Sea Drilling Project Sites 458 and 459 {{indicate that there}} were two stages of alteration at each site: an early oxidative, probably hydrothermal, stage and a later, low-temperature, less oxidative stage, probably contemporaneous with faulting in the tectonically active Mariana forearc region. The initial stage is most evident in Hole 459 B, where low-Al, high Fe smectites and iron hydroxides formed in vesicles in pillow basalts and low-Al palygorskite formed in fractures. Iron hydroxides and celadonite formed in massive basalts next to quartz-oligoclase micrographic intergrowths. Palygorskite was found in only one sample near the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>basement</b> in Hole 458, but it too is associated with iron hydroxides. Palygorskite has previously been reported only in marine sediments in DSDP and other occurrences. It evidently formed here as a precipitate from fluids in which Si, Mg, Fe, and even some Al were concentrated. Experimental data suggest that the solutions probably had high pH and somewhat elevated temperatures. The compositions of associated smectites resemble those in hydrothermal sediments and in basalts at the Galapagos mounds geothermal field. The second stage of alteration was large-scale replacement of basalt by dioctahedral, trioctahedral, or mixed-layer clays and phillipsite along zones of intense fracturing, especially near the bottom of Holes 458 and 459 B. The basalts are commonly slickensided, and there are recemented microfault offsets in overlying sediments. Native copper occurs in one core of Hole 458, but associated smectites are dominantly dioctahedral, unlike Hole 459 B, where they are mainly trioctahedral, indicating nonoxidative alteration. The alteration in both holes is more intense than at most DSDP ocean crust sites and may have been augmented by water derived from subducting ocean crust beneath the fore-arc region...|$|E

The basal decollement under the Sulaiman lobe lies either in ductile Eocambrian salt, or within a deep zone of other material that undergoes ductile behavior. Near the deformation front, ramps from the basal detachment become flats in lower Triassic and lower Cretaceous shales. A steep and highly elevated zone immediately to the west of frontal folds is interpreted to be underlain by a passive-roof duplex. The culmination wall of this oblique duplex is separated from the overlying roof sequence by a passive-roof thrust in lower Cretaceous shales. The roof-thrust has a back-thrust sense of movement, relative to the forelandward propagating duplex, and may extend obliquely 100 km into the interior of the foldbelt. Fault-propagation and fault-bend folds are present in the frontal portion of the eastern Sulaiman foldbelt. Palinspastic restoration of a balanced cross-section shows 108 km of shortening in the eastern Sulaiman foldbelt east of the Kingri strike-slip fault. The presence of more than 11 km of pre-Neogene strata on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>basement</b> suggests that the Mesozoic rifted margin of the Indian subcontinent may lie beneath the Sulaiman foldbelt. This interpretation is also favored by the presence of ophiolites and flysch deposits overthrusted on late Cretaceous shelf strata...|$|E
50|$|The rock {{underlying}} the Appalachian Plateau {{consists of a}} base of Precambrian rock, overlain by sedimentary rock from the Paleozoic Era. On <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the <b>basement</b> is a thick layer, approximately 20,000 feet, of a mixture of Cambrian, Ordovician, and Middle Silurian rock. This rock consists of shale, siltstone, and sandstone. Above this layer is the Upper Silurian evaporate basin, or basin of chemically formed sedimentary rocks. The Plateau fold belt consists of structurally complex Paleozoic strata which were thrust faulted over the younger evaporates.|$|R
30|$|The {{alteration}} minerals’ {{distribution in}} the GRT- 2 granitic section (2490 – 3196  m MD, 2165 – 2707  m TVD) is characterized by secondary geodic quartz that is well expressed from the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the granite at 2490  m MD down to 2878  m MD and particularly in two zones at 2950  m MD (2527  m TVD) and 3052  m MD (2604  m TVD) (Fig.  2). Anhydrite precipitation is visible at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the <b>basement</b> to 2653  m MD (2292  m TVD) and from 2737 to 2875  m MD (2358 – 2469  m TVD) but is not visible in the deepest part of the well. Chlorite is ubiquitous in the GRT- 2 borehole but is more concentrated in three zones: 2590 – 2734  m MD (2243 – 2356  m TVD), 2872 – 2935  m MD (2466 – 2515  m TVD), and 3073 – 3196  m MD (2620 – 2707  m TVD). The first and second chlorite zones contain relics of primary biotite that are partially chloritized, precisely corresponding to the HMOD facies, and are thus correlated with hydrothermal alteration. The third chlorite zone contains chloritized biotite that is clearly correlated with the GRAN facies, reflecting propylitic alteration. The illite content is very high at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the granitic <b>basement</b> and decreases down to the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the unaltered granite (3060  m MD, 2610  m TVD), wherein {{there is no significant}} trace of illitic material in the cuttings. The oxidation is important in the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the granitic <b>basement,</b> defining the RED facies unit, but decreases down to 2986  m MD (2955  m TVD). Calcite was measured in high quantities, with especially high values of 40 % at 3052  m MD (2604  m TVD), 20 % at 3000  m MD (2565  m TVD), and approximately 10 % at 2570 and 3052  m MD (2228 and 2604  m TVD) (Fig.  2).|$|R
30|$|The 150  °C {{isotherm}} is elevated beneath thick coal measures, {{as demonstrated}} in Fig.  9. However, another significant effect is {{the thickness of the}} basin sediments and the relative depth to the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the <b>basement.</b> Profile 5 has especially high geotherm temperatures beneath the coal (600  m beneath surface) at 140  km along the profile line, where the Greta coal measure is at its thickest (approximately[*]~[*] 750  m thick). This thermal anomaly is directly caused by the presence of insulating coal, where the temperature profile is otherwise relatively linear.|$|R
