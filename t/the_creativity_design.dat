In early conceptual design process, designers used large number of sketches and drawings (Purcell and Gero, 1998). The sketch can inspire the designer to increase <b>the</b> <b>creativity</b> of <b>the</b> designeris creations(Schenk, 1991, Goldschmidt, 1994, Suwa and Tversky, 1997). The freehand sketches by conventional media have been believed to play important roles in processes of the creative design thinking(Goldschmidt, 1991, Schon and Wiggins, 1992, Goel, 1995, Suwa et al., 2000, Verstijnen et al., 1998, Elsas van and Vergeest, 1998).

40|$|AbstractThe {{last decade}} {{has seen a}} {{remarkable}} uptake of interactive systems, products and services. Their design requires a shift from the traditional skills of material product-focused designers. We argue that <b>the</b> <b>creativity</b> in <b>designing</b> these information-enriched products needs to stress both physical properties and interactivity. The challenge is finding an educational approach that can equip industrial design graduates with stronger creativity instead of overstating the awareness of new technologies. This approach should extend rather than replace the knowledge, skills and experience from traditional design education. Using Monash University as the test bed, Tangible Interaction Design Education (TIDE), the cornerstone of this pedagogical model, provides an approach that blurs the boundaries between tangible objects and intangible services...|$|R

We review the evolution of definitions of creativity, leading to our proposal of a unified definition, we present a theoretical account of why social creativity should in principle be more productive than individual creativity.

40|$|Abstract. Design is a ubiquitous, {{collaborative}} {{and highly}} material activity. Because of the embodied {{nature of the}} design profession, designers apply certain collaborative practices to enhance creativity in their everyday work. Within the domain of industrial design, we studied two educational design departments {{over a period of}} eight months. Using examples from our fieldwork, we develop our results around three broad themes related to collaborative practices that support <b>the</b> <b>creativity</b> of <b>design</b> professionals: 1) externalization, 2) use of physical space, and 3) use of bodies.

40|$|We {{question}} <b>the</b> <b>creativity</b> in <b>design</b> through <b>the</b> {{experience of}} drawing. The drawing ensuring <b>the</b> <b>creativity</b> and innovation {{of the design}} as a productive activity in connection with action and social thought. We start from some following questions: How can the process of drawing be able to represent <b>the</b> <b>creativity</b> of <b>the</b> subject in design? How can drawing presents the symbolic affirmation in the social dimension? It must be the recognition of belonging [...] . and consequently the ability to act in accordance with [...] . Design has always a mode of desire of perpetuation of the artefact, as an artificial reality that exists to perpetuate {{the effectiveness of the}} natural one. Since the time of its Greek origins drawing claimed the idea of foundation, a way of sustention as representation of the world. In this sense drawing has symbolically been the sign of perpetuation through the parts that wish the harmony of the whole. Drawing represents the commitment of the artificial - the representation of the world - with the natural reality. Design makes use of drawing and con-fused to it as a symbolic sustenance beyond a determination of the project, it reveals itself internally to express itself external through technique. The research seeks to consider scientific analysis of design ontologically with case studies. We propose theoretically the experience of drawing, particularly in relation with <b>the</b> project. <b>The</b> <b>creativity</b> in <b>design</b> is possible through the drawing operating, technically, as a territory of procedural experience and, symbolically, through its content of truth. The design used drawing to project the idea and carry out the work, symbolically, to a specific cultural identity.

We interpret the object of design through <b>the</b> management of <b>creativity,</b> using drawing as strategy of innovation. We start from the different perspective of the concepts ‘innovation’ and ‘creativity’ (diagram 1) to approach a strategy of innovation in the project of design (diagram 2).
