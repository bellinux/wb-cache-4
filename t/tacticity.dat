50|$|Chain {{shuttling}} polymerization {{makes use}} of two catalysts and a chain shuttling agent (CSA) to generate copolymers of alternating <b>tacticity.</b> Catalyst 1 (Cat1) propagates a polyolefin of a desired <b>tacticity.</b> Catalyst 2 (Cat2) generates another chain of a different <b>tacticity.</b> The two chains are allowed to co-propagate in a single reactor in the same living polymer fashion as before. To alternate the <b>tacticity,</b> a CSA will transfer the polymer chain from its respective catalyst. The CSA can then bind to Cat2 and attach the chain to Cat2. When the chain attaches to Cat2, the polymerization of that chain continues, except it now propagates with the <b>tacticity</b> dictated by Cat2, not Cat1. The general {{result is that the}} chain will alternate between two different tacticities. As the forward and reverse reactions occur, the polymer chain is “shuttled” {{back and forth between the}} two catalysts and a block copolymer is formed.The shuttling of chains back and forth from catalysts via a CSA can be viewed as a competing chemical equilibrium. Note that the forward and reverse reactions of CSA binding and leaving either Cat1 or Cat2 are possible. This competition means that a chain can leave Cat1 via a CSA and the reattach to Cat1, polymerizing the same <b>tacticity.</b> The rate at which the reattachment of Cat1 occurs can be controlled by altering the relative concentrations of Cat1, Cat2 and CSA. For example, if one wanted to produce a polymer with the properties mainly resulting from the use of Cat1 and only wanted to influence its properties slightly by the presence of Cat2, a greater concentration of Cat1 would be used than for Cat2. The rate of alternation between <b>tacticity</b> can be controlled by altering the concentration of CSA relative to Cat1 and Cat2; having a higher concentration of CSA means that the chains will shuttle back and forth more rapidly, creating shorter units of alternating <b>tacticity.</b>|$|E

In this overview, after briefly surveying general considerations associated to the ROP of b-lactones and metal-based catalysts used in stereoselective ROP of racemic b-butyrolactone, special emphasis is given to discrete rare earth catalysts that have allowed the preparation of highly syndiotactic poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate) s.

40|$|Sequence, which Nature uses to {{spectacular}} advantage, has {{not been}} fully exploited in synthetic copolymers. To investigate the effect of sequence and stereosequence on the physical properties of copolymers a family of complex isotactic, syndiotactic and atactic repeating sequence poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) copolymers (RSC PLGAs) were prepared and their NMR and thermal behavior was studied. The unique suitability of polymers prepared from the bioassimilable lactic and glycolic acid monomers for biomedical applications makes them ideal candidates {{for this type of}} sequence engineering. Polymers with repeating units of LG, GLG, LLG, LLLG and GLLG (L = lactic, G = glycolic) with controlled and varied <b>tacticities</b> were synthesized by assembly of the corresponding sequence specific, stereopure dimeric, trimeric, tetrameric and hexameric segmer units. Specifically labeled deuterated lactic and glycolic acid segmers were likewise prepared and polymerized. Although the effects of sequence-influenced solution conformation were visible in all resonances of the 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra, the diastereotopic methylene resonances in the 1 H NMR (CDCl 3) for the glycolic units of the copolymers proved most sensitive. An octad level of resolution, which corresponds to an astounding 31 -atom distance between the most separated stereocenters, was observed in some mixed sequence polymers. Importantly, the level of sensitivity of a particular NMR resonance to small differences in sequence was found to depend on the sequence itself. Thermal properties were also correlated with sequence. 	Functionalized RSC PLGAs were also prepared by the introduction of a benzyl-ether substituted monomer, (S) - 3 -benzyloxy- 2 -hydroxypropionic acid, derived from serine. A series of dimeric and trimeric based copolymers were assembled with controlled and varied <b>tacticities</b> as well as a sequenced heptamer and decamer copolymer. Deprotection of the hydroxyl groups was accomplished by catalytic hydrogenolysis to yield highly functionalized, hydrophobic polyesters.
