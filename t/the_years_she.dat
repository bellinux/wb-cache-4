5|$|Beyoncé Knowles is {{not worried}} chasing fads, {{though she is}} well aware of them. Over <b>the</b> <b>years,</b> <b>she</b> has learned how to harness them so {{effortlessly}} that they seem like her ideas. Take the standout track on her new album, 4, 'I Miss You', a slow-burn jam of desire co-written by Odd Future-affiliated crooner Frank Ocean. In its beginning moments, the song draws on the sparse wave of recent music by British band The xx by using silence as a weapon, a notion that extends across the 12-song album.|$|E
5|$|In Anurag Kashyap's period crime drama Bombay Velvet (2015), (based on the {{historian}} Gyan Prakash's book Mumbai Fables) co-starring Ranbir Kapoor and Karan Johar, Sharma {{was cast in}} the role of a jazz singer, Rosie Noronha. Her character was referenced from yesteryear stars like Brigitte Bardot, Helen and Waheeda Rehman. As part of her preparation, Sharma watched a lot of films of the 1950s and 1960s, as well as a documentary showing the development of hair and make-up over <b>the</b> <b>years.</b> <b>She</b> also revealed to have used temporary lip enhancers as a part of her make up in the film, citing it as the reason behind her changed appearance on a chat show in 2014, and refuting media speculations about her having undergone plastic surgery. Bombay Velvet was screened at the Locarno and Bucheon film festivals, but critical reviews on it were mixed.|$|E
5|$|Over <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>she</b> entered some failed {{business}} ventures, {{including in}} 1988 a perfume named Woman (after the 1980 John Lennon song) and, in April 1989, a restaurant named Lennon's—at 13/14 Upper St. Martin's Lane, Covent Garden—which had menu {{items such as}} Rubber Sole (a play on the already-punning 1965 Beatles album), as well as Sgt. Pepper's Steak and Penny Lane Pâté. It had a short life as a business venture, as it {{was considered to be}} far too expensive. She would later blame some of these efforts on the men in her life encouraging her.|$|E

25|$|She {{also had}} a talent for photography: she left an {{intriguing}} photographic archive from <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>she</b> spent living in Moscow during the 1930s and 40s. The archive is the more remarkable because it concerns a time and places where, for both economic and political reasons, very few people would have had access to photographic equipment.|$|E

25|$|Starting in 1968, Saint Phalle sold Nana {{inflatable}} pool toys, amid {{criticism from}} the art world. She ignored the complaints, focusing on raising money for her future monumental projects. In the coming years, she would face more criticism for over-commercializing and popularizing her artwork, but she raised significant funding that enabled her to finance several ambitious projects on her own. Over <b>the</b> <b>years,</b> <b>she</b> produced clothing, jewelry, perfume, glass or porcelain figures, furniture, and craft items, many with a Nana theme.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, she {{produced}} a maquette for Le Temple Idéal (The Ideal Temple), {{a place of}} worship welcoming all religions, {{in response to the}} religious intolerance she saw while working in Jerusalem. The city of Nîmes (France) commissioned her to build the architectural sculpture, but the project never was built, due to politics. Over <b>the</b> <b>years,</b> <b>she</b> had become interested in myths and religious traditions beyond her childhood Roman Catholic upbringing, including Jewish, Hindu, Buddhist, and ancient Egyptian beliefs.|$|E
25|$|In July 1896, it was {{reported}} that Kate had applied to the Iowa legislature for employment in the State House as a menial because she was destitute and had to support her mother and invalid brother. She worked at the Iowa State Capitol more than once, but the rumor of an invalid brother was untrue, as John, her surviving one, worked for the Chicago and North Western Railway for most of his life. Ongoing reports that her mother was an invalid or was in ill health, requiring constant care, were also refuted over <b>the</b> <b>years.</b> <b>She</b> died in 1909.|$|E

25|$|In 1821, the Intendant of the Royal Navy of Goa, Cândido José Mourão Garcez Palha, {{proposed}} to the Portuguese government {{the construction of}} a new frigate in the Portuguese colony of Daman, who possessed to the east a large forest of teak wood in Nagar-Aveli, considered to be an excellent wood for ship building. The authorization for the construction was given in 1824, by the Portuguese king João VI. The civil war period and the political and economical problems in Portugal, delayed the construction for several times throughout <b>the</b> <b>years.</b> <b>She</b> was built in the Shipyards of the Royal Navy Arsenal under the supervision of the naval builder engineer Gil José da Conceição, being involved in its construction both Portuguese and Indian workers. She was finally launched in 1843, and towed to Goa for fitting out as a full-rigged ship.|$|E

500|$|On March 31, 1978, {{after the}} Maximum Security Unit at Alderson was closed, Shakur was {{transferred}} to the Clinton Correctional Facility for Women in New Jersey. According to her attorney Lennox Hinds, Shakur [...] "understates the awfulness of the condition in which she was incarcerated", which included vaginal and anal searches. Hinds argues that [...] "in the history of New Jersey, no woman pretrial detainee or prisoner has ever been treated as she was, continuously confined in a men's prison, under twenty-four-hour surveillance of her most intimate functions, without intellectual sustenance, adequate medical attention, and exercise, and without the company of other women for all <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>she</b> was in custody".|$|E

I'm not trying to gain new fans. I love the fans I already have, and this is for them." ...|$|E
