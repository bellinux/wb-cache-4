"'I, who am {{the most}} ancient man in Zululand, dwell with the spirits of my fathers, who will not suffer strangers to come nigh them and who, if they are offended, will bring great woes upon the land. Moreover, I have sworn that {{while there is a}} king in Zululand and I draw the breath of life, never again will I set foot in a royal kraal, because when last I did so at the slaying of the witch, Mameena, the king who is dead thought it well <b>to</b> <b>utter</b> <b>threats</b> against me, and never more will I, the Opener of Roads, be {{threatened}} by a mortal. Therefore if the King and his Council seek to drink of the water of my wisdom, it must be in the place and hour of my own choosing. If this cannot be, let me abide here in my house and let the King seek light from other doctors, since mine shall remain as a lamp to my own heart.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Precisely," [...] said Kennedy. [...] "She is very passive. It's {{enough to}} look at the red hands hanging at the end of those short arms, at those slow, {{prominent}} brown eyes, to know the inertness of her mind--an inertness that one would think made it everlastingly safe from all the surprises of imagination. And yet which of us is safe? At any rate, such as you see her, she had enough imagination to fall in love. She's the daughter of one Isaac Foster, who from a small farmer has sunk into a shepherd; the beginning of his misfortunes dating from his runaway marriage with the cook of his widowed father--a well-to-do, apoplectic grazier, who passionately struck his name off his will, and had been heard <b>to</b> <b>utter</b> <b>threats</b> against his life. But this old affair, scandalous enough to serve as a motive for a Greek tragedy, arose from the similarity of their characters. There are other tragedies, less scandalous and of a subtler poignancy, arising from irreconcilable differences and from that fear of the Incomprehensible that hangs over all our heads--over all our heads...." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{midshipman}} {{seemed to}} be the last man on board whose natural disposition would lead him <b>to</b> <b>utter</b> such a <b>threat,</b> and Quintal was quite taken aback; but as Young was a powerful fellow, perfectly capable of carrying his threat into execution, and seemed, moreover, thoroughly roused, the former thought it best to hold his tongue, even though lugubrious Isaac Martin chuckled audibly, and Ohoo, one of the natives, who stood near, displayed his fine teeth from ear to ear.|$|R
60|$|As, therefore, {{it seemed}} tolerably {{certain that the}} men on board the lugger had escaped, the death of Kennedy, if he fell in {{with them in the}} woods, when irritated by the loss of their vessel and by the share he had in it, was easily to be {{accounted}} for. And it was not improbable that to such brutal tempers, rendered desperate by their own circumstances, even the murder of the child, against whose father, as having become suddenly active in the prosecution of smugglers, Hatteraick was known <b>to</b> have <b>uttered</b> deep <b>threats,</b> would not appear a very heinous crime.|$|R
60|$|For {{some days}} an active search was maintained, but no trace was {{discovered}} of Julian Wyatt, {{or of the}} man whom he had followed. From inquiries that had been instituted in the town, the chief constable had learned that the man Markham, who had {{a few weeks before}} returned after serving out his sentence for poaching in Mr. Faulkner's preserves, had disappeared from his lodgings {{on the day of the}} murder and had not returned. As he was known <b>to</b> have <b>uttered</b> many <b>threats</b> against the magistrate, a warrant was issued for his arrest on the day after the coroner's jury, having heard the whole of the evidence, brought in a verdict that Mr. Faulkner had been wilfully murdered by a person or persons unknown.|$|R
40|$|An {{alarming}} {{number of}} women are in abusive relationships where violence and threats of violence pervade their lives. This article examines the offence of <b>uttering</b> <b>threats</b> in the Canadian Criminal Code, using the Manitoba Court of Appeal decision in R v O’Brien as a backdrop. We make two arguments. First, we argue that, in intimate relationships, threats of death and bodily harm are a form of domestic violence, often used by men in concert with physical violence {{and other forms of}} intimidation to control and dominate women. The Canadian criminal justice response <b>to</b> charges of <b>uttering</b> <b>threats</b> in intimate partner relationships must fully account for the cumulative, ongoing and dynamic nature of abuse, as well as abused women’s complex and varied responses to abuse. Second, we examine the history of s. 264. 1 of the Criminal Code and the case law to argue that the courts have applied the elements of the offence improperly and {{in a manner that is}} inconsistent with the statutory language and legislative intent. In so doing, the judgments incorrectly burden abused women with testifying to their fear in response to threats by their abusers, despite the fact that such evidence is unnecessary to prove the offence. This error reflects the continued privatization of domestic abuse and violence against women more generally. Compelling abused women to testify to their fear risks exposing women to increased physical violence and threats and ignores the complex considerations which drive abused women’s decision to co-operate in the prosecution of their partners or to support their defence...|$|R
50|$|Although he {{originally}} targeted women either {{alone in}} their homes or with children, he later came to prefer attacking couples instead. His standard procedure was to break in and awaken the occupants, threatening them with a handgun. Victims were generally bound with ligatures that the criminal brought to the crime scene, often blindfolding and/or gagging them with towels taken from the residence that he had carefully cut into strips. The female victim was made to tie up her male companion with bootlaces before being tied up herself. In many cases, these bindings were made so tightly that the victims had no feeling in their hands for hours after they were untied. He would then separate the couple, often stacking dishes {{on the back of}} the male, and telling him that if he heard the dishes rattle he would kill everyone in the house. The intruder at times spent hours in the home, ransacking closets and drawers, eating food in the kitchen, and coming back <b>to</b> <b>utter</b> more <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> the victims, who were often unsure as to whether he was still in the home. The perpetrator was believed to use a bicycle to travel to and from his car, and also made extensive use of parks, school yards, creek beds, and other open spaces that allowed him to stay off the street.|$|R

"The Saxon porker," [...] he said, [...] "is either asleep or minds me not--Prick {{him with}} your lance, De Bracy," [...] {{speaking}} to a knight who rode near him, {{the leader of a}} band of Free Companions, or Condottieri; that is, of mercenaries belonging to no particular nation, but attached for the time to any prince by whom they were paid. There was a murmur even among the attendants of Prince John; but De Bracy, whose profession freed him from all scruples, extended his long lance over the space which separated the gallery from the lists, and would have executed the commands of the Prince before Athelstane the Unready had recovered presence of mind sufficient even to draw back his person from the weapon, had not Cedric, as prompt as his companion was tardy, unsheathed, with the speed of lightning, the short sword which he wore, and at a single blow severed the point of the lance from the handle. The blood rushed into the countenance of Prince John. He swore one of his deepest oaths, and was about <b>to</b> <b>utter</b> some <b>threat</b> corresponding in violence, when he was diverted from his purpose, partly by his own attendants, who gathered around him conjuring him to be patient, partly by a general exclamation of the crowd, uttered in loud applause of the spirited conduct of Cedric. The Prince rolled his eyes in indignation, as if to collect some safe and easy victim; and chancing to encounter the firm glance of the same archer whom we have already noticed, and who seemed to persist in his gesture of applause, in spite of the frowning aspect which the Prince bent upon him, he demanded his reason for clamouring thus.|$|R

5000|$|Marcello soon {{returned}} to the United States. Undercover informants reported that Marcello made several threats against John F. Kennedy, at one time uttering the traditional Sicilian death threat/curse, [...] "Take the stone from my shoe." [...] This claim is disputed; {{some of those who}} knew him suggested that Marcello did not know enough Italian <b>to</b> <b>utter</b> such a <b>threat.</b> In September 1962, he told private investigator Edward Becker that a dog will continue to bite you if you cut off its tail (meaning Attorney General Robert Kennedy). Whereas if you cut off the dog's head (meaning President Kennedy), it would cease to cause trouble. Becker reported that Marcello [...] "clearly stated {{that he was going to}} arrange to have President Kennedy killed in some way." [...] Marcello told another informant that he would need to take out [...] "insurance" [...] for the assassination by [...] "setting up some nut to take the fall for the job, just like they do in Sicily." [...] It should be noted that at this time, Lee Harvey Oswald, a former Marine who had defected to the Soviet Union and lived there as an expatriate before returning to the United States, was routinely seen in the French Quarter of New Orleans distributing communist materials. It is believed by many that Oswald was selected due to his former ties to the Soviet Union, so that the FBI would quickly end the investigation of Kennedy's assassination rather than allow Oswald's connections to the Soviet Union grow into a conspiracy theory that the Soviet Union had some involvement in the assassination risking rising hostilities during the cold war.|$|R
