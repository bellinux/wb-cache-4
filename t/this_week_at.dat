500|$|Since airing, the {{installment}} {{has received}} mixed to generally positive reviews. In his review for IGN, contributor Colin Moriarty presented mixed feelings toward the episode, saying that, for the show, [...] "perhaps there's {{light at the}} end of the tunnel after all". He considered the episode to have [...] "dropped in posthaste behind Monk", but that it [...] "didn't have its usual negative connotation <b>this</b> <b>week...</b> <b>at</b> least, not in full force". Moriarty stated that the [...] "show seemed to take an interesting and much-desired turn for the better". He considered the show to be moving away from being predictable, but that its [...] "stride is below average". Moriarty considered the episode to be more intriguing, and that the characters were developed quite well, especially that of Gus. He continued to question whether the show would be able to last more than one season, but considered the show to be becoming better developed. Moriarty praised two scenes in the episode, Shawn and Gus' conversation on the way to the graveyard and Shawn snooping in the police file room, as being the funniest of the episode. The installment was given a rating of 7, or [...] "good", making it an improvement over the previous two episodes, [...] "Spellingg Bee" [...] and [...] "Speak Now or Forever Hold Your Piece", as well as tying it for the highest rated episode of the season at the time.|$|E
500|$|Television critics {{reacted with}} mixed {{reaction}} toward the episode, with one critic calling the storyline [...] "pretty dull." [...] In a simultaneous {{review of the}} episodes of American Dad!, The Simpsons and Bob's Burgers that preceded the show, and the episode of The Cleveland Show that followed it, The A.V. Clubs Rowan Kaiser wrote, [...] "I don't {{have much to say}} about tonight's Family Guy. Last week, we had some comments about how Family Guy seems to be willing to play with its format this season. That didn't happen <b>this</b> <b>week</b> <b>at</b> all." [...] Kaiser went on to criticize the flashback involving Lois and Joyce in high school, stating, [...] "Having a previously unknown flashback as the big reveal feels like cheating, if you're inclined to view Family Guy as consistent." [...] He concluded his review by praising [...] "the burning bush" [...] joke, and ultimately gave the episode a C- rating, the worst rating of the night. It was beaten by the American Dad! episode [...] "Fart-Break Hotel", The Cleveland Show episode [...] "How Do You Solve a Problem Like Roberta?", The Simpsons episode [...] "Flaming Moe", and the Bob's Burgers episode [...] "Crawl Space". In a slightly more positive review of the episode, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised the episode for some of its [...] "silly side jokes," [...] but felt disappointed by the ending to the show, commenting, [...] "it didn't follow any real logic [...] It was an easy way out, as if they'd written themselves into a corner." [...] Hughes also criticized the episode for its dependence on cutaway gags, writing, [...] "at least there were some funnier moments in this one. Unfortunately, a lot of those came in the cutaways. And I thought we were starting to move away from a dependence on them." [...] Hughes went on to comment that he felt confused by Stewie possibly being fathered by a porn star, adding that [...] "it would be far more likely that Chris or Meg was fathered by the porn star." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{building}} {{was constructed in}} 1896 for G.W. Stauffer by Fred Harvey Seymour and later {{became known as the}} [...] "Graham Building". From 1896–1915 {{the first floor of the}} building housed a tavern while the second floor contained an apartment. On October 1, 1906 Jack and Nelle Reagan moved into the apartment above the tavern. The Reagans had two sons while they lived in the apartment. In 1908, [...] they had their first son, John Neil Reagan. Their second son, Ronald Wilson Reagan, was born on February 6, 1911 inside the second floor apartment. Family legend has it that when Jack first saw his ten-pound baby son, he said, “He looks like a fat little Dutchman. But who knows, he might grow up to be president some day.” [...] In a small town like Tampico in 1911, a new baby was such big news that four days after the birth the Tampico Tornado newspaper printed the rather unusual birth announcement that read, “February 10, 1911 [...] John REAGAN has been calling thirty-seven inches a yard and giving seventeen ounces for a pound <b>this</b> <b>week</b> <b>at</b> PITNEY’s store, he has been feeling so jubilant over the arrival of a ten pound boy Monday.” ...|$|E

Lord Treasurer and the Secretary thought to mortify me; for {{they told me they}} had been talking a great deal of me to-day to the Queen, and she said she had never heard of me. I told them that was their fault, and not hers, etc., and so we laughed. I dined with the Secretary, and let him go to London at five without me; and here am I alone in the Prebendary's house, which Mr. Secretary has taken; only Mr. Lewis is in my neighbourhood, and we shall be good company. The Vice-Chamberlain,(16) and Mr. Masham, and the Green Cloth,(17) have promised me dinners. I shall want but four till Mr. Secretary returns. We have a music-meeting in our town to-night. I went to the rehearsal of it, and there was Margarita,(18) and her sister, and another drab, and a parcel of fiddlers: I was weary, and would not go to the meeting, which I am sorry for, because I heard it was a great assembly.
