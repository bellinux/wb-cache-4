While the outside of the capsule was expected to receive a dosage of around 500 röntgens, the study concluded that shielding and the effect of the spacecraft structure would reduce this to around 8 röntgens experienced by the astronaut, well within established <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because rodents are a {{nuisance}} and endanger public health, human societies often {{attempt to control}} them. Traditionally, this involved poisoning and trapping, methods that were not always safe or effective. More recently, integrated pest management attempts to improve control {{with a combination of}} surveys to determine the size and distribution of the pest population, the establishment of <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> (levels of pest activity at which to intervene), interventions, and evaluation of effectiveness based on repeated surveys. Interventions may include education, making and applying laws and regulations, modifying the habitat, changing farming practices, and biological control using pathogens or predators, as well as poisoning and trapping. The use of pathogens such as Salmonella has the drawback that they can infect man and domestic animals, and rodents often become resistant. The use of predators including ferrets, mongooses and monitor lizards has been found unsatisfactory. Domestic and feral cats are able to control rodents effectively, provided the rodent population is not too large. In the UK, two species in particular, the house mouse and the brown rat, are actively controlled to limit damage in growing crops, loss and contamination of stored crops and structural damage to facilities, as well as to comply with the law.|$|E

40|$|The {{incidence}} of contamination of aflatoxin M 1 (AFM 1) in milk samples {{collected from the}} Jordanian market was investigated by using the competitive enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique. A total of 175 samples were collected during 2014 - 2015. All tested samples were contaminated with various levels of AFM 1 ranging from 9. 71 to 288. 68 ng/kg. The concentration of AFM 1 in 66 % of fresh milk samples was higher than the maximum <b>tolerance</b> <b>limit</b> accepted by the European Union (50 ng/kg) and 23 % higher than the maximum <b>tolerance</b> <b>limit</b> accepted by the US (500 ng/kg).

25|$|Sphagnum is a genus of {{approximately}} 380 accepted species of mosses, {{commonly known as}} peat moss. Accumulations of Sphagnum can store water, since both living and dead plants can hold large quantities of water inside their cells; plants may hold 16–26 times as much water as their dry weight, depending on the species. The empty cells help retain water in drier conditions. Hence, as sphagnum moss grows, it can slowly spread into drier conditions, forming larger mires, both raised bogs and blanket bogs. These peat accumulations then provide habitat for {{a wide array of}} peatland plants, including sedges and ericaceous shrubs, as well as orchids and carnivorous plants. Sphagnum and the peat formed from it do not decay readily because of the phenolic compounds embedded in the moss's cell walls. In addition, bogs, like all wetlands, develop anaerobic soil conditions, which produces slower anaerobic decay rather than aerobic microbial action. Peat moss can also acidify its surroundings by taking up cations, such as calcium and magnesium, and releasing hydrogen ions. Under the right conditions, peat can accumulate to a depth of many meters. Different species of Sphagnum have different <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> for flooding and pH, so any one peatland may have a number of different Sphagnum species.|$|E

2500|$|The crevalle jack, Caranx hippos (also {{known as}} the common jack, black-tailed trevally, couvalli jack, black cavalli, jack crevale and yellow cavalli) is a common species of large marine fish {{classified}} within the jack family, Carangidae. The crevalle jack is distributed across the tropical and temperate waters of the Atlantic Ocean, ranging from Nova Scotia, Canada to Uruguay in the west Atlantic and Portugal to Angola in the east Atlantic, including the Mediterranean Sea. It is distinguishable from similar species by its deep body, fin colouration {{and a host of}} more detailed anatomical features, including fin ray and lateral line scale counts. It {{is one of the largest}} fish in the genus Caranx, growing to a maximum known length of 124cm and a weight of 32 kg, although is rare at lengths greater than 60cm. The crevalle jack inhabits both inshore and offshore waters to depths of around 350 m, predominantly over reefs, bays, lagoons and occasionally estuaries. Young fish dispersed north by currents in the eastern Atlantic are known to migrate back to more tropical waters before the onset of winter; [...] however, if the fish fail to migrate, mass mortalities occur as the temperature falls below the species' <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits.</b>|$|E

The <b>tolerance</b> <b>limit</b> for chloride for various mortars follows the order: PSC[PPC[OPC.
