5|$|The new Republic of Texas grew rapidly. <b>The</b> <b>shores</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bay were {{initially}} mostly home to farms and ranches {{such as the}} famed Allen Ranch. New communities such as Goose Creek (modern Baytown) were established.|$|E
5|$|Bazalgette's work {{ensured that}} sewage {{was no longer}} dumped onto <b>the</b> <b>shores</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Thames and brought {{an end to the}} cholera outbreaks; his actions {{probably}} saved more lives than any other Victorian official. His sewer system operates into the 21st century, servicing a city that has grown to a population of over eight million. The historian Peter Ackroyd argues that Bazalgette should be considered a hero of London.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{north from}} Alberta, US41 enters {{the town of}} L'Anse {{on the east side}} of Keweenaw Bay, {{rounding}} the bay to the town of Baraga.

The palace is preserved in great part to this day and forms the historic core of Split, the second-largest city of modern Croatia.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Hashimoto {{volunteered for}} the {{submarine}} service, and in 1937, he served aboard destroyers and submarine chasers off <b>the</b> <b>shores</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Republic of China. On 15 November, as a sub-lieutenant, Hashimoto {{was assigned to the}} crew of the gunboat Hozu, and was promoted to lieutenant on 1 December. During that time, his brother was killed in action fighting on the Chinese mainland.|$|E
5|$|In the 3rd century BC the Iazyges lived {{along the}} {{northern}} shores of the Sea of Azov – which the Ancient Greeks and Romans knew as the Lake of Maeotis – in modern south-east Ukraine. From there, the Iazyges, or {{at least part of}} them, moved west along <b>the</b> <b>shores</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Black Sea into modern Moldova and southwest Ukraine.|$|E

5|$|The Scythians were a {{group of}} north Iranian nomadic tribes, {{speaking}} an Iranian language (Scythian languages) who had invaded Media, killed Cyrus in battle, revolted against Darius and threatened to disrupt trade between Central Asia and <b>the</b> <b>shores</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Black Sea as they lived between the Danube River, River Don and the Black Sea.|$|E

Since that time, the Riverwalk Center, a 750-seat facility on <b>the</b> <b>shores</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Blue River, has been the NRO's main performance base.|$|E

5|$|A gull colony {{has been}} present since 1984, {{although}} gulls were seen briefly on <b>the</b> <b>shores</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new island only weeks after it first appeared. The gull colony {{has been particularly}} important in developing the plant life on Surtsey, and the gulls have had much more of an impact on plant colonisation than other breeding species due to their abundance. An expedition in 2004 found the first evidence of nesting Atlantic puffins, which are extremely common {{in the rest of}} the archipelago.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves {{developed}} at the shores of Lake Cahuilla. These include Anodonta californiensis and possibly Pisidium casertanum. Anodonta shells are sometimes found within their own tunnels. They were probably used by inhabitants as a food source or to make shell beads. Gastropods identified include Amnicola longinqua, Gyraulus parvus, Helisoma trivolvis, Physella ampullacea, Physella humerosa and Tryonia protea. These taxa were relatively abundant at <b>the</b> <b>shores</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lake. Ostracods include Cypridopsis vidua, Cyprinotus torosa and Limnocythere ceriotuberosa. Sponges {{have been identified in}} fossil deposits as well. One mammal found in the lake was the muskrat, Ondatra zibethicus.|$|E
5|$|Cyprus {{appears to}} be the {{principal}} intermediary station between Mycenaean Greece and the Middle East, based on the considerable greater quantities of Mycenaean goods found there. On the other hand, trade with the Hittite lands in central Anatolia appears to have been limited. Trade with Troy is also well attested, while Mycenaean trade routes expanded further to the Bosphorus and <b>the</b> <b>shores</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Black Sea. Mycenaean swords have been found as far away as Georgia in the eastern Black Sea coast.|$|E

5|$|Hunting {{dolphins}} (at {{the time}} still often incorrectly {{referred to as}} fish or porpoises), primarily using harpoons and firearms, was considered a form of recreational hunting along <b>the</b> <b>shores</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Mexico in Texas in the late 19th and early 20th century. Pleasure dolphin hunting cruises could be booked in Corpus Christi in the 1920s, with a promise to tourists that if no successful dolphin kill was made, the excursion would be free of charge. The brutality of the practice started to spark animal welfare concerns {{and there is no}} reference of this practice still occurring in Texas after the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|King's Highway 80, {{commonly}} referred to as Highway 80, was a provincially maintained highway in the Canadian province of Ontario. It travelled in an east–west direction south of Sarnia from Courtright to Strathburn. Beginning at the St. Clair Parkway near <b>the</b> <b>shores</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> St. Clair River, the route travelled , intersecting Highway40, Highway21 and Highway79 before ending at Highway2. In addition to the towns at either terminus, Highway80 serviced the communities of Brigden, Glencoe and Alvinston. The entire route was and remains two lanes wide.|$|E
5|$|Kuleli Military High School, along <b>the</b> <b>shores</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bosphorus in Çengelköy, and Turkish Naval High School, {{located on}} one of the Princes' Islands, are {{military}} high schools, complemented by three military academies—the Turkish Air Force, Turkish Military, and Turkish Naval Academies. Darüşşafaka High School provides free education to children across the country missing at least one parent. Darüşşafaka begins instruction with the fourth grade, providing instruction in English and, starting in sixth grade, a second foreign language—German or French. Other prominent high schools in the city include Istanbul Lisesi (founded in 1884), Kabataş Erkek Lisesi (founded in 1908) and Kadıköy Anadolu Lisesi (founded in 1955).|$|E

5|$|The Muslim {{presence}} in Gibraltar began on 27 April 711 when the Berber general Tariq ibn-Ziyad led the initial incursion into Iberia {{in advance of}} the main Moorish force under the command of Musa ibn Nusayr, Umayyad governor of Ifriqiya. Gibraltar was named after Tariq, who was traditionally said to have landed on <b>the</b> <b>shores</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rock of Gibraltar, though it seems more likely that he landed somewhere nearby. Muslim sources claimed that Tariq established some kind of fortification on the Rock, but no evidence has been found and it is not considered credible. It was not until 1160 that a first fortified settlement was built there.|$|E
5|$|The Votadini, who {{occupied}} the south-east of Scotland, came under Roman sway {{at an early}} stage and Cerialis sent one division north through their territory to <b>the</b> <b>shores</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Firth of Forth. The XXth Legion took a western route through Annandale in an attempt to encircle and isolate the Selgovae who {{occupied the}} central Southern Uplands. Early success tempted Cerialis further north and he began constructing a line of Glenblocker forts to the north and west of the Gask Ridge which marked a frontier between the Venicones to the south and the Caledonians to the north.|$|E
5|$|The {{cetaceans}} (whales, dolphins and porpoises) are {{marine mammal}} descendants of land mammals. The pakicetids are an extinct family of hoofed mammals {{that are the}} earliest whales, whose closest sister group is Indohyus from family Raoellidae. They lived in the Early Eocene, around 53 million years ago. Their fossils were first discovered in North Pakistan in 1979, at a river not far from <b>the</b> <b>shores</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former Tethys Sea. Pakicetids could hear under water, using enhanced bone conduction, rather than depending on tympanic membranes like most land mammals. This arrangement does not give directional hearing under water.|$|E
