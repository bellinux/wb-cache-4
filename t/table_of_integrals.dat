Relations between the simplices and these determinants are also derived. We give determinantal conditions which are both necessary and sufficient for a full simplex to contain just one approximant. A nullity lemma is proved limiting the change between contiguous types {{in the number of}} linearly independent solutions for integral polynomials.

40|$|The {{method of}} {{brackets}} is an efficient method {{for the evaluation}} of a large class of definite integrals on the half-line. It is based on a small collection of rules, some of which are heuristic. The extension discussed here is based on the concepts of null and divergent series. These are formal representations of functions, whose coefficients a_n have meromorphic representations for n ∈C, but might vanish or blow up when n ∈N.

It is noted that the conditions for convergence {{in a number of}} integrals, that in the original source were obtained via Bessel transforms, are too restrictive. Also, a property of the parabolic cylinder function is used to simplify one of the integrals in Gradshteyn and Ryzhik into a result that enables the calculation of integrals for squares and higher powers of the error function. Subsequently, an indefinite integral for the normal distribution is specialized into several expressions that are reported in Gradshteyn and Ryzhik. The paper ends by listing integrals for which the aforementioned overly restrictive conditions emerge and/or for which generalizations or misprints are found...|$|E
40|$|A new {{procedure}} for regularizing Feynman integrals in the noncovariant Coulomb gauge is proposed for Yang-Mills theory. The procedure {{is based on}} a variant of dimensional regularization, called split dimensional regularization, which leads to internally consistent, ambiguity-free integrals. It is demonstrated that split dimensional regularization yields a one-loop Yang-Mills self-energy that is nontransverse, but local. Despite the noncovariant nature of the Coulomb gauge, ghosts are necessary in order to satisfy the appropriate Ward/BRS identity. The computed Coulomb-gauge Feynman integrals are applicable to both Abelian and non-Abelian gauge models. PACS: 11. 15, 12. 38. CComment: 19 pages, 2 figures, 1 table, 72 references.
