5|$|Soult {{was in a}} dilemma. He {{could not}} defend both the {{important}} southwestern port of Bordeaux and Toulouse. He decided <b>that</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> hold Bordeaux would put the Garonne Estuary at his back {{and that it would}} be difficult to obtain food in that area. Therefore, the French marshal determined to operate to the east in the direction of Toulouse. On 2 March, the Allies clashed with the French at Aire-sur-l'Adour in a combat that cost the French about 250 men killed and wounded, including 12 officers, and 100 captured. Hippolita Da Costa sent his Portuguese brigade to attack a strong position. When it was repulsed with losses of five officers and 100 men, Da Costa failed to rally the soldiers and was replaced in command. British losses were 156 killed and wounded in the 2nd Division. After this action with Hill, Harispe abandoned Aire. Soult withdrew to a position between Maubourguet and Plaisance where his army was left alone for ten days.|$|E
5|$|There was no Whig platform—the {{party leaders}} decided <b>that</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> put one {{together}} would tear the party apart. So the Whigs ran on {{their opposition to}} Van Buren, blaming him and his Democrats for the recession. In campaign materials, Tyler was praised for integrity in resigning over the state legislature's instructions. The Whigs initially hoped to muzzle Harrison and Tyler, lest they make policy statements that alienated segments of the party. But after Tyler's Democratic rival, Vice President Johnson, made a successful speaking tour, Tyler was called upon to travel from Williamsburg to Columbus, Ohio, and there address a local convention, in a speech intended to assure Northerners that he shared Harrison's views. In his journey of nearly two months, Tyler made speeches at rallies. He could not avoid questions, and after being heckled into an admission that he supported the Compromise Tariff (many Whigs did not), resorted to quoting from Harrison's vague speeches. In his two-hour speech at Columbus, Tyler entirely avoided {{the issue of the}} Bank of the United States, one of the major questions of the day.|$|E

When offered a YTS place by Liverpool, the team he supported, he believed <b>that</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> progress as a fellow left-footed striker at the club {{at the same time as}} Fowler would not be a good idea. Consequently, he accepted a similar offer from Crewe Alexandra.|$|E
25|$|Popular Islam {{is based}} mostly on oral tradition. Imams with {{virtually}} no formal education commonly memorize the entire Qur'an and recite appropriate verses on religious occasions. They also tell religious stories at village festivals and commemorations marking an individual's rites of passage. Predestination {{plays an important role}} in popular Islam. This concept includes the belief that everything that happens in life is the will of God and the belief <b>that</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> avoid misfortune is useless and invites worse affliction. Revelations from God in the Qur'an form the basis of Monotheism merged with a belief in angels, and jinns (spirits).|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have shown}} {{that it is very}} {{difficult}} to eliminate the optimistic bias; however, some people believe <b>that</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> reduce the optimistic bias will encourage people to adapt to health-protective behaviors. Some researchers suggest that the optimistic bias cannot be reduced, and that by trying to reduce the optimistic bias the end result was generally even more optimistically biased. In a study of four different tests to reduce the optimistic bias, researchers found that regardless of the attempts to reduce the bias, through lists of risk factors, participants perceiving themselves as inferior to others, participants asked to think of high-risk individuals, and giving attributes of why they were at risk, all increased the bias rather than decreased it. Although studies have tried to reduce the optimistic bias through reducing distance, overall, the optimistic bias still remains.|$|E

However, Mansell finished fourth in the Championship {{with the help of a}} memorable second win for Ferrari at the tight and twisty Hungaroring for the Hungarian Grand Prix. Early in practice Mansell had seen <b>that</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> qualify the car high on the grid was a pointless exercise and he decided instead to concentrate on a good race set-up. After qualifying 12th (0.681s behind teammate Gerhard Berger in sixth and 2.225s behind pole man Riccardo Patrese in his Williams-Renault) and not even being considered a chance for the race, he charged his way through the field until he pulled off a sensational passing manoeuvre on the McLaren-Honda of World Champion Ayrton Senna on lap 58 to take a lead he would not lose.|$|E

500|$|There was {{a debate}} which raged within Fighter Command during the Battle of Britain. It centred around what {{strategy}} to pursue against the Luftwaffe. AOC Hugh Dowding and AOC 11 Group Keith Park favoured a [...] strategy of non-attrition. From their perspective, the RAF had {{to remain intact}} to win the battle, rather than decimate the Luftwaffe. Both felt <b>that</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> fight a battle of attrition would give the numerically superior enemy the chance to destroy {{large parts of the}} Command in one go, thus playing into Göring's hands. Therefore, Park and Dowding advocated the tactic of sending small numbers of fighters to intercept every raid; providing opposition to every raid offered the chance of inflicting continued attrition on German formations while avoiding decisive damage to Fighter Command.|$|E

Swift kicked with his left foot as the result of an injury to his right foot sustained during his youth. However, where possible he preferred throwing the ball to the wing over kicking it downfield. When asked for advice to give to young goalkeepers, Swift replied that he drew diagrams of each goal scored against him {{to see if he was}} at fault.|$|E

500|$|Before {{production}} {{began on}} Homogenic, Björk {{wanted to create}} an album with [...] "a simple sound" [...] and [...] "only one flavour".

The album differs from her previous two releases stylistically, and Neva Chonin of Rolling Stone stated the album was [...] "certain to be rough going for fans looking for the sweet melodies and peppy dance collages of her earlier releases". As with other Björk releases, it has been difficult for critics to classify Homogenic within a musical genre. Tiny Mix Tapes considered that [...] "Björk has managed to create something so refreshingly unique <b>that</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> categorize and label the music is rather dubious." [...] Writing for Beats Per Minute, Cole Zercoe felt Homogenic represented a pinnacle work of trip hop, forming part of [...] "a sort of holy trinity of this musical aesthetic" [...] along with Massive Attack's Mezzanine and Portishead's Dummy.|$|E

[...] Slant Magazine's Cole Mathews thought that the song returned West to his hard rap origins, commenting [...] "with the posse cuts 'Monster' and 'So Appalled', Kanye kicks out the two hardest rap tracks of his career."

[...] He added, [...] "Trying to get these drums right and figure out a bass line." [...] Lawrence believes the lack of [...] "heavy hitting drums" [...] and the presence of a small guitar solo allows the song to be carried by Mars.|$|E
500|$|After an American tour in 1970, {{bass player}} Glenn Cornick {{was fired from}} the band, and was {{replaced}} with Jeffrey Hammond, {{an old friend of}} Ian Anderson's. Aqualung would be the first recording Hammond would do with the band. It would also mark the first time John Evan had recorded a full album with the band, as his only prior involvement was to provide several keyboard parts on the previous 1970 album, Benefit. The album {{was one of the first}} to be recorded at the newly opened studios of Island Records in Basing Street, London. Led Zeppelin were recording their untitled fourth album at the same time. In an interview on the 25th anniversary edition of the album, Tull's bandleader Ian Anderson said <b>that</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> record in that studio was very difficult, because of its [...] "horrible, cold, echoey" [...] feel. There were two recording studios at the location; Led Zeppelin worked in the smaller studio while Tull got the larger, which was the main body of a converted church. The orchestrals were arranged by David Palmer, who had worked with the band since 1968's This Was, and would later join as a keyboard player. Aqualung would be the last Jethro Tull album to include Clive Bunker as a band member, as he retired shortly after recording to start a family.|$|E
