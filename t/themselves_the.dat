In addition to these native crops, the colonists also successfully planted Old World crops such as turnips, carrots, peas, wheat, barley, and oats.|$|E

5|$|Historiographical {{studies of}} the May Revolution do not face many doubts or unknown details.

5|$|In low-duty cycle echolocation, bats can {{separate}} their calls and returning echoes by time. They have to time their short calls to finish before echoes return.

40|$|The "above-average effect" is the {{phenomenon}} that {{people tend to}} judge themselves above average on desirable traits. Based on social identity theory, we propose that a "below-average effect" may arise when individuals rate <b>themselves</b> and <b>the</b> average ingroup member on traits stereotypically associated with the ingroup. In two studies, Republican and Democrat participants rated <b>themselves</b> and <b>the</b> average political ingroup member on possession of desirable traits related to warmth and competence. Current political stereotypes in America associate the former dimension with Democrats and the latter with Republicans. Consistent with our hypothesis, the above-average effect was moderated by political group and dimension in interaction. In particular, Democrats rated <b>themselves</b> below <b>the</b> average Democrat on warmth and Republicans rated <b>themselves</b> below <b>the</b> average Republican on competence. ...|$|R
