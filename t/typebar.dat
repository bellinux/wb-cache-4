5|$|The Sholes and Glidden {{typewriter}} incorporated several components {{adapted from}} existing devices, such as escapement (a mechanism governing carriage movement) adapted from clockwork, keys adapted from telegraph machines and type hammers {{adapted from the}} piano. In developing the first model, however, Sholes and Soule had not investigated printing machines created by other inventors and, consequently, developed several poor designs {{which could have been}} avoided. The failure to research earlier designs also led to the reinvention of features which had already been developed. Soule, for example, suggested a circular <b>typebar</b> orientation. A circular arrangement had been used more than 30years earlier in a machine designed by Xavier Progin in 1833.|$|E
25|$|Electrical {{typewriter}} designs {{removed the}} direct mechanical {{connection between the}} keys and the element that struck the paper. Not {{to be confused with}} later electronic typewriters, electric typewriters contained only a single electrical component: the motor. Where the keystroke had previously moved a <b>typebar</b> directly, now it engaged mechanical linkages that directed mechanical power from the motor into the <b>typebar.</b>|$|E
25|$|Before {{the shift}} key, {{typewriters}} {{had to have}} a separate key and <b>typebar</b> for upper-case letters; in essence, the typewriter had two keyboards, one above the other. With the shift key, manufacturing costs (and therefore purchase price) were greatly reduced, and typist operation was simplified; both factors contributed greatly to mass adoption of the technology. Certain models, such as the Barlet, had a double shift so that each key performed three functions. These little three-row machines were portable and could be used by journalists.|$|E
2500|$|In most of {{the early}} typewriters, the <b>typebars</b> struck upward against the paper, pressed against {{the bottom of the}} platen, so the typist could not see the text as it was typed. [...] What was typed was not visible until a {{carriage}} return caused it to scroll into view. [...] The difficulty with any other arrangement was ensuring the <b>typebars</b> fell back into place reliably when the key was released. This was eventually achieved with various ingenious mechanical designs and so-called [...] "visible typewriters" [...] which used frontstriking, in which the <b>typebars</b> struck forward against the front side of the platen, became standard.|$|R

500|$|The Oliver’s <b>typebars</b> {{are bent}} in a bow (forming an {{inverted}} [...] "U" [...] shape) and rest in [...] "towers" [...] {{on the sides}} of the typewriter. This design limited the machine to a three-row QWERTY keyboard as the <b>typebars</b> were stacked such that they grew progressively larger as more were added. The size and usability implications of adding additional keys and thus, more <b>typebars,</b> precluded the addition of a fourth keyboard row dedicated to numbers. Although a four-row prototype was designed in 1922, it was shelved due to the company’s financial troubles at that time. The No. 20, No. 21 and portable models produced by the British Oliver Typewriter Company had four-row keyboards.|$|R
500|$|Schwalbach later {{replaced}} the piano-like keys with [...] "buttons" [...] and positioned them into four banked rows. [...] The {{mechanics of the}} machine, however, made the alphabetical arrangement problematic. The typebars were attached to the circumference of a metal ring, forming a [...] "basket". When a key was pressed, the corresponding <b>typebar</b> would swing upwards, causing the print head to strike {{at the center of}} the ring. Gravity would then return the <b>typebar</b> to its initial position. The implication of this design, however, was that pressing adjoining keys in quick succession would cause their typebars to collide and jam the machine. To mitigate this problem, keys were reordered using analysis of letter frequency and trial and error. Densmore asked his son-in-law, a Pennsylvania school superintendent, what letters and combinations of letters appeared most often in the English language. Typebars corresponding to letters in commonly occurring alphabetical pairs, such as S and T, were placed on opposite sides on the ring. The keyboard ultimately presented to Remington was arranged as follows: ...|$|E
500|$|In the machine's {{original}} 1868 design, {{paper was}} placed horizontally {{on the top}} of the machine, held in place by a movable square frame (to provide line and letter spacing). Above the paper and centered on the device, an arm held an inked ribbon which crossed over a small metal plate. Depressing a key caused a <b>typebar</b> to rise from underneath the paper, pressing the paper upwards against the ribbon and thus printing an inked character. This method of imprinting required use of very thin, nonstandard paper (such as tissue paper). Two variants were produced with alternative methods of actuating the typebars: one in which the keys and typebars were connected by a series of wires and one in which the keys directly [...] "kicked" [...] the typebars upwards.|$|E
2500|$|By about 1910, the [...] "manual" [...] or [...] "mechanical" [...] {{typewriter}} {{had reached}} a somewhat standardized design. There were minor variations from one manufacturer to another, but most typewriters followed the concept that each key was attached to a <b>typebar</b> that had the corresponding letter molded, in reverse, into its striking head. [...] When a key was struck briskly and firmly, the <b>typebar</b> hit a ribbon (usually made of inked fabric), making a printed mark on the paper wrapped around a cylindrical platen.|$|E

5000|$|The {{construction}} of the [...] "Type Writer" [...] had two flaws that made the product susceptible to jams.Firstly, characters were mounted on metal arms or <b>typebars,</b> which would clash and jam if neighboring arms were pressed {{at the same time}} or in rapid succession. Secondly, its printing point was located beneath the paper carriage, invisible to the operator, a so-called [...] "up-stroke" [...] design. Consequently, jams were especially serious, because the typist could only discover the mishap by raising the carriage to inspect what had been typed. The solution was to place commonly used letter-pairs (like [...] "th" [...] or [...] "st") so that their <b>typebars</b> were not neighboring, avoiding jams.|$|R
2500|$|In a {{conventional}} typewriter the <b>typebar</b> reaches {{the end of}} its travel simply by striking the ribbon and paper. A [...] "noiseless" [...] typewriter has a complex lever mechanism that decelerates the <b>typebar</b> mechanically before pressing it against the ribbon and paper in an attempt to dampen the noise. It certainly reduced the high-frequency content of the sound, rendering it more of a [...] "clunk" [...] than a [...] "clack" [...] and arguably less intrusive, but such advertising claims as [...] "A machine that can be operated {{a few feet away from}} your desk — And not be heard" [...] were not true.|$|E
2500|$|A {{significant}} innovation was {{the shift}} key, introduced with the Remington No. 2 in 1878. This key physically [...] "shifted" [...] either {{the basket of}} typebars, {{in which case the}} typewriter is described as [...] "basket shift", or the paper-holding carriage, in which case the typewriter is described as [...] "carriage shift". [...] Either mechanism caused a different portion of the <b>typebar</b> to come in contact with the ribbon/platen. [...] The result is that each <b>typebar</b> could type two different characters, cutting the number of keys and typebars in half (and simplifying the internal mechanisms considerably). The obvious use for this was to allow letter keys to type both upper and lower case, but normally the number keys were also duplexed, allowing access to special symbols such as percent (%) and ampersand (&).|$|E
2500|$|... shift – a {{modifier}} key used to type {{capital letters}} and other alternate [...] "upper case" [...] characters; when pressed and held down, would shift a typewriter's mechanism {{to allow a}} different <b>typebar</b> impression (such as 'D' instead of 'd') to press into the ribbon and print on a page. The concept of a shift key or modifier key was later extended to Ctrl, Alt, and Super ("Windows" [...] or [...] "Apple") keys on modern computer keyboards. The generalized concept of a shift key reached its apotheosis in the MIT space-cadet keyboard.|$|E
25|$|One popular but unverified {{explanation}} for the QWERTY arrangement {{is that it was}} designed to reduce the likelihood of internal clashing of <b>typebars</b> by placing commonly used combinations of letters farther from each other inside the machine.|$|R
25|$|Typewriter eraser brushes were {{necessary}} for clearing eraser crumbs and paper dust, {{and using the}} brush properly was {{an important element of}} typewriting skill; if erasure detritus fell into the typewriter, a small buildup could cause the <b>typebars</b> to jam in their narrow supporting grooves.|$|R
2500|$|The first {{electric}} typewriter {{was produced}} by the Blickensderfer Manufacturing Company, of Stamford, Connecticut, in 1902. Like the manual Blickensderfer typewriters, it used a cylindrical typewheel rather than individual <b>typebars.</b> It was not a commercial success, {{which may have been}} because at the time electricity had not been standardized and voltage differed from city to city. The next step {{in the development of the}} electric typewriter came in 1910, when Charles and Howard Krum filed a patent for the first practical teletypewriter. The Krums' machine, named the Morkrum Printing Telegraph, used a typewheel rather than individual <b>typebars.</b> [...] This machine was used for the first commercial teletypewriter system on Postal Telegraph Company lines between Boston and New York City in 1910.|$|R
2500|$|The IBM Selectric {{became a}} {{commercial}} success, dominating the office typewriter market {{for at least}} two decades. [...] IBM also gained an advantage by marketing more heavily to schools than did Remington, with the idea that students who learned to type on a Selectric would later choose IBM typewriters over the competition in the workplace as businesses replaced their old manual models. [...] By the 1970s, IBM had succeeded in establishing the Selectric as the de facto standard typewriter in mid- to high-end office environments, replacing the raucous [...] "clack" [...] of older <b>typebar</b> machines with the quieter sound of gyrating typeballs.|$|E
2500|$|The final major {{development}} of the typewriter was the [...] "electronic" [...] typewriter. Most of these replaced the typeball with a plastic or metal daisy wheel mechanism (a disk with the letters molded on the outside edge of the [...] "petals"). The daisy wheel concept first emerged in printers developed by Diablo Systems in the 1970s. [...] In 1981, Xerox Corporation, who by then had bought Diablo Systems, introduced a line of Electronic Typewriters incorporating this technology (the Memorywriter product line). For a time, these products were quite successful as their daisy-wheel mechanism was much simpler and cheaper than either <b>typebar</b> or Selectric mechanisms, and their electronic memory and display allowed the user to easily see errors and correct them before they were actually printed. [...] One problem with the plastic daisy wheel {{was that they were}} not always durable. [...] To solve this problem, more durable metal daisy wheels were made available (but at a slightly higher price).|$|E

5000|$|The Crandall Typewriter was {{patented}} in 1881 {{and manufactured}} by the Crandall Machine Company of Groton, New York. The Crandall used a type sleeve, {{as opposed to}} <b>typebars,</b> inked by a ribbon. It also used a non standard two-row keyboard. It has been called [...] "the first American visible and practically useful typewriter." ...|$|R
50|$|The Lettera 22 uses {{a basket}} shift or segment shift (that is, the unit {{including}} the <b>typebars</b> moves {{up and down}} when shifting, {{as opposed to the}} carriage shift system). The Lettera 22 is quite compact compared to other 1950s portable typewriters using a basket shift, such as the Smith Corona Sterling or Remington-Rand Quiet-Riter.|$|R
2500|$|Due to the {{physical}} similarity, the typeball was {{sometimes referred to as}} a [...] "golfball". The typeball design had many advantages, especially the elimination of [...] "jams" [...] (when more than one key was struck at once and the <b>typebars</b> became entangled) and in the ability to change the typeball, allowing multiple fonts to be used in a single document.|$|R

50|$|The Lettera 22 is {{an oblique}} frontstroke <b>typebar</b> typewriter. The typebars strike a red/black inked ribbon, which is {{positioned}} between the <b>typebar</b> {{and the paper}} by a lever whenever a key is pressed; a small switch located near the upper {{right side of the}} keyboard can be used to control the strike position of the ribbon, in order to print with black, red, or no ink (for mimeograph stencils).|$|E

2500|$|This was {{the origin}} of the term typewriter. Remington began {{production}} of its first typewriter on March 1, 1873, in Ilion, New York. It had a QWERTY keyboard layout, which because of the machine's success, was slowly adopted by other typewriter manufacturers. [...] As with most other early typewriters, because the <b>typebars</b> strike upwards, the typist could not see the characters as they were typed.|$|R
2500|$|Due {{to their}} speed (14.8 {{characters}} per second), immunity to clashing <b>typebars,</b> trouble-free paper path, high quality printed output, and reliability, Selectric-based mechanisms were also widely used as terminals for computers, replacing both Teletypes and older typebar-based output devices. [...] One popular example was the IBM 2741 terminal. Among other applications, the 2741 (with a special typing element) figured {{prominently in the}} early years of the APL programming language.|$|R
50|$|In {{mechanical}} typewriters, {{the shift}} key functions by mechanically shifting some component so an alternate row of characters on <b>typebars</b> hits the paper. In an electronic system, by contrast, {{there is no}} necessary connection between the code points of unshifted and shifted values, though implementation is simpler if the code points of unshifted and shifted keys are related, most simply by a single bit differing. In electromechanical systems, this makes {{a significant difference in}} ease of implementation, as shifting must be accomplished by some physical linkage.|$|R
50|$|The IBM Electromatic {{typewriter}} was {{the first}} electric typewriter to enjoy long-term commercial success. Unlike the later IBM Selectric typewriter, this typewriter model used a conventional moving carriage and <b>typebar</b> mechanism.|$|E
50|$|The Caps Lock key {{originated}} as a Shift {{lock key}} on mechanical typewriters. An early innovation in typewriters was {{the introduction of}} a second character on each <b>typebar,</b> thereby doubling the number of characters that could be typed, using the same number of keys. The second character was positioned above the first on the face of each <b>typebar,</b> and the shift key caused the entire type apparatus to move, physically shifting the positioning of the typebars relative to the ink ribbon. Just as in modern computer keyboards, the shifted position was used to produce capitals and secondary characters.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{conventional}} typewriter the <b>typebar</b> reaches {{the end of}} its travel simply by striking the ribbon and paper. A [...] "noiseless" [...] typewriter has a complex lever mechanism that decelerates the <b>typebar</b> mechanically before pressing it against the ribbon and paper in an attempt to dampen the noise.

5000|$|A platen (or platten) is a flat {{platform}} {{with a variety}} of roles in printing or manufacturing. It can be a flat metal (or earlier, wooden) plate pressed against a medium (such as paper) to cause an impression in letterpress printing. [...] Platen may also refer to a typewriter roller which friction-feeds paper into position below the <b>typebars</b> or print head, it can refer to the glass surface of a copier, or it can refer to the rotating disk used to polish semiconductor wafers.|$|R
25|$|IBM and Remington Rand {{electric}} typewriters {{were the}} leading models until IBM introduced the IBM Selectric typewriter in 1961, which replaced the <b>typebars</b> with a spherical element (or typeball) slightly {{smaller than a}} golf ball, with reverse-image letters molded into its surface. The Selectric used a system of latches, metal tapes, and pulleys driven by an electric motor to rotate {{the ball into the}} correct position and then strike it against the ribbon and platen. The typeball moved laterally in front of the paper, instead of the previous designs using a platen-carrying carriage moving the paper across a stationary print position.|$|R
50|$|The Shift {{lock key}} was {{introduced}} so the shift operation could be maintained indefinitely without continuous effort. It mechanically locked the <b>typebars</b> in the shifted position, causing the upper character to be typed upon pressing any key. Because the two shift keys on a typewriter required more force to operate and {{were meant to}} be pressed by the little finger, it could be difficult to hold the shift down for {{more than two or three}} consecutive strokes, therefore the introduction of the Shift lock key was also meant to reduce finger muscle pain caused by repetitive typing.|$|R
