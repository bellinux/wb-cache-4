40|$|Structures will be mispositioned across prestack {{migration}} gathers in {{the presence}} of inaccuracies in the velocity model. Stacking these misaligned gathers runs the risk of destroying important structures in the stacked migration image. To mitigate this problem, we propose a <b>trim</b> <b>statics</b> inspired by the non-local means algorithm originally developed for image denoising. This method differs from the conventional one in two fundamental respects. First, the <b>trim</b> <b>statics</b> are computed by comparing image patches instead of individual image traces. Second, no global pilot trace is needed because only two migration images at a time participate in <b>trim</b> <b>statics</b> and are stacked into one image. A multitude of migration images are stacked recursively in this two-to-one fashion. Tests with a Gulf of Mexico dataset show a noticeable improvement in the feature coherency of the stacked migration image...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} repeatability {{analysis has}} been performed based on Oseberg 4 D seismic data using a tailored 4 D-processing sequence. This paper demonstrates {{the improvement of}} the repeatability in three major steps: a) pre-processing, tidal correction, swell noise removal, channel based RMS amplitude scaling, and tau-p deconvolution to attenuate multiples; b) 4 D azimuth preserved trace binning to produce the desired offsets classes, and missing trace interpolation on the offset planes, and c) amplitude preserved pre-stack time migration (PSTM) and post migration processing including residual moveout correction, CDP <b>trim</b> <b>statics</b> and Q-compensation before global matching. A key element of this processing flow has been the implementation of the azimuth preserved trace binning methodology between base and monitor surveys followed by missing trace interpolation in order to improve repeatability. Oseberg 4 D seismic data acquisition and processing Oseberg 4 D seismic data used for this study consists of two surveys: NH 92 (base) and NH 99 (monitor). NH 92 was shot with 5 streamers, single source and two vessels, whereas NH 99 was acquired using a single vessel towing dual sources and 6 streamers. The different surve...|$|E
40|$|Concession NC 151 {{is located}} in the northwestern part of the Murzuq Basin (Libya), which is covered by linear sand dunes that reach heights of 100 m above the gravel plain. The sand dunes cause large {{increases}} in the travel times of reflected events in seismic data. In recent years, the conventional method used to calculate field static corrections has been to interpolate the near-surface velocity structure between upholes. Results are often unsatisfactory on lines that cross the dunes because the reflection events contain false structures that correlate with sand dune topography. These structural artifacts are caused by residual static errors which are too large for automatic statics programs to correct during processing. An alternative method of calculating field statics is to pick the first breaks on the Vibroseis field records, calculate the delay times at each station, and use the delay times directly as the field statics after applying a linear adjustment to match them to the upholes. This simple version of the refraction method does not require surface velocity-depth models to be produced, and gives much better results than the conventional field static method. Since this method does not require any near-surface velocity-depth model because it works in time, it can be used in areas with variable LVL or HVL (e. g., sand dunes or permafrost). The maximum power autostatics method was chosen from several residual statics methods that are available in the ProMAX package. Two iterations of maximum power autostatics and velocity analysis followed by non-surface-consistent <b>trim</b> <b>statics</b> improved the final stacked section...|$|E

40|$|Several {{conceptual}} hypersonic research airplanes, designed {{within the}} constraints of a B- 52 launch aircraft, have been studied experimentally and analytically at Mach numbers from 0. 2 to 6. 0. Vehicles built to these criteria for Mach 6 cruise were shown to be feasible, if careful {{attention was paid to}} the low speed lift, drag, and high angle of attack stability to assure successful landings and transonic pitch angle maneuvers. The integrated scramjet engine drag was high at subsonic speeds and appears to be constant with Reynolds number. The variable geometry airfoil used previously to improve directional stability was shown to be equally adaptable to the improvement of longitudinal stability. The vortex lattice theory gave good subsonic predictions of lift, drag due to lift, and pitching moments. Wind tunnel tests must be relied on for the drag at zero lift, <b>trim,</b> <b>static</b> margins and lateral-directional stability. The Gentry Hypersonic Arbitrary Body Program gave good predictions of the trends of lift, drag, and pitching moments with angle of attack at Mach numbers above 3, but the level of the values were not consistently predicted.
