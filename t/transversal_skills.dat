The computational language of mathematics usually is taught in advanced courses, once that the curriculum mathematical education is mainly completed; in addition, the numerical simulation is usually located late or even in doctoral studies. In this paper, we propose that the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) become to be a teaching-learning tool, instead of a strategic resource only.

40|$|Analytical {{thinking}} is a <b>transversal</b> <b>skill</b> that helps learners synthesize knowledge across subject areas; from mathematics, science, {{and technology to}} critical reading, critical examination, and evaluation of lessons. While most would not doubt the importance of analytical capacity in academic settings and its growing demand for the skill in professional environments, school curricula do not comprehensively address its development. As a result, the responsibility for structuring related learning activities falls to teachers. This work examines learning paradigms that can be integrated into mathematics and science school education for developing logical thinking through game-based exercises based on programming. The proposed learning design promotes structured algorithmic mindsets, is based on inclusive universal logic present in all cultures, and promotes constructivism educational approaches encouraging learners to drive knowledge building by composing past and emerging experiences...|$|R

40|$|Current {{engineering}} education challenges require approaches that promote scientific, technical, design and complementary skills while fostering autonomy, innovation and responsibility. The European Project Semester (EPS) at Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto (ISEP) (EPS@ISEP) is a one semester project-based learning programme (30 European Credit Transfer Units (ECTU)) for engineering students from diverse scientific backgrounds and nationalities that intends {{to address these}} goals.

40|$|This paper {{argues for}} the {{necessity}} of creativity and innovation in educational sets. Creative learning is defined as any learning privileging understanding over memorisation; creativity is thus a <b>transversal</b> <b>skill</b> facilitating a specific form of learning, requiring understanding, meaning-making and active participation. Creative learning is therefore increasingly relevant {{for the needs of}} the 21 st century knowledge-based society. A shift in learning asks for a change in teaching practices and methods, this is why this paper also addressed innovative teaching, which is understood as the implementation of new teaching methods, formats and practices aimed at fostering teachers and students creativity. This paper focuses on three inter-related enablers for change: technologies, culture and pedagogy. Technologies are already up-taken by young generation, who are appropriating ICT-tools and in particular web 2. 0 applications in new creative ways.

Communication, research and organisational/learning skills are core competences acquired by scientific research activity. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the perceived performance of a core of <b>transversal</b> <b>skills,</b> related with scientific research, by Portuguese medical students. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 611 Portuguese students attending the first, fourth and sixth years of the medical course, during the same academic year.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this work is {{describing}} the experience in using Project Based Learning (PBL) methodology in Materials Science courses in several Engineering degrees. The courses were taught simultaneously in four different Spanish universities. In addition, {{the impact of this}} proposal on the acquisition of <b>transversal</b> <b>skills</b> through the perceptions of students and teachers is assessed. In order to do so, voices of over 54 students and 5 lecturers involved in the work have been gathered and studied descriptively. Discussion groups and self-reports have been collected and subsequently analysed. The analysis of the data collected by these two instruments has been coded and categorized into general dimensions. The results show how, through the PBL, self-learning is encouraged and the development of <b>transversal</b> <b>skills</b> such as teamwork are enhanced. Meanwhile, the lecturers consider PBL an appropriate methodology for Materials Science courses; however its implementation requires a higher work load. The faculty acknowledged PBL as a very interesting tool to work and evaluate transversal competences. Hence, the PBL methodology stands {{as one of the most}} effective methods that meet the demands of the 21 st century and enables students to acquire not only content based knowledge, but also other abilities.

40|$|The OECD (2010) views {{problem solving}} as {{essential}} for lifelong learning. Recently, the 2012 PISA cycle administered domain-general problems, which featured {{the complexity of}} the structure, dynamics and interconnections of variables, and intransparency of the situation. This emphasis on domain-general problems expresses a paradigmatic shift to lifelong learning. In an attempt towards an integrative process theory of CPS, Fischer, Greiff and Funke (2012) portray knowledge acquisition and knowledge application as the core processes of CPS, which are distinguishable from classical cognitive ability (Dörner, 1986). These core processes are assessed in research via innovative computer-based microworlds. These microworlds simulate complex problems, which share features with real world problems, require knowledge acquisition and knowledge application for a successful task completion and offer a wide range of tasks and approaches (Greiff, Holt, et al., 2013; Greiff, Fischer, et al., 2013). Initiatives looking for the facilitation of so-called 21 st century skills (e. g., Griffin, McGaw, & Care, 2012; National Research Council, 2012 a; OECD, 2013 a, 2013 b) strongly relate CPS to demands for professional development as resulting from shifts towards non-routine problem solving and communication tasks in the working lives of adults (e. g., successfully adapting towards IT-depending occupations; Autor, Levy, & Murnane, 2003). So far, the application of CPS in research and practice has mainly been restricted to primary and secondary education. Lifespan or educational research on the role of <b>transversal</b> cognitive <b>skills</b> such as CPS for learning later in life is scarce at best and adult education practice fails to fully tap into the requirements of a working reality (Smith & Reio, 2006), which is defined by uncertainties, contradictions, and dynamic changes. CPS is considered to be important for lifelong learning and occupational success, but underrepresented in research and practice. As a consequence, adult education’s mission to provide opportunities for career preparation (e. g., Gianakos, 1996) and intellectual growth (Perry, 1999) seem to be at risk. Hence, the research goals in this study are to (1) enlarge the understanding for determinants of occupational career indicators (e. g. lifelong learning efforts) and eventually (2) encourage the inclusion of CPS on the adult educational research and practice agenda. Our research goals are built on a rich research fundus of the impact of GMA on professional development (e. g., Schmidt & Hunter, 1998) and promising results on the predictive validity of CPS for academic achievement (e. g., Schweizer, Wüstenberg, & Greiff, 2013; Sonnleitner, Keller, Martin, & Brunner, 2013; Wüstenberg, Greiff, & Funke, 2012) and occupational performance (Abele et al., 2012; Danner et al., 2011). Hence, the targeted constructs are GMA, and CPS as a <b>transversal</b> cognitive <b>skill</b> in occupational careers and professional development...|$|R

On the other hand, the "Patterns" have been gaining ground as an innovative way to contribute to the resolution of student's disinterest, lack of motivation and school failure.

In this perspective, we developed a research that aimed {{to assess the impact of}} an approach of isometries through the study of patterns and using dynamic geometry environment, at the level of the development of <b>transversal</b> and specific <b>skills</b> in Geometry.
