5|$|In 1746 Franklin {{began working}} on {{electrical}} experiments with Ebenezer Kinnersley after he bought all of Archibald Spencer's electrical equipment that he used in his lectures. Later he was also associated with Thomas Hopkinson and Philip Syng in experimentation with electricity. In the summer of 1747 they had received an electrical system from Thomas Penn. While no records exists <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> exactly what parts {{were included in the}} system, historian J. A. Leo LeMay believes {{it was a combination of}} an electricity generating machine, a Leyden jar, a glass tube, and a stool that was electrically insulated from the ground. This gave Franklin a complete system to experiment with generating and storing electricity.|$|E
5|$|Supporters of the emergentist {{coalition}} model argue that, as a hybrid, {{this model}} moves towards a more holistic explanation of word learning {{that is not}} captured by models with a singular focus. For instance, constraints theories typically argue that constraints/principles are available to children from the onset of word learning, but do not explain how children develop into expert speakers who are not limited by constraints. Additionally, some argue that domain-general perspectives do not fully {{address the question of}} how children sort through numerous potential referents in order to correctly sort out meaning. Lastly, social pragmatic theories claim that social encounters guide word learning. Although these theories describe how children become more advanced word learners, they seem <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> little about children's capacities at the start of word learning. According to its proponents, the emergentist coalion model incorporates constraints/principles, but argues for the development and change in these principles over time, while simultaneously taking into consideration social aspects of word learning alongside other cues, such as salience.|$|E

Many will ask what Harlem finds to honor in this stormy, controversial and bold young captainand we will smile. Many will say turn awayaway from this man, for he is not a man but a demon, a monster, a subverter and an enemy of the black manand we will smile. They will say that he is of hatea fanatic, a racistwho can only bring evil to the cause for which you struggle! And we will answer and say to them: Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you ever touch him, or have him smile at you? Did you ever really listen to him? Did he ever do a mean thing? Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance? For if you did you would know him. And if you knew him you would know why we must honor him... And, in honoring him, we honor the best in ourselves.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to {{working on his}} ill-fated film project, It's All True, Welles was responsible for radio programs, lectures, interviews and informal talks {{as part of his}} OCIAA-sponsored cultural mission, which was regarded as a success. He spoke on topics ranging from Shakespeare to visual art at gatherings of Brazil's elite, and his two intercontinental radio broadcasts in April 1942 were particularly intended <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>U.S.</b> audiences that President Vargas was a partner with the Allies. Welles's ambassadorial mission was extended to permit his travel to other nations including Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru and Uruguay. Welles worked {{for more than half a}} year with no compensation.|$|E
25|$|Geronimo {{was raised}} with the {{traditional}} religious views of the Bedonkohe. When questioned about his views on life after death, {{he wrote in his}} 1905 autobiography, As to the future state, the teachings of our tribe were not specific, that is, we had no definite idea of our relations and surroundings in after life. We believed that there is a life after this one, but no one ever told me as to what part of man lived after death... We held that the discharge of one's duty would make his future life more pleasant, but whether that future life was worse than this life or better, we did not know, and no one was able <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us.</b> We hoped that in the future life, family and tribal relations would be resumed. In a way we believed this, but we did not know it.|$|E

5000|$|In his {{introduction}} to the new 1976 edition of the novel, Lawson Fusao Inada writes of meeting Okada's wife, Dorothy, in La Grande, Oregon 1976:Dorothy is a truly wonderful person. It hurt <b>to</b> have her <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> that [...] "John would have liked you." [...] It hurt <b>to</b> have her <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> that [...] "you two are the first ones who ever came to see him about his work." [...] It hurt <b>to</b> have her <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> that she recently burned his [...] "other novel about the Issei, which we both researched and which was almost finished." [...] It hurt <b>to</b> have her <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> that [...] "the people I tried to contact about it never answered so when I moved I burned it, because I have him in my heart." ...

25|$|Delaware {{experienced}} all {{the contention}} and bitterness of a border {{state in the}} Civil War and the {{events leading up to}} it, but because of its location and certain decisive military action, was spared much of the bloodshed of Kentucky and Missouri. Nevertheless, the divisions in communities and families, and their corresponding strong feelings were the same. A slave state with very few slaves or slaveholders, many in Delaware had an attitude they called “states rights,” which really meant, “Outsiders are not going <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> what to do.” Given the close economic ties to Philadelphia, and the geographical separation from the Confederacy, there was little sentiment for actual secession. However, the opposition to the abolitionist and voting rights agenda of the Republican federal government were strong enough to create considerable contentiousness. These feeling were strongest in the two lower counties, which still had a majority of the population in 1860, and completely dominated the General Assembly, the real decision maker in the state.|$|E
500|$|After {{speaking}} about the atomic theory of Democritus, Maxwell goes on <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> that the word 'molecule' is a modern word. [...] He states, [...] "it does not occur in Johnson's Dictionary. [...] The ideas it embodies are those belonging to modern chemistry." [...] We are told that an 'atom' is a material point, invested and surrounded by 'potential forces' and that when 'flying molecules' strike against a solid body in constant succession it causes what is called pressure of air and other gases. [...] At this point, however, Maxwell notes {{that no one has}} ever seen or handled a molecule.|$|E
500|$|Many {{scenes were}} shot in advance. The {{producers}} disliked filming beforehand as they preferred [...] "the audience <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> what's good and what's bad." [...] They also {{were concerned that}} a flashback episode would {{be mistaken for a}} clip show, but felt it would be believable because they were [...] "flashing so far back into the past." [...] According to Kauffman, certain scenes filmed in the apartment were shot in advance because [...] "it was all over the place"; the cast were tired and full and their energy levels were low. Special effects and costume changes meant [...] "three or four scenes" [...] were also pre-shot to ensure the dialogue was happening in front of the audience. This was completed in two days.|$|E

Idolator's X. Alexander compared {{the concept of the}} video, along with its scenes of homoeroticism, to her 1990 music videos for [...] "Vogue" [...] and [...] "Justify My Love". Sophie A. Schillaci of The Hollywood Reporter noted references to the music video for [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] (1989). E! contributor Nathalie Finn commented: [...] "Madonna doesn't need a song <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> she's ready to dance all night—just one look at her and you figure she could outlast the average partyer under any circumstances". She added that the references to her old work, as well as the half-nude men indicated that [...] "it isn't just the girls 'who wanna have some fun'." ...|$|E
500|$|However, Wolcott Gibbs of The New Yorker {{called the}} musical [...] "a {{shocking}} disappointment". [...] Robert Garland, in the New York Journal American suggested that Rodgers and Hammerstein [...] "had confused allegro [...] with, say, lento, which means 'slow', 'unhurried', and even downright 'serious'". [...] Critic George Jean Nathan, {{in a special}} piece in the Journal American, decried [...] "such hokum mush as the familiar wedding scene and {{the ghost of a}} mother who returns at intervals to keep her son from error, but a cocktail party chatterbox number paraphrased from an old Noël Coward movie, a college number dittoed from an earlier George Abbott one, and various other elements hardly rivaling the daisy in freshness". [...] In Theatre Arts, Cecil Smith called Allegro [...] "acceptable only as an exercise in stagecraft, not as a work of art... Allegro fails where Our Town succeeded... Joseph Taylor, Jr.'s life has little or nothing <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> about our own lives." [...] Louis Kronenberger of New York P.M. called the show [...] "an out-and-out failure." ...|$|E
500|$|Clayton's {{findings}} did {{not have}} any practical application {{until the end of the}} 18th century. The gas produced during the coking of coal was allowed to escape unused until William Murdoch began to promote coal gas as an illuminant. Other such experiments, though limited in depth, had been done by: George Dixon in 1780 in Cockfield, Jean-Pierre Minckelers in 1785 in Louvain, and Archibald Cochrane in 1787 at his estate Culross Abbey. The true prototypes for later gasworks were first constructed in 1802 at the Soho Foundry and in 1805 at George Lee's cotton mill in Salford close to Manchester. However innovative the new technology, it was met with great skepticism by many critics. As late as 1810 Murdock was asked in a committee of the House of Commons: [...] "Do you mean <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> that it will be possible to have a light without a wick?" [...] Not until the second decade of the 19th century did gaslight spread from industrial mills to urban street lighting and domestic lighting. Accum played a crucial role in this unfolding revolution.|$|E
25|$|As a contemporary, {{and one of}} {{the chief}} kings in Scotland, Bridei appears in Adomnán's Life of Saint Columba. Adomnán's account of Bridei is {{problematic}} in that it fails <b>to</b> <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> whether Bridei was already a Christian, and if not, whether Columba converted him. The recent archaeological discoveries at Portmahomack, showing that there was a monastic community perhaps as early as the late 6th century, may provide some support for the idea that Bridei was either already a Christian, at least in name, or was converted by Columba.|$|R

500|$|Karen is {{voiced by}} American actress Jill Talley, {{who is also}} the wife of SpongeBob's voice actor, Tom Kenny. Talley uses a Midwestern accent for the character. Whenever Karen talks, her voice is mixed over {{electronic}} sound effects by the series' audio engineers to create a robotic sound. Her voice, which was more monotonous in earlier episodes, has been described as [...] "deadpan" [...] by the Associated Press. Some of Karen's conversations with Plankton are improvised between Talley and Lawrence. The latter described this improvisation as one of his [...] "favorite part of the voice over" [...] in 2009. He elaborated in a 2012 interview, saying, [...] "I always enjoy the back-and-forth. [...] start to actually overlap so much talking to each other that [...] have <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us,</b> 'hey, stop doing that, separate what you're saying!'"

500|$|Thomas Conner {{from the}} Chicago Sun-Times neither praised nor criticized the song, but instead {{focused on the}} steamy nature of the composition. [...] " [...] and panting duet partner Drake steam the {{recording}} studio windows as he raps a helpless play-by-play". Bill Lamb from About.com gave the song a positive review, saying that [...] "There it is, the chorus opens the track with [...] "Oh na na...what's my name?" [...] and the hook is firmly implanted. It's not long before Drake's added on rap kicks in with clever, sexy and romantic rhyming. Then the dreamy drum machine rhythms and Rihanna's vocals kick in again. This is a hit... "What's My Name?" [...] is a good addition to that romantic evening playlist." [...] Jocelyn Vena from MTV praised the [...] "song's chorus" [...] and [...] "Drake's verse". Molly Lambert of Pitchfork Media praised Rihanna's performance saying that [...] "On 'What's My Name', Rihanna doesn't have <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> how desirable she is – it is a given. There is never any doubt in her delivery that Rihanna really {{might as well be}} the only girl in the world".|$|E
500|$|In April 2011 {{before the}} release of Thor (2011), Marvel Studios {{president}} Kevin Feige stated that following The Avengers (2012), [...] "Thor will go off into a new adventure."

I shall wait for the audience <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> whether {{there should be a}} second one, and then if that's a nice conversation to be had [...] all of us, that'd be thrilling. But I've got too much Irish superstitious blood in me to assume that Thor 2 will happen. But if Marvel says so, then I guess it must be true". Feige later explained that Marvel Studios would gauge how well Thor did at the box office before announcing sequels, but stated, [...] "Don Payne is working on story ideas for a part two. We've got various options with Ken [...] to discuss coming back, but right now {{the focus is on the}} first one.

500|$|Mr. Lawrence had met Hillenburg {{previously}} on Rocko's Modern Life. When {{working on}} the pilot episode of SpongeBob, Hillenburg invited him to audition {{for all of the}} characters. Since other voices had been found for the main cast already, Lawrence started out by voicing a variety of minor characters. This included Plankton, who was initially only set to appear in one episode. Mr. Lawrence recalls that Nickelodeon executives told Hillenburg, [...] "'we could stunt-cast this. You know, we could have Bruce Willis do this voice.' And Steve was just like, 'it's Doug , don't you hear it? This is the character! This is the guy!'" [...] Jill Talley, Tom Kenny's wife, voices Karen Plankton. Being a Chicago native, she uses a Midwestern accent for the character. Electronic sound effects are underlaid by the series' audio engineers to create a robotic sound whenever she speaks. Talley and Mr. Lawrence often improvise Plankton and Karen's dialogue. Lawrence called improvisation his [...] "favorite part of the voice over" [...] in 2009. He elaborated in a 2012 interview, saying, [...] "I always enjoy the back-and-forth.

500|$|... "Eh, Eh" [...] {{was first}} {{performed}} in a beatbox version at the Cherrytree Studios and was released on Gaga's first EP, The Cherrytree Sessions. [...] "Eh, Eh" [...] was majorly performed at Gaga's The Fame Ball Tour in the second segment. Gaga {{was dressed in a}} white body plate leotard with black lightning shaped stripes and wore a hat made of toppled dominoes. It was accompanied by open toe shoe-boots and fishnet stockings on her leg. As the performance of previous song [...] "Money Honey" [...] ended Gaga appeared on the stage beside Space Cowboy on a Vespa whence the music for [...] "Eh, Eh" [...] starts. The backdrops change to reveal lightning shapes in contrast to the sunny nature of the song. Gaga sang the song in its actual form backed by vocals from DJ Space Cowboy who spun the music from a corner of the stage. As the song reached the chorus Gaga asked the crowd to join her while singing and wave their arms. The New York Times called the live performance as listless. However, The Hollywood Reporter said of the performance that, [...] "In an age of too much information, one of the most refreshing things about Gaga is her mystery.
