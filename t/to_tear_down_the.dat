5|$|Despite Reagan urging Gorbachev <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Berlin Wall, {{there are}} some such as Romesh Ratnesar of Time who commented {{that there is little}} {{evidence}} that the speech had any impact on the decision <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> wall, let alone an impact on the people he addressed. Another critic was Liam Hoare in a 2012 article in The Atlantic, who pointed to the many reasons for the tendency for American media to focus on the significance of this particular speech, without weighing the complexity of the events as they unfolded in both East and West Germany and the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|After {{losing their}} first five games, Maryland beat South Carolina on Homecoming weekend, 21–15, which {{prompted}} Maryland fans <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> goalposts in celebration. In the 25-mile per hour winds, the Terrapins capitalized on the Gamecocks' poor punting game, which included one blocked punt.|$|E

5|$|A {{touchdown}} pass reception by end Dale Van Sickel {{of more than}} 30 yards provided another score in the third period, followed by Brumbaugh's extra point kick. To close the third quarter, fullback Rainey Cawthon made a 40-yard broken field run. On the first play of the fourth quarter, Crabtree passed to Brumbaugh for another score, but Brumbaugh's extra point attempt was blocked by the Bulldogs. In {{the middle of the}} fourth quarter, Gator fans rushed the field <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> goal posts, and fist fights broke out between Georgia and Florida fans.|$|E
5|$|Districts {{established}} under U.S. {{federal guidelines}} generally {{begin the process}} of designation through a nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. The National Register is the official recognition by the U.S. government of cultural resources worthy of preservation. While designation through the National Register does offer a district or property some protections, it is only in cases where the threatening action involves the federal government. If the federal government is not involved, then the listing on the National Register provides the site, property or district no protections. For example, if company A wants <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> hypothetical Smith House and company A is under contract with the state government of Illinois, then the federal designation would offer no protections. If, however, company A was under federal contract the Smith House would be protected. A federal designation is little more than recognition by the government that the resource is worthy of preservation.|$|E
25|$|After the Joint Declaration in 1984, the PRC allowed British {{authorities}} to demolish the City and resettle its inhabitants.

40|$|The paper puts {{forward a}} {{decision}} modeling {{by appealing to}} a vectorization system, similar to one used in aviation – Instrument Landing System (ILS). The decisioncockpit developed by this paper implies a two angle vectorization system: the exogenous system, meaning the system where the independent variables are included and the endogenous system, of which the causal factors are part. The model keeps the main feature, that of being a display of reality. 	Theentire argument comes <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>tearing</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> decision making process and reconstructing it so as to solve its structure problems and to accentuate the points at issue where it makes a change – so as to adjust to reform practices - and how important is this change for the PA reform...|$|R

25|$|Several years later, Brugsen, a Danish {{chain of}} supermarkets, bought Folkets Hus, {{planning}} <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> building {{and build a}} supermarket in its place. However, as this was prohibited due to the historic importance of the place, Brugsen sold the ground to the folk music ensemble Tingluti in 1978. As a consequence of a burst water main which {{they could not afford}} to repair, Tingluti had to sell the ground to the municipality of Copenhagen. The price at the time was DKK 700,000.|$|E
25|$|The City of Miami {{embarked}} {{on a plan to}} extensively renovate the stadium. However, those plans fell by the wayside as Miami focused on keeping the Florida Marlins in town, forcing the Hurricanes to threaten a move to Dolphin Stadium (now Hard Rock Stadium) in suburban Miami Gardens if a plan to renovate the stadium were not in place within 45days.

In April 2008, a panel in the Center's adjacent parking garage fell and crushed a car. As {{a result of this}} incident, the building owners decided <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> garage constructed in 1973 {{and replace it with a}} six-story, precast concrete garage.

25|$|The {{enlargement}} of the club's library, {{and the fact of}} its growing postgraduate or honorary membership roll, compelled it {{from time to time to}} enlarge its accommodations.

The new structure is of brick, handsomely trimmed in stone, and rises to the height of four stories, with about seventy or eighty feet of frontage on Harvard street. Two large stores claim a part of the ground floor, but they do not encroach on the broad and handsome entrance to the club's apartments.|$|E

25|$|In the {{intervening}} period, AMC replaced Kaplan's race program contact with two new men (Chris Schoenlip and John Voelbel from Lever Brothers (soap marketing people)), {{who had no}} experience in the automotive field and were ignorant of {{anything to do with}} racing. They would ultimately prove to be more trouble than they were worth. In fact, it was these two new boys who failed to enter the parts into the official AMC parts system and to submit homologation papers. The importance of this mistake became clear when Kaplan sent the first car to run at the first race of the 1969 season at Jackson, Michigan. Kaplan sent one of the older 1968 cars with a new engine, but, because they were late and had not qualified, the team had to do some consensus building among the other racers to permit them to enter at all. When the SCCA agreed to let them run, they started last, but, within 10 laps, they were chasing Donohue down and the time differential was narrowing rapidly. After the race, the SCCA asked to see the engine, but he had sent the cars home already. At Lime Rock, the SCCA wanted <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> engines before they could start the race. Kaplan bought some time by countering with the challenge that they would have <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Camaros and Mustangs too. That wasn’t going to happen, so they were allowed to run. It was clear, however, that the problems with the SCCA weren’t going away, at least until the parts could be homologated.|$|E
25|$|The three bridges are {{the only}} ones of their type still extant in Lee County, Illinois.

25|$|On October 17, 1989, an {{earthquake}} measuring 6.9 on the moment magnitude scale struck on the San Andreas Fault near Loma Prieta Peak in the Santa Cruz mountains, approximately 70 miles (113km) south of San Francisco, {{a few minutes}} before Game 3 of the 1989 World Series was scheduled to begin at Candlestick Park. The quake severely damaged many of the city's freeways including the Embarcadero Freeway and the Central Freeway. Mayor Agnos made the controversial decision <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Embarcadero Freeway, opening the waterfront but eventually shifting Chinatown voters away from him and costing him re-election in 1991. The quake also caused extensive damage in the Marina District and the South of Market neighborhoods.|$|E
