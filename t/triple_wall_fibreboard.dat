50|$|The {{capital was}} Vaishali, a prosperous city. In the {{introductory}} {{portion of the}} Ekapanna Jataka, Vaishali was described as encompassed by a <b>triple</b> <b>wall</b> with the three gates with watch towers. The main gosthas were the Licchavis, Mallas and Śakyas. Around 600 BCE, the Licchavis were disciples of Mahavira and Gautama Buddha. During their lifetimes, both Mahavira and Gautama Buddha visited Vaishali several times.|$|R
50|$|Igboho {{was founded}} by Alaafin Eguguojo as {{the capital of the}} Oyo Empire in the 16th century while the Oyo had been driven from their {{previous}} capital of Oyo-Ile by their Nupe enemies. It had strong natural defenses and was surrounded by <b>triple</b> <b>walls,</b> allowing the Oyo to resist the Nupe. It remained the Oyo capital for Eguguojo's successors until Oyo-Ile was reoccupied by Abipa.|$|R

50|$|Based {{upon the}} burial {{remains of the}} South Room Block, it was {{inhabited}} by people of prestige and status. More than 40 people's remains were found below {{the floor of the}} central room. The South Room Block also had a community room (20 by 20 ft) that was built sturdily with double and <b>triple</b> <b>walls.</b> In the plazas outside the room blocks were ramadas, outdoor work areas, adobe-lined fire pits, middens, and a cremation area. There were also several pit-houses.|$|R

50|$|Vitrified forts are {{generally}} situated on hills offering strong defensive positions. Their form {{seems to have}} been determined by the contour of the flat summits which they enclose. The walls vary in size, a few being upwards of 12 ft high, and are so broad that they present the appearance of embankments. Weak parts of the defence are strengthened by double or <b>triple</b> <b>walls,</b> and occasionally vast lines of ramparts, composed of large blocks of unhewn and unvitrified stones, envelop the vitrified centre at some distance from it. The walls themselves are termed vitrified ramparts.|$|R
5000|$|Muyuq Marka, also Muyuqmarka (Quechua, hispanicized spellings [...] Moyoc Marca, Muyucmarca, Muyuqmarca, Muyucmarka, Muyuc Marca, Muyuc Marka), is {{an archaeological}} site in Peru. It is a round Incan building, which is {{situated}} within the fortress Saksaywaman above Cuzco. It {{was used as}} a Temple of the Sun, but became part of a complex of rectangular buildings which mostly still remain today.However, the temple and the two flanking towers were dismantled during the Spanish rule. What remains of Muyuq Marka indicates that it was [...] "a round building with an open central court which had a fountain." [...] The temple had <b>triple</b> <b>walls,</b> which were aligned with the zenith sunrise and the antizenith sunset.|$|R
50|$|Soon {{after they}} started their descent into the Underworld, the Sibyl showed the golden bough to Charon who only then {{allowed them to}} enter his boat and cross the Stygian river. On the other side, she cast a drugged cake to the three-headed {{watchdog}} Cerberus, who swallowed it and fell asleep. Once in the Underworld, Aeneas tried talking to some shades, {{and listened to the}} Sibyl speak of places, like Tartarus, where he saw a large prison, fenced by a <b>triple</b> <b>wall,</b> with wicked men being punished, and bordered by the fiery river Phlegethon. At Pluto’s palace, Aeneas put the golden bough on the arched door, and went through to the Elysian Fields, the abode of those who led just and useful lives.|$|R
60|$|Ronda was {{considered}} as impregnable. It was {{situated in the}} heart of wild and rugged mountains, and perched upon an isolated rock crested by a strong citadel, with <b>triple</b> <b>walls</b> and towers. A deep ravine, or rather a perpendicular chasm of the rocks, of frightful depth, surrounded three parts of the city; through this flowed the Rio Verde, or Green River. There were two suburbs to the city, fortified by walls and towers, and almost inaccessible from the natural asperity of the rocks. Around this rugged city were deep rich valleys, sheltered by the mountains, refreshed by constant streams, abounding with grain and the most delicious fruits, and yielding verdant meadows, in which was reared a renowned breed of horses, the best in the whole kingdom for a foray.|$|R
5000|$|Constantinople {{had been}} in {{existence}} for 874 years {{at the time of}} the Fourth Crusade and was the largest and most sophisticated city in Christendom. Almost alone amongst major medieval urban centres, it had retained the civic structures, public baths, forums, monuments, and aqueducts of classical Rome in working form. At its height, the city held an estimated population of about half a million people [...] behind thirteen miles of <b>triple</b> <b>walls.</b> Its planned location made Constantinople not only the capital of the surviving eastern part of the Roman Empire but also a commercial centre that dominated trade routes from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea, China, India and Persia.As a result, it was both a rival and a tempting target for the aggressive new states of the west, notably the Republic of Venice.|$|R
50|$|The {{church was}} heavily vandalized in 2005, leaving a large {{hole in the}} <b>triple</b> mason <b>walls,</b> {{and all of the}} windows broken, many beyond recognition. The burdens of {{maintaining}} the church as well as repairing the damage are more than can be covered by the current caretaker, so much of the damage is still evident.|$|R
25|$|Metal liners may be {{stainless}} steel, aluminum, or {{galvanized iron}} {{and may be}} flexible or rigid pipes. Stainless steel is made in several types and thicknesses. Type 304 is used with firewood, wood pellet fuel, and non-condensing oil appliances, types 316 and 321 with coal, and type AL 29-4C is used with non-condensing gas appliances. Stainless steel liners must have a cap and be insulated if they service solid fuel appliances, but following the manufacturer's instructions carefully. Aluminum and galvanized steel chimneys are known as class A and class B chimneys. Class A are either an insulated, double wall stainless steel pipe or <b>triple</b> <b>wall,</b> air-insulated pipe often known by its genericized trade name Metalbestos. Class B are uninsulated double wall pipes often called B-vent, and are only used to vent non-condensing gas appliances. These may have an aluminum inside layer and galvanized steel outside layer. Condensing boilers do not need a chimney.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{not known}} exactly when Dún Aonghasa was built, though it is now thought {{that most of the}} {{structures}} date from the Bronze Age and Iron Age. T. F. O'Rahilly surmised in what is known O'Rahilly's historical model that it was built in the second century BC by the Builg following the Laginian conquest of Connacht. Excavations at the site indicate that the first construction goes back to 1100 BC, when the first enclosure was erected by piling rubble against large upright stones. Around 500 BC, the <b>triple</b> <b>wall</b> defences were probably built along the western side of the fort. [...] The 19th-century artist George Petrie called Dún Aonghasa [...] "the most magnificent barbaric monument in Europe." [...] Its name, meaning [...] "Fort of Aonghas", may refer to the pre-Christian god of the same name described in Irish mythology, or the mythical king, Aonghus mac Úmhór. It has thus traditionally been associated with the Fir Bolg.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. The Englishman {{left the}} Place behind, {{and left the}} streets behind, and left the civilian-inhabited town behind, and descended down among the {{military}} works of Vauban, hemming all in. As {{the shadow of the}} first heavy arch and postern fell upon him and was left behind, as the shadow of the second heavy arch and postern fell upon him and was left behind, as his hollow tramp over the first drawbridge was succeeded by a gentler sound, as his hollow tramp over the second drawbridge was succeeded by a gentler sound, as he overcame the stagnant ditches one by one, and passed out where the flowing waters were and where the moonlight, so the dark shades and the hollow sounds and the unwholesomely locked currents of his soul were vanquished and set free. See to it, Vaubans of your own hearts, who gird them in with <b>triple</b> <b>walls</b> and ditches, and with bolt and chain and bar and lifted bridge,--raze those fortifications, and lay them level with the all-absorbing dust, before the night cometh when no hand can work! ...|$|R
50|$|In Roman mythology, Tartarus is {{the place}} where sinners are sent. Virgil {{describes}} it in the Aeneid as a gigantic place, surrounded by the flaming river Phlegethon and <b>triple</b> <b>walls</b> to prevent sinners from escaping from it. It is guarded by a hydra with fifty black gaping jaws, which sits at a screeching gate protected by columns of solid adamantine, a substance akin to diamond - so hard that nothing will cut through it. Inside, there is a castle with wide walls, and a tall iron turret. Tisiphone, one of the Erinyes who represents revenge, stands guard sleepless {{at the top of this}} turret lashing a whip. There is a pit inside which is said to extend down into the earth twice as far as the distance from the lands of the living to Olympus. At the bottom of this pit lie the Titans, the twin sons of Aloeus, and many other sinners. Still more sinners are contained inside Tartarus, with punishments similar to those of Greek myth.|$|R
5000|$|Construction of the Walls of Constantinople began under Constantine the Great, who {{enlarged}} {{the previously}} existing walls of Byzantium {{in order to}} defend the new Roman capital city which quickly grew following its proclamation as Nova Roma. A new set of walls was built further west {{during the reign of}} Theodosius II, and rebuilt after an earthquake in 447 in their current shape. The sea walls in the Seraglio Point area, which have continuously existed since Lygos and Byzantium, are the oldest part of the city walls; while the <b>triple</b> land <b>walls</b> of Theodosius II at the western end of the city are the strongest parts. The northwestern section of the land walls was built in 627, during the reign of Heraclius, in order to accommodate the suburb of Blachernae, and added to by later emperors. The city walls had 55 gates, the largest of which was the Porta Aurea (Golden Gate), the ceremonial entrance gate used by the Emperors, at the southwestern end of the <b>triple</b> land <b>walls,</b> close to the Sea of Marmara. Unlike the city walls which were built of brick and limestone, the Porta Aurea was built of large clean-cut white marble blocks in order to distinguish it from the rest, and a quadriga with elephant statues stood on its top. The doors of the Porta Aurea were made of gold, hence the name, which means [...] "Golden Gate" [...] in Latin. In 1458 the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II built the Yedikule ("Seven Towers") Castle to defend the Porta Aurea, which was incorporated into this castle and still stands {{as a part of the}} pentagon-shaped layout of the castle walls. The Column of Marcian (Kıztaşı) erected by Marcianus (reigned 450-457) dates from the same period as the <b>triple</b> land <b>walls</b> of Theodosius II.|$|R

50|$|A mythical founder Coragino, {{companion}} of Ulysses, is a medieval invention recounted in the fourteenth-century Conto di Corciano e di Perugia. With the unsettled conditions of Late Antiquity, the inhabitants withdrew to the defensible hilltop site that controlled the valley that communicated between Lake Trasimeno {{and the upper}} Tiber valley. Its curving concentric street system is testimony to the three encircling walls that protected the community. Like virtually all early walled villages, the Corcianesi were {{under the control of}} the bishop, in this case the bishop of Perugia, whose rights to the castrum de Corciano were confirmed by Pope Innocent II in 1136; Corciano appears in a list of castelli belonging to Perugia, 1258. A visit by Francis of Assisi is commemorated, after his canonisation, in a church dedicated to him, which retains traces of its fourteenth and fifteenth-century frescoes. The tower of the comune, built in the thirteenth century, rises from the highest point. The <b>triple</b> <b>walls</b> and strategic site of Corciano made it a desirable stronghold in the constant warfare of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries: in 1364 the little town was sacked by the Compania Bianca in the service of Cardinal Albornoz; in 1416 the condottiero Braccio Fortebraccio of Montone laid siege to Corciano, which resisted successfully but capitulated to him when he returned for a second attempt.|$|R
50|$|As a {{fine example}} of Italianate {{architecture}} the Beach House has drawn comparison with what {{is considered to be a}} landmark example of the style in the Morse-Libby House. Many of the elements displayed on the Beach House contribute to its fine architectural quality. The house also displays some significant construction techniques, such as its <b>triple</b> thick brick <b>walls</b> with airspaces between them to help provide insulation.|$|R
60|$|This {{city was}} a great place whereof the houses were built of mud and {{thatched}} with reeds. It stood upon a wide plain and in its centre rose a natural, rocky hill upon the crest of which, fashioned of blocks of gleaming marble and roofed with a metal that shone as gold, was {{the temple of the}} Grasshopper, a columned building very like to those of Egypt. Round it also were other public buildings, among them the palace of the Karoon, the whole being surrounded by <b>triple</b> marble <b>walls</b> as a protection from attack by foes. Never had I seen anything so beautiful as that hill with its edifices of shining white roofed with gold or copper and gleaming in the sun.|$|R
40|$|All {{spacecraft}} in Earth orbit {{are exposed}} to the risk of impact with micrometeoroids and orbital debris. When such particles have enough energy to penetrate the hull of the vehicle, clouds of fragments are ejected into spacecraft and they can eventually compromise the functionality of various components encountered in their flight path. Knowledge of the clouds' properties (e. g. fragments mass and velocity) is therefore a key factor to obtain accurate predictions of the response of interior equipment to space debris threat. However, generation and evolution of debris clouds from hypervelocity impact is a complex phenomenon governed by a large number of parameters, and existing models mostly refer to fragments originated by impact on simple aluminium plates only, while the few models available for sandwich panels do not provide information on the fragments mass. In such context, this paper presents an engineering model describing debris clouds created by space debris impacts on honeycomb sandwich panels representative of satellites structural bodies. The model consists of a set of empirical equations providing three pieces of information, i. e. the geometric description of the cloud, the velocity distribution and the mass distribution of the fragments. The proposed equations are derived from analogous formulas for debris clouds originated by impacts on simple aluminium plates, by applying proper corrections to account for different materials effects and different behaviour of sandwich panels compared to plates of same material. The model is finally evaluated by comparing its predictions with few experimental data on <b>triple</b> <b>wall</b> structures (sandwich panel plus internal equipment cover plate), where debris clouds exiting the panels’ rear skin are used to assess the failure of the third wall. In this latter case, the proposed model is also compared with the SRL equations...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of honeycomb cells in a dual-wall structure is advantageous for mechanical performance and low weight in spacecraft primary structures but detrimental for shielding against impact of micrometeoroid and orbital debris particles (MMOD). The {{presence of}} honeycomb cell walls acts {{to restrict the}} expansion of projectile and bumper fragments, resulting in {{the impact of a}} more concentrated (and thus lethal) fragment cloud upon the shield rear wall. The Multipurpose Laboratory Module (MLM) is a Russian research module scheduled for launch and ISS assembly in 2011 (currently under review). Baseline shielding of the MLM is expected to be predominantly {{similar to that of the}} existing Functional Energy Block (FGB), utilizing a baseline <b>triple</b> <b>wall</b> configuration with honeycomb sandwich panels for the dual bumpers and a thick monolithic aluminum pressure wall. The MLM module is to be docked to the nadir port of the Zvezda service module and, as such, is subject to higher debris flux than the FGB module (which is aligned along the ISS flight vector). Without upgrades to inherited shielding, the MLM penetration risk is expected to be significantly higher than that of the FGB module. Open-cell foam represents a promising alternative to honeycomb as a sandwich panel core material in spacecraft primary structures as it provides comparable mechanical performance with a minimal increase in weight while avoiding structural features (i. e. channeling cells) detrimental to MMOD shielding performance. In this study, the effect of replacing honeycomb sandwich panel structures with metallic open-cell foam structures on MMOD shielding performance is assessed for an MLM-representative configuration. A number of hypervelocity impact tests have been performed on both the baseline honeycomb configuration and upgraded foam configuration, and differences in target damage, failure limits, and derived ballistic limit equations are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Beyond the portico is {{the banking}} chamber, {{a large room}} {{approximately}} 11 metres long and seven metres wide with four metre high ceilings. It occupies the entire enclosed space of the building {{for most of its}} length. The walls are lined with vertically jointed pine boards and there is a profiled picture rail in line {{with the head of the}} windows. Ceilings are of plaster with cornices and decorative ceiling roses that remain. Skirtings, architraves and cornices in the chamber have multiple stepped profiles. To the rear of the chamber a full height <b>wall</b> of perforated <b>fibreboard,</b> is a later addition, built in line with the front of the strong room, which remains with its original door in place.

60|$|At a short {{distance}} from Coel was the fortress of Alighur, which was considered to be almost impregnable. It was defended by a <b>triple</b> line of <b>walls</b> and fortifications, so that an enemy entering it would have to advance by a devious route from one gate to another, exposed all the time to a terrible artillery fire. It was almost surrounded by a swamp, and the only approach was along a narrow strip of firm ground, leading to the gate.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{obstacle}} {{on the way to}} the commercial fusion reactor based on the tokamak configuration is disruptions, which are abrupt terminations of the plasma discharge. Being not mitigated they can cause severe damage to the machine. For future large devices, like ITER and DEMO, strong electromagnetic loads on the vacuum vessel during disruptions pose a threat to their structural integrity. Some estimates for ITER give alarming hundred MN, but the lack of the predictive theory including all the effects into account, raise a concern about the accuracy of these evaluations. The largest forces are observed when plasma touches the wall. Their amplitudes depend on the halo currents, which are the part of the plasma current flowing into the conducting structures and then returning back into the plasma. Uncertainties in the halo current distribution and dynamics are a challenge for the theoretical modelling. The first part of this thesis presents the calculations of the EM force acting on the vacuum vessel within single-mode cylindrical approximation and the analysis of the interplay between eddy currents, plasma surface currents and halo currents. The second part of the thesis is dedicated to the most dangerous instabilities that can lead to a disruption: the resistive wall mode RWM and the tearing mode. In the presence of the resistive wall both can be suppressed or partially mitigated by the plasma rotation. This effect is studied analytically for configurations with positive and negative magnetic shear. For the advance tokamak scenario with hollow equilibrium current profile the influence of the differential plasma rotation on the double tearing mode stability is analyzed. The double and <b>triple</b> <b>wall</b> assemblies with different parameters are considered with respect to the problem of the magnetic island locking. In particular, a simple analytical formula for the electromagnetic torque acting on the plasma is derived for the ITER wall arrangement with double vacuum vessel and blanket. ...|$|R
40|$|Performing a Scherk-Schwarz {{dimensional}} {{reduction of}} D = 11 supergravity on a three-dimensional group manifold we construct five D = 8 gauged maximal supergravities whose gauge groups are the three-dimensional (non-) compact subgroups of SL(3, R). These cases include the Salam-Sezgin SO(3) gauged supergravity. We construct the most general half-supersymmetric domain wall solutions to these five gauged supergravities. The generic form is a <b>triple</b> domain <b>wall</b> solution whose truncations lead to double and single domain wall solutions.
