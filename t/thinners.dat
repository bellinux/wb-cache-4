This period {{was marked by}} dark soundscaping and assaulting beat constructions, culminating in 2006 {{with the release of}} Intrusion on Isolate Records. The music of Intrusion is noted for its hyper-intensity, sonic density and high production values. It contains remixes by Polish cybercore artist Neurocore and Belgian musician Imminent. Luca Maini of Igloo Magazine summarized the album's sound as [...] "Somatic Responses mangled and speeded up to create a teeth-grinding industrial monster, ultra processed and with thousands of razor sharp beats packed together. .... This is the perfect music if you like Richard Devine but you think he should stick to the smashing stuff he performs live, or maybe you think Venetian Snares is a genius but he's gone too melodic." [...] UndaCova has remixed tracks by Danny Kreutzfeldt, White Nois Stasis and Diagram of Suburban Chaos, and is also featured on the Mirex Carbon compilation, <b>Thinner's</b> Recore remix album, Somia's Miad, and the Polymorphik Piece series released on PuZZling Rec.

THE MAGNETORESISTANCE AND THE HALL COEFFICIENT HAVE ALSO BEEN MEASURED AS A FUNCTION OF THE TEMPERATURE AND THE MAGNETIC FIELD (0 - 6 T). THE RESISTANCE WAS FOUND TO INCREASE LOGARITHMICALLY AS THE TEMPERATURE DECREASES. THIS BEHAVIOUR IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH BOTH THE WEAK LOCALIZATION (WL) AND THE ELECTRON-ELECTRON INTERACTIONS (EEI).

40|$|Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) {{applications}} {{can provide}} the data collection necessary for rapid structural assessment after an event such as a natural disaster puts the reliability of civil infrastructure in question. Unfortunately, there are many technical challenges associated with employing such a WSN in civil infrastructure for operation over multiple decades with maintenance costs low enough to justify the integration of such a WSN into a given structure. The technical challenges include ensuring power is maintained at the sensor nodes, reducing installation and maintenance costs, and automating the collection and analysis of data provided by a wireless sensor network. In this work a new WSN paradigm to address these challenges is presented. The new WSN paradigm is called the "mobile host" WSN. In a mobile host WSN, the sensor nodes are placed on the structure with no internal electrical power source. Instead the node is equipped with hardware to collect energy delivered to it wirelessly by a mobile host on an as-needed basis in order to perform its intended data acquisition and interrogation functions. When an event of interest occurs which might compromise {{the integrity of the}} structure, the sensor nodes capture relevant data from the event. In order to collect the data captured by the sensor network, a "mobile host" is sent to each sensor node and wirelessly charges it up. Once the sensor node is fully charged, it turns on and transmits its data wirelessly to the mobile host. The mobile host receives and stores the data and then implements appropriate structural health monitoring (SHM) data interrogation algorithms. If deemed necessary the mobile host then proceeds to interrogate other sensor nodes of interest on the structure. In this way a remote system is presented that can then be used to make a health assessment of the structure. This dissertation addresses the research challenges encountered when implementing a mobile host Won. A sensor node (<b>THINNER)</b> capable of collecting data tirelessly in the absence of electrical power was developed. A peak displacement and bolted joint p reload sensor capable of interfacing with the <b>THINNER</b> sensor node were designed and implemented. A wireless energy delivery package capable of being carried by an airborne mobile host was developed. Lastly, the system engineering required to implement the overall sensor network was carried out. The culmination of this work resulted in the first field demonstration of a mobile host wireless sensor network. The field demonstration took place on an out-of-service, full-scale bridge near Truth- or-Consequences, New Mexic...|$|R

A GEOGRAPHIC AREA WAS COVERED ALL OPEN SEAS (NORTH AND SOUTH AEGEAN) AND THE MAIN GULFS (NORTH EUBOIKOS, SARONIKOS AND PAGASITIKOS). A COMPARISON OF SPECIES WITH OTHER AREAS (ADRIATIKA, BLACK SEA ETC) WAS DONE. GENERALITIES OF THE MORPHOLOGY, TAXONOMY ECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTION OF THE SIPHONOPHORES, AND HISTORICAL SURVEY OF RESEARCH IN THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA WERE GIVEN. A TOTAL OF 29 SPECIES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED, 11 OF WHICH ARE MENTIONED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN GREEK WATERS.

25|$|Any injury, {{such as a}} {{surgical}} operation, causes the body to increase the coagulation of the blood. Simultaneously, activity may be reduced. There is an increased probability of formation of clots in the veins of the legs, or sometimes the pelvis, particularly in the morbidly obese patient.

25|$|Death {{in those}} with a GI bleed is more {{commonly}} due to other illnesses (some of which {{may have contributed to}} the bleed, such as cancer or cirrhosis) than the bleeding itself. Of those admitted to a hospital because of a GI bleed, death occurs in about 7%. Despite treatment, re-bleeding occurs in about 7–16% of those with upper GI bleeding. In those with esophageal varices, bleeding occurs in about 5–15% a year and if they have bled once, there is a higher risk of further bleeding within six weeks. Testing and treating H. pylori if found can prevent re-bleeding {{in those with}} peptic ulcers. The benefits versus risks of restarting blood <b>thinners</b> such as aspirin or warfarin and anti-inflammatories such as NSAIDs need to be carefully considered. If aspirin is needed for cardiovascular disease prevention, it is reasonable to restart it within seven days in combination with a PPI for those with nonvariceal upper GI bleeding.|$|E
25|$|On April 2, 2016, the Lightning {{announced}} that Stamkos {{was diagnosed with}} thoracic outlet syndrome, {{which is the same}} injury that sidelined teammate Andrei Vasilevskiy {{at the start of the}} season. It is a condition that is rare among hockey players. Stamkos said that he first felt some discomfort in his arm after the game against the Montreal Canadiens. He is scheduled for surgery on Monday with Dr. Karl Illig, who performed Vasilevskiy's surgery. Lightning General Manager, Steve Yzerman, stated that there will be no long-term impact on Stamkos' health or his career. In addition, Yzerman indicated that Stamkos recovery time would be between one and three months, but they would have a better idea in a couple of weeks where he falls within that time frame. Yzerman also stated that the team's desire is for Stamkos to remain with the organization, which came after a question of whether Stamkos had played his last game in a Lightning uniform. On April 4, 2016, Stamkos had successful surgery at Tampa General Hospital. Stamkos' surgeon stated that they plan on evaluating him in approximately two weeks and that should clear up his prognosis. On May 26, 2016, Stamkos dressed for game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals against the Pittsburgh Penguins despite still being on blood <b>thinners</b> following surgery. He registered five shot attempts during the game, but the Lightning ultimately lost 2-1 and were eliminated from the playoffs.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{two basic}} types of valves {{that can be used}} for valve replacement, [...] and tissue valves. Modern {{mechanical}} valves can last indefinitely (the equivalent of over 50,000 years in an accelerated valve wear tester). However, current mechanical heart valves all require lifelong treatment with anticoagulants (blood <b>thinners),</b> e.g. warfarin, which requires monthly blood tests to monitor. This process of thinning the blood is called anticoagulation. Tissue heart valves, in contrast, do not require the use of anticoagulant drugs due to the improved blood flow dynamics resulting in less red cell damage and hence less clot formation. Their main weakness however, is their limited lifespan. Traditional tissue valves, made of pig heart valves, will last on average 15 years before they require replacement (but typically less in younger patients).|$|E
2500|$|A solvent (from the Latin , [...] "loosen, untie, solve") is a {{substance}} that dissolves a solute (a chemically distinct liquid, solid or gas), resulting in a solution. A solvent is usually a liquid but {{can also be a}} solid, a gas, or a supercritical fluid. The quantity of solute that can dissolve in a specific volume of solvent varies with temperature. Common uses for organic solvents are in dry cleaning (e.g. tetrachloroethylene), as paint <b>thinners</b> (e.g. toluene, turpentine), as nail polish removers and glue solvents (acetone, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate), in spot removers (e.g. hexane, petrol ether), in detergents (citrus terpenes) and in perfumes (ethanol). Water is a solvent for polar molecules and the most common solvent used by living things; all the ions and proteins in a cell are dissolved in water within a cell. Solvents find various applications in chemical, pharmaceutical, oil, and gas industries, including in chemical syntheses and purification processes.|$|E

2500|$|Surgery is {{curative}} of {{mitral valve}} regurgitation. [...] There are two surgical {{options for the}} treatment of MI: mitral valve replacement and mitral valve repair. Mitral valve repair is preferred to mitral valve replacement where a repair is feasible as bioprosthetic replacement valves have a limited lifespan of 10 to 15 years, whereas synthetic replacement valves require ongoing use of blood <b>thinners</b> {{to reduce the risk of}} stroke. [...] There are two general categories of approaches to mitral valve repair: [...] Resection of the prolapsed valvular segment (sometimes referred to as the 'Carpentier' approach), and installation of artificial chordae to [...] "anchor" [...] the prolapsed segment to the papillary muscle (sometimes referred to as the 'David' approach). [...] With the resection approach, any prolapsing tissue is resected, in effect removing the hole through which the blood is leaking. [...] In the artificial chordae approach, ePTFE (expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, or Gore-Tex) sutures are used to replace the broken or stretched chordae tendonae, bringing the natural tissue back into the physiological position, thus restoring the natural anatomy of the valve. [...] With both techniques, an annuloplasty ring is typically secured to the annulus, or opening of the mitral valve, to provide additional structural support. [...] In some cases, the [...] "double orifice" [...] (or 'Alfieri') technique for mitral valve repair, the opening of the mitral valve is sewn closed in the middle, leaving the two ends still able to open. This ensures that the mitral valve closes when the left ventricle pumps blood, yet allows the mitral valve to open at the two ends to fill [...] the left ventricle with blood before it pumps. [...] In general, mitral valve surgery [...] requires [...] "open-heart" [...] surgery in which the heart is arrested and the patient is placed on a heart-lung machine (cardiopulmonary bypass). [...] This allows the complex surgery to proceed in a still environment.|$|E
