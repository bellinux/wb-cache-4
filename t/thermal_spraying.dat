40|$|The {{consolidation}} of WC-Co powder with a ∼ 50 nanometer (nm) WC grain size (nWC) was investigated using high-velocity oxygen-fuel (HVOF) <b>thermal</b> <b>spray</b> deposition. Initial baseline data {{representative of the}} state-of-the-art of <b>thermal</b> <b>spray</b> deposition of WC-Co coatings was established using Diamalloy™ 2003, a premium grade WC-Co powder, and a Sulzer-Metco Diamond Jet™ (DJ) system. An increased understanding of the HVOF <b>thermal</b> <b>spray</b> process was established via a correlation of DJ process variables to the mechanisms of WC-Co coating defect formation. The critical HVOF process variables were identified as WC-Co particle size, DJ gun-to-substrate distance, DJ gun translation velocity, and powder feed rate, and a mechanism for controlled porosity formation in coatings was identified. These data were used to formulate a HVOF optimizing procedure which was used for DJ <b>thermal</b> <b>spray</b> of nWC-Co coatings. ^ As-synthesized nWC-Co particles are hollow shells with diameters of 25 – 125 μm. Incomplete matrix melting of as-synthesized nWC-Co occurred during W <b>thermal</b> <b>spray</b> and indicated the need for higher density particles. Heat treatments at 900 – 1400 °C reveal that insignificant densification of the hollow shell nWC-Co particles occurred prior to their sintering at contact points, and indicated that mechanical reprocessing was required. To this end a process using ultrasonic disintegration of nWC-Co powder and spray dry re-agglomeration was developed. ^ DJ <b>thermal</b> <b>spray</b> of reprocessed nWC-Co and nWC-Co+VC (vanadium carbide is a WC grain growth inhibitor) powders demonstrated that VC did not effect nWC grain size of coatings. DJ <b>thermal</b> <b>sprayed</b> nWC-Co coatings were near fully dense with a mean WC grain size of ∼ 200 nm, but displayed extensive nWC oxidation. The addition of 2. 5 and 5 wt % C during reprocessing of nWC- 8 Co powder significantly lowered the oxidation of nWC during DJ <b>thermal</b> <b>spray.</b> Addition of 5 wt % C produced a slightly lower nWC- 8 Co coating hardness than 2. 5 wt% C, due to η carbide formation. The W <b>thermal</b> <b>spray</b> of nWC- 8 Co- 2. 5 C powder using nitrogen DJ gun cooling demonstrated that exclusion of oxygen from the cooling gas caused a significant additional reduction in the oxidation of nWC, yielding a coating hardness value superior to Diamalloy 2003 coatings. ...|$|R
