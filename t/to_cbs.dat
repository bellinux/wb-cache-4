5|$|CBS began a shortwave {{listening}} {{program in}} September 1939, on an experimental basis, at the National Lawn Tennis Championships at West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills, New York. Engineers installed equipment at the CBS booth when the location {{was found to}} have good reception, and monitors relayed European shortwave news <b>to</b> <b>CBS</b> headquarters in New York between tennis matches. Throughout World War II, CBS captured Allied and enemy shortwave communications from more than 60 international stations via secretly located receivers. Translations of intercepted broadcasts were teletyped to all New York newspapers, Associated Press, United Press International and International News Service, and in turn disseminated to newspapers and radio stations throughout the United States. Major headline news frequently resulted, since big stories often broke first on radio.|$|E

When the band was first being signed <b>to</b> <b>CBS</b> Records, they refused to sign the band unless Mullen was fired. He was not, and as a result, his drumming became more integrated into the song structures. His experiences in the Artane Boys Band reportedly heavily contributed to the martial beat featured in many of U2's songs, helping to evoke military imagery.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{with the}} season premiere, filming {{of the show}} moved from Desilu Cahuenga, in Hollywood, California, <b>to</b> <b>CBS</b> Studio Center, in Studio City, Los Angeles, California. Tom Azzari worked as set {{designer}} during season two; he often re-used sets from the first season, because Castle Rock Entertainment had rented a large storage facility in which sets were stored, to save money. Although the scenes in Monk's Cafe were filmed at CBS Studio Center, the exterior of Tom's Restaurant, a diner {{at the intersection of}} Broadway and 112th Street in Manhattan, was used as the exterior for the cafe.

5|$|The Mask of Zorro was {{released}} in the United States on July 17, 1998 in 2,515 theaters, earning $22,525,855 in its opening weekend. The film dropped from its number one position in the second week with the releases of Saving Private Ryan and There's Something About Mary. The Mask of Zorro eventually earned $94,095,523 within the US, and $156,193,000 internationally, coming to a worldwide total of $250,288,523. With the commercial success of the film, Sony sold the TV rights of Zorro for $30 million in a joint deal <b>to</b> <b>CBS</b> and Turner Broadcasting System (TBS).|$|E
5|$|The Wiz {{proved to}} be a {{commercial}} failure, as the $24million production only earned $13.6million at the box office. Though prerelease television broadcast rights had been sold <b>to</b> <b>CBS</b> for over $10million, in the end, the film produced a net loss of $10.4million for Motown and Universal. At the time, it was the most expensive film musical ever made. The film's failure steered Hollywood studios away from producing the all-black film projects that had become popular during the blaxploitation era of the early to mid-1970s for several years.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} two {{specials}} under this new relationship aired on February 25, 1962 and was entitled The Judy Garland Show. This special, guest starring Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin, was nominated for four Emmys. Its success led <b>to</b> <b>CBS</b> signing Garland in December 1962 for her weekly series, premiering in fall 1963. Garland's second special was the awkwardly-titled Judy Garland and Her Guests Phil Silvers and Robert Goulet, presented in March 1963.

5|$|After his {{retirement}} {{as a player}} in 1994, Simms first joined ESPN {{then went on to}} join NBC's lead broadcast crew, teaming with Dick Enberg and Paul Maguire on that network's coverage of Super Bowl XXX and Super Bowl XXXII. Simms also announced Weightlifting at the 1996 Summer Olympics and served as a sideline reporter on the NBA on NBC for NBC Sports. In 1998, he moved <b>to</b> <b>CBS</b> with the AFC package, teaming first with Greg Gumbel (through the end of the 2003 season) and later with Jim Nantz on the CBS's lead broadcast team. He also worked with Armen Keteyian, Bonnie Bernstein and Lesley Visser. He hosts Inside the NFL on Showtime (another CBS holding) with James Brown and Cris Collinsworth. He has appeared on CBS Daytime since joining CBS, with a 2007 appearance as himself on the CBS soap opera As the World Turns, and in February 2010 an appearance on The Price Is Right (with Nantz) to present a Super Bowl XLIV showcase.

5|$|David Kaczynski {{had once}} admired and {{emulated}} his older brother, but had later {{decided to leave}} the survivalist lifestyle behind. He had received assurances from the FBI that he would remain anonymous and that his brother would not learn who had turned him in, but his identity was leaked <b>to</b> <b>CBS</b> News in early April 1996. CBS anchorman Dan Rather called FBI director Louis Freeh, who requested 24 hours before CBS broke the story on the evening news. The FBI scrambled to finish the search warrant and have it issued by a federal judge in Montana; afterwards, an internal leak investigation was conducted by the FBI, but the source of the leak was never identified. In 1996 the Evergreen Park Community High School was also placed on lockdown while FBI agents searched Kaczynski's school records. At the end of that school day, students were greeted by reporters asking how they felt about going to the same high school the Unabomber had attended. That night the news story was released to public.|$|E

40|$|The drug cytochalasin B (CB), which {{disrupts}} the cellular microfilament network, allows {{the identification of}} as yet unclassified structural differences between normal and Rous sarcoma virus-transformed chicken embryo fibroblasts. When exposed <b>to</b> <b>CB,</b> normal chick fibroblasts attain an arborized or dendritic morphology. This results as the cytoplasm collapses upon the remaining structural and adhesive components of the cell. Rous sarcoma virus-transformed cells did not form or maintain these dendritic-like processes {{in the presence of}} CB and, as a result, rounded up but still remained attached to the substrate. With a temperature-sensitive mutant of Rous sarcoma virus, LA 24 A, it was possible to show that these effects are completely reversible and dependent on the expression of pp 60 src. The cytoskeleton in these CB-treated cells was examined by both immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. After exposure <b>to</b> <b>CB,</b> the microfilaments were found to be disrupted similarly throughout both the transformed and the nontransformed cells. In the nontransformed cells arborized by exposure <b>to</b> <b>CB,</b> the extended processes were found to contain intermediate filaments in an unusually high concentration and degree of organization. The distribution of these filaments in the central body of the arborized cells was random. This lower concentration and random distribution was similar to that seen throughout the transformed cells rounded up by exposure <b>to</b> <b>CB.</b> The failure of these transformed cells <b>to</b> arborize in <b>CB</b> indicates that the structural component(s) which is necessary for the formation or maintenance or both of the arborized state is altered by the expression of pp 60 src...|$|R
