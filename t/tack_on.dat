At this point, Kyle McMahon began to move the Eagles, scoring on their next two possessions, including a TD pass to Kinsman Thomas for 77 yards. Mallett would respond with a 55-yard bomb to Cobi Hamilton, and Davis capped the drive two plays later {{to make it a}} 56-13 game. After another EMU score, Mallett would find Lucas Miller for a sixteen-yard score. EMU would <b>tack</b> <b>on</b> another score, but the Razorbacks prevailed in a 63-27 rout.|$|E

25|$|This was {{the first}} World Series game ever played in Colorado. At 4 hours 19 minutes, it became the longest nine-inning game in World Series history until game five of 2017. Game3 was also the 600th World Series game ever played. Starting pitcher Daisuke Matsuzaka pitched five innings of {{scoreless}} ball and left in the sixth with no runs allowed. The Red Sox struck first with a six-run third inning. Rookie Jacoby Ellsbury hit a leadoff double, moved to third on Dustin Pedroia's single, and scored on David Ortiz's double. After Manny Ramirez was intentionally walked, Mike Lowell's single scored two more runs. J. D. Drew popped out before Ramirez was thrown out at home on Jason Varitek's single with Lowell advancing to third. After Julio Lugo walked to load the bases, Matsuzaka hit a two-run single for his first base hit and RBI in the Major Leagues. Ellsbury capped the scoring with his second double of the inning and knock Colorado starter Josh Fogg out of the game. The Rockies' bats came {{to life in the}} sixth and seventh innings against a normally solid but shaky Boston bullpen. After Matsuzaka walked two straight in the sixth with one out, reliever Javier López allowed back-to-back RBI singles to Brad Hawpe and Yorvit Torrealba. Mike Timlin allowed two straight leadoff singles in the seventh before NLCS MVP Matt Holliday brought the Rockies to within one run with a three-run home run off Hideki Okajima. Brian Fuentes gave back those runs in the eighth by walking Lugo with one out and allowing a subsequent single to Coco Crisp before Ellsbury and Dustin Pedroia, who had four and three hits, respectively, on the night (the first time in World Series history two rookies had at least three hits in a game) hit back-to-back RBI doubles, raising Boston's lead to 9–5. Jonathan Papelbon came on for a four-out save, getting Holliday to fly out on one pitch, leaving runners on first and second. Jason Varitek would <b>tack</b> <b>on</b> Boston's tenth run {{in the top of the}} ninth off of LaTroy Hawkins with a sacrifice fly, scoring Mike Lowell who, not generally considered a stolen base threat, had just stolen third base, the first time a Red Sox baserunner stole third base in the World Series since 1975, after hitting a leadoff single and moving to second on a sacrifice bunt. Papelbon came back out in the bottom of the ninth to complete the save, getting the first two outs before surrendering a two-out triple to Brad Hawpe, then finishing the game with a groundout from Yorvit Torrealba. The Red Sox took Game3 by a final score of 10–5.|$|E
500|$|Collins saw the 1840 {{campaign}} as [...] "perhaps {{the last in}} which the parties focused on converting the newcomers rather than turning out the base and trying to <b>tack</b> <b>on</b> added support from the uncertain middle". Holt concurred that 1840 marked such a transition, [...] "After 1840 political leaders could predict how most men would vote. The question was whether they voted at all." [...] To ensure that they did, politicians began to stress {{the conflict between the}} parties, trying to ensure that voters would come to the polls even if they did not greatly care about the issues or candidates, so that they could inflict a defeat on the other party. The coalition that elected Harrison remained the foundation of the Whig Party until it dissolved amid sectional tensions over slavery in the 1850s.|$|E

The individual band members would work on material {{on their own and}} then bring in demos to which {{the other members of the}} band would contribute. Frontman Chris Cornell said that the band members allowed each other more freedom than on past records. Thayil observed that even though the band spent as much time writing and arranging as it had on previous albums, it spent a lot more time working on recording the songs. [...] After two albums with producer Terry Date, the band decided to seek another collaborator, as guitarist Kim Thayil said, [...] "We just thought we'd go for a change." [...] Eventually they settled on producer Michael Beinhorn, who [...] "didn't have his own trademark sound which he was trying to <b>tack</b> <b>on</b> to Soundgarden" [...] and had ideas the band approved.|$|E

500|$|The {{album that}} {{resulted}} is what many call the outlaw movement's first true record and Jennings' artistic zenith. [...] Almost {{all of the}} songs on Honky Tonk Heroes contain a defiant, restless longing for and celebration of the road ("Moving {{is the closest thing}} to being free...") and a rock and roll swagger that was entirely new in Nashville circles. [...] Although concept albums were not new in country music, with stars like Johnny Cash, Marty Robbins, and Porter Wagoner all having recorded LPs with unifying themes, Honky Tonk Heroes offered a more progressive take on the enterprise, resembling the albums Mickey Newbury had recently recorded and the blockbuster Red Headed Stranger album that Willie Nelson would release two years later. [...] In addition to Shaver's brooding compositions, Jennings rounded out the collection with the tender ballad [...] "We Had It All," [...] written by Kris Kristofferson keyboardist [...] "Funky" [...] Donnie Fritts. [...] According to Michael Striessguth's book Outlaw, RCA had asked Waylon to <b>tack</b> <b>on</b> one more song to augment the Shaver songs, in hopes of landing a hit single, and after considering Steve Young's [...] "Seven Bridges Road," [...] Jimmie Rodgers' [...] "T for Texas," [...] and Shel Silverstein's [...] "The Leaving Coming On," [...] Jennings opted for the Fritts tune, which would go on to be recorded and performed by Rod Stewart, Ray Charles, Bob Dylan, the Rolling Stones. [...] Released as a single, [...] "We Had it All", peaked at number 28 in Billboards Country Singles. [...] Jennings and Shaver also collaborated on the hit single [...] "You Asked Me To," [...] which spent fifteen weeks on the Billboard country singles charts, reaching a peak of number eight. [...] In the liner notes to The Essential Waylon Jennings, Wade Jessen quotes the singer: [...] "We wrote this one night in the dark over at Bobby Bare's office across the street from a Burger Boy where we'd been playing pinball. [...] Shaver said, 'I've got it started. [...] Let's finish it.' [...] We wrote it pretty well in the dark." [...] Shaver recorded his own version in 1977 for the album Gypsy Boy, with special guest Willie Nelson on guitar and vocals. [...] "You Asked Me To" [...] also appeared as the closing song on Elvis Presley's 1975 album Promised Land.|$|E

2500|$|Ade {{followed}} {{in the footsteps of}} his idol Mark Twain by making expert use of the American language. In his unique [...] "Fables in Slang," [...] which purveyed not so much slang as the American colloquial vernacular, Ade pursued an effectively genial satire notable for its scrupulous objectivity. [...] Ade's regular practice in the best fables is to present a little drama incorporating concrete, specific evidence with which he implicitly indicts the object of his satire—always a type (e.g., the social climber). [...] The fable's actual moral is nearly always implicit, though he liked to <b>tack</b> <b>on</b> a mock, often ironic moral (e.g., [...] "Industry and perseverance bring a sure reward").|$|E
2500|$|Having devoted most of {{his time}} to the {{jurisdictional}} arguments, he asked for some time to speak about the merits near the end. [...] "If we only knew what the school board would have done but for the phone call ," [...] Gottesman suggested, [...] "we know how to ... deal with this case." [...] The Court should follow precedent from civil-rights and labor law and put the burden of proving that on the defendant. Otherwise, [...] "every school board that wants to fire someone for a First Amendment reason, well ... no teacher can teach for five years without doing something somebody would find objectionable. Even though their motivation is solely the First Amendment reason, they'll <b>tack</b> <b>on</b> two or three other reasons." [...] At a justice's prompting, he likened it to the harmless error rule in appellate review.|$|E

After he received the Nobel Prize in 1956 his demeanor changed, as evidenced in his increasingly autocratic, erratic and hard-to-please management style. In late 1957, eight of Shockley's researchers, who would come to be known as the [...] "traitorous eight", resigned after Shockley decided not to continue research into silicon-based semiconductors. They went on to form Fairchild Semiconductor, a loss from which Shockley Semiconductor never recovered. Over the course of the next 20 years, more than 65 new enterprises would end up having employee connections back to Fairchild.|$|E

[...] The New Yorker critic Penelope Gilliatt had lambasted the process as well: [...] "the decision to <b>tack</b> <b>on</b> alien voices seems madness."
