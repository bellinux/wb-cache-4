This paper initially describes the decision making process from which BEREC resulted and subsequently critically assesses the expected contribution <b>of</b> <b>BEREC</b> to the innovativeness of the internal telecommunication markets by confronting BEREC with innovation theory and general principles for effective market authority.

40|$|The present {{research}} diachronically examines {{the development of}} orthographically correct writing in students of all grades of Primary School, {{as well as its}} relationship with the phonological and morphosyntactic awareness. The correlation of the above variables with various factors, was, still, investigated, such as intelligence, but also the child’s attending school and the parent’s educational and economic level. In the investigation 240 students who were attending the six grades of Primary School took part, 55, 8 % (134 students) of the sample consisted of students attending the 1 st Primary School in Schimatari, whereas 44, 2 % (106 students) are students of the Primary School in Oinofita. The students participated in the first, the second and the third measurement. Participants in the investigation were, also, the children’s parents. 32, 9 % of fathers 24, 5 $ of mothers have graduated from Highest Educational Institutes – Technological Educational Institutes. 34, 2 % (76) of fathers and 43, 2 %(95) of mothers had a certificate of Senior High School. For the evaluation of the children’s orthographic ability eight tasks were used: a) Misspelled text, b) <b>Task</b> <b>of</b> dictation words with a common stem, c) <b>Task</b> <b>of</b> dictating sentences with derivative words <b>of</b> the previous <b>task,</b> d) <b>Task</b> <b>of</b> dictating words a common suffix, e) <b>Task</b> <b>of</b> dictating sentences with derivative words <b>of</b> the previous <b>task,</b> f) <b>Task</b> <b>of</b> choosing right or wrong word, g) <b>Task</b> <b>of</b> dictating words (simple and compound), and h) <b>Task</b> <b>of</b> dictating sentences with derivative pseudowords of the words <b>of</b> the previous <b>task.</b> The phonological awareness was also evaluated with the following tasks: a) <b>Task</b> <b>of</b> recognizing the rhyme, b) <b>Task</b> <b>of</b> distinguishing common beginning middle or ending syllable, c) <b>Task</b> <b>of</b> recognizing common beginning – ending phoneme, d) <b>Task</b> <b>of</b> syllabic segmentation e) <b>Task</b> <b>of</b> phonemic segmentation, f) <b>Task</b> <b>of</b> deletion of beginning, middle, ending syllable, g) <b>Task</b> <b>of</b> deletion of beginning or ending phoneme, and h) <b>Task</b> <b>of</b> substitution of beginning phoneme. 9 For the morphosyntactic awareness of the student’s five tests were used: a) <b>Task</b> <b>of</b> evaluation of grammatically – correction and explanation of grammatically incorrect sentences, b) Berko’s test (<b>Task</b> <b>of</b> derivative morphology), c) <b>Task</b> <b>of</b> sentence analogy and d) <b>Task</b> <b>of</b> words in mixed order for the construction of sentences. The level of the student’s intelligence was investigated with the Greek WISC – III (Georgas, Paraskevopoulos, Bezeveghis, & Giannitsas, 1997). The parent’s questionnaire contained questions regarding: a) their educational and economic level, b) The child’s study environment (library, place of study), c) Their occupation with the child’s study. Main finding of the study was the ascertainment that the orthographic awareness has a developmental character while the children cover various stages of acquiring, understanding and dealing with the rules of correct writing. Still a clear relationship among the three skills of language awareness, orthographically correct writing, phonological awareness and morphosyntactic knowledge. However the relation among them is not linear {{in the sense that the}} ability of orthographically correct writing connects also with other factors, such as intelligence, the parent’s educational level but also the attending school. ...|$|R

40|$|Uninterrupted {{power supply}} has become {{indispensable}} during the maintenance <b>task</b> <b>of</b> active electric power lines {{as a result}} of today's highly information-oriented society and increasing demand of electric utilities. The maintenance task has the risk of electric shock and the danger of falling from high place. Therefore it is necessary to realize an autonomous robot system using electro-hydraulic manipulator because hydraulic manipulators have the advantage of electric insulation. Meanwhile it is relatively difficult to realize autonomous assembly tasks particularly in the case of manipulating flexible objects uch as electric lines. In this report, a discrete vent control system is introduced for automatic assembly <b>task</b> <b>of</b> electric lines into sleeves as one <b>of</b> the typical <b>task</b> <b>of</b> active electric power lines.
