The siege of Svetigrad continued, however, and Marin Barleti {{writes that the}} Ottomans bribed a soldier to throw a dead dog into <b>the</b> <b>well</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fortress, forcing the garrison to refuse to drink out of it. It is more likely, however, that the Ottomans had cut off the water supply and induced the garrison to surrender. Given the circumstance, Perlati promised a surrender if the garrison were allowed a safe passage through the Ottoman lines. Prince Mehmed suggested that the garrison should be promised safe passage and then massacred, but Murad rejected his son's proposal, in fear that the rebellion would only be intensified through such an act; he decided to instead return the garrisoning force to Skanderbeg. On July 31, 1448 the garrison of Svetigrad surrendered.|$|E

At this early stage they produced many international and local plays for television audiences such as Antigone, The Wild Duck, The Fire Raisers, The Government Inspector, The Physicists, Martine, <b>The</b> <b>Well</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Saints, Candida, The Man of Destiny, In the Shadow of the Glen, Church Street, The Field, The Plough and the Stars, The Shadow of a Gunman and The Hostage.

Hugh Leonard adapted James Joyce's Dubliners under the title Dublin and in 1966 he wrote Insurrection an 8-part real-time series which depicted {{the events of the}} 1916 Easter Rising which was broadcast on Easter Week on the 50th anniversary of the rising, it was RTÉ biggest drama production of the 1960s, involving on location filming and the Army. In its first ten years on the air RTÉ produced 103 plays of which 66% were Irish and 50% began life as stage plays. Half of the drama produced came from serials such as the Dublin based urban soap Tolka Row which began broadcasting in 1964 and finished in 1968.

[...] A motion to amend the resolution in favor of reprimand was voted down 267–146; most of Speaker Pelosi's allies rejected it and over 105 Democrats voted the resolution down.

40|$|Peroxynitrite is a {{reactive}} {{nitrogen species}} that has remained at <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> controversy since <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> its discovery {{in the early}} 1990 ’s. <b>The</b> reactive nature <b>of</b> PN required unique chemical synthetic approaches and techniques to be developed to study <b>the</b> chemistry <b>of</b> this species. Unfortunately, many of these sources are highly alkaline, produce unwanted byproducts, and {{can be difficult to}} control. With these shortcomings in mind, a multi-well platform was designed and constructed that is capable of evolving sustained levels of peroxynitrite precursors nitric oxide and superoxide under controlled conditions. Nitric oxide and superoxide rapidly react in <b>the</b> <b>wells</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> platform to generate peroxynitrite in situ. This thesis describes the design process and construction of this biomimetic two-component peroxynitrite-generating system. In Chapter 2 the fabrication and characterization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> platform is discussed in detail and concludes with results obtained were intrinsic platform probe uric acid was used to effectively demonstrate <b>the</b> control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system. The work highlighted in Chapter 3 establishes <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> platform through <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> PN-target tyrosine. Investigation into PN-mediated nitration of free tyrosine and tyrosine-containing model peptides within <b>the</b> <b>wells</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> platform revealed extents of nitration (~ 40 %) significantly greater than values previously reported in the literature where alternative sources of PN were employed. Chapter 4 describes our first attempts to study an unexplored chemistry between peroxynitrite and 3 -nitrotyrosine within <b>the</b> <b>wells</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> platform. Results from this work revealed a unique dimer product that was characterized by detailed mass spectral analysis. Based on <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> Chapters 2, 3 and 4, the designed platform has been firmly established as a powerful bioanalytical tool. Recognizing this potential, Chapter 5 describes preliminary results observed in recent studies investigating <b>the</b> metabolites <b>of</b> selected anti-inflammatory drugs upon exposure to peroxynitrite and its precursors nitric oxide and superoxide. Descriptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> results are presented with <b>the</b> intentions <b>of</b> establishing a future direction for the peroxynitrite-generating platform...|$|R
