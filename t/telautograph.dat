50|$|In 1887 Gray {{invented the}} <b>telautograph,</b> {{a device that}} could {{remotely}} transmit handwriting through telegraph systems. Gray was granted several patents for these pioneer fax machines, and the Gray National <b>Telautograph</b> Company was chartered in 1888 and continued in business as The <b>Telautograph</b> Corporation for many years; {{after a series of}} mergers it was finally absorbed by Xerox in the 1990s. Gray's <b>telautograph</b> machines were used by banks for signing documents at a distance and by the military for sending written commands during gun tests when the deafening noise from the guns made spoken orders on the telephone impractical. The machines were also used at train stations for schedule changes.|$|E
50|$|Gray {{displayed}} his <b>telautograph</b> invention in 1893 at the 1893 Columbian Exposition {{and sold}} his {{share in the}} <b>telautograph</b> shortly after that. Gray was also chairman of the International Congress of Electricians at the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893.|$|E

5000|$|The telautograph's {{invention}} {{is attributed}} to Elisha Gray, who patented it on July 31, 1888. Gray's patent stated that the <b>telautograph</b> would allow [...] "one to transmit his own handwriting to a distant point over a two-wire circuit." [...] It was the first facsimile machine in which the stylus was controlled by horizontal and vertical bars. The <b>telautograph</b> was first publicly exhibited at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition held in Chicago.|$|E

50|$|Early Fax Machine - The <b>telautograph,</b> the {{precursor}} to the modern day fax machine, was invented in 1888 by the American scientist, Elisha Gray who {{at one point in}} time contested Alexander Graham Bell's invention of the telephone. The <b>telautograph</b> was a device which could send electrical impulses to the receiving pen of the device, {{in order to be able}} to recreate drawings to a piece of paper while a person simultaneously wrote them longhand on the other end of the device. In 1900 Gray's assistant, Foster Ritchie, improved upon the original design and it was this device which was displayed at the 1904 World's Fair and marketed for the next thirty years.|$|E
50|$|<b>Telautograph</b> Corporation {{changed its}} name several times. In 1971, it was {{acquired}} by Arden/Mayfair. In 1993, Danka Industries purchased the company and renamed it Danka/Omnifax. In 1999, Xerox corporation purchased the company and called it the Omnifax division, which has since been absorbed by the corporation.|$|E

Basically it transmits electrical impulses recorded by potentiometers to stepping motors attached to a pen, thus being able to reproduce a drawing or signature made by the sender at the receiver's station. It was the first such device to transmit drawings to a stationary sheet of paper; previous inventions in Europe used rotating drums to make such transmissions.|$|E

5000|$|The tablet {{computer}} {{and its associated}} operating system began {{with the development of}} pen computing. Electrical devices with data input and output on a flat information display existed as early as 1888 with the <b>telautograph,</b> which used a sheet of paper as display and a pen attached to electromechanical actuators. Throughout the 20th century devices with these characteristics have been imagined and created whether as blueprints, prototypes, or commercial products. In addition to many academic and research systems, several companies released commercial products in the 1980s, with various input/output types tried out: ...|$|E
5000|$|The <b>telautograph</b> {{became very}} popular for the {{transmission}} of signatures over a distance, and in banks and large hospitals to ensure that doctors' orders and patient information were transmitted quickly and accurately.Teleautograph systems were installed {{in a number of}} major railroad stations to relay hand-written reports of train movements from the interlocking tower to various parts of the station. [...] The teleautograph network in Grand Central Terminal included a public display in the main concourse into the 1960s; a similar setup in Chicago Union Station remained in operation into the 1970s.|$|E
5000|$|Pen {{computing}} {{has very}} deep historical roots.For example, the first patent for an electronic device used for handwriting, the <b>telautograph,</b> was granted in 1888.What {{is probably the}} first patent for a system that recognized handwritten characters by analyzing the handwriting motion was granted in 1915.Around 1954 Douglas T Ross, working on the Whirlwind computer at MIT, wrote the [...] "first hand-drawn graphics input program to a computer". The first publicly demonstrated system using a tablet and handwriting text recognition instead of a keyboard for working with a modern digital computer dates to 1956.|$|E
50|$|Up until then, Gray {{had been}} one of the firm's top customers. He had invented a needle {{annunciator}} for hotels and elevators, a <b>telautograph</b> (a machine for the electrical transmission of writing), and the telegraph answer-back call box. Gray and Barton joined forces with an investment of $2,500 each, with Gray as the senior partner. The success of the new company attracted the attention of General Anson Stager, general superintendent of the Western Union Telegraph Company. He offered to enter the business as an equal partner with Gray and Barton, providing the company's headquarters was moved from Cleveland to Chicago, Illinois. In December 1869, the company moved to 162 S. Water Street, Chicago. The great Great Chicago Fire in 1871 came within two blocks of its small plant.|$|E
