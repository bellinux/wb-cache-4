5|$|Following {{the death}} in 1361 of William de Cambuslang, Bishop of Dunblane, Walter {{was elected by}} the Dunblane cathedral chapter <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> bishop. On his election, Walter possessed no benefices in the diocese, and had had none since giving up his Abernethy prebend a decade before. However, it was {{probably}} the diocese of his birth, and he had almost become archdeacon of the diocese in 1345.|$|E

5|$|Cienfuegos led electors {{that were}} part of the {{imperial}} party in an attempt to elect Giulio Piazza. Piazza was almost elected on May 13, but was short by four votes. The electors were confident that {{they would be able to}} elect him, because more cardinals were arriving to participate in the conclave, and it became public in Rome that Piazza was likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> pope. Albani did not support this because he had not been a part of the negotiations despite being the original elector to suggest Piazza, and undermined his election by proposing Vincenzo Orsini as an alternate candidate.|$|E
5|$|However, it {{was while}} Edward was in York that he ordered the {{rehabilitation}} of Henry Percy to his family Earldom on 27 March 1470. On the same day John was elevated to the Marquessate of Montagu, and now outranked his brother- an Earl- in the English peerage. Historians have since questioned, however, whether his new title had the gravitas that his previous Earldom had had, and have even suggested that the king was 'walking a tightrope' as to whether Montagu would actually accept it or not. To compensate him {{for the loss of}} the Percy estates Montagu was granted the lands of the dead Earl of Devon, and Montagu's son, George was created Duke of Bedford. These were substantial estates, providing an income of at least £600 per annum. Montagu was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> regional magnate- as he been in the north- to fill an existing power vacuum.|$|E

In the newspaper's supervisory council vote, Monsen edged out Waldemar Carlsen with 22 to 4 votes, and also prevailed over other applicants who were seasoned editors, such as Ingvald Førre and Eugène Olaussen.

5|$|In 324, Constantine I chose Byzantium <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> {{capital of}} the Roman Empire, {{renaming}} it New Rome. Following the death of Theodosius I in 395 and the permanent division of the Roman Empire between his two sons, the city, which would popularly {{come to be known}} as Constantinople, became the {{capital of the}} Eastern Roman Empire. This empire, which would later be branded by historians as the Byzantine Empire, ruled most of the territory of present-day Turkey until the Late Middle Ages; although the eastern regions remained in firm Sasanian hands up to the first half of the seventh century. The frequent Byzantine-Sassanid Wars, as part of the centuries long-lasting Roman-Persian Wars, fought between the neighbouring rivalling Byzantines and Sasanians, took place in various parts of present-day Turkey and decided much of the latter's history from the fourth century up to the first half of the seventh century.|$|E

In keeping with the Amadeus parody, the music of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (a {{favorite}} of Jeff Richmond, the show's regular composer) is used to score much of the episode.|$|E

5|$|On 15 October 2015, {{following}} years {{of criticism from}} the fans over {{the design of the}} 1997 badge, the club announced they intended to carry out a fan consultation on whether to disregard the club badge and institute a new design. After the consultation, the club announced in late November 2015 the current club badge would be replaced in due course by a new version which would be designed {{in the style of the}} older, circular variants. A design purporting <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> badge was unintentionally leaked two days early prior to the official unveiling on 26 December 2015 by the IPO when the design was trademarked on 22 December. The new design was officially unveiled at the club's home match on 26 December against Sunderland.|$|E
5|$|The 58th National Hockey League All-Star Game was {{originally}} {{scheduled to be}} hosted by the Phoenix Coyotes at Jobing.com Arena in Glendale, Arizona. However, due to the ongoing bankruptcy case, potential ownership changes in the Coyotes organization, {{and the possibility of}} relocation, the NHL decided to reopen bidding to host the game. In the bidding process, 14 teams made bids for All-Star Games or NHL Drafts for the next three years. Out of all the bids, the NHL chose the Carolina Hurricanes <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> host team and on April 7, 2010, the announcement was made by NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman and Hurricanes President and General Manager Jim Rutherford.|$|E

2500|$|The {{music scene}} in South Africa is focused around four major areas, Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban and Bloemfontein. One of the {{characteristics}} of <b>the</b> scene <b>is</b> <b>the</b> strong sense of community which sees artist, promoters and venues all actively involved in developing the local talent. [...] Bloemfontein's music focus is centred predominantly around the metal and Afrikaans genres. Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban are far more wide-ranging in the genres of music covered by bands and artists. [...] Cape Town is a hotbed for the underground music scene, generally held <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more experimental than the music produced in the other centres. Potchefstroom seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>newest</b> development ground for Afrikaans rock music, with various bands like Straatligkinders making their start here.|$|R

5|$|The Trojans {{lost their}} {{offensive}} coordinator, Lane Kiffin, on January 23, 2007, {{when he was}} hired <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> {{head coach of the}} Oakland Raiders; the 31-year-old Kiffin became the youngest head coach in Raiders history, and the youngest head coach since the formation of the modern NFL.

Sarkisian had interviewed with the Raiders for their vacant head coach position but withdrew from the process to stay at USC, where he had been the assistant head coach and quarterbacks coach.|$|E
5|$|The {{new state}} {{legislature}} had also appointed a five-man committee {{to select a}} city <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> state capital. Scott applied to have Petersburg, still a fledgling settlement, designated as the capital. Other localities– including Frankfort, Lexington, Louisville, and Boonesborough– also applied. Frankfort was eventually chosen, as Scott's failure to secure Petersburg's designation as the state capital contributed {{more than anything else}} to the settlement's failure to even become a viable city. Scott's son, Charles, Jr., wrote to his brother Daniel that their father was planning to run for Congress in 1792; although Charles, Jr. expressed confidence that his father would be elected, his campaign apparently never materialized or faltered shortly after it began. He was, however, chosen as a presidential elector in 1793.|$|E
5|$|After {{not being}} seen for several weeks, Anderson {{returned}} to Impact Wrestling on December 27, {{where he was}} offered {{a position in the}} villainous Aces & Eights stable. The following week, Anderson accepted Aces & Eights offer, turning heel again in the process. On the January 10 episode of Impact Wrestling, Anderson explained his joining by noting how nobody helped him when he was attacked by the Aces & Eights back in October. Anderson wrestled his return match on three days later at Genesis, defeating Samoa Joe after interference from Aces & Eights member Mike Knox. On March 10 at Lockdown, Aces & Eights, consisting of Anderson, Devon, DOC, Garett Bischoff, and Mike Knox were defeated by Team TNA, consisting of Eric Young, James Storm, Magnus, Samoa Joe, and Sting in a Lethal Lockdown match. On June 2 at Slammiversary XI, Anderson, Garett Bischoff, and Wes Brisco were defeated by Jeff Hardy, Magnus, and Samoa Joe in a six-man tag team match. On the following episode of Impact Wrestling, Anderson began campaigning <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> Vice President of the Aces & Eights. The following week, Anderson defeated his fellow Aces & Eights stablemates in a battle royal to qualify for the 2013 Bound for Glory Series. Anderson went on to defeat Joseph Park in his first BFG series match via pinfall on the June 20 episode of Impact Wrestling, to earn seven points in the tournament. On the July 11 episode of Impact Wrestling, Anderson was voted over DOC by his fellow Aces & Eights members to become the Vice President of the stable.|$|E
