2500|$|The Teletouch {{pushbutton}} automatic <b>transmission</b> <b>selector</b> was {{an extremely}} complex feature. [...] It proved problematic {{in part because the}} steering wheel hub, where the pushbuttons were located, was the traditional location of the horn button. [...] Some drivers inadvertently shifted gears when they intended to sound the horn. [...] While the Edsel was fast, the location of the transmission pushbuttons was not conducive to street racing. There were also jokes among stoplight drag racers about the buttons: D for Drag, L for Leap, and R for Race (instead of Drive, Low and Reverse). [...] The control wires for Teletouch were also routed too close to the exhaust manifold, which often caused unpredictable movement of the selector mechanism and, in some cases, complete failure. The electrical design required drivers to shift from Park to Reverse to Neutral to Drive, in that order, to avoid overloading the Teletouch motor. The motor was also not powerful enough to bring the car out of Park while on a hill, so dealerships would instruct drivers to set the parking brake before pushing the Park button.|$|E

50|$|Eventually, all {{push-button}} <b>transmission</b> <b>selectors</b> {{became a}} safety issue {{due to lack}} of industry-wide standardization. In addition, since the 1920s the center of the steering wheel had typically held the horn button. While some cars of the late 50s had horn rings, some drivers instinctively hit the steering wheel center in an emergency, sometimes causing them to either damage the controls or cause an unexpected, hazardous gear change (occasionally causing transmission damage). The Edsel's system included an electro-hydraulic inhibitor switch activated by transmission fluid pressure which virtually eliminated the possibility of this happening.|$|R
50|$|The {{automatic}} <b>transmission</b> gear <b>selector</b> is dashboard mounted, thereby {{freeing up}} the flat floor {{space between the}} front seats, allowing movement to the back seat from inside the vehicle.|$|R
5000|$|Because the shifter {{and parking}} brake cannot be mounted between the seats, the <b>transmission</b> <b>selector</b> or shifter is {{moved to the}} {{steering}} column, and the emergency brake is activated by a pedal in the driver's footwell.|$|E
5000|$|The {{automatic}} <b>transmission</b> <b>selector</b> was redesigned {{to allow}} the manual selection of forward gears without accidentally selecting neutral or reverse. This new feature was dubbed the [...] "J-Gate" [...] and has carried over to more recent Jaguar models.|$|E
50|$|Introduced on the 1961 Ford Thunderbird, {{and made}} {{available}} on other Ford products throughout the 1960s, the Swing-away steering wheel allowed {{the steering wheel}} to move nine inches to the right when the <b>transmission</b> <b>selector</b> was in Park, {{so as to make}} driver exit and entry easier.|$|E

5000|$|Trim {{levels were}} expanded, and were {{designated}} the Brougham, SGL Extra, SGL, GL and the Jack Nicklaus edition {{which was very}} similar to the Brougham, which offered the turbo. Other trim levels were the Turbo S, Custom S, Custom Deluxe, Deluxe and the Standard at the bottom. The diesel engine SD22 was offered in 1979 on the sedan GL and DX. The Standard Sedan and Van were discontinued April 1981. October 1979, the 6-cylinder LD28 diesel was added with the automatic <b>transmission</b> <b>selector</b> moved from column shift to a floor-mounted system. December 1979 was when the first turbo L20ET was introduced, ...|$|E
5000|$|The first-generation Hydramatic (not the {{controlled}} coupling version that succeeded it in 1956) {{did not have}} a separate park position as found in modern automatic transmissions. The driver had to shut off the engine and then place the transmission in reverse in order to lock the driveline to prevent the car from moving. Also, the original Hydramatic required periodic band adjustments as a routine maintenance item that later versions did not. Early 1940 model Oldsmobiles with Hydra-Matic Drive could be started with the <b>transmission</b> <b>selector</b> lever in any position. The car would then start to move, unless the transmission lever had been left in N, neutral.|$|E
5000|$|The Crusader 101 had the {{additional}} benefit of size. It measured {{about three feet}} in length - or just under one meter - which allowed for some elaborate detail hitherto unseen in a toy car. The trunk had storage space for a spare tire, jack and lug wrench {{which could be used}} to actually change a wheel. Twin radio aerials on either rear fender could be raised or lowered by hand. Not only were the sun visors adjustable, the turn signal lever, steering wheel and gear selector could be moved as well. A male driver figure was included with the car - in a relaxed pose at the wheel and was just as detailed as the car itself. He was unpainted beige plastic. A remote control and battery holder shaped like an automatic <b>transmission</b> <b>selector</b> allowed the car to be [...] "driven" [...] per the promise on the box of [...] "YOU DRIVE IT - YOU PARK IT." ...|$|E

GPS-linked climate control, voice recognition, and a keyless access {{system with a}} push-button start are also standard.|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{production}} vehicles, light and medium duty trucks, and motor {{homes have been}} made with a separate drum brake on the transmission output shaft; called a driveline parking brake. This has an advantage of being completely independent of other braking systems. This is effective {{as long as the}} drive train is intact [...] - [...] propeller shaft, differential, and axle shafts. In many vehicles, this type of parking brake is operated by either a foot pedal or a hydraulic cylinder controlled by the <b>transmission</b> gear <b>selector,</b> or by both.|$|R

5000|$|The 2017 Lincoln Continental is sold {{with three}} {{different}} engines, all paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. The base V6 engine is naturally aspirated, with two optional twin-turbocharged V6 engines. In the United States the base engine is a 3.7 L V6 making [...] and 280 lbft Nm. A 2.7 L direct-injection twin-turbo V6 with [...] and 380 lbft Nm is available as an option. A new 3.0 L direct-injection twin-turbocharged V6 will be exclusive to Lincoln. Shared with the updated, shorter, 2017 Lincoln MKZ, the 3.0 L engine is rated at [...] and 400 lbft Nm of torque on 93 octane ((R+M)/2) fuel. In Canada the car is only available with either the 2.7 or 3.0 L twin-turbo engines, and only with all-wheel-drive.The Lincoln Continental features a number of items never previously offered on a Ford Motor Company vehicle, including electronically-latched doors Lincoln calls [...] "E-Latch" [...] that pull shut if the door isn't completely closed (the external door pulls are integrated into the beltline window trim, and the interior has an electrically activated button aligned with the door pull handle) and torque vectoring for the optional all-wheel drive system when the 3.0 L engine is installed. [...] The transmission is no longer activated with a <b>transmission</b> <b>selector</b> mounted on the center console; the computer controlled transmission uses buttons installed {{to the left of}} the infotainment touch screen labeled [...] "P, R, N, D, S", a revival of an approach used in the 1950s by the Chrysler push button PowerFlite and the Packard Touchbutton Ultramatic. The [...] "S" [...] transmission selection represents [...] "Sport" [...] mode, where the Continuously Controlled Damping suspension, electric power steering and transmission shift points take on a different posture. As with the Lincoln MKS, the Continental offers adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping technology, but introduces an optional 360-degree camera system to produce a [...] "virtual overhead view" [...] of the vehicle. An upgraded speaker package is offered by Harman's [...] "Revel" [...] division, optional in both a 13 speaker and 19 speaker version, identified by aluminum speaker grilles installed in the front and rear door panels. Available on vehicles equipped with the [...] "Select" [...] or [...] "Reserve" [...] trim packages is a voice-activated touchscreen navigation system with integrated SiriusXM Traffic and TravelLink with a 6-year prepaid trial subscription.|$|E
50|$|Conventionally, {{automatic}} <b>transmissions</b> have <b>selector</b> {{positions that}} allow the driver to limit the maximum ratio that the transmission may engage. On older transmissions, this was accomplished by a mechanical lockout in the transmission valve body preventing an upshift until the lockout was disengaged; on computer-controlled transmissions, the same effect is accomplished by firmware. The transmission can still upshift and downshift automatically between the remaining ratios: for example, in the 3 range, a transmission could shift from first to second to third, but not into fourth or higher ratios. Some transmissions will still upshift automatically into the higher ratio if the engine reaches its maximum permissible speed in the selected range.|$|R
5000|$|The rear {{suspension}} was now independent, {{and though the}} wheelbase remained {{the same as the}} previous model, it was an entirely different car. A SOHC non-turbo diesel 2.0-liter RF [...] engine was made available; twenty examples were imported officially into Australia from 1983 to 1987. The diesel also benefitted from ventilated brakes up front and a variable ratio steering rack, to minimize the effects of the (slight) additional weight. European markets also received a 1.6-liter F6 [...] engine. The placement of the power window controls was installed on the center console, ahead of the gear shift/automatic <b>transmission</b> gear <b>selector,</b> as opposed to the traditional installation of the window switches on the respective doors.|$|R
50|$|A {{parking pawl}} is a device fitted to a motor vehicle's {{automatic}} transmission {{in order for}} it to lock up the transmission. It is engaged when the <b>transmission</b> shift lever <b>selector</b> {{is placed in the}} Park position, which is always the first position (topmost on a column shift, frontmost on a floor shift) in all cars sold in the United States since 1965 (when the order was standardised by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE)) through SAE J915, and in most other vehicles worldwide.|$|R

Upholstery choices were covert and pattern cloth, leather and pattern cloth, leather and nylon, and leather and dimple leather. Standard tire size was [...] by [...] The optional air conditioning unit {{was moved to the}} engine bay instead of the trunk. The turning diameter was 43ft. The Hydramatic automatic <b>transmission</b> gear <b>selector</b> had an S on it, which was used for better performance climbing hills. At mid-year, Olds introduced the new pillarless four-door hardtop body, dubbed the Holiday sedan, in the 98 series. The 4-door Oldsmobile 98 Holiday, along with the 4-door 88 Holiday and the 4-door Buick Century Riviera and 4-door Special Riviera, were the first 4-door hardtops ever produced. Perhaps because of the popularity of the new 4-door hardtop body style total 98 sales set a new record of 118,626.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike other [...] "Heritage" [...] DMU units, {{the class}} 127 units had {{hydraulic}} transmission (as {{opposed to the}} more standard mechanical <b>transmission).</b> The gear <b>selector</b> in the driver's cab had a [...] "D" [...] position where [...] "4" [...] would be on other standard transmission units.As built, these units were coded Blue Square, and were therefore {{able to work with}} mechanical transmission units, provided the driver remembered to use 1,2,3,D instead of just selecting D.This was changed to a unique code of Red Triangle when a driver forgot he had a mechanical transmission unit on the rear of his train, which meant this unit was driven only in fourth gear, which burnt out the transmissions on that unit.Power was provided by C8NFLH engines supplied by Rolls-Royce.

25|$|After {{the end of}} the war the 11.1 {{continued}} with a larger 1400 cc engine and standard electric lighting as the 11.9 until 1923 and the updated 12 until 1926. Following Wilbur Gunn's death in 1920, three existing directors headed by Colin Parbury took charge. The first of the company's sports models was launched in 1925 as the 14/60 with a twin-cam 1954-cc 4-cylinder engine and hemispherical combustion chambers. The car was designed by Arthur Davidson who had come from Lea-Francis. A higher output engine came in 1927 with the 2-litre Speed Model which could be had supercharged in 1930. A lengthened chassis version, the 16/65, with 6-cylinder 2.4-litre engine, was available from 1926 to 1930. The final car of the 1920s was the 3-litre using a 2931-cc 6-cylinder engine. This continued until 1933 when the engine grew to 3181 cc and was also available with a complex 8-speed Maybach <b>transmission</b> as the <b>Selector</b> Special.|$|R
5000|$|In 1986 (1988 for the US market), Toyota {{introduced}} a supercharged engine for the MR2. Based {{on the same}} block and head, the 4A-GZE was equipped with a small Roots-type supercharger and a Denso intercooler. T-VIS was eliminated and the compression ratio was lowered to 8:1. It produced [...] and 140 lbft Nm and accelerated the small car from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 6.5 to 7.0s. The supercharger was belt-driven but actuated by an electromagnetic clutch, {{so that it would}} not be driven except when needed, increasing fuel economy. Curb weight increased to as much as 2494 lb for supercharged models, due to the weight of the supercharger equipment and a new, stronger <b>transmission.</b> A fuel <b>selector</b> switch was also added in some markets, to allow the car to run on regular unleaded if required to. In addition to the new engine, the MR2 SC was also equipped with stiffer springs, and received special [...] "tear-drop" [...] aluminium wheels. The engine cover had two raised vents (only one of which was functional) that visually distinguished it from the naturally aspirated models. It was also labeled [...] "Supercharged" [...] on the rear trunk and body mouldings behind both doors. This model was never offered in European or Australian markets, although some cars were privately imported.|$|R
