5|$|Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump: Though at {{an early}} age he is deemed to have a below average IQ of 75, he has an endearing {{character}} and shows devotion to his loved ones and duties, character traits which bring him into many life-changing situations. Along the way, he encounters many historical figures and events throughout his life. Tom's younger brother Jim Hanks is his acting double in the movie for the scenes when Forrest runs across the U.S. Tom's daughter Elizabeth Hanks appears in the movie as <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> school bus who refuses to let young Forrest (Michael Conner Humphreys) sit next to her. John Travolta was the original choice to play the title role, and admits passing on the role was a mistake. Bill Murray and Chevy Chase were also considered for the role. Sean Penn stated in an interview having been second choice for the role. Hanks revealed that he signed onto the film after {{an hour and a half}} of reading the script. He initially wanted to ease Forrest's pronounced Southern accent, but was eventually persuaded by director Robert Zemeckis to portray the heavy accent stressed in the novel.

Milda is not home, and she meets his parents, who {{have never heard of}} her and don't know what they should do with her.

Forman has described this famous scene: [...] "It’s a tight fit.

[...] Andula, kneeling outside the door of their bedroom, overhears the family squabbling, and when it becomes clear to her that she is not valued in the least, she breaks down in tears and, the next morning, returns to her home. She tells her friends about her [...] "wonderful" [...] trip to the capital and how nice Milda's parents were to her, especially his father, and then she returns to work at the factory.|$|E
