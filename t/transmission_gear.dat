All previous T1 versions had a totally unsprung suspension which used multiple equalizing links between the bogies to spread out impacts from rough terrain. This still gave a very rough ride. The T1E3's suspension had coil springs and hydraulic shock absorbers, and its ride was much smoother.|$|E
2500|$|The Kingsnorth {{design team}} hastily set about {{redesigning}} the power car and <b>transmission</b> <b>gear,</b> {{and at the}} same time, staff at East Fortune were also looking into ways of improving the design. Kingsnorth considered the idea of replacing the Roll-Royce engines with [...] Fiat units having a direct drive to the propellers; while East Fortune's Engineering Officer, Lt.Cdr. A. S. Abell, RNVR, together with Flt.Cdr. J. S. Wheelwright, DSC (Captain of N.S.3), {{came up with the idea}} of raising the control car to the same level as the engineers' car; form them into a single fully enclosed unit that measured [...] in length and tapered to the stern, and fit the propellers directly onto the engine crankshafts. These and other minor measures provided the crew with more room and improved their comfort; increased top speed through reduced air resistance (the redesigned car was more aerodynamic and positioned closer to the envelope); resulted in a reduction in weight; and improved reliability due to the abolition of the troublesome transmission shafts. In January 1918, the Admiralty granted permission for these modifications to be undertaken at both Kingsnorth, and at East Fortune where the work was completed by the beginning of March.|$|E

40|$|Condition {{monitoring}} {{based on}} vibration measurement {{and analysis of}} planetary <b>gear</b> <b>transmissions</b> has not provided the same good results observed in conventional fixed-shaft <b>gear</b> <b>transmissions.</b> One of the causes being the improper interpretation of the vibration spectrum. The structure of the lines present in the spectrum of the vibrations measured on a non-faulty planetary <b>gear</b> <b>transmission,</b> with a sensor mounted on the outer part of the ring gear, is strictly related to the geometry of the transmission. Hence, different spectral patterns can be found for different planetary <b>gear</b> <b>transmissions.</b> In this work, a vibration model for a single-stage planetary <b>gear</b> <b>transmission</b> is presented to explain this phenomenon. The model is developed in the time domain and analyzed in the frequency domain by using the Fourier transform.

Based on this, a classification of planetary <b>gear</b> <b>transmissions</b> in four groups is proposed. The spectral characteristics of the vibrations of each group are presented.

40|$|One of {{the central}} {{problems}} in manufacturing gears is to lengthen the life and increase the load capacity of transmissions and drive elements made from lightweight materials. Using lighter materials significantly reduces the moment of inertia, meaning higher dynamics can be achieved. In {{the framework of the}} joint project LEZABS ("Lightweight lubricant-free or low lubricant <b>gear</b> <b>transmission</b> through DLC coatings") a <b>gear</b> <b>transmission</b> with backlash for a circular saw of the firm Metabowerke GmbH & Co. and a Harmonic Drive <b>gear</b> <b>transmission</b> free of play that is suitable for positioning changes in robots or machine tools were investigated. Int both applications traditional steels are being replaced with lighter, easier to work materials. Aluminium and titanium alloys are being investigated for the play-free <b>transmission</b> <b>gears,</b> with sintered steels and ETG 100 for the <b>gear</b> <b>transmissions</b> with backlash. Variations of coatings were checked in extensive wear and application-orientated model tests. The laboratory results were transferred to realistic <b>gear</b> <b>transmission</b> elements. In order to maintain optimal total power output, calculations and simulations to improve gear geometry and the meshing of the gears were carried out. As the result of all this development work METABO experienced a tool life incrase from 50 to 300 hours for their circular saw with the same size and load. Production costs could be held steady by substituting the use of an a-C:H coating for a hardening process, {{while at the same time}} improving toothing quality. Aluminium and titanium alloys with an a-C:H coating were successfully used as the material for the play-free Harmonic Drive <b>gear</b> <b>transmission.</b> The total weight of the <b>gear</b> <b>transmission</b> could be reduced, while maintaining the same performance characteristics.
