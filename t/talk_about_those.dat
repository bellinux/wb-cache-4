The meetings of families could be equally traumatic, with wives and husbands meeting again for the first time in five years and discovering they had lived very different lives which were hard to <b>talk</b> <b>about.</b> <b>Those</b> who had been evacuated were told that it was tougher in the islands. Alderney residents were not allowed to return to their island until December 1945.|$|E

2500|$|The Fault in Our Stars {{received}} critical acclaim. Critics mostly {{praised the}} book for its humor, strong characters, language, themes and new perspective on cancer and romance. The New York Times review of the book called it [...] "a blend of melancholy, sweet, philosophical and funny" [...] and said that it [...] "stays the course of tragic realism", while noting that the book's unpleasant plot details [...] "do nothing to diminish the romance; in Green's hands, they only make it more moving." [...] NPR's Rachel Syme noted that [...] " [...] voice is so compulsively readable that it defies categorization," [...] saying that the [...] "elegantly plotted" [...] book [...] "may be his best." [...] Time called The Fault in Our Stars [...] "damn near genius." [...] Entertainment Weekly wrote, [...] " [...] love story is as real as it is doomed, and the gut-busting laughs that come early in the novel make the luminous final pages all the more heartbreaking", and gave the novel an overall A grade. Amazon.com calls it [...] "insightful, bold, irreverent, and raw" [...] and Green's [...] "most ambitious and heartbreaking work yet." [...] The Manila Bulletin says that the book is [...] "a collection of maudlin scenes and trite observations about the fragility {{of life and the}} wisdom of dying. And while it does <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>those</b> things and more, the treatment of it is far from being maudlin or trite." [...] The Manila Bulletin also added that [...] "Just two paragraphs into the work, and he immediately wallops the readers with such an insightful observation delivered in such an unsentimental way that its hard not to shake your head in admiration." [...] The Manila Bulletin stated that The Fault in Our Stars was a triumph for John Green. USA Today called it a [...] "elegiac comedy." [...] They gave the book a rating of four out of four stars.The School Library Journal stated that it was [...] "a strong choice for Adult Collections." [...] The Fault in Our Stars received a starred review from Kirkus Reviews, who described it as [...] "a smartly crafted intellectual explosion of a romance." ...|$|E

"One evening, {{shortly after}} my arrival, {{we were sitting}} over a glass of port after dinner, when young Trevor began to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>those</b> habits of {{observation}} and inference which I had already formed into a system, although I had not yet appreciated the part which they were to play in my life.

'Then I {{can talk}} with him on matters which of course have special {{interest}} for me, for somehow I find that I scarcely ever read or think on any points which do not concern directly my work as clergyman or language-monger.

That made the talks with the Judge so delightful. Now young people, of course, have their heads full (as I used to have mine) of other things, and so my talk would be dull and heavy to them.|$|E
6000|$|He was vague himself, and evidently weak, {{and much}} embarrassed, {{and not an}} allusion was made between us to Mansfield Street. The vision of the salon {{of which he had}} been an {{ornament}} hovered before me however, by contrast, sufficiently. He assured me he was really getting better, and his mother remarked that he would come round if he could only get his spirits up. The aunt echoed this opinion, and I became more sure that in her own case she knew where to go for such a purpose. I'm afraid I was rather weak with my old friend, for I neglected the opportunity, so exceptionally good, to rebuke the levity which had led him to throw up honourable positions--fine stiff steady berths in Bayswater and Belgravia, with morning prayers, as I knew, attached to one of them. Very likely his reasons had been profane and sentimental; he didn't want morning prayers, he wanted to be somebody's dear fellow; but I couldn't be the person to rebuke him. He shuffled these episodes out of sight--I saw he had no wish to discuss them. I noted further, strangely enough, that it would probably be a questionable pleasure for him to see me again: he doubted now even of my power to condone his aberrations. He didn't wish to have to explain; and his behaviour was likely in future to need explanation. When I bade him farewell he looked at me a moment with eyes that said everything: [...] "How can I <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>those</b> exquisite years in this place, before these people, with the old women poking their heads in? It was very good of you to come to see me; it wasn't my idea--SHE brought you. We've said everything; it's over; you'll lose all patience with me, and I'd rather you shouldn't see the rest." [...] I sent him some money in a letter the next day, but I saw the rest only in the light of a barren sequel.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Clear for a minute, {{if she has}} my hand; {{but then}} she dozes off, and <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>those</b> miserable accounts--the numbers over and over again.

6000|$|... "Oh! don't ask me," [...] she answered, [...] "a terrible thing, a sort {{of fancy}} that came to me from <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>those</b> Zulus.
