25|$|During sleep, {{a person}} is in an altered state of mind. Aristotle compares a {{sleeping}} person <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> is overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus.

When {{a person is}} asleep, their senses are not acting as they do when they are awake and this results in them thinking like a person who is influenced by strong feelings. Since a person sleeping is in this suggestible state, they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams.|$|E

25|$|The {{quality of}} the {{relationship}} between husband and wife resumes in the spiritual world in whatever state it was at their death in this world. Thus, a couple in true marriage love remain together in that state in heaven into eternity. A couple lacking in that love by one or both partners, however, will separate after death and each will be given a compatible new partner if they wish. A partner is also given <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> loved the ideal of marriage but never found a true partner in this world. The exception in both cases is a person who hates chaste marriage and thus cannot receive such a partner.|$|E
25|$|Smith and Black {{had argued}} that at the very least, the Court should only uphold Oregon's ban on peyote as applied to them if Oregon had a {{compelling}} interest in prohibiting their religious use of peyote. The Court had invalidated three other unemployment compensation restrictions under this standard. But those other restrictions themselves required consideration of individualized circumstances, such as when unemployment compensation was denied <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> could not, for religious reasons, work on Saturdays. If a state has in place a system of individualized consideration, the constitution did not allow the state to refuse to extend that system to cases of religious hardship without a compelling reason.|$|E
