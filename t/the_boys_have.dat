5|$|The group {{decides to}} use Susan, who is least willing to {{participate}} in the plot, to distract Mr. Griffin by requesting a conference with him after school. Since Susan is one of his better-performing students with a serious approach to her studies, Mr. Griffin willingly does so, allowing her to walk him to his car afterwards. Jeff, David and Mark forcefully place a bag over Mr. Griffin's head and tie him up, replacing the bag with a blindfold as they take him to a remote spot in the mountains. Betsy, thanks to a speeding ticket, arrives in the parking lot after <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>have</b> left with Mr. Griffin. Susan was supposed to ride with Betsy, but does not want any further part in the scheme and Betsy leaves without her. Mark tells Mr. Griffin to beg but he refuses, so the students decide to leave him alone there until midnight.|$|E
5|$|He {{is always}} there, he knows everything. He is infallible but always failing. When the boys rescue him, he is {{typically}} emaciated, dehydrated, semi-conscious, delirious; they must succor him with candy bars and water. He {{can take on}} any shape, but reveals his identity within moments of doing so. He never discusses a case except the one he's working on in a given novel, so that his legendary close-mouthedness turns to garrulousness when a Hardy Boys novel begins, which is of course {{the only time we}} ever get to see him. All the same, he only discusses the case in enough detail to mislead his sons and put them in mortal danger. He has systems of information and data-gathering that put the FBI to shame, yet he is always losing his case notes, his ciphers, his microfilm, or some other valuable clue, usually by leaving it in his extra pair of pants, meaning that <b>the</b> <b>Boys</b> <b>have</b> to drive to Canada or Florida or somewhere to retrieve it. I suppose he isn't mysterious at all; he simply embodies what many think of their own fathers: utterly powerful, contemptibly inept.|$|E
5|$|Some time later, the Eds {{wake up in}} {{a trailer}} home, where three girls are staring down at them. <b>The</b> <b>boys</b> <b>have</b> already been changed out of their dirty clothes and put into clean robes, which the girls inform them each belong {{to one of their}} three {{respective}} dads. Explaining that they are new to the area, the girls introduce themselves as Lee (Janyse Jaud), Marie (Kathleen Barr) and May Kanker (Erin Fitzgerald). The Eds begin to offer their own introductions, but are stopped short by the sisters who are already familiar with the boys' names. As the Kankers head into the kitchen to prepare food for the Eds, Double D anxiously proposes that the three of them leave. However, Eddy stops him, insisting that they stay at least for the free food. Looking around, the boys notice drawings of themselves, each paired with one the Kankers: Ed with May, Double D with Marie, and Eddy with Lee. Although left unsettled by this discovery, they eagerly accept the food that is brought out to them and begin to relax, as the Kankers slip a movie into the VCR and go upstairs to freshen up.|$|E
2500|$|On August 27, 1916, Capt. Lurlie Gray rescued and resuscitated a boy, Elmer Scott, aged 12, from {{drowning}} after <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>had</b> {{been drawn}} under a launch at Woodland {{by the current}} in the Lewis River.

25|$|In Years 5 and 6 the {{academic}} and pastoral organisation changes. Each boy is allocated to a form with a Pastoral Tutor who teaches their form for one subject. In Year 5 this will be either English or Mathematics and in Year 6 either English, History or Geography. <b>The</b> <b>boys</b> <b>have</b> a form base in the Inky Building, but will move around the School to specialist areas for lessons and be taught by subject specialists.|$|E
25|$|Epítome {{reports the}} young boys called moxas, {{taken from a}} place called Casa del Sol at thirty leguas from the New Kingdom. They are carried on the {{shoulders}} and stay seven to {{eight years in the}} temples to be sacrificed afterwards. The process is described as cutting their heads off and letting the blood flow over the sacred sites. <b>The</b> <b>boys</b> <b>have</b> to be virgins, as if they are not, their blood is not considered pure enough to serve as sacrifice. Before going to war, the guecha warriors are described to stay one month in a temple, with people outside singing and dancing and the Muisca honouring Sué and Chía. The warriors sleep and eat little during this time. After the battles, the people perform the same ritual for various days and when the warriors are defeated, they also do this to lament the losses.|$|E

25|$|Determined to {{help the}} boys slay the griefer, the {{executives}} decide to give the boys the Sword of a Thousand Truths, a weapon so powerful that it {{was removed from the}} game and stored on a 1 GB USB flash drive. Unaware of the plan however, <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>have</b> already initiated what becomes a seventeen-hour battle against the griefer. The executives arrive at Stan's house with the flash drive, unaware that the boys are actually at Cartman's house. Randy tells the executives that he can log in with the sword and give it to the boys' characters online. Eventually logging onto a demo of the game at a Best Buy, Randy gives Stan the weapon, but Randy's character is mortally wounded by the griefer in the process. Enraged, Stan attacks the griefer with the sword, allowing Kyle and Kenny to attack. Cartman approaches him and proceeds to smash the griefer's head with a hammer. Numerous World of Warcraft players celebrate the griefer's demise, praising the boys as heroes.|$|E
500|$|Stump called [...] "This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race" [...] the [...] "funkiest thing we’ve ever done", and {{attributes}} {{the change in}} musical style to his love of soul music, which he acquired by listening to oldies stations as a child. Wentz describes the song [...] "a bit of '70s funk mixed with [...] Take This to Your Grave with tight verses and big, fat choruses". The song closing sing-along was influenced by Justin Timberlake's [...] "Señorita". Cory Apar of Allmusic compared the Babyface-produced track [...] "I'm Like a Lawyer with the Way I'm Always Trying to Get You Off (Me & You)" [...] to Maroon 5. Wentz characterized Stump’s vocal performance on the song as [...] "straight-up Motown", continuing to say [...] "If there wasn't a rock band playing, it'd be straight R, and he'd go on tour with just an upright bass and a drum and open up for R. Kelly." [...] "The Carpal Tunnel of Love" [...] {{has been referred to}} as [...] "a prime slab of what <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>have</b> become famous for: highly caffeinated pop-punk mixed with a little white-boy soul and some hard-core yelping." [...] The song features Stump singing in a falsetto in the chorus over Trohman’s [...] "crunchy" [...] guitars, as well as a breakdown in which Wentz employs death growl-style vocals.|$|E
500|$|Elton John, the English {{singer and}} songwriter, {{appears as a}} guest vocalist for Chef's song, {{in one of the}} {{earliest}} celebrity spoof appearances on South Park; Trey Parker, who provided the voice for Elton John, said many people thought it was the actual John singing because his impression was so accurate. In another musical reference featured in the episode, several characters claim the real-life Canadian rock group Loverboy wrote a song {{about the fact that the}} DNA of an elephant and pig will not splice. [...] "An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig" [...] includes several pop cultural references to films and television shows. The last line in the episode, [...] "That'll do pig", spoken by Cartman, is a reference to the final line of the 1995 film Babe, a movie about a talking pig, which Stone has described as one of his favorite films. When the boys try to tell Officer Barbrady about the clone, he suggests that <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>have</b> seen too many episodes of the X-Files. In the scene in which Pip is introduced, Stan asks Pip about his peculiar name, but Cartman interrupts Pip during his answer. Pip's reply – [...] "my father's family name being Pirrip and my Christian name Phillip, my infant tongue--" [...] – is identical to the opening line of the Charles Dickens novel Great Expectations, which is narrated by its protagonist, Pip. The fourth season episode [...] "Pip" [...] is a parody and comedic retelling of the novel, and stars Pip, who assumes the role of his namesake.|$|E

2500|$|The school {{practices}} a five-and-a-half-day week {{consisting of}} 40 periods (or [...] "schools"), each of 40 minutes. The school day begins with [...] "first bell" [...] soon after 6:15am. <b>The</b> <b>boys</b> <b>have</b> chhota haazri before doing calisthenics outdoors {{on the playing}} fields. There are eight classes in total with a 20-minute break and lunch in between. All meals are served in a central dining hall, and boys from each table take turns acting as waiters for their table-mates.|$|E
2500|$|In a Cheyenne {{version of}} the story, the giant bear pursues the girls and kills most of them. [...] Two sisters escape back to their home with the bear still {{tracking}} them. [...] They tell two boys that the bear can only be killed with an arrow shot through the underside of its foot. [...] <b>The</b> <b>boys</b> <b>have</b> the sisters lead the bear to Devils Tower and trick it into thinking they have climbed the rock. [...] The boys attempt to shoot the bear through the foot while it repeatedly attempts to climb up and slides back down leaving more claw marks each time. [...] The bear was finally scared off when an arrow {{came very close to}} its left foot. [...] This last arrow continued to go up and never came down.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} his post-fascist transition, Negoiţescu is even {{alleged to}} have rallied with Communist Party-led organizations. Discussing this rumor in his 1946 {{correspondence}} with Deliu Petroiu, Ion Dezideriu Sîrbu speculated about the possibility that his friends were merely seeking to survive in a new society facing communization: [...] "A certain political indifferentism gives an absurd hue to all hopes for the best. The red dies are cast. [...] <b>The</b> <b>boys</b> <b>have</b> affiliated with the communists. That is to say Nego, Regman and Doinaş. They were promised a weekly magazine, funds etc. Nego even hopes for a visa and a passport to France." [...] Sîrbu expressed a belief that the Sibiu Circle cell could form [...] "an honest island in this chaos of asserted and legalized ignorance", and stated that, in case this was not possible, he would join them in planning an escape, through Arad County, to a Western Allied-controlled territory.|$|E

2500|$|Following the verdict, Suárez {{received}} {{support from}} a number of colleagues who believed it to be unjust, including Celso Otero, Diego Lugano, and Sebastián Abreu. Liverpool legend John Barnes described the reaction and punishment as a [...] "witch hunt". Gus Poyet described the ban as [...] "incredible, shocking, disproportionate" [...] due to cultural differences. To demonstrate support for Suárez, his teammates and manager wore a T-shirt bearing Suárez's name and image before a match against Wigan Athletic. Kenny Dalglish was supportive of the action, saying it was [...] "a great reflection of the man as a character, a person and a footballer that <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>have</b> been so supportive and so have the supporters" [...] and that he had deserved the support. The T-shirts provoked criticism from prominent black footballers fighting against racism such as Paul McGrath, who described the incident as [...] "shameful", while Jason Roberts and Olivier Bernard were both critical of the show of support. Dalglish later said the decision to wear the T-shirts [...] "might not have been right", but claimed it wasn't his decision for the players to do so, while Ferguson wrote in [...] that the stunt was [...] "ridiculous".|$|E
