40|$|Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) {{prevalence}} in Great Lakes {{fish populations}} varies seasonally, with greater prevalence during spawning seasons. Chronic infections {{appear to be}} associated with neural tissue, while acute forms target endothelial tissue. Given the potential immunosurpessive effect of water temperature variation in natural environments, I investigated the effect of a 5 ºC temperature change on disease development due to VHSV infection in fathead minnow Pimephales promelas. Fish were exposed to VHSV genotype IVb and either a temperature increase from 10 ºC to 15 ºC, decrease from 20 ºC to 15 ºC, or a stable temperature of 15 ºC. I evaluated prevalence of gross lesions and death, tested fish for VHSV via cell culture of pooled visceral tissue, and performed quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays on brain tissue and pooled visceral tissue extracts. Fish <b>that</b> <b>experienced</b> temperature decrease had greater VHSV prevalence than those <b>that</b> <b>experienced</b> temperature increase, and more tested positive by qRTPCR of brain tissue than those <b>that</b> <b>experienced</b> no change, suggesting greater prevalence of infections. Visceral organ samples from fish <b>that</b> <b>experienced</b> either temperature change contained higher viral RNA N-gene copy numbers than those from fish <b>that</b> <b>experienced</b> stable temperature, while brain tissue samples contained similar viral RNA copy numbers among all groups. In fish that contained more viral RNA copies in viscera than brain, those fish <b>that</b> <b>experienced</b> either temperature change had a greater difference between the two quantities than those <b>that</b> <b>experienced</b> no temperature change. The severity of chronic infections was not affected by temperature change, but the severity of acute infections was increased in fish <b>that</b> <b>experienced</b> any temperature change. These results suggest that fish that encounter temperature changes, especially decreases, of 5 ºC are at higher risk of contracting chronic VHSV infections and severe acute VHSV infections, helping to explain seasonal fish die-offs attributed to VHSV, especially in fish that encounter temperature change during the spawning season...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: Previous {{research}} {{showed that}} children with cancer {{are at risk for}} developing behavioral adjustment problems after successful treatment; however, the course of adjustment remains unclear. This study focuses on adjustment trajectories of children during treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and aims to distinguish subgroups of patients showing different trajectories during active treatment, and to identify sociodemographic, medical, and psychosocial predictors of the distinct adjustment trajectories. METHODS: In a multicenter longitudinal study, 108 parents of a child (response rate 80 %) diagnosed with ALL were assessed during induction treatment (T 0), after induction/consolidation treatment (T 1), and after end of treatment (T 2). Trajectories of child behavioral adjustment (Child Behavior Checklist; CBCL) were tested with latent class growth modeling (LCGM) analyses. RESULTS: For internalizing behavior, a three-trajectory model was found: a group <b>that</b> <b>experienced</b> no problems (60 %), a group <b>that</b> <b>experienced</b> only initial problems (30 %), and a group <b>that</b> <b>experienced</b> chronic problems (10 %). For externalizing behavior, a three-trajectory model was also found: a group <b>that</b> <b>experienced</b> no problems (83 %), a group <b>that</b> <b>experienced</b> chronic problems (12 %), and a group <b>that</b> <b>experienced</b> increasing problems (5 %). Only parenting stress and baseline QoL (cancer related) were found to contribute uniquely to adjustment trajectories. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the children (77 %) showed no or transient behavioral problems during the entire treatment as reported by parents. A substantial group (23 %) shows maladaptive trajectories of internalizing behavioral problems and/or externalizing behavioral problems. Screening for risk factors for developing problems might be helpful in early identification of these children...|$|R

5|$|As weather {{conditions}} shift due to climate change, bees change their behaviors. When it rains, bees {{do not go}} out and during extremely hot weather they try to gather water to keep the colony cool. Climatologists have predicted that the occurrence of extreme weather events (such as intense rainy seasons and prolonged drought) will increase as the climate continues to change. Additionally, in regions <b>that</b> <b>experience</b> increasingly more rain, pollen will be washed away more easily {{making it more difficult}} for bees to provide for their colonies. Meanwhile, in environments experiencing prolonged drought, flower environments may dwindle with dry weather. These patterns lead to less suitable and viable environments in which bees can thrive. A British journal published projections of plant diversity loss against spatial sensitivity; the researchers found major species loss {{in the southern part of}} the UK forcing bee colonies further north.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, Sharif Hussein, {{trying to}} garner {{support for his}} planned {{uprising}} against the Ottomans, sent his son Faisal to Damascus to lobby the Syrian notables on his behalf. Faisal, a member of al-Fatat himself, met secretly {{with other members of}} the society, including Quwatli, in the house of Nasib al-Bakri. When the Ottoman authorities learned of the meeting, they ordered the arrest of al-Bakri and his two brothers, Fawzi and Sami, accusing them of treason. Quwatli was charged by the al-Fatat leadership with the task of facilitating their escape, in which he succeeded. In retaliation, Ottoman authorities placed him under arrest, in which he was subjected to torture and humiliation. Nevertheless, Quwatli refused to confess to anything, and his captors failed to implicate him in the operation so they released him a month later. The tremendous pressure of <b>that</b> <b>experience,</b> however, took its toll on the young Quwatli, and upon his release he retired to his country house in Saidnaya and stopped all contacts with members of al-Fatat and the opposition.|$|E

5|$|The {{book had}} {{chapters}} on memory, imitation and suggestion, perceptual illusions, and esthetics. In these he refuted the idea <b>that</b> <b>experience</b> {{was just the}} external environment acting on and molding a mind working as a passive recipient. Stratton saw the sensation of time as being multidimensional, in analogy with perception of space. That we could simultaneously hear separately, without synthesizing, multiple mixed tones meant our experiences did not necessarily come in single file temporally. To Stratton this meant time had multiple dimensions, since simultaneous events could not be distinguished on the one past-present-future dimension of time alone. He did not address how the other dimensions could be in temporal-space if the events were indistinguishable temporally to begin with. He also analyzed poetic measure as mathematically connected to the waxing and waning span of attention, tying the arts to psychology. This last was rebutted by Charles Samuel Myers, writing in Nature, who saw poetry and its rhythm as too complex a subject to be reduced to the arithmetic of attention spans.|$|E

5|$|The {{thermal wind}} {{relation}} {{does not explain}} why the winds are organized into tight jets, rather than distributed more broadly over the hemisphere. One factor {{that contributes to the}} creation of a concentrated polar jet is the undercutting of sub-tropical air masses by the more dense polar air masses at the polar front. This causes surface low pressure and higher pressure at altitude. At high altitudes, lack of friction allows air to respond freely to the steep pressure gradient with low pressure at high altitude over the pole. This results in the formation of planetary wind circulations <b>that</b> <b>experience</b> a strong Coriolis deflection and thus can be considered 'quasi-geostrophic'. The polar front jet stream is closely linked to the frontogenesis process in midlatitudes, as the acceleration/deceleration of the air flow induces areas of low/high pressure respectively, which link to the formation of cyclones and anticyclones along the polar front in a relatively narrow region.|$|E
