More importantly, like many other industrial processes, the pretreatment system is multivariate and the variables in the system are inter-related to different extents, which means that studying the relationships of the key variables is of critical importance {{for the improvement of}} downstream enzymatic saccharification yield.

Endogenous acid production {{has never been}} measured directly in dialysis patients and an empiric formula is used to estimate acid production from their protein catabolic rate. We have studied acid-base balance in 19 stable CAPD patients attending the peritoneal dialysis clinic of Mount Sinai Hospital. They obtained a 24 hour collection of peritoneal dialysis fluid and urine while consuming their usual diet and performing their usual activities. <b>Total</b> <b>alkali</b> gain was calculated from net GI alkali absorption plus urinary net acid excretion plus alkali gain from dialysate, while total acid production was measured directly from the urinary and dialysate excretions of sulfate and organic anions. Net GI alkali absorption was estimated from the difference between cations (Na + K + Ca + Mg) and anions (Cl + 1. 8 P) in the 24 hour dialysate and urine collections minus the daily total amount of lactate infused. All of our patients had a normal or high serum bicarbonate concentration, which was stable with time. <b>Total</b> <b>alkali</b> gain was virtually identical to total acid production (54. 2 vs. 52. 4 mEq/day) which suggests that these patients were in neutral acid-base balance. Net GI alkali absorption (22. 7 mEq/day) {{was one of the}} same range as that of chronic renal failure patients not on dialysis and represented almost one half of the <b>total</b> daily <b>alkali</b> gain. The daily acid production of 52. 4 mEq/day was numerically equal to 84 % of the protein catabolic rate expressed as g/day, which is similar to the predicted value of 77 % of PCR reported in the literature. However, the main source of alkali loss, that is, acid production, was the loss of organic anions in dialysate and urine. Daily sulfate excretion (16 mEq/day) was lower than expected for the level of protein intake (protein catabolic rate of 62 g/day). The stable serum bicarbonate concentrations on long-term dialysis suggests a steady state and neutral acid-base balance in these patients.

40|$|Alkali silica reation (ASR) is {{a common}} {{deterioration}} mechanism of concrete. During ASR, reactive aggregate containing silicon oxide (SiO 2) can react with the alkaline fluid in the concrete pores. To test whether a concrete mix is prone to ASR, several concrete prism tests (CPT) are developed. Performance tests are defined as a CPT where the alkali content in the concrete is {{comparable to that of}} a conventional concrete. During CPT, leaching or ingress of alkalis can affect the result of the test, as proven by Lindgård et al. (2013 b). However, Lindgård measured leaching and ingress by testing the leachate, lining and wrapping in the test container for alkali, but not the prisms themselves. In my master thesis project, I have investigated four concrete prisms that have been tested with different concrete prism performance tests. The prisms had experienced different degrees of leaching or ingress according to Lindgårds measurements. The prisms were cut and ground to give concrete powder samples that I tested using cold water extraction (CWE) and hot acid extraction (HAE). Aggregates were also ground and tested with these methods to account for alkali contribution from the aggregates during CWE and HAE. All samples were tested with thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to investigate the paste content. CWE and HAE produced solutions which were measured for alkali content using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The results were compared to the expected alkali content in the prisms given from the alkali content in the cement from the recipe, minus the measured leaching or ingress. I have investigated all measurements and calculations, and calculated the error based on these. The calculations of errors are based on the principle of error propagation, and I assume all errors are uncorrelated. My results show that HAE is not suitable for measuring <b>total</b> <b>alkali</b> content. CWE does not measure the expected 50 - 60 % of the expected alkali content, but gives consistent results that are not affected by contribution from the aggregates. Free alkali content measured CWE has low errors. Leaching and ingress is indicated in the bulk samples, but the ground profiles does not give any conclusive evidence because of alkali redistribution due to drying. However, transportation of alkali {{from the top of the}} prisms to the bottom is indicated, aswell as leaching in the top and bottom surfaces of the prisms. Because I have not been able to measure the <b>total</b> <b>alkali</b> content, I am not able to prove alkali release from aggregates, due to HAE not being able to measure <b>total</b> <b>alkali</b> content.

Diet Sunkist Orange soda increased urinary citrate excretion by 60 mg/day, which was not statistically significant (95 % CI - 75 to 195, P value 0. 34). There was no significant change in pH from the control period to the study period (pH: 6. 29 - 6. 21; 95 % CI: - 0. 09 to 0. 25, P = 0. 30).

40|$|Compositional {{variation}} through basaltic monogenetic eruptive sequences {{provides a}} unique view into the processes and source heterogeneity of small-scale magmatic systems. A well-exposed, continuous sequence on Motukorea volcano in the Auckland Volcanic Field, New Zealand, {{consists of an}} early tuff ring, scoriaceous deposits and late lava flows which allow {{the evolution of the}} eruption to be studied at very high resolution. The deposits show a spectrum of basaltic compositions from Mg# 60 nephelinite (early tuff ring) to Mg# 70 alkalic basalt (lava). Within the deposits of each main eruptive phase (i. e. tuff, scoria and lava) very little variation is observed in major element chemistry, suggesting that fractional crystallisation has a limited effect. Systematic changes in trace element chemistry, however, are significant through the sequence. The major and trace element features observed through the sequence are inferred to be primarily due to the mixing of two magma batches, with a two-fold increase in the degree of melting between these. Variation in Pb-isotopic compositions up-sequence indicates subtle changes in mantle source with samples representing the start of the eruption displaying higher 207 Pb/ 204 Pb than the latter parts of the eruption. This chemical change coincides with a switch in the mode of eruption, with the arrival at the surface of magmas produced by larger degrees of partial melting resulting in the beginning of a more effusive eruption phase. The silica-undersaturated, high <b>total</b> <b>alkali,</b> low Al 2 O 3 and higher 207 Pb/ 204 Pb nature of the samples from the tuff units suggests that these samples were produced by melting of relatively young eclogite domains.

All the three phosphate glass systems exhibited the mixed alkali effect in electrical conduction; the plots of log (electric conductivity), logσ, versus alkali mixing ratio, R/(R+R'), showed a marked minimum at a certain alkali ratio near 1 : 1, indicating that phosphate glasses behave similarly to silicate and borate glasses regarding the mixed alkali effect. No pronounced effect of presence of two kinds of alkali ions {{was seen in the}} density and {{thermal expansion}} coefficient. The plots of glass transition temperature, Tg, and softening temperature, Ts, against the alkali mixing ratio a small minimum as is seen in many mixed alkali silicate and borate glasses...|$|R
40|$|In this {{investigation}} {{a new type}} of recoverable complexing agent (chelating surfactant) has been compared with a conventional complexing agent; diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA), in the metal ion sequestering of thermomechanical pulps (TMP) to be hydrogen peroxide bleached. After different degrees of washing of the pulps, bleaching experiments at different <b>total</b> <b>alkali</b> charges were performed with and without sodium silicate additions, and the ISO brightness of hand-made sheets was measured. The residual hydrogen peroxide in the bleaching liquor was also determined. No significant difference in either the brightness development or the residual hydrogen peroxide content could be detected between the pulps treated with equivalent molar ratios of the different complexing agents. Furthermore, the recovery of the chelating surfactant-manganese complexes from laboratory made white water by froth flotation was also studied. Two different foaming agents; sodium dodecyl sulphonate (SDS) and dimethyldodecylamine oxide (DDAO), were tested in the froth generation. After an addition of 160 ppm of DDAO, more than 80 % of the manganese chelates could be recovered in the foam, containing 3 % of the initial water mass...|$|R
40|$|There {{is almost}} {{not a case}} in {{exploration}} geology, where the studied data doesn’t includes below detection limits and/or zero values, and {{since most of the}} geological data responds to lognormal distributions, these “zero data ” represent a mathematical challenge for the interpretation. We need to start by recognizing that there are zero values in geology. For example the amount of quartz in a foyaite (nepheline syenite) is zero, since quartz cannot co-exists with nepheline. Another common essential zero is a North azimuth, however we can always change that zero for the value of 360 °. These are known as “Essential zeros”, but what can we do with “Rounded zeros ” that are the result of below the detection limit of the equipment? Amalgamation, e. g. adding Na 2 O and K 2 O, as <b>total</b> <b>alkalis</b> is a solution, but sometimes we need to differentiate between a sodic and a potassic alteration. Pre-classification into groups requires a good knowledge of the distribution of the data and the geochemical characteristics of the groups which is not always available. Considering the zero value...|$|R
40|$|The {{bottom of}} the Nuraxi unit (Assorgia et a/., 7 990) has a vitrophiric {{character}} and the unit shows clear evidences of reomorphic flow during cooling. Both characteristics are present in other acid pyroclastic units of the upper section of the pyroclastic pile of Sulcis mainland, SW Sardinia, {{and elsewhere in the}} case of high temperature-deposited pyroclastic flows with high <b>total</b> <b>alkali</b> contents. A detailed mesoand microscopic study of Nuraxi vitrophire shows: 7 / a black and jointed bottom vitrophire (some 40 cm thick) depleted in phenocrysts, with resorbed feldspars; the mesostase reached the sphaerulitic stage of devitrification and shows relicts of an eutaxitic texture. 2 /a transitional grey vitrophire, with several degree of ramdom distributed vesiculation, evidence of fair eutaxitic texture and developed vesiculation. 3 /a sharp horizontal line of color modification that represents the transit towards a flow banded highly macroscopically vesicled reomorphic pyroclastic deposit (Nuraxi unit). The vitrophire overlies a red paleosoil and a 30 cm-thick crystal-rich deposit. All or most of these characteristics could be preserved and recognized in an ancient deposi...|$|R
