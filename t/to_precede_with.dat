In the Serres Municipal Stadium that day (which holds the all-time attendance record with 14,200 tickets) except the locals, also existed around 5000 guest fans from Larissa.Nevertheless, AEL managed <b>to</b> <b>precede</b> <b>with</b> 0-1 but Panserraikos equalized with a disputed penalty.Soon riots appeared between the players on the court and generalized {{at the end of the}} match between the fans (final result 1-1). The next day, thousands citizens of Larissa were gathered and resentful of the injustice marched to the central square of the city. The demonstration took the character of an anti-junta movement. One of the few mass events that were made in Greece before the events of Athens Polytechnic. Two days later AEL submitted an objection for the improper use of the player of Panserraikos Stefanidis. The Regulations Committee EPO upheld the complaint because Panserraikos did not pay the fine of 250 Drachmas for the penalty. On 30 June, the same committee in another meeting and after the intervention of Colonel Aslanidis (himself originating from Serres), dismissed the objection of AEL and promoted Panserraikos to the 1st National.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{explains}} {{the development of}} a computer vision system able to find and orient relatively small objects. The motivations is exchanging a monotonous work done by hand and replace it with an automation system with help of an ABB IRB 140 industrial robot. The vision system runs on a standard PC and is developed using the OpenCV environment, originally made by Intel in Russia. The algorithms of the system is written in C++ and the user interface in C++/CLI. With a derived test case, multiple vision algorithms is tested and evaluated for this kind of application. The result shows that SIFT/SURF works poorly with multiple instances of the search object and HAAR classifiers produces many false positives. Template matching with image moment calculation gave a satisfying result regarding multiple object in the scene and produces no false positives. Drawbacks of the selected algorithm developed where sensibility to light invariance and lack of performance in a skewed scene.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an experimental investigation of flame propagation in a 3. 6 -meter Flame Acceleration Tube (FAT) with square 0. 27 m x 0. 27 m cross section. The {{experiments in the}} FAT {{took place at the}} premises of GexCon AS at Fantoft, Bergen. Constant volume and vented explosion experiments with initial turbulence were performed, with and without baffle plates to induce additional turbulence in the flow. Experiments with both maize starch and propane-air mixtures were conducted. The use of a dump tank with a water deluge system allowed vented experiments to be conducted inside. The previous data acquisition system was reviewed and a new pressure measurement system has been tested. Plexiglas windows equally spaced along one sides of the FAT allowed flame propagation to be recorded with a high-speed video camera. The unique design of the flame acceleration tube allows for comparative studies of flame propagation in gaseous mixtures and dust clouds under the same initial conditions. The experimental data has been analyzed with an aim to identify fundamental differences between gaseous flames and dust flames, suited for research purposes and validation work of computational fluid dynamic codes for both gasand dust explosions. The introduction of additional obstacles in the tube resulted in enhanced flame acceleration for both gas and dust mixtures. The obstructions induced sufficiently high turbulence levels to give a strong indication of local quenching of the dust flames, since the denser obstacle configuration resulted in less flame acceleration than observed for the configuration with half the number of obstacles. The experiments performed with gaseous mixtures and obstacles produced such high explosion pressures that it was decided not <b>to</b> <b>precede</b> <b>with</b> the planned explosion series due to both safety reasons and the damage inflicted on the experimental apparatus. The effect of the different venting areas was as foreseen, where reduced vent area resulted in an increase in the reduced explosion pressure, for both fuel types. In general, the gaseous mixtures produced the highest pressures and the fastest pressure build- up. Flame propagation in a dust clouds can be characterized as premixed combustion with non- premixed substructures. Hence, the degree of volumetric combustion in clouds of maize starch, relative to rich propane mixtures, were investigated, and a clear difference in behavior during the early stages of flame propagation was found. A comparison between the measured pressure histories and recorded flame front positions suggested that the flame fronts of the dust clouds requires a certain induction length before a relative sudden increase in the rate of pressure rise takes place...|$|E
40|$|The safe {{management}} of nuclear waste arising from nuclear activities {{is an issue}} of great importance for the protection of {{human health and the environment}} now and in the future. The primary goal of this report is to identify the current situation and practices being utilized across the globe to manage and store low and intermediate level radioactive waste. The countries included in this report were selected based on their nuclear power capabilities and involvement in the nuclear fuel cycle. This report highlights the nuclear waste management laws and regulations, current disposal practices, and future plans for facilities of the selected international nuclear countries. For each country presented, background information and the history of nuclear facilities are also summarized to frame the country's nuclear activities and set stage for the management practices employed. The production of nuclear energy, including all the steps in the nuclear fuel cycle, results in the generation of radioactive waste. However, radioactive waste may also be generated by other activities such as medical, laboratory, research institution, or industrial use of radioisotopes and sealed radiation sources, defense and weapons programs, and processing (mostly large scale) of mineral ores or other materials containing naturally occurring radionuclides. Radioactive waste also arises from intervention activities, which are necessary after accidents or to remediate areas affected by past practices. The radioactive waste generated arises in a wide range of physical, chemical, and radiological forms. It may be solid, liquid, or gaseous. Levels of activity concentration can vary from extremely high, such as levels associated with spent fuel and residues from fuel reprocessing, to very low, for instance those associated with radioisotope applications. Equally broad is the spectrum of half-lives of the radionuclides contained in the waste. These differences result in an equally wide variety of options for the {{management of}} radioactive waste. There is a variety of alternatives for processing waste and for short term or long term storage prior to disposal. Likewise, there are various alternatives currently in use across the globe for the safe disposal of waste, ranging from near surface to geological disposal, depending on the specific classification of the waste. At present, there appears to be a clear and unequivocal understanding that each country is ethically and legally responsible for its own wastes, in accordance with the provisions of the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management. Therefore the default position is that all nuclear wastes will be disposed of in each of the 40 or so countries concerned with nuclear power generation or part of the fuel cycle. To illustrate the global distribution of radioactive waste now and in the near future, Table 1 provides the regional breakdown, based on the UN classification of the world in regions illustrated in Figure 1, of nuclear power reactors in operation and under construction worldwide. In summary, 31 countries operate 433 plants, with a total capacity of more than 365 gigawatts of electrical energy (GW[e]). A further 65 units, totaling nearly 63 GW(e), are under construction across 15 of these nations. In addition, 65 countries are expressing new interest in, considering, or actively planning for nuclear power to help address growing energy demands to fuel economic growth and development, climate change concerns, and volatile fossil fuel prices. Of these 65 new countries, 21 are in Asia and the Pacific region, 21 are from the Africa region, 12 are in Europe (mostly Eastern Europe), and 11 in Central and South America. However, 31 of these 65 are not currently planning to build reactors, and 17 of those 31 have grids of less than 5 GW, which is said to be too small to accommodate most of the reactor designs available. For the remaining 34 countries actively planning reactors, as of September 2010 : 14 indicate a strong intention <b>to</b> <b>precede</b> <b>with</b> introduction of nuclear power; 7 are preparing but haven't made a final decision, 10 have made a decision and are preparing infrastructure, 2 have ordered a new nuclear power plant, and 1 has a plant under construction. In all countries interested in pursuing nuclear power, it is necessary for the governments to create an environment for investment and advancement of nuclear power, including development of a professional and independent regulatory framework and regime, knowledge and refinement of skills in nuclear safety and control, definition of policies on nuclear waste management and decommissioning, and participation in international non-proliferation measures. Specifically related to radioactive waste management, nuclear facilities and industries that utilize radioactive material work to well-established safety standards for the management of their waste...|$|E
