5|$|With current treatments, {{patients}} with low and intermediate risk disease {{have an excellent}} prognosis with cure rates above 90% for low risk and 70–90% for intermediate risk. In contrast, therapy for high-risk neuroblastoma {{the past two decades}} resulted in cures only about 30% of the time. The addition of antibody therapy has raised survival rates for high-risk disease significantly. In March 2009 an early analysis of a Children's Oncology Group (COG) study with 226 high-risk patients showed <b>that</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> after stem cell transplant 66% of the group randomized to receive ch14.18 antibody with GM-CSF and IL-2 were alive and disease-free compared to only 46% in the group that did not receive the antibody. The randomization was stopped so all patients enrolling on the trial will receive the antibody therapy.|$|E
5|$|On November 12, 1976, as Fox {{was driving}} to the family home at Morrill Street in Port Coquitlam, he became distracted by nearby bridge construction, and crashed {{into the back of}} a pickup truck. While his car was left undriveable, Fox emerged with only a sore right knee. He again felt pain in December, but chose to ignore it until the end of {{basketball}} season. By March 1977, the pain had intensified and he finally went to a hospital, where he was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a form of cancer that often starts near the knees. Fox believed his car accident weakened his knee and left it vulnerable to the disease, though his doctors argued there was no connection. He was told that his leg had to be amputated, he would require chemotherapy treatment, and that recent medical advances meant he had a 50-percent chance of survival. Fox learned <b>that</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> before, the figure would have been only 15 percent; the improvement in survival rates impressed on him the value of cancer research.|$|E

25|$|On February 18, 1841, {{a meeting}} {{was held to}} discuss the idea of {{creating}} a government in Oregon Country. This meeting was held at Leslie’s home, and was in part a response to the death of pioneer Ewing Young. Young had died without a will or known heir, so the settlers needed a way to settle his estate as his business dealings were entangled with many of the other settlers. Not only did David Leslie host this meeting, but he also participated in the discussions about forming a government. Although only a few decisions were ultimately made (election of Dr. Ira L.

25|$|A {{study from}} Oxford University {{found that the}} sports-related costs of London 2012 was USD 15 billion, {{compared}} to USD 4.6 billion for Rio 2016, USD 40-44 billion for Beijing 2008 and USD 51 billion for Sochi 2014, the most expensive Olympics in history.

In 2005 London secured the bid for the 2012 Summer Games with a cost estimate <b>that</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> later proved inadequate and was revised upwards with around 100 percent. Then, when {{it turned out that the}} final outturn costs were slightly below the revised budget, the organizers falsely, but very publicly, claimed that the London Games had come in under budget.

25|$|Until {{the late}} 20th century, it was {{generally}} believed <b>that</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> after Bernini's death, Queen Christina of Sweden, then living in Rome, commissioned Filippo Baldinucci to write his biography, {{which was published in}} Florence in 1682. However, recent research now strongly suggests that it was in fact Bernini's sons (and specifically the eldest son, Mons. Pietro Filippo) who commissioned the biography from Baldinucci sometime in the late 1670s, with the intent of publishing it while their father was still alive. This would mean that first, the commission did not at all originate in Queen Christina who would have merely lent her name as patron (in order {{to hide the fact that}} the biography was coming directly from the family) and secondly, that Baldinucci's narrative was largely derived from some pre-publication version of Domenico Bernini's much longer biography of his father, as evidenced by the extremely large amount of text repeated verbatim (there is no other explanation, otherwise, for the massive amount of verbatim repetition, and it is known that Baldinucci routinely copied verbatim material for his artists' biographies supplied by family and friends of his subjects). As the most detailed account and the only one coming directly from a member of the artist's immediate family, Domenico's biography, though published later than Baldinucci's, therefore represents the earliest and more important full-length biographical source of Bernini's life, even though it idealizes its subject and whitewashes a number of less-than-flattering facts about his life and personality.|$|E

500|$|Bede {{writes that}} after Wulfhere became king: [...] "Free {{under their own}} king, they [...] gave willing {{allegiance}} to Christ their true king, {{so that they might}} win his eternal kingdom in heaven". [...] While Wulfhere's father had refused to convert to Christianity, and Peada had apparently converted in order to marry Oswiu's daughter, the date and the circumstances of Wulfhere's conversion are unknown. It has been suggested that he adopted Christianity as part of a settlement with Oswiu. Bede records <b>that</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> before Penda's death, his son Peada converted to Christianity, influenced partly by Oswiu's son Ealhfrith, who had married Peada's sister Cyneburh. Peada brought a Christian mission into Mercia, and it is possible that this was when Wulfhere became a Christian. Wulfhere's marriage to Eormenhild of Kent would have brought Mercia into close contact with the Christian kingdoms of Kent and Merovingian Gaul, which were connected by kinship and trade. The political and economic benefits of the marriage may therefore also have been a factor in Wulfhere's Christianisation of his kingdom.|$|E

500|$|Nomura {{sought to}} make Cloud's design [...] "distinctly {{different}} from the other characters." [...] About thirty different designs were made for Cloud's face, and his hair was altered both to give it a more realistic look and to illustrate <b>that</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> had passed since the game's conclusion. The staff attempted rendering Cloud based on the game's original illustrations, but concluded that doing so left his eyes unrealistically big, which [...] "looked gross." [...] Further revisions were made to Cloud's face after completion of the pilot film, which featured a more realistic style. In contrast to his hair, Cloud's clothes were difficult to make in the film. Deciding to give Cloud a simple costume consistent with the concept of [...] "clothes designed for action", the staff began {{with the idea of a}} black robe, eventually parring it down to a [...] "long apron" [...] shifted to one side. Cloud's weaponry was based on the joking observation that because his sword in the original game was already enormously tall, in the sequel, he should use sheer numbers. Referred to as [...] "the fusion swords" [...] during the film's development, early storyboard concepts included Cloud carrying six swords on his back, although the idea was later modified to six interlocking swords. While the idea wasn't [...] "logically thought out" [...] and the staff didn't think that they could [...] "make it work physically", it was believed to provide [...] "an interesting accent to the story." [...] Cloud's new motorcycle, , was designed by Takayuki Takeya, who was asked by the staff to design an upgraded version of Cloud's [...] "Hardy-Daytona" [...] motorcycle from Final Fantasy VII. As development continued, the bike got bigger, with Takeya feeling its heaviness provided an impact that worked well within the film.|$|E
