Infrared spectra revealed the incomplete extraction after all three extraction methods applied to M. circinelloides and it was shown that mechanical disruption using bead beating and HCl treatment were necessary to complete the extraction in this species. FTIR spectroscopy was used to identify components, such as polyphosphates, that may have negatively affected the extraction process and resulted in differences in extraction efficiency between M. circinelloides and M. alpina. Residual lipids could not be detected in the infrared spectra of M. alpina biomass after extraction using the Folch and Lewis methods, indicating their complete lipid extraction in this species. Bligh extraction underestimated the fatty acid content of both M. circinelloides and M. alpina biomass and an increase in the initial solvent-to-sample ratio (from 3 : 1 to 20 : 1) was needed to achieve complete extraction and a lipid-free IR spectrum.

40|$|AbstractThe bovine seminal plasma {{contains}} phosphocholine-binding proteins, which {{associate to}} sperm membranes upon ejaculation.

In this work, we determined {{physical and chemical}} parameters controlling this efflux by characterizing <b>the</b> <b>lipid</b> <b>extraction</b> induced by BSP 1, the most abundant of BSP protein in bull seminal plasma, from model membranes with different composition. The model membranes were formed from binary mixtures of 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (POPC) with 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -hydroxy-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (Lyso-PC), 1, 2 -dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (DPPC), 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphoethanolamine (POPE), 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphoserine (POPS) or cholesterol. The modulation of BSP 1 -induced lipid extraction from membranes by their chemical composition and their physical properties brings us to propose a 3 -step extraction mechanism. First, the protein associates with membranes via specific binding to phosphocholine groups. Second, BSP 1 penetrates in the membrane, essentially in the external lipid leaflet. Third, BSP 1 molecules solubilize a lipid patch coming essentially from the outer lipid leaflet, without any lipid specificity, to ultimately form small lipid/protein auto-assemblies. The stoichiometry of these complexes corresponds to 10 – 15 lipids per protein. It is also shown that fluid-phase membranes {{are more prone to}} BSP 1 -induced lipid extraction than gel-phase ones. The inhibition of <b>the</b> <b>lipid</b> <b>extraction</b> in this case appears {{to be related to the}} inhibition of the protein penetration in the membrane (step 2) and not to the protein association with PC head groups (step 1).

40|$|This PhD thesis {{focused on}} the {{analysis}} and application of microbial membrane lipids as biomarkers in marine sediments. Existing protocols for <b>lipid</b> <b>extraction</b> from marine sediments and biomass were modified. In addition, recent protocols based on high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) as well as state-of-the-art mass spectrometric analysis by quadrupole time-of-flight (MSqTOF) and the triple quadrupole (MSQQQ) mass spectrometer were used to investigate matrix effects and evaluate the reliability of quantitative analysis in marine environmental samples. <b>The</b> improved <b>lipid</b> <b>extraction</b> and quantification were used to analyze Black Sea water column and sediments samples {{to a depth of}} 8 meters from site GeoB 15105 taken during cruise M 84 / 1 (DARCSEAS) with R/V Meteor to apply lipid analysis in benthic bio systems. With this component specific differentiation between planktonic and benthic lipid signature we assessed possible lipid sources. Here, this high detail lipid fingerprinting allowed us to observe changes in the head group and lipid core structures of <b>the</b> intact polar <b>lipids</b> according to <b>the</b> geochemical zonation...|$|R
