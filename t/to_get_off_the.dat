5|$|According to Nathan Fillion, {{there was}} an episode in which the crew land on a dying planet. The {{inhabitants}} try to steal Serenity, after they explain to the crew about their need <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> planet.

While everyone else is asleep, Mal takes the ship himself and discovers that help never would have arrived.|$|E
5|$|The five UH-1 gunships {{immediately}} strafed Viet Cong {{positions with}} 2.75-inch rockets, {{but failed to}} suppress the enemy fire. After South Vietnamese soldiers had disembarked from the helicopters, one CH-21 was too severely damaged <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ground. A second CH-21 was sent to rescue the crew, but it too was immobilized {{as soon as it}} touched the ground. One of the Hueys returned to pick up the crews of the two downed CH-21s. As it prepared to land, the main rotor was struck by enemy gunfire. The aircraft flipped over to the right and crashed. Almost simultaneously, a third CH-21 sustained heavy damage and was forced to land on the rice fields a short distance from the first two helicopters. By 10:30, all the South Vietnamese soldiers who had landed on the field were under heavy fire from inside Ap Bac and refused to move. Sergeant Arnold Bowers, who had ridden in the first crashed helicopter, raced back and forth to rescue injured American airmen.|$|E

5|$|In May 1941 the {{majority}} of Layforce were sent as reinforcements to the Battle of Crete. Almost {{as soon as they}} landed it was decided that they could not be employed in an offensive role and would instead be used to cover the withdrawal route towards the south. They were ill-equipped for this type of operation, as they were lacking in indirect fire support weapons such as mortars or artillery; they were armed mainly with rifles and a few Bren light machine guns. By 31 May the evacuation was drawing to a close and the commandos, running low on ammunition, rations, and water, fell back towards Sphakia. In the end, {{the vast majority of the}} commandos were left behind on the island, becoming prisoners of war. About 600 of the 800 commandos that had been sent to Crete were listed as killed, missing, or wounded; only 179 commandos managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> island. In April 1941 men from No. 7 Commando took part in the Bardia raid, but by late July 1941 Layforce had been severely reduced in strength. Reinforcements were unlikely given the circumstances. The operational difficulties that had been exposed during the Bardia raid, combined with the inability of the high command to fully embrace the Commando concept, had largely served to make the force ineffective. The decision was made to disband Layforce.|$|E
5|$|The Duke of Wellington {{felt that}} the {{remainder}} of the day's events should be cancelled following the accident at Parkside, and proposed to return to Liverpool. However, a large crowd had gathered in Manchester to see the trains arrive, and was beginning to become unruly. Wellington was persuaded to continue to Manchester. By the time the trains reached the outskirts of Manchester the crowd had become hostile and was spilling onto the tracks. With local authorities unable to clear the tracks, the trains were obliged to drive at low speed into the crowd, using their own momentum to push people out of the way. Eventually they arrived at Liverpool Road railway station in Manchester to be met by a hostile crowd, who waved banners and flags against the Duke and pelted him with vegetables. Wellington refused <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> train, and ordered that the trains return to Liverpool. Mechanical failures and an inability to turn the locomotives meant that most of the trains were unable to leave Manchester. While the Duke of Wellington's train left successfully, only three of the remaining seven locomotives were usable. These three locomotives slowly hauled a single long train of 24 carriages back to Liverpool, eventually arriving 6 hours late after having been pelted with objects thrown from bridges by the drunken crowds lining the track.|$|E
5|$|The {{change in}} England's opening pair {{did not result}} in an {{improvement}} on the scoreboard. A run out was narrowly avoided from the first ball, and Washbrook and Emmett appeared to be uncomfortable on a surface that offered early assistance to the bowlers. With 22 runs on the board, Johnston bowled Washbrook with a yorker, and six runs later, Emmett fended a rising ball from Lindwall to Barnes at short leg, leaving England 28/2. Edrich eschewed attacking strokeplay as he and Compton attempted to establish themselves. Lindwall bowled a series of short balls. One hit Compton on the arm and the batsman attempted to hook another bouncer, but edged it into his face. This forced Compton to leave the field with a bloodied eyebrow with the score at 33/2. Edrich and Crapp then engaged in grim defensive batting, resulting in one 25-minute period where only one run was added. They reached lunch at 57/2. Upon the resumption, Crapp began to accelerate, hitting a six and three boundaries from Johnson. Australia took the new ball and Lindwall trapped Crapp lbw for 37. Dollery took a single <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> mark but then missed a yorker from Johnston and was bowled. England had lost two wickets for one run to be 97/4. After 170 minutes of slow batting, Edrich gloved a rising Lindwall delivery and was caught behind. At 119/5, Compton returned to the field, his wound having been stitched to stop the bleeding. Yardley fell to Toshack for 22 with the score at 141/6, bringing Evans to the crease. Compton combined with the gloveman to add 75 runs for the seventh wicket in 70 minutes, before Lindwall removed Evans to leave England 216/7.|$|E

5|$|Two {{companies}} of the 1st Hampshires landed {{very close to}} the strong point at Le Hamel, and had to fight inland through enemy garrisons <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> beach. Attempts to flank Le Hamel were made difficult by the surrounding machine gun placements, mines, and barbed wire. Elements of the 1st Hampshires captured the German strongpoint WN-36 at {{the eastern edge of the}} village of Asnelles. When they turned west to move along the beach towards their primary objective at Le Hamel, they came under heavy fire and had to break off the attack. Major Warren, in charge after the commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel Nelson Smith was wounded, decided that the troops would have to circle around and attack the emplacement from the rear, a process that took several hours. The troops began to have some success around 15:00 with the arrival of an AVRE tank of 82nd Assault Squadron. The tank fired two petards into the sanatorium, where most of the defenders were located. The German soldiers fled into fortified houses in Le Hamel and Asnelles, and were taken out in house-to-house combat. Few surrendered. The 75mm gun was finally silenced at 16:00, when the AVRE tank fired a large petard charge into the rear entrance of the casemate. C/A Company, 1st Hampshires and the AVRE tank proceeded west along the beach and took out strongpoint WN-38 at La Fontaine St Côme, taking 20 prisoners. Still further west, D Company captured strong point WN-39 at the Arromanches radar station, capturing 30 more defenders.|$|E
5|$|Upon the resumption, Crapp {{began to}} accelerate, hitting a six—which flew {{directly}} {{back over the}} bowler's head and over the sightscreen—and three driven boundaries from the off spin of Ian Johnson. This was {{a stark contrast to}} Johnson's first ten overs before lunch, which had yielded only seven runs. Crapp was eager to use his feet to get to the pitch of Johnson's deliveries, and subsequently dealt with the spin fairly comfortably, whereas many of his compatriots stood in their crease and found matters much more difficult. He then hit Toshack to Barnes at short leg, but the catch was dropped. However, Crapp did not capitalise as Toshack conceded only eight runs in a sequence of eight overs. Australia took the new ball with the score at 87 and Lindwall trapped Crapp—who did not offer a shot—leg before wicket for 37; the batsman misjudged the line of a straight ball and thought it had pitched and struck his leg outside off stump. Tom Dollery came in and took a single <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> mark but then missed a Johnston yorker and was bowled. This dismissal mirrored that of Washbrook's in that Dollery failed to detect Johnston's variation ball, and thus played for swing when there was none. England had lost two wickets for one run to be 97/4. Captain Norman Yardley came in and played the fast bowling of Lindwall and Johnston with relative ease, retreating onto the back foot to allow himself more time to play his shots. Edrich was struck on the hand and Yardley edged to Keith Miller in the slips cordon on the half-volley.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the 2012–13 season, May went {{on trial}} with League Two club Gillingham, {{training}} {{with the club}} {{for a number of}} weeks and playing in several pre-season friendlies. However, no move materialised, and May signed for Conference South side Dover Athletic on a free transfer on 8 August 2012. May made his competitive debut for Dover in a 2–2 away draw against Sutton United on 21 August 2012, coming on as an 86th-minute substitute. He made his first start four days later as Dover defeated AFC Hornchurch 1–0 at Hornchurch Stadium, before scoring his first goal for the club in a 3–1 away win at Eastleigh on 1 September. May went on to score in seven consecutive games running from September to November, five of which in the league and a further two in the FA Cup, subsequently taking his goal tally for the season to eight. Goals in convincing victories over Weston-super-Mare and Truro City took May's goal count into double figures. He ended the year with a run of five goals in three matches, scoring braces in wins against Eastleigh and Hayes & Yeading United, as well as scoring a late consolation strike in a 2–1 defeat to Tonbridge Angels on 26 December 2012. It took May a month <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> mark {{at the start of the}} new year, controlling the ball and scoring on the turn in a 3–2 win over Welling United at the Crabble Athletic Ground on 9 February 2013. He scored four times in March 2013, subsequently taking his tally for the season to over 20 goals – the first time May had reached this milestone in his career. He scored two further times during the regular season, in away victories against Chelmsford City and Staines Town. Dover finished the season in third place, meaning they would play fourth placed Eastleigh in the two legged play-off semi-finals. May scored a dipping volley as Dover took a 3–1 lead in the first leg, controlling the ball on his chest with his back to goal, turning and hitting the ball from 25-yards past Ross Flitney in the Eastleigh goal. Dover progressed to the final, but lost 3–2 to Salisbury City after extra-time, with May playing in all three play-off matches. During his one season at Dover, May finished the season as the club's top goalscorer, scoring 24 times in 45 matches.|$|E
