According to the ALA, a challenge is an attempt by a person or group to remove or restrict materials from a library or school curriculum. The series was challenged for being too frightening for young people and depicting occult or demonic themes. By 1997, the ALA was informed of 46 challenges, over 75% of which occurred in school libraries. The rest of <b>the</b> <b>challenges</b> were held in public libraries or the location of <b>the</b> <b>challenges</b> were unknown. The same year, a hearing by the Anoka-Hennepin School District to ban the books was broadcast by C-SPAN.
