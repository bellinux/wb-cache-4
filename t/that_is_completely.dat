As a result, NY171, which does not interchange with the highway, no longer connects to any other signed state routes. NY171 is the only signed state highway in New York <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>completely</b> isolated from {{the remainder of the}} state highway system.|$|E
5|$|The film {{rights to}} the novel were {{licensed}} in the 1990s, several years after Heinlein's death. The project was originally entitled Bug Hunt at Outpost 9, and had been in production before the producers bought the rights to Starship Troopers. The film was directed by Paul Verhoeven, who found the book too boring to read, and released in 1997. The screenplay, by Ed Neumeier, shared character names and some plot details with the novel. The film contained several elements that differed from the book, including a military <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>completely</b> integrated with respect to gender. It had the stated intention of treating its material in an ironic or sarcastic manner, in order to undermine the political ideology of the novel. The mechanized suits that featured prominently in the novel were absent from the film, due to budget constraints.|$|E

25|$|Ecosystem {{function}} {{describes the}} foundational processes of natural systems, including nutrient cycles and energy fluxes.

A functional ecosystem, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>completely</b> self-perpetuating (no management required), is {{the ultimate goal of}} restorative efforts.

The holotype does not exist; the original description by Alexander von Humboldt in 1812 describes an animal that is much darker (grayish) than those that exist close to the type locality, and the description includes a dark tail tip, a character <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>completely</b> unknown in any population of the species.

25|$|Environmental {{considerations}} of wine packaging reveal benefits and drawbacks of both bottled and box wines. The glass {{used to make}} bottles is a nontoxic, naturally occurring substance <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>completely</b> recyclable, whereas the plastics used for box-wine containers are typically much less environmentally friendly. However, wine-bottle manufacturers have been cited for Clean Air Act violations. A New York Times editorial suggested that box wine, being lighter in package weight, has a reduced carbon footprint from its distribution; however, box-wine plastics, even though possibly recyclable, can be more labor-intensive (and therefore expensive) to process than glass bottles. In addition, while a wine box is recyclable, its plastic bladder most likely is not.|$|E
25|$|To {{celebrate}} {{the opening of}} the Mint Museum Uptown, the Mint Museum of Craft+Design, Charlotte, US, launched Project Ten Ten Ten on October 1, 2010. Ten innovative international artists in the fields of glass, jewelry, furniture and fiber art where commissioned, including Ted Noten, to create exclusive works for the permanent collection of the museum. Noten developed an interactive piece called SLOW - Eleven Women and 400 Daisies as an homage to the Mint Museum's Auxiliary women, as well as to all American women. SLOW consists of a golden buste, with the features of ten famous American women, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>completely</b> covered with white 3D-printed nylon daisies. The daisies double as brooches and every new Auxiliary member will be given one to wear. That way it will take appr. 18 years before the entire buste is revealed (hence the title SLOW).|$|E

25|$|Topical {{steroids and}} {{antibiotic}} ointments such as Neosporin {{have not only}} shown to be ineffective in treating dermatophytosis caused by Aphanoascus fulvescens, but have {{also been shown to}} enhance its fungal growth. Ringworm infections caused by A.fulvescens in animals have been successfully treated with anti-fungal drugs such as Tinactin, which contains tolnaftate as its active ingredient, and Grisactin, which contains griseofulvin as its active ingredient. However, topical treatment of human A.fulvescens infections with tolnaftate-containing drugs has been shown to worsen the lesions, causing further inflammation and increased sensitivity. Treatment with griseofulvin has proven somewhat effective in reducing lesion sizes and appears to have a dose-dependent effect. It should be noted however that while lesions continue to heal after increased griseofulvin administration, there is some residual scarring of the infected area. Currently, there is no documentation providing evidence of an anti-fungal treatment <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>completely</b> effective against human dermatophytosis caused by A.fulvescens.|$|E
25|$|Goram’s name {{seems to}} have been {{borrowed}} from Iseult’s father, the king of Ireland in early versions of the romance of Tristan and Iseult, which might suggest that the legend arose sometime after 1200. Gorm is Irish for 'blue' or 'dark-skinned'. The Christian name Vincent is first found in England in the 13th century, suggesting a fashionable cult of the saint (St Vincent the Deacon) around that time. These two factors conspire to suggest a possible 13th-century origin for the Bristol legend, but <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>completely</b> uncertain. It is not known, for example, whether the Clifton hermit was himself called Vincent and later became associated with the famous saint. St Vincent might also have been known in Bristol relatively early through the city’s wine trade with Portugal and Spain (he was born in Huesca, lived and worked in Zaragoza, and is patron saint of Lisbon and of vintners).|$|E
25|$|I had {{my editor}} count shots. There are 139 dance {{shots in the}} film. 111 are Natalie Portman untouched. 28 are her dance double Sarah Lane. If you do the math, that's 80% Natalie Portman. What about duration? The shots that feature the double are wide shots and rarely play for longer than one second. There are two {{complicated}} longer dance sequences that we used face replacement. Even so, if we were judging by time, over 90% would be Natalie Portman. And to be clear, Natalie did dance on pointe in pointe shoes. If {{you look at the}} final shot of the opening prologue, which lasts 85 seconds, and was danced completely by Natalie, she exits the scene on pointe. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>completely</b> her without any digital magic. I am responding to this to put this to rest and to defend my actor. Natalie sweated long and hard to deliver a great physical and emotional performance.

Most are {{funded by the}} Washington University Student Union, which has a $2 million plus annual budget <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>completely</b> student-controlled {{and is one of}} the largest student government budgets in the country. Known as SU for short, the Student Union sponsors large-scale campus programs including WILD (a semesterly concert in the quad) and free copies of the New York Times, USA Today, and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch through The Collegiate Readership Program; it also contributes to the Assembly Series, a weekly lecture series produced by the University, and funds the campus television station, WUTV, and the radio station, KWUR. KWUR was named best radio station in St. Louis of 2003 by the Riverfront Times despite the fact that its signal reaches only a few blocks beyond the boundaries of the campus. There are 11 fraternities and 9 sororities, with approximately 35% of the student body being involved in Greek life. The Congress of the South 40 (CS40) is a Residential Life and Events Programming Board, which operates outside of the SU sphere. CS40's funding comes from the Housing Activities Fee of each student living on the South 40.|$|E
