25|$|Until recently, major Eakins {{scholars}} persistently denied he was homosexual, {{and such}} discussion was marginalised. While {{there is still}} no consensus, today discussion of homoerotic desire plays a large role in Eakins scholarship. The discovery of a large <b>trove</b> <b>of</b> Eakins' personal papers in 1984 has also driven reassessment of his life.|$|E

50|$|The Hildesheim Treasure, {{unearthed}} on October 17, 1868 in Hildesheim, Germany, is {{the largest}} collection of Roman silver found outside imperial frontiers. Most of it can be dated to the 1st century AD.

It is generally believed that the treasure was the table service of a Roman commander, perhaps Publius Quinctilius Varus, who was militarily active in Germania. However, others also suggest that the treasure may have been war spoils rather than a table service.|$|R

25|$|Much of what {{is known}} of the Art Students' League of Philadelphia comes from Charles Bregler, who was a student for the school's whole 7-year existence. He {{remained}} a lifelong friend to Eakins and his wife, and wrote two lengthy articles in the 1930s about Eakins's teaching methods. He preserved an enormous <b>trove</b> <b>of</b> Eakins papers, memorabilia, and minor works, although it was unavailable to scholars until the 1980s. The Bregler Collection was bought by the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1985.|$|E

However, the results of textual studies, combined with the release in 2014 of a transparently fraudulent copy of the Gospel of John from the same <b>trove</b> <b>of</b> documents as the Gospel of Jesus' Wife, has led to a consensus among scholars that the fragment is a modern forgery.|$|E

40|$|Vocabulary {{is linked}} to culture in perhaps an obvious way. But it’s not just suasive words and {{expressions}} {{that we have to}} guard against. There are also the structural patterns of language. These are loaded with bias, too, and they operate at a much more subtle level. It would be interesting to go beyond the lexicon and to see how the relationship between non-indigenous Australians and the Australian place is revealed in those aspects of our language that are more than theoretical. But for those who love words, Arthur presents a lexical treasure <b>trove,</b> full <b>of</b> wonderful insights and illuminating examples. We need more works like "The Default Country" to explain language, and also to expose it...|$|R

25|$|For decades, the Rosenbergs' sons Michael and Robert Meeropol {{and many}} other {{defenders}} maintained that Julius and Ethel were innocent of spying on their country and victims of Cold War paranoia. After {{the fall of the}} Soviet Union, much information concerning them was declassified, including a <b>trove</b> <b>of</b> decoded Soviet cables, code-named VENONA, which detailed Julius's role as a courier and recruiter for the Soviets and Ethel's role as an accessory. Their sons' current position is that Julius was legally guilty of the conspiracy charge, though not of atomic spying, while Ethel was only generally aware of his activities. The children believe that their father did not deserve the death penalty and that their mother was wrongly convicted. They continue to campaign for Ethel to be posthumously and legally exonerated.|$|E
25|$|Forman's {{papers have}} proven to be a {{treasure}} <b>trove</b> <b>of</b> rare, odd, unusual data {{on one of the most}} studied periods of cultural history. They include autobiographies, guides to astrology, plague tracts, alchemical commonplace books and notes on biblical and historical subjects. They also contain his disputes with the Company of Barber-Surgeons and his largely unsuccessful magical experiments. At one time he possessed the copy of the Picatrix currently in the British Library. Forman left behind a large body of manuscripts dealing with his patients and with all the subjects that interested him, from astronomy and astrology to medicine, mathematics, and magic. His Casebook is the most famous of these resources, though he also produced diaries and a third-person autobiography. His only printed work was a pamphlet advertising a bogus method for divining the longitude while at sea.|$|E
5000|$|At his {{maiden speech}} in the Chamber on 9 December 1896, Spoo spoke in Luxembourgish, and demanded that Luxembourgish should be allowed in the Chamber. His {{justification}} was the following: he argued that Luxembourgish was covered by Article 29 of the Constitution of 1868, which defined the official languages as German and French, and Luxembourgish was, after all, German — and indeed older and more venerable than so-called High German. He described {{it as one of}} the richest and healthiest idioms of the Germanic tongue, containing a treasure <b>trove</b> full <b>of</b> valuable language gems and words. The Chamber of Deputies voted on the question, whether Luxembourgish could be spoken in its sessions, and Spoo's proposition was almost unanimously rejected.|$|R

40|$|Susi {{is now a}} days one of {{the most}} {{familiar}} cookery among us. The birthplace of this cookery seems to be among Miao-Tribe of S. China according to some classics of Han dynasty. At that time (I Century A. D.) it spread to China proper and became one of favorite dishes among Chinese, which developed to its maximum at about XIII Centuries, whence it declined gradually, and had disappeared from ordinary ménu since XVII Century. Some travellers of Sung and Ming Dynasties describes queer Susi of apes, of mayflies etc. among Miaos. Mountain <b>trives</b> <b>of</b> natives in Formosa cook fishes and meat of game beasts in similar ways today. Essentially, Susi is a mixture of cooked rice with fishes, meat, or vegetables, soaked with vinegar, whereas in earlier times, as well as among promitive trives, Susi is a kind of preserved fish, and lactic acid, fermented from starch portion of cooked rice, was used instead of the ordinary vinegar, viz. acetic acid. The authors made survey over methods of Susi-cooking in Japan, and found that there are, according to localities, every phases of transitions between the primitive lactic acid fermentation method to the modern use of the ordinary vinegar. It is noteworthy that the promitive or semi-promitive types of Susi are distributed only in western Japan, including Kinki, Chūgoku, Sikoku and N. Kyūshū. The fact that no primitive forms were found in S. Kyūshū. Means that Susi, a cookery priarily composed of rice and fishes, was not imported to Japan from S. China (Miao) via Formosa, Liukiu and Southern Island, taking advantage of Kurosio. The Black Japan Current. That the primitive formes are distributed exclusively in N. Kyūshū and around Seto-naikai (the Inland Sea of Seto) strongly indicates that Susi was inroduced from Central China over Eastern China Sea directly to our contry, and, since it is a very promitive cookery, directly connected with rice, the paddy rice culture is also very plausible to be imported through the same course with Susi, viz. S. China → Central China → North Kyūshū...|$|R
25|$|An {{interpretation}} of Roman law regarding treasure troves makes an {{appearance in the}} 13th chapter of the Gospel of Matthew. The Parable of the Hidden Treasure is told by Jesus of Nazareth to the crowds surrounding him and his disciples. In the parable, the treasure trove is hidden in a field, which is open country and anyone could conceivably discover something hidden in that location. It's also assumed that the present owner has no knowledge or memory of the treasure. The finder of the treasure kept the trove secret until he could raise capital to purchase the land holding the trove. Selling all he had, the finder purchased the land and then unearthed the trove and, as the finder and owner, he was legally entitled to the entire trove. Jesus compared the kingdom of Heaven to the <b>trove,</b> being <b>of</b> greater value than all a person's earthly wealth and a wise investment that not everyone understands at first.|$|R
25|$|In Idaho and Tennessee {{courts have}} decided that {{treasure}} trove belongs to {{the owner of the}} place where it was found, the rationale being to avoid rewarding trespassers.

However, this judgment was reversed by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania on the basis that it had not yet been decided if the law <b>of</b> treasure <b>trove</b> was part <b>of</b> Pennsylvania law. The Supreme Court deliberately refrained from deciding the issue.|$|R
