500|$|The Chicago Board of Trade Building is a {{skyscraper}} {{located in}} Chicago, Illinois, United States. It stands at 141 W. Jackson Boulevard {{at the foot}} of the LaSalle Street canyon, in the Loop community area in Cook County. Built in 1930 and first designated a Chicago Landmark on May 4, 1977, the building was listed as a National Historic Landmark on June 2, 1978. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 16, 1978. Originally built for the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), it is now the primary <b>trading</b> <b>venue</b> for the derivatives exchange, the CME Group, formed in 2007 by the merger of the CBOT and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. [...] In 2012, the CME Group sold the CBOT Building to a consortium of real estate investors, including GlenStar Properties LLC and USAA Real Estate Company.|$|E
2500|$|In asset {{management}} and securities industries, soft dollars are the benefits provided to an asset manager by a broker-dealer {{as a result}} of commissions generated from financial transaction executed by the broker-dealer for client accounts or funds managed by the asset manager. In a soft dollar arrangement, the investment manager directs commissions generated by a client's or fund's transactions to a broker-dealer or other <b>trading</b> <b>venue.</b> Soft dollars, in contrast to hard dollars (actual cash) which have to be reported, are incorporated into brokerage fees and paid expenses, which may not be reported separately (partly due to the difficulty in their valuation. Most investment managers follow the limitations detailed in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. [...] In particular, if soft dollar arrangements are entered into with respect to registered investment companies and pension plans (ERISA and public plans), compliance with Section 28(e) is generally required. [...] However, hedge funds, which are generally not registered, may not be subject to the limitations of Section 28(e) and, thus, in some cases, the fund's commissions may be used for the adviser's benefit. In situations where fund commissions are used outside of the Section 28(e) safe harbor, full and comprehensive disclosure must be provided to fund investors.|$|E

In general these options can be classified into two broad categories: (1) hidden orders on otherwise lit <b>trading</b> <b>venues,</b> and (2) completely dark <b>trading</b> <b>venues.</b> Our paper investigates the relation between both types of opaque trading. Using a detailed high-frequency dataset, we first show that hidden and dark trading are substitutes: an increase in hidden order trading implies reduced dark trading and vice versa. Second, we show that volatility and imbalanced trading drive the segmentation of trading activity into a visible and an opaque part. Third, we identify market quality variables (spread and visible depth) that drive opaque trading activity either to hidden orders on lit venues or to dark <b>trading</b> <b>venues.</b> Finally, we document a strong positive relation between the fraction of hidden order trading on several alternative lit <b>trading</b> <b>venues...</b>|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{consists}} of three essays. The first essay examines whether an international <b>trade</b> <b>venue</b> clientele effect exists for Canadian shares cross-listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), American Stock Exchange (AMEX) and National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System (NASDAQ). The main hypothesis states that for trades of Canadian cross-listed shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE) and U. S. stock markets, assets with increasing (decreasing) trade costs {{as measured by the}} relative effective half-spreads across <b>trade</b> <b>venues</b> are held in portfolios with the same or expected increasing (decreasing) relative investors' holding periods. The results support this hypothesis for the Canadian cross-listed shares whose trades are executed on the TSE and each U. S. <b>trade</b> <b>venue.</b> The findings suggests that the TSE has consistently lost its share of executed order flow relative to the U. S. primary <b>trade</b> <b>venues,</b> and that this loss is associated with increased relative trade costs on the TSE. The second essay analyzes the determinants of the price impact at the announcement and issue dates for domestic and international seasoned equity offerings (SEOs) for Canadian shares cross-listed on the NYSE/AMEX or NASDAQ. In addition, it analyzes whether the determinants for domestic and international SEOs are the same for shares cross-listed on the NYSE/AMEX and NASDAQ, respectively. The findings indicate that the determinants of the market reaction at the announcement and issue dates for the SEOs of the Canadian cross-listed shares differ for all the studied samples and are unambiguously dependent on the SEO geographic placement and cross-listing U. S. <b>trade</b> <b>venue.</b> Finally, the third essay investigates whether the determinants of underwriter fees are the same for domestic and non-domestic SEOs by Canadian firms cross-listed on the NYSE/AMEX or NASDAQ. The results clearly indicate that the determinants of underwriting fees differ for the domestic and non-domestic SEOs. After controlling for differences in other relevant fee determinants, the underwriter fees for non-domestic SEOs are significantly higher for the Canadian shares cross-listed on the NASDAQ compared to those cross-listed on the NYSE/AMEX...|$|R

40|$|The Market in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) aims to {{increase}} com-petition and to foster client {{protection in the}} European 8 ̆ 5 nancial market.
