5|$|Eventually, Bernard uses Dr. Fred's family {{fortune of}} {{royalties}} from the Maniac Mansion TV series {{to purchase a}} real diamond, both Laverne and Hoagie manage to power their Chron-o-Johns, and the three are reunited in the present. Purple Tentacle arrives, hijacks a Chron-o-John and takes it to the previous day {{to prevent them from}} turning off the sludge machine; he is pursued by Green Tentacle in another pod.Laverne: Uh-oh!Green Tentacle: Don't worry guys! <b>This</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> know I can stop him!}} With only one Chron-o-John pod left, Bernard, Hoagie and Laverne use it to pursue the tentacles to the previous day, while Dr. Fred uselessly tries to warn them of using the pod together, referencing the film The Fly. Upon arriving, the trio exit the pod only to discover that they have been turned into a three-headed monster, their bodies merging into one during the transfer. Meanwhile, Purple Tentacle has used the time machine to bring countless versions of himself from different moments in time to the same day to prevent the Sludge-o-Matic from being deactivated. Bernard and his friends defeat the Purple Tentacles guarding the Sludge-o-Matic, turn off the machine and prevent the whole series of events from ever happening. Returning to the present, Dr. Fred discovers that the three have not been turned into a monster at all but have just gotten stuck in the same set of clothes; they are then ordered by Dr. Fred to get out of his house. The game ends with the credits rolling over a tentacle-shaped American flag, one of the more significant results of their tampering in history.|$|E

25|$|In 1939, I {{was officially}} demanded {{to join the}} National Socialist Party. At <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> was already Technical Director at the Army Rocket Center at Peenemünde (Baltic Sea). The {{technical}} work carried out there had, in the meantime, attracted more and more attention in higher levels. Thus, my refusal to join the party would have meant that I would have to abandon the work of my life. Therefore, I decided to join. My membership in the party did not involve any political activity.|$|E

25|$|If {{you recall}} my would-be Sherlock Holmesian {{assessment}} of Professor Moriarty's – sorry , Professor Illingworth's – plan {{to recapture the}} Ashes, you will remember {{that it is in}} Sydney, in the Fourth Test, that this cricketing chess player is due to strike and then retire to the corner of his web and seal off reprisals. Those who command the condition of Sydney Cricket Ground and its accessories gave him just the pitch he needed. By <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> fancy, they were nauseated by negation and demanded a win at any price – even at the price of Australian defeat.|$|E
25|$|Why did {{the date}} of Benjamin Britten's death – 4 December 1976 – touch such a chord in me? During <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> was {{obviously}} {{at the point where}} I could recognise the magnitude of such a loss. Inexplicable feelings of guilt, more than that even, arose in me. I had just discovered Britten for myself. Just before his death I began to appreciate the unusual purity of his music – I had had the impression of the same kind of purity in the ballads of Guillaume de Machaut. And besides, for a long time I had wanted to meet Britten personally – and now it would not come to that.|$|E

500|$|In {{the same}} interview, {{when asked whether}} the series had finished, both co-creators {{answered}} with a simultaneous [...] "Yes!".

There {{is more than enough}} Jay in this world", and Beesley added [...] "The end of the story has always felt like the time where they go off and start living their adult life.

500|$|Barrymore's {{first film}} under the {{contract}} was The Sea Beast (1926), loosely based on the 1851 novel Moby-Dick, in which he played Captain Ahab Ceeley. This {{was one of the}} biggest money-makers of the year for Warner Bros. Although Barrymore wanted Astor to play the female lead, she was unavailable, and Dolores Costello was cast in her place. He later said that [...] "I fell in love with her instantly. <b>This</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> knew I was right", and the couple began an affair. Costello's father was angered by the relationship, but his complaints were ignored by both Costello and her mother: Costello's parents separated and were divorced as a result. The film was well received by critics, and Mordaunt Hall, the film critic of The New York Times, praised the [...] "energy, earnestness and virility" [...] Barrymore displayed in the role of Ceeley.|$|E
500|$|... "Rabiosa" [...] {{was written}} by American rapper Armando Pérez, better known by his stage name Pitbull, Dominican rapper Edward Bello, and Shakira, for the singer's ninth studio album Sale el Sol (2010). The album {{marked the first time}} she worked with Bello, who is better known by his stage name El Cata, and their {{collaboration}} started after Shakira expressed her desire to experiment with merengue music, saying [...] "I grew up listening to merengue— that {{was a big part of}} my life, and I was missing it". Merengue is a type of music and dance originating in the Dominican Republic, and after being referred to Bello by Pitbull, Shakira travelled to the country and began recording sessions with him in his [...] "tiny" [...] studio in Santo Domingo. Bello talked about his collaboration with Shakira, saying [...] "If I was thinking that this little studio was going to be in the world’s vision at <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't believe it".|$|E

500|$|Adamson also {{desired to}} make the film larger in scale; [...] "I've gained {{confidence}} having gone through the first. <b>This</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> {{was able to go}} larger [...] scale, with more extras and bigger battle scenes." [...] Inspired by a passage in the novel where Reepicheep says he would like to attack the castle, a new battle scene in which Peter and Caspian make an attempted raid on Miraz's castle was created. Adamson felt the imagery of mythological Greek creatures storming a castle was highly original. Markus and McFeely used the sequence to illustrate Peter and Caspian's conflict and Edmund's maturity, in an effort to tighten the script by using action as drama. Adamson preferred subtlety to the drama scenes, asking his young male actors not to perform angrily. Adamson copied Alfred Hitchcock by [...] "tell people {{at the end of the}} scene, 'Now just give me something where you're not thinking about anything.' By using it in context, the audience will read an emotion into it." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the podium}} interview, {{conducted}} by Gerhard Berger, Rosberg expressed his {{satisfaction with the}} victory, saying: [...] "The start made the race. It was a great start and I managed to defend in {{the first couple of}} corners and then I really just tried to push flat out <b>this</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> was really happy with the car and happy to see the gap open up to Lewis, so it really worked out perfectly today." [...] Meanwhile, Lewis Hamilton conceded that his teammate had done a [...] "fantastic job," [...] stating that [...] "t the end of the day, he was quicker during the race." [...] Speaking about his start at the post-race press conference, Hamilton explained that his car suffered from a lot of wheelspin, which made him get off the line slowly. Meanwhile, third placed Felipe Massa told the press that his team had [...] "managed to get the opportunities, which it was a mistake of another team," [...] adding that the changes made to the car were [...] "definitely positive." ...|$|E
500|$|Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone {{said that}} [...] "Lacrymosa" [...] {{features}} Lee [...] "sobbing hysterically over a grand piano". According to the IGN reviewer, Ed Thompson, the song [...] "takes the trademark Evanescence sound - Lee's celestial voice, and adds her brooding lyrics 'I can't change who I am, not <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> won't lie {{to keep you}} near me and in this short life, there's {{no time to waste}} on giving up. My love wasn't enough'.". Danielle Baudhuin from The Oshkosh West Index noted that [...] "Lacrymosa" [...] was musically similar to [...] "Haunted" [...] from the band's debut studio album Fallen, noting how [...] "creepy background choir vocals and violins send listeners into a gothic Cathedral-like setting". Jim Farber from the Daily News said that [...] "Lacrymosa" [...] will remind older listeners of the 1970s art rock horror band Renaissance. Andree Farias from Christianity Today observed that the song had no connection with the movie Narnia whatsoever classifying it as [...] "just another bitter break-up anthem".|$|E

500|$|Sukhdev Sandhu of The Daily Telegraph was {{generally}} negative about the film, stating, [...] "The Human Centipede has its moments, but they're largely obscured by umpteen {{holes in the}} plot {{as well as by}} reams of exposition" [...] and that it was [...] "an ultimately underwhelming affair that's neither sick or repellent enough to garner the cult status it so craves." [...] The New York Times review by Jeannette Catsouli noted that whether the film was [...] "a commentary on Nazi atrocities or a literal expression of filmmaking politics, the grotesque fusion at least silences the female leads, both of whose voices could strip paint." [...] Writing in the Chicago Sun Times, Roger Ebert did not assign the film a star rating (not to be confused with awarding it zero stars), stating, [...] "I am required to award stars to movies I review. <b>This</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> refuse to do it. The star rating system is unsuited to this film. Is the movie good? Is it bad? Does it matter? It is what it is and occupies a world where the stars don't shine." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} in September 2008 and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 chart. Lovato recalled the experience, [...] "It was like, O.K., you've done it. You're no longer just succeeding because you're in a movie with the Jonas Brothers. These people bought your music for you." [...] Later in February 2009, Lovato's first headlining sitcom, Sonny with a Chance, premiered on Disney Channel. Don't Forget was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and spawned two singles, [...] "Get Back" [...] and [...] "La La Land". In January 2009, Lovato announced to MTV News that she had already begun writing songs for her second studio album, as well as revealing its approach: [...] "It's {{going to take a}} different sound, so hopefully it goes over well. I sing a lot of rock, but <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> want to do more John Mayer-ish type of songs. Hopefully I can write with people like him. I love their music — it would be amazing." ...|$|E
500|$|On July 26, 2002, {{only a week}} or {{two before}} signing a record {{contract}} with Universal South Records, West had an injury to his left arm which threatened his musical career and guitar playing. He says, [...] "I locked myself out of my house. But I'd done that before, and I had a way of breaking in through a window. But <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> had a really hard time getting the window open. I started pushing up on the window really hard and my hand broke through the glass. Blood starting spewing out of my left arm everywhere and I ran down my street screaming for help. After seeing so much blood, I went into shock and just blacked {{out in the middle of}} the street. The next thing I can remember is some construction workers praying over me in Spanish and then being taken to the hospital." [...] West was told that the chances were low of regaining the full use of his left arm, having come very close to severing a major artery. He recovered after the accident, however, and was able to continue playing guitar and record for his first studio album.|$|E
