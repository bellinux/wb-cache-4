40|$|Background: Health {{warnings}} on cigarette packages provide smokers {{with universal}} {{access to information}} on the risks of smoking.

40|$|Background: Tobacco {{prevention}} {{studies show}} that graphic health warnings are more effective than <b>text</b> <b>warnings,</b> {{but there are no}} data on the effectiveness of different types of graphic health warnings in a Pakistani population. Even marginal differences in the effectiveness of genres can be of potential significance for public health. Objective: To study the effectiveness of different types of graphic tobacco warnings in a Pakistani population. Study Design: We presented ten anti-smoking warnings to randomly selected volunteers (n = 170) and recorded their opinion on the effectiveness of each warning. The warnings were based on a range of images aimed at the diverse population interviewed. A grading scale based on appeal, application, educational potential and motivation towards cessation was used to produce a composite grade of perceived effectiveness of the warning. Results: Our results indicate that graphic warnings reach a greater proportion of the population than <b>text</b> <b>warnings.</b> Those appealing to logic, and those inculcating a sense of fear by showing a deleterious outcome of smoking, were judged likely to be most effective in motivating smokers to quit and preventing experimental smokers from forming a habit...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} in-vehicle warnings for accident-provocative situations (accidents ahead, new traffic signals, {{police cars}} on emergency runs, etc.). Candidate warnings were developed for 30 hazards based on drawings from 10 drivers. Subsequently, 75 drivers ranked these warnings. Preferred warnings {{were not always}} in the standard U. S. highway sign set. In general, <b>text</b> <b>warnings</b> were slightly preferred over symbolic warnings. In a third experiment, 20 drivers were shown 10 hazard location cue designs: 2 text, 4 arrow, 3 overview, and 1 inside-out. Of the location cues, text ("on right, " "behind, " etc.) was best understood. ...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This study {{examined}} {{the effect of the}} placement of a <b>warning</b> <b>text</b> before visiting proanorexia websites on actual access of these websites. Method: A separate webpage with a <b>warning</b> <b>text</b> aiming at first-time visitors was placed before each proanorexia web-site hosted by a Dutch Internet provider. During the research period of 1 year, the numbers of hits at the warning webpage were registered together with the num-bers of hits at the underlying proanorexia website. Results: Of the total number of hits registered at the warning webpage, about two-third of the visitors were regis-tered at the underlying proanorexia web-site. This indicates that about one-third of the visitors did not continue their visit to a proanorexia website after being exposed to the <b>warning</b> <b>text.</b> Discussion: Placement of a <b>warning</b> <b>text</b> before proanorexia websites appears a promising strategy in holding back potential visitors.

This study used an experimental method with Indonesian adult smokers as participants. The results indicate that mortality warnings on cigarette packs conveyed in the form of pictures are more effective to influence the perception of health risks, compared to <b>text</b> <b>warnings.</b> The picture of deadly diseases caused by smoking ismore effective than the pictures do not show the deadly disease. Perceived health risk significantly mediates the effect of mortality warning on cigarette repurchase intention. However, smoking self-esteem does not significantly moderate the effect...|$|R

40|$|Background: The UK (UK) {{became the}} third {{country in the}} European Union to require {{pictorial}} warnings {{on the back of}} cigarette packs, in October 2008. Methods: A repeat cross-sectional survey was conducted with 11 - 16 -year-olds in the UK between August and September 2008 (N= 1401) and August and September 2011 (N= 1373). At both waves the same <b>text</b> <b>warnings</b> appeared on the front and back of packs, with the only difference being the inclusion of images on the back of packs to support the <b>text</b> <b>warnings</b> in 2011. Warning related measures assessed were salience (noticing, looking closely at warnings), depth of processing (thinking about warnings, discussing them with others), comprehension and credibility (warning comprehensibility, believability and truthfulness), unaided recall, persuasiveness (warnings as a deterrent to smoking), avoidance techniques (eg, hiding packs) and a behavioural indicator (forgoing cigarettes due to warnings). Results: For never smokers, warning persuasiveness and thinking about what warnings are telling them when the pack is in sight significantly increased from 2008 to 2011, but warning comprehensibility significantly decreased. For experimental smokers, there was a significant increase from 2008 to 2011 for warning persuasiveness, believing warnings and considering them truthful. For regular smokers, there were no significant changes from 2008 to 2011, except for an increase in hiding packs to avoid warnings and a decrease in warning salience. Conclusions: Including pictorial images on the back of cigarette packaging improved warning persuasiveness for never and experimental smokers, but had a negligible impact on regular smokers. The findings have implications for warning design...|$|R

40|$|Background: As of June 2009 most (89 %) European Union {{member states}} {{continue}} to use mandated text-only health warnings on tobacco products. This study assessed adolescent (aged 11 – 16 years) perceptions of and reactions to these <b>text</b> <b>warnings</b> on cigarette packs in the UK. Methods: Data comes from wave five of the cross-sectional Youth Tobacco Policy Survey in 2008. A total of 1401 adolescents were recruited and health warnings were assessed in terms of salience (noticing, reading), comprehension and credibility, memorability (recall), depth of processing (contemplating, discussing) and persuasiveness (put off smoking, make more likely to stop). Smokers were also asked about behavioural compliance (foregoing cigarettes due to warnings, avoidance of warnings) and perceptions of harm from their smoking (to indirectly assess possible knowledge gained from warnings). Results: Despite moderately high salience of warnings, memorability and, in particular, depth of processing was quite low, with warnings only sometimes thought about and very rarely discussed. Warnings were however considered comprehensible, credible and a reasonable deterrent for occasional and never smokers. Additionally, a third of regular smokers indicated that, in the last month, warnings had stopped them from having a cigarette. However, only 6 % of smokers indicated that warnings made them forego cigarettes frequently. Conclusion: <b>Text</b> <b>warnings</b> help to communicate the dangers associated with smoking and, resultantly, prompt {{a small number of}} smokers to forgo cigarettes and take action to avoid warnings, but depth of processing is low and warnings {{do not appear to be}} achieving their full potential among smokers...|$|R

Moreover, they provide participants with a better understanding of both the functionality of a personal firewall and the consequences of their actions...|$|R
