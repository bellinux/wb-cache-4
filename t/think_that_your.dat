500|$|... "People {{talk about}} how horrible {{it is to be}} brought up Catholic, and it's all true. The main thing was that there was no sense of proportion. I would chew a piece of gum at school, and the nun would say, 'Jesus is very angry with you about that,' and on the wall behind her would be a dying, {{bleeding}} guy on a cross. That's a horrifying image to throw at a little kid. You really could almost <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> talking in line, say, was on a par with killing Jesus." ...|$|E
2500|$|This did not please Mahathir, who had clashed {{on several}} {{previous}} occasions with the judiciary. In one instance, a government order revoking the work permits of two foreign journalists {{critical of the}} government had been over-ruled by the Supreme Court. Mahathir began making heated attacks on the judiciary, telling Time, [...] "The judiciary says, 'Although you passed a law with a certain thing in mind, we <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> mind is wrong, {{and we want to}} give our interpretation.' If we disagree, the Courts will say, 'We will interpret your disagreement.' If we [...] go along, we are going to lose our power of legislation." [...] Mahathir also lashed out at [...] "black sheep ... who want to be ... fiercely independent," [...] accusing them of playing to public opinion. Immediately after this latter statement, the government reassigned several High Court judges to different divisions, including Justice Harun Hashim who was then hearing the UMNO case. However, as the latter case was already in progress, Harun's transfer would not take effect until the case closed.|$|E
2500|$|Commenting to Digital Spy {{about her}} return, Lawrence said: [...] "I've {{not been in}} the show for 11 years and it's not like I've ever thought [...] "I'll never go back", you just <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> chance to go back has gone. It never crossed my mind that the {{occasion}} would ever arise, so when I got the phone call, it was really odd. There was never any doubt that I'd do it for Mike [...] and it's not something that's really been done — I don't think someone's ever died off-screen and then they've done the funeral on-screen. I think everyone was quite wary because it's quite an odd thing to do to have attended his real funeral and then go back to film it all over again. There was some trepidation about how it was going to work. But as soon as we arrived, it was like 11 years of your life had been wiped out and you'd been there the day before [...] I had this really lovely scene with Sid [...] where I said: [...] "Isn't it strange, you imagine you’d come back and everything would be here waiting for us just like it was." [...] Diane's saying everything's moved on, but for me it was the opposite, I'd got back there and everything was the same." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mahathir, who {{had never}} been fond of the judiciary, began making heated {{statements}} about it at this time. Mahathir declared, [...] "The judiciary says, 'Although you passed a law with a certain thing in mind, we <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> mind is wrong, and we want to give our interpretation.' If we disagree, the courts will say, 'We will interpret your disagreement.' ... We know exactly what we want to do, but once we do it, it is interpreted in a different way." [...] Mahathir also lambasted [...] "black sheep ... who want to be ... fiercely independent" [...] and play to public opinion. Soon after, nine judges sitting on the High Court were reassigned to different divisions; Justice Harun Hashim, who presided over the UMNO case, was transferred from appellate and special powers cases to commercial crimes. However, because the UMNO case was already in progress, his transfer would not take effect until the case closed. Harun later ruled that under the evidence presented, it was clear several UMNO delegates had come from unregistered branches of the party. In line with the law, he declared he was forced to declare UMNO an illegal society, and thereby dismissed the case of the plaintiffs. Mahathir soon formed a new party, UMNO Baru (New UMNO), to replace UMNO. Within a year, the suffix [...] "Baru" [...] was dropped, making it just plain [...] "UMNO".|$|E
2500|$|David Stove's {{argument}} for induction, {{based on the}} statistical syllogism, was presented in the Rationality of Induction and was developed from an argument put forward by one of Stove's heroes, the late Donald Cary Williams (formerly Professor at Harvard) in his book The Ground of Induction. Stove argued {{that it is a}} statistical truth that the great majority of the possible subsets of specified size (as long as this size is not too small) are similar to the larger population to which they belong. For example, the majority of the subsets which contain 3000 ravens which you can form from the raven population are similar to the population itself (and this applies no matter how large the raven population is, {{as long as it is}} not infinite). Consequently, Stove argued that if you find yourself with such a subset then the chances are that this subset is one of the ones that are similar to the population, and so you are justified in concluding that it is likely that this subset [...] "matches" [...] the population reasonably closely. The situation would be analogous to drawing a ball out of a barrel of balls, 99% of which are red. In such a case you have a 99% chance of drawing a red ball. Similarly, when getting a sample of ravens the probability is very high that the sample is one of the matching or [...] "representative" [...] ones. So as long as you have no reason to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> sample is an unrepresentative one, you are justified in thinking that probably (although not certainly) that it is.|$|E
