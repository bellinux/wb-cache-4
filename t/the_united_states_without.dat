5|$|Since Norfolk {{contains}} the {{central business district}} of Hampton Roads, {{most of the major}} spectator sports are located there. While the Hampton Roads area has been recently considered as a viable prospect for major-league professional sports, and regional leaders have attempted to obtain Major League Baseball, NBA and NHL franchises in the recent past, no team has yet relocated to the area. Hampton Roads is the second largest metropolitan area in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>without</b> a club in a major professional sports league, after the Austin metropolitan area.|$|E
5|$|The {{localization}} of {{the first}} game was outsourced to Bowne Global, and was handled by the writer Alexander O. Smith and the editor Steve Anderson. While the Japanese version takes place in Japan, the localized version {{is set in the}} United States: because one of the episodes involves time zones, they had to specify where the game takes place, and chose <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>without</b> thinking a lot about it. The Japanese justice system of the original still remained intact in the localization, as changing it would have altered the entire game structure.|$|E
5|$|The {{settlement}} {{history of}} the English-speaking inner circle countries outside Britain helped level dialect distinctions and produce koineised forms of English in South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. The majority of immigrants to <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>without</b> British ancestry rapidly adopted English after arrival. Now {{the majority of the}} United States population are monolingual English speakers, although English has been given official status by only 30 of the 50 state governments of the US.|$|E

5|$|Duvall, who had {{appeared}} in To Kill a Mockingbird (1962), which Foote adapted from the Harper Lee novel, was involved in Tender Mercies as an actor and co-producer from its earliest stages. He said the script appealed to him because of the basic values it underlined and because the themes were universal even though the story was local. Duvall felt it portrayed people from the central region of <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>without</b> parodying them, as he said many Hollywood films tend to do. Duvall's early involvement led to rumors that he had requested Foote write the script for him, something that both men denied.|$|E
5|$|Kiwi was {{acquired}} by the American company Sara Lee following its purchase of Reckitt and Colman in 1991 and Knomark with its brand Esquire Shoe Polish in 1987. The Federal Trade Commission ruled that Sara Lee had to divest its ownership of these companies in 1994 {{to prevent it from}} becoming a monopoly. Since this ruling, Sara Lee has been prevented from acquiring any further assets or firms associated with chemical shoe care products in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>without</b> prior commission approval. The Competition Commission in the United Kingdom investigated the potential monopoly of Sara Lee in the shoe care industry. By the end of 2010, Sara Lee's Household & Body Care division (which included KIWI) {{was acquired}} by S.C.Johnson & Son.|$|E
5|$|Though Houston is {{the largest}} city in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>without</b> formal zoning regulations, it has {{developed}} similarly to other Sun Belt cities because the city's land use regulations and legal covenants have played a similar role. Regulations include mandatory lot size for single-family houses and requirements that parking be available to tenants and customers. Such restrictions have had mixed results. Though some have blamed the city's low density, urban sprawl, and lack of pedestrian-friendliness on these policies, the city's land use has also been credited with having significant affordable housing, sparing Houston the worst effects of the 2008 real estate crisis. The city issued 42,697 building permits in 2008 and was ranked first {{in the list of}} healthiest housing markets for 2009.|$|E

Before his appointment to the vice presidency, Ford served 25 years as U.S. Representative from Michigan's 5th congressional district, the final nine of them as the House Minority Leader.|$|E

5|$|The {{localization}} of {{the game}} was outsourced to a company called Bowne Global, and was handled by writer Alexander O. Smith, who was {{not familiar with the}} Ace Attorney series prior to working on it, and editor Steve Anderson. While the Japanese version {{of the game}} takes place in Japan, the localized version is set in the United States. They would normally have left the setting vague while adapting cultural differences that the target audience would not understand, but because one of the episodes involves time zones, they had to specify where the game takes place, and chose <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>without</b> thinking a lot about it. This became an issue in later games, where the Japanese setting was more obvious. All the voice roles in the localized version of the game were handled by localization staff; Takumi had wanted to do the English voice for Phoenix, but it was handled by Ben Judd.|$|E
