5|$|In September 1969, Cheyenne {{prototype}} #10 (s/n 66-8835) underwent {{wind tunnel}} testing at NASA Ames Research Center, {{to research the}} half-P hop and drag issues. The engineers {{did not realize that}} the fixed mounts used to secure the aircraft in the wind tunnel would not allow the helicopter to move relative to the rotor, as it did in flight. As a result, there was no natural damping of the rotor pitching motion. The remote controllers' lack of sensory feedback from helicopter compounded the situation. During high speed testing to replicate the half-P hop vibration, the rotor oscillations quickly accelerated out of control and struck the <b>tail</b> <b>boom,</b> resulting in the destructive breakup of the helicopter.|$|E
5|$|In many respects, the T-10BM design {{outwardly}} {{resembles the}} Su-27 {{more than the}} Su-27M. During tests of the thrust-vectoring engines and the Su-27M's aerodynamic layout, Sukhoi had concluded {{that the loss of}} manoeuvrability due to the removal of the canards– the design of which imposed a weight penalty on the airframe– could be compensated for by the addition of thrust-vectoring nozzles. Industry progress in the fields of avionics and radars have also reduced the weight and size of such components, which shifted the centre of gravity of an aircraft rearward. Therefore, designers removed the canards (and the dorsal air brake) found on the Su-27M; the size of the vertical tails, aft-cockpit hump and <b>tail</b> <b>boom</b> were also reduced. With such changes, as well as the increased use of aluminium and titanium alloys and composites, designers had reduced the empty weight of the aircraft, while maintaining a similar maximum take-off weight to the Su-27M.|$|E
5000|$|Location of fins - on the {{fuselage}} (over or under), tailplane, <b>tail</b> <b>booms</b> or wings ...|$|R
50|$|Location of {{tailplane}} - mounted high, mid or {{low on the}} fuselage, fin or <b>tail</b> <b>booms.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some types, {{such as the}} Northrop Flying Wing (NX-216H), {{still have}} a tail {{stabilizer}} mounted on <b>tail</b> <b>booms,</b> although they lack a fuselage.|$|R
25|$|The Super Albatross {{was created}} from a Baby Albatross {{fuselage}} pod and <b>tail</b> <b>boom.</b> The wings used the outer panels of the Senior Albatross. The resulting aircraft was of wooden construction, with {{the wings and}} tail surfaces covered in aircraft fabric. The <b>tail</b> <b>boom</b> is a metal tube.|$|E
25|$|Later {{model with}} {{tricycle}} landing gear and propeller rotating around the upper <b>tail</b> <b>boom</b> tube.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{model with}} monowheel landing gear and {{propeller}} in between {{top and bottom}} <b>tail</b> <b>boom</b> tubes.|$|E
50|$|The Impuls concept {{consisted}} of a 2-seat FAR-23 certified aircraft, propelled by an engine in a pusher configuration. Other distinctive characteristics were the two <b>tail</b> <b>booms</b> and the large windows ensuring a broad view. Materials characterising the Impuls, were the in the beginning 1990s {{state of the art}} glass fibre composite used in wings, <b>tail</b> <b>booms</b> and outer fuselage shell. The inner fuselage however, still {{consisted of}} a load carrying steel inner frame as monocoque composite constructions were still very rare back in the ‘90’s.|$|R
50|$|The SAIMAN LB.2 was an {{unconventional}} Italian two seat cabin {{side by side}} sport aircraft designed around 1937, with a single pusher configuration engine, twin <b>tail</b> <b>booms</b> and an early tricycle undercarriage.|$|R
50|$|It was of {{composite}} construction; fabric-covered wooden wings, <b>tail</b> <b>booms</b> and <b>tail</b> {{fitted to}} a metal fuselage but the production model {{would have been}} all-metal. Clamshell doors {{at the rear of}} the fuselage were advertised.|$|R
25|$|On 10 January 2014, {{the third}} powered flight climbed {{higher than the}} {{previous}} flights, testing a new coating on the <b>tail</b> <b>boom</b> and other systems.|$|E
25|$|Enhanced Lynx variant with Westland 30 <b>tail</b> <b>boom</b> and rotor, Gem 60 engines, new wheeled {{tricycle}} undercarriage and MIL-STD-1553 databus. Only one prototype built (serial/registration ZE477 / G-17-24) in 1984.|$|E
25|$|The Nimrod was {{equipped}} with a Magnetic Anomaly Detector (MAD) <b>tail</b> <b>boom.</b> MAD {{was considered to be}} more capable than the Autolycus approach and could also detect submerged submarines operating without diesels or the increasing threat from nuclear submarines. MAD had not been successfully fitted to the Shackleton, possibly because of interference problems from the piston engines and their ignition system.|$|E
25|$|Some P-38G {{production}} was diverted {{on the assembly}} line to F-5A reconnaissance aircraft. An F-5A was modified to an experimental two-seat reconnaissance configuration as the XF-5D, with a plexiglas nose, two machine guns and additional cameras in the <b>tail</b> <b>booms.</b>|$|R
50|$|Two prototypes flew in 1941 and {{the type}} quickly entered production. A total of 1,528 were built, 133 of which were {{converted}} to the Go 244, with two 500 kW (700 hp) Gnome-Rhone engines fitted to forward extensions of the <b>tail</b> <b>booms.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Skycar II of 1941 was a higher-powered version utilising {{stainless}} steel construction and twin <b>tail</b> <b>booms.</b> The four-wheel landing gear {{was intended to}} facilitate a later rebuild to roadability which never occurred. It was built with support from Fred Fisher of General Motors.|$|R
25|$|Although the Rs.III {{differed}} in appearance from its predecessors, {{it was the}} result of the experience gained from building and flying the Rs.I and Rs.II. The broad hull was retained as well as the push-pull tandem nacelles, but the open framework <b>tail</b> <b>boom</b> was replaced by a steel and Duralumin fuselage that sat on the centreline of the high mounted wing and the substantial tubular trusses supporting the wing were replaced by conventional wire bracing.|$|E
25|$|The Dragonfly {{shares the}} Baby Albatross's molded plywood {{fuselage}} pod, aluminium tube <b>tail</b> <b>boom</b> and strut-braced double spar wooden wing, covered in aircraft fabric aft of the spar. The leading edge is a plywood D-cell. The aircraft features dual controls and a retractable {{tricycle landing gear}} with a steerable nose wheel. The engine is started by a ratchet-wire recoil start system that allows restarts in flight, {{as well as on}} the ground.|$|E
25|$|The alloy box {{structure}} {{was attached to}} and carried a box girder <b>tail</b> <b>boom</b> on which the engine, a horizontal tailplane and vertical stabilizer and rudder surfaces were mounted. The rudder projected beneath the boom into the jet efflux and provided effective yaw control even when the aircraft was stationary. The undercarriage was a simple pair of tubular steel skids directly attached to the box structure, porter bars could {{be attached to the}} skids to allow the rotorcraft to be carried by hand.|$|E
5000|$|The {{propeller}} may {{be ahead}} of the tail : inside the framework (Farman III), {{in line with the}} fuselage (RFB Fantrainer), between <b>tail</b> <b>booms</b> (Cessna Skymaster), above the fuselage on wing (Quad City Challenger), on nacelle or axial pod (Lake Buccaneer), or coaxially around rear fuselage (Gallaudet D-4).|$|R
25|$|In March 2009 it was {{reported}} that a modified version named Falco Evo, evo meaning evolution, was being offered. It features larger <b>tail</b> <b>booms</b> and wings which almost double wingspan to 12.5m and increase payload from 70kg to 100kg. The Falco Evo's first flight was expected to take place by mid-2010.|$|R
50|$|In 1985 an {{extended}} version was produced and released as the T-400. The engine was {{changed from a}} 6-cylinder to an 8-cylinder and the <b>tail</b> <b>booms</b> extended by 750 millimetres. Other minor changes {{were made to the}} aerodynamics. Flutter clearance tests were again carried out by ARL and manufacture proceeded.|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} model XA remains popular on {{the used}} aircraft market and aircraft for sale command high prices. Long operational {{use and the}} rigours of land and water operation have resulted in weak points in the design being identified as many older aircraft have suffered from bent wing trailing edges, wing root tube brackets, flying wire shackles and <b>tail</b> <b>boom</b> tubes. Cracked aft vertical stabilizer tubes and main bulkheads are also common. All of these deficiencies can be repaired in used aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The Tiger is {{the first}} {{all-composite}} helicopter developed in Europe. The fuselage of the Tiger is made from 80% carbon fibre reinforced polymer and kevlar, 11% aluminium, and 6% titanium. The entire tail section is made of composites, including the single section <b>tail</b> <b>boom.</b> The rotors are composed of a fibre plastic composite material able to withstand combat damage and bird strikes. The structure of the Tiger also incorporates protection against lightning strikes and electromagnetic pulses via an embedded copper/bronze grid and copper bonding foil.|$|E
25|$|Due to a {{decrease}} of orders, there remained parts for several aircraft. In 1930 the PZL proposed to the Polish Navy a liaison and patrol floatplane variant of Ł.2, designated PZL.9, {{but it was not}} built. Then, the PZL proposed another patrol and fighter floatplane, basing on Ł.2 parts, PZL.15. It was a low-wing braced monoplane with thin <b>tail</b> <b>boom,</b> and utilized wings, tail and engine of Ł.2. It was not built either. Parts of Ł.2 (wings, tail, engine) were utilized in a passenger aircraft prototype PZL.16.|$|E
50|$|The {{monoplane}} {{crashed in}} the summer of 1912, but was rebuilt by Fenwick with the intent of entering in into the Military Trials which were to take place in August that year. The rebuilt aircraft had longer-span wings, larger tail surfaces and shorter <b>tail</b> <b>booms,</b> but retained the Isaacson radial engine.|$|R
5000|$|The shoulder-winged UAV has all {{composite}} material airframe with metal twin <b>tail</b> <b>booms.</b> The drone is propelled by two 2-cylinder 2-stroke gasoline engines of type JPX DC320 from France with 2 x [...] power. There exist {{two versions of}} TAI Baykuş related to propeller configuration, a pusher and a tractor aircraft.|$|R
50|$|Developed from {{a mix of}} the Maurice Farman {{designed}} MF.11 and the Henry Farman designed HF.22, the F.40 (popularly {{dubbed the}} Horace Farman) had an overall smoother outline and smoother crew nacelle. A pair of upper <b>tail</b> <b>booms</b> supported a horizontal tailplane and a curved fin. The aircraft went into production in 1915.|$|R
25|$|The UH-1H also {{features}} a synchronized elevator on the <b>tail</b> <b>boom,</b> which {{is linked to the}} cyclic control and allows a wider center of gravity range. The standard fuel system consists of five interconnected fuel tanks, three of which are mounted behind the transmission and two of which are under the cabin floor. The landing gear consists of two arched cross tubes joining the skid tubes. The skids have replaceable sacrificial skid shoes to prevent wear of the skid tubes themselves. Skis and inflatable floats may be fitted.|$|E
25|$|The SH09 is a light-medium helicopter, {{powered by}} a single Honeywell HTS900 {{turboshaft}} engine. It uses a shrouded fenestron tail rotor and the main rotor features a five-bladed bearingless hub; the shrouded tail rotor has a wider diameter and a thinner chord {{in order to increase}} airflow, while design aspects such as a narrow <b>tail</b> <b>boom,</b> swept-back tips on the main rotor blades, and the shrouded tail rotor purposefully reduce the SH09's noise signature. The HTS900 is capable of providing 1,020-shaft-horsepower, which is reportedly enough to produce high performance levels for the SH09 under hot and high conditions.|$|E
25|$|On 4 July 1983, Bristow Helicopters AS332L Super Puma (G-TIGD) {{crashed on}} landing at Aberdeen. During the {{approach}} to Aberdeen from the North Hutton platform, a loud bang was heard, followed by severe vibration. A PAN call was made to ATC by the crew. Shortly before landing control was lost and the helicopter struck the runway heavily on its side. 10 of 16 passengers received serious injuries. A <b>tail</b> <b>boom</b> panel had become detached in flight and damaged all five tail rotor blades. The resulting imbalance to the tail rotor assembly led to the separation of this unit and subsequent loss of control.|$|E
5000|$|The Model 106 was a four-seat cabin {{aircraft}} with a pusher engine, fixed spatted {{tricycle undercarriage}} and twin <b>tail</b> <b>booms</b> flanking the propeller. The three passengers and pilot {{sat in a}} cabin in the fuselage nacelle, which also housed the pusher [...] Franklin 6A8-225-B8 six-cylinder horizontally-opposed piston engine, driving a cooling fan and pusher propeller.|$|R
5000|$|In March 2009 it was {{reported}} that a modified version named Falco Evo, evo meaning evolution, was being offered. It features larger <b>tail</b> <b>booms</b> and wings which almost double wingspan to 12.5 m and increase payload from 70 kg to 100 kg. The Falco Evo's first flight was expected to take place by mid-2010.|$|R
50|$|Flat-sided <b>tail</b> <b>booms</b> {{are held}} {{away from the}} {{fuselage}} on short stubs and each mounts a straight-tapered fin and rudder, their tips linked by the tailplane. There are shallow, long ventral fins. The C2A has a short-legged, wide track tricycle undercarriage with its mainwheels near to the forward end of the booms and a nosewheel under the forward fuselage.|$|R
