However, the message is clear; to extract meaningful information from scattering images that have extremely high resolution, an often quoted phrase in the crossed beam scattering community applies: [...] "one needs <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> just <b>as</b> <b>much</b> effort in careful calibration of the experiment as in recording the collision data itself".|$|R

25|$|When Genie's father reached {{adulthood}} {{he changed}} his first name to one which was more typically masculine, and his mother began <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> time with him as she could. He became almost singularly fixated on his mother, despite their relentless arguments about her attempts to convince him to adopt a less rigid lifestyle, and treated all other relationships as secondary at best. Soon after Genie's parents married, he prevented his wife from leaving home and beat her with increasing frequency and severity. Her eyesight steadily deteriorated due to lingering effects from the existing neurological damage, the onset of severe cataracts, and a detached retina in one eye, leaving her increasingly dependent on her husband.|$|E
25|$|Maria Pavlovna's {{wedding to}} Prince William {{took place at}} Tsarskoe Selo in 1908, and then, she had {{departed}} for Sweden with her husband. Elizabeth Feodorovna stayed on for time at Alexander Palace in Tsarskoe Selo as guests of the Emperor and the Empress. It was during this period that Dmitri began to form a close bond with Nicholas II, looking upon him as a surrogate father. He would join on him on his daily walks and seek <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> time with him as possible. Nicholas, in turn, treated Dmitri very kindly. He seems to have loved the young man's free spirit and sense of humor, a welcome diversion from the stresses of his daily life. Dmitri wrote several letters to his sister during his stay with Nicholas and Alexandra, describing how much he was enjoying himself there.|$|E
5000|$|By 1979, Jennings was on {{the tail}} end a hot streak that had {{made him one of}} the biggest superstars in country music. He had scored twelve Top 10 country hits since 1973 (including six chart toppers) and had {{recorded}} 4 straight #1 country albums, with 1977's Ol' Waylon also hitting #15 on the pop charts. Along with fellow outlaw Willie Nelson, he was at the forefront of what was being referred to as outlaw country, a musical movement rooted in a rock and roll attitude and musical freedom. Jennings had also become a big box office draw and in-demand recording artist; in 1979, he sang with Nelson and country legend Ernest Tubb on [...] "You Really Lose Your Mind" [...] for Tubb's The Legend and the Legacy album and also appeared on his friend George Jones' duet album My Very Special Guests. Unfortunately, Jennings enormous commercial success ran parallel with a crippling cocaine addiction that was draining his resources. In his autobiography, he admitted <b>to</b> <b>spending</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> $20,000 each time he scored, or about $1,500 a day. A 1977 drug bust had rattled him but he continued using, and in 1980 he would discover that he was broke.|$|R

25|$|The big offseason {{news for}} the team, however, did not involve players or the {{coaching}} staff. At the end of 2014, the team culminated years of searching for a site to construct a new stadium. The team's long efforts were rewarded in December 2014, {{with the passage of}} legislation by the D.C. City Council that committed the city <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as $150 million to acquire and prepare the necessary land at Buzzard Point, which would be leased to the team for at least 30 years. The team was prepared to build a stadium on the site for another $150 million. The bill was signed into law by the outgoing Mayor Vincent C. Gray, in his final days in office. D.C. United hoped to move into its new 'soccer-specific' stadium for the 2017 season, and prepared to play the team's final 2 seasons in RFK Stadium.|$|E
25|$|Mark {{takes over}} running the family fruit and {{vegetable}} stall in the market after his uncle, Pete Beale (Peter Dean), leaves. He also begins casually dating his sister's housemate Shelley Lewis (Nicole Arumugam), but is reluctant {{to tell her about}} his HIV status. Whilst on a trip to Amsterdam, Shelley makes it clear to Mark that she wants to sleep with him, forcing him to admit his HIV status. Shelley is furious that he did not think to tell her this before and tells him she never wants to see him again. Mark takes the rejection badly and stops taking his HIV medication. During Christmas that year, he is rushed to hospital after collapsing. When Shelley finds out that Mark is ill, she returns and admits that she really cares for him and they reconcile. However, Shelley tries to rush things by asking Mark to meet her family and go on holiday with her parents. She becomes infatuated and tries <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> time with him as she can. Mark fears that the relationship is moving too quickly and Mark decides to end it. When he tries to tell Shelley this, she uses emotional blackmail to stop him, saying that she has risked her health being with him so he owes her. When this doesn't work, she threatens to tell everyone about his HIV status, but leaves Walford when her bluff doesn't work.|$|E
25|$|While Wert {{endured the}} humiliating {{situation}} in Mantua {{through the late}} 1560s, he kept his job: he was to remain at least nominally maestro di cappella in Mantua until 1592. The 1560s were productive years for Wert musically, as he produced his first four books of five-voice madrigals during this time, and his first book for four voices. The dedications are significant: one is to Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba, Duke of Sessa, and in the dedicatory preface Wert thanks him {{for the opportunity to}} lead his choir. (Fernández de Córdoba was Governor of Milan from 1558 to 1560.) During the late 1560s Wert had several offers of employment elsewhere, but turned them down. The most significant came in Augsburg in 1566, where Wert's spectacular ability to improvise counterpoint engendered an offer to join the imperial court in Prague, serving Maximilian II, the Holy Roman Emperor. The next job offer he refused came from Parma the next year, the home of the Farnese family. However he became increasingly close to the Este court in Ferrara during the 1570s and 1580s, without actually becoming employed there. While the two courts were closely connected by marriage and mutual interchange of musicians, Ferrara was a place with a profoundly different outlook from Mantua: Ferrara was progressive, while Mantua was supportive of the Counter-Reformation; the progressive tendencies of Ferrara better fitted Wert's musical inclinations. Wert had a good time there; so much so that his employer in Mantua sent a strongly worded letter on 22 December 1584 demanding his immediate return to his post. Wert, however, {{had fallen in love with}} the widowed Tarquinia Molza, the most famous female singer and poet in Italy, who was a lady-in-waiting at the Este court, so he endeavored <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> time as possible in Ferrara. This was the same year that Lucrezia, Wert's wife, died in prison in Novellara.|$|E

5000|$|The {{extensively}} remodeled Anchorage Museum opened under Henry's {{direction in}} 2010. It was {{a project that}} took over ten years and $110 million to complete. According to Henry, the new planetarium included, [...] "one of the only two aurora borealis simulators in the world, in a science exhibit." [...] The museum is Alaska-centered, with static exhibits and artifacts interspersed among dynamic, interactive displays designed, for example, to show the impacts of earthquakes and tsunamis. The revamp was also intended to display more of the museum's permanent holdings than it could formerly show at any one time.

50|$|Customers often receive {{discounts}} on products by buying them through subscription boxes. Many subscription boxes {{are offered in}} tiered levels of value as well as frequency of delivery. This allows subscription boxes to be affordable to {{a wider range of}} customers. Subscription boxes often have products in them that are of greater value than the subscription allowing customers to save money on products they already know they enjoy as well as try new products without having <b>to</b> risk <b>spending</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> on a product they may not enjoy.Choices are minimized for customers which prevents them from becoming paralyzed and makes decisions simpler to make. Because subscriptions are automated after activation, continuing to receive the product and maintain the subscription takes minimal effort for the customer.

But by the end, you get sick of the little problems. You have spent three months inventing the game, and now you have <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> just <b>as</b> <b>much</b> time cleaning it up". The requirements for a person to be considered for participation in a playtest vary. Some playtests are open to anyone who cares to volunteer, while others specifically target professional gamers and journalists. Some playtests also try to evaluate the game's appeal to players with different levels of experience by selecting players with varying exposure to the game's genre.|$|R

500|$|Observing Wenger's {{transfer}} policy in 2009, Sir Alex Ferguson commented that it lacked balance and needed defensive players to solidfy the Arsenal team. The players Wenger recruits {{have often been}} criticised for their character and leadership capabilities; footballer Joey Barton suggested {{it was because the}} manager discouraged them from commanding: [...] "Sometimes you need someone to galvanise and that might be a shouter and bawler. It may not be Arsene's way, but I think they lack that". Wenger is perceived as frugal given his inactivity in transfer windows, but he has denied the stereotype: [...] "Of course people say always to buy but you cannot make careers [...] buy every time you have an injured player.

40|$|Abstract – Efficient motion {{tracking}} of faces {{is an important}} aspect for Human Computer Interaction (HCI). In this paper we combine the Condensation and the Wavelet Approximated Reduced Vector Machine (W-RVM) approach. Both are joined by the core idea <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> only <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> necessary effort for easy to discriminate regions (Condensation) or vectors (W-RVM) of the feature space, but most for regions with high statistical likelihood to contain objects of interest. We adapt the W-RVM classifier for tracking by providing a probabilistic output. In this paper we utilize Condensation for template based {{tracking of}} the threedimensional camera scene. Moreover, we introduce a robust multi-object tracking by extensions to the Condensation approach. The novel coarse-to-fine Condensation yields a more than 10 times faster tracking than state-of-art detection methods. We demonstrate more natural HCI applications by high resolution face tracking within a large camera scene with an active dual camera system...|$|R

Additionally, we utilize Condensation for abstract multi-dimensional feature vectors and provide a template based tracking of the three-dimensional camera scene. Moreover, we introduce a robust multi-object tracking by extensions to the Condensation approach.
