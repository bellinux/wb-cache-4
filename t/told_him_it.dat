5|$|In Istanbul Brand {{was told}} that Moshe Sharett was unable to obtain a visa for Turkey. The Jewish Agency asked Brand to meet him instead in Aleppo on the Syrian-Turkish border. He was reluctant; the area was under British control and he was afraid {{they would want to}} {{question}} him, but the Agency <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> would be safe and he left by train with two of its delegates.|$|E
5|$|While Miller {{was working}} on a BBC Three sitcom he pitched the idea to {{producer}} Stephen McCrum. McCrum criticised the way Miller ended the first script, which ended with Nelson and Marion leave where they live. McCrum <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> was best to set the series in a single place rather than have the characters move from one place to another. McCrum then suggested taking Nelson and Marion, and writing a script about them. Later, another writer, Jon Brown came in to write and at this time rules were set out with regards to writing the show, such as the animals could not be dressed in clothes unless it was in a flashback sequence or during a song.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the revolt, Treblinka II {{continued}} to function and remained a top priority for the SS for another year. Stangl met the head of Operation Reinhard, Odilo Globocnik, and inspector Christian Wirth in Lublin, and decided not to draft a report, as no native Germans had died putting down the revolt. Stangl wanted to rebuild the camp, but Globocnik <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> would be closed down shortly and Stangl would be transferred to Trieste to help fight the partisans there. The Nazi high command may have felt that Stangl, Globocnik, Wirth, and other Reinhard personnel knew too much and wanted to dispose of them by sending them to the front. With almost all the Jews from the German ghettos (established in Poland) killed, {{there would have been}} little point in rebuilding the facility. Auschwitz had enough capacity to fulfil the Nazis' remaining extermination needs, rendering Treblinka redundant.|$|E

5|$|Offa died in July 796 {{and his son}} Ecgfrith 141days later. Coenwulf, {{a distant}} relative, succeeded to the Mercian throne after Ecgfrith's death. Soon after his {{accession}} Coenwulf sought to replace the two archdioceses with one at London, arguing that Pope Gregory I's original plan had been that there be an archbishopric at London instead of at Canterbury. In 797 and 798 Coenwulf sent envoys to Rome to Pope Leo III, suggesting that a new archdiocese be created at London for Æthelhard. The king's envoys laid {{the blame for the}} problems encountered with the Lichfield archdiocese on Pope Hadrian I's incompetence. Displeased by criticism of the papacy, Leo ruled against the king's plan. In 801 Coenwulf put down a Kentish rebellion, allowing him to once more assert his authority in Canterbury and control the archbishopric. Finally, in 802, Pope Leo III granted that Hadrian's decision was invalid, after the English clergy <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> had been achieved by Offa's misrepresentation. Leo returned all jurisdiction to Canterbury, a decision announced by Æthelhard at the Council of Clovesho in 803.|$|E
25|$|In 1938 {{when the}} Chinese Ambassador Wellington Koo called on U. S. Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau to seek {{financial}} aid, the U. S.

Chen (whom Morgenthau had negotiated {{with in the}} past) to America to enquire after credit {{for the purchase of}} flour and grain goods.|$|E
25|$|In June, 2009, the University of the Cumberlands {{rescinded}} its {{invitation to}} a youth group from Broadway Baptist Church in Fort Worth, Texas, to help build homes for the poor, stating they did so because the church {{had been removed from}} the Southern Baptist Convention. This action was condemned by Kentucky Equality Federation because the church pastor stated officials <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> was because of their tolerance of homosexuality.|$|E

25|$|On Sunday, August 22, {{no other}} sign of Ben had been found. A text message {{was sent to}} Edd Sorenson, a veteran cave diver and {{recovery}} specialist with hundreds of dives to his credit, on his yacht in the Bahamas, where he was leading an expedition. He came to Vortex Springs the next day. Other divers, and an official with an international cave-diving rescue organization, <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> was too dangerous to go any further than they already had.|$|E
25|$|The Germans {{attacked}} the West on 10 May. De Gaulle activated his new division on 12 May. The Germans broke through at Sedan on 15 May 1940. That day, with three tank battalions assembled, {{less than a}} third of his paper strength, he was summoned to headquarters and told to attack to gain time for General Robert Touchon’s Sixth Army to redeploy from the Maginot Line to the Aisne. General Georges <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> was his chance to implement his ideas.|$|E
25|$|A {{prominent}} Connecticut official, State Senator George Gunther, and Andy Kosch, a {{high school}} science teacher, pilot, and Whitehead researcher, said that they heard about yet another photograph. They were told that a sea captain named Brown had made a logbook entry describing Whitehead flying over Long Island Sound and had even photographed the airplane in flight. A friend told Kosch {{that he had found}} the captain's leather-bound journal containing a photo of Whitehead in flight and a description of the event. After some difficulty Kosch made contact with the owners of the journal, but they <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> was lost.|$|E

25|$|Larocque {{spent the}} long winter {{in a nearby}} workshop, {{carefully}} supervising the assembly of the arches that were to form the domed roof. The 12 main arches were supplemented by 24 secondary ones and 72 smaller arches. His work also aroused some interest from Ottawa since the blueprints had failed to earn a permit, and more generally {{because he was not}} a registered architect. When they heard construction had begun nonetheless, they tried to have the work stopped. Bishop Paul Piché hired an engineering consultant to visit the building, who <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> was sturdy enough to last another 200 years.|$|E
25|$|On 2 October Hindenburg {{told the}} Kaiser’s Crown Council that Germany {{could no longer}} win a {{military}} victory, and the following day a new government was formed under Prince Max, which approached President Wilson for peace based on the Fourteen Points. When Haig met Foch on 6 October, Foch showed him the newspaper reports of this and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> was {{a direct result of}} the BEF breach of the Hindenburg Line at its strongest point, although the almost simultaneous capitulation of Bulgaria was also a factor and discussions would continue for a month until the ceasefire on 11 November. At the meeting Haig again asked for US divisions for his sector, and was told this was not going to happen.|$|E
25|$|On 7 August 2005, Olmert was {{appointed}} acting finance minister, replacing Benjamin Netanyahu, who had resigned in {{protest against the}} planned Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Olmert, who had originally opposed withdrawing from land captured in the Six-Day War, and who had voted against the Camp David Peace Accords in 1978, was a vocal supporter of the Gaza pullout. After his appointment, Olmert said:I voted against Menachem Begin, I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> was a historic mistake, how dangerous it would be, {{and so on and}} so on. Now I am sorry he is not alive for me to be able to publicly recognize his wisdom and my mistake. He was right and I was wrong. Thank God we pulled out of the Sinai. When Sharon announced he was leaving Likud to form a new party, Kadima, Olmert was one of the first to join him.|$|E

25|$|Shi Yi {{was known}} for leading a frugal and humble lifestyle. Unlike many other officials, he did not {{accumulate}} wealth for his family and never accepted financial aid from others. He was content with having only basic necessities. Sun Quan once went {{on a tour of}} Shi Yi's neighbourhood and saw a large mansion. When he asked who the owner of the mansion was, someone <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> was Shi Yi. However, Sun Quan said that it was definitely not Shi Yi, given his lifestyle. He was proven right. Shi Yi wore very simple clothing and had simple meals every day. He also enjoyed helping the needy so he often donated or gave away his personal savings to the poor. When Sun Quan heard about it, he visited Shi Yi's house and sampled the meals Shi Yi had every day. After the visit, he increased Shi Yi's salary, gave him more rewards and a larger plot of land. However, Shi Yi rejected these rewards and gifts and said that he would feel uneasy if he accepted them.|$|E
25|$|Eden, {{who faced}} {{domestic}} pressure from his party to take action, {{as well as}} stopping the decline of British influence in the Middle East, had ignored Britain's financial dependence on the US {{in the wake of}} the Second World War, and had assumed the US would automatically endorse whatever action taken by its closest ally. At the 'Law not War' rally in Trafalgar Square on 4 November 1956, Eden was ridiculed by Aneurin Bevan: 'Sir Anthony Eden has been pretending that he is now invading Egypt to strengthen the United Nations. Every burglar of course could say the same thing; he could argue that he was entering the house to train the police. So, if Sir Anthony Eden is sincere in what he is saying, and he may be, then he is too stupid to be a prime minister'. Public opinion was mixed; some historians think that the majority of public opinion in the UK was on Eden's side. Eden was forced to bow to American diplomatic and financial pressure, and protests at home, by calling a ceasefire when Anglo-French forces had captured only 23 miles of the Canal. With the US threatening to withdraw financial support from sterling, the Cabinet divided and the Chancellor of the Exchequer Harold Macmillan threatening to resign unless an immediate ceasefire was called, Eden was under immense pressure. He considered defying the calls until the commander on the ground <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> could take up to six days for the Anglo-French troops to secure the entire Canal zone. Therefore, a ceasefire was called at quarter past midnight on 7 November.|$|E
