5|$|In November and December 2009, a {{large number}} of {{television}} critics named <b>The</b> <b>Sopranos</b> the best series of the decade and all time in articles summarizing the decade in television. In numbered lists over the best television programs, <b>The</b> <b>Sopranos</b> frequently ranked first or second, almost always competing with The Wire. In 2013, TV Guide ranked <b>The</b> <b>Sopranos</b> No. 2 in its list of The 60 Greatest Dramas of All Time, In the same year, the Writers Guild of America named it the best-written television series of all time and TV Guide ranked it as the greatest show of all time.

5|$|Like the {{characters}} they portray on the show, {{many of the}} actors on <b>The</b> <b>Sopranos</b> are Italian American. Many cast members had appeared together in films and television series before joining the cast of <b>The</b> <b>Sopranos.</b> The series shares a total of 27 actors with the 1990 Martin Scorsese gangster film, Goodfellas, including main cast members Lorraine Bracco, Michael Imperioli, and Tony Sirico.|$|E
50|$|A fancy car arrives {{just outside}} the studio minutes later. Exiting the vehicle is <b>the</b> <b>soprano</b> whom Krazy was waiting for. <b>The</b> <b>soprano</b> comes to Krazy, and sings a few notes for demonstration. The Swedish girl, who is still up on the movable balcony, applauds <b>the</b> <b>soprano's</b> test act. <b>The</b> Swedish girl is also leaning forward too much before falling off the {{platform}} and onto <b>the</b> <b>soprano.</b> Upon getting smashed by the Swedish girl, <b>the</b> <b>soprano's</b> voice is ruined. <b>The</b> <b>soprano</b> leaves <b>the</b> scene embarrassed. Krazy {{has no choice but}} to pick the Swedish girl for the show.|$|R
50|$|<b>Soprano</b> tessitura: <b>The</b> tessitura of <b>the</b> <b>soprano</b> voice lies {{higher than}} all the other voices except the sopranino. In particular, <b>the</b> coloratura <b>soprano</b> has <b>the</b> highest tessitura of all <b>the</b> <b>soprano</b> subtypes.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>soprano</b> acuto sfogato is {{sometimes}} confused with <b>the</b> <b>soprano</b> sfogato, a singer (often mezzo-soprano) capable, by sheer industry or natural talent, of extending her upper range to encompass some of <b>the</b> coloratura <b>soprano</b> tessitura.|$|R
5|$|Weiner {{conceived}} {{of the script}} in 2000 {{while working as a}} writer for the television sitcom Becker. Before writing the pilot episode, he studied American literature and cinema of the 1950s and 1960s to get a perspective on American culture during that period. Weiner sent the script to <b>The</b> <b>Sopranos</b> creator David Chase, who recruited Weiner to work with him on <b>The</b> <b>Sopranos.</b> Weiner shelved the project for seven years to focus on Chase's program; interest for Mad Men did not surface until the conclusion of <b>The</b> <b>Sopranos</b> final season.|$|E
5|$|Many {{members of}} the {{creative}} team behind <b>The</b> <b>Sopranos</b> were handpicked by Chase, some being old friends and colleagues of his; others were selected after interviews conducted by producers of the show.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sopranos</b> {{is noted}} for its eclectic music {{selections}} and has received considerable critical attention for its effective use of previously recorded songs.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>soprano</b> {{saxophone}} is a higher-register {{variety of}} the saxophone, a woodwind instrument, invented in <b>the</b> 1840s. <b>The</b> <b>soprano</b> is <b>the</b> third smallest member of the saxophone family, which consists (from smallest to largest) of <b>the</b> soprillo, sopranino, <b>soprano,</b> alto, tenor, baritone, bass, contrabass saxophone and tubax.|$|R
5000|$|In a short recitative, <b>the</b> <b>soprano</b> tells [...] "There were shepherds abiding in the field". Handel saved <b>the</b> <b>soprano</b> solo voice {{until this}} point in the narration, exactly as Bach had done in his Christmas Oratorio.|$|R
5000|$|A soprano [...] {{is a type}} of {{classical}} female singing voice and has the highest vocal range of all voice types. <b>The</b> <b>soprano's</b> vocal range (using scientific pitch notation) is from approximately middle C (C4) = 261 Hz to [...] "high A" [...] (A5) =880 Hz in choral music, or to [...] "soprano C" [...] (C6, two octaves above middle C) =1046 Hz or higher in operatic music. In four-part chorale style harmony, <b>the</b> <b>soprano</b> takes <b>the</b> highest part, which usually encompasses <b>the</b> melody. <b>The</b> <b>soprano</b> voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, soubrette, lyric, spinto, and dramatic <b>soprano.</b> <b>The</b> lyric <b>soprano</b> is <b>the</b> most common female singing voice.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sopranos</b> {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as one of the greatest television series of all time. The series also won a multitude of awards, including Peabody Awards for its first two seasons, 21 Primetime Emmy Awards and five Golden Globe Awards. A staple of 2000s American popular culture, the series has been the subject of critical analysis, controversy, and parody. It has spawned books, , high-charting soundtrack albums, and a large amount of assorted merchandise. Several members of the show's cast and crew who were previously largely unknown to the public have had successful careers after <b>The</b> <b>Sopranos.</b> In 2013, the Writers Guild of America named <b>The</b> <b>Sopranos</b> the best-written TV series of all time, while TV Guide ranked it the best television series of all time.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sopranos</b> {{was a major}} ratings success, {{despite being}} aired on premium cable network HBO which is {{available}} in significantly fewer American homes than regular networks. The show frequently attracted equal or larger audiences than most popular network shows of the time. Nielsen ratings {{for the first four}} seasons are not entirely accurate, however, as Nielsen reported aggregate numbers for cable networks prior to January 2004, meaning that people who were included in the ratings estimates were actually watching HBO channels other than the main one on which <b>The</b> <b>Sopranos</b> aired.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sopranos</b> won and was {{nominated}} for a large number of awards over the course of its original broadcast. It {{was nominated}} for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series in every year it was eligible, and is the first cable TV series to receive a nomination for the award. After being nominated for and losing the award in 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2003 (losing the first time to The Practice and the last three to The West Wing), <b>The</b> <b>Sopranos</b> won the award in 2004, and again in 2007. Its 2004 win made <b>The</b> <b>Sopranos</b> the first series on a cable network to win the award, while its 2007 win made the show the first drama series since Upstairs, Downstairs in 1977 to win the award after it had finished airing. The show earned 21 nominations for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series and won the award six times, with creator David Chase receiving three awards.|$|E
50|$|The fourth {{movement}} is {{a trio of}} <b>the</b> <b>soprano,</b> alto and tenor voices; the alto sings the chorale line with the strings while <b>the</b> <b>soprano</b> and tenor perform a duet aria. The {{movement is}} in D minor and 6/8 time.|$|R
50|$|He married <b>the</b> <b>soprano</b> Erina Borlinetto.|$|R
50|$|Similar to most chorale cantatas, {{the opening}} chorus is a chorale fantasia, {{presenting}} the chorale line by line, the cantus firmus here sung by <b>the</b> <b>soprano.</b> Most of <b>the</b> lines are preceded by entries {{of the other}} voices in imitation of motifs independent of the chorale melody. In line 6 the imitation motive is taken from the chorale. In the two last lines 8 and 9 the lower voices enter together with <b>the</b> <b>soprano.</b> <b>The</b> vocal structure is embedded in a concerto of solo violin and two oboes which play the cantus firmus colla parte with <b>the</b> <b>soprano,</b> strings and continuo.|$|R
5|$|The episode {{concludes with}} a {{reference}} to <b>The</b> <b>Sopranos</b> as the screen blacks out on Stewie criticizing the series' finale.|$|E
5|$|The show premiered on HBO on January 10, 1999 {{with the}} pilot episode. <b>The</b> <b>Sopranos</b> {{was the second}} hour-long {{television}} drama series produced by HBO, the first being the prison drama Oz.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the guest}} artists who {{appeared}} {{with the company}} in the 1970s were the baritone Tito Gobbi, as Falstaff (1972), <b>the</b> <b>sopranos</b> Elisabeth Söderström as Emilia in The Makropoulos Case (1978) and Anne Evans as Senta in The Flying Dutchman (1972), and the conductors James Levine (Aida, 1970) and Reginald Goodall (Tristan and Isolde, 1979).|$|E
50|$|His {{partner was}} <b>the</b> <b>soprano</b> Daniela Dessì.|$|R
50|$|His {{wife was}} <b>the</b> <b>soprano</b> Maria Tauberová.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the drum}} corps activity, {{there have been}} two {{separate}} types of instruments that have been classified as <b>soprano</b> voices: <b>the</b> <b>soprano</b> bugle and <b>the</b> piccolo <b>soprano.</b>|$|R
5|$|At {{the close}} of the third season, The Wire was still {{struggling}} to maintain its ratings and the show faced possible cancellation. Creator David Simon blamed the show's low ratings in part on its competition against Desperate Housewives and worried that expectations for HBO dramas had changed following the success of <b>The</b> <b>Sopranos.</b>|$|E
5|$|Chase and {{producer}} Brad Grey of Brillstein-Grey pitched <b>The</b> <b>Sopranos</b> to several networks; Fox showed interest but passed on it after Chase presented them the pilot script. They eventually pitched {{the show to}} Chris Albrecht, president of HBO Original Programming, who decided to finance a pilot episode which was shot in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Many of the show's writers {{worked in}} {{television}} prior to joining the writing staff of <b>The</b> <b>Sopranos.</b> Writing team and married couple Robin Green and Mitchell Burgess, {{who worked on}} the series as writers and producers from the first to the fifth season, had previously worked with Chase on Northern Exposure.|$|E
50|$|Colonne's {{second wife}} was <b>the</b> <b>soprano</b> Elise Vergin.|$|R
50|$|He {{is married}} to <b>the</b> <b>soprano</b> Danielle Borst.|$|R
50|$|Davidson was <b>the</b> <b>soprano</b> soloist in Johann Sebastian Bachs Es erhub sich ein Streit, BWV 19 {{with the}} Orchestra of Saint Lukes and the New York Baroque Soloists under {{conductor}} Mary Greer. She later performed with both groups again as <b>the</b> <b>soprano</b> soloist in Handels Messiahand Bachs Christmas Oratorio.|$|R
5|$|Matthew Weiner, {{who served}} as staff writer and {{producer}} for the show's fifth and sixth seasons, wrote a spec script for the series Mad Men in 2000. The script was passed on to Chase who, after reading it, was so impressed that he immediately offered Weiner {{a job as a}} writer for <b>The</b> <b>Sopranos.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sopranos</b> {{features}} a large cast of characters, {{many of whom}} get significant amounts of character development—regardless of level of importance. Some only appear in certain seasons, while others appear (sporadically or constantly) throughout the entire series. All characters were created by David Chase, unless otherwise noted.|$|E
5|$|Before {{directing}} <b>The</b> <b>Sopranos,</b> many of {{the directors}} had worked on other television series and in independent films. The most frequent directors of the series were Tim Van Patten (20 episodes), John Patterson (13 episodes), Allen Coulter (12 episodes), and Alan Taylor (9 episodes), {{all of whom have}} a background in television. Recurring cast members Steve Buscemi and Peter Bogdanovich also directed episodes of the series intermittently.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>soprano</b> {{saxophone}} can {{be compared}} to the B clarinet, although the clarinet can play an augmented fourth lower and over a fifth higher. Due to the smaller bore of <b>the</b> <b>soprano,</b> it is less forgiving with respect to intonation, though an experienced player will use alternate fingerings or vary breath support, tongue position or embouchure to compensate. Professional players will use the technique of voicing to fix problems with intonation. Due to its similarity in tone to <b>the</b> oboe, <b>the</b> <b>soprano</b> saxophone is sometimes used as a substitute for it.|$|R
50|$|No more {{his fears}} {{alarming}} for <b>the</b> <b>soprano</b> voice.|$|R
