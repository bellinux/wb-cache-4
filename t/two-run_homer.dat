5|$|In the 2014 postseason, Hosmer {{helped lead}} the Royals to a record-setting run, winning three {{consecutive}} extra-inning games. After getting on base five times in the wildcard game against the Oakland A's, Hosmer also slammed a game-winning, <b>two-run</b> <b>homer</b> in Game 2 of the ALDS against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. In doing so, the first baseman became the first player in MLB history to hit both a triple and a home run during extra innings in one year's postseason.|$|E
5|$|The final {{series of}} the home stand {{featured}} the Washington Nationals. After Burnett's poor pitching led some {{to suggest that he}} would retire after the season, he dominated game one by striking out 12 batters and allowing one run in seven innings for a 3–2 win. The Phillies' success continued the next day, when Sandberg started Freddy Galvis and Darin Ruf in place of Chase Utley and Ryan Howard. Ruf and Galvis combined for four hits, two runs and three RBIs in a 4–3 victory. The team swept the series when Sizemore entered the game as a pinch hitter in the sixth inning, and his <b>two-run</b> <b>homer</b> helped the Phillies to an 8–4 final score.|$|E
5|$|Frank Lucchesi {{continued}} {{to manage the}} Sounds in 1989, leading the team to a third-place finish with a 74–72record. Pitcher Hugh Kemp set the career franchise records for games started (73) and walks (207) while playing for the team from 1987 to 1989. The Sounds returned in 1990 to experience their most successful season in the American Association, when they compiled an 86–61 record under manager Pete Mackanin. Ending the regular season in a tie with the Buffalo Bisons, the Sounds won the Eastern Division championship in a one-game playoff. The extra-inning affair was ended by Chris Jones' <b>two-run</b> <b>homer</b> {{in the top of}} the eighteenth inning. The Sounds advanced to their first American Association championship series, where they lost to the Omaha Royals, three games to two. Left-hander Chris Hammond won the league's Most Valuable Pitcher Award for 1990, having led the league with 15wins and 149strikeouts. That year, Nashville set their all-time attendance record when a total of 605,122fans came out to Greer Stadium. Skeeter Barnes, who played with Nashville in 1979 and from 1988 to 1990, holds three career franchise records: games played (514), at bats (1,848), and hits (517).|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Phillies claimed Jerome Williams off waivers and {{designated}} O'Sullivan for assignment, Williams {{started in the}} opener of a two-game series with the Angels in Los Angeles. Williams threw five shutout innings before giving up two runs in the sixth; Bastardo then gave up five more, and the Angels won 7–2. The Phillies also lost the second game, 4–3, as A. J. Burnett's inconsistency continued. The second (and final) series of the road trip pitted the Phillies against the San Francisco Giants. Hamels started game one, allowing a three-run homer in the fourth inning to give the Giants a 3–0 lead. The Phillies rallied, with a Marlon Byrd {{home run in the}} fifth inning and a <b>two-run</b> <b>homer</b> by Cody Asche to tie the game in the eighth. In the tenth, Chase Utley was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded (scoring one run) and Howard added a sacrifice fly to give the Phillies a 5–3 victory and Papelbon a save. In the second game, the Phillies jumped to a 5–1 lead before a sixth-inning infield error fueled a Giants rally. When Sandberg came out to remove Kendrick from the game, the pitcher stormed off the field in disgust; the Giants won, 6–5. The Phillies also lost the series' rubber match, 5–2; despite a quality start from Buchanan and Asche's three hits, the Giants had strong hitting by Michael Morse and Brandon Crawford.|$|E

50|$|Alan Trammell drilled {{a pair of}} <b>two-run</b> <b>homers</b> in {{the first}} and third innings to account for all of Detroit's offense as the Tigers beat Eric Show to take a three games-to-one lead in the Series. Jack Morris got his second Series victory in another complete-game effort, {{allowing}} two runs on Terry Kennedy's home run in the second and a wild pitch in the ninth to Kennedy that scored Steve Garvey, and five hits.|$|R
50|$|The Reds came {{charging}} back on superb pitching by Joey Jay to win Game 2 {{and even}} the series. Reds first baseman Gordy Coleman and Yankees' left-fielder Yogi Berra traded <b>two-run</b> <b>homers</b> in the fourth. Coleman hit his homer into the right-center field bleachers after Frank Robinson reached on an error by Yankees' third-baseman Clete Boyer.

5000|$|He {{then spent}} almost three full {{months on the}} Washington roster, working in 18 games, 17 of them in relief. Rippelmeyer won his only Major League game on June 1, 1962, against the Minnesota Twins, hurling two hitless innings and {{striking}} out one as Washington won in extra innings 4-3 on a home run by Chuck Hinton. One month later, on July 1, Rippelmeyer made his only start against the same team, but he lasted only 3 innings, surrendered two <b>two-run</b> <b>homers</b> (to Lenny Green and Bernie Allen), and left the game trailing, 4-0.

25|$|In game two, Zack Greinke {{shut out}} the Cardinals on two hits over seven innings, while {{striking}} out seven.
