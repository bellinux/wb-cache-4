Lloyd George's People's Budget had been rejected {{the previous year}} by the Conservative and Unionist-dominated House of Lords, contrary to the normal convention that the Lords did not veto money bills.

Edward had reluctantly agreed, provided the Lords rejected <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> after two successive general elections.

30|$|In practice, {{the design}} of <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> process among {{companies}} is not homogeneous (Shastri and Stout 2008). Companies can choose from {{a broad spectrum of}} design possibilities for <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> process. <b>The</b> two generic design possibilities, top-down and participative, represent the two ends of this spectrum. Lately, <b>the</b> participative <b>budgeting</b> process and <b>the</b> associated reporting behavior of managers has attracted considerable attention by experimental research (see Shields and Young 1993; Evans III et al. 2001; Fisher et al. 2002; Hannan et al. 2006; Matuszewski 2010; Rankin et al. 2008; Altenburger 2017). A significant part of this research has focused on the consequences of participation in <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> process and not its antecedents (a comprehensive literature review is provided by Shields and Shields 1998). However, the reasons for the use of participation in <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> process have often been neglected. This paper studies the role of participation in <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> process if company’s divisions are confronted with interdependence. In particular, the company’s preference for implementing a top-down or a participative budgeting process is examined.|$|R

He remained in contact with legislative leaders, sticking by the $35.8 billion budget he proposed late in the session, with minor changes. As the end of June approached, Koch urged the governor to call a session to pass a temporary 'lights-on' bill while a final deal was reached, but he refused to answer this proposal on the grounds that extending the budget's deadline would not serve the goal of reaching a final agreement.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} alternative ways of controlling costs that are more reliable, updated and useful than traditional <b>budgeting.</b> To identify <b>the</b> advantages and disadvantages of <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> process. To determine whether a South African company combines different planning methods to suit its specific planning needs. To determine how key performance drivers for planning purposes are chosen in the event that the company makes use of key performance drivers. Finally, to determine the relevance of traditional budgeting when combined with alternative planning methods for a South African company. This study should contribute greatly to how unique <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> process has become in the modern economy. Unlike previous studies that only focussed on abandoning budgets completely or on alternative methods, this study will investigate the use of <b>the</b> traditional <b>budget</b> in conjunction with alternative planning and the extent of alternative planning methods being used. As far as it could be determined, this will be the first study of the implementation of alternative budgeting in conjunction with <b>the</b> traditional <b>budget</b> in a South African context. The study will also make a unique contribution by investigating new combinations of planning techniques used by a South African company. For this mixed-method study, one single case was selected for an in-depth analysis of <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> process. Data was collected by means of questionnaires that were given to all participants of <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> process and a once off face-to-face in-depth interview with the CFO of the company. It was concluded that <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> process is unique for this South African company. It includes various alternative planning methods used in conjunction with <b>the</b> annual <b>budgeting</b> process. Disadvantages and advantages of <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> process were discussed as found form previous research and from the current study. Alternative methods of planning used by the company in conjunction to <b>the</b> traditional <b>budget</b> were identified and discussed. Further research in a South African context would prove very interesting on <b>the</b> unique <b>budgeting</b> processes implemented by South African companies today.
