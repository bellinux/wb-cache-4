5|$|Despite the {{strained}} {{relationship between}} Kennedy and Bush over No Child Left Behind spending, the two attempted {{to work together}} again on extending Medicare to cover prescription drug benefits. Kennedy's strategy was again doubted by other Democrats, but he saw the proposed $400billion program as an opportunity <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be missed. However, when the final formulation of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act contained provisions to steer seniors towards private plans, Kennedy switched to opposing it. It passed in late 2003, and led Kennedy to again say he had been betrayed by the Bush administration.|$|E
5|$|Many {{projects}} aim {{to prevent}} or slow this loss by revitalizing endangered languages and promoting education and literacy in minority languages. Across the world, many countries have enacted specific legislation to protect and stabilize the language of indigenous speech communities. A minority of linguists have argued that language loss is a natural process <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be counteracted, and that documenting endangered languages for posterity is sufficient.|$|E
5|$|The current {{reference}} range for acceptable blood lead concentrations in healthy persons without excessive exposure to environmental {{sources of lead}} is less than 5µg/dL for children. It was less than 25µg/dL for adults. Previous to 2012 the value for children was 10 (µg/dl). The current biological exposure index (a level <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be exceeded) for lead-exposed workers in the U.S. is 30µg/dL in a random blood specimen.|$|E

5000|$|While {{the ideal}} <b>that</b> race <b>should</b> <b>not</b> [...] "matter", critics say, is {{certainly}} not a bad thing, the problem lies in asserting <b>that</b> race <b>should</b> <b>not</b> {{be taken into consideration}} even when trying to address inequality or remedy past wrongs.|$|R
5|$|Some {{authors have}} dealt with {{comparative}} studies between Taoism and Christianity. This has been of interest for students of history of religion such as J.J.M. de Groot, among others. The comparison of the teachings of Laozi and Jesus of Nazareth {{has been done by}} several authors such as Martin Aronson, and Toropov & Hansen (2002), who believe that they have parallels <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be ignored. In the opinion of J. Isamu Yamamoto the main difference is that Christianity preaches a personal God while Taoism does not. Yet, a number of authors, including Lin Yutang, have argued that some moral and ethical tenets of these religions are similar.|$|E
5|$|Skeptics who {{identify}} {{issues with the}} traditionalist view point to possible anachronisms in The Art of War including terms, technology (such as anachronistic crossbows and the unmentioned cavalry), philosophical ideas, events, and military techniques <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> have been available to Sun Wu. Additionally, there are no records of professional generals during the Spring and Autumn period; these are only extant from the Warring States period, so there is doubt as to Sun Tzu's rank and generalship. This caused much confusion as to when The Art of War was actually written. The first traditional view {{is that it was}} written in 512 BC by the historical Sun Wu, active {{in the last years of}} the Spring and Autumn period (c. 722–481 BC). A second view, held by scholars such as Samuel Griffith, places The Art of War during the middle to late Warring States period (c. 481–221 BC). Finally, a third school claims that the slips were published in the last half of the 5th century BC; this is based on how its adherents interpret the bamboo slips discovered at Yin-ch’ueh-shan in 1972 AD.|$|E
25|$|Also pending is a 2006 {{lawsuit filed}} by the Humane Society of the United States against the New York Department of Agriculture and Markets, alleging that foie gras qualifies as an {{adulterated}} food <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be sold.|$|E

25|$|The {{character}} U+4039 (䀹) was a {{unification of}} two different characters (one with jiā 夾 phonetic and one with shǎn 㚒 phonetic) until Unicode 5.0. However, they were lexically different characters <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> have been unified; they have different pronunciations and different meanings.|$|E
25|$|Devices {{need to be}} {{installed}} in new premises and when repairs are carried out. Protection is required for power outlets and lighting, {{with the exception of}} emergency lighting <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be interrupted. The standard device used in South Africa is indeed a hybrid of ELPD and RCCB.|$|E
25|$|While {{working for}} the WWF, Peterson filmed several hours of behind-the-scenes footage with a video camera which he often carried. He often claimed that he would release a {{documentary}} called The Thing <b>that</b> <b>Should</b> <b>Not</b> Be or The Real Maxx Payne based on the footage, but never did. The footage reportedly contained scenes showing substance abuse and solicitation.|$|E
50|$|There is an {{argument}} <b>that</b> whales <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be killed because of their high intelligence. Pro-whalers claim that pigs also possess high intelligence, and are routinely butchered and eaten, and <b>that</b> intelligence <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be the determining factor of whether an animal is acceptable to eat or not.|$|R

25|$|Considering {{sexuality}} {{an important}} {{driving force in}} human life <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be excluded from the narrative, Martin equipped many of the Ice and Fire characters with a sex drive. Martin was also fascinated by medieval contrasts where knights venerated their ladies with poems and wore their favors in tournaments while their armies raped women in wartime.|$|E
25|$|Other American torah authorities, {{such as the}} Ungvarer Rav Rabbi Menashe Klein, Rabbi Moshe Heinemann of the Agudath Israel of Baltimore and the Star-K kashrus, the posek Rabbi Yehuda Henkin, Rabbi Chaim Brovender and Rabbi Ahron Soloveichik {{argue that}} {{while there may be}} sources for messianism, it is a shtut (foolishness) <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be followed.|$|E
25|$|Historic buildings, made of {{unreinforced}} masonry, {{may have}} culturally important interior detailing or murals <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be disturbed. In this case, the solution {{may be to}} add a number of steel, reinforced concrete, or poststressed concrete columns to the exterior. Careful attention must {{be paid to the}} connections with other members such as footings, top plates, and roof trusses.|$|E
50|$|The {{result of}} the fight was disputed by Márquez and his {{promoter}} Gary Shaw. They claimed <b>that</b> Márquez <b>should</b> <b>not</b> have been penalised a point in round ten and <b>that</b> Vázquez <b>should</b> <b>not</b> have been credited with a knockdown in the final round. Despite their protestations, the {{result of the}} fight stood.|$|R
2500|$|In March 2008, {{following}} {{unrest in}} Tibet, {{the speaker of}} the Samoan Fono (legislative assembly), Tolofuaivalelei Falemoe Leiataua, stated <b>that</b> foreign leaders <b>should</b> <b>not</b> interfere with China as it deals with [...] "internal affairs", and <b>that</b> they <b>should</b> <b>not</b> meet the Dalai Lama.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This review summarises several {{different}} lines of argument suggesting <b>that</b> one <b>should</b> <b>not</b> expect cuspy nonaxisymmetric galaxies {{to exist as}} robust, longlived collisionless equilibria, i. e., <b>that</b> such objects <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be idealised as timeindependent solutions to the collisionless Boltzmann equation...|$|R
25|$|When {{this process}} works, {{this type of}} {{neurosis}} may be considered a life-guiding gift from the unconscious, even though the personal journey forced upon the individual sometimes takes decades. This may seem absurd to someone looking at a neurosis from the attitude that it is always an illness <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> have to happen, expects the doctor to have a quick cure, and that fantasies are unreliable subjective experiences.|$|E
25|$|The Policy Block List (PBL) {{is similar}} to a Dialup Users List. The PBL lists not only dynamic IP {{addresses}} but also static addresses <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be sending email directly to third-party servers. Examples of such are an ISP's core routers, corporate users required by policy to send their email via company servers, and unassigned IP addresses. Much of the data is provided to Spamhaus by the organizations that control the IP address space, typically ISPs.|$|E
25|$|Svante E. Cornell {{argued that}} {{although}} Tagliavini’s report did claim that Georgia started the war, <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> {{be confused with}} the question of responsibility. He also criticised the argument that Georgia was legally bound by agreements not to use force, because the mission failed to discuss their validity if broken by either the South Ossetians or by Russia. Cornell also criticised the report for not taking account of the considerable evidence accumulated by scholars such as Andrey Illarionov.|$|E

25|$|Humility was an {{important}} principle. No traceur was allowed to feel superior over someone else, for example by executing a movement only to show {{off in front of}} someone who could not perform the movement. If any traceur in the group claimed that he had completed a difficult and dangerous challenge <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be attempted unaided, he had to prove his claims by doing the challenge again. Anyone who lied violated the principle of humility.|$|E
25|$|Most simply, given {{a list of}} polyominoes {{of order}} n, squares may be added next to each polyomino in each {{possible}} position, and the resulting polyomino of order n+1 {{added to the list}} if not a duplicate of one already found; refinements in ordering the enumeration and marking adjacent squares <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be considered reduce the number of cases that need to be checked for duplicates. This method may be used to enumerate either free or fixed polyominoes.|$|E
25|$|Some {{religious}} groups argue that having the government decide whether a same-sex marriage should be legally binding {{on the grounds}} of the ideology of other {{religious groups}} restricts their religious freedom. They argue that marriage is a religious term <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be defined by the government. Where same-sex marriage is recognized in the United States, no church or other religious institution is forced to perform same-sex marriages, but the FMA would deny the opportunity for religions which approve of same-sex marriage to perform legally binding same-sex marriages.|$|E
