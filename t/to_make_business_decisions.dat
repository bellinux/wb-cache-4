30|$|Results of {{the second}} {{hypothesis}} showed that entrepreneurial mentoring did not predict ambiguity tolerance; and age {{did not have any}} moderating role in the model. While some studies (Antonites & Wordsworth, 2009; Nieuwenhuizen and Kroon, 2002) have suggested that individuals could be mentored in managing ambiguities in business, it is quite instinctive for individuals to avoid taking uncalculated risks. Even seasoned entrepreneurs often exhaust possible alternatives and extrapolations before taking uncalculated risks in business. Thus, this natural instinct may deflect the potency of any form of entrepreneurial mentoring directed at enhancing tolerance for ambiguities in business. However, it has established that being able <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>business</b> <b>decisions</b> in relatively unfamiliar market situations may be fostered by knowledge and experience garnered from formal and informal mentoring relationship (Holm et al., 2013). An experienced entrepreneur is therefore in a position to offer mentoring support on issues of business uncertainties based on personal experiences.|$|E

The authors describe a current application of this approach whereby continual simulation play across semesters affords each team a unique starting point and generates a rich history base. Teams are required to learn and use Lotus 1 - 2 - 3 as a custom-made DSS to analyze the history file and develop their marketing strategy. This approach affords the benefits of realism, relevance, computer literacy, flexibility, and opportunity for refinement. Suggestions for future simulation enhancements include providing teams with the ability to decide when to make decisions and the addition of an expert system as a strategic advisor...|$|E
40|$|How {{dangerous}} is Chinese outward {{foreign direct}} investment (OFDI) because of the state's influence over business, particularly state-owned enterprises (SOEs) ? To what extent are business and politics interwoven in Chinese investment decisions? Crucial knowledge is lacking on the relationship between the state and companies in China's OFDI. This study does not claim to completely refute the conventional view that Chinese companies, particularly SOEs, are controlled by the state in their OFDI activities. However, it tries to provide some evidence that suggests the need for a revised look at them. It argues that although Chinese SOEs are supported by Chinese diplomacy and loans in their OFDI and have a tacit understanding of certain strategic goals of the state, they enjoy autonomy <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>business</b> <b>decisions</b> and have prioritized maximizing their own business interests. Importantly, this is enabled by the state's view that the profit of SOEs is consistent with national interests...|$|E
