When I tell him that you are a patient of mine, and that I should be obliged if he would find you some quiet lodging at Honfleur, where you can remain till your arm is better and you are fit to be about again, I have no doubt he will manage it. He is a good fellow, and I shall let him understand that you don't want inquiries made about you.|$|E
60|$|They had now {{reached the}} river. The sun was just showing above the horizon, and the broad {{sheet of water}} was already astir. Steamers were making their way up {{from the mouth of}} the river, laden with stores for the army. Little tugs were hurrying to and fro. Vessels that had {{discharged}} their cargo were dropping down with the tide, while many sailing vessels lay at anchor, waiting for the <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>tide</b> to make their way higher up. Norfolk was, however, the base from which the Federal army drew the larger portion of its stores; as there were great conveniences for landing here, and a railway thence ran up to the rear of their lines. But temporary wharves and stages had been erected at the point of the river nearest to their camps in front of Petersburg, and here the cattle and much of the stores required for the army were landed. At the point at which Vincent and Tony had struck the river the banks were somewhat low. Here and there were snug farms, with the ground cultivated down to the river. The whole country was open and free from trees, except where small patches had been left. It was in front of one of these that Vincent and Tony were now standing.|$|E

6000|$|The Bonzas perceiving {{that the}} people {{preferred}} the authority of Xavier above theirs, and {{not knowing how to}} refute their adversary, made a cabal at court, to lessen the Christians in the good opinion of the king. They gave him jealousies of them, by decrying their behaviour, and saying, [...] "They were men of intrigue, plotters, enemies of the public safety, and dangerous to the person of the king;" [...] insomuch, that Oxindono, who had been so favourable to them, all on the sudden was turned against them. It is true, that as the Japonese value themselves above all things, in the inviolable observation of their word, when they have once engaged it, he durst not revoke that solemn edict, which he had published in favour of the Christians; but to make it of no effect, he used the faithful with great severity, even so far as to seize upon their goods, and began with men of the first rank in his dominions. At the same time, the Bonzas, grown insolent, and swelled with this new <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>tide,</b> wrote letters and libels full of invectives against Xavier. They said, he was a vagabond beggar, who, not knowing how to maintain himself in India, was come to Japan to live on charity. They endeavoured above all things to make him pass for a notorious magician, who, through the power of his charms, had forced the devil to obey him, and one who, by the assistance of his familiars, performed all sorts of prodigies to seduce the people.|$|E
6000|$|... § 19. Before {{the idea}} of {{landscape}} had been thus far developed, the representations of it had been purely typical; the objects {{which had to be}} shown in order to explain the scene of the event, being firmly outlined, usually on a pure golden or chequered color background, not on sky. The change from the golden background, (characteristic of the finest thirteenth century work) and the colored chequer (which in like manner belongs to the finest fourteenth) to the blue sky, gradated to the horizon, takes place early in the fifteenth century, and is the crisis of change in the spirit of mediæval art. Strictly speaking, we might divide the art of Christian times into two great masses--Symbolic and Imitative;--the symbolic, reaching from the earliest periods down to the close of the fourteenth century, and the imitative from that close to the present time; and, then, the most important circumstance indicative of the culminating point, or <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>tide,</b> would be this of the change from chequered background to sky background. The uppermost figure in Plate 7. opposite, representing the tree of knowledge, taken from a somewhat late thirteenth century Hebrew manuscript (Additional 11,639) in the British Museum, will at once illustrate Mr. Macaulay's [...] "serpent turned round the tree," [...] and the mode of introducing the chequer background, will enable the reader better to understand the peculiar feeling of the period, which no more intended the formal walls or streams for an imitative representation of the Garden of Eden, than these chequers for an imitation of sky.|$|E
60|$|And in {{this same}} amazing calm Miltoun {{remained}} after he had gone away, till about half-past nine in the evening, he started forth, to {{walk down to the}} House. It was now that sort of warm, clear night, which in the country has firefly magic, and even over the Town spreads a dark glamour. And for Miltoun, in the delight of his new health and well-being, with every sense alive and clean, to walk through the warmth and beauty of this night was sheer pleasure. He passed by way of St. James's Park, treading down the purple shadows of plane-tree leaves into the pools of lamplight, almost with remorse--so beautiful, and as if alive, were they. There were moths abroad, and gnats, born on the water, and scent of new-mown grass drifted up from the lawns. His heart felt light as a swallow he had seen that morning; swooping at a grey feather, carrying it along, letting it flutter away, then diving to seize it again. Such was his elation, this beautiful night! Nearing the House of Commons, he thought he would walk a little longer, and turned westward to the river: On that warm evening the water, without movement at <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>tide,</b> was like the black, snake-smooth hair of Nature streaming out on her couch of Earth, waiting for the caress of a divine hand. Far away on the further; bank throbbed some huge machine, not stilled as yet. A few stars were out in the dark sky, but no moon to invest with pallor the gleam of the lamps. Scarcely anyone passed. Miltoun strolled along the river wall, then crossed, and came back in front of the Mansions where she lived. By the railing he stood still. In the sitting-room of her little flat there was no light, but the casement window was wide open, and the crown of white flowers in the bowl on the window-sill still gleamed out in the darkness like a crescent moon lying on its face. Suddenly, he saw two pale hands rise--one on either side of that bowl, lift it, and draw it in. And he quivered, as though they had touched him. Again those two hands came floating up; they were parted now by darkness; the moon of flowers was gone, in its place had been set handfuls of purple or crimson blossoms. And a puff of warm air rising quickly out of the night drifted their scent of cloves into his face, so that he held his breath for fear of calling out her name.|$|E

50|$|On {{the night}} of Caleb’s eighteenth birthday, he leaves to face Chase alone, and has Reid and Tyler {{safeguard}} Sarah in public. However, Chase easily kidnaps Sarah. At an old barn, the two confront each other. Chase reveals a spellbound Sarah and gives Caleb an ultimatum of his life for hers. Caleb declares he won’t will his power away or let Sarah come to harm. They duel and Caleb is clearly outmatched. At the exact minute of his birth, he ascends, and his power fully matures, which allows him to mount an offensive. However, as Chase {{has more than one}} magical share, he still proves superior and the temporary <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>tide</b> does not last long. Back at home, Evelyn, Caleb's mother, begs her husband save Caleb. He sacrifices himself and transfer power remotely to his son. Once his father’s power is infused within him, Caleb hits Chase with a final blow that engulfs him in a ball of flame. Sarah, Kate, and Pogue awaken, freed from their curses.|$|E
