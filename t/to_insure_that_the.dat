5|$|A concern {{from people}} living along the tunnel {{was that they}} would be subject to low-frequency noise. Originally the {{municipalities}} of Asker and Bærum had demanded that residents be subject to a maximum of 27 decibel A-weighting (dBA), but the National Rail Administration appealed the requirements and was permitted to allow up to 32 dBA. In March 2004, a test was done in the tunnel <b>to</b> <b>insure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> requirements would be met, as low-frequency sound is difficult to predict. Measurements after the opening of the tunnel showed background noise of 30 dBA, that no-one was subject to 32 dBA or higher, and that it was nearly impossible to measure the passing of trains.|$|E
5|$|To {{minimize}} Soviet opposition, Norway {{attempted to}} move the debate from the political to the specialist scene, {{while at the same}} time establishing a protocol for Norwegian control and operation of the facility. To achieve this, Norwegian authorities worked towards establishing an inspection procedure <b>to</b> <b>insure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> facilities remained solely used for 'peaceful activities'. This would particularly focus on the regular inspection of auxiliary equipment. To depoliticize the issue further, the government appointed the semi-independent NTNF as the operator of the facility. The first oral consultations between the Soviet embassy and the Norwegian government took place in November 1964.|$|E

A small colonial force from Virginia began a fort here but a French force under Claude-Pierre Pécaudy de Contrecœur drove them off in April 1754.

40|$|For {{the past}} seven years the authors have, in {{partnership}} with communities throughout the state of Ohio in the U. S. A., designed and implemented long range urban planning initiatives based on principles of sustainability, linking the social, economic and environmental sectors of community. These programs have all involved inclusionary processes for visioning, goal setting, and long-range plan development in the creation of resident-initiated and supported sustainability goals. For sustainability to be pursued, we have found that a balance among these complex and often competing social, economic and environmental interests in each urban area must be achieved and effective tools must be used to assure that goals remain in balance through continual monitoring and assessment. The assessment technique used is the development of multidimensional indicators which measure how close the community is to reaching its goals and that they remain in balance. We have formulated an approach to the establishment of multi-dimensional indicators that involves both residents and professionals in their development and on-going monitoring. Such stakeholder involvement helps <b>to</b> <b>insures</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> indicators will be relevant, politically supportable, usable and that they matter to the community. These qualities maximize their legitimacy in the eyes of local leaders and increase the likelihood of their usage in community decision-making processes.
