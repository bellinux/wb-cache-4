25|$|Note {{that these}} passivized {{sentences}} get progressively more ungrammatical in English {{as they move}} down the accessibility hierarchy; the last two, in particular, are so ungrammatical as to be almost unparsable by English speakers.

25|$|Based on {{the fact}} that writing {{sentences}} and reading them are coordinated using and, one can conclude that they are constituents. The validity of the coordination test is challenged by additional data, however. The latter <b>two</b> <b>sentences,</b> which are instances of so-called right node raising, suggest that the sequences in bold should be understood as constituents. Most grammars do not view sequences such as He enjoys to the exclusion of the VP writing sentences as a constituent. Thus while the coordination test is widely employed as a diagnostic for constituent structure, it is faced with major difficulties and is therefore perhaps the least reliable of all the tests mentioned.|$|E

25|$|In retrospect, Ellsworth's role {{in helping}} to {{establish}} the United States as a viable sovereign nation was important but could be easily overlooked. A {{good part of the}} reason for this was that he did not distinguish himself as an orator but worked as much as possible behind the scenes. He was said to have been dominant in his eloquence at the January 1788, Connecticut Ratifying Convention, but later as the de facto Senate majority leader he seems to have kept his arguments relatively short and to the point. His written prose could on occasion be tortuous, as best illustrated by the operative sentence in Section 25 of the Judiciary Act (the first of only <b>two</b> <b>sentences).</b> Over three hundred words long, this sentence is almost impossible to decipher as an explanation how state courts were answerable to federal authority. But perhaps this opacity was intentional, since the expansion of federal power specified by Section 25 was mostly overlooked in debate both in the Senate and House of Representatives despite having been the most important and potentially controversial portion of the Judiciary Act.|$|E
25|$|On tests between November 1971 and May 1972 Curtiss {{determined}} that Genie viewed non-specific adjectives describing size, such {{as little as}} absolute rather than relative values without superlative or comparative markers. Between January and May 1972 her comprehension of noun-modifier sentences significantly increased and starting in May 1972, after Curtiss replaced the word little with tiny, Genie showed clear comprehension of them. Genie clearly understood both the word more and the suffix -er as comparatives by January 1972, but never used them in her own speech. Prior to 1972 Genie responded to the conjunctions and and or as if they both meant and, but even after recognizing {{there was a difference}} never fully grasped the meaning of or. On tests she showed perfect comprehension of and while correctly responding to the word or fewer than 10% of the time, but she always understood disjunction marked by the word or in everyday conversation. She never attempted to use any other conjunctions, and with one possible highly ungrammatical exception never tried to connect <b>two</b> <b>sentences.</b>|$|E
25|$|Evidence in debates is {{organized}} into units called cards (because such evidence was originally printed on note cards, though the practice {{has long been}} out of favor). Cards are designed to condense an author's argument so that debaters have {{an easy way to}} access the information. A card is composed of three parts: the tag, the cite, and the body. The tag is the debater's summary of the argument presented in the body. A tag is usually only one or <b>two</b> <b>sentences.</b> The cite contains all relevant citation information (that is, the author, date of publication, journal, title, etc.). Although every card should contain a complete citation, only the author's name and date of publication are typically spoken aloud in a speech. Some teams will also read the author's qualifications if they wish to emphasize this information. The body is a fragment of the author's original text. The length of a body can vary greatly—cards can be as short as a few sentences and as long as two or more pages. Most cards are between one and five paragraphs in length. The body of a card is often underlined or highlighted in order to eliminate unnecessary or redundant sentences when the card is read in a round. In a round, the tag is read first, followed by the cite and the body.|$|E

The psychological basis of sentencing goals was traced by testing a model that relates the <b>two</b> dimensions of <b>sentencing</b> goals and of their consequent punitiveness to values and social axioms. Results indicated that the <b>two</b> <b>sentencing</b> goals were associated with certain dimensions of values and axioms, enabling us to establish a model with sentencing goals as mediators between values, axioms and punitiveness. This model extended current research on sentencing goals and can be applied in the legal context to evaluate the court's penal practice. Department of Applied Social Science...|$|R
