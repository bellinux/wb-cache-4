5|$|Attribution {{is often}} {{difficult}} with Farsari's photographs because 19th-century photographers frequently acquired each others' images and sold them under their own names. This {{may be due to}} <b>the</b> <b>commonplace</b> exchange of stock and negatives between various commercial photographers, or due to the number of freelance amateurs who sold their work to more than one studio. Thus a photograph identified as by Farsari might actually be by Beato, Stillfried & Andersen or Kusakabe. A case in point is the photograph of an Officer's Daughter, variously attributed to Farsari, Stillfried, Kusakabe or even Suzuki Shin'ichi.|$|E
5|$|The prologue to {{the novel}} is Carpentier’s most often quoted text, in which he coins the term lo real maravilloso ("marvellous reality") in {{reference}} to seemingly miraculous occurrences in Latin America. This is contrasted {{with the lack of}} magic and imagination in European folklore. Furthermore, his trip to Haiti in 1943 is recounted, {{as well as some of}} the research he did to gather facts for the novel. Carpentier also denounces <b>the</b> <b>commonplace</b> and formulaic instances of the marvellous that is found in surrealist novels due to its inorganic and false origins, as opposed to the natural magic that is found in Latin America.|$|E

500|$|Disraeli {{was born}} on 21 December 1804 at 6 King's Road, Bedford Row, Bloomsbury, London, the second child and eldest son of Isaac D'Israeli, a {{literary}} critic and historian, and Maria (Miriam), née Basevi. The family was of Sephardic Jewish Italian mercantile background. All Disraeli's grandparents and great-grandparents were born in Italy; Isaac's father, Benjamin, moved to England from Venice in 1748. Disraeli later romanticised his origins, claiming that his father's family was of grand Spanish and Venetian descent; in fact Isaac's family was of no great distinction, but on Disraeli's mother's side, in which he took no interest, there were some distinguished forebears. Historians differ on Disraeli's motives for rewriting his family history: Bernard Glassman argues that {{it was intended to}} give him status comparable to that of England's ruling elite; Sarah Bradford believes [...] "his dislike of <b>the</b> <b>commonplace</b> would not allow him to accept the facts of his birth as being as middle-class and undramatic as they really were".|$|E

500|$|Elgar was knighted at Buckingham Palace on 5 July 1904. The {{following}} month, he and {{his family}} moved to Plâs Gwyn, a large house on the outskirts of Hereford, overlooking the River Wye, where they lived until 1911. Between 1902 and 1914, Elgar was, in Kennedy's words, at the zenith of popularity. He made four visits to the US, including one conducting tour, and earned considerable fees from the performance of his music. Between 1905 and 1908, he held the post of Peyton Professor of Music at the University of Birmingham. He had accepted the post reluctantly, feeling that a composer should not head a school of music. He was not at ease in the role, and his lectures caused controversy, with his attacks on the critics and on English music in general: [...] "Vulgarity in the course of time may be refined. Vulgarity often goes with inventiveness ... but <b>the</b> <b>commonplace</b> mind can never be anything but commonplace. An Englishman will take you into a large room, beautifully proportioned, and will point out to you that it is white – all over white – and somebody will say, 'What exquisite taste'. You know in your own mind, in your own soul, that it is not taste at all, that it is the want of taste, that is mere evasion. English music is white, and evades everything." [...] He regretted the controversy and was glad to hand on the post to his friend Granville Bantock in 1908. His new life as a celebrity was a mixed blessing to the highly strung Elgar, as it interrupted his privacy, and he often was in ill-health. He complained to Jaeger in 1903, [...] "My life is one continual giving up of little things which I love." [...] Both W. S. Gilbert and Thomas Hardy sought to collaborate with Elgar in this decade. Elgar refused, but would have collaborated with George Bernard Shaw had Shaw been willing.|$|E
500|$|Wulfstan's best-known homily is Sermo Lupi ad Anglos, or Sermon of the Wolf to the English. [...] In it he proclaims the depredations of the [...] "Danes" [...] (who were, at that point, {{primarily}} Norwegian invaders) a scourge from God to lash the English {{for their}} sins. [...] He calls upon them to repent of their sinful ways and [...] "return {{to the faith}} of baptism, where there is protection from the fires of hell." [...] He also wrote many homilies relating to the Last Days and {{the coming of the}} Antichrist. Age of the Antichrist was a popular theme in Wulfstan's homilies, which also include the issues of death and Judgment Day. Six homilies that illustrate this theme include: Secundum Matheum, Secundum Lucam, De Anticristo, De Temporibus Antichrist, Secundum Marcum and [...] "De Falsis Deis". De Antichristo was the [...] "first full development of the Antichrist theme", and Wulfstan addressed it to the clergy. Believing that he lived at the time right before the Antichrist was to come, he felt compelled to diligently warn and teach the clergy to withstand the dishonest teaching of the enemies of God. These six homilies also include: emphasis that the hour of the Antichrist is very near, warnings that the English should be aware of false Christs who will attempt to seduce men, warnings that God will pass judgement on man's faithfulness, discussion of man's sins, evils of the world, and encouragement to love God and do his will. He wrote the Canons of Edgar and The Law of Edward and Guthrum which date before 1008. The Canons was written to instruct the secular clergy serving a parish in the responsibilities of their position. The Law of Edward and Guthrum, on the other hand, is an ecclesiastical law handbook. [...] Modern editors have paid most attention to his homilies: they have been edited by Arthur Napier, by Dorothy Whitelock, and by Dorothy Bethurum. Since that publication, other works that were likely authored by Wulfstan have been identified; a forthcoming edition by Andy Orchard will update the canon of Wulfstan's homilies. Wulfstan was also a book collector; he is responsible for amassing a large collection of texts pertaining to canon law, the liturgy, and episcopal functions. This collection is known as Wulftan's Commonplace Book. A significant part of <b>the</b> <b>Commonplace</b> book consists of a work once known as the Excerptiones pseudo-Ecgberhti, though it has most recently been edited as Wulfstan's Canon Law Collection (a.k.a. Collectio canonum Wigorniensis). This work is a collection of conciliar decrees and church canons, most of which he culled from numerous ninth and tenth-century Carolingian works. This work demonstrates the wide range of Wulfstan's reading and studies. He sometimes borrowed from this collection when he wrote his later works, especially the law codes of Æthelred. There are also a number of works which are associated with the archbishop, but whose authorship is unknown, such as the Late Old English Handbook for the Use of a Confessor.|$|E

40|$|UnrestrictedRalph Tyler (1949) {{conceived}} the composing of curriculum {{as an act}} of orderly decision-making. He provided a framework that identified the decisions (couched as questions) required for effective curriculum composition. These decisions addressed <b>the</b> four <b>commonplaces</b> of curriculum: goals, learning experiences, organization, and evaluation. It is recognized that curriculum differs according to the emphasis given to each commonplace.; Goodlad's (1966, 1979, 1984) five domains of curriculum (ideal, formal, perceived, operational, and experienced) made possible the comparison of curriculum commonplaces between each of the domains. This comparison afforded curriculum inquiry into the phenomenon slippage, defined by Goodlad as an inconsistency of ideas between curriculum domains. This study revealed inconsistencies underlying <b>the</b> <b>commonplaces</b> of two domains (ideal and formal) contained in contemporary curricula.; The study's first research question (What are <b>the</b> <b>commonplaces</b> noted curriculum theorists share with Tyler’s Rationale for curriculum development?) concerned the construction of a data coding instrument. The study's second research question (How do contemporary models of district-adopted curricula reflect <b>the</b> <b>commonplaces</b> identified by Tyler and other curriculum theorists?) concerned the analysis of three formal contemporary curricula.; A literature review of noted curricular theorists (Applebee, Brandwein, Bruner, Egan, Eisner, Glatthorn, Goodlad, McTighe, Taba, Tomlinson, and Wiggins) identified commonplaces of ideal curriculum. A document review compared commonplaces of ideal curriculum to contemporary curricula using a two-dimensional coding chart. Results showed some consistency and some inconsistency between the ideas of noted curriculum theorists and their practice in contemporary formal curriculum.; This study's findings suggested four conclusions. First, its findings affirmed the seminal nature and abiding relevance of Tyler's Rationale for curriculum development and design. Second, curriculum commonplaces and criteria held to be important by noted curriculum theorists were identified. Third, the slippage discovered confirmed Goodlad's conception of curriculum domains. Fourth, the study developed a way to analyze slippage between the two domains of ideal curricula of noted curriculum theorists and contemporary formal curricula...|$|R
