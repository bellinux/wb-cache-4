500|$|The {{inclusion}} of procedural content tools {{allowed for the}} creation of realistic environments at much faster rates than was the case with Morrowind. Using Interactive Data Visualization, Inc. (IDV)'s SpeedTree technology, for example, Bethesda artists were able to [...] "quickly generate complex and organic tree shapes with relative ease". With its [...] "parent/child hierarchies and iterative branch levels [...] highly modifiable cylinder primitives", Bethesda's Noah Berry attests that [...] "an entire <b>tree</b> <b>shape</b> can be created in a manner of minutes, just by adjusting numerical values and tweaking spline curve handles". Instead of Morrowinds artificially smoothed-over terrain, erosion algorithms incorporated in the landscape generation tools allowed {{for the creation of}} [...] "craggy mountain vistas" [...] quickly and easily.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the trees}} are in the ground, work on the crop continues. Animal pests (especially insects) and {{diseases}} must be monitored and controlled, and weed growth must also be minimized. Many species of pine and fir require pruning and shearing {{two to four years}} after planting to maintain the classic Christmas <b>tree</b> <b>shape.</b> Late or omitted pruning can result in trees that are unmarketable due to large gaps in needle coverage. Some species of pine, such as the Scots pine, are susceptible to dormant season [...] "yellowing", which is generally countered with a green dye or paint.|$|E
2500|$|Both rooted and unrooted phylogenetic trees can {{be either}} bifurcating or multifurcating, and either labeled or unlabeled. A rooted bifurcating tree has exactly two {{descendants}} arising from each interior node (that is, it forms a binary tree), and an unrooted bifurcating tree {{takes the form of}} an unrooted binary tree, a free tree with exactly three neighbors at each internal node. In contrast, a rooted multifurcating tree may have more than two children at some nodes and an unrooted multifurcating tree may have more than three neighbors at some nodes. A labeled tree has specific values assigned to its leaves, while an unlabeled tree, sometimes called a <b>tree</b> <b>shape,</b> defines a topology only. The number of possible trees for a given number of leaf nodes depends on the specific type of tree, but there are always more multifurcating than bifurcating trees, more labeled than unlabeled trees, and more rooted than unrooted trees. The last distinction is the most biologically relevant; it arises because there are many places on an unrooted tree to put the root. For labeled bifurcating trees, there are: ...|$|E

40|$|We solve a {{class of}} {{optimization}} problems for (phylogenetic) $X$-trees or their shapes.

In this work we generalize the concept and also present several applications. Moreover, our results give rise to a nice notion of balance for trees.

Several extreme red-black <b>tree</b> <b>shapes</b> are characterized: <b>trees</b> of minimum and maximum height, trees with a minimal and with a maximal proportion of red nodes. These characterizations are obtained by relating <b>tree</b> <b>shapes</b> to various number systems.

50|$|Some {{mathematical}} rule-patterns can be visualised, {{and among}} these are those that explain patterns in nature including the mathematics of symmetry, waves, meanders, and fractals. Fractals are mathematical patterns that are scale invariant. This means that {{the shape of the}} pattern does not depend on how closely you look at it. Self-similarity is found in fractals. Examples of natural fractals are coast lines and <b>tree</b> <b>shapes,</b> which repeat their shape regardless of what magnification you view at. While self-similar patterns can appear indefinitely complex, the rules needed to describe or produce their formation can be simple (e.g. Lindenmayer systems describing <b>tree</b> <b>shapes).</b>|$|R

50|$|Primary {{consideration}} in the selection and use of trademarks {{should be given to}} marks which are inherently distinctive, as they possess the strongest distinctive character and do not require evidence of use to establish acquired distinctiveness. A fanciful, arbitrary, or suggestive term can be inherently distinctive and registrable without proof of acquired distinctiveness.Although these categories are most easily applied in relation to trademarks comprising words, the same general principles are applied in relation to all kinds of trademarks. For example, a pine <b>tree</b> <b>shape</b> is descriptive when used on pine-scented products.|$|E
