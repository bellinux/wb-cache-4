Still in place from the Nixon Administration was the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT). The thawing relationship brought about by Nixon's visit to China was reinforced by Ford's December 1975 visit to that communist country. In 1975, the Administration entered into the Helsinki Accords with the Soviet Union, creating {{the framework of the}} Helsinki Watch, an independent non-governmental organization created <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> <b>compliance</b> that later evolved into Human Rights Watch.|$|E

25|$|Tuvaluans {{are well}} known for their {{seafaring}} skills, with the Tuvalu Maritime Training Institute on Amatuku motu (island), Funafuti, providing training to approximately 120 marine cadets each year so {{that they have the}} skills necessary for employment as seafarers on merchant shipping. The Tuvalu Overseas Seamen's Union (TOSU) is the only registered trade union in Tuvalu. It represents workers on foreign ships. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates that 800 Tuvaluan men are trained, certified and active as seafarers. The ADB estimates that, at any one time, about 15% of the adult male population works abroad as seafarers. Job opportunities also exist as observers on tuna boats where the role is <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> <b>compliance</b> with the boat's tuna fishing licence.|$|E
25|$|Patients with MDR-TB {{should be}} {{isolated}} in negative-pressure rooms, if possible. Patients with MDR-TB {{should not be}} accommodated on the same ward as immunosuppressed patients (HIV infected patients, or patients on immunosuppressive drugs). Careful monitoring of compliance with treatment {{is crucial to the}} management of MDR-TB (and some physicians insist on hospitalisation if only for this reason). Some physicians will insist that these patients are isolated until their sputum is smear negative, or even culture negative (which may take many months, or even years). Keeping these patients in hospital for weeks (or months) on end may be a practical or physical impossibility and the final decision depends on the clinical judgement of the physician treating that patient. The attending physician should make full use of therapeutic drug monitoring (particularly of the aminoglycosides) both <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> <b>compliance</b> and to avoid toxic effects.|$|E
500|$|On September 25, 1991, at the {{beginning}} of the Yugoslav wars, the United Nations Security Council issued Resolution 713, which established [...] "a general and complete embargo on all deliveries of weapons and military equipment to Yugoslavia", with the goal of reducing violence and bloodshed throughout the country. [...] In May, the Security Council reaffirmed the embargo in Resolution 757, and added a provision for a naval force <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> <b>compliance</b> with the embargo. [...] In resolution 757, the Council also called on states to [...] "deny permission to any aircraft to take off, land in or overfly their territory if it is destined to land in or had taken off from the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia", setting the precedent for later anti-air measures.|$|E

2500|$|The Italic League {{played an}} {{essential}} part {{in the balance of}} power subsequently pursued by the Florentine ruler Lorenzo de' Medici (1449–92); its only cracks were the Pazzi conspiracy, the Barons Conspiracy and the Salt War. The League provided enough stability to allow the peninsular economy to recover from the population loss and economic depression caused by the Black Death and its aftermath, leading to an economic expansion that endured until {{the first part of the}} 17th century. The League also enabled the creation of the first permanent embassies amongst the states of the Italian peninsula, in order <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> <b>compliance</b> with the terms prohibiting supporting exiled dissidents, with De Officio Legati — what seems to be the first treatise on ambassadorship — written by Ermolao Barbaro in Venice in 1490, after he had served the [...] in Burgundy and Milan.|$|E

2500|$|At the time, {{the only}} way <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> <b>compliance</b> was by having whaling [...] "inspectors" [...] on the factory ships {{themselves}} to record the species and size of whales caught. When the International Whaling Commission (IWC) was established in 1946, monitoring of compliance with and enforcement of the IWC's regulations was the responsibility of each member nation with respect to its nationals' whaling operations. Each nation employed its own whaling inspectors at whaling stations and aboard whaling factory ships. Each member nation of the IWC was required {{to report to the}} IWC annually on compliance, describing the specifics of any infractions (e.g. number of illegal whales caught of which species), and what actions the member nation had taken regarding these infractions. The IWC itself has no legal authority to monitor whaling operations or impose sanctions on whaling operations for infractions. This policing of the whaling fleets by their own governments persisted until 1972 when the IWC established a system of international observers on whaling ships.|$|E
