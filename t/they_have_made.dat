5|$|The {{resistance}} is given intelligence by an unidentified informant from the Cylon command structure, {{by use of}} a secret dead drop; flipping a dog bowl and hiding some documents inside the tent next to it. One piece of intelligence given is information on a Cylon communications blocker; the resistance makes use of that information to contact a Raptor orbiting the planet. The Raptor returns to Galactica with news <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> contact with the resistance on the planet.|$|E
5|$|Lord Wardens {{since the}} Second World War have {{included}} Winston Churchill, Robert Menzies and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, but <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> only intermittent use of Walmer Castle. In the 21st century, Walmer Castle is {{run as a}} tourist attraction by English Heritage. The interior of the castle displays a range of historical objects and pictures associated with the property and its Lord Wardens, protected since the 19th century by special legislation. The grounds include the Queen Mother's Garden, designed by Penelope Hobhouse as a 95th birthday gift for Elizabeth in 1997.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the spring}} of 150 BC, Galba again went to war against the Lusitanians. They soon sent an {{emissary}} to Galba, declaring <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> a mistake of making war against Roman subjects, and requested {{to return to a}} treaty <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> with Atiliusand.|$|R
60|$|Quite {{an exodus}} {{took place in}} Dawson in the spring. Men, because <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> stakes, and other men, because <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> none, bought up the {{available}} dogs and rushed out for Dyea over the last ice. Incidentally, {{it was discovered that}} Dave Harney possessed most of these dogs.|$|R
30|$|The hypercorrection {{results from}} the first two {{experiments}} were further clarified and bolstered by Experiment 3. Participants hypercorrected when <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> an error and were given corrective feedback, but did not hyper'correct' when <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been correct and were given false feedback. When <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been right, it seems plausible that <b>they</b> may <b>have</b> had some knowledge that the feedback they were given was wrong (when it was). Interestingly, though, they also hyper'corrected' when <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> an error in Phase 1 and they were given false feedback following their error. Participants {{did not appear to}} be able to recognize misinformation and exclude it from being encoded when <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> an error.|$|R
5|$|The Red Wings {{returned}} to the playoffs in 1984 where they suffered a first round defeat to the St. Louis Blues. In the 32 seasons since then <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> the playoffs 30 times, including 25 consecutive seasons from 1991 to 2016. They {{returned to}} the Finals {{for the first time}} since 1966 in 1995 where they were swept by the New Jersey Devils in four games. However, in 1997 they made it back to the Finals, winning the series in four straight games over the Philadelphia Flyers. They repeated as champions in the following season with a four-game sweep of the Washington Capitals. Their most recent championships were in 2002 and 2008, with their most recent Finals appearance in 2009 where they lost to the Pittsburgh Penguins.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{dominance}} among ants, {{a number}} of animals are known to prey on meat ants. The short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) is a prominent predator of the meat ant, mostly due to the high fat levels (up to 47%) in virgin queens. These queens can almost contain 47% fat, and when no queens are available after an attack, an echidna may stop attacking the nest. However, these ants are normally consumed either in low numbers or avoided entirely. Attacking echidnas burrow down into the hole <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> and consume them while handling the bites from the ants, as they frequently scratch themselves {{on the head and}} chest. The echidna does not consume meat ants throughout the whole year; instead, echidnas only attack meat ant nests from August to October, which is when nuptial flight (meaning that virgin queens and males emerge to mate) occurs. This time period makes it much easier for echidnas to prey on the winged females since they are directly above on the nest. Despite attacks, colony growth is not affected by echidnas.|$|E
5|$|The 2006 {{video game}} , {{developed}} by Insomniac Games, published by Sony Computer Entertainment and released for the PlayStation 3 video game console, features combat scenes {{that take place}} within a virtual representation of Manchester Cathedral in England set in an alternate history. It was released on 23 March 2007 in the United Kingdom. The use of images of the cathedral caused controversy {{with the leaders of}} the Church of England, which claimed its depiction to be desecration and copyright infringement, and that it was inappropriate of Sony to allow players to fire guns in a city with a gun problem. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> several legal threats against Sony. They intended to make several demands of Sony, including an apology, a substantial donation, complete withdrawal of the game or modifying the segment featuring the interior of the cathedral, and financial support of Manchester groups trying to reduce gun crime in the city.|$|E

5|$|The Astros {{have made}} 12 {{selections}} in the supplemental {{round of the}} draft. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> the first overall selection in the draft five times; in 1976, 1992, 2012, 2013, and 2014. They have had 16 compensatory picks since {{the institution of the}} First-Year Player Draft in 1965. These additional picks are provided when a team loses a particularly valuable free agent in the prior off-season, or, more recently, if a team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous year. The Astros have failed to sign three of their first-round picks. First, pitcher Randy Scarbery (1970) did not sign though the Astros received no pick in compensation. John Burke (1991) and Brady Aiken (2014) also did not sign. The Astros were given the 37th pick of the 1992 draft and a pick in the 2015 draft in compensation.|$|E
5|$|Two {{of their}} first-round picks have won World Series championships with the team. Outfielder Willie Wilson (1974) and shortstop Buddy Biancalana (1978) {{appeared}} during the Royals' 1985 World Series victory. Zack Greinke (2002) is the only first-round pick of the Royals to earn a Cy Young Award with the team, winning in 2009. Royals' first-round picks have never won Rookie of the Year or Most Valuable Player awards, and no pick has been elected to the Hall of Fame. The Royals have made seven selections in the supplemental round of the draft. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> the first overall selection in the draft once, in 2006. The club has had 13 compensatory picks since {{the institution of the}} First-Year Player Draft in 1965. These additional picks are provided when a team loses a particularly valuable free agent in the prior off-season, or, more recently, if a team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous year. The Royals' first-ever pick, John Simmons (1969), did not sign with the club but they received no compensatory pick.|$|E
5|$|The Clintons accrued {{several million}} dollars in legal fees during his presidency; the bills were paid off four years after he left office. Bill and Hillary Clinton have both {{received}} {{millions of dollars in}} book authorship fees. In 2016, Forbes reported Bill and Hillary Clinton made about $240 million in the 15 years from January 2001 to December 2015 (mostly from paid speeches, business consulting and book-writing). Also in 2016, CNN reported the Clintons combined to receive more than $153 million in paid speeches from 2001 until spring 2015. In May 2015, The Hill reported that Bill and Hillary Clinton have made more than $25 million in speaking fees since the start of 2014, and that Hillary Clinton also made $5 million or more from her book, Hard Choices, during the same time period. In July 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported {{that at the end of}} 2012, the Clintons were worth between $5 million and $25.5 million, and that in 2012 (the last year they were required to disclose the information) the Clintons made between $16 and $17 million, mostly from speaking fees earned by the former president. Clinton earned more than $104 million from paid speeches between 2001 and 2012. In June 2014, ABC News and The Washington Post reported that Bill Clinton has made more than $100 million giving paid speeches since leaving public office, and in 2008, the New York Times reported that the Clintons' income tax returns show <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> $109 million in the 8 years from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2007, including almost $92 million from his speaking and book-writing.|$|E
