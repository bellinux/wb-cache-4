5|$|In 2002, {{frontman}} Dave Mustaine {{announced that}} he was disbanding Megadeth due to an arm injury that rendered him unable to play guitar. In a statement published on April 3, 2002, he stated <b>that</b> <b>doctors</b> expected that it would take about a year before he would recover from the injury. However, it was uncertain as to how complete of a recovery it would be. Mustaine stated his hopes to regain the ability to play guitar. He subsequently recovered following months of physical therapy.|$|E
5|$|Like {{those in}} the police force, many in the medical {{profession}} were reluctant {{to abide by the}} new laws. From September 30, gun applicants had to hand in a medical health evaluation (certifying that they were mentally sound enough to bear arms), carried out by a doctor, to gain access to a weapon. The Finnish Medical Association opposed this on the grounds <b>that</b> <b>doctors</b> were already overburdened with work, and Basic Services Minister Paula Risikko suggested that more medical workers could be employed by police departments instead.|$|E

The grave then collapses and Carlie falls in where she discovers <b>that</b> <b>Doctor</b> Octopus' body is not there. After Carlie has been captured by Menace, the Goblin King receives Carlie's journal from Menace where Goblin King discovers evidence in there <b>that</b> states <b>that</b> <b>Doctor</b> Octopus' mind is in Spider-Man's body.|$|R

5|$|When Kanō {{attended}} the Tokyo Imperial University in 1877, he {{started looking for}} jūjutsu teachers. He first looked for bonesetters, called seifukushi. His assumption was <b>that</b> <b>doctors</b> knew who the better martial art teachers were. His search brought him to Yagi Teinosuke, {{who had been a}} student of Emon Isomata in the Tenjin Shin'yō-ryū school of jūjutsu. Yagi, in turn, referred Kanō to Fukuda Hachinosuke, a bonesetter who taught Tenjin Shin'yō-ryū in a 10-mat room adjacent to his practice. Tenjin Shin'yō-ryū was itself a combination of two older schools: the Yōshin-ryū and Shin no Shindō-ryū.|$|E
5|$|After {{the lethal}} second wave struck in late 1918, new cases dropped abruptly– almost to nothing after {{the peak in}} the second wave. In Philadelphia, for example, 4,597 {{people died in the}} week ending 16 October, but by 11 November, {{influenza}} had almost disappeared from the city. One explanation for the rapid decline of the lethality of the disease is <b>that</b> <b>doctors</b> simply got better at preventing and treating the pneumonia that developed after the victims had contracted the virus, although John Barry stated in his book that researchers have found no evidence to support this.|$|E
5|$|The {{hospital}} in Kirkuk received {{large numbers of}} patients with symptoms <b>that</b> <b>doctors</b> recognised from the 1960 outbreak. The first case of alkylmercury poisoning was admitted to hospital on 21 December. By 26 December, the hospital had issued a specific warning to the government. By January 1972, the government had started to strongly warn the populace about eating the grain, although dispatches {{did not mention the}} large numbers already ill. The Iraqi Army soon ordered disposal of the grain and eventually declared the death penalty for anyone found selling it. Farmers dumped their supplies wherever possible, and it soon got into the water supply (particularly the River Tigris), causing further problems. The government issued a news blackout and released little information about the outbreak.|$|E

5|$|The murders {{committed}} by Burke and Hare raised {{public awareness of}} the need for bodies for medical purposes, and of the trade <b>that</b> <b>doctors</b> had conducted with grave robbers and murderers. The East London murder of a 14-year-old boy and the subsequent attempt to sell the corpse to the medical school at King's College London led to an investigation of the London Burkers, who had recently turned from grave robbing to murder to obtain corpses; two men were hanged in December 1831 for the crime. A bill was quickly introduced into Parliament, and gained royal assent nine months later to become the Anatomy Act 1832. This Act authorised dissection on bodies from workhouses unclaimed after 48 hours, and ended the practice of anatomising as part of the death sentence for murder.|$|E
25|$|By 1916, Arbuckle was {{experiencing}} serious health problems. An infection that developed {{on his leg}} became a carbuncle so severe <b>that</b> <b>doctors</b> considered amputation. Although Arbuckle {{was able to keep}} his leg, he became addicted to the pain killer morphine.|$|E

25|$|Unlike other countries, until {{recently}} Spain has registered a comparatively {{small number of}} Doctor degree holders, but the tendency is changing. According to the Spanish Statistical Office (INE), less than 5% of M.Sc. degree holders are admitted to Ph.D. programs.

50|$|The plaintiffs {{may also}} prove the {{negligence}} element by showing <b>that</b> the <b>doctor</b> failed to properly disclose {{the availability of}} genetic or prenatal screening procedures.

25|$|The {{deception}} {{was successful}} {{and almost all}} parties involved in Minamata disease were duped into believing that the factory's wastewater had been made safe from December 1959 onward.
