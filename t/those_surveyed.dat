5|$|Statistical ranking systems place Lasker {{high among}} the {{greatest}} players of all time. The book Warriors of the Mind places him sixth, behind Garry Kasparov, Anatoly Karpov, Fischer, Mikhail Botvinnik and Capablanca. In his 1978 book The Rating of Chessplayers, Past and Present, Arpad Elo gave retrospective ratings to players {{based on their}} performance over the best five-year span of their career. He concluded that Lasker was the joint second strongest player of <b>those</b> <b>surveyed</b> (tied with Botvinnik and behind Capablanca). The most up-to-date system, Chessmetrics, is rather sensitive {{to the length of}} the periods being compared, and ranks Lasker between fifth and second strongest of all time for peak periods ranging in length from one to twenty years.|$|E
5|$|The 7.7million day {{visitors}} and 5.5million who made overnight {{stays on the}} Norfolk coast in 1999 are estimated to have spent £122million, and secured the equivalent of 2,325 full-time jobs in that area. A 2005 survey at six North Norfolk coastal sites, including Blakeney, Cley and Morston found that 39per cent of visitors gave birdwatching as {{the main purpose of}} their visit. The villages nearest to the Point, Blakeney and Cley, had the highest per capita spend per visitor of <b>those</b> <b>surveyed,</b> and Cley was one of the two sites with the highest proportion of pre-planned visits. The equivalent of 52 full-time jobs in the Cley and Blakeney area are estimated to result from the £2.45million spent locally by the visiting public. In addition to birdwatching and boat trips to see the seals, sailing and walking are the other significant tourist activities in the area.|$|E

5|$|A CRA poll {{conducted}} throughout May 2013 continued to show declining support for Dunderdale, her government, and the PC Party. Only 21 per cent of <b>those</b> <b>surveyed</b> felt Dunderdale {{was the best}} choice for premier, behind both Michael and Ball. Dissatisfaction with her government increased to 65 per cent, compared to 33 per cent who indicated they were dissatisfied a year earlier. Support for the Progressive Conservatives also fell to just 27 per cent. This was below both the NDP and Liberals who were statistically tied for first, at 37 per cent and 36 per cent respectively. The poll also showed that 35 per cent of respondents were undecided or did not plan to vote, a significant increase from 14 per cent in November 2011. Towards the end of 2013, satisfaction for the Dunderdale administration saw a significant increase, though support for her and the PC Party saw little change from the poll in May. According to a November CRA poll, satisfaction with the Dunderdale government was up 10 points from May to 42 per cent, while dissatisfaction was at 52 per cent. A quarter of decided voters thought Dundedale was {{the best choice for}} premier, this was above Michael but 14 points below Ball. Due to a large drop in NDP support, down to 19 percent, the PC Party moved back into second place with 29 per cent of decided voters indicating that they would vote for the party in an election. The Liberal Party opened up a wide lead with 52 per cent of decided voters saying they would vote for the party in an election.|$|E

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Youth Cohort Study (YCS) is a major programme of longitudinal research designed to monitor the behaviour and decisions of representative samples of young people aged sixteen upwards as they {{make the transition from}} compulsory education to further or higher education, or to the labour market. It tries to identify and explain the factors which influence post- 16 transitions, for example, educational attainment, training opportunities, experiences at school. To date the YCS covers thirteen cohorts and over forty surveys. The first cohort was first surveyed in 1985 and the thirteenth in 2007. The questionnaires have been designed, over the years, to be broadly comparable, but external changes and shifts in policy interest have brought about changes - some minor, some fundamental. Cohorts One to Twelve cover England and Wales but a change to the methodology means that from Cohort Thirteen, data cover England only. For further details of the methodology and coverage, see the documentation. The UK Data Archive currently holds data for the cohorts listed below: Cohort One (SN 3093) <b>surveyed</b> <b>those</b> eligible to leave school in 1983 - 84 Cohort Two (SN 3094) <b>surveyed</b> <b>those</b> eligible to leave school in 1984 - 85 *Cohort Three (SN 3012) <b>surveyed</b> <b>those</b> eligible to leave school in 1985 - 86 Cohort Four (SN 3107) <b>surveyed</b> <b>those</b> eligible to leave school in 1987 - 88 Cohort Five (SN 3531) <b>surveyed</b> <b>those</b> eligible to leave school in 1989 - 90 Cohort Six (SN 3532) <b>surveyed</b> <b>those</b> eligible to leave school in 1990 - 91 Cohort Seven (SN 3533) <b>surveyed</b> <b>those</b> eligible to leave school in 1992 - 93 Cohort Eight (SN 3805) <b>surveyed</b> <b>those</b> eligible to leave school in 1995 - 96 Cohort Nine (SN 4009) <b>surveyed</b> <b>those</b> eligible to leave school in 1996 - 97 Cohort Ten (SN 4571) <b>surveyed</b> <b>those</b> eligible to leave school in 1998 - 99 Cohort Eleven (SN 5452) <b>surveyed</b> <b>those</b> eligible to leave school in 2000 - 01 Cohort Twelve (SN 5830) <b>surveyed</b> <b>those</b> eligible to leave school in 2002 - 03 Cohort Thirteen (SN 6024) <b>surveyed</b> <b>those</b> eligible to leave school in 2005 - 06 *Some teaching materials using the data from Cohort Three have been developed.
