5|$|In July 1968, Nelson {{failed to}} appear for a planned meeting {{with an old}} friend. John DuBois, at whose house the meeting was {{supposed}} to take place, became worried and drove to Nelson's camp. When he surveyed <b>the</b> <b>campsite,</b> everything appeared to be in order, until he got to Nelson's chickee.|$|E
5|$|The {{worldwide}} centenary of Scouting {{took place}} at the Brownsea Island Scout camp, celebrated on 1 August 2007, the 100th anniversary of the start of the first encampment. Activities by The Scout Association at <b>the</b> <b>campsite</b> included four Scout camps and a Sunrise Ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Prior to American {{settlement}} in the 19th century, the Puget Sound region was inhabited by indigenous Coast Salish peoples. The confluence of the two forks of the Stillaguamish River, the location of present-day downtown Arlington, was a prominent campsite for the Stillaguamish and Sauk peoples while following fish runs; the Stillaguamish named <b>the</b> <b>campsite</b> Skabalko, and had a major village at Chuck-Kol-Che upriver near modern-day Trafton.|$|E

5|$|Nobody except Leslie {{really cares}} about the trip: Ron (Nick Offerman) just wants to fish, Ben (Adam Scott) failed to bring a tent, and Tom (Aziz Ansari) just wants to relax in his huge tent filled with luxury {{electronic}} items. Tom expresses confusion as to why Ben, a state auditor who had been helping with Pawnee's financial problems, has not returned to his old job at Indianapolis; Ben does not explain his reasons, but it is hinted he harbors romantic feelings for Leslie. Meanwhile, Andy (Chris Pratt) sets up a romantic tent for April (Aubrey Plaza) in the wrong campsite miles away, forcing him to trek through the wilderness to find everyone and leaving April miserable on <b>the</b> <b>campsite</b> without Andy. During brainstorming sessions, nobody produces any good ideas because they assume Leslie will think of one. However, she worriedly confides to Ann and Ben she cannot think of anything {{on the same level}} of the harvest festival.|$|E
5|$|Thousands {{of horse}} and foot {{soldiers}} {{immersed in a}} sea of spears and lances populate the foreground. The two armies are distinguished by their dress, anachronistic though it is: whereas Alexander's men clad themselves and their horses in full suits of heavy armour, many of Darius' wear turbans and ride naked mounts. The bodies of the many fallen soldiers lie underfoot. A front of Macedonian warriors in the centre pushes against the crumbling enemy force, who flee the battlefield on the far left. The Persian king joins his army on his chariot of three horses, and is narrowly pursued by Alexander and his uniformly attired Companion cavalry. The tract of soldiers continues down the gently sloped battlefield to <b>the</b> <b>campsite</b> and cityscape by the water, gravitating toward the mountainous rise at the scene's centre.|$|E

5000|$|When a group {{comes to}} Flaming Arrow {{for longer than}} a day, they can stay {{overnight}} at one of <b>the</b> FASR's <b>campsites.</b> During <b>the</b> Summer Camp program, troops stay in either semi-permanent or cabin-style bunkhouses. The cabanas are located on Jenkins side of camp (the south side) in campsites Arapaho, Blackfoot and Cheyenne. These {{and the rest of}} <b>the</b> <b>campsites</b> use canvas wall tents erected on concrete platforms. On Jenkins side <b>the</b> remaining <b>campsites</b> are Dakota, Fox, Gosuite, and Hopi, <b>the</b> largest <b>campsite.</b> <b>The</b> rest of <b>the</b> <b>campsites</b> are on Hampton side (North side). These sites are Baden Powell, Beard, Seton, West, Boyce, Livingston, Tad Stoler, and <b>the</b> Outpost <b>Campsite</b> (previously known as Site 14). <b>The</b> Outpost <b>campsite</b> is <b>the</b> farthest site from the rest of camp. It also has no bathhouses, though it does have running water. (The outpost camp is now under renovations by Troop and Crew 123 to become the new [...] "Mountain Man" [...] site.) Livingston was closed because of its out dated facilities on top of hurricane damage, and spider infestation. (Beware of Fred Livingston!) Boyce is haunted and is never used; having burned down and overgrown. All <b>the</b> <b>campsites</b> in <b>the</b> main part of camp have flushing toilets, hot water showers, running water, and a pavilion. Many campsite pairs share a bath house (example: Cheyenne and Dakota, Beard and Seton). There is electricity in every occupied campsite. This includes lighting in all the cabanas, pavilions and bathhouses as well as electrical plugs. There are plans to have a plug for each tent in the near future as well as three new shared bathhouses.|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>campsite</b> was {{originally}} wasteland from {{the construction of}} the tunnel, so several sites are rocky. The railway runs close to some of the sites, so it can be noisy at times.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>campsite</b> can {{accommodate}} up to 1,400 persons {{on more than}} 60 different sites. On average during the summer, the site has around 750 guests at a time. While close to other groups, each group {{can be sure of}} their own campsite, ensuring both an international atmosphere and privacy. The sites have running water nearby and there are toilets and showers with hot water close at hand, which the visiting groups help to look after during their stay. There is a shop open on <b>the</b> <b>campsite</b> during the summer and a campsite office that is open most of the time. There is also a drying room and multiple picnic and barbecue facilities.|$|E

25|$|The dam project also {{forced the}} {{displacement}} of Camp Olmsted, owned by the Chief Cornplanter Council of the Boy Scouts of America. <b>The</b> <b>campsite</b> had been located on bottomland along the Allegheny River, but dam construction forced it to be moved up the hillside.|$|E

5000|$|In Camp Waubeeka, Scouts cook {{their own}} meals in a patrol-style cook site. Scouts pick up {{ingredients}} for each meal at the Commissary building. Food is cooked {{on top of}} cast-ironwood-burning stoves called sheepherders or {{on top of a}} half-barrel grill. No food is stored in <b>the</b> <b>campsites,</b> but utensils and condiments can be kept in large patrol boxes, called [...] "monster boxes" [...] which are locked at night to keep animals away from <b>the</b> <b>campsites.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{golf club}} is near <b>the</b> <b>campsite</b> that sits within the park. The land was bought for $4,000 and {{development}} began in 1959. The nine-hole course was built using the natural terrain; however, some elevation {{changes were made}} to accommodate the large hills and valleys. For 50 cents an hour, workers had to climb and mark trees with ribbon, dig out roots, and blast out four-foot tree stumps. It was a five-year project that finished in 1965. The course hosts a men’s and women’s tournament along with kid’s night golfing.|$|E
25|$|The Crown {{alleged that}} Lindy Chamberlain had cut Azaria's throat {{in the front}} seat of the family car, hiding the baby's body in a large camera case. She then, {{according}} to the proposed reconstruction of the crime, rejoined the group of campers around a campfire and fed one of her sons a can of baked beans, before going to the tent and raising the cry that a dingo had taken the baby. It was alleged that at a later time, while other people from <b>the</b> <b>campsite</b> were searching, she disposed of the body.|$|E
