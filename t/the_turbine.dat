5|$|Wind turbine {{design is}} the process of {{defining}} the form and specifications of a wind turbine to extract energy from the wind. A wind turbine installation consists of the necessary systems needed to capture the wind's energy, point <b>the</b> <b>turbine</b> into the wind, convert mechanical rotation into electrical power, and other systems to start, stop, and control <b>the</b> <b>turbine.</b>|$|E
5|$|Further insufficiencies, such as {{rotor blade}} {{friction}} and drag, gearbox losses, generator and converter losses, reduce the power delivered by a wind turbine. The basic relation that <b>the</b> <b>turbine</b> power is (approximately) {{proportional to the}} third power of velocity remains.|$|E
5|$|The HPOTP turbine and HPOTP {{pumps are}} {{mounted on a}} common shaft. Mixing of the fuel-rich hot gases in <b>the</b> <b>turbine</b> section and the liquid oxygen in the main pump can create a hazard and, to prevent this, the two {{sections}} are separated by a cavity that is continuously purged by the engine's helium supply during engine operation. Two seals minimize leakage into the cavity; one seal is located between <b>the</b> <b>turbine</b> section and the cavity, while the other is between the pump section and cavity. Loss of helium pressure in this cavity results in automatic engine shutdown.|$|E
50|$|By 2010 <b>the</b> <b>turbines</b> were antiquated; only two-thirds {{were still}} in operation. The farm was {{decommissioned}} that year in anticipation of replacing <b>the</b> <b>turbines</b> with more efficient modern models.|$|R

50|$|In {{operation}} <b>the</b> <b>turbines</b> {{have indeed}} reduced power bills, {{but at a}} cost of a loss of quality of life for nearby residents, who complain that <b>the</b> <b>turbines</b> cause constant noise and vibration.|$|R
5|$|The {{aerodynamics}} of a {{wind turbine}} are not straightforward. The air flow at the blades {{is not the}} same as the airflow far away from <b>the</b> <b>turbine.</b> The very nature of the way in which energy is extracted from the air also causes air to be deflected by <b>the</b> <b>turbine.</b> In addition the aerodynamics of a wind turbine at the rotor surface exhibit phenomena that are rarely seen in other aerodynamic fields. The shape and dimensions of the blades of the wind turbine are determined by the aerodynamic performance required to efficiently extract energy from the wind, and by the strength required to resist the forces on the blade.|$|E
5|$|The A Station's {{control room}} was given many Art Deco {{fittings}} by architect Halliday. Italian marble {{was used in}} <b>the</b> <b>turbine</b> hall, and polished parquet floors and wrought-iron staircases were used throughout. Owing {{to a lack of}} available money following the Second World War, the interior of the B Station was not given the same treatment, and instead the fittings were made from stainless steel.|$|E
5|$|The Shapinsay {{development}} {{trust is}} working on the island's community plan, and owns the island's wind turbine, which was completed in August 2011 after the community voted for its construction. According to the development trust, <b>the</b> <b>turbine</b> could earn more than Â£5million during its 25-year lifetime.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>turbines</b> were {{delivered}} in three main groups after extensive {{testing of the}} prototype. Union Pacific intended to use <b>the</b> <b>turbines</b> to replace <b>the</b> famous Big Boys which {{were about to be}} retired.|$|R
25|$|A {{steam turbine}} ship {{can be either}} direct {{propulsion}} (<b>the</b> <b>turbines,</b> equipped with a reduction gear, rotate directly the propellers), or turboelectric (<b>the</b> <b>turbines</b> rotate electric generators, which in turn feed electric motors operating the propellers).|$|R
5000|$|On 17 December 2010, <b>the</b> first <b>turbine</b> was {{connected}} to the power grid. [...] It was officially put into operation on 7 January 2011. [...] <b>The</b> second <b>turbine</b> was put to operation on 10 May 2011, <b>the</b> third <b>turbine</b> on 20 October 2011, <b>the</b> fourth <b>turbine</b> on 22 December 2011, <b>the</b> fifth <b>turbine</b> on 30 April 2012, and <b>the</b> sixth <b>turbine</b> on 26 September 2012. [...] The project was completed on 20 December 2012.|$|R
5|$|The {{disadvantages}} of <b>the</b> <b>turbine</b> were eventually overcome. The solution which eventually was generally adopted was the geared turbine, where gearing reduced the rotation {{rate of the}} propellers and hence increased efficiency. This solution required technical precision in the gears and hence was difficult to implement.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>turbine</b> {{building}} was modified {{to take more}} equipment, resulting in a rearrangement of the walls to enlarge it and addition of a gable to it, similar in appearance to that on the generator building. It has a much higher floor than the generator building and received a pair of vertical turbine/generator sets.|$|E
5|$|Today these {{generators}} aren't used {{any more}} in modern turbines. Instead today most turbines use variable speed generators combined with partial- or full-scale power converter between <b>the</b> <b>turbine</b> generator and the collector system, which generally have more desirable properties for grid interconnection and have Low voltage ride through-capabilities. Modern concepts use either doubly fed machines with partial-scale converters or squirrel-cage induction generators or synchronous generators (both permanently and electrically excited) with full scale converters.|$|E
5000|$|In 1900 <b>the</b> <b>turbines</b> {{started to}} drive {{electric}} generators {{to power the}} machines, which had individual electrical motors. Three years later <b>the</b> <b>turbines</b> were providing electricity to the mill and to deliver electric street lighting to the town, [...] and in 1909 <b>the</b> new company <b>turbines</b> were generating 640 hp.|$|R
50|$|Wind turbine {{syndrome}} is a psychosomatic disorder largely caused by anxiety about wind farms {{and not by}} <b>the</b> <b>turbines</b> themselves. There is limited evidence of anxiety effects caused by low level noise in the close vicinity of <b>the</b> <b>turbines.</b>|$|R
50|$|Preparatory {{work for}} the site began in 2008, with <b>the</b> wind <b>turbines</b> being erected in August 2010. <b>The</b> <b>turbines</b> went live on 10 September 2010.|$|R
5|$|Total {{wind power}} could be {{captured}} {{only if the}} wind velocity is reduced to zero. In a realistic wind turbine this is impossible, as the captured air must also leave <b>the</b> <b>turbine.</b> A relation between the input and output wind velocity must be considered. Using the concept of stream tube, the maximal achievable extraction of wind power by a wind turbine is 59% of the total theoretical wind power (see: Betz' law).|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, two {{additional}} generators {{were added to}} the power station, bringing the total to six. Between 1995 and 2003, the dam's six hydroelectric generators were upgraded, bringing the installed capacity of the power plant from 92 MW to 120 MW and increasing its generation 20%. Each autumn, a generator was taken out of service, upgraded and returned to service by spring of the next year. The sixth and final generator upgrade was completed in May 2003. Among the components principally upgraded were <b>the</b> <b>turbine</b> shafts and runners.|$|E
5|$|King George V {{had four}} sets of Parsons geared {{turbines}}. Two main turbines were arranged in series and drove a shaft through double helical gears. An astern turbine was incorporated in the exhaust casing of the low-pressure turbine, and a cruising turbine was coupled directly to the high-pressure turbine. A speed of 28.5 knots was expected at standard displacement and 27.5 knots at full-load displacement on normal output; corresponding speeds at overload condition were 29.25 and 28.25 knots respectively. <b>The</b> <b>turbine</b> unit was a low-speed type (2,257 rpm) coupled to a single reduction gear which produced 236 rpm at the propeller shaft.|$|E
50|$|After {{receiving}} multiple {{complaints from}} Vinalhaven residents about the noise generated by <b>the</b> <b>turbines,</b> <b>the</b> cooperative ran {{an experiment in}} sound reduction.There is also concern that <b>the</b> wind <b>turbines</b> are a threat to bald eagles nesting in the vicinity.|$|R
50|$|The {{farm was}} first {{proposed}} by landowners Peter and Martin Edwards in 1989, and was opened in 1991. They chose {{to invest in}} <b>the</b> <b>turbines,</b> instead of a nuclear power plant, {{in the hope of}} pushing the UK in a greener direction. It took three months of construction to build the site and less than a month to commission <b>the</b> <b>turbines.</b> In its first year, the Delabole wind farm brought in 100,000 visitors who were able to look around <b>the</b> <b>turbines</b> freely on tourist walks.|$|R
50|$|According to viewshed mapping {{prepared}} {{as part of}} <b>the</b> application, <b>the</b> <b>turbines</b> are visible from parts of Greenbrier, Nicholas and Pocahontas Counties. At least parts of <b>the</b> <b>turbines</b> {{can be seen from}} areas within the Monongahela National Forest, Watoga State Park, and the Cranberry Wilderness Areas.|$|R
5|$|The {{steam turbine}} {{section of a}} power plant, <b>the</b> <b>turbine</b> hall, {{generally}} costs about $1/W, and the electrical equipment to feed that power to the grid is about another $1/W. To reach the projected total CAPEX quoted in LIFE documents, this implies that the entire nuclear island has to cost around $4/W for LIFE.2, and just over $2/W for LIFE.3. Modern nuclear plants, benefiting from decades of commercial experience and continuous design work, cost just under $8/W, with approximately half {{of that in the}} nuclear island. LLNL's estimates require LIFE.3 to be built in 2040 for about half the cost of a fission plant today.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{turbines}} {{are affected}} by wind shear. Vertical wind-speed profiles result in different wind speeds at the blades nearest to the ground level compared to those {{at the top of}} blade travel, and this in turn affects <b>the</b> <b>turbine</b> operation. This low level wind shear can create a large bending moment in the shaft of a two bladed turbine when the blades are vertical. The reduced wind shear over water means shorter and less expensive wind turbine towers can be used in shallow seas.|$|E
5|$|According to Admiral Kummetz' report, {{the first}} torpedo hit Kesselraum 2 (boileroom 2, {{just under the}} funnel) and the second hit Turbinenraum 2/3 (<b>the</b> <b>turbine</b> room for the side shafts). Boiler 1 had already been {{destroyed}} by gunfire. Only one boiler remained, but the steam pipes through boiler 1 and 2 and turbine room 2/3 had been damaged and turbine 1 for the main shaft lost its power. By 04:34, the ship had been severely damaged, but had successfully passed through the firing zone; the Norwegian guns could no longer bear on her. The 15cm guns in the KopÃ¥s battery were all standing in open positions with a wide sector of firing. After the torpedo hits, BlÃ¼cher was still within range. The battery asked for orders, but Eriksen concluded: The fortress has served its purpose. With all propellers stopped, about 60% of the electric power gone, Blucher quickly lost speed and at about 04:50 dropped anchors at Askoholmene.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>turbines</b> {{were also}} {{interchangeable}} with Torness and Heysham 2 power station; the stator {{from one of}} <b>the</b> <b>turbines</b> was transferred to Heysham 2 Nuclear power station in the 1990s under the CEGB which was then privatised to National Power, Powergen, Nuclear Electric and British Energy.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> wind <b>turbine</b> {{originally}} {{operated on}} a wind farm in Denmark, which resold <b>the</b> wind <b>turbine</b> while repowering to newer, larger wind <b>turbines.</b> <b>The</b> ground around <b>the</b> wind <b>turbine</b> features an art display entitled Shadow and Light. The display includes walkways that align with <b>the</b> wind <b>turbine's</b> shadow at solar noon and two hours, eleven minutes after solar noon, respectively. On the vernal and autumnal equinoxes, <b>the</b> wind <b>turbine's</b> shadow also aligns with the walkways by length. Thus <b>the</b> wind <b>turbine</b> {{functions as a}} large gnomon in an incomplete sundial. The display includes boxes of light bulbs encased in concrete {{on one side of}} a plaza around <b>the</b> wind <b>turbine's</b> base, representing <b>the</b> amount of electricity consumed by the average American household in a year.|$|R

5|$|Arizona was {{commissioned}} into the Navy on 17 October 1916 with John D. McDonald as captain. She departed New York on 10 November 1916 after {{the crew had}} cleaned the ship and the propulsion system had been tested at the dock. After declinating the ship's magnetic compasses, the ship sailed south for her shakedown cruise. Outside Guantanamo Bay, a stripped turbine on 7 December forced the navy to order Arizona back to New York for repairs, although {{she was able to}} enter Chesapeake Bay to test her main and secondary gun batteries on 19â20 December. <b>The</b> <b>turbine</b> could not be repaired inside the ship, so the yard workers had to cut holes in the upper decks to lift the damaged casing out. It was reinstalled after almost four months of repairs at the naval yard.|$|E
5|$|In {{boiler room}} No.4, at around 01:20, water began {{flooding}} in from below, possibly {{indicating that the}} bottom of the ship had also been holed by the iceberg. The flow of water soon overwhelmed the pumps and forced the firemen and trimmers to evacuate the forward boiler rooms. Further aft, Chief Engineer William Bell, his engineering colleagues, and a handful of volunteer firemen and greasers stayed behind in the unflooded No.1, 2 and 3 boiler rooms and in <b>the</b> <b>turbine</b> and reciprocating engine rooms. They continued working on the boilers and the electrical generators {{in order to keep the}} ship's lights and pumps operable and to power the radio so that distress signals could be sent. They remained at their posts until the very end, thus ensuring that Titanics electrics functioned until the final minutes of the sinking. None of the ship's 35 engineers and electricians survived. Neither did any of the Titanics five postal clerks, who were last seen struggling to save the mail bags they had rescued from the flooded mail room. They were caught by the rising water somewhere on D deck.|$|E
5|$|Shortly before 16:00, the battlecruisers of I Scouting Group {{encountered}} the British 1st Battlecruiser Squadron {{under the command}} of Vice Admiral David Beatty. The opposing ships began an artillery duel that saw the destruction of , shortly after 17:00, and , less than half an hour later. At 16:19, Kaiserin was forced to temporarily stop <b>the</b> <b>turbine</b> on the center shaft, as the condenser had started leaking. The crew were able to restart the engine before Kaiserin came into action. By this time, the German battlecruisers were steaming south to draw the British ships toward {{the main body of the}} High Seas Fleet. At 17:30, the crew of the leading German battleship, , spotted both the IScouting Group and the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron approaching. The German battlecruisers were steaming to starboard, while the British ships steamed to port. At 17:45, Scheer ordered a two-point turn to port to bring his ships closer to the British battlecruisers, and a minute later, the order to open fire was given.|$|E
30|$|Because of {{the initial}} {{consideration}} of producing all steam needed with <b>the</b> <b>turbineâs</b> exhaust gasses, <b>the</b> W/Q ratio coincides obviously with <b>the</b> gas <b>turbine</b> efficiency in every case.|$|R
