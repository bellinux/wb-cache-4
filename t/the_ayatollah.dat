5|$|Jennings {{returned}} to the U.S. {{at the end of}} 1974 to become Washington correspondent and news anchor for ABC's new morning program AM America, a predecessor to Good Morning America. ABC was hoping that the show, in which it had invested $8 million, would challenge NBC's highly popular Today. AM America debuted on January 6, 1975, with Jennings delivering regular newscasts from Washington. The show never gained ground against Today, and was canceled in just ten months. In November 1975, Jennings moved abroad, this time as ABC's chief foreign correspondent. He continued to cover the Middle East, and in 1978 he was the first Canadian or American reporter to interview <b>the</b> <b>Ayatollah</b> Khomeini of Iran, then in exile in Paris.|$|E

25|$|Nearly {{a hundred}} Iran {{political}} prisoners {{were killed by}} the SAVAK during the decade before the revolution and many more were arrested and tortured. The Islamic clergy, headed by <b>the</b> <b>Ayatollah</b> Ruhollah Khomeini (who had been exiled in 1964), were becoming increasingly vociferous.|$|E
25|$|Although {{ultimately}} {{only the}} Lebanese Islamists succeeded, other activities {{have had more}} long-term impact. <b>The</b> <b>Ayatollah</b> Khomeini's 1989 fatwa calling for the killing of Indian-born British citizen Salman Rushdie had international impact. The Islamic revolutionary government itself is credited with helping establish Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq.|$|E
25|$|The Iranian {{government}} {{claims that}} Bahá'ís are {{enemies of the}} state, were supporters of the former Shah's government and spies employed by imperialist governments of the West. <b>The</b> <b>Ayatollah</b> Khomeini, even before his return to Iran {{said in an interview}} that he believed that Bahá'ís were traitors — Zionists — and enemies of Islam.|$|E

25|$|The Iranian {{government}} {{responds to}} these statements {{by saying that}} Bahá'ís are enemies of the state, were supporters of the former Shah's government and spies employed by imperialist governments of the West. <b>The</b> <b>Ayatollah</b> Khomeini, even before his return to Iran {{said in an interview}} that he believed that Bahá'ís were traitors — Zionists — and enemies of Islam.|$|E

25|$|In April 2014 and November 2015, as {{a mark of}} {{solidarity}} with the Bahá'í community of Iran, Ayatollah Abdol-Hamid Masoumi-Tehrani gifted the Bahá'ís a calligraphy work from the writings of Bahá'u'lláh. <b>The</b> <b>Ayatollah's</b> call for religious tolerance and co-existence has received worldwide support from religious leaders.|$|R

25|$|In early 1979, Iran's Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi {{was overthrown}} by the Islamic Revolution, thus {{giving way to}} an Islamic {{republic}} led by <b>the</b> <b>Ayatollah</b> Ruhollah Khomeini. The influence of revolutionary Shi'ite Islam grew apace in the region, particularly in countries with large Shi'ite populations, especially Iraq. Saddam feared that radical Islamic ideas—hostile to his secular rule—were rapidly spreading inside his country among the majority Shi'ite population.|$|E
25|$|Hoveyda was {{alleged to}} have been the author of an article which {{attacked}} the opposition figure <b>the</b> <b>Ayatollah</b> Ruhollah Khomeini as being a British agent and a liar, which was anyonymously published in Kayhan newspaper on January 1978 on the Shah's orders. Whether or not the allegations were true, the article generated a major backlash among Khomeini's supporters, which eventually spiralled into the Iranian Revolution.|$|E

25|$|As the Muslim world {{came into}} contact with secular ideals, {{societies}} responded in different ways. Some Muslim-majority countries are secular. Azerbaijan became the first secular republic in the Muslim world, between 1918 and 1920, before it was incorporated into the Soviet Union. Turkey has been governed as a secular state since the reforms of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. By contrast, the 1979 Iranian Revolution replaced a mostly secular regime with an Islamic republic led by <b>the</b> <b>Ayatollah,</b> Ruhollah Khomeini.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the failed}} rescue attempt, Carter took {{overwhelming}} {{blame for the}} Iran hostage crisis, in which the followers of <b>the</b> <b>Ayatollah</b> Khomeini burned American flags and chanted anti-American slogans, paraded the captured American hostages in public, and burned Carter in effigy. Carter's critics saw him as an inept leader who had failed to solve the worsening economic problems at home. His supporters defended the president as a decent, well-intentioned man being unfairly criticized for problems that had been escalating for years.|$|E
25|$|Factional {{conflict}} dominated Iranian economic politics under <b>the</b> <b>Ayatollah</b> Khomeini from 1979 to 1989. The {{two principal}} factions were a statist-reformist group that favored state {{control of the}} economy and a conservative group that favored the private sector. Both factions claimed Khomeini's support, but by 1987, he clearly had sided with the statist-reformists because he believed state capitalism to be the best way of heading off any threat to Islam. Khomeini's death on 3 June 1989 left the factions without their source of legitimation.|$|E
5000|$|In {{approximately}} August 2007, Lee Hamilton sent {{an appeal}} on Esfandiari's behalf to Supreme Leader of Iran Ali Khamenei, mentioning her extensive efforts to explain Iran's history and culture.

5000|$|Only {{a few of}} <b>the</b> most {{important}} <b>ayatollah</b> are accorded <b>the</b> rank of Grand Ayatollah (Ayatollah Uzma, [...] "Great Sign of God"). This usually happens when the followers of one of <b>the</b> <b>ayatollahs</b> refer to him in many situations {{and ask him to}} publish his Juristic book in which he answers the vast majority of daily Muslim affairs. The book is called Resalah, which is usually a reinvention of the book Al-Urwatu l-Wuthqah, according to their knowledge of the most authentic Islamic sources and their application to current life.|$|R

25|$|The Satanic Verses controversy, {{also known}} as the Rushdie Affair, was the heated and {{frequently}} violent reaction of Muslims to the publication of Salman Rushdie's novel The Satanic Verses, which was first published in the United Kingdom in 1988 and inspired in part by the life of the prophet Muhammad. Many Muslims accused Rushdie of blasphemy or unbelief and in 1989 <b>the</b> <b>Ayatollah</b> Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran issued a fatwa ordering Muslims to kill Rushdie. Numerous killings, attempted killings, and bombings resulted from angry Muslims over the novel.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 1978 (as the Shah's {{power was}} crumbling), Bakhtiar was chosen {{to help in the}} {{creation}} of a civilian government to replace the existing military one. He was appointed to the position of Prime Minister by the Shah, as a concession to his opponents, especially the followers of <b>the</b> <b>Ayatollah</b> Ruhollah Khomeini. Although that caused him to be expelled from the National Front, he accepted the appointment, as he feared a revolution in which communists and mullahs would take over the country, which he thought would ruin Iran.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} famous {{political}} uses of cassette tapes was the dissemination of sermons by <b>the</b> <b>Ayatollah</b> Khomeini throughout Iran before the 1979 Iranian Revolution, in which Khomeini urged the overthrow of the regime of the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. In 1970s India, cassettes were blamed for bringing unwanted Christian and Islamic influences into traditionally Sikh and Hindu areas. Cassette technology was a booming market for pop music in India, drawing criticism from conservatives {{while at the same time}} creating a huge market for legitimate recording companies, as well as pirated tapes.|$|E

50|$|When {{the terrorists}} are {{captured}} and interrogated by Clark in Mexico City, they implicate <b>the</b> Iranian <b>ayatollah</b> in <b>the</b> attack. President Fowler orders <b>the</b> <b>Ayatollah's</b> residence in <b>the</b> {{holy city of}} Qom to be destroyed by a nuclear strike. After Ryan averts the attack by enforcing the two-man rule, Ryan lies and claims that Qom was destroyed. The terrorists then reveal that Iran was not involved, and that their deceit was meant to discredit the United States and destroy the peace process, allowing the campaign against Israel to continue. It is implied that President Fowler is subsequently removed from office following the process established in the U.S. Constitution after suffering a nervous breakdown.|$|R
