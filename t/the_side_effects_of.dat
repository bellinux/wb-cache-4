5|$|Doctors will {{sometimes}} prescribe immunosuppressive {{drugs such as}} prednisolone and ciclosporin if the patient is suffering from an intense form of solar urticaria.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> Adderall {{are many}} and varied, {{but the amount}} of {{substance}} consumed is the primary factor in determining the likelihood and severity of side effects. Adderall is currently approved for long-term therapeutic use by the USFDA. Recreational use of Adderall generally involves far larger doses and is therefore significantly more dangerous, involving a much greater risk of serious side effects.|$|E

5|$|In chronic {{inflammatory}} {{diseases like}} atopic dermatitis (skin), rheumatoid arthritis (joints),…, <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> corticosteroids are problematic {{because of the}} necessary long-term treatment. Therefore, SEGRAMs are being investigated as an alternative topical treatment. Systemic long-term treatment of inflammations with corticosteroids is particularly liable to cause metabolic side-effects, which makes the development of oral SEGRAMs an interesting goal. It {{remains to be seen}} whether selective receptor agonists or modulators indeed cause significantly less side-effects than classical corticoids in clinical applications.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> {{amphetamine}} are varied, and {{the amount}} of amphetamine used is the primary factor in determining the likelihood and severity of side effects. Amphetamine products such as Adderall, Dexedrine, and their generic equivalents are currently approved by the USFDA for long-term therapeutic use. Recreational use of amphetamine generally involves much larger doses, which have a greater risk of serious side effects than dosages used for therapeutic reasons.|$|E
5|$|Abnormalities of behavior, {{also called}} {{abnormalities}} of activity, include observations of specific abnormal movements, {{as well as}} more general observations of the patient's level of activity and arousal, and observations of the patient's eye contact and gait. Abnormal movements, for example choreiform, athetoid or choreoathetoid movements may indicate a neurological disorder. A tremor or dystonia may indicate a neurological condition or <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> antipsychotic medication. The patient may have tics (involuntary but quasi-purposeful movements or vocalizations) which may be a symptom of Tourette's syndrome. There are a range of abnormalities of movement which are typical of catatonia, such as echopraxia, catalepsy, waxy flexibility and paratonia (or gegenhalten). Stereotypies (repetitive purposeless movements such as rocking or head banging) or mannerisms (repetitive quasi-purposeful abnormal movements such as a gesture or abnormal gait) may be a feature of chronic schizophrenia or autism.|$|E

Next, the chemical structure information of the drug is obtained from the PubChem data base. Then, the association rules between the chemical structure and <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> are defined. <b>The</b> associate rules are applied to <b>the</b> prediction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> 10 chemical products...|$|R

5|$|Although benzodiazepines {{are much}} safer in {{overdose}} than their predecessors, the barbiturates, {{they can still}} cause problems in overdose. Taken alone, they rarely cause severe complications in overdose; statistics in England showed that benzodiazepines were responsible for 3.8% of all deaths by poisoning from a single drug. However, combining these drugs with alcohol, opiates or tricyclic antidepressants markedly raises the toxicity. The elderly are more sensitive to <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> benzodiazepines, and poisoning may even occur from their long-term use. The various benzodiazepines differ in their toxicity; temazepam appears most toxic in overdose and when used with other drugs. The symptoms of a benzodiazepine overdose may include; drowsiness, slurred speech, nystagmus, hypotension, ataxia, coma, respiratory depression, and cardiorespiratory arrest.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Taub, {{using his}} {{experience}} as a plastic surgeon, gains Kenny's and his father's trust and frequently clashes with House on the diagnosis. House believes Kenny is suffering juvenile rheumatoid arthritis while Taub believes it is merely <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> increased intracranial pressure. By persuading Kenny's father not to follow House's treatment and by attempting to kick him off the case, House fires Taub, only to have his decision reversed by Cuddy. Ultimately both House and Taub are proven wrong when Thirteen realizes Kenny is suffering Lyme disease, with the telltale rash hidden by his hair. Incensed by Taub's actions, House begins to dig into his life, and gets him to confess that he resigned his old position as a plastic surgeon because he was discovered having a secret affair with his nurse. He signed a non-compete agreement with his former partners in exchange for their keeping quiet about the affair, effectively blackballing him out of his area of expertise.|$|E
5|$|He {{published}} his autobiography Ray of Hope in 1993, co-authored by Dr. Andrew Lees, who {{at that time}} treated Kennedy for Parkinson's disease. Later that year he sold his collection of medals and international caps to raise funds. In 2002, he was reported as living alone in a bungalow in New Hartley. In an interview two years later, he revealed that he suffers from loneliness and hallucinations due to his condition and <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> his medication. Following the interview a Liverpool fan bought Kennedy a computer, which allowed him to make friends on football chat rooms. Kennedy remained a favourite amongst Liverpool supporters decades after leaving the club, and was voted in at No.25 on the 2013 poll '100 Players Who Shook The Kop'.|$|E

5|$|Of the {{elements}} less often recognised as metalloids, beryllium and lead are noted for their toxicity; lead arsenate {{has been extensively}} used as an insecticide. Sulfur {{is one of the}} oldest of the fungicides and pesticides. Phosphorus, sulfur, zinc, selenium and iodine are essential nutrients, and aluminium, tin and lead may be. Sulfur, gallium, selenium, iodine and bismuth have medicinal applications. Sulfur is a constituent of sulfonamide drugs, still widely used for conditions such as acne and urinary tract infections. Gallium nitrate is used to treat <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> cancer; gallium citrate, a radiopharmaceutical, facilitates imaging of inflamed body areas. Selenium sulfide is used in medicinal shampoos and to treat skin infections such as tinea versicolor. Iodine is used as a disinfectant in various forms. Bismuth is an ingredient in some antibacterials.|$|E
5|$|Adderall is {{generally}} well-tolerated and effective in treating {{the symptoms of}} ADHD and narcolepsy. At therapeutic doses, Adderall causes emotional and cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in desire for sex, increased wakefulness, and improved cognitive control. At these doses, it induces physical effects such as decreased reaction time, fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength. In contrast, much larger doses of Adderall can impair cognitive control, cause rapid muscle breakdown, or induce a psychosis (e.g., delusions and paranoia). <b>The</b> <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> Adderall vary widely among individuals, but most commonly include insomnia, dry mouth, and loss of appetite. The risk of developing an addiction is insignificant when Adderall is used as prescribed at fairly low daily doses, such as those used for treating ADHD; however, the routine use of Adderall in larger daily doses poses a significant risk of addiction due to the pronounced reinforcing effects that are present at higher doses. Recreational doses of Adderall are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses, and carry a far greater risk of serious adverse effects.|$|E

25|$|Another factor often implicated is to <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> {{antipsychotic}} medications.
