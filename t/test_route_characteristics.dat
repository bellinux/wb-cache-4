To evaluate the safety related influences of these systems on driver behaviour empirical research is needed. In a study funded by BMW and DRIVE the authors were to answer the question which kind of test route would be appropriate for such research work. Here, some of the more principal Lines of reasoning Leading to the proposal of <b>test</b> <b>route</b> <b>characteristics</b> are presented. At first, we List the possible effects, that navigation systems can have on driver behaviour and try to explain these effects within some theoretical framework. problems of mental Load, visual distraction, over-reliance, deskilling, interactions with unprotected road-users and system misuse are discussed. The next paragraph discusses various parameters of drivers and the road environment that possibly moderate the outcome of a study for each of the effects Listed above. The most important variables are the degree of driving experience, the driver’s special abilities and their amount of local knowledge about the road network. Some general conclusions from the discussion for test route selection are summarised...|$|E

30|$|A Swedish {{motorway}} with {{a normal}} speed limit of 110  km/h {{was used as a}} <b>test</b> <b>route.</b> The route was a replicate of the E 4 between Linköping and Jönköping, driving on the right side. In the beginning of the drive there were three overtaking events where the test driver was supposed to overtake slow vehicles. This was to increase the realism, in addition every 7  min a car overtook the test driver. Half-way through the <b>test</b> <b>route,</b> the posted speed limit was changed to 90  km/h for 1  km, because there was a similar change of speed on the real road simulated.

40|$|Over {{the years}} that {{radioactive}} material (RAM) transportation risk estimates have been calculated using the RADTRAN code, demand for improved geographic resolution of <b>route</b> <b>characteristics,</b> especially density of population neighboring route segments, has led to code improvements that provide more specific route definition.

30|$|Accurate and {{reliable}} {{positioning of the}} vehicle along the <b>test</b> <b>route</b> is still a challenge since each of the used technologies has advantages and disadvantages. Optical positioning (cameras, stereo cameras, Lidar) requires visible orientation marks (e.g. road markers) or an optical reference map (e.g. LIDAR). In addition to the elaborate recording and maintenance of these reference data, driving environments with (partly) missing or insufficient road markings (along the <b>test</b> <b>route</b> in Koppl) and (partly) missing reference objects (e.g. along meadows or in tunnels) are problematic. Therefore, optical positioning works only for parts of the <b>test</b> <b>route</b> in Koppl (along the short route in the village centre), while {{it does not work}} reliably for the parts with missing reference objects. Multi-GNSS Real-time Kinematics (RTK) is a suitable technology to obtain centimetre-accurate positions using satellite positioning [17]. The prerequisite for centimetre-accurate GNSS-positioning is a reliable correction signal from a near GNSS reference base. This signal is transmitted either via mobile radio (3 G/ 4 G) from an Internet-based correction service (e.g. APOS service in Austria) or as in Koppl from a local reference station (e.g. via UHF frequencies) due to missing reliability of the mobile radio connection on parts of the route.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 A {{proof-of-concept}} software-in-the-loop {{study is}} performed {{to assess the}} accuracy of predicted net and charge-gaining energy consumption for potential effective use in optimizing powertrain management of hybrid vehicles. With promising results of improving fuel efficiency of a thermostatic control strategy for a series, plug-ing, hybrid-electric vehicle by 8. 24 %, the route and speed prediction machine learning algorithms are redesigned and implemented for real- world testing in a stand-alone C++ code-base to ingest map data, learn and predict driver habits, and store driver data for fast startup and shutdown of the controller or computer used to execute the compiled algorithm. Speed prediction is performed using a multi-layer, multi-input, multi- output neural network using feed-forward prediction and gradient descent through back- propagation training. Route prediction utilizes a Hidden Markov Model with a recurrent forward algorithm for prediction and multi-dimensional hash maps to store state and state distribution constraining associations between atomic road segments and end destinations. Predicted energy is calculated using the predicted time-series speed and elevation profile over the predicted route and the road-load equation. Testing of the code-base is performed over a known road network spanning 24 x 35 blocks on the south hill of Spokane, Washington. A large set of training routes are traversed once to add randomness to the route prediction algorithm, and {{a subset of the}} training <b>routes,</b> <b>testing</b> <b>routes,</b> are traversed to assess the accuracy of the net and charge-gaining predicted energy consumption. Each <b>test</b> <b>route</b> is traveled a random number of times with varying speed conditions from traffic and pedestrians to add randomness to speed prediction. Prediction data is stored and analyzed in a post process Matlab script. The aggregated results and analysis of all traversals of all <b>test</b> <b>routes</b> reflect the performance of the Driver Prediction algorithm. The error of average energy gained through charge-gaining events is 31. 3 % and the error of average net energy consumed is 27. 3 %. The average delta and average standard deviation of the delta of predicted energy gained through charge-gaining events is 0. 639 and 0. 601 Wh respectively for individual time-series calculations. Similarly, the average delta and average standard deviation of the delta of the predicted net energy consumed is 0. 567 and 0. 580 Wh respectively for individual time-series calculations. The average delta and standard deviation of the delta of the predicted speed is 1. 60 and 1. 15 respectively also for the individual time-series measurements. The percentage of accuracy of route prediction is 91 %. Overall, <b>test</b> <b>routes</b> are traversed 151 times for a total test distance of 276. 4 km...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAccessibility {{improvement}} for pedestrians {{has received}} increasing attention in planning. However, pedestrian space {{is more likely}} to be designed only for individual streets to secure minimum easiness of walking, and little attention has been paid to developing a street network for pedestrians to walk around multiple destinations on a neighbourhood scale. There is also a lack of empirical analysis of how much pedestrian accessibility would vary depending on the characteristics of streets on routes to specific destinations. This paper is aimed at examining the spatial relationship between pedestrian flows by street type and various street characteristics around multiple destinations in a city centre. First, a literature review summarises what street characteristics should be considered in accessibility analysis for pedestrians. Then, a pedestrian flow model is developed in a way that measures accessibility with street characteristics of origins, destinations, and routes on multi-scales from on-street ones to neighbourhood-scale ones. A multiple regression model is made using data from the West End area in London, in which street characteristics are taken for routes from each street segment to nearby stations and attractions. As a result, this analysis found that the <b>route</b> <b>characteristics</b> to a single nearest station and attraction can account for pedestrian flows well, but <b>route</b> <b>characteristics</b> to multiple nearby stations and attractions do not improve the model fit. These results are more prominent for pedestrianised streets. Their implication may be that these destinations are currently not linked well for pedestrians, and pedestrianisation is required to contribute more to the linkage...|$|R

The longitudinal and lateral accelerations are studied, and their relations with theories of motor optimality principles, such as minimum jerk, minimum variance, and the two-thirds power law are highlighted. Data have been collected during the final experimental phase of the EU interactIVe project, in which a vehicle developed by Centro Ricerche Fiat has been used to demonstrate driver continuous support produced by an artificial co-driver, within a shared initiative framework. 24 subjects drove the vehicle on a <b>test</b> <b>route</b> twice: once with the system active, the other with the system silent. The <b>test</b> <b>route</b> is composed of urban arterials, extra urban and motorway roads, and takes approximately 40 – 45  min to be driven. The total database thus amounts to ~ 35  h of driving data recordings, for a total of ~ 1.2  M samples per signal. Statistical summary data are presented, which describe human preferred accelerations, correlation between acceleration, curvature, and speed, and between longitudinal and lateral acceleration. Different driving modalities, corresponding to different motor strategies and primitives, are revealed. Comparisons with literature data are also made and discussed. The summary statistics may be useful for the design of future ADAS systems, and indeed they have been collected for the final tuning of the interactIVe co-driver.|$|R
