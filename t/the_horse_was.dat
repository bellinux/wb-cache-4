5|$|A {{study of}} isotope data of La Brea dire wolf fossils dated 10,000YBP {{provides}} evidence that <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> an important prey species at the time, and that sloth, mastodon, bison, and camel were less {{common in the}} dire wolf diet. This indicates that the dire wolf was not a prey specialist, and {{at the close of}} the late Pleistocene before its extinction it was hunting or scavenging the most available herbivores.|$|E
5|$|Domestication of {{the horse}} most likely took place in central Asia prior to 3500 BC. Two major sources of {{information}} are used to determine where and when <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> first domesticated and how the domesticated horse spread around the world. The first source is based on palaeological and archaeological discoveries; the second source is a comparison of DNA obtained from modern horses to that from bones and teeth of ancient horse remains.|$|E
5|$|Many {{different}} types and sizes of horse {{were used in}} war, depending on the form of warfare. The type used varied with whether <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> being ridden or driven, and whether they were being used for reconnaissance, cavalry charges, raiding, communication, or supply. Throughout history, mules and donkeys as well as horses {{played a crucial role}} in providing support to armies in the field.|$|E
5000|$|The {{process of}} {{training}} a guide <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> rigorous and takes about eight months for each <b>horse.</b> [...] Initially, <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> trained in basic lead work, in which <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> taught {{to move at}} the speed that the handler commands and to navigate common obstacles. Next, <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> trained in voice command recognition, and taught to respond to 23 voice commands. <b>The</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> then taught to maneuver around both stationary and moving obstacles. After this, <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> trained to signal to the handler {{when there is a}} step or ramp. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> housebroken, generally an easy process because of horses’ natural aversion to depositing fecal waste indoors. Intelligent disobedience is a crucial part of the training of <b>the</b> guide <b>horse,</b> as <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> must <b>be</b> able to disregard any commands that would <b>be</b> unsafe to <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> and <b>the</b> handler.|$|R
50|$|In 1952 <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> {{discovered}} on Takarajima by Shigeyuki Hayashida, {{a professor of}} Kagoshima University, and designated <b>the</b> Tokara <b>horse.</b> It <b>was</b> theorized that <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> brought to Takarajima from Kikaijima around 1900. In 1953, <b>the</b> Tokara <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> designated a natural monument of Kagoshima. When Professor Hayashida first discovered <b>the</b> <b>horses,</b> he counted 43. Their numbers gradually declined during the 1960s because of agricultural mechanization, however, and {{it was difficult to}} monitor the population on Takarajima. Therefore, some of <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> transferred to <b>the</b> Mt. Kaimon Natural Park and Iriki Farm, part of the agricultural department of Kagoshima University.|$|R
50|$|The tombs had {{all been}} robbed, but enough {{remained}} to determine that <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> all buried in an upright position. <b>The</b> <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> buried with all their trappings.|$|R
5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} from various {{sites on the}} Iberian peninsula suggest the domestication {{of plants and animals}} between 6,000 and 4,500 BC. Céide Fields in Ireland, consisting of extensive tracts of land enclosed by stone walls, date to 3,500 BC and are the oldest known field systems in the world. <b>The</b> <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> domesticated in the Pontic steppe around 4,000 BC. In Siberia, Cannabis was in use in China in Neolithic times and may have been domesticated there; it was in use both as a fibre for ropemaking and as a medicine in Ancient Egypt by about 2,350 BC.|$|E
5|$|Borislow's most {{successful}} horse was Toccet, who won four graded stakes, including the Champagne and Hollywood Futurity in 2002. Toccet's {{name is a}} misspelled tribute to former National Hockey League (NHL) player Rick Tocchet. <b>The</b> <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> named runner-up to Vindication for the American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt in 2002, {{a part of the}} Eclipse Award. Once a favorite to enter the 2003 Kentucky Derby, Toccet was derailed by ankle injuries early in the year. He won one listed stakes after his juvenile season out of 15 starts and now stands at Castleton Lyons.|$|E
5|$|By mid-morning, Ney {{had moved}} toward the front with Gazan's brigade {{and he could see}} the enemy {{advancing}} toward him; still expecting Soult's reinforcements on his flanks, he anticipated an easy victory, like the one three days earlier in which Masséna's force had pounded Hotze's column at Frauenfeld. He did not realise, at least not yet, that Hotze had 8,000men with which to secure the crossroads north of Winterthur. Ney brought more of his men to the front, and moved against the Austrian left. In an Austrian volley, he and his horse went down; <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> killed and Ney received a knee injury. He had his wound bandaged, called for another horse, and reentered the fight.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{the rider}} should use half-halts as <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> raising {{its head and}} neck upward (during the {{suspension}} phase), because this <b>is</b> when <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> engaging its hindquarters.|$|R

5|$|Horses were {{probably}} ridden in prehistory {{before they were}} driven. However, evidence is scant, mostly simple images of human figures on horse-like animals drawn on rock or clay. The earliest tools used to control horses were bridles of various sorts, which were invented nearly as soon as <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> domesticated. Evidence of bit wear appears on the teeth of horses excavated at the archaeology sites of the Botai culture in northern Kazakhstan, dated 35003000 BC.|$|E
5|$|On both fronts, <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> {{also used}} as a pack animal. Because railway lines could not {{withstand}} artillery bombardments, horses carried ammunition and supplies between the railheads and the rear trenches, though the horses generally were not used in the actual trench zone. This role of horses was critical, and thus horse fodder was the single largest commodity shipped to the front by some countries. Following the war, many cavalry regiments were converted to mechanised, armoured divisions, with light tanks developed to perform many of the cavalry's original roles.|$|E
5|$|Party Politics, {{who won the}} 1992 Grand National with partner Carl Llewellyn, {{was also}} pulled up after the water jump when in a good position. Since his Aintree victory the {{previous}} April he had run unimpressively in two chases without Llewellyn in the saddle before they were reunited to win the Greenhalls Gold Cup at Haydock in February. As defending champion, and with his jockey taking his fourth ride in a Grand National, <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> popular with the public who had backed him down to 7/1 favourite at the start.|$|E

5|$|The Kungas of pre-Akkadian Nagar {{were used}} for drawing the {{carriages}} of kings before the domestication of the horse, and a royal procession included up to fifty animals. The kungas of Nagar were in great demand in the Eblaite empire; they cost two kilos of silver, fifty times {{the price of a}} donkey, and were imported regularly by the monarchs of Ebla to be used as transport animals and gifts for allied cities. <b>The</b> <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> known in the region during the third millennium BC, but was not used as a draught animal before c. 18th century BC.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{archaeological evidence}} for the domestication of the horse comes from sites in Ukraine and Kazakhstan, dating to approximately 3500–4000 BC. By 3000 BC, <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> completely domesticated and by 2000 BC there was {{a sharp increase in}} the number of horse bones found in human settlements in northwestern Europe, indicating the spread of domesticated horses throughout the continent. The most recent, but most irrefutable evidence of domestication comes from sites where horse remains were interred with chariots in graves of the Sintashta and Petrovka cultures c. 2100 BC.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the Iron Age, {{there is}} much {{evidence}} for the use of horses in transport and battle, and for extensive trade between the inhabitants of Britain and other cultures. A collection of Iron Age artefacts from Polden Hill in Somerset includes a very large hoard of horse gear, and a rare, cast copper alloy cheekpiece dating from the late, pre-Roman Iron Age was found in St Ewe, Cornwall. <b>The</b> <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> an important figure in Bronze Age and Iron Age Celtic religion and myth, and is symbolised in the hill figure of the Uffington White Horse, near the Iron Age hill fort of Uffington Castle in Oxfordshire.|$|E
5|$|By mid-May it {{was clear}} that he would not make the Derby and he was removed from the race on the 23 May. Orme's trainer John Porter and Williams, the {{veterinary}} surgeon, remained convinced that he had been poisoned and was not just suffering from bad teeth. A reward of £1,000 was even offered for information that would lead to the conviction of the guilty party. The poisoning was investigated by George Lewis, a solicitor, who concluded that the horse had been poisoned. He stated that <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> fine on the morning of the 21 April, but a few hours later his tongue was so inflamed he could not hold it in his mouth; something so sudden, Lewis argued, could not have been caused by a decaying tooth. He suggested that the poison may have in fact been attempted to be administered by some ball being put down his throat, but due to the struggles of the horse, it burst in his mouth, blistering his tongue. The Derby was won by Sir Hugo, but many believed that Orme would have won easily had he made the race.|$|E
5|$|Dunn's second World Grand Champion was RPM, {{a son of}} Dark Spirit's Rebel. Dunn showed RPM to a Three-Year-Old World Championship in 1997. In 1998, RPM and Dunn won the Four-Year-Old World Championship {{and then}} placed second in the World Grand Championship; the latter {{achievement}} made them the Reserve World Grand Champions. Dunn had hopes of winning first the next year. In May 1999 <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> sold to L R & N Partners, LLC for $1.25 million. The new owners moved RPM to trainer Sammy Day's stable in Shelbyville, {{with the intention of}} entering him in the Celebration. Shortly before the Celebration, Day was convicted of bribing a judge, fined, and put on a five-year suspension. Dunn was given the task of riding RPM in the show, and won the World Grand Championship. Dunn was 81, again making him the oldest rider ever to win the class, breaking his earlier record. At the same show, Steve Dunn rode Out on Parole to a Two-Year-Old World Championship, and another Dunn-trained horse, Broken Promises, won the Four-Year-Old World Championship.|$|E
50|$|The {{pattern is}} not {{completely}} stable. <b>The</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> born another color (usually another leopard pattern), and the Varnish pattern gradually overtakes it by adulthood. After <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> mature, <b>the</b> coat color may lighten slightly when <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> has a long winter coat, and darken slightly in the summer when the winter coat sheds out. However, unlike the gray gene, the color does not get progressively lighter {{every year for the}} life of <b>the</b> <b>horse,</b> though it may look a bit different from year to year while <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> young.|$|R
50|$|Stringhalt is {{a sudden}} flexion {{of one or}} both hind legs in <b>the</b> <b>horse,</b> most easily seen while <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> walking or trotting. It is most evident when <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> backing up slowly, turning on the {{affected}} leg, or suddenly frightened. It can involve one or both hind legs of <b>the</b> <b>horse.</b> It <b>is</b> a spasmodic contraction of the lateral extensor tendons of the hind legs.|$|R
25|$|The longe line {{traveling}} from <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> to <b>the</b> hand <b>is</b> {{held in the}} hand in which direction <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> moving (so if <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> working clockwise to the right, the right hand is the leading hand). The extra longe line is folded, never coiled, in the other hand. If <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>were</b> to take off, a coiled line could tighten around the trainer's hand, dragging the trainer and possibly leading to life-threatening injuries. Large loops could be stepped on or caught on something.|$|R
5|$|In mid-2005, Salzgeber's then-current Grand Prix mount, Wall Street, was euthanized {{following}} {{an episode of}} colic. This, combined with the recent retirement of Rusty, left her with no Grand Prix-level horses. Wall Street, while a relatively successful dressage horse, had suffered health problems and {{had never been able}} to compete with Rusty as Salzgeber's top horse. In 2008, Salzgeber again began competing at the Grand Prix level on Herzruf's Erbe, who would develop into one of her top international horses. In that year, the pair won the Otto Lorke Prize, given each year to the best German Grand Prix horse under 10 years old. During 2008, Salzgeber and Herzruf's Erbe had won 10 Grand Prix competitions. In 2009, the pair were expected to compete at the European Dressage Championships, but were not chosen for the German team after Herzruf's Erbe sustained an injury at a competition in July. The immediate diagnosis was a severely pulled tendon, although a later diagnosis was that the horse had strained a suspensory muscle, expected to heal in about three months. By early 2010, <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> again able to be ridden, but was still not in top condition.|$|E
5|$|Maloney and Smythe's {{most famous}} horse Wonder Where, {{also led to}} {{the breakup of the}} partnership. Wonder Where, named by Maloney, was bred at Frank Selke's farm in Quebec and bought by Maloney and Smythe in 1957. In 1959, Wonder Where had an {{outstanding}} season, including winning the Canadian Oaks. <b>The</b> <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> voted Canadian Horse of the Year for the year and later, the filly was inducted in the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame. The Wonder Where Stakes was established in honour of the horse in 1965, becoming one of the Canadian Triple Tiara races for fillies in Canada in 1995. After the outstanding year in 1959, Maloney wanted to continue racing Wonder Where and Smythe did not, concerned over some tendon trouble. The horse broke down in a race in Fort Erie, and the partnership dissolved after that.|$|E
5|$|Terceira {{argued that}} she had a second horse, Chaka III, who should have been used in the injured Navantus' place, was {{regularly}} faster than Nisbett's Antille 8 and should have earned the qualification position. She also accused the Bermuda Equestrian Federation of making the decision based on political or racial motivations, which the organization denied. BEF president Mike Cherry explained that Chaka III did not qualify for the event until June 30, the final day, which is the reason why <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> not considered for Bermuda's Olympic slot. The BEF organized a final day of competition between Nisbett's Antille and Terceira's Chaka to give Terceira one last opportunity to qualify for an Olympic position. Nisbett, however, withdrew from the Olympic position later that June. Terceira took his place.|$|E
