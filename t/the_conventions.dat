5|$|Although van der Weyden did not {{adhere to}} <b>the</b> <b>conventions</b> of idealisation, he {{generally}} sought to flatter his sitters.

5|$|Angelou {{does not}} begin to create her own {{narrative}} until The Heart of a Woman, which depends less upon <b>the</b> <b>conventions</b> of fiction than her previous books.

5|$|The French Lieutenant's Woman is a 1969 postmodern {{historical}} fiction novel by John Fowles. It was his third published novel, after The Collector (1963) and The Magus (1965). The novel explores the fraught relationship of gentleman and amateur naturalist Charles Smithson and Sarah Woodruff, the former governess and independent woman {{with whom he}} falls in love. The novel builds on Fowles' authority in Victorian literature, both following and critiquing many of <b>the</b> <b>conventions</b> of period novels.|$|E
5|$|The Third of May {{references}} {{a number}} of earlier works of art, but its power comes from its bluntness rather than its adherence to traditional compositional formulas. Pictorial artifice {{gives way to the}} epic portrayal of unvarnished brutality. Even the contemporary Romantic painters—who were also intrigued with subjects of injustice, war, and death—composed their paintings with greater attention to <b>the</b> <b>conventions</b> of beauty, as is evident in Théodore Géricault's Raft of the Medusa (18181819) and Eugène Delacroix's 1830 painting Liberty Leading the People.|$|E
5|$|The entire setup of Troy McClure {{presenting}} the episode is {{a parody of}} the practice by live-action series to produce clip shows in general, by celebrating a completely arbitrary milestone and by making exaggerated use of <b>the</b> <b>conventions</b> of traditional highlights shows, such as a grand introduction and relentlessly showbizzy host.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> Constitutional <b>Convention</b> (also {{known as}} <b>the</b> Philadelphia <b>Convention,</b> <b>the</b> Federal <b>Convention,</b> or <b>the</b> Grand <b>Convention</b> at Philadelphia) took place from May 25 to September 17, 1787, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Although <b>the</b> <b>Convention</b> was {{intended}} to revise the Articles of Confederation, the intention from the outset of many of its proponents, chief among them James Madison and Alexander Hamilton, {{was to create a}} new government rather than fix the existing one. [...] The delegates elected George Washington to preside over <b>the</b> <b>Convention.</b> <b>The</b> result of <b>the</b> <b>Convention</b> was <b>the</b> creation of the United States Constitution, placing <b>the</b> <b>Convention</b> among <b>the</b> most significant events {{in the history of the}} United States.|$|R

5|$|Throughout {{the opera}} Monteverdi makes {{innovative}} use of polyphony, extending the rules beyond <b>the</b> <b>conventions</b> which composers normally observed in fidelity to Palestrina.

5|$|Boccaccio {{fills in}} the history before the hostage {{exchange}} as follows. Troilus mocks the lovelorn glances of other men who put their trust in women before falling victim to love himself when he sees Cressida, here a young widow, in the Palladium, the temple of Athena. Troilus keeps his love secret and is made miserable by it. Pandarus, Troilus' best friend and Cressida's cousin in {{this version of the}} story, acts as go-between after persuading Troilus to explain his distress. In accordance with <b>the</b> <b>conventions</b> of courtly love, Troilus' love remains secret from all except Pandarus, until Cassandra eventually divines the reason for Troilus' subsequent distress.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Convention</b> Organization Committee and <b>the</b> <b>convention</b> {{proceedings}} were co-chaired by Dominic LeBlanc and Tanya Kappo. Steven MacKinnon, the National Director of the party, was the General Secretary of <b>the</b> <b>convention.</b>|$|R
40|$|The Hague Peace Conferences of 1899 and 1907 {{marked the}} first {{significant}} attempts to codify the international law {{of war and the}} opening of the modern era of efforts toward international disarmament. The First Hague Conference (May 18 –July 29, 1899) adopted three conventions and three declarations: <b>the</b> <b>Convention</b> (I) for <b>the</b> Pacific Settlement of International Disputes, <b>the</b> <b>Convention</b> (II) with respect to the Laws and Customs of War on Land, and <b>the</b> <b>Convention</b> (III) for <b>the</b> Adaptation to Maritime Warfare of the Principles of <b>the</b> Geneva <b>Convention</b> of August 22, 1864; and the Declaration concerning Asphyxiating Gases, the Declaration concerning Expanding Bullets, and the Declaration to Prohibit for the Term of Five Years the Launching of Projectiles and Explosives from Balloons, and Other New Methods of a Similar Nature. The Second Hague Conference (July 15 –October 18, 1907) adopted 13 conventions and one declaration: <b>the</b> <b>Convention</b> (I) for <b>the</b> Pacific Settlement of International Disputes, <b>the</b> <b>Convention</b> (II) respecting <b>the</b> Limitation of the Employment of Force for the Recovery of Contract Debts, <b>the</b> <b>Convention</b> (III) relative to the Opening of Hostilities, <b>the</b> <b>Convention</b> (IV) respecting <b>the</b> Laws and Customs of War on Land, <b>the</b> <b>Convention</b> (V) respecting <b>the</b> Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land, <b>the</b> <b>Convention</b> (VI) relating to the Status of Enemy Merchant Ships at the Outbreak of Hostilities, <b>the</b> <b>Convention</b> (VII) relating to the Conversion of Merchant Ships into War-Ships, <b>the</b> <b>Convention</b> (VIII) relative to the Laying of Automatic Submarine Contact Mines, <b>the</b> <b>Convention</b> (IX) concerning Bombardment by Naval Forces in Time of War, <b>the</b> <b>Convention</b> (X) for <b>the</b> Adaptation to Maritime Warfare of the Principles of <b>the</b> Geneva <b>Convention,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Convention</b> (XI) relative to Certain Restrictions with Regard to the Exercise of the Right of Capture in Naval War, <b>the</b> <b>Convention</b> (XII) relative to the Creation of an International Prize Court, and <b>the</b> <b>Convention</b> (XIII) concerning <b>the</b> Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War; and the Declaration Prohibiting the Discharge of Projectiles and Explosives from Balloons.

50|$|The {{outcome of}} <b>the</b> <b>Convention</b> is that miner’s {{health and safety}} is upheld and {{monitored}} through various actions involving the mining workplace. The responsible parties would be the government and employer of the countries that ratified <b>the</b> <b>Convention.</b> <b>The</b> laws outlined in <b>the</b> <b>Convention</b> ensure <b>the</b> {{health and safety of}} miners.

5|$|By 1860, Smith {{was doing}} very well; {{he had moved}} to Leonard Street within the Fifth Ward and had a mansion built by white workmen. His total real {{property}} was worth $25,000. His household included a live-in servant, Catherine Grelis from Ireland. Listed as a separate household at his address were Sara D. Williams, 57, and Mary Hertell (should be Hewlitt, as above), 50. (These were likely the same Sara and Mary as in the 1850 census, although their ages did not change.) No one on this census page had a racial designation. By <b>the</b> <b>conventions</b> of the time, this means that they were classified as white by the census enumerator; totals of white persons only are given {{at the bottom of}} the page.|$|E
5|$|Dungeons & Dragons was {{the first}} modern {{role-playing}} game and it established many of <b>the</b> <b>conventions</b> that have dominated the genre. Particularly notable are the use of dice as a game mechanic, character record sheets, use of numerical attributes and gamemaster-centered group dynamics. Within months of Dungeons & Dragonss release, new role-playing game writers and publishers began releasing their own role-playing games, with most of these being in the fantasy genre. Some of the earliest other role-playing games inspired by D include Tunnels & Trolls (1975), Empire of the Petal Throne (1975), and Chivalry & Sorcery (1976).|$|E
5|$|Fighting {{games are}} {{a type of}} action game where two {{on-screen}} characters fight each other. These games typically feature special moves that are triggered using rapid sequences of carefully timed button presses and joystick movements. Games traditionally show fighters from a side-view, even as the genre has progressed from two-dimensional (2D) to three-dimensional (3D) graphics. Street Fighter II, though not the first fighting game, popularized and standardized <b>the</b> <b>conventions</b> of the genre, and similar games released prior to Street Fighter II have since been more explicitly classified as fighting games. Fighting games typically involve hand-to-hand combat, but may also feature melee weapons.|$|E
50|$|Under <b>the</b> <b>convention,</b> {{states may}} {{conclude}} different agreements between them that {{take precedence over}} <b>the</b> <b>convention.</b> Thus, within <b>the</b> European Union (except for Denmark) other rules are applied instead of <b>the</b> <b>Convention.</b>|$|R
50|$|In Article 19 of Part 5, {{the process}} of denouncing <b>the</b> <b>Convention</b> is laid out. Countries are allowed to {{denounce}} <b>the</b> <b>Convention</b> only under certain circumstances. The article states that a country may denounce <b>the</b> <b>Convention</b> if they wish, only ten years after <b>the</b> <b>Convention</b> first came into force (in 1998). Therefore, in 2008 {{it was possible for}} any ratifying countries to eliminate <b>the</b> <b>Convention</b> and subsequently drop their enforcement of its laws. This would result in a major loss of support for miner’s health and safety, and even basic rights. As a result, no countries have yet to denounce <b>the</b> <b>Convention.</b>|$|R
50|$|Upon the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, there were 22 parties to <b>the</b> <b>Convention.</b> <b>The</b> effect of <b>the</b> <b>Convention</b> was severely limited by the fact that Germany, Italy, and Japan‒states which waged extensive propaganda campaigns throughout the 1930s and World War II-were not parties to <b>the</b> <b>Convention.</b> Significantly, China, <b>the</b> United States, and the Soviet Union also chose to not ratify <b>the</b> <b>Convention,</b> <b>the</b> U.S. on First Amendment grounds.|$|R
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to imitate <b>the</b> <b>conventions</b> of silent cinema in its infancy, the staging and acting of the film are exaggerated and artificial. The {{equipment}} used by Acevedo had limitations, causing the indoor scenes to be underexposed and the outdoor scenes to be overexposed. The Pathé camera did not allow camera movement, had imprecise definition, and dark rendering. The Kodak Ektachrome lacked a large depth of field, producing a flat image, and required good lighting to operate effectively. Overhead shots are most commonly used, with some medium shots and {{a small number of}} large shots.|$|E
5|$|Josquin's {{earliest}} chansons {{were probably}} composed in northern Europe, {{under the influence}} of composers such as Ockeghem and Busnois. Unlike them, however, he never adhered strictly to <b>the</b> <b>conventions</b> of the formes fixes– the rigid and complex repetition patterns of the rondeau, virelai, and ballade– instead he often wrote his early chansons in strict imitation, a feature they shared with many of his sacred works. He {{was one of the first}} composers of chansons to make all voices equal parts of the texture; and many of his chansons contain points of imitation, in the manner of motets. However he did use melodic repetition, especially where the lines of text rhymed, and many of his chansons had a lighter texture, as well as a faster tempo, than his motets.|$|E
5|$|Religious {{paintings}} were commissioned for royal and ducal palaces, for churches, hospitals, and convents, and for wealthy clerics and private donors. The richer {{cities and towns}} commissioned works for their civic buildings. Artists often worked {{in more than one}} medium; van Eyck and Petrus Christus are both thought to have contributed to manuscripts. Van der Weyden designed tapestries, though few survive. The Netherlandish painters were responsible for many innovations, including the advancement of the diptych format, <b>the</b> <b>conventions</b> of donor portraits, new conventions for Marian portraits, and, through works such as van Eyck's Madonna of Chancellor Rolin and van der Weyden's Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin in the 1430s, laying the foundation for the development of landscape painting as a separate genre.|$|E
