Despite {{the growth}} of {{telemedicine}} as an area of research, few studies to date have applied an interactive audio/video technology to exercise. To date, no publications utilizing a formative assessment process to help determine the effectiveness of an exercise intervention conducted via videoconference. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} study was to develop an applicable formative assessment of resistance exercise conducted via videoconference using the Polycom <b>telenetworking</b> system. Seven college students were randomized into either a videoconferencing (VC) group (n= 4) or a home-based (HB) group (n= 3). Each group was participated in a three week, three day/week resistance exercise intervention utilizing resistive elastic bands. The VC group conducted all exercise sessions via the Polycom Viewstation with an instructor located at a separate location. The effectiveness of each treatment was assessed with a push-up test, isokinetic testing of the chest press movement, participant adherence and compliance to exercise, and overall acceptance of the technology. No differences in exercise adherence or compliance were noted between the groups. The VC group showed significant improvements in number of push-ups completed (1. 75 ± 0. 96) and peak torque during the chest press (12. 6 ± 7. 05 ft∙lbs; 16. 65 ± 9. 19 ft∙lbs), while pressing and pulling respectively, when compared to baseline. VC participants related high levels of acceptance for the use of videoconferencing with exercise. This study is the first to provide a foundational framework for the formative assessment of video technologies in exercise and provide evidence to support the use of videoconferencing technologies in larger and more complex exercise study designs...|$|E
