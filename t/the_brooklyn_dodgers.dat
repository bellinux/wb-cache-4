5|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} aspects of Landis's commissionership is the question of race. From 1884, black ballplayers were informally banned from organized baseball. No black ballplayer played in organized baseball during Landis's commissionership; Rickey (then running <b>the</b> <b>Brooklyn</b> <b>Dodgers)</b> broke the color line by signing Jackie Robinson to play for the minor league Montreal Royals in 1946, after Landis's death; Robinson became the first black in the major leagues since the 19th century, playing with the Dodgers beginning in 1947.|$|E

Mays considered Rhodes to be a [...] "fabulous hitter", as did Durocher, who wrote in his autobiography, [...] "[...] [...] boy could he hit!", while commenting on Rhodes' atrocious fielding abilities.|$|R

5|$|The {{entry of}} a new {{ownership}} group of <b>the</b> <b>Brooklyn</b> <b>Dodgers</b> in the offseason that included Branch Rickey affected the Browns' schedule in 1948. Rickey, an executive for baseball's Brooklyn Dodgers, convinced Brown to schedule a late-season road trip during which Cleveland would play three teams in eight days: the New York Yankees, the Los Angeles Dons and the San Francisco 49ers.
