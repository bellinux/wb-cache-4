40|$|Discussion on patient data, among {{hospital}} staff, {{plays an}} increasingly important role in inter-specialist communication. Effectiveness of a discussion depends, among other factors, on how well its participants perceive, assimilate and interpret information exchanged during a discussion. This paper reports a ?eld study conducted to assess information assimilation among medical observer participants during PCDs in a hospital. Medically trained observer participants undertook a questionnaire at multi-disciplinary medical team meetings (MDTMs) in <b>teleconference</b> and co-located settings. Results show that participants {{are more likely to}} offer opinions in <b>teleconference</b> while their expectations on the long-term effects of treatment are more realistic in co-located PCDs than in <b>teleconference</b> PCDs. Surprisingly, the presentation of clinical ?ndings, radiology and pathology is perceived to be clearer in <b>teleconference,</b> and respondents believe that they follow the discussion, know the patient management plan and understand the basis for decisions, better in <b>teleconference</b> than in co-located PCDs. While a higher educational value is attributed to <b>teleconference</b> PCDs, evidence suggests a trend to have more errors in <b>teleconference,</b> less critical evaluation and no expression of disagreement with patient management decisions made in <b>teleconference...</b>|$|R

These devices typically receive audio from CobraNet (and often from other digital or analog sources simultaneously), and process the audio using digital filters and effects (for example, volume control, EQ, compression, delay, crossovers, etc.) and then output the audio via CobraNet (or other digital or analog outputs). Some DSPs even have an integral telephone hybrid, and can incorporate CobraNet and other sources into a <b>teleconferencing</b> application.|$|E

Results indicate that intention was the strongest direct predictor of <b>teleconference</b> use.

Most teleconference-related beliefs differed between regions and organizational sectors. The relevance of specific attitudinal and normative beliefs to the overall attitude and perceived norm also differed between organizational sectors.

25|$|Telepharmacy is the {{delivery}} of pharmaceutical care via telecommunications to patients in locations where {{they may not have}} direct contact with a pharmacist.

Telepharmacy services include drug therapy monitoring, patient counseling, prior authorization and refill authorization for prescription drugs, and monitoring of formulary compliance with the aid of <b>teleconferencing</b> or videoconferencing. Remote dispensing of medications by automated packaging and labeling systems can also be thought of as an instance of telepharmacy.

The advantages are many; increased worker satisfaction, reduction {{of greenhouse gas}} emissions related to travel, and increased profit margins {{as a result of}} lower overhead costs for office space, heat, lighting, etc. The savings are significant; the average annual energy consumption for U.S. office buildings is over 23 kilowatt hours per square foot, with heat, air conditioning and lighting accounting for 70% of all energy consumed. Other related initiatives, such as Hoteling, reduce the square footage per employee as workers reserve space only when they need it. Many types of jobs, such as sales, consulting, and field service, integrate well with this technique.|$|E

25|$|A 2010 {{study of}} the various American states' rural health offices found that telepharmacy in rural medical {{facilities}} varied in prevalence across the United States but was still not widespread, and that many states had not yet clearly defined regulations for telepharmacy in hospitals. Adoption and implementation of telepharmacy methods has been slow compared {{to the spread of}} the basic technologies involved (internet access, audio/video compression algorithms, microphones and video cameras), despite periodic predictions of a forthcoming boom in the industry. Aside from more intangible factors (such as physicians' and pharmacists' personal uneasiness with the lack of physical interaction with patients), the major obstacles to telepharmacy implementation appear to have been the lack of clear legal regulations for telepharmacy, and the lack of network and software systems to manage (and secure) all of the data used in a professional pharmacy. As of 2010, many of the telepharmacy facilities in active operation were operating as pilot programs or under temporary waivers issued by state regulators because many states still had no clear legal framework for the regulation of remote pharmaceutical sites without pharmacists. Even in states that had regulated retail telepharmacy practices, regulations were often not in place to permit the implementation of telepharmacy in hospital settings. For some pharmacy facilities that might otherwise consider telepharmacy, the cost and complexity of the infrastructure needed to manage patient data across multiple sites can be prohibitive. In addition to the computer hardware required for patient data storage, distribution and <b>teleconferencing,</b> telepharmacy programs must deploy network security tools and procedures adequate to protect patient medical information in compliance with HIPAA and other patient privacy regulations. In 2010 the North Dakota Telepharmacy Project estimated that the computer hardware needed for a typical retail installation costs US$17,300 per site, with an additional cost of US$5,000 to buy a mobile cart for a hospital installation.|$|E
