5|$|By early 1944, Allied {{submarines}} were sinking {{large numbers}} of Japanese ships. Their activities were frequently guided by 'Ultra' intelligence relating to ship movements which was collected by intercepting and decrypting encoded radio transmissions. The IJN routinely broadcast the location and intended route of convoys under its protection, and decrypting <b>these</b> <b>messages</b> allowed Allied naval commanders to alert submarines {{in the vicinity of}} convoys. The submarine commanders were free to plan their interception and attack where conditions were most favorable.|$|E
5|$|Japanese radio {{intercepts}} did notice {{an increase}} in both American submarine activity and message traffic. This information was in Yamamoto's hands prior to the battle. Japanese plans, however, were not changed: Yamamoto, at sea in , assumed Nagumo had received the same signal from Tokyo, and did not communicate with him by radio, {{so as not to}} reveal his position. <b>These</b> <b>messages</b> were, contrary to earlier historical accounts, also received by Nagumo before the battle began. For reasons which remain unclear, Nagumo did not alter his plans or take additional precautions.|$|E
5|$|The Internet is a {{worldwide}} network {{of computers and}} computer networks that {{communicate with each other}} using the Internet Protocol. Any computer on the Internet has a unique IP address that can be used by other computers to route information to it. Hence, any computer on the Internet can send a message to any other computer using its IP address. <b>These</b> <b>messages</b> carry with them the originating computer's IP address allowing for two-way communication. The Internet is thus an exchange of messages between computers.|$|E

5|$|The {{resistance}} was alerted {{to carry out}} these tasks by messages personnels transmitted by the BBC's French service from London. Several hundred of <b>these</b> <b>messages,</b> which might be snatches of poetry, quotations from literature, or random sentences, were regularly transmitted, masking the few that were actually significant. In the weeks preceding the landings, lists of messages and their meanings were distributed to resistance groups. An increase in radio activity on 5 June was correctly interpreted by German intelligence to mean that an invasion was imminent or underway. However, because of the barrage of previous false warnings and misinformation, most units ignored the warning.|$|E
5|$|Using radio {{messages}} Manekshaw {{addressed the}} Pakistani troops three {{times on the}} subject of surrender, assuring them that they would receive honourable treatment from the Indian troops. They were broadcast on 9, 11 and 15 December. The last two messages were delivered as replies to the messages from Major General Rao Farman Ali and Lieutenant General Amir Abdullah Khan Niazi. <b>These</b> <b>messages</b> from the Pakistani commanders to their troops were to have a devastating effect on their side, subsequently leading to their defeat. They convinced the troops of the pointlessness of further resistance.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{repeated}} efforts, the French Navy {{failed to}} reinforce and resupply the garrison, as their ships were intercepted and defeated either in European waters {{or in the}} Caribbean itself. The British had intercepted a number of <b>these</b> <b>messages,</b> and launched a series of successful invasions during 1809, until Guadeloupe was the only French colony remaining. A British expeditionary force landed on 28 January 1810, and found {{that much of the}} island's militia garrison had deserted. Advancing from two landing beaches {{on opposite sides of the}} island, they were able to rapidly push inland. It was not until they reached Beaupère–St. Louis Ridge outside the capital Basse-Terre that the expeditionary force faced strong opposition, but in a battle lasting for most of 3 February, the French were defeated and driven back. The island's commander, Jean Augustin Ernouf, began surrender negotiations the following day.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "process school" [...] is {{concerned}} with communication; it highlights the channels and media through which messages are transmitted and by which senders and receivers encode and decode <b>these</b> <b>message.</b> The semiotic school treats a message as a construction of signs which through interaction with receivers, produces meaning; communication as an agent.|$|R
5|$|During 14April 1912, Titanics radio {{operators}} received six {{messages from}} other ships warning of drifting ice, which passengers on Titanic {{had begun to}} notice during the afternoon. The ice conditions in the North Atlantic were the worst for any April in the previous 50years (which was {{the reason why the}} lookouts were unaware that they were about to steam into a line of drifting ice several miles wide and many miles long). Not all of <b>these</b> <b>messages</b> were relayed by the radio operators. At the time, all wireless operators on ocean liners were employees of the Marconi's Wireless Telegraph Company and not members of their ship's crew; their primary responsibility was to send messages for the passengers, with weather reports as a secondary concern.|$|E
5|$|Having won the battle, Nelson {{needed to}} send despatches to his commander, Vice-Admiral Earl St. Vincent {{reporting}} on {{the destruction of the}} French Mediterranean fleet. <b>These</b> <b>messages</b> were entrusted to Captain Edward Berry, who had served as Nelson's flag captain on HMS Vanguard during the battle. Thompson was ordered to escort Berry to St. Vincent, believed to be with the blockade squadron off Cadiz, in Leander. Although Leander had not suffered serious damage in the battle, Thompson had manning problems: casualties from the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife in July 1797 had never been replaced, 14 men had been wounded in the battle at Aboukir Bay and two officers and fifty men had been detached to man the captured French prizes. This left Thompson with just 282 men on board Leander. Following Nelson's orders, Thompson sailed on 5 August.|$|E
5|$|On 21 November, the {{commander}} of the 9th Division, Major General Leslie Morshead, was informed by General Harold Alexander, {{the commander}}-in-chief of the Middle East Command, that a decision had been made to return the division to Australia. Churchill told the Australian Government on 2 December that while he was prepared to recommend to Roosevelt that the 9th Division be returned, the resultant diversion of shipping would reduce the size of the build-up of United States military forces in Britain and North Africa by 30,000 men. In the same cable, Churchill also stated that due to a shortage of shipping the 9th Division's heavy equipment would need to remain in the Middle East. On 3 December Roosevelt again wrote to Curtin to suggest that the 9th Division remain in the Middle East until the final defeat of the Axis forces in North Africa. Roosevelt also informed Curtin that the US Army's 25th Infantry Division would be transferred to Australia during December. Following <b>these</b> <b>messages</b> the Australian Government sought advice from Blamey and MacArthur on whether it was necessary for the 9th Division to return with its heavy equipment, and was informed that the necessary supplies could be sourced from American resources once the unit arrived in Australia.|$|E

5|$|The KIT gene encodes {{a protein}} called steel factor receptor, which is {{critical}} to the differentiation of stem cells into blood cells, sperm cells, and pigment cells. A process called alternative splicing, which uses the information encoded in the KIT gene to make slightly different proteins (isoforms) for use in different circumstances, may impact whether a mutation on KIT affects blood cells, sperm cells, or pigment cells. Steel factor receptor interacts chemically with steel factor or stem cell factor to relay chemical messages. <b>These</b> <b>messages</b> are used during embryonic development to signal the migration of early melanocytes (pigment cells) from the neural crest tissue to their eventual destinations in the dermal layer. The neural crest is a transient tissue in the embryo that lies along the dorsal line. Melanocytes migrate along the dorsal line to a number of specific sites: near the eye, near the ear, and the top of the head; six sites along each side of the body, and a few along the tail. At these sites, the cells undergo a few rounds of replication and differentiation, and then migrate down and around the body from the dorsal aspect towards the ventral aspect and the limb buds.|$|E
5|$|With {{the bulk}} of the French Navy {{confined}} to port, the British were able to strike directly at French colonies, although their reach was limited by the significant resources required in blockading the French coast and so the size and quality of operations varied widely. In 1804, Haiti fell to a nationalist uprising supported by the Royal Navy, and in 1806 British forces secured most of the northern coast of South America from its Dutch owners. In 1807 the Danish West Indies were invaded and in 1808 Spain changed sides and allied with Britain, while Cayenne fell to an improvised force under Captain James Lucas Yeo in January 1809. The damage done to the Martinique economy during this period was severe, as British frigates raided coastal towns and shipping, and merchant vessels were prevented from trading Martinique's produce with France or allied islands. Disaffection grew on the island, especially among the recently emancipated black majority, and during the summer of 1808 the island's governor, Vice-amiral Louis Thomas Villaret de Joyeuse, sent urgent messages back to France requesting supplies and reinforcements. Some of <b>these</b> <b>messages</b> were intercepted by British ships and the low morale on Martinique was {{brought to the attention of}} the Admiralty, who ordered their commander on the West Indian Station, Vice-Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane, to raise an expeditionary force from the ships and garrisons available to him and invade the island.|$|E
