5|$|Doctor Who is {{not unique}} in its losses, as many {{broadcasters}} regularly cleared their archives in this manner. Until the BBC changed its archiving policy in 1978, <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> of programming, in all genres, were deleted. Other affected BBC series include Dad's Army, Z-Cars, The Wednesday Play, Steptoe and Son, and Not Only... But Also. ITV regional franchises also deleted many programmes, including early videotaped episodes of The Avengers.|$|E
5|$|The dozen {{fans who}} worked on the project had been vetted by Mandelin and had prior {{localization}} experience. <b>Thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> were put into the project between hacking the game data and translating the 1,000 pages of scripted dialogue. They built their own tools for the work. The final version was released in October 2008 and issued as a patch. The patch was downloaded over 100,000 times in its first week. A fan-made, full-color, 200-page, professional-quality player's guide was released alongside the translation. The Verge cited the effort as proof of the fan base's dedication.|$|E

5|$|The mid- to late 1970s saw the {{introduction}} of what are usually referred to as red dot sights, a type that gives the user a simple bright red dot as an aiming point. The typical configuration for this sight is a compact curved mirror reflector design with a red light-emitting diode (LED) at its focus. Using an LED as a reticle is an innovation that greatly improves the reliability and general usefulness of the sight: {{there is no need}} for other optical elements to focus light behind a reticle; the mirror can use a dichroic coating to reflect just the red spectrum, passing through most other light; and the LED itself is solid state and consumes very little power, allowing battery-powered sights to run for hundreds and even tens of <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours.</b>|$|E

50|$|In March 2010, USEC began {{operating}} a new test cascade of commercial-ready AC100 centrifuge machines. USEC has been demonstrating AC100 cascade operations since then. USEC's prototype and AC100 centrifuge machines have accumulated hundreds <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> runtime since August 2007. Performance of the Lead Cascade {{has been confirmed}} {{under a variety of}} operating conditions with product assays consistent with industry standards for the production of commercial nuclear fuel for power reactors. The NRC licensed USEC to construct and operate the commercial American Centrifuge Plant at the Portsmouth site in April 2007, and construction began in May 2007. Construction was demobilized in August 2009 due to the delay in receiving a loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Energy. USEC currently awaits approval of this $2 billion loan guarantee before it can remobilize the construction, which will create nearly 8,000 jobs in the United States. Once completed, the commercial plant will use approximately 11,500 centrifuge machines to generate 3.8 million separative work units (SWU) a year.|$|R
25|$|Cathode {{depletion}} is {{the loss}} of emission after <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> of normal use. Sometimes emission can be restored for a time by raising heater voltage, either for a short time or a permanent increase of a few percent. Cathode depletion was uncommon in signal tubes but was a frequent cause of failure of monochrome television cathode-ray tubes. Usable life of this expensive component was sometimes extended by fitting a boost transformer to increase heater voltage.|$|E

25|$|Police {{reportedly}} spent <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> comparing DNA, {{dental records}} and fingerprints to many different missing person cases. Consequently, {{it was not}} until June 26, 1998 when her body was positively identified, through DNA and dental comparison over a year after her death. After viewing the television show, America's Most Wanted that aired in December 1998, which documented the case, Creek's father had notified police that he suspected that the body belonged to his daughter. When Creek had first vanished, she was not reported missing for five weeks, as her history of running away had prevented investigation. After the identification, laws in the state were changed to prevent an issue like this from happening again.|$|E
25|$|Announced in July 2015, {{the project}} is observing for <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> every year on two major radio {{telescope}}s, the Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia and the Parkes Observatory in Australia. Previously, only about 24 to 36 hours of telescope per year {{was used in the}} search for alien life. Furthermore, the Automated Planet Finder at Lick Observatory is searching for optical signals coming from laser transmissions. The massive data rates from the radio telescopes (24 GB/s at Green Bank) necessitated the construction of dedicated hardware at the telescopes to perform the bulk of the analysis. Some of the data are also analyzed by volunteers in the SETI@home distributed computing network. Founder of modern SETI Frank Drake is one of the scientists on the project's advisory committee.|$|E

5000|$|Metavid {{has been}} {{archiving}} since early 2006 and hosts over a <b>thousand</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> US House and Senate floor footage. Originally metavid hosted {{house and senate}} committees but they were taken down in response to legal threats by CSPAN. As of late 2007 C-SPAN has adopted a more liberal copyright policy. The Metavid archive hosts the largest free & reusable archive of house and senate legislative footage. Through a partnership with archive.org the original mpeg2s are made accessible through the metavid site. The US House launched its own video site and repository in 2010 and the Senate followed in 2011. [...] As these content sources became available, Metavid stopped archiving these chambers due to the labor-intensive process of separating proprietary C-SPAN content from public domain floor proceedings.|$|R

25|$|By {{election}} day, volunteers on {{both sides}} spent <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> getting their messages across to the state's 17.3 million registered voters. The campaigns for and against Proposition 8 raised $39.0 million ($11.3 million or 29.1% from outside California) and $44.1 million ($13.2 million or 30.0% from outside California), respectively, from over 64,000 people in all 50 states and more than 20 foreign countries, setting a new record nationally for a social policy initiative and more than for every other race {{in the country in}} spending except the presidential contest. Contributions were much greater than those of previous same-sex marriage initiatives. Between 2004 and 2006, 22 such measures were on ballots around the country, and donations to all of them combined totaled $31.4 million, according to the nonpartisan National Institute on Money in State Politics. A ProtectMarriage.com spokeswoman estimated that 36 companies which had previously contributed to Equality California were targeted to receive a letter requesting similar donations to ProtectMarriage.com.|$|E
25|$|Turbine {{engines in}} use on today’s turbine-powered {{aircraft}} are very reliable. Engines operate efficiently with regularly scheduled inspections and maintenance. These units can have lives ranging in the <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> of operation. However, engine malfunctions or failures occasionally occur that require an engine {{to be shut}} down in flight. Since multi-engine airplanes are designed to fly with one engine inoperative and flight crews are trained to fly with one engine inoperative, the in-flight shutdown of an engine typically does not constitute a serious safety of flight issue. Following an engine shutdown, a precautionary landing is usually performed with airport fire and rescue equipment positioned near the runway. Once the airplane lands, fire department personnel assist with inspecting the airplane to ensure it is safe before it taxis to its parking position. Turboprop-powered aircraft and turboshaft-powered helicopters are also powered by turbine engines and are subject to engine failures for many similar reasons as jet-powered aircraft. In the case of an engine failure in a helicopter, it is often possible for the pilot to enter autorotation, using the unpowered rotor to slow the aircraft's descent and provide a measure of control, usually allowing for a safe emergency landing even without engine power.|$|E
25|$|Tàijíquán's martial aspect {{relies on}} {{sensitivity}} to the opponent's movements and centre of gravity dictating appropriate responses. Effectively affecting the opponent's centre of gravity immediately upon contact, is trained as {{the primary goal of}} the martial t‘ai-chi ch‘üan student. The sensitivity needed to capture the centre is acquired over <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> of first yin (slow, repetitive, meditative, low-impact) and then later adding yang (realistic, active, fast, high-impact) martial training through taolu (forms), tuishou (pushing hands), and sanshou (sparring). Tàijíquán trains in three basic ranges: close, medium and long, and then everything in between. Pushes and open-hand strikes are more common than punches, and kicks are usually to the legs and lower torso, never higher than the hip, depending on style. The fingers, fists, palms, sides of the hands, wrists, forearms, elbows, shoulders, back, hips, knees, and feet are commonly used to strike, with strikes to the eyes, throat, heart, groin, and other acupressure points trained by advanced students. Chin na, which are joint traps, locks, and breaks are also used. Most tàijíquán teachers expect their students to thoroughly learn defensive or neutralizing skills first, and a student will have to demonstrate proficiency with them before offensive skills will be extensively trained.|$|E
