2500|$|<b>The</b> {{liquidity}} <b>premium</b> {{theory is}} {{an offshoot of}} the pure expectations theory. [...] <b>The</b> liquidity <b>premium</b> theory asserts that long-term interest rates not only reflect investors' assumptions about future interest rates but also include a premium for holding long-term bonds (investors prefer short term bonds to long term bonds), called <b>the</b> term <b>premium</b> or <b>the</b> liquidity <b>premium.</b> This premium compensates investors for the added risk of having their money tied up for a longer period, including the greater price uncertainty. Because of <b>the</b> term <b>premium,</b> long-term bond yields tend to be higher than short-term yields and the yield curve slopes upward. Long term yields are also higher not just because of <b>the</b> liquidity <b>premium,</b> but also because of <b>the</b> risk <b>premium</b> added by <b>the</b> risk of default from holding a security over the long term.

40|$|Many studies {{estimate}} {{risk premiums}} on federal funds futures to extract monetary policy expectations by assuming that average forecast errors of the expectations are zero or that survey forecasts are good proxies for the expectations. These assumptions, however, may fail {{due to an}} unanticipated declining trend in the federal funds rate and to survey respondents' strategic behavior. Consequently, <b>the</b> <b>premiums</b> estimated under these assumptions may be biased. We propose a new method to estimate <b>the</b> <b>premiums</b> and find that <b>the</b> <b>premiums</b> have been often negative since 2000, which is generally consistent with the negative betas observed in the 2000 s.

5|$|In 1983, Toyota {{chairman}} Eiji Toyoda {{issued a}} challenge to build the world's best car. The project, code-named F1 (“Flagship One”) developed the Lexus LS 400 to expand Toyota’s product line in <b>the</b> <b>premium</b> segment. The F1 project followed the Toyota Supra sports car and <b>the</b> <b>premium</b> Toyota Mark II models. Both the Supra and Mark II were rear-wheel drive cars with a powerful 7M-GE or 7M-GTE inline-six engine. The largest sedan Toyota built {{at the time was}} the limited-production, 1960s-vintage Toyota Century, a domestic, hand-built limousine, and V8-powered model, followed by the inline-six-engined Toyota Crown premium sedan. The Century was conservatively styled for the Japanese market and along with the Crown not slated for export after a restyle in 1982.

40|$|This {{empirical}} {{study examines}} {{the relation between}} <b>the</b> equity <b>premium</b> - <b>the</b> difference between the expected stock and risk-free return - and inflation in the major economies in the post-Bretton Woods era.

Regressions and impulse responses show that <b>the</b> equity <b>premium</b> significantly positively adjusts to inflation. Inflation is thus essential in explaining the level of <b>the</b> equity <b>premium</b> and provides a partial resolution to <b>the</b> equity <b>premium</b> puzzle. ...|$|R

5|$|The CSR {{subsidies}} {{are paid to}} insurance companies to reduce copayments and deductibles for a smaller group of ACA enrollees, those earning less than 250% of the federal poverty line (FPL). The second and larger type of subsidy, <b>the</b> <b>premium</b> tax credits designed to reduce the post-subsidy cost of monthly premiums, apply to all enrollees earning less than 400% of the FPL. For scale, during 2017, approximately $7 billion in CSR subsidies will be paid, versus $34 billion for <b>the</b> <b>premium</b> tax credits. A court decision meant that CSR subsidies were treated as discretionary spending, meaning Congress must decide to appropriate funds for them each year. This effectively gave the President the power to end them, as Democrats with a minority in Congress could not appropriate the funds, let alone override his veto of an appropriations bill.|$|E
50|$|The average (weighted) monthly <b>premium</b> paid by <b>the</b> {{beneficiary}} for PDPs was $35.09 in 2009, {{which is}} an increase from $29.89 in 2008.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{a stock market}} with ambiguity-averse informed investors under the CARA-normal setting, and studies the relationship between limited market participation and <b>the</b> equity <b>premium</b> which is decomposed into <b>the</b> risk <b>premium</b> and <b>the</b> ambiguity <b>premium.</b> In a rational expectations equilibrium, limited market participation arises if the largest deviation of investors' ambiguity increases sufficiently or if the variance of the stock return decreases sufficiently. In each case, a change in <b>the</b> risk <b>premium</b> and a change in <b>the</b> ambiguity <b>premium</b> may have opposite signs. This paper identifies conditions under which a change with the plus sign dominates and thus <b>the</b> equity <b>premium</b> increases when fewer investors participate in the stock market.

40|$|The present paper {{analyzes}} {{the challenge to}} redistribution programs posed {{by an increase in}} <b>the</b> skill <b>premium.</b> <b>The</b> skill <b>premium</b> affects both <b>the</b> profitability of education and the profitability of migration.

Our paper shows that the effect of an increase in <b>the</b> skill <b>premium</b> on redistributive programs depends on the initial level of <b>the</b> skill <b>premium.</b> Below a critical level, an increase in <b>the</b> skill <b>premium</b> is met by an increase in the tax rate. Beyond this level, however, a further rise in <b>the</b> skill <b>premium</b> leads to a fall in the tax rate, and hence a sharp increase in post-tax inequality...|$|R
