5|$|Duyệt's death {{opened the}} way for Minh Mạng to apply his {{policies}} in the south, as the viceroy's subordinates lacked the influence <b>to</b> <b>defy</b> the court. The emperor also tried to reduce Duyệt's followers’ political power by abolishing the post of viceroy and putting the south under his direct rule, thus making Duyệt the last holder of the post. Soon after Duyệt's death, Minh Mạng's new appointees arrived and took over the local administration. The new officials then launched an investigation and reported that Duyệt and his aides had engaged in corrupt and abusive practices.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Mandela inaugurated the Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture, and in 2003 the Mandela Rhodes Foundation {{was created}} at Rhodes House, University of Oxford, to provide {{postgraduate}} scholarships to African students.

He gave the closing address at the XIII International AIDS Conference in Durban in 2000, and in 2004, spoke at the XV International AIDS Conference in Bangkok, Thailand, calling for greater measures to tackle tuberculosis as well as HIV/AIDS. Mandela publicised AIDS {{as the cause of}} his son Makgatho's death in January 2005, <b>to</b> <b>defy</b> the stigma about discussing the disease.|$|E
5|$|In the Italian capital, Terlecki {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>defy</b> the establishment. The {{players were}} under strict instructions not {{to associate with}} the Vatican while in Rome, but Terlecki arranged for them to meet Pope John Paul II, who was himself Polish. Seeing this as a second act of defiance, the PZPN promptly sent Terlecki, Młynarczyk, Boniek and Żmuda home, escorted by General Marian Ryba of the Polish Army, who was also the football association president. Lech Poznań's Piotr Mowlik replaced Młynarczyk for the match against Malta, which Poland won 2–0.|$|E

5000|$|In the revamp period, Todd {{is portrayed}} as the [...] "rebel" [...] Robin. He smokes, swears, and fights authority. He is prone <b>to</b> <b>defying</b> Batman's orders, {{sometimes}} to success (bringing in the Scarecrow singlehandedly) and sometimes failure (botching a raid on a drug lab by jumping the gun too soon). Todd also aided Batman while Gotham City was temporarily overrun by Deacon Blackfire as shown in Batman: The Cult.|$|R

In their effort to match the album's narrative, Dream Theater wrote songs {{in a wide variety of}} styles ranging from mellow ballads to their more conventional progressive metal sound.|$|E
5|$|When 1925 arrived – {{five years}} after the ACLU was formed – the {{organization}} had virtually no success to show for its efforts. That changed in 1925, when the ACLU persuaded John T. Scopes <b>to</b> <b>defy</b> Tennessee's anti-evolution law in The State of Tennessee v. John Thomas Scopes. Clarence Darrow, a member of the ACLU National Committee, headed Scopes' legal team. The prosecution, led by William Jennings Bryan, contended that the Bible should be interpreted literally in teaching creationism in school. The ACLU lost the case and Scopes was fined $100. The Tennessee Supreme Court later upheld the law but overturned the conviction on a technicality.|$|E
5|$|While {{generally}} {{adhering to}} American conservatism, McCain established {{a reputation as}} a political maverick for his willingness <b>to</b> <b>defy</b> Republican orthodoxy on several issues. In reaction to his Keating Five experience, he made campaign finance reform one of his signature concerns. He was also a leader in normalizing diplomatic relations with Vietnam. His national visibility as a senator gave him the basis to begin a campaign for the 2000 Republican nomination for President of the United States.|$|E

5|$|Al-Azhar {{also served}} as a focal point for protests against the Ottoman {{occupation}} of Egypt, both from within the ulema and from among the general public. Student protests at al-Azhar were common, and shops {{in the vicinity of the}} mosque would often close out of solidarity with the students. The ulema was also on occasion able <b>to</b> <b>defy</b> the government. In one instance, in 1730–31, Ottoman aghas harassed the residents living near al-Azhar while pursuing three fugitives. The gates at al-Azhar were closed in protest and the Ottoman governor, fearing a larger uprising, ordered the aghas to refrain from going near al-Azhar. Another disturbance occurred in 1791 in which the wāli harassed the people near the al-Hussein Mosque, who then went to al-Azhar to demonstrate. The wāli was subsequently dismissed from his post.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{had left}} Canton, Simão de Andrade landed at Xiamen and Ningbo, {{establishing}} settlements there. Simão continued <b>to</b> <b>defy</b> local Chinese laws at Ningbo, and when his men were cheated on a trade deal with a Chinese man in 1545, Simão sent a band of armed men into the town, pillaged it, and took local women and young girls as their captives. The outraged locals banded together and slaughtered the Portuguese under Simão. A similar episode occurred later when Coelho de Sousa seized {{the house of a}} wealthy foreign resident in Jinzhou of Fujian, which led authorities to cut off supplies to the Portuguese; the Portuguese then attacked and ransacked a nearby village for supplies, which prompted Chinese authorities to destroy thirteen of their ships while thirty Portuguese survivors of this settlement fled to the Portuguese settlement at Macau in 1549.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>defy</b> the Senate by next appointing Wheeler Hazard Peckham another New York {{attorney who}} had opposed Hill's machine in that state. Hill used {{all of his}} influence to block Peckham's confirmation, and on February 16, 1894, the Senate rejected the nomination {{by a vote of}} 32 to 41. Reformers urged Cleveland to continue the fight against Hill and to nominate Frederic R. Coudert, but Cleveland acquiesced in an inoffensive choice, that of Senator Edward Douglass White of Louisiana, whose nomination was accepted unanimously. Later, in 1896, another vacancy on the Court led Cleveland to consider Hornblower again, but he declined to be nominated. Instead, Cleveland nominated Rufus Wheeler Peckham, the brother of Wheeler Hazard Peckham, and the Senate confirmed the second Peckham easily.|$|E

She felt that the girls were devoting to much energy <b>to</b> <b>defying</b> school uniform requirements, as it was they redirected their energy and their parents money to appearing in fashionable clothes.|$|R

5|$|Henry VI {{proved to}} be a weak king and {{vulnerable}} to the over-mighty subjects who developed private armies of retainers. Rivalries often spilled over from the courtroom into armed confrontations, such as the Percy–Neville feud. Without the common purpose of the war in France, Henry's cousin Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York, and Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, used their networks <b>to</b> <b>defy</b> the crown. Henry became the focus of discontent as the population, agricultural production, prices, the wool trade and credit declined in the Great Slump. This led to radical demands from the lower classes. In 1450, Jack Cade raised a rebellion to force Henry to address the economic problems or abdicate his throne. The uprising was suppressed but conflict remained between villagers, gentry and aristocracy. Society remained deeply unsettled and radical demands continued to be suppressed such as those from the yeoman brothers John and William Merfold.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, the Transvaal {{government}} promulgated a new Act compelling {{registration of}} the colony's Indian and Chinese populations. At a mass protest meeting held in Johannesburg on 11 September that year, Gandhi adopted his still evolving methodology of Satyagraha (devotion to the truth), or nonviolent protest, {{for the first}} time. The idea of nonviolence was ultimately bolstered when Gandhi {{was inspired by a}} letter written to Tarak Nath Das by the Russian pacifist Leo Tolstoy on 14 December 1908, which introduced Gandhi to the ancient Indian moral literature of the Tirukkural. He urged Indians <b>to</b> <b>defy</b> the new law and to suffer the punishments for doing so. Gandhi's ideas of protests, persuasion skills and public relations had emerged. He took these back to India in 1915.|$|E
5|$|Overnight, {{thousands}} of protesters continued <b>to</b> <b>defy</b> the curfew and, {{as the night}} progressed, troops and armoured vehicles deployed across Cairo to guard key places such as train stations, major government buildings and banks. The army had insufficient capacity to patrol neighbourhoods, so residents set up armed vigilante groups to drive off looters and robbers. A heavy army presence (though no police) was reported in Suez. Chaos was rampant in Suez during the night, but as day broke the streets remained relatively quiet. As in Cairo, many residents formed vigilante groups to protect their homes and businesses {{in the absence of}} police. The military set up numerous checkpoints throughout the city. An estimation of about 30 bodies including the bodies of two children were taken to El Demerdash Hospital in central Cairo.|$|E
50|$|Kathoeys {{began to}} gain {{prominence}} in the cinema of Thailand during the late 1980s. The depiction at first was negative by showing kathoeys suffering from bad karma, suicide, and abandoned by straight lovers. Independent and experimental films contributed <b>to</b> <b>defying</b> sexual norms in queer cinema in the 1990s. In 2000 the film The Iron Ladies, directed by Yongyoot Thongkongtoon, depicted a positive portrayal of an almost entirely kathoey volleyball team by displaying their confidence. The rising middle-class in Bangkok and vernacular queer culture made the mainstream portrayal of kathoeys more popular {{on television and in}} art-house cinema.|$|R

5|$|The Ottoman Empire used impalement during, and before, {{the last}} siege of Constantinople in 1453. For example, during the buildup phase {{to the great}} siege the year before, in 1452, the sultan {{declared}} that all ships sailing up or down through the Bosphorus had to anchor at his fortress there, for inspection. One Venetian captain, Antonio Rizzo, sought <b>to</b> <b>defy</b> the ban, but his ship {{was hit by a}} cannonball. He and his crew were picked up from the waters, the crew members to be beheaded (or sawn asunder according to Niccolò Barbaro), whereas Rizzo was impaled. In {{the early days of the}} siege in May 1453, contingents of the Ottoman army made mop-up operations at minor fortifications like Therapia and Studium. The surrendered soldiers, some 40 individuals from each place, were impaled.|$|E
5|$|The True Directions {{kids are}} {{encouraged}} to rebel against Mary by two of her former students, ex-ex-gays Larry and Lloyd (Richard Moll and Wesley Mann), who take the campers to a local gay bar where Graham and Megan's relationship develops into a romance.

Megan and Graham sneak away one night to have sex and begin to fall in love. When Mary finds out, Megan, now at ease with her sexual identity, is unrepentant. She is made to leave True Directions and, now homeless, goes to stay with Larry and Lloyd. Graham, afraid <b>to</b> <b>defy</b> her father, remains at the camp. Megan and Dolph, who is also living with Larry and Lloyd, plan to win back Graham and Clayton.|$|E
5|$|The diverse {{elements}} of the film have led it <b>to</b> <b>defy</b> efforts at genre classification, with the work being variously {{referred to as a}} film noir, a horror film, a Künstlerroman, and a buddy film. It contains various literary allusions and religious overtones, as well as references to many real-life people and events – most notably the writers Clifford Odets and William Faulkner, of whom the characters of Barton Fink and W. P. Mayhew are often seen as fictional representations. Several features of the film's narrative, particularly an image of a woman at the beach which recurs throughout, have sparked much commentary, with the Coens acknowledging some intentional symbolic elements while denying an attempt to communicate any single message in the film. Despite disagreement over certain details of the work, Barton Fink continues to be positively received, with screenwriter Charlie Kaufman among its admirers.|$|E
