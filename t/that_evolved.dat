5|$|Many {{authors have}} speculated that {{at the core of}} this {{symbolic}} explosion, and in tandem, was the development of syntactic language <b>that</b> <b>evolved</b> through a highly specialized social learning system providing the means for semantically unbounded discourse.

5|$|A {{special case}} of natural {{selection}} is sexual selection, which is selection for any trait that increases mating success by increasing the attractiveness of an organism to potential mates. Traits <b>that</b> <b>evolved</b> through sexual selection are particularly prominent among males of several animal species. Although sexually favoured, traits such as cumbersome antlers, mating calls, large body size and bright colours often attract predation, which compromises the survival of individual males. This survival disadvantage is balanced by higher reproductive success in males that show these hard-to-fake, sexually selected traits.|$|E
5|$|Ammianus {{is silent}} about archers on the Alamanni side. The Germans almost {{certainly}} did not have mounted archers, as this was an arm <b>that</b> <b>evolved</b> in the East and in any case, their longbows are unsuitable for use on horseback. As for the infantry, the archery capability of the Rhine Germans has traditionally been seen as negligible, due to the 6th-century writer Agathias's comment that the Franks {{did not know how}} to use bows. But this is contradicted by the archaeological record and by Ammianus himself in other parts of his account. It is virtually certain that there were a significant number of Alamanni foot archers at Strasbourg.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1970s, disco, a form {{of dance}} music, was {{becoming}} popular, evolving from underground dance clubs to mainstream America. Disco reached its zenith following the release of Saturday Night Fever and the phenomenon surrounding the movie and the soundtrack by The Bee Gees. Disco's time was short, however, and by 1980 was soon replaced {{with a number of}} genres <b>that</b> <b>evolved</b> out of the punk rock scene, like new wave. Bruce Springsteen became a major star, first in the mid to late 1970s and then throughout the 1980s, with dense, inscrutable lyrics and anthemic songs that resonated with the middle and lower classes.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a genetic algorithm <b>that</b> <b>evolves</b> a fourpart musical composition–melodically, harmonically, and rhythmically. Unlike similar attempts in the literature, our composition evolves {{from a single}} musical chord without human intervention or initial musical material. The mutation rules and fitness evaluation are based on common rules from music theory. The genetic operators and individual mutation rules are selected from probability distributions <b>that</b> <b>evolve</b> alongside the musical material...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} the intergenerational transfer of human communication systems. It tests if human communication systems evolve {{to be easy}} to learn or easy to use (or both), and how population size affects learnability and usability. Using an experimental-semiotic task, we find that human communication systems evolve to be easier to use (production efficiency and reproduction fidelity), but harder to learn (identification accuracy) for a second generation of naïve participants. Thus, usability trumps learnability. In addition, the communication systems <b>that</b> <b>evolve</b> in larger populations exhibit distinct advantages over those <b>that</b> <b>evolve</b> in smaller populations: the learnability loss (from the Initial signs) is more muted and the usability benefits are more pronounced. The usability benefits for human communication systems <b>that</b> <b>evolve</b> in a small and large population is explained through guided variation reducing sign complexity. The enhanced performance of the communication systems <b>that</b> <b>evolve</b> in larger populations is explained by the operation of a content bias acting on the larger pool of competing signs. The content bias selects for information-efficient iconic signs that aid learnability and enhance usability...|$|R

5|$|Carnotaurus {{is one of}} the best-understood genera of the Abelisauridae, {{a family}} of large theropods {{restricted}} to the ancient southern supercontinent Gondwana. Abelisaurids were the dominant predators in the Late Cretaceous of Gondwana, replacing the carcharodontosaurids and occupying the ecological niche filled by the tyrannosaurids in the northern continents. Several notable traits <b>that</b> <b>evolved</b> within this family, including shortening of the skull and arms as well as peculiarities in the cervical and caudal vertebrae, were more pronounced in Carnotaurus than in any other abelisaurid.|$|E

The post-war Yugoslav Navy drew its insignia and traditions from the Partisan naval forces <b>that</b> <b>evolved</b> from armed fishing vessels operated along the Adriatic coast from late 1942, so few of the traditions of the KJRM were carried over to the post-war navy.|$|E
