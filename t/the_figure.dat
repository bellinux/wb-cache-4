5|$|Other folklore, first {{recorded}} in the Victorian era, associates <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> with fertility.

5|$|As {{shown in}} <b>the</b> <b>figure,</b> and as {{originally}} described by , Rule 184 {{may be used}} to model deposition of particles onto a surface. In this model, one has a set of particles that occupy a subset of the positions in a square lattice oriented diagonally (the darker particles in <b>the</b> <b>figure).</b> If a particle is present at some position of the lattice, the lattice positions below and to the right, and below and {{to the left of the}} particle must also be filled, so the filled part of the lattice extends infinitely downward to the left and right. The boundary between filled and unfilled positions (the thin black line in <b>the</b> <b>figure)</b> is interpreted as modeling a surface, onto which more particles may be deposited. At each time step, the surface grows by the deposition of new particles in each local minimum of the surface; that is, at each position where it is possible to add one new particle that has existing particles below it on both sides (the lighter particles in <b>the</b> <b>figure).</b>|$|E
5|$|At least 31mass graves were {{discovered}} in Kragujevac and its surroundings after the war. In 1969, the historian Jozo Tomasevich wrote that, despite German official sources stating 2,300hostages had been shot, both the Partisans and Chetniks had agreed {{that the number of}} victims was about 7,000. He further stated that careful investigation by a Yugoslav university professor in 1967 had put <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> at about 5,000.

5|$|The {{electron}} of the hydrogen-like ununennium atom—oxidized so it {{has only}} one electron, Uue118+—is predicted to move so quickly that its mass is 1.99 times that of a non-moving electron, a feature coming from the relativistic effects.

In this study, the perceived width of various figures (horizontal line segments, ellipses, faces, symbolic faces, and artistic pictures) on a slanted picture plane was measured. The width of <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> was magnified or reduced in order to vary the naturalness of <b>the</b> original <b>figures.</b> <b>The</b> perceived width was found to be much closer to the width of <b>the</b> original <b>figures</b> than to <b>the</b> retinal images of <b>the</b> slanted <b>figures.</b> <b>The</b> width of <b>the</b> original <b>figures</b> was also found to affect the perceived width of the slanted figures; the perceived width was observed to be more biased toward a more natural width. On the other hand, the naturalness of <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> did not affect the perceived slant.
