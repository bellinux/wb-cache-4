These silkworms live in the wild forest in trees belonging to Terminalia species and Shorea robusta {{as well as other}} food plants like jamun and oak found in South Asia, eating the leaves of the trees they live on. Tussar silk is valued for its rich texture and natural deep gold colour, and varieties are produced in many countries, including China, India, Japan, and Sri Lanka.|$|E
