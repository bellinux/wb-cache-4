50|$|Magic Journeys {{looked at}} {{the world through the}} eyes of a child. The film started with {{children}} running through a meadow and looking at clouds.

When he <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> a worm to wiggle his way off the island, they would <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> chickens and peck at him. He finally managed to escape by <b>turning</b> <b>into</b> a flea and attaching himself to a sack of Gesho leaves destined for sale on the mainland! Perhaps the notion of Täwanäy as the disciple of Däqä Est’ifa stems from his legendary exploits at Däq Island.|$|R
