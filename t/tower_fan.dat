However, the power consumption of the air-conditioning equipment is considerably high, accounting for 40 ~ 50 % of the total building electricity consumption. The air-conditioning equipment includes chiller, pump, fan, cooling <b>tower</b> <b>fan</b> motor; therefore, how to reduce energy consumption and improve energy utilization {{will be a very}} important topic. This study used the sensors on the site to collect historical data of load change for analysis and conducted simulation and verification using the artificial neural recurrent network and MATLAB. The frequency of cooling <b>tower</b> <b>fan</b> was set as the output parameter and two groups of modules were established to effectively predict the frequency of cooling <b>tower</b> <b>fan</b> by rainfall to optimize the cooling water fan rotational frequency, in order to reduce power consumption of the cooling tower in different environmental conditions for energy saving...|$|E
