50|$|Commandry (British English), or commandery (American English), was the {{smallest}} {{division of the}} European landed estate or manor {{under the control of}} a commander of a military order. The word is also applied <b>to</b> the <b>emoluments</b> <b>granted</b> <b>to</b> a commander in an order of knights. They were the equivalent for those orders to a monastic grange.|$|R

40|$|Being {{a credit}} active {{consumer}} in South Africa {{requires a lot}} of responsibility. Credit providers offer loans to debtors and often employ unjust methods in an attempt to recover the outstanding debt. The mechanism applicable in this research, which credit providers use to recover the debt, is in fact the emoluments attachment order. It is my finding that legislation needs to be amended to abolish the abuse in the sense that: - The order must be obtained in a court where the debtor resides or works. - The court should have a discretion <b>to</b> <b>grant</b> the <b>emoluments</b> attachment order. It will make provision for judicial oversight and that the order be queried at the application stage of such an order, and not only once the order has already been granted. - A cap should be placed upon the amount deductible, which will ensure that the number of emoluments attachment orders against the debtor s salary is appropriate {{to the extent that the}} debtor will still have sufficient means to maintain himself and the dependants. The implication of these amendments would ensure that the abuse of the process of emoluments attachment orders are abolished. It is also important to note that debtors still need to act in a responsible manner. These amendments would also ensure that creditors are protected to the extent that they follow the correct procedures in order to collect the debt owed to them. It is my submission that amendments by the legislature is the only way to ensure that the abuse is curbed and to establish a balance between the rights of the creditor and the rights of the debtor.

5000|$|The new clerk had [...] "his {{fortunes}} to make", and, {{though not}} a spiritual person, he 'greedily affected a certain good prebend of St. Paul's', which, doubtless at his instigation, the council on 23 June 1550 agreed to settle on him. Ridley, who had intended this preferment for his chaplain Grindal, stigmatised Thomas as [...] "an ungodly man", and resisted the grant, but without success; for when the prebend fell vacant, it was conveyed to the king, [...] "for the furnishing of his stables", and its <b>emoluments</b> <b>granted</b> <b>to</b> Thomas. This [...] "unreasonable piece of covetousness" [...] was, in John Strype's opinion, [...] "the greatest blur sticking upon" [...] Thomas's character.|$|R
