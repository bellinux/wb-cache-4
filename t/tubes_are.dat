5|$|The basidia (spore-bearing cells) of T.tabacinus are {{club-shaped}} {{and measure}} 23.5–37.0 by 8.5–13.0μm. The pleurocystidia (cystidia {{found on the}} inner surface of the <b>tubes)</b> <b>are</b> 45.0–60.0 by 6.5–12.5μm, lanceolate (lance-shaped) to narrowly fusoid-ventricose (enlarged {{in the middle and}} somewhat spindle-shaped). Cheilocystidia (cystidia on the outer edges of the <b>tubes)</b> <b>are</b> absent. The caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) form the reticulations on the stem; they are usually club-shaped and measure 21.0–40.5 by 6.5–10.5μm.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to cuffed or uncuffed, preformed endotracheal <b>tubes</b> <b>are</b> also available. The oral and nasal RAE tubes (named after the inventors Ring, Adair and Elwyn) {{are the most}} widely used of the preformed tubes.|$|E
5|$|Chest <b>tubes</b> <b>are</b> used {{first-line}} when pneumothorax {{occurs in}} people with AIDS, usually due to underlying pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), as this condition is associated with prolonged air leakage. Bilateral pneumothorax (pneumothorax on both sides) is relatively common {{in people with}} pneumocystis pneumonia, and surgery is often required.|$|E
500|$|The {{ships were}} also {{equipped}} with four [...] torpedo <b>tubes.</b> One <b>tube</b> <b>was</b> {{mounted in the}} stern in an above-water swivel mount, two were placed laterally, also above water, and the fourth was in the bow. The torpedo <b>tubes</b> <b>were</b> supplied {{with a total of}} 10 torpedoes. After the refit, the stern and lateral <b>tubes</b> <b>were</b> replaced with [...] weapons, but the lateral torpedo <b>tubes</b> <b>were</b> submerged. They had 8 torpedoes between them. The bow <b>tube</b> <b>was</b> retained, but also moved below the waterline; it had three torpedoes.|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} world <b>tube</b> <b>is</b> {{particularly}} relevant for special relativity, where a world <b>tube</b> <b>is</b> embedded in Minkowski space.|$|R
5000|$|The head <b>tube</b> <b>is</b> {{the part}} of a cycle's tubular frame within which the front fork steer <b>tube</b> <b>is</b> mounted. [...] On a motorcycle, the [...] "head tube" [...] is {{normally}} called the steering head. On bicycles the manufacturer's brand located on the head <b>tube</b> <b>is</b> known as a head badge.|$|R
5|$|Raman {{spectroscopy}} {{has good}} spatial resolution (~0.5 micrometers) and sensitivity (single nanotubes); it requires only minimal sample preparation and is rather informative. Consequently, Raman spectroscopy {{is probably the}} most popular technique of carbon nanotube characterization. Raman scattering in SWCNTs is resonant, i.e., only those <b>tubes</b> <b>are</b> probed which have one of the bandgaps equal to the exciting laser energy. Several scattering modes dominate the SWCNT spectrum, as discussed below.|$|E
5|$|Surgical implants, {{either of}} {{flexible}} rods or inflatable <b>tubes,</b> <b>are</b> reserved for when other methods fail {{because of the}} potential for serious complications, which occur in as many as 10% of cases. They carry the risk of eroding penile tissue (breaking through the skin). Although satisfaction among men who use them is high, if they do need to be removed implants make other methods such as injections and vacuum devices unusable due to tissue damage.|$|E
5|$|The caves {{are open}} to {{visitors}} but flashlights are needed except in Indian Tunnel and some form of head protection is highly recommended when exploring any of the caves. Lava <b>tubes</b> <b>are</b> created when the sides and surface of a lava flow hardens. If the fluid interior flows away a cave is left behind. Entering caves requires a free permit.|$|E
50|$|The {{magic eye}} <b>tube</b> <b>was</b> also {{used on the}} cover of My Morning Jacket's 2011 album Circuital. The <b>tube</b> <b>was</b> shown as being almost fully lit.|$|R
5000|$|PEG tubes with rigid, fixed [...] "bumpers" [...] {{are removed}} endoscopically. The PEG <b>tube</b> <b>is</b> {{pushed into the}} stomach so {{that part of the}} <b>tube</b> <b>is</b> visible behind the bumper. An {{endoscopy}} snare is then passed through the endoscope, and passed over the bumper so that the tube adjacent to the bumper is grasped. The external part of the <b>tube</b> <b>is</b> then cut, and the <b>tube</b> <b>is</b> withdrawn into the stomach, and then pulled up into the esophagus and removed through the mouth. The PEG site heals without intervention.|$|R
25|$|The <b>tube</b> <b>was</b> {{relatively}} {{immune to}} vibration, and thus vastly superior on shipboard duty, particularly for navy ships with {{the shock of}} weapon fire commonly knocking the sensitive but delicate galena off its sensitive point (the <b>tube</b> <b>was</b> in general no more sensitive as a radio detector, but was adjustment free). The diode <b>tube</b> <b>was</b> a reliable alternative for detecting radio signals.|$|R
5|$|The {{sea onion}} Paranthus rapiformis lives on subtidal mud flats and burrows into the sediment, holding itself {{in place by}} {{expanding}} its basal disc to form an anchor. If it gets washed out of its burrow by strong currents, it contracts into a pearly glistening ball which rolls about. Tube-dwelling anemones which live in parchment-like <b>tubes,</b> <b>are</b> in the anthozoan subclass Ceriantharia, and are only distantly related to sea anemones.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is olive to olive-brown. The smooth spores are {{somewhat}} oblong to slightly ventricose (fattened in the middle), and measure 10–14 by 4–5µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored and measure 25–35 by 8–10µm. Pleurocystidia (cystidia {{found on the}} faces of the <b>tubes)</b> <b>are</b> fuse-shaped and ventricose, with dimensions of 50–60 by 10–14µm.|$|E
5|$|Needle {{receiving}} tubes: A hollow tube made of metal, shatter-resistant {{glass or}} plastic, needle receiving tubes, like forceps, {{are used to}} support the tissue at the piercing site and are common in septum and some cartilage piercings. Not only are these tubes intended to support the tissue, but they also receive the needle once it has passed through the tissue, offering protection from the sharp point. Needle receiving <b>tubes</b> <b>are</b> not used in the freehand piercing method.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} ensure {{consistent}} surface state after each test, the boiling surface was prepared in the same manner, i.e., the stainless steel <b>tube</b> <b>was</b> finished with emery paper 400 and copper <b>tube</b> <b>was</b> polished with abrasive compound, next the test <b>tube</b> <b>was</b> placed in an ultrasonic cleaner for 1 h. Finally, the boiling surface was cleaned by water jet.|$|R

5000|$|... since draft <b>tube</b> <b>is</b> a {{diffuser}} V3 {{is always}} less than V2 which implies p2 is always negativethus {{height of the}} draft <b>tube</b> <b>is</b> an important parameter to avoid cavitation.|$|R
5|$|One {{method is}} to use the ground as a heat sink by drawing air through {{underground}} pipes. This is often done to provide a source of cool air for a building by means of a ground-coupled heat exchanger (also known as Earth tubes), wherein condensation is typically regarded as a significant problem. A major problem with such designs is that the underground <b>tubes</b> <b>are</b> subject to contamination and difficult to keep clean. Designs of this type require air to be drawn through the pipes by a fan, but the power required may be provided (or supplemented) by a wind turbine.|$|E
5|$|The cap is chestnut, rusty, olive brown, or {{dark brown}} {{in color and}} {{generally}} 4–10cm (rarely to 13cm) in diameter at maturity. The cap has a distinctive conical shape, later flattening out. It is slimy to the touch, bare, smooth, and glossy even when dry, and the cuticle is easily peeled off. The tiny, circular pores of the <b>tubes</b> <b>are</b> initially yellow but turn olive to dark yellow with maturity. Like {{the skin of the}} cap, they can be readily peeled away from the flesh.|$|E
5|$|The {{color of}} the spore print is pale yellow. Spores are ellipsoid, smooth, hyaline (translucent), and have {{dimensions}} of 8–10 by 5–6µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club shaped, two- to four-spored, and measure 24–30 by 8–10µm. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the inner walls of the <b>tubes)</b> <b>are</b> light yellow brown in color, club shaped, infrequent, and measure 25–38 by 7.2µm; the cheilocystidia (found on the tube edge) are colorless, numerous, and measure 32–47 by 7–10µm. Clamp connections {{are present in the}} hyphae.|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} low service life problem of pump tubes in oil {{production}} actual condition is considered. External environment of <b>tubes</b> has <b>been</b> analyzed in detail. Main factors causing pump <b>tubes</b> corrosion have <b>been</b> discussed. Application of bimetallic <b>tubes</b> <b>is</b> offered. Processing technique of these <b>tubes</b> has <b>been</b> designed, some <b>tubes</b> have <b>been</b> manufactured and proved...|$|R
50|$|Since any convex {{open set}} is a domain of holomorphy, a convex <b>tube</b> <b>is</b> also a domain of holomorphy. So the {{holomorphic}} envelope of any <b>tube</b> <b>is</b> equal to its convex hull.|$|R
40|$|Diploma thesis {{deals with}} design and {{exploration}} of installation {{in the draft}} tube of the swirl turbine. Use of the draft <b>tube</b> <b>is</b> defined in the first part, with illustration of energetical gain and efficiency of draft tube. Further the suitable shape of draft <b>tube</b> <b>is</b> studied by CFD computing. Design, research and evaluation of installation in the draft <b>tube</b> <b>are</b> solved in the main part...|$|R
5|$|Chest <b>tubes</b> <b>are</b> {{required}} in PSPs {{that have not}} responded to needle aspiration, in large SSPs (>50%), and in cases of tension pneumothorax. They are connected to a one-way valve system that allows air to escape, but not to re-enter, the chest. This may include a bottle with water that functions like a water seal, or a Heimlich valve. They are not normally connected to a negative pressure circuit, as this would result in rapid re-expansion of the lung and a risk of pulmonary edema ("re-expansion pulmonary edema"). The tube is left in place until no air is seen to escape from it {{for a period of}} time, and X-rays confirm re-expansion of the lung.|$|E
5|$|Storm petrels {{normally}} nest in crevices between {{or under}} rocks, or burrow in the soil. When {{they make their}} own tunnels, they loosen the earth with their bills and kick out the debris with their feet. The birds less commonly nest in walls, under buildings or down rabbit burrows. Disused or occupied burrows of Atlantic puffins and Manx shearwaters are sometimes used, and the petrel pair may share a common entrance with those seabirds, rabbits or other pairs of its own species. Where other occupants are present, the petrels dig a side burrow or use an existing low-roofed tunnel which the larger birds or rabbits cannot easily enter. Even so, puffins and shearwaters will sometimes access and destroy nests, and adult petrels may be killed by their larger neighbours. Human-made plastic nesting <b>tubes</b> <b>are</b> readily used, and may provide protection against predators. Birds usually mate for life and use the same hole every year.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} types of double-lumen endo-bronchial tubes that have endobronchial as well as endotracheal channels (Carlens, White and Robertshaw tubes). These <b>tubes</b> <b>are</b> typically coaxial, with two separate channels and two separate openings. They incorporate an endotracheal lumen which terminates in the trachea and an endobronchial lumen, the distal tip of which is positioned 1–2cm into the right or left mainstem bronchus. There is also the Univent tube, which has a single tracheal lumen and an integrated endobronchial blocker. These tubes enable one to ventilate both lungs, or either lung independently. Single-lung ventilation (allowing the lung on the operative side to collapse) can be useful during thoracic surgery, as it can facilitate the surgeon's view and access to other relevant structures within the thoracic cavity.|$|E
40|$|During {{disassembly}} {{and subsequent}} visual examinations of X 159 (a Mark A- 19 A type of subassembly containing mixed-oxide fuel), 11 of 19 shroud <b>tubes</b> <b>were</b> found fully or partially severed. Several of the capsules within their shroud <b>tubes</b> <b>were</b> distinctly kinked at axial locations near those {{at which the}} shroud <b>tubes</b> <b>were</b> severed. The examination also disclosed that the shroud-tube fractures occurred during reactor operations...|$|R
50|$|The sutra <b>tubes</b> <b>were</b> small, {{but some}} hexagon-shaped boxes and two-storied pagoda shapes with affixed {{ornaments}} <b>were</b> found. The <b>tubes</b> also had caps on them. The <b>tubes</b> <b>were</b> usually made of metal or ceramics, but bamboo and other containers have also <b>been</b> found. The <b>tubes</b> <b>were</b> buried with ancient mirrors, coins, swords and jewels, and were buried with dehumidification substances like charcoal. The sutra <b>tubes</b> <b>were</b> often buried in sacred {{places such as}} mountain summits and {{on the grounds of}} Shinto temples. Occasionally they were buried underground or above ground, and stone huts were built to enshrine their contents.|$|R
5000|$|The {{experiment}} uses {{a simple}} barometer {{to measure the}} pressure of air, filling it with mercury up until 75% of the tube. Any air bubbles in the <b>tube</b> must <b>be</b> removed by inverting several times. After that, a clean mercury is filled once again until the <b>tube</b> <b>is</b> completely full. The barometer is then placed inverted on the dish full of mercury. This causes the mercury in the tube to fall down until the difference between mercury {{on the surface and}} in the <b>tube</b> <b>is</b> about 760 mm. [...] Even when the <b>tube</b> <b>is</b> shaken or tilted, the difference between the surface and in the <b>tube</b> <b>is</b> not affected due to the influence of atmospheric pressure.|$|R

25|$|Vacuum tubes mostly rely on {{thermionic}} emission of electrons from a hot filament or a cathode heated by the filament. This type {{is called a}} thermionic tube or thermionic valve. A phototube, however, achieves electron emission through the photoelectric effect. Not all electronic circuit valves/electron <b>tubes</b> <b>are</b> vacuum tubes (evacuated); gas-filled <b>tubes</b> <b>are</b> similar devices containing a gas, typically at low pressure, which exploit phenomena related to electric discharge in gases, usually without a heater.|$|E
5000|$|A boiling <b>tube</b> <b>is</b> a small {{cylindrical}} vessel used to strongly heat substances in {{the flame of}} a Bunsen burner. A boiling <b>tube</b> <b>is</b> essentially a scaled-up test tube, being about 50% larger.|$|R
500|$|Six [...] torpedo <b>tubes</b> <b>were</b> {{initially}} fitted. Two each {{were above}} {{water in the}} bow and stern and one was on each broadside underwater. The above-water <b>tubes</b> <b>were</b> removed during a refit in 1906.|$|R
