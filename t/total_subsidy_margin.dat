40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{discusses the}} application of “Agreement on Subsidy and Countervailing Measures (ASCM) ” of WTO to non-market economies (NMEs).   The difficulties of application of ASCM to NMEs mainly lie in two basic questions.   The first is how to separate the subsidy and government involvement in a NME.   The second is how perfect the market {{has to be in}} order to qualify as a benchmark to calculate <b>subsidy</b> <b>margins.</b> By focusing on WTO rules and substantial WTO cases, this dissertation analyzes the difficulties in application of ASCM to NMEs from seven perspectives in legal practice.   They are: (1) whether subsidies in public utility enterprises in China are actionable, because such subsidies as upstream subsidies pass benefits to export-oriented enterprises? (2) whether subsidies may continue after privatisation of state-owned companies? (3) whether the loans provided by state-owned banks in China are subsidies? (4) whether it is fair to evaluate the <b>subsidies</b> <b>margins</b> of the land use rights in China by using out-of-country benchmark? (5) tax-incentive subsidies in China; (6) the calculation of a <b>subsidy</b> <b>margin</b> in NMEs; and (7) whether currency manipulation constitutes a subsidy? The dissertation finds that the difficulties of application of ASCM to NMEs are due to a number of reasons.   First, the deficiencies of ASCM cannot explain {{the application of}} ASCM to NMEs; second, if applicable to NMEs, there are difficulties in defining a subsidy in NMEs and in calculating a <b>subsidy</b> <b>margin</b> in NMEs; third, the non-unification of assessment of a NME results in unfairness to China which faces different standards of evaluating a NME.   Even though China has been a market economy in some countries’ view, it is difficult to be recognised as a market economy by all countries.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impacts}} of CAP reforms, particularly subsidies on technical efficiency of crop farms. An output distance function is employed and estimated together with an inefficiency effects model to capture the effects of CAP subsidies and farmer characteristics on farm efficiency. The model is applied to FADN data (period 1995 - 2004) of crop farms in Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden. The study shows that the 10 -year average technical efficiency is 64 % in Germany, 76 % in the Netherlands and 71 % in Sweden. The average annual changes in technical efficiency are 0. 1 %, 0. 4 % and 2. 3 %, respectively. The share of crop <b>subsidies</b> in <b>total</b> <b>subsidies</b> has {{a negative impact on}} technical efficiency in Germany but a positive impact in Sweden, although insignificant in the Netherlands. The share of <b>total</b> <b>subsidies</b> in <b>total</b> farm revenues has negative impacts on technical efficiency in all three countries, consistent with income and insurance effects. Positive (negative) change in technical efficiency is mainly attributable to farm size (degree of specialisation) in Germany, and degree of specialisation (degree of subsidy dependence) in the Netherlands and Swede...|$|R

40|$|Marine {{protected}} areas (MPAs) are now generally accepted as important {{tools in the}} protection of coastal biodiversity. It is also likely that they play a positive role in enhancing fisheries. Yet currently, less than 1 % of the global oceans are protected, although international agreements have targets ranging from 10 – 30 % coverage. Despite its minuscule size, we consider the current MPA “network ” to be beneficial to fisheries, and its running or maintenance cost, therefore, {{to be a positive}} contribution to the sustainability of fisheries, or a “beneficial ” subsidy (“harmful ” subsidies enhance fishing capacity and effort). A method was derived from data in Balmford et al. (PNAS, 101 : 9694 – 9697) to estimate the annual cost of maintaining MPAs as a function of their size, and of the degree of development of the country in question. We provide national costs of the 53 countries that jointly contribute 95 % of global fisheries catch and, assuming that this type of subsidy, in a given country, cannot exceed 15 % of the ex-vessel value of its fisheries catches, estimated a global MPA subsidy to fisheries of 870 million US$. Given that <b>total</b> <b>subsidies</b> to fisheries currently range from 30 – 34 billion US $ annually (without MPA costs), this amounts to only 2. 5 – 2. 8 % of <b>total</b> <b>subsidies</b> to fisheries being devoted explicitly to the maintenance of the biodiversity that sustains them...|$|R

40|$|At present, {{the return}} of {{farmland}} to forests is the key ecological conservation policy in use to control soil erosion and restore the eco-environment of the Loess Plateau, China. In order to explore policy-driven ecological defarming scenarios, Ansei County is taken as a case study. The land use map in 2000 and the topographic and slope map (taking the defarmed slopes with 15 degrees, 20 degrees, and 25 degrees as the do farming thresholds) were used, supported by spatial analysis techniques in geographic information systems (GIS). This paper simulates and analyzes the scale and spatial difference of ecological defaming of Ansai County, the subsidy demand for deforming, and the influences of deforming on agricultural development. The results show: (1) The area of do farmed land with slopes greater than 25 degrees in Ansai amounts to 3451. 05 ha, which accounts for 2. 84 % of total area with slopes over 25 degrees, and the defarming index will be 3. 14 %. The <b>total</b> <b>subsidy</b> demand for deforming land will be 6884. 84 x 10 (4) yuan (RMB) or US$ 1008. 03 x 10 (4). The loss of agricultural food products that results from defarming will be 955. 17 t in the average year, or 1. 66 % of total average annual production. (2) The area of defamed land with slopes over 20 degrees in Ansai will increase to 36, 281. 61 ha, which accounts for 19. 74 % of total area with slopes over 20 degrees, and the defarming index will be 32. 96 %. The <b>total</b> <b>subsidy</b> demand for do farming land will be 72, 381. 81 x 10 (4) yuan or US$ 10, 597. 63 x 10 (4). The loss of agricultural food products due to deforming will be 10, 041. 9 t in the average year, or 17. 50 % of total average annual production. (3) The area of do farmed land with slopes over 15 degrees in Ansai increases to 101, 807. 99 ha, which accounts for 37. 23 % of total area with slopes over 15 degrees, and the defarming index will be 92. 49 %. The <b>total</b> <b>subsidy</b> demand for deforming land will be 203, 106. 94 x 10 (4) yuan or US$ 29, 737. 47 x 10 (4).
