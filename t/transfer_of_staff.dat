25|$|The {{implementation}} of these principles triggered a wide-ranging {{restructuring of the}} sector {{and led to the}} creation of new institutions. The Water Sector Reform Secretariat (WSRS) was formed as a transitional unit in the Ministry of Water and Irrigation to oversee the formation of the new water sector institutions. In 2004, the Water Services Trust Fund (WSTF) was established to provide financial assistance towards capital investment costs in areas lacking adequate services (usually inhabited by the poor). A Transfer Plan was devised in 2005 (through Legal Notice No. 101 of the 12 August 2005) to direct the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> and assets from the central government to the newly founded Water Services Boards and Water Service Providers (for detailed role descriptions see the next paragraph).|$|E
50|$|The Act {{also gave}} to NALIS the {{responsibility}} to manage the national human resources of library and information science personnel in Public Service bodies; this was brought about through the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> from the Public Service and the Statutory Authorities Service Commissions to NALIS.|$|E

50|$|By 1967, the {{new company}} {{was on the verge}} of {{collapse}} with an empty order book—the staff were given notice of the closure which instigated a strike and sit-in at the factory. The situation became one of national interest, with the workers receiving support from trade unions across the country; the prime minister, Paul Vanden Boeynants, visited the factory to seek a resolution. On 1 June 1967, the workers returned to work, after several mitigation measures had been instigated, including short term <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> to other rolling stock manufacturing companies, and large orders given to the metal fabrication plant.

The building of a bridge across the Mahaweli River, later known as the 'Akbar bridge', was planned by Prof. A Thurairajah. Transfer of the first batch of students, students from the Departments of Law and Agriculture and the third and fourth year students of the Department of Veterinary Science, from Colombo to Peradeniya took place in 1949. Another major move took place in 1952, with the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> and students of the Faculties of Arts and Oriental Studies, together with the Main Library and the University Administration. This movement on 6 October 1952 marks the official establishment of University of Ceylon, Peradeniya. At the initial stages, vice chancellor Jennings wanted to model British universities, but met with the resistance of students who opposed the changes.|$|E
50|$|One {{thing for}} which East Town became {{particularly}} well known was {{the production of}} tarpaulins to cover goods wagons which were used at stations across the country. These were originally made of canvas and treated with linseed oil and vegetable black to weather-proof them. As the work was initially done by hand, those employed to make them were usually sailmakers by trade, with mechanisation not introduced until 1915. At the end of 1914, a new Tarpaulin Shop was commissioned, {{but it did not}} last long, being destroyed by fire in January 1915. In 1928, a dedicated tarpaulin factory was opened and, with the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> from the Newmarket Workshops, production increased to the rate of 50 tarpaulins per week. The Tarpaulin Manufacturing Shop was razed by fire on 5 August 1954, requiring an increase in the output of the Addington Workshops until the destroyed facility at East Town was replaced mid-1955. Just two months later, on 18 October, the Tarpaulin Depot Repair Shop was similarly destroyed. In 1973, NZR switched to using PVC tarpaulins which were cheaper to make and easier to repair.|$|E

40|$|Fiscal year 1996 {{has been}} a year of {{significant}} change for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in general and for Engineering in particular. Among these changes, the Laboratory`s national security mission was better defined, the stockpile stewardship program objectives became crisper, LLNL`s investment in high-performance computing was re-emphasized with the procurement of a $ 100 million supercomputer for the Laboratory`s Accelerated Strategic Computing Initiative (ASCI) program, two major Laser programs (the National Ignition Facility and Atomic Vapor Laser Isotope Separation) expanded significantly, and DOE`s human genome efforts moved to {{the next phase of}} development. In the area of business operations, LLNL`s Cost Cutting Initiative Program (CCIP) was completed and the Laboratory restructured its workforce using a Voluntary Separation Incentive Program (VSIP). Engineering similarly also saw many technical and programmatic successes, as well as changes, starting with completion of its strategic plan, significant consolidation of its facilities, restructuring of its workforce, reduction of its overhead costs, substantial <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> between programs, and finally my personal arrival at Livermore.

40|$|Background Following the Health and Social Care Act in England, {{public health}} teams were {{formally}} {{transferred from the}} NHS to local authorities in April 2013. Methods Online survey of Directors of Public Health (DsPH) in local authorities in England (n = 152) to investigate their experience within local government 1 year on. Tests of association were used to explore relationships between the perceived integration and influence of public health, and changes in how the public health budget was being spent. Results The organization of and managerial arrangements for public health within councils varied. Most DsPH felt that good relationships had been established within the council, and the move had made them more able to influence priorities for health improvement, even though most felt their influence was limited. Changes in commissioning using the public health budget were already widespread and included the de-commissioning of services. Conclusions There was a widespread feeling amongst DsPH that they had greater influence since the reforms, and that this went across the local authority and beyond. Public health's influence was most apparent when the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> to local government had gone well, when collaborative working relationships had developed, and when local partnership groups were seen as being effective...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{findings}} of a research project that examined the changes to the public health system in England introduced in 2013. Drawing on case study research and two national surveys the findings explore the impact of organisational change on the composition and role of public health teams. Views and experiences were obtained from public health leaders involved in the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> and functions from the National Health Service in England to local authorities. National surveys at two points in time aimed to compare and contrast views on the evolving changes. The new organisational and managerial arrangements had enabled public health professionals to widen their work and influence, and public health skills and budgets were welcomed by those in local government. Initially, in some areas, directors of public health were less certain of the benefits of the transfer to local government compared to high levels of confidence expressed by elected members, but perspectives changed over time and moved closer together. National headline figures were found to mask high levels of turbulence and churn being experienced by individual authorities identified in the case study research, and the trend of reducing capacity through cuts to staff, budget and services was a cause for serious concern...|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 20 th Annual South African Transport Conference 16 - 20 July 2001 "Meeting the transport challenges in Southern Africa", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. ABSTRACT: The Northern Province Department of Public Works committed itself to improved service delivery. One of the most severe problems experienced by the Department is that the extent of personnel expenses are out of proportion {{when compared to other}} expenses. Personnel expenses can be reduced by outsourcing non-core functions of the department, for example road construction. In the case of the departmental road construction unit it has been decided to transfer the unit, including staff and equipment, to a suitable private sector construction company. The paper addresses the composition and performance of the road construction unit, staff issues and the interaction with organised labour, the invitation of expressions of interest from private sector road construction companies and the shortlisting of these companies for the tendering phase. A framework for the process of tendering for and implementation of the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> and equipment is then addressed. The transfer of the unit is linked to a road construction project, which will facilitate the merging of the unit into the organisation of the successful tenderer. As this is seen as a pilot project it is believed that similar projects will follow in future, and is it anticipated that the experience gained will be of value to those responsible for the implementation of similar projects.
