As the calculations of this location were being carried out automatically, he could concentrate solely on the sight throughout the bomb run. The sight projected crosshairs into space so they were in focused at infinity, allowing the user to focus <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> target and not have to change focus to see the line.|$|E

The city fathers had <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Owens River, about 250 miles (400km) northeast of Los Angeles in Inyo County, near the Nevada state line. It was a permanent stream of fresh water fed by the melted snows of the eastern Sierra Nevada. It flowed through the Owens River Valley before emptying into the shallow, saline Owens Lake, where it evaporated.|$|E

From November 20-December 22, the Suns posted a 15-game win streak, followed almost immediately with a 17-game win streak from December 29-January 28. On March 14, the 49-14 Suns met the 52-10 Dallas Mavericks in a marquee matchup with big implications: both teams were fighting for the top seed in the Western conference and Nash was going for his third consecutive MVP award against Dirk Nowitzki. Though the Suns won the game in double overtime, the Mavericks would finish with the West's top seed at 67-15, and Dirk would narrowly win the MVP award ahead of Nash.|$|E

25|$|On 14 July, {{the insurgents}} set <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> large weapons and {{ammunition}} cache inside the Bastille fortress, {{which was also}} perceived to be a symbol of royal power. After several hours of combat, the prison fell that afternoon. Despite ordering a ceasefire, which prevented a mutual massacre, Governor Marquis Bernard-René de Launay was beaten, stabbed and decapitated; his head was placed on a pike and paraded about the city. Although the fortress had held only seven prisoners (four forgers, two noblemen kept for immoral behaviour, and a murder suspect) the Bastille served as a potent symbol of everything hated under the Ancien Régime. Returning to the Hôtel de Ville (city hall), the mob accused the prévôt des marchands (roughly, mayor) Jacques de Flesselles of treachery and butchered him.|$|E
500|$|Minogue's tenth record X was a {{move back}} to her pop roots. In a press {{interview}} {{for the promotion of}} the album, she stated that the album was [...] "mainly electropop" [...] and was a [...] "celebration for me to be back working." [...] However, critics said the album did not feature enough [...] "consistency" [...] and Chris True called the tracks [...] "cold, calculated dance-pop numbers." [...] However, he said her eleventh album Aphrodite [...] "rarely strays past sweet love songs or happy dance anthems" [...] and [...] "the main sound is the kind of glittery disco pop that really is her strong suit." [...] Tim Sendra from Allmusic stated, [...] "The various producers keep <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dancefloor throughout, crafting shiny and sleek tracks that sound custom-built to blast out of huge speaker columns" [...] and found Aphrodite [...] "One of her best, in fact." ...|$|E
500|$|Detailing and {{protesting the}} ugliness {{of life is}} a common theme {{throughout}} the history of Spanish art, from the dwarves of Diego Velázquez to Pablo Picasso's Guernica (1937). Reflecting on The Disasters of War, biographer Margherita Abbruzzese notes that Goya asks that the truth [...] "be seen and... shown to others; including those who have no wish to see it.... And the blind in spirit stay <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outward aspect of things, then these outward aspects must be twisted and deformed until they cry out what they are trying to say." [...] The series follows a wider European tradition of war art and the examination of the effect of military conflict on civilian life—probably mostly known to Goya via prints. This tradition is reflected especially in Dutch depictions of the Eighty Years' War with Spain, and in the work of 16th-century German artists like Hans Baldung. It is believed Goya owned a copy of a famous set of 18 etchings by Jacques Callot known as Les Grandes Misères de la guerre (1633), which record the devastating impact on Lorraine of LouisXIII's troops during the Thirty Years' War.|$|E

2500|$|Early {{instructions}} to the coastwatchers emphasised concealment, with emergency radios {{set up in the}} scrub near each station. [...] As well as their primary task of keeping <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sea for ships, the men (no women were involved) carried out surveys, took weather measurements, and made observations on the wildlife of the islands. [...] Each station made radio contact daily with New Zealand, at staggered times to minimise the risk of their presence becoming known. [...] The men were relieved yearly, though a few repeated their tours of duty; two of them spent three years on the islands, with the naturalist J.H. Sorensen spending four years on Campbell Island.|$|E
2500|$|During their {{climb back}} to Blanket Hill, several guardsmen stopped and half-turned to keep <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{students}} in the Prentice Hall parking lot. At 12:24p.m., according to eyewitnesses, a sergeant named Myron Pryor turned and began firing at the crowd of students with his [...]45 pistol. A number of guardsmen nearest the students also turned and fired their rifles at the students. In all, at least 29 of the 77 guardsmen claimed to have fired their weapons, using an estimate of 67 rounds of ammunition. The shooting was determined to have lasted only 13 seconds, although John Kifner reported in The New York Times that [...] "it appeared to go on, as a solid volley, for perhaps a full minute or a little longer." [...] The question of why the shots were fired remains widely debated.|$|E

[...] In September 1932, Kenneth Conn, the sports editor of The Toledo News-Bee, wrote that Coach Harry Kipke had [...] "sufficient reason to weep on every shoulder" [...] as he faced the [...] "stupendous task" [...] of replacing his entire line from left tackle to right tackle. [...] Conn wrote that Kipke's challenges were made worse by a [...] "suicide schedule" [...] and added:"No one can accuse the Wolverines of gaining a synthetic title if they can clamor triumphantly thru that list. [...] In fact, it looks like Michigan athletic fathers had <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> financial possibilities of such a schedule rather than a victorious season for their famed 'champions of the west.'" [...] In mid-September 1932, the Associated Press published a feature story on the prospects of the 1932 Michigan team.

2500|$|Notorious for {{his defense}} against the pirates, Mangkaw was a known net-fisherman. Already a fishing ground that it is today, Sogod then had houses {{clustered}} close to shore around the watchtower. Being {{an expert in the}} art of casting the net, Laya, he could send out the casting net in a perfect circle in the sea. As the community grew bigger, the residents agitated for a name for their place. Meetings after meetings were held presided by Mangkaw. But every time a meeting is ongoing, a shoal of fish would be seen by the subtle wave of the surface or quick shifting shadow beneath the surface. The eyes of the pondering datu kept stalking it, interfering with the meeting. Satisfying his unequalled fisherman's instinct, he would leave the meeting unattended and his body language was being watched by the attendees, feasting <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> artful slide of the feet of the datu so as not to disturb the surface, his eyes fixed on the school. Then, he shared his catch with the people for the asking, even by strangers. After which, shouts of [...] "Sogod, sogod!" [...] (vernacular for [...] "to begin") would reconvene the meeting. Thus the word [...] "Sogod" [...] became the name of the village then and the town as it is today.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, {{the country had}} seen what many {{believed}} to be the failure of capitalism. Banks were failing; the high unemployment rate resulted in bread lines and the dust bowl resulted in a great westward migration of homeless and desperate farm families, as a consequence, many Americans, whether intellectuals, artists or factory workers had <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union, thinking it was possible that an economy based on something other than [...] "free enterprise" [...] might lead to a more stable society. Many American writers and artists joined the Communist Party. In his 1956 paperback, The Left Side of the Screen, Bob Herzberg described Rowland Brown as [...] "an angry and short-tempered Communist" [...] who [...] "punched out a Fox producer in the early 1930s." [...] Brown was neither a member of the Communist Party, nor a fellow traveler," [...] but because of the implied critique of capitalism some found in his gangster movies, he was suspected. Brown, himself, furthered that reputation by announcing that he had sent a congratulatory telegram to the U.S.S.R. on the anniversary of the Russian Revolution. Furthermore, Brown and his brother, , had accepted a Soviet invitation to make a film in Russia. They got as far as New York before changing their minds and turning back. Neither of the brothers was included on the Hollywood blacklist during the McCarthy Era. Even though Samuel Ornitz, who had worked with Brown on Hell's Highway,' was one of The Hollywood Ten, Brown was never called to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee.|$|E
