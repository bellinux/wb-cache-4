5|$|As {{part of the}} Oslo Airport {{location}} controversy, {{after the}} new airport was decided located to Gardermoen, there was a public discussion {{as to what to}} do with the general aviation which had operated from Fornebu. While some local aircraft owners wanted to keep a small part of Fornebu for general aviation, the authorities decided to close the airport completely. Instead, the general aviation was distributed to various private airports in Eastern Norway, including Notodden. In May 1998, Air Team started flights from Notodden to Bergen. Air Team gradually moved all its operations, including its pilot school, to Notodden. After Fornebu was closed in October, the airline experienced a quadrupling of patronage, as Gardermoen had given longer travel <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>people</b> in Buskerud and Telemark. In addition to business travel, the airline catered offshore workers commuting to the North Sea via Bergen. The airline stated that it intended to also open routes to Stavanger and Copenhagen.|$|E

[...] Brownlow argued that while it was common in Wesley's <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>people</b> to believe in ghosts, he provided evidence that many Presbyterian ministers still believed in such things. [...] He derided Ross as a [...] "habitual adulterer" [...] {{and the son of}} a slave, and accused his relatives of stealing and committing indecent acts (Ross's son responded to the latter charge with a death threat).

2500|$|The {{release date}} for When Your Heart Stops Beating was heavily {{anticipated}} and publicized {{by the music}} press. As early as August 2005, Internet rumors began to circulate that the album would be released in January 2006 although the band's management denied the claims. Thanks to Hoppus and Barker's silence on press interviews, misinformation flooded the Internet in the {{months prior to the}} record's release, such as countless impostors posting fake songs online. [...] "It's kind of flattering that some kids would go out there and post songs under our name," [...] Barker added. [...] "I mean, at least it means that people are excited to hear our stuff." [...] "No, It Isn't" [...] leaked in December 2005 and caused speculation as it addressed the break-up of Blink-182 head-on. Hoppus did not give any formal interviews before shortly prior to the release of the album, instead spending time updating his blog, producing tracks for Motion City Soundtrack, and working on the album in relative secrecy. [...] "During that time, their former bandmate, Tom DeLonge, did the opposite, peppering blogs and magazines with quotes hyping his new band and putting the blame for the Blink situation squarely on their shoulders," [...] reported James Montgomery of MTV News. While it [...] "pained" [...] them to do so, Hoppus and Barker refrained from speaking to media, instead burying themselves in the studio in the recording of the album. [...] "We just bit our tongues and didn't say anything, and now that the record is done, we get the chance to tell the truth about everything," [...] Hoppus said. [...] "We were silent for a year, and we couldn't put into words what we were doing, so we just decided not to say anything and let the music speak for itself," [...] Barker added. [...] "Now it's <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>people</b> to hear that music and hear the truth." ...|$|E

Knowing all this, although if they had not known it they would scarcely have found it out from the speech of their neighbours, the Delaplaines kept much to themselves. And they were happy, and the keynote of their happiness was struck by Kate, whose thankful heart could never forget the death of Captain Vince.|$|E
