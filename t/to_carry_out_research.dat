500|$|In 1959, the Project {{was moved}} to Miami and {{collocated}} with the Miami hurricane forecast office. [...] The Department of Commerce leased two DC-6 aircraft and received a B-57 jet from the Air Force so that NHRP could continue to carry out airborne experiments on hurricanes. [...] The combination of research project, forecast center, and aircraft facility was dubbed the [...] "National Hurricane Center" [...] (NHC). [...] During the 1960s, while NHRP continued <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>research</b> flights, the Project also began to create computer models of hurricane circulation, formulated a statistical track program (NHC-64), wrote a manual on hurricane forecasting, and evaluated the accuracy of track forecasts. [...] Starting with Hurricane Esther (1961), NHRP was heavily involved with Project Stormfury, the U. S. Government's experiment in hurricane modification. [...] Late in 1964, the Project was renamed the National Hurricane Research Laboratory in recognition of it becoming a permanent institution within the Weather Bureau. [...] This presaged {{the creation of the}} Environmental Research Laboratories the next year.|$|E

2500|$|In March 1974, {{a meeting}} led by Abdus Salam and Munir Ahmad Khan {{constituted}} a small directorate, code name Wah Group Scientists (WGS). Its members contained Hafeez Qureshi, director-general of Radiation Isotope Application Division (RIAD), and Zaman Sheikh, a chemical engineer from DESTO. The Wah Group Scientists began research on high precision mechanical and chemical components, physics calculation, high explosives and triggering mechanism. The same month of March, Abdus Salam and Munir Ahmad Khan {{set up a}} plant to manufacture fissile explosive lenses. In April 1974, Abdus Salam formed another group [...] "Laser Physics Group" [...] (LPG), headed by Shaukat Hameed Khan. The Laser Physics Group was charged <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>research</b> and discover a process to separate NU into EU and DU.

Theoretical physicists at Institute of Physics (IP) of Quaid-e-Azam University began to report back to Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission. Theoretical physicists at IP formed the [...] "Theoretical Physics Group (TPG)", which was mandated to develop the design of Pakistan's nuclear weapons. Abdus Salam played an integral role in TPG, and had done the groundbreaking work for the [...] "Theoretical Physics Group", which was initially headed by Salam until 1974. The TPG took the research in Fast neutron calculations—the key to calculations of critical mass and weapon detonation. The TPG began to report directly to Abdus Salam and research was undertaken under his supervision. The TPG examined the problems of neutron diffraction, the theory of Simultaneity, hydrodynamics, {{and what kind of}} and how much fissile material and reflectors would be used. In 1973, Bhutto appointed Raziuddin Siddiqui as Technical member of Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, and made him responsible for the preparation of its charter. Raziuddin Siddiqui, a theoretical physicist, established the Mathematical Physics Group (MPG) that took charge <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>research</b> in calculations on MC Integrals, cross section theory, critical mass theory, and mathematics involved in general theory of fission reactions.|$|E
