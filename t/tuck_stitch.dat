Thus needles will knit or not, and the unknitted yarn portions will lie under (slip stitch) or over the needle or {{be held in the}} needle hook (<b>tuck</b> <b>stitch).</b> Needles can be placed in holding position to allow short row shaping.

Due to their improved mechanical properties, composites made from multi-layer knit fabrics show great potential in lightweight applications. This paper reports {{on the development of}} flat knitted multi-layer textile preforms for high performance thermoplastic composites using hybrid yarns made of glass (GF) and polypropylene (PP) filaments. Such textile preforms with different reinforcements were used to consolidate into 2 D thermoplastic composites. Moreover, the mechanical properties of these composites were studied. The mechanical properties of 2 D composites were found to be greatly affected by different arrangements of reinforcement yarns. The integration of reinforcement yarns as biaxial inlays (warp and weft yarns) is found to be the best solution for knitting, whereas <b>tuck</b> <b>stitch</b> shaped and unidirectional arranged reinforcements offer also promising application possibilities...|$|E
40|$|Based on the {{structural}} {{analysis of sample}} knitted fabrics and the knit geometric theory, we have built an algorithm that can make three-dimensional structure models for weft knitted fabrics such as welt <b>stitches,</b> <b>tuck</b> <b>stitches,</b> cross stitches, rib stitches and purl stitches. In order to reduce computational complexity, we have set the anchoring point on the diametral plane of yarn in the knitting chart. Drawing from the beginning knitting point to the finished knitting point, a smooth knit curve model can be obtained with the cardinal spline curve. Using this algorithm, we have developed the weft knit three-dimensional structure modeling software that can display the three-dimensional model of knitted fabrics including welt stitches; <b>tuck</b> <b>stitches,</b> cross stitches, rib stitches and purl stitches.

On a frame, a tickler wire could realise individual loops and create a run that would be picked up by hand. The frame was modified by adding a tickler bar and a tuck presser, to allow held and <b>tuck</b> <b>stitches.</b> Here the weft was held in the beard and carried up to the next course where two threads were passed together. Messrs Morris and Betts took a patent (807) in 1764 on a stitch transfer devise where threads from one needle were passed to another. With <b>tuck</b> <b>stitches,</b> this a created 'eyelet holes'.

Although various fabric parameters that affect the ultraviolet radiation (UVR) transmission were studied by researchers, most of them focused on woven fabrics and chemical approaches for enhancing UV protection. Knitwear is an indispensable clothing in summer but there were few studies concerning knitted fabrics, in particular the influence of fabric constructions on ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) and structural properties. This thesis aimed at studying the UV protective property of knitted fabrics at a fundamental level by investigating the influence of different knit structures upon UPF with the three main knit stitches incorporated in the cotton knitted fabric constructions, namely, knit, <b>tuck</b> and miss <b>stitches.</b> The impacts of yarn characteristics, fabric constructions, coloration, end-use conditions including stretching, wetting and laundering, on UV protection were comprehensively studied. A metallic biaxial stretching equipment was specially developed {{for the evaluation of}} UV protection of fabrics in stretched condition. The results showed that fabrics with different knit structures have distinct performances in UV protection. A fabric with miss stitches offered remarkable UV protection whereas a fabric with <b>tuck</b> <b>stitches</b> exhibited poor UV protection. The colored knitted fabric with miss stitches imparted relatively better UV protection in a lighter color depth than the fabric with <b>tuck</b> <b>stitches</b> that were dyed in a darker shade. It infers the potential for reducing usage of dyestuffs and chemical auxiliaries in manufacturing UV protective clothing. Besides, knitted fabrics with miss stitches retained good UV protection under the stretched and wet conditions that simulating the daily wearing conditions of knitwear. The results of this study would provide value-added information to textile designers, manufacturers, and consumers for the enhancement of UV protection and selection of UV protective knitwear.

H 577 P ITC 2017 LiuSxxi, 172 pages :color illustrationsThe {{research}} {{progress made}} {{in the field of}} materials science and the efforts put forth by many researchers have resulted in many research works that focus on wearable electronic textiles. Nowadays, wearable electronic textiles have progressed from the research lab into the industry and subsequently commercialized. The different ways of incorporating conductive fibers and electronic components into traditional textiles have been receiving much attention due to the potentially significant commercial value. However, the industry {{does not appear to have}} the means to new knowledge and knowledge transfer. For example, the industry does not have the resources to calculate and control yarn resistance on fabrics simply based on current textile knowledge, and wearable electronic products thus cannot be further developed. Nevertheless, the results of research on such products are not significant or adequate due to the complexity of the interdisciplinary efforts required for their success. Therefore, there is a need to establish a systematic method to provide the industry with a reference source to produce wearable electronics. The relationship between different stitches and the properties of conductive materials needs to be elaborated. This study conducts a series of experiments on the resistivity of conductive knitted fabric with different knitwear structures. Based on a previous study that modeled the resistance of plain jersey fabric with different numbers of wales and courses, planar geometric models are established for 1 x n float and Single Pique structures. Resistive network models are developed for different external voltages to determine the resistance values of conductive knitted fabrics with different numbers of wales and courses. Corresponding experiments are carried out to verify the proposed models. The simulated results obtained through modeling agree well with the experimental data with an acceptable range of error. Finally, a comparison of jersey (knit), float and <b>tuck</b> <b>stitches</b> is carried out with the relative wales and courses. It is concluded that both float and <b>tuck</b> <b>stitches</b> could reduce the total resistance of conductive knitted fabrics, and between them, tuck structures can provide lower resistance as well as a more aesthetically pleasing appearance. On the other hand, float structures are more economical, as conductive yarn is expensive so its cost is reduced with use of float stitch as the loop length is much shorter than that of the <b>tuck</b> <b>stitches.</b> Three thermal knitwear garments are developed in the experiments to test the thermal performance to determine the optimal design from the different knitted structures. It is concluded that the thermal properties are influenced by the different knitted structures and Single Pique has the most optimal performance in terms of the heating effect among the three types of selected structures. The newly developed resistance models in this study will provide significant benefits to the commercialization of wearable electronic textiles, as well as to the apparel industry as they can now offer apparel products that are not only aesthetically pleasing and multi-functional, but also have high added value.

40|$|The {{alarming}} {{increase of}} incidence {{of skin cancer}} has hastened development of ultraviolet (UV) protective clothing and research on UV protection of apparel. Although various fabric parameters that affect ultraviolet radiation (UVR) transmission were studied by researches, most of them focused on woven fabrics and chemical approach in enhancing UV protection. There were few studies concerning knitted fabrics, in particular the influence of fabric constructions on ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) and structural properties. The magnitude of transmission and scattering of UVR through a fabric is decided by fabric construction or knit structure, which is classified by geometrical arrangement of yarns and fibers of the fabric. This paper aimed at studying the influence of different knit structures upon the UPF with the three main knit stitches incorporated in the knitted fabric constructions, namely the knit, <b>tuck</b> and miss <b>stitches.</b> The UPF and structural characteristics, including thickness, weight, stitch density and porosity of greige and bleached knitted fabrics with different knit structures, are compared by adopting factorial analysis of variance. The results show that fabrics with miss stitches possess a higher UPF than fabrics with <b>tuck</b> <b>stitches.</b> The double-knitted fabrics have better UV protection than the single-knitted fabrics overall, but bleaching has different impacts on the UPF of single- and double-knitted fabrics. The study reveals that fabric thickness or weight cannot be used solely in explaining the UV protective performance of knitted fabrics. However, fabric porosity {{can be a good}} indicator for UV protection when comparing fabrics with similar fabric weight and thickness but different structures or fiber contents.

40|$|Wearable {{electronics}} textiles {{are a new}} emerging phenomenon. These are textiles {{that incorporate}} electrical properties, for example heating, light emitting, sensing, etc., and are now being rapidly developed due {{to the creation of}} new types of fibers and fiber composites. The different ways {{that can be used to}} combine conductive fibers with electronics components have been receiving much attention in wearable electronics research. However, to meet the requirements for both aesthetics and function, textiles technology and the garment design method are important for commercial success. In order to apply electronics to fabrics with the use of conductive fibers, complex and elastic fabric structures both need to be modeled. Therefore, the focus of this study is to examine the resistance properties of single pique, a fabric that is conductive and has a knitted structure that uses <b>tuck</b> <b>stitches,</b> a typical structure in knitting. A planar geometric model is established for a single pique structure based on the loop construction of this knitted fabric. Subsequently, resistive network models are developed for different cases of external voltages to calculate the resistance values of single pique fabrics with different numbers of wales and courses. Corresponding experiments are carried out to verify the proposed resistive network modeling. The newly developed resistance model in this study will provide significant benefits to the industrialization of wearable electronics textiles and the apparel industry as they can offer commercial apparel products that are not only aesthetically pleasing and multi-functional, but also have high added value.

The market value of UV-protective clothing is worth considering. This paper will provide important information to textile designers, manufacturers, and consumers about the production and selection of UV-protective knitwear. Although various factors that affect UV protection of fabrics have been studied by researchers, most of them focused on woven fabrics and chemical approaches for improving UV protection. Knitwear {{in the form of}} daily wear is an indispensable form of clothing in summer but there has been limited research concerning the UV-protective properties of weft-knitted fabrics to date, in particular the influence of fabric construction on UV protection factor (UPF) and fabric structural properties. This issue of Textile Progress reviews the major factors that affect UV protection by fabrics, including fibre types, yarn characteristics, fabric construction, colouration, chemical additives, wetness (rather than just the moisture absorbed into the fibres), the stretching that may occur in clothing, and the effects of laundering. Methods for evaluating the UV-protective ability of fabrics are also addressed.

40|$|The {{influence}} of coloration on ultraviolet (UV) protection of cotton knitted fabrics with different knit structures incorporated {{with the three}} major stitch types, namely knit, <b>tuck</b> and miss <b>stitches,</b> are studied in four approaches. The effects of color depth and knit structures on the ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) of fabrics are investigated. The influences of hue and color depth on the UPF of fabrics are also compared. Since UV protection offered by dyes mainly depends on their chemical structures, the UPF and color strength of fabrics colored by reactive dyes that varied in reactive groups, such as mono-functional and bi-functional reactive dyes, are examined. The correlations between UPF and the CIELAB color coordinates, color strength (K/Ssum), are analyzed. The results show that light-colored fabrics with compact structures achieve similar or even better UV protection than the dark-colored fabrics with loose structures. This implies that color property {{might not be a}} reliable indicator for UV protection of knitted fabrics and the effect of coloration on UV protection is affected by fabric construction. The results also denote that the chemical structure of reactive dyes affects the UV protection of fabrics in a qualitative approach that depends on the unique ultraviolet radiation blocking ability of the chemical constituents. Among the color coordinates investigated, only lightness (L*) and K/Ssum are found to be correlated with the UPF of the fabrics, but the strength of correlations is not very strong. This is because the fabric characteristics that have significant impacts of UV protection are mostly not involved in the measurement of color properties. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
