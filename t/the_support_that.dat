5|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>that</b> Zbor {{received}} in Serbia came {{from members of}} the urban middle class, as well as right-wing students and members of the armed forces. The majority of Zbor's members were ethnic Serbs, though some Croats and Slovenes also joined. Its membership fluctuated often, primarily due to disagreements over Ljotić's authoritarianism and his lack of popularity and political power in Serbia. Ljotić was an unpopular figure in Serbia due to his pro-German sympathies and religious fanaticism. The limited amount of support received by Zbor itself stemmed from the fact that radical right-wing sentiment was not strong amongst the Serbian population. The reason for this was that right-wing politics were associated with Germany. Being extremely anti-German, the majority of ethnic Serbs rejected fascist and Nazi ideas outright. Zbor never had more than 10,000 active members at any given time, with most of its support coming from Smederevo and from the ethnic German (Volksdeutsche) minority in Vojvodina that had been exposed to Nazi propaganda since 1933.|$|E
5|$|Between 1938 and 1940, {{following}} German–Italian mediation in the First and Second Vienna Awards, and the Hungarian {{invasion of}} Carpatho-Ukraine, Hungary enlarged its territory. It absorbed parts of southern Czechoslovakia, Carpathian Ruthenia {{and the northern}} part of Transylvania, which the Kingdom of Romania ceded. One of the ethno-cultural areas that changed hands between Romania and Hungary at this time was the Székely Land. <b>The</b> <b>support</b> <b>that</b> Hungary received from Germany for these border revisions meant that {{the relationship between the two}} countries became even closer. On 20 November 1940, Hungary formally joined the Axis Tripartite Pact. On 12 December 1940, at the initiative of the Prime Minister, Count Pál Teleki, Hungary concluded a friendship and non-aggression treaty with Yugoslavia. Although the concept had received support from both Germany and Italy, the actual signing of the treaty did not, as Germany's planned invasion of Greece would be simplified if Yugoslavia could be neutralised. After the Yugoslav military coup of 27 March 1941, when the Germans asked the Hungarian Regent, Miklós Horthy, for clearance to launch one of their armoured thrusts using Hungarian territory, Teleki was unable to dissuade the Regent. Concluding that Hungary had disgraced itself irrevocably by siding with the Germans against the Yugoslavs, Teleki shot himself. Horthy informed Hitler that evening that Hungary would abide by the friendship treaty with Yugoslavia, though it would likely cease to apply should Croatia secede and Yugoslavia cease to exist.|$|E
5|$|Several nearby {{countries}} assisted Grenada in its aftermath. The {{government of}} Guyana shipped about $250,000 (2004USD, $40million 2004GYD) worth of sugar, {{as well as}} 100members of the Guyana Defense Force to assist in restoring order and reconstruction. The government of Trinidad and Tobago sent 190policemen, {{and the government of}} Anguilla sent 1,230cases of water. A committee of Caribbean nations realized the local governments could not provide <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>that</b> Grenada needed in its aftermath, and thus turned to international assistance. Within a day of Ivan passing to the south of Grenada, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) deployed 67,600gallons of water, 500rolls of plastic sheeting, four 10,000liter water bladder kits, and a water treatment kit; assistance from USAID totaled $6million (2004USD) within a few weeks of the storm's passage, primarily in aid for reconstruction and rehabilitation. In the weeks subsequent to the hurricane, the European Commission Humanitarian aid Office (ECHO) provided €3million (2004EUR). By a year later, housing redevelopments and disaster preparation problems continued after being impacted by Hurricane Emily; as a result, the ECHO provided €1.2million (2005EUR) to Grenada in September 2005. Nine months after the hurricane, Chinese officials provided assistance in reconstruction and handling foreign debts after meeting with the Grenadian Prime Minister; in 2007, Chinese officials funded {{the construction of a new}} $40million (2007USD) cricket stadium near St. George's. The Caribbean Development Bank approved a $10million loan (2004USD) requested by the government of Grenada in July 2005, which was intended to assist in long-term development of the housing, business, and environmental sectors. Emergency operations in Grenada in coordination with the Pan American Disaster Response Unit ended in July 2005.|$|E

The War Office devised a plan for two contingents of 125 men each from New South Wales and Victoria, and one contingent of 125 men each from Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, and Western Australia, to be attached to separate British units. The six colonial governments each held their own parliamentary debates about <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>that</b> would be offered.

25|$|The Dacian Kingdom {{reached its}} maximum {{expansion}} during King Burebista, between 82BCE - 44BCE.

Julius Caesar intended to start a campaign against the Dacians, due to <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>that</b> Burebista gave to Pompey, but was assassinated in 44BC. A few months later, Burebista shared the same fate, assassinated by his own noblemen. Another theory suggests that {{he was killed by}} Caesar's friends.

25|$|In the 2006 general election, the Social Democratic Party {{received}} the smallest share of votes (34.99%) ever {{in a general}} election with universal suffrage, resulting in the loss of office to the opposition, the centre-right coalition Alliance for Sweden. Among <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>that</b> the Social Democratic Party lost in the 2006 election was the vote of pensioners (down 10% from the 2002 election), and blue-collar trade unionists (down 5%).

25|$|In 457BC Sparta, {{needing a}} {{counterpoise}} against Athens in central Greece, reversed her policy and reinstated Thebes {{as the dominant}} power in Boeotia. The great citadel of Cadmea served this purpose well by holding out as a base of resistance when the Athenians overran and occupied {{the rest of the}} country (457–447BC). In the Peloponnesian War, the Thebans, embittered by <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>that</b> Athens gave to the smaller Boeotian towns, and especially to Plataea, which they vainly attempted to reduce in 431BC, were firm allies of Sparta, which in turn helped them to besiege Plataea and allowed them to destroy the town after its capture in 427BC. In 424BC, at the head of the Boeotian levy, they inflicted a severe defeat on an invading force of Athenians at the Battle of Delium, and for the first time displayed the effects of that firm military organization that eventually raised them to predominant power in Greece.|$|E
25|$|The Days of Rage {{took place}} {{shortly after the}} June Convention, during {{the second week of}} October that fall. Taking place once again in Chicago, they were a {{consequence}} of the Weatherman faction seizing control of the student-run organization and convincing the group as a whole for the need of a full-fledged revolution. During the Days of Rage, “young radicals invested militant action with special power to enlighten, inspire, and mobilize”. This event “provided a way for them to establish the authenticity of their commitments, to assert their dissident or ‘revolutionary’ identities, and to live what they considered meaningful and engaged lives. The Weathermen had anticipated “at least 25,000 people” were to attend the Days of Rage; however, “instead of the promised 25,000 white youth ready to tear up ‘pig city,’” a mere “700 to 800 people gathered” half of them spectators. The four-day spectacle opened the Weathermen’s eyes to the fact that because of their tactics, they would not gain <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>that</b> they had originally intended on gathering.|$|E
25|$|Pakistan's {{military}} initially depended {{almost entirely}} on American armaments and aid, which was increased during the covert U.S. support of Islamic militants in the Soviet war in Afghanistan. America under US President Richard Nixon supported Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War. However, the period following the Soviet withdrawal and {{the dissolution of the}} Soviet Union led indirectly to the increasing realignment of America with the previously pro-Soviet India. The Pressler Amendment in 1990 suspended all American military assistance and any new economic aid amidst concerns that Pakistan was attempting to develop a nuclear weapon. Given <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>that</b> Pakistan had given them during the War in Afghanistan, many Pakistanis saw this as a betrayal that sold out Pakistani interests in favor of India. This belief was further strengthened as India had developed a nuclear weapon without significant American opposition, and Pakistan felt obligated to do the same. Consequently, the primarily geopolitical alliance between Pakistan and China has since 1990 branched out into military and economic cooperation, due to Pakistan's belief that America's influence and support in the region should be counterbalanced by the Chinese.|$|E
