There can be a slight possibility of solidification cracking at high welding speeds and low Crekv/Niekv ratios. <b>Test</b> <b>welds</b> were welded with a Yb:YAG disc laser. The test material was 3. 2 mm EN 1. 4404 2 H C 700 type stainless steel plate which was work hardened by cold rolling. The test materials were welded with different heat inputs ranging from 0. 024 kJ/mm to 0. 12 kJ/mm and with 300 mm and 200 mm focal lengths. The weld seams were square-groove welded as butt weld without filler material. The edges of the groove were made by mechanical or laser cutting. The hardness profiles from cross-sections of the welds were measured with a Vickers microhardness tester using 200 g weight. The mechanical properties were tested with tensile tests. The welds were classified with radiographic verification by an accredited laboratory. A number of the welds were fatigue tested with a bending fatigue tester. The mechanical properties (Rp 0. 2 %, Rm) of the laser welds were almost {{the same as in}} the base material except at the highest heat input. In the radiographic classification, the welds which were welded to the laser-cut edge were classified as class B (accepted). The other welds were classified as class D or C (rejected). The main reasons for the rejection of welds made on mechanically cut edges were lack of penetration or undercut of the weld. A problem with mechanically cut edges, and hence the welds, is that they can be non-square and bent edge. Fatigue tests and tensile tests gave no evidence of solidification cracking in the microstructure of the solidified parts of the welds...|$|R

Bulk polymers fail through craze formation, followed by craze breakdown through chain scission. At small <b>t</b> <b>welded</b> interfaces are not strong enough to support craze formation and fail at small strains through chain pullout at the interface. Once chains have formed an average of about one entanglement across the interface, a stable craze is formed throughout the sample. The failure stress of the craze rises with welding time and the mode of craze breakdown changes from chain pullout to chain scission as the interface approaches bulk strength. The interfacial fracture energy G_I is calculated by coupling the simulation results to a continuum fracture mechanics model. As in experiment, G_I increases as t^ 1 / 2 before saturating at the average bulk fracture energy G_b. As in previous simulations of shear strength, saturation coincides with the recovery of the bulk entanglement density. Before saturation, G_I is proportional to the areal density of interfacial entanglements. Immiscibiltiy limits interdiffusion and thus suppresses entanglements at the interface.

The weldments were prepared using each of two experimental "second-generation" GMA welding wires and a coated electrode. Fatigue tests were conducted using both sound weldments and weldments containing various internal defects, including porosity, slag, lack of fusion, and lack of penetration. Radiographic and ultrasonic testing techniques were used to study the initiation and propagation of fatigue cracks originating at internal weld flaws. The fatigue {{studies have indicated that}} although the highest standards of quality may be used in the fabrication of HY- 130 (<b>T)</b> <b>welded</b> joints, it has not been possible to guarantee the elimination of all defects which have proven to be critical sites for internal fatigue crack nucleation under axial loading. Internal failures were as likely to occur in specimens rated as sound weldments under radiographic inspection as in weldments having regions containing readily detected flaws. Fatigue cracks originating at internal defects were found to initiate at approximately twenty to eighty percent of the total cyclic life-time of butt-welded joint, for tests conducted at a stress cycle of zero-to-tension. Within the normal limits of scatter for fatigue data, however, the number of cycles of crack propagation to failure beyond the point of internal initiation was found to be reasonably consistent at a specific test stress level, for weldments containing various types and percentages of weld defect area.
