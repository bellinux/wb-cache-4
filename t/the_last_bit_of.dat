The final few days of the war near Nandikadal Lagoon in the north east of the island saw very heavy fighting and led to Sri Lankan forces being accused of war crimes, which were denied by the government. Some 300,000 Tamil civilians who were trapped inside the war zone and prevented from escaping by the LTTE were caught in the crossfire during the final phase of the war.|$|E

5000|$|The cipher uses value-dependent lookups {{into the}} key table. These can be undone, since the lookup depends only on <b>the</b> <b>last</b> 8 <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> a variable, {{and when it}} becomes {{necessary}} to look up the value from the key table in decryption, <b>the</b> <b>last</b> 8 <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> value at a certain earlier point in the computation are predictable, even when those operations cannot all be undone without the key table value. For instance, if the lookup of k is based on <b>the</b> <b>last</b> 8 <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> x, then when we want to undo a step like x = x [...] (k << 8), we can look up k by noting that <b>the</b> <b>last</b> 8 <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> x are unchanged by this operation.|$|R

Belle shows up to tell everyone that <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> humanity in Gold's heart is about to be consumed by the Darkness, and the group finds Gold unconscious in his shop. The Apprentice then removes Gold's nearly-black heart from his chest, and uses his power to pull the Darkness out of Gold's heart and transfer it into the Sorcerer’s Hat, which severs Gold's link to the Dagger of Kris in the process. He then puts a pure white heart back into Gold, and casts a preservation spell on Gold, to keep him alive while they figure out how to help him recover. However, the hat is unable to contain the Darkness, and it breaks out, before attacking and entering the Apprentice. Emma uses her light magic to force the Darkness back out of the Apprentice, and the Darkness exits the shop. As the Apprentice lies dying, he tells Emma and Hook that, long ago, centuries before their births, the Sorcerer battled the Darkness and tethered it to a human soul with the Dark One's Dagger, and now that it's free, the only person who can prevent the Darkness from destroying all the realms is the Sorcerer himself: Merlin.|$|E

Excavations there uncovered nearly 400 bones and bone fragments, and physical artefacts ranging from pieces of clay pipes to buttons and brass fittings. Examination of these bones by Anne Keenleyside, the expedition's forensic scientist, showed elevated levels of lead and many cut-marks [...] "consistent with de-fleshing". On {{the basis of this}} expedition, it has become generally accepted that at least some groups of Franklin's men resorted to cannibalism in their final distress.

It premiered on MTV on October 21, 2010, and features cameo appearances by Teyana Taylor, Kevin McCall, and Future Funk from America's Got Talent. The video opens with Brown walking down a deserted street wearing a navy sweatshirt, dark blue denim, and white sneakers. It then cuts to another scene where Brown makes an acrobatic entrance onto {{the top of a}} truck in a neighborhood of old-timey storefronts and brownstones. Wearing a black vest, trousers and a red skinny tie, Brown then leads a mob of kids, teenagers and older residents down the street. As the first chorus nears, Brown begins his first dance sequence with two male dancers. Together, they pull off high mid-air twirls, each seemingly jumping several feet above the ground. Brown then follows a woman down the street, and runs into four female dancers wearing tank tops and suspenders. Together, they perform arm movements, and work in a few hip thrusts. The next scene, Brown is seen at a storefront labeled [...] "Popin Pete's" [...] and continues more dancing with Pete. During the bridge, Brown can be seen wearing a hot pink/salmon-colored blazer, gold chain and, in one shot, carrying a massive shiny boombox. Brown then rallies the crowd from a fire escape just before someone opens a fire hydrant and unleashes a spray of water onto the crowd. In the final scene, Brown is wearing a peach blazer while baring his chest, and performs <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> choreography with male and female dancers.
