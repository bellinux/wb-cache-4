40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} {{a case study of}} the {{contemporary}} changes that affect the Sanjay Gandhi National Park and its surroundings in the city of Mumbai. It cross-examines the relationships between urban nature and urban space {{in the case of a}} city of the South. We argue that the issue of equitable access to urban nature is embedded in the larger question of the Right to the City. We show how processes of urban growth that lead to a shrinking of the forested area are associated with a differentiation of the Right to the City, rather than a general consolidation of claims on space. Defence of the park is mobilised to redefine urban citizenship and leads to a form <b>of</b> <b>graduated</b> <b>citizenship.</b> This differentiates those who see their claims on urban space consolidated; those whose urban citizenship is degraded, and those for whom urban citizenship is denied...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis {{study has}} been {{designed}} for investigating the life satisfaction of pre-school prospective teachers by their gender, class degree, choosing the department voluntarily (or not), <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>graduated</b> high school, number of siblings, socio-economic status, educational status of mother and father. The data was collected via “Individual Data Form” and “Life Satisfaction Scale”. The validity and reliability of the Life Satisfaction Scale was investigated by Durak et al. (2010). Study group consists of 427 (374 female and 53 male) preschool prospective teachers of Gazi, Dicle and Cumhuriyet Universities. According {{to the results of}} the study, it has been understood that choosing department willingly, educational status of parents, number of siblings and socio economic status are effective variables predicting the life satisfaction of preschool prospective teachers. There is not a significant difference according to <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>graduated</b> high school. Possible recommendations are discussed...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{providing}} a template {{of how to}} practice Continual Quality Improvement (CQI) in an Engineering Undergraduate Programme. At {{the inception of the}} programme, the academic curriculum is based upon the notion <b>of</b> the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>graduate</b> an institution <b>of</b> higher learning would like to produce. Hence, a <b>graduate</b> <b>of</b> a particular institution embodies its vision and mission. Taking this further and to ensure specificity in the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>graduate</b> produced, Engineering Programmes provide a set of Programme Educational Objectives (PEOs) which are derived from the vision and mission. From these PEOs, the Programme Outcomes (POs) are crafted, followed by the Learning Outcomes (LOs) at the module level – and hence the appropriate curriculum is decided upon. Once the programme is in full implementation, there exists a need to monitor and control the PEOs, POs and LOs to ensure that the programme progresses and evolves. Herein lies the need to practice CQI at all three levels. The following paper will provide an emphasis of how CQI, implemented correctly can result in enhancing the overall student learning experience...|$|R
30|$|For {{analyses}} of data, the study employed a moderated multiple regression using PROCESS macro (Hayes, 2013) which analyzes direct and conditional effects of moderators in a model. It entails {{the addition of}} an interaction term (mentoring and age) in a linear multiple regression to determine the moderating effect {{of age in the}} model. In the regression models, the effects <b>of</b> sex and <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>graduating</b> institution were controlled for as covariates.|$|R
30|$|Age was {{measured}} on a continuum; however, the inclusion of age as a moderator in the study necessitated a dichotomized measure of age into ‘younger’ and ‘older’ participants. The mean age (24 [*]years) {{was used as the}} norm for the dichotomy. Sex and <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>graduating</b> institution were measured as nominal variables; however their inclusion in a regression model as covariates required them to be recoded as dummy variables.|$|R

On the contrary to the claims, it is found that the pre-service teachers’ attitudes were at medium level.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{migration}} behavior <b>of</b> <b>graduates</b> from UK universities {{with a focus}} on the salary benefits they receive from the migration process. We focus on sequential interregional migration and specifically examine the case of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and Creative subject graduates. Our analysis differs from previous studies in that it accounts explicitly for migrant selectivity through propensity score matching, and it also classifies graduates into different migration behavior categories. Graduates were classified according to their sequential migration behavior first from their pre-university domicile to university and then from university to first job post-graduation. Our results show that ‘repeat migration’, as expected, is associated with the highest wage premium (around 15 %). Other migration behaviors are also advantageous although this varies across different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>graduates.</b> Creative graduates, for instance, do not benefit much from migration behaviors other than repeat migration. STEM graduates, on the contrary, benefit from both late migration and staying in the university area to work...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} spatial {{employment}} patterns <b>of</b> Australia’s university <b>graduates</b> in nonurban locations. Using a 2006 data set recording the employment status of 65, 661 university graduates 6 months after their graduation we examine how the personal and human capital characteristics of the individual university <b>graduate</b> affect the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> rural location into {{which he or she}} enters for employment purposes. The importance <b>of</b> identifying which <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>graduates</b> work where is essential for our understanding of the forces that are currently shaping the spatial distribution of human capital across Australia’s regions. In order to do this we allocate postcode-based data <b>of</b> <b>graduate</b> employment to one of five remoteness classes, as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, that allow us to distinguish between different degrees of rurality. The postcode data are used to associate {{the ways in which the}} human capital characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>graduate</b> in terms <b>of</b> the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> university degrees awarded and the universities attended, as well as the personal characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>graduate,</b> are related to the degrees of rurality in his or her employment outcomes. © 2010 Copyright the Authors.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the factors affecting teacher candidates’ measurement and evaluation course achievement with multiple indicators multiple causes modeling and to explore the effects of this factors on the achievement. The data in the study was obtained with a measurement instrument prepared for this purpose. Questions about departments, parent education level and income, mathematics achievement level and anxiety, academic grade, <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>graduated</b> high school, attitude toward measurement and evaluation course, achievement of measurement and evaluation course and the time allocated to the study were asked to teacher candidates. After analzing fit indexes of the measurment model, the relations between the independent indicator variables and latent variables were investigated by multiple indicators and multiple causes model. According to the results general academic achievement grade, attitudes toward measurement and evaluation course and <b>type</b> <b>of</b> high <b>graduated</b> school have predicted the achievement level of teacher candidates’ in measurement and evaluation course.
