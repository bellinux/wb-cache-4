5|$|This step is {{necessary}} because the rational nexus <b>test</b> <b>is</b> not foolproof. The <b>test</b> <b>is</b> {{based on the}} presumption that the legislative object itself is not {{in violation of the}} Constitution. However, if the object of the statute is itself illegitimate, a classification may be invalid even if it satisfies the test. Hence, the <b>test</b> <b>is</b> only applicable if the object of the impugned legislation is a proper one.|$|E
5|$|If morning {{cortisol}} {{levels are}} over 500nmol/l, ACTH deficiency is unlikely, whereas a level less than 100 is indicative. Levels between 100-500 require a stimulation test. This, too, {{is done with}} the insulin tolerance test. A cortisol level above 500 after achieving a low blood sugar rules out ACTH deficiency, while lower levels confirm the diagnosis. A similar stimulation test using corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is not sensitive enough {{for the purposes of}} the investigation. If the insulin tolerance test yields an abnormal result, a further test measuring the response of the adrenal glands to synthetic ACTH (the ACTH stimulation test) can be performed to confirm the diagnosis. Stimulation testing with metyrapone is an alternative. Some suggest that an ACTH stimulation <b>test</b> <b>is</b> sufficient as first-line investigation, and that an insulin tolerance <b>test</b> <b>is</b> only needed if the ACTH <b>test</b> <b>is</b> equivocal. The insulin tolerance <b>test</b> <b>is</b> discouraged in children. None of the tests for ACTH deficiency are perfect, and further tests after a period of time may be needed if initial results are not conclusive.|$|E

Wilcoxon signed-rank <b>test</b> <b>was</b> used when comparing two related samples.|$|R
50|$|While monkey <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> {{sometimes}} {{treated the}} same as fuzz testing and the two terms are usually used together, some believe they are different by arguing that monkey <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> more about random actions while fuzz <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> more about random data input. Monkey <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> also different from ad-hoc testing in that ad-hoc <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> performed without planning and documentation and the objective of ad-hoc <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> to divide the system randomly into subparts and check their functionality, {{which is not the}} case in monkey testing.|$|R
5000|$|Confirmatory <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> the <b>tests</b> {{required}} {{to confirm the}} analysis. Confirmatory tests cost more than simpler presumptive tests so presumptive <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> often done to see if confirmatory <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> necessary.|$|R

30|$|Qualitative {{phytochemical}} <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> {{carried out}} for the identification of alkaloids, glycosides, flavonoids, saponins, tannin, gums, and terpenoids in the samples [12]. Alkaloids were detected using the Dragendroff’s, Mayer’s, Hager’s and Wagner’s tests. Lead acetate, alkaline reagent, ferric chloride and ammonia <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> used for detection of flavonoids. Legal’s test, Molisch, Keller-Kiliani and Borntrager’s <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> performed to identify glycosides. For identification of tannin potassium dichromate test, ferric chloride, potassium hydroxide and lead acetate <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> followed. Salkowski <b>test</b> and froth <b>test</b> <b>were</b> used to detect the presence of terpenoids and for saponins respectively. Molisch <b>test</b> <b>was</b> performed for detecting the existence of gum in the samples.|$|R
30|$|The Pearson Chi Square {{test and}} Fisher’s exact <b>test</b> <b>were</b> used for {{comparisons}} of the categorical variables. The Mann–Whitney U test and Wilcoxon Signed rank <b>test</b> <b>were</b> used for the comparison of the two groups. Kruskal–Wallis, One way Anova, and Welch <b>test</b> <b>were</b> used for the comparison {{of more than two}} groups. Spearman’s Rho <b>test</b> <b>was</b> used to analyze correlations among the variables.|$|R
5|$|Acute pelvic {{inflammatory}} disease is highly unlikely when recent intercourse has not taken place or an IUD is not being used. A sensitive serum pregnancy <b>test</b> <b>is</b> typically obtained to rule out ectopic pregnancy. Culdocentesis will differentiate hemoperitoneum (ruptured ectopic pregnancy or hemorrhagic cyst) from pelvic sepsis (salpingitis, ruptured pelvic abscess, or ruptured appendix).|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} course curriculum, the exam is {{developed}} by the AP Statistics Test Development Committee as well. With the help of other college professors, the committee creates a large pool of possible questions that is pre-tested with college students taking statistics courses. The <b>test</b> <b>is</b> then refined to an appropriate level of difficulty and clarity. Afterwards, the Educational Testing Service is responsible for printing and administering the exam.|$|E
5|$|Another {{potential}} health problem is {{spinal muscular atrophy}} (SMA), another genetically inherited disease which causes {{the loss of the}} spinal-cord neurons which activate the skeletal muscles of the trunk and limbs. Symptoms are normally seen within 3–4 months of age and result in muscle atrophy, muscle weakness, and a shortened life span. A <b>test</b> <b>is</b> offered to detect the genes responsible for SMA.|$|E
30|$|Pearson’s χ 2 <b>test</b> <b>was</b> used {{to perform}} {{categorical}} analysis, and Spearman’s correlation <b>test</b> <b>was</b> {{used to determine}} correlations. For further evaluations, univariate analysis of variance, the paired t-test, the Kruskall–Wallis test and the Mann–Whitney-U <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> used.|$|R

5|$|Autoimmune {{disorders}} {{can often}} be traced to antibodies that bind the body's own epitopes; many can be detected through blood tests. Antibodies directed against red blood cell surface antigens in immune mediated hemolytic anemia are detected with the Coombs test. The Coombs <b>test</b> <b>is</b> also used for antibody screening in blood transfusion preparation and also for antibody screening in antenatal women.|$|E
5|$|DVT {{diagnosis}} {{requires the}} use of imaging devices such as ultrasound. Clinical assessments, which predict DVT likelihood, can help determine if a D-dimer <b>test</b> <b>is</b> useful. In those not highly likely to have DVT, a normal D-dimer result can rule out a diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Growth hormone {{deficiency}} {{is almost}} certain if all other pituitary tests are also abnormal, and {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} (IGF-1) levels are decreased. If this is not the case, IGF-1 levels are poorly predictive of the presence of GH deficiency; stimulation testing with the insulin tolerance <b>test</b> <b>is</b> then required. This is performed by administering insulin to lower the blood sugar to a level below 2.2mmol/l. Once this occurs, growth hormone levels are measured. If they are low despite the stimulatory effect of the low blood sugars, growth hormone deficiency is confirmed. The <b>test</b> <b>is</b> not without risks, especially in those prone to seizures or are known to have heart disease, and causes the unpleasant symptoms of hypoglycemia. Alternative tests (such as the growth hormone releasing hormone stimulation test) are less useful, although a stimulation test with arginine may be used for diagnosis, especially in situations where an insulin tolerance <b>test</b> <b>is</b> thought to be too dangerous. If GH deficiency is suspected, and all other pituitary hormones are normal, two different stimulation tests are needed for confirmation.|$|E
50|$|Regression <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> used {{to check}} if any new bugs have been {{introduced}} through previous bug fixes.
