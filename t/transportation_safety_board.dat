5|$|An {{estimated}} 2 million {{pieces of}} debris were recovered and brought ashore for inspection at a secure handling facility in a marine industrial park at Sheet Harbour, where small material was hand inspected by teams of RCMP officers looking for human remains, personal effects, and valuables from the aircraft's cargo hold. The material was then transported to CFB Shearwater, {{where it was}} assembled and inspected by over 350investigators from multiple organizations, such as the <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> of Canada, U.S. National <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board,</b> U.S. Federal Aviation Authority (FAA), Air Accidents Investigation Branch, Boeing, Pratt & Whitney, and Swissair.|$|E
5|$|The National <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> {{determines that}} the {{probable}} {{cause of this}} accident was the flight crew's operation of the airplane below the minimum descent altitude without an appropriate visual reference for the runway.|$|E

50|$|The DSB {{was formed}} in 2005 by a merger between the defence and public <b>transportation</b> <b>safety</b> <b>boards.</b> It {{replaced}} the Dutch Transport <b>Safety</b> <b>Board.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{accident}} was {{investigated by the}} National <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> (NTSB). The Flight Data Recorder was recovered intact from the wreckage, but the Cockpit Voice Recorder had been damaged in the post-crash fire and was unusable.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{the pilot}} in command, {{according}} to the cockpit voice recorder transcript, the first officer was the pilot flying {{at the time of}} the accident. In the National <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> report on the crash, investigators concluded that the likely cause of the crash was pilot error.|$|E
5|$|In January 2015, the US National <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> cited Flight 370 and Air France Flight 447 when it issued eight safety {{recommendations}} related to locating aircraft wreckage in remote or underwater locations; and repeated recommendations for a crash-protected cockpit image recorder and tamper-resistant flight recorders and transponders.|$|E

5|$|National <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> (NTSB) and Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) {{investigations}} {{determined that}} evasive maneuvers undertaken by Flight 663 {{to avoid an}} oncoming Pan Am Boeing 707 caused the pilot to suffer spatial disorientation and lose control of the aircraft. The accident is the third-worst accident involving a DC-7.|$|E
5|$|The National <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> (NTSB) {{concluded}} that the crash {{was caused by the}} captain's improper execution of an instrument approach, combined with a severe downdraft at a low altitude, which resulted in the aircraft descending uncontrollably into terrain.|$|E
5|$|The {{same week}} as the {{memorial}} dedication, the National <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> held hearings related to another fatal incident in the Metro system, one which happened earlier in 2015; the juxtaposition of the two events was noted by some commentators.|$|E

5|$|According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Cirrus SR20 aircraft, tail number N929CD, {{was owned}} by Lidle. On May 1, 2007, the National <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> (NTSB) stated that the {{probable}} cause of the crash was pilot error. The NTSB was unable to determine which person was flying the aircraft {{at the time of}} the crash.|$|E
5|$|The National <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> {{investigated}} {{the accident and}} published a detailed final report eleven months later on March 11, 1997. From the official point of view, the pilot in command was flight instructor Reid, who {{was the only one}} on board rated to fly the aircraft. The investigation focused on his decision-making prior to takeoff and his actions once airborne.|$|E
5|$|The {{recovery}} operation {{was guided by}} the <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> of Canada (TSB) with resources from the Canadian Forces, Canadian Coast Guard, RCMP, and other agencies. The area was surveyed using route survey sonar, laser line scanners, and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) to locate items. After being located, the debris was then recovered (initially by divers and ROVs, later by dredging and trawling).|$|E
25|$|Denver {{was killed}} on October 12, 1997 when his {{experimental}} Long-EZ plane, aircraft registration number N555JD, crashed into Monterey Bay near Pacific Grove, California, while making a series of touch-and-go landings at the nearby Monterey Peninsula Airport.

5|$|In April 2007, {{acting on}} a {{recommendation}} made by the National <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> (NTSB) during its investigation of Comair 5191, the FAA issued a safety notice that reiterated advice to pilots to positively confirm their position before crossing the hold-short line onto the take-off runway, and again when initiating takeoff. And in May, {{acting on a}}nother NTSB recommendation, the FAA advised that pilot training should include specific guidance on runway lighting requirements for take-off at night.|$|E
5|$|June 20, 1998: A Greyhound bus on a {{scheduled}} trip from New York City to Pittsburgh ran off a road near Burnt Cabins, Pennsylvania, {{and hit a}} truck parked in an emergency parking area. Six passengers and the driver died. The National <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> determined that the probable cause of the accident was the driver's use of a sedating antihistamine and driver fatigue, due to an irregular work-rest schedule.|$|E
5|$|Kulwicki {{died in an}} {{airplane}} crash on Thursday April 1, 1993. He was returning from an appearance at the Knoxville Hooters in a Hooters corporate plane on a short flight across Tennessee before the Sunday spring race at Bristol. The plane slowed and crashed just before final approach at Tri-Cities Regional Airport near Blountville. The National <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> attributed the crash to the pilot's failure to use the airplane's anti-ice system to clear ice from the engine inlet system.|$|E
50|$|Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB, Büro für Flugunfalluntersuchungen, BFU; Bureau d'enquête sur les {{accidents}} d'aviation, BEAA; Ufficio d’inchiesta sugli infortuni aeronautici, UIIA) was the Swiss {{bureau of}} aircraft accident investigation.

50|$|The train {{should have}} been slowing to {{approach}} the curve with a reduced speed limit of 80 mph in its approach and 50 mph within it, but instead, it had accelerated into the curve and was traveling at 106 mph when its engineer applied the emergency brake, and 102 mph when it derailed, according to Robert L. Sumwalt, the National <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board's</b> lead investigator, who cited the onboard event recorder recovered from the wreckage. Investigators are working to determine why the train entered the curve at such a high speed. The windshield of the locomotive may have {{been hit by a}} projectile shortly before the derailment.|$|R
25|$|On June 22, 2015, news {{services}} reported that Horner was presumed {{to have died}} when his Short Tucano turboprop aircraft, registration number N206PZ, crashed into the Los Padres National Forest near Ventucopa, California. The following day, his representatives at the Gorfaine/Schwartz Agency posted a message on their website stating that Horner, the only person aboard the aircraft, was killed. His attorney confirmed Horner was in the airplane when it took off after fueling at Camarillo Airport. On June 25, the Ventura County Medical Examiner's Office confirmed Horner's death and ruled the crash an accident.

5|$|May 13, 1972: Near Bean Station, Tennessee, between Knoxville and Bristol, a Greyhound Scenicruiser on a {{scheduled}} trip from Memphis to New York City collided head-on with a tractor-trailer truck. The {{driver of the}} bus had begun to pass a car. Fourteen people, including both the bus and truck drivers, died. The National <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> determined {{that the cause of}} the crash was the Greyhound driver's overtaking maneuver and his failure to avoid the truck.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{aircraft}} had departed from U.S. soil and U.S. nationals {{had died in}} the incident, the National <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> (NTSB) was legally required to investigate.
