The present study is on concordancing as a tool in learning collocations and it attempted to find the answers to two questions. One on the potential benefits of corpora and concordancing in learning collocations and the other on the type of the collocational combinations searched more by the students. To find the answer to the research questions, the students were taught how to use corpora independently in the hope of becoming autonomous users in future. The results of the study indicated an overall satisfaction with the use of <b>the</b> <b>concordancers</b> in learning collocations among which verb + noun collocations were searched more frequently as they were more problematic for EFL learners.

40|$|While {{the issues}} of {{receptive}} and productive vocabulary knowledge have been discussed in many vocabulary studies, language learners and practitioners have also tried to reduce {{the discrepancy between the}} two types of vocabulary knowledge. At the same time, with the development of new technology of the Internet, web based concordancers became easily accessible for the language learners. However, there has been little research on investigating the effect of <b>the</b> <b>concordancer</b> with empirical data. The current research, therefore, explores the effects of the concordanccer, an application of the corpus-based language instruction, on ESL learners’ productive vocabulary knowledge. Korean undergraduate students at an American public university were recruited, randomly assigned to an experimental group (concordancer group, n= 10) or a control group (thesaurus group, n= 11) for a series of writing practice, and their vocabulary errors in writing samples were statistically compared.

Changes in lexical creativity are linked to normalisation (a translation universal), and to the functions of the invented language.

The aim of the present thesis is to investigate how synonymous rather, quite, pretty and fairly are. The main argument is that the selected English adverbs are synonymous only to some extent as they share the meaning of in some degree. Thus, they can be considered partial synonyms. The important research areas are the study of the meanings of the set of adverbial modifiers based on the information from the Merriam Webster s Online Dictionary and the study of the evidence found in the British National Corpus.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to carry out a corpus-based study on the {{presence}} of violence in a selection of eight tales by the Grimm's Brothers by looking at the terms which can be said to relate to the semantic field of violence.

These words have been chosen due to their possible connection to violence after carrying out a quantitative analysis of the frequency of the whole main corpus. My initial hypothesis is that the corpus-based study of those eight tales would support my intuition regarding the high percentage of violence in the Brothers Grimm collection as opposed to the content of violence in a wider variety of texts.

40|$|More {{and more}} further and higher {{education}} courses have to be designed for learners who have no previous knowledge of the foreign language but who have specific academic and/or professional interests. This paper maintains that their motivation and specialized knowledge can be exploited if foreign language learning is integrated with the academic/professional curriculum. This interdisciplinary approach clashes with traditional categories of foreign language teaching-such as grading and selection of teaching materials-which seem to exclude major variations in the route of foreign language acquisition, particularly at early stages. It is argued that materials can be selected or designed {{on the basis of}} subject and genre related criteria to suit the academic/professional needs and interests of the learners. The resulting set of texts constitutes a small, pedagogical corpus, which is a subset of the discourse type(s) characterizing the discourse community to which the learners belong.

In this paper, we describe a novel, web-based, parallel concordancer designed specifically for use by beginner-level second and foreign language learners of English. The software is built using standard web application tools, such as Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP, and thus can run in most university server environments.
