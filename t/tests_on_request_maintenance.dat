25|$|Around {{the same}} time, {{voluntary}} testing and counseling was made available in some communities, but, even where available, was rarely used. Reluctance to seek HIV testing was {{probably due to}} a number of causes – e.g., cost, inaccessibility of services, absence of any treatment, scant publicity or advocacy for testing, low or no perceived risk, and stigma {{associated with the use of}} testing services. Since 2004, the government has addressed the environmental barriers. The high cost was addressed in 2003 by making free HIV testing available for the poor, and later, under the 'Four Free and One Care' policy, antiretroviral therapy was made freely available for all through the Chinese health system. The number of screening laboratories has been expanded to 5500, and there are now 99 laboratories able to do confirmatory HIV tests. Free HIV testing has been made available, and expanded from 365 counties in 15 provinces in 2002 to over 2300 counties, with 3037 sites, in all provinces in 2006.

40|$|The IRSLO (Information Retrieval using Semantic and Lexical Operators) project aims at {{integrating}} semantic and lexical {{information into}} the retrieval process, {{in order to}} overcome some of the impediments currently encountered with today's information retrieval systems. This paper introduces the semantic wildcard, {{one of the most}} powerful operators implemented in IRSLO, which allows for searches along general-specific lines. The semantic wildcard, denoted with #, acts in a manner similar with the lexical wildcard, but at semantic levels, enabling the retrieval of subsumed concepts. For instance, a search for animal# will match any concept that is of type animal, including dog, goat and so forth, thereby going beyond the explicit knowledge stated in texts. This operator, together with a lexical locality operator that enables the retrieval of paragraphs rather than entire documents, have been both implemented in the IRSLO system and <b>tested</b> <b>on</b> <b>requests</b> of information run against an index of 130, 000 documents.

40|$|We report here {{results of}} a 3 -year pilot {{voluntary}} screening program coupled with prenatal diagnosis directed to the prospective prevention of homozygous beta-thalassemia (beta-thal) in Sardinia. The screening program took two approaches: outreach community testing and hospital <b>testing</b> <b>on</b> <b>request</b> {{after a period of}} sensibilization. The outreach testing was very effective as, taking into account the already known number of couples at risk with an affected proband (20), 74 % of the couple at risk expected (61) {{on the basis of the}} carrier rate were identified. Less effective was the hospital testing in which half of the couples at risk expected were detected (502 with the 199 without an affected proband). After nondirective genetic counseling, approximately 85 % of the couples at risk, which had a pregnancy, with no statistically significant difference between those with and those without a proband, requested prenatal testing. This figure showed a steadily increase from the beginning in 1977 to 1980. All the pregnancies (42), but two carrying homozygous fetuses, were terminated <b>on</b> parental <b>request.</b> A continuous hospital survey of thal-major admissions in the different hospitals of the counties showed a steady decline in the incidence figure at birth from 1976 (1 : 213) to 1978 (1 : 290).

Kingsbury provided subject matter experts from engineering, manufacturing, and technical support. They also provided photographs, schematics, and CAD drawings, which AlliedSignal Federal Manufacturing and Technologies (ASFM and T) digitized {{for use in the}} final program. Information from The Kingsbury troubleshooting experts were interviewed regarding symptoms and root causes of system malfunctions This knowledge was captured and from it, fault trees were developed. These trees were then incorporated into the EPSS as a troubleshooting tool. The troubleshooting portion of the system presents simple questions to the machine operator {{in order to determine the}} likely cause or causes of malfunctions and then recommends systematic corrective actions. The on-line reference manual, covering operations and maintenance, provides text and illustrations to the machine operator in a traditional structure, but additionally offers the capability to search voluminous amounts of technical data and retrieve specific information <b>on</b> <b>request.</b> The <b>maintenance</b> portion of the EPSS includes checklists that are displayed daily, weekly, monthly, and annually, as appropriate, on the VTC- 5 controller screen.

40|$|Abstract Context Mining {{software}} repositories {{has emerged}} as a research direction over the past decade, achieving substantial success in both research and practice to support various software maintenance tasks. Software repositories include bug repository, communication archives, source control repository, etc. When using these repositories to support software maintenance, inclusion of irrelevant information in each repository can lead to decreased effectiveness or even wrong results. Objective This article aims at selecting the relevant information from each of the repositories to improve effectiveness of software maintenance tasks. Method For a maintenance task at hand, maintainers need to implement the <b>maintenance</b> <b>request</b> <b>on</b> the current system. In this article, we propose an approach, MSR 4 SM, to extract the relevant information from each software repository based <b>on</b> the <b>maintenance</b> <b>request</b> and the current system. That is, if the information in a software repository is relevant to either the <b>maintenance</b> <b>request</b> or the current system, this information should be included to perform the current maintenance task. MSR 4 SM uses the topic model to extract the topics from these software repositories. Then, relevant information in each software repository is extracted based on the topics. Results MSR 4 SM is evaluated for two software maintenance tasks, feature location and change impact analysis, which are based on four subject systems, namely jEdit, ArgoUML, Rhino and KOffice. The empirical results show that the effectiveness of traditional software repositories based maintenance tasks can be greatly improved by MSR 4 SM. Conclusions There is a lot of irrelevant information in software repositories. Before we use them to implement a maintenance task at hand, we need to preprocess them. Then, the effectiveness of the software maintenance tasks can be improved. Department of Computin...|$|R

40|$|Background: During the Dutch Q fever {{epidemic}} {{more than}} 4, 000 Q fever cases were notified. This provided logistical {{challenges for the}} organisation of serological follow-up, which is considered mandatory for early detection of chronic infection. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the proportion of acute Q fever patients that received serological follow-up, and to identify regional differences in follow-up rates and contributing factors, such as knowledge of medical practitioners. Methods: Serological datasets of Q fever patients diagnosed between 2007 and 2009 (N = 3, 198) were obtained from three Laboratories of Medical Microbiology (LMM) in the province of Noord-Brabant. One LMM offered an active follow-up service by approaching patients; the other two only <b>tested</b> <b>on</b> physician’s <b>request.</b> The medical microbiologist in charge of each LMM was interviewed. In December 2011, 240 general practices and 112 medical specialists received questionnaires on their knowledge and practices regarding the serological follow-up of Q fever patients. Results: Ninety-five percent (2, 226 / 2, 346) of the Q fever patients diagnosed at the LMM with a follow-up service received at least one serological follow-up within 15 months of diagnosis. For those diagnosed at a LMM without this service, this was 25 % (218 / 852) (OR 54, 95 % CI 43 – 67). Although 80 % (162 / 203) of all medical practitioners with Q fever patients reporte...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Randomised {{trials of}} {{knowledge}} translation strategies for professional behaviour change can provide robust estimates of effectiveness, but offer little {{insight into the}} causal mechanisms by which any change is produced. To illustrate the applicability of causal methods within randomised trials, we undertook a theory-based process evaluation study within an implementation trial to explore whether the cognitions of primary care doctors' predicted their test requesting behaviours and, secondly, whether the trial results were mediated by the theoretical constructs. Methods The process evaluation comprised a cross-sectional questionnaire survey of a random 50 % sample of the randomised groups of primary care practices in Grampian (NHS Grampian), UK, {{who took part in}} a trial of the effect of enhanced feedback and brief educational reminders <b>on</b> <b>test</b> <b>requesting</b> behaviour. The process evaluation was based upon the Theory of Planned Behaviour and focussed on three of the test requesting behaviours that were targeted in the trial [...] ferritin, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and Helicobacter Pylori serology (HPS). Results The questionnaire was completed by 131 primary care doctors (56 %) from 42 (98 %) of the sampled practices. Behavioural intention, attitude, and subjective norm were highly correlated for all the tests. There was no evidence that perceived behavioural control was correlated with any of the other measures. Simple linear regression analysis of the rate of <b>test</b> <b>requests</b> <b>on</b> minimum behavioural intentions had R 2 of 11. 1 %, 12. 5 %, and 0. 1 % for ferritin, FSH, and HPS requesting, respectively. Mediational analysis showed that the trial results for ferritin and FSH were partially mediated (between 23 % and 78 % mediation) through intentions. The HPS trial result was not mediated through intention. Conclusions This study demonstrated that a theory-based process evaluation can provide useful information on causal mechanisms that aid not only interpretation of the trial but also inform future evaluations and intervention development. </p...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} be fully robust and {{responsive}} to a dynamically changing real-world environment, intelligent robots will need {{to engage in a}} variety of simultaneous reasoning modalities. In particular, in this paper we consider their needs to i) rea-son with commonsense knowledge, ii) model their nondeter-ministic action outcomes and partial observability, and iii) plan toward maximizing long-term rewards. On one hand, Answer Set Programming (ASP) is good at representing and reasoning with commonsense and default knowledge, but is ill-equipped to plan under probabilistic uncertainty. On the other hand, Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are strong at planning under uncertainty toward maximizing long-term rewards, but are not designed to in-corporate commonsense knowledge and inference. This pa-per introduces the CORPP algorithm which combines P-log, a probabilistic extension of ASP, with POMDPs to in-tegrate commonsense reasoning with planning under uncer-tainty. Our approach is fully implemented and <b>tested</b> <b>on</b> a shopping <b>request</b> identification problem both in simulation and on a real robot. Compared with existing approaches using P-log or POMDPs individually, we observe significant im-provements in both efficiency and accuracy. ...|$|R
