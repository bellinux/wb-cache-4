5|$|On the November 19, 1999, {{episode of}} Millionaire, Carpenter {{proceeded}} {{to advance to}} the million-dollar question without using any lifelines.

Carpenter answered the question correctly and became the show's first millionaire. His win gave him national recognition and led to multiple talk show appearances, as well as reappearances on Millionaire itself.|$|E

Dumbledore tells Harry it is not polite for a wizard to apparate (appear out of thin air) directly into another wizard's house. However, Harry uses floo powder to cause his head into Grimmauld Place unannounced.

500|$|With Benson's help, Walpole {{had come}} to terms with the loss of his faith. Somerset Walpole, himself the son of an Anglican priest, hoped that his eldest son would follow him into the ministry. Walpole was too {{concerned}} for his father's feelings to <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> was no longer a believer, and on graduation from Cambridge in 1906 he took a post as a lay missioner at the Mersey Mission to Seamen in Liverpool. He described that as one of the [...] "greatest failures of my life... The Mission to Seamen was, and is, a splendid institution... but it needs men of a certain type to carry it through and I was not of that type." [...] The head of the mission reprimanded him for lack of commitment to his work, and Walpole resigned after six months.|$|E

Restrained Marko will be given subdermal silicon transplants giving him a hardened untraceable silicon armor.

Hammerhead and Osborn take him outside in their limousine, where Marko is able to reform himself in his old appearance. When they <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> will work for [...] "the Big Man," [...] but he decides to go alone and leaves.

500|$|Robinson's {{parents were}} poor tenant farmers {{who worked in}} the tobacco fields as sharecroppers. The family used an outhouse, drew water from a cistern, and did laundry in a {{cast-iron}} tub over an open flame. Their house did not have running water until Robinson was ten years old. When Robinson was born, he was so seriously ill that the doctor was certain he would not survive. He was temporarily paralyzed from birth and his head was misshapen. So likely was Robinson's death that the physician asked Robinson's father Charles for a name for the baby's birth and death certificates. Robinson's parents were young (his mother Imogene was twenty) and they were hoping for a girl. They named the baby [...] "Vicky Gene Robinson" [...] for Charles' father Victor and the baby's mother Imogene. For a long time, Robinson's parents believed the boy would die soon. Much later in life, Robinson's father would <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> couldn't take any joy in the boy's development because he always thought each step {{was going to be the}} last thing. Robinson's parents were and still are members of a small Disciples of Christ congregation. Robinson describes his childhood as very religious. Robinson had perfect Sunday School attendance for thirteen years.|$|E
500|$|Until mid-1888, Foraker had the {{enthusiastic}} support of Hanna, who, while still boosting John Sherman for president, was a generous {{contributor to the}} governor's 1885 and 1887 campaigns. [...] Hanna hoped {{to be able to}} dispense patronage in northern Ohio. [...] According to Hanna biographer William T. Horner, however, [...] "unfortunately for Hanna, Foraker largely refused to grant Hanna the authority that by tradition he probably had earned." [...] One example, later cited by Foraker as a reason his close relationship with Hanna ended, was the question of the position of state oil inspector, whose substantial fees were paid, not by the taxpayer, but by the oil companies, and who was permitted to appoint large numbers of deputies. [...] In 1885, soon after Foraker's inauguration, Hanna advocated the appointment of William M. Bayne, while Congressman McKinley pressed the name of Edwin Hartshorn. [...] Hanna agreed to withdraw Bayne, not to accommodate McKinley, but to save Foraker from a difficulty. [...] Hanna wrote to Foraker, [...] "I had a call from Major McKinley and his oil inspector candidate. ... I <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> 'wants the earth'..." [...] However, Foraker instead reappointed the incumbent, Louis Smithnight. [...] One of the men appointed deputy oil inspector was Harry Smith, the black editor who had supported Foraker in the 1885 election. [...] McKinley again approached Foraker after his re-election in 1887 seeking Hartshorn's appointment; however, Foraker appointed George B. Cox, Republican boss of Cincinnati, as chief though Smithnight was retained as a deputy. [...] In later years, Foraker suggested the dispute over the oil inspectorship was a reason for Hanna breaking from him and allying with McKinley, stating after Hanna's death in 1904, [...] "I have often thought since that my appointment of Cox made McKinley president." ...|$|E
