2500|$|This was {{the first}} time an organic {{compound}} was artificially synthesized from inorganic starting materials, without the involvement of living organisms. [...] The results of this experiment implicitly discredited vitalism— the theory that the chemicals of living organisms are fundamentally different from those of inanimate matter. [...] This insight was important for the development of organic chemistry. His discovery prompted Wöhler to write triumphantly to Berzelius: [...] "I must tell you <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> urea without the use of kidneys, either man or dog. Ammonium cyanate is urea." [...] In fact, this was incorrect. These are two different chemicals, which are in chemical equilibrium heavily favoring urea under standard conditions. Regardless, with his discovery, Wöhler secured a place among the pioneers of organic chemistry.|$|E
2500|$|The news {{shocked and}} split the magician {{community}} in Kerala. Before {{the commencement of}} the act, internationally acclaimed magician Samraj advised Mohanlal against performing the stunt. Samraj approached the Association of Malayalam Movie Artists (AMMA) with a memorandum signed by 300 magicians, requesting it to urge Mohanlal {{to withdraw from the}} performance. AMMA president and actor Innocent, requested Mohanlal to withdraw from the stunt from endangering himself. He said [...] "Mohanlal is a pillar of the Malayalam film industry; he has no right to go and do such a risky show". The stunt was also to inspire the youth to overcome debacles in life with sheer determination. Briefing about the act in the press conference organised in Trivandrum, Mohanlal said [...] "The risk factor is fifty-fifty for the escape act. I hope <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> it with the blessings of all". About the objective of the act, the Merlin Award winning magician Gopinath Muthukad said [...] "Counted {{as one of the most}} dangerous acts, the 'Burning Illusion' will find Mohanlal inspiring the youth to overcome debacles in life with sheer determination. He has been practising for a while to perfect it".|$|E
2500|$|Following ALFs conclusion, Clausen was {{unemployed}} {{for seven}} months. Clausen's friend suggested {{him to a}} producer from the Fox animated series The Simpsons who {{were looking for a}} new composer. Clausen [...] "had no interest in doing animation" [...] and [...] "wanted to be a drama composer." [...] However, the show's creator Matt Groening told him [...] "we don't look upon this as being a cartoon but a drama where the characters are drawn, and we would like it scored that way." [...] Clausen took the job. Groening told Clausen that the [...] "emotion [...] scored first and the action scored second", unlike many other cartoons, and that [...] "scoring the emotions of the characters" [...] was the primary aim for The Simpsons. Clausen's first episode was [...] "Treehouse of Horror", the third episode of season two, in 1990. It served as an audition and he was hired permanently after that. He has since scored almost all of the music and songs which have appeared on the show, across a wide range of musical styles {{through the end of the}} 28th season. He conducted a 35 piece orchestra for the music, a rarity for television shows, and recorded the score for an episode every week. Clausen wrote an episode's score during the week, recorded it on a Friday, with some variation if vocals are required. The limited timeframe proved the most challenging aspect of the job for Clausen; he was once required to write 57musical cues in one week. For the show's original songs production is much longer; Clausen records the music to the writers' lyrics, over seven or eight months the scene is animated, and then Clausen can re-record the song with a full orchestra. The full orchestra allows easy transition between the wide range of musical styles required for the show. Clausen noted: [...] "The greatest composing challenge has been to try to make some kind of musical sense out of the cues when I have only a few seconds to make a musical statement. We have a joke on the scoring stage <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> you feel five ways in thirteen seconds. We say it in jest, but the reality of the situation is that I am required to do just that quite often." [...] Clausen intentionally opted against composing themes for each character, with some exceptions such as Mr. Burns, and instead [...] " [...] each story its own theme and thematic development...That approach helps to give each story its own special identification, more like individual mini-movies." [...] He supplements the orchestra with additional instruments, such as extra brass for the episode [...] "Cape Feare", for which Clausen composed Sideshow Bob's theme, which continued to be played whenever Bob gets out of prison in subsequent episodes. It is based on the score of the movie Cape Fear, composed by Bernard Herrmann. The musical requests of the writers range from rerecord a specific piece of music to compose something based on this character's emotion in a scene.|$|E
