40|$|International audienceSerpentinized oceanic {{lithosphere}} may be {{an important}} source for boron and other fluid-mobile elements that are anomalously enriched in arc volcanic rocks. However, the integrated water/rock ratios associated with different styles of serpentinization may be variable. For example, large water/rock ratios are involved in the serpentinization of abyssal peridotites exhumed to the seafloor, whereas much lower water/rock ratios are likely to dictate serpentinization along deep faults and fractures. To address how fluid-mobile element enrichments vary with serpentinization at different settings, we investigated serpentinized harzburgites from the Feather River Ophiolite (FRO) in northern California. Major and trace element systematics indicate that serpentinization of the FRO ultramafics involved seawater. However, FRO serpentinites have unradiogenic Os isotopic compositions and near-chondritic platinum group element relative abundances, contrasting with serpentinized abyssal peridotites, which have radiogenic Os isotopic compositions and disturbed platinum group element systematics. These observations indicate that the integrated water/rock ratio involved in FRO serpentinization was smaller than that involved in abyssal peridotite serpentinization. B concentrations in the FRO (5 – 15 ppm), while substantially higher than primitive mantle (< 0. 1 ppm), are still lower than in abyssal peridotites (10 – 170 ppm). These low values are not due to metamorphic loss as there is no petrographic evidence for prograde metamorphism (the serpentine minerals are low temperature forms like chrysotile and lizardite) and there is no consistency between observed fluid-mobile element (B, As, Pb, and Li) contents and depletions predicted from metamorphic dehydration models. Low B and fluid-mobile element contents in the FRO may thus be an intrinsic feature of low water/rock ratio serpentinization. Such values may be more representative of serpentinized oceanic lithospheric mantle rather than abyssal peridotites, which sample only the <b>top</b> <b>veneer</b> of the lithosphere...|$|E

Originally, an ébéniste was one {{who worked with}} ebony, a favoured luxury wood for mid-seventeenth century Parisian cabinets, originating in imitation of elite furniture being made in Antwerp. The word is 17th century in origin. Early Parisian ébénistes often came from the Low Countries themselves: an outstanding example is Pierre Golle, {{who worked at the}} Gobelins manufactory making cabinets and table <b>tops</b> <b>veneered</b> with marquetry, the traditional enrichment of ébénisterie, or [...] "cabinet-work".|$|R
5000|$|The Les Paul Standard PlusTop PRO is {{a version}} of the Epiphone Les Paul Standard. It has ProBucker-2 and ProBucker-3 pickups with coil-tapping, which distinguishes it from the regular Standard PlusTop. PAF humbuckers were the {{original}} humbuckers from 1957, which were not perfect, since the coils were not wound perfectly, which created an out-of-phase sound that is associated with the era. The ProBucker is designed to replicate that out-of-phase 1950s sound. However, the coil-tapping feature allows one to turn this sound on or off. Like the Standard PlusTop, this guitar features a flame maple <b>veneer</b> <b>top.</b> There are multiple available color finishes including Honeyburst (inspired by late '50s vintage Les Pauls), Heritage Cherry Sunburst, Trans Blue, Vintage Sunburst and Wine Red. The body is nato (with the maple <b>veneer</b> <b>top),</b> the neck is hand-set nato, with a rosewood fingerboard. The scale is 24.75". [...] The Les Paul Standard Quilt Top PRO is identical but has a quilted <b>top</b> maple <b>veneer</b> finish and is only available in Trans Blue and Faded Cherry Sunburst colors.|$|R

50|$|Cedrela odorata is {{the most}} commercially {{important}} and widely distributed species in the genus Cedrela. Known as Spanish cedar in English commerce, the aromatic wood is in high demand in the American tropics because it is naturally termite- and rot-resistant. An attractive, moderately lightweight wood (specific gravity 0.4), its primary use is in household articles used to store clothing. Cedro heartwood contains an aromatic and insect-repelling resin that {{is the source of}} its popular name, Spanish-cedar (it resembles the aroma of true cedars (Cedrus spp.) Cedro works easily and makes excellent plywood and veneer and would be more widely used if it could be successfully plantation grown. This plant is often used for honey production (beekeeping) and humidor construction. It is occasionally used for <b>tops</b> or <b>veneers</b> on some kinds of electric guitars. The wood is the traditional choice for making the neck of flamenco and classical guitars.|$|R

It was the first post-CBS era Fender guitar to feature an ebony fingerboard with abalone dot position markers (some earlier models came with regular white dots). Introduced in 1990, it was discontinued in 1997.|$|R
50|$|It is a weak {{wood with}} low decay {{resistance}} and moderate dimensional stability. The major use of Gaboon {{is in the}} manufacture of plywood. It is about 8- 12% lighter than the other main marine plywood Meranti that is commonly used in boatbuilding, but is not as stiff. This is useful when a boat design calls for tight radius bends such as near the bow in a single chine design because of its flexibility. However it does not resist impact damage as well as Meranti and is often sheathed in epoxy resin to increase strength and give more impact and abrasion resistance and to increase water resistance over conventional marine enamel paints. It is often used in sandwich construction using the West (and other similar) epoxy system. Its attractive appearance means that it is often used decoratively as the <b>top</b> surface <b>veneer</b> in panelling and furniture or, in solid form in luxury items such as boxes for cigars or other high value items (e.g. audio equipment).|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of material comprising a modern guitar is still wood. Typical woods {{used for the}} body and neck of a guitar today are Mahogany, Ash, Maple, Basswood, Agathis, Alder, Poplar, Walnut, Spruce, and holly. Woods {{from around the world}} are also incorporated into modern acoustic and electric guitars. Some of these exotic tone woods include Koa, Rosewood, Bubinga, Korina, Lacewood, Zebrawood, Padouk, Redwood, and Wenge. With modern manufacturing techniques almost any wood can be used if it can be obtained in an acceptable quantity. Abundance, however, is not the only characteristic taken into consideration during the selection of a type of wood. Woods have unique acoustic properties and produce different sounds and resonances at different frequencies and points. Wood grain, pattern and defects (understand defects as genetic defects of the tree like quilt, flame...) also are factors that contribute to the beautification of the instrument and thus, to increase the sales. This happens specially on guitar <b>tops</b> or <b>veneers.</b>|$|R

50|$|Although {{the use of}} two {{or three}} layers of wood veneer is ancient, modern 4' x 8' sheets of plywood with 5-11 core layers of veneer were invented in the early 20th century, and began to become common by the Second World War. During the war, {{phenolic}} resin was more readily accessible than <b>top</b> grade wood <b>veneer</b> in Germany, and Luftwaffe pilot and inventor Max Himmelheber played a role in making the first sheets of particleboard, which were little more than pourings of floor sweepings, wood chips, and ground up off-cuts and glue. The first commercial piece was produced during World War II at a factory in Bremen, Germany. For its production, waste material was used - such as planer shavings, offcuts or sawdust - hammer-milled into chips and bound together with a phenolic resin. Hammer-milling involves smashing material into smaller and smaller pieces until they can pass through a screen. Most other early particleboard manufacturers used similar processes, though often with slightly different resins.|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of domesticating and integrating high value fruit trees in agricultural landscapes by farmers is increasingly being {{recognized in the}} humid tropics. However in an agroforestry context, the growth attributes of intercropped trees above and belowground determine whether the association will be complementary or competitive. The focus of the present research was on two African indigenous fruit tree species (Dacryodes edulis G. Don) H. J. Lam (Burseraceae) and Allanblackia floribunda Oliv. (Clusiaceae), which are currently under domestication, and have high food, income and environmental security values. On D. edulis, the thrust was to assess and compare the structural and fine rooting systems together with the aboveground growth attributes of fruiting trees propagated sexually and vegetatively, while on A. floribunda, {{the focus was on}} how to reduce the long juvenile phase of about 10 - 12 years before first fruiting to less than 5 years through grafting techniques. The results of the investigations on D. edulis indicate that trees of seed origin were characterized by a tap root, reaching depths of about 1. 20 m, whereas, trees of cutting origin showed three strong vertical roots (d > 5 mm) with the longest reaching depths of 1. 31 m. Similarly, trees of marcot origin were observed to have thick, relatively short prominent vertical roots, reaching depths of 1. 15 m. In addition, trees of seed origin had greater fine root density (RD) (P ≤ 0. 001) than trees of vegetative origin (cuttings and marcots) in the upper soil stratum (0 - 30 cm). Trees of seed origin were also shown to have an exponential distribution pattern for fine root density and root length within depth to 80 cm. In contrast, the distribution pattern of fine roots of trees of vegetative origin (cuttings and marcots) were quadratic for the same variables which increased in the 20 - 30 cm soil depth stratum before declining steadily to a depth of 80 cm. Furthermore, shoot density, defined as, number of shoots per tree, and height differed significantly (p= 0. 004 and p= 0. 005, respectively) amongst tree origins. Trees of seed and cutting origins had single-stem shoots whereas marcots had 6 shoots per tree on average. Trees of cutting origin grew tallest, with mean height of 8. 4 ± 2. 2 m compared to 6. 7 ± 0. 9 m and 7. 6 ± 1. 9 m for trees of marcot or seed origins respectively. Mean carbon (C) sequestration estimated using allometric models differed significantly (p= 0. 014) between trees of vegetative origin and those of seed origin, with 10 years old D. edulis trees of cutting and marcot origins sequestrating averagely 26. 8 ± 19. 1 Mg C ha- 1 and 21. 74 ± 12. 8 Mg C ha- 1 respectively over 10 years, compared to 13. 10 ± 9. 4 Mg C ha- 1 for trees of seed origin. In summary, the results from the studies on D. edulis suggest that vegetative propagation on the species, besides reducing the long juvenile phase to fruiting and maintaining trueness in the transfer of desirable traits over generations, also results in trees that are apparently less competitive for belowground resources. In addition, vegetative propagated trees of D. edulis were shown to have apparently stable root system and the trees bigger in stature and higher in carbon sinks than trees of seed origin. In parallel, A. floribunda scions were taken from female trees, and grafted onto rootstocks using side tongue, <b>top</b> cleft, side <b>veneer,</b> and whip-and-tongue methods under nursery conditions. In a separate experiment, side tongue and inverted ‘T’ budding methods were also tested in situ on young A. floribunda wildings growing under semi-deciduous and evergreen tree covers. In addition, the effects of protecting side tongue grafts with non-perforated, translucent plastic, perforated translucent plastic and aluminium foil were assessed. A. floribunda was shown to be amenable to grafting both under nursery and field (in situ) conditions. Under nursery conditions, side tongue grafts were significantly more successful (80. 0 ± 6. 3 %), than grafts of side veneer (52. 5 ± 7. 9 %), top cleft (55. 0 ± 7. 9 %) and whip–and-tongue (50. 0 ± 7. 9 %). The success of side tongue grafts was further increased (86. 7 ± 6. 2 %) under evergreen shade when grafts were protected by non-perforated translucent plastic. A grafted A. floribunda tree transplanted in the field in 2007 flowered and carried a single fruit to maturity after 4 years, thereby reducing the long juvenile period to first fruit production of about 10 - 12 years reported in literature to less than 5 years. In conclusion, the effect of propagation methods on the belowground and aboveground growth attributes and their C storage potential studied in the present research on D. edulis, have not yet been studied and published anywhere according to the authors knowledge. Similarly, the reduced long juvenile period to first fruit production to less than 5 years in A. floribunda grafts reported in this research is the first published prove of concept on this species according to the author’s knowledge. Therefore, the research results presented in this thesis should be considered as pilot case studies aimed at obtaining insights into the effect of vegetative propagation methods on the above and belowground growth and development of improved planting materials of these two African indigenous fruit trees (Dacryodes edulis and Allanblackia floribunda) under domestication...|$|R
