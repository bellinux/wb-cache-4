30|$|The {{results for}} the 5 and 10  % {{treatment}} levels with 10 -year planning horizon with TFI are described in Fig.  4. This figure shows that for each <b>treatment</b> <b>level,</b> {{the result of the}} exact MIP approach and the exact single-period problem shows no substantial difference.|$|E
30|$|There are {{two phases}} when using this {{approach}} {{for the case}} study. Phase 1 (an exact method for the single-period problem) is a preliminary stage before the Phase 2 approach (an exact MIP approach) is executed. In Phase 1, the ‘old treatment units’ in the landscape are identified. The purpose of Phase 1 is to handle any infeasibility that might arise based on the initial data, by burning the old treatment units. This phase is necessary for ensuring feasibility of the Phase 2 approach. Infeasibility may arise due to conflicting constraints, especially constraints (4), (7) and (8). Constraints (4) and (7) in the Phase 2 approach require that all ‘old treatment units’ must be treated. However, treating all of these old treatment units (in this case, 35  % of the total treatable area in the landscape, {{as can be seen}} in Fig. 6 a would violate Constraint (8) if the <b>treatment</b> <b>level</b> is set lower than 35  %. In practice, it would also be costly and impractical to treat such a large amount of land in a single year. Moreover, The 2009 Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission nominates a target of 5  % of the public land to be treated each year across the state in order to reduce the threat of fire for the coming fire season (Teague et al. 2010). Using a 5  % <b>treatment</b> <b>level</b> across the case study area means that imposing the maximum TFI leads to infeasibility of the Phase 2 approach. Therefore, to reduce the number of ‘old treatment units’ and achieve feasibility first, in Phase 1 the <b>treatment</b> <b>level</b> must be increased. For Phase 1 of the case study, a <b>treatment</b> <b>level</b> of 7  % of the total area of the landscape each year is imposed. Interestingly, (Penman et al. 2011) note that when more than 7  % of the total area has been burnt by prescribed fire, the total area burnt by unplanned fire will be close to zero.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity {{disorder}} (ADHD) {{has been}} associated with dopaminergic imbalance and subtle volume decreases in the brain. Stimulants acutely enhance dopaminergic neurotransmission. Long-term effects of prolonged manipulation of the dopaminergic system on brain structure remain poorly understood; they could be beneficial or unfavorable and could be moderated by common genetic variants and/or age. Method: In a large observational ADHD cohort study (N = 316), the effects of cumulative stimulant treatment, genotype (for DAT 1 haplotype and DRD 4 variants), and treatment-by-genotype interactions on striatal, frontal, and hippocampal volumes and their interactions with age were evaluated. Results: No main effects of treatment were found. Associations between treatment and bilateral frontal and left hippocampal volume depended on DRD 4 genotype and age. At a younger age and lower <b>treatment</b> <b>levels,</b> but not at a younger age and higher <b>treatment</b> <b>levels,</b> carriers of the DRD 4 7 R allele showed decreased frontal cortex volumes. At an older age, carriers and non-carriers showed smaller frontal volumes irrespective of treatment history. Left hippocampal volume was similar to that in controls at average <b>treatment</b> <b>levels</b> and increased with treatment only in carriers of the DRD 4 risk allele and at a younger age. No interaction effects were found in the striatum. Conclusion: Carriers of the DRD 4 risk allele at a younger age might be sensitive to cortical remodeling after stimulant treatment. The cross-sectional nature of this study warrants cautious interpretation of age effects. The present findings, although of small effect size, might ultimately contribute to optimal care for individuals with ADHD...|$|R
