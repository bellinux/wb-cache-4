50|$|In 1978, Shallcrass joined an Alexandrian Wiccan coven, being {{initiated}} a High Priest the following year. During {{the course of}} that year, he had been writing seasonal festival rites for the coven. These were heavily influenced by his studies in Druidry. By the time <b>the</b> <b>festival</b> <b>cycle</b> was complete, the coven's celebrations had become so Druidic in flavour that the members agreed to stop calling themselves a coven and become instead a Grove; the Grove of the Badger. This is now seen as the Mother Grove of the British Druid Order (BDO).|$|E
50|$|The frescoes {{were not}} {{carried out at}} the same time and by the same artists. They are dated between 1385 and 1387. The middle-register frescoes, which are of the highest artistic value were painted by two artists, one of them known as Constantine, who left his {{signature}} on a fresco of a warrior saint. The noteworthy compositions include the Communion of the Apostles and the Adoration of the Lamb in the altar apse, as well as <b>the</b> <b>festival</b> <b>Cycle</b> in the upper registers of the church. The Ktitor's composition was later repainted, and a fresco of Lazar's death was added. It also depicts Princess Milica and their sons Vuk and Stefan.|$|E

Of particular importance is the Nemanjić dynasty genealogy, the first ever painted, which starts with Stefan Nemanja and ends with Milutin. Also in the narthex, there is an exhaustive illustration of the Last Judgment. The scenes {{from the life of}} St. Nicholas are in the north parecclesion, while the walls of the south one display scenes from the Old Testament and the lives of Christ and the Mother of God. The master painters supposedly were Michael and Eutihije with their assistants.|$|E
40|$|In this dissertation, I {{demonstrate}} how improvisations within {{the structures of}} performance during Montserrat’s annual festivals produce “rhythms of change” {{that contribute to the}} formation of cultural identities. Montserrat is a small island of 39. 5 square miles in the Caribbean’s Leeward Islands, and a volcanic disaster in the 1990 s led to the loss of villages, homes, and material possessions. The crisis resulted in mass displacement and emigration, and today’s remaining population of 5, 000 is now in a stage of post-volcano redevelopment. The reliability of written archives for establishing cultural knowledge is tenuous, and the community is faced with re-energizing cherished cultural traditions. This ethnographic research traces my embodied search for Montserrat’s history through an archive that is itself intangible and performative. Festivals produce some of the island’s most visible and culturally political events, and music and dance performances prompt on- and off-stage discussions about the island’s multifaceted heritage. <b>The</b> <b>festival</b> <b>cycle</b> provides the structure for ongoing renegotiations {{of what it means to}} be “Montserratian. ” I focus especially on the island’s often-discussed and debated “triangular” heritage of Irishness, Africanness, and Montserratianness as it is performed during the festivals. Through my meanderings along the winding hilly roads of Montserrat, I explored reconfigurations of cultural memory through the island’s masquerade dance tradition and other festival celebrations. In this work, I introduce a “Cast of Characters,” each of whose scholarly, artistic, and public service work on Montserrat contributes to the shape and transformation of the island’s post-volcano cultural identities today. This dissertation is about the kinesthetic transmission of shared (and sometimes unshared) cultural knowledge, the substance of which echoes in the rhythms of Montserrat’s music and dance practices today...|$|E

My case study of <b>the</b> Queensland Music <b>Festival</b> focuses on <b>the</b> organisa-tion’s open and collaborative culture which enhances the creation and transfer of tacit knowledge among the entire staff (permanent and seasonal employees) throughout the different stages of <b>the</b> <b>festival</b> life <b>cycle.</b> <b>The</b> findings will help <b>festival</b> managers under-stand <b>the</b> importance of knowledge management embedded in an organisational culture that supports new ideas, knowledge creation and thus innovation...|$|R
40|$|In {{the myths}} and rituals of south Indian Hindu temples {{dedicated}} to the great god Shiva and his consort Devi, the goddess, the marital relationship between them is a central theme. In many temples, too, the wedding of the god and goddess is a highlight of <b>the</b> annual <b>festival</b> <b>cycle,</b> and nowhere is this {{more evident than in}} the city of Madurai in Tamilnadu, whose Great Temple is {{dedicated to the}} goddess Minakshi and her husband Sundareshwara, a form of Shiva. In the Minakshi temple (as it is popularly called), the climax of its principal annual <b>festival</b> - <b>the</b> Chittirai <b>festival</b> - is <b>the</b> celebration of the divine couple's wedding. This festival is also renowned because it unfolds alongside another Chittirai festival celebrated for Kallalagar, a form of the great god Vishnu, who is said to be Minakshi's brother in accordance with the popular Tamil notion that Shiva and Vishnu are brothers-in-law linked by the goddess. The 'double festival' of Chittirai is therefore a deservedly famous example of the centrality of marriage in south Indian temple Hinduism...|$|R

40|$|The Great Temple at Madurai, Tamilnadu, {{formally}} {{known as}} the Arulmiku ('grace-bestowing') Minaksi-Sundaresvara Tirukkoyil ('temple'), {{is dedicated to the}} goddess Minaksi and her husband, the god Sundaresvara, who is a form of Siva. In Madurai, the goddess rather than the god is pre-eminent, and their temple is popularly called the 'Minaksi temple'. The Minaksi temple has a very complex <b>festival</b> <b>cycle,</b> but it includes only a few relatively minor events held solely or mainly for Sundaresvara; most festivals are celebrated for Minaksi and Sundaresvara jointly, or for the goddess alone. The most notable of Sundaresvara's own <b>festivals</b> is <b>the</b> Pavitra <b>festival,</b> <b>the</b> subject of this article. Although this festival is untypical of ritual activity in the Minaksi temple, it does raise questions of wider significance about ritual mistakes and the relationship between Siva and his priests, which I shall be examining...|$|R

In the Hindu tradition, the Shiva-linked ascetic warriors (Nagas) get the honor of starting the event by entering the sangam first for bathing and prayers.|$|R
