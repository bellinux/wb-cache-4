5|$|Seeds are {{the primary}} way that trees {{reproduce}} and their seeds vary greatly in size and shape.

5|$|Similar to {{the decline}} over time in wives as being portrayed solely as housekeepers, the {{portrayal}} of mothers as the primary physical care takers of children {{has been on the}} decline.

40|$|Through {{environmentally}} induced maternal effects females may fine-tune <b>their</b> <b>offspring's</b> phenotype to {{the conditions}} offspring will encounter after birth. If juvenile and adult ecologies differ, the conditions mothers experienced as juveniles may better predict <b>their</b> <b>offspring's</b> environment than the adult females' conditions. Maternal effects induced by the environment experienced by females during their early ontogeny should evolve when three ecological conditions are met: (1) Adult ecology does not predict the postnatal environmental conditions of offspring; (2) Environmental conditions for juveniles are correlated across successive generations; and (3) Juveniles occasionally settle in conditions that differ from the juvenile habitat of their mothers. By combining size-structured population counts, ecological surveys and a genetic analysis of population structure we provide evidence that all three conditions hold for Simochromis pleurospilus, a cichlid fish in which mothers adjust <b>offspring</b> quality to <b>their</b> own juvenile ecology. In particular we show (1) that the spatial niches and the habitat quality differ between juveniles and adults, and we provide genetic evidence (2) that usually fish of successive generations grow up in similar habitats, and (3) that occasional dispersal in populations with a different habitat quality is likely to occur. As adults of many species cannot predict <b>their</b> <b>offspring's</b> environment from ambient cues, life-stage specific maternal effects...|$|R

5|$|A {{mammalian}} virus, {{the rabbit}} haemorrhagic disease virus {{was introduced to}} Australia to attempt to control the European rabbit populations there.

40|$|Background A {{consistent}} {{association between}} paternal age and <b>their</b> <b>offspring's</b> risk of schizophrenia has been observed, with no independent association with maternal age.

5|$|All slow loris species {{produce a}} toxin in glands on {{the insides of}} their elbows.

However, the primary method of predator avoidance is crypsis, whereby it hides. The Asiatic reticulated python, the changeable hawk-eagle and the Bornean orangutan have been recorded as predators of the Sunda slow loris.|$|E
5|$|Although {{juvenile}} {{and adult}} J.lagostoma are almost exclusively terrestrial, the larvae are marine and planktonic.

In {{most members of the}} family Gecarcinidae, migration coincides with the rainy season, which reduces the risk of desiccation; migration in J.lagostoma occurs from January until March, while the period of highest rainfall is from March to May.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{development}} of insulin resistance is multifactorial, with maternal pre- and postnatal nutrition having significant influences. In this regard, high fat diet (HFD) feeding in pregnancy {{has been shown}} to increase risks of metabolic diseases. Thus, we investigated the effects of supplementation of HFD with germinated brown rice (GBR) and GBR-derived gamma oryzanol-rich extract (OE) on insulin resistance and its epigenetic implications in pregnant rats and <b>their</b> <b>offsprings.</b> Methods Pregnant female Sprague dawley rats were fed with HFD alone, HFD + GBR or HFD + OE (100 or 200 mg/kg/day) throughout pregnancy and lactation. <b>Their</b> <b>offsprings</b> were weaned at 4 weeks post-delivery and were followed up until 8 weeks. Serum levels of adipokines were measured in dams and <b>their</b> <b>offsprings,</b> and global DNA methylation and histone acetylation patterns were estimated from the liver. Results The dams and offsprings of the GBR and OE groups had lower weight gain, glycemic response, 8 -Iso prostaglandin, retinol binding protein 4 and fasting insulin, and elevated adiponectin levels compared with the HFD group. Fasting leptin levels were lower only in the GBR groups. Hepatic global DNA methylation was lower in the GBR groups while hepatic H 4 acetylation was lower in both GBR and OE dams. In the offsprings, DNA methylation and H 4 acetylation were only lower in the OE group. However, dams and offsprings of the GBR and OE groups had higher hepatic H 3 acetylation. Conclusions GBR and OE can be used as functional ingredients for the amelioration of HFD-induced epigeneticallymediated insulin resistance...|$|R

This review aimed to see prevalence of anemia, mainly iron deficiency anemia (IDA), diet management mainly for young children and pregnant women.
