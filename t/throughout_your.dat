He liked its graphics but wrote that its music [...] "isn’t too hot". Buchanan enjoyed its multiplayer component and wrote that [...] "the slowdown when all four join in is minima—nice programming {{on the part of}} Looking Glass".

Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot wrote, [...] "Graphically, Destruction Derby 64 surpasses the old PlayStation games by quite a bit - not that that is a particularly hard thing to do". He found that its framerate was adequate even in split-screen mode, and concluded that it was [...] "a better game than its PlayStation counterparts". He finished, [...] "Give it a rent next time you're rounding up the posse for a day of gaming." ...|$|E
500|$|Virtue {{ethics is}} a form of ethical theory which {{emphasizes}} the character of an agent, rather than specific acts; many of its proponents have criticised Kant's deontological approach to ethics. Elizabeth Anscombe criticised modern ethical theories, including Kantian ethics, for their obsession with law and obligation. As well as arguing that theories which rely on a universal moral law are too rigid, Anscombe suggested that, because a moral law implies a moral lawgiver, they are irrelevant in modern secular society. In his work After Virtue, Alasdair MacIntyre criticises Kant's formulation of universalisability, arguing that various trivial and immoral maxims can pass the test, such as [...] "Keep all your promises <b>throughout</b> <b>your</b> entire life except one". He further challenges Kant's formulation of humanity {{as an end in itself}} by arguing that Kant provided no reason to treat others as means: the maxim [...] "Let everyone except me be treated as a means", though seemingly immoral, can be universalized. Bernard Williams argues that, by abstracting persons from character, Kant misrepresents persons and morality and Philippa Foot identified Kant as one of a select group of philosophers responsible for the neglect of virtue by analytic philosophy.|$|E

This is the second lowest score on Metacritic, above only Kevin Federline's album Playing with Fire. According to AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine, [...] "the music has no melody, hooks, or energy, [...] all {{attention is focused on}} the clown jumping up and down and screaming in front, and long before the record is over, you're left wondering, how the hell did he ever get to put this mess out?". In a review of Limp Bizkit's Greatest Hitz compilation, Erlewine called [...] "Behind Blue Eyes" [...] the worst in the band's [...] "never-ending series of embarrassing covers". Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian wrote, [...] "Durst's problems are ever-present - and does anybody still care?". Stylus criticized Results May Vary, calling it [...] "an album that {{can only be described as}} abysmal". Rob O'Connor of Yahoo! Launch also criticized Results May Vary: [...] "No, Fred, the results don't vary. The results are consistent <b>throughout</b> <b>your</b> new album—consistently crappy." [...] Kitty Empire of The Guardian wrote, [...] "Limp Bizkit have decided to expose their tender side. They really shouldn't have bothered [...] having seen Limp Bizkit's 'other side', you want the old, unapologetic, meathead version back". Scott Mervis of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette also criticized Results May Vary: [...] "Results May Vary has a few highlights — 'Almost Over' (very Everlast) and 'Phenomenon' (very Primus) — but way too few to justify all the time and energy spent".|$|E

And thus, since some executions require kindling a fire, the Baraita taught that the law prohibits executions on the Sabbath.|$|E

40|$|Professor Brailsford our Vice-Chancellor {{has asked}} me {{to thank you for}} the {{invitation}} to provide comments on the AQHE Performance Indicators Discussion Papers and has {{asked me to}} reply to you on his behalf. Overall Bond University is very supportive of performance measurement and benchmarking and makes extensive use of such data. However {{we have a number of}} concerns with the discussion papers, the most significant of which may be summarised as follows: 1. There is overlap between the existing and proposed new instruments. We consider more attention should be given to avoiding duplication, overlap and over surveying. 2. Now that reward funding has been removed, the usefulness of the UES as constructed should be reexamined. 3. In order to achieve rapid implementation of MyUniversity, accuracy has suffered. It is recommended that sufficient time be allowed to ensure the data are accurate. 4. Because Bond is small, some of our courses will not have sufficient responses to give a statistically reliable response. Where that is so, we recommend the data be not shown on MyUniversity. 5. Bond supports centralised administration of surveys to enable consistent methodology; however we think that to maintain good relationships with students and keep response rates up, responsibility for delivering communications regarding the surveys should remain with individual institutions. Further details of the above points and answers to the discussion questions are provided in the following pages 2 – 7. Finally, Professor Brailsford asked me to advise that in the “Report on the Development of the University Experience Survey ” circulated earlier this week, in the table on pp. 33 - 34 some of the questions refer to “program of study/course ” and another question uses “course”.

2500|$|Rabbi Judah {{taught that}} many miracles {{attended}} the anointing oil that Moses {{made in the}} wilderness. There were originally only 12 logs (about a gallon) of the oil. Much of {{it must have been}} absorbed in the mixing pot, much must have been absorbed in the roots of the spices used, and much of it must have evaporated during cooking. Yet it was used to anoint the Tabernacle and its vessels, Aaron and his sons throughout the seven days of the consecration, and subsequent High Priests and kings. The Gemara deduced from [...] "This ( [...] , zeh) shall be a holy anointing oil unto Me <b>throughout</b> <b>your</b> generations," [...] that 12 logs existed. The Gemara calculated the numerical value of the Hebrew letters in the word , zeh ("this") to be 12 (employing Gematria, where [...] equals 7 and [...] equals 5), indicating that 12 logs of the oil were preserved throughout time..|$|E
2500|$|Rav Huna and Rav Chisda {{reconciled}} {{the prohibition}} of kindling fire on the Sabbath in [...] with the priests' sacrificial duties. The Mishnah taught that the priests could lower the Passover sacrifice into the oven just before nightfall (and leave it to roast on the Sabbath), and the priests could light the fire with chips in the pile in the Temple chamber of the hearth (just before nightfall). Interpreting this Mishnah, Rav Huna cited {{the prohibition of}} [...] "You shall kindle no fire <b>throughout</b> <b>your</b> habitations." [...] Rav Huna argued that since [...] says only [...] "throughout your habitations," [...] the priests could kindle the pile in the Temple chamber of the hearth (even on the Sabbath). Rav Chisda demurred from Rav Huna's argument, as it would allow kindling even on the Sabbath. Rather, Rav Chisda taught that [...] permits only the burning of the limbs and the fat (of animals sacrificed on Friday before nightfall). Rav Chisda explained that this burning was allowed because the priests were very particular (in their observance of the Sabbath and would not stoke the fire after nightfall).|$|E

Thus, real-time monitoring with functional transcranial Doppler (TCD) together with a specific mental task could control a brain-computer interface (BCI), thereby providing self-initiated interaction. The objective {{of this study was}} to create an automatic detection algorithm to dif-ferentiate hemodynamic responses coincident with one’s performance of verbal fluency (VF) versus counting tasks. We recruited 10 healthy adults who each silently performed up to 30 VF tasks and counted between each. Both middle cerebral arteries were simultaneously imaged using TCD. Linear Discriminant Analyses (LDA) successfully differentiated between VF and both prior and post counting tasks. For every participant, LDA achieved the 70 % clas-sification accuracy sufficient for BCIs. Results demonstrate automatic detection of a VF task by TCD and warrant further investigation of TCD as a BCI. ii Dedication To my late grandmother, Freda Stern, who made me feel at home in Toronto. iii Acknowledgements Thank you to Dr. Tom Chau for supervising this project and guiding me <b>throughout</b> it. <b>Your</b> unwavering support and dedication to your students is truly appreciated.
