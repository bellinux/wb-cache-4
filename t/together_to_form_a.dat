5|$|The {{production}} of energy at the core is the reason stars shine so brightly: every time two or more atomic nuclei fuse <b>together</b> <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> single atomic nucleus of a new heavier element, gamma ray photons are released from the nuclear fusion product. This energy is converted {{to other forms of}} electromagnetic energy of lower frequency, such as visible light, by the time it reaches the star's outer layers.|$|E
5|$|The two {{proteins}} can later fuse <b>together</b> <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> single polypeptide. Regardless {{of which}} protein comes first, this fusion protein may show similar function. Thus, if a fusion between two proteins occurs twice in evolution (either between paralogues {{within the same}} species or between orthologues in different species) but in a different order, the resulting fusion proteins will be related by a circular permutation.|$|E

5|$|As a child, Keenor had a keen {{interest}} in football, using tennis balls or rags tied <b>together</b> <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> ball, due to the expensive nature of footballs at the time, to play the game in his local streets. He attended Stacey Road primary school in Adamsdown and captained the school's football team for several years and he was later selected to represent the city of Cardiff's schoolboy team. One of his former teachers at the school, Walter Riden, would later go on to join the board at Cardiff City while Keenor was a player.|$|E
5|$|The {{body of a}} {{crustacean}} {{is composed}} of segments, which are grouped into three regions: the cephalon or head, the thorax, and the pleon or abdomen. The head and thorax may be fused <b>together</b> <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> cephalothorax, which may be covered by a single large carapace. The crustacean body is protected by the hard exoskeleton, which must be moulted for the animal to grow. The shell around each somite {{can be divided into}} a dorsal tergum, ventral sternum and a lateral pleuron. Various parts of the exoskeleton may be fused together.|$|E
5|$|While {{the layout}} of {{internal}} genital ducts and openings of the female genitalia depends upon the taxonomic group that insect belongs to, the internal female reproductive system of all lepidopterans consists of paired ovaries and accessory glands which produce the yolks and shells of the eggs. Female insects have a system of receptacles and ducts in which sperm is received, transported and stored. The oviducts of the female join <b>together</b> <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> common duct (called the 'oviductus communis') {{which leads to the}} vagina.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of 1140, Nigel, the Bishop of Ely, whose castles Stephen had confiscated the {{previous}} year, rebelled against Stephen as well. Nigel hoped to seize East Anglia and established his base of operations in the Isle of Ely, then surrounded by protective fenland. Stephen responded quickly, taking an army into the fens and using boats lashed <b>together</b> <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> causeway {{that allowed him to}} make a surprise attack on the isle. Nigel escaped to Gloucester, but his men and castle were captured, and order was temporarily restored in the east. Robert of Gloucester's men retook some of the territory that Stephen had taken in his 1139 campaign. In an effort to negotiate a truce, Henry of Blois held a peace conference at Bath, to which Stephen sent his wife. The conference collapsed over the insistence by Henry and the clergy that they should set the terms of any peace deal, which Stephen found unacceptable.|$|E
5|$|The nest of the dusky woodswallow {{consists}} of twigs, roots {{and other similar}} foliage matted <b>together</b> <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> bowl shape, which is lined with grass. It is positioned safely, behind bark, and/or high in a tree branch, and sometimes in a hollowed out tree stump. The nest is made {{during the period from}} August to January, {{and with the help of}} several birds. The mated pair will then guard the nest, while others will help them take care of the babies. The female lays white eggs, of which there are usually no more than three or four. While the incubation period lasts for sixteen days, the amount of time taken for fledgling can be this long to around twenty days.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{completing}} a mission, the player is awarded a rank, {{starting with the}} lowest at C and going to B, A and S, which is the highest. The ranks are based on three categories: Power, Technique, and Speed, each determined by meeting certain conditions in a battle. All three categories are rated {{on a scale from}} 0-150, and added <b>together</b> <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> numerical ranking from 0-450 in addition to their letter ranking; for example, any score between 300-450 earns an S ranking. Unlike previous games, the numerical score is not converted into points that can be redeemed to purchase new maps and COs; instead, COs are unlocked after the completion of certain missions and all maps (with the exception of training missions) are available at the beginning of gameplay.|$|E

5|$|Work on an {{alternative}} method of bomb design, known as implosion, had begun by Neddermeyer's E-5 (Implosion) group. Serber and Tolman had conceived implosion during the April 1943 conferences {{as a means}} of assembling pieces of fissionable material <b>together</b> <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> critical mass. Neddermeyer took a different tack, attempting to crush a hollow cylinder into a solid bar. The idea was to use explosives to crush a subcritical amount of fissile material into a smaller and denser form. When the fissile atoms are packed closer together, the rate of neutron capture increases, and they form a critical mass. The metal needs to travel only a very short distance, so the critical mass is assembled in much less time than it would take with the gun method. At the time, the idea of using explosives in this manner was quite novel. To facilitate the work, a small plant was established at the Anchor Ranch for casting explosive shapes.|$|E
5|$|Zinc and cadmium are {{electropositive}} while {{mercury is}} not. As a result, zinc and cadmium metal are good reducing agents. The elements of group 12 have an oxidation state of +2 {{in which the}} ions have the rather stable d10 electronic configuration, with a full sub-shell. However, mercury can easily be reduced to the +1 oxidation state; usually, as in the ion , two mercury(I) ions come <b>together</b> <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> metal-metal bond and a diamagnetic species. Cadmium can also form species such as 4− in which the metal's oxidation state is +1. Just as with mercury, {{the formation of a}} metal-metal bond results in a diamagnetic compound in which there are no unpaired electrons; thus, making the species very reactive. Zinc(I) is known only in the gas phase, in such compounds as linear Zn2Cl2, analogous to calomel.|$|E
5|$|The stomach of Artiodactyls {{is divided}} into four sections: the rumen, the reticulum, the omasum and the abomasum (only {{ruminants}} have a rumen). After the plant material is consumed, it is mixed with saliva in the rumen and reticulum and separates into solid and liquid material. The solids lump <b>together</b> <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> bolus (or cud), and is regurgitated. When the bolus enters the mouth, the fluid is squeezed out with the tongue and swallowed again. Ingested food passes to the rumen and reticulum where cellulytic microbes (bacteria, protozoa and fungi) produce cellulase, which is needed {{to break down the}} cellulose in plants. Perissodactyls, in contrast to the ruminants, store digested food that has left the stomach in an enlarged cecum, where it is fermented by bacteria. Carnivora have a simple stomach adapted to digest primarily meat, as compared to the elaborate digestive systems of herbivorous animals, which are necessary to break down tough, complex plant fibers. The caecum is either absent or short and simple, and the large intestine is not sacculated or much wider than the small intestine.|$|E
