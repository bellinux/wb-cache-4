5|$|After Jones makes another {{unsuccessful}} {{attempt to}} open a doorway at a soccer field in Providence, Olivia searches through old case files related to science and unexplained phenomena, and discovers a geographic connection between the soccer field, the city street, and several of their past Fringe cases. Olivia and Walter {{come to the same}} conclusion, that Jones is going to use a site at Reiden Lake to reopen <b>the</b> <b>doorway,</b> the epicenter of these Fringe events. Olivia, Peter, and Walter intercept Jones while he is opening another window and is halfway through it. Peter triggers Walter's device, killing Jones by sealing <b>the</b> <b>doorway.</b>|$|E
5|$|Early in the 18th century, John Hylton (died 1712), {{the second}} son of Henry Hylton, de jure 16th Baron Hylton, gutted the {{interior}} {{to form a}} three-storeyed block (one room on each floor). He also inserted large, alternating, pedimented sash windows in the Italianate style and added a three-storeyed north wing to the castle (as seen in Bucks' engraving of 1728). A doorway to the new wing was added and approached by a semi-circular staircase. Above <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> was a coat of arms, {{believed to be the}} one created to commemorate the marriage between John Hylton and his wife, Dorothy Musgrave. It is now located above <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> to The Golden Lion Inn at South Hylton, {{on the opposite side of}} the River Wear.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, Ganapati and {{his brother}} Kartikeya (Kumara, Subramanya) or the saktis, the female counterparts, {{can be found at}} either end of this carving.

5|$|The carving on the {{projecting}} lintel on <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> to the sanctum has {{the image}} of a linga or sometimes of Ganapati (Ganesha), the son of Shiva in the case of Shaiva temples or of a seated or upright Jain saint (Tirthankar) in the case of Jain temples.|$|E
5|$|Commission representatives interviewed several {{depository}} {{workers in}} an effort to determine the identity of the man in Altgens' photograph; hearings included testimony from five people who said Lovelady was there, and from three others (including Lovelady) who directly identified him in the picture. Ultimately, the commission decided Oswald was not in <b>the</b> <b>doorway.</b>|$|E
5|$|However, {{the focal}} point of the {{painting}} is widely debated. Leo Steinberg argues that the orthogonals in the work are intentionally disguised so that the picture's focal center shifts. Similar to Lopez-Rey, he describes three foci. The man in <b>the</b> <b>doorway,</b> however, is the vanishing point. More specifically, the crook of his arm is where the orthogonals of the windows and lights of the ceiling meet.|$|E

5|$|Since the mid-1990s, BART {{has been}} trying to {{modernize}} its system. The fleet rehabilitation is part of this modernization; in 2009, fire alarms, fire sprinklers, yellow tactile platform edge domes, and cemented-mat rubber tiles were installed. The rough black tiles on the platform edge mark the location of <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> of approaching trains, allowing passengers to wait at the right place to board. All faregates and ticket vending machines were replaced.|$|E
5|$|An early {{structural}} {{application of}} the Pythagorean tiling appears {{in the works of}} Leonardo da Vinci, who considered it among several other potential patterns for floor joists. This tiling has also long been used decoratively, for floor tiles or other similar patterns, as can be seen for instance in Jacob Ochtervelt's painting Street Musicians at <b>the</b> <b>Doorway</b> of a House (1665). It has been suggested that seeing a similar tiling in the palace of Polycrates may have provided Pythagoras with the original inspiration for his theorem.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{beginning}} of the game, the Abyss-dwelling wizard brothers Garamon and Tyball accidentally summon a demon, the Slasher of Veils, while experimenting with inter-dimensional travel. Garamon is used as bait to lure the demon into a room imbued with virtue. However, the demon offers Tyball great power if he betrays Garamon. Tyball agrees, but the betrayal fails; Garamon is killed, but seals the demon inside the room. Because he lacks virtue, Tyball cannot re-enter by himself, and plans to sacrifice Baron Almric's daughter, Arial, at <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> to gain entrance.|$|E

5|$|Despite this outburst, {{the studio}} liked him, and before his three-week {{contract}} was up—while {{the film was}} still shooting—they gave Cagney a three-week extension, which {{was followed by a}} full seven-year contract at $400 a week. The contract, however, allowed Warners to drop him at the end of any 40-week period, effectively only guaranteeing him 40 weeks income at a time. As when he was growing up, Cagney shared his income with his family. Cagney received good reviews, and immediately starred in another gangster role in <b>The</b> <b>Doorway</b> to Hell. The film was a financial hit, helping cement Cagney's growing reputation. He made four more movies before his breakthrough role.|$|E
5|$|In 1995 Jagger founded Jagged Films with Victoria Pearman. Jagged Films' first {{release was}} the World War II drama Enigma in 2001.

5|$|Norfolk {{was burned}} down during the Revolutionary War. After the Revolution, Norfolk was rebuilt in the Federal style, based on Roman ideals.

Federal homes had {{features}} such as narrow sidelights with an embracing fanlight around <b>the</b> <b>doorway,</b> giant porticoes, gable or flat roofs, and projecting bays on exterior walls. Rooms were oval, elliptical or octagonal. Few of these federal rowhouses remain standing today. A majority of buildings were made of wood and had a simple construction.|$|E

5|$|Ten {{days after}} Kennedy was assassinated, the Associated Press in Dallas {{reported}} that Altgens' first photograph along Elm Street had {{captured the attention}} of people who noticed that one of the men standing in the main doorway to the book depository appeared to resemble the accused killer Lee Harvey Oswald. Those observers raised the question of whether Oswald could have killed Kennedy, saying he {{would not have been able}} to get to <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> from the sixth floor of the building. The report quoted depository superintendent Roy Truly, who identified fellow employee Billy Lovelady as the man in the image. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) told the AP they had already investigated the photograph and also identified Lovelady.|$|E
5|$|The Unitarian Chapel retains {{much of its}} {{original}} interior, including square Corinthian columns, Oak galleries and a carved wooden pulpit. A large brass chandelier was donated to the chapel later in the 18th century by Nathaniel Webb, one the town's members of parliament. In 1881, the building's frontage was decorated with stucco to an Italianate style. Each floor is split {{by a number of}} Corinthian pilasters, and <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> is framed by two pairs of similar identical pilasters, and topped by a triangular pediment. On the ground floor, there are four round-headed windows, while the first floor has five round-headed window bays, though the outer pairs are blocked. It was designated as a Grade II* listed building in 1952.|$|E

5|$|The early 18th {{century the}} central {{area around the}} Abbey was {{expanded}} including the Abbey Church Yard which contained Marshal Wade's House, and Trim Street, which was named after George Trim who owned the land. Number 5, which {{is also known as}} General Wolfe's house, is a 2-storey building with a parapet and rusticated quoins, built by Thomas Greenway. <b>The</b> <b>doorway</b> has Ionic pilasters and a tympanum decorated with the implements of war. In 1716 the architect William Killigrew was commissioned to rebuild St John's Hospital which was founded around 1180, by Bishop Reginald Fitz Jocelin and is among the oldest almshouses in England.|$|E
5|$|The former private chapel of Edward Reynolds, Bishop of Norwich, {{was built}} in 1662 almost entirely at his own expense. It {{replaced}} an earlier chapel which had been severely damaged by a mob during Bishop Hall's episcopate (1641–1656). Constructed from stone with a plain tile roof, it annexes the Bishop's Palace. There is a coat of arms above <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> but it is badly weathered. The Grade II* listed building was previously used by the dean and chapter for the storage of records and came {{to be used as}} a library by the school under S. M.
