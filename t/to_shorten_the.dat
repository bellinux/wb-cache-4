The two extra Wild Card games could also be scheduled on the weekend, creating triple-headers on both Saturday and Sunday. Goodell then suggested that they might instead be played on Friday and/or Monday, which may eventually cause scheduling conflicts with games of the new College Football Playoff.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the planet}} is {{predicted}} to be visible in the Northern Hemisphere, the primary search {{is expected to be}} carried out using the Subaru Telescope, which has both an aperture large enough to see faint objects and a wide field of view <b>to</b> <b>shorten</b> <b>the</b> search. Two teams of astronomers—Batygin and Brown, as well as Trujillo and Sheppard—are undertaking this search together, and both teams cooperatively expect the search to take up to five years. Brown and Batygin initially narrowed the search for Planet Nine down to roughly 2,000 square degrees of sky near Orion, a swath of space, that in Batygin's opinion, could be covered in about 20 nights by the Subaru Telescope. Subsequent refinements by Batygin and Brown have reduced the search space to 600–800 square degrees of sky.|$|E
5|$|For the German side, {{the battle}} left the 18th Army very {{stretched}} and exhausted.

The salient had been held throughout 1942, despite being encircled for a few months, as {{it was an important}} strategic bridgehead. Together with the Rzhev salient (which was also evacuated in spring 1943), it could potentially be used to encircle a large number of Soviet forces. However, in the situation that had developed, retaining it was no longer possible.|$|E

5|$|For the film, Lang {{commissioned}} a composer {{for the first}} time. Hans Erdmann created the opening theme and the music played during Professor Baum's madness. The soundtrack in the film is deceptive. As in Lang's M, the film's music and sound are a subtle mix of actual silence with accompanying music and more or less realistic sound effects. Lang worked with his German editor Conrad von Molo directly on the post-production process. Lang was known for making very long films and to suit foreign fashions, editor Lothar Wolff was contracted <b>to</b> <b>shorten</b> <b>the</b> French-language version. This version deletes parts from the romantic sub-plot between Lilli and Kent.|$|E
5|$|Scott's restorations {{were not}} without their critics and caused much debate in {{architectural}} circles. Scott {{claimed to have}} archaeological evidence for his work, but the Liverpool architect, Samuel Huggins argued in an 1868 address to the Liverpool Architectural Society, that the alterations were less like restoration and more like rebuilding. One of the larger changes was <b>to</b> <b>shorten</b> <b>the</b> south aisle and restyle it as an apse. The changes also proposed {{the addition of a}} spire above the existing tower, but this proposal was later rejected. Samuel's further paper of 1871 entitled On so-called restorations of our cathedral and abbey churches compelled the Dean to attempt to answer the criticism. The debate contributed to the establishment of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings.|$|E
5|$|Some Schubert {{performers}} tend to {{play the}} entire trilogy of the last sonatas in a single recital, thereby stressing their interrelatedness, and suggesting that they form a single, complete cycle. However, since each of these sonatas is rather long (as compared, for instance, with most of Mozart's or Beethoven's sonatas), such a program may prove exhausting to some listeners. One of the solutions to this problem is <b>to</b> <b>shorten</b> <b>the</b> program by omitting repeats, mainly those of the opening movements' expositions (however, this practice is highly disputed, as noted above). The pioneers of the Schubert sonata performance, Schnabel and Erdmann, {{are known to have}} played the entire trilogy in one evening; more recently, so did Alfred Brendel, Maurizio Pollini, Mitsuko Uchida, and Paul Lewis.|$|E

Their journey did not end here; they left for the final destination, Kairouan Airfield in Tunisia, as soon as possible. During the flight the gliders were provided with three pilots, who had to change around every hour to relieve fatigue.|$|E
5|$|HMS Unicorn was an {{aircraft}} repair ship and light aircraft carrier {{built for the}} Royal Navy in the late 1930s.

50|$|Buddhism {{believes}} in cycles in which {{life span of}} human beings changes according to human nature. In Cakkavati sutta the Buddha explained the relationship between life span of human being and behaviour. As per this sutta, In the past unskillful behavior was unknown among the human race. As a result, people lived for an immensely long time — 80,000 years — endowed with great beauty, wealth, pleasure, and strength. Over the course of time, though, they began behaving in various unskillful ways. This caused the human life span gradually <b>to</b> <b>shorten,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point where it now stands at 100 years, with human beauty, wealth, pleasure, and strength decreasing proportionately. In the future, as morality continues to degenerate, human life will continue <b>to</b> <b>shorten</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point were the normal life span is 10 years, with people reaching sexual maturity at five.|$|R

5|$|Kreml, {{named after}} the Kremlin, was ordered on 20 April 1863 when a {{contract}} was signed with the Russian shipbuilder Semiannikov & Poletika for a total cost of 898,000 rubles.

Fearing attack by Britain and France, the Board switched priority to the smaller s shortly afterwards in the belief that they could be completed more quickly so that progress on Kreml slowed to a crawl once construction began on 2 October. The ship was not formally laid down until 23 December and she was launched on 26 August 1865.|$|E
5|$|The A9, {{the great}} road {{connecting}} Edinburgh with Inverness {{and the far}} north, once ran through Evanton, {{on the path of}} Balconie Street. However, a bypass was created as part of a general scheme <b>to</b> <b>shorten</b> <b>the</b> journey between Inverness to Invergordon. This reduced the amount of traffic going through the village, but decreased the revenue available to local businesses. The road also cut through much of the farmland of the zone, distorting the shape of the fields. This was compounded by the closure of the filling station in the village. For those who do not have cars, the only means of transport is either by foot or by the #25 bus service operated by Stagecoach. Recently, the express service running from Inverness to Dornoch began to stop in Evanton. Now residents can travel from and to Inverness without the long diversion through Dingwall, making it easier to work in the city of Inverness without personal transport.|$|E

The movement was to progress from right to left beginning with the 8th Cavalry Regiment, then the 7th Cavalry in the Hill 518 area, and finally the 5th Cavalry in the Waegwan area. This withdrawal caused the 3rd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, to give up a hill it had just attacked and captured near the Tabu-dong road on the approaches of the Walled City of Ka-san. In the 7th Cavalry sector the 1st, 3rd, and 2nd Battalions were to withdraw in that order, after the withdrawal of the 1st Battalion, 8th Cavalry, on their right. The 2d Battalion, 5th Cavalry, on Hill 303 north of Waegwan was to cover the withdrawal of the 7th Cavalry and hold open the escape road.|$|E
