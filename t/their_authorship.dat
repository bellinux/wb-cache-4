5|$|In {{addition}} to the speeches, there are fifty-six prologues (openings of speeches). They were collected for the Library of Alexandria by Callimachus, who believed them genuine. Modern scholars are divided: some reject them, while others, such as Blass, believe they are authentic. Finally, six letters also survive under Demosthenes's name and <b>their</b> <b>authorship</b> too is hotly debated.|$|E
5|$|Another Marcus {{contribution}} to the arts was his own work {{in the area of}} photography. Over the course of his adult life, Marcus took thousands of photographs, both of famous and anonymous subjects, which he turned over to granddaughter Allison V. Smith, a professional photographer, upon moving out of his Nonesuch Road home into a smaller residence in the late 1990s. Two years after his death, Smith began making digital scans of the photos and posting them to the sharing site Flickr; despite the fact that <b>their</b> <b>authorship</b> was not identified, within a year the photographs had drawn 10,000 views. For the 100th anniversary of Neiman Marcus, Smith and her mother, Jerrie Marcus Smith, decided to assemble a representative selection of the nearly 5,000 images into a book; titled Reflection of a Man, the 192-page book was published by Cairn Press in October, 2007, and accompanied by an exhibit at the Dallas Museum of Art.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{hold that}} there has been extensive editorial reshaping of the stories and statements within the Talmud. Lacking outside confirming texts, they hold that we cannot confirm the origin or date of most statements and laws, and that we can say little for certain about <b>their</b> <b>authorship.</b> In this view, the questions above are impossible to answer. See, for example, the works of Louis Jacobs and Shaye J.D. Cohen.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{versions}} of the texts for Sacramentaries, chiefly of the Roman Rite, are still extant, either complete or in part. Of these textual groups the most important are the three known by the names Leonine, Gelasian, and Gregorian. <b>Their</b> date, <b>authorship,</b> place, and original purpose have been much discussed.|$|R
50|$|There are ten {{collections}} of his poems extant today {{but it is}} believed that he used to allow others for a consideration to publish his poems under <b>their</b> own <b>authorship.</b> His personal life lacked discipline; his poetry reflects a level of sensuality. He excelled in lyrics but also composed odes and romances.|$|R
50|$|It is {{sometimes}} published in an omnibus edition with Farmer Giles of Ham, another Tolkien novella with illustrations by Pauline Baynes.

25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{hold that}} there has been extensive editorial reshaping of the stories and statements within the Mishnah (and later, in the Talmud.) Lacking outside confirming texts, they hold that we cannot confirm the origin or date of most statements and laws, and that we can say little for certain about <b>their</b> <b>authorship.</b> In this view, the questions above are impossible to answer. See, for example, the works of Louis Jacobs, Baruch M. Bokser, Shaye J. D. Cohen, Steven D. Fraade.|$|E
25|$|William Henry James Weale {{wrote the}} notes for the {{catalogue}} {{for the painting}} section. The often erroneous attributions were those of the owners, but {{the position of the}} paintings in the exhibition generally reflected the opinion of the organizers, including Weale and Georges Hulin de Loo (a professor at the University of Ghent), regarding <b>their</b> <b>authorship.</b> The illustrated catalogue of the section showing manuscripts, miniatures, archive texts, seals, mereaux, coins and medals was written by Baron Albert Van Zuylen Van Nyevelt. A third section, covering needlework, gobelins, and the like, was catalogued by Isabelle Errera.|$|E
25|$|The tribe {{seems to}} have dwindled in size, {{and the size of}} the tribe {{dramatically}} drops by over half between the two censuses recorded in the Book of Numbers. Although the Bible places these censuses during the Exodus, some textual scholars place <b>their</b> <b>authorship</b> in the period of priestly source, which Richard Elliot Freedman dates to roughly 700-600 BC. Other scholars usually place the Priestly Source in the post-exilic period, and some deny its existence altogether. The tribe is completely absent from the Blessing of Moses, which textual scholars date to near the time of the Deuteronomist, after the dates of these censuses; some Septuagint manuscripts appear to have attempted to correct this, adding the name of Simeon to the latter half of verse 6, which some scholars view as unwarranted based on the Hebrew manuscripts.|$|E
50|$|His {{commentary}} on the Talmud is extremely concise and as such {{is one of the}} most frequently referred to Talmudic commentators until today. Many sections of the commentary have been subject to debate regarding <b>their</b> actual <b>authorship,</b> but the majority of the work has remained free from controversy. He also wrote commentaries on the writings of Isaac Alfasi and certain works of Nahmanides.|$|R
50|$|Cunningham was apprenticed to a stonemason, {{but gave}} his leisure to {{reading and writing}} imitations of old Scottish ballads. In 1809 he {{collected}} old ballads for Robert Hartley Cromek's Remains of Nithsdale and Galloway Song; he sent in, however, poems of his own, which the editor inserted, even though he may have suspected <b>their</b> real <b>authorship.</b> It gained for him the friendship of Walter Scott and Hogg.|$|R
5000|$|Rollins was {{the first}} to define {{psychological}} biblical criticism as having the hermeneutical intent of examining [...] "... texts, <b>their</b> origination, <b>authorship,</b> modes of expression, their construction, transmission, translation, reading, interpretation, their transposition into kindred and alien forms, and the history of their personal and cultural effect, as expressions of the structure, processes, and habits of the human psyche, both in individual and collective manifestations, past and present."

25|$|Patrick Henry {{was sworn}} into a sleepy {{session of the}} {{legislature}} on May 20; many of the members had left town. On about May 28, a ship arrived with an urgent letter from Montague: the Stamp Act had passed. On May 29, Henry introduced the Virginia Stamp Act Resolves. The first two resolutions affirmed that the colonists had the same rights and privileges as Britons; the next two stated that taxation should be exacted only by one's representatives. The fifth was the most provocative, as it named the Virginia legislature, the General Assembly, as the representatives of Virginia empowered to tax. Two other resolutions were offered, though <b>their</b> <b>authorship</b> is uncertain. Edmund and Helen Morgan, in their account of the Stamp Act crisis, suggested that Henry acted as he saw the Stamp Act as both a threat to Virginians' rights, {{and an opportunity to}} advance himself politically.|$|E
500|$|In 1976 the {{government}} of South Africa decided to implement the use of Afrikaans as the medium of instruction in all schools instead of English. In response, high school students {{began a series of}} protests that {{came to be known as}} the Soweto Uprising. 15,000â€“20,000 students took part; the police, caught unprepared, opened fire on the protesting children. 700 people were estimated to have been killed, and over a thousand injured. The killings sparked off several months of rioting in the Soweto townships, and the protests became an important moment for the anti-Apartheid movement. Hugh Masekela wrote Soweto Blues in response to the massacre, and the song was performed by Miriam Makeba, becoming a standard part of Makeba's live performances for many years. [...] "Soweto Blues" [...] was one of many melancholic songs composed by Masekela during this period that expressed his support of the anti-apartheid struggle, along with [...] "Been Gone Far Too Long," [...] "Mama," [...] and [...] "The Coal Train." [...] Songs written after the Soweto uprising were generally political in nature, but used hidden meaning to avoid suppression, especially as the movement against apartheid gained momentum. A song by the band Juluka used a metaphor of fighting bulls to suggest the fall of apartheid. Many songs of this period became so widely known that their lyrics were frequently altered and adapted depending on the circumstances, making <b>their</b> <b>authorship</b> collective. Pianist Abdullah Ibrahim used purely musical techniques to convey subversive messages, by incorporating melodies from freedom songs into his improvisations. Ibrahim also composed [...] "Mannenberg", described as the [...] "most powerful anthem of the struggle in the 1980s", which had no lyrics but drew on a number of aspects of black South African culture, including church music, jazz, marabi, and blues, to create a piece that conveyed a sense of freedom and cultural identity.|$|E
500|$|Foliot {{also wrote}} {{a number of}} sermons and commentaries on the Bible. Of the commentaries, only those on the Song of Songs and the Lord's Prayer still survive. The {{commentary}} on the Song of Songs was first printed in 1638, by Patrick Young, {{and again in the}} Patrologia Latina volume 202. The commentary on the Lord's Prayer was first published by David Bell in 1989. The commentary on the Song of Songs has been printed three times, the last {{in the middle of the}} 20th century. About 60 of his acta, or decisions, as Bishop of Hereford still survive, and from his time at London a further 150 or so are extant. A contemporary, Peter, the prior of Holy Trinity Priory in Aldgate, London, heard Foliot preach a sermon at a synod, and praised the sermon as [...] "adorned with flowers of words and sentences and supported by a copious array of authorities. It ran backwards and forwards on its path from its starting-point back to the same starting point." [...] The sermon so inspired Peter that he wrote a work entitled Pantheologus, which dealt with the distinctio method of exegesis, which was developing around this time. All of Foliot's surviving theological works are based on exegesis, and may include nine sermons on the subject of Saints Peter and Paul, which were dedicated to Aelred of Rivaulx. These sermons are dedicated to a [...] "Gilbert, Bishop of London", which could mean either Foliot or an earlier bishop, Gilbert Universalis. However, the historian Richard Sharpe feels that the fact that the sermons are paired with a group of Aelred's sermons dedicated to Foliot makes <b>their</b> <b>authorship</b> by Foliot slightly more likely. These sermons survive in manuscript, now in the British Library as Royal 2 D.xxxii, but have not yet been printed. A further group of sermons which were dedicated to Haimo, the abbot of Bordesley, did not survive, but is known from the surviving dedication letter.|$|E

50|$|The {{book was}} {{mentioned}} in The New York Times {{and also in}} the anti-consumerist magazine Adbusters in relation to the case of the Tarnac 9, a group of French leftists arrested on charges of railway sabotage in November 2008. <b>Their</b> alleged <b>authorship</b> of the book is the centerpiece of the government's case. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Michael Moore mentioned the book as being the most recent one he had read.|$|R
5000|$|The {{claims to}} the {{documents}} being genuine works of Abdias have been widely disputed for several centuries. <b>Their</b> original <b>authorship</b> was first brought into question over book six, which was associated with another assistant of Abdias called [...] "Caton". Book six covers the lives of Saint Simon and Saint Jude. It has also been noted that a similar volume called the Pseudo-Crato was allegedly written by a disciple of Simon's called Crato.|$|R

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the Theogony and Works and Days, numerous other poems were ascribed to Hesiod during antiquity.

The situation is summed up in this formulation by Glenn Most: ...|$|E
2500|$|Further, {{infrared}} reflectography {{shows that}} {{changes were made}} to the composition before its completion, proving {{that it is not the}} work of a copyist. The triptych was commissioned by Isabella's father John II who donated it to the Miraflores Carthusian monastery, near Burgos, Spain, around 1445. Most likely, Isabella ordered a copy of the Berlin work as such altarpieces were then [...] "prized for their spiritual powers or for the status of <b>their</b> <b>authorship</b> and/or ownership".|$|E
50|$|The {{combined}} edition {{was published}} in 1749 by Jin An, a citizen of Fuzhou, who added a foreword.As local works, the earlier dictionaries were largely ignored by the scholarly tradition, so inferences about <b>their</b> date and <b>authorship</b> are necessarily based on internal evidence.|$|R
2500|$|Various {{important}} aspects of Han poetry are associated with Emperor Wu and his court, including his direct interest in poetry and patronage of poets. [...] Emperor Wu was also a patron of literature, {{with a number of}} poems being attributed to him. As to the poetry on lost love, some of the pieces attributed to him are considered of well-done, there is some question to <b>their</b> actual <b>authorship.</b> The following work is on the death of Li Furen, one of his favorite concubines.|$|R
50|$|His teacher there was, Franz Anton Maulbertsch, {{with whom}} he worked {{throughout}} his life kept friendly relations, working together as the frescoes and paintings for a church in Mikulov. In many places, Leicher painted altarpieces in churches with frescoes. The influence of his teachers {{could be seen in}} his work, as is evident in the rich coloristic main altar painting in BÃ­lovec. In several cases, the works were long attributed to just Maulbertsch and only recently found <b>their</b> true <b>authorship</b> as Leicher's.|$|R
2500|$|Some {{editions of}} the Moralia include several works now known to be pseudepigrapha: among these are the Lives of the Ten Orators (biographies of the Attic orators based on Caecilius of Calacte), On the Opinions of the Philosophers, On Fate, and On Music. One [...] "Pseudo-Plutarch" [...] is held {{responsible}} {{for all of these}} works, though <b>their</b> <b>authorship</b> is unknown. Though the thoughts and opinions recorded are not Plutarch's and come from a slightly later era, they are all classical in origin and have value to the historian.|$|E
2500|$|The Royal Frankish Annals (Latin: Annales regni Francorum; also Annales Laurissenses maiores and German: Reichsannalen) are Latin annals {{composed}} in Carolingian Francia, recording year-by-year {{the state of}} the monarchy from 741 (the death of Mayor of the Palace Charles Martel) to 829 (the beginning of the crisis of Louis the Pious). <b>Their</b> <b>authorship</b> is unknown, though Wilhelm von Giesebrecht suggested that Arno of Salzburg was the author of an early section of the Annaes Laurissenses majores surviving in the copy at Lorsch Abbey.

2500|$|The three [...] "Farmer's Letters" [...] are {{forceful}} {{presentations of}} the Loyalist claim, {{written in a}} plain, hard-headed style. <b>Their</b> <b>authorship</b> was long in question, but {{it is certain that}} Seabury claimed them in England in 1783, when he was seeking episcopal consecration. At the same time, he claimed authorship of a letter entitled [...] "An Alarm to the Legislature of the Province of New York" [...] (1775), not signed by the Westchester farmer, which discussed the power of what he viewed as the only legal political body in the colony. Seabury's clarity of style and general ease of reading set him apart from his ecclesiastical colleagues throughout his life.|$|E

2500|$|Furthermore, {{there are}} {{linguistic}} and theological {{similarities between the}} Luke and Acts. As one scholar writes,"the extensive linguistic and theological agreements and cross-references between the Gospel of Luke and the Acts indicate that both works derive from the same author".

2500|$|Articles {{often take}} a {{definite}} editorial stance and almost never carry a byline. Not even {{the name of}} the editor (since 2015, Zanny Minton Beddoes) is printed in the issue. It is a long-standing tradition that an editor's only signed article during their tenure is written on the occasion of their departure from the position. The author of a piece is named in certain circumstances: when notable persons are invited to contribute opinion pieces; when journalists of The Economist compile special reports (previously known as surveys); for the Year in Review special edition; and to highlight a potential conflict of interest over a book review. The names of The Economist editors and correspondents can be located on the media directory pages of the website. Online blog pieces are signed with the initials of the writer and authors of print stories are allowed to note <b>their</b> <b>authorship</b> from their personal web sites. [...] "This approach is not without its faults (we have four staff members with the initials [...] "J.P.", for example) but is the best compromise between total anonymity and full bylines, in our view", wrote one anonymous writer of The Economist.|$|E
