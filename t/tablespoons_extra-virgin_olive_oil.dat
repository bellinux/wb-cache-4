Moulds were present in all of the types of commercial flavoured <b>olive</b> <b>oils,</b> yeasts were only found in the oil enriched with oregano, while bacteria were only occasionally observed. The trials performed in labora-tory using experimental <b>extra-virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> flavoured with the same ingredients, at zero concentration (control), 1, 5 and 10 % (w/v), confirmed the survival of the microorganisms in the flavoured <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> in a different way according to the type and concentration of the ingredients.

However, the concentration of pigments can vary significantly depending on the climate conditions, harvesting time, and olive cultivars. In this work, we quantified the main pigments in several <b>extra-virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> produced from a blend of three cultivars (Moraiolo, Frantoio, and Leccino) typical of Tuscany (Italy) harvested in three different years: 2012, 2013, and 2014. Pigments—namely, β-carotene, lutein, pheophytin A, and pheophytin B—were quantified by a method based on the mathematical analysis of the near ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra of the oils. Data were analyzed by a multivariate statistical approach. The results show that the pigments’ content of <b>extra-virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> produced in 2014 can be well distinguished with respect to previous years.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Observational {{cohort studies}} and a {{secondary}} prevention trial have shown an inverse association between {{adherence to the}} Mediterranean diet and cardiovascular risk. We conducted a randomized trial of this diet pattern for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events. METHODS: In a multicenter trial in Spain, we randomly assigned participants who were at high cardiovascular risk, but with no cardiovascular disease at enrollment, {{to one of three}} diets: a Mediterranean diet supplemented with <b>extra-virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> a Mediterranean diet supplemented with mixed nuts, or a control diet (advice to reduce dietary fat). Participants received quarterly individual and group educational sessions and, depending on group assignment, free provision of <b>extra-virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> mixed nuts, or small nonfood gifts. The primary end point was the rate of major cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes). On the basis of the results of an interim analysis, the trial was stopped after a median follow-up of 4. 8 years. RESULTS: A total of 7447 persons were enrolled (age range, 55 to 80 years); 57 % were women. The two Mediterranean-diet groups had good adherence to the intervention, according to self-reported intake and biomarker analyses. A primary end-point event occurred in 288 participants. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios were 0. 70 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 54 to 0. 92) and 0. 72 (95 % CI, 0. 54 to 0. 96) for the group assigned to a Mediterranean diet with <b>extra-virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> (96 events) and the group assigned to a Mediterranean diet with nuts (83 events), respectively, versus the control group (109 events).

40|$|IMPORTANCE: Breast {{cancer is}} the leading cause of female cancer burden, and its {{incidence}} has increased by more than 20 % worldwide since 2008. Some observational studies have suggested that the Mediterranean diet may reduce the risk of breast cancer. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of 2 interventions with Mediterranean diet vs the advice to follow a low-fat diet (control) on breast cancer incidence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The PREDIMED study is a 1 : 1 : 1 randomized, single-blind, controlled field trial conducted at primary health care centers in Spain. From 2003 to 2009, 4282 women aged 60 to 80 years and at high cardiovascular disease risk were recruited after invitation by their primary care physicians. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly allocated to a Mediterranean diet supplemented with <b>extra-virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> a Mediterranean diet supplemented with mixed nuts, or a control diet (advice to reduce dietary fat). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Breast cancer incidence was a prespecified secondary outcome of the trial for women without a prior history of breast cancer (n = 4152). RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 4. 8 years, we identified 35 confirmed incident cases of breast cancer. Observed rates (per 1000 person-years) were 1. 1 for the Mediterranean diet with <b>extra-virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> group, 1. 8 for the Mediterranean diet with nuts group, and 2. 9 for the control group. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios vs the control group were 0. 32 (95 % CI, 0. 13 - 0. 79) for the Mediterranean diet with <b>extra-virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> group and 0. 59 (95 % CI, 0. 26 - 1. 35) for the Mediterranean diet with nuts group. In analyses with yearly cumulative updated dietary exposures, the hazard ratio for each additional 5 % of calories from <b>extra-virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> was 0. 72 (95 % CI, 0. 57 - 0. 90). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This is the first randomized trial finding an effect of a long-term dietary intervention on breast cancer incidence. Our results suggest a beneficial effect of a Mediterranean diet supplemented with <b>extra-virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> in the primary prevention of breast cancer. These results come from a secondary analysis of a previous trial and are based on few incident cases and, therefore, need to be confirmed in longer-term and larger studies...|$|R
