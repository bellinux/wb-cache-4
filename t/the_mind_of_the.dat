5|$|Asa Gray {{promoted}} {{and defended}} Origin against those American naturalists with an idealist approach, notably Louis Agassiz who viewed every species {{as a distinct}} fixed unit in <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Creator, classifying as species what others considered merely varieties. Edward Drinker Cope and Alpheus Hyatt reconciled this view with evolutionism in a form of neo-Lamarckism involving recapitulation theory.|$|E
5|$|In Eastern Europe, Milica Bakić–Hayden {{developed}} {{the concept of}} Nesting Orientalisms (1992), derived from {{the ideas of the}} historian Larry Wolff (Inventing Eastern Europe: The Map of Civilization on <b>the</b> <b>Mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enlightenment, 1994) and Said's ideas in Orientalism (1978). The Bulgarian historian Maria Todorova (Imagining the Balkans, 1997) presented the ethnologic concept of Nesting Balkanisms (Ethnologia Balkanica, 1997), which is derived from Milica Bakić–Hayden's concept of Nesting Orientalisms.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{have noted}} that Narayan's {{writings}} {{tend to be more}} descriptive and less analytical; the objective style, rooted in a detached spirit, providing for a more authentic and realistic narration. His attitude, coupled with his perception of life, provided a unique ability to fuse characters and actions, and an ability to use ordinary events to create a connection in <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reader. A significant contributor to his writing style was his creation of Malgudi, a stereotypical small town, where the standard norms of superstition and tradition apply.|$|E
40|$|In <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> antiglobalization {{movement}} and the anti-American left, and perhaps in <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> Islamic terrorists themselves, <b>the</b> growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American Empire has caused <b>the</b> growth <b>of</b> Islamic terrorism. But in <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American political and economic elite, and certainly in <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> officials <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bush administration, <b>the</b> growth <b>of</b> Islamic terrorism has become <b>the</b> cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American Empire. As it happens, both causal theories are probably correct...|$|R

5|$|Many historians {{maintain}} {{that given the}} massive reductions in US military aid to South Vietnam after 1973, any major PAVN offensive was bound to succeed. However, the ARVN's soldiers were hardened veterans, and South Vietnam maintained vast stockpiles of ammunition and equipment (as demonstrated by the massive quantities of war materiel captured by the PAVN when the war ended). The final collapse of the ARVN {{may well have been}} inevitable, but the end would have been much bloodier and much longer in coming had the PAVN chosen a more direct, conventional plan of attack. In fact, the most damaging blow of the entire PAVN campaign may have been the crushing psychological blow their skillful and unexpected strategy dealt to <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ARVN's commander-in-chief.|$|E
5|$|Before his death, Mr. Nobody {{tells the}} {{journalist}} {{that neither of}} them exist. They are figments in <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 9-year-old Nemo at the train station, as {{he was forced to}} make an impossible choice. The young boy tries to find the correct decision, following each choice to its conclusion. Eventually, the boy takes a third option: to not make the choice at all. He leaves both parents and runs away towards an unknown future. This ambiguous choice somehow leads to him and Anna reuniting happily. The film returns to old Nemo on his death bed. The calculated time arrives and Mr. Nobody's last words are watched by the world. The expansion of the universe comes to a halt and time appears to reverse. The universe ceases to dissipate, and finally begins contracting. Consequently, Nemo's life simplifies itself. He is able to return to his childhood, watch his parents get back together and be with Anna. The 118-year-old man cackles triumphantly as he springs back into awareness with the realization that his younger self has finally found his one true love and life.|$|E
5|$|In the 1910–11 Australian season, Crawford {{scored a}} half-century in every {{first-class}} game he played but was less successful with the ball. His success against the touring South Africans, perhaps helped by his experience facing their googly bowlers on previous occasions, brought him close to selection for the Australian Test team that year. The Australian Board of Control eventually decided that, {{as he had}} already appeared for England, they could not choose him; instead they picked Charlie Kelleway as the all-rounder. Crawford resigned from his position as St Peter's in March 1911, suggesting to the press that he might move into farming. He may have considered leaving South Australia, but the Cricket Association appointed him as a clerk at the Adelaide Oval, a position which earned £200 per annum, with additional responsibility for coaching and youth scouting. Meanwhile, in England, after unsuccessful attempts by his father to change <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Surrey committee, including a failed bid to secure his own election to the committee, Crawford sent a written apology to Surrey {{at some time in}} 1910. Consequently, the committee passed a motion in March 1911 which ended the ban on Crawford playing for the county.|$|E

5|$|The {{match was}} played over {{three days and}} culminated in a draw on Saturday, 27 July. Lancashire won the toss and decided to bat, but were {{dismissed}} for only 89 after rain shortened the first day's play. Grace took 3–44 and the left arm spinner Robert Miles took 7–38. Gloucestershire responded with 116, Grace making the top score of 32. At close of play on the second day, Lancashire had made 90–0 with Hornby on 68 and Barlow on 15; and {{the legend of the}} run stealers was born in <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> watching Francis Thompson. Hornby and Barlow put on 108 for the first wicket and then Barlow was out for 26. Hornby went on to score exactly 100 and Lancashire's total was 262 (Grace 1–65). Gloucestershire scored 125–5 in the last innings with Grace, batting at six, on 58 not out at the close.|$|E
5|$|Undoubtedly while negro slavery {{alone was}} in <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Congress which {{proposed}} the thirteenth article, it forbids {{any other kind}} of slavery, now or hereafter. If Mexican peonage or the Chinese coolie labor system shall develop slavery of the Mexican or Chinese race within our territory, this amendment may safely be trusted to make it void. And so if other rights are assailed by the States which properly and necessarily fall within the protection of these articles, that protection will apply, though the party interested may not be of African descent. But what we do say, and what we wish to be understood is, that in any fair and just construction of any section or phrase of these amendments, it is necessary to look to the purpose which we have said was the pervading spirit of them all, the evil which they were designed to remedy, and the process of continued addition to the Constitution, until that purpose was supposed to be accomplished, as far as constitutional law can accomplish it.|$|E
5|$|With {{the ongoing}} {{conflict}} with Chart House on <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company's board in 1978, Burger King hired McDonald's executive Donald N. Smith to help revamp the company. Smith initiated a restructuring of all future franchising agreements. New owners {{were barred from}} living more than an hour's drive from their restaurants, corporations were not permitted to own franchises, and franchisees could no longer operate other chains. This new policy effectively limited the size of franchisees and prevented larger franchises from challenging Burger King as Chart House had. It also became a requirement for the corporation to own the properties of any new store and lease them to franchisees. This policy would allow the company {{to take over the}} operations of failing stores or evict those owners who would not conform to the company guidelines and policies. Beyond the changes to the franchise system, Smith also restructured Burger King's corporate operations to better compete against his former employer as well as then up and coming chain Wendy's. He broadened the product offering by adding the Burger King specialty sandwich line in 1979, and also added many non-hamburger sandwiches including new chicken and fish offerings. The new line {{was one of the first}} attempts by a major fast food chain to target a specific demographic, in this case adults aged between 18 and 34 years, members of which were presumably willing spend more on a higher quality product. The new products were successful and the company's sales increased by 15%.|$|E

25|$|By tradition, the Orthodox Church, {{when faced}} with issues that are larger than a single bishop can resolve, holds a local council. The bishops and such others as may attend convene (as St. Paul called the Corinthians to do) to seek <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church. A council's {{declarations}} or edicts then reflect its consensus (if one can be found). An ecumencial council is only called for issues of such import or difficulty or pervasiveness that smaller councils are insufficient to address them. Ecumenical councils' declarations and canons carry binding weight {{by virtue of their}} representation across the whole church, by which <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church can be readily seen. However, not all issues are so difficult as to require an ecumenical council to resolve. Some doctrines or decisions, not defined in a formal statement or proclaimed officially, nevertheless are held by the Church unshakably and unanimously without internal disturbance, and these, also reflecting <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church, are just as firmly irrevocable as a formal declaration of an ecumenical council. Lack of formality does not imply lack of authority within Holy Tradition. An example of such unanimity {{can be found in the}} acceptance in the 5th century of the lists of books that comprise Holy Scripture, a true canon without official stamp.|$|E
