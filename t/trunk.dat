50|$|The Dynamic <b>Trunking</b> Protocol (DTP) is a {{proprietary}} networking protocol developed by Cisco Systems {{for the purpose}} of negotiating <b>trunking</b> on a link between two VLAN-aware switches, and for negotiating the type of <b>trunking</b> encapsulation to be used. It works on Layer 2 of the OSI model. VLAN <b>trunks</b> formed using DTP may utilize either IEEE 802.1Q or Cisco ISL <b>trunking</b> protocols.|$|R

5|$|For {{the first}} few days, the newborn is {{unsteady}} on its feet, and needs the support of its mother. It relies on touch, smell, and hearing, as its eyesight is poor. It has little precise control over its <b>trunk,</b> which wiggles around and may cause it to trip. By its second week of life, the calf can walk more firmly and has more control over its <b>trunk.</b> After its first month, a calf can pick up, hold, and put objects in its mouth, but cannot suck water through the <b>trunk</b> and must drink directly through the mouth. It is still dependent on its mother and keeps close to her.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the most}} serious {{deliberate}} damage happened during the night of 12/13 May 2014, when the tallest <b>trunk</b> was sawn off at its base with a chainsaw, by unknown perpetrators. Following the vandalism, the severed <b>trunk</b> was stored, and it was eventually decided to re-attach it with artificial supports, several steel straps connecting the <b>trunk</b> to the base; this work {{was carried out in}} early July 2015 at a cost of €35,000, shared by the Catalan government and the Barcelona provincial administration.|$|E

5|$|The African {{elephant}} has two finger-like extensions {{at the tip}} of the <b>trunk</b> {{that allow}} it to grasp and bring food to its mouth. The Asian elephant has only one, and relies more on wrapping around a food item and squeezing it into its mouth. Asian elephants have more muscle coordination and can perform more complex tasks. Losing the <b>trunk</b> would be detrimental to an elephant's survival, although in rare cases, individuals have survived with shortened ones. One elephant has been observed to graze by kneeling on its front legs, raising on its hind legs and taking in grass with its lips. Floppy <b>trunk</b> syndrome is a condition of <b>trunk</b> paralysis in African bush elephants caused by the degradation of the peripheral nerves and muscles beginning at the tip.|$|E
5|$|The age of {{the tree}} was {{determined}} by carbon dating of genetically matched plant material collected from under the tree, as dendrochronology would cause damage. The <b>trunk</b> itself {{is estimated to be}} only a few hundred years old, but the plant has survived for much longer due to a process known as layering (when a branch comes in contact with the ground, it sprouts a new root), or vegetative cloning (when the <b>trunk</b> dies but the root system is still alive, it may sprout a new <b>trunk).</b>|$|E

5|$|Unlike Pi Vell, Pi Jove {{had escaped}} the attentions of vandals until more recently, {{due to its}} lower {{political}} profile and greater distance (200 m) from the road. In 2010, it was discovered with a circumferential cut through the bark, in addition to apparent shotgun damage. Vandals attacked it in June 2015, attempting to saw through one of its trunks, {{though it was not}} thought that the damage was serious enough to kill the affected <b>trunk.</b> As a precaution, in December 2015 arborists installed a frame to hold the three trunks together and ensure their stability. In January 2016, deeper chainsaw cuts were discovered on the already-damaged <b>trunk</b> which are believed harsh enough to kill the <b>trunk</b> altogether; these vandals also attacked Pi Vell.|$|E
