5|$|Another of Dannatt's {{priorities}} was tackling <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British {{operations in}} Iraq and Afghanistan, {{as he was}} concerned the news media and the British public were unaware of the purpose or the intensity of the missions. Disgruntled by increasingly negative coverage, he interrupted a family holiday in Cornwall to fly to Afghanistan in an effort to change the coverage through a series of interviews. During the visit, he managed to meet with his son, Bertie, who was serving in the country with the Grenadier Guards. Later in 2007, Dannatt raised the same issue in a lecture to the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. Earlier that year, Dannatt had taken the decision not to allow Prince Harry to serve in Iraq. However, after Dannatt had brokered an understanding with the British press, Harry was able to serve in Afghanistan for three months in late 2007 and early 2008 until the story broke and he was ordered home.|$|E

5|$|Birds {{have one}} of the most complex {{respiratory}} systems of all animal groups. Upon inhalation, 75% of the fresh air bypasses the lungs and flows directly into a posterior air sac which extends from the lungs and connects with air spaces in the bones and fills them with air. The other 25% of the air goes directly into the lungs. When the bird exhales, the used air flows out of the lungs and the stored fresh air from the posterior air sac is simultaneously forced into the lungs. Thus, a bird's lungs receive a constant supply of fresh air during both inhalation and exhalation. Sound production is achieved using the syrinx, a muscular chamber incorporating multiple tympanic membranes which diverges from {{the lower end of the}} trachea; the trachea being elongated in some species, increasing the volume of vocalisations and <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bird's size.|$|E
5|$|PBHistory {{documents}} {{were used for}} years afterward to discredit Árbenz (living in exile) and to counter Soviet propaganda about American imperialism in Guatemala. When Árbenz moved to Montevideo in 1957, the CIA used the PBHistory documents to produce a biography of Árbenz that described him as a Soviet agent, {{in an attempt to}} prevent Árbenz from moving to Mexico, where opposition to Castillo Armas' regime was coalescing. Nonetheless, Árbenz remained a symbol of principled resistance to the United States, helped in part by Soviet propaganda to that effect. When some of the PBHistory {{documents were}} published, they received little attention in Latin America.

Troika, unable to obtain further funding from Activision or other publishers, released its employees in two waves: the first in November 2004, followed by the remaining staff in December, except for its three founders Anderson, Boyarsky, and Tim Cain. Some employees worked without pay to fix the game. When the company closed in February 2005, it had secured no other game development deals.

In a November 2004 interview Boyarsky said that although the team would like to pursue a Bloodlines sequel, the decision was Activision's.

40|$|Obesity {{rates are}} rising rapidly across the {{developed}} and developing world. Until recently obesity research has mainly focused on biological, psychological and behavioural factors.

In this study data from the 2003 Health Survey for England (n = 14, 836) were analysed from a multilevel perspective to examine (1) <b>the</b> associations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local environment with obesity, self-rated health, and physical activity, and (2) whether physical activity mediates <b>the</b> association between <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> environment, and obesity and self-rated health. This study found that <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> friendliness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local environment were mainly associated with self-rated health; perceived access to leisure facilities with sports activities; perceived access to a post office with walking; and <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> social nuisances with obesity and poor self-rated health. In addition, positive <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> social environment (i. e., social support and social capital) were associated with higher levels of physical activity, and lower levels of poor self-rated health and obesity.
