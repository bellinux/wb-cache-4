5|$|Grill {{was also}} {{interested}} in porcelain. Part of his orders may have been {{just a way to}} get his money transferred from China <b>to</b> <b>Sweden</b> after he was ordered to return home in 1768, but he also ordered his own armorial dinner service.|$|E
5|$|He {{graduated}} from university in 1935, but {{upon his return}} <b>to</b> <b>Sweden,</b> he found his American degree did not qualify him to practice as an architect. Later that year, his grandfather arranged a job for him in Cape Town, South Africa, {{in the office of}} a Swedish company that sold construction material. After six months in South Africa, he took a new job at a branch office of the Holland Bank in Haifa. He returned <b>to</b> <b>Sweden</b> in 1936 and obtained a job in Stockholm {{with the help of his}} uncle and godfather, Jacob Wallenberg, at the Central European Trading Company, an export-import company trading between Stockholm and central Europe, owned by Kálmán Lauer, a Hungarian Jew.|$|E

50|$|Although Sweden did {{not enter}} the fight, she did later agree to cancel the transit of German {{military}} material and troops across <b>Sweden,</b> <b>to</b> further reduce iron ore exports, end Swedish naval escorting of German ships in the Baltic, and reduce ball bearing exports. In exchange, Britain and the US agreed to a relaxation of the blockade <b>to</b> allow <b>Sweden</b> <b>to</b> import certain important commodities, including rubber and oil. The ongoing diplomatic pressure, together with the deteriorating German military position gradually persuaded <b>Sweden</b> <b>to</b> reduce and ultimately end its trade with Germany by November 1944.|$|R

5|$|The {{campaign}} led <b>to</b> <b>Sweden</b> gaining {{control over}} the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, until the Swedish defeat at Battle of Poltava and the Treaty of Thorn (1709) which restored the Russian-backed Augustus to the Polish throne and forced the remaining Swedes out of the Commonwealth.|$|E
5|$|When Grill {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>Sweden</b> in 1768, {{he first}} lived in Stockholm where he occupied himself with trade.

5|$|A small {{contingent}} of Hawker Hunters deployed <b>to</b> <b>Sweden</b> in 1965 for training in air-to-ground delivery of ordnance, and intermittently thereafter, but annual training abroad for the Swiss Air Force {{did not begin}} until 1985. The use of Swiss air space for combat training became increasingly impractical as the performance of supersonic jets increased and created environmental restrictions. The Swiss modified their traditional stance of neutrality to seek other facilities, particularly among NATO European members, to meet their training needs.|$|E

Tambellini left Djurgården in February, 2017, having failed to make a significant impact at Djurgården by producing only 4 goals and 5 assists in 41 games. He subsequently rejoined his former team Växjö Lakers, {{with whom he had}} won the Le Mat Trophy in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Another {{war with}} Russia {{followed}} in 1632 and was concluded without much {{change in the}} status quo. King Władysław IV then proceeded to recover the lands lost <b>to</b> <b>Sweden.</b> At {{the conclusion of the}} hostilities, Sweden evacuated the cities and ports of Royal Prussia but kept most of Livonia. Courland, which had remained with the Commonwealth, assumed the servicing of Lithuania's Baltic trade. After Frederick William's last Prussian homage before the Polish king in 1641, the Commonwealth's position in regard to Prussia and its Hohenzollern rulers kept getting weaker.|$|E
5|$|Defining {{themselves}} as both Swedish and American, the Swedish-American community retained a fascination {{for the old}} country {{and their relationship to}} it. The nostalgic visits <b>to</b> <b>Sweden</b> which had begun in the 1870s continued well into the 20th century, and narratives from these trips formed a staple of the lively Swedish-American publishing companies. The accounts testify to complex feelings, but each contingent of American travellers were freshly indignant at Swedish class pride and Swedish disrespect for women. It was with renewed pride in American culture that they returned to the Midwest.|$|E
