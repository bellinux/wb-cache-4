This structure is due to the gravitational interaction of the stars with the disk, in which an array of disks and streams are formed in an inner hole. We calculate the temperature distribution of the optically thin dust in these inner regions considering the variable impinging radiation from both stars and use the observations to estimate the mass variations in the streams. We find that the SEDs for both epochs can be explained with emission from an optically thick inner edge of the circumbinary disk and from the optically thin streams that connect the circumbinary disk with the two smaller circumstellar disks.

We have only to assume that the secondary of RZCas shows a large dark spot on its surface pointing toward the primary, presumably originating from a cooling mechanism by the enthalpy transport via the inner Lagrangian point. The O-C residuals of our solution based on the spectra from 2001 show a complex distribution of circumbinary matter, however, pointing to the occurrence of an episode of rapid mass transfer. This assumption is supported by the deduced change of the orbital period of RZCas of 2 seconds between the two epochs of observations.

40|$|We present ASCA data on RE J 2248 - 511, {{extending}} existing {{optical and}} soft X-ray coverage to 10 keV, and monitoring the soft component. These data show that, despite {{a very strong}} ultrasoft X-ray excess below 0. 3 keV and a soft 0. 3 [...] 2 keV spectral index in earlier ROSAT data, the hard X-ray spectrum (alpha~ - 0. 8; 0. 6 - 10 keV) is typical of type 1 AGN, and the soft component has since disappeared. Optical data <b>taken</b> <b>at</b> two <b>different</b> <b>epochs</b> show that the big blue bump is also highly variable. The strength of the ultrasoft X-ray component and the extreme variability in RE J 2248 - 511 are reminiscent of the behaviour observed in many narrow line Seyfert 1 s (NLS 1 s). However, the high energy end of the ROSAT spectrum, the ASCA spectrum and the Balmer line full widths at half maximum of ~ 3000 km/s in RE J 2248 - 511, are typical of normal Seyfert 1 AGN. The change in the soft X-ray spectrum as observed in the ROSAT and ASCA data {{is consistent with the}} behaviour of Galactic Black Hole Candidates (GBHCs) as they move from a high to a low state, ie. a fall in the ultrasoft component and a hardening of the X-ray continuum. This GBHC analogy has also been proposed for NLS 1 s. Alternatively, the variability may be caused by opacity changes in a hot, optically-thin corona which surrounds a cold, dense accretion disc; this was first suggested by Guainazzi et al. for 1 H 0419 - 577, an object which shows remarkably similar properties to RE J 2248 - 511.

The high signal-to-noise spectra are modelled assuming different emission scenarios and compared with archival spectra taken by XMM-Newton and Chandra. The PG 2112 + 059 X-ray spectra acquired in May 2007 allowed {{the detection of}} a weak iron fluorescent line, which is interpreted as being caused by reflection from neutral material at {{some distance from the}} primary X-ray emitting source. The X-ray spectra of PG 2112 + 059 <b>taken</b> <b>at</b> five <b>different</b> <b>epochs</b> during <b>different</b> flux states can be interpreted within two different scenarios. The first consists of two layers of ionised material with column densities of N_H 5 x 10 ^ 22 cm^- 2 and N_H 3. 5 x 10 ^ 23 cm^- 2, respectively. The first layer is moderately ionised and its ionisation levels follow the flux changes, while the other layer is highly ionised and does not show any correlation with the flux of the source. The spectra can also be interpreted assuming reflection by an ionised accretion disk seen behind a warm absorber. The warm absorber ionisation is consistent with being correlated with the flux of the source, which provides an additional degree of self-consistency with the overall reflection-based model. We explain the spectral variability with light bending according to the models of Miniutti and Fabian and constrain the black hole spin to be a/M > 0. 86. Both scenarios also assume that a distant cold reflector is responsible for the Fe K α emission line. Light bending provides an attractive explanation of the different states of PG 2112 + 059 and may also describe the physical cause of the observed properties of other X-ray weak quasars.

The corona as seen by ASCA is essentially isothermal with a temperature around 0. 3 keV, consistent with the evolutionary picture of coronae of aging solar-type stars.

40|$|A city is {{a dynamic}} entity, which {{environment}} is continuously changing over time. Accordingly, its virtual city models {{also need to be}} regularly updated to support accurate model-based decisions for various applications, including urban planning, emergency response and autonomous navigation. A concept of continuous city modeling is to progressively reconstruct city models by accommodating their changes recognized in spatio-temporal domain, while preserving unchanged structures. A first critical step for continuous city modeling is to coherently register remotely sensed data <b>taken</b> <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>epochs</b> with existing building models. This paper presents a new model-to-image registration method using a context-based geometric hashing (CGH) method to align a single image with existing 3 D building models. This model-to-image registration process consists of three steps: (1) feature extraction; (2) similarity measure; and matching, and (3) estimating exterior orientation parameters (EOPs) of a single image. For feature extraction, we propose two types of matching cues: edged corner features representing the saliency of building corner points with associated edges, and contextual relations among the edged corner features within an individual roof. A set of matched corners are found with given proximity measure through geometric hashing, and optimal matches are then finally determined by maximizing the matching cost encoding contextual similarity between matching candidates. Final matched corners are used for adjusting EOPs of the single airborne image by the least square method based on collinearity equations. The result shows that acceptable accuracy of EOPs of a single image can be achievable using the proposed registration approach as an alternative to a labor-intensive manual registration process...|$|E

Other filaments consist of separate clumps, which occurs number of meteor phenomenon in separate years and non active <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>epoch.</b> A complex view of filament dynamical evolution argues in favor multistage ejection particles into a stream <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>epoch...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{major goal}} of the BepiColombo mission to Mercury is the {{determination}} of the structure and state of Mercury's interior. Here the BepiColombo rotation experiment has been simulated in order to assess the ability to attain the mission goals and to help lay out a series of constraints on the experiment's possible progress. In the rotation experiment pairs of images of identical surface regions <b>taken</b> <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>epochs</b> are used to retrieve information on Mercury's rotation and orientation. The idea is that from observations of the same patch of Mercury's surface at two different solar longitudes of Mercury the orientation of Mercury can be determined, and therefore also the obliquity and rotation variations with respect to the uniform rotation. The estimation of the libration amplitude and obliquity through pattern matching of observed surface landmarks is challenging. The main problem arises from the difficulty to observe the same landmark on the planetary surface repeatedly over the MPO mission lifetime, due to the combination of Mercury's 3 : 2 spin-orbit resonance, the absence of a drift of the MPO polar orbital plane and the need to combine data from different instruments with their own measurement restrictions. By assuming that Mercury occupies a Cassini state and that the spacecraft operates nominally we show that under worst case assumptions the annual libration amplitude and obliquity can be measured with a precision of respectively 1. 4 arcseconds (as) and 1. 0 as over the nominal BepiColombo MPO lifetime with about 25 landmarks for rather stringent illumination restrictions. The outcome of the experiment cannot be easily improved by simply relaxing the observational constraints, or increasing the data volume. Comment: 30 pages, 6 figures, 2 table...|$|E
40|$|A Suzaku X-ray {{observation}} of NGC 4051 taken during 2005 Nov reveals line emission at 5. 44 keV in the rest-frame {{of the galaxy}} which {{does not have an}} obvious origin in known rest-frame atomic transitions. The improvement to the fit statistic when this line is accounted for establishes its reality at > 99. 9 % confidence: we have also verified that the line is detected in the three XIS units independently. Comparison between the data and Monte Carlo simulations shows that the probability of the line being a statistical fluctuation is p < 3. 3 x 10 ^- 4. Consideration of three independent line detections in Suzaku data <b>taken</b> <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>epochs</b> yields a probability p< 3 x 10 ^- 11 and thus conclusively demonstrates that it cannot be a statistical fluctuation in the data. The new line and a strong component of Fe Ka emission from neutral material are prominent when the source flux is low, during 2005. Spectra from 2008 show evidence for a line consistent with having the same flux and energy as that observed during 2005, but inconsistent with having a constant equivalent width against the observed continuum. The stability of the line flux and energy suggests that it may not arise in transient hotspots, as has been suggested for similar lines in other sources, but could arise from a special location in the reprocessor, such as the inner edge of the accretion disk. Alternatively, the line energy may be explained by spallation of Fe into Cr, as discussed in a companion paper. Comment: 18 pages, accepted for publication by Ap...|$|E
40|$|We report new lightcurves and phase {{functions}} for nine Jupiter-family comets (JFCs). They {{were observed in}} the period 2004 - 2015 with various ground telescopes {{as part of the}} Survey of Ensemble Physical Properties of Cometary Nuclei (SEPPCoN) as well as during devoted observing campaigns. We add to this a review of the properties of 35 JFCs with previously published rotation properties. The photometric time-series were obtained in Bessel R, Harris R and SDSS r' filters and were absolutely calibrated using stars from the Pan-STARRS survey. This specially-developed method allowed us to combine data sets <b>taken</b> <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>epochs</b> and instruments with absolute-calibration uncertainty down to 0. 02 mag. We used the resulting time series to improve the rotation periods for comets 14 P/Wolf, 47 P/Ashbrook-Jackson, 94 P/Russell, and 110 P/Hartley 3 and to determine the rotation rates of comets 93 P/Lovas and 162 P/Siding-Spring for the first time. In addition to this, we determined the phase {{functions for}} seven of the examined comets and derived geometric albedos for eight of them. We confirm the known cut-off in bulk densities at ∼ 0. 6 g cm^- 3 if JFCs are strengthless. Using the model of Davidsson (2001) for prolate ellipsoids with typical density and elongations, we conclude that none of the known JFCs require tensile strength larger than 10 - 25 Pa to remain stable against rotational instabilities. We find evidence for an increasing linear phase function coefficient with increasing geometric albedo. The median linear phase function coefficient for JFCs is 0. 046 mag/deg and the median geometric albedo is 4. 2 per cent. Comment: 38 pages, accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} first {{results on the}} {{analysis}} of the structures observed in the jet of the quasar 0836 + 710. We obtain the ridge lines of the jet <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>epochs</b> and several frequencies. We interpret the oscillatory structures obtained as waves that can be attached to the growth of instabilities. We explain how to derive information on the nature and origin of these structures by fitting together the ridge lines <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>epochs</b> and frequencies. Finally we show the predictive power of this approach: by generating an artificial wave and applying the corresponding relativistic and projection effects we show that apparent changes in the jet direction in the inner regions of jets can be attached to the transversal motion of structures.
