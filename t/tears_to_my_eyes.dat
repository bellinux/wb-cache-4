500|$|Macartney {{was a short}} man, {{standing}} 160cm (5" [...] 3). When batting, {{he would}} unconventionally attempt to leg glance yorkers pitched on middle stump down to fine-leg, and often lost his wicket in so doing. He was known for preferring his team-mates to give him candid criticism rather than praise. In later life he condemned modern batsmen; he would explain why he no longer watched cricket by saying [...] "I can't bear watching luscious half-volleys being nudged gently back to bowlers". Sir Neville Cardus wrote that [...] "there was always chivalry in his cricket, a prancing sort of heroism. The dauntlessness of his play, the brave beauty and the original skill bring <b>tears</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> yet." [...] In the late 1940s, Macartney {{received a letter from}} a compiler of Who's Who in Australia, seeking information on his life. Macartney said that he had [...] "no record of figures, nor am I concerned with them. My only interest is {{the manner in which the}} runs are compiled and how wickets are taken, and in the good of the game." [...] "Those sentiments", wrote former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton, [...] "summed up the cricket story of C. G. Macartney".|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{concluding}} musical number, [...] "Rumour Has It" [...] / [...] "Someone Like You", was acclaimed as {{its main}} highlight. Raymund Flandez described Rivera's vocals as [...] "electrifying" [...] and [...] "golden". Futterman {{wrote that the}} performance was one of Glee best sequences: [...] "Mercedes and Santana nail their vocals and the song combines great tracks {{from one of the}} year's biggest albums while capturing both the sass and sadness of the Troubletones at this particular moment." [...] Votta called it the best performance since the cast's rendition of [...] "Don't Stop Believin' in the season one finale, [...] "Journey to Regionals", and stated, [...] "Naya Rivera's powerful vocals and the strong arrangement still packs the emotional punch Glee was targeting." [...] Chaney awarded the sequence a [...] "A+" [...] grade: [...] "Given the emotional stakes raised by Santana's outing, which happened in the scene right before this performance, {{and the fact that it}} marked the series's 300th musical performance, this marriage" [...] of the two Adele songs, [...] "Rumour Has It" [...] and [...] "Someone Like You", was [...] "all the more powerful". Moyler asserted that the number was [...] "perfection" [...] and said, [...] "This is why I watch Glee. It is just brilliant from Mercedes first belting to the snaps on the beat to the choreography with the girls walking in a circle and making little whispers to Santana bringing <b>tears</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> singing 'Someone Like You' as if it was the last song she'll ever sing in her damn life." [...] Cinema Blend's Melissa Duko stated that the show [...] "hit it out of the park" [...] and added that it was her favorite performance of the season. Slezak gave the number an [...] "A+" [...] and wrote, [...] "Nobody can completely match Adele doing Adele, and yet Naya Rivera and Amber Riley somehow made the sum of this mashup a worthy equal to Adele's glorious original parts." [...] In December 2012, TV Guide named the mash-up one of Glee best performances.|$|E
2500|$|On April 1, 2014, Mikulski {{introduced}} the Paycheck Fairness Act (S. 2199; 113th Congress), [...] {{a measure that}} aims to strengthen the Fair Labor Standards Act's protections against pay inequalities based on gender. It is a bill that [...] "punishes employers for retaliating against workers who share wage information, puts the justification burden on employers as to why someone is paid less and allows workers to sue for punitive damages of wage discrimination". Mikulski said that [...] "it brings <b>tears</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> to know women are working so hard and being paid less" [...] and that [...] "it makes me emotional when I hear that... I get angry, I get outraged and I get volcanic".|$|E

6000|$|The <b>tears</b> come <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> as I {{think of}} the Last Day of Old Dumbuck, for, take it as you will, there was a last day of Dumbuck, as of windy Ilios, and of [...] "Carthage left deserted of the sea." ...|$|R
2500|$|On 8 March 1932, Puyi {{made his}} {{ceremonial}} entry into Changchun, sharing his car with Zheng who was beaming with joy, Amakasu whose expression was stern as usual, and Wanrong, who looked miserable. Puyi remembered about {{his first time}} in Changchun: [...] "I saw Japanese gendarmes, and rows of people, wearing all sots of clothes; some were in Chinese jackets and gowns, some were in Western suits and some in traditional Japanese dress, {{and they were all}} holding small flags in their hands. I was thrilled and reflected that I was now seeing the scene that I missed at the harbor. As I walked past them Hsi Hsia [...] pointed out a line of dragon flags between the Japanese ones and said that the men holding them were all Manchu [...] "bannermen" [...] who had been waiting for me to come for twenty years. These words brought <b>tears</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> and I was more strongly convinced than ever that my future was very hopeful". Puyi also noted he was [...] "too preoccupied with my hopes and hates" [...] to realize the [...] "cold comfort that the Changchun citizens, silent from terror and hatred, were giving me". Puyi's friend, the British journalist Woodhead, who covered his arrival in Manchuria, wrote [...] "outside official circles, I met no Chinese who felt any enthusiasm for the new regime", and that the city of Harbin was being terrorized by Chinese and Russian gangsters working for the Japanese, making Harbin [...] "lawless... even its main street unsafe after dark". In an interview with Woodhead, Puyi stated he planned to govern Manchukuo “in the Confucian spirit” and he was “perfectly happy” with his new position. An Italian journalist from the Corriere della Sera newspaper wrote: “I was unable to interview this pale, tired prince who doesn’t’ like to talk, who is always plunged in his meditations and who maybe regrets his life as a simple, studious citizen. He has a fixed stare behind his black-framed glasses. When we were introduced, he responded with a friendly nod. But his smile lasted only a second. We could only await the word of the Master of Ceremonies to give us permission to bow ourselves out. A Japanese colonel, our guide, showed us the triumphal arches, the electric light decorations and endless flags. But all this, say the shopkeepers is [...] "made in Osaka"”.|$|E

6000|$|Her {{utterance}} {{of these}} words brought <b>tears</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes.</b> I laid my hand on her arm, holding her a while, and {{we looked at each}} other through the dusk. [...] "You couldn't do more if he were my son." ...|$|E
60|$|Already {{the news}} had spread that I {{had been chosen}} for a mission, and my little rascals came {{swarming}} out of their tents to cheer me. Ah! it brings the <b>tears</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> old <b>eyes</b> when I think how proud they were of their Colonel.|$|R
60|$|That night, {{after he}} had kissed his sisters, he thought proper to forget even {{to shake hands with}} me, but left the room in silence. I--who, though I had no love, had much {{friendship}} for him--was hurt by the marked omission: so much hurt that <b>tears</b> started <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
6000|$|A lily thou wast when I saw thee first, [...] A lily-bud; but oh, how strange, [...] How full {{of wonder}} was the change, When, ripe with all sweetness, thy full bloom burst!

6000|$|What I {{think of}} him? Why, I {{think he is}} the only great man of his age, {{speaking}} of public men. I think 'Napoleon III devant le peuple anglais' a magnificent State paper. I confess to you it drew the <b>tears</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> as I read it. So grand, so calm, so simply true! ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{last they}} met a poor {{little girl in}} the kitchen, who said, 'Oh! I know the Nightingale well. How she sings!

60|$|Take {{away the}} last stanzas, {{which should be}} applied more {{definitely}} to the body, or cut away altogether as a lie against eternal verity, and the poem stands {{as one of the}} finest of monodies. The nature of human grief never surely was more tenderly intimated or touched--it brought <b>tears</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes.</b> Do read it. He is not a Christian poet, up to this time, but let us listen and hear his next songs. He is one of God's singers, whether he knows it or does not know it.|$|E
60|$|At last with blare of bugle and throb of drum, that {{grand and}} melancholy {{procession}} of time-scarred veterans came to view, and their tattered flags and faded guidons brought quick <b>tears</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> father's <b>eyes.</b> Few of them stepped {{out with a}} swing, many of them limped pitifully--all were white-haired--an army on its downward slope, marching toward its final, silent bivouac.|$|R
60|$|I {{am afraid}} {{you must think}} me--what can you have thought of me for not {{immediately}} answering a letter which brought the <b>tears</b> both <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and <b>my</b> husband's? I was going to write just so, but he said: 'No, do not write yet; wait till we get the book {{and then you can}} speak of it with knowledge.' And I waited.|$|R
500|$|In August 2011, ASAP Rocky {{followed}} with [...] "Peso", which {{first appeared on}} Internet blogs and eventually received radio airplay on New York City's Hot 97. The song also earned him respect in the New York scene, of which he later said, [...] "It bring a <b>tear</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> see native New York people give me my props because New York is stubborn and arrogant". After a bidding war among labels, he signed a record deal with Polo Grounds and RCA on October 14. It was worth $3 million, with $1.7 million for his solo work and $1.3 million to fund his company ASAP Worldwide. He said that he sought a [...] "bigger platform" [...] {{for him and his}} collective with the deal. His first studio album planned to be under the deal, but it allowed him to continue releasing mixtapes through RED Distribution.|$|R
60|$|We {{were now}} {{in the region of}} great snowfields, under which roared swift streams from still higher altitudes. There were {{thousands}} of marmots, which seemed to utter the most intense astonishment at the inexplicable coming of these strange creatures. The s{{now in the}} gullies had a curious bloody line which I could not account for. A little bird high up here uttered a sweet little whistle, so sad, so full of pleading, it almost brought <b>tears</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes.</b> In form it resembled a horned lark, but was smaller and kept very close to the ground.|$|E
6000|$|... "Syne ye maun be nane ither than Mr. Richard Carvel. Yere servan', Mr. Carvel," [...] {{and he made}} me a low bow, to {{the great}} {{dropping}} of jaws round about, and led me into the inn. With trembling hands he took a packet from his cabinet and showed me the letters, twenty-three in all, which Ivie had written home since he had gone out as the King's passenger in '45. The sight of them brought <b>tears</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and carried {{me out of the}} Scotch mist back to dear old Maryland. I had no trouble in convincing mine host that I was the lad eulogized in the scrawls, and he put hand on the very sheet which announced my birth, nineteen years since,--the fourth generation of Carvels Ivie had known.|$|E
60|$|Hurriedly I {{cast off}} my jester's doublet and my head-dress with its jangling bells, {{and with a}} wild exultation, a joy so fierce as almost to bring <b>tears</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> I held my arms aloft whilst that poor craven {{strapped}} about my body the back and breast plates of his corselet. I, the Fool, stood there as arrogant as any knight, whilst with his noble hands the Lord of Pesaro, kneeling, made secure the greaves upon my legs, the sollerets with golden spurs, the cuissarts and the genouilleres. Then he rose up, and with hands that trembled in his eagerness, he put on my brassarts and shoulder-plates, whilst I, myself, drew on my gauntlets. Next he adjusted the gorget, and handed me, last of all, the helm, a splendid head-piece of black and gold, surmounted by the Sforza lion.|$|E
6000|$|A lily thou wast when I saw thee first, [...] A lily-bud; but O, how strange, [...] How full {{of wonder}} was the change, [...] When, ripe with all sweetness, thy full bloom burst!

60|$|I turned away, at this speech, the <b>tears</b> {{starting}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> and saw Lucy {{standing in}} the companion-way. She was waiting to speak to me, and no sooner caught <b>my</b> <b>eye,</b> than beckoning me to her side, she {{let me know that}} <b>my</b> sister desired <b>to</b> see me. Erasing every sign of emotion as soon as possible, I descended with Lucy, and was soon at the side of my sister's berth.|$|R

6000|$|Michael Moon rose for {{the defence}} {{with an air}} of {{depression}} which gave little hope at the outset to the sympathizers with the prisoner. He did not, he said, propose to follow the doctor into the abstract questions. [...] "I do not know enough to be an agnostic," [...] he said, rather wearily, [...] "and I can only master the known and admitted elements in such controversies. As for science and religion, the known and admitted facts are plain enough. All that the parsons say is unproved. All that the doctors say is disproved. That's the only difference between science and religion there's ever been, or will be. Yet these new discoveries touch me, somehow," [...] he said, looking down sorrowfully at his boots. [...] "They remind me of a dear old great-aunt of mine who used to enjoy them in her youth. It brings <b>tears</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes.</b> I can see the old bucket by the garden fence and the line of shimmering poplars behind--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Consider my new proposal, I mean Honolulu. You {{would get}} the Atlantic and the Rocky Mountains, would you not? for bracing. [...] And so much less sea! And then you could {{actually}} see Vailima, which I WOULD like you to, for it's beautiful and my home and tomb that is to be; though it's a wrench not to be planted in Scotland - that I can never deny - if I could only be buried in the hills, under the heather and a table tombstone like the martyrs, where the whaups and plovers are crying! Did you see a man who wrote the STICKIT MINISTER, and dedicated it to me, in words that brought the <b>tears</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> every time I looked at them, 'Where about the graves of the martyrs the whaups are crying. HIS heart remembers how.' [...] Ah, by God, it does! Singular that I should fulfil the Scots destiny throughout, and live a voluntary exile, and have my head filled with the blessed, beastly place all the time! ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{difficulty}} with the artistic house is finding the right people to put into it. In the picture the artistic room never has anybody in it. There is a strip of art embroidery upon the table, together {{with a bowl of}} roses. Upon the ancient high-backed settee lies an item of fancy work, unfinished--just as she left it. In the [...] "study" [...] an open book, face downwards, has been left on a chair. It is the last book he was reading--it has never been disturbed. A pipe of quaint design is cold upon the lintel of the lattice window. No one will ever smoke that pipe again: it must have been difficult to smoke at any time. The sight of the artistic room, as depicted in the furniture catalogue, always brings <b>tears</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes.</b> People once inhabited these rooms, read there those old volumes bound in vellum, smoked--or tried to smoke--these impracticable pipes; white hands, that someone maybe had loved to kiss, once fluttered among the folds of these unfinished antimacassars, or Berlin wool-work slippers, and went away, leaving the things about.|$|E
60|$|It was dreadful {{to me to}} see the Bart mount {{his horse}} and ride off with hanging head. I could not endure it. I threw myself before this English General. I pleaded with him for my friend. I told him how I, Colonel Gerard, would witness what a dashing young officer he was. Ah, my eloquence might have melted the hardest heart; I brought <b>tears</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> own <b>eyes,</b> but none <b>to</b> his. <b>My</b> voice broke, and I could say no more.|$|R
6000|$|... 287 March 13.—Cabinet {{again at}} twelve. Decided to resign ... Gladstone [...] {{made quite a}} {{touching}} little speech. He began playfully.

60|$|With {{a cry of}} {{pleasure}} he sprang toward me and threw his arms about my neck, and {{for a brief moment}} as I held <b>my</b> boy close <b>to</b> me the <b>tears</b> welled <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and I was like to have choked after the manner of some maudlin fool--but I do not regret it, nor am I ashamed.

60|$|Never had I burned so brilliantly as at that supreme {{moment when}} the {{darkness}} fell upon all around me. You are aware that I was faithful to the Emperor in his adversity, and that I refused to sell my sword and my honour to the Bourbons. Never again was I to feel my war horse between my knees, never again to hear the kettledrums and silver trumpets behind me as I rode {{in front of my}} little rascals. But it comforts my heart, my friends, and it brings the <b>tears</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> to think how great I was upon that last day of my soldier life, and to remember that of all the remarkable exploits which have won me the love of so many beautiful women, and the respect of so many noble men, there was none which, in splendour, in audacity, and in the great end which was attained, could compare with my famous ride upon the night of June 18th, 1815. I am aware that the story is often told at mess-tables and in barrack-rooms, so that there are few in the army who have not heard it, but modesty has sealed my lips, until now, my friends, in the privacy of these intimate gatherings, I am inclined to lay the true facts before you.|$|E
6000|$|I am {{very sorry}} {{you and your}} mother have ceased coming out just at the time I've {{something}} to show you. My little old house is really pretty enough for that, and has given me, all this wonderful, hot, rainless, radiant summer, a peace that would pass understanding if I had only got through the first botherations a little earlier in the season. However, I've done very well--have only not been quite such an anchorite as I had planned. The bump of luggage has been frequent on my stair, and the conference with the cook proved a greater strain than, in that particular way, I have ever before had to meet. But it's doubtless my own fault. I should have sought a drearier refuge. I am staying here late--as far on into the autumn as wind and weather may permit. I hope this will find you in {{the very heart of}} the American October crystal.... I congratulate you, my dear Fanny, on all the warm personal, local life that surrounds you, and that you touch at so many points very much more the normal state for one's afternoon of existence, after all, than my expatriated one. But we go on as we may. I don't feel as if I had thanked you half enough for your so many beautiful bulletins--and can only ask you to believe that each, in its order, more or less brought <b>tears</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes.</b> Recall me, please, to your mother's kindest remembrance, and believe me ...|$|E

Of course you are aware that he got no drink during the seven years of his imprisonment. Now that he is free he refuses to let a drop of {{anything}} stronger than water pass his lips. He thinks it is his only chance, and I believe he is right. He says that nothing but the thought of Nora, and the hope of one day being permitted to return to ask her forgiveness on his knees, enabled him to endure his long captivity with resignation. I do assure you, father, that it almost brings <b>tears</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> to see the way in which that man humbles himself before his daughter. Nora's joy is far too deep for words, but it is written plainly in her face. She spent all her spare time with him at first, reading the Bible to him, and trying to convince him that it was not the thought of her, but God's mercy and love that had put it into his heart to repent, and desire to reform. He does not seem quite inclined to take that view of it, but he will come to it, sooner or later, for we have the sure promise that the Lord will finish the good work He has begun. We have hired a room for him in a little village within half a mile of us. It is small, but comfortable enough, and he seems to be quite content with it--as well he may be, with Nora and the children going constantly about him! ...|$|E
