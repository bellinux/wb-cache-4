5|$|On {{his arrival}} in Cairo, Clarke began to build a network of useful contacts. He befriended Lieutenant-Colonel Raymund Maunsell, who {{operated}} Security Intelligence Middle East (SIME), the agency in charge of counter-espionage in the region. Maunsell later worked closely with Clarke, helping to feed misinformation to the enemy via double agents. Clarke's first deception was a scheme to mislead Italian forces into expecting an invasion of Italian Somaliland instead of Eritrea, the real Allied target. Operation Camilla fooled the Italian leadership completely but instead of diverting troops as the British hoped, they withdrew their forces into Eritrea. From this failure Clarke learned a first lesson, one he would teach to many other deception officers during the war: {{that the key to}} deception was not to make your enemy think what you wish but to get them <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want.</b>|$|E
25|$|Justice Scalia says that, {{generally}} speaking, {{the legislature}} {{has the power}} to make laws and the judiciary should only interpret the laws that are made or are explicitly in the Constitution. That is not Justice Brown's philosophy. It is simply intellectually dishonest and logically incoherent to suggest that somehow the Constitution recognizes an unlimited right <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> with your private property and yet does not recognize a right to privacy that would forbid the Government from intruding in your bedroom. Yet {{that seems to be the}} manner in which Justice Brown would interpret our most cherished document.|$|E
500|$|... "I'm used to riding {{roughshod over}} studio executives," [...] Gilliam explained, [...] "but the Weinsteins rode roughshod over me." [...] Gilliam got so upset, filming {{was shut down}} for nearly two weeks. Matt Damon {{reflected}} on the situation: [...] "I've {{never been in a}} situation like that. Terry was spitting rage at the system, at the Weinsteins. You can't try and impose big compromises on a visionary director like him. If you try to force him <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> creatively, he'll go nuclear." [...] The feud between Gilliam and the Weinsteins was eventually settled, although Bob Weinstein blamed the entire situation on yellow journalism. Filming was scheduled to end in October, but due to various problems during filming, principal photography did not end until the following 27 November.|$|E

500|$|The lack of graphics, poor {{interface}} {{and controls}} {{were seen as}} {{the reasons for the}} game's difficulty. However, the reviewers also noted most of it having a role in gameplay and the argument that the text-based graphics forces players to use their own imagination, making it more engaging. Weiner wrote, [...] " [...] may not look real, but once you're hooked, it feels vast, enveloping, alive. A micro-manager's dream, the game gleefully blurs the distinction between painstaking labor and creative thrill." [...] Quintin Smith from Rock, Paper, Shotgun said, [...] "The interface has a tough job to do, bless it, but getting it <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> is like teaching a beetle to cook." [...] Ars Technica's Casey Johnston highlighted the difficulty in performing basic actions and felt that tinkering or experimenting ended up being unproductive; she compared it to [...] "trying to build a skyscraper by banging two rocks together". She pointed out the lack of in-game tutorial and said how players can learn by themselves in other games, which are also open-ended or have intuitive mechanics, but in Dwarf Fortress, there is no autonomy [...] "even after hours" [...] of gameplay.|$|E

Trouble with women like you is, you always want to ARGUE. Can't take things the way they are. Got to argue. Well, I'm not going to argue about this in any way, shape, manner, or form. Trouble with you is, you don't make any effort to appreciate us.

6000|$|... "I don't see, Mrs. Plessington," [...] he was saying, [...] "that {{all this}} amounts {{to more than a}} kind of Glorious District Visiting. That is how I see it.

You want to compel them by this Payment in Kind of yours <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> them to do instead of trying to make them want to do it. Now, I think your {{business}} is to make them want to do it. You may perhaps increase the amount of milk in babies, and the amount of whitewash in cottages and slums by your methods--I don't dispute the promise of your statistics--but you're going to do it at a cost of human self-respect that's out of all proportion----" ...|$|E

I say that if youve {{happiness}} within yourself, you dont need to seek it outside, spending money on drink and theatres and bad company, and being miserable after all.

They're slave dogs, that's what mongrels are. They ain't got courage, and you don't want courage in a {{performing}} dog. You want fear. Now you give a thoroughbred a licking and see what happens. Sometimes they die. I've known them to die. And if they don't die, what do they do? Either they go stubborn, or vicious, or both. Sometimes they just go to biting and foaming. You can kill them, but you can't keep them from biting and foaming. Or they'll go straight stubborn. They're the worst. They're the passive resisters--that's what I call them. They won't fight back. You can flog them to death, but it won't buy you anything. They're like those Christians {{that used to be}} burned at the stake or boiled in oil. They've got their opinions, and nothing you can do will change them. They'll die first. [...] . And they do. I've had them. I was learning myself [...] . and I learned to leave the thoroughbred alone. They beat you out. They get your goat. You never get theirs.
