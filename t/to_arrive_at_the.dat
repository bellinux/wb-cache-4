5|$|On {{the evening}} of 4 January, the final execute order was issued for a 02:45 launch of two CH-53E Super Stallions <b>to</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> embassy at dawn. The 60 {{soldiers}} selected for the security detail were issued weapons and ammunition. Two Marine Corps KC-130 refueling tankers were mobilized closer to the operation, from Bahrain to Oman, to refuel the helicopters en route to Mogadishu and the two helicopters transferred from Trenton to Guam.|$|E
5|$|The first-day battle {{proceeded}} {{in three}} phases as combatants continued <b>to</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> battlefield. In the morning, two brigades of Confederate Maj. Gen. Henry Heth's division (of Lt. Gen. A.P. Hill's Third Corps) were delayed by dismounted Union cavalrymen under Brig. Gen. John Buford. As infantry reinforcements arrived under Maj. Gen. John F.

5|$|First rescue efforts {{came from}} {{surviving}} neighbours and co-workers who pulled and dug out victims from buildings. The initial informal response was soon joined by surviving policemen, firefighters and military personnel {{who began to}} arrive, as did anyone with a working vehicle; cars, trucks and delivery wagons of all kinds were enlisted to collect the wounded. A flood of victims soon began <b>to</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> city's hospitals, which were quickly overwhelmed. The new military hospital, Camp Hill, admitted approximately 1400 victims on 6 December.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, a British {{mission was}} sent to the United States to assist the American Manhattan Project in {{developing}} atomic bombs. First <b>to</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Los Alamos Laboratory were Frisch and Titterton, on 13 December 1943. The two shared an office at first, but were soon working on different projects. Titterton worked in collaboration with the American physicist Boyce McDaniel in Robert R. Wilson's P-1 (Cyclotron) Group. Together, they searched for delays between nuclear fission and the emission of prompt neutrons. A sizeable delay could make a nuclear chain reaction impractical. They calculated that most were emitted in less than 1 nanosecond; subsequent experiments demonstrated that fission took less than a nanosecond too.|$|E
5|$|Ney now had two problems: he {{expected}} support columns from Soult's division on both flanks to arrive momentarily {{and he did}} not know that the Austrians had arrived in force, directly in front of his center. Although Roget's brigade was strong enough to prevent the Austrians from flanking the position, Gazan's brigade was too weak to resist the superior Austrian force, which was growing visibly stronger as Hotze's troops continued <b>to</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> forward line and throw themselves into the fray.|$|E

Three men were sentenced to 20 years imprisonment for this attack.|$|R
5|$|On September 1, 2005, {{the park}} officially {{announced}} Goliath, a $20,000,000 steel Hyper Coaster. By {{the end of}} the 2005 season, the rides Great Gasp and Looping Starship were closed and removed from the park {{to make room for the}} new roller coaster. Foundations for Goliath's supports began to be poured in September 2005. In early October, track began <b>to</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> park; erection of the supports and track began soon after. In November and December, construction on the lift hill was complete. In March 2006, Goliath's trains were delivered to the park. After construction on the track and testing was complete, the roller coaster opened to the public on April 1, 2006.|$|E
5|$|Some {{women were}} able <b>to</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{recruiting}} station in a man's suit, deny ever {{having been in}} love with another woman, and be easily inducted. Sexual activity, however, was forbidden, and blue discharge was almost certain if one identified oneself as a lesbian. As women found each other, they formed into tight groups on base, socialized at service clubs, and began to use code words. Historian Allan Bérubé documented that homosexuals in the armed forces either consciously or subconsciously refused to identify themselves as homosexual or lesbian, and also never spoke about others' orientation.|$|E
5|$|The lobby guard {{returned}} {{a call to}} the alarm monitoring service, which had called when the alarm initially went off to confirm that there was a fire, but never called the Philadelphia Fire Department. The first call came from someone on the street who saw smoke coming from the building. During the first 911 call, at about 8:27 PM, the alarm company alerted the fire department to the fire. Engine 43 was the first firefighting unit <b>to</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> scene and reported seeing heavy smoke and flames in one of the windows. As firefighters started fighting the fire it had grown with flames breaking through windows and lapping {{up the side of the}} building.|$|E

5|$|The team {{employs the}} {{differential}} diagnosis method, listing possible etiologies on a whiteboard, then eliminating most of them, usually {{because one of the}} team (most often House) provides logical reasons for ruling them out. Typically, the patient is misdiagnosed at least once and accordingly receives some treatments that are at best useless; this usually causes further complications, but—as the nature of the complications often provides valuable new evidence—eventually these help them diagnose the patient correctly. House often tends <b>to</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> correct diagnosis seemingly out of the blue, often inspired by a passing remark made by another character. Diagnoses range from relatively common to very rare diseases.|$|E
5|$|There {{were several}} {{bystanders}} {{who witnessed the}} murder and managed to see {{the faces of the}} assassins, including Juan Manuel Bautista, a colleague of Buendía; Rogelio Barrera Galindo, a man who had parked his vehicle close to the journalist's; and Felipe Flores Fernández, a bus driver. Among the first <b>to</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> murder scene was José Antonio Zorrilla Pérez, then-head of the Federal Security Directorate (DFS), Mexico's equivalent of the FBI, and one of Buendía's main sources for his political publications. Photos of Buendía's corpse circulated across Mexico {{and the rest of the}} world.|$|E
5|$|D-Day at Utah {{began at}} 01:30, {{when the first}} of the {{airborne}} units arrived, tasked with securing the key crossroads at Sainte-Mère-Église and controlling the causeways through the flooded farmland behind Utah so the infantry could advance inland. While some airborne objectives were quickly met, many paratroopers landed far from their drop zones and were unable to fulfill their objectives on the first day. On the beach itself, infantry and tanks landed in four waves beginning at 06:30 and quickly secured the immediate area with minimal casualties. Meanwhile, engineers set to work clearing the area of obstacles and mines, and additional waves of reinforcements continued <b>to</b> <b>arrive.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> close of D-Day, Allied forces had only captured about half of the planned area and contingents of German defenders remained, but the beachhead was secure.|$|E

5|$|Despite earlier derision, {{a number}} of Militia units went on to perform with {{distinction}} during the Pacific War, especially in 1942, when they fought Japanese forces in New Guinea. As {{the situation in the}} Pacific worsened in July 1942 and the Japanese drove towards Port Moresby, members of the Militia found themselves on the front lines. As reinforcements were brought up from Australia, the Militia units that had been sent to New Guinea as garrison troops earlier in the war were called upon to fight a stubborn rearguard action on the Kokoda Track to delay the Japanese advance long enough for these reinforcements <b>to</b> <b>arrive.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time, the Militia battalions of the 7th Brigade {{played a key role in}} the Battle of Milne Bay, when Australian and United States forces defeated the Japanese in a large-scale battle for the first time during the war.|$|E
5|$|For Commander-in-Chief of the Luftwaffe Hermann Göring it was {{an ongoing}} concern that {{inadequate}} numbers of fighters were able to continually engage the bomber streams, {{at the very time}} that the USAAF's 8th Air Force's new commander, Maj. Gen. Jimmy Doolittle had instituted a new fighter strategy against the Luftwaffe. Hence on 23 February 1944 — near the midpoint of the USAAF's Big Week bomber offensive against the Luftwaffe, also being carried out by the 15th Air Force flying out of Italian bases — Generalmajor Joseph Schmid Commander of I. Jagdkorps established a new rule for the fighters returning to base. They were <b>to</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> nearest designated fighter airfield for resupply instead of returning to their own base. They were to be commanded by the senior pilot landing on that airfield, irrespective of their unit. This was meant to turn around the fighters in time to intercept returning bombers.|$|E
5|$|Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, David Lloyd George, {{as well as}} future Prime Minister Winston Churchill were in {{attendance}} for the match. The press billed the match as England versus Wales, and noted that the Welsh fans included high numbers of woman as well as mothers with babies. There were special trains laid on for the Cardiff fans, which began arriving at Paddington train station from 4am onwards. The Metropolitan Railway put on additional trains to commute fans from Baker Street station to Wembley Park; one every two minutes. Between 11am to kick off, 30,000 fans per hour travelled this route; some 100,000 fans were expected <b>to</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ground. The Welsh fans made special excursions across London; some travelled to St. Paul's Cathedral, where they sang Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau. Other fans went to The Cenotaph, Whitehall, where they dressed it in Welsh colours to honour the veterans of the First World War.|$|E
