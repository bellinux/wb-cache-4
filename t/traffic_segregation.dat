The positive association of population density and land prices raises an interesting question regarding support for government interventions to impede the sprawling of urban areas. While the standard arguments regarding costs associated with sprawl (e.g. in terms of greater <b>traffic</b> congestion, <b>segregation,</b> air pollution and loss of open space) are not explicitly tested in this paper, nonetheless, it shows that a good transportation system offering reduction in commuting costs may substantially offset the negative impacts on prices due to increasing suburbanization.|$|R
40|$|Morphine {{inefficiency}} {{to induce}} the internalization of mu opioid (MOP) receptors observed in numerous experimental models constitutes a paradigm of G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) functional selectivity. We recently described that activation of Gαq/ 11 proteins through 5 -HT 2 A serotonin receptors co-expressed {{in the same}} cells facilitates MOP receptor endocytosis promoted by morphine. In order to explore whether a different Gαq/ 11 coupled GPCR would emulate this effect, a double stable Flp-In T-REx HEK 293 cell line permanently expressing MOP-YFP receptors along with FLAG-M 3 -Cerulean receptors expressed in an inducible manner was generated. Fluorescence microscopy examination of these cells revealed a co-distribution of both receptors mainly compartmentalized in plasma membrane. Concurrent stimulation with carbachol and morphine promoted MOP receptor internalization, desensitization and down-regulation and this facilitation was not dependent on PKC activation. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that FLAG-M 3 -Cerulean/MOP-YFP receptors interact forming heteromeric complexes in a time depending manner, i. e. the strongest interaction was detected after 96 h of FLAG-M 3 -Cerulean induced expression. Under these experimental conditions, treatment of cells with carbachol plus morphine resulted in the internalization of both receptors within separated endocytic vesicles as visualized by confocal microscopy. This <b>trafficking</b> <b>segregation</b> observed for FLAG-M 3 -Cerulean and MOP-YFP receptors upon agonist stimulation suggests that this protein-protein interaction presents temporal and dynamic properties. Moreover, MOP-YFP receptor internalization facilitated by FLAG-M 3 -Cerulean receptors is independent of the constitution of heteromeric complexes. [Abstract copyright: Copyright © 2017.

Although the introduction of the mass-produced car represented a revolution in mobility and convenience, creating job demand and tax revenue, the high motorisation rates also brought severe consequences to the society and to the environment. The modern negative consequences of heavy automotive use include the use of non-renewable fuels, a dramatic increase in the rate of accidental death, the disconnection of local community, the rise in obesity and cardiovascular diseases, the emission of air and noise pollution, the emission of greenhouse gases, generation of urban sprawl and <b>traffic,</b> <b>segregation</b> of pedestrians and other active mobility means of transport, decrease in the railway network, urban decay and the high cost per unit-distance on which the car paradigm is based.|$|E

40|$|SummaryDistinct {{molecules}} are segregated into somatodendritic and axonal compartments of polarized neurons, but mechanisms {{underlying the}} development and maintenance of such segregation remain largely unclear. In cultured hippocampal neurons, we observed an ankyrin G- and F-actin-dependent structure {{that emerged in the}} cytoplasm of the axon initial segment (AIS) within 2 days after axon/dendrite differentiation, imposing a selective filter for diffusion of macromolecules and transport of vesicular carriers into the axon. Axonal entry was allowed for KIF 5 -driven carriers of synaptic vesicle protein VAMP 2, but not for KIF 17 -driven carriers of dendrite-targeting NMDA receptor subunit NR 2 B. Comparisons of transport rates between chimeric forms of KIF 17 and KIF 5 B, with the motor and cargo-binding domains switched, and between KIF 5 loaded with VAMP 2 versus GluR 2 suggest that axonal entry of vesicular carriers depends on the transport efficacy of KIF-cargo complexes. This selective AIS filtering may contribute to preferential <b>trafficking</b> and <b>segregation</b> of cellular components in polarized neurons...|$|R

50|$|Faced {{with the}} {{uncertainty}} of passing SB 1062 to allow recreational use on fill, Disney unveiled a revised proposal in October 1991 {{reducing the amount of}} fill required for Port Disney from 250 acre to 85 acre.

In order to avoid the recreational use restriction, the land created by new fill would be used by the oceanographic research institute and port use; the DisneySea theme park would be moved onto existing Port-side land and reconfigured to fit within the land freed up by moving the Queen Mary to the cruise ship terminal and relocating (or closing) existing harbor offices and businesses. At the same time, the Port Disney project was renamed to DisneySea, as some foreign customers of the Port of Long Beach thought the project included renaming the entire Port of Long Beach to Port Disney.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose an {{optimized}} WLAN MAC protocol for multimedia applications.

40|$|In human crowds {{as well as}} in many animal societies, local {{interactions}} among individuals often give rise to self-organized collective organizations that offer functional benefits to the group.

40|$|Small Ubiquitin-related MOdifier (SUMO) {{modification}} {{was initially}} {{identified as a}} reversible post-translational modification that affects the regulation of diverse cellular processes, including signal transduction, protein <b>trafficking,</b> chromosome <b>segregation,</b> and DNA repair. Increasing {{evidence suggests that the}} SUMO system also {{plays an important role in}} regulating chromatin organization and transcription. It is thus not surprising that double-stranded DNA viruses, such as Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), have exploited SUMO modification as a means of modulating viral chromatin remodeling during the latent-lytic switch. In addition, SUMO regulation allows the disassembly and assembly of promyelocytic leukemia protein-nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), an intrinsic antiviral host defense, during the viral replication cycle. Overcoming PML-NB-mediated cellular intrinsic immunity is essential to allow the initial transcription and replication of the herpesvirus genome after de novo infection. As a consequence, KSHV has evolved a way as to produce multiple SUMO regulatory viral proteins to modulate the cellular SUMO environment in a dynamic way during its life cycle. Remarkably, KSHV encodes one gene product (K-bZIP) with SUMO-ligase activities and one gene product (K-Rta) that exhibits SUMO-targeting ubiquitin ligase (STUbL) activity. In addition, at least two viral products are sumoylated that have functional importance. Furthermore, sumoylation can be modulated by other viral gene products, such as the viral protein kinase Orf 36. Interference with the sumoylation of specific viral targets represents a potential therapeutic strategy when treating KSHV, as well as other oncogenic herpesviruses. Here, we summarize the different ways KSHV exploits and manipulates the cellular SUMO system and explore the multi-faceted functions of SUMO during KSHV’s life cycle and pathogenesis...|$|R

We demonstrate here that SENP 5, a previously uncharacterized Ulp 1 homolog, has SUMO C-terminal hydrolase and SUMO isopeptidase activities. In contrast to other SENPs, the C-terminal catalytic domain of SENP 5 preferentially processed SUMO- 3 compared to SUMO- 1 precursors and preferentially removed SUMO- 2 and SUMO- 3 from SUMO-modified RanGAP 1 in vitro. In cotransfection assays, SENP 5 preferentially reduced high-molecular-weight conjugates of SUMO- 2 compared to SUMO- 1 in vivo. Full-length SENP 5 localized to the nucleolus. Deletion of the noncatalytic N-terminal domain led to loss of nucleolar localization and increased de-SUMOylation activity in vivo. Knockdown of SENP 5 by RNA interference resulted in increased levels of SUMO- 1 and SUMO- 2 / 3 conjugates, inhibition of cell proliferation, defects in nuclear morphology, and appearance of binucleate cells, revealing an essential role for SENP 5 in mitosis and/or cytokinesis. These findings establish SENP 5 as a SUMO-specific protease required for cell division and suggest that mechanisms involving both the catalytic and noncatalytic domains determine the distinct substrate specificities of the mammalian SUMO-specific proteases...|$|R

In previous publications we have dealt with their morphology, relationships with the nuclear membranes, chromatin fibers and cytoskeletal filaments; and more recently, with their measurements at high electron microscope resolution. In this article we have calculated the mass and molecular weight of 336 isolated nuclear rings from human circulating lymphocytes using a photometric procedure and polystyrene latex spheres as the standard for weight calibration. Our results show a range of mass of 0. 4 - 35. 5 x 10 -~ 6 g (equivalent to 0. 2 - 21. 2 x l 0 s Da with a positively skewed distribution (median: 3. 3 × 10 -~ 6 g or 2. 0 x 108 Da). Mass and volume of nuclear rings were highly correlated. In addition, {{it was possible to}} calculate the area, the whole mass and the mass per unit area of the nuclear envelope present {{in the center of the}} nuclear rings. The mass of this area also shows a lognormal distribution (median of mass/unit area: 37. 3 x l 0 - 8 pg/nm 2 or 1. 9 × 105 Da/nm 2).

40|$|Urban {{land use}} observably induces and generates <b>traffic</b> {{particularly}} where <b>segregation</b> among categories of land uses are distinct. Zoning in land use that distinguishes {{residential and commercial}} zones would create the needs of motorized transport due to journey to works and other purposes, provided that the proximity between residential and commercial zones is absence. In Bangkok, this state exists because of significant residential developments in the suburban areas. Bangkok has been sprawling into various directions particularly to North, Northeast, East and Southeast to form Bangkok Metropolitan Region. This experience makes motorized travel demand increasing, and reducing it would be indispensable from the environment and energy viewpoints. This paper explores the current conditions of land use and transportation relationship in Bangkok that affects urban air quality. With {{the growing number of}} population of Bangkok and insufficient integration of transit systems, the number of private vehicles operating on road is increasing every year. Since vehicles predominantly use fossil fuels this trend has lead to the degradation of air quality until 1996. However, with synergistic efforts in both urban development and transport sectors that commenced in 1997, the air quality in Bangkok is considerably improving. A number of solutions had been adapted to cope with the problem of air quality. While urban planners introduced strategies to promote poly-centric development of the city and thereby dispersing the traffic to limited areas, the transport planners employed a series of measures to reduce the vehicular emissions. The cumulative effects of these strategies are evident by the improving air quality in terms of most indicators. The paper suggests to create pedestrian friendly environment in inner city areas that could further improve urban air quality since it encourages non-motorized travel...|$|R
40|$|Cell {{polarity}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} fundamental processes throughout multicellular organisms. The establishment and maintenance of cell polarity rely heavily on a set of cellular signaling cascades tightly controlling <b>trafficking</b> and <b>segregation</b> of bioactive macromolecules to specific cellular destinations at particular time periods. The evolutionarily conserved multi-PDZ domain containing Par protein complex, Par- 3 /Par- 6 /aPKC, is a central participant in the regulation of cell polarity. Asymmetric positioning of the Par complex is absolutely required for both establishment and maintenance of cell polarity, presumably by assembling and targeting cell polarity protein complexes and other determinants to specific cellular localizations. However, the biochemical and structural basis of such Par complex-mediated cell polarity regulation is poorly understood prior to this thesis study. The central theme of this thesis work has been focusing on the elucidation of the molecular and functional mechanisms of Par- 3 in the regulation of cell polarity. Chapter 1 and 2 provide an overall introduction of the backgrounds of the thesis work. In Chapter 3, I comprehensively characterized the structure and function of the N-terminal oligomerization domain (NTD) of Par- 3. The 3 D solution structure of the NTD monomer adopts a ubiquitin-like fold similar to the PB 1 domain. The structural characterization and biochemical analysis revealed that the NTD domains form a front-to-back homomultimer with a helical fiber-like structure. I also demonstrated that Par- 3 NTD plays an essential role for its correct cellular localization and cell polarity regulation in an epithelial cell model. In Chapter 4, I discovered that PDZ 2 domain from Par- 3 serves as a lipid-membrane binding module and the molecular basis for such PDZ-lipid interaction is deciphered in detail for the first time by combinations of multiple structural and biochemical approaches. Both a conserved positively charged surface and a specific binding pocket for the head group of phosphoinositides are required for PDZ 2 -lipid interaction. A flexible hydrophobic loop of Par- 3 PDZ 2 inserts into membrane bilayers upon membrane binding. Interestingly, the canonical peptide ligand binding groove of the PDZ domain partially overlaps with the lipid head group binding pocket, suggesting a potential functional switch of Par- 3 PDZ 2. We further demonstrated that binding to lipid membrane is a general property of PDZ domain. We assayed the lipid binding capacities of around 100 different mammalian PDZ domains and found that a subset of PDZ domains (15 PDZs) are positive lipid binders. One of these lipid-binding PDZ domains is PICK 1 PDZ (elaborated in Chapter 5), which contains a distinct binding mode from that of Par- 3 PDZ 2. We conclude that binding to lipid membrane is likely to be the second most prevalent function of PDZs known to data. The biological implications of PDZ-lipid membrane interactions are also discussed in both Chapter 4 and 5...|$|R
40|$|Providing {{quality of}} service (QoS) for {{multimedia}} applications in wireless local area networks (WLAN) is a very challenging task. This is mainly due to the real-time nature of multimedia traffic such as voice and video applications, that are sensitive to delay and jitter. QoS guarantees for real-time traffic must be imposed in WLAN so as to enable WLAN users to fully benefit from multimedia applications. The current medium access control (MAC) protocol that is widely used is the legacy IEEE 802. 11, but this protocol does not support QoS for realtime traffic. To enhance the legacy 802. 11, the IEEE 802. 11 e protocol was introduced to support QoS through prioritization of traffic. The 802. 11 e introduces a new co-ordination function known as hybrid coordination function (HCF). In this paper we study the performance of multimedia traffic in the legacy 802. 11 and 802. 11 e and propose a technique to improve realtime traffic in multimedia applications by <b>traffic</b> <b>segregation.</b> We show that segregation of multimedia traffic improves delay and jitter performance of real-time traffic...|$|E

30|$|Several studies {{agree that}} a {{paradigm}} shift is needed to address the above-mentioned social issues [2, 20, 24, 32, 47]. Alternative planning approaches emphasize the social dimension of transport by focusing on accessibility and people, rather than on mobility and traffic [20, 32]. For {{the purpose of this}} study, we focus on Banister’s [20] sustainable mobility framework. This framework prioritizes a transport system based on local concerns and favours active and public transportation. This hierarchy (from pedestrians to cars) is presented as essential for more equitable urban transportation systems, as it provides individuals with a greater diversity of transportation options to access opportunities and contributes to reducing the negative externalities associated with car use. Furthermore, this approach considers the street as a public space to be shared between different users, rather than as a road dedicated to traffic, and prioritizes the integration of different modes, rather than <b>traffic</b> <b>segregation.</b> The sustainable mobility paradigm therefore supports the reallocation of existing road space, designed mainly for cars, to other users and other uses. Finally, as a complement to forecasting and modelling approaches, Banister [20] suggests scenario development and visioning exercises.|$|E
40|$|Ethernet {{is a key}} {{component}} of the standards used for digital process buses in transmission substations, namely IEC 61850 and IEEE Std 1588 - 2008 (PTPv 2). These standards use multicast Ethernet frames that can be processed by more than one device. This presents some significant engineering challenges when implementing a sampled value process bus due to the large amount of network traffic. A system of network <b>traffic</b> <b>segregation</b> using a combination of Virtual LAN (VLAN) and multicast address filtering using managed Ethernet switches is presented. This includes VLAN prioritisation of traffic classes such as the IEC 61850 protocols GOOSE, MMS and sampled values (SV), and other protocols like PTPv 2. Multicast address filtering is used to limit SV/GOOSE traffic to defined subsets of subscribers. A method to map substation plant reference designations to multicast address ranges is proposed that enables engineers to determine the type of traffic and location of the source by inspecting the destination address. This method and the proposed filtering strategy simplifies future changes to the prioritisation of network traffic, and is applicable to both process bus and station bus applications...|$|E
40|$|New {{substation}} technology, such as non-conventional instrument transformers,and a need {{to reduce}} design and construction costs, are driving the adoption of Ethernet based digital process bus networks for high voltage substations. Protection and control applications can share a process bus, making more efficient use of the network infrastructure. This paper classifies and defines performance requirements for the protocols used in a process bus {{on the basis of}} application. These include GOOSE, SNMP and IEC 61850 - 9 - 2 sampled values. A method, based on the Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP) and virtual local area networks, is presented that separates management and monitoring traffic {{from the rest of the}} process bus. A quantitative investigation of the interaction between various protocols used in a process bus is described. These tests also validate the effectiveness of the MSTP based <b>traffic</b> <b>segregation</b> method. While this paper focusses on a substation automation network, the results are applicable to other real-time industrial networks that implement multiple protocols. High volume sampled value data and time-critical circuit breaker tripping commands do not interact on a full duplex switched Ethernet network, even under very high network load conditions. This enables an efficient digital network to replace a large number of conventional analog connections between control rooms and high voltage switchyards...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY By reserving {{transmission}} capacity {{on a series}} of links from one node to another, making a virtual path connection (VPC) between these nodes, several benefits are obtained. VPCs will simplify routing at transit nodes, connection admission control, and QoS management by <b>traffic</b> <b>segregation.</b> As telecommunications traffics experience variations in the number of calls per time unit due to office hours, inaccurate forecasting, quick changes in traffic loads, and changes in the types of traffic (as in introduction of new services), {{there is a need to}} cope for this by adaptive capacity reallocation between different VPCs. We have developed a type of local VPC capacity management policy that uses an allocation function to determine the needed capacity for the coming updating interval, based on the current number of active connections but independently of the offered traffic. We determine its optimal parameters, and the optimal updating interval for different overhead costs. Our policy is shown to be able to combine benefits from both VP and VC routing by fast capacity reallocations. The method of signaling is easy to implement and our evaluations indicate that the method is robust. This paper is based on our earlier work, described in [19]. The calculations are simplified and the methodology is changed. 1...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn urban network's {{shape and}} {{characteristics}} can have high influence on many mobility aspects, such as travel distance, mode choice and safety. For example, can a tram {{be a real}} competition to the car? Definitely yes if the car is stuck in a traffic jam and the tram has priority, but not only in such case! With a proper system design a tram may offer a faster travel to the city centre than the car. On the other hand if the tram provides faster travel than the car only during several peak hours, it is usually enough to provide better service {{for a majority of}} people travelling in such direction. For intense on-street public transport networks full priority is not always possible. This is another reason to resign from a paradigm of providing public transport along major car arteries – the urban public transport will be more efficient, also in speed terms, when it will be closer to commuters. Such closeness means a decrease in segregation, so part of the paper will be dedicated to theoretical calculations and practical observations of allowable tram and bus speeds on city streets. Safety leads to a problem of homogeneity of streets’ technical class and of coherence between streets’ functional and technical classes. Data from both Poland and other countries shows, that such elements as traffic intensity and extend of <b>traffic</b> <b>segregation</b> should strictly coincide with proper technical parameters. It is problematic, since many European streets, for historical reasons, cannot be rebuilt to fully meet uniform standards of one class, so results of inquiries on how to make these standards adjustable without compromising safety or living quality will be presented. Concluding, the aim {{of this paper is to}} gather experience gained from theoretical calculations and practical designs, and present a street network as a system. A system that properly implemented allows for sustainable, efficient and safe mobility. A system that to some extend is adjustable to local historical conditions. A system that, unfortunately due to local pressure and political reasons, is often overridden, with sober consequences. The investigations were focused on specific locations, but strengthened with theoretical calculations and generalised allowing for wide implementations...|$|E
