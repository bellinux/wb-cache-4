25|$|To you the IRA and all {{who support}} you or defend you, {{we have to}} say <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> dirty today. Foul and dirty deeds by Irishmen are making Ireland a foul and dirty place, for it is things done by Irishmen that make us unclean. What the British could never do, what the Unionists could never do, you have done. You have made us bow our heads in shame and that is a dirty feeling. The IRA is like a cancer in the body of Ireland, {{spreading}} death, killing and corruption. It is the unrelenting enemy of life and the community is afraid because it cannot see or identify it. We want the cancer of the IRA removed from our midst but not by means that will leave the moral fibre of society damaged and the system unclean. Fighting evil by corrupt means kills pawns like Joe and leaves every one of us vulnerable and afraid. And it allows Joe's killers to draw a sickening veneer of respectability over cold-blooded murder and to wash their hands like Pontius Pilate.|$|E

The theory was not immediately accepted, in part because conservation of energy had not yet been established, and it was not obvious to physicists how the collisions between molecules could be perfectly elastic.|$|E

But now that we're given this huge responsibility, almost, I feel like it's our duty to take it seriously." [...] Wong Fu presented [...] "one of the most antipicated workshops" [...] on sustaining an independent production company at the 2008 Intercollegiate Taiwanese American Students Association Midwest Conference. They were also the keynote speakers at the Intercollegiate Taiwanese American Students Association 2010 West Coast Conference, which was hosted at their alma mater, UC San Diego.|$|E

Reznor explained this move by saying [...] "It's a stance we're taking <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> is appropriate with digital technology, and outdated copyright laws, and all the nonsense that's going on these days". Jim Guerinot, then manager of Nine Inch Nails, explained the unconventional release of the album as [...] " [...] a reaction to what doesn’t exist today. it’s more just like, 'Hey, in a vacuum I can do whatever I want to do.'" [...] The digital-release of the album reportedly required an extensive overhaul of the Nine Inch Nails website {{in order for the}} site to cope with the influx of traffic, online-payments, and customer service needs of releasing the album. These upgrades cost Reznor approximately $20,000 to implement. Despite these measures, upon the release of Ghosts the site crashed, and additional servers were necessary to handle the traffic.|$|E

Whale had Dan Totheroh re-write the dialogue and the draft was ready for submission to the PCA on July 15. When Breen reviewed the draft, his objections centered on the excessive alcohol use. [...] "We take this opportunity of pointing out to you, {{in regard to the}} matter of the treatment of drinking in this story, that, generally speaking, it is presented in a light, facetious, acceptable, amusing, and desirable mode of behavior.

[...] A revised script with the drinking toned down slightly was submitted on July 24, the same day Whale started shooting. Remember Last Night? was budgeted at $385,000. [...] Whale inserted lines that made fun of horror pictures, a genre with which he no longer wished to be associated. Carlotta is shown jumping on a diving board flapping a towel and exclaiming [...] "Look, I'm Dracula's Daughter!" [...] and in another scene she says [...] "I feel like the Bride of Frankenstein!"

500|$|The {{fourth season}} explores {{the concept of}} Life Model Decoys (LMDs), which were first {{referenced}} in The Avengers, and introduces the character Ghost Rider to the MCU. On why the series waited to begin exploring LMDs, Jed Whedon said that the series previously {{did not want to}} explore the concept before the release of Avengers: Age of Ultron, which sees the introductions of Ultron and Vision in a similar manner to LMDs. On introducing Ghost Rider, Whedon said that [...] "with Doctor Strange coming out this year, the Marvel [...] Universe is moving into new waters," [...] referring to the exploration of magic. [...] "We felt that this was obviously a great character that we'd love to have on our show <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> fits with that shift." [...] The season also continues storylines from the second season of Agent Carter, with the reveal that the Momentum Energy Labs group is a successor to the Isodyne Energy company, with both companies connected by the parent company Roxxon, a mainstay of the MCU. In August 2017, Emily VanCamp said that discussions had taken place for her to reprise her role of Sharon Carter for the series, but there were conflicts with her starring role on the series Revenge.|$|E
500|$|The season's {{exploring}} of supernatural {{and mystical}} concepts ties-in {{with the release}} of Doctor Strange, the first MCU film to explore magic. In addition to the Darkhold, this includes the introduction of Ghost Rider, with Whedon explaining in July 2016, that [...] "the Marvel [...] Universe is moving into new waters [...] We felt that [...] was obviously a great character that we’d love to have on our show <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> fits with that shift." [...] Whedon pointed out that the previous tie-ins were sometimes [...] "very direct", and other times [...] "more thematic. The tie this year will feel more of a reflection of , less an interweaving plot." [...] He added, [...] "Hopefully some of the questions that we’re asking will be answered by [...] then pose some new themes and ideas for us to explore." [...] "Deals with Our Devils", aired after the release of Doctor Strange, sees Aida create a portal to rescue Coulson and Fitz from another dimension. The visuals for these are intentionally reminiscent of those used in the film. Bell added that the Darkhold [...] "feels like it belongs in the library in Kathmandu", referring to the Kamar-Taj library seen in Doctor Strange.|$|E
500|$|In the episode, the {{character}} of Sheriff Graham was killed off, something that actor Jamie Dornan had known would happen since ABC picked up the pilot. It {{was the first major}} death of the series. In an interview with E! reporter Kristin Dos Santos, Dornan hinted that while his counterpart in Storybrooke has died, the huntsman could return at some point, as Dornan is still a regular on the series. As much of the episode involves Graham discovering his fairytale past, the writers designed the episode to mislead viewers by having them invest in {{the character}}. Kitsis and Horowitz commented that while the death made them [...] "sad," [...] the battle between Emma and Regina requires [...] "stakes and unfortunately, sometimes stakes are people's lives." [...] They also decided to kill the character relatively early in the series in order to show viewers that [...] "it's real. It's not in Henry's head." [...] Kitsis continued, [...] "It’s interesting, but part of the intent was to make you love him and we loved him very much. And the fact that the audience seems to have loved him means a lot to us, in <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> like we succeeded on that front. If you don’t feel sad, then it was a failure of the execution of the story." ...|$|E

500|$|The Wilson {{murder is}} a [...] "red ball", a police case {{involving}} an innocent victim, widely known suspects {{or a combination}} of the two. Red ball cases tend to draw attention from the media, the public and high-ranking police brass, and often result in additional detectives being added to the case. Fontana thought these elements of the red ball case would help produce a strong season premiere and tension among the veteran characters who resent the meddling of the new detectives. Julie Martin, one of the show's writers and supervising producers, said [...] "Blood Ties" [...] marked a deliberate change in the series, focusing on darker story lines that are [...] "a little messier and unresolved" [...] and more interpersonal relationships: [...] "The show's been on for six seasons, and it absolutely has to change. We can't keep doing the same show." [...] Media outlets noted that [...] "Blood Ties" [...] included more action-oriented elements such as car chases and a chase sequence involving helicopters at an airport. Fontana denied allegations of tampering from NBC executives and said any such changes would have come from him: [...] "I don't want us to have a style every week <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> we have to conform to. ... I want people not to know what to expect when they tune in every week. We're not formulaic." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Lysergic Acid Diethylamide" [...] {{concluded}} Anna Torv's [...] "Bellivia" [...] arc.

But there are things <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> are entertaining to us, and that allow us to explore themes that... we can’t otherwise access. And we think that if it’s entertaining, and it allows Anna a chance to stretch, and it gives Walter Bishop his old partner back for an episode so we can see what they were like together... those are also perfectly valid reasons for doing those episodes." [...] Wyman added, [...] "Yeah, it was important. I mean, you know, for people that say it was just a diversion, well, there was something really important involved in that Walter/William relationship. That was part of Walter’s self-actualization, that moment when William Bell says, 'Look, you have to be on your own. You have to walk the path that you believe in. You gain some humility where there once was hubris, and it’s really important that you depend on yourself.' Part of our plan has always been to get Walter to embrace his flaws and uniqueness as strengths, rather than thinking of them inhibiting his performance as a scientist and as a character. We were really anxious to get that across, and the best person to do that for us was William Bell, because Walter depended so much on William in so many different ways. So that story came around at a time where we really needed to have it." [...] Because the season finale did not resolve the plotline of Olivia and the man from the blimp, Pinkner commented in a post-finale interview that [...] "It’s definitely still in play. Without being too spoilery, there are things you think you have time to explore in any given season, but don’t. But yes, we are very interested in that moment and the implications of that." ...|$|E
