5|$|Goebel {{played a}} role in a famous Ohio State-Illinois game on November 13, 1943. The game was Paul Brown's last game as coach of the Buckeyes. With the score tied 26–26, Ohio State threw an {{incomplete}} forward pass into the end zone as the gun sounded. The game appeared to have ended in a tie, the teams left <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> stands emptied. However, Ohio State assistant coach Ernie Godfrey had noticed Goebel, who was the head linesman, drop a handkerchief to signal a penalty. On hearing the gun sound, Goebel had picked up the handkerchief and put it back in his back pocket. Godfrey confronted Goebel, who conceded that Illinois was offsides. Twenty minutes later, the teams came back onto <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Buckeyes kicked a 33-yard field goal to give Coach Brown a 29–26 win in his final game.|$|E

5|$|The Yankees won the World Series {{every year}} from 1936 to 1939 with a team that {{featured}} Gehrig and outfielder Joe DiMaggio, who recorded a record hitting streak during New York's 1941 championship season. New York set a major league record by winning five consecutive championships from 1949 to 1953, and appeared in the World Series nine times from 1955 to 1964. Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra, and Whitey Ford were among the players fielded by the Yankees during the era.

5|$|The {{calutron}} {{is a type}} of sector mass spectrometer, {{an instrument}} in which a sample is ionized and then accelerated by electric fields and deflected by magnetic fields. The ions ultimately collide with a plate and produce a measurable electric current. Since the ions of the different isotopes have the same electric charge but different masses, the heavier isotopes are deflected less by the magnetic field, causing the beam of particles to separate out into several beams by mass, striking the plate at different locations. The mass of the ions can be calculated according to the strength of <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> charge of the ions. During World War II, calutrons were developed to use this principle to obtain substantial quantities of high-purity uranium-235, by taking advantage of the small mass difference between uranium isotopes.|$|E

5|$|Hans-Martin Schenke, {{starting}} from {{an analysis of}} , in which Jesus encounters a Samaritan woman at the town Sychar, made an extensive analysis of the ancient sources, together with {{an examination of the}} site. The curiosity of the Gospel text for scholars lies in the mention of an otherwise unattested town in <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> failure of the text to refer to Joseph's Tomb, despite mentioning the field Jacob allotted to Joseph, and Jacob's well. In Schenke's view, {{from the beginning of the}} Hellenistic period down to the 1st century CE, when the author of John's gospel was presumably writing, the grave commemorating Joseph stood by Jacob's Well. This grave was shifted, together with the sacred tree and Jacob's field, sometime between that date and the earliest testimony we have in the Bordeaux itinerary in 333 CE., which locates it elsewhere, by Shechem/Tel Balāṭa.|$|E
5|$|Originally Mary {{believed}} that many nobles supported her marriage, but things soon turned sour between the newly elevated Bothwell (created Duke of Orkney) {{and his former}} peers, and the marriage proved to be deeply unpopular. Catholics considered the marriage unlawful, since they did not recognise Bothwell's divorce or {{the validity of the}} Protestant service. Both Protestants and Catholics were shocked that Mary should marry the man accused of murdering her husband. The marriage was tempestuous, and Mary became despondent. Twenty-six Scottish peers, known as the confederate lords, turned against Mary and Bothwell, raising an army against them. Mary and Bothwell confronted the lords at Carberry Hill on 15 June, but there was no battle as Mary's forces dwindled away through desertion during negotiations. Bothwell was given safe passage from <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lords took Mary to Edinburgh, where crowds of spectators denounced her as an adulteress and murderer. The following night, she was imprisoned in Loch Leven Castle, on an island in the middle of Loch Leven. Between 20 and 23 July, Mary miscarried twins. On 24 July, she was forced to abdicate in favour of her one-year-old son James. Moray was made regent, while Bothwell was driven into exile. He was imprisoned in Denmark, became insane and died in 1578.|$|E
5|$|Prost {{attacked}} Heidfeld but {{collided with}} the rear-end of his car at turn eight, send him spinning {{into the path of}} his teammate Rosenqvist, who was unable to swerve to avoid him, and ploughed into his vehicle. It came after Rosenqvist was sent airborne following contact with Evans's rear wheel. Despite his vehicle's back-end sustaining damage, Evans told his team over the radio that he could continue, but Rosenqvist was forced to retire. Prost however was delayed long enough to allow Evans move ahead of him for fifth place. Heidfeld was unhurt and was able to rejoin the race. On lap 44, D'Ambrosio lost third position to Bird who passed him around the outside at turn three. D'Ambrosio then ran out of electrical energy, allowing Gutiérrez into tenth. Di Grassi conserved his electrical energy usage and crossed the start/finish line after 45 laps to win the race. Vergne finished second, 1.966 seconds behind with Bird in third, Evans fourth and Prost fifth. López recovered from his lap 35 spin to secure sixth place, and Abt took seventh. Carroll, Piquet and Gutiérrez completed the top-ten points-scoring positions. Frijns, Heidfeld, Buemi and d'Ambrosio filled the next four positions with Sarrazin and Rosenqvist the last of the classified finishers. It was di Grassi's first victory of the season and the fifth of his career. Di Grassi's win ended e.Dams-Renault's streak of six consecutive victories, extending back to the 2016 Berlin ePrix. Four drivers led <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lead changed three times {{during the course of the}} ePrix.

5|$|The Manhattan Project {{intelligence}} staff {{believed that}} the Japanese atomic program was not far advanced because Japan had little access to uranium ore, the industrial effort required exceeded Japan's capacity, and, according to American physicists at the University of California, Berkeley, who knew the leading Japanese physicists personally, there were too few Japanese qualified {{to work in the}} area. Conversely, German scientists had reputations as leaders in <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fear of Germany developing nuclear weapons first {{was one of the reasons}} for the establishment of the Manhattan Project. The Chancellor of Germany, Adolf Hitler, frequently claimed that Germany was developing secret weapons, and it was feared that these might include nuclear weapons. Reports of German nuclear activity were taken very seriously. At the instigation of the Manhattan Project, Norwegian saboteurs and Allied bombers attacked heavy-water infrastructure in German-occupied Norway in late 1942 and early 1943.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} of Final Fantasy VII {{is mostly}} comparable to earlier Final Fantasy titles and Japanese role-playing games. The game features three modes of play: the world map, <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> battle screen. At its grandest scale, players explore {{the entire world}} of Final Fantasy VII on a 3D world map. The world map is littered with representations of areas for the player to enter, including towns, environments, and ruins. Natural barrierssuch as mountains, deserts, and bodies of waterblock access by foot to some areas; as the game progresses, the player receives vehicles that help traverse these obstacles. Chocobos {{can be found in}} certain spots on the map, and if caught, can be ridden to areas inaccessible by foot or vehicle. In field mode, the player navigates fully scaled versions of the areas represented on the world map. For {{the first time in the}} Final Fantasy series, this mode is represented in three-dimensional space. The player can explore the environment, talk with characters, advance the story, and initiate event games in this mode. Event games are short minigames that use special control functions and are often tied into the story. While in field mode, the player may also find shops and inns. Shops provide an opportunity to buy and sell items that can aid Cloud and his party, such as weapons, armor, and accessories. If the characters rest at an inn, their hit points and mana points will be completely restored, along with any abnormalities contracted during battles.|$|E
5|$|Though John Cole and the Carrs {{were among}} the first major music {{publishers}} in Baltimore, the city was home to a vibrant publishing tradition in the 19th century, aided by the presence of A.

Other prominent music publishers in Baltimore in this era included George Willig, Arthur Clifton, Frederick Benteen, James Boswell, Miller and Beecham, W. C. Peters, Samuel Carusi and G. Fred Kranz.
