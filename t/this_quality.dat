25|$|TRNA export is also {{dependent}} on the various modifications it undergoes, thus preventing export of improperly functioning tRNA. <b>This</b> <b>quality</b> control mechanism is important due to tRNA's central role in translation, where it is involved in adding amino acids to a growing peptide chain. The tRNA exporter in vertebrates is called exportin-t. Exportin-t binds directly to its tRNA cargo in the nucleus, a process promoted {{by the presence of}} RanGTP. Mutations that affect tRNA's structure inhibit its ability to bind to exportin-t, and consequentially, to be exported, providing the cell with another quality control step. As described above, once the complex has crossed the envelope it dissociates and releases the tRNA cargo into the cytosol.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there are}} also tubes that operate in cold cathode mode, whereby {{electrons}} are liberated into the tube only by the large potential difference (voltage) between the electrodes. This {{does not mean the}} electrodes are cold (indeed, they can be very hot), but it does mean they are operating below their thermionic emission temperature. Because cold cathode lamps have no thermionic emission coating to wear out, they can have much longer lives than hot cathode tubes. <b>This</b> <b>quality</b> makes them desirable for maintenance-free long-life applications (such as backlights in liquid crystal displays). Sputtering of the electrode may still occur, but electrodes can be shaped (e.g. into an internal cylinder) to capture most of the sputtered material so it is not lost from the electrode.|$|E

25|$|The {{addition}} of regional offices {{and resulted in}} the microwave radio relay being upgraded in the 1970s. The Telecommunications Administration insisted on continuing using analog transmission, while NRK instead wanted to implement a digital transmission. NRK got its way, and a transistor-based system with a capacity corresponding to 960 telephone lines was installed. The resulting system had two radio channels, one for transmitting radio from Oslo to the regional offices and one for transmission between the regional offices. The FM transmitters were fed their programs from the regional offices. The system had a two-way television channel, which could feed the television programs to the transmitters and allow for transfer of program content from the regional offices to Oslo. The sound transfer system had four 2-megabit channels; the one was used for 30 telephone lines {{and the other was}} used for 5 program channels. These had a sampling rate of 32kHz and a 14-bit bit rate, which was reduced to 11 through compression. No other available systems could produce <b>this</b> <b>quality</b> of audio.|$|E
