Erhard {{writes in the}} foreword that Rhinehart's book [...] "brilliantly ... communicates clearly to the reader both {{a sense of being}} in the training room and the spirit of what takes place there." [...] Erhard's foreword notes: [...] "although this book dramatizes the highlights of the training and attempts <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> vicarious experience of being at a training, this is a book, and the est experience cannot result from reading any book".|$|E
500|$|Finally, a new {{building}} was built between the original skyscraper and the annex, which was also designed by Philip Johnson. This became the Chrysler Trylons, a commercial pavilion three stories high with a retail area of [...] Its design, consisting of three triangular glass pyramids that intersect each other, {{was inspired by the}} triangular windows of the Chrysler Building's crown. The building's design was so complex that a replica was built at Rimouski, Quebec. Johnson designed Chrysler Trylons as [...] "a monument for 42nd Street [...] <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> top of the Chrysler Building at street level." ...|$|E

500|$|Gerard George Lowe {{came from}} Johannesburg, South Africa. He was a {{chemical}} engineer with South African Breweries. He went to Singapore {{to shop for}} electrical and electronic goods. Before he left Johannesburg on 7 March 1995, he told his wife Vanessa, a local airlines employee, his exact schedule, saying: [...] "I will call you the moment I check into the hotel <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> contact number. If you do not hear from me on 10 March, it would mean that I would have {{a seat on the}} plane to return to South Africa and would arrive home on 11 March. But if I do call you on 10 March, that would mean that I have not managed to get a seat and would return on 12 March." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the short}} film, the duo play [...] "Mac and Jack", {{a pair of}} conmen who sell a [...] "miracle potion". The {{salesman}} (McCartney) offers Jackson the potion, and claims that it is [...] "guaranteed <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> strength of a raging bull". Jackson drinks the potion and challenges a large man to arm-wrestle. Unbeknownst to a watching crowd, the man—along with Linda—is also in on the scam. After Jackson wins the rigged contest, the crowd of people surge forward and buy the potion. Mac and Jack then donate {{all of the money}} earned from the scam to an orphanage. After this scene, McCartney and Jackson star as vaudeville performers who sing and dance at a bar. On stage, the duo appear in clown makeup at one point and quickly go through a number of costume changes. Jackson flirts with a young woman portrayed by his real-life sister La Toya. When law-enforcement officers appear {{at the back of the}} venue, Mac quickly starts a small fire onstage and Linda hollers [...] "FIRE!", emptying the venue and allowing the group to escape via backstage (yet somehow finding time to change into tuxedoes first). The video ends with Paul, Linda, and Michael as they drive off into the sunset. La Toya, who was handed a bunch of flowers by McCartney, is left at the roadside.|$|E
500|$|The Oklahoman gave Spit a {{positive}} review: [...] "Throw {{in the fact}} that they range in age from 15 to 18, and Kittie seems like the perfect weapon to smite Mandy Moore, Britney Spears, Jessica Simpson and Christina Aguilera, forever ridding the music industry of teen-pop". The CMJ New Music Report gave Spit {{a positive}} review: [...] "the teenage babes in Ontario, Canada's Kittie will scratch and claw their way into the dark recesses of your hearts thanks to their debut, the smashing 'n' stomping Spit". The Washington Post criticized the album: [...] "All four members of this Canadian metal-punk band are women, which is still a novel (though certainly not unique) lineup for a headbanging ensemble. Too bad that's virtually the quartet's only distinguishing feature". The review concluded, [...] "After four or five of these pounding rockers, Kittie becomes a bore." [...] Exclaim! also criticized the album: [...] "Guidance Counsellor's advice: pull the plug and stay in school". NME gave the album a four-out-of-ten rating: [...] "Like kindred spirits System of a Down, Kittie want <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> impression that they're just too tasty to fuk wit, too unhinged to view as normal folk, too pierced for the mainstream." [...] Spit was number 24 on Metal Descent's [...] "25 Best Alternative Metal Albums" [...] list, and [...] "Brackish" [...] was on Fuse's [...] "19 Best Nu-Metal Hits of All Time" [...] list.|$|E

Glass introduced it as a spinoff of his popular radio program, This American Life, and aired episode one on his show. He explained, [...] "We want <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> same experience you get from a great HBO or Netflix series, where you get {{caught up with the}} characters and the thing unfolds week after week, but with a true story, and no pictures.

According to Walt Disney, [...] "All of us have cause {{to be proud of}} our country's history, shaped by the {{pioneering}} spirit of our forefathers. Our adventures are designed <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> feeling of having lived, even for a short while, during our country's pioneer days."

2500|$|Duffy wrote a 46 line poem Rings for the 2011 {{wedding of}} Prince William and Catherine Middleton. The poem celebrates the rings {{found in nature}} and does not {{specifically}} mention the couple's names. It begins for both to say and continues [...] "I might have raised your hand to the sky / <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> ring surrounding the moon / or looked to twin the rings of your eyes / with mine / or added a ring to the rings of a tree / by forming a handheld circle with you, thee, / ...". She wrote the verse with Stephen Raw, a textual artist, and a signed print of the work {{was sent to the}} couple as a wedding gift. Duffy also wrote the poem The Throne, which she composed for the 60th anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation.|$|E

2500|$|... "I {{really want}} <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> lowdown on the SW re-formation but there's {{honestly}} {{not a lot}} to say. Legal issues prevented me from doing my own band on my own terms {{over the past couple}} of years but thankfully those problems are all resolved now. The kind of stuff happens sometimes. I won't deny that those problems - which were really just the culmination of many years of a lot of other b.s. - left a foul taste in my mouth about SW. But now that all the headaches are behind me I'm feeling great about it. I'm finally running my own band again and I'm really happy and excited to be back at it. I've got a killer line-up [...] myself, Danny Vapid, Simon Lamb (the Ritalins), Justin Perkins (Yesterday's Kids) and Adam Cargin (Blueheels) (he's also the new Riverdales drummer) and we've got a great set list." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Deer Hunter was Cimino's {{first film}} to use Dolby noise-reduction system. [...] "What Dolby does," [...] replied Cimino, [...] "is <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> {{ability to create}} a density of detail of sound—a {{richness}} so you can demolish the wall separating the viewer from the film. You can come close to demolishing the screen." [...] It took five months to mix the soundtrack. One short battle sequence—200 feet of film in the final cut—took five days to dub. Another sequence recreated the 1975 American evacuation of Saigon; Cimino brought the film's composer, Stanley Myers, out to the location {{to listen to the}} auto, tank, and jeep horns as the sequence was being photographed. The result, according to Cimino: Myers composed the music for that scene in the same key as the horn sounds, so the music and the sound effects would blend with the images to create one jarring, desolate experience.|$|E
