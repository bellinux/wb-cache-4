40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate the performance of glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars as reinforcement for concrete decks. Today’s rapid bridge deck deterioration is calling for a replacement for steel reinforcement. The advantages of GFRP such as its high tensile strength, light weight, and resistance to corrosion make it an attractive alternative to steel. The deck of one end-span of the Gills Creek Bridge was constructed with GFRP bars as the <b>top</b> <b>mat</b> and epoxy-coated steel bars as the bottom mat. Live load tests were performed in 2003, shortly after completion of construction, and again in 2004. In addition, tests were performed {{on the deck of the}} opposite end-span, which had all epoxy-coated steel reinforcing. The results of these tests were used to evaluate the girder distribution factors and impact factors of a GFRP reinforced bridge deck. In addition, a comparison of the results from the two test periods gives an indication of any changes in strains in the GFRP bars and if the deck is behaving differently than when first installed. The results were compared to the design standards specified by the American Concrete Institute in the Guide for the Design and Construction of Concrete Reinforced with FRP Bar to determine if the stresses in the deck were within the specified limits. The performances of the two end-spans were compared to determine if th...|$|E

40|$|Concrete bridge decks {{subjected}} to corrosive environment, {{due to the}} application of de-icing chemical, could deteriorate at a rapid rate. In an effort to minimize corrosion of the reinforcement and the corresponding delaminations and spalls, the Iowa Department of Transportation (IADOT) started using epoxy-coated rebars (ECR) in the <b>top</b> <b>mat</b> of reinforcing around 1976 and in both mats about 10 years later. The ultimate objective {{of this research was}} to determine the impact of deck cracking on durability and estimate the remaining functional service life of a bridge deck. The overall objectives of this work were obtained by conducting a literature review, visually inspecting several bridge decks, collecting and sampling test cores from cracked and uncracked areas of bridge decks, determining the extent to which epoxy coated rebars deteriorate at the site of cracks, and evaluating the impact of cracking on service life. Overall, 81 bridges constructed with ECR were sampled. Fick 2 ̆ 7 s Second Law was applied in this study to estimate the time required to reach the corrosive threshold of chloride concentration at the rebar level i. e., the time length of the corrosion initiation stage. No signs of corrosion were observed on the rebars collected from uncracked locations. Rebars that had surface corrosion undercutting the epoxy coating were those collected from cores that were taken from cracked locations. In general, no delaminations or spalls were found on the decks where these bars were cored. The surface chloride concentration at 1 / 22 ̆ 2 below the deck surface and the diffusion constant were found to be 14. 0 lb/yd 3 and 0. 05 in 2 /yr respectively. The predicted service life for Iowa bridge decks constructed with ECR was calculated to be approximately between 53 and 141 years. This illustrates that ECR can significantly extend the service life when compared to bridges constructed with black rebars...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{the results}} of an {{extensive}} field and laboratory investigation conducted to evaluate the corrosion performance of epoxy-coated reinforcement are reported. One hundred and twenty three concrete bridge decks containing epoxy-coated reinforcement, uncoated reinforcement, and various other corrosion protection systems were included in a field investigation. An initial visual inspection of these bridge decks showed that 44 % had signs of distress from corrosion of the reinforcement. Six decks, representing 5 % of the total sample, were selected for a second more detailed survey. Three of the six decks had epoxy-coated reinforcement. This number represents 11 % of the total sample of bridge decks with epoxy-coated reinforcement. Corrosion of the epoxy-coated reinforcement was discovered in areas of cracking and shallow cover on two of these three bridge decks. New construction bridge sites were also visited to perform holiday testing on epoxy-coated reinforcement upon arrival to the site, after placement, and after casting. The results from the holiday testing showed that an average of 31 holidays per meter (9 holidays per foot) were created during the concrete casting operation. Increasing the coating thickness by 101. 6 mm (4 mils) and lowering the hose used when pumping concrete {{to the level of the}} <b>top</b> <b>mat</b> of reinforcement reduced the holidays created to 11. 5 holidays per meter (3. 5 holidays per foot) after casting. The results of 16 specimens subjected to cycles of exposure in the laboratory evaluation indicated that if the mat to mat resistance was greater than 5000 ohms, then over the 77 -week period no corrosion activity was observed. No corrosion activity occurred even though the chloride levels at the reinforcement location were well above 0. 79 kg/m 3 (1. 3 lb/yd 3), the threshold level for initiation of corrosion. A possible way to achieve a high mat to mat resistance would be by limiting the damage to the epoxy coatings...|$|E
40|$|Landscape scale {{environmental}} gradients present variable spatial {{patterns and}} ecological processes caused by climate, topography and soil characteristics and, as such, offer candidate sites to study environmental change. Data are presented on the spatial pattern of dominant species, biomass, and carbon pools and the temporal pattern of fluxes across a transitional zone shifting from Great Basin Desert scrub, up through pinyon-juniper woodlands and into ponderosa pine forest and the ecotones between each vegetation type. The mean annual temperature (MAT) difference across the gradient is approximately 3 degrees C from bottom to <b>top</b> (<b>MAT</b> 8. 5 - 5. 5) and annual precipitation averages from 320 to 530 mm/yr, respectively. The stems {{of the dominant}} woody vegetation approach a random spatial pattern across the entire gradient, while the canopy cover shows a clustered pattern. The size of the clusters increases with elevation according to available soil moisture which in turn affects available nutrient resources. The total density of woody species declines with increasing soil moisture along the gl-adient, but total biomass increases. Belowground carbon and nutrient pools change from a heterogenous to a homogenous distribution {{on either side of}} the woodlands. Although temperature controls the: seasonal patterns of carbon efflux from the soils, soil moisture appears to be the primary driving variable, but response differs underneath the different dominant species, Similarly, decomposition of dominant litter occurs faster-at the cooler and more moist sites, but differs within sites due to litter quality of the different species. The spatial pattern of these communities provides information on the direction of future changes, The ecological processes that we documented are not statistically different in the ecotones as compared to the: adjoining communities, but are different at sites above the woodland than those below the woodland. We speculate that an increase in MAT will have a major impact on C pools and C sequestering and release processes in these semiarid landscapes. However, the impact will be primarily related to moisture availability rather than direct effects of an increase in temperature. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|E

40|$|The {{service life}} of a {{reinforced}} concrete (RC) bridge deck in cold climates is often limited by chloride-induced corrosion of the reinforcement due to exposure to de-icing salts routinely applied in the winter. Although {{there has been an}} extensive research effort on chloride ingress into concrete in the last three decades, research conducted on structural concrete members carrying in-service loads is limited. The objectives of this study were to investigate the effect of sustained load on chloride ingress into concrete and to examine the reliability of spraying a AgNO 3 solution onto concrete as a quick method to determine chloride penetration. To achieve these objectives, an experimental program was carried out, in which a small-scale RC slab was subjected to wet and dry cycles with a saturated chloride solution while sustaining static service loads. The concrete slab was cast with three strips of different water-to-cement ratios to represent different field conditions. Supports were located to create both positive and negative moment regions in the <b>top</b> <b>mat</b> reinforcement of the slab. Concrete cores were taken at several sections along the RC deck, which were stressed to different levels, and at three time intervals, each of them after a wet/dry cycle of 90 days. Concrete cores were sprayed with a AgNO 3 solution to determine an average chloride penetration front, and chloride profiles along the concrete cover for each core were measured by potentiometric titration. Chloride diffusion coefficients were obtained from the data obtained from spraying AgNO 3 and titration, the latter by curve-fitting to Fick's 2 nd law. The comparison between both sets of data reveals that the differences diminish as the time of exposure increases. The chloride diffusivity along the span of the slab, relative to that of an unstressed section, was related to the applied bending moment. The experimental results also indicate that there is a dependence of chloride ingress properties on the type and level of sustained load. An analysis of the data to study the effect of exposure time and water-to-cement ratio using colourimetric and potentiometric titration methods was also carried out...|$|E

40|$|In {{an effort}} to {{minimize}} corrosion of the reinforcement in bridge decks, the Iowa Department of Transportation started using epoxy-coated rebars as <b>top</b> reinforcing <b>mat</b> around 1976. However, the presence of cracks in bridge decks has raised some concerns among bridge and maintenance engineers. The impact of deck cracking on the service life of a bridge deck was investigated herein. This was accomplished by collecting core samples from 80 bridges, calculating the chloride content in these cores, developing a relationship for chloride infiltration through the deck, examining the condition of several rebar samples, and developing a rebar rating-age relationship, and estimating a bridge deck service life. No signs of corrosion were observed on the rebars collected from uncracked locations. In addition, no delaminations or spalls {{were found on the}} decks where bars at cracked location exhibit some signs of corrosion. Considering a corrosion threshold for epoxy-coated rebars that range from 3. 6 lb/ yd 3 to 7. 2 lb/yd 3, the predicted service life for Iowa Bridge decks was over 50 years.

40|$|This paper {{details the}} {{principles}} of infrared thermography from the underlying theoretical considerations to the physical constraints involved with performing the test. Infrared (IR) thermography testing may be conducted {{at any time of}} the day or night as long as heat transfer is taking place through the medium being examined. During the day, subsurface anomalies cause localized increases in heat absorption, so the surface above these areas registers warmer than the surrounding areas. At night, the anomalies cause the surface above them to dissipate heat faster then the surrounding solid areas, so they register cooler to the IR thermography. An IR thermographic study of a freeway interchange in Milwaukee, WI. was conducted in late 1991. The study was designed to find delaminations and other pre-spalling subsurface anomalies that are not detectable by visual surface inspection. A pre-spalling condition occurs when the salt used to deice the road permeates the concrete and creates a corrosive environment around the <b>top</b> rebar <b>mat.</b> The resulting sub-surface cracking can be detected using IR thermography...|$|R

Most of the traditional methods for drug targets optimization focused on identifying the particular families of “druggable targets”, but ignored their topological properties based on the biological pathways. In this study, we characterized the topological properties of human anticancer drug targets (ADTs) {{in the context of}} biological pathways. We found that the ADTs tended to present the following seven topological properties: influence the number of the pathways related to cancer, be localized at the start or end of the pathways, interact with cancer related genes, exhibit higher connectivity, vulnerability, betweenness, and closeness than other genes. We first ranked ADTs based on their topological property values respectively, then fused them into one global-rank using the joint cumulative distribution of an N-dimensional order statistic to optimize human ADTs. We applied the optimization method to 13 anticancer drugs, respectively. Results demonstrated that over 70 % of known ADTs were ranked in the top 20 %.

40|$|Improving cow comfort {{has been}} shown to provide large {{increases}} in milk yield, cow health and reduced cull rates of underproducing cows. Over the years animal size has increased and confinement systems have evolved so that many producers have to decide if remodeling their freestalls can improve cow comfort and reduce undue cull rates thus increasing their bottom line. Cushion: Improving the cushion in cows laying area can improve the comfort of the animal. Producers have several alternatives to explore such as, deep bedded sand, sand over a matt or concrete, deep bedded organic bedding, mats or mattresses with more cushion, and recycled manure solids. Each deep bedded sand stall may use about seven to nine tons of sand a year. This option is very cow friendly as hock lesions almost disappear. Sand is groomed daily and sand in the cow alleys improves traction and the improved footing reduces slipping when cows show estrus. The drawback is the manure handling becomes more difficult and expensive. If you have good stall dimensions. a bedding keeper or sand over a mattress could improve cushion with less sand cost and little remodeling. Another option some pick is to purchase a mat with more cushion under the harder rubber <b>top.</b> These <b>mats</b> require little remodeling but producers should remember that raising the platform a couple of inches might decrease comfort unless you raise the neck rail. Using recycled sand or manure solids increases cow comfort but require a major investment in structure and management time and resources. Both sand and manure solids will need to sit and drain moisture or heat and kill bacteria. Given an increase of pathogens to the udder with these systems producers must decide if they will invest their time and ability to meet the increased demands.

Upon darkness trichomes moved downward by gliding motility into the substrate {{to a depth of}} 0. 5 to 1. 0 mm, where the population remained until dawn. At dawn the population rapidly returned to the <b>top</b> of the <b>mats.</b> Field studies with microelectrodes showed that the dense population of O. terebriformis moved each night across an oxygen-sulfide interface, entering a microenvironment which was anaerobic and reducing, a dramatic contrast to the daytime environment at the mat surface where oxygenic photosynthesis resulted in supersaturated O 2. Laboratory experiments on motility with the use of sulfide gradients produced in agar revealed a negative response to sulfide at concentrations similar to those found in the natural mats. The motility response may help explain the presence of O. terebriformis below the mat surface at night. The movement back to the surface at dawn appears to be due to a combination of phototaxis, photokinesis, and the onset of oxygenic photosynthesis which consumes sulfide...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{reports a}} {{research}} project which evaluates the use of Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) and Carbon FRP (CFRP) materials for bridge construction. The bridge selected for this project is a four-span continuous concrete slab having GFRP bars for <b>top</b> and bottom <b>mats</b> and CFRP reinforcement for internal post-tensioning of the bridge deck. This bridge is located in Rolla, Missouri (Southview Drive on Carter Creek). One lane of the bridge was constructed using a conventional four-cell steel reinforced concrete box culvert. The abutments for the missing lane were constructed with conventional reinforced concrete. One lane and sidewalk needed to be added. This additional lane will be constructed using FRP bars as internal reinforcement. The combination of prestressed and non-prestressed FRP reinforcement will result in an economical solution for a deck system with low deflection and high shear strength at a minimum deck thickness. This paper presents the pre-construction investigation conducted on two specimens representing a deck strip 46 cm (18 in) wide, 25 cm (10 in) height and 7 m (23 ft) long. The specimens were tested as continuous slabs over three supports allowing the validation of the design calculations in terms of flexure and shear capacity. 1...|$|R
