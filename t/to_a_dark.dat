5|$|After {{five to six}} instars, the nymphs will molt into adults. The male's forceps {{will become}} curved, while the females' forceps remain straight. They will also develop their natural color, which can be {{anything}} from a light brown (as in the Tawny earwig) <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> black (as in the Ringlegged earwig). In species of winged earwigs, the wings will start to develop at this time. The forewings of an earwig are sclerotized to serve as protection for the membranous hindwings.|$|E
5|$|Male Scyllarus latus carry spermatophores at {{the base}} of the last two pairs of pereiopods in April. Fertilisation has not been {{observed}} in this species, but most reptant decapods mate with the ventral surfaces together. Between July and August, females carry around 100,000 eggs on their enlarged, feathery pleopods. The eggs develop from being a bright orange colour <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> brown before being shed into the water after around 16 days of development. There is normally only one generation per year.|$|E
5|$|The area {{above the}} eyes, {{including}} the forehead, crown and nape, {{is a deep}} blue-black, through {{the top edge of}} the mantle. The mantle proper is a medium to dark gray-blue as are the tertials and upperwing-coverts, turning <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> gray at the median, greater and primary coverts and the alula. The secondaries and inner primaries are fringed in gray-blue. The central rectrices are gray-blue, and the outer rectrices are a blackish-gray, paling towards the tips.|$|E

5|$|Herdwick lambs {{are born}} black, {{and after a}} year they lighten <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> brown colour (the sheep are called hoggs or hoggets at this stage). After the first shearing, their fleece lightens further to grey. Rams are horned, and ewes polled. For shows and auctions, Herdwicks {{traditionally}} have their wool ruddied up (the local term for raddled) with dye. Rams are also ruddied when put out with the ewes to show which have been mated, and the dye is also one method (called a smit) of marking sheep for ownership. Before chemical dyes became available, this dye was made from either iron ore or graphite mixed with grease. For many years the legal method of identifying a particular shepherd's sheep were notches cut out of a sheep's ear, called lug marks—now replaced by ear tags.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{ships were}} {{generally}} not camouflaged. In special tactical situations, camouflage could be improvised, {{as when the}} battleships Yamato and Musashi had their decks blackened {{with a mixture of}} soot to help them hide while passing through the San Bernardino Strait at night in the October 1944 Battle of Leyte Gulf. Japanese ships largely retained their pre-war dark gray paint scheme, although some major units like aircraft carriers changed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> sea green. Some aircraft carriers had their flight decks painted in a dazzle camouflage, but this seems to have been ineffective. By 1945, with the remnants of the Japanese Navy seeking to hide from American air power, its battleships were painted in a variety of camouflage measures. Haruna for example wore olive green overall, its turrets painted light green with gray stripes, whereas Ises olive dress was broken up with patches of gray, red-brown, yellow, and dark green.|$|E
5|$|Seasons {{begins as}} the Triforce {{calls out to}} Link from within Hyrule Castle. Link {{approaches}} it, and is transported <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> forest where he encounters a traveling group led by a dancer named Din. After Din welcomes Link to Holodrum, the sky becomes covered in black clouds. A voice from the clouds calls Din the Oracle of Seasons and refers to himself as Onox, General of Darkness. A funnel cloud drops from the sky, taking Din into its dark heights. As the tornado dissipates, the seasons of Holodrum fall into disarray and change rapidly.|$|E

5|$|The alloy {{of copper}} and nickel, called cupronickel, {{is used in}} low-denomination coins, often for the outer cladding. The US 5-cent coin (currently called a nickel) {{consists}} of 75% copper and 25% nickel in homogeneous composition. The alloy of 90% copper and 10% nickel, remarkable for its resistance to corrosion, is used for various objects exposed to seawater, though it is vulnerable to the sulfides sometimes found in polluted harbors and estuaries. Alloys of copper with aluminium (about 7%) have a golden color and are used in decorations. Shakudō is a Japanese decorative alloy of copper containing a low percentage of gold, typically 4–10%, that can be patinated <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> blue or black color.|$|E
5|$|Thirty Flights of Loving {{begins with}} the player walking through a small {{corridor}} where individual gameplay elements such as movement and key allocations are explained. After walking through a bar and several more corridors, Anita and Borges are introduced. All three characters then exit on a plane. A smash cut skips the narrative forward to a scene with Anita and Borges lying shot {{in a room full}} of crates. The player character lifts Borges and takes him outside to what looks to be an airport. The player is then taken <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> room with Anita sitting on a chair, peeling and eating oranges. After walking through another corridor, Anita, Borges, and the player join a wedding.|$|E
5|$|Variety borealis has a {{slightly}} darker color scheme than the main species. The coloration in general is darker; the cap can vary from a bright apple red <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> brick red with maturity, to almost purple in some instances. The pore surface has a varying coloration of orange red to red and becoming a dull brown red with age. The bruising coloration is a blue green and the spore print is olive brown. The distribution of variety borealis is relatively small, ranging from Michigan to the upper New England states. The similar distribution and coloration to Boletus carminiporus has caused the two to be confused. New molecular evidence shows that borealis is not closely related to Baorangia bicolor var. bicolor.|$|E

50|$|The cap is 2 - 7 cm in diameter, {{initially}} convex while flattening with age; {{it typically}} {{has a low}} umbo - a raised, conical mound {{in the center of}} the cap. The surface color can range from <b>a</b> lighter cream <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>darker</b> tan, with brownish scales thinning out towards the margin of the cap. The gills are free from the stalk and packed closely together, showing <b>a</b> pink <b>to</b> salmon color in youth and aging <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>darker</b> brown.|$|R
5|$|After {{speeches in}} favor of the other front-runners, Garfield rose to place Sherman's name in nomination; his nominating speech was well-received, but the delegates mustered little {{excitement}} for the idea of Sherman as the next president. The first ballot showed Grant leading with 304 votes and Blaine in second with 284; Sherman's 93 placed him in a distant third. Subsequent ballots quickly demonstrated a deadlock between the Grant and Blaine forces, with neither having the 379 votes needed for nomination. Jeremiah McLain Rusk, a member of the Wisconsin delegation, and Benjamin Harrison, an Indiana delegate, sought to break the deadlock by shifting a few of the anti-Grant votes <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> horse candidate—Garfield. Garfield gained 50 votes on the 35th ballot, and the stampede began. Garfield protested to the other members of his Ohio delegation that he had not sought the nomination and had never intended to betray Sherman, but they overruled his objections and cast their ballots for him. In the next round of voting, nearly all of the Sherman and Blaine delegates shifted their support to Garfield, giving him 399 votes and the Republican nomination. Most of the Grant forces backed the former president to the end, creating a disgruntled Stalwart minority in the party. To obtain that faction's support for the ticket, former New York customs collector Chester A. Arthur, a member of Conkling's political machine, was chosen as the vice-presidential nominee.|$|E
5|$|From 1879, more {{locomotives}} were needed, and {{the design}} was updated and 24 were delivered between 1879 and 1885. Originally they were painted bright olive green lined in black and yellow, chimneys copper capped with the locomotive number in brass figures at the front and domes of polished brass. In 1885, the colour changed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> red known as Midcared, and this was to remain the standard colour, taken up as the colour for the Metropolitan line by London Transport in 1933. When in 1925 the Met classified its locomotives by letters of the alphabet, these were assigned A Class and B Class. When the M was being built, it was considered that they would struggle on the gradients and five Worcester Engine 0-6-0 tank locomotives were delivered in 1868. It was soon found that A and B Classes could manage trains without difficulty and the 0-6-0Ts were sold to the Taff Vale Railway in 1873 and 1875.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} episode, Aldaris, Zeratul, {{and the newly}} {{promoted}} Artanis work to evacuate the surviving Protoss from their devastated homeworld through a warp gate <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> templar colony on Shakuras, where they meet the matriarch of the dark templar, Raszagal. Although the Zerg are able to follow the Protoss to Shakuras, Raszagal informs the survivors of a Xel'Naga temple {{on the surface of}} the planet with the power to scour the Zerg from the surface if activated. With Zeratul and Artanis reluctantly partnering with Sarah Kerrigan, who informs them of a new Overmind growing on Char, the player joins them in an operation to recover two key crystals (Khalis and Uraj) necessary to operate the temple. Upon their return, it is revealed that Aldaris has begun an uprising against the dark templar over their alliance with Kerrigan. The uprising is crushed, and Aldaris is killed by Kerrigan, who reveals that her motives are to ensure the destruction of the Zerg cerebrates on Shakuras so she can gain control of the Zerg herself before departing the planet. Despite knowing that activating the temple will accomplish Kerrigan's objectives, Zeratul and Artanis proceed with little other choice, wiping the Zerg off Shakuras' surface.|$|E

5|$|The jackal's fur is coarse and {{relatively}} short, with the base color golden, varying seasonally from a pale creamy yellow <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> tawny. The fur {{on the back}} is composed of a mixture of black, brown, and white hairs, sometimes giving {{the appearance of the}} dark saddle like that seen on the black-backed jackal. The underparts are a light pale ginger to cream color. Individual specimens can be distinguished by their unique light markings on the throat and chest. The coats of jackals from high elevations tend to be more buff-colored than those of their lowland counterparts while those of jackals in rocky, mountainous areas may exhibit a grayer shade. The bushy tail has a tan to black tip. Melanism can cause a dark-colored coat in some golden jackals, a coloring once fairly common in Bengal. Unlike melanistic wolves and coyotes that received their dark pigmentation from interbreeding with domestic dogs, melanism in golden jackals probably stems from an independent mutation that could be an adaptive trait. What is possibly an albino specimen was photographed in southeastern Iran during 2012.|$|E
5|$|The {{predominant}} metallic colour is green, but {{can vary}} by region, ranging from metallic green to purple. In the Flinders Ranges of South Australia and Alice Springs, the colour of the ants shifts from the typical green <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> purple colour. In areas with more rainfall {{such as the}} New South Wales tablelands and Victorian savannahs, green-head ants are mostly green with purplish tints seen {{on the sides of}} the mesosoma. In the northern regions of New South Wales and Queensland, the alitrunk is reddish-violet, which shades into golden around the lower portions of the pleura. The green colour is either limited or completely absent in this case. Most populations have a bright green gaster, except for those living in the central desert. In some areas examined near Brisbane, two different colour forms were discovered within a single colony. One possibility is that the two colour forms may represent two sibling species, but this cannot be confirmed because of lack of evidence. In far north Queensland, populations appear to be dull green and distinct to those living in the south, but it is unknown how the ants in the far north and south hook up at the western and southern regions of the Atherton Tableland. With this said, it is unknown if the far north populations are actually a different species. In addition to colour variation, there are morphological differences among populations. For example, the size and shape of the head and petiole, the length of the appendages, and other sculptural details of the body may all vary.|$|E
25|$|Port-wine stains occur {{most often}} on the face but can appear {{anywhere}} on the body, particularly on the neck and upper trunk. Early stains are usually flat and pink in appearance. As the child matures, the color may deepen <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> red or purplish color. In adulthood, thickening of the lesion or the development of small lumps may occur.|$|E
50|$|Colchicum atropurpureum {{is a small}} flowered Colchicum {{which has}} blooms that open pink and then turn <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>darker</b> shade of red-purple. This plant is often {{confused}} with Colchicum autumnale.|$|R
