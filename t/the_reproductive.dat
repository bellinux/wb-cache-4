5|$|Among <b>the</b> <b>reproductive</b> caste, neotenic queens may {{compete with}} each other to become the {{dominant}} queen when there are no primary reproductives. This struggle among the queens leads to the elimination of all but a single queen, which, with the king, takes over the colony.|$|E
5|$|Neutering or spaying, which {{involves}} removing some of <b>the</b> <b>reproductive</b> organs, is often carried {{out as a}} method of birth control in household pets. Many animal shelters require these procedures as part of adoption agreements. In large animals the surgery is known as castration.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Reproductive</b> Freedom Project is an {{institution}} founded in 1974 (within {{the larger context}} of ACLU) that is committed to defend individuals who feel abused by the government, especially with cases pertaining to a lack of access to abortions, birth control, or sexual education.|$|E

50|$|Finally, {{there are}} <b>the</b> <b>reproductives.</b> They include <b>the</b> {{king and the}} queen. The queen can {{sometimes}} grow up to six centimeters long while the lower classes are generally less than one centimeter.|$|R
5|$|The species Gryllus bimaculatus {{exhibits}} <b>the</b> <b>reproductive</b> {{pattern of}} polyandry. This sexual selective pattern increases the overall fitness {{of the species}} and promotes genetic variation. The females select and mate with multiple viable sperm donors and exhibit a distinct preference for novel mates.|$|E
5|$|The {{technique}} of {{plant tissue culture}} in vitro improves the propagation of Hippeastrum by decreasing {{the time required to}} reach the minimum size to start <b>the</b> <b>reproductive</b> cycle, using sections of bulbs grown in artificial media with the addition of plant hormones.|$|E
5|$|Thrips are haplodiploid with haploid males (from unfertilised eggs, as in Hymenoptera) and diploid females {{capable of}} {{parthenogenesis}} (reproducing without fertilisation), many species using arrhenotoky, a few using thelytoky. The sex-determining bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia {{is a factor}} that affects <b>the</b> <b>reproductive</b> mode. Several normally bisexual species have become established in the United States with only females present.|$|E
40|$|A new {{epidemic}} SIRS {{model with}} discrete delay on scale-free network is presented. We give the formula of <b>the</b> basic <b>reproductive</b> number for <b>the</b> model and {{prove that the}} disease dies out when <b>the</b> basic <b>reproductive</b> number is less than unity, while the disease is uniformly persistent when <b>the</b> basic <b>reproductive</b> number is more than unity. Numerical simulations are given to demon-strate the main results...|$|R
5|$|Because {{the worker}} and soldier castes lack wings and thus never fly, and <b>the</b> <b>reproductives</b> use their wings {{for just a}} brief amount of time, {{termites}} predominantly rely upon their legs to move about.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> mare's <b>reproductive</b> {{system is}} {{responsible}} for controlling gestation, birth, and lactation, {{as well as her}} estrous cycle and mating behavior. <b>The</b> stallion's <b>reproductive</b> system {{is responsible for}} his sexual behavior and secondary sex characteristics (such as a large crest).|$|R
5|$|Worker {{policing}} {{occurs when}} worker bees {{in the colony}} are genetically {{more closely related to}} the queen than <b>the</b> <b>reproductive</b> female. In many instances, the eggs of the female worker are eaten, or she is repeatedly attacked by other workers. This mechanism of egg removal ensures that the queen's sons predominate.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} biotic and abiotic cues, such as {{individual}} genetics, foraging quantity and quality, or population density, may trigger the maturation of <b>the</b> <b>reproductive</b> organs {{and the production}} of gametes and thus determine sexual maturity. Like many reptiles, all marine turtles of a same aggregation are highly unlikely to reach sexual maturity at the same size and thus age.|$|E
5|$|As in all arthropods, the chelicerate {{body has}} a very small coelom {{restricted}} to small areas round <b>the</b> <b>reproductive</b> and excretory systems. The main body cavity is a hemocoel that runs most {{of the length of}} the body and through which blood flows, driven by a tubular heart that collects blood from the rear and pumps it forward. Although arteries direct the blood to specific parts of the body, they have open ends rather than joining directly to veins, and chelicerates therefore have open circulatory systems as is typical for arthropods.|$|E
50|$|Unlike cockroaches, only <b>the</b> <b>reproductives</b> have wings (see Life {{cycle of}} termites); wings that are {{considerably}} longer than their abdomen. Alates are approximately 35 mm long with a 50 mm wingspan. Soldiers are 11-13 mm long and workers are 10-11.5 mm long.|$|R
40|$|We review some {{fundamental}} results on <b>the</b> basic <b>reproductive</b> ratio of models in epidemiology following several documents.

5|$|Common {{starlings}} {{are both}} monogamous and polygamous; although broods are generally {{brought up by}} one male and one female, occasionally the pair may have an extra helper. Pairs {{may be part of}} a colony, in which case several other nests may occupy the same or nearby trees. Males may mate with a second female while the first is still on the nest. <b>The</b> <b>reproductive</b> success of the bird is poorer in the second nest {{than it is in the}} primary nest and is better when the male remains monogamous.|$|E
5|$|Contaminants {{that are}} {{discharged}} into {{the marine environment}} accumulate in the bodies of marine mammals when they are stored unintentionally in their blubber along with energy. Contaminants that {{are found in the}} tissues of marine mammals include heavy metals, such as mercury and lead, but also organochlorides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. For example, these can cause disruptive effects on endocrine systems; impair <b>the</b> <b>reproductive</b> system, and lower the immune system of individuals, leading to a higher number of deaths. Other pollutants such as oil, plastic debris and sewage threaten the livelihood of marine mammals.|$|E
5|$|Described {{as being}} similar {{to members of}} the genera Pareledone, Eledone, and Enteroctopus, V. togata has a large body with large eyes and {{extensive}} membranes that link the octopus' arms together. The species has a single line of suckers on each arm, and its head, mantle, and part of its arms are covered in warts. Although <b>the</b> <b>reproductive</b> habits of V. togata have not been extensively studied, the species is believed {{to be one of the}} most fecund among octopuses in its region and depth level, despite the species possessing large eggs and extremely large spermatophores.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> male <b>reproductive</b> {{system is}} a series of organs located outside of the body and around the pelvic region of a male that {{contribute}} towards the reproduction process.

Over the past 100 years, the dramatic increase in ocean noise from shipping and naval activity may have slowed {{the recovery of the}} fin whale population, by impeding communications between males and receptive females.|$|E
5|$|Following hatching, larvae feed on <b>the</b> <b>reproductive</b> {{structures}} of the plant and usually develop through four to six instars. Initially, the young larva feed together, and this stage is their most destructive stage. Through maturation, older larvae become aggressive and cannibalistic, leaving one or two larvae per feeding site (See Interfamilial Predation). They usually have orange heads, black thorax plates, and a body color that is primarily black. Their bodies can also be brown, pink, green, and yellow with many thorny microspines. Mature larvae migrate to the soil, where they pupate for 12 to 16 days.|$|E
5|$|Gastrotrichs have {{a simple}} body plan with a head region, with a brain and sensory organs, and a trunk with a simple gut and <b>the</b> <b>reproductive</b> organs. They have {{adhesive}} glands with which they can anchor themselves to the substrate and cilia with which they move around. They feed on detritus, sucking up organic particles with their muscular pharynx. They are hermaphrodites, the marine species producing eggs which develop directly into miniature adults. The freshwater species are parthenogenetic, producing unfertilised eggs, {{and at least one}} species is viviparous. Gastrotrichs mature with great rapidity and have lifespans of only a few days.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> male <b>reproductive</b> system {{encompasses}} several organs: the testes, ejaculatory ducts, seminal vesicles, prostate, and penis. The {{function of}} this system is to accomplish reproduction. Diagnostic imaging modalities, such as ultrasound, CT, MR imaging, and positron emission tomography (PET), are increasingly used to evaluate <b>the</b> male <b>reproductive</b> tract. <b>The</b> purpose of this review is to {{provide an overview of}} the use of imaging techniques in <b>the</b> male <b>reproductive</b> tract and to discuss current trends and future directions in prostate and testicular imaging. This review focuses on the prostate and scrotum...|$|R
40|$|Soldier caste is {{the oldest}} altruistic caste in termites, highly {{specialized}} for defensive tasks. Therefore, a number of adaptations in anatomy and behaviour {{can be observed in}} soldier, lacking in other termite castes. The aim {{of this study was to}} verify the hypothesis that in disturbed groups the soldiers will prefer to stand by and defend <b>the</b> <b>reproductives,</b> <b>the</b> most valuable individuals. Therefore, I studied in two species of the genus Prorhinotermes (P. simplex and P. canalifrons) the ability of soldiers to discriminate neotenic reproductives and provide them with defence. In agreement with the initial hypothesis, the soldiers of both species prooved to be able of an instantaneous recognition of reproductives and remained close to them. In P. simplex, the neotenic female was the most attractive individual, while in P. canalifrons, neotenics of both sexes were equally attractive. The observed preference of reproductives appears to occur only with a certain age of <b>the</b> <b>reproductives</b> in incipient colonies, along with their sexual maturation. Caste specificity of cuticular lipids supports the presumption that the caste recognition is based on olphactoric cues in <b>the</b> cuticle of <b>reproductives...</b>|$|R

5|$|House sparrows {{sleep with}} the bill tucked {{underneath}} the scapular feathers. Outside of <b>the</b> <b>reproductive</b> season, they often roost communally in trees or shrubs. Much communal chirping occurs {{before and after the}} birds settle in the roost in the evening, as well as before the birds leave the roost in the morning. Some congregating sites separate from the roost may be visited by the birds prior to settling in for the night.|$|E
5|$|However, off northeastern Brazil, {{the female}} {{reproductive}} cycle is short enough to occur annually. Vitellogenesis (the formation of yolk within the ovary) {{occurs in the}} late summer, and is immediately followed by mating and fertilization in the fall, with the young being born the following spring to summer. The seasonality of these events means <b>the</b> <b>reproductive</b> cycle is offset by six months between populations in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The gestation period has been variously estimated at eight months off northeastern Brazil and 911 months off the southeastern United States.|$|E
5|$|In 1889, Wallace {{wrote the}} book Darwinism, which {{explained}} and defended natural selection. In it, he proposed the hypothesis that natural selection could drive <b>the</b> <b>reproductive</b> isolation of two varieties by encouraging the development of barriers against hybridisation. Thus it might {{contribute to the development}} of new species. He suggested the following scenario. When two populations of a species had diverged beyond a certain point, each adapted to particular conditions, hybrid offspring would be less well-adapted than either parent form and, at that point, natural selection will tend to eliminate the hybrids. Furthermore, under such conditions, natural selection would favour the development of barriers to hybridisation, as individuals that avoided hybrid matings would tend to have more fit offspring, and thus contribute to <b>the</b> <b>reproductive</b> isolation of the two incipient species. This idea came to be known as the Wallace effect, later referred to as reinforcement. Wallace had suggested to Darwin that natural selection could play a role in preventing hybridisation in private correspondence as early as 1868, but had not worked it out to this level of detail. It continues to be a topic of research in evolutionary biology today, with both computer simulation and empirical results supporting its validity.|$|E
