5|$|After {{weeks of}} secret {{negotiations}} between merchants and protest leaders, an agreement was finally reached {{during the first}} week of May. According to the agreement, small, selected groups of African Americans would order food at the downtown lunch counters on a day known in advance to <b>the</b> <b>merchants.</b> <b>The</b> <b>merchants</b> would prepare their employees for the event and instruct them to serve the customers without trouble. This arrangement would continue in a controlled manner for a couple of weeks and then all controls would be taken off, at which point <b>the</b> <b>merchants</b> and protest leaders would reconvene to evaluate the results. Also as part of the agreement, the media was to be informed of the settlement and requested to provide only accurate, non-sensational coverage.|$|E
5|$|As {{trade between}} India and the Greco-Roman world {{increased}} spices became the main import from India to the Western world, bypassing silk and other commodities.

5|$|The ousting of <b>the</b> <b>merchants</b> from Constantinople {{was a heavy}} {{blow for}} Bulgarian {{economic}} interests. <b>The</b> <b>merchants</b> complained to Simeon I, who in turn raised the issue to Leo VI, but the appeal was left unanswered. Simeon, who according to the Byzantine chroniclers was seeking a pretext to declare war and to implement his plans to seize the Byzantine throne, attacked, provoking what has sometimes been called (inappropriately) the first commercial war in Europe. However, many historians including Vasil Zlatarski and John Fine consider those claims unlikely, arguing that {{in the beginning of}} his reign Simeon needed to consolidate his power and imperial ambitions had not yet been crystallised, therefore his military intervention was a defensive act to protect the Bulgarian commercial interests.|$|E
5|$|The towns {{which were}} located in the {{counties}} could hardly compete with the large Saxon centers. Kolozsvár was granted {{the right to buy}} landed property from the noblemen or other landowners in 1370, but its burghers were regarded as peasants by the bishops of Transylvania and the abbots of Kolozsmonostor Abbey, who forced them to pay the ninth (a seigneurial tax) on their vineyards until 1409. <b>The</b> <b>merchants</b> from Kolozsvár, Dés and other Transylvanian towns were exempted from internal levies, but the noblemen often ignored that privilege, forcing <b>the</b> <b>merchants</b> to pay duties while travelling across their domains.|$|E
5|$|Although {{social order}} was {{maintained}} throughout the plague years, {{the economy of}} the region was devastated. However, the surviving merchant community were very influential in the city and, {{in the wake of the}} catastrophe, set about increasing the council's influence around the market, buying many of the surrounding shops. The council also bought a set of wharves along King Street near Dragon Hall in 1397 and decreed that all goods entering Norwich by water be unloaded there. This ensured almost complete control of Norwich trade by <b>the</b> <b>merchants</b> who now dominated the council.|$|E

5|$|Although {{they were}} still allies, San Martín began to {{distance}} himself from Alvear, who controlled the Assembly and the lodge. Alvear opposed <b>the</b> <b>merchants</b> and the Uruguayan caudillo José Gervasio Artigas, San Martín thought that it was risky to open such conflicts when the royalists were still a threat. The Army of the North, which was operating at the Upper Peru, was defeated at the battles of Vilcapugio and Ayohuma, so the triumvirate appointed San Martín to head it, replacing Manuel Belgrano.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-16th century, Atlantic {{cod fishing}} {{developed}} on the Murman Coast in the north. The 1560s saw a {{rapid growth of}} international trade, with the Russian merchants from {{different regions of the}} country arriving to the peninsula to trade with <b>the</b> <b>merchants</b> from Western Europe. In 1585, however, the trade was moved to Archangel, although the settlement of Kola was still permitted to trade locally produced goods.|$|E

5|$|Ebrey {{argues that}} {{although}} most of Emperor Wu's fiscal policies were repealed during Eastern Han, their damage to the merchant class and the subsequent laissez-faire policies of Eastern Han allowed the wealthiest landowners to dominate society, ensuring that China's economy would remain firmly agrarian-based for centuries. The Eastern Han central government lost {{an important source of}} revenue by relinquishing its salt and iron industries and purchasing its armies' swords and shields from private manufacturers. However, this loss of revenue was often compensated by higher taxes levied on <b>the</b> <b>merchants.</b>|$|E

5|$|On the Monday {{following}} the first sit-in, the Baptist Minister's Conference of Nashville, representing 79 congregations, unanimously voted {{to support the}} student movement, thus throwing the weight of Nashville's black religious community behind the students.

Nashville's black community strongly supported the boycott, causing economic hardship for <b>the</b> <b>merchants.</b>|$|E
5|$|A further Bill in 1740 sought {{powers to}} improve the river from Barnby Dun to Fishlake Ferry. Despite serious opposition, which {{included}} <b>the</b> <b>merchants</b> and traders of Doncaster as well as Doncaster Corporation, the Bill was passed, giving the company new powers to make the river deeper and create a cut to avoid the shallows at Stainforth and Bramwith. Work on this northern section started almost immediately. The southern section to Tinsley was navigable by 1751, although the wharf and warehouse had not been completed by that date, and the towpath from Rotherham was not completed until 1822.|$|E
5|$|A trade {{route is}} a {{logistical}} network {{identified as a}} series of pathways and stoppages used for the commercial transport of cargo. The term {{can also be used to}} refer to trade over bodies of water. Allowing goods to reach distant markets, a single trade route contains long distance arteries, which may further be connected to smaller networks of commercial and noncommercial transportation routes. Among notable trade routes was the Amber Road, which served as a dependable network for long-distance trade. Maritime trade along the Spice Route became prominent during the Middle Ages, when nations resorted to military means for control of this influential route. During the Middle Ages, organizations such as the Hanseatic League, aimed at protecting interests of <b>the</b> <b>merchants,</b> and trade became increasingly prominent.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} 1420, vessels from Bristol were {{regularly}} travelling to Iceland {{and it is}} speculated that sailors from Bristol had made landfall in the Americas before Christopher Columbus or John Cabot. After Cabot arrived in Bristol, he proposed a scheme to the king, Henry VII, in which he proposed to reach Asia by sailing west across the north Atlantic. He estimated {{that this would be}} shorter and quicker than Columbus' southerly route. <b>The</b> <b>merchants</b> of Bristol, operating under the name of the Society of Merchant Venturers, agreed to support his scheme. They had sponsored probes into the north Atlantic from the early 1480s, looking for possible trading opportunities. In 1552 Edward VI granted a Royal Charter to the Merchant Venturers to manage the port.|$|E
5|$|Grill {{established}} {{a small scale}} trade monopoly at Godegård in 1775. Before he became owner of the ironworks, the farmers around Godegård had refined the wrought iron from the factory into large quantities of nails using small trip hammers. The nails were sold in Askersund. As a trader Grill would not abide this. First he decreed that the farmers had to buy all their goods at the ironworks' general store. Second, he forbade the farmers and tenant farmers to sell nails to <b>the</b> <b>merchants</b> at Askersund, at that time a center for nail trade. In this way Grill assumed control over all nail trade himself.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, {{registered}} marketplace merchants had a {{very low}} social status and were often subject to additional restrictions. Emperor Gaozu passed laws levying higher taxes, forbidding merchants from wearing silk, and barring their descendants from holding public office. These laws were difficult to enforce. Emperor Wu targeted both the registered and unregistered merchants with higher taxes. While registered merchants {{were not allowed to}} own land, if they broke this law their land and slaves would be confiscated. However, wealthy unregistered merchants owned large tracts of land. Emperor Wu significantly reduced the economic influence of great merchants by openly competing with them in the marketplace, where he set up government-managed shops that sold commodities collected from <b>the</b> <b>merchants</b> as property taxes.|$|E
