5|$|The club's nearest {{neighbour}} is Atlético Madrid, a rivalry being shared between fans of both football teams. Although Atlético {{was founded}} by three Basque students in 1903, it was joined in 1904 by dissident members of Madrid FC. Tensions escalated further after Atlético were merged with the football team of the Spanish airforce (and thus renamed Atlético Aviación), and in the 1940s, Atlético was perceived as the preferred team of Franco's regime before he revelled in Real's European success in the 1950s. Furthermore, Real supporters initially came from {{the middle and upper}} classes while the Atlético supporters were drawn from the working class. Today, however, <b>these</b> <b>distinctions</b> are largely blurred. They {{met for the first time}} on 21 February 1929 in matchday three of the first League Championship at the former Chamartín. It was the first official derby of the new tournament, and Real won 2–1.|$|E

25|$|Pregnancy is {{typically}} broken into three periods, or trimesters, each of about three months. Each trimester {{is defined as}} 14 weeks, for a total duration of 42 weeks, although the average duration of pregnancy is 40 weeks. While there are no hard and fast rules, <b>these</b> <b>distinctions</b> are useful in describing the changes that take place over time.|$|E
25|$|Punishment in Hell {{typically}} {{corresponds to}} sins committed during life. Sometimes <b>these</b> <b>distinctions</b> are specific, with damned souls suffering for each sin committed (see for example Plato's myth of Er or Dante's The Divine Comedy), {{but sometimes they}} are general, with condemned sinners relegated {{to one or more}} chamber of Hell or to a level of suffering.|$|E

25|$|Though {{the names}} {{diatonic}} and chromatic {{are often used}} for these intervals, their musical function {{is not the same}} as the two meantone semitones. For instance, 15:14 would usually be written as an augmented unison, functioning as the chromatic counterpart to a diatonic 16:15. <b>These</b> <b>distinctions</b> are highly dependent on the musical context, and just intonation is not particularly well suited to chromatic usage (diatonic semitone function is more prevalent).|$|E
25|$|Drawing <b>these</b> <b>distinctions</b> is necessary, {{but often}} {{challenging}} {{for the courts}} and lawyers, especially in jurisdictions where patents and copyrights pass into the public domain, depending on the jurisdiction. Unlike patents and copyrights, which in theory are granted for one-off fixed terms, trademarks remain valid {{as long as the}} owner actively uses and defends them and maintains their registrations with the competent authorities. This often involves payment of a periodic renewal fee.|$|E
25|$|The ISCB has elected Fellows since 2009. <b>These</b> <b>distinctions</b> {{are awarded}} {{in honour of}} {{outstanding}} contributions to the fields of computational biology and bioinformatics. The inaugural Class was given to previous recipients of the ISCB Accomplishment by a Senior Scientist Award; in following years, the ISCB has sought nominations for Fellows from its members. Fellows are traditionally introduced at the ISCB's flagship Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology conference each year. As of the Class of 2017, 64 Fellows have been elected.|$|E

25|$|An example {{where the}} mere Reynolds number is not {{sufficient}} for similarity of flows (or even the flow regime – laminar or turbulent) are bounded flows, i.e. flows that are restricted by walls or other boundaries. A classical {{example of this is}} the Taylor–Couette flow, where the dimensionless ratio of radii of bounding cylinders is also important, and many technical applications where <b>these</b> <b>distinctions</b> play an important role. Principles of these restrictions were developed by Maurice Marie Alfred Couette and Geoffrey Ingram Taylor and developed further by Floris Takens and David Ruelle.|$|E
25|$|Over a long time, Jews formed {{distinct}} {{ethnic groups}} in several different geographic areas—amongst others, the Ashkenazi Jews (of central and Eastern Europe), the Sephardi Jews (of Spain, Portugal, and North Africa), the Beta Israel of Ethiopia, and the Yemenite Jews from {{the southern tip of}} the Arabian Peninsula. Many of these groups have developed differences in their prayers, traditions and accepted canons; however, <b>these</b> <b>distinctions</b> are mainly the result of their being formed at some cultural distance from normative (rabbinic) Judaism, rather than based on any doctrinal dispute.|$|E
25|$|For {{various reasons}} {{it has become}} quite {{difficult}} to accurately assess reserves on more than simple loan instruments, and this plus the regional differences has tended to discourage standardizing any reserve rules at the global BIS scale. Historically, the BIS did set some standards which favoured lending money to private landowners (at about 5 to 1) and for-profit corporations (at about 2 to 1) over loans to individuals. <b>These</b> <b>distinctions</b> reflecting classical economics were superseded by policies relying on undifferentiated market values – {{more in line with}} neoclassical economics.|$|E

5000|$|... yet, a {{principal}} point of Moheyan's teaching is {{that according to}} Moheyan, {{the root cause of}} samsara is the creation of false distinctions, vikalpa-citta. As long as <b>these</b> false <b>distinctions</b> are being created, one is bound to samsara.|$|R
25|$|The {{third and}} most recent wave {{consists}} of Quebecers and other francophones (Haitians, Maghrebans, Europeans, etc.) who {{move to the}} larger cities and often preserve their original identity (Québécois, Haitian, etc.) as their primary cultural affiliation. Franco-Ontarians may also have historical ties {{to more than one}} of these three groups, which blurs the lines between <b>these</b> <b>distinctions.</b> Intermarriage between Franco-Ontarians and people of other ethnic or cultural backgrounds is also quite common. As a result, the complex political and sociological context of Franco-Ontarian can only be fully understood by recognizing both meanings and understanding the distinctions between the two.|$|E
25|$|One {{reason for}} the lesser use of niqqud is {{that it no longer}} {{reflects}} the current pronunciation. In modern Hebrew, tzere is pronounced the same as segol, although they were distinct in Tiberian Hebrew, and also pataḥ makes the same sound as a qamatz. To the younger generation of native Hebrew speakers, <b>these</b> <b>distinctions</b> seem arbitrary and meaningless; on the other hand, Hebrew language purists have rejected out of hand the idea of changing the basics of niqqud and fitting them to the current pronunciation – with the result that in practice niqqud is increasingly going out of use.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{the name}} Withington tends {{to refer to}} the areas roughly defined by the modern council wards of Withington and Old Moat, {{although}} fluctuating local government boundaries sometimes make <b>these</b> <b>distinctions</b> unclear. Withington and Old Moat wards are currently represented on Manchester City Council by three councillors each: Chris Paul (Labour and Co-operative Party), Chris Wills (Labour and Co-operative Party), and Rebecca Moore (Labour) in Withington; Andrew Fender (Labour), Suzannah Reeves (Labour) and Gary Ridges (Labour) in Old Moat. Council elections took place on 22 May 2016 with each ward returning one councillor, Chris Wills and Andrew Fender respectively in Withington and Old Moat wards.|$|E

50|$|Lymphoblasts can be {{distinguished}} microscopically from myeloblasts by having less distinct nucleoli, more condensed chromatin, and an absence of cytoplasmic granules.

25|$|The Conservatory of Flowers is a {{greenhouse}} and botanical garden that houses {{a collection of}} rare and exotic plants in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, California. With construction having been completed in 1879, it is the oldest building in the park. It {{was one of the}} first municipal conservatories constructed in the United States and is the oldest remaining municipal wooden conservatory in the country. For <b>these</b> <b>distinctions</b> and for its associated historical, architectural, and engineering merits, the Conservatory of Flowers is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and the California Register of Historical Places. It is a California Historical Landmark and a San Francisco Designated Landmark.|$|E
25|$|On {{the supply}} side of the market, some factors of {{production}} are described as (relatively) variable in the short run, which affects the cost of changing output levels. Their usage rates can be changed easily, such as electrical power, raw-material inputs, and over-time and temp work. Other inputs are relatively fixed, such as plant and equipment and key personnel. In the long run, all inputs may be adjusted by management. <b>These</b> <b>distinctions</b> translate to differences in the elasticity (responsiveness) of the supply curve in the short and long runs and corresponding differences in the price-quantity change from a shift on the supply or demand side of the market.|$|E
25|$|The NLRB and {{the courts}} provide {{different}} solutions against unions that breached their duty of fair representation. Because the Board does not usually have the jurisdiction to enforce {{the collective bargaining agreement}} or to issue a remedial order against an employer that has violated it, the NLRB often cannot award complete relief to employees. A court, on the other hand, may order an employer to reinstate or pay back pay to an employee if it finds that the employer violated the collective bargaining agreement and may, in some instances, order the union to pay attorneys' fees to a successful plaintiff. <b>These</b> <b>distinctions</b> do not apply to workers covered by the Railway Labor Act since, as noted above, they have no administrative procedures to enforce their rights.|$|E
