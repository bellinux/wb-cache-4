5|$|Henry had a {{problematic}} relationship with Louis VII of France throughout the 1150s. The {{two men had}} already clashed over Henry's succession to Normandy and the remarriage of Eleanor, and the relationship was not repaired. Louis invariably attempted to take <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> <b>high</b> ground in respect to Henry, capitalising on {{his reputation as a}} crusader and circulating rumours about his rival's behaviour and character. Henry had greater resources than Louis, however, particularly after taking England, and Louis was far less dynamic in resisting Angevin power than he had been earlier in his reign. The disputes between the two drew in other powers across the region, including Thierry, the Count of Flanders, who signed a military alliance with Henry, albeit with a clause that prevented the count from being forced to fight against Louis, his feudal lord. Further south, Theobald V, the Count of Blois, an enemy of Louis, became another early ally of Henry. The resulting military tensions and the frequent face-to-face meetings to attempt to resolve them has led historian Jean Dunbabin to liken the situation to the period of the Cold War in Europe in the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Đính and {{the leading}} generals in the MRC {{also had a}} secret plan to end the {{communist}} insurgency, which called itself the National Liberation Front (NLF) and claimed to be independent {{of the government of}} North Vietnam. They claimed that most of them were first and foremost southern nationalists opposed to foreign military intervention and U.S. involvement and support of Diệm. The generals agreed with this viewpoint and thought that an agreement to end the war within South Vietnam was possible. The government also rebuffed American proposals to bomb North Vietnam on the grounds that such actions would cede <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> <b>high</b> ground, which they claimed on the basis of fighting in a purely defensive manner. However, the plans to bring the NLF into the mainstream were never implemented to any degree before the government was deposed.|$|E
5|$|Shaw's major {{plays of}} {{the first decade of}} the twentieth century address {{individual}} social, political or ethical issues. Man and Superman (1902) stands apart from the others in both its subject and its treatment, giving Shaw's interpretation of creative evolution in a combination of drama and associated printed text. The Admirable Bashville (1901), a blank verse dramatisation of Shaw's novel Cashel Byron's Profession, focuses on the imperial relationship between Britain and Africa. John Bull's Other Island (1904), comically depicting the prevailing relationship between Britain and Ireland, was popular at the time but fell out of the general repertoire in later years. Major Barbara (1905) presents ethical questions in an unconventional way, confounding expectations that in the depiction of an armaments manufacturer on the one hand and the Salvation Army on the other <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> <b>high</b> ground must invariably be held by the latter. The Doctor's Dilemma (1906), a play about medical ethics and moral choices in allocating scarce treatment, was described by Shaw as a tragedy. With a reputation for presenting characters who did not resemble real flesh and blood, he was challenged by Archer to present an on-stage death, and here did so, with a deathbed scene for the anti-hero.|$|E

25|$|Writers {{turned to}} poetry and fiction to {{continue}} a debate which had been started centuries earlier by Guanzi and the Han dynasty Discourses on Salt and Iron: practical men argued that monopoly revenues helped the state {{to carry out its}} mission while Confucian critics argued that government monopolies made some groups rich and left others poor and exploited, and that salt taxes afflicted the people and encouraged expansionary wars which would doom the empire.

25|$|Students {{began the}} hunger strike on 13 May, two {{days prior to}} the highly publicized state visit by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Knowing that the {{welcoming}} ceremony for Gorbachev {{was scheduled to be}} held on the Square, student leaders wanted to use the hunger strike there as a bargaining chip to force the government into meeting their demands. Moreover, the hunger strike gained widespread sympathy from the population at large and earned the student movement <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> <b>high</b> ground that it sought. By the afternoon of 13 May, some 300,000 were gathered at the Square.|$|E
25|$|Aderca's take on fascism {{was more}} {{ambiguous}} than his stance on antisemitism. In {{addition to the}} retrospective parable in Muzică de balet, {{a number of his}} earlier texts feature more or less explicit anti-fascist tropes. This is the case of 1916, with its grim prognosis of radical nationalism, and Oameni excepționali, where Nazism appears as a heterogeneous ideology. Aderca saw Adolf Hitler as a pale copy of Stalin and a reluctant follower of Marxian economics, propelled into high office by the inconsistencies of the German Communist Party. According to Zalis, anti-fascistm is even present in the 1940 study of Peter the Great: Hitler was destroying a Europe that Peter had once helped civilize. In the late 1940s, investigating the wartime antisemitic crimes, Aderca objected to violent retribution, noting that victims had gained <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> <b>high</b> ground.|$|E

25|$|Ji Yan (died 224), {{courtesy}} name Zixiu, was {{an official}} of the state of Eastern Wu during the Three Kingdoms period of China. An impulsive and impetuous man, he thought highly of himself and liked to assume <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> <b>high</b> ground to criticise and disparage others. While serving in the selection bureau (the equivalent of a present-day human resources department), he came up with radical ideas to reform the bureaucracy by demoting or dismissing officials based on assessments of their moral character. His ideas proved to be highly unpopular as he incurred much resentment from his colleagues, who accused him of being unprofessional and biased. When his colleagues Lu Xun, Lu Mao and Zhu Ju advised him to change his offensive behaviour, he ignored their well-meaning advice. In 224, he committed suicide after he was removed from office on allegations of unprofessional conduct.|$|E

For their part, Minh and Thơ's leadership group believed that a more low-key military approach was needed for their political campaign against the insurgency.

500|$|After {{nearly a}} year of intense {{activism}} with few tangible results, the movement began to deteriorate. King requested a halt to all demonstrations and a [...] "Day of Penance" [...] to promote nonviolence and maintain <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> <b>high</b> ground. Divisions within the black community and the canny, low-key response by local government defeated efforts. Though the Albany effort proved a key lesson in tactics for King and the national civil rights movement, the national media was highly critical of King's role in the defeat, and the SCLC's lack of results contributed to a growing gulf between the organization and the more radical SNCC. After Albany, King sought to choose engagements for the SCLC in which he could control the circumstances, rather than entering into pre-existing situations.|$|E

[...] His parents wrote him frequently, advising him to maintain <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>moral</b> standards, work on developing the highest social graces, and to seek as much glory and official recognition as possible. They criticized the smallest things, such as omitting to date a letter or slurping his soup. His father urged him to learn how to read Greek and Latin, and to read only the best books such as compilations of famous people's letters, histories, and those novels which taught only <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>moral</b> values.|$|R
500|$|Dredd used various [...] "dirty tricks" [...] to {{undermine}} the March. He blackmailed the organisers by fabricating evidence against them and threatening to leak it to the press. He told Gort Hyman {{that if he did}} not withdraw he would conscript his children into the Academy of Law to be trained as cadet judges (the Academy does not require parental consent). He arrested an elderly leader on a trumped-up charge and made him stand all night without sleep or food, before releasing him minutes before the March was due to start, so that he would collapse from exhaustion along the way, undermining morale. Dredd ordered Weather Control to produce rain to reduce attendance. By the time the March started, numbers were well below the expected turnout. Undercover judges planted as agitators in the crowd first undermined morale by defeatist talk, and then incited violence by throwing things at uniformed judges, giving Dredd the excuse he needed to send in riot squads to break up the March and make arrests. The organisers were sentenced to significant terms of incarceration. Yet publicly, the Judges appeared to have <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> <b>high</b> ground.|$|E
500|$|There {{was also}} {{mounting}} political opposition against Chancellor Jia Sidao. Jia had purged several dissident officials who {{were opposed to}} his reforms aimed at limiting official corruption and personal profiteering. When he replaced some of these officials with his own cronies, however, political conditions were ripe for a schism at court and within the gentry class that would be favorable to a strong, unified force led by Kublai. Kublai used various ploys and gestures in order to entice defectors from the Southern Song to his side. Kublai Khan established Dadu (Beijing) as his new capital in 1264, catering {{to the likes of}} the Chinese with his advisor Liu Bingzhong and the naming of his dynasty with the Chinese word for [...] "primal" [...] ("Yuan"). He made it a policy to grant land, clothing, and oxen to Song Chinese who defected to his side. Kublai Khan chose <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> <b>high</b> ground of releasing Song captives and prisoners while Jia Sidao refused to release Kublai's emissary Hao Jing. In 1261 Kublai personally released seventy-five Song merchants captured at the border; in 1263 he released fifty-seven merchants; in 1269 he released forty-five merchants. In 1264 he publicly reprimanded his own officers for executing two Song generals without trial or investigation. With these acts his reputation and legitimacy {{in the eyes of the}} Chinese were greatly enhanced.|$|E

2500|$|The {{decentralized}} {{model of}} activism is frustrating {{for law enforcement}} organizations, who find the networks difficult to infiltrate, {{because they tend to}} be organized around friends.

The tactics of some of the more determined ALF activists are anathema to many animal rights advocates, such as Singer, who regard the movement as something that should occupy <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> <b>high</b> ground. ALF activists respond to the criticism with the argument that, as Ingrid Newkirk puts it, [...] "Thinkers may prepare revolutions, but bandits must carry them out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Inside the {{building}} were 12 {{members of the}} Irish Republican Army Executive, including Chief-of-Staff Joe McKelvey, Director of Engineering Rory O'Connor and Quartermaster General Liam Mellows. The garrison consisted of roughly 180 men drawn from the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the IRA's 1st Dublin Brigade, commanded by Commandant Paddy O'Brien, armed {{for the most part}} only with small arms (rifles, five Thompson submachineguns and two Lewis light machine guns) apart from one captured armored car, which they named [...] "The Mutineer". The members of the IRA Army Executive were the political leaders of the garrison, but served as common soldiers under the command of Ernie O'Malley, commander of the IRA's 2nd Southern Division. The Anti-Treaty side fortified the Four Courts to some extent, planting mines around the complex and barricading the doors and windows, but their leadership ordered them not to fire first, in order to retain <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> <b>high</b> ground, and so the Free State troops were allowed to surround the Four Courts.|$|E
2500|$|Ji Yan had a {{tendency}} to offend people not only because of his straightforward and impetuous character, but also because he thought highly of himself and liked to assume <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> <b>high</b> ground to criticise and disparage others. In particular, he liked to highlight others' faults and spread news of scandalous incidents involving others, just to make himself seem better and show how critical he could be. In his view, there was a serious problem of human resources mismanagement in the bureaucracy as many officials were unsuitable for their jobs because they were either administratively incompetent or morally corrupt. He thus came up with radical ideas to reform the bureaucracy according to the way he desired: he wanted to conduct a thorough assessment of all personnel to separate the virtuous from the corrupt, and then demote or dismiss them accordingly. If his ideas were implemented, over 90 percent of all the staff would be affected and many who failed the [...] "morality test" [...] would end up being demoted to jun li (軍吏), one of the lowest positions in the bureaucracy. Because of his radical ideas, Ji Yan incurred much resentment from several officials, who accused him of being unprofessional and biased.|$|E
