5|$|During {{the final}} game of the 2006–07 season, Sakic scored his 100th point of the year. This made him, at age 37, the second oldest player in NHL history, after Gordie Howe, to record 100 points in a regular season. He became the longest active tenured captain in the league, with fifteen seasons leading the Nordiques/Avalanche franchise, after the {{retirement}} of Steve Yzerman {{at the conclusion of the}} 2005–06 regular season. On March 22, 2008, against the Edmonton Oilers, Sakic recorded the 1,000th assist of his career, the 11th player to do so. <b>The</b> <b>gloves</b> he wore in the game were later sent to the Hockey Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|He {{played in}} only one match against England at Lord's, where he got out after scoring one run. Despite {{dropping}} England captain Michael Vaughan from the bowling of Anil Kumble, he eventually stumped Vaughan down the legside and took another catch. He played another match in the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy against Kenya, taking three catches as India persisted with Dravid's wicket-keeping {{for the majority of}} the English tour. Karthik was not required to bat as India only lost four wickets in their innings. He was subsequently replaced in the ODI team by Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who took over <b>the</b> <b>gloves</b> from Dravid on a full-time basis; Karthik did not play another ODI until April 2006.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Super Punch-Out!! {{is similar}} to that of its arcade and NES/FC predecessors. The player controls a nameable boxer as he fights his way to become W.V.B.A. Champion. The player controls the boxer from a third-person perspective, with him being translucent on the screen. Players can attack their opponents with jabs to the face or with body blows from either hand. The opponent can deflect punches, so players must aim at the opponent's open spot (where <b>the</b> <b>gloves</b> are not) to connect. Depending on the opponents' stances, they will guard themselves differently, so players need to use the correct punches.|$|E

5|$|His {{first full}} season from 1940–1941 saw him play in eight matches, scoring 413runs with the bat at 29.50 and passing fifty runs in an innings twice. His first match was away against Queensland where he scored 22 and 45, making three stumpings, taking one catch and {{performing}} one run out, followed by scores {{of one and}} 33 in the home match, together with two stumpings. He scored 35 and four at home against Victoria, and then 45 in the second innings of the away match. On 22 November 1940, barely a year into Saggers' career, New South Wales faced a combined Queensland-Victoria team at Brisbane.

In the Queensland-Victoria team's second innings, where they reached 416, Saggers equalled the world record for most dismissals in an innings, taking seven catches. Saggers then went on to score 47 against South Australia, and 68 against Queensland on 1 January 1941. In his final match before the outbreak of World War II, Saggers scored 63 runs against South Australia. He ended the season with 18 catches with <b>the</b> <b>gloves</b> and 13stumpings.|$|E
5|$|The Green Goblin is {{armed with}} a variety of bizarre devices. He wears a green costume {{underneath}} bulletproof chainmail with an overlapping purple tunic. His mask has a built-in gas filter to keep him safe from his own gasses. The Green Goblin's trademark weapons are his pumpkin bombs and razor bats. As their name suggests, the bombs were designed with the appearance of jack-o'-lanterns. These varied in function from smoke bombs to traditional explosives, while the razor edged bat-shaped boomerangs-could cut through very durable surfaces and materials. <b>The</b> <b>gloves</b> of the Goblin uniform were fashioned with minuscule conductors that allowed for the release of electricity at nearly 10,000 amps of an undetermined voltage. Originally, Osborn used a mechanical broomstick to fly through the air during his first few exploits as the Green Goblin. The Flying Broomstick did not last long, however, and was improved upon, creating the Goblin Glider. The Goblin Glider was a more efficient flight system than Norman's Flying Broomstick. The Glider allowed the Goblin to carry a wide array of armaments, including heat-seeking and smart missiles, machine guns, extending blades, a flamethrower and a pumpkin bomb dispenser/launcher with him as he flew and had much greater speed and mobility than the Broomstick.|$|E

40|$|The {{most recent}} {{generation}} of space suit EVA <b>gloves</b> has addressed <b>the</b> problem of loose fit and stiffness in the fingers, {{but it remains}} difficult to build a glove assembly with low metacarpophalangeal joint stiffness. Fatigue due to constantly displacing <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> from a neutral position has been reported as the limiting factor in some EVA activities. This paper outlines an actuation system that uses gas filled bladders attached {{to the back of}} <b>the</b> EVA <b>glove</b> to provide <b>the</b> necessary force to bend <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> at <b>the</b> metacarpal joint, thus providing greater endurance during finger grasping tasks. A simple on-off controller senses hand movement through small pressure sensors between the finger and <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> restraint. <b>The</b> controller then fills or exhausts the bladders on the back of <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> to effectively move the neutral position of <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> as <b>the</b> hand inside moves...|$|R
40|$|A {{metallic}} 'glove' {{structure has}} been built and attached to the wing of the Pegasus(trademark) space booster.

40|$|The main {{objectives}} for <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> project include taking various measurements from human subjects {{during and after}} they perform different tasks in <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> box, acquiring data from these tests and determining the accuracy of these results, interpreting and analyzing this data, and using the data to better understand how hand injuries are caused during EVAs. 1 Some of these measurements include force readings, temperature readings, and micro-circulatory blood flow. 1 <b>The</b> three <b>glove</b> conditions tested were ungloved (a comfort glove was worn to house the sensors), Series 4000, and Phase VI. The general approach/procedure for <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> sensor feasibility project is as follows: 1. Prepare test subject for testing. This includes attaching numerous sensors (approximately 50) to the test subject, wiring, and weaving the sensors and wires in <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> which helps to keep everything together. This also includes recording baseline moisture data using the Vapometer and MoistSense. 2. Pressurizing <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> box. Once <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> box is pressurized to the desired pressure (4. 3 psid), testing can begin. 3. Testing. The test subject will perform a series of tests, some of which include pinching a load cell, making a fist, pushing down on a force plate, and picking up metal pegs, rotating them 90 degrees, and placing {{them back in the}} peg board. 4. Post glove box testing data collection. After the data is collected from inside <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> box, <b>the</b> Vapometer and MoistSense device will be used to collect moisture data from the subject's hand. 5. Survey.

50|$|While {{playing the}} field, Pete Gray wore a glove without padding.

40|$|Structural {{modeling}} of <b>the</b> EVA <b>glove</b> indicates that {{flexibility in the}} metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint can be improved by selectively lowering the elasticity of <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> fabric. Two strategies are used to accomplish this. One method uses coil springs {{on the back of}} <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> to carry <b>the</b> tension in <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> skin due to pressurization. These springs carry the loads normally borne by <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> fabric, but are more easily deformed. An active system was also designed for the same purpose and uses gas filled bladders attached to the back of <b>the</b> EVA <b>glove</b> that change <b>the</b> dimensions of the back of <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> and allow <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> to bend at the MCP joint, thus providing greater flexibility at this joint. A threshold control scheme was devised to control the action of the joint actuators. Input to the controller was provided by thin resistive pressure sensors placed between the hand and <b>the</b> pressurized <b>glove.</b> <b>The</b> pressure sensors consist of a layer of polyester film that has a thin layer of ink screened on the surface. The resistivity of the ink is pressure dependent, so an extremely thin pressure sensor can be fabricated by covering the ink patch with another layer of polyester film and measuring the changing resistance of the ink with a bridge circuit. In order to sense the force between the hand and <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> at <b>the</b> MCP joint, a sensor was placed on the palmar face of the middle finger. The resultant signal was used by the controller to decide whether to fill or exhaust the bladder actuators on the back of <b>the</b> <b>glove.</b> <b>The</b> information from the sensor {{can also be used to}} evaluate the effectiveness of a given control scheme or <b>glove</b> design since <b>the</b> magnitude of the measured pressures gives some idea of the torque required to bend a <b>glove</b> finger at <b>the</b> MCP joint. Tests of this actuator, sensor, and control system were conducted in an 57. 2 kPa glove box by performing a series of 90 degree finger bends with a glove without an MCP joint assembly, a <b>glove</b> with <b>the</b> coil spring assembly, and with the four fingered actuated <b>glove.</b> <b>The</b> tests of these three <b>glove</b> designs confirm <b>the</b> validity of the model...|$|R
