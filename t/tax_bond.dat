The main benefit of this diploma paper consists of analysis of primary data.

The questionnaire, which I had done by myself, was sent to 46 multinational companies which their business platforms are located also in the Czech Rep. The most valuable written sources from which some data for my diploma paper were taken is the real documentation of transfer pricing done for the request of advance pricing arrangement as well as the decision of tax administrator in the same case according to the § 38 nc Law N. 586 / 1992 Sb., about income tax. Just the character of the data guarantees the practical application of this diploma paper.

May provide up to 20 % electricity rate reduction for residential and small commercial customers of investor owned utilities by January 1, 1999. Restricts customer information dissemination. Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local governments: The net impact of the measure on state government revenues would be annual revenue reductions potentially {{in the range of}} $ 100 million per year from 1998 - 99 through 2001 - 02, in turn resulting in decline in the minimum funding guarantee under Proposition 98 for K- 14 education by about $ 50 million after 2001 - 02. The state would be required to offset a portion of local school district losses in property taxes, resulting from downward assessments of nuclear facilities. Potential state liability for debt service on $ 7 billion in bonds previously issued may result from judicial interpretation of applicability of measure to those bonds. Additional workload may increase state administrative, judicial and legal costs of probably less than $ 5 million annually. The net impact on local governments would be revenue reductions, potentially in the {{tens of millions of dollars}} annually from 1998 - 99 through 2001 - 02. State and local governments would realize savings associated with lower utility rates, in the tens of millions of dollars annually...|$|E
