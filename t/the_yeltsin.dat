25|$|By 1996, {{at the age}} of 30, Abramovich {{had become}} close to President Boris Yeltsin, and had moved into an {{apartment}} inside the Kremlin at the invitation of <b>the</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> family.|$|E
25|$|It {{was also}} alleged that Alexander Voloshin, {{a key figure}} in <b>the</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> administration, paid Basayev to stage the Dagestan incursion, and that Basayev was working for the Russian GRU at the time. According to the BBC, {{conspiracy}} theories are part of the staple diet of Moscow politics.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet Union under Vladimir Lenin decriminalized {{homosexuality}} in 1922, {{long before}} many other European countries. The Soviet Communist Party effectively legalized no-fault divorce, abortion and homosexuality, when they abolished {{all the old}} Tsarist laws and the initial Soviet criminal code kept these liberal sexual policies in place. Lenin's emancipation was reversed a decade later by Joseph Stalin and homosexuality remained illegal under Article 121 until <b>the</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> era.|$|E
5000|$|On 28 November 1991, President of <b>the</b> RSFSR Boris <b>Yeltsin</b> signed {{presidential decree}} No.242 [...] "On {{reorganization}} of the government bodies of <b>the</b> RSFSR". <b>Yeltsin</b> officially declared <b>the</b> end of the Soviet Union and became the President of <b>the</b> Russian Federation. <b>Yeltsin</b> was a reformer and promised Western-styled democracy.|$|R
50|$|Sticking {{to what he}} believed, {{and despite}} the ongoing support for <b>the</b> law, President <b>Yeltsin</b> vetoed <b>the</b> law on March 18, 1997. Making his {{position}} clear in his official message to <b>the</b> Duma, <b>Yeltsin</b> stood firm that the law was in contradiction of <b>the</b> Constitution. Further <b>Yeltsin</b> {{pointed out that the}} law went against Russian bilateral agreements with other European countries.|$|R

25|$|Yeltsin {{claimed that}} by {{dissolving}} the Russian parliament in September 1993 he was clearing the tracks for a rapid {{transition to a}} functioning market economy. With this pledge, he received strong backing from the leading powers of the West. Yeltsin enjoyed a strong relationship with the Western powers, particularly the United States, but the relationship made him unpopular with some Russians. In Russia, <b>the</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> side had control over television, where hardly any pro-parliament views were expressed during the September–October crisis.|$|E
25|$|Panic struck <b>the</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> {{team when}} opinion polls {{suggested}} that the ailing president could not win; some members of his entourage urged him to cancel presidential elections and effectively rule as dictator from then on. Instead, Yeltsin changed his campaign team, assigning a key role to his daughter, Tatyana Dyachenko, and appointing Chubais as campaign manager. Chubais, acting as both Yeltsin's campaign manager and adviser on Russia's privatisation programme, used his control of the privatisation programme {{as an instrument of}} Yeltsin's reelection campaign.|$|E
25|$|Boris Yeltsin {{was born}} in the village of Butka, Talitsky District, Sverdlovsk, USSR, on 1 February 1931. In 1932 after the state took away the entire harvest from the {{recently}} collectivised Butka peasants, <b>the</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> family moved as far away as they could, to Kazan, more than 1,100 kilometres from Butka, where Boris' father, Nikolai, found work on a construction site. Growing up in rural Sverdlovsk, he studied at the Ural State Technical University (now Urals Polytechnic Institute), and began his career in the construction industry. In 1934 Nikolai Yeltsin was convicted of anti-Soviet agitation and sentenced to hard labour in a gulag for three years.|$|E
50|$|More recently, on January 25, 2015, <b>the</b> Boris <b>Yeltsin</b> Presidential Center {{opened in}} Yekaterinburg.|$|R
50|$|After {{completion}} of the national anthem, Boris <b>Yeltsin</b> went to <b>the</b> desk behind which sat Ruslan Khasbulatov. Sitting at <b>the</b> table <b>Yeltsin</b> and Khasbulatov listened to a speech of the Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia Alexy II. After the speech of <b>the</b> Patriarch, Boris <b>Yeltsin</b> delivered his first speech as President of Russia, and then made a congratulatory speech, President of the USSR Mikhail Gorbachev.|$|R
25|$|On April25, a {{majority}} of voters expressed confidence in the president and called for new legislative elections. <b>Yeltsin</b> termed <b>the</b> results a mandate for him to continue in power. Before <b>the</b> referendum, <b>Yeltsin</b> had promised to resign, if the electorate failed to express confidence in his policies. Although this permitted the president to declare that the population supported him, not <b>the</b> parliament, <b>Yeltsin</b> lacked a constitutional mechanism to implement his victory. As before, {{the president had to}} appeal to the people {{over the heads of the}} legislature.|$|R
25|$|In 1998, {{the general}} {{decided to run}} for {{governor}} of the Krasnoyarsk Krai (the second largest region in Russia), wanting {{to get out of the}} politics in Moscow after his ouster from <b>the</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> administration. He ended up winning the election for governor, defeating the incumbent Valery Zubov, despite being a complete outsider. There was speculation that he would run for the presidency in 2000, with Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov being projected as his main opponent at that time. However, in 2000 Lebed decided against running for president because he was satisfied with his position as the governor of Krasnoyarsk Krai. Lebed held this position until his death in a Mil Mi-8 helicopter crash on April 28, 2002, after it collided with electric lines during foggy weather in the Sayan Mountains.|$|E
25|$|The {{risk for}} supply interruptions {{aimed at the}} states of the Former Soviet Union is present today. Depending on {{bilateral}} relations and the present context, the risk for partial and/or short-duration cut-offs is high. Since 1991, the energy lever has been used for putting political or economic pressure on Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Georgia that subsequently affected most of Europe. The number of incidents, i.e. cut-offs, take-overs, coercive price policy, blackmail or threats, is over fifty in total (of which about forty are cut-offs). Incidents appear to be equally divided between <b>the</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> and Putin eras, but the number of cut-offs has decreased by half during Putin. The immediate reasons for Russia’s coercive policy appear to be political concession in ongoing negotiations, infrastructure take-over, and execution of economically favorable deals or to make political statements. There are economic underpinnings in the majority of the cases and Russian demands for payments of debts are legitimate. However, there are also political underpinnings in {{more than half of the}} incidents, and in a few cases explicit political demands are evident.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the time}} of the ninth Congress, the {{legislative}} branch was dominated by the Russian Unity bloc, which included representatives of the CPRF and the Fatherland faction (communists, retired military personnel, and other deputies of a socialist orientation), Agrarian Union, and the faction [...] "Russia" [...] led by Sergey Baburin. Together with more 'centrist' groups (e.g. 'Change' (Смена)), <b>the</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> supporters ('Democratic Russia', 'Radical democrats') were clearly left in the minority.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout 1992, {{opposition}} to Yeltsin's reform policies grew {{stronger and more}} intractable among bureaucrats concerned {{about the condition of}} Russian industry and among regional leaders who wanted more independence from Moscow. Russia's vice president, Aleksandr Rutskoy, denounced <b>the</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> program as [...] "economic genocide". Indeed, {{during the first half of}} 1992, the average income of the population declined 2–2.5 times. Leaders of oil-rich republics such as Tatarstan and Bashkiria called for full independence from Russia.|$|E
2500|$|Much of <b>the</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> era {{was marked}} by {{widespread}} corruption, {{and as a result}} of persistent low oil and commodity prices during the 1990s, Russia suffered inflation, economic collapse, and enormous political and social problems that affected Russia and the other former states of the USSR. Within a few years of his presidency, many of Yeltsin's initial supporters had started to criticize his leadership, and Vice President Alexander Rutskoy even denounced the reforms as [...] "economic genocide".|$|E
500|$|Not {{everyone}} {{agreed with the}} adoption of <b>the</b> new anthem. <b>Yeltsin</b> argued that Putin should not have changed the anthem merely to [...] "follow blindly the mood of <b>the</b> people". <b>Yeltsin</b> also felt that {{the restoration of the}} Soviet anthem was part of a move to reject post-communist reforms that had taken place since Russian independence and the dissolution of the Soviet Union. This was one of Yeltsin's few public criticisms of Putin.|$|R

2500|$|In mid-1996, Chubais and Yeltsin {{recruited}} {{a team of}} {{a handful}} of financial and media oligarchs to bankroll <b>the</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> campaign and guaranteed favorable media coverage the president on national television and in leading newspapers. In return, Chubais allowed well-connected Russian business leaders to acquire majority stakes in some of Russia's most valuable state-owned assets. Led by the efforts of Mikhail Lesin, the media painted a picture of a fateful choice for Russia, between Yeltsin and a [...] "return to totalitarianism." [...] The oligarchs even played up the threat of civil war if a Communist were elected president.|$|E
2500|$|Lieutenant General Alexander Ivanovich Lebed ( [...] ; April 20, 1950 – April 28, 2002) was a Russian {{military}} officer and politician who held senior {{positions in the}} Airborne Troops before attempting to run for President of Russia in the 1996 election. He did not win, but placed third behind incumbent Boris Yeltsin and the Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, with roughly 14 {{percent of the vote}} nationwide. Lebed later served as the Secretary of the Security Council in <b>the</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> administration, and eventually became the governor of Krasnoyarsk Krai, the second largest Russian region. He served four years in the latter position, until his death following a Mi-8 helicopter crash.|$|E
2500|$|Some economists {{argue that}} in the 1990s Russia {{suffered}} an economic downturn more severe than the United States or Germany had undergone six decades earlier in the Great Depression. Russian commentators and even some Western economists, such as Marshall Goldman, widely blamed Yeltsin's economic program for the country's disastrous economic performance in the 1990s. Many politicians began to quickly {{distance themselves from the}} program. In February 1992, Russia's vice president, Alexander Rutskoy denounced <b>the</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> program as [...] "economic genocide." [...] By 1993 conflict over the reform direction escalated between Yeltsin on the one side, and the opposition to radical economic reform in Russia's parliament on the other.|$|E
