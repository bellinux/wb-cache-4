50|$|<b>Tetramethylammonium</b> (TMA) or (Me4N+) is the {{simplest}} quaternary ammonium cation consisting of four methyl groups {{attached to a}} central nitrogen atom, and is isoelectronic with neopentane. It is positively charged and must exist in association with a counter-ion, and is most commonly found in simple salts such as <b>tetramethylammonium</b> chloride, <b>tetramethylammonium</b> bromide, <b>tetramethylammonium</b> iodide and <b>tetramethylammonium</b> hydroxide, and can also form the unusual auride. <b>Tetramethylammonium</b> salts are used in chemical synthesis and are widely employed in pharmacological research. They also occur as toxic natural products, although the counterions {{may be difficult to}} identify. The identity of the anion associated with the <b>tetramethylammonium</b> cation frequently has little or no bearing on a particular chemical or biological type of action, but this is not invariably so.|$|E

50|$|The {{synthetic}} {{applications of}} TMA are numerous and diverse, but are most appropriately considered under the entries for individual TMA salts (e.g. <b>tetramethylammonium</b> chloride and <b>tetramethylammonium</b> hydroxide). In general, although TMA salts do possess {{some of the}} phase-transfer catalytic properties that are characteristic of quaternary ammonium compounds, they tend to behave atypically because of the relatively high hydrophilicity of the TMA cation.|$|E

5000|$|Quaternary {{ammonium}} cations are unreactive toward even strong electrophiles, oxidants, and acids. They {{also are}} stable toward most nucleophiles.

5000|$|The <b>tetramethylammonium</b> ion [...] affects {{nerves and}} muscles, causing {{difficulties}} in breathing, muscular paralysis and possibly death.

This structural similarity is reflected in its mechanism of toxicity - it binds to and activates the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, although they may become densensitized in the continued presence of the agonist. The action of <b>tetramethylammonium</b> is most pronounced in autonomic ganglia, and so <b>tetramethylammonium</b> is traditionally classed as a ganglion-stimulant drug.
