5|$|Ultimately, B Company {{succeeded in}} holding their hastily {{constructed}} defensive positions {{throughout the night}} and until 05:00 on 8 October when the Chinese finally gave up. In order to preserve its remaining strength, the Chinese 191st Division was forced to pull back by , surrendering the control of Hill 217 without a fight. At first light more than 120 Chinese dead and wounded lay around the Australian defences and {{in contrast to the}} savage fighting during the night, Chinese stretcher parties were allowed <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> and collect their wounded under a flag of truce. The Australians had been victorious but were now exhausted after five days of heavy fighting.|$|E
5|$|With the Australian and Viet Cong {{positions}} now {{too close}} to each other, O'Halloran could neither move forward nor withdraw. Artillery began to fire {{in support of the}} Australians, however it initially fell too far to the rear to be effective, and it had to be adjusted by the B Company forward observer, Captain Jim Ryan, himself under heavy fire. 5 Platoon was still in danger of becoming isolated and O'Brien now suggested he move A Company forward to assist B Company, however this was rejected by Mackay who feared the two companies clashing in the confusion. Meanwhile, O'Halloran called for the APCs <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> to provide assistance, while the platoon sergeant—Sergeant Mervyn McCullough—guided a section from 6 Platoon forward to reinforce 5 Platoon, and begin evacuating the casualties. Bolstered by reinforcements and with accurate artillery covering fire O'Halloran now felt that he {{was in a position to}} extract his platoon. Yet at that moment two rounds from one of the howitzers fell short, and while one of the shells harmlessly exploded against a tree, the other landed just to the right of the 5 Platoon headquarters, killing two men and wounding eight others, including six of the seven reinforcements from 6 Platoon. Following an urgent radio call from O'Halloran, the artillery ceased fire. Shortly afterwards an RPG round hit the same area, wounding McCullough.|$|E

25|$|The {{case has}} been {{described}} as unique because of the reluctance of the victims <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>forward.</b> It has been said that there are difficulties in determining the guilt of particular offenders, due to their behaviour existing on a moral continuum and the law being dichotomous in nature, being an 'absolute concept'. Therefore, even though the victims may have actually consented to the relationships, the law still deems it as criminal.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{an average}} {{reduction}} in deaths in custody since 2004, a 2014 Public Confidence Survey revealed that public satisfaction following {{contact with the}} police was falling {{and that there was}} a greater willingness to complain.

25|$|Police {{were met}} with silence in many areas as they asked for {{witnesses}} <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>forward,</b> receiving few tips despite so many people having been witnesses to, or victims of, the events.
