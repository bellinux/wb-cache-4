It was the fastest that a restaurant had gone from one to three stars in the UK. During the same year, {{the restaurant}} was ranked second in the world behind The French Laundry by The World's 50 Best Restaurants. The restaurant also received the title of Square Meal BMW Best UK Restaurant 2004. The following year the listing ranked The Fat Duck as the best restaurant in the world, At the first Front of House Awards in 2007, the restaurant won the awards for Overall Service and Front Desk of the Year.|$|E
50|$|Where book one {{introduces}} {{the reader to}} 15 geometric properties that make up living systems, Alexander reframes those geometric properties as structure-preserving transformations {{in and of themselves}} rather than being the results of other transformations. For example, Alexander claims <b>that</b> <b>Levels</b> <b>of</b> Scale will arise naturally as a result of structure-preserving transformations, but he notes <b>that</b> <b>Levels</b> <b>of</b> Scale can also be viewed as a transformation <b>that</b> introduces <b>level</b> <b>of</b> scale into a given structure.

It remains at <b>that</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> accolade {{as of the}} 2013 Michelin Guide. El Celler de Can Roca has been listed in The World's 50 Best Restaurants by Restaurant magazine since 2006 when it was ranked 21st. In 2009 it was ranked fifth and was awarded the prize for being the highest climbing restaurant on the list. In 2010, it rose one place to fourth and in 2011, 2012 and 2014, it was ranked in second place behind Danish New Nordic cuisine restaurant Noma, with fellow Spanish restaurant Mugaritz in third place. On 29 April 2013 the {{restaurant was}} named {{the best in the}} world. In The Daily Meal's inaugural list of the best 101 restaurants in Europe in 2012, El Celler de Can Roca was ranked twelfth. During the same year, it was named as restaurant of the year by The Sunday Telegraph.|$|E
5|$|Horizontal jumps (long {{jump and}} triple jump) and all throws must be {{initiated}} behind a line. In {{the case of}} horizontal jumps, that line is a straight line perpendicular to the runway. In the case of throws, that line is an arc or a circle. Crossing the line while initiating the attempt invalidates the attempt—it becomes a foul. All landings must occur in a sector. For the jumps, that is a sand filled pit, for throws it is a defined sector. A throw landing on the line {{on the edge of}} sector is a foul (the inside edge of the line is the outside edge of the sector). Assuming a proper attempt, officials measure the distance from the closest landing point back to the line. The measuring tape is carefully straightened to the shortest distance between the point and the line. To accomplish this, the tape must be perfectly perpendicular to the take off line in jumps, or is pulled through the center point of the arc for throws. The officials at the landing end of the tape have the zero, while the officials at the point of initiation measure and record the length. Whenever a record (or potential record) occurs, that measurement is taken (again) with a steel tape, and observed by at least three officials (plus usually the meet referee). Steel tapes are easily bent and damaged, so are not used to measure everyday competitions. For major competitions, each competitor gets three tries. The top competitors (usually 8 or 9 depending on that competition's rules or the number of lanes on the track) gets three more tries. At <b>that</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> competition, the order of competitors for those final three attempts are set—so the competitor in first place {{at the end of the}} third round is last, while the last competitor to qualify goes first. Some meets rearrange the competition order again for the final round, so the final attempt is taken by the leader at that point. At other competitions, meet management may choose to limit all competitors to four or three attempts. Whatever the format, all competitors get an equal number of attempts.|$|E

These findings indicate <b>that</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> multipliers are pro-cyclical: like the P/D ratio, {{they tend to be}} high at times of low expected returns.
