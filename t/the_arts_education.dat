40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{part of the}} thesis contains information about the assessment and the specific method of assessment in <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>education.</b> <b>The</b> research part is divided into preliminary research and three stages of research - the interview, the observation and questionnaire own experiment and subsequent questioning. In these stages of research I have found information on the experiences and attitudes to assessment in <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>education,</b> {{but also on the}} whole subject of <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>education.</b> <b>The</b> survey was conducted in one class mainstream primary school {{in a small town in}} the South Bohemian Region. The work provides interesting information about the current view of pupils and their teachers on <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>education</b> and its assessment. The results suggest the need for pupils to be assessed, especially classified and the ability of students to use assessment criteria. Research findings may contribute to the debate regarding <b>the</b> evaluation in <b>art</b> <b>education.</b> They are also useful for the preparation of training teachers in the primary education, improving teaching and can be the basis for more extensive research investigations...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{notification}} aims to {{find out}} what kind of effects furniture and decoration magazines have on <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>education.</b> It is possible to mention about two different points of view regarding this subject. The first one argues that products, which take place in these magazines, are results of a design process; they aim to develop creativity of readers besides providing their artistic and aesthetical developments; and thus, they can be useful in <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>education.</b> <b>The</b> second one emphasizes that these magazines are products of the popular culture; they serve to the expansion of the popular culture; and thus, they cannot contribute to <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>education.</b> Visual <b>arts</b> <b>education</b> aims to enable persons to express their emotions, opinions and observations; and to increase their skills and creativities to an aesthetical level. It is an education activity which teaches persons how to canalize their excitements. <b>The</b> <b>art</b> <b>education</b> is not just/only limited to <b>the</b> visual <b>arts</b> given at schools, and it is required to last for the whole life...|$|R

2500|$|The {{debate about}} Québécois {{nationhood}} centres {{on the question}} of the status of the province of Quebec and its primarily French-speaking population. During the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s, the term Québécois largely replaced French Canadian as an expression of cultural and nationalist identity as French Canadians asserted themselves culturally. The modern Québécois identity is secular and based on a social democratic ideal of the Quebec State promoting Quebec French culture and language in <b>the</b> <b>arts,</b> <b>education,</b> and business within the province. Politically, this resulted in a movement towards more provincial autonomy. Quebec federalists in the Liberal Party of Quebec argued for more autonomy within Canada, while Quebec sovereigntists, mostly within the Parti Québécois, argued for outright independence from Canada. Quebec nationalists increasingly referred to provincial institutions as being [...] "national", changing the name of the provincial [...] "Legislative Assembly" [...] to the [...] "National Assembly of Quebec" [...] in 1968, for example.|$|E

40|$|In 1982, the Getty Center for <b>Education</b> in <b>the</b> <b>Arts,</b> an {{operating}} entity {{of a private}} foundation, began to promote discipline-based <b>art</b> <b>education</b> (DBAE), a newly-articulated paradigm that had evolved within <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>education</b> field over <b>the</b> previous twenty years. The new paradigm, which advocated balanced and sequential instruction in aesthetics, criticism, art history, and studio production across the grades, contrasted sharply with traditional practice {{that focused on the}} student's innate creativity and expressiveness. A controversy ensued as the Getty Center and <b>the</b> National <b>Art</b> <b>Education</b> Association, <b>the</b> field's professional affiliation, each tried to advance a definition of <b>art</b> <b>education</b> practice. Rather than focusing on the contentious paradigms, this dissertation considers the Getty Center's activities on behalf of DBAE as an instance of professional challenge. Working from the sociological literature on professions and using a time series of selected Getty and NAEA documents published between 1985 and 1989, this study examines the dialectic between the Getty and <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>education</b> field and NAEA as each tries to garner sufficient legitimacy to establish its prescribed form of <b>art</b> <b>education</b> practice. <b>The</b> dissertation offers a new perspective for <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>education</b> field and refines professionalization literature by describing the process of professional challenge...|$|R
6000|$|... "'The fratricidal {{principle}} of {{the survival of the}} fittest, which in those days was England's moral teaching, had made the country one huge butcher's shop. Amongst the carcasses of countless victims there had fattened and grown purple many butchers, physically strengthened by the smell of blood and sawdust. These had begotten many children. Following out the laws of Nature providing against surfeit, a proportion of these children were born with a feeling of distaste for blood and sawdust; many of them, compelled for the purpose of making money to follow in their fathers' practices, did so unwillingly; some, thanks to their fathers' butchery, were in a position to abstain from practising; but whether in practice or at leisure, distaste for the scent of blood and sawdust was the common feature that distinguished them. Qualities hitherto but little known, and generally despised--not, as we shall see, without some reason--were developed in them. Self-consciousness, aestheticism, a dislike for waste, a hatred of injustice; these--or some one of these, when coupled with that desire natural to men throughout all ages to accomplish something--constituted the motive forces which enabled them to work their bellows. In practical affairs those who were under the necessity of labouring were driven, under the then machinery of social life, to the humaner and less exacting kinds of butchery, such as <b>the</b> <b>Arts,</b> <b>Education,</b> the practice of Religions and Medicine, and the paid representation of their fellow-creatures. Those not so driven occupied themselves in observing and complaining of the existing state of thing. Each year saw more of their silver cockleshells putting out from port, and the cheeks of those who blew the sails more violently distended. Looking back on that pretty voyage, we see the reason why those ships were doomed never to move, but, seated on the sea-green bosom of that sea, to heave up and down, heading across each other's bows in the self-same place for ever. That reason, in few words, was this: 'The man who blew should have been in the sea, not on the ship.'" ...|$|E
