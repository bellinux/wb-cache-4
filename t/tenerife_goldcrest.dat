They were sometimes called the <b>Tenerife</b> <b>goldcrest,</b> no matter which of the islands they lived on; however, a 2006 study of the vocalisations of these birds indicate that they actually comprise two subspecies of the goldcrest that are separable on voice; R. r. teneriffae occurring on Tenerife and the newly described subspecies, R. r. ellenthalerae, the western Canary Islands goldcrest, occurring on the smaller islands of La Palma and El Hierro.|$|E

50|$|Previously {{thought to}} be the same taxon as the <b>Tenerife</b> <b>Goldcrest</b> Regulus regulus teneriffae, it was {{separated}} as a distinct subspecies of the goldcrest which apparently evolved from an independent colonisation of the islands 1.3-1.8 million years ago.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Tenerife</b> <b>goldcrest,</b> Regulus regulus teneriffae, (sometimes {{considered}} a separate species, R. teneriffae) {{is a very}} small passerine bird in the kinglet family, closely resembling the goldcrest but with a broader black band across the forehead, slightly darker underparts and a longer bill. It breeds in the Canary Islands of Tenerife and La Gomera, where it is a non-migratory resident. It prefers Canary Island Pine forests, but also occurs in laurisilva forests.|$|E

The three goldcrest taxa on the Azores, Santa Maria goldcrest, Sao Miguel goldcrest and Western Azores goldcrest, represent recent colonisations from Europe, and are best treated as subspecies.|$|E
