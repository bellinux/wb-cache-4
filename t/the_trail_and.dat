40|$|The U. S. Army manages {{thousands}} of sites that cover {{millions of acres}} of land for various military training purposes and activities and often faces a great challenge on how to optimize the use of resources. A typical example is that the training activities often lead to off-road vehicle <b>trails</b> <b>and</b> paths and how to use <b>the</b> <b>trails</b> <b>and</b> paths in terms of minimizing maintenance cost becomes a problem. Being able to accurately extract <b>and</b> map <b>the</b> <b>trails</b> <b>and</b> paths is critical in advancing the U. S. Army 2 ̆ 7 s sustainability practices. The primary objective {{of this study is to}} develop a method geared specifically toward the military 2 ̆ 7 s needs of identifying and updating <b>the</b> off-road vehicle <b>trails</b> <b>and</b> paths for both environmental and economic purposes. The approach was developed using a well-known template matching program, called Feature Analyst, to analyze <b>and</b> extract <b>the</b> relevant <b>trails</b> <b>and</b> paths from Fort Riley 2 ̆ 7 s designated training areas. A 0. 5 meter resolution false color infrared orthophoto with various spectral transformations/enhancements were used to extract <b>the</b> <b>trails</b> <b>and</b> paths. <b>The</b> optimal feature parameters for the highest accuracy of detecting <b>the</b> <b>trails</b> <b>and</b> paths were also investigated. A modified Heidke skill score was used for accuracy assessment of the outputs in comparison to the observed. The results showed the method was very promising, compared to traditional visual interpretation and hand digitizing. Moreover, suggested methods for extracting <b>the</b> <b>trails</b> <b>and</b> paths using remotely sensed images, including image spatial and spectral resolution, image transformations and enhancements, and kernel size, was obtained. In addition, the complexity of <b>the</b> <b>trails</b> <b>and</b> paths <b>and</b> <b>the</b> discussion on how to improve their extraction in the future were given...|$|R

5|$|Anderson's efforts helped spark renewed {{interest}} in <b>the</b> <b>trail,</b> <b>and</b> Avery (who led the charge after Perkins’ death in 1932) {{was able to bring}} other states on board. Upon taking over the ATC, Avery adopted the more practical goal of building a simple hiking trail. He and MacKaye clashed over the ATC's response to a major commercial development along the trail's path; MacKaye left the organization, while Avery was willing to simply reroute the trail. Avery reigned as Chairman of the ATC from 1932 to 1952 (he died that same year).|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, the ATC made {{progress}} toward protecting the trail from development, thanks to efforts {{of politicians and}} officials. The National Trails System Act of 1968 designated the Pacific Crest Trail and Appalachian Trail as the first national scenic trails and {{paved the way for}} a series of National Scenic Trails within the National Park and National Forest systems. Trail volunteers worked with the National Park Service to map a permanent route for <b>the</b> <b>trail,</b> <b>and</b> by 1971 a permanent route had been marked (though minor changes continue to this day). By the close of the 20th century, the Park Service had completed the purchase of all but a few miles of the trail's span.|$|E
5|$|Indicated by {{artifacts}} {{found near}} Lake Sepasco, a small lake along NY308, the highway began its history in about 1685, {{when a group}} of Native Americans called the Sepasco built the Sepasco Trail; this trail ran from the Hudson River, eastward through modern-day Rhinebeck (then Sepasco or Sepascoot), and ended at Lake Sepasco, following roughly Route308 and its side roads. The trail remained until 1802, when part of the Ulster and Delaware Turnpike — also known as the Salisbury Turnpike — was chartered over <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> <b>and</b> extended from Salisbury, Connecticut to the Susquehanna River at or near the Town of Jericho (now Bainbridge).|$|E

5|$|The American {{black bear}} (Ursus americanus), {{among the largest}} animals along the Appalachian Trail, rarely confronts people. The black bear is the largest {{omnivore}} that may be encountered on <b>the</b> <b>trail,</b> <b>and</b> it inhabits all regions of the Appalachians. Bear sightings on the trail are uncommon, except in certain sections, especially Shenandoah National Park and portions of New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts sections, where bear populations have increased steadily since 1980; confrontations are rarer still.|$|E
5|$|The {{notion of}} barefoot hordes pushing heavily-loaded bicycles, driving oxcarts, or acting as human pack animals, moving {{hundreds}} {{of tons of}} supplies in this manner was quickly supplanted by trucks (especially Soviet, Chinese, or Eastern Bloc models), which quickly became the main method of supply transportation. As early as December 1961, the 3rd Truck Transportation Group of PAVN's General Rear Services Department had become the first motor transport unit fielded by North Vietnamese to work <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> <b>and</b> the use of motor transport escalated.|$|E

5|$|Allen's men marched southward {{from the}} base, with the {{intention}} of entering the enemy base camp from a slightly different direction to the west. Preceded by marching artillery fire, the 2nd Battalion stopped periodically to conduct cloverleaf patrols to their front, rear and both flanks. At 9:56am the lead element of Alpha Company stumbled upon a northeast-southwest trail, which appeared to have been used within the last hour. The 1st Platoon Leader then requested and received permission to make cloverleaf patrols to the east and west of the trail. Almost immediately, the 1st Platoon sighted a Viet Cong soldier while scouting west of <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> <b>and</b> another group of Viet Cong soldiers soon appeared. George then ordered the 1st Platoon to set up a hasty ambush across the trail, but {{by the time they were}} in position the Viet Cong soldiers had disappeared and everything was quiet. About 10–15 minutes later, the 1st Platoon Leader reported that trees were moving, in addition to the sound of weapons clicking and the rattle of ammunition.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2009 race, {{officials}} {{decided to}} advance the competition's start date by one week to better accommodate mushers also participating in the Iditarod. The 2010 race started in Fairbanks on February 6, 2010, and the early start date was kept for the 2011 competition. Hans Gatt won the 2010 race with the fastest finish in Yukon Quest history: 9days and 26minutes. That race was marked by good weather, and few mushers dropped out. In 2011, conditions returned to normal, as violent storms blasted <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> <b>and</b> mushers {{during the second half}} of the race. Only 13 of the 25 competitors completed the race, tying the record for fewest finishers. In 2013, poor trail conditions over American Summit forced the Dawson to Eagle section of the course to be rerouted over the Yukon River.|$|E
5|$|In March 1971 South Vietnamese forces, {{supported}} by U.S. air power, launched Operation Lam Son 719, the long-awaited offensive {{to cut the}} Ho Chi Minh trail in southeastern Laos. However, {{the result was a}} failure. North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces had already begun to expand the trail system westward, pushing Royal Lao forces toward the Mekong, slowly extending the territory it controlled, moving west of <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> <b>and</b> creating a larger buffer zone between its logistical system and the South Vietnamese. After Lam Son 719, that process accelerated. Hanoi's effort was simplified {{by the fact that the}} Royalist forces in the south had little experience fighting PAVN and they were quickly overwhelmed. Inept and ineffective were terms utilized to describe their defense. On 30 April 1971 the key town of Attopeu was seized by the communists.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the Willie Company departing Florence, {{the company}} met {{to debate the}} wisdom of such a late departure. Because the emigrants were {{unfamiliar}} with <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> <b>and</b> the climate, they deferred to the returning missionaries and Church agents. One of the returning missionaries, Levi Savage, urged them to spend the winter in Nebraska. He argued that such a late departure with a company consisting of the elderly, women and young children would lead to suffering, sickness and even death. All of the other Church elders argued that the trip should go forward, expressing optimism that the company would be protected by divine intervention. Some members of the company, {{perhaps as many as}} 100, decided to spend the winter in Florence or in Iowa, but the majority, about 404 in number (including Savage) continued the journey west. The Willie Company left Florence on August 17 and the Martin Company on August 27. Two ox-wagon trains, led by captains W.B. Hodgett and John A. Hunt, followed the Martin Company.|$|E

His father tells him that it was his imagination, goes back downstairs, but then screams. Quinton rushes down to find his father dead and his eyes turned red with blood. Doggett and Scully investigate this latest death after the police tell them about the strange man the boy saw. While discussing the lack of any damage to the body except the broken blood vessels in the eyes, Scully comes {{to the conclusion that the}} man is still inside the latest victim. She rushes to the morgue and finds the boy’s father with a distended belly. She cuts into him and then sees a hand emerge from the scalpel incision. After being temporarily knocked over, she follows a bloody trail, opens a door at the end of <b>the</b> <b>trail,</b> <b>and</b> finds no one there.
