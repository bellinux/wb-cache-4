The Wulai Atayal in particular have been active in this area. Considerable government funding has been allocated to museums and culture centers focusing on Taiwan's aboriginal heritage. Critics often call the ventures exploitative and [...] "superficial portrayals" [...] of aboriginal culture, which distract attention from <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>problems</b> of substandard education.

Schwarz slammed the attempts to restrict press freedoms, and stated that [...] "Society as a whole is not condemned because individuals transgress, and nor should the press as a whole be judges by the actions of individuals."

2500|$|Still Eisenhower faced {{criticism}} in the press for not controlling his own administration, as Cannon's speech only said the mission was [...] "under the aegis of" [...] the president, not [...] "directed by." [...] Press reports were creating {{a belief in the}} public that Eisenhower had lost control, which Eisenhower would not let stand. Knowing that he was jeopardizing the Paris Peace Summit, Eisenhower decided to reveal the aerial espionage program and his direct role in it, an unprecedented move for a U.S. President. His speech on 11 May revolved around four main points: the need for intelligence gathering activities; the nature of intelligence gathering activities; how intelligence activities should be viewed (as distasteful, but vital); and finally that Americans should not be distracted from <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>problems</b> of the day. Eisenhower closed passionately by reacting to the Soviet claim that the US acted provocatively and said: [...] "They had better look at their own [...] record."

It made a big noise, but there's no dead bug." [...] Holman Jenkins of the Wall Street Journal said the order was [...] "an exercise in symbolic confidence-building" [...] and that naked shorting involved technical concerns except for subscribers to a [...] "devil theory". The Economist said the SEC had [...] "picked the wrong target", mentioning a study by Arturo Bris of the Swiss International Institute for Management Development who found that trading in the 19 financial stocks became less efficient. The Washington Post expressed approval of the SEC's decision to address a [...] "frenetic shadow world of postponed promises, borrowed time, obscured paperwork and nail-biting price-watching, usually compressed into a few high-tension days swirling around the decline of a company." [...] The Los Angeles Times called the practice of naked short selling [...] "hard to defend," [...] and stated that it was past time the SEC became active in addressing market manipulation.|$|E
