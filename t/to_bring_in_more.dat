5|$|In February 2010, local councillors from Kent and Pas-de-Calais {{announced}} {{they were in}} talks to establish a frequent local rail service between the regional stations along the route. Trains would leave Lille and stop at Calais, Ashford and Stratford before reaching London St Pancras. Currently, Ashford and Calais have an infrequent service and Eurostar trains do not call at Stratford. The initiative is part of Calais' branding {{as part of the}} UK in order to benefit from the 2012 London Olympics but is supported {{on both sides of the}} channel <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> <b>more</b> commuters.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{showcase}} the PlayStation Portable's capabilities, {{the team had}} to develop a download system that could provide the game with future downloadable content, which included new tracks, music and ships. In addition, Burrows realised that new downloadable content had the potential <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> <b>more</b> revenue for Studio Liverpool. In order to achieve this, the team {{had to find a}} way to bypass the problems involved in getting the PlayStation Portable to recognise download files. The solution required the use of piggybacking game data to a valid format recognised by the PlayStation Portable; in which a dummy file would be used on a web-based Java application.|$|E
5|$|On 11 June, the French bombarded {{the fort}} from land and sea. The fort's {{garrison}} fought back, and its commander, Rechberg, managed <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> <b>more</b> ammunition from Floriana. On 12 June, the bombardment {{of the fort}} continued, but by then the French had captured Valletta, Floriana, and Fort Manoel. The Maltese militia left the fort, reducing its garrison to 80 men. By {{the end of the}} day, the ammunition had run out, and parts of the fort were damaged during the bombardment. When Rechberg and his soldiers attempted to escape, the French captured them, and the fort was in French hands by 13 June.|$|E

5|$|Historians are {{now turning}} to local gazetteers of Ming China for clues {{that would show}} {{consistent}} growth in population. Using the gazetteers, Brook estimates that the overall population under the Chenghua Emperor (r. 1464–1487) was roughly 75 million, despite mid-Ming census figures hovering around 62 million. While prefectures across the empire in the mid-Ming period were reporting either a drop in or stagnant population size, local gazetteers reported massive amounts of incoming vagrant workers with not enough good cultivated land for them to till, so that many would become drifters, conmen, or wood-cutters that contributed to deforestation. The Hongzhi and Zhengde emperors lessened the penalties against those who had fled their home region, while the Jiajing Emperor (r. 1521–67) finally had officials register migrants wherever they had moved or fled in order <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> <b>more</b> revenues.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo, Donatello, and Michelangelo {{plan their}} next move, while Donatello discovers the next portal will open over Winters' tower. Splinter tells Leonardo {{that his team}} is incomplete, and that {{he knows what he}} must do. After 11 monsters have been captured, General Aguila {{questions}} Yaotl's actions. The generals conspire to betray Yaotl, wanting to remain immortal. Raphael encounters the Jersey Devil, one of the remaining monsters but drives it off. Leonardo fights Raphael, but when he breaks Leonardo's swords, Raphael is forced to leave. The generals seize Leonardo, intending to substitute him for the 13th missing beast, and Raphael decides to make amends by rescuing Leonardo. As the portal opens, Yaotl discovers his generals' treachery, while Splinter and the Turtles, accompanied by Casey and April, fight their way through the Foot Clan cordon and breach the tower. Yaotl reveals the truth to the heroes: he wants to be free of his curse of immortality. The generals reveal that they wish to preserve their immortality, but also to use the portal <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> <b>more</b> monsters to conquer the world.|$|E

The Penang Transport Master Plan envisages the following long-term solutions {{to counter the}} state's worsening traffic congestion, which is compounded by Penang's abnormally high vehicle ownership rate and the state's limited space for urban development.|$|E
25|$|Haussmann {{worked on}} his vast {{projects}} for seventeen years, employing {{tens of thousands of}} workers. He rebuilt the sewers of Paris so they no longer emptied into the Seine and built a new aqueduct and reservoir <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> <b>more</b> fresh water. He demolished most of the old medieval buildings on the Ile de la Cite and replaced them with a new hospital and government buildings.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of the Parisienne Safari, the Firebird and Fiero, beginning in 1988 all Pontiacs, with {{the exception}} of the Firebird, switched to front-wheel drive platforms. For the first time since 1970, Pontiac was the number three domestic car maker in America. Pontiac's drive <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> <b>more</b> youthful buyers was working as the median age of Pontiac owners dropped from 46 in 1981 to 38 in 1988.|$|E

25|$|With {{the loss}} of the IBM deal, Gary and Dorothy found {{themselves}} under pressure <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> <b>more</b> experienced management, and Gary's influence over the company waned. He worked in various experimental and research projects, such as a version of CP/M with multitasking (MP/M) and an implementation of the Logo programming language. He hoped that Logo, an educational dialect of LISP, would supplant BASIC in education, but it did not.|$|E
25|$|Reclassifying an HUC as a {{component}} city likely involves not only amending the concerned city's charter, but also the Local Government Code, as currently there is no provision in the LGC that allows this, nor are there any precedents.

The car was well praised by Indian motor magazines, but it couldn't live up to the hype created by the previous generation Octavia. Fabia has not succeeded in this market due to dealer problems, steep prices and Škoda trying to position itself as a luxury marque. Škoda India has decided <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> <b>more</b> powerful engines at better prices and taken strict measures to improve dealer quality levels and curb excessive service costs.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} locations {{cost between}} $1.2 million and and $1.5 million to build. Such low pricing requires Chuze Fitness <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> many <b>more</b> customers than its larger competitors {{in order to}} cover the cost of the buildings. As Chuze Fitness has expanded beyond its initial offerings of cardio and free weights, new locations have <b>more</b> than doubled <b>in</b> size (and cost), requiring even more customers.|$|R
25|$|After she has {{fixed the}} {{position}} of the nest, she begins to build the nest. She repeats the procedure of bringing in a pulp, attaching it to the nest to form a spindle and flying back out <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> <b>more</b> pulps. During this process, the queen clings to the nest with her two posterior pairs of legs and attaches the pulp using her anterior legs and mouth parts. She builds 20–30 cells before initial egg-laying, fashioning a petiole and producing a single cell at the end of it. Six further cells are then added around this to produce the characteristic hexagonal shape of the nest cells. One egg is laid in each cell, and as it hatches, each larva holds itself in the vertical cell by pressing its body against the sides.|$|E
25|$|During a game, {{players are}} given a pre-determined amount of {{reinforcement}} points, with which to purchase units with varying costs. Once the player deploys the units they purchase, they must wait 20 seconds {{for them to be}} airdropped to the field. If a unit is destroyed, the points are refunded to the player in order to allow them <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> <b>more</b> units. During the single-player campaign, most missions vary what units the player can recruit, while some missions will offer the opportunity to recruit free units, though these cannot be replaced if destroyed. Each unit has strengths and weaknesses, such as mobile anti-air guns being most effective against enemy helicopters, and repair tanks being most effective at keeping vehicles and armor repaired. Each unit possesses a defensive ability, such as deploying smokescreens, while some units possess an offensive ability, such as marking targets for bombardment or using grenade launchers on enemy infantry. Once a unit's special ability(ies) has been spent, players must wait for them to recharge before they can be used again.|$|E
