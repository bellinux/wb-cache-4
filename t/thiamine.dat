5|$|Anti-vitamins are {{chemical}} compounds that inhibit the absorption or actions of vitamins. For example, avidin is a protein in raw egg whites that inhibits {{the absorption of}} biotin; it is deactivated by cooking. Pyrithiamine, a synthetic compound, has a molecular structure similar to <b>thiamine,</b> vitamin B1, and inhibits the enzymes that use <b>thiamine.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1957, Ronald Breslow {{proposed}} that a relatively stable nucleophilic carbene, a thiazol-2-ylidene derivative, {{was involved in}} the catalytic cycle of vitamin B1 (<b>thiamine)</b> that yields furoin from furfural.|$|E
5|$|When {{made with}} chickpeas, falafel {{is high in}} protein, complex carbohydrates, and fiber. Key {{nutrients}} are calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, zinc, copper, manganese, vitamin C, <b>thiamine,</b> pantothenic acid, vitamin B, and folate. Phytochemicals include beta-carotene. Falafel is high in soluble fiber, which {{has been shown to}} be effective in lowering blood cholesterol.|$|E
5|$|Early {{treatment}} {{increases the}} chance of a good outcome. Treatment consists of stabilizing the person, followed by the use of an antidote. The preferred antidote is fomepizole with ethanol used if this is not available. Hemodialysis may also be used in those where there is organ damage or a high degree of acidosis. Other treatments may include sodium bicarbonate, <b>thiamine,</b> and magnesium.|$|E
5|$|Other {{conditions}} that are closely linked to cerebellar degeneration include the idiopathic progressive neurological disorders multiple system atrophy and Ramsay Hunt syndrome type I, and the autoimmune disorder paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, in which tumors elsewhere in the body elicit an autoimmune response that causes neuronal loss in the cerebellum. Cerebellar atrophy can result from an acute deficiency of vitamin B1 (<b>thiamine)</b> as seen in beriberi and in Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome, or from vitamin E deficiency.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the most}} {{significant}} scientific research to emerge from Morgan's laboratory concerned the biochemistry of vitamins and the nutritional value of foods. She became best known for her work examining the effects of pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) on adrenal gland function. In her early research work, Morgan analyzed processed foods and characterized their vitamin composition. She was the first to establish that a preservative, sulfur dioxide, protected vitamin C but damaged <b>thiamine.</b>|$|E
5|$|Well-known human vitamin {{deficiencies}} involve <b>thiamine</b> (beriberi), niacin (pellagra), vitamin C (scurvy), {{and vitamin}} D (rickets). In {{much of the}} developed world, such deficiencies are rare; {{this is due to}} (1) an adequate supply of food and (2) the addition of vitamins and minerals to common foods (fortification). In addition to these classical vitamin deficiency diseases, some evidence has also suggested links between vitamin deficiency and a number of different disorders.|$|E
5|$|Coenzymes {{are small}} organic {{molecules}} {{that can be}} loosely or tightly bound to an enzyme. Coenzymes transport chemical groups from one enzyme to another. Examples include NADH, NADPH and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Some coenzymes, such as flavin mononucleotide (FMN), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), <b>thiamine</b> pyrophosphate (TPP), and tetrahydrofolate (THF), are derived from vitamins. These coenzymes cannot be synthesized by the body de novo and closely related compounds (vitamins) must be acquired from the diet. The chemical groups carried include the hydride ion (H−) carried by NAD or NADP+, the phosphate group carried by adenosine triphosphate, the acetyl group carried by coenzyme A, formyl, methenyl or methyl groups carried by folic acid and the methyl group carried by S-adenosylmethionine.|$|E
5|$|Fomepizole is {{a potent}} {{inhibitor}} of alcohol dehydrogenase; similar to ethanol, it acts to block {{the formation of the}} toxic metabolites. Fomepizole {{has been shown to be}} highly effective as an antidote for ethylene glycol poisoning. It is the only antidote approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ethylene glycol poisoning. Both antidotes have advantages and disadvantages. Ethanol is readily available in most hospitals, is inexpensive, and can be administered orally as well as intravenously. Its adverse effects include intoxication, hypoglycemia in children, and possible liver toxicity. Patients receiving ethanol therapy also require frequent blood ethanol concentration measurements and dosage adjustments to maintain a therapeutic ethanol concentration. Patients therefore must be monitored in an intensive care unit. Alternatively, the adverse side effects of fomepizole are minimal and the approved dosing regimen maintains therapeutic concentrations without the need to monitor blood concentrations of the drug. The disadvantage of fomepizole is that it is expensive. Costing US$1,000 per gram, an average course used in an adult poisoning would cost approximately $3,500 to $4,000. Despite the cost, fomepizole is gradually replacing ethanol as the antidote of choice in ethylene glycol poisoning. Adjunct agents including <b>thiamine</b> and pyridoxine are often given, because they may help prevent the formation of oxalic acid. The use of these agents is based on theoretical observations and there is limited evidence to support their use in treatment; they may be of particular benefit in people who could be deficient in these vitamins such as malnourished or alcoholic patients.|$|E
25|$|Sulbutiamine (brand name: Arcalion) is a {{synthetic}} derivative of <b>thiamine</b> (vitamin B1). As a dimer of two modified <b>thiamine</b> molecules, it is a lipophilic compound that crosses the blood–brain barrier {{more readily than}} <b>thiamine</b> and increases the levels of <b>thiamine</b> and <b>thiamine</b> phosphate esters in the brain. Sulbutiamine was discovered in Japan {{in an effort to}} develop more useful <b>thiamine</b> derivatives since it was hoped that increasing the lipophilicity of <b>thiamine</b> would result in better pharmacokinetic properties.|$|E
25|$|The salt <b>thiamine</b> mononitrate, {{rather than}} <b>thiamine</b> hydrochloride, {{is used for}} food fortification, as the mononitrate is more stable, and does not absorb water from natural {{humidity}} (is non-hygroscopic), whereas <b>thiamine</b> hydrochloride is hygroscopic. When <b>thiamine</b> mononitrate dissolves in water, it releases nitrate (about 19% of its weight) and is thereafter absorbed as the <b>thiamine</b> cation.|$|E
25|$|Uptake of <b>thiamine</b> by {{cells of}} the blood and other tissues occurs via active {{transport}} and passive diffusion. About 80% of intracellular <b>thiamine</b> is phosphorylated and most is bound to proteins. In some tissues, <b>thiamine</b> uptake and secretion appears to be mediated by a soluble <b>thiamine</b> transporter that is dependent on Na+ and a transcellular proton gradient.|$|E
25|$|Transketolase {{activity}} is decreased in deficiency of <b>thiamine,</b> which {{in general is}} due to malnutrition. Several diseases are associated with <b>thiamine</b> deficiency, including beriberi, Biotin-Thiamine-Responsive Basal Ganglia Disease, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, and others (see <b>thiamine</b> for a comprehensive listing).|$|E
25|$|In most cases, {{individuals}} with alcoholic polyneuropathy have {{some degree of}} nutritional deficiency. Alcohol, a carbohydrate, increases the metabolic demand for <b>thiamine</b> (vitamin B1) because of {{its role in the}} metabolism of glucose. <b>Thiamine</b> levels are usually low in alcoholics due to their decreased nutritional intake. In addition, alcohol interferes with intestinal absorption of <b>thiamine,</b> thereby further decreasing <b>thiamine</b> levels in the body. <b>Thiamine</b> is important in three reactions in the metabolism of glucose: the decarboxylation of pyruvic acid, d-ketoglutaric acid, and transketolase. A lack of <b>thiamine</b> in the cells may therefore prevent neurons from maintaining necessary adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels as a result of impaired glycolosis. <b>Thiamine</b> deficiency alone could explain the impaired nerve conduction in those with alcoholic polyneuropathy, but other factors likely play a part.|$|E
25|$|In industrialized nations, <b>thiamine</b> {{deficiency}} is a {{clinically significant}} problem in individuals with chronic alcoholism or other disorders {{that interfere with}} normal ingestion of food. <b>Thiamine</b> deficiency within developed nations tends to manifest as Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome. Chronic alcoholism can disrupt thiamin absorption and thiamin deficiency contributes to neurodegeneration and memory loss in alcoholics known as Wernicke's encephalopathy. Individuals with chronic alcoholism may fall short on minimum daily requirements of <b>thiamine</b> {{in part due to}} anorexia, erratic eating habits, lack of available food, or a combination of any of these factors. <b>Thiamine</b> deficiency has been reported in up to 80% of alcoholic patients due to inadequate nutritional intake, reduced absorption, and impaired utilization of <b>thiamine.</b> Alcohol, in combination with its metabolite acetaldehyde, interacts with <b>thiamine</b> utilization at the molecular level during transport, diphosphorylation, and modification processes. For this reason, chronic alcoholics may have insufficient <b>thiamine</b> for maintenance of normal brain function, even with seemingly adequate dietary intake.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thiamine</b> and its acid {{metabolites}} (2-methyl-4-amino-5-pyrimidine carboxylic acid, 4-methyl-thiazole-5-acetic acid, and <b>thiamine</b> acetic acid) are excreted principally in the urine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thiamine</b> is used {{to treat}} <b>thiamine</b> {{deficiency}} which can prove fatal. In less-severe cases, nonspecific signs include malaise, weight loss, irritability and confusion.|$|E
25|$|Plant <b>thiamine</b> antagonists are {{heat-stable}} and {{occur as}} both the ortho- and para-hydroxyphenols. Some examples of these antagonists are caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and tannic acid. These compounds interact with the <b>thiamine</b> to oxidize the thiazole ring, thus rendering it unable to be absorbed. Two flavonoids, quercetin and rutin, have also been implicated as <b>thiamine</b> antagonists.|$|E
25|$|Uncooked bracken {{contains}} the enzyme thiaminase, which breaks down <b>thiamine.</b> Eating excessive quantities of bracken can cause beriberi, especially in creatures with simple stomachs. Ruminants are less vulnerable because they synthesize <b>thiamine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Complex <b>thiamine</b> {{biosynthesis}} {{occurs in}} bacteria, some protozoans, plants, and fungi. The thiazole and pyrimidine moieties are biosynthesized separately and then combined to form ThMP by {{the action of}} thiamine-phosphate synthase (EC 2.5.1.3). The biosynthetic pathways may differ among organisms. In E. coli and other enterobacteriaceae, ThMP may be phosphorylated to the cofactor ThDP by a thiamine-phosphate kinase (ThMP + ATP → ThDP + ADP, EC 2.7.4.16). In most bacteria and in eukaryotes, ThMP is hydrolyzed to <b>thiamine,</b> which may then be pyrophosphorylated to ThDP by <b>thiamine</b> diphosphokinase (<b>thiamine</b> + ATP → ThDP + AMP, EC 2.7.6.2).|$|E
25|$|Immediate {{treatment}} of Wernicke encephalopathy involves {{the administration of}} intravenous <b>thiamine,</b> followed with long-term treatment and prevention of the disorder through oral <b>thiamine</b> supplements, alcohol abstinence, and a balanced diet. Improvements in brain functioning of chronic alcoholics may occur with abstinence-related treatment, involving the discontinuation of alcohol consumption and improved nutrition. Wernicke's encephalopathy is life-threatening if left untreated. However, a rapid reversal of symptoms may result from prompt administration of <b>thiamine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Red {{blood cell}} {{transketolase}} activity is reduced in deficiency of <b>thiamine</b> (vitamin B1), {{and may be}} used in the diagnosis of Wernicke's encephalopathy and other B1-deficiency syndromes if the diagnosis is in doubt. Apart from the baseline enzyme activity (which may be normal even in deficiency states), acceleration of enzyme activity after the addition of <b>thiamine</b> pyrophosphate may be diagnostic of <b>thiamine</b> deficiency (0-15% normal, 15-25% deficiency, >25% severe deficiency).|$|E
25|$|The biosynthetic {{pathways}} {{are regulated}} by riboswitches. If {{there is sufficient}} <b>thiamine</b> present in the cell then the <b>thiamine</b> binds to the mRNAs for the enzymes that are required in the pathway and prevents their translation. If there is no <b>thiamine</b> present {{then there is no}} inhibition, and the enzymes required for the biosynthesis are produced. The specific riboswitch, the TPP riboswitch, is the only riboswitch identified in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms.|$|E
25|$|The first {{lipophilic}} <b>thiamine</b> derivative to {{be discovered}} was allithiamine, which was isolated from garlic (Allium sativum) in 1951. Allithiamine is an allyl disulfide derivative. After the discovery of allithiamine, several additional derivatives were synthesized {{with the hope that}} they would have better pharmacokinetic properties than <b>thiamine.</b> <b>Thiamine</b> is unable to diffuse across plasma membranes because it has a positively charged thiazole moiety. Instead, it must be transported across plasma membranes by high affinity carriers, and the rate of transport is low. Sulbutiamine overcomes the poor oral bioavailability of <b>thiamine</b> because it is highly lipophilic. The synthesis of sulbutiamine was reported by Taisho Pharmaceutical Co. in 1965.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} {{sulbutiamine}} is {{closely tied to}} the study of <b>thiamine</b> in Japan. A deficiency of <b>thiamine</b> causes a nervous system disorder called beriberi. Until the twentieth century, beriberi was prevalent in Japan and other Asian countries due to the widespread dependence on white rice as a staple food. The relationship between beriberi and diet was first noted by a navy surgeon named Takaki Kanehiro. Additional work resulted in the discovery of <b>thiamine,</b> which was isolated in 1926 and synthesized in 1936. The establishment of a Vitamin B Research Committee in Japan led to additional scientific investigation into the properties of <b>thiamine</b> and its derivatives.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thiamine</b> {{tetrahydrofurfuryl}} disulfide (TTFD) is {{hypothesized to}} act as a chelating agent in children with autism. A 2002 pilot study administered TTFD rectally to ten autism spectrum children, and found beneficial clinical effect. This study has not been replicated, and a 2006 review of <b>thiamine</b> by the same author did not mention thiamine's possible effect on autism. There is not sufficient evidence to support the use of <b>thiamine</b> (vitamin B1) to treat autism.|$|E
25|$|Ingesting a diet rich in <b>thiamine</b> may {{stave off}} the adverse effects of deficiency. Foods {{providing}} rich sources of <b>thiamine</b> include unrefined grain products, ready-to-eat cereals, meat (especially pork), dairy products, peanuts, legumes, fruits and eggs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thiamine</b> {{is found}} {{in a wide variety}} of {{processed}} and whole foods, with edible seeds, legumes, rice and processed foods, such as breakfast cereals, having among the highest contents. Some other foods naturally rich in <b>thiamine</b> are cornflour, pork, and spinach.|$|E
25|$|Side {{effects are}} {{generally}} few. Allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur. <b>Thiamine</b> {{is in the}} B complex family. It is needed for the metabolism of carbohydrates. As people are unable to make it, <b>thiamine</b> is an essential nutrient. Food sources include whole grains, meat, and fish.|$|E
25|$|Fortification {{of flour}} is practiced in some {{countries}} to replace the <b>thiamine</b> lost during processing. However, this method {{has been criticized for}} missing the target population of chronic alcoholics, who are most at risk for deficiency. Alternative solutions have suggested the fortification of alcoholic beverages with <b>thiamine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Alcoholism is {{normally}} associated with nutritional deficiencies, which {{may contribute to}} the development of alcoholic polyneuropathy. <b>Thiamine,</b> vitamin B-12, and folic acid are vitamins that play an essential role in the peripheral and central nervous system and should be among the first analyzed in laboratory tests. It has been difficult to assess <b>thiamine</b> status in individuals due to difficulties in developing a method to directly assay <b>thiamine</b> in the blood and urine. A liver function test may also be ordered, as alcoholic consumption may cause an increase in liver enzyme levels.|$|E
25|$|In Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, {{while no}} {{mutations}} could be demonstrated, {{there is an}} indication that <b>thiamine</b> deficiency leads to Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome only in those whose transketolase has a reduced affinity for <b>thiamine.</b> In this way, the activity of transketolase is greatly hindered, and, as a consequence, the entire pentose phosphate pathway is inhibited.|$|E
25|$|Adenosine <b>thiamine</b> {{triphosphate}} (AThTP) or thiaminylated {{adenosine triphosphate}} {{has recently been}} discovered in Escherichia coli, where it accumulates {{as a result of}} carbon starvation. In E. coli, AThTP may account for up to 20% of total <b>thiamine.</b> It also exists in lesser amounts in yeast, roots of higher plants and animal tissue.|$|E
25|$|Well-known syndromes {{caused by}} <b>thiamine</b> {{deficiency}} include beriberi, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, and optic neuropathy.|$|E
25|$|Clinical {{signs of}} B1 {{deficiency}} include mental {{changes such as}} apathy, decrease in short-term memory, confusion, and irritability. Moderate deficiency in <b>thiamine</b> may reduce growth in young populations, in increase chronic illness in both young and middle-aged adults. In addition, moderate deficiency of <b>thiamine</b> may increase rates of depression, dementia, falls, and fractures in old age.|$|E
25|$|High {{doses of}} <b>thiamine</b> often by the {{intravenous}} route is also recommended.|$|E
