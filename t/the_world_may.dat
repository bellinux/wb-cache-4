5|$|Internal realism was {{the view}} that, {{although}} <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>may</b> be causally {{independent of the}} human mind, {{the structure of the}} world—its division into kinds, individuals and categories—is a function of the human mind, and hence the world is not ontologically independent. The general idea is influenced by Kant's idea of the dependence of our knowledge of the world on the categories of thought.|$|E

25|$|The modern {{strain of}} snow white tigers came from {{repeated}} brother–sister matings of Bhim and Sumita at Cincinnati Zoo. The gene involved {{may have come}} from a Siberian tiger, via their part-Siberian ancestor Tony. Continued inbreeding appears to have caused a recessive gene for stripelessness to show up. About one fourth of Bhim and Sumita's offspring were stripeless. Their striped white offspring, which have been sold to zoos around <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>may</b> also carry the stripeless gene. Because Tony's genome is present in many white tiger pedigrees, the gene may also be present in other captive white tigers. As a result, stripeless white tigers have appeared in zoos as far afield as the Czech Republic (Liberec), Spain and Mexico. Stage magicians Siegfried & Roy were the first to attempt to selectively breed tigers for stripelessness; they owned snow-white Bengal tigers taken from Cincinnati Zoo (Tsumura, Mantra, Mirage and Akbar-Kabul) and Guadalajara, Mexico (Vishnu and Jahan), as well as a stripeless Siberian tiger called Apollo.|$|E
25|$|These {{two broad}} {{categories}} may be further subdivided. Patients with egocentric neglect may ignore the stimuli leftward of their trunks, their heads, or their retinae. Those with allocentric neglect may neglect the true left of a presented object, or may first correct in their mind's eye a slanted or inverted object and then neglect the side then interpreted as {{being on the}} left. So, for example, if patients are presented with an upside-down photograph of a face, they may mentally flip the object right side up and then neglect {{the left side of}} the adjusted image. In another example, if patients are presented with a barbell, patients will more significantly neglect {{the left side of the}} barbell, as expected with right temporal lobe lesion. If the barbell is rotated such that the left side is now on the right side, patients will more significantly neglect the left side of the object, even though it is now on the right side of space. This also occurs with slanted or mirror-image presentations. A patient looking at a mirror image of a map of <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>may</b> neglect to see the Western Hemisphere despite their inverted placement onto the right side of the map.|$|E
