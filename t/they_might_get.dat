During a limited time (between 11:00AM and 2:00AM), users could download games and save them on a memory card that plugged into the BS-X cartridge. Players could also peruse news announcements and advertisements that were updated in real time. With marketers emphasizing communal and real-time aspects of Satellaview programming, {{efforts were made to}} provide players with an approximation of a multiplayer experience. To accomplish this, Nintendo sponsored numerous events and competitions in which players would compete in quizzes and challenges to achieve high scores, and also {{at the end of each}} game users would receive a score readout.

25|$|On Friday 15 October 1926 his HRH The Prince of Wales visited Halifax. It {{was another}} of several visits the Royal Family made to Halifax during Richardson's time in office. Richardson {{continued}} {{to establish his}} reputation of being a good Organiser and Planner. He prepared the Borough Police by devising a booklet of 28 pages. It shows, in detail, {{the route of the}} cars taking part, crowd control, Sergeants in charge of Sections, mounted police positions, roads to be blocked off and timings – to the minute. Everyone taking part had a copy of the booklet so every Policeman on duty knew not only {{what they had to do}} but what other Policemen had to do as well. It had the signature of A.H. Richardson on the cover to prove it was genuine and all copies had to be returned immediately the visit was over. Copies were later sent to other Chief Constables as a template for any Royal Visit <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>get.</b>|$|E
500|$|On September 12, {{the explorers}} {{resigned}} themselves to wintering {{on the ice}} and camped on a large floe, letting the ice take them where it would, [...] "which", writes Kjellström, [...] "it had really been doing all along" [...] (p.47). Drifting rapidly due south towards Kvitøya, they hurriedly built a winter [...] "home" [...] on the floe against the increasing cold, with walls made of water-reinforced snow to Strindberg's design (see plan, below, left). Observing the rapidity of their drift, Andrée recorded his hopes that <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> far enough south to feed themselves entirely from the sea. However, the floe began to break up directly under the hut on October 2 from the stresses of pressing against Kvitøya, and they were forced to bring their stores on to the island itself, which took a couple of days. [...] "Morale remains good", reports Andrée {{at the very end of}} the coherent part of his diary, which ends: [...] "Med sådana kamrater bör man kunna reda sig under snart sagdt hvilka omständigheter som helst." [...] ("With such comrades one should be able to manage under, I may say, any circumstances".) It is inferred from the incoherent and badly damaged last pages of Andrée's diary that the three men were all dead within a few days of moving onto the island.|$|E

While the SLS was designed to connect {{with one of the}} other transcontinentals, its primary purpose lay in 19th-century industrial development exploiting the city's hinterland: the fast-disappearing easy timber, then primarily coal and iron. A theory, which later became profitable in fact, was that commuter trains could run along the SLS track, and be only twenty scenic minutes away {{from the center of the}} city. Ever since, every suburb around the perimeter of the city has been advertised as only [...] "twenty scenic minutes away from downtown." ...|$|E

2500|$|Later in Scandinavian folklore, trolls become {{defined as}} a {{particular}} type of being. Numerous tales are recorded about trolls in which they are frequently described as being extremely old, very strong, but slow and dim-witted, and are at times described as man-eaters and as turning to stone upon contact with sunlight. However, trolls are also attested as looking much the same as human beings, without any particularly hideous appearance about them, but living far away from human habitation and generally having [...] "some form of social organization" [...] — unlike the rå and näck, who are attested as [...] "solitary beings". According to John Lindow, what sets them apart is that they are not Christian, and those who encounter them do not know them. Therefore, trolls were in the end dangerous, regardless of how well <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> along with Christian society, and trolls display a habit of bergtagning ('kidnapping'; literally [...] "mountain-taking") and overrunning a farm or estate.|$|E
2500|$|When Sammartino {{was about}} 51 years old, he was {{involved}} in a backstage fight with a former football player. Six men were backstage at a wrestling show in an area that was restricted, and when Sammartino spotted the men, he told them that if security saw them in this area, <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> in trouble. Dave [...] "Rooster" [...] Fleming, a former CFL player with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, stuck his hand out to Sammartino. When Sammartino went to shake his hand, Fleming began to squeeze hard, and Sammartino asked him what he was doing, to which Fleming replied, [...] "You're nothing but a washed up old man". Sammartino responded, [...] "Not too washed up to take care of you". Upon hearing that, Fleming took a swing at Sammartino, but Sammartino blocked it and knocked him down with a punch. Sammartino soon found himself fighting the other five men at once. At this time, The Iron Sheik was in the showers after his match and heard the commotion. He immediately jumped in next to Sammartino and the two wrestlers proceeded to [...] "clean house".|$|E
2500|$|After their Euro {{tour and}} the Cannes beach {{performance}} the band {{returned to the}} US. Moves were already {{in the air for}} them to leave Buddah and sign to MGM and, prior to their May tour – mainly in the UK – they re-recorded some Buddah material of the partial Mirror Man sessions at Sunset Sound with Bruce Botnick. Beefheart had also been conceptualizing new band names, including 25th Century Quaker and Blue Thumb, while making suggestions to other musicians that <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> involved. The thought-process of 25th Century Quaker was {{that it would be a}} [...] "blues band" [...] alias for the more avant-garde work of the Magic Band. Photographer Guy Webster actually photographed the band in Quaker-style outfits, and the picture appears in The Mirror Man Sessions CD insert. It would later transpire that much of this situation was transient and that Buddah's Bob Krasnow was to set up his own label. The label that was unsurprisingly named Blue Thumb launched with its first release Strictly Personal, a truncated version of the original Beefheart vision of a double album. Thus [...] "25th Century Quaker" [...] became a track and a potential band-name became a label.|$|E

2500|$|A {{number of}} Jews who {{had formed a}} party against Muhammad, {{including}} Sallam b. Abu'l-Huqayq, Kenana ibn al-Rabi and Huyayy b. Akhtab, the chiefs of Nadir {{who had gone to}} Khaybar, together with two chiefs from the tribe of B. Wa'ili went to Quraysh and invited them to form a coalition against Muhammad so that <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> rid of him altogether. Then they persuaded the tribe of Ghaftan to join the battle against Muhammad. Banu Nadir promised half the date harvest of Khaybar to nomadic tribes if they would join the battle against Muslims. Abu Sufyan, the military leader of Quraysh, with the financial help of Banu Nadir had mustered a force of size 10,000 men. Muhammad was able to prepare a force of about 3000 men. He had however adopted a new form of defense, unknown in Arabia at that time: Muslims had dug a trench wherever Medina lay open to cavalry attack. The idea is credited to a Persian convert to Islam, Salman the Persian. The siege of Medina began on March 31, 627 and lasted for two weeks. Abu Sufyan's troops were unprepared for the fortifications they were confronted with, and after an ineffectual siege lasting several weeks, the coalition decided to go home. The Qur'an discusses this battle in verses Qur'an [...]|$|E
