60|$|Elvira, on {{the other}} hand, sang her {{patriotic}} and romantic songs with more than usual expression; her voice had charm and plangency; and as Leon looked at her, in her low-bodied maroon dress, with her arms bare to the shoulder, and a red flower set provocatively in her corset, he repeated to himself for <b>the</b> many <b>hundredth</b> <b>time</b> that {{she was one of}} the loveliest creatures in the world of women.|$|R
60|$|As the Captain, with a dejected face, stood {{revolving}} these thoughts, {{and polishing}} the Midshipman, partly in the tenderness of old acquaintance, and partly {{in the absence}} of his mind, a knocking at the shop-door communicated a frightful start to the frame of Rob the Grinder, seated on the counter, whose large eyes had been intently fixed on the Captain's face, and who had been debating within himself, for <b>the</b> five <b>hundredth</b> <b>time,</b> whether <b>the</b> Captain could have done a murder, that he had such an evil conscience, and was always running away.|$|R

"As {{their own}} natural {{attitude}} towards society is being shattered, {{as they are}} exposed to its sheer power, these elements have no time to choose and decide, for they are engulfed by the avalanche, which drags them without asking what it is they want or not. Confronted with the necessity of making a immediate decision, they are not able to analyze or search - for <b>the</b> one <b>hundredth</b> <b>time</b> - deep inside their meticulously developed reasoning, with respect to their interests, caprices and desires, regarding the injustice suffered in the hands of others. At the same time obeying the emotional suggestion of the collective, their ideas burst into several representations, but {{no more than a few}} manage becoming consistent before the new images are formed, images of the righteousness and greater strength of the group, palpable deeds of their own belonging to the collective, the first elements of pride and initial sensations of sweet victory."

60|$|It was a Sunday {{evening in}} October, and {{in common with}} many other young ladies of her class, Katharine Hilbery was pouring out tea. Perhaps a fifth part of her mind was thus occupied, and the {{remaining}} parts leapt over the little barrier of day which interposed between Monday morning and this rather subdued moment, and played with the things one does voluntarily and normally in the daylight. But although she was silent, she was evidently mistress of a situation which was familiar enough to her, and inclined to let it take its way for <b>the</b> six <b>hundredth</b> <b>time,</b> perhaps, without bringing into play any of her unoccupied faculties. A single glance was enough to show that Mrs. Hilbery was so rich in the gifts which make tea-parties of elderly distinguished people successful, that she scarcely needed any help from her daughter, provided that the tiresome business of teacups and bread and butter was discharged for her.|$|R

60|$|MY DEAR MOTHER,--I am {{too happy}} to {{be much of a}} correspondent. Yesterday we were away to Melford and Lavenham, both {{exceptionally}} placid, beautiful old English towns. Melford scattered all round a big green, with an Elizabethan Hall and Park, great screens of trees that seem twice as high as trees should seem, and everything else like what ought to be in a novel, and what one never expects to see in reality, made me cry out how good we were to live in Scotland, for <b>the</b> many <b>hundredth</b> <b>time.</b> I cannot get over my astonishment--indeed, it increases every day--at the hopeless gulf that there is between England and Scotland, and English and Scotch. Nothing is the same; and I feel as strange and outlandish here as I do in France or Germany. Everything by the wayside, in the houses, or about the people, strikes me with an unexpected unfamiliarity: I walk among surprises, for just where you think you have them, something wrong turns up.|$|R
6000|$|Well, {{when the}} priest had been droning for three hours, {{and the good}} king {{polishing}} the evidences, and the sick were still pressing forward as plenty as ever, I got to feeling intolerably bored. I was sitting by an open window {{not far from the}} canopy of state. For <b>the</b> five <b>hundredth</b> <b>time</b> a patient stood forward to have his repulsivenesses stroked; again those words were being droned out: [...] "they shall lay their hands on the sick"--when outside there rang clear as a clarion a note that enchanted my soul and tumbled thirteen worthless centuries about my ears: [...] "Camelot Weekly Hosannah and Literary Volcano!--latest irruption--only two cents --all about the big miracle in the Valley of Holiness!" [...] One greater than kings had arrived--the newsboy. But I was the only person in all that throng who knew the meaning of this mighty birth, and what this imperial magician was come into the world to do.|$|R
500|$|On 11 January {{they set}} out. For the next 48 hours they {{struggled}} over hostile terrain, through regions of deep crevasses and treacherous snowfields. They soon parted company {{with all their}} equipment and supplies. At one point, to proceed, they had to ascend to [...] and then slide {{to the foot of}} a snow-slope. Eventually, after stumbling around in the fog for hours, they fortunately encountered Bernard Day, a member of the shore party, a short distance from the hut. The ship later recovered the abandoned equipment. John King Davis, then serving as Nimrod's chief officer, remarked that [...] "Mackintosh was always the man to take <b>the</b> <b>hundredth</b> chance. This <b>time</b> he got away with it." ...|$|R

60|$|Good heavens! What {{do people}} mean by going there? What is done there, that {{everybody}} throngs into those three little rooms? Was the Black Hole {{considered to be}} an agreeable REUNION, that Britons in the dog-days here seek to imitate it? After being rammed to a jelly in a door-way (where you feel your feet going through Lady Barbara Macbeth's lace flounces, and get a look from that haggard and painted old harpy, compared to which the gaze of Ugolino is quite cheerful); after withdrawing your elbow out of poor gasping Bob Guttleton's white waistcoat, from which cushion it was impossible to remove it, though you knew you were squeezing poor Bob into an apoplexy--you find yourself at last in the reception-room, and try to catch the eye of Mrs. Botibol, the CONVERSAZIONE-giver. When you catch her eye, you are expected to grin, and she smiles too, for <b>the</b> four <b>hundredth</b> <b>time</b> that night; and, if she's very glad to see you, waggles her little hand before her face as if to blow you a kiss, as the phrase is.|$|R
5000|$|Critical {{reception}} for The Rescue of Princess Blobette {{has been relatively}} positive. Computer and Video Games praised the game as being addictive and fun, and recommended it to players who want something original and {{have a lot of}} time on their hands. Nintendo Power echoed these comments, adding that it is challenging to both novice players and players who have already mastered the original A Boy and His Blob. Ed Griffiths of Nintendojo felt the game's graphics and sound to be very plain, but found gameplay mix of puzzles and exploration satisfying for first time players. Griffiths summarized, [...] "It's short and it's not as much fun <b>the</b> second (or <b>hundredth)</b> <b>time</b> through, but this game is still a keeper. It's thoroughly enjoyable while it lasts, and its unique gameplay gives it a well-deserved cult classic status. Still, there are other games out there that'll give you more bang for your buck." [...] 1UP.com writer Ray Barnholt, who is familiar with the original A Boy and His Blob, was thoroughly unimpressed with The Rescue of Princess Blobette. Barnholt disliked the limited room to move, the ability of the blob to accidentally push the boy into a deadly trap, and no way to save one's progress.|$|R
