Boehm was a flautist who created the key system that is now used for the <b>transverse</b> <b>flute.</b> Klosé and Buffet applied Boehm's system to the clarinet. Although the credit goes to those people, Boehm's name was given to that key system because {{it was based on}} that used for flute.|$|E
5|$|The baroque alto {{recorder}} (blockflöte in German) {{enjoyed a}} period of popularity in Europe as an orchestral instrument in the seventeenth century, starting with Monteverdi in his opera L'Orfeo. By {{the middle of the}} eighteenth century it had been displaced by the <b>transverse</b> <b>flute.</b> In France the transition was more marked, since cultural life centred on Paris; it was more gradual in Germany, made up of many separate principalities, all with their own court or municipal musicians. The baroque recorder was used in orchestral music in association with death and the supernatural; to express tenderness; in pastoral scenes (as the shepherd's pipe); and to imitate bird song.|$|E
25|$|On a <b>transverse</b> <b>flute</b> this is {{generally}} done by narrowing the lip/embouchure. Since {{the size and}} direction of the tin whistle's windway is fixed, like that of the recorder or fipple flute, it is necessary to increase the velocity of the air stream. (See overblowing).|$|E

25|$|During the Baroque period, the <b>transverse</b> <b>flute</b> was redesigned. Now {{often called}} the traverso (from the Italian), it was made {{in three or four}} {{sections}} or joints with a conical bore from the head joint down. The conical bore design gave the flute a wider range and more penetrating sound without sacrificing the softer, expressive qualities. In addition to chamber music, the traverso began to be used in orchestral music.|$|E
25|$|Frederick was {{a patron}} {{of music as}} well as a gifted {{musician}} who played the <b>transverse</b> <b>flute.</b> He composed more than 100 sonatas for the flute as well as four symphonies. The Hohenfriedberger Marsch, a military march, was supposedly written by Frederick to commemorate his victory in the Battle of Hohenfriedberg during the Second Silesian War. His court musicians included C. P. E. Bach, Johann Joachim Quantz, Carl Heinrich Graun and Franz Benda. A meeting with Johann Sebastian Bach in 1747 in Potsdam led to Bach's writing The Musical Offering.|$|E
25|$|In the Baroque era, flutes become used in {{the scores}} of opera, ballet and chamber music. With this, composers wrote music for the flute. These {{included}} Praetorius, Schütz, Rebillé and Descoteaux, Quantz, Bach, Telemann, Blavet, Vivaldi, and Handel. Because {{of the works of}} such composers, the flute became popular as a solo instrument. However, there were few professional flutists who had the flute as their main instrument; many had the oboe. In 1707, Jacques Martin Hotteterre wrote the first method book on playing the flute: Principes de la flûte traversière. The 1730s brought an increase in operatic and chamber music feature of flutes. The end of this era found the publication of Essay of a Method of Playing the <b>Transverse</b> <b>Flute</b> by Quantz, considered the greatest exposition on flute method of its time.|$|E

25|$|Many {{instruments}} originated {{during the}} Renaissance; others were variations of, or improvements upon, instruments that had existed previously. Some have survived {{to the present}} day; others have disappeared, only to be recreated in order to perform music of the period on authentic instruments. As in the modern day, instruments may be classified as brass, strings, percussion, and woodwind. Brass instruments in the Renaissance were traditionally played by professionals {{who were members of}} Guilds and they included the slide trumpet, the wooden cornet, the valveless trumpet and the sackbut. Stringed instruments included the viol, the harp-like lyre, the hurdy-gurdy, the cittern and the lute. Keyboard instruments with strings included the harpsichord and the virginals. Percussion instruments include the triangle, the Jew's harp, the tambourine, the bells, the rumble-pot, and various kinds of drums. Woodwind instruments included the double reed shawm, the reed pipe, the bagpipe, the <b>transverse</b> <b>flute</b> and the recorder. Vocal music in the Renaissance is noted for the flourishing of an increasingly elaborate polyphonic style. The principal liturgical forms which endured throughout the entire Renaissance period were masses and motets, with some other developments towards the end, especially as composers of sacred music began to adopt secular forms (such as the madrigal) for their own designs. Towards the end of the period, the early dramatic precursors of opera such as monody, the madrigal comedy, and the intermedio are seen.|$|E
500|$|The aria for alto and an obbligato oboe, [...] "" [...] (God is our sun and shield!), expresses similar {{ideas as}} the first {{movement}} in a personal way, described as [...] "tranquil and individual" [...] by Mincham.

500|$|The tenor aria, [...] "" [...] (Ah, draw my soul with skeins of love), is {{accompanied}} by the <b>transverse</b> <b>flute,</b> probably played by the flauto piccolo player of the first movement.

Some musicologists think that he was Friedrich Gottlieb Wild, a law student.|$|E
25|$|The flute {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} and most widely used wind instruments. The {{precursors}} of the modern concert flute were keyless wooden <b>transverse</b> <b>flutes</b> similar to modern fifes. These were later modified to include between one and eight keys for chromatic notes.|$|R

5|$|Bach {{scored the}} work for three vocal soloists (soprano (S), alto (A) and tenor (T)), a four-part choir, and a Baroque {{instrumental}} ensemble: two <b>transverse</b> <b>flutes</b> (Ft), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), and basso continuo.

500|$|A <b>transverse</b> <b>flute</b> {{accompanies the}} tenor {{voice in the}} aria [...] "" [...] (Be lively now, your Savior knocks). The {{knocking}} is expressed in repeated notes. Throughout the movement, a motif identified by Albert Schweitzer as a joy motif pictures an [...] "almost breathless expression of personal euphoria". The demanding flute part was probably composed for the excellent flute player for whom Bach first wrote {{a few weeks earlier}} in , and then in other cantatas during the fall of 1724.|$|E
500|$|Bach {{created the}} work {{as part of his}} second annual cantata cycle when he was Thomaskantor (director of music) in Leipzig. That cycle was planned as a cycle of the chorale cantatas for all {{occasions}} of the liturgical year. [...] is based on a hymn of penitence by Johannes Gigas (1561). An unknown poet kept three stanzas in their original form, which Bach set as an opening chorale fantasia, a central fourth movement with the soprano accompanied only by the continuo, and a four-part closing chorale as movement 7. The poet reworded the other stanzas as arias and recitatives, including references to the prescribed gospel about the healing of a man with dropsy. Bach scored the cantata for four vocal parts, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of a horn to reinforce the chorale tune, a <b>transverse</b> <b>flute,</b> 2 oboes, strings and continuo.|$|E
500|$|The hymn, {{related to}} mysticism and {{comparing}} Jesus to the Morning star, matches {{two aspects of}} the prescribed gospel for the Sunday, the Great Commandment and a theological dispute about the term [...] "Son of David". An unknown poet kept {{the first and last}} stanza for the first and last movement of the cantata, and paraphrased the inner stanzas as four movements, alternating recitative and aria. Bach set the first stanza as a chorale fantasia with the cantus firmus in the alto, adding sparkle by a [...] "dancing" [...] soprano and the illumination of a sopranino, which he used {{for the first time in}} his cantatas. In the four inner movements, all four vocal parts have their solo. A tenor aria is accompanied by an obbligato <b>transverse</b> <b>flute,</b> a part written for a virtuoso player. A bass aria is accompanied by an oboe and strings, acting as in a Venetian concerto. The cantata is closed with a simple four-part setting of the hymn tune. Bach performed the cantata again in later years, with minor changes to the scoring.|$|E
50|$|Its {{repertoire}} {{consists of}} {{pieces from the}} oral tradition of the popular galician music, especially arranged for the group by the members themselves, mainly {{the heads of the}} different sections, which include galician bagpipes, percussion, hurdy-gurdys, fiddles, requintas (traditional galician <b>transverse</b> <b>flutes),</b> vocals, harps and plucked strings.|$|R
5|$|At the Leipzig {{performances}} of the cantata, the first verse of the chorale was probably sung by a soprano, instead of using an instrumental rendition of the chorale tune in the first aria.

2500|$|During the 16th {{and early}} 17th centuries in Europe, the <b>transverse</b> <b>flute</b> was {{available}} in several sizes, in effect forming a consort {{in much the same}} way recorders and other instruments were used in consorts.

2500|$|He {{is often}} {{credited}} with introducing new instruments into the orchestra, but this legend needs closer scrutiny.

2500|$|Throughout the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries, {{transverse}} flutes {{were very}} uncommon in Europe, with the recorder being more prominent. The <b>transverse</b> <b>flute</b> arrived in Europe from Asia via the Byzantine Empire, where it migrated to Germany and France. These flutes {{became known as}} [...] "German flutes" [...] to distinguish them from others, such as the recorder. The flute became used in court music, along with the viol, and was used in secular music, although only in France and Germany. It would not spread {{to the rest of}} Europe for nearly a century. The first literary appearance of the <b>transverse</b> <b>flute</b> was made in 1285 by Adenet le Roi in a list of instruments he played. After this, a period of 70 years ensues, where there are few references to the flute.|$|E

25|$|Usually in D, wooden <b>transverse</b> <b>flutes</b> {{were played}} in European {{classical}} music {{mainly in the}} period from the early 18th century to the early 19th century.
