50|$|The V6 {{engine is}} fitted with four {{overhead}} camshafts driven by synchronous tooth belts. It has a single, long, serpentine belt {{at the front}} driving the inlet cams and also the coolant pump. The exhaust cams are driven by short link belts driven from {{the ends of the}} inlet cams {{at the rear of the}} engine. The system was a joint development between Dayco (belt supplier) and Rover.The rear link belts do not incorporate any tensioning device. Belt tension is maintained by very careful control of belt length and the pulley pair is pre-tensioned during fitting. The front belt drive is tensioned by a spring-loaded <b>tensioner</b> <b>pulley</b> incorporating a hydraulic damping element.|$|E
50|$|Some drill presses {{and milling}} {{machines}} contain a pulley-based CVT where the output shaft has {{a pair of}} manually adjustable conical pulley halves through which a wide drive belt from the motor loops. The pulley on the motor, however, is usually fixed in diameter, or may {{have a series of}} given-diameter steps to allow a selection of speed ranges. A handwheel on the drill press, marked with a scale corresponding to the desired machine speed, is mounted to a reduction gearing system for the operator to precisely control the width of the gap between the pulley halves. This gap width thus adjusts the gearing ratio between the motor's fixed pulley and the output shaft's variable pulley, changing speed of the chuck. A <b>tensioner</b> <b>pulley</b> is implemented in the belt transmission to take up or release the slack in the belt as the speed is altered. In most cases, the speed must be changed with the motor running.|$|E

Belt is {{considered}} elastic continuous element, and pulley and tensioner arm are discrete element. Considering the geometrical nonlinearity and Kelvin viscoelastic constitutive model, the kinetic energy, potential energy and work done by external forces of moving belt system with <b>tensioner</b> <b>pulley</b> are given respectively. Then, the nonlinear equations of motion for the moving viscoelastic belt system with <b>tensioner</b> <b>pulley</b> are obtained by using the Hamilton’s principle. Note that nonlinear oscillations of the belt and pulley oscillations are coupled...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{the past}} decade the {{applicability}} of belt-drives has been extended significantly due to their increased reliability. With automotive engines it is now common to join {{a large number of}} belt-drives into a single, long belt-drive with several <b>tensioner</b> <b>pulleys.</b> However, these belt-drives can exhibit complex dynamic behaviors; therefore {{it is very important to}} predict the dynamics response of such systems using validated numerical models. The aim of this paper is to perform the validation of a developed belt-drive model. The validation of this belt-drive model was performed using a two-pulley belt-drive. The numerically obtained results are compared with experimental data under various operational conditions. Finally, the applicability of the belt-drive model is presented by simulating a serpentine belt-drive, considering non-steady, belt-drive operational conditions...|$|R
50|$|The {{recommended}} timing belt interval for these engines is every 50,000 miles, or earlier if {{the engine is}} modified. It is also recommended to replace the crank and camshaft seals at every interval and to thoroughly inspect the <b>tensioner</b> and idler <b>pulleys</b> for wear.|$|R

40|$|Serpentine {{belt drive}} systems {{are widely used}} in {{automobiles}} due to their compactness and long life. These systems are composed of a belt, a driving pulley, driven pulleys, and a spring-loaded <b>tensioner.</b> The driven <b>pulleys</b> may include such accessories as the alternator, air conditioner, or power steering pump. Serpentine belt drives experience {{many different types of}} steady state motions and transient vibrations due to the different parameters in the system. As a result of this, it is important to create a mathematical model that allows the designer to extract information about the system such as the natural frequency and the mode shapes. The accuracy of the model will depend primarily on the assumptions used. In particular, a key assumption is whether transverse and rotational motions of the belt are coupled due to the motion of the automatic belt tensioner. This coupling is often neglected by authors who model only longitudinal belt response and in effect decouple the transverse and rotational motions. Using a solution based upon coupled motion as well as a solution employing rotational motion only, the importance of this coupling will be assessed. Both solution results will be compared against published experimental data. In addition, a parametric study will be performed to determine the ability of the coupled and decoupled models to accurately predict changes in system natural frequencies and mode shapes due to changes in system parameters...|$|R
40|$|M. Tech. Mechanical EngineeringThe {{maintenance}} and operational costs for light aircraft have escalated {{to such an}} extent, {{that it has become}} financially very difficult to obtain and maintain a private pilot’s licence. Furthermore, the engine technology of light aircraft engines dates back to pre - 1962, which means the fuel consumption is unfavorable when compared to modern automotive engines. The use of modern automotive engine technology such as multipoint fuel injection, hot-wire air induction sensors, electronic ignition and knock control, can improve the performance, while reducing the operating and maintenance costs of light aircraft significantly. The aviation legislation in South Africa makes provision for this modification, on a noncommercial basis under the category LS/ 1 - type, for aircraft that need not qualify for a certificate of airworthiness. This dissertation describes how an utomotive engine was selected and converted for operation in a light aircraft. Emphasis was put on mass saving. After evaluating a number of automotive engines regarding availability, power to weight ratio and the cost of some spare parts, the Opel 200 iS engine was favoured. This engine develops a power of 95 kW at 5600 rev/min and a torque of 180 Nm at 4600 rev/min at sea level conditions. It was then tested and evaluated on a dynamometer on both automotive fuel as well as aviation gasoline. The decrease in power with increase in altitude up to 4000 m was also investigated. The power, torque and fuel consumption were then compared to that of the existing aircraft engine, which is a Continental O- 200 -A rated at 75 kW at 2750 rev/min at sea level. The aircraft for which this engine conversion was developed is a two seater Cessna 150 trainer aircraft with a gross weight of 715 kg and a top speed of 195 km/h at sea level. It has a service ceiling of 3962 m (13000 feet). Modifications which were made to the automotive engine includes moving the distributor to a different position, modifying the cooling and exhaust systems and converting the alternator for a vacuum supply for flight instruments. Furthermore, a reduction drive to couple a propeller onto the automotive engine was designed, manufactured and evaluated. An 8 -mm pitch High Torque Drive (HTD) synchronous belt was chosen for this reduction drive. The width of the belt is 116 mm and it runs over two aluminium pulleys of diameters 95, 39 mm and 187, 07 mm with their centers 332, 8 mm apart. This belt is used to reduce the maximum operational engine speed from 5200 rev/min to a propeller speed of 2700 rev/min, and to increase the engine output torque from 170 Nm to 310 Nm at the propeller. The need for a belt tensioner arose whilst the evaluations were done on the dynamometer. A rotating adjustable <b>pulley</b> <b>tensioner</b> was designed and installed onto the reduction drive, which proved to arrest any belt flutter as required. Endurance tests conducted with the complete adapted engine and reduction drive on the dynamometer provided excellent results. With this study, it was proved beyond any doubt that a modern automotive engine {{could be used as a}} reliable, cheaper and more economical alternative power supply to propel a light aircraft...|$|R
