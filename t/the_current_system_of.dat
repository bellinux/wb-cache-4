5|$|The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), a New Deal relief {{agency for}} young men, {{played a major}} role between 1933 and 1942 in {{developing}} Yellowstone facilities. CCC projects included reforestation, campground development of many of the park's trails and campgrounds, trail construction, fire hazard reduction, and fire-fighting work. The CCC built the majority of the early visitor centers, campgrounds and <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>system</b> <b>of</b> park roads.|$|E
5|$|By 1916, the Great War {{had been}} ongoing {{for almost two}} years, during which anarchists had taken part in anti-war {{movements}} across Europe, issuing numerous anti-war statements in anarchist and leftist publications. In February 1915, a statement was issued by an assembly of anarchists from various regions, including England, Switzerland, Italy, the United States, Russia, France, and the Netherlands. The document was signed by such figures as Domela Nieuwenhuis, Emma Goldman, Alexander Berkman, Luigi Bertoni, Saul Yanovsky, Harry Kelly, Thomas Keell, Lilian Wolfe, Rudolf Rocker, and George Barrett. It was also endorsed by Errico Malatesta and Alexander Schapiro, two of three secretaries elected to their position at the Anarchist International of 1907. It set out several viewpoints, including that all wars {{were the result of}} <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>system</b> <b>of</b> society, and therefore not the blame of any particular government; did not regard a defensive and offensive war as being fundamentally distinctly different; and encouraged all anarchists to support only class conflict and the liberation of oppressed populaces as a means by which to resolve wars between nation-states.|$|E

5000|$|The {{basic idea}} of the Flexible Land Tenure System is to {{establish}} an interchangeable tenure registration system parallel and complementary to <b>the</b> <b>current</b> formal <b>system</b> <b>of</b> freehold tenure.

5|$|Public Act51 of 1951 amended and {{clarified}} <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>system</b> <b>of</b> {{jurisdiction over}} {{roads in the}} state. The existing tri-level system was maintained, splitting road jurisdiction between the state, counties and cities, as well as subdividing each level into several classifications. Further legislation redefined the exact distribution, but Act51 {{set up a system}} to distribute road funding from gas taxes from a single funding source, currently the Michigan Transportation Fund. Funding was increased during the 1950s as the fuel taxes were increased. Whereas those revenues during the war dropped to levels barely sufficient to keep existing highways in usable condition, they were increased during the following decade to deal with increasing traffic. The state highway department was also authorized to sell bonds to provide funding for the proposed road improvements.|$|E

30|$|The {{approach}} {{taken by}} this study i.e. {{looking at the}} situation at the downstream levels {{as opposed to the}} national level was deemed appropriate owing to <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> governance in Kenya (Thugge et al. 2011; Wiesmann et al. 2014). In particular, the implementation of environmental conservation and agricultural policies, among other key directives, have been largely decentralized to the sub-national levels of administration. Thus, adaptation constraints such as poor road networks and limited value addition options for agricultural output can easily be dealt with at the sub-national levels (Wiesmann et al. 2014).|$|R

25|$|Eva Funke {{analyses}} {{the description}} of the Inca state as a utopian bourgeois society in the third volume as a critique of Campe’s contemporary society. Thus the description <b>of</b> the ruling <b>system,</b> for instance, functions as a mirror to <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German states and shows a utopian ideal where the bourgeois characteristic of competence is more important than birth. In addition, Funke points to the recurring motif of revolution in Discovery. The trilogy is presenting revolutions as {{something that needs to be}} avoided because they can hinder achieving one’s goals and are responsible for the downfall of peoples.|$|R
40|$|Abstract I {{examine the}} {{legitimacy}} of immigration controls {{in the context of}} Canada and this country’s restrictive immigration policies. Despite the fundamental, philosophical arguments against immigration restrictions, the necessity of immigration controls is rarely questioned in Canadian politics. In this paper I suggest that there is an incredible cynicism of Canadian immigration policies with respect to this country’s own political principles. The idea of international migration controls is neither sustainable from a larger liberaltheory perspective nor a political-economy viewpoint. I suggest that geographers should imagine alternatives to <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> immigration control and the regulation of the international movement of people...|$|R
