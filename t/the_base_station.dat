The network is controlled by Motorola. In case a base station no longer can communicate with the core net, <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>station</b> can still relay communication within its range.

5|$|Using {{conventional}} GSM systems {{was rejected}} also because GSM lacks {{many of the}} functionalities of TETRA, such as group conversations, dispatcher centers, and direct communication. In addition, Global System for Mobile Communication – Railway (GSM-R) was considered, but rejected {{because of the lack}} of trans-border functionality and the need for more base stations, and thus higher investment costs, and longer start-up time for calls. The technology was considered because the Norwegian National Rail Administration was at the time building a GSM-R network to cover the entire Norwegian railway network. Another reason that TETRA was preferred was that at the time of decision there were five manufacturers of TETRA equipment and only two for GSM-R. TETRA also allows a fall-back system, where a base station can allow communication between users within the range of <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>station,</b> even if the central parts of the network break down.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} {{the problem of}} allocating clients to <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> in wireless networks. Two design decisions are the location of <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>stations,</b> and <b>the</b> power levels of <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>stations.</b> We model <b>the</b> interference, due to the increased power usage resulting in greater serving radius, as capacities that are non-increasing {{with respect to the}} covering radius. Clients have demands that are not necessarily uniform and the capacity of a facility limits the total demand that can be served by the facility. We consider three models. In the first model, the location of <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> and <b>the</b> clients are fixed, and the problem is to determine the serving radius for each <b>base</b> <b>station</b> so as to serve a set of clients with maximum total profit subject to the capacity constraints of <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>stations.</b> In <b>the</b> second model, each client has an associated demand in addition to its profit. A fixed number of facilities have to be opened from a candidate set of locations. The goal is to serve clients so as to maximize the profit subject to the capacity constraints. In the third model, the location and the serving radius of <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> are to be determined. There are costs associated with opening <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>stations,</b> and <b>the</b> goal is to open a set of <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> of minimum total cost so as to serve the entire demand subject to the capacity constraints at <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>stations.</b> We show that for the first model the problem is NP-complete even when there are only two choices for the serving radius, and the capacities are 1, 2. For the second model, we give a 1 / 2 approximation algorithm. For the third model, we give a column generation procedure for solving the standard linear programming model, and a randomized rounding procedure. We establish the efficacy of <b>the</b> column generation <b>based</b> rounding scheme on randomly generated instances...|$|R

[...] It was therefore equipped with a generously sized station building, the second largest on the line after the one in Zermatt. At {{the start of the}} 20th century, there were plans to build another railway line to Saas-Fee that would branch off here from the existing line; World War I, however, thwarted these plans. The importance of the station (which, since 1931, has had the official name Stalden-Saas) has decreased since the 1950s, as the departure point since then for the Postbus line has been Brig, not Stalden. Nevertheless, the buses still stop also at Stalden station, and form a connection there with the trains to Zermatt. Immediately adjacent to the railway tracks there is also <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>station</b> of the cable car to Staldenried.
