Suppose <b>that</b> (z_ 1 ^',z_ 2 ^',...,z_n^')∈ X^n is another Φ-coincidence point of F and g such <b>that</b> gz_i^'=z_i^' <b>for</b> <b>all</b> i. Since (z_ 1,z_ 2,...,z_n) and (z_ 1 ^',z_ 2 ^',...,z_n^') are two Φ-coincidence points of F and g, by Step 1 it follows <b>that</b> gz_i=gz_i^' <b>for</b> <b>all</b> i and so z_i=gz_i=gz_i^'=z_i^' <b>for</b> <b>all</b> i.

Max travels back to the time at which she took the gallery photo, which eventually leads her to sojourn alternative realities as they devolve into a dreamscape nightmare. Max and Chloe finally return to the lighthouse and confront the fact that Max brought the storm into existence by availing herself of the time travel abilities in the first place. The only way to prevent it is for Max {{to go back to the}} beginning and allow Chloe to be killed by Nathan. Max must make a choice: sacrifice Chloe's life to save Arcadia Bay, or sacrifice Arcadia Bay in order to spare Chloe.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of the noble gases aided {{in the development of}} a general understanding of atomic structure. In 1895, French chemist Henri Moissan attempted to form a reaction between fluorine, the most electronegative element, and argon, one of the noble gases, but failed. Scientists were unable to prepare compounds of argon until the end of the 20th century, but these attempts helped to develop new theories of atomic structure. Learning from these experiments, Danish physicist Niels Bohr proposed in 1913 that the electrons in atoms are arranged in shells surrounding the nucleus, and <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> noble gases except helium the outermost shell always contains eight electrons. In 1916, Gilbert N. Lewis formulated the octet rule, which concluded an octet of electrons in the outer shell was the most stable arrangement for any atom; this arrangement caused them to be unreactive with other elements since they did not require any more electrons to complete their outer shell.|$|E
