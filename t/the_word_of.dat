5|$|John Calvin was {{influenced}} by Martin Luther's idea of baptism as God's promises to the baptized person attached to the outward sign of washing with water. Calvin maintained Zwingli's idea of baptism as a public pledge, but insisted that it was secondary to baptism's meaning {{as a sign of}} God's promise to forgive sin. He maintained that sacraments were effective instruments in bringing about the promises they represent, however he also maintained that the promises could be refused by the baptized, and would have no effect in that case. Calvin carefully distinguished between the outward sign of the washing of water with the promises that baptism signifies while maintaining that they were inseparable. Calvin's baptismal theology is very similar to that of Luther. It differs in the way Calvin subordinated sacraments to the preaching of <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> God. While Luther placed preaching and sacraments on the same level, Calvin saw sacraments as confirmation which is added to the preaching of <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> God.|$|E

40|$|ON THE AREA — TYPOLOGICAL STUDY OF THE BALTIC ORIGIN WORDS IN BYELORUSSIAN DIALECTS Summary The paper {{deals with}} the area—typological {{characteristics}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> Baltic origin, func­tioning in Byelorussian dialects. It concerns the zones <b>of</b> functioning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> Baltic ori­gin on the linguistic map of Byelorussia, {{taking into account the}} degree of their concentration (strong, intermediate, weak). Considering <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> Baltic origin in the lexical system of Byelorussian dialects, the main types are distinguished, namely: (1) <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> Baltic origin comprising all the dialect areas <b>of</b> Byelorussia; (2) <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> Baltic origin used in some group of dialects generally in the neighbouring areas; (3) <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> Baltic origin concentrated in the dialects of the north-western part of Byelorussia.

5|$|Lutheran theologian Rudolf Bultmann {{proposed}} that the Bible contains existential content which is expressed through mythology; Bultmann sought to find the existential truths behind the veil of mythology, a task known as 'demythologising'. Bultmann distinguished between informative language and language with personal import, the latter of which commands obedience. He believed that God interacts with humans as the divine Word, perceiving a linguistic character inherent in God, which seeks to provide humans with self-understanding. Bultmann believed that the cultural embeddedness of the Bible could be overcome by demythologising the Bible, a process which he believed would allow readers to better encounter <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> God.|$|E

5|$|The Bible {{is central}} in Zwingli's {{work as a}} {{reformer}} and is crucial {{in the development of}} his theology. Zwingli appealed to scripture constantly in his writings.

He believed that man is a liar and only God is the truth. For him scripture, as God's word, brings light when there is only darkness of error.|$|E
5|$|Both {{candidates}} {{believed that}} the states of New York, New Jersey, Indiana, and Connecticut would determine the election. In New York, Blaine received less support than he anticipated when Arthur and Conkling, still powerful in the New York Republican party, failed to actively campaign for him. Blaine hoped {{that he would have}} more support from Irish Americans than Republicans typically did; while the Irish were mainly a Democratic constituency in the 19th century, Blaine’s mother was Irish Catholic, and he believed his career-long opposition to the British government would resonate with the Irish. Blaine’s hope for Irish defections to the Republican standard were dashed late in the campaign when one of his supporters, Samuel D. Burchard, gave a speech denouncing the Democrats as the party of “Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion.” The Democrats spread <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> this insult {{in the days before the}} election, and Cleveland narrowly won all four of the swing states, including New York by just over one thousand votes. While the popular vote total was close, with Cleveland winning by just one-quarter of a percent, the electoral votes gave Cleveland a majority of 219–182.|$|E
5|$|In Reformed theology, sacraments {{are held}} to be, along with <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> God preached, the means of grace. In the sacraments, God graciously condescends to use common {{material}} objects to communicate divine promises to people. The grace promised consists not only in benefits which God bestows on people, but Christ's person himself, to whom God unites the believer. Sacraments confirm or ratify the promises communicated in preaching. Both preaching and the sacraments are not merely symbolic and representative of the reality to which they refer, but actually create the reality of saving grace. The sacraments are made efficacious by the Holy Spirit in actually bringing into effect the promises signified in the sacraments. This efficacy is only beneficial, however, {{for those who have}} faith. The sacrament remains efficacious regardless of the recipient's response. Its effect is negative, resulting in judgement, for the faithless; while it confers Christ and his benefits for the faithful.|$|E
50|$|The G'hantha of the Epiklesis, or Invocation of Holy Spirit. The Epiklesis {{itself is}} called Nithi Mar (May He come, O Lord) from its opening <b>words.</b> <b>The</b> Liturgy <b>of</b> the Apostles is so vague {{as to the}} purpose of the Invocation that, when <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> Institution are not said, it would be {{difficult}} to imagine this formula to be sufficient on any hypothesis, Eastern or Western. The Anaphorae of Nestorius and Theodore, besides having <b>the</b> <b>Words</b> <b>of</b> Institution, have definite Invocations, evidently copied from Antiochean or Byzantine forms. The older Chaldean and the Malabar Catholic books have inserted <b>the</b> <b>Words</b> <b>of</b> Institution with an Elevation, after the Epiklesis. But the 1901 Mosul edition puts <b>the</b> <b>Words</b> <b>of</b> Institution first.|$|R

5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, protest against South Africa's {{apartheid}} regime reached {{the stage of}} seeking to exclude the nation from international sport. In 1956, government rules requiring separate events for whites and non-whites in South Africa were issued; non-whites received poorer facilities. Brundage initially opposed taking any action. The run-up to the 1960 Rome Olympics had seen tumult in South Africa, including the Sharpeville massacre and a crackdown on the African National Congress. Activists attempted to persuade Brundage that South Africa should be excluded from the Games. Brundage initially took <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> South African sport leaders that all citizens were able to compete for {{a place on the}} Olympic team, and that non-white South Africans simply were not good enough.|$|E
5|$|The Anglo-Saxon kings {{built up}} a set of written laws, issued either as {{statutes}} or codes, but these laws were never written down in their entirety and were always supplemented by an extensive oral tradition of customary law. In {{the early part of}} the period local assemblies called moots were gathered to apply the laws to particular cases; in the 10th century these were replaced by hundred courts, serving local areas, and shire moots dealing with larger regions of the kingdom. Many churchmen and thegns were also given permission by the king to hold their own local courts. The legal system depended on a system of oaths, in which the value of different individuals swearing on behalf of the plaintiff or defendant varied according to their social status - <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> a companion of the king, for example, was worth twelve times that of a churl. If fines were imposed, their size similarly varied accord to the oath-value of the individual. The Anglo-Saxon authorities struggled to deal with the bloodfeuds between families that emerged following violent killings, attempting to use a system of weregild, a payment of blood money, as a way of providing an alternative to long-running vendettas.|$|E
5|$|With Henry VIII’s {{closure of}} the monasteries 1536–41, the advowson and tithes of Llanbadarn Fawr became the {{property}} of the lay owners. Under the later Stuarts the lordship of Llanbadarn had passed to the Earl of Danby, and the rectory to Sir Robert Holmes. By 1660 the tithes belonged to Roger Palmer (1634–1705), who became earl of Castlemaine by virtue (if that is <b>the</b> <b>word)</b> <b>of</b> his wife Barbara (née Villiers) being the mistress of Charles II. Since Castlemaine did not acknowledge Barbara’s five children by Charles (and perhaps other lovers) the tithes of Llanbadarn passed to his nephew James. His daughter Catherine married Giles Chichester of Arlington Court, Devon. They were both Catholics, which forced them to pay heavy taxes. Not all subsequent members of the Chichester family were absentees, however; Sir John Chichester, 1st Baronet, of Arlington Court, was High Sheriff of Cardiganshire in 1831, when he was living in Llanbadarn Fawr. But the income was lost to the church. The tithes were not especially valuable; in the eighteenth century the vicarage was worth only £27 annually; in the fourteenth century they were comparatively small compared with the income from the lands then owned by the church – which passed with the manor or lordship, on the Dissolution of the Monasteries, to the lay owners.|$|E
