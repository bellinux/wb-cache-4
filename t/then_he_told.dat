500|$|Tina fell in {{love for}} the first time with a boy named Harry. She spoke about this {{relationship}} in her 1986 interview with Rolling Stone. [...] "It was a basketball game – the school Harry attended was playing my school. I was just graduating from junior high. Well, I looked across the gym and saw Harry, and I {{fell in love}}. My heart was beating so fast. I'm a very bold person, so I ran down to the coach and said, 'Who is number 9?' I just had to have that guy. And he said, 'His name is Harry.' And <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> Harry that I had asked who he was. And Harry looked up at me, and I'll never forget it; it was love at first sight." [...] She recalls he was a playboy,"Harry was real popular and had tons of girlfriends, but eventually I got him, and we went steady for a year." [...] The reason for their break-up she says, [...] "Harry and I broke up because he started playing around. He started dating a girl named Theresa, and by the time he and I got back together, she had become pregnant. He felt he should marry her. I wish he had told me his decision himself, but he didn't. One morning I got on the bus to school, and my friend said, 'Did you hear that Theresa and Harry got married?' I had to go a full day without crying. At the end of the day, I cried it all out." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Cao Cao, a warlord {{who rose}} to {{prominence}} in {{the final years of}} the Han dynasty and became the de facto head of the Han central government, was still relatively unknown to others, he once visited Qiao Xuan. Qiao Xuan was surprised to see Cao Cao and he told him, [...] "The world is about to enter a state of chaos. You're the person who will restore peace and order!" [...] At the time, Qiao Xuan and He Yong were the only two persons who felt that Cao Cao was extraordinary. Cao Cao later often said that Qiao Xuan was someone who really understood him. The Wei Shu (魏書) recorded that Qiao Xuan told Cao Cao, [...] "I've seen many famous persons but I've never seen someone like you before! You should work hard. I'm old already! I {{hope to be able to}} entrust my family to you." [...] Cao Cao's fame increased after his meeting with Qiao Xuan. The Shishuo Xinyu recorded that when Qiao Xuan met Cao Cao, who was still a youth <b>then,</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> him, [...] "The world is in chaos and warlords are fighting for supremacy. Aren't you the person who will eliminate all of them and restore order? You're actually a hero in chaotic times but a villain in times of peace. It's a pity that I'm old already because I won't be able to see you become wealthy and powerful. I entrust my descendants to you." [...] Qiao Xuan also recommended Cao Cao to see Xu Shao, a well-known commentator and character evaluator.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the episode}} [...] "There's Something About Paulie" [...] of the TV series Family Guy, a scene plays {{from the film}} Goodfellas where Joe Pesci asks how <b>he's</b> funny, and <b>then</b> <b>he's</b> <b>told</b> that <b>he's</b> [...] "Rita Rudner funny".|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, indeed she does," [...] replied Neale, seriously. And <b>then</b> briefly <b>he</b> <b>told</b> General Lodge Allie's {{story as}} related by her.|$|R

2500|$|In the dashcam audio/video of the {{incident}} Yanez can be heard being questioned by St. Anthony Police Officer Tressa Sunde within minutes of the shooting, and telling her: {{was sitting in the}} car, seat belted. I told him, 'Can I see your license?' And <b>then,</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> me he had a firearm. I told him not to reach for it and (sigh) when he went down to grab, I told him not to reach for it (clears throat) and then he kept it right there, and I told him to take his hands off of it, and then he (sigh) he had his, his grip a lot wider than a wallet .... And I don't know where the gun was, he didn't tell me where the fucking gun was, and then it was just getting hinky, he gave, he was just staring ahead, and then I was getting fucking nervous, and then I told him, I know I fucking told him to get his fucking hand off his gun.According to the official Minnesota Department of Public Safety's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) transcript of the interview of Yanez and his attorneys Tom Kelly and Robert Fowler, Yanez stated that his justification for the shooting was based on fear for his own life because he believed that Castile's behavior was abusive toward a young girl passenger (Reynolds' daughter) in the car. Yanez said: [...] "I thought, I was gonna die, and I thought if he's, if he has the, the guts and the audacity to smoke marijuana in front of the five-year-old girl and risk her lungs and risk her life by giving her secondhand smoke and the front seat passenger doing the same thing, then what, what care does he give about me?" [...] The victims' previous marijuana use later became a focus of the defense, with a mason jar containing a small amount having been found in the car.|$|E
2500|$|Bradshaw {{returned}} on {{an episode}} of SmackDown! in 2003, which saw him and his old friend Faarooq saving the Undertaker {{from the hands of}} Chuck Palumbo and Johnny Stamboli. Layfield returned with a new look by cutting his long hair, returning it to its natural color, and going clean shaven. His new look would only be referenced once when, in a scripted segment, Faarooq asked him directly about it. Bradshaw insisted that he had already told the story to Faarooq, who rejected this claim. The duo would return to perform their regular segments, as they did before the brand extension, such as playing poker, drinking beer, and bribing superstars of their money. Unlike before, they would not attack or protect other superstars at the employment of other superstars as none would hire them. At Vengeance, Bradshaw won a bar room brawl match which featured Faarooq and a variety of mid-card superstars and other WWE employees. The duo wrestled tag teams such as the Basham Brothers (Doug and Danny) at No Mercy and The World's Greatest Tag Team (Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin) at No Way Out. At WrestleMania XX in 2004, they unsuccessfully challenged for the WWE Tag Team Championship in a fatal four-way tag team match. The gimmick continued on-and-off until the March 18 episode of SmackDown! until losing a tag team [...] "You're Fired" [...] match to WWE Tag Team Champions Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty for the tag team title. General Manager Paul Heyman, frustrated by an insult by the APA, told Faarooq that if he did not win the aforementioned match, then [...] "You're Fired". After the match, Bradshaw led Faarooq back to Heyman's office to state they had not been fired, but had resigned. Then Heyman cleared up the misunderstanding and pointed out that he said that if they did not win the titles, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> Faarooq [...] "You're fired". His reason for saying this directly to Faarooq was because it applied only to Faarooq because [...] "WWE Management" [...] still saw a lot of potential in Bradshaw. He left them after telling Bradshaw to think about his own future. Faarooq shouted after Heyman that he was not fired because they (Faarooq and Bradshaw) had quit. Bradshaw, however, hesitated. Faarooq took Bradshaw's hesitation to mean that he would not resign, and so Faarooq promptly disbanded the APA and left. In reality, the WWE had decided to stop using Ron Simmons as an on-air performer. He was initially released, but he was later re-hired to work behind the scenes in the WWE under various roles.|$|E

I didn't 'arf like it, sir, because I'm not supposed to absent myself for very long of a morning, though the committee ain't very partik'lar. But Mr. Travers 'e was of the police, sir, so I thought it was right to do as <b>'e</b> <b>told</b> me." ...|$|R

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>then</b> <b>told</b> them {{in detail}} what the Indian girl had related.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>then</b> <b>told</b> Enghien {{the manner}} in which Hector had {{arranged}} and fought his troops.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{wonder whether}} there was any truth in what {{everybody}} was saying about their fighting a duel?" [...] asked Mr. Kennedy. His wife made no answer, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> continued--"You <b>told</b> me of your own knowledge that it was untrue." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>then</b> <b>told</b> Arthur frankly of {{his former}} {{conversation}} with Le Drieux, and of the puzzling photograph.|$|R

60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> {{the boys}} {{of what had been}} done by various explorers to lift the mystery of the frozen north.|$|E
6000|$|The chamberlain {{threw the}} garment over his {{bleeding}} shoulders and fastened {{it with a}} trembling hand. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> his tale, adding: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good for you, Tim!" [...] {{returned}} Ward Porton, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> {{of having}} found the two cards, each containing Dave's signature.|$|E
60|$|In {{the morning}} his first {{question}} was regarding Abner, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> was <b>told</b> that his friend {{was not nearly}} so well as he had been; Aunt Olive even said that Toby had better not go into the sick-room, for fear of disturbing the invalid.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is it much?" [...] asked Silverbridge, jumping still {{higher in}} his bed. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> was <b>told</b> {{that it was}} very much,--that the iron had driven itself into the horse's frog, and that there was {{actually}} no possibility that the horse should run on that day.|$|R
60|$|It was now night; {{the short}} {{twilight}} {{of the season}} having disappeared, while the bearers of the litter had been ascending the hill. A loud rap was given on the door by the guide; and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> was <b>told</b> that his services were no longer needed.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> {{them how}} the prophecy had {{declared}} that he should kill his grandfather, and all {{the story of his}} life.|$|E
