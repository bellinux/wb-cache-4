5|$|Critical {{reception}} of Graveyard Mountain Home was generally positive. Critics {{noted that the}} album was a departure from Moore's previous works, {{and that it was}} best experienced as an alternate soundtrack to Age 13. Moore played songs from Graveyard Mountain Home live for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> small club in Istanbul in 2007, and planned to tour more extensively in the future.|$|E

For <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> French ironclad three watertight iron bulkheads were fitted in the hull. Like most ironclads of their era they were equipped with a metal-reinforced ram.|$|E
5000|$|Oberkassel {{was first}} {{mentioned}} as Cassele in 722/723 and as Cassela in 1144. The name Oberkassel {{refers to a}} Roman fortification; {{in the course of}} time [...] "Romerkastell" [...] (Roman castle) became [...] "Oberkassel".

5|$|Aquarists also {{propagate}} animals {{behind the}} scenes for the aquarium’s exhibits. Since 1985, the aquarium has been deeply involved in jellyfish propagation, creating three temporary exhibitions and one permanent aquarium gallery within the Open Sea wing. In August 2016, aquarists cultured comb jellies for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> laboratory, which may allow them to become a model organism. For the aquarium's temporary exhibition that opened in 2014, the aquarium cultured many cephalopods because of their short life cycles. A display in the exhibition showcased how aquarists rear different species of cephalopods, including the bigfin reef squid. In partnership with Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, at least two deep-sea cephalopod species have been displayed in the exhibition, including flapjack octopuses and the vampire squid.|$|E

5|$|Born in Barstow, California, Tyler {{moved to}} Oceanside, California where he starred as halfback at El Camino High School. After {{receiving}} {{a number of}} awards following his senior season, he was recruited to the University of Washington. With the Washington Huskies, he played mainly as a fullback. The Huskies won the 1978 Rose Bowl his freshman year, and he started for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> game the following season. The back took {{a larger role in}} his junior year as the team went 10–2 and won a bowl game.|$|E

For <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cup final, the players wore numbered shirts. Everton were numbered 1–11, and Manchester City 12–22. Everton goalkeeper Sagar wore 1, with the forwards bearing the higher numbers. Manchester City were the reverse. Forward Brook wore 12, through to goalkeeper Langford who wore 22.|$|E
5|$|Despite only {{finishing}} {{fifth in}} the Scottish League in 1955, Hibs {{were invited to participate}} in the first season of the European Cup, which was not strictly based on league positions at that time. Eighteen clubs who were thought would generate interest across Europe and who also had the floodlights necessary to play games at night, were invited to participate. Floodlights had been used at Easter Road for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> friendly match against Hearts on 18 October 1954. Hibs became the first British club in Europe because the Football League secretary Alan Hardaker persuaded Chelsea, the English champions, not to enter.|$|E
50|$|The Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Lakers {{failed to}} qualify for the playoffs. This marked <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> 20 seasons that both teams missed the playoffs.

Since then, it has rotated around the country's top courses, with the current format {{allowing}} {{each of the six}} major golf regions (Atlantic Canada, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba and Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia) to have its turn on approximately a six-year cycle. Among Canada's ten provinces, only Newfoundland and Labrador has yet to host it.|$|R

5|$|During {{the first}} part of {{qualifying}} (Q1), Mercedes was able to refrain from using the faster super-soft tyres, nevertheless setting times below 1:16. Fastest in the session was Romain Grosjean, who was narrowly quicker than the Mercedes drivers, but on the softer tyre compound. With Button not participating, four drivers were left to be eliminated. The two Manor drivers once more did not make the cut and took 18th and 19th on the grid, with Roberto Merhi out-qualifying his teammate Will Stevens for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> qualifying that both drivers participated in. Joining them on the sidelines were two more prominent drivers: both Sebastian Vettel and Felipe Massa suffered from problems with their power units, finishing 16th and 17th respectively.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the return}} of the United Front to power, the anniversary on 21 February 1956 was {{observed}} for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> peaceful atmosphere.

The session of the constituent assembly was stopped for five minutes to express condolence for the students slain in the police shootings. Major rallies were organised by Bengali leaders and all public offices and businesses remained closed.|$|E
5|$|For {{his work}} on Itchy & Scratchy, Grampa is {{nominated}} for an award for Outstanding Writing in a Cartoon Series. When Grampa sees Itchy & Scratchy for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> clip show introducing the award, he is appalled at the violent humor, and turns his acceptance speech into an assault on both the cartoon and the audience amused by it. He storms off the stage amidst boos and thrown vegetables. Grampa gives the award to Bart and Lisa, and Bart swears never to watch an award show again, unless Billy Crystal is featured.|$|E
5000|$|Fifteen of the 65 female MPs in the 39th Parliament, or 23.4 per cent, {{were elected}} for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2006 election.

5|$|In 1963–64, Chappell batted {{at number}} three for SA for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> match against Queensland at Brisbane, and scored 205 not out. He was the {{youngest}} member of the SA team that won the Sheffield Shield that season. A century against Victoria early the following season resulted in Chappell's selection for a one-off Test against Pakistan at Melbourne in December 1964. He made 11 and took four catches, but was dropped until the Fourth Test in the 1965–66 Ashes series. Chappell supplemented his aggressive batting with brilliant fielding in the slips, and he showed promise as a leg-spinner. At this point, the selectors and captain Bob Simpson considered him an all-rounder: he batted at number seven and bowled 26 (eight-ball) overs for the match.|$|E
5|$|In 2004–05, Ebsary scored {{more than}} 100 {{runs in a}} WNCL season for the first time.

Her best bowling performance came in the first match of the season as she took 3/32 and scored 25 in a six-wicket win over Queensland. Ebsary ended the season with six wickets at 26.83. She bowled 37 overs and conceded 4.35 runs per over.|$|E
5|$|In {{the face}} of a looming crisis in his career, Wills {{admitted}} to throwing in his 1870–71 Australian Cricketers' Guide, and in so doing taunted his enemies to stop him. Nonetheless, he was made Victoria XI captain for the March 1871 intercolonial against New South Wales, held at the Albert Ground. Wills' first innings top score of 39* was offset by his drunken behaviour in the field and his apparent reluctance to bowl for fear of being called. Victoria won by 48 runs. Not long after, Wills was no-balled for throwing for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> club match. Rumour spread that the umpire had conspired against him with the opposing club's owner.|$|E

5|$|Sure, it's not a Sepultura reunion, {{but having}} Max and Igor {{performing}} on record for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dozen years {{is as close}} as we'll ever get, and not only does Cavalera Conspiracy's Inflikted revisit the post-thrash sounds of 1993's Chaos A.D., but it manages to outshine anything Sepultura has put out in the last dozen years. Rounded out by Soulfly lead guitarist Marc Rizzo and, most impressively, Gojira frontman Joe Duplantier on bass and rhythm guitar, the band is as solid a metal supergroup as you'll ever come across, and the album's eleven tracks benefit hugely from the chemistry between the four musicians.|$|E
5|$|The Bearcats {{opened the}} 2008 college {{football}} season against , winning 40–7 in an offensive effort led by senior quarterback Dustin Grutza, {{who was named}} the team's starter at that position following Mauk's dismissal.
