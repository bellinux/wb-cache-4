5000|$|In {{its modern}} inception, {{high-throughput}} genome sequencing involves fragmenting the genome into small single-stranded pieces, followed by amplification of the fragments by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Adopting the Sanger method, each DNA fragment is irreversibly terminated with {{the incorporation of}} a fluorescently labeled dideoxy chain-terminating nucleotide, thereby producing a DNA “ladder” of fragments that each differ in length by one base and bear a base-specific fluorescent label at the <b>terminal</b> <b>base.</b> Amplified base ladders are then separated by Capillary Array Electrophoresis (CAE) with automated, in situ “finish-line” detection of the fluorescently labeled ssDNA fragments, which provides an ordered sequence of the fragments.

40|$|Abstract − It is {{demonstrated}} that, {{when using the}} Histogram Test Method to test an analogue to digital converter, the presence of additive noise in the test setup or in the converter itself causes a bias in the <b>terminal</b> <b>based</b> estimation of the gain {{but not in the}} estimation of the offset. This will be demonstrated here by analytically determining the estimation error {{as a function of the}} sinusoidal stimulus signal amplitude and the noise standard deviation.

40|$|Tn 10 {{transposition}} {{involves the}} formation of a hairpin intermediate at the transposon termini. Here we show that hairpin formation exhibits more stringent DNA sequence requirements at the terminal two base pairs than either transpososome assembly or first strand nicking. We also observe a significant DNA distortion at the <b>terminal</b> <b>base</b> pairs upon transpososome assembly by chemical nuclease footprinting. Interest ingly, mutations at these positions do not necessarily inhibit {{the formation of}} the distortion. However, it remains a possibility that the inhibitory effect of these mutations is due to a defect in protein–DNA interactions subsequent to this deformation. <b>Terminal</b> <b>base</b> pair mutations also inhibited strand transfer, providing evidence that transposase interactions with the terminal residues on both ‘transferred’ and ‘non-transferred’ strands are important for hairpin formation. We also demonstrate that mutation of a highly conserved tyrosine residue that is a component of the YREK motif, Y 285, results in a phenotype comparable to that of the <b>terminal</b> <b>base</b> pair mutations. In contrast, a mutation at another conserved position, W 265, is shown to relax the specificity of the hairpin formation reaction...|$|E

In a recent report, we showed that a nanopore device coupled with machine learning algorithms could automatically discriminate among the four combinations of Watson±Crick base pairs and their orientations at the ends of individual DNA hairpin molecules. Here we use kinetic analysis to demonstrate that ionic current signatures caused by these hairpin molecules depend on the number of hydrogen bonds within the <b>terminal</b> <b>base</b> pair, stacking between the <b>terminal</b> <b>base</b> pair and its nearest neighbor, and 5 ¢ versus 3 ¢ orientation of the terminal bases independent of their nearest neighbors.

40|$|The human RAD 52 protein, which {{exhibits}} a heptameric ring structure, {{has been shown}} to bind resected double strand breaks (DSBs), consistent with an early role in meiotic recombination and DSB repair. In this work, we show that RAD 52 binds single-stranded and tailed duplex DNA molecules via precise interactions with the <b>terminal</b> <b>base.</b> When probed with hydroxyl radicals, ssDNA–RAD 52 complexes exhibit a four-nucleotide repeat hypersensitivity pattern. This unique pattern is due to the interaction of RAD 52 with either a 5 ′ or a 3 ′ terminus of the ssDNA, is sequence independent and is phased precisely from the terminal nucleotide. Hypersensitivity is observed over ∼ 36  nucleotides, consistent with the length of DNA that is protected by RAD 52 in nuclease protection assays. We propose that RAD 52 binds DNA breaks via specific interactions with the <b>terminal</b> <b>base,</b> leading to the formation of a precisely organized ssDNA–RAD 52 complex in which the DNA lies on an exposed surface of the protein. This protein–DNA arrangement may facilitate the DNA–DNA interactions necessary for RAD 52 -mediated annealing of complementary DNA strands...|$|E

Then, the effective loop lengths of l 1, l 2, l 3, and l 4 are equal to the sum of the number of unpaired nucleotides and the number of stem-loop substructures. This approximation ignores the (weak) excluded volume interference between the stem-loop substructure and the loop, thus enabling us to treat general kissing motifs.|$|E

The structure was refined first at 1. 9 Å by XPLOR and subsequently by CNS at 1. 8 Å. The hybrid is found in a standard A-form conformation with all the sugars in the C 3 ′-endo puckering.
