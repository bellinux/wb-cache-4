All states of the world, however great, fall at once when they use mercenary armies; and although it is a less instant form of error (because involving no national taint of cowardice), it is yet an error no less ultimately fatal--it is the error especially of modern times, of which we cannot yet know all the calamitous consequences--to take away the best blood and strength of the nation, all the soul-substance of it that is brave, and careless of reward, and scornful of pain, and faithful in trust; and to cast that into steel, and make a mere sword of it; taking away its voice and will; but to keep {{the worst part of}} the nation--whatever is cowardly, avaricious, sensual, and faithless--and to give to this the voice, to this the authority, to this the chief privilege, where there is least capacity, of thought. The fulfilment of your vow for the defence of England will by no means consist in carrying out such a system. You are not true soldiers, if you only mean to stand at a shop door, to protect shop-boys who are cheating inside. A soldier's vow to his country is that he will die for the guardianship of her domestic virtue, of her righteous laws, and of her anyway challenged or endangered honour. A state without virtue, without laws, and without honour, he is bound not to defend; nay, bound to redress by his own right hand that which he sees to be base in her. So sternly is this the law of Nature and life, that a nation once utterly corrupt can only be redeemed by a military despotism--never by talking, nor by its free effort. And the health of any state consists simply in this: that in it, those who are wisest shall also be strongest; its rulers should be also its soldiers; or, rather, by force of intellect more than of sword, its soldiers its rulers. Whatever the hold which the aristocracy of England has on the heart of England, in that they are still always in front of her battles, this hold will not be enough, unless they are also in front of her thoughts. And truly her <b>thoughts</b> <b>need</b> good captain's leading now, if ever! Do you know what, by this beautiful division of labour (her brave men fighting, and her cowards thinking), she has come at last to think? Here is a bit of paper in my hand,[6] a good one too, and an honest one; quite representative of the best common public thought of England at this moment; and it is holding forth in one of its leaders upon our 'social welfare,'--upon our 'vivid life'--upon the 'political supremacy of Great Britain.' And what do you think all these are owing to? To what our English sires have done for us, and taught us, age after age? No: not to that. To our honesty of heart, or coolness of head, or steadiness of will? No: not to these. To our thinkers, or our statesmen, or our poets, or our captains, or our martyrs, or the patient labour of our poor? No: not to these; or at least not to these in any chief measure. Nay, says the journal, 'more than any agency, it is the cheapness and abundance of our coal which have made us what we are.' If it be so, then 'ashes to ashes' be our epitaph! and the sooner the better. I tell you, gentlemen of England, if ever you would have your country breathe the pure breath of heaven again, and receive again a soul into her body, instead of rotting into a carcase, blown up in the belly with carbonic acid (and great that way), you must think, and feel, for your England, as well as fight for her: you must teach her that all the true greatness she ever had, or ever can have, she won while her fields were green and her faces ruddy;--that greatness is still possible for Englishmen, even though the ground be not hollow under their feet, nor the sky black over their heads;--and that, when the day comes for their country to lay her honours in the dust, her crest will not rise from it more loftily because it is dust of coal. Gentlemen, I tell you, solemnly, that the day is coming when the soldiers of England must be her tutors and the captains of her army, captains also of her mind.|$|E

O objetivo é contribuir para o pleno desenvolvimento da pessoa. Karl Ernst Nipkow, o {{precursor}} desta didática e metodologia, fundamenta-se nas teorias do didático Wolfgang Klafki, o qual afirmava que os objetos de estudo e os temas deveriam ser compreensíveis às pessoas e vice-versa: as pessoas sendo compreensíveis aos objetos de estudo e temas. A abordagem da Elementarisierung aplica essa teoria da compreensão inversa e a amplia, quando compreende os processos da aprendizagem entre as pessoas e o conteúdo a ser aprendido. Assim, a abordagem metodológica da Elementarisierung organiza-se no desenvolvimento das dimensões e competências concluindo que os pensamentos teológicos e pedagógicos precisam estar conectados.

40|$|My {{program of}} {{research}} involves {{the development and}} validation of culturally sensitive measures of well-being for use among refugees affected by the recently-concluded civil war between the Sinhalese-majority government and the Tamil LTTE terrorist group in Sri Lanka, which has troubled the country {{for more than twenty}} years. In addition, I conducted an investigation among these populations assessing the mental health, resilience and post-traumatic growth of displaced populations seeking treatment at seven psychosocial counseling centers in North-Eastern Sri Lanka. In Study 1, I coded interviews collected from 741 participants in North-East Sri Lanka and developed a 21 -item measure—the PENN/Peradenya/RESIST (PPR) Competencies Questionnaire—based on six domains identified through open coding methodology. These five domains were right <b>thoughts,</b> <b>need</b> fulfillment, family responsibilities, religion, education and pro- social behavior. In Study 2, a total of six focus groups were conducted at the Medical Faculty of the University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka, with the purpose of assessing the face validity and translation quality of measures of well-being and mental health. Each focus group consisted of three males and three females (age range 35 — 62). A number of limitations in the measures were highlighted over the course of these sessions, and one questionnaire—the PANAS—was subsequently dropped. In Study 3, 196 internally displaced people attending psychosocial treatment clinics in North-East Sri Lanka completed the PPR Competencies Questionnaire. Exploratory factor analysis revealed a three-factor solution—Religious Faith, Material Welfare and Community Status. These three factors were differentially relations to life satisfaction, happiness, functional impairment and depression. Study 4 examined the relationship between posttraumatic growth (PTG) and mental health among internally displaced populations in Sri Lanka. An exploratory factor analysis of the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory-Short Form (PTGI-SF) resulted in a two- factor solution. One factor, comprising of the new possibilities and personal strength PTG domains identified by Tedeschi and Calhoun (1996) was related to life satisfaction, happiness and depression, while the second factor—religion or spiritual change—was related to life satisfaction and level of religiosity. Implications of these studies and future directions are discussed. ...|$|E

40|$|RESUMEN. El viaje es un acto de traslación que nos permite transgredir nuestra cotidianeidad y pautas diarias para descontextualizarnos, generando nuevas relaciones entre "nosotros" y las circunstancias de ese otro lugar. No intentamos convertirnos en especialistas del conocimiento sino mejorar lo que hacemos, desarrollar cambios cualitativos, organizar descubrimientos y aplicarlos a nuestro trabajo. Al reflexionar sobre esta idea surgen en nuestro papel en blanco ideas compañeras de los viajes que de {{una manera}} reiterativa nos acompañan en nuestros {{proyecto}}s. Un objeto viajero, que se repite y deja una copia cada vez que es trasladado, nos permite valorar la relación entre el lugar y dicho objeto, entre la memoria y la arquitectura. La repetición surge como una sorpresa del viaje, como una situación descubierta en la traslación, un descubrimiento ocasional que nos permite descubrir una intención y por ello un criterio. Una pareja viajera, en este caso dos leones egipcios que viajaron a Roma en la Antigüedad desplazándose dentro de la ciudad hasta el Vaticano. El otro ejemplo es el del proyecto sin encargo que nace en la mente de su autor, Le Corbusier, como un manifiesto del Arte, y nos permite pensar que las ideas, los pensamientos, necesitan ser olvidados para ser reconstruidos, para poder ser repetidos de la manera mas creativa. El proyecto de arquitectura no es solo la génesis de prototipos sino que debe ser la formalización de una idea que madura en el tiempo ajustándose a la concreción exigida en cada lugar y circunstancias, persistiendo incluso más allá del propio autor. SUMMARY. Travel {{is an act}} of movement that allows us to break from our daily routines and guidelines and decontextualizes us, generating new relationships between "us" and the circumstances of some other place. We do not try to become specialists of the knowledge but to improve what we do, to develop qualitative changes, to organize discoveries and to apply them to our work. Reflecting on this idea, when faced with the blank paper, our thoughts that accompany us on journeys arise in a reiterative way to accompany us in our plans. A travelling object, that which repeats itself and leaves a copy whenever it is moved, allows us to assess the relationship between the place and that object, between memory and architecture. The repetition arises as a surprise from the journey, like a situation discovered in the movement, an occasional discovery that allows us to discover an intention and thereby a criterion. A travelling couple, in this case two Egyptian lions that travelled to Rome in antiquity, moving within the city to the Vatican. The other example is that of the non-commissioned project that is born in the mind of its author, Le Corbusier, like a manifesto of the Art. It allows us to think that the ideas, the <b>thoughts,</b> <b>need</b> to be forgotten to be reconstructed, {{to be able to be}} repeated in a more creative manner. The architectural plan is not only the genesis of prototypes but must be the formalization of an idea that matures in time, adjusting to the realization demanded in each place and circumstance, persisting even beyond its own author...|$|E
