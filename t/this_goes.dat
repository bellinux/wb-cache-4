5|$|In {{more recent}} years, the {{original}} Piagetian object permanence account {{has been challenged}} {{by a series of}} infant studies suggesting that much younger infants do have a clear sense that objects exist even when out of sight. Bower showed object permanence in 3-month-olds. <b>This</b> <b>goes</b> against Piaget's coordination of secondary circular reactions stage because infants aren't supposed to understand that a completely hidden object still exists until they are eight to twelve months old. The two studies below demonstrate this idea.|$|E
5|$|All six {{units are}} served by an {{independent}} wet limestone-gypsum flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) plant, which was installed between 1988 and 1996. This diverts gases from the boilers and passes them through a limestone slurry, which removes at least 90% of the sulphur dioxide (SO2). This is equivalent to removing over 250,000 tonnes of SO2 each year. The process requires 10,000 tonnes of limestone a week, sourced from Tunstead Quarry in Derbyshire. A byproduct of the process is gypsum, with 15,000 tonnes produced each week. <b>This</b> <b>goes</b> {{to be used in}} the manufacture of plasterboard. The gypsum is sold exclusively to British Gypsum, and it is transported by rail to their plants at Kirkby Thore (on the Settle-Carlisle Line), East Leake (on the former Great Central Main Line) and occasionally to Robertsbridge (on the Hastings Line). DB Cargo UK transport the gypsum.|$|E

5|$|Evidence for a virus {{as a cause}} {{include the}} {{presence}} of oligoclonal bands {{in the brain and}} cerebrospinal fluid of most people with MS, the association of several viruses with human demyelination encephalomyelitis, and the occurrence of demyelination in animals caused by some viral infections. Human herpes viruses are a candidate group of viruses. Individuals having never been infected by the Epsteinâ€“Barr virus are at a reduced risk of getting MS, whereas those infected as young adults are at a greater risk than those having had it at a younger age. Although some consider that <b>this</b> <b>goes</b> against the hygiene hypothesis, since the non-infected have probably experienced a more hygienic upbringing, others believe that there is no contradiction, since it is a first encounter with the causative virus relatively late in life that is the trigger for the disease. Other diseases that may be related include measles, mumps and rubella.|$|E
25|$|Also when {{children}} with congenital (infantile) strabismus (e.g. infantile esotropia) receive strabismus surgery {{within the first}} few years or two of their life, <b>this</b> <b>goes</b> along with the hope that they may yet develop their full potential for binocular vision including stereopsis.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the first}} argument, power in excess of {{immediate}} demand is exported to neighbouring countries at lower prices.

25|$|Saturn shows complex {{patterns}} in its brightness. Most {{of the variability}} {{is due to the}} changing aspect of the rings, and <b>this</b> <b>goes</b> through two cycles every orbit. However, superimposed on this is variability due to the eccentricity of the planet's orbit that causes the planet to display brighter oppositions in the northern hemisphere than it does in the southern.|$|E

25|$|The hymn {{was one of}} the exclamations of {{the fathers}} at the Council of Chalcedon (451), and is common not only to all the Greek Oriental liturgies, but was used also in the Gallican Liturgy (see Saint Germain of Paris, d. 576), which shows that the hymn is ancient. Some believe it is {{extremely}} ancient perhaps of apostolic-era origin. However <b>this</b> <b>goes</b> against the Tradition in regards to the hymn.|$|E
25|$|Timber {{has also}} {{long been a}} major industry, {{although}} in recent {{years there has been}} an uneasy balance between forestry for wood and forestry for conservation. Much of the region is public land administered by the Department of Conservation and the region has some of the best remaining stands of native forest, along with a wealth of rare wildlife. Ecotourism is now an important industry, and <b>this</b> <b>goes</b> {{hand in hand with the}} conservation efforts.|$|E
25|$|While {{the main}} intent of DRM {{is to prevent}} {{unauthorized}} copies of a product, there are mathematical models that suggest that DRM schemes can fail {{to do their job}} on multiple levels. Ironically, the biggest failure that can result from DRM is that they have a potential to increase the infringement rate of a product. <b>This</b> <b>goes</b> against the held belief that DRM can always reduce unauthorized distribution. There also seems to be evidence that DRM will reduce profits.|$|E

This was done intentionally, as Kawabata felt that vignettes of incidents along the way were {{far more important than}} conclusions. He equated his form of writing with the traditional poetry of Japan, the haiku.|$|E

25|$|The {{first public}} piped gas supply was to 13 gas lamps, each with three glass globes {{along the length}} of Pall Mall, London in 1807. The credit for <b>this</b> <b>goes</b> to the {{inventor}} and entrepreneur Fredrick Winsor and the plumber Thomas Sugg, who made and laid the pipes. Digging up streets to lay pipes required legislation and this delayed the development of street lighting and gas for domestic use. Meanwhile, William Murdoch and his pupil Samuel Clegg were installing gas lighting in factories and work places, encountering no such impediments.|$|E
25|$|Early {{childhood}} education was strengthened {{through the creation}} of the Early Childhood Care and Development Act of 2000 (Republic Act No. 8980). In 2011, the Department of Education disseminated copies of the Kindergarten Education Act through Republic Act No. 10157 making it compulsory and mandatory in the entire nation. As a provision in this law, children under five years old are required to enroll in a kindergarten in any public elementary school in the country. <b>This</b> <b>goes</b> with the implementation of the K-12 system in the Basic Education Curriculum.|$|E
25|$|The Proto-Sinaitic inscriptions, {{along with}} the {{contemporary}} parallels found in Canaan and Wadi el-Hol, are thus hypothesized to show an intermediate step between Egyptian hieroglyphs and the Phoenician alphabet. Brian Colless (2014) notes that 18 of the 22 letters of the Phoenician alphabet have counterparts in the Byblos syllabary, {{and it seems that}} the proto-alphabet evolved as a simplification of the syllabary, moving from syllabic to consonantal writing, {{in the style of the}} Egyptian script (which did not normally indicate vowels); <b>this</b> <b>goes</b> against the Goldwasser hypothesis (2010) that the original alphabet was invented by ignorant miners in Sinai.|$|E
