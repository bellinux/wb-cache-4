5|$|Emeco founder Wilton C. Dinges {{developed}} the Emeco 1006 chair in 1944 {{in collaboration with}} the Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA). It was originally designed for the US Navy, which needed a chair for the deck of battleships that could survive sea air and a torpedo blast {{to the side of the}} ship. <b>The</b> <b>chairs</b> had eye bolts under the seat, so they could be attached to a ship-deck using cables.|$|E
5|$|Holmes was keenly {{involved}} with {{the details of the}} Agricultural College, influencing everything from the purchase of land for the campus, layout of the buildings, and even the placement of <b>the</b> <b>chairs</b> and tables. Once the College opened, he assumed the role of treasurer and later Professor of Horticulture. By 1861, Holmes had fallen out of favor with the other College administrators, and retired to his home in Detroit. Nevertheless, he continued to support and visit the college until his death in 1887.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Chair</b> {{is often}} used as a {{geographic}} marker for direction giving and holiday celebration; Santa Claus sits upon <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> during Christmas.

5000|$|The film {{begins with}} a {{seemingly}} normal chair onscreen. Jutra enters, carrying a book, and attempts to sit in <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> so he can read his book. <b>The</b> <b>chair</b> unexpectedly moves out from under him. The man's persistent attempts to sit in <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> become increasingly frenetic and increasingly violent ... but only to himself, not to <b>the</b> <b>chair.</b> Finally, it dawns on the man that perhaps <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> will let him sit {{on it for a}} while if he will first allow <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> to sit on him for a few seconds. This gambit succeeds, and all ends happily.|$|R
5|$|The Soviet {{occupation}} in 1940 {{led to the}} closing of the church. During World War II, services were continued, but in the spring of 1944 hooligans broke into the church and destroyed the altar with the altarpiece, the organ, <b>the</b> <b>chairs</b> and the windows. In 1946, the congregation asked the Soviet government to list the Cathedral as a protected historical monument, but it failed to raise their interest. The church was empty for years; for some time it was used for storing grain, even plans for turning it into a swimming-pool were made.|$|E
5|$|The clip {{starts with}} a bride reaching, on a limousine, the chapel on which she's about to get married. As she is shown walking inside the chapel's doors, Arjona starts to sing while sit on <b>the</b> <b>chairs</b> in the empty chapel. Then, the bride is shown again {{alongside}} the groom in the altar, ready to make the vows, while the chapel {{is filled with the}} invitees. Then, scenes of Arjona playing the piano and singing, and scenes of the ceremony are interpolated, showing the behaviour of the invitees. Later, the invitees are shown involved in discussions and fights while Arjona keeps singing the chorus and verses of the song. As the fights between the invitees increase, the groom rejects the bride and she, stunned, escapes from the chapel. Then, it is shown that all was an illusion from the bride, and they are shown exiting the chapel, married. As of 11 July 2012, the video has reached 14 million views on YouTube.|$|E
5|$|To save money, many sets, {{particularly}} interiors, were redresses {{of existing}} sets. The Enterprise bridge was reconfigured {{to stand in}} for the Grissom, with <b>the</b> <b>chairs</b> reupholstered and the central computer consoles moved to modify the floor plan. An Earth bar and the Klingon medical bay were redresses of the Enterprise sickbay. The Klingon bridge was a set that Nimoy appropriated from another production. Many blinking consoles were rented from a props company rather than being fabricated. The Enterprise bridge itself remained largely unchanged from its appearance in the previous films, though the floor was repainted from black to grey to make it photograph better. The most drastic change was made to Spock's quarters. Nimoy had felt the previous grey color scheme did not express a Vulcan style, and had it brightened with yellows and oranges.|$|E

40|$|In {{my office}} I have a large, {{comfortable}} red chair. This chair is a whole—an object composed of its parts. Applying mereological concepts to objects {{allows us to}} make sense of how objects in <b>the</b> world ~like <b>chairs!</b> that occupy a region of space are composed of many smaller objects that occupy subregions of the region. The objects that occupy these subregions are held to be proper parts of <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> as a whole. The approach allows us to understand many facts about <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> in terms of the objects that compose <b>the</b> <b>chair,</b> and to explain a number of seemingly contradictory claims we might want to make about it. We might say <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> is curved and flat, meaning that the part of <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> that is <b>the</b> armrest is curved and the part of <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> that is <b>the</b> seat is flat. We might say <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> is clean and dirty, meaning that the part of <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> that is <b>the</b> headrest is clean but the armrest where I placed my sandwich is dirty. Although I can pick out at least two different objects that have a left armrest as a proper part, an object that is my <b>chair</b> including <b>the</b> headrest and an object that is my <b>chair</b> excluding <b>the</b> headrest, I don’t think there are two distinct left armrests in my office, since the first object entirely overlaps the second. But what if we want to think of <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> in a different way? We can think of <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> as having many different spatial components, but we can also think of <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> as having many different qualitative components. <b>The</b> <b>chair</b> has armrests, a headrest, a back and a seat, but it also has the properties of being red, of being large, and being comfortable. <b>The</b> <b>chair</b> is <b>the</b> sum of its spatial components, but it might very well be that <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> is also <b>the</b> sum of its qualitative components. In other words, it makes sense to think of <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> as composed of many smaller ~and partly overlapping! objects that are spatial parts of <b>the</b> <b>chair.</b> Why not also think of <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> as being made up of many smaller ~and partly overlapping! objects that are qualitative parts of <b>the</b> <b>chair?</b> Indeed...|$|R
5|$|Once {{legislation}} is introduced, it is passed {{to one of}} the standing committees of the Senate. There are six such committees. As a whole, the Maryland General Assembly has fewer standing committees than any other state legislature in the United States. Each committee has between 10 and 15 members. Four of the standing committees deal primarily with legislation; the Budget and Taxation Committee, the Education, Health, and Environmental Affairs Committee, the Finance Committee, and the Judicial Proceedings Committee. <b>The</b> <b>Chairs</b> of these legislative committees have the power to determine whether their committees will hear a bill, and they therefore have significant influence over legislation. The Executive Nominations Committee manages the Senate's responsibility to confirm gubernatorial appointments and makes recommendations of approval and disapproval to the body as a whole. Lastly, the Rules Committee sets the rules and procedures of the body. It also has the power to review legislation that has been introduced {{by a member of the}} Senate after the deadline for submission, and decide whether to refer it to a standing committee or let it die. Along with serving on the Senate committees, members of the Senate also serve on a number of joint committees with members of the House of Delegates.|$|E
5|$|The CoE mistakenly {{believed}} that the waters of Beaver Lake would cover {{the area of the}} large hotels, so those parcels were added to the land they purchased for the project. Dallas Barrack, who owned Oklahoma Row, felt that he had been treated poorly and had received much less than his property was worth. The CoE held a sealed-bid auction and J. G. Gladdens purchased what was left of Missouri and Oklahoma Rows. He planned to move the remnants of Oklahoma Row out of the path of the rising lake waters. In order to do this, it was first necessary to remove the log portion or shell of the hotel. The original windows and doors were dismantled for the move and later reinstalled. The fireplaces, as well as all of the major stonework were later torn down. Also sold at auction were two massive concrete chairs that had been {{at the base of the}} amphitheater. They were bought by Mr. and Mrs. Ulis Rose of Rogers and were used to decorate the lawns of their Town and Country restaurant and motel. <b>The</b> <b>chairs</b> are still located in Rogers; however, they now sit unceremoniously in Frisco Park without any plaque or marker indicating their significance. The concrete couch was left in place at the base of the amphitheater, because no one wanted to try to move it.|$|E

25|$|Field of Empty Chairs: 168 empty chairs hand-crafted from glass, bronze, {{and stone}} {{represent}} {{those who lost}} their lives, with a name etched in the glass base of each. They sit on {{the site where the}} Murrah Building once stood. <b>The</b> <b>chairs</b> represent the empty chairs at the dinner tables of the victims' families. <b>The</b> <b>chairs</b> are arranged in nine rows to symbolize the nine floors of the building; each person's chair is on the row (or the floor) on which the person worked or was located when the bomb went off. <b>The</b> <b>chairs</b> are also grouped according to the blast pattern, with the most chairs nearest the most heavily damaged portion of the building. The westernmost column of five chairs represents the five people who died but were not in the Murrah Building (two in the Water Resources Board building, one in the Athenian Building, one outside near the building, and one rescuer). The 19 smaller chairs represent the children killed in the bombing. Three unborn children died along with their mothers, and they are listed on their mothers' chairs beneath their mothers' names.|$|E
