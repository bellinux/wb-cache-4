5|$|In 2001 an {{extrasolar planet}} similar {{in size to}} Jupiter {{designated}} HD 28185 b was discovered in orbit around the star with a period of 1.04 years. Unlike many long-period extrasolar planets, it has a low orbital eccentricity. The planet experiences similar insolation to Earth, {{which has led to}} speculations about <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>for</b> habitable moons. In addition, numerical simulations suggest that low-mass planets located in the gas giant's Trojan points would be stable for long periods. The planet's existence was independently confirmed by the Magellan Planet Search Program in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Robert died {{fighting}} the Scots {{at the battle}} of Bannockburn and the region around the castle was attacked in 1314 and 1319, causing significant damage to neighbouring Church Brough. Around this time the village of Market Brough was established along the road overlooked by the castle, in an attempt by the Cliffords to maximise <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>for</b> profits from trade along the valley. Market Brough acquired a royal charter in 1330 and seems to have rapidly overtaken Church Brough as the main settlement in the area.|$|E
5|$|The USB Power Delivery Specification revision2.0 (USB PD rev. 2) {{has been}} {{released}} {{as part of the}} USB3.1 suite. It covers the Type-C cable and connector with four power/ground pairs and a separate configuration channel, which now hosts a DC coupled low-frequency BMC-coded data channel that reduces <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>for</b> RF interference. Power Delivery protocols have been updated to facilitate Type-C features such as cable ID function, Alternate Mode negotiation, increased VBUS currents, and VCONN-powered accessories.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, plans for Stord Airport, Sørstokken were launched. The bridge plans across Stokksundet were again {{brought up in}} 1982 as the {{industry}} on Bømlo wanted to not have use a ferry to reach the airport. A committee with representatives from all three municipalities was established in May 1983 to look into <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>for</b> a bridge. Led by Bømlo Mayor Arne M. Haldorsen, it issued Engineer Harald Møyner the task to author a report and recommendation. He made three proposals: a pontoon or suspension bridge between Foldrøyhomen and Litlaneset; a suspension bridge between Setraneset and Sokkbleikjo, which would terminate {{just south of the}} new airport; and a combined fixed link between Spissøy and Digernes, without passing via the Fitjar Archipelago. The latter was the first time a fixed link to the mainland was proposed. The Norwegian Civil Aviation Administration protested against a possible suspension bridge near the airport, but stated that one closer further away would be fine.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the Spanish Civil War, Hitler gave several possible motives for German involvement. Among these were the distraction it provided from German re-militarisation; the prevention of the spread of communism to Western Europe; {{the creation of a}} state friendly to Germany to disrupt Britain and France; and <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>for</b> economic expansion. Although the offensive on Madrid was abandoned in March 1937, a series of attacks on weaker Republican-controlled areas was supported by Germany; despite prolonging the Civil War, it would help to distract the other western powers from Hitler's ambitions in central Europe. The offensive on Vizcaya, a mining and industrial centre, would help fuel German industry. On 27 June 1937, Hitler (in a speech at Wurzburg) declared he supported Franco to gain control of Spanish ore.|$|E
5|$|The {{sections}} of the International that recognised {{the leadership of the}} International Secretariat remained optimistic about <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>for</b> increasing the International's political influence and extended the entrism into social democratic parties which was already underway in Britain, Austria and elsewhere. The 1954 congress emphasised entrism into communist parties and nationalist parties in the colonies, pressing for democratic reforms, ostensibly to encourage the left-wing they perceived to exist in the communist parties to join with them in a revolution. Tensions developed between those who subscribed to the mainstream views of Pablo and a minority that argued unsuccessfully against open work. A number of these delegates walked out of the World Congress, and would eventually leave the International, including the leader of the new British section, John Lawrence, George Clarke, Michele Mestre (a leader of the French section), and Murray Dowson (a leader of the Canadian group).|$|E

5|$|These extreme {{difficulties}} in melting the metal limited <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>for</b> handling iridium. John Isaac Hawkins {{was looking to}} obtain a fine and hard point for fountain pen nibs, and in 1834 managed to create an iridium-pointed gold pen. In 1880, John Holland and William Lofland Dudley were able to melt iridium by adding phosphorus and patented the process in the United States; British company Johnson Matthey later stated they had been using a similar process since 1837 and had already presented fused iridium {{at a number of}} World Fairs. The first use of an alloy of iridium with ruthenium in thermocouples was made by Otto Feussner in 1933. These allowed for the measurement of high temperatures in air up to 2000°C.|$|E

25|$|Ælfthryth {{played a}} large role as forespeca, or advocate, in at least seven legal cases. As such, she formed {{a key part of}} the Anglo-Saxon legal system as a {{mediator}} between the individual and the crown, which was increasingly viewing its role in the courts as a symbol of its authority as protector of its subjects. Ælfthryth's actions as forespeca were largely for the benefit of female litigants, and her role as a mediator shows <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>for</b> women to have legal and political power in late Anglo-Saxon England.|$|E
25|$|Japanese Canadians {{tried to}} resist the forced sale of their properties. At an {{internment}} camp in Kaslo, BC, Japanese-Canadian property owners formed the “Japanese Property Owners’ Association” with branches at other internment camps across BC. Their aim was to explore <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>for</b> legal action, and in May 1944 they launched a claim with the Exchequer Court in Ottawa. The claim was delayed in courts until August 28, 1947, and in the meantime, approximately $11.5 million worth of Japanese-Canadian property had been sold for just over $5 million.|$|E
25|$|Whereas Y-DNA and mtDNA haplogroups {{represent}} {{but a small}} {{component of}} a person’s DNA pool, autosomal DNA {{has the advantage of}} containing hundreds of thousands of examinable genetic loci, thus giving a more complete picture of genetic composition.

Autosomal studies are much more reliable for showing the relationships between existing populations, but do not offer <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>for</b> unravelling their histories {{in the same way as}} mtDNA and NRY DNA studies promise, despite their many complications.|$|E
