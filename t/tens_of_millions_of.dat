Endogenous viral {{elements}} (EVEs) {{that appear to be}} derived from filovirus-like viruses have been identified in the genomes of bats, rodents, shrews, tenrecs, tarsiers, and marsupials. Although most filovirus-like EVEs appear to be pseudogenes, evolutionary analyses suggest that orthologs isolated from several species of the bat genus Myotis have been maintained by selection.|$|R
50|$|When {{the book}} was written, {{the nature of the}} energy source that powers stars was not known: Lord Kelvin had {{published}} calculations based on the hypothesis that the energy came from the gravitational collapse of the gas cloud that had formed the sun and found that this mechanism gave the Sun a lifetime of only a few <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> <b>million</b> <b>of</b> years. Starting from this premise, Hodgson wrote a novel describing a time, <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> years in the future, when the Sun has gone dark.|$|R

Re-elected in 2011, Tarleton held various leadership positions, including Chair of the Commission Audit Committee and President of the Commission. During her tenure, the Port of Seattle Commission introduced numerous reforms to expand Commission and staff accountability and transparency; invested in clean air programs; adopted an innovative aviation clean fuels strategy; and spent <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> <b>million</b> <b>of</b> dollars to begin early-action clean-up of the Lower Duwamish River, a Superfund Clean-Up site.
