5|$|SST Records {{released}} Double Nickels on <b>the</b> <b>Dime</b> {{on double}} vinyl in July 1984. SST delayed {{the release of}} Zen Arcade by Hüsker Dü so that both albums could be released simultaneously. After the release of Double Nickels on <b>the</b> <b>Dime,</b> Minutemen toured almost constantly to promote the record. One 1984 tour saw the band playing 57 dates in 63 days. The album sold fifteen thousand copies during 1984, a respectable amount for a band on an independent record label. As of 2008, Double Nickels on <b>the</b> <b>Dime</b> remains Minutemen's best-selling record.|$|E
5|$|Double Nickels on <b>the</b> <b>Dime</b> is {{the third}} studio album by American punk trio Minutemen, {{released}} on the Californian independent record label SST Records in 1984. A double album containing 45 songs, Double Nickels on <b>the</b> <b>Dime</b> combines elements of punk rock, funk, country, spoken word and jazz, and references a variety of themes, from the Vietnam War and racism in America, to working class experience and linguistics.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Dime</b> Store was a {{short-lived}} restaurant in Portland, Oregon, in the United States. It {{was established by}} Dayna McErlean, with additional conceptual development from Jeremy Larter. The restaurant opened in 2014, replacing Leo's Non-Smoking Coffee Shop, a diner which had operated for thirty years. <b>The</b> <b>Dime</b> Store's menu included diner classics such as burgers and milkshakes, along with all-day breakfast and weekend brunch specials. Despite receiving a positive critical reception, the restaurant closed in November 2015.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Dimes</b> are an American folk-pop {{band from}} Portland, Oregon. While <b>The</b> <b>Dimes</b> have {{released}} four EPs {{under their own}} self-titled label, <b>The</b> <b>Dimes,</b> their album, <b>The</b> Silent Generation, recorded under the label Pet Marmoset, is considered their debut album. The songs on The Silent Generation were largely based on stories which singer-songwriter Johnny Clay read in Depression-era newspapers, and which guitarist Pierre Kaiser found under the floorboards of his 1908 Portland home. The album was released in December 2007 to positive critical reviews. Their song [...] "Jersey Kid" [...] was featured on NPR Music's Second Stage.|$|R

The restaurant's weekend brunch launched in July, offering a larger menu from 9am to 3pm.|$|E
5|$|Since its introduction, the Roosevelt dime {{has been}} struck {{continuously}} in large numbers. The Mint transitioned from striking the coin in silver to base metal in 1965, {{and the design}} remains essentially unaltered from when Sinnock created it. Without rare dates or silver content, <b>the</b> <b>dime</b> is less widely sought by coin collectors than other modern U.S. coins.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the first}} half of 1894, just 24 proofs of <b>the</b> Barber series <b>dimes</b> were {{manufactured}} at the San Francisco Mint. Just why only 24 of the coins were minted is unknown. The superintendent of the San Francisco Mint is said to have had them minted as gifts for some important bankers. Another theory is that the mint's annual audit showed a discrepancy of $2.40, so <b>the</b> <b>dimes</b> were struck to compensate for this. [...] Three of <b>the</b> <b>dimes</b> were said to have been given to the superintendent's daughter, who allegedly spent one on a dish of ice cream and sold the other two in the 1950s.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Dime</b> Store was a {{restaurant}} {{housed in the}} first floor corner of the Medical Dental Building (837 Southwest 11th Avenue) in downtown Portland. Its menu was created by Claire Miller and included American diner classics such as burgers, ice cream floats, milkshakes, sundaes, and other desserts, as well as upscale diner food and healthy food options with a farmers' market influence.|$|E
5|$|The song's {{music video}} was filmed in various {{locations}} in Albuquerque and Portland. Among the areas filmed included the Rio Grande, junkyards, and near Mercer's home. The clip {{was directed by}} Lance Bangs, an associate of Spike Jonze. It features the band re-enacting the cover art of other bands' albums, including Zen Arcade and New Day Rising by Hüsker Dü, Let It Be by The Replacements, Moon Pix by Cat Power, Double Nickels on <b>the</b> <b>Dime</b> by The Minutemen, Squirrel Bait's first EP, Sonic Youth's Sister and Slint's Spiderland. Shooting in just two cities created logistical problems for album covers originally photographed {{in cities such as}} Los Angeles, Minneapolis, and Louisville. For the homage to Double Nickels on <b>the</b> <b>Dime,</b> the band had to track down the exact model of the car featured on the album cover (a Volkswagen Beetle), and Albuquerque happened to have a San Pedro Street, which is featured on a freeway sign on the original cover.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1880s, there were {{increasing}} {{calls for the}} replacement of the Seated Liberty design, used since the 1830s on most denominations of silver coins. In 1891, Mint Director Edward O. Leech, having been authorized by Congress to approve coin redesigns, ordered a competition, seeking a new look for the silver coins. As only the winner would receive a cash prize, invited artists refused to participate and no entry from the public proved suitable. Leech instructed Barber to prepare new designs for <b>the</b> <b>dime,</b> quarter, and half dollar, and after the chief engraver made changes to secure Leech's endorsement, they were approved by President Benjamin Harrison in November 1891. Striking of the new coins began the following January.|$|E

50|$|In mid-2010, <b>The</b> <b>Dimes</b> {{released}} an EP, William Dawes and other Forgotten Gems, of B-sides from the King record sessions, which featured some older songs {{that had long}} been part of their live show.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> Roosevelt <b>dime</b> is <b>the</b> current <b>dime,</b> or ten-cent piece, of the United States. Struck by the United States Mint {{continuously}} since 1946, it displays President Franklin D. Roosevelt on the obverse and {{was authorized}} {{soon after his}} death in 1945.|$|R
5|$|In 1915, a new Mint director, Robert W. Woolley, took office. Woolley {{advocated}} {{the replacement of}} the silver coins when it was legal to do so, and instructed Barber and Morgan to prepare new designs. He consulted with the Commission of Fine Arts, asking them to examine the designs produced by the Mint's engravers and, if they felt they were not suitable, to recommend artists to design the new coins. The Commission rejected the Barber and Morgan designs and proposed Adolph Weinman, Hermon MacNeil, and Albin Polasek as designers. Although Woolley had hoped that each artist would produce one design, different concepts by Weinman were accepted for <b>the</b> <b>dime</b> and half dollar, and one by MacNeil for the quarter.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Indiana Representative Mark Souder {{proposed}} that former president Ronald Reagan, {{who was then}} dying of Alzheimer's disease, replace Roosevelt on <b>the</b> <b>dime</b> once he died, stating that Reagan was as iconic to conservatives as Roosevelt was to liberals. Reagan's wife Nancy expressed her opposition, stating that she was certain the former president would not have favored it either. After Ronald Reagan died in 2004, there was support for a design change, but Souder declined to pursue his proposal.|$|E
5|$|The Senate {{considered}} the bill between June 22 and 24, 1965. An amendment by Rhode Island Senator John Pastore to remove silver entirely from the half dollar failed, 32—60. A number of senators wished to retain silver in <b>the</b> <b>dime</b> and quarter, {{and called for}} them to be made from 40 percent silver, but an amendment to that effect was defeated. There were other failed amendments, including one by Bible to prohibit melting of silver coins by the public. Robertson was determined to prevent any changes to the bill, which had been unanimously approved by his committee, and each attempt failed. The bill passed the Senate, 74—9, the opponents being Bible and other Western senators.|$|E

500|$|The {{death of}} President Franklin Roosevelt in April 1945 brought {{immediate}} {{calls for a}} coin to be issued with his image. As Roosevelt had been closely associated with <b>the</b> March of <b>Dimes,</b> and as <b>the</b> <b>dime's</b> design could be replaced {{without the need for}} congressional action as it had been struck for more than 25years, the Treasury chose that denomination to honor Roosevelt. [...] Mint Chief Engraver John R. Sinnock, Morgan's successor, executed the design featuring Roosevelt, which replaced <b>the</b> Mercury <b>dime</b> in 1946, making 1945 the last year in which it was produced. [...] According to Mint Director Nellie Tayloe Ross, a total of 2,677,232,488 Mercury dimes were struck.|$|R
500|$|Due to {{the large}} numbers struck, few regular-issue Roosevelt dimes command a premium, and the series has {{received}} relatively little attention from collectors. Only clad coins remain in circulation: prominent among these are <b>the</b> <b>dimes</b> struck at Philadelphia in 1982 erroneously minted and released without the mint mark [...] "P"; these may sell for $50 to $75. As no official mint sets were issued in 1982 or 1983, even ordinary dimes of those years from Philadelphia or Denver in pristine condition command a significant premium (worn ones do not). Far more expensive are <b>the</b> <b>dimes</b> erroneously issued in proof condition in 1970, 1975 and 1983 that lack the [...] "S" [...] mint mark. One of only two known from 1975 sold at auction in 2011 for $349,600.|$|R
5|$|The obverse of <b>the</b> <b>dime</b> depicts President Roosevelt, {{with the}} {{inscriptions}} LIBERTY and IN GOD WE TRUST. Sinnock's initials, JS, are {{found by the}} cutoff of the bust, {{to the left of}} the date. The reverse shows a torch in the center, representing liberty, flanked by an olive sprig representing peace, and one of oak symbolizing strength and independence. The inscription E PLURIBUS UNUM (out of many, one) stretches across the field. The name of the country and the value of the coin are the legends that surround the reverse design, which is symbolic of the victorious end of World War II.|$|E
5|$|The {{restaurant}} replaced Leo's Non-Smoking Coffee Shop, {{which was}} owned by Peter and Jane Chan for thirty years. When Leo's closed in February 2014, rumors had already circulated about restaurateur and developer Dayna McErlean's {{plans to open a}} more upscale diner. <b>The</b> <b>Dime</b> Store's concept was created by McErlean and Jeremy Larter, and was inspired by the soda shops they both experienced growing up on the East Coast. Prior to the restaurant's opening, plans were to serve breakfast and lunch during mid-week hours, with the potential to later add happy hour and family-friendly dinner options, as well as outdoor seating.|$|E
5|$|A public {{announcement}} of the new pieces was made on May 15, 1965, only to be met with a storm of objections. Both the public and many congressmen saw the issue as a poor use of Mint resources {{at a time of}} severe coin shortages, which would only benefit coin dealers. On May 24, one day before a hastily called congressional hearing, Adams announced that the pieces were deemed trial strikes, never intended for circulation. The Mint later stated that 316,076 pieces had been struck; all were reported melted amid heavy security. To ensure {{that there would be no}} repetition, Congress inserted a provision in the Coinage Act of 1965 forbidding the coinage of silver dollars for five years. That act also removed silver from <b>the</b> <b>dime</b> and quarter, and reduced the silver content of the half dollar to 40%.|$|E

50|$|Another {{controversy}} that surrounded <b>the</b> Roosevelt <b>dime</b> following its public release was an allegation that Sinnock copied or borrowed {{the design of}} the President's profile from a bronze bas relief created by sculptress Selma H. Burke for <b>the</b> <b>dime's</b> obverse. Sinnock denied this claim and said that the obverse portrait of the President was a composite of two studies which he made from life in 1933 and 1934. Sinnock said that he also consulted photographs of FDR and had the advice and criticism of two prominent sculptors who specialize in work in relief.|$|R

5|$|In 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt {{started to}} push for {{improvements}} to U.S. coins, and arranged for the Mint to engage Saint-Gaudens to redesign coins which could be changed under the 1890 act. Before his death in 1907, the sculptor provided designs for the double eagle and eagle, though the double eagle required adjustment by Barber to lower the relief {{before it could be}} released as a circulating coin. Redesign of the smaller gold pieces, Lincoln cent, and Buffalo nickel followed between 1908 and 1913. By then, <b>the</b> <b>dime,</b> quarter, and half dollar were the only coins being struck which had not received a redesign in the 20th century. As the 1916 date approached when the Barber coins could be changed without an act of Congress, calls for a new design increased.|$|E
5|$|With the Coinage Act of 1873, {{the dollar}} {{was no longer}} {{equivalent}} to a set amount of silver, a statutory change made so that {{as the price of}} silver dropped with increased U.S. production, mining companies could not present their bullion at the mints and receive it back, struck into silver dollars worth more as money than they were as metal. By the post-World War II era, the Bureau of the Mint was striking the three remaining precious metal coins, <b>the</b> <b>dime,</b> quarter and half dollar in 90 percent silver—the dollar had not been coined since 1935 and circulated little outside some Western states like Nevada and Montana. The metal in a silver dollar was worth more as bullion than as money above $1.2929 per troy ounce; the smaller coins would be attractive for the melting pot above $1.38 per ounce.|$|E
5|$|On October 16, 1890, a new Mint director, Edward O. Leech, took office. Leech, aged 38 at the time, {{had spent}} his career at the Bureau of the Mint, and was an {{enthusiastic}} supporter of redesign. He took the precaution of obtaining recommendations from Barber as to suitable outside artists who might participate in a competition. Since most of the proposed artists were New York-based, Andrew Mason, superintendent of the New York Assay Office, was given the task of finalizing the list of invitees. Leading Mason's list of ten names was that of Saint-Gaudens. Mason sent Leech the recommendations on April 3, 1891; the following day, the Mint director announced the competition, open to the public, but he specifically invited the ten artists named by Mason to participate. Besides Saint-Gaudens, artists asked to compete included Daniel Chester French, Herbert Adams, and Kenyon Cox. Although Barber had warned the director that reputable artists would likely not enter a contest in which only the winner received compensation, Leech offered a $500 prize to the winner, and no payments to anyone else. He sought new designs for {{both sides of the}} dollar, and for the obverses of the half dollar, quarter, and dime—Leech was content to let the reverses of the Seated Liberty coins continue. By law, an eagle had to appear on the quarter and half dollar, but could not appear on <b>the</b> <b>dime.</b>|$|E
