40|$|Abstract: We have coated {{the silicon}} field {{emission}} tips with diamond-like carbon (DLC). <b>The</b> array of <b>tips</b> {{was made of}} n-type silicon using conventional dry etch. Before DLC coating, <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> were bombarded with argon ion to clean the surface. We found that this bombardment improved the aspect ratio of <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> and <b>the</b> DLC adhesion to <b>the</b> silicon <b>tips.</b> <b>The</b> DLC film was coated using radio frequency plasma assisted-CVD using CgHg gas. Initially, the end of <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> was coated with ball-shape DLC. The current-voltage curve was measured in Torr pressure. <b>The</b> DLC-coated <b>tips</b> emitted current at lower onset voltage than as-prepared silicon tips. 1...|$|R
5|$|The {{basic unit}} of {{measurement}} used during construction was the tala, defined as {{the length of a}} human face from the forehead's hairline to <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of the chin or the distance from <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of the thumb to <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of the middle finger when both fingers are stretched at their maximum distance. The unit is thus relative from one individual to the next, but the monument has exact measurements. A survey conducted in 1977 revealed frequent findings of a ratio of 4:6:9 around the monument. The architect had used the formula to lay out the precise dimensions of the fractal and self-similar geometry in Borobudur's design. This ratio is also found in the designs of Pawon and Mendut, nearby Buddhist temples. Archeologists have conjectured that the 4:6:9 ratio and the tala have calendrical, astronomical and cosmological significance, {{as is the case with}} the temple of Angkor Wat in Cambodia.|$|E

5|$|A {{plate of}} hard horny tissue at <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of the beak of all {{birds in the}} family Anatidae (ducks, geese and swans). This shield-shaped structure, which {{sometimes}} spans the entire width of the beak, is often bent at <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> to form a hook. It serves different purposes depending on the bird's primary food source. Most species use their nails to dig seeds out of mud or vegetation, while diving ducks use theirs to pry molluscs from rocks. There {{is evidence that the}} nail may help a bird to grasp things; species which use strong grasping motions to secure their food (such as when catching and holding onto a large squirming frog) have very wide nails. Certain types of mechanoreceptors, nerve cells that are sensitive to pressure, vibration or touch, are located under the nail.|$|E
5|$|Antbirds are {{generally}} small birds with rounded wings and strong legs. They have mostly sombre grey, white, brown and rufous plumage, which is sexually dimorphic in pattern and colouring.

5|$|Apart from pit-trap-forming taxa, {{the biology}} {{of members of the}} family Myrmeleontidae, to which the antlions belong, has been little studied.

40|$|Issue: Wood waste {{processors}} must set {{a tipping}} fee (receiving charge) that allows their {{business to be}} profitable. <b>The</b> <b>tipping</b> fee must cover expenses yet, remain competitive with other local recycling or disposal options. Also, an acceptable profit margin per unit (cubic yard or ton) of incoming material should be considered. Establishing a tipping fee ensures that the facility operates profitably. Best Practice: This Best Practice outlines the process for determining <b>the</b> <b>tipping</b> fee at a new or existing facility. Implementation: <b>The</b> <b>tipping</b> fee is perhaps the only variable of the facility’s financial system. Therefore, calculating <b>the</b> desired <b>tipping</b> fee requires “working backwards. ” The cost to process the wood waste (processing costs) {{is determined by the}} facility’s monthly operating expenses and payment capital expenditures. <b>The</b> <b>tipping</b> fee (per unit basis) is determined by dividing <b>the</b> total <b>tipping</b> revenue by <b>the</b> material tonnage or cubic yards of incoming material. Therefore to determine <b>the</b> <b>tipping</b> fee, <b>the</b> <b>tipping</b> revenue must first be calculated using <b>the</b> following equation: <b>Tipping</b> Revenues = (Processing Costs + Profit Margin) - Material Revenues where: 1. Processing Costs = Monthly Operating Expenses + Monthly Payments on Capital Expenditures. Operating Expenses. These expenses are necessary costs to remain in business and typically include the following: • Labor; • Disposal Costs For Removed Contaminants • Overhead (e. g., benefits...|$|R

5|$|As {{with other}} early sauropodomorphs, {{it has been}} {{proposed}} that Massospondylus had cheeks. This theory was proposed {{because there are a}} few large holes for blood vessels on the surfaces of the jaw bones, unlike the numerous small holes present on the jaws of cheekless reptiles. The cheeks would have prevented food from spilling out when Massospondylus ate. Crompton and Attridge (1986) described skulls of Massospondylus as possessing pronounced overbites and suggested the presence of a horny beak on <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of the lower jaw {{to make up the difference}} in length and account for tooth wear on the teeth at <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of the snout. However, the difference in length may be a misinterpretation based on crushing in a top–bottom plane, and the possession of a beak is considered unlikely in recent studies.|$|E
5|$|At 6.8 to 9.2 (7.7) mm, {{males are}} only about half as long as females. Their maximum width is 34 to 42 (37) μm. The length of the {{esophagus}} is 2.3 to 3.0 (2.6) mm, of which the muscular pharynx makes up 260 to 315 (273) μm, and is lined by 35 to 42 (37) stichocytes. The back region of the worm is 4.5 to 6.2 (5.1) mm long. The back, or rectal, opening of the digestive tube is located {{near the end of}} the worm, and the length of the cloaca is 530 to 576 (550) μm. Near the back end, there are two alae (ridges) at the sides (laterally), which are 40 to 55 (46) μm long; these are located at 10 to 15 μm from another, small ala at <b>the</b> <b>tip.</b> In A.putorii, the lateral alae are much longer and reach the ala at <b>the</b> <b>tip.</b> The spicule, a spikelike structure that functions in reproduction, is curved at <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> and hardened and has a length of 380 to 426 (406) μm. It is smaller than that of the similar A.tamiasstriati from North American chipmunks and larger than that of A.murissylvatici from various North American and European small rodents, but about as long as that of A.putorii, which however lacks the curved tip.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a method to}} monitor the distance between two tips of a {{scanning near-field optical microscope}} setup.

The resulting signal, called crosstalk, increases sharply only when <b>the</b> scanning <b>tip</b> comes into <b>the</b> immediate vicinity of the stationary one. This effect allows us to prevent <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> from colliding during scanning...|$|R

5|$|Ceratopsians {{are easily}} {{recognized}} by {{features of the}} skull. On <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of a ceratopsian upper jaw is the rostral bone, an edentulous (toothless) ossification, unique to ceratopsians. Othniel Charles Marsh recognized and named this bone, which acts as {{a mirror image of}} the predentary bone on the lower jaw. This ossification evolved to morphologically aid the mastication of plant matter. Along with the predentary bone, which forms <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of the lower jaw in all ornithischians, the rostral forms a superficially parrot-like beak. Also, the jugal bones below the eye are very tall and flare out sideways, making the skull appear somewhat triangular when viewed from above. This triangular appearance is accentuated in later ceratopsians by the rearwards extension of the parietal and squamosal bones of the skull roof, to form the neck frill.|$|E
