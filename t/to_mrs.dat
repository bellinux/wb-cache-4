5|$|Bellingham was immortalized as {{a fictional}} {{character}} in Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter, as {{the brother of}} Ann Hibbins, {{a woman who was}} executed (in real life in 1656, {{as well as in the}} book) for practicing witchcraft. There are apparently no contemporary references <b>to</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Hibbins as Bellingham's sister—Hawthorne's formation of this connection appears to be based on a footnote in James Savage's 1825 edition of John Winthrop's journals, and a genealogical tree of the Bellinghams published early in the 20th century does not mention her. However, Ann Hibbins' second husband, William Hibbins, was first married to Richard Bellingham's sister Hester but she died a year later and was buried in England. Bellingham also appears in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's The New England Tragedies, which fictionalizes events dealing with the Quakers.|$|E

By 1921, it was recorded that Shetlands could not be bought in the U.S. (The Sheep Breeder, 1921). It was not until the mid-twentieth century that Shetlands were imported into Canada, and then from Canada into the United States in the 1980s. Since then, a North American Shetland Sheep Registry has been established, and there are now thousands of the breed in the region.|$|E

40|$|Proton MR {{spectroscopy}} (MRS) allows noninvasive {{characterization of}} chemical-pathologic {{changes in the}} brain. In patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), proton MRS reveals chemical pathology in focal inflammatory lesions {{as well as in}} regions of the brain that are not associated with structural abnormalities on conventional MRI. In MS studies, it has been particularly useful as a method for the assessment of neurodegeneration based on decreases in the levels of the neuro-axonal marker compound, N-acetylaspartate. Also, MRS has provided evidence of chemical pathology and repair involving non-neuronal brain cells based on changes in metabolites, including choline, myo-inositol, glutamate, and GABA. Despite its greater pathologic specificity for axonal integrity compared <b>to</b> conventional MRI, <b>MRS</b> has been used only infrequently in clinical trials.

Daphne gets back together with Shane and they become engaged, but she starts to have doubts about whether she is moving on too quickly. When Des learns that he is not Bradley's father, he tries to win Daphne back. Shane becomes jealous of Daphne and Des's friendship and when he verbally attacks them, Daphne breaks up with him. She gets back together with Des and they eventually marry. Daphne and Des become Mike Young's legal guardians when they learn that he comes from a violent home. Daphne helps Mike when he is banned from seeing Jane Harris (Annie Jones) by her grandmother, Mrs. Mangel (Vivean Gray). Daphne soon discovers that Sue Parker (Kate Gorman) has been sending poison pen letters about Mike <b>to</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Mangel and exposes her. Daphne contracts meningitis, but she recovers and then learns that she is pregnant. Daphne and Des's marriage becomes strained when she learns that he has been in contact with Lorraine.

5|$|In September 1858, the Brazier family accused Mrs Mole, a labourer's {{wife who}} lived in East Thorpe, Essex, of bewitching their {{daughter}} and livestock. Hoping to have the bewitchment removed, they consulted a local cunning-man known as Burrell, who lived at nearby Copford. When Burrell was unable to help, they proceeded to consult Murrell, inviting {{him to come to}} East Thorpe to remove the curse. Murrell's planned visit generated much anticipation in East Thorpe's community, with the local rector attempting to calm the situation by requesting that the parish relieving officer move the allegedly bewitched girl to the union-house, where she could be examined by the parish surgeon. Nevertheless, the officer of the poor refused to comply, asserting that Murrell's arrival would correct the problem. Persisting, the rector applied to the local magistrate to ensure that police would be in the village on the day of Murrell's arrival, to ensure that the crowd would be controlled. On the day itself, a crowd of two hundred had gathered, and proceeded <b>to</b> <b>Mrs</b> Mole's house with the intention of carrying out folk justice; concerned by this illegal behaviour, the rector stood outside of her door and forbade the crowd entry, prior to police arriving and dispersing the mob.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} mapping between two {{semantic}} formalisms, namely the tectogrammatical {{layer of the}} Prague Dependency Treebank 2. 0 (PDT) and (Robust) Minimal Recursion Semantics ((R) MRS). It is a first attempt to relate the dependency-based annotation scheme of PDT to a compositional semantics approach like (R) MRS. A mapping algorithm that converts PDT trees <b>to</b> (R) <b>MRS</b> structures is developed, associating (R) <b>MRSs</b> <b>to</b> each node on the dependency tree. Furthermore, composition rules are formulated and the relation between dependency in PDT and semantic heads in (R) MRS is analyzed. It turns out that structure and dependencies, morphological categories and some coreferences can be preserved in the target structures. Moreover, valency and free modifications are distinguished using the valency dictionary of PDT as an additional resource. The validation results show that systematically correct underspecified target representations {{can be obtained by}} a rule-based mapping approach, which is an indicator that (R) MRS is indeed robust in relation to the formal representation of Czech data. This finding is novel, as Czech, with its free word order and rich morphology, is typologically different than languages analyzed with (R) <b>MRS</b> <b>to</b> date. 1...|$|R
