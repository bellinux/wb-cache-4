5|$|The encounter: Once {{the prey}} detects <b>the</b> <b>wolves,</b> it can either {{approach}} <b>the</b> <b>wolves,</b> stand its ground, or flee. Large prey, such as moose, elk, and muskoxen, usually stand their ground. Should this occur, <b>the</b> <b>wolves</b> hold back, as they require the stimulus of a running animal {{to proceed with}} an attack. If the targeted animal stands its ground, <b>the</b> <b>wolves</b> either ignore it, or try to intimidate it into running.|$|E
5|$|The stalk: <b>The</b> <b>wolves</b> {{attempt to}} conceal {{themselves}} as they approach. As the gap between <b>the</b> <b>wolves</b> and their prey closes, <b>the</b> <b>wolves</b> quicken their pace, wag their tails, and peer intently, getting as close to their quarry as possible without making it flee.|$|E
5|$|In the {{off-season}} Breslin again re-signed with <b>the</b> <b>Wolves.</b> Chicago also brought in John Anderson {{to be the}} team's new head coach. Under Anderson, Breslin had posted a career high in assists with 26 and games played with 81. Chicago won the West division and finished with the second-best record in the league. In the postseason <b>the</b> <b>Wolves</b> stormed through the first three rounds, losing only four games, {{to advance to the}} 1998 Turner Cup Finals. In game 1 of the finals against the Detroit Vipers, Chicago blew a two-goal lead early in the third period. They regained the lead with just over eight minutes to play. In the final minutes of the game, Breslin added an insurance empty net goal giving <b>the</b> <b>Wolves</b> a 4–2 victory. It was Breslin's only goal of the playoffs. The series eventually went to a seventh and deciding game that <b>the</b> <b>Wolves</b> won 3–0 to capture the franchise's first Turner Cup. For the 1998–99 season Breslin's production dipped to 7 goals and 21 points. <b>The</b> <b>Wolves</b> advanced to the third round the playoffs, but Breslin played in only 4 of the team's 10 games. On the first day of training camp the following year, Breslin announced his retirement from professional hockey.|$|E

5000|$|When {{the hunters}} {{approach}} him, Mr. Dongguo denies {{any knowledge of}} <b>the</b> <b>wolf's</b> whereabouts. After <b>the</b> hunters had left, Mr. Dongguo lets <b>the</b> <b>wolf</b> out of his bag, got on his donkey, {{and was about to}} take his leave only to be stopped by <b>the</b> <b>wolf.</b> <b>The</b> <b>wolf</b> now asked <b>the</b> scholar to save his life again, this time from starvation. Mr. Dongguo offered <b>the</b> <b>wolf</b> some pastries, but <b>the</b> <b>wolf</b> smile and said [...] "I don't eat those, I dine solely on meat". Puzzled, Mr. Dongguo inquires if <b>the</b> <b>wolf</b> intended to eat his donkey and <b>the</b> <b>wolf</b> replies [...] "No, no, donkey meat is no good". The donkey, upon hearing this, bolts from the scene as fast as its four legs to carry it leaving Mr. Dongguo behind with <b>the</b> <b>wolf.</b> To Mr. Dongguo's surprise, <b>the</b> hungry <b>wolf</b> pounced on him and announced it intention to eat him. When Mr. Dongguo protests at <b>the</b> <b>wolf's</b> ingratitude, <b>the</b> <b>wolf</b> presents <b>the</b> argument: since the scholar saved his life once why not do it again? Now that it was starving, only by serving as <b>the</b> <b>wolf's</b> food will <b>the</b> scholar have fulfilled the act of saving his life. Besides, <b>the</b> <b>wolf</b> complained that it nearly suffocated while it was crammed in the scholar's bag and the scholar now owed him. Dongguo and <b>the</b> <b>wolf</b> debated and finally decided to present their case to the judgment of three elders.|$|R
5|$|Locating prey: <b>The</b> <b>wolves</b> {{travel in}} search of prey through their power of scent, chance encounter, and tracking. Wolves {{typically}} locate their prey by scent, though they must usually be directly downwind of it. When a breeze carrying the prey's scent is located, <b>the</b> <b>wolves</b> stand alert, and point their eyes, ears and nose towards their target. In open areas, wolves may precede the hunt with group ceremonies involving standing nose-to-nose and wagging their tails. Once concluded, <b>the</b> <b>wolves</b> head towards their prey.|$|E

The next week, Matt {{was one of many}} TNA wrestlers who stopped Dixie Carter from running away from Team 3D, which led to Carter being put through a table. On the August 14 episode of Impact Wrestling, Team 3D (formerly the Dudley Boyz) challenged The Hardys to a match, which Team 3D won. At the Hardcore Justice episode of Impact Wrestling, The Hardys and Team 3D talked about a match involving themselves and <b>The</b> <b>Wolves.</b> When <b>The</b> <b>Wolves</b> were asked by the two teams, they agreed. Later that night, Kurt Angle announced all three teams would compete in a best of three series for the TNA World Tag Team Championship with the winners of the first match choosing the stipulation of the next one. The Hardys won the second match of the series on the September 10 episode of Impact Wrestling in a tables match and choose a ladder match for the third match of the series. The Hardys were unsuccessful in winning that match on the September 17 episode of Impact Wrestling, as <b>the</b> <b>Wolves</b> won that match. <b>The</b> <b>Wolves</b> then went on to pick the final match of the series to be a Full Metal Mayhem match to take place on the October 8 episode of Impact Wrestling.

5|$|The Canucks {{completed}} their second {{season with the}} Chicago Wolves as American Hockey League affiliate, the final one under the two teams' contract. <b>The</b> <b>Wolves</b> started the season by winning their first four games {{for the second time}} in franchise history. The following games were not as fruitful as they lost five of their next six games and their starting goaltender Eddie Lack suffered a hip injury. The injury required surgery, and Lack missed the remainder of the season. With Lack out <b>the</b> <b>Wolves</b> finished fifteenth in the league for fewest goals allowed. The previous season they allowed the fifth fewest goals in the league. Lack and back-up Matt Climie set a franchise record for lowest team goals against average. With the league's nineteenth best offense, <b>the</b> <b>Wolves</b> were unable to overcome the goals against them and finished fourth in their division. Thus missing the playoffs. It was the second time in three years that <b>the</b> <b>Wolves</b> missed the playoffs, but only the fourth time in franchise history. Despite missing the playoffs, Chicago finished second in league attendance.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>wolf</b> quickly shuffles Red out {{the door}} and tries looking for Bugs in the basket.

50|$|Once {{the first}} two pigs join the third pig in his brick house, <b>the</b> <b>wolf</b> again dresses up - this time as a {{homeless}} woman playing a violin, while it's snowing outside (the 'snow' actually talcum powder held above <b>the</b> <b>wolf's</b> head on a stick). The first two pigs have pity on <b>the</b> <b>wolf,</b> and despite <b>the</b> third pig blocking the door, the two other pigs let <b>the</b> <b>wolf</b> in. When <b>the</b> <b>wolf</b> continues to play the violin, the third pig sees that <b>the</b> <b>wolf</b> has a record player hidden behind him. The third pig switches {{to the other side}} of the record, putting on a fast-paced dance. <b>The</b> <b>wolf</b> dances to this new tune, but loses his costume as a result. <b>The</b> <b>wolf</b> then chases <b>the</b> pigs up to the second floor of the house. The pigs make their escape in an elevator but when <b>the</b> <b>wolf</b> tries to use the elevator he drops into an empty shaft and falls at the feet of the pigs.|$|R
5|$|The rush: If {{the prey}} {{attempts}} to flee, <b>the</b> <b>wolves</b> immediately pursue it.

5|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} gray wolves recolonized the Bow Valley in Banff National Park. They had been absent for 30 years due to {{systematic}} predator control hunting {{which began in}} 1850. Wolves filtered back to Banff and recolonized one zone of the Bow Valley in 1985 and another in 1991. A high level of human use surrounding a third zone at Banff townsite has deterred <b>the</b> <b>wolves</b> from that area. <b>The</b> <b>wolves</b> are important in controlling elk populations and improve {{the balance of the}} ecosystem. A routine park study to monitor <b>the</b> <b>wolves</b> in Banff has now grown into the Southern Rockies Canine Project – the largest wolf research project in North America.
