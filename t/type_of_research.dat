5|$|In her research, Fraser worked {{predominantly}} in infectious disease, studying general infection, puerperal fever, {{scarlet fever}} and septic sore throat among other bacterial infections. She began studies on scarlet fever {{in the early}} 1930s, and along with Dr. Helen Plummer isolated the precipitin present in the strains of streptococci {{likely to lead to}} disease. These findings were important in determining the types of antitoxins which might be employed for immunization to neutralize the disease. The <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> Fraser was engaged in required that the bacteria of the disease which created a toxin be isolated, so that it could be injected into a horse. Repeated injections of small doses of toxin allowed the horse to become immune to the disease. The serum created from the blood of animals which had been immunized, contained an antibody (known at the time as an antitoxin), which could then be injected into humans to cure the disease. Development of the sulfonamides rendered immunization against scarlet fever unnecessary, but she continued to study other aspects of the disease. In 1941, she typed the streptococci of scarlet fever which was an important breakthrough for tracking the epidemiology of the disease. Fraser also conducted research in an attempt to develop an antigen for tuberculosis. With the development of penicillin, her research after 1947, shifted focus to the study of antibiotics including bacitracin, penicillin, polymixin, and subtilin. Fraser studied various preparations of penicillin against the tubercular bacillus and as a treatment for gonorrhoea. Rising through the ranks of assistant professor and associate professor, Fraser became a full professor in 1949 teaching preventative medicine for the Bachelor of Science or nursing degree for the remainder of her career. In 1955 Fraser was appointed as a professor of microbiology and held that post until her retirement a decade later.|$|E

25|$|There {{are also}} {{concerns}} regarding human genome research in developing countries. The tools for conducting whole genome analyses are generally found in high-income nations, necessitating partnerships between {{developed and developing}} countries in order to study the patients afflicted with certain diseases. The relevant tools for sharing access to the collected data are not equally accessible across low-income nations and without an established standard for this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>research,</b> concerns over fairness to local researchers remain unsettled.|$|E
25|$|Another {{approach}} {{to determine whether}} a non-human animal is conscious derives from passive speech research with a macaw (see Arielle). Some researchers propose that by passively listening to an animal's voluntary speech, it is possible to learn about the thoughts of another creature and to determine that the speaker is conscious. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> was originally used to investigate a child's crib speech by Weir (1962) and in investigations of early speech in children by Greenfield and others (1976).|$|E
25|$|Similar assays can be {{performed}} for research purposes, detecting concentrations of potential clinical candidates like anti-fungal and asthma drugs.

It is used as a method to confirm results of synthesis reactions, as purity is essential in this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>research.</b> However, mass spectrometry is still the more reliable way to identify species.|$|E

25|$|A second {{exception}} {{is to be}} found in the works of researchers who have employed resources from ethnomethodology and symbolic interactionism in studying legal settings. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> is clearly sociological rather than socio-legal research because it continually engages in debate with other theoretical traditions in sociology. Max Travers' doctoral thesis about the work of a firm of criminal lawyers took other sociologists, and especially Marxists, to task for not addressing or respecting how lawyers and clients understand their own actions (a standard argument used by ethnomethodologists in debates with structural traditions in the discipline). It also, however, explored issues raised by legal thinkers in their critique of structural traditions in sociology of law: the extent to which social science can address the content of legal practice.|$|E

2500|$|Most {{of these}} {{reported}} social effects {{are small and}} our understanding is incomplete.

2500|$|There are {{a number}} of {{chemicals}} intended to slow the aging process currently being studied in animal models.

[...] Some drugs that are already approved for other uses have been studied for possible longevity effects on laboratory animals because of a possible CR-mimic effect; they include rapamycin, metformin and other geroprotectors. MitoQ, resveratrol and pterostilbene are dietary supplements that have also been studied in this context.|$|E

2500|$|Because it {{is usually}} {{impossible}} to test everyone, research tends to be conducted on a sample of persons from the wider population. Social psychologists frequently use survey research when {{they are interested in}} results that are high in external validity. Surveys use various forms of random sampling to obtain a sample of respondents that are representative of a population. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> is usually descriptive or correlational because there is no experimental control over variables. However, new statistical methods like structural equation modeling are being used to test for potential causal relationships in this type of data. Some psychologists, including Dr. David Sears, have criticized social psychological research for relying too heavily on studies conducted on university undergraduates in academic settings. Over 70% of experiments in Sears' study used North American undergraduates as subjects, a subset of the population that may not be representative of the population as a whole.|$|E
2500|$|According to the NSA's {{historical}} account, [...] "Public Law 86-36 {{had served}} as a useful barrier against this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>research,</b> but Bamford proved to be cleverer than others. He began with a barrage of requests for information under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)." [...] Bamford eventually discovered [...] "the Mother Lode," [...] a collection of documents deposited at the Virginia Military Institute's George Marshall Library by former NSA chief cryptologist William Friedman. These documents included copies of the NSA Newsletter, addressed to [...] "NSA Employees and their families." [...] The account continues, [...] "Bamford then submitted a FOIA request for the entire collection, using as his rationale the offending phrase indicating that the information had been intended for dissemination to uncleared people." [...] The FOIA requests gave Bamford access to an only lightly redacted set of documents, and a former NSA employee later gave Bamford access to an almost complete collection.|$|E
2500|$|... "La bruxomanie" [...] (a French term, {{translates}} to bruxomania) was suggested by Marie Pietkiewics in 1907. In 1931, Frohman first {{coined the term}} bruxism. Occasionally recent medical publications will use the word bruxomania with bruxism, to denote specifically bruxism that occurs while awake; however, this term can be considered historical and the modern equivalent would be awake bruxism or diurnal bruxism. It {{has been shown that}} the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> into bruxism has changed over time. Overall between 1966 and 2007, most of the research published was focused on occlusal adjustments and oral splints. Behavioral approaches in research declined from over 60% of publications in the period 1966â€“86 to about 10% in the period 1997â€“2007. In the 1960s, a periodontist named Sigurd Peder Ramfjord championed the theory that occlusal factors were responsible for bruxism. Generations of dentists were educated by this ideology in the prominent textbook on occlusion of the time, however therapy centered around removal of occlusal interference remained unsatisfactory. The belief among dentists that occlusion and bruxism are strongly related is still widespread, however the majority of researchers now disfavor malocclusion as the main etiologic factor in favor of a more multifactorial, biopsychosocial model of bruxism.|$|E

2500|$|From this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> it {{has been}} {{inferred}} that whiplash symptoms might not always have any pathological (injury) explanation. [...] However, over the last decade, academic surgeons in the UK and US have sought to unravel the whiplash enigma. [...] A 1000-case, four-year observational study published in 2012 said that the [...] "missing link" [...] in whiplash injuries is the trapezius muscle which may be damaged through eccentric muscle contraction during the whiplash mechanism described above and below. [...] Another study suggested that [...] "shneck pain" [...] was in the nearby supraspinatus muscle and this resulted from a seemingly asymptomatic form of shoulder impingement. Shoulder impingement is commonly asymptomatic and the shoulder may be injured along with the neck in a motor vehicle accident. [...] Whiplash due to The Referred Shoulder Impingement Syndrome was successfully treated using conventional treatments for shoulder impingement including anti inflammatory steroids and non steroids, and by avoiding the overhead position of shoulder impingement {{during the day and}} night time. [...] All of this work demonstrates that historically and indeed presently whiplash patients' pain sources may be missed if it is outside of the neck. [...] Hence the pathology in whiplash may have been missed and the treatment ineffective.|$|E
