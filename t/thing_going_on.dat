500|$|In December 2005, Timberlake {{began working}} on his second album, FutureSex/LoveSounds, the {{follow-up}} to Justified (2002). Within three weeks, [...] "My Love" [...] {{was one of several}} songs that were recorded. In September 2006, Timberlake told Rolling Stone that the song was [...] "a hip-hop ballad" [...] and that the process of creating [...] "took two hours to imagine and execute". While promoting the album in an interview with MTV News, Timberlake revealed that {{the second half of the}} album (including [...] "My Love") focuses on anthems of love. In another interview, he revealed that [...] "My Love" [...] was a [...] "contradiction of sounds. You've got this operatic <b>thing</b> <b>going</b> <b>on.</b> If you take all the staccato sounds out, the essence of the song is it's a ballad, but the way the beat is inlaid underneath the vocals, it becomes a percussive ballad." ...|$|E
500|$|Directed by Nick Marck, [...] "My Mother, the Fiend" [...] {{was written}} by Phil Klemmer and Dayna Lynne North. The episode marks Klemmer's eighth writing credit, the fifth and {{penultimate}} writing credit for North, and Marck's seventh directing credit. Despite being credited, Wallace (Percy Daggs III), Dick (Ryan Hansen), and Jackie (Tessa Thompson) do {{not appear in the}} episode. Among the episode's guest stars are Alyson Hannigan and Charisma Carpenter, who portray Trina Echolls and Kendall Casablancas, respectively. The two previously starred together in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, with Hannigan playing Willow Rosenberg and Carpenter portraying Cordelia Chase. Although the two characters had appeared previously, they had never shared a scene together. Jason Dohring, who portrays Logan, stated that he had a special connection with Hannigan on-set: [...] "We get together and just tease each other, she sucker-punches me. There's just a total, I don't know, we really have a sister-brother <b>thing</b> <b>going</b> <b>on.</b> I've never had that kind of connection with an actress before. It totally works." [...] Dohring also noted that Hannigan responded strongly to any spoilers that she was given during filming of the episode.|$|E

500|$|Barkley is {{an outspoken}} {{supporter}} of gay rights. In 2006, he told Fox Sports: [...] "I'm a big advocate of gay marriage. If {{they want to}} get married, God bless them." [...] Speaking to Wolf Blitzer on CNN two years later, he said: [...] "Every time I hear the word 'conservative,' it makes me sick to my stomach, because they're really just fake Christians, as I call them. That's all they are. ... I think they want to be judge and jury. Like, I'm for gay marriage. It's none of my business if gay people want to get married. I'm pro-choice. And I think these Christians, first of all, they're not supposed to judge other people. But they're the most hypocritical judge of people we have in the country. And it bugs the hell out of me. They act like they're Christians. They're not forgiving at all." [...] During a 2011 Martin Luther King, Jr. Day double-header on TNT, Barkley responded to a statement made by Dr. King's daughter Bernice, by saying, [...] "People try to make it about black and white. [...] he talked about equality for every man, every woman. We have a <b>thing</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> now, people discriminating against homosexuality in this country.

You don't have to exonerate the appalling deeds of Osama bin Laden and his associates, if it be Osama bin Laden, to say who brought this down, who contributed to this, a number of factors.

2500|$|Bickers and Chadwick seemed {{confident}} that age, perspective and situation {{meant that they}} could avoid the problems which had divided the band in 1990. Interviewed {{at the time of}} the release of Days Run Away, Chadwick admitted acceptance of the fact that [...] "we're really different people. It's a very complex kind of friendship, and I think it'll always be slightly fractious. We don't have this huge buddy <b>thing</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> though at the same time it's very intimate... We've always had a very instinctive way of communicating with each other, which I guess is why we make good music together." [...] Bickers in turn reflected [...] "I think we're both old enough and ugly enough to address any issues head-on and keep our tempers in check. We're also doing things at our own pace rather than letting a record company dictate what we do, which helps... It's still early days but communication is good and so is the music. This is about letting bygones be bygones and just getting on with it. Personally, I've never been happier." ...|$|E

When asked whether he had worked on the earlier version of Diablo III prior to the shutdown of Blizzard North, he responded, [...] "I guess at this point I can say, yes, more or less.

2500|$|McGeoch's guitar {{playing in}} {{particular}} was singled out for praise by critics and musicians. Mojo honoured him in 2006 by placing him in their list of the 100 greatest guitarists ever {{for his work on}} [...] "Spellbound". Johnny Marr of The Smiths said on BBC Radio 2 in February 2008 that he also rated McGeoch highly for his work on [...] "Spellbound". Marr qualified it as [...] "clever", with a [...] "really good picky <b>thing</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> which is very un-rock'n'roll". In Uncut, Marr also rated McGeoch as his 10th favourite guitarist for his work on Juju and Real Life by Magazine. Another member of The Smiths, singer Morrissey, commented on [...] "Spellbound" [...] during an interview for the US KROQ-FM radio station in 1997: [...] "Another great single. A hit in England. Certainly not here, I don't think. But they were one of the great groups of the late '70s, early '80s. [...] Siouxsie and the Banshees were excellent [...] " [...] Morrissey later named Juju as a major album of the Banshees.|$|E
2500|$|Eerie, Indiana {{was well}} {{received}} by critics when it debuted on television. Entertainment Weekly {{gave it a}} [...] "B" [...] rating and Ken Tucker wrote, [...] "You watch Eerie for the small-screen spectacle of it all — to see the way, in the show's first few weeks, feature-film directors like Joe Dante (Gremlins) and Tim Hunter (River's Edge) oversaw episodes that summoned up an atmosphere of absurdist suburban dread." [...] In his review for The Hollywood Reporter, Miles Beller wrote, [...] "Scripted by Karl Schaefer and José Rivera with smart, sharp insights; slyly directed by feature film helmsman Joe Dante; and given edgy life by the show's winning cast, Eerie, Indiana shapes up {{as one of the}} fall season's standouts, a newcomer that has the fresh, bracing look of Edward Scissorhands and scores as a clever, wry presentation well worth watching." [...] In his review for the Orange County Register, Ray Richmond wrote, [...] "It's the kind of knowingly hip series with equally strong appeal for both kids and adults, the kind that preteens will watch and discuss." [...] USA Today described the show as [...] "Stephen King by way of The Simpsons", and Matt Roush wrote, [...] "Eerie recalls Edward Scissorhands and even – heaven help it – David Lynch in its garish nightmare-comedy depiction of the lurid and silly horrors that lurk beneath suburban conformity." [...] In his review for the Washington Times, David Klinghoffer wrote, [...] "Everything about the pilot exceeds the normal minimal expectations of TV. Mr. Dante directs as if he were making a movie, and a good one. In a departure from usual TV operating procedures, he sometimes actually has more than one <b>thing</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> on screen at the same time!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The two songwriters of the Smiths {{cited the}} band; singer Morrissey said that [...] "Siouxsie and the Banshees were excellent", and that [...] "they {{were one of}} the great groups of the late 70s, early 80s". He also said in 1994, [...] "If you study modern groups, those who gain press {{coverage}} and chart action, none of them are as good as Siouxsie and the Banshees at full pelt. That's not dusty nostalgia, that's fact". Guitarist Johnny Marr, mentioned his liking for Banshees guitarist John McGeoch and his contribution to the single [...] "Spellbound". Marr qualified it as [...] "clever" [...] with a [...] "really good picky <b>thing</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> which is very un-rock'n'roll". U2 cited Siouxsie and the Banshees as a major influence and selected [...] "Christine" [...] for a Mojo compilation. The Edge was the presenter of an award given to Siouxsie at the Mojo ceremony in 2005. In December 1981, Dave Gahan of Depeche Mode named the Banshees as one of his three favourite bands along with Sparks and Roxy Music. Gahan later hailed the single [...] "Candyman" [...] at its release, saying, [...] "This is a great Banshees record, I like their sound". Jim Reid of the Jesus and Mary Chain selected [...] "Jigsaw Feeling" [...] from The Scream as being among his favourite songs. Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth cited [...] "Hong Kong Garden" [...] in his top 25 all-time favourite songs, and Kevin Shields of My Bloody Valentine also mentioned them as being among his early influences. Dave Navarro of Jane's Addiction once noted a parallel between his band and the Banshees: [...] "There are so many similar threads: melody, use of sound, attitude, sex-appeal. I always saw Jane's Addiction as the masculine Siouxsie and the Banshees". Primal Scream's Bobby Gillespie liked the group's ability to produce pop songs while transmitting something subversive. He said, [...] "They were outsiders bringing outsider subjects to the mainstream. We’re not trying to rip off the Banshees, but that's kind of where we’re coming from".|$|E
