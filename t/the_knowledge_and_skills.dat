40|$|Purpose - This {{research}} aims {{to investigate}} the feasibility of a systematic Lean Six Sigma (LSS) education through the curriculum of business schools {{to respond to the}} existing gap between the graduate’s expectation of employability <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> requirements by the Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs). Design/approach/methodology - One UK business school {{has been used as a}} case study to conduct an extensive module and programme review followed by a semi-structured interview with the potentially suitable core and programme-specific module leaders and also the comparative Analysis between content of these modules and the existing LSS high-street training themes. Findings – The result revealed a high potential of the existing modules in the business schools equivalent to the private sector training providers to increase the level of LSS problem solving <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> for all graduates and improve their employability and productivity for the SMEs. Practical implications/limitations – This research has been carried out in a single UK–based Business School through a qualitative approach. A further in-depth analysis in a broader scale is required {{to investigate the}} practical implications in a better way. Originality/Value – The result of this study highlights the role of LSS to reduce <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> gap between <b>the</b> business schools as the source of <b>the</b> explicit <b>knowledge,</b> graduates as <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> bearer, <b>and</b> SMEs as <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> users...|$|R

Over time, the Irish learned the skills of mining and moved into better-paying, higher-skilled jobs. By the time of the 1880s and 1890s, the low-skill jobs were being taken by the new wave of immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe.
