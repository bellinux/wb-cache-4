The chemists who did microchemistry on these samples of <b>transuranium</b> <b>elements</b> sent the samples in capillaries to Zachariasen to find out what the samples consisted of.

The initial americium samples weighed a few micrograms; they were barely visible and were identified by their radioactivity. The first substantial amounts of metallic americium weighing 40–200 micrograms were not prepared until 1951 by reduction of americium(III) fluoride with barium metal in high vacuum at 1100°C.|$|E

Conventionally only fast spectrum reactors have been considered viable for utilization or reduction of the spent nuclear stockpiles. The conceptual viability of a thermal waste-burner was first shown in a whitepaper by Seaborg Technologies spring 2015. Thermal waste-burning was achieved by replacing a fraction of the uranium in the spent nuclear fuel with thorium. The net production rate of <b>transuranium</b> <b>element</b> (e.g. plutonium and americium) is reduced below the consumption rate, thus reducing the magnitude of the nuclear storage problem. Without the nuclear proliferation concerns and other technical issues associated with a fast reactor.|$|E

500|$|This {{proved that}} the unknown {{radioactive}} source originated from the decay of uranium and, coupled with the previous observation that the source was different chemically from all known elements, proved beyond all doubt that a new element had been discovered. McMillan and Abelson published their results in an article entitled Radioactive Element 93 in the Physical Review on May 27, 1940. They did not propose {{a name for the}} element in the article, but they soon decided on [...] "neptunium", since uranium had been named after the planet Uranus, and Neptune is the next planet beyond in our solar system. McMillan suddenly departed at this point, leaving Glenn Seaborg to pursue this line of research, which led to the second <b>transuranium</b> <b>element,</b> plutonium. In 1951, McMillan shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Seaborg [...] "for their discoveries in the chemistry of the transuranium elements".|$|E
500|$|Although {{americium}} {{was likely}} produced in previous nuclear experiments, {{it was first}} intentionally synthesized, isolated and identified in late autumn 1944, at the University of California, Berkeley, by Glenn T. Seaborg, Leon O. Morgan, Ralph A. James, and Albert Ghiorso. They used a 60-inch cyclotron at the University of California, Berkeley. The element was chemically identified at the Metallurgical Laboratory (now Argonne National Laboratory) of the University of Chicago. Following the lighter neptunium, plutonium, and heavier curium, americium was the fourth <b>transuranium</b> <b>element</b> to be discovered. At the time, the periodic table had been restructured by Seaborg to its present layout, containing the actinide row below the lanthanide one. This led to americium being located right below its twin lanthanide element europium; it was thus by analogy named after the Americas: [...] "The name americium (after the Americas) and the symbol Am are suggested for the element {{on the basis of}} its position as the sixth member of the actinide rare-earth series, analogous to europium, Eu, of the lanthanide series." ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Transuranium</b> <b>elements,</b> neptunium, plutonium, americium, and curium, {{are formed}} via neutron capture {{processes}} of actinides, and are mainly by-products of fuel irradiation during {{the operation of}} a nuclear reactor. Their properties significantly impact the nuclear fuel cycle, affecting and often determining requirements and procedures related to handling, storage, reprocessing, and disposal of fuels and high-level waste. It is still debated if, in particular, plutonium is an unwanted waste or, possibly, a resource {{for the production of}} energy. A standard universally agreed route for the treatment of <b>transuranium</b> <b>elements</b> is not yet established. This chapter provides an overview of past and ongoing experience and perspectives related to studies on transuranic recovery and incorporation in fuels and targets for advanced nuclear fuel cycles and their disposal as the main component of high-level nuclear waste. In particular, the chapter describes themain properties of transuraniumfuels, the specific requirements for their fabrication, their irradiation behavior, and their impact on the back-end of the fuel cycle. For the latter, a major issue is the development of options for reprocessing and separation of <b>transuranium</b> <b>elements</b> from spent fuel to make them available for further treatment. The effects caused by their presence in irradiated fuel and high-level nuclearwaste on long-term storage and final disposal are also discussed. The final destination of <b>transuranium</b> <b>elements</b> is still an open issue. The global context is characterized by a diversified set of options being pursued, which is reflected in this chapter. It is important to have a picture of the knowledge and experience gathered until now through relevant investigation campaigns worldwide.
