5|$|Before Animaniacs was {{put into}} {{production}} in 1991, various collaboration and brainstorming efforts were thought up to create both the characters and premise of the series.

After the characters from the series were created, they were all shown <b>to</b> <b>executive</b> producer Steven Spielberg, who would decide which characters would make it into Animaniacs (the characters Buttons and Mindy were chosen by Spielberg's daughter). The characters' designs came from various sources, including caricatures of other writers, designs based on early cartoon characters, and characters that simply had a more modern design.|$|E

5|$|Governors {{first began}} to assert their own power during the American Civil War as the General Assembly {{attempted}} to remove command of the militia from the governor. In response, the General Assembly was effectively suppressed, during which time the governor assumed many powers to appoint public officials, hire and remove state employees, and manage state finances. When the General Assembly reconvened with a majority sympathetic to the governor, he was permitted to continue many of his assumed powers. In 1889, the General Assembly began to reassert its authority over hiring state employees. The issued ended when the Supreme Court {{ruled in favor of}} the legislature, again returning to it final authority over hiring state employees. The legislature passed acts in 1895 that removed the last of the governor's authority to appoint anyone <b>to</b> <b>executive</b> positions.|$|E

On March 12, House Democrats released their own budget, which sustained most of the cuts <b>to</b> <b>executive</b> agencies in Bevin's budget, but exempted public universities from any cuts. The Republican-controlled Senate countered with a proposal that hewed closely to Bevin's original budget.|$|E
