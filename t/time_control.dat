5|$|A {{game played}} under <b>time</b> <b>control</b> will end as {{a loss for}} a player who uses up all of their allotted time, unless the {{opponent}} cannot possibly checkmate him (see the Timing section above). There are different types of <b>time</b> <b>control.</b> Players may have a fixed amount of time for the entire game or {{they may have to}} make a certain number of moves within a specified time. Also, a small increment of time may be added for each move made.|$|E
5|$|Chess Engines Grand Tournament (CEGT) tests {{computer}} chess engines by playing them against each other, with time controls of 40 moves in 120 minutes per player (40/120), and also 40/20 and 40/4, {{and uses the}} results of those games to compile a rating list for each <b>time</b> <b>control.</b> At the slowest <b>time</b> <b>control</b> (40/120), White has scored 55.4% (W34.7 D41.3 L24.0) in games played among 38 of the strongest chess engines (as of May 27, 2009). At 40/20, White has scored 54.6% (W37.0 D35.2 L27.8) in games played among 284 engines (as of May 24, 2009). At the fastest <b>time</b> <b>control</b> (40/4), White has scored 54.8% (W39.6 D30.5 L30.0), in games played among 128 programs (as of May 28, 2009).|$|E

5000|$|FIDE divide <b>time</b> <b>controls</b> for chess into [...] "classical" [...] <b>time</b> <b>controls,</b> and {{the fast}} chess <b>time</b> <b>controls.</b> Currently, for master-level players (with an Elo of 2200 or higher) the {{regulations}} state {{that at least}} 120 minutes per player (based on a 60-move game) must be allocated for a game to be rated on the [...] "classical" [...] list. Games played faster than this may be rated under the <b>time</b> <b>controls</b> of rapid and blitz, {{but only if they}} comply with the <b>time</b> <b>controls</b> for those categories.|$|R
50|$|The analog chess clock still enjoys great {{popularity}} today, {{for simple}} <b>time</b> <b>controls.</b> However, due to needed features like Increment, Delay, Bronstein, and complex <b>time</b> <b>controls,</b> along with being precise, the digital chess clock {{is the preferred}} choice of equipment in tournaments.|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} the structural {{mechanisms by which}} elevation of the intraendothelial cAMP levels abolishes or attenuates the transient increase in microvascular permeability by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), we examined cAMP effect on VEGF induced hyperpermeability to small solute sodium fluorescein (Stokes radius= 0. 45 nm) Psodium fluorescein, intermediate-sized solute a-lactalbumin (Stokes radius= 2. 01 nm) Pa-lactalbumin, and large solute albumin (BSA, Stokes radius= 3. 5 nm) PBSA on individually perfused microvessels of frog mesenteries. After 20 min pretreatment of 2 mM cAMP analog, 8 -bromo-cAMP, the initial increase by 1 nM VEGF was completely abolished in Psodium fluorescein (from a peak increase of 2. 6 ± 0. 37 <b>times</b> <b>control</b> with VEGF alone to 0. 96 ± 0. 07 <b>times</b> <b>control</b> with VEGF and cAMP), in P a-lactalbumin (from a peak increase of 2. 7 ± 0. 33 <b>times</b> <b>control</b> with VEGF alone to 0. 76 ± 0. 07 <b>times</b> <b>control</b> with VEGF and cAMP), and in PBSA (from a peak increase of 6. 5 ± 1. 0 <b>times</b> <b>control</b> with VEGF alone to 0. 97 ± 0. 08 <b>times</b> <b>control</b> with VEGF and cAMP). Based on these measured data, the prediction from our mathematical models suggested {{that the increase in}} the number of tight junction strands in the cleft between endothelial cells forming the microvessel wall is one of the mechanisms for the abolishment of VEGF-induced hyperpermeability by cAMP...|$|R

5000|$|The {{concept of}} rapid chess (then called [...] "active chess") {{made its debut}} at a 1987 FIDE Congress meeting in Seville, Spain. During the World Active Chess Championship the {{following}} year, <b>time</b> <b>controls</b> were set at 30 minutes per player per game. In 1993, following his split from FIDE, world champion Garry Kasparov organized a slightly quicker version of active chess, dubbing it [...] "rapid chess". The Professional Chess Association, Kasparov's answer to FIDE, subsequently organized two Grand Prix cycles of rapid chess before folding in 1996. Under rapid chess <b>time</b> <b>controls,</b> each player was allowed 25 minutes with an additional 10 seconds after each move. The FIDE would re-use these <b>time</b> <b>controls</b> and the [...] "rapid chess" [...] moniker for the 2003 FIDE World Rapid Chess Championship, held in Cap d'Agde. During the World Cup 2013, these <b>time</b> <b>controls</b> were also used for the rapid tiebreak stages.|$|R
5|$|Following German reunification, the US {{government}} {{announced plans to}} fully withdraw its troops from Frankfurt, Germany by 1995, at which <b>time</b> <b>control</b> of the entire site would be restored to the German Federal Government. It was suggested that the building could become the location for the European Central Bank. In 1996, the state of Hesse bought the building and associated land for the University of Frankfurt. The buildings were refurbished {{at a cost of}} 50 Million German Mark (about US $26M or 25M €), by the Copenhagen-based architecture practice Dissing+Weitling and were handed over to the university. The complex now houses the Westend Campus of the university, which includes the departments of Philosophy, History, Theology, Classical Philology, Art and Music, Modern Languages and Linguistics, Cultural and Civilization Studies, the Center for North American Studies and the Fritz-Bauer-Institute.|$|E
5|$|In formal competition, {{each player}} {{is obliged to}} record each move as it is played in a chess {{notation}} in order to settle disputes about illegal positions, overstepping <b>time</b> <b>control,</b> and making claims of draws by the fifty-move rule or repetition of position. Algebraic chess notation is the accepted standard for recording games today. There are other systems such as ICCF numeric notation for international correspondence chess and the obsolete descriptive chess notation. The current rule is that a move must {{be made on the}} board before it is written on paper or recorded with an electronic device.|$|E
5|$|In games {{subject to}} <b>time</b> <b>control,</b> a chess clock is used, {{consisting}} of two adjacent clocks and buttons to stop one clock while starting the other, such that the two component clocks never run simultaneously. The clock can be analog or digital though a digital clock is highly preferred under both USCF and FIDE rulesets. This is since most tournaments now include either a time delay (a countdown to when a clock starts again) or add (extra time being added prior or after the move) to their time controls. Before {{the start of the}} game, either the arbiter decides, or whomever is playing Black, where the chess clock is placed.|$|E

5|$|Statistician Jeff Sonas, in {{examining}} data from 266,000games played between 1994 and 2001, concluded that White scored 54.1767% plus 0.001164 times White's Elo rating advantage, treating White's rating advantage as +390 {{if it is}} better than +390, or −460 if it is worse than −460. He found that White's advantage is equivalent to 35 rating points, i.e. if White has a rating 35points below Black's, each player will have an expected score of 50%. Sonas also found that White's advantage is smaller (53%) in rapid games than in games at a slower ("classical") <b>time</b> <b>control.</b> In the 462 games played at the 2009 World Blitz Chess Championship, White scored only 52.16% (W38.96 D26.41 L 34.63).|$|E
5|$|The {{match was}} played {{as the best}} of 24 games, with wins {{counting}} 1 point and draws counting ½ point, and would end {{when one of the}} players scored 12½ points. If the match ended in a 12–12 tie, the defending champion (Spassky) would retain the title. The first <b>time</b> <b>control</b> was 40 moves in 2½ hours. Three games per week were scheduled. Each player was entitled to three postponements for medical reasons during the match. Games were scheduled to start on Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday. If a game was adjourned, it was to be continued the next day. Saturday was a rest day.|$|E
5|$|The tournament {{was played}} in a Swiss system format. The <b>time</b> <b>control</b> for all games was 90 minutes per 40 moves, with {{addition}} of 30 seconds per move and 30 minutes after the 40th move. It was allowed once again for a player to offer a draw {{at any time during}} the game. A total of 11 rounds were played, in which every team played with four of their players against another team. Every team was allowed to nominate one reserve player.|$|E

The first standard <b>time</b> <b>controls,</b> introduced in 1861, were 24 moves in two hours, with the average game lasting five hours. In the mid-1980s, a new format, 40 moves in two hours, proved popular because few games lasted over 60 moves.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we first}} design a <b>time</b> optimal <b>control</b> {{problem for the}} heat {{equation}} with sampled-data controls, and then use it to approximate a <b>time</b> optimal <b>control</b> problem for the heat equation with distributed controls. Our design is reasonable from perspective of sampled-data controls. And it might provide a right way for the numerical approach of a <b>time</b> optimal distributed <b>control</b> problem, via the corresponding semi-discretized (in time variable) <b>time</b> optimal <b>control</b> problem. The study of such a <b>time</b> optimal sampled-data <b>control</b> problem is not easy, because it may have infinitely many optimal controls. We find connections among this problem, a minimal norm sampled-data control problem and a minimization problem. And obtain some properties on these problems. Based on these, we not only build up error estimates for optimal <b>time</b> and optimal <b>controls</b> between the <b>time</b> optimal sampled-data <b>control</b> problem and the <b>time</b> optimal distributed <b>control</b> problem, {{in terms of the}} sampling period, but also prove that such estimates are optimal in some sense...|$|R
