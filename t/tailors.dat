The store is the first on the iconic tailoring street to hand-weave a cloth before making it up into a fully finished suit. Believing that Britain’s bespoke tailoring industry was facing a shortage of master <b>tailors,</b> the company established an apprenticeship programme in London, with young would-be <b>tailors</b> joining Cad & the Dandy’s 22 staff members at its three London locations, Savile Row, Birchin Lane and Canary Wharf.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, Saigon {{designers}} {{tightened the}} fit of the ao dai to create the version commonly seen today. Trần Kim of Thiết Lập <b>Tailors</b> and Dũng of Dũng <b>Tailors</b> created a dress with raglan sleeves and a diagonal seam that runs from the collar to the underarm. Madame Nhu, first lady of South Vietnam, popularized a collarless version beginning in 1958. The ao dai was most popular from 1960 to 1975. A brightly colored áo dài hippy was introduced in 1968. The áo dài mini, a version designed for practical use and convenience, had slits that extended above the waist and panels that reached only to the knee.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tailors,</b> {{attracted}} by the affluent and influential nature {{of the residents of}} Savile Row, started to open businesses in the area in the late 18th century, first in Cork Street, about 1790, then by 1803 in Savile Row itself. None of those original <b>tailors</b> survive today, though Henry Poole & Co, who through Edward VII's patronage, helped make the street fashionable, still have a presence in Savile Row. Poole moved the company into 32 Savile Row in 1846, following {{the death of his father}} James Poole, and the company is now at No. 15. Henry Poole is credited as creator of the dinner jacket, when he made a smoking jacket for the young Edward VII in 1860.|$|E

40|$|Aims Chronic {{benzodiazepine}} use {{is highly}} prevalent and {{is associated with}} a variety of negative health consequences. The present study examined the long-term effectiveness of a <b>tailored</b> patient education intervention on benzodiazepine use. Participants A randomized controlled trial was conducted comprising three arms, comparing (i) a single <b>tailored</b> intervention; (ii) a multiple <b>tailored</b> intervention and (iii) a general practitioner letter. The post-test took place after 12 months. Participants Five hundred and eight patients using benzodiazepines were recruited by their general practitioners and assigned randomly to one of the three groups. Intervention Two <b>tailored</b> interventions, the single <b>tailored</b> intervention (patients received one <b>tailored</b> letter) and the multiple <b>tailored</b> intervention (patients received three sequential <b>tailored</b> letters at intervals of 1 month), were compared to a short general practitioner letter that modelled usual care. The <b>tailored</b> interventions not only provided different and more information than the general practitioner letter; they were also personalized and adapted to individual baseline characteristics. The information in both <b>tailored</b> interventions was the same, but in the multiple <b>tailored</b> intervention the information was provided to the participants spread over three occasions. In the multiple <b>tailored</b> intervention, the second and the third <b>tailored</b> letters were based on short and standardized telephone interviews. Measurements Benzodiazepine cessation at post-test was the outcome measure. Findings The results showed that participants receiving the <b>tailored</b> interventions were twice as likely to have quit benzodiazepine use compared to the general practitioner letter. Particularly among participants with the intention to discontinue usage at baseline, both <b>tailored</b> interventions led to high percentages of those who actually discontinued usage (single <b>tailored</b> intervention 51. 7 %; multiple <b>tailored</b> intervention 35. 6 %; general practitioner letter 14. 5 %). Conclusions It was concluded that <b>tailored</b> patient education can be an effective tool for reducing benzodiazepine use, and can be implemented easily...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the working {{mechanisms}} of a computer <b>tailored</b> physical activity intervention for older adults with environmental information compared to a basic <b>tailored</b> intervention without environmental information. Method A clustered randomized controlled trial with two computer <b>tailored</b> interventions and a no-intervention control group was conducted among 1971 adults aged ≥ 50. The two <b>tailored</b> interventions were developed using Intervention Mapping and consisted of three <b>tailored</b> letters delivered over a four-month period. The basic <b>tailored</b> intervention targeted psychosocial determinants alone, while the environmentally <b>tailored</b> intervention additionally targeted environmental determinants, by providing <b>tailored</b> environmental information. Study outcomes were collected with questionnaires at baseline, three and six months and comprised total physical activity (days/week), walking (min/week), cycling (min/week), sports (min/week), environmental perceptions and use and appreciation of the interventions. Results Mediation analyses showed that changes in cycling, sports and total physical activity behaviour induced by the environmentally <b>tailored</b> intervention were mediated by changes in environmental perceptions. Changes in environmental perceptions did not mediate the effect of the basic <b>tailored</b> intervention on behaviour. Compared with the basic <b>tailored</b> intervention, the environmentally <b>tailored</b> intervention significantly improved cycling behaviour (τ = 30. 2). Additionally, the <b>tailored</b> letters of the environmentally <b>tailored</b> intervention were better appreciated and used, although these differences did not mediate the intervention effect. Discussion This study gave some first indications of the relevance of environmental perceptions as a determinant of changing physical activity behaviours and the potential effectiveness of providing environmental information as an intervention strategy aimed at enhancing physical activity behaviour among older adults. </p...|$|R

40|$|This note {{introduces}} re:mix, {{an infrastructure}} for presenting <b>tailored</b> web applications as services. How can users most effectively <b>tailor</b> this web content for mobile consumption? Currently, {{there are two}} approaches to <b>tailoring</b> web interfaces: in-browser extensions and programmable proxies. Browser extensions facilitate direct-manipulation <b>tailoring,</b> leverage the massive browser-based developer ecology, and build upon a ubiquitous platform. Unfortunately, existing browserbased <b>tailoring</b> systems yield a client-side application, inhibiting their portability, especially to stripped-down mobile browsers. Programmable proxies enable the <b>tailored</b> application to be deployed as a service, but current systems lack the environmental benefits of the browser. This paper introduces a “best-of-both-worlds” approach to <b>tailoring</b> web pages through the insight that the browser platform can also serve <b>tailored</b> applications. Figure 1.

Nonetheless, the overall effect sizes remain small suggesting room for improvement. This study examines whether <b>tailoring</b> to mode preference is more effective than non-tailoring in terms of recall and intention to perform breast self-examination (BSE). BSE instructions were either <b>tailored</b> to the participant’s mode preference (text, text with illustrations, or video) or non-tailored by randomly providing one of these modes. Results of an online experiment among 205 female participants showed that the intention to perform BSE was higher if the instruction was <b>tailored</b> to the mode preference. There were no effects of <b>tailoring</b> on recall of information. This study shows that we should move beyond content <b>tailoring</b> and should take into account {{the mode of}} delivery to meet individual’s needs and increase the effectiveness of <b>tailored</b> messages...|$|R

40|$|The {{basic premise}} behind <b>tailored</b> health {{communication}} is that {{information that is}} customized to an individual (rather than a group) will be viewed as more personally relevant, {{will be more likely}} to be read and cognitively processed, and ultimately will have a better chance of stimulating behavioral change. Abstract: <b>Tailored</b> health communica-tion research represents a very promis-ing line of inquiry that has the potential to produce major impacts on lifestyle behaviors. This study defines <b>tailoring</b> and discusses how <b>tailored</b> interven-tions operate, including comparing/ contrasting different <b>tailoring</b> chan-nels. Next, the authors review the lit-erature on <b>tailored</b> interventions to change lifestyle behaviors, with a focus on smoking cessation, dietary change, and physical activity, as well as inter-ventions that address multiple lifestyle behaviors. Finally, future directions for <b>tailoring</b> research are discussed. To date, a large literature has amassed showing the promise of <b>tailored</b> pro-grams delivered via print, Internet, local computer/kiosk, telephone, and interpersonal channels. Numerous studies demonstrate that these programs are capable of significant impacts on smoking cessation, dietary change, physical activity, and multiple behav-ior change. It is concluded that the potential of <b>tailoring</b> will be more fully realized as (a) the field builds a more cumulative science of <b>tailoring</b> and (b) greater dissemination of efficacious <b>tailored</b> programs takes place...|$|R

In 1846, Henry Poole, credited as creator of the dinner jacket or tuxedo, opened an entrance at 37 Savile Row from his late father's tailoring premises at 4 Old Burlington Street. As tailoring moved into the street, the house frontages were altered to bring natural light into the tailors' working area {{with the addition of}} glass frontages and light wells. The houses have been much altered over time; the original Burlingtonian design has been mostly lost, though No. 14 still retains much of the original external features.|$|E

The zardozi on costumes were also stitched by designers from Surat. A statue of Lord Krishna, to which Jodhabai prayed, was made of gold. In the scenes involving an imprisoned Anarkali, real chains were placed on Madhubala. The battle sequence between Akbar and Salim reportedly featured 2,000 camels, 400 horses, and 8,000 troops, mainly from the Indian Army's Jaipur cavalry, 56th Regiment.

Virtually every town had a brothel where female and male prostitutes could be had. Male catamites fetched a higher price than female concubines since pederasty with a teenage boy was seen as a mark of elite status, regardless of sodomy being repugnant to sexual norms. Public bathing became much more common than in earlier periods. Urban shops and retailers sold a variety of goods such as special paper money to burn at ancestral sacrifices, specialized luxury goods, headgear, fine cloth, teas, and others. Smaller communities and townships too poor or scattered to support shops and artisans obtained their goods from periodic market fairs and traveling peddlers. A small township also provided a place for simple schooling, news and gossip, matchmaking, religious festivals, traveling theater groups, tax collection, and bases of famine relief distribution.|$|E

Under Soubise's command, the French had conducted a notorious march across Germany, characterized by persistent pillaging. His army also had approximately 12,000 civilian camp followers. There were chefs, hair dressers, perruquiers, barbers, wives and mistresses, pastry chefs, <b>tailors</b> and clothiers of all kinds, saddle makers, bridle makers, grooms, and servants of all varieties who served the nobility.

5|$|The {{first section}} of Treblinka II (Camp 1) was the Wohnlager {{administrative}} and residential compound; it had a telephone line. The main road within the camp was paved and named Seidel Straße after Unterscharführer Kurt Seidel, the SS corporal who supervised its construction. A few side roads were lined with gravel. The main gate for road traffic was erected on the north side. Barracks were built with supplies delivered from Warsaw, Sokołów Podlaski, and Kosów Lacki. There was a kitchen, a bakery, and dining rooms; all were equipped with high-quality items taken from Jewish ghettos. The Germans and Ukrainians each had their own sleeping quarters, positioned at an angle for better control of all entrances. There were also two barracks behind an inner fence for the Jewish work commandos. SS-Untersturmführer Kurt Franz set up a small zoo in the centre next to his horse stables, with two foxes, two peacocks and a roe deer (brought in 1943).

During the 16th century, the Mellah had its own fountains, gardens, synagogues and souks. Until the arrival of the French in 1912, Jews could not own property outside of the Mellah; all growth was consequently contained within the limits of the neighborhood, resulting in narrow streets, small shops and higher residential buildings. The Mellah, today reconfigured as a mainly residential zone renamed Hay Essalam, currently occupies an area smaller than its historic limits and has an almost entirely Muslim population. The Alzama Synagogue, built around a central courtyard, is located in the Mellah. The Jewish cemetery here is the largest of its kind in Morocco.
