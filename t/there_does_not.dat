5|$|In {{some parts}} of Iron Age Scotland, quite unlike almost all of {{recorded}} history {{right up to the}} present day, <b>there</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> seem to have been an hierarchical elite. Studies have shown that these stone roundhouses, with massively thick walls must have contained virtually the entire population of islands such as Barra and North Uist. Iron Age settlement patterns in Scotland are not homogenous, but in these places {{there is no sign of}} a privileged class living in large castles or forts, or of an elite priestly caste or of peasants with no access to the kind of accommodation enjoyed by the middle classes.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} {{at what point}} among the extant fragments the division between books 1 and 2 fell, but {{at least some of}} the Aeolid families were covered in the second book. The families of Perieres, Deion and Sisyphus (in that order) were most likely found in the 2nd book because <b>there</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> appear to be enough room left in book 1 to accommodate them as a group after the children of Neleus and Pelias. It was once thought that the Ehoie of Atalanta opened the book, but recently published evidence casts doubt upon this view (see Book 3, below).|$|E

5|$|Mellitus fled {{first to}} Canterbury, but Æthelberht's {{successor}} Eadbald {{was also a}} pagan, so Mellitus, accompanied by Justus, took refuge in Gaul. Mellitus was recalled to Britain by Laurence, the second Archbishop of Canterbury, after his conversion of Eadbald. How long Mellitus' exile lasted is unclear. Bede claims it was a year, but {{it may have been}} longer. However, Mellitus did not return to London, because the East Saxons remained pagan. Although Mellitus fled, <b>there</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> seem to have been any serious persecution of Christians in the East Saxon kingdom. The East Saxon see was not occupied again until Cedd was consecrated as bishop in about 654.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of the {{abutment}} {{material or}} technique, {{an impression of}} the abutment is then taken and a crown secured to the abutment with dental cement. Another variation on abutment/crown model is when the crown and abutment are one piece and the lag-screw traverses both to secure the one-piece structure to the internal thread on the implant. <b>There</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> appear to be any benefit, in terms of success, for cement versus screw-retained prosthetics, although the latter {{is believed to be}} easier to maintain (and change when the prosthetic fractures) and the former offers high esthetic performance.|$|E
5|$|The Book of Kells {{contains}} {{the text of}} the four Gospels based on the Vulgate. It does not, however, contain a pure copy of the Vulgate. There are numerous differences from the Vulgate, where Old Latin translations are used in lieu of Jerome's text. Although such variants are common in all the insular Gospels, <b>there</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> seem to be a consistent pattern of variation amongst the various insular texts. Evidence suggests that when the scribes were writing the text they often depended on memory rather than on their exemplar.|$|E

5|$|There is {{not much}} {{evidence}} that the chariot races were subject to bribes {{or other forms of}} cheating in the Roman Empire.

5|$|This {{indicates}} {{the existence of}} two groups: Lucius Gellius Publicola eventually attacked Crixus {{and a group of}} some 30,000 followers who are described as being separate from the main group under Spartacus. Plutarch describes the desire of some of the escaped slaves to plunder Italy, rather than escape over the Alps. While this factional split is not contradicted by classical sources, <b>there</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> seem to be any direct evidence to support it.|$|E
5|$|Caracalla was {{not subject}} to a proper damnatio memoriae after his assassination; while the Senate disliked him, his {{popularity}} with the military prevented Macrinus and the Senate from openly declaring {{him to be a}} hostis. Macrinus, in an effort to placate the Senate, instead ordered the secret removal of statues of Caracalla from public view. After his death, the public made comparisons between him and other condemned emperors and called for the horse race celebrating his birthday to be abolished and for gold and silver statues dedicated to him to be melted down. These events were, however, limited in scope; most erasures of his name from inscriptions were either accidental or occurred as a result of re-use. Macrinus had Caracalla deified and commemorated on coins as Divus Antoninus. <b>There</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> appear to have been any intentional mutilation of Caracalla in any images that were created during his reign as sole emperor.|$|E

5|$|Carbon dating on ash mounds {{associated}} with Neolithic cultures in South India {{date back to}} 8000BCE.

Towards the beginning of 1000BCE, iron technology spread through the region; however, <b>there</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> appear to be a fully developed Bronze Age preceding the Iron Age in South India. The region {{was in the middle of}} a trade route that extended from Muziris to Arikamedu linking the Mediterranean and East Asia. Trade with Phoenicians, Romans, Greeks, Arabs, Syrians, Jews and Chinese began from the Sangam period (c. 3rd century BC to c. 4th century AD). The region was part of the ancient Silk Road connecting the Asian continent in the East and the West.|$|E
5|$|In 1907 {{the family}} split up; {{there was no}} divorce or formal separation, but the two elder boys, Christopher and Ambrose, {{remained}} with their father and Lydia left them, taking Ralph with her. The ostensible cause of the couple's separation was a row over Lydia's choice of wallpaper for her husband's study. According to John Miller's biography, whatever underlying causes {{there may have been}} are unknown. An earlier biographer, Garry O'Connor, speculates that Arthur Richardson might have been having an extramarital affair. <b>There</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> seem to have been a religious element, although Arthur was a dedicated Quaker, whose first two sons were brought up in that faith, whereas Lydia was a devout convert to Roman Catholicism, in which she raised Ralph. Mother and son had a variety of homes, the first of which was a bungalow converted from two railway carriages in Shoreham-by-Sea on the south coast of England.|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} that St. Rynagh (also Reynagh, Rinagh), who founded Banagher and after whom the parish is named, was a sister of St. Finnian of Clonard. According to research, they came from a place near New Ross in County Wexford. It is known that contact was {{maintained}} between Rynagh's Wexford home and her foundation at Banagher; and her mother came to live there. It is recorded that Reynagh's mother, Talech, or Talacia, became Abbess of the Banagher convent. The death of St. Finnian is assigned to 563, but <b>there</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> {{seem to be any}} authoritative statement as to the date of St. Rynagh's death, although according to St. Rynagh's Parish Church in Banagher, St. Rynagh died about 610. The place of her burial is uncertain but it is likely to have been in either Banagher or Kilmacduagh near Gort, the monastery founded by her son, St. Colman.|$|E

5|$|The tammar wallaby has a {{promiscuous}} mating system. It is {{a seasonal}} breeder and births largely occur during late January and early February. During the breeding season, the male's prostate and bulbourethral gland enlarge. However, <b>there</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> {{appear to be}} any seasonal difference in {{the weight of the}} testes. Around two weeks before the first births, the males will begin sniffing the uro-genital openings and pouches of the females to determine their reproductive status. After giving birth, females enter estrus and allow males to mate with them. However, a male that attempts to mate with an estrous female may face aggression from other males. A male can achieve reproductive success by mate-guarding. During the estrous period, males establish a dominance hierarchy and the higher ranking males will try to prevent subordinates from mating with estrous females. Several males may pursue a single female.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> {{appear to}} be a {{difference}} in motivation for self-harm in adolescent males and females. For example, for both genders there is an incremental increase in deliberate self-harm associated with an increase in consumption of cigarettes, drugs and alcohol. Triggering factors such as low self-esteem and having friends and family members who self-harm are also common between both males and females. One limited study found that, among those young individuals who do self-harm, both genders are just as equally likely to use the method of skin-cutting. However, females who self-cut are more likely than males to explain their self-harm episode by saying that they had wanted to punish themselves. In New Zealand, more females are hospitalised for intentional self-harm than males. Females more commonly choose methods such as self-poisoning that generally are not fatal, but still serious enough to require hospitalisation.|$|E
5|$|From these {{theoretical}} risks, derive {{the real}} world complications. Long-term failures are due to either loss of bone around the tooth and/or gingiva due to peri-implantitis or a mechanical failure of the implant. Because there is no dental enamel on an implant, it does not fail due to cavities like natural teeth. While large-scale, long-term studies are scarce, several systematic reviews estimate the long-term (five to ten years) survival of dental implants at 9398 percent depending on their clinical use. During initial development of implant retained teeth, all crowns were attached to the teeth with screws, but more recent advancements have allowed placement of crowns on the abutments with dental cement (akin to placing a crown on a tooth). This has created the potential for cement, that escapes from under the crown during cementation to {{get caught in the}} gingiva and create a peri-implantitis (see picture below). While the complication can occur, <b>there</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> appear to be any additional peri-implantitis in cement-retained crowns compared to screw-retained crowns overall.|$|E
