40|$|Transit-Oriented Developments (TODs) – i. e., compact, mixed-use, walking {{friendly}} neighborhoods {{oriented to}} rail or bus hubs–have gained {{popularity in the}} U. S. A commonly held view is TODs appeal to non-traditional households, like childless couples, Millennials, and empty-nesters. Such groups value good transit connections to downtown and, influenced by TV shows like Seinfeld and Friends, place a premium on living in walkable communities with outdoor cafes and shops that cater to the professional class. The Center for TOD (CTOD) estimates that 79 percent of U. S. households living in TODs by 2025 will be childless. Can TODs be kid-friendly? This can occur by replacing surface parking with communal gardens, playgrounds, <b>tot-lots,</b> and open space. Shrinking parking’s footprint reduces heat-island effects and water pollution from oil-stained run-off into streams. It also helps recharge groundwater, allowing greener and healthier gardens and play areas. Such car-restricted settings are not only safer for kids to play; they are more secure because of “natural surveillance,” the ability of residents to keep any eye on who is using community spaces. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} Miami Lakes development, {{east of the}} Palmetto Expressway, was master {{planned by}} Lester Collins with curving tree-shaded roadways and numerous curving lakes, which are unusual compared to most surrounding areas with their treeless streets on a square grid and rectangular lakes. This original development, {{which is on the}} east side of the more recently designated Town of Miami Lakes, has neighborhood shopping centers, <b>tot-lot</b> parks, and a town center named Main Street. A significant portion of Miami Lakes is still owned by the Grahams, mostly apartment buildings, shopping centers, office buildings, and still undeveloped land. The town is an early model of the New Urbanism movement with shopping and services located in walking distance of residences as well as narrow walkable streets and plenty of neighborhood parks.|$|E
