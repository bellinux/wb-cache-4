5|$|In {{view of the}} {{scarcity}} of sources concerning Shepseskare, nothing is known for certain about his relation to his predecessors. He was most likely {{a member of the}} royal family, although <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a usurper unrelated to his predecessors cannot be totally excluded.|$|E
5|$|After Perceval's death, Parliament made generous {{provision}} to his widow and children, and approved the erection of monuments. Thereafter his ministry was soon forgotten, his policies reversed, {{and he is}} generally better known for the manner of his death than for any of his achievements. Later historians have characterised Bellingham's hasty trial and execution as contrary {{to the principles of}} justice. <b>The</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was acting within a conspiracy, on behalf of a consortium of Liverpool traders hostile to Perceval's economic policies, {{is the subject of a}} 2012 study.|$|E
5|$|According to Ammianus, a deserter {{informed}} Chnodomar that Julian had 13,000 {{men with}} him at Saverne. But this leaves open <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> may have summoned more to join him for the battle. It is possible that Severus' division was additional, as it is stated that while Julian was at Saverne, Severus' men occupied a separate camp near Barbatio's army. Libanius implies that Julian had 15,000 men under his command. If this was true, the additional 2,000 may have been Severus' division. Also, Julian may {{have been able to}} call on some limitanei units to join his comitatus for the campaign. Zosimus states that on arrival in Gaul, Julian set about a major recruitment drive. This would mainly have aimed at reconstituting limitanei regiments that had largely dissolved during the years of anarchy. Julian's force may therefore have numbered somewhat more than 15,000.|$|E
50|$|His {{style is}} a skilful blend {{of the organic}} with geometry, of order with dissonance, of precise vision with suggestion. It is a whole {{language}} in itself, sincretic, and bearing a strong current of delight springing from <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> coaxes from <b>the</b> materials, methods and tools he uses to work with, the very keys to his paintings.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that,</b> since <b>he</b> was unsupervised, he {{was lying}} about some aspect of his accomplishment.|$|R
50|$|When {{the energy}} healer finished, Ruben {{expressed}} a wish to learn {{everything about the}} method he was using. The healer gave him a book called “Caucasian Yoga” by Count Stefan Colonna Walewski. It was hand-written in Russian {{and was the first}} step in Ruben’s self-tutoring. With this book came an understanding of human energy and a glance at <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had within himself.|$|R
5|$|When the Buccaneers {{selected}} University of Miami quarterback Vinny Testaverde first {{overall in}} the 1987 NFL Draft, starting quarterback Steve Young became expendable. He {{was traded to the}} 49ers on April 24, 1987. The 49ers were concerned about the health of Joe Montana, and were preparing for <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might not recover from back surgery. The Buccaneers received 2nd and 4th round draft picks in the trade, picks 50 and 106 overall, which they used to draft University of Miami linebacker Winston Moss and Arizona State wide receiver Bruce Hill. They also received an unspecified amount of cash in the deal. Young would spend the final 13 years of his career with the 49ers, a stint which would help him secure a spot in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Joe Mercer, who {{was then}} {{coaching}} the England schools team, urged Busby to sign Edwards, who was also attracting interest from Wolverhampton Wanderers and Aston Villa. Edwards signed for United as an amateur on 2 June 1952, but accounts of when he signed his first professional contract vary. Some reports state that it occurred on his 17th birthday in October 1953, but others contend that it took place a year earlier. Those accounts that favour the earlier date usually state that a club official, either Busby himself or coach Bert Whalley, arrived at the Edwards family home soon after midnight to secure the youngster's signature as early as possible, but other reports claim that this occurred when he signed his amateur contract. Wolves manager Stan Cullis was indignant at missing out on a highly touted local youngster and accused United of improperly offering financial inducements to Edwards or his family, but Edwards maintained that he {{had always wanted to}} play for the Lancashire team. To guard against <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might not make a success of his football career, he also began an apprenticeship as a carpenter.|$|E
5|$|The Joker is {{considered}} one of, if not, the most-recognizable and iconic fictional characters in popular culture (Batman's arguable equal), {{one of the best}} comic villains, and one of the greatest villains of all-time. The character was well-liked following his debut, appearing in nine out of the first twelve Batman issues, and remained one of Batman's most popular foes throughout his publication. The character {{is considered}} one of the four top comic book characters, alongside Batman, Superman, and Spider-Man. Indeed, when DC Comics released the original series of Greatest Stories Ever Told (1987–1988) featuring collections of stories about heroes like Batman and Superman, the Joker was the only villain included alongside them. The character has been the focus of ethical discussion on the desirability of Batman (who adheres to an unbreakable code forbidding killing) saving lives by murdering the Joker (a relentless dealer of death). These debates weigh the positive (stopping the Joker permanently) against its effect on Batman's character and <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might begin killing all criminals.|$|E
5000|$|Later in the Faune, Debussy {{builds a}} complex texture, where, as Austin says, “Polyphony and {{orchestration}} overlap...He adds {{to all the}} devices of Mozart, Weber, Berlioz and Wagner <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> learned from <b>the</b> heterophonic music of the Far East.... The first harp varies the flute parts in almost {{the same way that}} the smallest bells of a Javanese gamelan vary the slower basic melody.” ...|$|R
50|$|Bush: <b>The</b> <b>possibility</b> exists, {{including}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will be assassinated.|$|R
6000|$|Stevenson was now {{beginning}} to break to his friends at home <b>the</b> [...] <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might settle permanently in the South Seas; but [...] he still projected a preliminary visit to England, {{or at least to}} [...] Europe.|$|R
25|$|After the 2009 season Marquis {{became a}} free agent. The Rockies offered him arbitration, but he {{rejected}} their {{offer of a}} one-year, non-guaranteed deal for <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will receive a multi-year deal.|$|E
25|$|Compagnoni {{gave the}} {{explanation}} that {{his decision to}} change the agreed site of the camp was to avoid an overhanging serac, but Bonatti accused both (and the facts would later give him reason) to have deliberately changed the location to exclude <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could join in the summit climb.|$|E
25|$|It's {{possible}} that he had received some sort of formal education in Galway, studying English, Latin and some Greek. This is inferred from his use of all three languages in his works. There is also <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> received additional training at the Mac Aodhagáin bardic school located at Ballymacegan, Lough Derg, County Tipperary, which was run by noted scholar, Flann Mac Aodhagáin.|$|E
5000|$|David is left {{troubled by}} <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> facing {{a battle with}} {{testicular}} cancer, and is caught trying {{to take a picture}} of his testicles with his pants down by Leyla. She then takes a picture for him. While they talk about David's impending battle, the pair hug and David says <b>that</b> <b>he</b> [...] "loves" [...] Leyla, which Jacob overhears, and wrongly assumes David and Leyla to be an item. The following day; his 13th birthday, he confronts them about their encounter, and David sets the record straight, in the process telling Jacob <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might have cancer. Their bond is strengthened because of this.|$|R
60|$|Edward {{then had}} not told more--as {{he ought to have}} done: yet she could not convict him. But she would {{struggle}} against his fetters. She tingled to the very soles of her feet at <b>the</b> very <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might be deluding her.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike in the TV series, {{he is not}} {{a member}} of the A-Team from the beginning; he joins the other three during a mission when they need a pilot at the last minute while fleeing a renegade general, a patient in a mental hospital, but is {{released}} into Hannibal's custody. Like his TV counterpart, the film Murdock also leaves open <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> eccentric and simply pretending to be insane. However, he does mention he [...] "feels sane" [...] after a blow to the head before the end of the movie. Murdock's fixation on pop culture characters is also kept intact, specifically in one scene where he re-enacts Mel Gibson's portrayal of William Wallace in the movie Braveheart.|$|R
25|$|Also on August 10, Abdel Aziz did {{not exclude}} <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> or {{other members of}} the junta could run for President, {{although}} he said that the issue had not been decided and that other things needed to be dealt with first. His acknowledgement of the possibility was in contrast to the decision of the previous junta in 2005 to exclude its members from running for office.|$|E
25|$|We {{should note}} that Descartes' doubt is a methodological and {{rational}} doubt. That is, the Meditator is not just doubting everything at random, but is providing solid reasons for his doubt at each stage. For instance, he rejects <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might be mad, since that would undercut the rationality that motivates his doubt. Descartes is {{trying to set up}} this doubt within a rational framework, and needs to maintain a claim to rationality for his arguments to proceed.|$|E
25|$|Yeltsin's {{personal}} and health problems received {{a great deal}} of attention in the global press. As the years went on, he was often viewed as an increasingly unstable leader, rather than the inspiring figure he was once seen as. <b>The</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might die in office was often discussed. Starting in the last years of his presidential term, Yeltsin's primary residence was the Gorki-9 presidential dacha west of Moscow. He made frequent stays at the nearby government sanatorium in Barvikha.|$|E
50|$|After {{authorities}} surveilled {{the suspect}} for a lengthy period and built their case, search and arrest warrants were executed. Because {{of the nature}} of The Bishop's alleged crimes—sending IEDs (Improvised Explosive Device) through <b>the</b> mail—the <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could detonate an IED while being arrested was a major safety concern.|$|R
50|$|The episode then {{jumps to}} Monk's Café, where Elaine {{discusses}} her new boyfriend, Jake Jarmel (played by Marty Rackham), who she met in her office. She explains how he approached her, {{and felt her}} gabardine jacket between {{his thumb and forefinger}} rather seductively. The conversation then jumps to Jerry’s new sweater, which he found {{in the back of his}} closet. At that point, Elaine looks out the window of the café and sees Barry Prophet (John Kapelos), Jerry's accountant. They invite him in, but are stunned to find him repeatedly sniffing during their conversation. The group discusses <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could be on drugs. Jerry is panic-stricken, considering that Barry could write checks out of his account for illegal narcotics.|$|R
50|$|Adad-apla-iddina, as {{the king}} who was {{subsequently}} installed by Aššur-bel-kala, also has his father given as Itti-Marduk-balāṭu in the Eclectic Chronicle, leaving <b>the</b> intriguing <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a {{brother of the}} former governor. Some of the late 19th and early 20th century scholarly works erroneously give Kadašman-Buriaš as {{the name of the}} Kassite king Kadašman-Enlil II.|$|R
25|$|Dumbledore was {{haunted by}} his sad family history. In particular, he was riddled with guilt over the {{circumstances}} surrounding the death of his sister. He felt enormous remorse for his selfishness and was tortured {{for the rest of his}} life by <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might have been the one who cast the spell that killed his sister. When he looked into the Mirror of Erised, he saw himself redeemed in the eyes of his brother and his entire family alive and together.|$|E
25|$|During {{practice}} in Xi'an {{weeks before the}} Olympic games, Fabriga suffered a waist injury that seriously hampered the pace of his training. Both he and his coach admitted that his performance in the games would inevitably {{be affected by the}} injury, with <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would be unable to finish his dive. In the preliminary stage of the competition, Fabriga's opening dive was the least impressive of the round, and he went on to finish the preliminaries in 28th place in a field of 30.|$|E
25|$|Tobin's {{candidacy}} raised <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{would become}} the city's first ever elected black mayor. By {{the time of the}} 2000 census, Minden had become 52 percent black. Businessman Bill Robertson, {{a former member of the}} Minden City Council and the then president of the Webster Parish Police Jury, the parish's governing board, also ran for mayor, as did real estate agent Peggy J. Staples (1933–2009), who was a member of the city council from 1978 to 1990, the first woman ever elected to the governing body.|$|E
50|$|After Seaver's 298th win, a {{reporter}} {{had pointed out}} to White Sox catcher Carlton Fisk that following his upcoming start in Boston, Seaver's next scheduled start would be in New York, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> existed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might achieve the mark there. Fisk emphatically stated that Seaver would win in Boston, and then would win his 300th.|$|R
50|$|The show {{focuses on}} David Haller, who is {{diagnosed}} as schizophrenic. Following {{an encounter with}} another patient, he is confronted with <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> voices <b>he</b> hears and the visions he sees might be real.|$|R
50|$|In 1203, Oleg {{defeated}} 1,700 Lithuanians; it {{is plausible}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> attacked the Lithuanians {{in order to help}} the princes of Polotsk, but <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> remains <b>that</b> <b>he</b> attacked them in defense of the Dregovichi domains. Under the year 1204, a number of chronicles state that Oleg died, while others add that his son died with him. They probably fell in battle against the Lithuanians.|$|R
25|$|Russert {{does not}} recall stating to Libby, in this conversation, {{anything}} about the wife of former ambassador Joe Wilson. Although he could not completely rule out <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had such an exchange, Russert {{was at a loss}} to remember it, and moreover, he believes that this would be the type of conversation that he would or should remember. Russert acknowledged that he speaks to many people on a daily basis {{and it is difficult to}} reconstruct some specific conversations, particularly one which occurred several months ago.|$|E
25|$|On 27 August, Stanley asked Gibson {{to write}} letters of {{introduction}} for his wife, {{who was about to}} leave for the US, to some of Gibson's trade union colleagues there. Gibson complied and Stanley used the letters to attempt to obtain from HM Treasury foreign currency above the usual allowance. Stanley's approach alerted officials to <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was about to flee the country. 27 August was also the day when Gibson sent a cheque for GBP500 to Stanley as deposit on a share offer in Gray's Carpets Ltd. Gibson heard nothing more from Stanley.|$|E
25|$|Mallory's {{daughter}} said that Mallory carried {{a photograph of}} his wife on his person {{with the intention of}} leaving it on the summit. This photo was not found on Mallory's body. Given the excellent preservation of the body, its garments and other items including documents in his wallet, this points to <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> may have reached the summit and deposited the photo there. On the other hand, Wang (who is known to have taken Mallory's ice-axe) might also have taken the photograph for identification purposes, and no one who has subsequently reached the summit has reported seeing any evidence of the photograph, or any other trace of their presence there.|$|E
50|$|A letter survives in the Register of Innocent IV, dating Lawrence's {{departure}} from Lyon to 5 March 1245. The letter, published in Monumenta Germaniae Historica and usually {{referred to as}} Dei patris immensa, suggests that his mission was primarily religious in character. Lawrence was to have approached the Mongols from the Levant. Nothing is known of his fate, and <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> remains <b>that</b> <b>he</b> never left.|$|R
60|$|He {{had just}} {{accepted}} a case--a case {{that might be}} nothing at all or something exceedingly big. It was on <b>the</b> latter <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had gambled. <b>The</b> fee offered was, judged by his present standards of prosperity, small. But the bizarre facts, coupled with something in {{the personality of the}} client, had won him over. He briskly touched the bell and requested that Mr. Oakes should be sent in to him.|$|R
50|$|Evans {{was struck}} by the {{repetition}} of this phrase and spotted several boats hidden under bushes along the shore. <b>He</b> deduced <b>that</b> a crossing was planned for 13 October, but on returning to the British lines a council of officers responded to his statement with laughter and mockery. However, Brock took Evans aside and after a meeting was convinced of <b>the</b> <b>possibility.</b> <b>That</b> evening <b>he</b> dispatched several orders for the militia to assemble.|$|R
