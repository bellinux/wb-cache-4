5|$|Vainio's {{childhood}} {{heart problems}} surfaced again in 1990 {{with his sister}} Marja recalling that he often placed {{his hand over his}} heart. He had even finished writing his will. At one time Vainio was travelling to Florida with his friend, composer Veikko Samuli. Vainio had <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> during the flight, and soon there was a call for a doctor from the flight crew. Vainio had kept his heart medicines in his pocket, where the box had opened and mixed with his pastilles. Vainio had eaten too much of the medicine by accident, and his heartbeat started to slow down. Once a stewardess found out what had happened, she saved Vainio's life by quickly forcing him to vomit.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} {{plans for the}} series, Jack {{was going to die}} midway through the first episode. The role of Jack was {{originally}} offered to Michael Keaton, but when the producers quickly changed their minds about Jack's death, making him the leader, Keaton gave up the job. After Matthew Fox's casting as Jack, the character was established as a leader, and the airplane pilot was introduced to take Jack's place as The Monster's first victim. The pilot wound up being played by Greg Grunberg, a childhood friend of Abrams who the producer brings into most of his projects. Around seventy-five women of different shapes, sizes, ethnicities and ages auditioned to be Kate. In the initial plans, Kate would emerge as the leader after Jack died. She {{was not going to be}} a fugitive, instead her husband was going <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> shortly before the plane split in mid air, and she would remain adamant on the Island that he was alive. This ended up being used for Rose's (L. Scott Caldwell) character instead. The producers were impressed with Canadian Evangeline Lilly's audition for Kate, as she displayed the confidence with vulnerability that they were looking for. As this was Lilly's first role, she had difficulty obtaining a visa to work in America. She was supposed to start on the first day of filming, but the schedule was rearranged to give her more time, and in the meantime, the producers began auditioning again in case the visa did not come through. However, during one of the auditions, they got an email confirming that she had obtained her visa and could start work on the show.|$|E

Upon returning, he asked the manager to stay for a moment, as he wanted to explain something. Following the explosion, Moon turned the recorder back on and said, [...] "That, dear boy, was noise.

500|$|In {{the first}} section of Fenwick's book, she recounts the est {{training}} process and the methods used during the course. Fenwick details the rules or [...] "agreements" [...] laid out by the trainers to the attendees, which include not talking to others or leaving the session <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> unless during an announced break period. The second section is analytic: Fenwick analyzes the methods used by the est trainers, evaluates the course's potential effects, and discusses Erhard's background. Fenwick concludes that the program's long-term effects are unknown, the est training may not be appropriate for certain groups of people, and that the large proportion of participants experience positive effects.|$|E
500|$|Homer {{initially}} {{refuses to}} attend Bart's show because he discovers the artwork {{is an insult}} to him, but changes his mind after Bart apologizes and writes [...] "I'm sorry" [...] on the hood of Homer's car. At the show, Chief Wiggum and the Springfield Police Department suddenly appear to arrest Bart for making graffiti throughout the town. It is revealed that the gallery show is a sham and that Fairey is an undercover officer who helped the police identify Bart as the graffiti artist that had been spray-painting Springfield. Since Bart is just a boy, he is not sent to jail. Instead, he is punished by once again being locked up in the rabbit cage. When Bart tells Wiggum that he has <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom,</b> Wiggum covers the cage with the blanket and finds Bart gone when he removes the blanket from the cage.|$|E

500|$|In {{order to}} get the feel of an actual documentary, the {{producers}} hired cinematographer Randall Einhorn, who is known for directing episodes of Survivor, which allowed the show to have the feel of [...] "rough and jumpy" [...] like an actual documentary. According to producer Michael Schur, the producers to the series would follow the documentary format strictly. The producers would have long discussions over whether a scene could work under the documentary format. For example, in the fourth-season episode [...] "Did I Stutter?," [...] a scene featured Michael going through a long process <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> and not pass by Stanley. The producers debated whether that was possible and Einhorn walked through the whole scene in order to see if a camera man could get to all the places in time to shoot the whole scene. Despite the strict nature {{in the early years of}} the series, later seasons seem to have loosened the rules on the format, with the camera crew often going into places that actual documentary crews would not, which also changed the writing and comedy-style of the series. This inconsistency has received criticism from critics and fans.|$|E
500|$|The event {{featured}} employees {{other than}} the wrestlers involved in the matches. Mike Tenay and Don West were the commentators for the telecast. Jeremy Borash and David Penzer were ring announcers for the event. Andrew Thomas, Earl Hebner, Rudy Charles, and Mark [...] "Slick" [...] Johnson participated as referees for the encounters. Besides employees appearing in a wrestling role, Christy Hemme, Shelly Martinez, Angelina Love, Velvet Sky, Karen Angle, and Father James Mitchell all appeared on camera, either in backstage or ringside segments. Crystal Louthan and Borash were used as interviewers during the event. A series of backstage segments featured on the show had James Storm and Eric Young, with Jackie Moore, Borash, and Crystal as observers, competing in a beer drinking contest in which the winner would determine their match at the Against All Odds PPV event on February 10, 2008. The first was a [...] "never have I ever" [...] round, which Storm won. The second round was contested with both participants having beer bottles taped to their hands and not being allowed <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom.</b> Young won after Storm wet himself, which was confirmed by Moore. The third round involved the two taking shots, which was won by Storm after Young passed out due to Storm drugging him. With Storm winning two contests to one, he earned the ability to determine their match at Against All Odds.|$|E
500|$|The {{first round}} was a [...] "never have I ever" [...] round, {{in which the}} {{participants}} had to admit to experiences {{they had never been}} involved in. If the opponent had partaken in a similar action he was forced to drink a shot. Storm was the victor of this round. The second round was contested with both participants having beer bottles taped to their hands and neither being allowed <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom.</b> Young won after Storm wet himself, which was confirmed by Ms. Jackie, now named Jackie Moore. The third round involved the two drinking shots; it was won by Storm after Young passed out because Storm had drugged him. With Storm winning two contests to one, he earned the ability to determine their match at TNA's Against All Odds PPV event on February 10, 2008. At Against All Odds, Young defeated Storm to retain the TNA World Beer Drinking Championship after Rhino interfered attacking Storm. On the February 28, 2008 episode of Impact!, a Ladder match for the World Beer Drinking Championship was held between Storm and Young. Storm won the bout after Moore climbed a ladder and retrieved the championship for Storm without the referee seeing. On the March 6, 2008 episode of Impact!, Rhino stole the title belt from Storm and bashed the belt across a ring post, thus destroying it and ending the storyline surrounding it.|$|E

500|$|The Flukeman—also known affectionately as [...] "Flukey" [...] by {{the cast}} and crew—was portrayed by Darin Morgan, brother of {{executive}} producer Glen Morgan. He would become {{a staff writer for}} the show later in the second season. The Flukeman suit used by Morgan, which included flipper-like feet, yellow contact lenses, and fake teeth, took six hours to put on; this process was eventually sped up. Morgan wore the suit as much as 20 consecutive hours during shooting. As a result, he was forced <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> while still wearing the suit. Morgan was rarely on set without being in full costume, and recalled that when he met up with David Duchovny again upon joining the series' writing staff, the actor had no idea who he was, despite having enjoyed an amiable relationship with the costumed Morgan previously. The suit dissolved in water, forcing special effects artist Toby Lindala to reconstruct the suit each day. Because the suit did not permit Morgan to breathe through his nose, he was unable to eat while wearing it. Carter described the character as [...] "the embodiment of everyone's sense of vulnerability, the idea of something that exists in the underworld of the sewer system and might in fact come to bite you in the least elegant of places". The original intention was showing even less of the Flukeman, but some angles and lighting ended up revealing more of the creature's design. Carter still felt it helped to [...] "get more creepy", as the Flukeman is not shown fully until the final scenes.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} largely {{based upon the}} 1985 film Spies Like Us, which starred Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd, and the movie is {{mentioned}} in the episode itself. The episode was also based on the 1977 spy film Telefon about brainwashed Russian spies in the U.S. who can be activated by a special code phrase. When Peter has <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom,</b> he runs to Cleveland's empty home, which has been put up for sale since he left to live in Virginia with his new family. A montage of Peter {{going to the bathroom}} is shown, while Jennifer Lopez's [...] "Let's Get Loud" [...] plays. When Peter becomes aware that Cleveland's house is being rented by actors Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd, he mentions that he is honored to have dinner with [...] "two of the three Ghostbusters." [...] Chase then replies that he was not in that movie; Peter also notes that he is honored to meet [...] "two of the Three Amigos," [...] a movie starring Chase but not Aykroyd. After dinner, Stewie is seen drawing and coloring Sebastian the crab, a character from the Disney film The Little Mermaid. When Aykroyd and Chase ask Stewie and Brian {{if they want to be}} [...] "spies like us", Stewie asks if they can be [...] "spies like them" [...] and points to Black Spy and White Spy from Spy vs. Spy, one of the head comic strip features of MAD magazine. When Aykroyd and Chase explain to Stewie and Brian how they were recruited as official spies by Reagan, a cutaway is shown of an event in which 1985 is awarded the [...] "Awesomest Year of the 80's" [...] prize and all characters spontaneously start dancing to the 1983 song [...] "(Keep Feeling) Fascination." [...] Later, Brian and Stewie agree to become agents, and Stewie asks if [...] "Ron Howard's weird-looking brother is here." [...] There is a cutaway to The Brady Bunch, in which it is revealed Mike Brady killed his first wife, and housekeeper Alice walks in and demands a raise.|$|E

When John was two years old his parents both converted to Catholicism. He first attended a Catholic school in Berkeley named the [...] "School of the Madeleine". In his memoir, Fortunate Son, Fogerty was critical of the school, saying [...] he was not permitted <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> when he asked and frequently wet himself in the classroom and was forced to sit in his wet clothing.|$|E

In a followup at the OPEC summit, Reuters wrote that [...] "Spain's king cannot shut Chavez up but bladder can", and that Chávez said to a throng of reporters at the OPEC summit, [...] "For a while now, I have needed <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> and I am going to pee ...

2500|$|A city {{review of}} the riot turned up {{numerous}} problems with the police department's actions that night, including a failure to contact either Commissioner Ward or Mayor Koch. In {{the middle of the}} riot the commander left the scene <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> at the station house, several blocks away from the fighting. The police helicopter used to illuminate the area only attracted bigger crowds. Several nearby rooftops were not secured by police and were used to throw bottles and debris at people on the street. [...] Ward said the mounted police were brought to the scene too soon and acted too rashly to confront protesters. A temporary headquarters was set up {{right in the middle of}} the park, causing officers unfamiliar with the East Village—who rushed to the scene from throughout the city—to push their way through demonstrators to reach it. Once at the headquarters, they found no high-ranking officer on duty.|$|E
6000|$|Then he {{had another}} inspiration, and went {{rambling}} off into fervent confusions and incoherencies, and I had to stop him again. I thought we had talked enough, so I told him <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> and clean it up and remove the slops--this {{to get rid of}} him. He went away, seeming to understand, and got out some of my clothes and began to brush them. I repeated my desire several times, simplifying and re-simplifying it, and at last he got the idea. Then he went away and put a coolie at the work, and explained that he would lose caste if he did it himself; it would be pollution, by the law of his caste, and it would cost him a deal of fuss and trouble to purify himself and accomplish his rehabilitation. He said that that kind of work was strictly forbidden to persons of caste, and as strictly restricted to the very bottom layer of Hindoo society--the despised 'Sudra' (the toiler, the laborer). He was right; and apparently the poor Sudra has been content with his strange lot, his insulting distinction, for ages and ages--clear {{back to the beginning of}} things, so to speak. Buckle says that his name--laborer--is a term of contempt; that it is ordained by the Institutes of Menu (900 B.C.) that if a Sudra sit on a level with his superior he shall be exiled or branded--[Without going into particulars I will remark that as a rule they wear no clothing that would conceal the brand.--M. T.] [...] . if he speak contemptuously of his superior or insult him he shall suffer death; if he listen to the reading of the sacred books he shall have burning oil poured in his ears; if he memorize passages from them he shall be killed; if he marry his daughter to a Brahmin the husband shall go to hell for defiling himself by contact with a woman so infinitely his inferior; and that it is forbidden to a Sudra to acquire wealth. [...] "The bulk of the population of India," [...] says Bucklet--[Population to-day, 300,000,000.] --"is the Sudras--the workers, the farmers, the creators of wealth." ...|$|E
