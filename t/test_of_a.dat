5|$|After the battle, {{the ship}} was {{transferred}} to the 4th BS and became the flagship of its commander, Vice-Admiral Sir Doveton Sturdee. The Grand Fleet sortied on 18 August to ambush the High Seas Fleet while it advanced into the southern North Sea, but a series of miscommunications and mistakes prevented Jellicoe from intercepting the German fleet before it returned to port. During this foray, Hercules carried out the first <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> towed kite balloon (without observers). Two light cruisers were sunk by German U-boats during the operation, prompting Jellicoe to decide to not risk the major units of the fleet south of 55° 30' North due to the prevalence of German submarines and mines. The Admiralty concurred and stipulated that the Grand Fleet would not sortie unless the German fleet was attempting an invasion of Britain or there was a strong possibility it could be forced into an engagement under suitable conditions.|$|E
5|$|Although {{all of its}} {{components}} had been tested in target and drop tests, no full <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gun-type nuclear weapon occurred before Hiroshima. There were several reasons for not testing a Little Boy type of device. Primarily, there was insufficient uranium-235. Additionally, the weapon design was simple enough {{that it was only}} deemed necessary to do laboratory tests with the gun-type assembly. Unlike the implosion design, which required sophisticated coordination of shaped explosive charges, the gun-type design was considered almost certain to work. Thirty-two drop tests were conducted at Wendover, and only once did the bomb fail to fire. One last-minute modification was made, to allow the powder bags of propellant that fired the gun to be loaded in the bomb bay.|$|E
5|$|Although {{all of its}} {{components}} had been tested, no full <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gun-type nuclear weapon occurred before the Little Boy was dropped over Hiroshima. The only test explosion of a nuclear weapon concept had been of an implosion-type device employing plutonium as its fissile material, and took place on 16 July 1945 at the Trinity nuclear test. There were several reasons for not testing a Little Boy type of device. Primarily, there was little uranium-235 {{as compared with the}} relatively large amount of plutonium which, it was expected, could be produced by the Hanford Site reactors. Additionally, the weapon design was simple enough that it was only deemed necessary to do laboratory tests with the gun-type assembly. Unlike the implosion design, which required sophisticated coordination of shaped explosive charges, the gun-type design was considered almost certain to work.|$|E

5|$|Einsteinium {{was first}} {{identified}} in December 1952 by Albert Ghiorso and co-workers at the University of California, Berkeley {{in collaboration with}} the Argonne and Los Alamos National Laboratories, in the fallout from the Ivy Mike nuclear test. The test was carried out on November 1, 1952 at Enewetak Atoll in the Pacific Ocean and was the first successful <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hydrogen bomb. Initial examination of the debris from the explosion had shown the production of a new isotope of plutonium, , which could only have formed by the absorption of six neutrons by a uranium-238 nucleus followed by two beta decays.|$|E

Along with Ed Greene and Bob La Masney {{who worked}} on post-production mixing, he received an Emmy Award for sound design and the mixing of the live show. Jackson designed the sound for Streisand's 1999–2000 , and he mixed the New Year's Eve concert 31 December 1999 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Paradise, Nevada. He mixed Streisand's appearances in Sydney and Melbourne in March 2000, connecting the large backing choir's sound mix by optical fibre from a nearby polo field where the choir was stationed.

5|$|Alomar {{made her}} {{first and only}} {{appearance}} in Resident Evil 5. According to the character's backstory, her parents {{died when she was}} eight years old in an apparent factory accident and she was taken in by her uncle. Eventually, Alomar ran away and was found by a truck driver who was part of a rebel militia group. She later joined the group and soon learned that the factory accident her parents had died in was actually a <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bio-organic weapon (BOW) by the pharmaceutical company Umbrella Corporation. With the help of the local government, Umbrella destroyed Alomar's village and its inhabitants after the test was complete. When Alomar was 15, she was contacted by U.S. operatives to sabotage Umbrella's attempt to sell a BOW. With Alomar's help, the deal was stopped and she was offered a chance {{to start a new life}} in America. Alomar accepted, was speaking fluent English within months and enrolled at a university two years later. After graduation, her benefactor recruited her to join the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA). While Umbrella had dissolved years before this, Alomar's hatred of Umbrella and others like them led her to join. She was assigned to a unit for eight months of training, in which she excelled and was chosen to become an agent assigned to the BSAA's West African department. When BSAA agent Chris Redfield is sent to intercept a black market BOW sale in the fictional African country Kijuju, Alomar is assigned to be his partner and guide.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{awarding}} of the contract, a preliminary design review {{was carried out in}} September 1972, followed by a critical design review in September 1976 after which the engine's design was set and construction of the first set of flight-capable engines began. Final review of all the Space Shuttle's components, including the engines, was conducted in 1979. The design reviews operated in parallel with several test milestones, initial tests consisting of individual engine components which identified shortcomings with various areas of the design, including the HPFTP, HPOTP, valves, nozzle and fuel preburners. The individual engine component tests were followed by the first <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> complete engine (0002) on March 16, 1977. NASA specified that, prior to the Shuttle's first flight, the engines must have undergone at least 65,000 seconds of testing, a milestone that was reached on March 23, 1980, with the engine having undergone 110,253 seconds of testing by the time of STS-1 both on test stands at Stennis Space Center and installed on the Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA). The first set of engines (2005, 2006 and 2007) were delivered to Kennedy Space Center in 1979 and installed on , before being removed in 1980 for further testing and reinstalled on the orbiter. The engines, which were of the first manned orbital flight (FMOF) configuration and certified for operation at 100% rated power level (RPL), were operated in a twenty-second flight readiness firing on February 20, 1981, and, after inspection, declared ready for flight.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The X-machine {{testing method}} has been {{developed}} as <b>an</b> application <b>of</b> the W-method to testing the control structure <b>of</b> <b>an</b> implementation, against a specification. The method was proven to demonstrate the equivalence of the behaviour of the two, subject to <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> conditions both <b>a</b> specification and an implementation are expected to satisfy, such as (1) determinism of the two and (2) that functions labelling arcs on <b>a</b> transition diagram <b>of</b> <b>a</b> specification control structure have been tested in advance. Since the original publication <b>of</b> the <b>testing</b> method, <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> extensions have been published, removing the restrictions mentioned above. This paper surveys the extensions <b>of</b> the X-machine <b>testing</b> method, for (1) <b>testing</b> <b>of</b> functions together with <b>testing</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> transition diagram, (2) equivalence <b>testing</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> non-deterministic implementation against a non-deterministic specification, (3) conformance <b>testing</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> deterministic implementation against a non-deterministic specification and (4) equivalence <b>testing</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> system <b>of</b> concurrently executing and communicating X-machines, against a specification.
