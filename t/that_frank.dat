5|$|Nancy Lenehan as Carol Strong, Brenda's {{mother and}} Roger's wife. When {{thinking}} <b>that</b> <b>Frank,</b> Jr. is a doctor, lawyer and Lutheran, she is highly ecstatic for her daughter's marriage.|$|E
5|$|On Monday, April 28, Frank, {{accompanied}} by his attorney, Luther Rosser, gave a written deposition to the police that provided a brief timeline of his activities on Saturday. He said Phagan was in his office between 12:05 and 12:10p.m., that Lee had arrived at 4p.m. but was asked to return later, and <b>that</b> <b>Frank</b> had a confrontation with ex-employee James Gantt at 6p.m. as Frank was leaving and Lee arriving. Frank explained that Lee's time card for Sunday morning had several gaps (Lee was supposed to punch in every half-hour) <b>that</b> <b>Frank</b> had missed when he discussed the time card with police on Sunday. At Rosser's insistence, Frank exposed his body to demonstrate {{that he had no}} cuts or injuries and the police found no blood on the suit <b>that</b> <b>Frank</b> said he had worn on Saturday. The police found no blood stains on the laundry at Frank's house.|$|E
25|$|Rumsfeld told Hume <b>that</b> <b>Franks</b> {{ultimately}} {{decided against}} such a troop level.|$|R
50|$|Some {{unspecified}} time later, it {{is revealed}} <b>that</b> <b>Frank's</b> spirit {{has become the}} protector of Hemingford.|$|R
2500|$|By {{the time}} the two men {{returned}} to Chicago, word had already spread <b>that</b> <b>Franks</b> was missing. Leopold called Franks's mother, identifying himself as [...] "George Johnson", and told her <b>that</b> <b>Franks</b> had been kidnapped; instructions for delivering the ransom would follow. After mailing the typed ransom note, burning their blood-stained clothing, and cleaning the bloodstains from the rented vehicle's upholstery as best they could, they spent {{the remainder of the}} evening playing cards.|$|R
5|$|He {{also told}} reporters that {{he was certain that}} Conley was the actual murderer. Slaton privately told friends that he would have issued a full pardon, if not for his belief <b>that</b> <b>Frank</b> would soon be able to prove his own innocence.|$|E
5|$|The ending credits reveal <b>that</b> <b>Frank</b> {{has been}} happily married for 26 years, has three sons, {{lives in the}} Midwest, is still good friends with Carl, has caught some of the world's most elusive money forgers, and earns {{millions}} of dollars each year because of his work creating unforgeable checks.|$|E
5|$|Critics cite {{a number}} of {{problems}} with the conviction. Local newspaper coverage, even before Frank was officially charged, was deemed to be inaccurate and prejudicial. Some claimed that the prosecutor Hugh Dorsey was under pressure for a quick conviction because of recent unsolved murders and made a premature decision <b>that</b> <b>Frank</b> was guilty, a decision that his personal ambition would not allow him to reconsider. Later analysis of evidence, primarily by Governor Slaton and Conley's attorney William Smith, seemed to exculpate Frank while implicating Conley.|$|E
50|$|On January 30, 2015 it was {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>Franks</b> was the new {{head coach of the}} Denver Pioneers men's soccer team.|$|R

5|$|In June 2008, {{producers}} Mark Canton, Gianni Nunnari and Bernie Goldmann {{revealed that}} work had begun on {{a sequel to}} 300, 300: Rise of an Empire. Legendary Pictures had announced <b>that</b> <b>Frank</b> Miller started writing the follow-up graphic novel, and Zack Snyder was interested in directing the adaptation, but moved on to develop and direct the Superman reboot Man of Steel. Noam Murro directed instead, while Zack Snyder produced. The film focused on the Athenian admiral, Themistocles, as portrayed by Australian actor Sullivan Stapleton. The sequel, , was released on March 7, 2014.|$|E
5|$|Leo Max Frank (April 17, 1884August 17, 1915) was an American factory {{superintendent}} who {{was convicted}} in 1913 {{of the murder of}} a 13-year-old employee, Mary Phagan, in Atlanta, Georgia. His trial, and lynching two years later, attracted national attention and became the focus of social, regional, political, and racial concerns, particularly regarding antisemitism. Today, the consensus of researchers on the subject holds <b>that</b> <b>Frank</b> was wrongly convicted.|$|E
5|$|Minton did {{not realize}} <b>that</b> <b>Frank</b> was also {{president}} of the University of Wisconsin, and soon suffered retaliation {{for the way he}} had treated Frank. Frank went on NBC radio stations around the country and lambasted Minton for his rudeness. He made lengthy arguments accusing Minton of attempting to violate the Bill of Rights. Minton was outraged, but the arguments had an effect among voters in Indiana. In 1938, he sought funding to launch a massive nationwide investigation of media conglomerates for proof of Republican interference in the press. Democratic Senator Edward R. Burke led an effort to defeat the measure and privately accused Minton of damaging the Democrats' cause, which led Minton to leave the Lobby Investigation Committee.|$|E

6000|$|It is {{needless to}} add <b>that</b> <b>Frank's</b> blue eyes sparkled with {{animation}} as he seized his friend's hand and replied, [...] "To the North Pole if you like, or farther if need be!" ...|$|R
50|$|After Frank's death, the Chicago {{newspapers}} {{were full of}} articles either praising or condemning the CPD. A coroner's inquest later determined <b>that</b> <b>Frank's</b> killing was a justifiable shooting since Frank had been resisting arrest.|$|R
5|$|Newt Lee, {{the night}} watchman, arrived at work shortly before 4:00 and Frank, who was {{normally}} calm, came bustling {{out of his}} office. Frank told Lee {{that he had not}} yet finished his own work and asked Lee to return at 6:00. Newt Lee noticed <b>that</b> <b>Frank</b> was very agitated and asked if he could sleep in the packing room, but Frank was insistent that Lee leave the building and told Lee to go out {{and have a good time}} in town before coming back.|$|E
5|$|On Tuesday, April 29, Black went to Lee's {{residence}} at 11a.m. looking for evidence, {{and found a}} blood-smeared shirt {{at the bottom of}} a burn barrel. The blood was smeared high up on the armpits and the shirt smelled unused, suggesting to the police that it was a plant. The detectives, suspicious of Frank due to his nervous behavior throughout his interviews, believed <b>that</b> <b>Frank</b> had arranged the plant.|$|E
5|$|Seven months later, Carl {{shows his}} boss <b>that</b> <b>Frank</b> has been forging checks all over western Europe and asks {{permission}} to go to Europe to look for him. When his boss refuses, Carl brings Frank's checks to printing professionals who claim that the checks were printed in France. From an interview with Frank's mother, Carl remembers that she was actually born in Montrichard, France. He goes there and locates Frank, and tells him that the French police will kill him {{if he does not}} go with Carl quietly. Frank assumes he is lying at first, but Carl promises Frank he would never lie to him, and Carl takes him outside, where the French police escort him to prison.|$|E
50|$|Writer Geoff Johns, who has {{collaborated with}} <b>Frank,</b> has opined <b>that</b> <b>Frank's</b> {{rendition}} of Superman {{is the best}} of his generation and that the only other artist in the same league with Frank in this regard is Curt Swan.|$|R
2500|$|Black {{lived in}} Seattle {{with his wife}} Catherine and {{daughter}} Jordan. Jordan was revealed to have inherited some measure of her father's [...] "gift", suggesting <b>that</b> <b>Frank's</b> abilities might be at least partly psychic, since Jordan's are clearly natural, not learned.|$|R
50|$|The title {{refers to}} the way <b>that</b> <b>Frank's</b> hopes to {{rejuvenate}} the docks by becoming involved with crime have had dire consequences {{for him and his}} family. It may also refer to the morning raids that wake everyone involved in the conspiracy.|$|R
5|$|The scene then flashes {{forward to}} a plane {{returning}} Frank home from prison, where Carl informs him that his father has died. Grief-stricken, Frank escapes from the plane {{and goes back to}} his old house, where he finds his mother with the man she left his father for, as well as a girl who Frank realizes is his half-sister. Frank gives himself up and is sentenced to 12 years in prison, getting visits from time to time from Carl. When Frank points out how one of the checks Carl is carrying as evidence is fake, Carl convinces the FBI to offer Frank a deal by which he can live out the remainder of his sentence working for the bank fraud department of the FBI, which Frank accepts. While working at the FBI, Frank misses the thrill of the chase and even attempts to fly as an airline pilot again. He is cornered by Carl, who insists <b>that</b> <b>Frank</b> will return to the FBI job since no one is chasing him. On the following Monday, Carl is nervous <b>that</b> <b>Frank</b> has not yet arrived at work. However, Frank eventually arrives and they discuss their next case.|$|E
5|$|By this time, Claire and Tom Yates {{have fallen}} in love, which complicates both their lives. During an {{unguarded}} moment, Claire tells Yates <b>that</b> <b>Frank</b> murdered Zoe Barnes and Congressman Peter Russo (Corey Stoll). She immediately regrets it, and tells Yates that they can't see each other anymore. In response, Yates threatens to publish a book detailing the Underwoods' crimes. Claire invites him to Usher's home, and poisons him. He dies while having sex with Claire, and she has Usher {{get rid of the}} body. Around this time, Claire and Frank convince Doug to take the fall for Zoe Barnes' death. Frank also starts to become suspicious of Claire as she disappears {{for a period of time}} (she had started talking to Davis in a secret corridor) and starts to memorize her testimony defending herself but not Frank, in case she has to testify.|$|E
5|$|In April 1939 Britten and Pears {{sailed to}} North America, going first to Canada {{and then to}} New York. They had several reasons for leaving England, {{including}} the difficult position of pacifists in an increasingly bellicose Europe; the success <b>that</b> <b>Frank</b> Bridge had enjoyed in the US; the departure of Auden and his friend Christopher Isherwood to the US from England three months previously; hostile or belittling reviews of Britten's music in the English press; and under-rehearsed and inadequate performances. Britten and Pears consummated their relationship and from then until Britten's death they were partners in both their professional and personal lives. When the Second World War began, Britten and Pears turned for advice to the British embassy in Washington and {{were told that they}} should remain in the US as artistic ambassadors. Pears was inclined to disregard the advice and go back to England; Britten also felt the urge to return, but accepted the embassy's counsel and persuaded Pears to do the same.|$|E
50|$|Franks {{heart attack}}: Frank {{has a heart}} attack while {{on the roof of}} his house. He ends up in a coma and, having an out-of-body experience, sees his life flash before his eyes. It is {{revealed}} here <b>that</b> <b>Franks</b> father served and was killed in World War II.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's the {{question}} Grafton folks {{have been asking}} for quite a while, I reckon, Anne. Well, I'd {{have no objection to}} marrying Ludovic. <b>That's</b> <b>frank</b> enough for you, isn't it? But it's not easy to marry a man unless he asks you. And Ludovic has never asked me." ...|$|R
40|$|Nyquist Pulse-shaping {{is one of}} {{the methods}} used to {{mitigate}} the effects of frequency offset in OFDM system which result in intercarrier interference (ICI). In this paper, the performance of coded OFDM(COFDM) with various Nyquist pulse shaping over AWGN channel with carrier frequency offset (CFO) are investigated. It is observed from simulation results <b>that</b> the <b>Franks</b> pulse outperforms all Nyquist pulses considered here in term of BER performance. Numerical results for ICI power reduction show <b>that</b> <b>Franks</b> and DJ pulses are quite similar, and outperform other pulses considered in this paper...|$|R
5|$|Jeffrey again visits Dorothy's {{apartment}} {{and she tells}} him that although she knows nothing about him, she has been yearning for him. Jeffrey attends another of Dorothy's performances at the club, where she sings the same song. At the club, Jeffrey spots Frank in the audience fondling a piece of blue velvet fabric he cut from Dorothy's robe. Jeffrey follows Frank and spends {{the next few days}} spying on him. Shortly afterwards, two men that Jeffrey calls the Well-Dressed Man and the Yellow Man exit an industrial building <b>that</b> <b>Frank</b> frequently visits. Jeffrey concludes the men are criminal associates of Frank, and tells his new findings to Sandy. The two briefly kiss, though she feels uncomfortable about going any further. Jeffrey immediately visits Dorothy again, and the two have sex. However, when he refuses to hit her, she pressures him, becoming more emotional. In a blind rage he knocks her backwards and is instantly horrified, but Dorothy derives pleasure from it.|$|E
5|$|Phoenix Wright, a newly-hired defense {{attorney}} at the Fey and Co. law firm, agrees to represent {{his best friend}} Larry Butz, who {{has been charged with}} the murder of his girlfriend, Cindy Stone. With the help of his boss and mentor, Mia Fey, he proves <b>that</b> <b>Frank</b> Sahwit, the prosecution's star witness, is the real murderer. Shortly thereafter, Mia is killed in her office, and her younger sister Maya is arrested after the police find her name on a note left by Mia. Phoenix takes her case, facing off against Miles Edgeworth, an equally-talented prosecutor. Phoenix manages to identify Redd White, a professional blackmailer, as the real killer, only to find himself charged with the killing instead. Representing himself, he exposes White in court and gets justice for Mia. His reputation established, Phoenix takes on another case, this time defending Will Powers, the lead actor in a children's TV show, against accusations that he killed his co-star, Jack Hammer. In a bizarre twist, it is revealed that Dee Vasquez, the show's producer, committed the murder in self-defense after Hammer tried to kill her and frame Powers for her death.|$|E
5|$|Symbolism is used {{heavily in}} Blue Velvet. The most {{consistent}} symbolism {{in the film}} is an insect motif introduced {{at the end of}} the first scene, when the camera zooms in on a well-kept suburban lawn until it unearths a swarming underground nest of disgusting bugs. This is generally recognized as a metaphor for the seedy underworld that Jeffrey will soon discover under the surface of his own suburban, Reaganesque paradise. The severed ear he finds is being overrun by black ants. The bug motif is recurrent throughout the film, most notably in the bug-like gas mask <b>that</b> <b>Frank</b> wears, but also the excuse that Jeffrey uses to gain access to Dorothy's apartment: he claims to be an insect exterminator. One of Frank's sinister accomplices is also consistently identified through the yellow jacket he wears, possibly reminiscent of the name of a type of wasp. Finally, a robin eating a bug on a fence becomes a topic of discussion in the last scene of the film. The robin, mentioned earlier by Sandy when she recounted her dream, represents love conquering evil.|$|E
5000|$|Whatever {{his role}} {{may have been}} on <b>that</b> day, <b>Franks</b> {{was known as a}} devotee of Durocher-style, win-at-any-cost baseball, {{including}} intimidation through flying spikes and brushback pitching. Dodger outfielder Carl Furillo told author Roger Kahn <b>that</b> <b>Franks</b> was known to poke his head into the Brooklyn clubhouse before games, to taunt Furillo that Giant pitchers were planning to throw at his head in the upcoming contest. Furillo, whose hatred for Durocher was so intense that he would engage Durocher in a fistfight in a Giant dugout filled with enemy players, said of the Giants, in Peter Golenbock's book Bums: An Oral History of the Brooklyn Dodgers, [...] "They were dirty ballplayers ... They all wanted to be like Durocher, to copy Durocher. <b>That</b> Herman <b>Franks,</b> he was another one." ...|$|R
