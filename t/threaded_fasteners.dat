2500|$|Pre-industrial {{machinery}} {{was built}} by various craftsmen – millwrights built water and wind mills, carpenters made wooden framing, and smiths and turners made metal parts. Wooden components had the disadvantage of changing dimensions with temperature and humidity, and the various joints tended to rack (work loose) over time. [...] As the Industrial Revolution progressed, machines with metal parts and frames became more common. [...] Other important uses of metal parts were in firearms and <b>threaded</b> <b>fasteners,</b> such as machine screws, bolts and nuts. There was also the need for precision in making parts.

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{concept of a}} <b>threaded</b> <b>fastener</b> that is {{resistant}} to loosening under vibration. The anti-loosening feature does not use any additional element {{and is based on}} modifying the geometry of the thread in the bolt. In a normal nut and bolt combination, the axial motion of the nut or bolt is linearly related to the rotation by a constant pitch. In the proposed concept, the axial motion in the bolt is chosen to be a cubic function of the rotation, while for the nut, the axial motion remains linearly related to the rotation. This mismatch results in interference during the tightening process and additional torque required to overcome this interference gives rise to the enhanced anti-loosening property. In addition, the cubic curve is designed to ensure that the mismatch results in stresses and deformation in the elastic region of the chosen material. This ensures that the nut can be removed and reused while maintaining a repeatable anti-loosening property in the <b>threaded</b> <b>fastener.</b> A finite element analysis demonstrates the feasibility of this concept...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work is to investigate the ultimate load, behaviour characteristics and failure modes of <b>threaded</b> steel <b>fasteners</b> subjected to various combinations of tension and shear loads at elevated deformation rates. <b>Threaded</b> steel <b>fasteners</b> are often used to assemble members and components in engineering structures, and the behaviour characteristics of each individual fastener can have a significant influence {{on the performance of}} the total structure. Hence, before the response of a structure can be determined based on a given load scenario the behaviour of each of the involved components and joints must be known as well as the material behaviour at the deformation rates representative for the load situation. The work carried out in this thesis is presented in a synopsis, providing the background, the objectives, the strategy and a summary of the project. Then three individual papers/parts follow where two have been published in peer reviewed journals and the third has been submitted for potential journal publication. The first two papers are dealing with the tensile behaviour of <b>threaded</b> steel <b>fasteners</b> at elevated rates of strain. The objective was to investigate the ultimate tensile load, behaviour characteristics and failure modes. In the first paper, results and observation from the experimental study were presented, and the Alexander model was modified to consider the ultimate load and mode of failure at high loading rates. In the second paper, results from a numerical study were presented. The numerical study was based on the experimental results obtained from the first part. An axisymmetric finite element model was used to predict the tension behaviour characteristics and the failure modes of the <b>threaded</b> steel <b>fasteners.</b> Comparison of results between simulations and experiments showed that the axisymmetric finite element model captured the ultimate load and the overall behaviour characteristics with good accuracy. It was observed that the failure modes were influenced by the thread engagement length, the grip length and the strain-rate. The third paper explores the ultimate load and behaviour characteristics of <b>threaded</b> steel <b>fasteners</b> exposed to combined tension and shear load at elevated deformation rates. An experimental and a numerical study were conducted. In the experimental study, the loading angle was 0 °, 45 ° and 90 °, where 0 ° corresponded to loading along the axis of the <b>threaded</b> steel <b>fasteners.</b> The numerical study was carried out using a three-dimensional finite element model. Simulations were performed at the same deformation rates as in the experiments, while the load was applied at different angles varying between 0 º and 90 º with 15 º intervals. Interaction curves were established based on both the experimental and the numerical results. The numerical model was found to capture the ultimate load and the overall behaviour characteristics with reasonable accuracy. PhD i konstruksjonsteknikkPhD in Structural Engineerin...|$|R
