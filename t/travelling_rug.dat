5000|$|At 1:45 pm on Friday 23 July 1943 nurse Doris Irene Mitchell {{went to the}} air-raid shelter where Brown's bath {{chair was}} kept. She found that {{the door was locked}} from the inside and upon {{returning}} with Mrs Brown they had met Eric Brown, then aged 19, coming out. Eric was irritated and evasive. Both women took the wheeled chair to the house and helped Archibald to get in. Brown was dressed in pyjamas and a dressing gown and was covered with a plaid <b>travelling</b> <b>rug.</b> Mitchell took Archibald Brown out of the house. After walking for about a mile, Brown had shifted his weight apparently while feeling for a cigarette in his pocket. Mitchell, having stopped to light the cigarette returned {{to the back of the}} chair and pushed it forward. Within half a dozen paces there was a violent explosion. [...] Mitchell suffered leg injuries and as far as she could see Brown and his bath chair had completely disappeared. The police found portions of the body at the side of the road and in nearby trees and gardens.|$|E

5000|$|... "Down-and-dirty disco highlight," [...] "Bus Station" [...] {{was written}} by Walker in the eighties. The lyrics include the line, [...] "Fat girl with a <b>travel</b> <b>rug</b> / She’s got a Chiko Roll". Barnes said, [...] "Yeah, the fat girl holding a Chiko Roll under a blanket line. Don, being a voyeur, thought it was sexy. It’s very symbolic. Don is a very sick man." ...|$|R
60|$|We rebuilt our fire, {{after many}} {{repeated}} demands for kindling, which had apparently to be sawed and split {{in a distant}} wood-yard before we could get it, and then the long, arctic night set in, unrelieved by the noisy gayeties of the cafe across the way. These burst {{from time to time}} the thin film of sleep which formed like a coating of ice over the consciousness, and then one could only get up and put more wood into the despairing stove and more clothes on the beds. Well for us that we had thought to bring all our <b>travelling</b> <b>rugs</b> with us in straps, instead of abandoning them with our other baggage in the station till next day! But, even with these heaping the hotel blankets and com-forters, we shivered, and a superannuated odor that had lurked in the recesses of those rooms, to which the sun or wind had never pierced, grew with the growing cold, and haunted the night like something palpable as well as sensible--the materialization of smells dead and buried there long ago. It was wonderful how little way the electric bulb shed its beams in that naughty air; it would not even light the page which at one time was opened in the vain hope that the author would help the benumbing cold to bring torpor if not slumber to the weary brain.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} fourteenth century, Marco Polo {{wrote in the}} account of his <b>travels</b> about Anatolian <b>rugs.</b> Other thirteenth-century European {{travellers}} who journeyed to the court of the Mongol Empire were André de Longjumeau, William of Rubruck and Giovanni da Pian del Carpine with Benedykt Polak. None of them visited China except Marco Polo. The Moroccan merchant Ibn Battuta travelled with the Golden Horde and through China in the early-to-mid-14th century. The 14th-century English author John de Mandeville wrote an account of his journeys in the East. The travellers sometimes cursorily mention carpets, but only the luxurious carpets which they saw at royal courts seem to have attracted greater interest.|$|R
6000|$|From Curzon Street the tiger-skin <b>rug</b> <b>travelled</b> {{down to the}} Manor House, and was duly {{inspected}} {{and admired}} by the county, and it seemed a fitting and appropriate thing when Mrs. Packletide went to the County Costume Ball {{in the character of}} Diana. She refused to fall in, however, with Clovis's tempting suggestion of a primeval dance party, at which every one should wear the skins of beasts they had recently slain. [...] "I should be in rather a Baby Bunting condition," [...] confessed Clovis, [...] "with a miserable rabbit-skin or two to wrap up in, but then," [...] he added, with a rather malicious glance at Diana's proportions, [...] "my figure is quite as good as that Russian dancing boy's." ...|$|R
