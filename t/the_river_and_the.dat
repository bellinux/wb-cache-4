5|$|About 10 to 20 {{white-tailed deer}} {{per square mile}} (2.6 to 5.2 deer per square kilometer) live along <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> parkway, more than the {{ecosystem}} can carry. They eat low-lying plants, shrubs, and tree saplings, reducing the food supply for smaller animals. The deer also collide with cars—in Hastings, about 1.6 times per month.|$|E
5|$|American captain Robert Gray and British captain George Vancouver, who {{explored}} {{the river in}} 1792, proved {{that it was possible}} to cross the Columbia Bar. Many of the challenges associated with that feat remain today; even with modern engineering alterations to the mouth of the river, the strong currents and shifting sandbar make it dangerous to pass between <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Pacific Ocean.|$|E
50|$|The Salang is a 438 {{kilometre}} long {{river of}} Afghanistan, flowing through Parwan Province. It is {{a tributary of}} <b>the</b> Indus <b>River</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Ghorband <b>River</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Panjshir <b>River</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Kabul <b>River.</b>|$|R

5|$|Between Randville and {{the former}} {{community}} of Metropolitan, M-69 runs along the West Branch of the Sturgeon River through more hilly terrain. The trunkline continues east to the twin communities of Theodore and Felch. <b>The</b> <b>river</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> road part ways until meeting again at Foster City. This is also {{the location of a}} unique junction of highways. M-69 meets G-69, a County-Designated Highway that runs south to Loretto in southern Dickinson County. The intersection in unique because some states, such as California, do not allow two highways to share a common number.|$|E
5|$|During {{the nearby}} Second Battle of Naktong Bulge, the North Korean People's Army {{broke through the}} US Army's 2nd Infantry Division lines along the Naktong River. Exploiting this weakness, the NK 9th Division and NK 4th Division {{attacked}} to Yongsan, a village east of <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> gateway to the UN lines of supply and reinforcement for the Pusan Perimeter. What followed was a fight between North Korean and US forces for Yongsan.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, the Oceanside Development Agency {{recommended}} that the new highway be extended west to Pacific Street to aid in redeveloping the downtown area. The San Diego Regional Coastal Commission disagreed with constructing the highway, among other development proposals for downtown Oceanside, due to concerns about destroying habitat along <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> marsh areas. Soon after, in October1980, the California Coastal Commission recommended removing the realignment of the freeway from plans entirely, on environmental grounds.|$|E
5|$|Like all creeks in Lycoming County, Larrys Creek {{served as}} an area for {{settlers}} to establish homesteads and farms. As logging became a major industry in the mid-19th century, the creek {{was a source of}} power for sawmills and other mills. The first sawmill on the creek, in what is now Mifflin Township, was built in 1799. The relatively low flow of water in the creek did not allow rafts of logs to be floated downstream to <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lumber boom at Williamsport (as they were on Pine Creek to the west).|$|E
5|$|The Somerset River Authority was {{established}} in the 1960s, and later became part of Wessex Water. Tidal models were used to explore the effects of any improvements to <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> likelihood of adverse consequences, i.e. flooding and subsequent silting. Engineering works were undertaken at the Parrett, King's Sedgemoor Drain, and River Brue systems, to try to ensure that the agricultural land benefited from a potable water supply in the groundwaters from the Quantock Hills to the coastline.|$|E

5|$|The island's {{proximity}} to <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ocean {{suggests that the}} area is suited to fishing and related activities, yet the indigenous people, mostly land-dwellers, have long been content to practise artisan fishing, just to supply their own daily needs. Pirogues cut from the trunks of kapok trees are most often used, along with traps, nets, baskets, and fences. In the early 20th century, experienced fishermen {{from other parts of}} Senegal, along with others from Mali, Guinea, and Ghana, developed deep-sea fishing on the island and introduced new equipment.|$|E
5|$|The {{shifting}} Columbia Bar makes passage between <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Pacific Ocean {{difficult and}} dangerous, and numerous rapids {{along the river}} hinder navigation. Pacific Graveyard, a 1964 book by James A. Gibbs, describes the many shipwrecks {{near the mouth of}} the Columbia. Jetties, first constructed in 1886, extend the river's channel into the ocean. Strong currents and the shifting sandbar remain a threat to ships entering the river and necessitate continuous maintenance of the jetties.|$|E

5|$|After Prop 17 lost by a voter {{margin of}} 53–47, the project's opponents – which {{had grown to}} include other {{environmental}} groups, such as the Friends of <b>the</b> <b>River</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sierra Club – shifted their focus on limiting {{the amount of water}} the reservoir could hold, rather than trying to stop the dam altogether. In the meantime, construction on the dam continued to progress. On April 1, 1978 the gates of the diversion tunnel were closed, and New Melones Lake began to fill, soon inundating the old Melones Dam. As the reservoir filled, work moved ahead on the power plant and generating units, which were all completed by the end of 1978. The main embankment of the dam was topped out on October 28, 1978.|$|E
5|$|Although the 25th Division {{generally}} {{was under}} less pressure from North Korean units after September 5, {{there were still}} severe local attacks. On September 6, 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry, moved north from the Haman area to join 2nd Battalion in the cleanup of North Korean troops behind the 35th Infantry and below the Nam River. Caught between the 35th Infantry on its hill positions along <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> attacking 27th Infantry units, large numbers of North Koreans were killed. Sixteen different groups reportedly were dispersed with heavy casualties during the day. By morning of September 7 there was clear evidence that survivors of the NK 7th Division were trying to escape across the Nam River. However the North Koreans launched another attack against the 35th Infantry, which it quickly repulsed. The 25th Infantry Division buried more than 2,000 North Korean dead, killed between September 1 and 7 behind its lines. This number did not include those killed in front of its positions.|$|E

5|$|Although the Rivière des Prairies is {{much smaller}} than the Saint Lawrence, bridge {{construction}} there did not begin until the 1840s—when rapid construction began on three wooden toll bridges to what is now Laval, one of which, Pont des Saints-Anges, collapsed in the 1880s and was never rebuilt. The existence of regular ferry services across the river is attested from 1813, but these ferries were discontinued when the bridges opened. The first railroad across the river was opened in 1876, and the Bordeaux Railway Bridge is the oldest fixed link to Laval that is still standing. (Another bridge across Rivière des Mille Îles, which was part of the same line, collapsed in 1882 but was immediately rebuilt.) The highway construction boom of the 1960s and 1970s led to the construction of four new freeway bridges across <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> upgrading of the existing Pie IX Bridge to freeway standards.|$|E
5|$|As {{the route}} heads through Ashland, it {{generally}} {{turns to the}} southeast to match the curvature of the Chemung River valley, which contains the river, NY427, and the Southern Tier Expressway (NY17).

In {{the center of the}} village, NY427, named Front Street, intersects with the northern end of NY367, a short highway linking NY427 to the Pennsylvania border. Just east of NY367, NY427 intersects County Route8 (CR8), a highway that crosses the Chemung River and links Wellsburg to NY17 at exit58.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Rus' {{attempted}} to trap the Mongols. The princes of Galich and Volhynia transported their armies south down the river, while the princes of Kiev and Chernigov advanced north up <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> army of Kursk advanced from the front. At the same time, the Cumans attempted {{to attack the}} Mongol army's rear. When Jebe learned of this, he sent 10 envoys to the Prince of Kiev. The envoys stated that the Mongols had no feud with the Rus and were only attacking the Cumans; they added that the Mongols were marching east, away from the Rus' cities. Mstislav of Kiev had the envoys executed, and the Mongols responded by sending another set of ambassadors, who declared war.* de Hartog, Genghis Khan: Conqueror of the World, p. 120* Munro, The Rise of the Russian Empire, p. 81.|$|E
