25|$|Powers was {{appointed}} {{the head coach}} at Bowling Green on July 12, 1994, becoming the fourth head coach in the program’s history. During the 1994-'95 campaign, Powers led the Falcons to a 25-11-2 record and a second-place finish in the CCHA. It marked their best finish {{in the league in}} eight years. He was named the CCHA’s Coach of the Year and was a finalist for the Spencer Penrose Award presented annually to the nation’s <b>top</b> <b>head</b> coach. Also that year, Brian Holzinger was named CCHA player of the Year. Holzinger won the NCAA All-American Award in ice hockey along with BGSU's Kelly Perrault. Holzinger became BGSU's second Hobey Baker Award winner, the other being George McPhee in 1982 during Powers' first season as BGSU's assistant coach.|$|E
25|$|Drums with {{cylindrical}} shells can be open {{at one end}} (as is {{the case}} with timbales), or can have two drum heads, one head on each end. Single-headed drums typically consist of a skin stretched over an enclosed space, or over one of the ends of a hollow vessel. Drums with two heads covering both ends of a cylindrical shell often have a small hole somewhat halfway between the two heads; the shell forms a resonating chamber for the resulting sound. Exceptions include the African slit drum, also known as a log drum as it is made from a hollowed-out tree trunk, and the Caribbean steel drum, made from a metal barrel. Drums with two heads can also have a set of wires, called snares, held across the bottom head, <b>top</b> <b>head,</b> or both heads, hence the name snare drum. On some drums with two heads, a hole or bass reflex port may be cut or installed onto one head, as with some 2010s era bass drums in rock music.|$|E
2500|$|Snare drums used in pipe {{bands are}} similar in {{construction}} to standard marching snare drums, with two key differences. First, the drum has an additional set of snares, directly under the batter (<b>top)</b> <b>head.</b> Second, the snares under the bottom head are made of coiled steel wires, similar to a drumset (as opposed to the synthetic [...] "gut" [...] snares on a corps-style drum). These differences tend to give the pipe drums a [...] "snappier" [...] snare sound, emphasizing the higher frequencies of the drum. Recently, corps-style drums have been produced with steel wire snares underneath the batter head (while remaining the gut snares under the bottom head). These snares are able to be switched on and off separate from the bottom snares, which allows units to use the second snares as a specific effect or as a permanent modification {{to the sound of}} the drum.|$|E
50|$|This is {{a common}} {{configuration}} (in order of layout), but there are countless other configurations available. For instance; a multi head moulder may have two bottom <b>heads</b> and two <b>top</b> <b>heads</b> in order to size the lumber with the first top and the first bottom head, and then finish cut the lumber with the remaining <b>top</b> and bottom <b>head.</b>|$|R

50|$|One {{approach}} is to loosen the batter head a quarter to a half turn. Another way is to either increase or decrease the pitch of the bottom head so that it's different from the pitch of the <b>top</b> <b>head.</b> Either of these approaches produces a slightly more dry, funkier sound.|$|E
