5|$|After {{the events}} of November 1, the Terminal and Traction Company hired 300 {{professional}} strikebreakers from the Pinkerton Agency in Chicago to operate the streetcars. Todd wrote {{an open letter to}} the city leadership alleging that illegitimate forces from outside the state were behind the events, and that his workers did not truly desire to unionize. He wrote <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>his</b> workers could only get adequate police protection, they could resume normal operations.|$|E
5|$|Director of {{photography}} Mark Irwin was fired during filming of Screams finale, {{a week before}} principal photography was to be completed. Upon review of the dailies, Craven found the footage was out of focus and unusable. Irwin was initially ordered to fire his camera crew. He retorted <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>his</b> crew were to be fired, they {{would also have to}} fire him. The producers fired him and replaced him with Peter Deming, who finished the film.|$|E
5|$|On August 8, 1993, Wallace's {{longtime}} girlfriend {{gave birth}} to his first child, T'yanna. Wallace had split with the girlfriend for some time before T'yanna's birth. Wallace wanted his daughter to complete her education, despite being {{a high school dropout}} himself. Wallace said <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>his</b> mother had promised him what he promised his daughter, everything she wanted, Wallace would have been not only a graduate but also {{at the top of his}} class. He continued selling drugs after the birth to support his daughter financially. Once Combs discovered this, he forced Wallace to quit.|$|E

She says <b>that</b> even <b>if</b> <b>his</b> story is true, he was just an angry person acting out and not a case of [...] "a working-class hero".|$|R
5|$|Some Russian nationalists, such as Dmitry Rogozin and the Movement Against Illegal Immigration, {{stated that}} they would like to see Lukashenko become President of Russia in 2008. Lukashenko responded that he would not run for the Russian presidency, but <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>his</b> health was still good, he might run for reelection in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Baron Yamaki (Sessue Hayakawa) is a {{fisherman}} who lives {{along with his}} daughter Toya San (Tsuru Aoki) on an island. The island is inhabited by Buddhists and Yamaki had been cursed by Buddha for an affront {{by one of his}} ancestors who in a murderous rage, defiled an altar of Buddha in the nearby temple. The curse was <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>his</b> daughter married anyone, then the nearby volcano would erupt. Toya finds it difficult to form relationships with boys because the village prophet Takeo (Thomas Kurihara) has spread the rumour that she is cursed. She is therefore unwilling to continue her father's acceptance of the curse. When Yamaki takes Toya-san to the Buddha shrine in the garden of his house to pray and try to get the curse removed, she vents her feelings about the god's unfairness.|$|E
5|$|Castellaneta started acting {{after his}} {{graduation}} from Northern Illinois University in 1979. He decided <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>his</b> career went nowhere {{he would still}} have a chance to try something else. He began taking improvisation classes, where he met his future wife Deb Lacusta. Castellaneta started to work at The Second City, an improvisational theatre in Chicago, in 1983 and continued to work there until 1987. During this period, he did voice-over work with his wife for various radio stations. He auditioned for a role in The Tracey Ullman Show and his first meeting underwhelmed Tracey Ullman and the other producers. Ullman decided to fly to Chicago to watch Castellaneta perform. His performance that night was about a blind man who tries to become a comedian and Ullman later recalled that although there were flashier performances that night, Castellaneta made her cry. She was impressed and Castellaneta was hired.|$|E

"Now {{it strikes}} me," [...] remarked Harry, {{as he sat}} down on the edge of Charley's bed and thrust his hands doggedly down into his pockets, while Hamilton tucked up his sleeves and {{assaulted}} a washhand-basin which stood on an unpainted wooden chair in a corner--"it strikes me <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>that's</b> <b>his</b> usual style of behaviour, old Whyte is a pleasure that we didn't anticipate." ...|$|R

50|$|Alfred is left emotionally shattered, commenting {{more than}} once <b>that,</b> even <b>if</b> <b>his</b> {{biological}} fatherhood is a fabrication, in a deeper sense he actually was Bruce Wayne's father, having watched over him for years and feeling he failed him in the last moments.|$|R
5|$|The Emperor assured Mary {{that he had}} {{no doubts}} about her loyalty to the Roman Catholic Church. He had learned that the Queen could not easily be bullied, {{especially}} not in matters which affected her personally. Yet, upon leaving the States General in October 1531, Charles gave her a warning, saying <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>his</b> parent, wife, child or sibling became a follower of Luther, he would consider them his greatest enemy. Mary was thus forced to suppress Protestantism in the Netherlands, regardless of her own religious tolerance. However, she always strived to enforce her brother's laws on religion as little as possible. She was accused of protecting Protestants on several occasions.|$|E
5|$|Zardari {{called for}} no delays to the 8 January {{parliamentary}} elections {{and for the}} participation of all opposition parties. Other major political parties quickly agreed to participate, ending any chance of a boycott. Because of the turmoil after the Bhutto assassination, the elections were postponed six weeks to 18 February. In January 2008, he suggested <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>his</b> party did win a majority, it might form a coalition with Musharraf's Pakistan Muslim League-Q (PML-Q). He and Nawaz Sharif, leader of the Pakistan Muslim League (N) party (PML-N), threatened national protests if any vote-rigging was attempted. He himself could not run for Parliament because he had not filed election papers in November 2008, back when he had no foreseeable political ambition while Bhutto was alive.|$|E

25|$|McLaren's father, James, {{said that}} the truth was {{inconvenient}} for the army; pointing out <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>his</b> son {{could get out of}} the base undetected, someone could get in. He also {{said that the}} typical wait for a service family to have an inquest into a death would be two years; his son's inquest came after only 5 months.|$|E
25|$|He {{was proud}} that a letter sent to “Bill George, Devil’s Castle, Bloodhound Corner, Tyke Lane, London” reached him, but {{disappointed}} when one sent to “Mr. Bill George, Dog Fancier, London” {{was returned to}} the sender. He {{is said to have}} asked the name of the Postmaster General, and, when told it was Lord John Manners, replied, “Tell those fools in the Post Office <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>his</b> Lordship don’t know me, I don’t know manners”.|$|E

25|$|An {{experienced}} businessman, van Leeuwenhoek believed <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>his</b> {{simple method}} {{for creating the}} critically important lens was revealed, the scientific community of his time would likely disregard or even forget his role in microscopy. He therefore allowed others {{to believe that he}} was laboriously spending most of his nights and free time grinding increasingly tiny lenses to use in microscopes, even though this belief conflicted both with his construction of hundreds of microscopes and his habit of building a new microscope whenever he chanced upon an interesting specimen that he wanted to preserve. He made about 200 microscopes with a different magnification.|$|E
25|$|Another notable {{action of}} his term was a strict new ethics law. When campaigning for {{re-election}} in 2006, Blagojevich said <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>his</b> ethics law had existed when former governor George Ryan had been in office, Ryan's corruption might not have occurred. Blagojevich also signed a comprehensive death penalty reform bill that was written by then-Senator Barack Obama and the late U.S. Senator Paul M. Simon. Organized labor and African Americans were Blagojevich's staunchest political supporters. In 2008, he {{told a group of}} African-Americans that he sometimes considered himself the first African American governor of Illinois.|$|E
25|$|Another {{group of}} critics, {{generally}} {{of the political}} left, argues that Ehrlich emphasizes overpopulation too much as a problem in itself, instead of distribution of resources. Barry Commoner argued that Ehrlich emphasized overpopulation too much {{as the source of}} environmental problems, and that his proposed solutions were politically unacceptable because of the coercion that they implied, and because they would cost poor people disproportionately. He argued that technological, and above all social development would result in a natural decrease of both population growth and environmental damage. Ehrlich denies any type of racism, and has argued <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>his</b> policy ideas were implemented properly they would not be repressive.|$|E

25|$|Copernicus' actual book {{began with}} a letter from his (by then deceased) friend Nikolaus von Schönberg, Cardinal Archbishop of Capua, urging Copernicus to publish his theory. Then, in a lengthy introduction, Copernicus {{dedicated}} the book to Pope Paul III, explaining his ostensible motive in writing the book as relating to the inability of earlier astronomers to agree on an adequate theory of the planets, and noting <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>his</b> system increased the accuracy of astronomical predictions it would allow the Church to develop a more accurate calendar. At that time, a reform of the Julian Calendar was considered necessary {{and was one of}} the major reasons for the Church's interest in astronomy.|$|E
25|$|On August 11, 2015, Lessig {{announced}} {{the formation of}} an exploratory committee in preparation for a possible bid for the Democratic Party's nomination for President of the United States in 2016. Lessig vowed <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>his</b> committee could raise one million dollars by Labor Day 2015, and if the leading Democratic candidates for president had not yet committed to fundamental elections reform as their first priority, he would run for president. The announcement was widely reported in national media outlets, and was timed to coincide with a media blitz by the Lessig 2016 Campaign. Lessig was interviewed in The New York Times and Bloomberg. Campaign messages and Lessig's electoral finance reform positions were circulated widely on social media.|$|E
25|$|After the {{proposals}} passed both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate twice, {{as required by}} Article 138 of the Italian constitution, Renzi {{announced that he would}} hold a referendum to secure the endorsement of the Italian people for the change. In January 2016, announcing an October date for the referendum, Matteo Renzi stated <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>his</b> reforms were rejected he would resign as Prime Minister and leave politics. Some opposition parties, predominantly Five Star Movement, Lega Nord and Italian Left, and also some newspapers like Il Fatto Quotidiano and Il manifesto, accused Renzi of turning the referendum into a plebiscite on his premiership with those comments. However, after some months, Renzi said that his government will continue {{until the end of the}} legislature.|$|E
