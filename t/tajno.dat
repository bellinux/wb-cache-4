40|$|Extensive {{geophysical}} {{investigations in}} NE Poland in the 1950 s and 1960 s {{led to the}} discovery of an alkaline and carbonatite magmatic province buried under thick (600 - 800 m) Meso-Cenozoic cover north of the Trans-European Suture Zone, or Tornquist Line. Drilling focused on geophysical anomalies identified three intrusions in the Paleoproterozoic metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks of the Mazowsze Domain: the Pisz gabbro-syenite massif, the Ełk syenite massif, and the small, differentiated <b>Tajno</b> body consisting of clinopyroxenite cumulates and syenites crosscut by carbonatite veins. Emplacement ages for these intrusions have been obtained by (1) zircon U-Pb geochronology on a gabbro from Pisz, a syenite from Ełk, and an albitite from <b>Tajno</b> and (2) a Re-Os model age for pyrrhotite from a <b>Tajno</b> carbonatite. The ages measured by both methods fall in the narrow range 354 - 345 Ma (Early Carboniferous: Tournaisian). This is slightly younger than the Late Devonian (380 - 360 Ma) Kola Peninsula alkaline and carbonatite province (20 intrusions) of NW Russia and Karelia but is of comparable age to the first manifestations of the long-lasting (~ 100 m. yr.) Carboniferous to Permian magmatic event (360 - 250 Ma) manifest in northern Europe (from the British Isles to southern Scandinavia, the North Sea, and northern Germany) in the foreland of the Variscan orogeny (in the so-called West European Carboniferous Basin) and the East European Craton. © 2013 by The University of Chicago.

The Carboniferous {{alkaline}} intrusions, which cut the Precambrian {{basement of}} East European Platform are known only from drillings. The massifs {{are covered by}} Mesozoic and Cenozoic sediments (600 – 800 m) and their borders were defined by extensive geophysical investigations. The <b>Tajno</b> alkaline-carbonatite complex, the Ełk syenite massif, the Pisz gabbro-syenite complex as well as alkaline rocks recognized as Mława or Olsztynek anomaly {{are the subject of}} systematic and complex analyses. All of them could be the potential sources for rare earth elements. The massifs were explore by several boreholes (about 12, 000 m of drill core material; e. g. Ełk IG 1 - 4, <b>Tajno</b> IG 1 - 12, Prostki 1 - 2, Klusy- 1, Grajewo IG- 1). Thus, the main aim of our study is to precisely identify the perspective drill-core intervals within the Ełk IG 4 borehole materials for better defining of locations for detailed sampling and further laboratory analysis. For this purpose we had applied handheld XRF DELTA 50 Premium spectrometers equipped with a 4 W Ta anode X-ray tube (50 kV). The parameters of spectrometers (higher voltage and multi-beam system) are optimized for rare earth elements (REEs) such as Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd. Handheld XRF nondestructive analyses allowed the identification of mineralized trends and anomalies within the drill-core material at the ppm level. The previous testing analyses enabled to optimize times of acquisition for each beam and provide fast field analyses (about 100 per day). The contents of La and Ce were chosen as indicators of the REE-bearing minerals occurrence in analyzed rocks. The XRF analyses were performed for each meter of drill core. The graph of these elements content vs. depth of the samples from Ełk IG 4 borehole exhibited high differentiation. The highest and lowest content of La was 17 ppm and 3241 ppm, respectively (average 167 ppm for 1185 samples, without 78 below the level of detection) and Ce – 24 ppm and 4313 ppm (average 294 ppm for 1214 samples, without 49 below the level of detection). The higher content of REE elements seems to be related to concentration of minerals such as pyroxene, mica, titanite, monazite, zircon, f luoro-carbonate as well as t he presence of secondary veins in smaller amounts.

40|$|Braća Antun i Mihovil Vrančić u svojem su se dopisivanju povremeno služila kodiranim porukama. Zahvaljujući istraživanju D. Sorić i autora ovog rada Mihovilove su šifre nedavno odgonetnute, dok je kratki Antunov šifrirani zapis ostao neproničan. Naime, u pismu iz Francuske 1546. godine Antun se poslužio drugačijim šiframa od onih kojima se kasnije koristio Mihovil. U ovom radu pokazuje se kako je napokon odgonetnuta i Antunova šifra. U tom poslu frekvencija znakova slabo je pomagala jer je poruka vrlo kratka. Koncentracija na prvu riječ također nije vodila pravim putem, budući da su prva dva znaka, kako se poslije ustanovilo, »prazna«, namijenjena zavaravanju nepozvanih čitatelja. Ni oslanjanje na analogne sintaktičke situacije nije dalo ploda. Tek su pokušaji pogađanja ključne riječi doveli do rješenja: u sklopu vijesti o dobrom prijemu kod francuskog kralja Antun <b>tajno</b> priopćuje Mihovilu kako bi uskoro mogao javiti »velike stvari« svojim vlastima u Transilvaniji. Po jednom Antunovu pismu iz vremena nakon francuske misije jasno je da se njegov diplomatski posao ticao austrijskog kralja Ferdinanda. Sudeći po povijesnom kontekstu vjerojatno se radilo o još jednom prijedlogu austrijsko-erdeljskog sporazuma, koji je naišao na blagonaklon prijem francuskoga kralja Franje I. Not {{merely to}} be up to date with humanist fashion, but also out of the genuine necessities of life, the Šibenik {{brothers}} Antun and Mihovil Vrančić corresponded throughout the whole of their lives. Sometimes, they would write confidential information in code. Mihovil’s secret reports were discussed in the last number of Colloquia Maruliana by Diana Sorić {{and the author of the}} present work, but at that time a short coded missive by Antun still eluded comprehension. In this paper, I report on the deciphering of this fragment, encoded in a letter sent from France in 1546. In the very first words of this letter, Antun boasts of having been well received by the king and of everything going his way. The continuation of the sentence is written in secret signs. Since these are different from Mihovil’s, they needed decoding. The first attempt, based on a comparison of frequency of signs and the frequency of signs in the Latin text, was not useful, for Antun’s message is too short (just a line and a half) for such an approach. It seemed then to be useful to start out from the first signs, assuming that they must have contained the beginning of some word. It became clear that in these first signs, the fifth and the seventh were the same, and so the remainder of Antun’s family letters were searched for a similar combination. A check of some eighty letters revealed that not a single possible choice corresponded with the rest of the message. Accordingly I tried using Antun’s syntactical habits in consecutive clauses (for the message consists of such a passage). I set out from the assumption that in the code there might be some active future participle, which would be useful for recognition purposes if it were in the singular, for in the -uru-section of the participle the u is repeated after the second sign. But this attempt came to nothing too. All that remained was to play on chance: to attempt to guess some word that could be expected from the context. And indeed, there was such a word, Transsilvania, which was apt in that it had the double ss, capable of being associated with the repeated sign dd in the coded text. A word this long filled in at once more than a quarter of the unknown text, and its component parts another half, and so the rest did not offer many difficulties. Only the beginning remained a problem. The first two symbols cannot be meaningfully fitted in, and so they can be interpreted as red herrings, as used by code makers to confuse code breakers. The other signs clearly hide some passive form of the verb mittere, the meaning of which fits in well with the continuation of the text, but to obtain the appropriate form, it has to be assumed that there is one more »empty« sign and one mistake by Antun. In any event, it turns out that Antun was writing to Mihovil that he might soon be able to report »great things« to his second homeland, Transylvania, in the diplomacy of which he was serving. But even after the decoding of the text, the task of Antun at the French court remains a riddle. Looking in the circumstances of the time and among other Vrančić letters for more definite elements for an answer, I concluded that it must have been to do with Transylvanian-Austrian relations. After the death of Louis II at the Battle of Mohács, a dispute about the succession in Transylvania broke out, one that was to last a century and a half. A year or two before Antun’s arrival in France, Charles V of Habsburg signed a treaty with the King François I of France, Transylvanian ally, and then with Suleiman, thus freeing his forces and those of his brother Ferdinand for other designs. Juraj Utišenić (Georgius Utissenius), the leading man of Transylvanian politics, must have recognised the danger that had thus arisen. From one of Antun’s letters from the time after the French mission it is clear that his embassy to France concerned Austrian King Ferdinand. Judging from the historical context, this was probably one of a number of proposals for an Austrian-Transylvanian compact. Antun’s satisfaction expressed in the coded text elicits the conclusion that the proposal had met with a good reception from François I...|$|E
