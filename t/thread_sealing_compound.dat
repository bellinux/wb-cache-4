50|$|Pipe dope is any thread lubricant, <b>thread</b> <b>sealing</b> <b>compound,</b> and {{anaerobic}} chemical sealants {{that are}} used to make a pipe thread joint leak proof and pressure tight. Although common pipe threads are tapered and therefore will achieve an interference fit during proper assembly, machining and finishing variances usually result in a fit that does not result in 100 percent contact between the mating components. The application of pipe dope prior to assembly will fill the minute voids between the threads, thus making the joint pressure tight. Pipe dope also acts as a lubricant and helps prevent seizing of the mating parts, which can later cause difficulty during disassembly.|$|E
50|$|Steel pipe is {{sometimes}} joined using threaded connections, where tapered threads (see National Pipe Thread) are {{cut into the}} end of the tubing segment, sealant is applied in the form of <b>thread</b> <b>sealing</b> <b>compound</b> or thread seal tape (also known as PTFE or Teflon tape), and it is then threaded into a corresponding threaded fitting using two pipe wrenches. Beyond domestic or light commercial settings, steel pipe is often joined by welding, or by use of mechanical couplings made by companies such as Victaulic or Anvil International (formerly Grinnell) that hold the pipe joint together via a groove pressed or cut (a rarely used older practice), into the ends of the pipes.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Thread</b> <b>seal</b> tape (also {{known as}} PTFE tape or plumber's tape) is a {{polytetrafluoroethylene}} (PTFE) film {{for use in}} <b>sealing</b> pipe <b>threads.</b> The tape is sold cut to specific widths and wound on a spool, {{making it easy to}} wind around pipe threads. It is also known by the genericised trade-name Teflon tape; while Teflon is in fact identical to PTFE, Chemours (the trade-mark holders) consider this usage incorrect, especially as they no longer manufacture Teflon in tape form. <b>Thread</b> <b>seal</b> tape lubricates allowing for a deeper seating of the threads, and it helps prevent the threads from seizing when being unscrewed. The tape also works as a deformable filler and thread lubricant, helping to seal the joint without hardening or making it more difficult to tighten, and instead making it easier to tighten.|$|R

5000|$|The taper on NPT threads {{allows them}} to form a seal when torqued as the flanks of the threads {{compress}} against each other, as opposed to parallel/straight thread fittings or compression fittings in which the threads merely hold the pieces together and do not provide the seal. The various types of pipe threads are designed for use both with or without thread sealants, as particular applications demand. The sealants, where used, are typically <b>thread</b> <b>seal</b> tape or pipe dope (sometimes plumber's putty). As the thread body is tapered (...) , a larger diameter keeps compressing into a smaller diameter and finally forms a seal (no clearance remains between the crests and roots of the threads because of the taper). This means that NPT fittings should be burr-free and lubricated using a lubricant like lubricating paste or <b>thread</b> <b>seal</b> tape. The use of tape also helps to limit corrosion on the threads, which otherwise can make future disassembly nearly impossible.|$|R
