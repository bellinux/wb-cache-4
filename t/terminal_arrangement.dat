40|$|This {{represents}} an improvement {{of a factor}} of 2 compared to conventional modules at this power level. Because of a novel <b>terminal</b> <b>arrangement</b> inside the module, the internal terminal and bond wire arrangement contributes only 0. 2 nH to the total module inductance.

We {{find that the}} two-terminal spin injection with CFS has the robust dependence of the nonlocal spin signals on the applied bias currents, markedly superior to the four-terminal spin injection with permalloy reported previously. In our LSVs, since the spin transfer torque from one CFS injector to another CFS one is large, the nonlocal magnetoresistance with respect to applied magnetic fields shows large asymmetry in high bias-current conditions.

30|$|Concurrently {{with the}} {{development}} of Liner Shipping Conferences, Vessel Sharing Agreements (VSAs) allowed ocean carriers to mutually cooperate through space sharing on larger vessels and provide schedule stability while reducing operational costs. Transport that would otherwise require each carrier to support a large fleet for all their sea-lanes on an individual basis could be rationalized to allow smaller lines in particular the ability to serve more destinations. This evolved into slot chartering agreements between two or more operators to ensure better economies of scale than container liner service performed individually (Cullinane and Khanna, 1999). VSAs typically were executed based on geographic coverage, port rotation, sailing frequency, the vessels in service, and participant’s share in vessel spaces. A distinction between VSAs and liner conferences is that in a VSA each operator carries out its own marketing identity; its own bills of lading, carriage and handling including port terminals and land transport (Karmelic, 2010). VSAs enabled rates to be established to stabilize the trade and cover some operating costs such as ocean <b>terminal</b> <b>arrangements</b> (McLean and Biles, 2008).|$|R

However, little attention is driven by specialized domestic sources to the planning concepts of transport interchange hubs having bus terminals within their structure; the regulatory documentation is missing. One of feasible ways to resolve the issue is to study the international practice of design and construction of transport interchange hubs having bus terminals as the key points providing trans-regional bus transportation. In this article, the transport interchange hub of Matsumoto, Japan, serves as the sample. The author considers its composition and functional site division.

40|$|The {{regulation}} of excitation-secretion coupling by Ca 2 + channels {{is a fundamental}} property of the nerve terminal. Peptide toxins that block specific Ca 2 + channel types {{have been used to}} identify which channels participate in neurotransmitter release. Subsecond measurements of [3 H]-glutamate and [3 H]dopamine release from rat striatal synaptosomes showed that P-type channels, which are sensitive to the Agelenopsis aperta venom peptide omega-Aga-IVA, trigger the release of both transmitters. Dopamine (but not glutamate) release was also controlled by N-type, omega-conotoxin-sensitive channels. With strong depolarizations, where neither toxin was very effective alone, a combination of omega-Aga-IVA and omega-conotoxin produced a synergistic inhibition of 60 - 80 % of Ca(2 +) -dependent dopamine release. The results suggest that multiple Ca 2 + channel types coexist to regulate neurosecretion under normal physiological conditions in the majority of nerve terminals.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} underlying cleavage of herpesvirus genomes from replicative concatemers are unknown. Evidence from {{herpes simplex}} virus type 1 suggests that cleavage occurs by a nonduplicative process; however, additional evidence suggests that terminal repeats may also be duplicated during the cleavage process. This issue {{has been difficult to}} resolve due to the variable numbers of reiterated terminal repeats that the {{herpes simplex virus}} type 1 genome can contain. Guinea pig cytomegalovirus is a herpesvirus with a simple <b>terminal</b> repeat <b>arrangement</b> that defines two genome types. Type II genomes have a single copy of a 1 -kb terminal repeat at both their left and right termini, whereas type I genomes have only one copy at their left termini and lack the repeat at their right termini. In a previous study, we constructed a recombinant guinea pig cytomegalovirus in which certain cis elements were disrupted such that only type II genomes were produced. Here we show that double repeats that are formed by circularization of infecting genomes are rapidly converted to single repeats, such that the junctions between genomes within replicative concatemers formed late in infection almost exclusively contain single copies of the terminal repeat. Therefore, for the recombinant virus, each cleavage event begins with a single repeat within a concatemer yet produces two repeats, one at each of the resulting termini, demonstrating that terminal repeat duplication occurs in conjunction with cleavage. For wild-type guinea pig cytomegalovirus, the formation of type I genomes further suggests that cleavage can also occur by a nonduplicative process and that duplicative and nonduplicative cleavage can occur concurrently. Other herpesviruses having terminal repeats, such as the herpes simplex viruses and human cytomegalovirus, may also utilize repeat duplication and deletion; however, the biological importance of these events remains unknown...|$|R

40|$|An SGA {{approach}} to discover cdc 13 - 1 ts supressors. Telomeres, the DNA-protein complexes {{at the end}} of eukaryotic chromosomes, are essential for chromosomal stability. In yeast, the telomeric single-strand binding protein Cdc 13 p has multiple important roles related to telomere maintenance: (1) telomeric"capping" [...] protection of telomeres by forming complexes with yKu 70 / 80 and with Stn 1 p/Ten 1 p; (2) positive regulation of telomere replication via interaction with Est 1 p, which is a part of telomerase; (3) negative regulation of telomerase by the recruitment of telomere elongation suppressors Stn 1 p and Ten 1 p. In an attempt to identify genes that are involved in the deleterious outcome of an absence of Cdc 13 p, we screened the yeast gene knock-out library for genes that could suppress the growth defect of cdc 13 - 1 cells at 33 ê C. For this purpose, we performed an SGA array experiment. We scored for the ability of double mutant haploids to grow at 33 ê C. Eventually, we hoped to find the elusive genes involved in telomere 5 '-end processing (exonucleases). Based on the comparative analysis of growth properties of the strains (23 ê C vs 33 ê C), the initial screen identified up to 111 genes that displayed an apparent growth at 33 ê C. In order to verify these results, diploids were regenerated, sporulated, microdissected, and haploid double mutants cdc 13 - 1 yfg[deletion] were isolated from 38 potential cdc 13 - 1 suppressors. Unfortunately, this verification failed to reproduce a suppression of the growth defect by any of the selected genes at any temperature. While disappointing, the results reemphasize that careful re-examination of large scale SGA approaches are indispensable before going on to more involved experimentation. Similarities and differences between adaptation to DNA double-strand break and to telomere uncapping in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It was previously shown that a certain proportion of telomerase negative survivor cells (both type I and type II cells) is able to survive {{in the absence of the}} telomere capping protein Cdc 13 p. These strains (named [deletion] 13 s) were characterized in great detail and one of their discovered features was a striking ability to continuously inactivate DNA-damage checkpoints. Based on structural similarities between DNA double strand breaks (DSB) and unprotected telomeres, we attempted to verify if the molecular mechanisms regulating adaptation to a single irreparable DSB also regulate adaptation to a loss of Cdc 13 p. For this purpose we created three tlc 1 [deletion] cdc 13 [deletion] strains also harboring DSB adaptation related mutations tid 1 [deletion], ptc 2 [deletion] and rfa 1 -t 11. After deprotection of their telomeres, mutant survivor cells showed similar cell cycle progression patterns as compared to the cells where a single irreparable DSB was introduced. Adaptation defective mutants tid 1 [deletion] and ptc 2 [deletion] demonstrated an inability to adapt to telomere uncapping and to resume cell cycle. Interestingly, cells harboring the rfa 1 -t 11 allele, which was reported to suppress adaptation defects of other mutations, did not show any distinguishable phenotype in terms of initial adaptation to telomere deprotection; i. e. rfa 1 -t 11 mutant survivors do escape the G 2 /M arrest and re-enter the cell cycle. However, all three mutant survivor strains failed to produce viable [deletion] 13 capping independent cells, which is consistent with the hypothesis that adaptation to loss of Cdc 13 p depends on the same pathway as the previously reported adaptation phenomenon. Finally, we report the surprising finding that if cells had once experienced an adapted [deletion] 13 state, they will re-produce capping negative survivors much more readily. Thus, while a culture of type II survivor cells generates [deletion] 13 s at a rate of about 1 × 10 - 5 events per division, cells that had been [deletion] 13 s and re-transformed with a Cdc 13 p carrying plasmid will produce capping independent cells at about 1 × 10 - 2 events per division. We are currently examining why these cells re-generate [deletion] 13 cell lines more readily and suspect structural differences in telomere <b>terminal</b> sequence <b>arrangements...</b>|$|R
