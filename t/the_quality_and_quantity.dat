5|$|After Leonid Brezhnev assumed {{power in}} 1964, much of Khrushchev's reforms were reversed. The Brezhnev era began {{a new state}} of stagnation, and saw a decline in both <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>and</b> <b>quantity</b> of {{products}} in the Soviet Union. Armenia was severely affected by these policies, as was to be demonstrated several years later in the catastrophic earthquake that hit Spitak. Material allocated to the building of new homes, such as cement and concrete, was diverted for other uses. Bribery {{and a lack of}} oversight saw the construction of shoddily built and weakly supported apartment buildings. When the earthquake hit on the morning of December 7, 1988, the houses and apartments least able to resist collapse were those built during the Brezhnev years. Ironically, the older the dwellings, the better they withstood the quake.|$|E

5|$|A {{series of}} {{biennial}} {{reports from the}} U.S. National Research Council have reviewed the progress of CERP. The fourth report in the series, released in 2012, found that little {{progress has been made}} in restoring the core of the remaining Everglades ecosystem; instead, most project construction so far has occurred along its periphery. The report noted that to reverse ongoing ecosystem declines, it will be necessary to expedite restoration projects that target the central Everglades, and to improve both <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>and</b> <b>quantity</b> of the water in the ecosystem. To better understand the potential implications of the current slow pace of progress, the report assessed the current status of ten Everglades ecosystem attributes, including phosphorus loads, peat depth, and populations of snail kites, birds of prey that are endangered in South Florida. Most attributes received grades ranging from C (degraded) to D (significantly degraded), but the snail kite received a grade of F (near irreversible damage). The report also assessed the future trajectory of each ecosystem attribute under three restoration scenarios: improved water quality, improved hydrology, and improvements to both water quality and hydrology, which helped highlight the urgency of restoration actions to benefit a wide range of ecosystem attributes and demonstrate the cost of inaction. Overall, the report concluded that substantial near-term progress to address both water quality and hydrology in the central Everglades is needed to reverse ongoing degradation before it is too late.|$|E

Britain had already indicated that it would do so, and the Soviet Union agreed on 30 August. This did not mean an immediate end to testing; on the contrary, all three all rushed to perform as much testing as possible before the deadline.

Moreover, as the prospect of increased American cooperation grew after October 1957, they knew that <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>and</b> <b>quantity</b> of what the Americans would share would depend on what they had to offer.

25|$|Clearing {{is carried}} out by the grazing {{industry}} in an attempt to increase <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>and</b> <b>quantity</b> of feed available for stock and to improve the management of livestock. The removal of trees from savanna land removes the competition for water from the grasses present, and can lead to a two to fourfold increase in pasture production, as well as improving the quality of the feed available. Since stock carrying capacity is strongly correlated with herbage yield, there can be major financial benefits from the removal of trees, such as assisting with grazing management: regions of dense tree and shrub cover harbors predators, leading to increased stock losses, for example, while woody plant cover hinders mustering in both sheep and cattle areas.|$|E

Results: We experimented with the Yeast dataset and compared our resulting PNCGCs with the association rules generated by the Apriori mining algorithm. Our results show that our PNCGCs identify some missing co-regulations of association rules, and our algorithm greatly reduces the large number of rules involving uncorrelated genes generated by the Apriori scheme...|$|R
