When an insect stuck in a web owned by P. labiata, P. schultzi or any regional variant of P. fimbriata, and next to a web spider's web, the web spider sometimes enters the Portia′s web, and the Portia pursues and catches the web spider.|$|E

50|$|When {{animals or}} people free-run, {{experiments}} {{can be done}} to see what sort of signals, known as zeitgebers, are effective in entrainment. Also, much work has been done to see how long or short <b>a</b> circadian cycle <b>to</b> which different organisms can be entrained. For example, some animals can be entrained <b>to</b> <b>a</b> 22-hour <b>day,</b> but they can not be entrained <b>to</b> <b>a</b> 20-hour <b>day.</b> In recent studies funded by the U.S. space industry, {{it has been shown that}} most humans can be entrained <b>to</b> <b>a</b> 23.5-hour <b>day</b> and <b>to</b> <b>a</b> 24.65-hour <b>day.</b>|$|R
5|$|As {{with any}} non-repeating calendar, the Maya {{measured}} time from a fixed start point. The Maya set {{the beginning of}} their calendar as the end of a previous cycle of bak'tuns, equivalent <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> in 3114 BC. This was believed by the Maya to be the day of the creation of the world in its current form. The Maya used the Long Count Calendar to fix any given day of the Calendar Round within their current great Piktun cycle consisting of either 20 bak'tuns. There was some variation in the calendar, specifically texts in Palenque demonstrate that the piktun cycle that ended in 3114 BC had only 13 bak'tuns, and other inscriptions seem to have used an exceptional cycle of 13 + 20 bak'tun in the current piktun. Additionally, there may have been some regional variation in how these exceptional cycles were managed.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary {{preparations}} of acquacotta may use stale, fresh, or toasted bread, and {{can include}} additional ingredients such as vegetable broth, eggs, cheeses such as Parmigiano-Reggiano and Pecorino Toscano, celery, garlic, basil, beans such as cannellini beans, cabbage, kale, lemon juice, salt, pepper, potatoes and others. Some versions may use edible mushrooms such as porcini, wild herbs, and leaf vegetables/greens such as arugula, endive, mint, chard, chicory, dandelion greens, watercress, valerian and others. As the greens boil down, {{they contribute to}} the broth's flavor. The dish may be topped with a poached egg. Contemporary versions may be prepared in advance from a few hours <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> stored in a cold place or refrigerated, and then reheated prior to serving. It can also be preserved by freezing.|$|E
5|$|Solitary in nature, the Atlantic torpedo {{is often}} seen resting on or half-buried in the {{substrate}} during the day, becoming more active at night. Large and well-defended from attack, it seldom falls prey to other animals. Known parasites of the Atlantic torpedo include the tapeworms Calyptrobothrium occidentale and C. minus, Grillotia microthrix, Monorygma sp., and Phyllobothrium gracile, the monogeneans Amphibdella flabolineata and Amphibdelloides maccallumi, and the copepod Eudactylina rachelae.

When she was 13 she attended Kensington High School and later won a bursary to Royal Holloway College in 1891 to study literature.

5|$|Until {{the late}} 1950s, {{when the federal}} {{government}} shifted <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> school integration model, residential schools were severely underfunded and often relied on the forced labour of their students to maintain their facilities, although it was presented as training for artisan skills. The work was arduous, and severely compromised the academic and social development of the students. School books and textbooks were drawn mainly from the curricula of the provincially funded public schools for non-Indigenous students, and teachers at the residential schools were often poorly trained or prepared. During this same period, Canadian government scientists performed nutritional tests on students and knowingly kept some students undernourished to serve as the control sample.|$|E
5|$|William Stanley {{was born}} on Monday 2 February 1829 in Islington, London, one of nine {{children}} of John Stanley (a mechanic and builder) and his wife, Selina Hickman, and a direct descendant of Thomas Stanley, the 17th-century author of History of Philosophy. He was baptised on Wednesday 4 March 1829 at St Mary’s Church, Islington. At the age of 10 Stanley started going regularly <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> school run by a Mr Peil until he was 12. From the age of 12 until he was 14, his maternal uncle William Ford Hickman paid for his education at a different school. Despite having limited formal learning, Stanley taught himself mathematics, mechanics, astronomy, music, French, geology, chemistry, architecture and theology. He attended lessons in technical drawing at the London Mechanics’ Institution (now called Birkbeck College), where he enrolled in 1843, attending engineering and phrenology lessons.|$|E

5|$|Female California {{sea lions}} have a 12-month {{reproductive}} cycle, {{consisting of a}} 9-month actual gestation and a 3-month delayed implantation of the fertilized egg before giving birth in June or July. Interbirth intervals are particularly long for this species, being 21 days for sea lions off California and more than 30 days for sea lions in the Gulf of California. Females remain with their pups on shore for 10 days and nurse them. After this, females will go on foraging trips lasting as long as three days, returning to nurse their pups for up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> Pups left on shore tend to gather in nurseries to socialize and play. When returning from a trip, females call their pups with distinctive calls to which the pups will reply in kind. A mother and pup can distinguish each other's calls from those of other mothers and pups. At first, reunions largely depend on {{the efforts of the}} mothers. However, as pups get older, they get more involved in reunions. Older pups may sometimes join their mothers during their foraging trips. Adult male California sea lions play no role in raising pups, but they do take more interest in them than adult males of other otariid species; they have even been observed to help shield swimming pups from predators. Pups are weaned by a year but can continue to suckle for another year.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to raising {{the wages of}} his workers, Ford also introduced a new, reduced workweek in 1926. The decision was made in 1922, when Ford and Crowther described it as six 8-hour days, giving a 48-hour week, but in 1926 it was announced as five 8-hour days, giving a 40-hour week. (Apparently the program started with Saturday being a workday and sometime later it was changed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> off.) On May 1, 1926, the Ford Motor Company's factory workers switched to a five-day 40-hour workweek, with the company's office workers making the transition the following August.|$|E
25|$|A female jewel spider can {{mate with}} {{multiple}} males during a single reproductive cycle. If given the chance, the female will still readily mate with other males shortly after a successful mating. To prevent sperm competition, the successful male will defend the female shortly {{before and after}} mating. It actively drives away other rival males until the female enters a refractory period and ceases to be receptive to further matings. This usually happens an hour <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> after a successful mating, during which the female will herself aggressively attack and drive away all courting males.|$|E
