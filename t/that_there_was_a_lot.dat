However, narrative evidence suggests <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of spare time on the job, although tales of staff drinking beer in pubs while their trains waited (which would entail instant dismissal on the main line) are probably urban legends.

The storyline also explains why Mercedes is the way she is now". Mercedes and Johnny kissed, which Metcalfe said was them just [...] "getting lost in the moment" [...] and was partly due to Mercedes having doubts about Riley's fidelity. She added that Mercedes and Johnny spend time [...] "just talking and reliving the old times, especially how he won her over in the past".|$|E

In an interview with FHM in December 2001, vocalist Corey Taylor revealed that he put himself in specific situations to achieve his performance on the album.

[...] Once cast, Raize found it difficult to maintain Taymor's [...] "sense of duality" [...] because Simba is [...] "both man and beast." [...] He said, [...] "The tendency is to sacrifice one for the other, but you can't."

500|$|... "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] {{features}} {{the deaths of}} Patricia and Jimmy, who were both consumed by walkers. Alongside {{the deaths of the}} aforementioned characters, the episode's script initially called for the deaths of Hershel, as well as Shane Walsh and Randall, both of whom had died in the previous installment. Since Kirkman felt <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of potential development in Hershel, his death was scrapped from the script. Although plans to write off the character commenced earlier in the season, Mazzara opined that his hypothetical death would have carried no emotional resonance. [...] "The plan was always to whack Hershel, and I actually told Scott Wilson, 'Thanks for everything you've done, but in the next script we're going to kill off your character.' We started writing that and it felt like Hershel's death was playing as a plot device and we were getting no emotional resonance. It was just playing as a gratuitous death. This was one of those examples where we won't play a shocking death for the sense of death; we have to get something out of it. We got nothing out of it. If you look at the shot of Hershel looking back and seeing that barn burning and his farm completely lost to the zombies, that shot was well worth it because we see the farm was really a character and you can only see that through Hershel's eyes. So it was the right call to keep him alive." ...|$|E
500|$|Initial {{ideas were}} contributed by Sakaguchi, {{including}} {{the entire story}} {{and the name of}} Baron's royal air force, the [...] "Red Wings". The Active Time Battle (ATB) system was conceived and designed by Hiroyuki Ito when he was inspired while watching a Formula One race and seeing racers pass each other at different speeds. This gave him the idea of different speed values for the individual characters. The system was developed by Kazuhiko Aoki, Ito and Akihiko Matsui. As the game's lead designer, Tokita wrote the scenario and contributed pixel art. He stated <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of pressure and that the project would not have been completed if he did not work diligently on it. According to Tokita, Final Fantasy IV was designed with the best parts of the previous three installments in mind: the job system of Final Fantasy III, the focus on story of Final Fantasy II, and the four elemental bosses acting as [...] "symbols for the game" [...] as in the first installment. Other influences include Dragon Quest II. The themes of Final Fantasy IV were to go [...] "from darkness to light" [...] with Cecil, a focus on family and friendship among the large and diverse cast, and the idea that [...] "brute strength alone isn't power." [...] Tokita feels that Final Fantasy IV is the first game in the series to really pick up on drama, and the first Japanese RPG to feature [...] "such deep characters and plot." ...|$|E

Rubenstein criticised the fact that the game did not include Sonic CD or Sonic Spinball, stating that [...] "Sega could have made a far more complete Sonic collection" [...] by including more derivative titles that were released. He summarised that Sonic Jam was not a definitive Sonic experience, asserting that it had only been six years since the original Sonic the Hedgehog was released and [...] "perhaps most of us aren't quite nostalgic about it yet". Game Revolution's reviewer echoed that the compilation was merely a [...] "solid set of games that we've seen before", saying that the game was not recommended if the consumer was [...] "tired of rehashes", but [...] "well worth thirty or forty bucks." [...] Although Williamson noted <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of exploring for the player to do in Sonic Jam, he expressed scepticism {{that the majority of the}} game was from [...] "yesterday" [...] and there were not enough new innovations.

By contrast, Ed Lomas of Computer and Video Games considered it [...] "amazing how well the games have aged".

Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said that the episode was [...] "structurally and tonally", but disliked the way the show featured Jon Hamm, as he believed the show was not giving him enough to do besides being [...] "handsome." [...] Nonetheless, Sepinwall enjoyed the story between Liz and Drew in [...] "St. Valentine's Day" [...] writing that it was a [...] "better effort" [...] than shown in the previous episode, [...] "Generalissimo".

Entertainment Weekly contributor Annie Barrett wrote that she liked the way the episode handled the Valentine's Day theme, however, was not complimentary towards the way Tina Fey and Hamm were featured in [...] "St. Valentine's Day" [...] with her observing, [...] "the future for TV's most promisingly delicious couple... might not be so sweet." [...] Before the airing of the episode, Barrett very much liked the pairing of the two characters. Kevin D.
