5|$|The {{company began}} as a {{development}} team that created software called Picture <b>This</b> <b>Home</b> in the mid-1990s for Autodesk in San Rafael, California. The program allowed people to virtually preview room decoration projects before any work began. Users could create virtual rooms, change walls and arrange furniture, and create photo-realistic renderings of completed designs. Picture <b>This</b> <b>Home</b> was awarded the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval. In 1998, the software and its team of 40developers were sold to Broderbund, which was owned by The Learning Company, a subsidiary of Mattel Inc. Broderbund eventually spun Picture <b>This</b> <b>Home</b> off as a company called GoodHome.com in June 1999. The company received $30 million in venture capital from Hearst Interactive Media.|$|E

5|$|This unorthodox {{deployment}} {{gave the}} Smith Gun 360 degrees of rotation which, {{combined with a}} maximum 40-degree elevation, produced a basic firing-plate-mounted field weapon light enough to be towed behind a civilian vehicle, despite not being designed for <b>this.</b> (<b>Home</b> Guard units quickly discovered this fact, having to be prohibited from doing so as it would damage the weapon's wheels (and possibly the axle), inhibiting or even preventing traverse.) Happily, ammunition shortages made the similarly-constructed limber redundant and so a source of spare parts.|$|E

In his first at-bat of the season's second game at the Giants' AT Park, Bonds hit a Chris Young (of the San Diego Padres) pitch just over the wall {{to the left of}} straightaway center field for career home run 735. <b>This</b> <b>home</b> run put Bonds past the midway point between Ruth and Aaron.|$|E
