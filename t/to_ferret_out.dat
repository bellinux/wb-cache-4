5|$|British {{secret service}} agent James Bond appears at the door asking for a room, having had a flat tyre while passing. Bond quickly realises that Horror and Sluggsy are mobsters and that Viv is in danger. Pressuring the two men, he {{eventually}} gets the gangsters to agree to provide him a room. Bond tells Michel {{that he is in}} America in the wake of Operation Thunderball and was detailed to protect a Russian nuclear expert who defected to the West and who now lives in Toronto, as part of his quest <b>to</b> <b>ferret</b> <b>out</b> SPECTRE. That night Sluggsy and Horror set fire to the motel and attempt to kill Bond and Michel. A gun battle ensues and, during their escape, Horror and Sluggsy's car crashes into a lake. Bond and Michel retire to bed, but Sluggsy is still alive and makes a further attempt to kill them, before Bond shoots him.|$|E
5|$|While Allen's {{service as}} a judge in Vermont was brief, he {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>ferret</b> <b>out</b> Tories and report them to local Boards of Confiscation for action. He was so zealous in these efforts that they also included naming his own brother Levi, who was apparently trying to swindle Allen and Ira out of land at the time. This action was somewhat surprising, as Levi had not only attempted to purchase Allen's release {{while he was in}} Halifax, but he had also traveled to New York while Allen was on parole there, and furnished him with goods and money. Allen and Levi engaged in a war of words, many of which were printed in the Connecticut Courant, even after Levi crossed British lines. They would eventually reconcile in 1783.|$|E

In 1788 a letter from Martin to McGillivray was intercepted in which Martin professed to be interested in settling abroad. When the letter was discovered, the North Carolina General Assembly launched an investigation into Martin's conduct.

25|$|Desperate {{to avoid}} formal {{sanctions}} {{and to get}} off the FATF blacklist, the BSP spearheaded another lobby, this time to legislate a law that would criminalize money-laundering and create an anti-money-laundering body, as required by the FATF. The process, however, proved to be more complicated than anticipated. Buenaventura was repeatedly attacked by irate congressmen, who accused the BSP of attempting to amass power that would allow it to poke into the private accounts of individuals it considered suspicious. Legislators did not want the BSP peeking into private accounts, fearing that such power would be used as a political tool <b>to</b> <b>ferret</b> <b>out</b> ill-gotten wealth that was being laundered through banks.|$|E

25|$|For {{successful}} operations, surprise must {{be achieved}} by the guerrillas. If the operation has been betrayed or compromised it is usually called off immediately. Intelligence is also extremely important, and detailed knowledge of the target's dispositions, weaponry and morale is gathered before any attack. Intelligence can be harvested in several ways. Collaborators and sympathizers will usually provide {{a steady flow of}} useful information. If working clandestinely, the guerrilla operative may disguise his membership in the insurgent operation, and use deception <b>to</b> <b>ferret</b> <b>out</b> needed data. Employment or enrollment as a student may be undertaken near the target zone, community organizations may be infiltrated, and even romantic relationships struck up as part of intelligence gathering.|$|E

With the ring on, Gawain finally goes off on the journey to rid the world of Morgana, who has hidden in a forbidding fortress on the island of Lyonesse. On the way there, Morgana shows up to kill Gawain's companion, her former servant named Helie. Once in Morgana's castle, Gawain gets captured and is sentenced to death, but manages to escape after defeating a giant snake. He then works to overcome Morgana and slay her vampire bodyguard Ragnar. Ultimately, Gawain is unable to end Morgana's life, but the witch's own Faerie minions help him imprison her inside Lyonesse. She swears vengeance while he returns to Camelot as a hero to join the Order of the Round Table.|$|E
25|$|Although authors give many {{examples}} of male witchery {{in the second part}} of the handbook, those witchcraft trials that are independently confirmed and that were led by Kramer himself are related to persecution of women almost exclusively. They took place in Ravensburg near Constance (1484) and Innsbruck (since 1485). According to Brauner, trial records confirm that Kramer believed that women are by nature corrupt and evil. His position was in harmony with the scholastic theory at the time. In contrast, Sprenger never conducted a witch trial though he was consulted in a few cases. Kramer and Sprenger use a metaphor of a world turned upside down by women of which concubines are the most wicked, followed by midwives and then by wives who dominate their husbands. Authors warn of imminent arrival of the apocalypse foretold in the Bible and that men risk bewitchment that leads to impotence and sensation of castration. Brauner explains authors' prescription on how a woman can avoid becoming a witch: According to the Malleus, the only way a woman can avoid succumbing to her passions – and becoming a witch – is to embrace a life of devout chastity in a religious retreat. But the monastic life is reserved to the spiritually gifted few. Therefore, most women are doomed to become witches, who cannot be redeemed; and the only recourse open to the authorities is <b>to</b> <b>ferret</b> <b>out</b> and exterminate all witches.|$|E

40|$|For many years, {{the debate}} over {{corporate}} ownership and control {{has been in a}} rut. At least since Berle and Mean's (1932) influential work, the debate has centered around the percentage of corporations that are owned and controlled by families vs. the percentage that are controlled by independent managers. Some researchers have devoted their careers <b>to</b> <b>ferretting</b> <b>out</b> new, hidden in-formation which the most recent study has missed. Great significance has been given to a study which might find, for example, that 25 percent of the corpora-tions are family-owned, rather than 38 percent. Jack Niemonen's critique of our article, of course, is in that tradition. During this long debate, however, few social scientists have recognized that the subject matter has been changing. The simple categories of "family con-trol " and "managerial control " are no longer adequate. Since 1932, we find the emergence of powerful institutional investors. As we noted in our work, over 40 percent of all corporate stock in the United States today is controlled by. institutional investors. In some capitalist nations, this trend has gone even further.
