Any number of devices might be useful: progressive taxes of various kinds, trade-related levies, auctions, rebates, sectoral agreements, multilateral funds, international property-rights concessions, and so on. Beyond these, new and as-yet unnamed channels for both international resource transfer and accounting will need to be conceived and implemented, inevitably posing an impressive set of challenges: How to scale up rapidly? How to build absorptive and distributional capacity? How to ensure efficiency and avoid waste? How to institute credible and democratic governance? ...|$|E

5000|$|In 1981, the San Diego based {{fundamentalist}} {{group the}} Creation Science Research Center claimed, {{in a trial}} dubbed the [...] "Monkey Trial Replay," [...] that teaching evolution as the sole theory of development violated the rights of children who believed in biblical creation. In his opening statement for the group lawyer Richard Turner argued:It is not a showdown at high noon between creation and evolution. It is not religion versus science. We {{are not trying to}} sneak the Bible into the classroom, or any other religious doctrine. <b>The</b> <b>real</b> <b>issue</b> <b>here</b> is that of religious freedom under the United States Constitution.Turner went on to explain that the plaintiffs were seeking protection for the belief that [...] "God created man as man, not as a blob." [...] The Times of 7 March 1981 reported that some were of the opinion that the case was [...] "a signal of things to come, with more and more fundamentalist groups trying to flex their not inconsiderable influence in schools across the country." [...] At the same time Frank D. White, the Governor of Arkansas signed a Bill requiring that creation science and the theory of evolution be given equal weight in schools. Although fifteen states attempted to introduce such Bills around this time, only that in Arkansas made it into law. Following hearings in Little Rock the law was overturned by Judge William Overton early in 1982, just as a similar (and equally unsuccessful) Bills were approved by legislators in Mississippi and Louisiana.|$|E
40|$|After {{sketching}} {{some aspects}} of truthmaker doctrines and "truthmaker projects", and canvassing some prima facie objections to the latter, I turn to an issue which might seem to involve confusion {{about the nature of}} character of truthmakers if such there be, viz for statements of identity and (specially) distinctness. <b>The</b> <b>real</b> <b>issue</b> <b>here</b> is versions of the Identity of Indiscernibles. I discuss ways of discriminating versions, which are almost certainly true but trivial, which almost certainly substantive but false, and explore an interesting intermediate possibility which might if developed yield a plausibly true yet not-entirely-trivial version of the doctrine: it is equivalent to what I call "the Denial of Bare Distinctness"...|$|E
40|$|How {{much does}} {{attendance}} affect a student’s chance of passing a class? Does attendance actually matter? More specifically, {{what is the}} correlation between attendance and passing, if any? This study presents some data on student attendance and pass rates. Through this study, the student’s average attendance (no. of classes) was mapped to each course {{in which they were}} enrolled. This data was then compared to determine if there was a correlation between passing and attending. Results show that there is indeed a positive correlation between passing and attendance. However, the statistics demonstrate that attendance is only one factor in determining student success. While it’s clear that many students that fail are poor attenders, many students that pass are also poor attenders, with some students that pass not attending at all. This would suggest that the assumption that attendance alone is the culprit is a misnomer. This study surmises that <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>issue</b> <b>here</b> is lack of engagement, not poor attendance. If academics can get their students to engage with the material, then actual attendance doesn’t matter. Given this, in conclusion some innovative strategies for student engagement are presented...|$|E

40|$|Sarcopenia is {{the loss}} of muscle mass that happens to {{everyone}} with age. However, the rate of sarcopenia and the severity of its sequelae vary greatly according to health status, physical activity, and possibly diet. In this review, I discuss the potential mechanisms of sarcopenia and some ideas about prevention and treatment. TO give a little perspective on body compositionchanges with aging and illness, first of all, let me remind you that the world can be divided into ‘‘lumpers’’ and ‘‘splitters. ’ ’ On the issue of losing lean body mass (LBM), I am in the splitting camp. We have proposed (1) that loss of LBM has slow, medium, and fast lanes, kind of like freeways, with wasting, cachexia, and sarcopenia as terms {{that can be used to}} indicate the fast, medium, and slow loss of muscle (Table 1). Wasting has been co-opted by the HIV field to indicate the unintentional loss of weight, meaning both lean and fat, and both our data and that of others suggest that <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>issue</b> <b>here</b> is negative protein and energy balance. Muscle is simply lost along the way...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{international}} transactions {{have become}} extremely complicated, requiring {{the participation of}} several parties for the delivery of large-scale projects. However. multiparty commercial projects are invariably executed through several bilateral contracts providing for bilateral dispute resolution arrangements. Some of the contracts might include a jurisdiction clause, certain others might provide for arbitration, while others may not contain any dispute resolution provisions at all. This practice leads to "jurisdictional fragmentation of the multiparty commercial project" where the several parties of a single business plan will fall {{under the jurisdiction of}} different adjudicatory fora. Thus. a dispute arising between two persons bound by an arbitration agreement in connection with the multiparty project will have to be resolved exclusively by arbitration between these two parties. Other persons cannot take part in the resolution of the dispute, even if they play {{an active role in the}} actual business project. and thus have an interest in the outcome of the dispute. These persons will remain third parties, both to the arbitration agreement and the arbitral award. This study focuses on the role and the interests of the wide group of third parties exhibiting an interest in the dispute pending before a tribunal between two genuine parties. The thesis, in particular, examines whether arbitration agreements can affect persons which are not contractually bound by these agreements. In addition, the thesis explores whether arbitral awards can affect persons that have not participated in the arbitration proceedings The thesis challenges the prevailing contractual approach to the issue of arbitration, focusing exclusively on the contractual characteristics of arbitration ag eements. According to this view, the main question is whether a non-signatory can be contractually bound by an arbitration agreement. The study demonstrates that focusing exclusively on the contractual nature of arbitration agreements obscures <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>issue</b> <b>here,</b> which is whether arbitration agreements may have any jurisdictional implications vis-a-vis `third parties'. Accordingly, the thesis takes a jurisdictional approach, and argues that the discussion should be focused on the dispute and on any implications this may have to third parties, rather than on the requirement of consent to arbitration agreements. Regarding the effect of arbitral awards on third parties, the thesis argues for a third-party effect of arbitral awards specially designed for the needs of international arbitration. More specifically, the case is made for the application of an arbitral effect different from that of res judicata, both in terms of quality and intensity, but that is nevertheless conclusive. It is also suggested that the third party effect of an arbitral award should be analogous to the degree of substantive association between the genuine and the false third parties. This is consistent with the basic premise of the whole thesis: the relations between several parties, in terms of jurisdiction and more generally in arbitration procedure, should correspond to the extent of association between those parties, in terms of substantive rights, interests and liability.
