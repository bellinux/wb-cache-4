5|$|Despite the {{perceived}} conservatism, in 1963 Brabham {{was the first}} Formula One team to use a wind tunnel to hone their designs to reduce drag and stop the cars lifting off the ground at speed. The practice only became the norm in the early 1980s, and is possibly <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> the design of modern cars. Towards {{the end of the}} 1960s, teams began to exploit aerodynamic downforce to push the cars' tyres down harder on the track and enable them to maintain faster speeds through high-speed corners. At the 1968 Belgian Grand Prix, Brabham were the first, alongside Ferrari, to introduce full width rear wings to this effect.|$|E
5|$|The attacks {{also caused}} {{extensive}} damage to Japan's urban areas. Approximately 40percent {{of the urban}} area of the 66 cities subjected to area attacks were destroyed. This included the loss of about 2.5million housing units, which rendered 8.5million people homeless. The urban area attacks reduced {{the morale of the}} Japanese population, and postwar surveys conducted by the USSBS found that air attacks were <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> convincing the Japanese that the war had been lost. During the final months of the war the raids also contributed to the deterioration of the Japanese social fabric. However, civilian morale did not collapse due to the bombing, and post-war investigations found that most Japanese had remained willing to continue the war if necessary.|$|E

25|$|In medicine, {{compliance}} (also adherence, capacitance) {{describes the}} degree to which a patient correctly follows medical advice. Most commonly, it refers to medication or drug compliance, but it can also apply to other situations such as medical device use, self care, self-directed exercises, or therapy sessions. Both the patient and the health-care provider affect compliance, and a positive physician-patient relationship is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> improving compliance, although the high cost of prescription medication also plays a major role.|$|E

25|$|An {{essential}} oil extracted from eucalyptus leaves contains compounds that are powerful natural disinfectants {{and can be}} toxic in large quantities. Several marsupial herbivores, notably koalas and some possums, are relatively tolerant of it. The close correlation of these oils with other more potent toxins called formylated phloroglucinol compounds (euglobals, macrocarpals and sideroxylonals) allows koalas and other marsupial species to make food choices based on {{the smell of the}} leaves. For koalas, these compounds are <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> leaf choice.|$|E
25|$|Various theologians have {{assorted}} opinions {{as to why}} {{the apostles}} wrote the Codes in the first place, and then why they were directed to a variety of recipients in several New Testament passages. Some believe that the intent of the Codes is not universal throughout the passages in which they appear. They believe it necessary to determine the specific function of a Code within a specific New Testament passage. Timothy Gombis posits that <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> determining the purpose of the Code is to consider the literary context in which it appears.|$|E
25|$|Amyntas {{had another}} wife, a fellow kinswoman named Gygaea, who had three children. At {{some point during}} her husband’s reign, Eurydice became the {{dominant}} wife.

25|$|Since about 2010, {{researchers}} such as Eppig, Hassel, and MacKenzie {{have found}} a very close and consistent link between IQ scores and infectious diseases, especially in the infant and preschool populations and the mothers of these children. They have postulated that fighting infectious diseases strains the child's metabolism and prevents full brain development. Hassel postulated that it is by far <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> determining population IQ. However, {{they also found that}} subsequent factors such as good nutrition and regular quality schooling can offset early negative effects to some extent.|$|E
25|$|The {{historical}} {{growth of}} Canada's population {{is complex and}} has been influenced in many different ways, such as indigenous populations, expansion of territory, and human migration. Being a new world country, Canada has been predisposed {{to be a very}} open society with regards to immigration, which has been <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> its historical population growth. Canadians comprise about 0.5% of the world's total population, The 2016 Canadian census counted a total population of 35,151,728, an increase of around 5.0 percent over the 2011 figure. Between 1990 and 2008, the population increased by 5.6 million, equivalent to 20.4 percent overall growth.|$|E
25|$|Television in Brazil began officially on 18 September 1950, {{with the}} {{founding}} of TV Tupi by Assis Chateaubriand.

25|$|Marcel Mauss is {{recognized}} as one of the first authors interested in the study of gift economies. His main concern centered on individuals' need to provide gifts and the obligations to reciprocate them. He identified human obligation to give, receive, and reciprocate as <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> the creation and maintenance of social ties. Reciprocation was mainly produced by the insertion of the giver's identity in the object that was given. The object maintained this essence (referred to as hau or mana by Mauss) of the giver which needed to return to him/her through reciprocation in the form of a counter-gift (another object, services, person, agreements, etc.).|$|E
25|$|Quality of nesting habitat {{surrounding}} the lek is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> population success. Adequacy of cover {{is critical for}} nesting. Too little can exist: where 13% was the average total crown cover on Idaho range, nests were located where average cover was 17%. No hens nested in the most arid, open areas with less than 10% total shrub cover. Too much also can occur: average shrub cover at 87 nest sites was 18.4%, and in more dense cover, greater sage-grouse did not nest where total shrub cover was greater than 25%. In Utah, no nests occurred where threetip sagebrush cover exceeded 35%.|$|E
25|$|The {{importance}} of these findings is that they contradicted both the traditional pedagogic advice of limiting or avoiding bodily contact {{in an attempt to}} avoid spoiling children, and the insistence of the predominant behaviorist school of psychology that emotions were negligible. Feeding was thought to be <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> the formation of a mother–child bond. Harlow concluded, however, that nursing strengthened the mother–child bond because of the intimate body contact that it provided. He described his experiments as a study of love. He also believed that contact comfort could be provided by either mother or father. Though widely accepted now, this idea was revolutionary at the time in provoking thoughts and values concerning the studies of love.|$|E

25|$|According to {{economist}} David Foot of the University of Toronto, {{the level}} of a woman's education is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> determining whether she will reproduce: the higher her level of education, the less likely she is to bear children (or if she does, the fewer children she is likely to have). Overall, researchers have observed childless couples to be more educated, and it is perhaps because of this that {{they are more likely to}} be employed in professional and management occupations, more likely for both spouses to earn relatively high incomes, and to live in urban areas. They are also less likely to be religious, subscribe to traditional gender roles, or subscribe to conventional roles.|$|E
25|$|The raw {{material}} {{is an important}} factor, because of the result that {{can be obtained by}} working it and in order to reveal the economy and movement of prehistoric humans. In the Olduvai Gorge the {{raw material}}s were most readily available some ten kilometres from the nearest settlements. However, flint or silicate is readily available on the fluvial terraces of Western Europe. This means that different strategies were required for the procurement and use of available resources. The supply of materials was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> the manufacturing process as Palaeolithic artisans were able to adapt their methods to available materials, obtaining adequate results from even the most difficult raw materials. Despite this it is important to study the rock's grain, texture, the presence of joints, veins, impurities or shatter cones etc.|$|E
25|$|Binge {{drinking}} {{is associated with}} increased impulsivity, impairments in spatial working memory and impaired emotional learning. These adverse effects {{are believed to be}} due to the neurotoxic effects of repeated withdrawal from alcohol on aberrant neuronal plasticity and cortical damage. Repeated periods of acute intoxication followed by acute detoxification has profound effects on the brain and is associated with an increased risk of seizures as well as cognitive deficits. The effects on the brain are similar to those seen in alcoholics who have been detoxified multiple times but not as severe as in alcoholics who have no history of prior detox. Thus the acute withdrawal syndrome appears to be <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> causing damage or impairment to brain function. The brain regions most sensitive to harm from binge drinking are the amygdala and prefrontal cortex.|$|E
