Although the concept was new to Ann Arbor, planners took inspiration from similar innovative programs then springing up in other cities, including the Chicago High School for Metropolitan Studies (est. 1969), Philadelphia's Parkway High School, and Washington, D.C.'s School Without Walls (est. 1971). Reflecting the liberal educational philosophy of the period, other goals in the early CHS proposals were [...] "to {{provide an opportunity for}} a heterogeneous group of students and faculty to learn and work together and to combat prejudices based on race, sex, age, lifestyle, and school achievement," [...] and [...] "to foster the development of identity and responsibility."

Following heated public debate, Boland and his faction were successful in establishing the Provisional Harbour Board in 1899, but it took six years of further lobbying before the Cairns Harbour Board was constituted on 20 December 1905. It had its first meeting on 28 February 1906. The Board consisted of 9 members, two representing the Town of Cairns, and 7 representing outlying regions. Both Boland and Walsh were elected as the members for Cairns, and in 1909 Boland was elected chairman.

Gates in the late 1970s had encountered some success in the Rampart Division. However, in 1998-2000, graphic allegations of extreme police misconduct among Rampart's CRASH squad began to emerge. This misconduct involved several officers and detectives, most notably Rafael Perez. Perez was suspected of being involved in a bank robbery committed by another Rampart Division officer, David Mack; he also stole 6 lbs. of cocaine from an LAPD evidence locker, which eventually led to his arrest. [...] His most egregious act involved the shooting—and framing—of unarmed gang member Javier Ovando. Perez originally claimed that Ovando had opened fire at both Perez and another officer, Nino Durden. The two officers then returned fire, leaving Ovando paralyzed. [...] Perez and Durden then framed Ovando for the attack, and he was found guilty and sentenced to 23 years in prison (Ovando was released when Perez admitted to shooting and framing him). [...] After several other incidents, the LAPD became suspicious of Perez and began to investigate him. Perez later pleaded guilty to the cocaine theft in exchange for information about other corrupt officers within the Rampart Division. In turn, Perez implicated approximately 70 officers of misconduct.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, Ann Arbor had {{developed}} {{a reputation as one}} of the most liberal campus towns in the country. The city played host to numerous radical political organizations, eventually electing three members of the left-wing Human Rights Party to its city council. Meanwhile, the teenage group Youth Liberation of Ann Arbor was carving out a role as a national pioneer in the nascent youth rights movement, with fifteen-year-old member Sonia Yaco's insurgent school-board candidacy earning her 1,300 write-in votes, or eight percent of the total, in spring 1972. Reflecting this non-traditional ethos, the city's school district opened two experimental alternative schools during those years: Earthworks (originally Pioneer II) in fall 1971, and Community High School (CHS) in fall 1972.The Community High idea, according to the 1972 blueprint, was to use the city as classroom [...] - [...] thereby creating a [...] "school without walls" [...] where students could develop their own curricula by drawing on experiences and resource people throughout the community.

Secondly, {{what has happened to}} the centuries-old practice of the traditional yak herding system of <b>the</b> Shimshal <b>community</b> as a result of the introduction of new policies leading to the creation of protected areas? Thirdly, can <b>the</b> <b>community</b> retain <b>resource</b> control of the protected area (state property), and how can we conceptualize it under the property regime? The research draws the following three conclusions: (1) a clear divide exists between the local government and <b>the</b> <b>community</b> on <b>resource</b> management and resource use, (2) <b>the</b> Shimshal <b>community</b> relies significantly on yaks for their livelihood, and the imposition of new rules and regulations in protected areas has significantly altered <b>the</b> Shimshal <b>community’s</b> traditional yak herding practices, and (3) <b>community</b> control over <b>resources</b> in protected areas would be a new experiment under the state property regime. The study concludes that it is possible to bridge the gap between what have been regarded as irreconcilable principles of protected areas and livelihoods.
