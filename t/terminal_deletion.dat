50|$|Rather {{than the}} typical linear pattern of a chromosome, {{deletion}} of the endings of a chromosome can lead to ring formation. A chromosome has two arms, one long and one short.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a model that can simulate different types of radiation induced chromosomal aberrations (CA's) and can provide predictions on the frequency and size of chromosomes with <b>terminal</b> <b>deletions.</b> Chromosomes with <b>terminal</b> <b>deletions</b> lack telomeres and this can elicit sister chromatid unions and the prolonged breakage/fusion/bridge (B/F/B) cycles that have been observed in mammalian tumors. The loss of a single telomere {{has been shown to}} cause extensive genomic instability through the B/F/B cycle process. Our model uses a stochastic process of DNA broken end joining, in which a realistic spectrum of CA's is created from improperly joined DNA free ends formed by DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). The distribution of the DNA free ends is given by a mechanistic model that takes into account the chromatin structure and track structure for high-LET radiation. The model allows for DSB clustering from high-LET radiation and simulates the formation of CA's in stages that correspond to the actual time after radiation exposure. The time scale for CA formation is derived from experimental data on DSB repair kinetics. At any given time a nucleus may have intact chromosomes, CA's, and/or unrepaired fragments, some of which are defined as <b>terminal</b> <b>deletions,</b> if they are capped by one telomere. The model produces a spectrum of <b>terminal</b> <b>deletions</b> with their corresponding probabilities and size distributions for different heavy ions exposures for the first division after exposure. This data provides valuable information because there is limited experimental data available in the literature on the on the actual size of <b>terminal</b> <b>deletions.</b> We compare our model output to the available experimental data and make a reasonable extrapolation on the number of chromosomes lacking telomeres in human lymphocytes exposed to heavy ions. This model generates data which may lead to predictions on the rate of genomic instability in cells after exposure to high charge and energy nuclei affecting astronauts during space missions...|$|R

A correlation between phenotype and extent of deletion reveal that there is no correspondence between the size of the deletion and impairment of gonadal function.

The patient has language-based learning disabilities and behavioral features consistent with diagnoses of autism and {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} (ADHD) of the inattentive type. He also displays some other features previously associated with chromosome 3q29 microdeletion such as an elongated face, long fingers, and joint laxity. Most notably the patient, per formal IQ testing, was not found to have frank mental retardation as has been previously reported among patients with chromosome 3q29 <b>terminal</b> <b>deletion,</b> but rather the patient has demonstrated an average full-scale IQ result.

50|$|Genomic {{instability}} {{has been}} observed both in vitro and in vivo in the progeny of cells that are irradiated with heavy ions in several model systems. The presence of chromosomes that are lacking telomeres in the progeny of cells that were exposed to heavy ions is particularly interesting. Sabatier et al. found that rearrangements involving telomere regions are associated with chromosomal instability in human fibroblasts that occur many generations after exposure to accelerated heavy ions. Telomere dysfunction {{plays a crucial role}} in initiating or sustaining genomic instability, which is a major step in cancer progression. Heavy-ion-induced effects on telomere stability have also been studied using siRNA (small interfering ribonucleic acid) knockdown for components of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) in human lymphoblasts. Differential results were found for gamma rays and HZE nuclei, with iron nuclei being much more effective in producing DSB-telomere fusions after knockdown of DNA-PK. Cells containing telomere-deficient chromosomes will either senesce or undergo breakage-fusion-bridge (B/F/B) cycles, thereby promoting genetic instability. The fate of normal cells that contain a single <b>terminal</b> <b>deletion</b> is unknown, but {{it has been shown that}} the loss of a single telomere in cancer cells can result in instability in multiple chromosomes. These recent results suggest that telomere instability could be an important early event in the pathway to cancer induction by HZE nuclei.|$|E
5000|$|Various deletions {{affect the}} {{terminal}} {{region of the}} long arm of chromosome 22 (the paternal chromosome in 75% of cases), from 22q13.3 to 22qter. Although the deletion is most typically {{a result of a}} de novo mutation, there is an inherited form resulting from familial chromosomal translocations involving the 22 chromosome. In the de novo form, the size of the <b>terminal</b> <b>deletion</b> is variable and can go from 130 Kb (130,000 base pairs) to 9 Mb. Deletions smaller than 1 Mb are very rare (about 3%). The remaining 97% of terminal deletions impact about 30 to 190 genes (see list, below). At one time it was thought that deletion size was not related to the core clinical features. That observation lead to an emphasis on the SHANK3 gene, which resides close to the terminal end of chromosome 22. Interest in SHANK3 grew as it became associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Schizophrenia. [...] Since then, twelve other genes on 22q13 (MAPK8IP2, CHKB, SCO2, SBF1, PLXNB2, MAPK12, PANX2, BRD1, CELSR1, WNT7B, TCF20) have been associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder and/or Schizophrenia (see references below). Some mutations of SHANK3 mimic 22q13 deletion syndrome, but SHANK3 mutations and microdeletions have quite variable impact. Most mutations do not reflect loss of the entire gene. [...] This has been observed in mice, where deletion of both Shank3 genes produced a weaker phenotype than many mutations. That is, in some cases the complete absence of Shank3 protein has less impact than heterozygous Shank3 mutations. [...] Some of the core features of 22q13 deletion syndrome are dependent upon deletion size, and do not depend on the loss of SHANK3. [...] As noted above, the distal 1 Mb of 22q is a gene rich region. There are too few clinical cases to statistically measure the relationship between deletion size and phenotype in this region. SHANK3 is also adjacent to a gene cluster (ARSA and MAPK8IP2) [...] that has a high probability of contributing to ASD, suggesting the effects of SHANK3 deletion may be indistinguishable from other genetic losses. A landmark study of induced pluripotent stem cell neurons cultured from patients with 22q13 deletion syndrome shows that restoration of the SHANK3 protein produces a significant, but incomplete rescue of membrane receptors, supporting both a substantial role for SHANK3 and an additional role for other genes in the distal 1 Mb of chromosome 22.|$|E

Four distinct categories were delineated: <b>terminal</b> <b>deletions,</b> interstitial deletions, derivative chromosomes and complex rearrangements; each results in haploinsufficiency of the EHMT 1 gene and a characteristic phenotype. Interestingly, 25 % of our patients had de novo interstitial deletions, 25 % were found with derivative chromosomes and complex rearrangements and only 50 % were bona fide <b>terminal</b> <b>deletions.</b> In contrast to genomic disorders that are often associated with recurrent rearrangements, breakpoints involving the 9 q 34. 3 subtelomere region are highly variable. Molecular studies identified three regions of breakpoint grouping. Interspersed repetitive elements such as Alu, LINE, long-terminal repeats and simple tandem repeats are frequently observed at the breakpoints. Such repetitive elements may play an important role by providing substrates with a specific DNA secondary structure that stabilizes broken chromosomes or assist in either DNA double-strand break repair or repair of single double-strand DNA ends generated by collapsed forks. Sequence analyses of the breakpoint junctions suggest that subtelomeric deletions can be stabilized by both homologous and nonhomologous recombination mechanisms, through a telomere-capture event, by de novo telomere synthesis, or multistep breakage-fusion-bridge cycles...|$|R

40|$|Human telomeres play a {{major role}} in {{stabilizing}} chromosome ends and preventing fusions. Chromosomes bearing a broken end are rescued by the acquisition of a new telomeric cap without any subtelomeric sequences being present at the breakpoint, a process referred to as chromosome healing. Conversely, a loss of telomeric function or integrity can lead to the presence of interstitial telomeres at the junction site in translocations or ring chromosomes. In order to determine the frequency at which interstitial telomeres or chromosome healing events are observed in target chromosome abnormalities, we conducted a retrospective FISH study using pan-telomeric and chromosome-specific subtelomeric probes on archival material from 40 cases of <b>terminal</b> <b>deletions,</b> translocations or ring chromosomes. Of the 19 <b>terminal</b> <b>deletions</b> investigated, 17 were negative for the subtelomeric probe specific to the deleted arm despite being positive for the pan-telomeric probe. These 17 cases were thus considered as been rescued through chromosome healing, suggesting that this process is frequent in <b>terminal</b> <b>deletions.</b> In addition, as two of these cases were inherited from a parent bearing the same deletion, chromosomes healed by this process are thus stable through mitosis and meiosis. Regarding the 13 cases of translocations and eight ring chromosomes, four and two cases respectively demonstrated pan-telomeric sequences at the interstitial junction point. Furthermore, two cases of translocations and one ring chromosome had both interstitial pan-telomeres and subtelomeres, whereas two other cases of ring chromosomes and one case of translocation only showed interstitial subtelomeres. Therefore, interstitial (sub) telomeric sequences in translocations and ring chromosomes are more common than previously thought, as we found a frequency of 43 % in this study. Moreover, our results illustrate the necessity of performing FISH with both subtelomeric and pan-telomeric probes when investigating these rearrangements, as the breakpoints can be either in the distal part of the pan-telomeres, or in between the two types of sequences...|$|R
