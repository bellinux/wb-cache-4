5|$|Before <b>the</b> <b>deployment</b> {{there was}} {{controversy}} about the government's non-resolution of repatriation entitlements and peacekeeper coverage under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, {{and it had}} not decided if <b>the</b> <b>deployment</b> would be considered operational service. The pay and allowance issues were resolved; many other conditions-of-service issues were identified, but not resolved. During <b>the</b> <b>deployment</b> few issues were brought to Parliament's attention, although the issue of mail censorship was raised. During the second contingent's rotation, the soldiers' families had a full-time welfare officer tasked with supporting them.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Edward N. Hall was {{responsible}} for making the arrangements for <b>the</b> <b>deployment.</b> Two alternative plans were presented to Quarles, now the United States Deputy Secretary of Defense. One was for the United States to shoulder the cost, which would facilitate the fastest possible deployment. The other was for an {{agreement to be reached}} on sharing costs with the British, which would take longer. Quarles shared the plans with Eisenhower and Macmillan in Bermuda, and directed Hall to proceed with <b>the</b> <b>deployment</b> as fast as the first plan, but with the costs of the second. The result was a slower, more costly deployment. A formal agreement was drawn up on 17 December 1957, although {{it was not until the}} end of the month that it was definitely determined that Britain would receive Thor and not Jupiter missiles. <b>The</b> <b>deployment</b> of Thor missiles was codenamed Project Emily.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, five Merlin Mk3s were {{operating}} in Afghanistan, transporting troops and supplies. <b>The</b> <b>deployment</b> to Afghanistan was criticised as the aircraft reportedly lacked protective Kevlar armour.

As part of the UK drawdown in Afghanistan, Merlins were withdrawn from theatre in June 2013.|$|E

5|$|Deployment without weapons: On {{a number}} of occasions, {{soldiers}} were asked to deploy without weapons by UNTAG civilian officials.

5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, Deutschland and Admiral Scheer were deployed to the Spanish coast on 23 July 1936 to conduct non-intervention patrols off the Republican-held coast of Spain. During <b>the</b> <b>deployment,</b> her gun turrets were painted with large black, white, and red bands to aid in identification from the air and indicate her neutral status.

But on 22 June 1941 the first echelon only contained 171 divisions, numbering 2.6–2.9 million; and the second strategic echelon contained 57 divisions that were still mobilizing, most of which were still understrength. The second echelon was undetected by German intelligence until days after the invasion commenced, in most cases only when German ground forces bumped into them.|$|E
5|$|On 12December 1979, {{in light}} of a {{build-up}} of Warsaw Pact nuclear capabilities in Europe, ministers approved <b>the</b> <b>deployment</b> of US GLCM cruise missiles and PershingII theatre nuclear weapons in Europe. The new warheads were also meant to strengthen the western negotiating position regarding nuclear disarmament. This policy was called the Dual Track policy. Similarly, in 1983–84, responding to the stationing of Warsaw Pact SS-20 medium-range missiles in Europe, NATO deployed modern Pershing II missiles tasked to hit military targets such as tank formations {{in the event of}} war. This action led to peace movement protests throughout Western Europe, and support for <b>the</b> <b>deployment</b> wavered as many doubted whether the push for deployment could be sustained.|$|E
