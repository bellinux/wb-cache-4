5|$|Lead {{encephalopathy}} is {{a medical}} emergency and causes permanent brain damage in 70–80% of children affected by it, even those that receive <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>treatment.</b> The mortality rate for people who develop cerebral involvement is about 25%, and of those who survive who had lead encephalopathy symptoms by the time chelation therapy was begun, about 40% have permanent neurological problems such as cerebral palsy.|$|E
5|$|In their {{forty years}} of {{practice}} after leaving medical school, doctors hear about what works through ad hoc oral traditions, from sales reps, colleagues or journals. But those colleagues {{can be in the}} pay of drug companies– often undisclosed– and the journals are too. And so are the patient groups. And finally, academic papers, which everyone thinks of as objective, are often covertly planned and written by people who work directly for the companies, without disclosure. Sometimes whole academic journals are even owned outright by one drug company. Aside from all this, for several of the most important and enduring problems in medicine, {{we have no idea what}} <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>treatment</b> is, because it's not in anyone's financial interest to conduct any trials at all.|$|E
5|$|Pain: {{acute pain}} is mainly due to optic {{neuritis}} (with corticosteroids being <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>treatment</b> available), {{as well as}} trigeminal neuralgia, Lhermitte's sign, or dysesthesias. Subacute pain is usually secondary to the disease and can be a consequence of spending too long in the same position, urinary retention, and infected skin ulcers, amongst others. Treatment will depend on cause. Chronic pain is very common and harder to treat as its most common cause is dysesthesias. Acute pain due to trigeminal neuralgia is usually successfully treated with anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine or phenytoin. Both Lhermitte's sign and painful dysesthesias usually respond to treatment with carbamazepine, clonazepam, or amitriptyline. Sativex is approved for treatment of pain in MS in different countries, but due to its derivation from cannabis, it is currently not available in others, such as the USA. This medication is also being investigated {{for the management of}} other MS symptoms, such as spasticity, and has shown long-term safety and efficacy.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>best</b> <b>treatment</b> {{approach}} {{is to improve the}} immune status in immunodeficient individuals using highly active antiretroviral therapy that includes an HIV protease inhibitor along with continued use of antiparasitic medication. Antiparasitic drug treatment for immunocompromised individuals usually involves the combination of nitazoxanide, paromomycin, and azithromycin together; these drugs are only partially active in HIV/AIDS patients compared to their effect in immunocompetent persons. A Cochrane Collaboration review recommended that nitazoxanide be considered for use in treatment despite its reduced effectiveness in immunocompromised individuals.|$|E

25|$|Mastitis is an {{inflammation}} of the breast. It causes local pain (dolor), redness (rubor), swelling (tumor), and warmth (calor). Later stages of mastitis cause symptoms of systemic infection like fever and nausea. It mostly occurs 2–3 weeks after delivery but can happen at any time. Typically results from milk stasis with primary or secondary local, later systemic infection. Infectious organisms include Staphylococcus sp., Streptococcus sp. and E. coli. Continued breastfeeding, plenty of rest and adequate fluid supply is <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>treatment</b> for light cases.|$|E
25|$|If stung, {{the site}} will appear red and may remain itchy and swollen for many days. <b>The</b> <b>best</b> <b>treatment</b> of stings is to first wash the area with soap and water, then use an antiseptic, and if {{swelling}} remains apply an ice pack. Many people are allergic to wasp venom, {{and if this is}} the case, a sting can result in severe anaphylactic shock. Symptoms of this include swelling of airways, including mouth lips and tongue, troubled breathing, dizziness and tightness of chest. If an individual exhibits any of these symptoms after acquiring a sting from R. romandi seek medical attention immediately.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>best</b> <b>treatment</b> for {{cutaneous}} leishmaniasis is not known. Treatments {{that work for}} one species of leishmania may not work for another; {{it is recommended that}} advice of a tropical medicine or geographical medicine specialist be sought. Ideally, every effort should be made to establish the species of leishmania by molecular techniques (PCR) prior to starting treatment. In the setting of a developing country, there is often only one species present in a particular locality, so it is usually unnecessary to speciate every infection. Unfortunately, leishmaniasis is an orphan disease in developed nations, and almost all the current treatment options are toxic with significant side effects. The most sound treatment for {{cutaneous leishmaniasis}} thus far is prevention.|$|E

25|$|Another underrecognized and {{potentially}} life-threatening side effect spectrum is gastrointestinal hypomotility, which may manifest as severe constipation, fecal impaction, paralytic ileus, bowel obstruction, acute megacolon, ischemia or necrosis. Colonic hypomotility {{has been shown}} to occur in up to 80% of people prescribed clozapine when gastrointestinal function is measured objectively using radiopaque markers. Clozapine-induced gastrointestinal hypomotility currently has a higher mortality rate than the better known side effect of agranulocytosis. A Cochrane review found little evidence to help guide decisions about <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>treatment</b> for gastrointestinal hypomotility caused by clozapine and other antipsychotic medication. Monitoring bowel function and the preemptive use of laxatives for all clozapine-treated people {{has been shown to}} improve colonic transit times and reduce serious sequelae.|$|E
25|$|By using CBT people record {{how much}} food they eat and periods of {{vomiting}} {{with the purpose}} of identifying and avoiding emotional fluctuations that bring on episodes of bulimia on a regular basis. Barker (2003) states that research has found 40–60% of people using cognitive behaviour therapy to become symptom free. He states in order for the therapy to work, all parties must work together to discuss, record and develop coping strategies. Barker (2003) claims by making people aware of their actions they will think of alternatives. People undergoing CBT who exhibit early behavioral changes are most likely to achieve <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>treatment</b> outcomes in the long run. Researchers have also reported some positive outcomes for interpersonal psychotherapy and dialectical behavior therapy.|$|E

A second ambulance was called for to take Schultz and Berman. Berman was unconscious, but Schultz was drifting in and out of lucidity, as police attempted to comfort him and get information. Because the medics had no pain relievers, Schultz was given brandy to relieve his suffering. When the second ambulance arrived, Schultz gave one of the medics $10,000 in cash to see that he received <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>treatment.</b> After surgery, when it looked as if Schultz would live, the medic was so worried that he would be indebted to the mobster for keeping the money that he shoved the money back in bed with Schultz.|$|E

25|$|The MBBS course {{starts with}} the basic pre and para-clinical {{subjects}} such as biochemistry, physiology, anatomy, microbiology, pathology and pharmacology. The students simultaneously obtain hands-on training in the wards and out-patient departments, where they interact with real patients for five long years. The curriculum aims to inculcate standard protocols of history taking, examination, differential diagnosis and Complete patient Management. The student is taught to determine what investigations will be useful for a patient and what are <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>treatment</b> options. The curriculum also contains a thorough practical knowledge and practice of performing standard clinical procedures. The course also contains a 12-month-long internship, in which an intern is rotated across various specialties. Besides standard clinical care, one also gets a thorough experience of ward management, staff management and thorough counselling skills.|$|E
25|$|Pharmacogenomics: type {{of genetic}} testing that determines the {{influence}} of genetic variation on drug response. When a person has a disease or health condition, pharmacogenomics can examine an individual’s genetic makeup to determine what medicine and what dosage would be the safest and most beneficial to the patient. In the human population, there are approximately 11 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in people’s genomes, making them the most common variations in the human genome. SNPs reveal information about an individual’s response to certain drugs. This type of genetic testing {{can be used for}} cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. A sample of the cancer tissue can be sent in for genetic analysis by a specialized lab. After analysis, information retrieved can identify mutations in the tumor which can be used to determine <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>treatment</b> option.|$|E

His bright nine-year-old daughter Anne who had become a particular favourite and comfort to him fell sick. She was miserable for weeks on end, then became feverish. Their doctor could do nothing and thought it might be inherited. She had recovered to some extent by March 1851, but then she and her father were both laid low by influenza. Darwin recovered but Annie was still ill, and on 24 March he took her to Malvern, leaving her there for <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>treatment</b> he knew of, and returning to Downe where Emma had stayed as she was pregnant.
