500|$|Under Dunn's experience, {{the band}} instituted some traditions that the {{university}} uses to the present. In 1925, Marvin H. Mimms wrote the lyrics for an alma mater for the school. Dunn, who found the Aggie War Hymn [...] "inappropriate" [...] for social functions and solemn occasions, wrote its accompanying music and presented it to the student body titled Spirit of Aggieland. In 1926, the tradition of Elephant Walk began when two seniors in the band led a procession of seniors throughout the school grounds visiting all the important places on campus. All the seniors in one single file was [...] "quite a site to behold", and one junior commented that they looked {{like a bunch of}} old elephants wandering around <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>some</b> place to die. The name stuck and the tradition continues to the present.|$|E
500|$|Rick Thames, {{editor of}} The Charlotte Observer, criticized the book's {{packaging}} calling the cover as [...] "tacky, hot pink-and-acid green sleeves, featuring an unflattering {{photo of the}} dished artist." [...] Barry Didcock from Sunday Herald felt that [...] "Morton [...] to find the face of Madonna." [...] He criticized Morton's sketchy portrayal of Madonna's relationship with deceased painter Jean-Michel Basquiat, saying [...] "he commits an error by doing so because, unusually for Madonna, this was a relationship of equals." [...] Gregg Barrios from Daily Star was critical of the book, saying [...] " [...] The fatal flaw of these quickie knockoffs {{is that they have}} no real ending or any way of predicting what the fates have in store for Madonna Louise Penn [...] nee Ciccone. Once the next Madonna tour, CD, marriage or film appears, their shelf life is cut short." [...] Barbara Ellen from The Guardian criticized Morton's writing by saying, [...] "Andrew Morton achieves the implausible: he takes an interesting woman and an astonishing life and makes them both seem incredibly boring in his life of Madonna.... Once you get used to Morton's pace (dull plod, with occasional snooze), it becomes quite amusing joining him on the journey, a bit like watching someone dragging a dead body around, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>some</b> place to hide it. Even luminaries such as Madonna exes Sean Penn and Warren Beatty are reduced to flailing around like disenfranchised phantoms in the shallows of Morton's blandly automatic insight." ...|$|E

A few songs ("Let's Blow it All," [...] "Give Me Some of That") are more lighthearted in tone. Her quieter, more {{acoustic}} songs often deal with relationships ("When You Loved Me") and particular places ("Trying Not to Think About It"). Sometimes they have a wistful melancholy, a sense of struggling to carry on, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>some</b> meaning in life ("Backseat", [...] "Feelin' Massachusetts"). [...] Since the mid-1990s songs such as [...] "Sellout" [...] have dealt in {{a more or less}} overtly sarcastic way with the demands the music industry places on artists (particularly female ones) in order to ensure their [...] "success." ...|$|E

2500|$|Antoine Roquentin – The {{protagonist of}} the novel, Antoine {{is a former}} adventurer who {{has been living in}} Bouville for three years. Antoine does not keep in touch with family, and has no friends. He is a loner at heart and often likes to listen to other people's conversations and examine their actions. He settles in the fictional French seaport town of Bouville to finish his {{research}} on the life of an 18th-century political figure. But during the winter of 1932 a [...] "sweetish sickness," [...] as he calls nausea, increasingly impinges on almost everything he does or enjoys: his research project, the company of an autodidact who is reading all the books in the local library alphabetically, a physical relationship with a café owner named Françoise, his memories of Anny, an English girl he once loved, even his own hands and the beauty of nature. Even though he at times admits to <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>some</b> sort of solace in the presence of others, he also exhibits signs of boredom and lack of interest when interacting with people. His relationship with Françoise is mostly hygienic in nature, for the two hardly exchange words and, when invited by the Self-Taught Man to accompany him for lunch, he agrees only to write in his diary later that: [...] "I had as much desire to eat with him as I had to hang myself." [...] He can afford not to work, but spends a lot of his time writing a book about a French politician of the eighteenth century. Antoine does not think highly of himself: [...] "The faces of others have some sense, some direction. Not mine. I cannot even decide whether it is handsome or ugly. I think it is ugly because I have been told so." [...] When he starts suffering from the Nausea he feels the need to talk to Anny, but when he finally does, it makes no difference to his condition. He eventually starts to think he does not even exist: [...] "My existence was beginning to cause me some concern. Was I a mere figment of the imagination?" ...|$|E
