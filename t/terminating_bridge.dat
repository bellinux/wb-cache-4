25|$|Elevated roadways are {{typically}} built on sections of elevated earth fill connected with bridge-like segments, often supported with vertical columns. If the soil fails where a <b>bridge</b> <b>terminates,</b> the <b>bridge</b> may become {{disconnected from the}} rest of the roadway and break away. The retrofit for this is to add additional reinforcement to any supporting wall, or to add deep caissons adjacent to the edge at each end and connect them with a supporting beam under the bridge.|$|R

5000|$|A routing bridge or RBridge, {{also known}} as a TRILL Switch, is a network device that {{implements}} the TRILL protocol, as specified by the IETF [...] and {{should not be confused with}} BRouters (Bridging Routers). RBridges are compatible with previous IEEE 802.1 customer bridges as well as IPv4 and IPv6 routers and end nodes. They are invisible to current IP routers and, like routers, RBridges <b>terminate</b> the <b>bridge</b> spanning tree protocol.|$|R

50|$|TRILL ("TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links") is an IETF Standard {{implemented}} by devices called RBridges (routing bridges) or TRILL Switches. TRILL combines techniques from bridging and routing {{and is the}} application of link state routing to the VLAN-aware customer-bridging problem. RBridges are compatible with and can incrementally replace previous IEEE 802.1 customer bridges. They are also compatible with IPv4 and IPv6 routers and end nodes. They are invisible to current IP routers and, like routers, RBridges <b>terminate</b> the <b>bridge</b> spanning tree protocol.|$|R

50|$|Although trains {{from the}} Tynemouth {{part of the}} Blyth and Tyne section could run direct to Newcastle Central station, the South Gosforth line <b>terminated</b> at New <b>Bridge</b> Street. The {{terminus}} was only {{a short distance from}} the former Newcastle and North Shields Railway main line at Manors, and in 1909 a short connecting line was laid in, enabling through running to and from Central station. Although trains could now run Central to Central by a circular route, for some years this was not done, and only trains from Central to South Gosforth used the connection, other services continuing to <b>terminate</b> at New <b>Bridge</b> Street. From 1 March 1917 the arrangement was rationalised, and trains ran throughout over the connecting line/.|$|R

40|$|We present atomistic {{calculations}} of quantum coherent electron transport through fulleropyrrolidine <b>terminated</b> molecules <b>bridging</b> a graphene nanogap. We predict that three difficult problems in molecular electronics with single molecules {{can be solved}} by utilizing graphene contacts: (1) a back gate modulating the Fermi level in the graphene leads facilitates control of the device conductance in a transistor effect with high on-off current ratio; (2) the size mismatch between leads and molecule is avoided, {{in contrast to the}} traditional metal contacts; (3) as a consequence, distinct features in charge flow patterns throughout the device are directly detectable by scanning techniques. We show that moderate graphene edge disorder is unimportant for the transistor function...|$|R
50|$|A {{small portion}} of U.S. 431 is famous for a unique reason. U.S. 431 crosses the Green River in McLean County, Kentucky. It is at that {{crossing}} {{in the city of}} Livermore that U.S. 431 crosses two rivers and also crosses into Ohio County before completing the river crossing back in McLean County. This is the only known crossing of this type in the United States: a road starts in one county, crosses two separate rivers, crosses a sliver of land within another county, and then <b>terminates</b> the <b>bridge</b> crossing in the original county it started in. This special feature is marked by a state historical marker on both approach ends of the bridge.|$|R
