[...] "Over <b>the</b> <b>years,</b> <b>we</b> have learned more of his decade-long quest to build a new stadium in Brooklyn and about how those efforts were thwarted by city officials. Perhaps this induction will inspire fans who themselves started new lives outside the borough to reconsider their thoughts about Walter O’Malley", said John Mooney, curator of the Irish American Baseball Hall of Fame. [...] "He privately built one of baseball's more beautiful ballparks, Dodger Stadium, and set attendance records annually. While New York is the home of the Irish American Baseball Hall of Fame, it seeks to honor inductees whose impact was and is national." ...|$|E

As much as we want this tour to end as it started, we understand, respect and support Brian's decision to stop touring and save his hearing. We are dedicated to fulfilling the remainder of our touring commitments to everyone that has supported us over the years, and are fortunate that Axl Rose has kindly offered his support to help us fulfill this commitment. AC/DC will resume their Rock or Bust World Tour with Axl Rose joining on vocals." ...|$|E

Thank you for your support." [...] The Oregonian published an article containing memories of the restaurant submitted by readers. Esparza's was replaced by The Blue Goose, a [...] "Southwestern-grill-meets-New-Mexico" [...] restaurant serving Mexican and Tex-Mex cuisine, named after the neighborhood tavern of similar title that occupied the building.|$|E

2500|$|The Yankees {{organization}} {{did work}} closely with the Creatures to ensure that they sat together again, and designated a total of 136 season-ticket packages for them in section 203. The move was monitored by long-time Creature Teena Lewis, known as the [...] "Queen of the Bleachers", and Marc Chalpin, who organized a list of about 50+ Creatures to ensure they would all be sitting together again in the new stadium. Despite the Creatures' concerns over how the Yankees management would handle the move, Lewis said that, [...] "The Yankees helped us because I calmed everybody down over <b>the</b> <b>years.</b> <b>We</b> behaved ourselves, took away some of the chants, and they pretty much paid us back." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, not all {{opinions}} on the subject among prominent mountaineers are strictly negative. For example, Edmund Hillary, who went on record saying {{that he has not}} liked [...] "the commercialization of mountaineering, particularly of Mt. Everest" [...] and claimed that [...] "Having people pay $65,000 and then be led up the mountain by a couple of experienced guides...isn't really mountaineering at all", nevertheless noted that he was pleased by the changes brought to Everest area by Westerners, [...] "I don't have any regrets because I worked very hard indeed to improve the condition for the local people. When we first went in there they didn't have any schools, they didn't have any medical facilities, all over <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>we</b> have established 27 schools, we have two hospitals and a dozen medical clinics and then we've built bridges over wild mountain rivers and put in fresh water pipelines so in cooperation with the Sherpas we've done a lot to benefit them." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 1950, Stiteler {{reported}} that he had been attacked and beaten by a stranger near the Shamrock Hotel in Houston, where Stiteler had been scheduled to address a group of Texas A alumni. [...] Stiteler tried to downplay the incident, but the press reported Stiteler declined to provide details to the police and that there were conflicting versions as to what had happened. [...] The San Antonio Light reported the incident under a banner headline, [...] "MYSTERY SHROUDS STITELER BEATING." [...] In March 1951, Stiteler admitted that he had misrepresented the facts concerning the assault. [...] He {{reported that}} he had known his attacker and [...] "the affair was a personal one." [...] Embarrassed, Stiteler submitted his letter of resignation to the President of Texas A upon revealing the true facts concerning [...] "my affair in Houston." [...] Following the resignation, the members of the football team issued a statement in support of their former coach:"We believe that whatever happened to Mr. Stiteler was a personal matter and it should have remained that. A lot of us boys came to A. and M. in 1948 not because A. and M. had won games but simply because of Harry Stiteler and his character. He has never ceased to set us that same example in <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>we</b> have played and worked for him." [...] In three years as the head coach at Texas A, Stiteler compiled a record of 8–21–2.|$|E
2500|$|On July 6, 2009, Ryan Ross and Jon Walker {{announced}} via the band's {{official website}} {{that the two}} were leaving the band. The statement, in part, read: [...] "Ryan Ross and Jon Walker will be leaving Panic at the Disco {{to embark on a}} musical excursion of their own. Though the four of us have made music together in the past, we’ve creatively evolved in different directions which has compromised what each of us want to personally achieve. Over <b>the</b> <b>years,</b> <b>we</b> have remained close and honest with each other, which helped us to realize that our goals were different and that parting ways is truly what is best for each of us." [...] In an interview following the split, Ross explained that he first brought the idea to Smith in late June 2009 over lunch: [...] "Spencer and I had lunch and caught up for a while, and then the big question came up, like, 'Well, {{what do you want to}} do?' and I said, 'Well, I think it might be best if we kind of do our own thing for a while,' and he said, 'I'm glad you said that, because I was going to say the same thing,' [...] " [...] Ross recalled. [...] "And there was really no argument, which is really the best way that could've worked out." [...] Ross said the split was largely due to creative differences between him and Urie. Urie wanted the band to explore a more polished pop sound, while Ross — and, by extension, Walker — was interested in making retro-inspired rock.|$|E

60|$|I {{shall not}} tell in detail of <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>we</b> lived by the sea. It {{was not a}} happy abiding-place.
