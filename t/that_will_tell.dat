Bulgaria has already shaken it off and is moving forward". The date of the inauguration also marked the formal occupation of Bulgaria by communists in 1944. As journalist Georgi Lozanov noted: [...] "Bulgaria must have a museum of communism <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> new generations the story of a period that should never again become reality".|$|E
500|$|In March 2013, {{researchers}} {{published the}} DNA {{sequence of the}} genome of a strain of HeLa cells. The Lacks family discovered this when the author Rebecca Skloot informed them. There were objections from the Lacks family about the genetic information that was available for public access. [...] Jeri Lacks Whye, a grandchild of Henrietta Lacks, said to The New York Times, [...] "the biggest concern was privacy - what information was {{actually going to be}} out there about our grandmother, and what information they can obtain from her sequencing <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> them about her children and grandchildren and going down the line". [...] That same year another group working on a different HeLa cell line's genome under NIH funding submitted it for publication. In August 2013, an agreement was announced between the family and the National Institutes of Health that gave the family some control over access to the cells' DNA sequence found in the two studies along with a promise of acknowledgement in scientific papers. In addition, two family members will join the six-member committee which will regulate access to the sequence data.|$|E

[...] On former Senator Fred Thompson's radio program, McCaughey warned that [...] "the healthcare reform bill would make it mandatory—absolutely require—that every five years people in Medicare have a required counseling session <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> them how to end their life sooner." [...] She said those sessions would help the elderly learn how to [...] "decline nutrition, how to decline being hydrated, how to go in to hospice care ... all to do what's in society's best interest or in your family's best interest and cut your life short." [...] As The New York Times mentioned, conservative pundits were comparing the Nazi T4 euthanasia program to Obama’s policies {{as far back as}} November 2008, calling them [...] "America's T4 program—trivialization of abortion, acceptance of euthanasia, and the normalization of physician assisted suicide." ...|$|E

Just read the 50+ humorous guidance and playful instructions in this book <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> you exactly what to do and how to do it. As the author suggests, [...] "When I was a kid, everybody believed that disciplining a child will create miracles. And sometimes it does. This book is about the fact that everything and everyone can be disciplined. (Except, of course, ourselves, because our personality is as sturdy as the icebergs at the North Pole. When I wrote the first instructions on how to discipline our family members, I suddenly realized: I can discipline anyone from a UFO to the police and the ghost in the attic. And I did, with no mercy!" ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 27, 2016, it was {{announced}} that the British Academy Award winning film director Kevin Macdonald, who created Marley (2012) and the production team, Altitude, behind the controversial award-winning film about Amy Winehouse, Amy (2015), that a documentary film on Whitney Houston's life and death, entitled as [...] is scheduled to be released in 2017. This is the first documentary to be officially authorized by the estate <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> the unvarnished and authentic story of the singer’s life in a film, including access to never-before-seen footage of Houston, exclusive demo recordings, rare performances and audio archive. Macdonald also will interview those who knew her best, including Clive Davis, founder and president of Arista Records. Macdonald stated; [...] "The story that is never told about Whitney is just how brilliant she was as an artist; by many measures she had the greatest voice of the last 50 years. She changed the way pop music was sung - bringing it back full circle to its blues and gospel roots. She was also completely unique in being a black pop star who transcended her race globally with her work sold in countries where black artists don’t sell." [...] The biopic will be released theatrically on June 11, 2017.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2009, McCaughey {{claimed that}} a {{section in the}} pending {{healthcare}} legislation, [...] "Advance Care Planning Consultation", actually prescribed [...] "euthanasia for the elderly" [...] because it included provisions that:would make it mandatory — absolutely require — that every five years people in Medicare have a required counseling session <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> them how to end their life sooner [...] decline nutrition, how to decline being hydrated, how to go in to hospice care ... all to do what's in society's best interest or in your family's best interest and cut your life short.McCaughey's choice of words and analysis were described by The Atlantics James Fallows as inaccurate and sensationalistic. Politifact responded that the end-of-life counseling was voluntary, calling McCaughey's claim a [...] "ridiculous falsehood" [...] and giving it their lowest accuracy rating, [...] "pants on fire". Factcheck.org called the claims [...] "nonsense" [...] and stated that what that section of the bill would actually do is [...] "require Medicare to pay for voluntary counseling sessions helping seniors to plan for end-of-life medical care, including designating a health care proxy, choosing a hospice and making decisions about life-sustaining treatment." [...] During an appearance on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart which aired on August 20, 2009, McCaughey repeated these assertions about the counselling sessions and referred to the Factcheck.org as [...] "spot-check dot org", claiming they failed to adequately read the House health care bill. In a rebuttal, Factcheck.org stood by their analysis and provided further analysis, which led them to conclude that McCaughey had misinterpreted the bill.|$|E
