5000|$|Tomas Mureika of All Music said [...] "An astonishingly mature album by any artist's rights, The Whiff of Bedlam delves into {{territory}} {{many would}} never even dare to approach, {{all the while}} remaining cloaked {{in some of the}} most gorgeous melodies Reyne has ever crafted. The opening [...] "Who <b>The</b> <b>Hell</b> <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Think</b> You Are?" [...] sets the agenda - from a wispy electric piano intro, Reyne launches into an enigmatically vicious attack against someone, yet does so simply through the dynamics of his voice, avoiding the high-pitched intensity that earmarked his earlier works. From then on, there are twelve achingly soulful confessionals through which Reyne seems constantly on the verge of tears.. The devastating [...] "It's Only Natural" [...] moves from an organ intro through [...] hook after hook, as Reyne seems to resign himself to his new discoveries as he has aged, only to immediately counter the downfall with the more upbeat melancholy of [...] "Winds Of Change". With the harrowing possibilities unleashed by The Whiff of Bedlam, it is certain to say that Reyne has found his own day in the sun... and it keeps getting gloriously darker.".|$|E

5000|$|Among fellow comic creators, Kanigher was as {{well known}} for his {{unstable}} personality and violent temper as he was for his brilliance as a writer, and collaborators such as Gene Colan and John Romita Sr. have commented on the difficulty of working with him. Romita recounted: I worked on a series with Kanigher - he wrote two series {{for me in the}} romance dept. One about an airline stewardess, and one about a nurse.
