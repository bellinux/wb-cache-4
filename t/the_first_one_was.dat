The second was in response to the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914. The third mobilisation of the army took place in September 1939 in response to the German attack on Poland; Henri Guisan was elected as the General-in-Chief.|$|E
5|$|An immaculate inning {{occurs in}} {{baseball}} when a pitcher in a half-inning of play throws only nine pitches, {{each of which}} is a strike and thus strikes out three consecutive batters. Immaculate innings are uncommon, rarer than the better known individual gameplay feats of a batter's hitting for the cycle and a pitcher's no hitter. Currently 84 different Major League Baseball (MLB) pitchers have accomplished this feat for a total of 89 immaculate innings. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> pitched by John Clarkson of the Boston Beaneaters on June 4, 1889, in the third inning against the Philadelphia Quakers. Since then, only four players––Lefty Grove, Nolan Ryan, Randy Johnson, and Sandy Koufax––have thrown an immaculate inning more than once in their careers. Koufax is the only pitcher to throw three of them. A record eight immaculate innings have been thrown in the 2017 MLB season through August 8.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, Kistiakowsky was {{the head}} of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) section {{responsible}} for the development of explosives, and the technical director of the Explosives Research Laboratory (ERL), where he oversaw the development of new explosives, including RDX and HMX. He was involved in research into the hydrodynamic theory of explosions, and the development of shaped charges. In October 1943, he was brought into the Manhattan Project as a consultant. He was soon placed in charge of X Division, which was responsible for the development of the explosive lenses necessary for an implosion-type nuclear weapon. In July 1945, he watched as <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> detonated in the Trinity test. A few weeks later another Fat Man implosion-type weapon was dropped on Nagasaki.|$|E
5|$|During {{the design}} process, the A318 {{encountered}} several problems. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> {{the decline in}} demand for new aircraft following the September 11 attacks. Another was the new Pratt & Whitney turbofan engines, which burned more fuel than expected; by the time CFM International (CFM) had a more efficient engine ready for market, many A318 customers had already backed out, including Air China and British Airways. America West Airlines, which had selected the Pratt & Whitney engines, amended its A318 orders, opting instead for A319 or A320 aircraft. Trans World Airlines cancelled a significant order for fifty A318s after being acquired by American Airlines, which did not operate any A320 family aircraft at the time (although neither did TWA when the order was originally placed). While Airbus was hoping to market the A318 as a regional jet alternative, laws in both the U.S. and Europe have kept {{it in the same}} class as larger aircraft for calculating charges such as landing fees, limiting the type's market potential.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} WrestleMania, Vince McMahon began cross {{promoting}} with MTV, which aired two wrestling specials. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> The Brawl to End It All, aired on July 23, 1984, {{in which a}} match from a live Madison Square Garden broadcast was shown on MTV. Wendi Richter defeated The Fabulous Moolah to win the WWF Women's Championship on the card, with Cyndi Lauper on her side. At The War to Settle the Score, which aired on February 18, 1985, Leilani Kai, accompanied by Moolah, defeated Richter, again accompanied by Lauper, to win the Women's Championship. Aside from Lauper, other celebrities also appeared during the buildup to and at the event; most notably Muhammad Ali, Liberace (with The Rockettes) and Major League Baseball manager Billy Martin all appeared during the main event.|$|E

5|$|In {{the credits}} of Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix, clips {{of the games}} {{featured}} in the collection were shown, hinting at the collection. Additionally, when IGN interviewed Shinji Hashimoto about Kingdom Hearts III, he stated that the studio would consider another HD collection if the reaction to <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> positive enough. The collection was announced on October 14, 2013, exclusively for the PlayStation 3. As with HD 1.5 Remix, the collection was developed mainly by the Square Enix 1st Production Department in Osaka, along with some help from Square Enix's Tokyo team. In July 2017, Nomura spoke on bringing the collection to the Xbox One, saying {{he did not believe}} there was much demand for it outside of North America, but felt it could be a possibility after Square Enix completed development on Kingdom Hearts III.|$|E
5|$|Many {{visitors}} {{arriving on}} the steamers {{never left the}} pier and Birnbeck Island which between them housed the cafe, pavilion, amusements and funfair. These were destroyed by fire on 26 December 1897 and replaced by the present buildings, although these have been altered over the years. The attractions included Mutoscopes, a shooting gallery, merry-go-round, park swings, a theatre of wonders and a licensed bar. In 1891 a telephone was installed only six months after <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> installed in the town. In 1909, the amusement area was expanded by an extension on iron supports along {{the south side of}} the island. However, this was not built to the proper specifications so was demolished in 1912; a larger concrete platform was added in its place in 1932.|$|E
5|$|Vukassovich was {{instrumental}} in development of transport infrastructure in the present-day Croatian Littoral at {{the shores of the}} Adriatic Sea. His most significant contributions in the field were construction of roads after his designs. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> GospićKarlobag road, also known as Theresiana road, completed between 1784 and 1786which replaced an earlier route which comprised very steep grades limiting its capacity. The new road permitted setting up of a free port in Karlobag and significantly improved connection to the seaward slopes of Velebit. Currently, the route largely corresponds to the western section of the D25 road. The other major route Vukassovich designed was the Louisiana road between Karlovac and Rijeka with a branch serving Bakar. The road was built between 1803 and 1811, and the route is now used by the D3 road. Vukassovich also designed a coastal road between Senj and Sveti Juraj, port structures in Senj, and directed reconstruction of the Josephina road leading from Senj to Karlovac.|$|E
