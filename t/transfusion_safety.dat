Using a robust and automated solution, we describe a new method for extended blood group genotyping (HiFi-Blood 96) bringing together the throughput possibilities of complete automation and the microarray multiplexed analysis potential. Our approach provides a useful resource for upgrading blood qualification center facilities. A set of six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with clinically important blood group antigens (Kell, Kidd, Duffy, and MNS systems) were selected and the corresponding genotyping assays developed. A panel of 293 blood samples was used to validate the approach. The resulting genotypes were compared to phenotypes previously determined by standard serologic techniques, and excellent correlations were found for five SNPs out of six. For the Kell, Kidd, Duffy, and MNS 3 /MNS 4 systems, high matching percentages of 100 %, 98. 9 %, 97. 7 %, and 97. 4 % were obtained, respectively, whereas a concordance percentage of 83. 3 % only was attained for the MNS 1 /MNS 2 polymorphism...|$|R

40|$|Blood {{transfusion}} {{has always}} been crucial and strictly monitored. Currently, there are many standards for managing transfusion blood bags. One standard is maintaining the temperature of blood bags during transfusion. Transfusion staff are expected to check {{the temperature of the}} transfused blood bag in real time and take action if the temperature exceeds the limit. However, many healthcare organizations have not implemented procedures by which transfusion staff can instantly track the temperature of a transfused blood bag. Therefore, a temperature monitoring solution that displays the temperature data in real time is necessary. In this solution, radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology is used to actively detect the temperature of the blood bag and upload the temperature record to the web server. This research was carried out to analyze the benefits and limitations of a web-based RFID temperature monitoring application. The first chapter is a literature review on RFID technology, application of RFID drug tracking, and prior research into blood <b>transfusion</b> and <b>safety</b> concerns in using RFID on blood products.

Since 2004, WHO has initiated a specific post-academic Masters course focused on management of Transfusion Medicine (MMTM). This MMTM course is largely based on eLearning (distance learning principle). Methods: evaluation of reported experiences of fellows and eLearning providers (teachers) with the eLearning part of MMTM, as applied to developing countries. Results: 17 fellows have entered the eLearning part of the MMTM course coming from African, Asian and Caribbean countries.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Erythropoietin {{has been}} widely adapted into {{clinical}} practice in orthopedic surgery to prevent anemia and ultimately lower the use of allogeneic blood <b>transfusions.</b> Its <b>safety</b> and efficacy {{has been shown in}} various randomized clinical trials. Questions regarding the cost-effectiveness of this treatment, however, have yet to be answered conclusively. Notably, current indication guidelines are based on preoperative hemoglobin levels, but do not differentiate between total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA). This literature review aims at analyzing the cost-effectiveness of preoperative erythropoietin as blood sparing measure in patients undergoing elective orthopedic surgery, specifically THA and TKA. Additionally, patient inclusion criteria are analyzed in order to identify the potentially most cost-effective patient subgroups, e. g. based on preoperative hemoglobin levels, primary or revisional surgery and THA versus TKA. METHODS: Systematic literature review. RESULTS: A MEDLINE database search and subsequent exclusion of irrelevant or inaccessible papers resulted in the inclusion of 8 research articles that at least partially performed a cost-effectiveness or cost-benefit analysis of erythropoietin in orthopedic surgery. Four of the studies concluded erythropoietin is not cost-effective, three studies were not able to draw a conclusion based on their data, and one study found erythropoietin cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: We found that studies were difficult to compare, with inclusion criteria and comparators varying among studies. Notably, most economic evaluations were substantially lacking depth and did not comply with common guidelines for pharmacoeconomic research. Although some articles found erythropoietin generally not cost-effective, their data did suggest otherwise within certain patient subgroups. Patients with lower preoperative hemoglobin levels, primary surgery and THA benefitted the most from erythropoietin. Additionally, most studies seemed to overestimate treatment costs, using outdated prices or neglecting competitively priced biosimilars. Therefore, a more differentiated approach is required to elucidate the costeffectiveness of erythropoietin in orthopedic surgery, discriminating between total hip and knee arthroplasty...|$|R

40|$|Background: Blood {{transfusion}} {{is imperative}} when treating certain patients; however, {{it is not}} risk free. In addition to the possible transmission of contagious infectious diseases, incidents can occur immediately after transfusion and at a later time. Aims: This study aimed to examine the immediate transfusion incidents reported in a regional blood bank {{in the state of}} Minas Gerais between December 2006 and December 2009. A retrospective quantitative epidemiological study was conducted. Data were obtained from 202 transfusion incident reports of 42 health institutions served by the blood bank. Data processing and analysis were carried out using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software. Results: The rate of immediate transfusion incidents reported in the period was 0. 24 %; febrile non-hemolytic reactions were {{the most common type of}} incident (56. 4 %). The most frequent clinical manifestations listed in transfusion incident reports were chills (26. 9 %) and fever (21. 6 %). There was a statistically significant association (p-value < 0. 05) between the infusion of platelet concentrates and febrile non-hemolytic reactions and between fresh frozen plasma and febrile non-hemolytic reaction. The majority (73. 3 %) of transfused patients who suffered immediate transfusion incidents had already been transfused and 36. 5 % of the cases had previous transfusion incident reports.

Since 2004, WHO has initiated a specific post-academic Masters course focused on management of Transfusion Medicine (MMTM). This MMTM course is largely based on eLearning (distance learning principle). Approach - Since the eLearning course became operational in 2006 there have been registered two dozens of qualified fellows {{from a variety of}} developing countries and a few more advanced countries. Fellows are provided personal electronic instructions how to access once all criteria including acceptance of a proper post-academic dissertation proposal have been met. The access codes are personal and not public and need to be archived during the course to guarantee a continued access over time. Fellows were followed during the eLearning period and their progress monitored and evaluated. Specific attention was given to the ease of handling the e-environment and its related e-technicalities. Fundamental are access to internet, uninterrupted power supply, consistence of use of a computer (PC or laptop) and computer literacy. Results - Most of the fellows come from developing parts of the world, predominantly sub-Saharan Africa. There are distinct differences in country infrastructure and e-environment. Although academically qualified (in-country University diploma's) a majority is not familiar with e-technology and computer handling other than some internet exploring and basic office functions like Word and PPT. Accessibility awareness is not really developed. Major obstacles encountered are - inconsistent internet access due to supplier problems; unreliable power supply due to poor and incompetent infrastructure; virus contamination of lap tops and PCs due to frequent uncontrolled use of memory sticks in internet cafe's and through friends and relatives; poor and not maintained firewall conditions; mediocre computer literacy, particularly when skills beyond basic office functions are required; lap top and PC breakdown due to uncontrolled working conditions and improper working environments; Conclusions - As fellows are scattered around the world, and live in developing societies with a limited e-and ICT teaching infrastructure, it would be appropriate to include in the eLearning package an instructive e-module on how to handle and manage the eLearning tools, how to manage day-to-day problems of access and downloading, as well as re-access for e. g. e-exams and access to new modules in the course.

Materials and Methods: Single-institution retrospective chart review with 73 patients who underwent PCNL divided into two groups: Amplatz PCNL (n = 26) and MTD PCNL (n = 47). Efficacy (stone-free rate, residual stones, and surgical duration) and <b>safety</b> (<b>transfusion</b> rate and hemoglobin decrease) were evaluated. Complications were recorded and classified using the modified Clavien classification system. Results: The two PCNL groups were similar regarding mean age, stone burden, side, stone location, and stone composition. There {{were no significant differences}} in surgery duration (101 ± 28 vs. 98 ± 30 min; P = 0. 906), transfusion rate (3. 9 % vs. 4. 3 %; P = 0. 382), and hemoglobin drop (0. 9 ± 0. 9 vs. 1 ± 0. 7 g/dl; P = 0. 424) for Amplatz and MTD PCNL, respectively. Stone-free rate (86 % vs. 68 %; P = 0. 001) was significantly higher while residual fragments rate (37 % vs. 60 %; P = 0. 001) was significantly lower in Amplatz PCNL compared to MTD PCNL. However, tube stay time (4. 4 ± 1. 8 vs. 5. 8 ± 3. 6 days; P = 0. 005) and hospital time (8. 6 ± 2. 6 vs. 9. 7 ± 5. 5 days; P = 0. 0001) were significantly longer in Amplatz PCNL compared to MTD PCNL.

Database and medical records of VLBW infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) between January 1990 and December 1995 at Scott & White Clinic, Temple, Texas, were reviewed. Five hundred twenty-seven infants were admitted to the NICU, excluding 5 infants that were transferred out for possible cardiac surgery or for other reasons. Fifty one (9. 7 %) of these infants died prior to discharge. Hence, data from 476 survivors were reviewed for red blood cell (RBC) transfusions. Transfusions were given at the discretion of the attending neonatologist. None of the infants received erythropoietin. Of the 476 infants, 289 (61 %) received RBC transfusions during the hospital stay, with 2. 7 +/- 3. 6 transfusions per infant with a volume of 40. 5 +/- 50. 4 mL/kg. Smaller infants required significantly more transfusions compared to larger infants when divided into 250 -g subgroups. No statistically significant difference was noted in the number of RBC transfusions per infant or number of infants transfused during the 6 -year period from year to year. We conclude that VLBW infants in the 1990 s postsurfactant era required 2. 7 RBC transfusions per infant, on average, with the smallest infants requiring the most transfusions. These data will be helpful to counsel mothers in preterm labor regarding the need of transfusions for each birth weight category. Red cell transfusion practice has not changed over this 6 -year period in the 1990 s. Additional measures such as erythropoietin or even stricter transfusion criteria may be necessary to decrease <b>transfusions</b> further. However, <b>safety</b> of such measures should be carefully evaluated...|$|R

NHSN enables healthcare facilities {{to collect and}} use data about healthcare-associated infections, adherence to clinical practices known to prevent healthcare-associated infections, the incidence or prevalence of multidrug-resistant organisms within their organizations, trends and coverage of healthcare personnel safety and vaccination, and adverse events related to the transfusion of blood and blood products. Some U. S. states utilize NHSN {{as a means for}} healthcare facilities to submit data on healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) mandated through their specific state legislation. The NHSN includes four components, each concerned with various aspects of control and prevention of HAIs. Those four components are Patient Safety, Healthcare Personnel Safety, Biovigilance, and Research and Development. NHSN users do not use the Research and Development Component of the system. NHSN users do however, access and participate in the Patient Safety, Healthcare Personnel Safety, and Biovigilance Components of NHSN. A facility (acute care hospital, ambulatory surgery center, outpatient dialysis center) may use one, two, or all three NHSN components concurrently. The Biovigilance Component of NHSN was developed in collaboration with the transfusion and transplant communities. Biovigilance includes the collection of adverse event data to improve outcomes in the use of blood products, organs, tissues, and cellular therapies. The Hemovigilance Module is the first module of the Biovigilance Component to be developed in NHSN. This module is designed for staff in healthcare facility transfusion services to track adverse events, including recipient adverse reactions and quality control incidents, related to blood <b>transfusion.</b> National Healthcare <b>Safety</b> Network (NHSN) [...] Biovigilance component [...] Using the NHSN Hemovigilance module [...] Appendix A.

40|$|Interim CDC Zika Response Plan (CONUS and Hawaii) Overview: Initial Response to Zika Virus Infections: The {{purpose of}} this {{document}} is to describe the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) response plan for the first locally acquired cases of Zika virus infection in the continental United States and Hawaii. The Zika virus is spread to people primarily through the bite of an infected Aedes aegypti or Aedes albopictus mosquito. The response activities outlined in this plan are based on currently available knowledge about Zika virus and its transmission, and these activities may change as more is learned about Zika virus infection. Most of the plan focuses on response activities that would occur after locally acquired Zika virus transmission has been identified. CDC also is committed to responding to travel- associated and sexually transmitted Zika virus infections reported in the United States (US) before detection of the first locally transmitted case of Zika virus infection. Planning Assumptions: Travel-associated and sexually transmitted Zika virus infections will continue to occur. CDC anticipates that local summer transmission may occur in limited areas of the continental United States (CONUS) and Hawaii where competent mosquito vectors exist. 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Because {{of the risk of}} transmission of Zika virus infection through blood <b>transfusions,</b> blood <b>safety</b> interventions are needed for both unaffected and affected areas. With the recent outbreaks in the Americas, the number of Zika virus infections among travelers visiting or returning to the United States is likely to increase. 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Local transmission of Zika virus in US territories and affiliated Pacific Island countries is ongoing. 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Neither vaccines nor proven clinical treatments are expected to be available to treat or prevent Zika virus infections before local transmission begins within CONUS or Hawaii. 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 The efficacy of vector control in reducing mosquito-borne infection risks may be limited, as has been the case with similar mosquito-borne viruses, such as dengue and chikungunya. CDC supports state and local efforts to prepare and respond to Zika virus. CDC guidance to state and local jurisdictions recommends that Zika action plans be developed to guide response activities through a phased, risk-based continuum. The continuum includes support for mosquito season preparedness and then graduated action in response to detection of: 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 The first limited local transmission 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Widespread local and continuous transmission 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Widespread, multicounty, continuous transmissionCDC and partners will support and assist states in the key activity areas listed below as different stages in this continuum are reached.
