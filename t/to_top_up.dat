5|$|On 1 February 1941, Admiral Hipper {{embarked}} on her second Atlantic sortie. The Kriegsmarine had initially sought {{to send the}} battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau to operate in concert with Admiral Hipper, but Gneisenau suffered storm damage in December that prevented {{the participation of the}} two ships. Repairs were effected quickly, however, and the two battleships broke out into the Atlantic in early February. Admiral Hipper rendezvoused with a tanker off the Azores <b>to</b> <b>top</b> <b>up</b> her fuel tanks. On 11 February, the ship encountered and sank an isolated transport from convoy HG 53, which had been dispersed by U-boat and Luftwaffe attacks. That evening, she picked up the unescorted convoy SLS 64, which contained nineteen merchant ships. The following morning, Admiral Hipper closed in and sank several of the ships. The British reported only seven ships were lost, totaling , along with damage to two more. The Germans claimed Admiral Hipper had sunk thirteen of the nineteen freighters, while some survivors reported fourteen ships of the convoy were sunk.|$|E

25|$|While Prinz Eugen was refuelled, Lütjens {{declined}} <b>to</b> <b>top</b> <b>up</b> the Bismarck. A rupture {{in one of}} {{the fuel}} lines had allowed only an initial influx of 6,000 tons. A further 2,000 tons was to be accepted at sea. The ship had left the Baltic 200 tons short, and had since burned 1,000 tons reaching Norway. Lütjens knew that the German tanker Weissenberg was waiting for him in the Arctic, only an additional day's sailing away, but farther from prying British eyes. It was perhaps his intention to replenish there. In the event he did not refuel during the operation.|$|E

The water was used <b>to</b> <b>top</b> <b>up</b> the canal as water was lost {{at the bottom}} end of the canal. Initially, water {{was to have been}} taken from the River Irwell, however local mill owners objected citing a loss of water for their mills so the reservoir was constructed.

25|$|Domestic {{immersion}} heaters, usually {{rated at}} 3 kilowatts {{and on a}} 1.5-inch British Standard Pipe screwplug in the UK, run on the normal domestic electricity supply, but users may also {{take advantage of a}} cheaper, off-peak electricity tariff such as Economy 7 (in the UK). In a typical off-peak installation, a lower immersion heater is connected to the separately switched off-peak heating circuit and an upper heater is connected to the normal circuit via its own switch. The consumer then has the option <b>to</b> <b>top</b> <b>up</b> the available hot water supply at any time, rather than waiting for the cheaper supply to turn on (typically after midnight). A poorly insulated hot water cylinder will increase running costs because a consumer must pay for electricity used to replace lost heat.|$|E

The vehicles were supplied in March 1974 as right-hand drive chassis, with the bodywork assembled in Scotts Valley, California and this model was officially the HSV3. The main issue encountered was that the battery liquid dried up rapidly in the hotter conditions of California. Initially, each cell had <b>to</b> be <b>topped</b> <b>up</b> individually, but Chloride batteries developed a reservoir system, which allowed all the cells <b>to</b> be <b>topped</b> <b>up</b> from a single fill, significantly reducing the time spent on maintenance.|$|R

2500|$|Although {{theoretically}} trimix can be {{blended with}} almost {{any combination of}} helium and oxygen, a number of [...] "standard" [...] mixes have evolved (such as 21/35, 18/45 and 15/55—see Naming conventions). [...] Most of these mixes originated from filling the cylinders with {{a certain percentage of}} helium, and then topping the mix with 32% enriched air nitrox. [...] The [...] "standard" [...] mixes evolved because of three coinciding factors—the desire to keep that equivalent narcotic depth (END) of the mix at approximately , the requirement to keep the partial pressure of oxygen at 1.4 ATA or below at the deepest point of the dive, and the fact that many dive shops stored standard 32% enriched air nitrox in banks, which simplified mixing. [...] The use of standard mixes makes it relatively easy <b>to</b> <b>top</b> <b>up</b> diving cylinders after a dive using residual mix — only helium and banked nitrox are needed <b>to</b> <b>top</b> <b>up</b> the residual gas from the last fill.|$|E

2500|$|Leiweke in {{the past}} had said that even without an {{expansion}} the stadium needed $30 million in repairs, and that the original agreement called {{for the city and}} MLSE to split that bill equally. [...] Instead, MLSE looked for $10 million in public funding from each of the municipal, provincial, and federal governments <b>to</b> <b>top</b> <b>up</b> their $90 million contribution, plus any cost overruns, for the expansion. [...] MLSE argued that the new stadium would result in $8 million in economic benefits, including taxes, accruing to the province annually, and $18 million in taxes on the construction project. [...] The company has agreed to pay a fixed annual rental fee of $865,000 to the City for the upgraded stadium, rather than the variable revenue sharing model under the present agreement which returned an average of $397,000 to the city over the previous five years, to help ensure that the city recoups its investment. [...] The new arrangement guaranteed the city $25.4 million, and with the projected $6 million in parking revenues the $31 million in revenue over the term of the lease would be $19 million more than under the former agreement. [...] As manager of the stadium, MLSE gets any profit turned by the stadium, and is responsible for any losses. [...] MLSE's management and naming rights agreement for the stadium, which was set to expire in 2027, were extended by 10 years under the proposal. [...] The agreement requires MLSE to reach a [...] "long-term use (i.e. 20 years)" [...] lease with the Argos for usage of the stadium starting in 2015. [...] The proposed renovations were unanimously approved by the Board of Governors of Exhibition Place on March 7, and the City of Toronto's Executive Committee gave their consent on March 19. [...] The full City Council approved the deal on April 3, and the agreement is planned to be finalized by June 15. [...] The Provincial Minister of Tourism and Culture Michael Chan said that MLSE has submitted a funding request that that [...] "we are looking at it", while the Federal Infrastructure Minister Denis Lebel's spokesperson said that [...] "the federal government has no program to fund professional sports facilities". [...] A spokesperson for Lebel would later say [...] "our government will not fund the BMO Field {{as long as it is}} used by a professional sports team". [...] However, according to Leiweke, the federal funding [...] "is not going to the stadium, their money is going to host big events." [...] In another interview he said [...] "the feds are giving us the resources to (temporarily) expand to 40,000 for our Grey Cup bids and Winter Classic bids".|$|E
