2500|$|Wilson gave a poor {{account of}} {{himself at the}} Committee of Imperial Defence meeting after the Agadir Crisis, at which {{he said that in}} the event of war the Navy planned to land the Army on the Baltic Coast, an old plan of the {{recently}} retired Admiral Fisher, apparently derived from the Seven Years' War of the mid eighteenth century. Reginald McKenna (First Lord of the Admiralty) supported Admiral Wilson, but <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> <b>Secretary</b> Maurice Hankey pointed out that the Army must draw up such plans and that the Army plans had already been approved by the CID. Field Marshal Nicholson, (Chief of the Imperial General Staff), asked Admiral Wilson whether the Admiralty had maps of German strategic railways (to show how the Germans could rush reinforcements to invasion spots), and when Wilson said it was not the Admiralty's business to have such maps, Nicholson openly rebuked him and said that if the Navy [...] "meddled" [...] in military matters they needed not just to have such maps but to have studied them. The meeting was carried by a lucid presentation by Brigadier-General Henry Wilson, and Prime Minister H. H. Asquith (who thought the Royal Navy plan [...] "puerile and wholly impracticable") ordered the Navy to fall in with the Army's plans to deploy an Expeditionary Force to France. After the meeting Churchill was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty and began setting up a Naval Staff (Admiral Fisher having been opposed to setting one up), whilst Hankey began to draw up the War Book detailing mobilisation plans.|$|E

'I was a-standing starin' {{in at the}} pictur shop down at our place, when I sees a little bill about it; [...] "tickets half-a-crown. All {{applications}} {{to be made to}} <b>the</b> <b>committee.</b> <b>Secretary,</b> Mrs. Weller"; and when I got home there was the committee a-sittin' in our back parlour. Fourteen women; I wish you could ha' heard 'em, Sammy. There they was, a-passin' resolutions, and wotin' supplies, and all sorts o' games. Well, what with your mother-in-law a-worrying me to go, and what with my looking for'ard to seein' some queer starts if I did, I put my name down for a ticket; at six o'clock on the Friday evenin' I dresses myself out wery smart, and off I goes with the old 'ooman, and up we walks into a fust-floor where there was tea-things for thirty, and a whole lot o' women as begins whisperin' to one another, and lookin' at me, as if they'd never seen a rayther stout gen'l'm'n of eight-and-fifty afore. By and by, there comes a great bustle downstairs, and a lanky chap with a red nose and a white neckcloth rushes up, and sings out, [...] "Here's the shepherd a-coming to wisit his faithful flock;" [...] and in comes a fat chap in black, vith a great white face, a-smilin' avay like clockwork. Such goin's on, Sammy! [...] "The kiss of peace," [...] says the shepherd; and then he kissed the women all round, and ven he'd done, the man vith the red nose began. I was just a-thinkin' whether I hadn't better begin too--'specially as there was a wery nice lady a-sittin' next me--ven in comes the tea, and your mother-in-law, as had been makin' the kettle bile downstairs. At it they went, tooth and nail. Such a precious loud hymn, Sammy, while the tea was a brewing; such a grace, such eatin' and drinkin'! I wish you could ha' seen the shepherd walkin' into the ham and muffins. I never see such a chap to eat and drink--never. The red-nosed man warn't by no means the sort of person you'd like to grub by contract, but he was nothin' to the shepherd. Well; arter the tea was over, they sang another hymn, and then the shepherd began to preach: and wery well he did it, considerin' how heavy them muffins must have lied on his chest. Presently he pulls up, all of a sudden, and hollers out, [...] "Where is the sinner; where is the mis'rable sinner?" [...] Upon which, all the women looked at me, and began to groan as if they was a-dying. I thought it was rather sing'ler, but howsoever, I says nothing. Presently he pulls up again, and lookin' wery hard at me, says, [...] "Where is the sinner; where is the mis'rable sinner?" [...] and all the women groans again, ten times louder than afore. I got rather savage at this, so I takes a step or two for'ard and says, [...] "My friend," [...] says I, [...] "did you apply that 'ere obserwation to me?" [...] 'Stead of beggin' my pardon as any gen'l'm'n would ha' done, he got more abusive than ever:--called me a wessel, Sammy--a wessel of wrath--and all sorts o' names. So my blood being reg'larly up, I first gave him two or three for himself, and then two or three more to hand over to the man with the red nose, and walked off. I wish you could ha' heard how the women screamed, Sammy, ven they picked up the shepherd from underneath the table--Hollo! here's the governor, the size of life.' ...|$|E
