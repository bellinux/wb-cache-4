5|$|All such {{episodes of}} severe drought {{correlate}} with El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. El Niño-related droughts {{have also been}} implicated in periodic declines in Indian agricultural output. Nevertheless, ENSO events that have coincided with abnormally high sea surfaces <b>temperatures</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Indian Ocean—in one instance during 1997 and 1998 by up to —have resulted in increased oceanic evaporation, resulting in unusually wet weather across India. Such anomalies have occurred during a sustained warm spell {{that began in the}} 1990s. A contrasting phenomenon is that, instead of the usual high pressure air mass over the southern Indian Ocean, an ENSO-related oceanic low pressure convergence centre forms; it then continually pulls dry air from Central Asia, desiccating India during what should have been the humid summer monsoon season. This reversed air flow causes India's droughts. The extent that an ENSO event raises sea surface <b>temperatures</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> central Pacific Ocean influences the extent of drought.|$|E

30|$|The model {{predictions}} {{were close to}} the observed temperatures. On both study dates, the average difference between the modelled and observed temperature was 0.6  °C. The average percentage model error (all depths pooled) was 4.0 % on 1 August and 3.7 % on 22 August. The aerator had a clear effect on water <b>temperature</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hypolimnion. On 1 August, when the aeration had been functioning for 3  days, <b>temperature</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hypolimnion was 11.1 – 12.5  °C. On 22 August, when the aerator had been functioning for 15  days, <b>temperature</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hypolimnion was 14.8 – 15.3  °C.

5|$|Great mullein is a {{biennial}} {{and generally}} requires winter dormancy {{before it can}} flower. This dormancy is linked to starch degradation activated by low <b>temperatures</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> root, and gibberellin application bypasses this requirement. Seeds germinate almost solely in bare soil, at temperatures between 10°C and 40°C. While they can germinate in total darkness if proper conditions are present (tests give a 35% germination rate under ideal conditions), in the wild, they in practice only do so when exposed to light, or {{very close to the}} soil surface, which explains the plant's habitat preferences. While it can also grow in areas where some vegetation already exists, growth of the rosettes on bare soil is four to seven times more rapid.|$|E

5|$|In the gas phase, and at {{very low}} <b>temperatures</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{condensed}} phase, the alkali metals form covalently bonded diatomic molecules. The metal–metal bond lengths in these M2 molecules increase down the group from Li2 to Cs2, but then decrease after that to Uue2, due to the aforementioned relativistic effects that stabilize the 8s orbital. The opposite trend is shown for the metal–metal bond-dissociation energies. The Uue–Uue bond should be slightly stronger than the K–K bond. From these M2 dissociation energies, the enthalpy of sublimation (ΔHsub) of ununennium is predicted to be 94kJ·mol−1 (the value for francium should be around 77kJ·mol−1).|$|E
5|$|On August28, a {{large area}} of {{convection}} persisted about 1,035km (645mi) east of Guam. Located within an area of moderate wind shear, the system quickly organized while moving westward, its track influenced by a ridge to the north. At 00:00UTC on August29, a tropical depression formed from the system, classified by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) as Tropical Depression 14W. In initial forecasts, the agency anticipated steady strengthening, due to warm sea surface <b>temperatures</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area. At 12:00UTC on August29, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded it to a tropical storm. As such, the JMA named the storm Nabi. About 12hours later, the JMA upgraded Nabi further to a severe tropical storm, after the convection organized into spiral rainbands. At 18:00UTC, Nabi intensified to typhoon status, reaching ten-minute sustained winds of 120km/h (75mph).|$|E
5|$|Radiolaria {{have left}} a {{geological}} record {{since at least the}} Ordovician times, and their mineral fossil skeletons can be tracked across the K–Pg boundary. There is no evidence of mass extinction of these organisms, and there is support for high productivity of these species in southern high latitudes as a result of cooling <b>temperatures</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early Paleocene. Approximately 46% of diatom species survived the transition from the Cretaceous to the Upper Paleocene.

40|$|Sea surface {{temperature}} {{plays an important}} role in air-sea interactions. This research was conducted to understand seasonal and interannual variations of sea surface <b>temperature</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Indonesian waters. <b>The</b> data used <b>in</b> this research was daily sea surface <b>temperature</b> <b>in</b> 1986 to 2015 which was obtained from the Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center - National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Method used in this study was the anomaly analysis. The result showed that the seasonal and interannual variations of sea surface <b>temperature</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Indonesian waters varied. Seasonal variations of SST <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Makasar Strait, Sulawesi Sea, and Halmahera Sea were low. High seasonal variations of sea surface <b>temperature</b> occurred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southern waters of Java, Timor Sea, Arafura Sea, and Banda Sea, which were allegedly due to <b>the</b> upwelling process. <b>In</b> addition, interannual variation of sea surface <b>temperature</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Indonesian waters fluctuated.
