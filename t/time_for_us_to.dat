500|$|In 2015, Ono {{created the}} piece Arising in Venice, Italy. As {{part of the}} {{exhibition}} Personal Structures, organised by Global Art Affairs, the installation was on view from June 1 through November 24, 2013, at the European Cultural Centre's Palazzo Bembo. In this feminist work of art, female silicon bodies were burnt in the Venetian lagoon, evoking the imagary of mythical phoenixes. When asked for the resemblance between the naming of her record Rising and this piece, Ono responded: [...] "Rising was telling all people that it is <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> rise and fight for our rights. But {{in the process of}} fighting together, women are still being treated separately in an inhuman way. It weakens the power of men and women all together. I hope Arising will wake up Women Power, and make us, men and women, heal together." ...|$|E
500|$|Melua's seventh album, In Winter, was {{released}} on 14 October 2016. For this record, Melua {{went back to her}} native Georgia to record an album with the Gori Women's Choir, a native Georgian all-woman singing troupe. Melua revealed during an interview with The Guardian that her partnership with Mike Batt had come to an end after her last album, as it was a six-album deal with Batt's Dramatico records. [...] "It was a six-album deal,” she explains, “so when the sixth one was done, you know – it was finished and it was <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> part ways.....It was maybe a bit more mutual on one side than the other. Yeah – it wasn’t easy, as you can imagine. And I'm still incredibly proud of the work we did together. But it had to happen and I think it has been mutual ... um, eventually." ...|$|E
500|$|Walsingham {{was driven}} by Protestant zeal to counter Catholicism, and sanctioned the use of torture against Catholic priests and {{suspected}} conspirators. Edmund Campion was among those tortured and found guilty {{on the basis of}} extracted evidence; he was hanged, drawn and quartered at Tyburn in 1581. Walsingham could never forget the atrocities against Protestants he had witnessed in France during the Bartholomew's Day massacre and believed a similar slaughter would occur in England {{in the event of a}} Catholic resurgence. Walsingham's brother-in-law Robert Beale, who was in Paris with Walsingham at the time of the massacre, encapsulated Walsingham's view: [...] "I think it time and more than <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> awake out of our dead sleep, and take heed lest like mischief as has already overwhelmed the brethren and neighbours in France and Flanders embrace us which be left in such sort as we shall not be able to escape." [...] Walsingham tracked down Catholic priests in England and supposed conspirators by employing informers, and intercepting correspondence. Walsingham's staff in England included the cryptographer Thomas Phelippes, who was an expert in deciphering letters and forgery, and Arthur Gregory, who was skilled at breaking and repairing seals without detection.|$|E

500|$|For Wasting Light, Grohl {{stated that}} they {{would go back to}} a rawer and heavier sound after [...] "exploring new musical ground" [...] on the {{previous}} records, adding that [...] "with the last album we were too concerned with being musical, now it's <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> be a rock band again". To contrast with the [...] "seven or eight minute-long songs, with seven or eight sections, and two or three time changes" [...] Grohl played with Them Crooked Vultures, he instead tried to compose the [...] "tightest, catchiest four-and-a-half-minute 'softball bat to your face' songs". Hawkins added that he liked Wasting Light for being [...] "straightforward, and that’s a good thing for us right now. The last couple [...] had some big dynamic changes." [...] Grohl described the effort as their heaviest yet, later saying it was done because [...] "I'm 42 now. I don't know if I'm {{going to be able to}} make this record when I'm 46 or 49. It's my last chance." [...] While the demos that prompted Grohl to say the album would be their heaviest yet were not used on the album, Vig took the declarations to heart, following three criteria while recording: [...] "It's got to be hooky, heavy, and we're going analog all the way." ...|$|E
500|$|The band took a {{break from}} {{performing}} live between the NetAid charity concert in October 1999 and 2001. They returned to {{the stage for a}} further charity gig on 28 April, in support of Unison's campaign for a living wage at the Manchester Evening News Arena. Matthews said prior to the performance that [...] "It's a cause I think's really important and it just seemed to be the right <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> come back – it's a long, long time since we played live. It should be really great. We're really looking forward to what they (the new songs) are going to sound like live. It'll be good {{to get back on the}} old live circuit again." [...] They played several tracks from their upcoming album, at that point entitled It's What's Not There That Makes What's There What It Is. By May, it had been renamed to Paper Scissors Stone. Matthews was looking forward to the new releasing, explaining to NME that [...] "I think it's stronger than the last album, a bit more avant garde!...It's a bit less stupid. [...] was all over the shop stylistically, I think it's a bit more focused. And I think it's a bit more impassioned".|$|E
500|$|Dan Shaughnessy of The Boston Globe {{said that}} [...] "Bally's in Las Vegas set the Red Sox as 8–5 {{favorites}} {{to win the}} Series" [...] {{and that there was}} [...] "some sentiment in St. Louis that the NL champions have been disrespected." [...] but also that Red Sox General Manager Theo Epstein [...] "Did not want to dis the Cardinals." [...] Shaughnessy also quoted Schilling as having said: [...] "There's a lot of good players in that [...] clubhouse over there. This isn't the <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> be thinking about history. If we get three wins and 26 outs into the fourth win, I'm pretty sure it will hit us." [...] Before the series began, Shaughnessy wrote a piece saying that although the Red Sox had beaten the Yankees, the series needed to be won, as {{it was the only way}} the Curse of the Bambino, which he had publicized based on the book of the same title in 1990, would end, and demeaning chants of [...] "1918!" [...] would no longer echo at Yankee Stadium. During the series, he wrote a piece about how much people in New England were thinking about loved ones who had spent their entire lives rooting for the Red Sox, hoping that one day, they would see their Red Sox win a World Series.|$|E
6000|$|... "Just so," [...] remarked MacSweenie, with a {{thoughtful}} air; [...] "so, as I agree wi' you both, I think it iss about <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> all <b>to</b> turn in." ...|$|R

500|$|In mid-2010, {{the entire}} group were in Los Angeles for a birthday, where Manson {{suggested}} they book a studio and spend time writing. Along with Garbage's long time engineer and Manson's husband Billy Bush, the band, as Bush described, [...] "hung out for a couple weeks, drank some wine and played a bunch of music”. Three or four song ideas came together during this time. [...] "But we didn't go right into making-a-record mode", Erikson recalled. [...] "It took a bit of <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> realize {{that we were going}} to make an album." [...] Erikson described reconvening as a piecemeal process, saying that it informally began with the first phone conversations among them since their hiatus, as they discussed playing together again. After convening, and composing and performing song ideas together through multiple sessions, they then decided to move forward with the band and embark on a full-length album. The project took off in February 2011, when Manson called Vig proposing to reunite the band and try making a new record. Manson convoked the group out of an eagerness [...] "to make loud music again". [...] "I'm a loud person", she proclaimed; [...] "I love noise and aggression. I crave contact. I needed to make that connection again. I think we all did. To get something back up when there was absolutely no momentum took a Herculean effort on everybody's part. It's like pulling yourself out of mud. Even to stand back up and say 'we're going to take another swing at this' was a scary feeling, and I'm proud of us for trying. It's much easier to stay at home.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Barron {{expressed}} resentment {{towards the}} Democratic Party, saying {{it had taken}} African-Americans for granted: [...] "It's <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> be for us. It's <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> be a self-determining people." [...] Barron aimed to get 50,000 votes in the governor's race, enough to gain ballot access for the party, but ended up with 24,560 votes out of over 3,000,000 cast. More than 75% of the votes cast for Barron originated in New York City.|$|E
2500|$|After six albums {{that spanned}} Petra's highest peak {{and ended with}} the band in its lowest valley to date, the band and its label parted ways. [...] "Their {{interests}} were starting to go in other directions, so it was <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> leave and find a label that's interested in rebuilding {{the fact that we}} still exist," [...] Schlitt said.|$|E

2500|$|Soon {{after the}} Republican {{victory in the}} 2012 Wisconsin gubernatorial recall election, Romney criticized Obama's {{stimulus}} policy, saying that Obama [...] "wants another stimulus, he wants to hire more government workers. He says we need more fireman, more policeman, more teachers. Did he not get the message of Wisconsin? The American people did. It's <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> cut back on government and help the American people." ...|$|E
2500|$|National police {{commissioner}} Mangwashi Victoria Phiyega, a former {{social worker who}} was appointed on 13 June, stated police had acted in self-defense, saying, [...] "This {{is no time for}} blaming, this is no time for finger-pointing. It is a <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> mourn." [...] Phiyega presented aerial photography of the events which she claimed demonstrated that the strikers had advanced on the 500 strong police force before they had opened fire.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{song on the}} album, [...] "Let God Be God", {{was written}} by Dan Dean in {{response}} to global instability. Dean stated that [...] "This is the perfect <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> say, Don't panic. God is in control. Jesus asks in Luke 12:25: Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life?" [...] One of the edgier songs the band has recorded, the song even has a James Brown scream, which Dean originally recorded to be funny, but it eventually stuck.|$|E

2500|$|On the 5 December 2013 a {{statement}} on the official Grinspoon website announced that the band would be going on hiatus. A section of the statement reads: [...] "Thanks to all our families, friends, and especially our fans for the support over the last 18 years – it's been a wild ride to say the least. We are still a band of brothers but it's <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> {{take a break and}} recharge the batteries.

2500|$|On February 24, 2010, President Barack Obama {{nominated}} Liu to fill {{a vacancy}} on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. For more than a year, Liu's nomination languished, amid significant opposition from Republicans in the U.S. Senate. On May 19, 2011, the Senate rejected cloture on Liu's nomination in a 52–43 vote, and on May 25, 2011, Liu informed President Obama that he was withdrawing his name from consideration to the seat on the Ninth Circuit, telling the president that [...] "With no possibility of an up-or-down vote on the horizon, my family and I have decided that it is <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> regain {{the ability to make}} plans for the future." ...|$|E
2500|$|Romney {{argued that}} tax {{policy should be}} used to promote energy conservation. When his {{lieutenant}} governor supported a temporary suspension of the state gasoline tax to provide consumers some relief during a period of especially high gasoline prices in 2006, Romney rejected the proposal, arguing that maintaining the tax would help encourage energy conservation: “I don’t think that now is the time, and I’m not sure there will be the right <b>time,</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> encourage the use of more gasoline.... I am very much in favor of people recognizing that these high gasoline prices are probably here to stay and that the appropriate action for us to take is to find ways to find fuel conservation.” ...|$|E

[...] He criticizes the Iraq war for creating more critics than allies and helping recruit more terrorists. He also is a cautious but optimistic supporter of the deal with Iran. Lessig does not support the commitment of ground troops to Syria but instead suggests working with allies to create safe zones for refugees. He supports a similar policy in the fight against ISIS. Another important issue for Lessig is long-term relations with China. He states that it is <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> treat China as equals, working on problems such as climate change together.|$|E
