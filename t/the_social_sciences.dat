5|$|A {{fundamental}} {{influence on}} Durkheim's {{thought was the}} sociological positivism of Auguste Comte, who effectively sought to extend and apply the scientific method found in the natural sciences to <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>sciences.</b> According to Comte, a true social science should stress for empirical facts, as well as induce general scientific laws from the relationship among these facts. There were many points on which Durkheim agreed with the positivist thesis. First, he accepted {{that the study of}} society was to be founded on an examination of facts. Second, like Comte, he acknowledged that the only valid guide to objective knowledge was the scientific method. Third, he agreed with Comte that <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>sciences</b> could become scientific only when they were stripped of their metaphysical abstractions and philosophical speculation. At the same time, Durkheim believed that Comte was still too philosophical in his outlook.|$|E

5|$|The {{full-time}} undergraduate programs {{comprise the}} majority of the school's enrolment, made up of 16,339 full-time undergraduate students. In 2009 the two largest programs by enrolment were <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>sciences,</b> with 3,286 full-time and part-time students, followed by engineering, with 3,097 full-time and part-time students. The university conferred 3,232 bachelor's degrees, 153 doctoral degrees, 1,142 master's degrees, and 721 first professional degrees in 2008–2009.|$|E
5|$|The {{philosophy}} {{of social science}} {{is the study of}} the logic and method of <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>sciences,</b> such as sociology, anthropology, and political science. Philosophers of social science are concerned with the differences and similarities between the social and the natural sciences, causal relationships between social phenomena, the possible existence of social laws, and the ontological significance of structure and agency.|$|E

5|$|Colleges {{arrange the}} {{tutorial}} teaching for their undergraduates, {{and the members}} of an academic department are spread around many colleges. Though certain colleges do have subject alignments (e.g., Nuffield College as a centre for <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>sciences),</b> these are exceptions, and most colleges will have a broad mix of academics and students from a diverse range of subjects. Facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels: by the central university (the Bodleian), by the departments (individual departmental libraries, such as the English Faculty Library), and by colleges (each of which maintains a multi-discipline library for the use of its members).|$|E

The Rhondda has also produced J. Gwyn Griffiths, an eminent Egyptologist, who was also a member of the Cadwgan Circle. Griffiths and his wife Käte Bosse-Griffiths were influential writers and curators in the history of Egyptian lore.|$|E
5|$|Innis {{laid the}} basis for {{scholarship}} that looked at <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>sciences</b> from a distinctly Canadian point of view. As {{the head of the}} University of Toronto's political economy department, he worked to build up a cadre of Canadian scholars so that universities would not continue to rely as heavily on British or American-trained professors unfamiliar with Canada's history and culture. He was successful in establishing sources of financing for Canadian scholarly research.|$|E
40|$|In the {{structure}} of the competency-based curriculum for junior secondary school (SMP/MTs), <b>Social</b> <b>Science</b> is offerred to grade VII, VIII, and IX, covering Economics, Geography, and History. This indicates that an interdisciplinary approach needs to be implemented. In <b>the</b> 1994 curriculum, <b>social</b> <b>science</b> was taught by a team of teachers, with each still focusing on their own specialization. In contrast, in <b>the</b> competency-based curriculum, <b>social</b> <b>science</b> should be really team taught, with a group of teachers teaching together. Therefore, to make the teaching and learning process run well, it is suggested that <b>social</b> <b>science</b> teachers be trained prior to the implementation of the competency-based curriculum in their classroom. The old approach is incompatible with <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>science</b> concept. In order to make the competence-based curriculum run well, especially in <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>science</b> course, it is necessary to organize trainings for <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>science</b> teachers...|$|R

5|$|Weber's most {{influential}} work was on economic sociology, political sociology, and {{the sociology of}} religion. Along with Karl Marx and Émile Durkheim, he is commonly {{regarded as one of}} the founders of modern sociology. But whereas Durkheim, following Comte, worked in the positivist tradition, Weber was instrumental in developing an antipositivist, hermeneutic, tradition in <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>sciences.</b> In this regard he belongs to a similar tradition as his German colleagues Werner Sombart, Georg Simmel, and Wilhelm Dilthey, who stressed the differences between the methodologies appropriate to the social and the natural sciences.|$|E
5|$|Weber's {{thinking}} was {{strongly influenced by}} German idealism and particularly by neo-Kantianism, {{to which he had}} been exposed through Heinrich Rickert, his professorial colleague at the University of Freiburg. Especially important to Weber's work is the neo-Kantian belief that reality is essentially chaotic and incomprehensible, with all rational order deriving from {{the way in which the}} human mind focuses its attention on certain aspects of reality and organises the resulting perceptions. Weber's opinions regarding the methodology of <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>sciences</b> show parallels with the work of contemporary neo-Kantian philosopher and pioneering sociologist Georg Simmel.|$|E
5|$|Never {{an ivory}} tower academic, Hirst held {{a number of}} {{influential}} appointments {{during the course of}} his career.

He wrote the official history of Australia for new citizens and took a prominent part in the history summit convened by Prime Minister John Howard in 2006. Hirst advised the Victorian Government on the school history curriculum and was history adviser to the National Curriculum Authority. He was elected to the Academy of <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Sciences</b> in Australia in 1986. A committed republican, Hirst was the Convenor of the Republican Movement in Victoria.|$|E

5|$|Since 1926, the University of Toronto {{has been}} a member of the Association of American Universities, a {{consortium}} of the leading North American research universities. The university manages by far the largest annual research budget of any university in Canada, with sponsored direct-cost expenditures of $878 million in 2010. The federal government was the largest source of funding, with grants from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council and <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Sciences</b> and Humanities Research Council amounting to about one-third of the research budget. About eight percent of research funding came from corporations, mostly in the healthcare industry.|$|E
5|$|Apart from a {{definition}} of leisure, there are other questions of theoretical concern to the sociologist of leisure. For example, quantifying the results is difficult, as time-budget studies have noted that a given amount of time (for example, an hour) may have different values, depending on when it occurs—within a day, a week, or a year. Finally, as with many other fields of inquiry in <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>sciences,</b> {{the study of the}} sociology of leisure is hampered by the lack of reliable data for comparative longitudinal studies, as there was little to no standardized data-gathering on leisure throughout most of human history. The lack of longitudinal studies has been remedied in the last few decades by recurring national surveys such as the General Household Survey in the United Kingdom (ongoing since 1971). In addition to surveys, an increasing number of studies have been focusing on qualitative methods of research (interviews).|$|E
