25|$|Another {{example is}} {{elemental}} tin (Sn), which is malleable near ambient temperatures but is brittle when cooled. This change in mechanical properties due to existence {{of its two}} major allotropes, α- and β-tin. The two allotropes that are encountered at normal pressure and temperature, α-tin and β-tin, are more commonly known as gray tin and white tin respectively. Two more allotropes, γ and σ, exist at temperatures above 161°C and pressures above several GPa. White tin is metallic, and is the stable crystalline form at or above room temperature. Below 13.2°C, tin exists in the gray form, which has a diamond cubic crystal structure, similar to diamond, silicon or germanium. Gray tin has no metallic properties at all, is a dull gray powdery material, and has few uses, other than a few specialized semiconductor applications. Although the α–β <b>transformation</b> <b>temperature</b> of tin is nominally 13.2°C, impurities (e.g. Al, Zn, etc.) lower the transition temperature well below 0°C, and upon addition of Sb or Bi the transformation may not occur at all.|$|E

40|$|The {{shape memory}} {{behavior}} in NiTi alloys can be exploited {{for a wide}} variety of applications that require active materials. The application dictates the <b>transformation</b> <b>temperatures</b> and hysteresis of the alloy. NiTi alloys with high Ni contents can be precipitation heat treated to produce large changes in the <b>transformation</b> <b>temperatures,</b> as well as increases in strength and dimensional stability. The effect of aging on the Ms temperature has been previously studied in the literature; however, few studies have investigated long duration aging, and little attention has been paid to the effect of precipitate formation on the thermal hysteresis. In the current work, a systematic study of heat treatments was performed to study the effect of aging time, aging temperature, and initial Ni composition on the <b>transformation</b> <b>temperatures</b> and the thermal hysteresis under zero stress conditions using differential scanning calorimetry. Heat treatments and NiTi compositions were chosen in order to ensure that only Ni 4 Ti 3 type precipitates formed during the aging process.

Thermo-mechanical testing in compression {{was used to}} evaluate the <b>transformation</b> <b>temperatures,</b> <b>transformation</b> strain, work output, and permanent deformation behavior of each alloy to study the effects of quaternary alloying and stoichiometry on high-temperature shape memory alloy behavior. Microstructural evaluation showed the presence of second phases for all alloy compositions.

When thermally cycled under constant stresses of up to 300 MPa, all of the alloys had transformation strains, and therefore work outputs, which increased with increasing stress. In each series of alloys, the transformation strain and thus work output was highest for stoichiometric or Ti-rich compositions while permanent strain associated with the constant-load thermal cycling was lowest for alloys with Ni-equivalent-rich compositions.

The DSC thermal analysis indicates that the cold compaction pressure has great effect on the subsequent <b>transformation</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Generally, the phase <b>transformation</b> <b>temperatures</b> of porous NiTi alloys with lower cold compaction pressure are higher than those compacted with higher pressure.
