5|$|The 1988 Dungeons & Dragons {{role-playing}} game module Ruins of Adventure {{was produced}} {{using the same}} adventure scenario as Pool of Radiance, using the same plot, background, setting, {{and many of the}} same characters as the computer game. The module thus contains useful clues <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>successful</b> completion of the computer missions. Ruins of Adventure contains four linked miniscenarios, which form the core of Pool of Radiance. According to the editors of Dragon magazine, Pool of Radiance was based on Ruins of Adventure, and not vice versa.|$|E

5|$|Whatever {{the exact}} {{course of events}} of the early 9th century, {{the failure of the}} Slavic attack on Patras {{consolidated}} the recently re-established Byzantine control over the Peloponnese, and Nikephoros I's policies led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>successful</b> re-Christianization and Hellenization of the peninsula. The defence of Patras also secured the Byzantine Empire's main maritime road of communication with Italy and the West, as it opened up the shorter route through the Corinthian Gulf, instead of the longer, more dangerous route around the Peloponnese that was exposed to Arab attacks.|$|E

5|$|Following {{its release}} and five {{successful}} singles, Stripped {{became one of}} Aguilera's strongest albums on charts. In the United States, the album became the tenth best-selling album of 2003, and Aguilera was ranked as the fifth most successful pop artist of the year. She also became the most successful pop female act throughout the year, with six chart entries. Likewise, Aguilera was the fourth most successful female musical act on the Billboard 200 chart, and the thirteenth overall. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>successful</b> single releases, the magazine ranked Aguilera as the second best-selling female singles artist on the Hot 100, only behind Beyoncé, and the Top Female Mainstream Top 40 act.|$|E
5|$|Growing up {{in eastern}} Sydney, Windle was trained by Frank Guthrie {{from the age}} of 12. Windle's first major {{swimming}} competition was the 1960 Australian Championships. Aged 15, his second-place finish in the 1650yd freestyle earned him a place on the team for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. However, the Australian coaches only took him along to gain experience and he did not compete. He won his first national title in 1961—the 1650yd freestyle—and claimed the 220–440–1650yd treble in 1962. Windle made his international debut at the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth, winning gold in the 4×220yd freestyle and silver and bronze in the 1650 and 440yd freestyle respectively. In 1963, he won four individual national titles, adding the 880yd event <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>successful</b> defence of his three titles. He won three individual titles in 1964 and proceeded to the Tokyo Olympics where he was eliminated in the heats of the 400m freestyle after attempting to save energy for the final. In response, Windle took an aggressive approach in the 1500m and set Olympic records in the heats and final to win gold. He added a bronze in the 4×100m freestyle relay.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, Bethe testified {{on behalf}} of J. Robert Oppenheimer during the Oppenheimer {{security}} hearing. Specifically, Bethe argued that Oppenheimer's stances against developing the hydrogen bomb in the late 1940s had not hindered its actual development, a topic which {{was seen as a}} key motivating factor behind the hearing. Bethe contended that the developments which led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>successful</b> Teller–Ulam design were a matter of serendipity and not a question of manpower or logical development of previously existing ideas. During the hearing, Bethe and his wife also tried hard to convince Edward Teller against testifying. However, Teller did not agree, and his testimony {{played a major role in}} the revocation of Oppenheimer's security clearance. While Bethe and Teller had been on very good terms during the prewar years, the conflict between them during the Manhattan Project, and especially during the Oppenheimer episode, permanently marred their relationship.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Hawker Siddeley {{considered}} {{modifying the}} airframe for a joint specification for an aircraft by the RAF and Royal Navy. Between 1961 and 1965 the two services harmonised their specifications to preserve design commonality. However, the RAF's desired configuration {{was to take}} precedence over that of the Royal Navy's. A number of proposals were submitted– at one stage, a twin-Spey design was considered, then rejected. Following the Labour government's coming to power the project was cancelled in 1965. The Royal Navy would acquire the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, while the RAF continued to foster development of the P.1127(RAF), leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>successful</b> Harrier Jump Jet family.|$|E
5|$|Operation Colossus was the codename {{given to}} the first {{airborne}} operation undertaken by the British military, which occurred on 10 February 1941 during World War II. The British airborne establishment was formed in June 1940 by {{the order of the}} British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, in response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>successful</b> airborne operations conducted by the German military during the Battle of France. Training began immediately, but a shortage of proper equipment and training facilities, as well as bureaucratic difficulties, meant that {{only a small number of}} volunteers could immediately be trained as parachute troops. The first airborne unit to be formed was actually a re-trained Commando unit, No. 2 Commando, which was subsequently renamed as No. 11 Special Air Service Battalion and numbered approximately 350 officers and other ranks by September 1940. The battalion finished its training in December 1940, and in February 1941 thirty-eight members of the battalion, known as X Troop, were selected to conduct an airborne operation, which was intended to test the capability of the airborne troops and their equipment, as well as the ability of the Royal Air Force to accurately deliver them.|$|E
5|$|The Brazilian Armed Forces {{were created}} in the {{aftermath}} of Independence. They were originally composed of Brazilian- and Portuguese-born officers and troops who had remained loyal to the government in Rio de Janeiro during the war of secession from Portugal. The Armed Forces were crucial <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>successful</b> outcomes of international conflicts faced by the Empire, starting with Independence (1822–1824), followed by the Cisplatine War (1825–1828), then the Platine War (1851–1852), the Uruguayan War (1864–1865) and, finally, the Paraguayan War (1864–1870). They also played a part in quelling rebellions, beginning with the Confederation of the Equator (1824) under PedroI, followed by the uprisings during PedroII's early reign, such as the Ragamuffin War (1835–1845), Cabanagem (1835–1840), Balaiada (1838–1841), among others.|$|E

5|$|The {{song was}} well {{received}} by contemporary critics, who noted {{the success of}} the Dragonette-production, in addition to reviewers who called it a good follow-up single to her debut due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>successful</b> pop themes and potential of the track. Commercially the track debuted at number 40 in both the UK Singles Chart and the Scottish Singles Chart. A music video directed by Stephen Agnes was released; the video was filmed in the East Village of New York City and presented Roberts walking down various streets in the city with special effects added to her movements. During the shoot, weather conditions made it uncomfortable for filming, although this was not reflected in critical opinion. The video's simplicity, as well as the dress she wore in the video, gained mixed responses from critics.|$|E
5|$|The {{understanding}} of thermodynamics was limited {{at the start}} of the 19th century, when it was believed that the key <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>successful</b> storage to ice was the construction of underground ice houses, where it was believed, incorrectly, that it would always be cool enough to store ice successfully. European ice houses were based on this theory, and used underground chambers, often built at considerable expense, to store the winter harvest. Some farmers in Virginia, however, had developed much cheaper icehouses, elevated off the ground, built from wood and insulated with hay. In addition to the temperature that ice was held at, there was also a need to efficiently drain off the melted water, as this water would further melt the remaining ice much faster than warm air would do.|$|E
5|$|In 1967 {{construction}} again commenced on {{yet another}} variation on Bradfield's design. This involved the earlier route used towards Bondi Junction through Woolloomooloo, then an extension towards Kingsford with five extra stations at Charing Cross, Frenchmans Road, Randwick, University and Kingsford. The New South Wales Government awarded the contract for the civil and structural design <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>successful</b> Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority. An official Legislative Assembly inquiry in 1976, however, recommended that costs on the project be cut, and the extension to Kingsford, a proposed station at Woollahra, {{and the expansion of}} concourse areas at Bondi Junction and Martin Place stations did not proceed. Nonetheless, it was resolved to fully integrate the railway with the Illawarra line. The Eastern Suburbs Railway opened between Central station and Bondi Junction on 23 June 1979. Initially trains ran as shuttle services between Central and Bondi Junction; it was not until a year later that work was finished to integrate the lines. A double-track junction with the Illawarra Line at Erskineville south of Illawarra Junction, twin single track tunnels connecting to the Eastern Suburbs Railway platforms at Central, a set of underground platforms at Redfern and a turnback tunnel at Martin Place opened to complete the project on 20 July 1980.|$|E

5|$|In October 2009, WWE premiered a new {{pay-per-view}} {{event based}} around inter-brand matches. At the time, The Miz was the second-tier champion on Raw {{after winning the}} United States Champion and was subsequently booked against SmackDowns Intercontinental Champion, John Morrison. In the build up to their first match since splitting, the two hosted a one-off edition of The Dirt Sheet on the October 16 episode of SmackDown where the two compared themselves to '80s tag team The Rockers, debating over which is more comparable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>successful</b> Shawn Michaels and which was the less successful Marty Jannetty. At Bragging Rights, Miz pinned Morrison to become {{the only member of}} the Raw roster to win an interpromotional match. The following month at Survivor Series, Miz captained a team of five wrestlers against Team Morrison in a five-on-five Survivor Series elimination match and once again bested his former partner. At the Tribute to the Troops in December, Miz rolled up Morrison for the win in a singles match. The two had another match the following March, when John Morrison and his new partner R-Truth challenged for the Unified Tag Team Championships held by The Miz and the Big Show. Morrison was finally able to defeat The Miz in a singles match, however Morrison could not pick up the victory for the titles at WrestleMania XXVI.|$|E
5|$|On 20 November 1992, a {{major fire}} {{occurred}} at Windsor Castle, lasting for 15 hours and causing widespread {{damage to the}} Upper Ward. The Private Chapel in the north-east corner of the State Apartments was being renovated {{as part of a}} long term programme of work within the castle, and it is believed that one of the spotlights being used in the work set fire to a curtain by the altar during the morning. The fire spread quickly and destroyed nine of the principal state rooms, and severely damaged more than 100 others. Fire-fighters applied water to contain the blaze, whilst castle staff attempted to rescue the precious artworks from the castle. Many of the rooms closest to the fire had been emptied as part of the renovation work, and this contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>successful</b> evacuation of most of the collection. The fire spread through the roof voids and efforts continued through the night to contain the blaze, at great risk to the 200 fire-fighters involved. It was not until late afternoon that the blaze began to come under control, although the fire continued during the night before being officially declared over the next morning. Along with the fire and smoke damage, one of the unintended effects of the fire-fighting was the considerable water damage to the castle; more than 1.5 million gallons of water were used to extinguish it, which in many ways caused more complex restoration problems than the fire.|$|E
5|$|On the August 17 {{episode of}} Raw, The Miz {{announced}} {{his intention to}} challenge for the United States Championship, and also debuted new ring attire and defeated Evan Bourne. He challenged for the United States Championship at the Night of Champions, Breaking Point and Hell in a Cell pay-per-views, but was unsuccessful. On the October 5 episode of Raw, the night after Hell in a Cell, The Miz received a rematch for the championship, and defeated Kofi Kingston to win the United States Championship and his first singles championship in WWE {{at the age of}} 28. The following pay-per-view event, Bragging Rights, was themed with interpromotional matches and now that The Miz was the second-tier champion on Raw he was booked against SmackDown's Intercontinental Champion, his erstwhile tag team partner John Morrison. In the buildup to their first match since splitting, the two hosted a one-off edition of The Dirt Sheet on the October 16 episode of SmackDown where the two compared themselves to '80s tag team The Rockers, debating over which is more comparable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>successful</b> Shawn Michaels and which was the less successful Marty Jannetty.
