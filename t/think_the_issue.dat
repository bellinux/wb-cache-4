500|$|Joel Brind, {{a faculty}} member at Baruch College in the Department of Natural Sciences, is the primary {{advocate}} of an abortionbreast cancer ("ABC") link. Brind is strongly anti-abortion and began lobbying politicians with the claim that abortion caused breast cancer in the early 1990s. Brind found that his lobbying efforts were not taken seriously because he had not published his findings in the peer-reviewed medical literature. He therefore collaborated with two anti-abortion physicians and a statistician to publish a 1996 article in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, arguing that induced abortion was a risk factor for breast cancer. The statistician who collaborated with Brind later stated of their findings: [...] "I have some doubts. I don't <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> has been resolved. When {{we were talking about the}} conclusions, he [...] wanted to make the strongest statements. I tried to temper them a little bit, but Dr. Brind is very adamant about his opinion." ...|$|E
500|$|After Rowan County clerk Kim Davis defied Judge David L. Bunning's {{order to}} issue {{marriage}} licenses to same-sex couples, Bevin commended her [...] "willingness {{to stand for}} her First Amendment rights". Davis was confined to the Carter County jail for six days on contempt of court charges for refusing to comply with Bunning's order. On September 8, 2015, Bevin met with Davis in the jail and later attended a rally organized by Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee celebrating her subsequent release. Following a September debate at Bellarmine University, Bevin said, [...] "My intention {{has always been to}} execute this race on financial issues, on economic issues. In the last several weeks, 85 percent of what people talk about are these social issues. ... I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> has redefined this race whether any of us candidates want {{that to be the case}} or not." [...] Associated Press reporter Adam Beam wrote that the Davis case [...] "ignited the passions of religious conservatives in an already conservative state", and University of Kentucky political science professor Stephen Voss opined that a campaign focused on cultural and social issues would be [...] "bad for Conway".|$|E
60|$|I do not <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> {{before the}} country was ever more simple than it is now. The money must be found; there is no dispute about that. Both parties are {{responsible}} for the expenditure and the obligations which render new revenue necessary; and, as we know, we have difficulty in resisting demands which are made upon us by the Conservative Party for expenditure upon armaments far beyond the limits which are necessary to maintain adequately the defences of the country, and which would only be the accompaniment of a sensational and aggressive policy in foreign and in Colonial affairs. We declare that the proposals we have put forward are conceived with a desire to be fair to all and harsh to none. We assert they are conceived with a desire to secure good laws regulating the conditions by which wealth may be obtained and a just distribution of the burdens of the State. We know that the proposals which we have made will yield all the money that we need for national defence, and that they will yield an expanding revenue in future years for those great schemes of social organisation, of national insurance, of agricultural development, and of the treatment of the problems of poverty and unemployment, which are absolutely necessary if Great Britain is to hold her own in the front rank of the nations. The issue which you have to decide is whether these funds shall be raised by the taxation of a protective tariff upon articles of common use and upon the necessaries of life, including bread and meat, or whether it shall be raised, as we propose, by the taxation of luxuries, of superfluities, and monopolies.|$|E

60|$|They had {{recently}} seen a chosen army from that country, which, reverencing as a mother, they had blindly believed invincible--an army {{led by a}} chief who had been selected from a crowd of trained warriors, for his rare military endowments, disgracefully routed {{by a handful of}} French and Indians, and only saved from annihilation by the coolness and spirit of a Virginian boy, whose riper fame has since diffused itself, with the steady influence of moral truth, to the uttermost confines of Christendom.[2] A wide frontier had been laid naked by this unexpected disaster, and more substantial evils were preceded by a thousand fanciful and imaginary dangers. The alarmed colonists believed that the yells of the savages mingled with every fitful gust of wind that issued from the interminable forests of the west. The terrific character of their merciless enemies increased immeasurably the natural horrors of warfare. Numberless recent massacres were still vivid in their recollections; nor was there any ear in the provinces so deaf as not to have drunk in with avidity the narrative of some fearful tale of midnight murder, in which the natives of the forests were the principal and barbarous actors. As the credulous and excited traveller related the hazardous chances of the wilderness, the blood of the timid curdled with terror, and mothers cast anxious glances even at those children which slumbered within the security of the largest towns. In short, the magnifying influence of fear began to set at naught the calculations of reason, and to render those who should have remembered their manhood, the slaves of the basest of passions. Even the most confident and the stoutest hearts began to <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of the contest was becoming doubtful; and that abject class was hourly increasing in numbers, who thought they foresaw all the possessions of the English crown in America subdued by their Christian foes, or laid waste by the inroads of their relentless allies.|$|E

In response to the question [...] "do you <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of same-sex marriage should be decided by Parliament or should there be a national vote", 59% favoured a national vote, 29% said it should be decided by parliament and 12% responded [...] "don't know".|$|E
50|$|Huckabee also stated, in an {{interview}} with GQ Magazine:GQ: Is the strategy shifting because social conservatives are losing on those core issues? Ten years ago, it would have been unimaginable to have gay marriage even in liberal Massachusetts. Now it's there.Huckabee: I don't <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue's</b> about being against gay marriage. It's about being for traditional marriage and articulating the reason that's important. You have to have a basic family structure. There's never been a civilization that has rewritten what marriage and family means and survived.|$|R

5000|$|In 1996, he co-authored a {{meta-analysis}} {{on the relationship}} between abortion and breast cancer along with multiple pro-life researchers, including Joel Brind. The meta-analysis concluded that abortion was associated with a 30% higher risk of breast cancer. Chinchilli told the New York Times that he believed that this increased risk is real, but acknowledged that it could be an artifact of bias. Chinchilli has described himself as pro-choice, and said in 2003 that despite the meta-analysis he co-authored, he does not <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> had been resolved. He also said that [...] "When {{we were talking about the}} conclusions, Brind wanted to make the strongest statements." ...|$|E
50|$|When {{all issues}} have been {{identified}} and posted, participants sign up and attend those individual sessions. Sessions typically last for 1.5 hours; the whole gathering usually lasts from a half day up to about two days (or five days if the stakes are high). The opening and agenda creation lasts about an hour, even with a very large group. There have been some cases where only the topic announcer showed up for a session. In this case, that person has several options: use the session as free time to <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> through and record their thoughts as {{a contribution to the}} proceedings, join another discussion leader on a related topic and see if they're open to joining topics together, or drop the topic altogether (then they just indicate on their post how they resolved no one showing up so that the session has been accounted for).|$|E
5000|$|Brind et al. (1996) {{conducted}} a meta-analysis of 23 independent epidemiologic studies. It calculated {{that there was}} on average a relative risk of 1.3 (1.2 - 1.4) increased risk of breast cancer. The meta-analysis was criticized in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute for ignoring the role of response bias and for a [...] "blurring of association with causation." [...] It was also criticized for selection bias by using studies with widely varying results, using different types of studies and not working with the raw data from several studies, and including studies that have methodological weaknesses. [...] The statistician who collaborated with Brind later stated of their findings: [...] "I have some doubts. I don't <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> has been resolved.

40|$|This study {{explored}} public involvement {{within the}} Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) using the co-orientational theory. Effective public involvement gives the public opportunities {{to be involved}} early in the planning and implementation of transportation projects that directly affect or may concern them. The co-orientational model looks at what an organization (FDOT) thinks about an issue (public involvement), what <b>the</b> public <b>thinks</b> of <b>the</b> <b>issue,</b> what <b>the</b> organization <b>thinks</b> <b>the</b> public <b>thinks</b> about <b>the</b> <b>issue,</b> and what <b>the</b> public <b>thinks</b> <b>the</b> organization <b>thinks</b> about <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b> This study investigated whether the FDOT management has an accurate understanding of {{the perceptions of the}} public and communicates effectively with them. To achieve accurate perceptions of the public, management must interact with the public to identify issues that could become potential crises if not addressed at an early stage. This study examined whether there is true consensus or dissensus among the public and the FDOT management and looked at the perceptions of both groups and the distance between them to see if the needs of the public and the Department can both be met. A critical part of this research included analyzing the opinions of the public to see if the public trusts government and the FDOT. Furthermore, this study set out to determine a relationship between trust and involvement and the different techniques used to communicate. Research was gathered through surveys to the public and to FDOT management. The public surveys were handed out at transportation public meetings across the state of Florida over a period of six months to gain the publics perception of <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> and <b>the</b> publics estimate of the management perceptions...|$|R

5000|$|Three {{delegations}} of parliamentarians from Asia and Europe visited Vientiane in 2013 {{to discuss}} Sombath’s disappearance with the Lao Government.

Dutch Senator, Tuur Elzinga, said after the visit in March, [...] "If Lao officials <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of Sombath’s disappearance will go away, they are wrong." [...] In September, a third delegation consisting of representatives from Denmark and Belgium, concluded that [...] "the Lao authorities have so far not shown adequate willingness or capacity {{to find a solution}} to this case and have refused any offer of technical assistance for the investigation". During the High-Level Round Table Meeting with the Government of Laos held in Vientiane in November 2013, a number of foreign donors expressed their concern about the disappearance of Sombath.

30|$|Engbersen {{acknowledges}} that civic integration policies {{are likely to}} create “specific migrant groups that are in vulnerable positions” and who will face challenges to “enable their transition from non- or partial membership to full social membership”. That is indeed the challenge, and my argument is that coercive civic integration policies worsen the problem, whereas multicultural nationhood can help. Engbersen appears to disagree, but I don’t yet see his argument for rejecting multicultural nationhood, or his alternative to it. In any event, I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of liquid mobility and floating populations {{is a bit of}} a red herring. Insofar as the fundamental policy choice is between multiculturalism policies and civic integration policies, both options lay out the terms of integration for people with the right to stay and to settle long-term, and both need to be evaluated for their intrinsic fairness and for their impact on an ethos of solidarity 5.|$|E

40|$|Join calculus, {{transactions}} and zero-safe nets Many different proposals (e. g., Petri nets, Linda and other tuple-space languages, CHAM, Join calculus) for applying formal methods to distributed systems rely on two fundamental design postulates: (1) states are multisets; and (2) elementary actions can atomically fetch (or release) several state components, thus synchronizing {{them at the}} event level. However, they often miss a third feature which is instead very useful for programming reliable services, namely the definition of transactions, grouping events into work units that either completely succeed or have no effect. Note that {{we are interested in}} transactions denoting atomic computations in a concurrent and causal scenario (as opposed to a sequential one). Though ad-hoc transaction mechanisms are integrated in languages such as BizTalk Orchestration and JavaSpaces, we <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> deserves a uniform treatment along the many calculi proposed in the literature.
