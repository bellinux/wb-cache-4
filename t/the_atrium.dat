5|$|The {{church has}} a total length of , {{including}} <b>the</b> <b>atrium.</b> It was mostly built of rectangular limestone blocks sparingly joined with mortar. Inside the apse, the mortar is red-coloured. The floor {{was covered by}} marble and stone tiles glued on top of red mortar in the narthex and white mortar elsewhere. Red and yellow bricks and pieces of bricks were used for <b>the</b> <b>atrium,</b> the arches, and possibly the dome; some brick pieces were used to fill spaces between the stones on the walls.|$|E
5|$|The {{floor of}} <b>the</b> <b>atrium</b> of the Molecular and Chemical Sciences Building at the University of Western Australia is tiled with Penrose tiles.|$|E
5|$|The {{rectangular}} narthex {{constitutes the}} middle {{part of the}} building, between <b>the</b> <b>atrium</b> and the cella, and serves as {{the lobby of the}} church. It lies directly east of <b>the</b> <b>atrium,</b> through a wide gate flanked by a couple of high circular turrets. Mavrodinov likens the narthex of the Round Church to similar structures in the churches of Mount Athos, because of its depth.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> left <b>atrium</b> {{receives}} oxygenated blood {{back from}} the lungs via {{one of the four}} pulmonary veins. <b>The</b> left <b>atrium</b> has an outpouching called the left atrial appendage. Like <b>the</b> right <b>atrium,</b> <b>the</b> left <b>atrium</b> is lined by pectinate muscles. <b>The</b> left <b>atrium</b> is connected to the left ventricle by the mitral valve.|$|R
50|$|The {{mammalian}} {{heart has}} 4 chambers: <b>the</b> left <b>atrium,</b> <b>the</b> left ventricle, <b>the</b> right <b>atrium</b> and <b>the</b> right ventricle.|$|R
2500|$|In <b>the</b> left <b>atrium,</b> <b>the</b> volume {{overload}} causes {{enlargement of}} <b>the</b> left <b>atrium,</b> allowing <b>the</b> filling pressure in <b>the</b> left <b>atrium</b> to decrease. [...] This improves the drainage from the pulmonary veins, and {{signs and symptoms}} of pulmonary congestion will decrease.|$|R
5|$|Commissioned in 1930 but {{removed from}} the {{agricultural}} trading room in 1973 and stored until 1982, John W. Norton's three-story mural of Ceres shown bare-breasted {{in a field of}} grain underwent extensive restoration in Spring Grove, Illinois by Louis Pomerantz before being displayed in <b>the</b> <b>atrium</b> of the 1980s addition.|$|E
5|$|Fish have a {{closed-loop}} circulatory system. The heart pumps {{the blood}} in a single loop throughout the body. In most fish, the heart consists of four parts, including two chambers and an entrance and exit. The first part is the sinus venosus, a thin-walled sac that collects blood from the fish's veins before allowing it to flow to the second part, <b>the</b> <b>atrium,</b> which is a large muscular chamber. <b>The</b> <b>atrium</b> serves as a one-way antechamber, sends blood to the third part, ventricle. The ventricle is another thick-walled, muscular chamber and it pumps the blood, first to the fourth part, bulbus arteriosus, a large tube, and then out of the heart. The bulbus arteriosus connects to the aorta, through which blood flows to the gills for oxygenation.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>atrium</b> of {{the museum}} {{contains}} two exhibits: the Rock Map of Croatia (Kamenospisna karta Hrvatske) and the Geological Pole (Geološki stup). The Rock Map of Croatia is a mosaic map assembled from various pieces of rock found in Croatia into the country's shape.|$|E
30|$|An ASD {{is defined}} as a {{persistent}} opening in the interatrial septum after birth, allowing communication between the left and <b>the</b> right <b>atrium</b> [5, 6]. When present, oxygenated blood shunts from <b>the</b> left <b>atrium</b> to <b>the</b> right <b>atrium,</b> <b>the</b> shunted volume {{depending on the size of}} the defect.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>atrium's</b> {{floor is}} made of wood {{salvaged}} from a barn in Georgia.|$|R
50|$|In <b>the</b> right <b>atrium,</b> <b>the</b> stretch receptors {{occur at}} the {{junction}} of the venae cavae. In <b>the</b> left <b>atrium,</b> <b>the</b> junction is at the pulmonary veins. Increasing stretch of the receptors stimulates both an increase in heart rate {{and a decrease in}} vasopressin (ADH) secretion from posterior pituitary.|$|R
5|$|The {{building}} contains four {{establishments for}} eating or drinking: Trump Bar, Trump’s Ice Cream Parlor, Trump Cafe, and Trump Grill. Of these, Trump Bar {{is the only}} establishment at <b>the</b> <b>atrium</b> level; the other three {{are located in the}} basement.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{hospital building}} is now largely occupied by corporate offices. The 1966 extension houses the library, art store, and document archives while the 1980s redevelopments created exhibition space over five floors. The first stage created 8,000m2 of gallery space of which 4,600m2 was new, {{and the second}} provided a further 1,600m2. The final phase, the Southwest Infill, was partly funded by a £12.6 million grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund and provided 5,860m2 of gallery space and educational facilities over six floors. Before the 2013-14 redevelopment, the basement was occupied by permanent galleries on the First and Second World Wars, and of conflicts after 1945. The ground floor comprised <b>the</b> <b>atrium,</b> cinema, temporary exhibition spaces, and visitor facilities. The first floor included <b>the</b> <b>atrium</b> mezzanine, education facilities, and a permanent gallery, Secret War, exploring special forces, espionage and covert operations. The second floor included <b>the</b> <b>atrium</b> viewing balcony, two art galleries, a temporary exhibition area and the permanent Crimes against Humanity exhibition. The third floor housed the permanent Holocaust Exhibition, and the fourth floor, a vaulted roof space, accommodated the Lord Ashcroft Gallery. Opened in November 2010 the gallery exhibits the museum's Victoria Cross (VC) and George Cross collection, alongside the private VC collection amassed by Michael Ashcroft, 241 medals in total.|$|E
5|$|The {{shopping}} {{levels in}} the Clal Building are exceptionally large, with space for stores and a cinema. Stores are situated {{around the perimeter of}} a large, central atrium. Originally <b>the</b> <b>atrium</b> was open-air, but weather damage forced planners to install a semi-transparent roof. Several banks of elevators access upper-floor offices.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the case}} of a large ASD (> 9mm), which may result in a {{clinically}} remarkable left-to-right shunt, blood [...] shunts from <b>the</b> left <b>atrium</b> to <b>the</b> right <b>atrium.</b> [...] This extra blood from <b>the</b> left <b>atrium</b> may cause a volume overload of both <b>the</b> right <b>atrium</b> and <b>the</b> right ventricle. [...] If untreated, this condition can result in enlargement of {{the right side of the}} heart and ultimately heart failure.|$|R
50|$|The septum primum is on {{the left}} side of the heart in <b>the</b> left <b>atrium</b> while <b>the</b> septum secundum is much thicker and is located on the right side, in <b>the</b> right <b>atrium.</b> During development, blood shunts from the floor of <b>the</b> right <b>atrium</b> through <b>the</b> foramen ovale in the septum secundum then up through the foramen secundum in the septum primum. The foramen secundum is {{positioned}} so that blood exits in the ceiling of <b>the</b> left <b>atrium</b> and then out through the left ventricle and the aorta. The position of the foramen secundum and the size of the septum primum are crucial to ensuring that blood not flow backwards from <b>the</b> left <b>atrium</b> to <b>the</b> right <b>atrium.</b> <b>The</b> septum primum, being much thinner, is easily pressed against the septum secundum if blood attempts to flow in the reverse direction, effectively sealing off both the foramen secundum and the foramen ovale.|$|R
50|$|The {{constant}} pressure overload of <b>the</b> left <b>atrium</b> will cause <b>the</b> left <b>atrium</b> {{to increase in}} size. As <b>the</b> left <b>atrium</b> increases in size, it becomes more prone to develop atrial fibrillation (AF). When atrial fibrillation develops, the atrial kick is lost (since it {{is due to the}} normal atrial contraction).|$|R
5|$|The {{sinoatrial node}} uses calcium {{to cause a}} depolarising signal {{transduction}} pathway from <b>the</b> <b>atrium</b> through right and left atrioventricular bundle which communicates contraction to the ventricles. The avian heart also consists of muscular arches that {{are made up of}} thick bundles of muscular layers. Much like a mammalian heart, the avian heart is composed of endocardial, myocardial and epicardial layers. <b>The</b> <b>atrium</b> walls tend to be thinner than the ventricle walls, due to the intense ventricular contraction used to pump oxygenated blood throughout the body. Avian hearts are generally larger than mammalian hearts when compared to body mass. This adaptation allows more blood to be pumped to meet the high metabolic need associated with flight.|$|E
5|$|Today, {{the site}} of the fort is located at the {{intersection}} of Key Boulevard and North Ode Street in Arlington, Virginia (1530 N. Key Blvd., on {{the site of}} <b>the</b> <b>Atrium).</b> No trace of the fort remains, though a small historical marker has been constructed by the Arlington Historical Society.|$|E
5|$|Anderson and Dredd {{obtain the}} code to Ma-Ma's {{apartment}} from her computer expert and confront her. Ma-Ma tells Dredd that, {{in the case}} of her death, a device on her wrist will detonate explosives on the top floors, destroying the building. Dredd reasons that the detonator's signal will not reach the explosives from the ground floor, so he forces Ma-Ma to inhale Slo-Mo and throws her down <b>the</b> <b>atrium</b> to her death.|$|E
5000|$|Following {{birth and}} {{separation}} from the placenta, the oxygen content in the inferior vena cava falls. With the onset of breathing, <b>the</b> left <b>atrium</b> receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs via the pulmonary veins. As {{blood flow to the}} lungs increases, the amount of blood flow entering <b>the</b> left <b>atrium</b> increases. When <b>the</b> pressure in <b>the</b> left <b>atrium</b> exceeds <b>the</b> pressure in <b>the</b> right <b>atrium,</b> <b>the</b> foramen ovale begins to close and limits the blood flow between the left and right <b>atrium.</b> While <b>the</b> eustachian valve persists in adult life, it essentially does not have a specific function after the gestational period.|$|R
50|$|The genus Notogynaphallia is {{characterized}} by having a small-to-medium, slender body with nearly parallel margins. The eyes are arranged along the body margins and may or not spread to the dorsum. The copulatory apparatus lacks a permanent penis, i. e., the penis is formed during copulation by folds in <b>the</b> male <b>atrium.</b> <b>The</b> male part of the copulatory apparatus also lacks an ejaculatory duct, so that the prostatic vesicle opens directly into <b>the</b> male <b>atrium.</b> <b>The</b> female <b>atrium</b> is usually irregular and narrow and the ovovitelline ducts join each other behind it.|$|R
2500|$|The {{constant}} pressure overload of <b>the</b> left <b>atrium</b> will cause <b>the</b> left <b>atrium</b> {{to increase in}} size. [...] As <b>the</b> left <b>atrium</b> increases in size, it becomes more prone to develop atrial fibrillation (AF). [...] When atrial fibrillation develops, the atrial kick is lost (since it {{is due to the}} normal atrial contraction).|$|R
5|$|Lighting {{also served}} Gaudí for the {{organisation}} of space, which required a careful {{study of the}} gradient of light intensity to adequately adapt to each specific environment. He achieved this with different elements such as skylights, windows, shutters and blinds; a notable case is the gradation of colour used in <b>the</b> <b>atrium</b> of the Casa Batlló to achieve uniform distribution of light throughout the interior. He also tended to build south-facing houses to maximise sunlight.|$|E
5|$|Production on the biopic {{began at}} DePauw University's Greencastle campus in May 2002 and {{included}} video of Julian's bust {{on display in}} <b>the</b> <b>atrium</b> of the university's Percy Lavon Julian Science and Mathematics Center. Completion and broadcasting of the documentary program was delayed in order for Nova to commission and publish a matching book on Julian's life.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>atrium,</b> apartments, offices, {{and stores}} opened on a {{staggered}} schedule from February to November 1983. At first, {{there were few}} tenants willing to move in to the commercial and retail spaces; the residential units were sold out within months of opening. Since 2016, the tower has seen a large surge in visitation because of Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and subsequent election—both his 2016 and 2020 campaigns are headquartered in the tower.|$|E
50|$|It {{originally}} {{starts as}} a paired structure but shifts towards associating only with <b>the</b> right <b>atrium</b> as <b>the</b> embryonic heart develops. The left portion shrinks {{in size and}} eventually forms the coronary sinus (right atrium) and oblique vein of <b>the</b> left <b>atrium,</b> whereas <b>the</b> right part becomes incorporated into <b>the</b> right <b>atrium</b> to form <b>the</b> sinus venarum.|$|R
25|$|In transthoracic echocardiography, an atrial septal defect {{may be seen}} on color {{flow imaging}} as a jet of blood from <b>the</b> left <b>atrium</b> to <b>the</b> right <b>atrium.</b>|$|R
50|$|The normal {{cardiac rhythm}} {{originates}} in the sinoatrial node, {{which is located}} in <b>the</b> right <b>atrium</b> near <b>the</b> superior vena cava. From there, the electrical activation spreads throughout <b>the</b> right <b>atrium.</b> There are at least four different locations where the activation can pass to <b>the</b> left <b>atrium.</b> Apart from Bachmann's bundle these are the anterior interatrial septum, posterior interatrial septum, and the coronary sinus. Because it originates close to the sinoatrial node and consists of long parallel fibers, Bachmann's bundle is, during sinus rhythm, {{the first of these}} connections to activate <b>the</b> left <b>atrium.</b>|$|R
5|$|The second {{piece of}} art is Jonathan Borofsky's Humanity in Motion. Located in the glass atrium of the winter garden, Humanity in Motion shows ten life-size human figures walking across ten {{horizontal}} poles positioned {{at different levels of}} <b>the</b> <b>atrium.</b> At ground level, looking up at the stainless steel figures, are two more figures shaped to look like a father and son.|$|E
5|$|After Watson's death, {{the hotel}} lost its {{popularity}} to the rival Taj Hotel. In the 1960s {{the hotel was}} closed. Sometime after this, it was subdivided and partitioned into small cubicles with independent access and let out on rent. Over the years, apathy toward the building by the residents has resulted the building decaying, {{and it is now}} in a dilapidated state. <b>The</b> <b>atrium</b> was subsequently used as a dumping ground and has several illegal constructions. , building had 53 families and 97 commercial establishments. Most of the commercial establishments are chambers of lawyers attached to the adjacent Bombay Civil & Session Courts and the nearby Bombay High Court.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, {{construction}} of the building began, with a design by Der Scutt, of Poor, Swanke, Hayden & Connell, and development by Trump and the Equitable Life Assurance Company (renamed the AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company in 2004). Although it is in one of Midtown Manhattan's special zoning districts, the tower was approved because {{it was to be}} built as a mixed-use development. Trump was permitted to add more stories to the tower because of <b>the</b> <b>atrium</b> on the ground floor. There were controversies during construction, including the destruction of historically important sculptures from the Bonwit Teller store; Trump's alleged underpaying of contractors; and a lawsuit that Trump filed because the tower was not tax-exempt.|$|E
50|$|The ostium secundum {{progressively}} enlarges and {{the size}} of the septum primum diminishes. Eventually, the septum primum is nothing more than a small flap that covers the foramen ovale on its left side. This flap of tissue is called the valve of the foramen ovale. It opens and closes in response to pressure gradients between the left and right atria. When the pressure is greater in <b>the</b> right <b>atrium,</b> <b>the</b> valve opens; when the pressure is greater in <b>the</b> left <b>atrium,</b> <b>the</b> valve closes. Because the lungs are nonfunctional in fetal life, pressure in the pulmonary circulation is greater than that of the systemic circulation. Consequently, <b>the</b> right <b>atrium</b> is generally under higher pressures than <b>the</b> left <b>atrium,</b> and <b>the</b> valve of the foramen ovale is normally open.|$|R
50|$|A sinus venosus ASD that {{involves}} the superior vena cava makes up 2 to 3% of all interatrial communication. It {{is located at the}} junction of the superior vena cava and <b>the</b> right <b>atrium.</b> It is frequently associated with anomalous drainage of the right-sided pulmonary veins into <b>the</b> right <b>atrium</b> (instead of <b>the</b> normal drainage of the pulmonary veins into <b>the</b> left <b>atrium).</b>|$|R
5000|$|An atrial septal defect (ASD) and a {{ventricular}} septal defect (VSD) must both {{be present}} to maintain blood flow-from <b>the</b> right <b>atrium,</b> <b>the</b> blood must {{flow through the}} ASD to <b>the</b> left <b>atrium</b> to <b>the</b> left ventricle and through the VSD to the right ventricle to allow access to the lungs ...|$|R
