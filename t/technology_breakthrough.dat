50|$|The {{twisted nematic}} effect (TN-effect) was a main <b>technology</b> <b>breakthrough</b> that made LCDs practical. Unlike earlier displays, TN-cells {{did not require}} a current to flow for {{operation}} and used low operating voltages suitable for use with batteries. The introduction of TN-effect displays led to their rapid expansion in the display field, quickly pushing out other common technologies like monolithic LEDs and CRTs for most electronics. By the 1990s, TN-effect LCDs were largely universal in portable electronics. In the meantime, many applications of LCDs are using alternatives to the TN-effect such as in-plane switching (IPS) or vertical alignment (VA).|$|E

The height of the Diana suction caissons is 30 metres, their diameter 6.5 metres, and they were installed at a depth of about 1500 m on soft clay deposits.

50|$|SOLO-TREC has {{completed}} more than 450 dives {{from the ocean}} surface {{to a depth of}} 500 meters (1,640 feet) and is reporting temperature and salinity profiles three times per day. Designers control the depth to which the instrument dives through its hydraulic system. Its thermal recharging engine produces about 1.7 watt-hours, or 6,100 joules, of energy per dive, enough electricity to operate the vehicle’s science instruments, GPS receiver, communications device and buoyancy-control pump. SOLO-TREC has the potential to replace current ocean monitoring currently done by 3,200 battery-powered Argo floats deployed previously to measure temperature, salinity, and velocity. The US Navy is also exploring the use of thermal recharging technology {{for the next generation of}} autonomous submersible vehicles.

40|$|Product {{language}} is {{the set of}} stylistic, aesthetic and design traits of a product specifically aimed at conveying users the meaning of that product. Thus when a <b>technology</b> <b>breakthrough</b> occurs firms are faced by the fundamental challenge of developing an appropriate new product language to mark the new technology and highlight its new features and capabilities to create value for user. Nevertheless {{the dynamics of the}} product language evolution in the early phases of a <b>technology</b> <b>breakthrough</b> are still poorly understood. The paper analyses the launch and the early years (2007 - 2011) of the LED-based products in the Italian decorative lamp industry. Using the network graph analysis the paper highlights the product language’s evolutionary dynamics of these products and based on existing theories speculates on the drivers of such dynamics. In particular three main factors seem to affect the early evolution of the product language of a breakthrough technology: (i) the users lock-in created by the early product language experimentations, (ii) the collective mechanisms that firms adopt when they develop new product languages (so called design discourse) and (iii) the influence of past product language solutions on the interplay between problem space and solution space in defining new developments.
