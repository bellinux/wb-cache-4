5|$|Himmler {{notified}} Fegelein by telegram on 1 August {{that the}} numbers killed were far too low. A few days later, Himmler issued regimental order no. 42, which called for all male Jews {{over the age of}} 14 to be killed. The women and children were to be driven into <b>the</b> <b>swamps</b> and drowned. Thus Fegelein's units were among the first in the Holocaust to wipe out entire Jewish communities. As the water in <b>the</b> <b>swamps</b> was too shallow and some areas had no swamps, it proved impractical to drown the women and children, so they were shot. Fegelein's final report on the operation, dated 18 September 1941, states that they killed 14,178 Jews, 1,001 partisans, 699 Red Army soldiers, with 830 prisoners taken and losses of 17 dead, 36 wounded, and 3 missing. The historian Henning Pieper estimates the actual number of Jews killed was closer to 23,700.|$|E

5|$|Terrain {{played a}} {{significant}} role in operations around Narva. The elevation above sea level rarely rises above 100 meters in the area and the land is cut by numerous waterways, including the Narva and Plyussa Rivers. The bulk of the land in the region is forested and large swamps inundate areas of low elevation. The effect of the terrain on operations was one of channelization; because of <b>the</b> <b>swamps,</b> only certain areas were suitable for large-scale troop movement.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{hydrological}} {{role of a}} headwater swamp in {{a tropical}} rainforest is studied using chloride mass balance (CMB) and end-member mixing analysis. There are three main contributions to streamflow: (1) the hillside bedrock aquifer, (2) overland flow from <b>the</b> <b>swamp</b> during storm events and (3) groundwater flow from <b>the</b> <b>swamp</b> aquifer. Before rainfall events of the wet season, the pre-event water comprises a mix of 80 % of bedrock aquifer and 20 % of swamp aquifer. During storms, the relative contribution of overland flow increases according to the rainfall intensity and the initial saturation rate of the pre-event water reservoirs. The yearly contribution of overland flow from <b>the</b> <b>swamp</b> to <b>the</b> stream is about 31 %. The relationship between <b>the</b> <b>swamp</b> and <b>the</b> stream fluctuates with space and time. Generally, <b>the</b> <b>swamp</b> is drained by the stream; however, {{at the end of}} long dry seasons, after the first rains, indirect recharge occurs from the stream to <b>the</b> <b>swamp</b> with a hydraulic gradient inversion in <b>the</b> <b>swamp</b> aquifer. <b>The</b> net contribution of <b>the</b> <b>swamp</b> aquifer to <b>the</b> stream is only 4 %, which is much lower than the hillside aquifer contribution of about 65 %. Recharge on <b>the</b> <b>swamp</b> being very low, these results suggest that, except for a few storms {{at the end of the}} dry season, <b>the</b> Nsimi <b>swamp</b> does not contribute to flood attenuation. Evapotranspiration is higher on the hillside than in <b>the</b> <b>swamp.</b> Nevertheless, depletion of water stored within <b>the</b> <b>swamp</b> is dominated by evaporation rather than by its contribution to streamflow. The export of solutes through swamp groundwater flow below the weir is low (< 7 %). Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>swamp</b> is <b>the</b> most active area of weathering in the watershed...|$|R

5|$|Adults {{make their}} homes within holes in various {{mangrove}} trees and maintain an arboreal existence whereas the young are strictly terrestrial {{for the first}} year of their lives. As the Utila iguana cannot successfully lay its eggs in the mangrove swamps, the gravid females are forced to migrate to nearby sandy beaches in order to bury their clutches of eggs so they can incubate in the hot sun. After digging their nest burrows and laying their eggs, the females abandon the nests and return to the mangroves.

5|$|In 1817, Andrew Jackson invaded Florida {{to hasten}} its {{annexation}} to the United States, in {{what became known}} as the First Seminole War.

The Second Seminole War lasted from 1835 to 1842, and afterward, the US forcibly removed about 3,000 Seminole and 800 Black Seminole to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma), west of the Mississippi River. Many others died in the war. Conflict broke out again in the Third Seminole War from 1855 to 1859, when a few hundred Seminole fought off US forces from <b>the</b> <b>swamps</b> of the Everglades.

5|$|Often farmers {{would leave}} a solitary cabbage tree‚Äîor even groves of trees‚Äîstanding after <b>the</b> <b>swamps</b> were drained. Most of these trees will slowly die out because {{livestock}} eat the seedlings and damage the trunks and roots of adult trees. When a cabbage tree {{is the only}} shade in a field, stock will shelter underneath it, damaging the bark by rubbing against it, and compacting the soil around the tree. Cows, sheep, goats, and deer eat the nutritious tissue under the bark of cabbage trees. Once the trunk has been damaged by animals, it seldom heals and the wounds get bigger over time. Eventually the tissue in {{the centre of the}} stem rots away and a cavity forms along its entire length. The trunk becomes misshapen or completely ring-barked for a metre above the ground. Often the growth layer dies and the injuries may lead to bacterial or fungal infections that spread into the branches until the canopy too begins to die. Other factors thought to contribute to Rural Decline include wood-rotting fungi like Phanerochaete cordylines, micro-organisms which cause saprobic decay and leaf-feeding caterpillars.|$|E
