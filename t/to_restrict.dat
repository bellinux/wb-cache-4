40|$|Purpose: To design interdialytic {{and daily}} weight gain graphs for {{patients}} on maintenance haemodialysis and to evaluate their effect on patient adherence <b>to</b> <b>restricted</b> fluid intake. Methods: Forty-five patients on maintenance haemodialysis were recruited from August to October 2012. The graphs were applied for 12 weeks based on Bandura's self-efficacy theory. Adherence <b>to</b> <b>restricted</b> fluid intake, dialysis adequacy, and satisfaction were compared {{before and after the}} graphs were applied. Results: Adherence <b>to</b> <b>restricted</b> fluid intake increased from 53. 3 % to 91. 1 %; the mean rate of urea clearance (Kt/V) decreased from 1. 197 to 1. 311, and the qualified rate increased from 42. 5 % to 70 %. The rate of adherence was 86. 77 %; acceptance and satisfaction rates were 100 %. Conclusion: It is acceptable to apply the graphs clinically for subsequent effective improvement of adherence <b>to</b> <b>restricted</b> fluid intake, promoting dialysis adequacy, and increasing patient satisfaction. Therefore, clinical application of the graphs is worthwhile...|$|R
40|$|We used an econometric choice task to {{estimate}} the implicit reward value of social and nonsocial stimuli related <b>to</b> <b>restricted</b> interests {{in children and adolescents}} with (n= 12) and without (n= 22) ASD. Mixed effects logistic regression analyses revealed that children and adolescents with ASD were willing to receive less cash payout <b>to</b> view <b>restricted</b> interest stimuli, whereas children and adolescents without ASD were indifferent to cash payouts to view these images. Groups did not differ in valuation of social images or nonsocial images unrelated <b>to</b> <b>restricted</b> interests. Our findings reveal that individuals with ASD assign enhanced reward value of nonsocial stimuli related <b>to</b> <b>restricted</b> interests in ASD. These results suggest that motivational accounts of ASD should also consider the reward value of restricted interests in addition to that of social stimuli (Dichter & Adolphs, 2012) ...|$|R
