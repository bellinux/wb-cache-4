According to drummer Dafydd Ieuan the band didn't have <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the artists involved for these remixes so, {{in order to provide}} them with royalties, promised to release an album featuring the tracks on their own label.|$|E
5|$|Steinbeck {{was right}} about the lack of popular appeal, however: the unusual mixture of taxonomic data and travelogue meant the book {{struggled}} to find an audience. Few copies were printed and it was soon all but forgotten. The country's entry into the war and plummeting book sales also had an effect. Ricketts' share of the revenues from sales did not even provide him with <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> back Steinbeck for financing the journey.|$|E
5|$|After {{winning the}} bidding, TETCO raised <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the {{government}} {{through a combination}} of bonds and share issues. A further government enquiry was required before the sale was allowed to go through, which was complicated by the reluctance of the state of Pennsylvania to allow the pipelines to be used to pump gas east through its territory. The government of Pennsylvania was influenced by the coal industry, who feared they would lose sales, but it eventually relented and the sale of the pipelines to TETCO was finally completed on November 1. The value of the company soared, and the original investors saw the value of their holdings increase 63-fold.|$|E

5|$|Knowing that Cleomenes got <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for his mercenaries from Ptolemy, Antigonus, {{according}} to Peter Green, {{seems to have}} ceded some territory in Asia Minor to Ptolemy in return for Ptolemy withdrawing his financial support of Sparta. Whether this assumption is accurate or not, Ptolemy certainly withdrew his support, which left Cleomenes without {{money to pay for}} his mercenaries. Desperate, Cleomenes freed all helots able to pay five Attic minae; in this way he accumulated 500 talents of silver. He also armed 2,000 of the ex-helots in Macedonian style to counter the White Shields, the Macedonian crack troops, before planning a major initiative.|$|E
5|$|Several factors {{prevented}} {{the company from}} going bankrupt that year. The Desjardins Group, which was Cirque du Soleil's financial institution at the time, covered about $200,000 of bad checks. Also, a financier named Daniel Lamarre, who worked {{for one of the}} largest public relations firms in Quebec, represented the company for free, knowing that they didn't have <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> his fee. The Quebec government itself also came through again, granting Laliberté enough money to stay solvent for another year.|$|E

She later learns that Thamizhmani's son had run over a girl with his car, and Manohar stole <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for the girl's medical treatment. Divya feels guilty, and bails him out.|$|E

Some time later, cotton worms destroy Epps's cotton. Unable {{to work his}} fields, Epps leases his slaves to a neighboring plantation for the season. While there, Northup gains the favor of the plantation's owner, Judge Turner, who allows him to play the fiddle at a neighbor's wedding anniversary celebration, and to keep his earnings. When Northup returns to Epps, he attempts to use <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> a white field hand and former overseer, Armsby, to mail {{a letter to his}} friends in New York State. Armsby agrees, and accepts Northup's saved money, but immediately betrays him to Epps. In {{the middle of the night}} Epps wakes Solomon and questions him menacingly about the letter. Northup is narrowly able to convince Epps that Armsby is lying and Epps relents.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{immediate}} political result of the First Punic War was the downfall of Carthage's naval power. Conditions signed in the peace treaty were intended to compromise Carthage's economic situation and prevent the city's recovery.

25|$|Lincoln lost farms {{three times}} after {{boundary}} disputes due to defective titles and Kentucky's chaotic land laws, {{complicated by the}} absence of United States land surveys and the use of subjective or arbitrary landmarks to determine land boundaries.

In addition, as a farmer, Lincoln was unable to compete with those who had slaves to work their fields.|$|E

25|$|It was {{estimated}} that the IRA carried out 1,000 armed robberies in Northern Ireland, mostly of banks and post offices. It was accused {{of involvement in the}} biggest bank raid in Irish history—the 2004 Northern Bank robbery—when £26.5 million was stolen from the Northern Bank in Belfast city centre. The PSNI, the Independent Monitoring Commission and the British and Irish governments all accused the IRA of involvement.
