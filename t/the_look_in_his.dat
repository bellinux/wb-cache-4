2500|$|By 1978, Wood's {{depression}} had worsened, {{and he and}} {{his wife}} Kathy had become alcoholics. They were evicted from their Hollywood apartment on Yucca Street on Thursday, December 7, 1978 in total poverty. The couple moved into the North Hollywood apartment of their friend actor Peter Coe. Wood spent the weekend drinking vodka. Around noon on Sunday, December 10, Wood felt ill and went to lie down in Coe's bedroom. From the bedroom, he asked Kathy to bring him a drink which she refused to do. A few minutes later he yelled out, [...] "Kathy, I can't breathe!", a plea Kathy ignored as she later said she was tired of Wood's bossing her around. After hearing no movement from the bedroom for 20 minutes, Kathy sent a friend to check on Wood, who discovered him dead from a heart attack. Kathy later said, [...] "I still remember when I went into that room that afternoon and he was dead, his eyes and mouth were wide open. I'll never forget <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eyes. He clutched at the sheets. It looked like he'd seen hell." ...|$|E
60|$|Louis' {{eyes had}} narrowed. <b>The</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> face was almost {{enough to make}} one afraid.|$|E
60|$|COKESON. Ye-es, {{but it was}} <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eyes. I can't {{explain my}} meaning--it was funny.|$|E
60|$|Thorne watched Nevis closely, and {{imagined}} that <b>the</b> ominous <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> face grew plainer still.|$|R
60|$|The lame man's face brightened. He had <b>the</b> upward <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eyes which {{prolonged}} suffering often brings.|$|R
60|$|Even as {{she spoke}} the {{professor}} {{came into the room}} still with <b>the</b> dazed <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eyes.|$|R
60|$|He gained confidence. <b>The</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> little {{eyes was}} the filmy look {{of those of}} an animal feasting.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hah?" [...] said Mowgli, for {{naturally}} he {{had never}} heard anything of the kind. Messua laughed softly and happily. <b>The</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> face was enough for her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{returned}} Hare, [...] "but I--I'll never ride again." [...] He said it brightly, smiling the while; still <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eyes belied {{the cheerful}} resignation.|$|E
50|$|He {{is also a}} {{destroyer}} of illusions. He has {{the ability}} to distress the subject, until he reveals some invisible, strange place within himself. <b>The</b> <b>looks</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> portraits are incisive, painful, powerful, {{and at the end of}} that open crack primary helplessness looms. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> composition she uses eloquent backgrounds, as if what is behind the scene were the undertone of his real meaning.|$|R
60|$|Steele {{never asked}} questions, but <b>the</b> hungry <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eyes {{was enough to}} make even a truthful fellow exaggerate things.|$|R
60|$|His breath {{suddenly}} failed him, and he {{ceased to}} speak, but <b>the</b> glad <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> large eyes {{showed that the}} flow of Divine words, though inaudible, had not ceased.|$|R
60|$|Nevis did not comply, {{and though}} he made a gesture of deprecation <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eyes warned her that he meant to let her feel his power.|$|E
60|$|She {{broke off}} {{confused}} by <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eyes, conscious of an absurd feeling of guilt. There was amazement in that look and {{a sort of}} incredulous horror.|$|E
6000|$|... "Shouldn't wonder. A case of {{embezzlement}} such as {{you read}} of in the newspapers." [...] His tone was easy, but he avoided <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> wife's beautiful gray eyes.|$|E
60|$|It {{was then}} that the memory of Ramiro del' Orca, and <b>the</b> <b>look</b> that <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eyes I had {{surprised}} whilst Madonna drank, flashed back into my mind.|$|R
60|$|He sat {{shivering}} slightly, with <b>the</b> same timid <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> face as before.|$|R
60|$|They {{went back}} to the window, and <b>the</b> farmer <b>looked</b> <b>in,</b> <b>his</b> mouth falling apart to a greater width at the corners than in the middle, and his fingers {{assuming}} a state of radiation.|$|R
60|$|I {{could see}} by <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eyes, when {{his mind was}} made up as to how he should steer, {{and a moment later}} he said with a start of pretended surprise.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{hate him}} very deeply," [...] said Mr. Caryll pensively, and <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eyes betrayed {{the trend of}} his thoughts; they were of pity--but of pity at the {{futility}} of such strong emotions.|$|E
60|$|Somebody tittered, {{but that}} {{somebody}} was not M. Binet. He had been touched on the raw, and <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> little eyes betrayed {{the fact that}} his bonhomme exterior covered anything but a bonhomme.|$|E
60|$|He smiled, {{for she was}} swaying, her lids half closed. By {{a supreme}} effort she conquered her terror and <b>looked</b> at him. <b>The</b> <b>look</b> was <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eyes still, {{intensified}} now.|$|R
60|$|As Julius {{returned}} from letting the doctor out, Anne {{met him in}} the hall. She was at once struck by <b>the</b> worn <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> face, and by the fatigue which expressed itself <b>in</b> all <b>his</b> movements.|$|R
60|$|He {{sat down}} by her {{and took her}} hand. <b>The</b> loving <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eyes, which she knew so well, was not in them now; they {{expressed}} doubt, and something with it which suggested an effort at conciliation.|$|R
60|$|His gray shirt, loose at the throat, {{showed a}} neck that resembled the {{spreading}} base of an oak tree, and his crossed limbs and half-recumbent pose formed a curious opposition to <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eyes.|$|E
6000|$|Then I said, [...] "William Nye!" [...] But {{he turned}} upon me, And <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eye Was quite painful to see; And he says, [...] "You mistake: this poor Injin I protects from such sharps as you be!" ...|$|E
60|$|For the Princess {{it was a}} day full of excitements. The Count {{had only}} just reluctantly withdrawn, and Jeanne had gone to her room under the plea of fatigue, when Forrest was shown in. She started at <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> drawn face.|$|E
6000|$|Leland nodded, {{though there}} was light enough to show <b>the</b> curious <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eyes. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "that ought to be excuse enough for me, and it's {{going to be a}} good deal colder presently." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>The</b> parting <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> face, and <b>the</b> sudden {{silence that}} had fallen on him, were not lost on Pedgift Senior. [...] "Bashwood will end badly," [...] said the lawyer, {{shuffling}} his papers, and returning impenetrably to his interrupted work.|$|R
60|$|Father Benwell's trained {{observation}} {{followed the}} vivid changes of expression on Romayne's face, and marked <b>the</b> eager <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{eyes as he}} lifted his head from the dog to the dog's master. The priest saw his opportunity and took it.|$|R
6000|$|Then I said, [...] "William Nye!" [...] But {{he turned}} upon me, [...] And <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eye [...] Was quite painful to see; [...] And he says, [...] "You mistake; this poor Injin [...] I protects from such sharps as YOU be!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Follow there,' {{was all he}} sez, but I niver heard a man spake in {{that voice}} before or since, an' I knew by those two wan words an' <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> face that she was Di'monds-an'-Pearls that he'd talked av in his disthresses.|$|E
60|$|I {{never saw}} a boy look so happy. As for Laddie, who was sitting beside him with his shaggy head on Ernest's knee, I really believe the dog understood, too. <b>The</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eyes was almost human. Uncle Richard leaned over and patted him.|$|E
60|$|The {{more she}} dwelt upon this neglect the more {{significant}} it became. After <b>the</b> tender <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eyes, after <b>the</b> ardent clasp of his hand, {{the thought that}} he could be so indifferent was at once a source of pain and self-reproach.|$|R
60|$|Before <b>the</b> <b>look</b> of loathing <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{handsome}} face Gonzaga cringed. Gian Maria laughed <b>in</b> <b>his</b> piping treble.|$|R
25|$|Weston {{was known}} to {{extensively}} use dodging and burning to achieve <b>the</b> <b>look</b> he wanted <b>in</b> <b>his</b> prints.|$|R
