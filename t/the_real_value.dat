40|$|Introduction. We aim to {{regularize}} measurement {{values in}} three-dimensional (3 D) computed tomography (CT) reconstructed images for higher-precision 3 D analysis, focusing on length-based 3 D cephalometric examinations. Methods. We measure the linear distances between points on different skull models using Vernier calipers (<b>real</b> <b>values).</b> We use 10 differently tilted CT scans for 3 D CT {{reconstruction of the}} models and measure the same linear distances from the picture archiving and communication system (PACS). In both cases, each measurement is performed three times by three doctors, yielding nine measurements. <b>The</b> <b>real</b> <b>values</b> are compared with the PACS values. Each PACS measurement is revised based on the display field of view (DFOV) values and compared with <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>values.</b> Results. <b>The</b> <b>real</b> <b>values</b> and <b>the</b> PACS measurement changes according to tilt value have no significant correlations (p> 0. 05). However, significant correlations appear between <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>values</b> and DFOV-adjusted PACS measurements (p< 0. 001). Hence, we obtain a correlation expression that can yield <b>real</b> physical <b>values</b> from PACS measurements. The DFOV value intervals for various age groups are also verified. Conclusion.

25|$|During the {{austerity}} period, {{the aim of}} the Socialists {{was limited}} to that of safeguarding the position of beneficiaries as far as possible and of giving special consideration to the poorest amongst them. While further increases in benefits for the elderly, the handicapped, and in some family allowances later became possible, extra costs were also imposed. For instance, the duration of unemployment benefits was reduced, while a basic hospital charge (with exemptions) was introduced, and contributions from the early retired and unemployed towards health care were demanded although, once again, the worse off were exempt. Austerity measures also led to efforts to restrain family costs {{while at the same time}} trying to safeguard priority groups. In February 1982, a 25% increase was made in allowances for families containing two eligible children, but some benefits were abandoned and the starting and finishing dates for eligibility altered. Later, cash increases were less than the amounts necessary to maintain <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>value</b> of family benefits except for the poorest groups in French society. The limits on income assessed for social insurance contributions were raised and the income base upon which employers and the self-employed were assessed for contributions was changed. The cost of support for handicapped adults was transferred to the national government, although some taxation on tobacco and alcohol was also earmarked for this purpose. A 1% tax on personal incomes was imposed (although the poorest 33% of taxpayers was excluded), and a 1% “solidarity” contribution levied on civil servants towards the cost of unemployment insurance. In spite of austerity, however, <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>value</b> of social protection made modest increases. Within the total, the greatest benefits was reserved for the poorest whilst income was raised in ways which saw a modest shift from traditional financing methods towards general community financing.|$|E
25|$|Before the 1980s, smallholders grew local, open-pollinated {{types of}} maize, using seed {{reserved}} from previous crops. With adequate rain, this needed 80 to 120 days to develop fully. The hybrid maize {{introduced in the}} 1980s, ripened after as little as 75 days in similar conditions with sufficient fertilizer. Local maize benefited from fertilizer, but hybrid maize yielded up to 4 tonnes per hectare only if sufficient fertilizer was applied. Growing hybrid maize required reasonable sale prices and low fertilizer costs for farmers. However, farm incomes started to declining after 1976, and from 1981 to 1986 <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>value</b> of Malawi maize producer prices fell to 40% to 60% of those of other Central and East African states.

25|$|Seamen's pay rates {{had been}} {{established}} in 1658, {{and because of the}} stability of wages and prices, they were still reasonable as recently as the 1756–1763 Seven Years' War; however, high inflation during the last decades of the 18th century had thus severely eroded <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>value</b> of the pay. In recent years, pay raises had also been granted to the army, militia, and naval officers. At the same time, the practice of coppering the submerged part of hulls, which had started in 1761, meant that British warships no longer had to return to port frequently to have their hulls scraped, and the additional time at sea significantly altered the rhythm and difficulty of seamen's work. The Royal Navy had not made adjustments for any of these changes, and was slow to understand their effects on its crews. Finally, the new wartime quota system meant that crews had many landsmen from inshore who did not mix well with the career seamen, leading to discontented ships' companies.|$|E

25|$|In {{spite of}} the criticisms {{levelled}} against the Hawke Government, it succeeded in enacting {{a wide range of}} social reforms during its time in office. Deflecting arguments that the Hawke Government had failed as a reform government, Neville Wran, John Dawkins, Bill Hayden and Paul Keating made a number of speeches throughout the 1980s arguing that the Hawke Government had been a recognisably reformist government, drawing attention to Hawke's achievements as Prime Minister during his first five years in office. As well as the reintroduction of Medibank, under the new name Medicare, these included the doubling of the number of childcare places, the introduction of occupational superannuation, a boost in school retention rates, a focus on young people's job skills, a doubling of subsidised homecare services, the elimination of poverty traps in the welfare system, a 50% increase in public housing funds, an increase in <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>value</b> of the old-age pension, {{the development of a new}} youth support program, the reintroduction of six-monthly indexation of single-person unemployment benefits, and significant improvements in social security provisions. As pointed out by John Dawkins, the proportion of total government outlays allocated to families, the sick, single parents, widows, the handicapped, and veterans was significantly higher under the Hawke Government than under the Whitlam Government. In 1989, the Hawke Labor Government gradually re-introducing fees for university study. It set up the Higher Education Contributions Scheme (HECS), which was first proposed by Professor Murray Wells and subsequently developed by economist and lecturer at the Australian National University, Bruce Chapman and championed by Education Minister John Dawkins (see Dawkins Revolution). Under the original HECS, a $1,800 fee was charged to all university students, and the Commonwealth paid the balance. A student could defer payment of this HECS amount (in which case it was called a HECS debt) and repay the debt through the tax system, when the student's income exceeds a threshold level. As part of the reforms, Colleges of Advanced Education entered the University sector by various means. The HECS system was accepted by both federal political parties and has survived until today, though with a number of changes.|$|E

He notes that heroic human stories had been held to be superior to myth, but argues that myth has a special value: [...] "For myth is alive at once and in all its parts, and dies before it can be dissected."
