However, when the pride becomes too large, the next generation of female cubs may be forced to leave to eke out their own territory. Furthermore, when a new male lion takes over the pride, adolescent lions, both male and female, may be evicted.|$|E
5|$|The artist {{emerged in}} 1489 {{as part of}} the {{cultural}} world of Milan, beginning a successful career that turned him into a leading exponent of Renaissance sculpture in Brescia, distinguishing himself with works of cultural import such as his cycle of the Caesars for the Loggia palace in Brescia, as well as the Martinengo mausoleum. He introduced a powerful and highly expressive classical taste, as opposed to the hitherto existing refined decorativeness. During {{the first decade of the}} sixteenth century, Gasparo was able to win over public and private clients who sought to translate into stone <b>their</b> <b>pride</b> in their supposed historical descent from ancient Rome.|$|E
5|$|Merchants {{organised}} {{themselves into}} powerful guilds that transcended political divisions, allowing their operations {{to be largely}} unaffected by wars and revolutions. Their only threat was the possibility of theft from brigands when their ships and caravans traveled to distant lands. Powerful South Indian merchant guilds included the Manigramam, the Nagarattar and the Anjuvannam. Local guilds were called nagaram, while the Nanadesis were traders from neighbouring kingdoms who perhaps mixed business with pleasure. The wealthiest and most influential and celebrated of all South Indian merchant guilds was the self-styled Ainnurruvar, {{also known as the}} 500 Svamis of Ayyavolepura (Brahmins and Mahajanas of present-day Aihole), who conducted extensive land and sea trade and thereby contributed significantly to the total foreign trade of the empire. It fiercely protected its trade obligations (Vira Bananjudharma or law of the noble merchants) and its members often recorded their achievements in inscriptions (prasasti). Five hundred such excavated Prasasti inscriptions, with their own flag and emblem, the bull, record <b>their</b> <b>pride</b> in their business.|$|E

And for people all over the world, I am sure they too join with Americans in recognizing what an immense feat this is. Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man's world.

The evaluator of the exercises said the Bengali units performed well, <b>their</b> <b>pride</b> in representing East Pakistan a component of their success, and opposed their replacement with mixed regiments.|$|E
25|$|The Atlantic {{noted that}} Daenerys and Queen Cersei share the {{parallels}} of being forced into marriage, having powerful strengths of will, and being utterly ruthless toward their enemies. As bloodline and succession are the quickest and {{surest way to}} assert strength in Westeros, Cersei takes advantage of motherhood by procreating with her brother Jaime and having children fathered by her hated husband Robert aborted, thereby leaving him without a true heir in revenge. Martin said that Cersei's walk of public penitence in A Dance with Dragons may be read as misogynistic or feminist. Jane Shore, mistress of King Edward IV, was punished similarly after Edward's death. Cersei is defined by her pride, and this punishment was directed at women to break <b>their</b> <b>pride,</b> but was never inflicted on men.|$|E
25|$|Chad's eschatological {{consciousness}} {{and its effect}} on others is brought to life in a reminiscence attributed to Trumbert, who was one of his students at Lastingham. Chad used to break off reading whenever a gale sprang up and call on God to have pity on humanity. If the storm intensified, he would shut his book altogether and prostrate himself in prayer. During prolonged storms or thunderstorms he would go into the church itself to pray and sing psalms until calm returned. His monks obviously regarded this as an extreme reaction even to English weather and asked him to explain. Chad explained that storms are sent by God to remind humans of the day of judgement and to humble <b>their</b> <b>pride.</b> The typically Celtic Christian involvement with nature was not like the modern romantic preoccupation but a determination to read in it the mind of God, particularly in relation to the last things.|$|E

500|$|Religion is an {{important}} part of life for many of the peoples of Spira, with a large majority of the population describing themselves as [...] "Yevonites." [...] Though by the end of Final Fantasy X some people had begun to question them, nevertheless the teachings of Yevon were millennium-old and heavily influential. The Yevonite clergy taught that Sin was a divine punishment set upon the people for <b>their</b> <b>pride</b> in the use of machines. As a result, the temples forbade the use of modern technology, and promoted a culture of atonement for past sins in the hopes of appeasing sin.|$|E
500|$|Buhmaid's {{family said}} they were sad for his death, but <b>their</b> <b>pride</b> had {{overcome}} it. Appearing on the national TV, the crown prince authorized by his father, the king, offered unconditional dialogue with opposition. He offered [...] "condolences {{to the people of}} Bahrain for the painful days they are living" [...] and asked them to remain calm. Opposition activists demanded withdrawal of army and resignation of government for the dialogue to begin. [...] " [...] serious will for dialogue because the military is in the streets", said Matar Matar, resigned MP of Al Wefaq. The general labor union called for an indefinite general strike [...] "unless the army is pulled out from the streets and peaceful demonstrations are permitted".|$|E
500|$|The {{economic}} conditions facing {{the new government}} were dismal. Tens of thousands of Nova Scotians were impoverished and unemployed. The government expected that 75,000 Nova Scotians would need assistance during the coming winter. Biographer Stephen Henderson writes that Macdonald sympathized with the poor, but he worried that direct government relief payments would undermine <b>their</b> <b>pride</b> and self-respect. Even though direct relief might be cheaper, the Macdonald government preferred to hire the unemployed for public works projects such as paving roads. Henderson reports that in 1933, there were only [...] of paved roads in the province. By 1937, that figure had risen to 605. The government financed such public works by selling low-interest bonds and raising gasoline taxes from six to eight cents a gallon.|$|E

500|$|The {{second and}} third storylines are set in 1961, in the weeks prior to and {{following}} Trujillo's assassination on May 30. Each assassin has his own background story, explaining his motivation for {{his involvement in the}} assassination plot. Each has been wronged by Trujillo and his regime, by torture and brutality, or through assaults on <b>their</b> <b>pride,</b> religious faith, morality, and loved ones. Vargas Llosa weaves the tale of the men as memories recalled on the night of Trujillo's death, as the conspirators lie in wait for [...] "The Goat". Interconnected with these stories are the actions of other famous Trujillistas of the time: Joaquín Balaguer, the puppet president; Johnny Abbes García, the merciless head of the Military Intelligence Service (SIM); and various otherssome real, some composites of historical figures, and some purely fictional.|$|E
500|$|The Guardian {{declared}} the lake scene [...] "one {{of the most}} unforgettable moments in British TV history". The sequence also appeared in Channel 4's Top 100 TV Moments in 1999, between the controversial programme Death on the Rock and the Gulf War. The New York Times compared the scene to Marlon Brando shouting [...] "Stella!" [...] in his undershirt in A Streetcar Named Desire and Firth's projects began alluding to it [...] screenwriter-director Richard Curtis added in-joke moments of Firth's characters falling into the water to Love Actually and Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, and Firth's character from the 2007 film St Trinian's emerges from a fountain in a soaking wet shirt before meeting up with an old love. The creators of the 2008 ITV production Lost in Austen emulated the lake scene in <b>their</b> <b>Pride</b> and Prejudice through their contemporary heroine who cajoles Darcy into recreating the moment.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed entirely on {{location}} in Ghana {{as part of the}} BBC's [...] "Africa Lives" [...] season, exploring African culture for UK audiences. It was the second episode of Holby City filmed outside the UK, following a 2004 episode set in Paris. The serial continued to film one episode abroad annually until 2008, when BBC budget cuts curtailed further foreign filming. The Holby City crew spent five weeks in Elmina, using members of the local community in supporting roles. One crew member contracted malaria during filming, and several more were hospitalised. Both Quarshie and Potter expressed <b>their</b> <b>pride</b> at being part of the episode, with Quarshie deeming it his best work for the series. Adrian Edmondson guest-starred as surgeon Abra Durant, his first appearance in Holby City.

The song is a 'venting' record, where Tinie shares personal thoughts and then turns into a heavier finale. According to Tinie it was amended about 37 times due to constant adjustments and improvements. [...] "Lost Ones" [...] is about a couple splitting up but trying to maintain <b>their</b> <b>pride,</b> and then realising that in reality they do regret it. Paloma Faith recorded an [...] "eerie" [...] vocal for the chorus.
