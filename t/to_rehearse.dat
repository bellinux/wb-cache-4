5|$|After {{recording}} {{their second}} studio album Give 'Em Enough Rope (1978), the band {{separated from their}} manager Bernard Rhodes. This separation meant that the group had to leave their rehearsal studio in Camden Town and find another location to compose their music. Tour manager Johnny Green and drum roadie Baker had found the group a new place <b>to</b> <b>rehearse</b> called Vanilla Studios, which was located {{in the back of}} a garage in Pimlico.|$|E
5|$|Although all but Jonny {{had left}} Abingdon by 1987 to attend university, On a Friday {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>rehearse</b> {{on weekends and}} holidays. At the University of Exeter, Yorke played with the band Headless Chickens, performing songs including future Radiohead material, and met artist Stanley Donwood, who would later create artwork for the band. In 1991, On a Friday regrouped, sharing {{a house on the}} corner of Magdalen Road and Ridgefield Road, Oxford.|$|E

5|$|Prior to Brand New's {{official}} formation, in {{the late}} 1990s, Jesse Lacey, Garrett Tierney and Brian Lane were {{all members of the}} post-hardcore band The Rookie Lot, along with Brandon Reilly and Alex Dunne of Crime in Stereo. After the band's split and not playing together for a while, Lacey, Lane and Tierney started <b>to</b> <b>rehearse</b> again. After Reilly joined The Movielife, they then recruited guitarist Vincent Accardi, who had been playing in a band called One Last Goodbye.|$|E
5|$|So I {{went out}} and saw the band – Billy, James, and D'arcy – playing at Avalon with a drum machine. Man, did they sound horrible! They were atrocious. But the thing I noticed was that {{not only were the}} song {{structures}} good, but Billy's voice had a lot of drive to it, like he was dying to succeed. So I ended up driving from work every Wednesday <b>to</b> <b>rehearse</b> with them.|$|E
5|$|The {{group was}} {{struggling}} to find space <b>to</b> <b>rehearse</b> and perform by 1989. The Students' Building where Philaletheis had once performed had been transformed into the All Campus Dining Center and the old performance space was neither replaced nor replicated elsewhere on campus. To rememdy this, in 1993 and 1994, Vassar invested in the renovation {{of one of its}} disused buildings, a former functioning coal bin, into the Coal Bin Theater to be used by Philaletheis and the other student theatre and comedy groups that had been created by this time.|$|E

The band members got {{straight}} <b>to</b> <b>rehearsing</b> for their first gig, which was booked before the band had even started practicing.|$|R
50|$|In another experiment, by Brodie and Murdock, the recency {{effect was}} found to be {{partially}} responsible for the primacy effect. In their experiment, they also used the overt-rehearsal technique and found that in addition <b>to</b> <b>rehearsing</b> earlier items more than later items, participants were rehearsing earlier items later on in the list. In this way, earlier items were closer to the test period by way of rehearsal and could be partially explained by the recency effect.|$|R
50|$|Members of The Knights are composers, arrangers, singer-songwriters, and improvisers {{who bring}} {{a range of}} {{cultural}} influences to the group from baroque and classical performance practice to jazz and klezmer genres to pop and indie rock music. Every player contributes in the rehearsal process and each is committed <b>to</b> <b>rehearsing</b> the music {{as much as it}} deserves. This forum for radical inquiry and in-depth preparation serves as the foundation for The Knights, which is supported by the strong camaraderie built over years of friendship.|$|R
5|$|Although {{credited}} as an assistant, the film's art direction {{was done}} by Perry Ferguson. Welles and Ferguson got along during their collaboration. In the weeks before production began Welles, Toland and Ferguson met regularly to discuss the film and plan every shot, set design and prop. Ferguson would take notes during these discussions and create rough designs of the sets and story boards for individual shots. After Welles approved the rough sketches, Ferguson made miniature models for Welles and Toland to experiment on with a periscope in order <b>to</b> <b>rehearse</b> and perfect each shot. Ferguson then had detailed drawings made for the set design, including the film's lighting design. The set design {{was an integral part}} of the film's overall look and Toland's cinematography.|$|E
5|$|As the Canadians began {{preparations}} for an assault, the Germans {{were in the}} process of executing an assault plan of their own. The XIII (Royal Württemberg) Corps spent six weeks planning and carefully preparing their attack on the Mount Sorrel, Tor Top (Hill 62) and Hill 61 peaks. Their objective was to take control of the observation positions east of Ypres and keep as many British units as possible pinned down in the area, to avoid them transferring to the Somme front and assisting with the observed build-up in that area. The Germans constructed practice trenches resembling the Canadian positions near Tor Top <b>to</b> <b>rehearse</b> the assault, well behind their own lines.|$|E
5|$|Only {{days after}} the breakup, Tweedy decided {{to form a new}} group. He was able to retain the lineup of Uncle Tupelo sans Farrar, and rechristened the band Wilco. In mid-May, the band began <b>to</b> <b>rehearse</b> songs in the office of band manager Tony Margherita, and hired {{producer}} Brian Paulson, who produced Anodyne. Wilco first recorded demo tracks for the album at Easley studio in Memphis, Tennessee, in June. Stirratt recommended the studio based on previous experience as a member of The Hilltops, and Tweedy had heard of the studio through a Jon Spencer Blues Explosion recording. Reprise Records, a subsidiary of Warner Brothers, signed Jeff Tweedy after hearing the tapes, and recording for the album continued through August.|$|E

50|$|Soon {{after the}} {{recording}} sessions {{ended and the}} tracks were mixed in October 1973, the group got down <b>to</b> <b>rehearsing</b> for their upcoming world tour to promote the album. Spanning from 14 November 1973 to 21 August 1974, and including 100 live performances, it comprised four parts: Leg 1—North America (from 14 November 1973 to 18 December 1973, 28 shows), Leg 2—North America (from 24 January 1974 to 6 April 1974, 29 shows), Leg 3—Europe (from 18 April 1974 to 1 June 1974, 26 shows), and Leg 4—North America (from 26 July 1974 to 21 August 1974, 17 shows).|$|R
50|$|There can be {{differences}} in which {{younger and older}} children rehearse. Dempster (1981), reports that in younger children, they tend <b>to</b> only <b>rehearse</b> one item at a time. This helps them be able to remember the item without the clutter of other items. The developmental age of the child could {{also play a role}} in the number a child is able <b>to</b> remember and <b>rehearse.</b> The older a child is, the more items they can rehearse at once (Dempster, 1981).|$|R
5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov {{eventually}} became an excellent {{teacher and a}} fervent believer in academic training. He revised everything he had composed prior to 1874, even acclaimed works such as Sadko and Antar, {{in a search for}} perfection that would remain with him throughout the rest of his life. Assigned <b>to</b> <b>rehearse</b> the Orchestra Class, he mastered the art of conducting. Dealing with orchestral textures as a conductor, and making suitable arrangements of musical works for the Orchestra Class, led to an increased interest in the art of orchestration, an area into which he would further indulge his studies as Inspector of Navy Bands. The score of his Third Symphony, written just after he had completed his three-year program of self-improvement, reflects his hands-on experience with the orchestra.|$|E
5|$|Soon, Granville {{had a full}} {{orchestra}} at his disposal, so {{he convinced}} the management committee {{to allow him to}} give classical concerts on Fridays and Sundays. He then embarked on advanced concerts of new composers, as well as his own works. As he had difficulty finding time to practice these works, Bantock used afternoon sessions, in which he was supposed to play dance music, <b>to</b> <b>rehearse</b> his classical pieces. When the classical pieces spread to the afternoon programme, the management felt it was not commercially viable to continue the concerts. After three years at the tower, Bantock was appointed Principal of the School of Music at Birmingham and Midland Institute.|$|E
5|$|Turner only {{learned that}} Stacey was Archie's killer {{half an hour}} before the episode aired, in a bid by the {{production}} team to maintain the storyline's secrecy. 51 EastEnders cast members appeared in the episode, with several expressing trepidation about performing live prior to the broadcast. Cast members had two weeks <b>to</b> <b>rehearse</b> the episode, with one rehearsal filmed in case of any serious problems during transmission. When Turner fell ill with the flu on the day of broadcast, it was feared the producers may have needed to use the pre-recorded tape, but in the event she recovered enough to appear.|$|E

5|$|Davies {{travelled}} to United Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California on 11 April 1969, {{to produce}} American pop band The Turtles' LP Turtle Soup with engineer Chuck Britz. While in Los Angeles, Davies helped negotiate {{an end to}} the concert ban placed on the Kinks by the American Federation of Musicians in 1965. Although neither the Kinks nor the union gave a specific reason for the ban, {{at the time it was}} widely attributed to their rowdy on-stage behaviour. After negotiations with Davies, the Federation relented, opening up an opportunity for the group to return to touring in America. Once the main sessions for the Turtles LP were completed, Davies returned to England. While Davies was abroad, the other members of the band had been rehearsing and practising for the upcoming album, as well as lead guitarist Dave Davies' solo album, nicknamed A Hole in the Sock of. When Ray returned, the Kinks regrouped at his house in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, <b>to</b> <b>rehearse</b> the upcoming album Arthur.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} over approximately 10 weeks on a $20 million budget. Filming began in China in December 2010 in locations including the city of Shanghai and Hengdian World Studios, and continued until March 2011. Corey Yuen was the film's action choreographer. To compensate for time lost to filming issues, some scenes were filmed in a single take. Approximately 6 weeks into filming, RZA began pushing the crew to work faster to remain on schedule. His assistant director eventually informed RZA {{that because of the}} push, some stunt workers were injured and being sent to hospital. After this, RZA abandoned some of his intended shots and replaced them with Computer Generated Images (CGI). Roth also directed some shots for RZA. Crowe and Le were originally scripted to fight each other, but because of Crowe's limited shooting schedule, {{he did not have the}} time <b>to</b> <b>rehearse</b> the fight, and instead Le was scripted to fight Liu.|$|E
5|$|The {{starting}} point for the script was the ensemble cast of friends and previous collaborators Jarmusch had conceived characters for, while the tripartite formal structure of the film was inspired by his study of literary forms. Cinematographer Robby Müller and musician John Lurie were among the many contributors who had been involved in earlier Jarmusch projects and returned to work on the film. Mystery Trains US$2.8 million budget (financed by Japanese conglomerate JVC) was considerable compared to what the director had enjoyed before, and allowed him the freedom <b>to</b> <b>rehearse</b> many unscripted background scenes. It was the first of Jarmusch's feature films to depart from his trademark black-and-white photography, though the use of color was tightly controlled to conform with the director's intuitive sense of the film's aesthetic.|$|E

The following September, Kirshner left [...] "In Concert" [...] to produce and host his own syndicated weekly rock-concert program called Don Kirshner's Rock Concert. With its long-form live performances, as compared <b>to</b> <b>rehearsed,</b> often lip-synced performances that were the staple of earlier television shows like Shindig!, {{it was a new}} direction for pop music presentation. The last show aired in 1981, the year that MTV was launched.|$|R
50|$|Prior <b>to</b> <b>rehearsing</b> a concerto with an {{orchestra}}, a soloist will rehearse it with {{a pianist}} substituting for the parts played by the orchestra (thus, two pianists {{in the case of}} piano concerti or a violinist and pianist in preparation for a violin concerto). To help with tempo in orchestral, solo, or chamber rehearsals, a metronome may be used to sound out the tempo prior to the commencement of a piece. For musical performances, a dress rehearsal does not imply dressing in concert dress. It is a final rehearsal before performance where generally the ensemble will run through the program as if there were an audience. In some orchestras, there may be a limited audience during the dress rehearsal (typically university music students or other invited guests).|$|R
5|$|Chaplin then cast Florence D. Lee as the Blind Girl's {{grandmother}} and shot scenes with Cherrill and Lee for five weeks. In late 1929, Chaplin re-shot the first Flower Shop scene with Cherrill. This time, {{the scene was}} completed in six days and Chaplin was happy with Cherrill's performance. Chaplin had been shooting the film {{for a year and}} was only a little more than half way finished. From March to April 1930, Chaplin shot the scenes inside of the millionaire's house at the Town House on Wilshire Boulevard. He hired Joe Van Meter and Albert Austin, whom he had known since his days working for Fred Karno, as the burglars. In the late spring of 1930, Chaplin shot the last major comedy sequence: the boxing match. Chaplin hired Keystone actor Hank Mann to play the Tramp's opponent. The scene required 100 extras and Chaplin took four days <b>to</b> <b>rehearse</b> and six to shoot the scene and was shot between June 23 and 30. Chaplin was initially nervous over the attendance for this scene so he invited his friends to be extras. Over 100 extras were present. Chaplin’s performance in the scene was so humorous that more people arrived daily to be an extra.|$|E
5|$|The {{tour was}} subject to minor criticisms, at both the events {{surrounding}} the opening concerts in Barcelona, and the concerts in Dublin. When rehearsing for the tour in Barcelona, residents of the city complained about the band's noise after 10pm, which was the time until which the city allowed the band <b>to</b> <b>rehearse.</b> The setup of the band's stage for the Croke Park concerts in Dublin was criticised by fans for only allowing seating around part of the circular-shaped stage, taking away from the 360° seating configuration that was used at other venues. One fan claimed that only 270° of seating around the stage was being utilised for the three Dublin concerts, {{and that there was}} no reason that the stage could not be placed in the middle of the venue. Additional criticisms about the Croke Park shows arose from about 80 Dublin citizens, who protested against the Dublin City Council for allowing the band's crew to dismantle the stage in the middle of the night following the three concerts, due to the loud noises caused by the crew. The protest blocked several crew trucks from exiting the venue, putting the tour behind schedule, and tour promoter MCD Productions delivered a letter to the protesters informing them that they could be sued for any of the tour's financial losses due to the protest. In addition to the loudness of the band's crew, the Dublin City Council decided to withhold the band's €80,000 ($104,000) bond, after breaking the 75 decibel maximum volume at all three of the Dublin concerts.|$|E
