5|$|By mid-September 2015, <b>the</b> <b>global</b> {{stock of}} highway legal plug-in {{electric}} passenger cars and utility vans reached the one million sales milestone. Sales of plug-in electric vehicles achieved the one million milestone {{almost twice as}} fast as hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). While it took four years and 10 months to reach one-million PEV sales, it took more than around nine years and a few months for HEVs to reach its first million sales. <b>The</b> <b>global</b> ratio between all-electrics (BEVs) and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) has consistently been 60:40 between 2014 and the first half of 2016, mainly due to the large all-electric market in China. In the U.S. and Europe, the ratio is approaching a 50:50 split. All-electric cars have oversold plug-in hybrids, with pure electrics representing about 61% of <b>the</b> <b>global</b> stock of over 2million plug-ins on the world's roads by the end of 2016, up from 58.9% at the end of 2015.
