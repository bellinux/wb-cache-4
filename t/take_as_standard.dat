2500|$|The {{modern science}} of geology {{developed}} in the 18th century, the term [...] "geology" [...] itself was popularised by the Encyclopédie of 1751. Steno's categorisation of strata was expanded by several geologists, including Johann Gottlob Lehmann who believed that the oldest mountains had formed early in the Creation, and categorised as Flötz-Gebürge stratified mountains with few ore deposits but with thin layers containing fossils, overlain by a third category of superficial deposits. In his 1756 publication he identified 30 different layers in this category which he attributed to {{the action of the}} Genesis Deluge, possibly including debris from the older mountains. Others including Giovanni Arduino attributed secondary strata to natural causes: Georg Christian Füchsel said that geologists had to <b>take</b> <b>as</b> <b>standard</b> the processes in which nature currently produces solids, [...] "we know no other way", and only the most recent deposits could be attributed to a great Flood.|$|E
40|$|The past {{twenty-five years}} have seen an {{explosion}} of interest in nationalism and nationality {{in the social sciences}} – the past ten also in cultural studies. These two disciplinary areas define their objects of study differently, but both have recently started to converge in the pervasive use of the term ‘national identity’, which in turn relies on the term ‘cultural identity’. Although theoretical complications entailed by the use of ‘identity ’ as a concept have been noted, the theorization of identity as culture has occurred almost by default, with the term ‘culture ’ merely designating what needs to be explained, and the inherent circularity of ‘cultural identity ’ as a category remaining unaddressed. The two approaches differ in their under-standing of the crucial categories of ‘culture ’ and ‘politics ’ in their accounts of nation and national identity. Cultural studies accounts focus on politics in terms of cultural politics, and thus fail to take on board important aspects of the social science accounts which they <b>take</b> <b>as</b> <b>standard</b> reference points. Both approaches ultimately rely upon ‘culture ’ as an all-inclusive category of social subjectivity, which remains undertheorized in both approaches, albeit in significantly contrasting ways. The place of culture in recent work on European identity functions differently, and provides a useful counterpoint to these difficulties.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{influence}} of five cell nucleus populations <b>taken</b> <b>as</b> diploid <b>standards</b> {{with respect to the}} normalization of a human breast carcinoma. Four normal human tissues (lymphocytes, thyroid, liver, and bladder specimens) were <b>taken</b> <b>as</b> external <b>standards,</b> while the normal breast cells "contaminating" the tumor were <b>taken</b> <b>as</b> the internal diploid standard. Nuclear size and nuclear DNA assessments were performed by means of a cell image processor computing the parameters on Feulgen-stained nuclei from fresh imprint smears fixed in an ethanol-formalin-acetic acid mixture. Our results demonstrate that the choice of normal tissue <b>as</b> the diploid <b>standard</b> markedly influences the ploidy level of breast carcinoma. Normalization according to the lymphocytes led to our obtaining a major hyposextaploid G 0 -G 1 DNA peak in the breast cancer. Using thyroid and liver cells <b>as</b> a <b>standard,</b> we obtained a major pentaploid and sextaploid G 0 -G 1 peak, respectively. Using bladder cells or the normal contaminating breast cells within the tumor, we obtained a major tetraploid G 0 -G 1 peak. Finally, the normalization of the normal bladder cells against the liver cells led to our obtaining a near triploid bladder specimen. The reverse feature was also observed, e. g. the obtaining of biologically nonsensical hypodiploid liver cells after normalization against the normal bladder cells.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The term {{dementia}} {{refers to}} a severe loss of thinking abilities; especially memory. The most common kind of dementia is Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Bacopa monnieri and Withania somnifera are the most potent herbs {{for the treatment of}} loss of memory. Piper nigrum Linn. is essential ingredients of numerous prescriptions and formulations. It is reported that Black pepper increases the blood levels of drugs more than 100 %.
