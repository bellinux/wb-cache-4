40|$|To {{determine}} the optimum nitrogen application level {{required for the}} production of good quality ‘Drumhead’ cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata) transplants, a glasshouse experiment was conducted. Depending on water requirements, transplants were fertigated every two days (for the first four weeks) and every day (for the last two weeks) by floating trays in plastic tubs containing nutrient solution at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 mg•L- 1 N until field capacity was reached. Increasing nitrogen from 0 to 120 mg•L- 1 increased shoot and root mass of cabbage transplants with more dry mass being partitioned to the shoot than to the roots. Nitrogen at 120 mg•L- 1 N produced greatest fresh and dry shoot mass, plant height, leaf area, leaf tissue nitrogen, net assimilation rate, relative growth rate and leaf mass ratio. Nitrogen at 90 mg•L- 1 improved dry root mass, pulling success, specific leaf area and leaf area ratio. Greatest values of root: shoot ratio and root mass ratio were obtained at 0 mg•L- 1 N. Nitrogen at 90 mg•L- 1 was best as it produced transplants with more vigorous root growth which pulled out easily from the seedling trays. To {{determine the}} best combination of spacing and nitrogen top-dressing for improved cabbage production under local conditions, a field experiment was conducted. Cabbage ‘Copenhagen Market’ transplants were spaced at 30 x 50 cm, 40 x 50 cm or 50 x 50 cm and fertilized with nitrogen as top-dressing at 50, 100 or 150 kg•ha- 1 N applied in two splits (fourth and eighth week after transplanting). There were no interactions between spacing and nitrogen top-dressing for all measured variables. Nitrogen and spacing did not influence dry matter production and leaf tissue nitrogen. Furthermore, spacing did not affect core height and yield (per unit area) of <b>trimmed</b> cabbage <b>heads.</b> Nitrogen at 100 kg•ha- 1 produced the greatest head mass and yield for untrimmed cabbage heads. The 30 x 50 cm spacing produced the highest yield of untrimmed heads while 50 x 50 cm spacing produced heavier <b>heads.</b> For <b>trimmed</b> <b>heads,</b> 100 kg•ha- 1 N again produced the greatest head mass, head diameter, head height, core diameter and yield. Spacing did not affect the yield for <b>trimmed</b> <b>heads.</b> However, 40 x 50 cm spacing improved head diameter, head height and head mass while core diameter was larger with 50 x 50 cm spacing. The split application of 100 kg•ha- 1 N as top-dressing was best for head mass and yield (per unit area) for <b>trimmed</b> and untrimmed <b>heads.</b> Choice of spacing would depend on whether <b>trimmed</b> or untrimmed <b>heads</b> are targeted.

40|$|The {{results of}} {{nutritional}} investigations made on head lettuce are presented. Sand cultures involving {{the use of}} twenty-seven different nutrient solutions, including three levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, and their various combinations, were used.

Yield records of tops, <b>trimmed</b> <b>heads,</b> and roots, based on green weight and oven-dried weight values, were tabulated and analyzed statistically. Observations on development of tipburn were examined. It was shown that increasing the nitrogen concentration produced increases in yield up to a critical level, beyond which a deleterious effect was noted. Over {{a wide range of}} concentrations, additional phosphorus gave continued increases in yield. Additional potassium did not have a significantly positive effect on yield. In the tipburn studies, high levels of nutrients encouraged burning. Nitrogen appears {{to be the most important}} single element. Practically all the burning took place in darkness.

40|$|Conventional {{stripping}} of burley {{tobacco is}} labor intensive and typically requires 50 to 75 worker hours per acre (wkr•hr/ac). The {{goal of the}} project was to reduce labor by optimizing leaf removal by string <b>trimmer</b> <b>heads</b> using combinations of strings lengths and motor speeds. In tests conducted on a single grade, all leaves outside the grade were removed by hand. Plants were run through the machine for sting lengths of 5, 7 and 9 inches and associated motor speeds which were monitored and recorded. Stripping efficiencies were calculated for each plant and collectively for each set of four plants. The machine was then tested for three grade stripping efficiency. Particle size analysis tests were run to determine potential losses due to leaf shredding. Efficiencies for single grade testing ranged from 93 to 96 % for optimal string length and speed combinations. Stripping three grades by machine resulted in an average of 97 % efficiency. Potential losses due to shredding accounted for 5. 6 % of the total weight mechanically removed. It is believed that this stripping concept, implemented on a full scale four grade basis, coul...|$|R
40|$|Thin-film yoke-type magnetoresistive (MR) tape {{heads with}} eight {{channels}} {{have been used}} for scanning magnetoresistance microscopy. The NiFe read flux guides of the channels have been trimmed down from 12 ¿m to widths varying between 5 ¿m and 100 nm by focused ion-beam milling with Ga+ ions. The tape-bearing surface of the milled regions has been reconstructed in situ by the local deposition of Pt. Tracks with a minimum bit length of 1 ¿m have been written on Co-Ni-O metal evaporated tape and Co-¿-Fe 2 O 3 particulate tape with trimmed and untrimmed write channels and have been successfully imaged with all the trimmed read channels. A linear decrease in readback voltage across the MR sensor is observed for channels possessing flux guides trimmed down to 2 ¿m, in agreement with finite-element modeling of the <b>trimmed</b> <b>heads.</b> The severe attenuation in readback voltage observed for flux guides trimmed below 2 ¿m is attributed to a combination of micromagnetic effects.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the susceptibility of dentin to brushing abrasion using four different toothbrushes (rotating-oscillating, sonic and two types of manual toothbrushes) with the same brushing forces. Dentin samples (n = 72) were selected from 72 impacted third molars. Half of the surface of dentin samples was covered with an adhesive tape, creating a protected and a freely exposed area in the same specimen. Brushing was performed with either a: sonic (Sonicare PowerUp, Philips GmbH, Hamburg, Germany), b: oscillating-rotating (Oral B Vitality Precisions Clean, Procter & Gamble, Schwalbach am Taunus, Germany) or two different manual toothbrushes c: flat <b>trim</b> brush <b>head</b> toothbrush (Dr. Best: Original, Glaxo-Smith-Kline, Bühl, Germany) and d: rippled-shaped brush head toothbrush (Blend-a-Dent, Complete V-Interdental, Blend-a-med, Schwalbach, Germany) in a custom made automatic brushing machine. The brushing force was set to 2 N and a whitening toothpaste (RDA = 150) was used. The simulation period was performed over a calculated period to mimic a brushing behavior of two times a day brushing for eight years and six months. Dentin loss was quantitatively determined by profilometry and statistically analyzed by Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney-U Test (p < 0. 05). The mean (standard deviation) surface loss was 21. 03 (± 1. 26) μm for the sonic toothbrush, 15. 71 (± 0. 85) μm for the oscillating-rotating toothbrush, 6. 13 (± 1. 24) μm for the manual toothbrush with flat <b>trim</b> brush <b>head</b> and 2. 50 (± 0. 43) μm for the manual toothbrush with rippled-shaped brush head.

5000|$|Robertson, {{also known}} as a square, or Scrulox [...] screw drive has a {{square-shaped}} socket in the screw head and a square protrusion on the tool. Both the tool and the socket have a taper, which makes inserting the tool easier, and also tends to help keep the screw on the tool tip without the user needing to hold it there. (The taper's earliest reason for being was to make the manufacture of the screws practical using cold forming of the heads, but its other advantages helped popularize the drive.) Robertson screws are commonplace in Canada, though they have been used elsewhere [...] and have become much more common in other countries in recent decades. Robertson screwdrivers are easy to use one-handed, because the tapered socket tends to retain the screw, even if it is shaken. They also allow for the use of angled screw drivers and <b>trim</b> <b>head</b> screws. The socket-headed Robertson screws are self-centering, reduce cam out, stop a power tool when set, and can be removed if painted-over or old and rusty. In industry, they speed up production and reduce product damage. One of their first major industrial uses was the Ford Motor Company's Model A & Model T production. Henry Ford found them highly reliable and saved considerable production time, but when he couldn't secure licensing for them in the United States, limited their production use to his Canadian division. Robertson-head screwdrivers are available in a standard range of tip-sizes, from 1.77mm to 4.85mm. Reed and Prince, also called Frearson, is another historic cross-head screw configuration. The cross in the screw head is sharper and less rounded than a Phillips, and the bit has 45° flukes and a sharper, pointed end. Also, the Phillips screw slot is not as deep as the Reed and Prince slot. In theory, different size R&P screws fit any R&P bit size.|$|R

50|$|In early times, it is {{most likely}} Roman men wore their hair long. With the {{introduction}} of barbers called tonsors in about 300 BCE it became customary to wear hair short. In Ancient Rome, household slaves would perform hairdressing functions for wealthy men. However, men who lacked access to private hairdressing and shaving services or those who preferred a more social atmosphere went to a barbershop (tonstrina). Barbershops were places of social gatherings and a young man’s first shave was often even celebrated as a passage to manhood in the community. The barbers usually shaved the customers faces with iron razors and applied an aftershave with ointments that may have contained spider webs. <b>Trimming</b> a <b>head</b> of hair and shaving would be the rule in Rome {{in the second century}} BCE.
