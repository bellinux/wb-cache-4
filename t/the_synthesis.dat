5|$|By the mid 1950s, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of economists had ceased debating Keynesianism and accepted <b>the</b> <b>synthesis</b> view; however, room for disagreement remained. <b>The</b> <b>synthesis</b> attributed problems with market clearing to sticky prices that failed to adjust to changes in supply and demand. Another group of Keynesians focused on disequilibrium economics and tried to reconcile the concept of equilibrium with the absence of market clearing.|$|E
5|$|Economists {{incorporated}} the theoretical work from <b>the</b> <b>synthesis</b> into large-scale macroeconometric models that combined individual equations for {{factors such as}} consumption, investment, and money demand with empirically observed data. This line of research reached its height with the MIT-Penn-Social Science Research Council (MPS) model developed by Modigliani and his collaborators. MPS combined IS/LM with other aspects of <b>the</b> <b>synthesis</b> including the neoclassical growth model and the Phillips curve relation between inflation and output. Both large-scale models and the Phillips curve became targets for critics of <b>the</b> <b>synthesis.</b>|$|E

50|$|Biologists {{disagree}} {{on the need for}} an extended synthesis. Opponents contend that <b>the</b> modern <b>synthesis</b> is able to fully account for the newer observations, while proponents think that the conceptions of evolution at the core of <b>the</b> modern <b>synthesis</b> are too narrow. Proponents argue that even when <b>the</b> modern <b>synthesis</b> allows for <b>the</b> ideas in <b>the</b> extended <b>synthesis,</b> using <b>the</b> modern <b>synthesis</b> affects <b>the</b> way that biologists think about evolution. For example, Denis Noble says that using terms and categories of <b>the</b> modern <b>synthesis</b> distort <b>the</b> picture of biology that modern experimentation has discovered.
