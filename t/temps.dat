5|$|Jean-Claude Mézières {{himself has}} worked as a concept artist on a number of science fiction film projects. The first of these was in 1984 for {{director}} Jeremy Kagan who was attempting to adapt René Barjavel's novel La Nuit des <b>temps</b> (The Ice People). The film was never made. This was followed, in 1985, by a proposed adaptation of Arkady and Boris Strugatsky's novel Hard to Be a God for director Peter Fleischmann. This film was eventually finished in 1989 though Mézières' concepts for the film were barely used. The art Mézières produced for both projects was later published in Mézières Extras.|$|E

Tzara {{was the subject}} of an 1949 eponymous documentary film directed by Danish filmmaker Jørgen Roos, and footage of him featured prominently in the 1953 production Les statues meurent aussi ("Statues Also Die"), jointly directed by Chris Marker and Alain Resnais.|$|E
5|$|The French media {{reported}} {{little on}} the event as it happened, and relatively little mention of the nationalist struggle was mentioned in Les <b>Temps</b> Modernes, the leftist publication that would become considered the leading anti-colonial advocate after {{the launch of the}} French offensive in Indochina. Other private publications served as forums for the Francophone intelligentsia to express their condemnation of the French government's response to the Uprising. The most commentary appeared in the left-leaning Catholic monthly L'Esprit, with criticisms also published in other leftist publications like Humanité, Combat, Franc-tireur and Témoignage Chrétien. Albert Camus penned a seething rebuke of the French colonial administration that was published on 10 May 1947 in Combat. Very few details of the rising and subsequent repression were reported at the time outside France.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} the result of a study on <b>temp</b> agency workers and on the role that <b>temp</b> agency work played in company’s {{staffing}} strategies and on industry and national regulations regarding <b>temp</b> agencies and <b>temp</b> agency work. It was conducted in 2004 - 2006, as part of a larger project on low wage work in the Netherlands, which was part of a five country study for the Russell Sage Foundation, USA. In order to provide a background for understanding temporary agency work, recent developments in and the various forms of external numerical flexibility in the Netherlands are sketched first. The temporary agency market apparently is well equipped to provide services for firms’ demands for flexible labor. The largest volume of <b>temp</b> work through agencies includes rather low-skilled jobs for manufacturing, transport, cleaning and administrative work, although most large <b>temp</b> work agencies also maintain specialized departments for outsourcing nurses, secretaries, managers, and other professional medical or technical staff. If one relates the 2004 figures to the Dutch dependent workforce at large, <b>temp</b> agency workers made up 6. 0 percent (head-count) of that workforce, and 4. 5 percent in FTEs. In firms using <b>temp</b> agency workers, on average 7 percent of the workforce recently was made up of <b>temp</b> agency workers. Major motives for companies to hire <b>temp</b> agency workers are peaks in production, mostly predictable peaks, as well as replacement of staff falling ill. As for the regulatory regime, in the late 1990 s, two species of legislation were introduced that are of relevance here. The Flexibility and Security (‘Flexicurity’) Act of 1999, replacing the 1965 law, is most important for the regulation of employment relationships in and by <b>temp</b> work agencies. The 1998 WAADI Act regulates the <b>temp</b> agency product market, and abolished the former license system, although the government kept the option open to reinstate such a system ‘in the interest of good relations on the labour market or the interests of the personell concerned’. For <b>temp</b> work agencies the main implication of the new law was that agreements between them and employees were to be employment contracts. As <b>temp</b> work agencies are assumed to bear employer responsibility, this may lead to larger security for <b>temp</b> agency workers. <b>Temp</b> agency workers are for the larger part covered by a collective agreement, concluded by General Federation Temporary Work Agencies - ABU with the major trade unions. After mandatory extension, about 94 percent of the <b>temp</b> agency workers were covered by an agreement. For typologies of <b>temp</b> agency workers on employment status and education we have analysed the 2004 data of the WageIndicator, collected via a web-based survey addressing the labor force in the Netherlands. The analyses show that 1. 7 percent of the observations concerned a <b>temp</b> agency worker. Of this group, one out of ten indicated to be a school pupil or student. Another five percent was a housewife/man with a job on the side, partly disabled, unemployed, or working without loss of unemployment benefits. <b>Temp</b> agency work is often associated with people with a weak position in the labour market, but it appeared that <b>temp</b> agency workers did not significantly differ from other workers with regard to their years of education, although they more often had enjoyed general education instead of vocational education. <b>Temp</b> agency workers are typically young workers, as they proved to be relatively younger than the workforce of any other large branch of industry. Compared with their share in the total Dutch workforce, migrant workers, from western or from non-western origin, are comparatively more often employed via <b>temp</b> work agencies. ...|$|R
