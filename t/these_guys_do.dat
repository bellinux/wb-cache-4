Now {{widely regarded as the}} most influential fight in MMA history, the bout took place in what was the first ever MMA event on live and free television.

Regarding the success of the show, UFC president Dana White said, [...] "It's amazing to think.... how close we came to not being here today.

50|$|Publick: I {{think you}} and I are both sick of every {{interview}} mentioning the “It’s a show about failure” from five years ago. I don’t think we made {{a conscious effort to}} fight that or anything, but every year, we push what we do as writers a little more. An area we hadn’t gone into very much was positivity. I mean, all our victories are still satiric, but there are definitely places where we said, “I want to see <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> <b>do</b> something. I don’t want to just have everything fall on its face all the time.|$|E
5000|$|According to {{director}} Neil Leifer, {{he aimed}} {{to show how}} hard it was to film the game, stating, And I probably didn't succeed in one thing that I wanted to do.

If I could re-edit it I would probably make that point, even just to show what it's like to go from the hotel to the stadium. But that doesn't make a good story.

He had just come off the critically acclaimed Dance Me Outside and friends warned him not to repeat himself by making another road movie.

I try every week to find something to motivate myself and I know <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> <b>do</b> the same thing. It’s hard to keep yourself motivated and continue to perform at a high level. Being able to do it for three years now says a lot about the character of this team and the things that they do.

5000|$|When {{asked if}} the series would deal with the new Batman being unable to fill Bruce Wayne's proverbial shoes, Morrison answered, [...] "When I started out I had that in mind, and I thought we'd finally prove that nobody else could be Batman. But I do believe certain aspects of RIP were about how nobody but this guy could be Batman. I think with this, it's fun to start by seeing what happens when someone else tries. Sometimes it goes wrong, and {{sometimes}} it goes really well. Some of the things <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> <b>do</b> are things that Bruce Wayne would never have thought to do." [...] In regards to using Frank Quitely as the opening artist, Morrison described the difference between this particular collaboration with previous ones, specifically on JLA Earth-2 and All-Star Superman. For instance, Morrison asked Quitely to choreograph {{the flow of the}} action in his own way, rather than through Morrison's normally heavily detailed scripts.|$|E

That's the importance to the public in this.

50|$|In 2001 at a British Wrestling Federation show, {{prior to}} the doors opening, Kid Krazy was {{approached}} {{by a member of}} the company requesting that he meet with the promoter. Krazy was escorted indoors to the hall where the ring was set up and wrestlers were warming up. Whilst BWF wrestlers Justin Starr and Andy Flyer warmed up, the promoter asked Krazy if he could wrestle and do what <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> <b>do.</b> Krazy responded that he could and was asked to get in the ring. Wrestling veteran Drew McDonald slammed Krazy off the top turnbuckle, suplexed him and clotheslined him to the canvas. The Promoter looked on and then discussed what he had just seen with Drew McDonald. The Promoter offered Kid Krazy the opportunity to join the BWF tour and train on the road. Kid Krazy would go on the road with BWF, help set up and dismantle the ring, learn the ropes of professional wrestling and receive tuition from the likes of Drew McDonald, Andy Flyer, Alan Kilby and others.|$|E
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Sean Westergaard says [...] "Gold Sounds is an {{overwhelming}} success, {{not just as}} a tribute but as a jazz album ... If you're a Pavement fan, you owe it to yourself to check out what <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> <b>do</b> with the songbook. If you're a jazz fan, forget that these tunes come from the world of indie rock; in the hands of Carter and Chestnut, they might as well be undiscovered standards". On All About Jazz Michael McCaw noted [...] "Gold Sounds doesn't give you everything the first time around. Like Pavement's recordings, what may seem complete is only a portion of the melody and musical ideas to which you ultimately want to return, because each time they hook you in a different way. In the end, the album provides a meaty dose of jazz that is as infectious as the pop from which it is derived". In JazzTimes Brent Burton was less enthusiastic noting [...] "a big hunk of the covers disc is, simply put, rather anonymous sounding, which leaves listeners with the quartet's somewhat cheesy conception of what it means to--gulp--rock".|$|E
5000|$|Mark Harris of Upstart Magazine commended the {{production}} quality, {{saying it was}} [...] "the most tightly composed material the duo has ever created". Harris {{pointed out that the}} duo's maturity as performers was showing, noting that although it made their material less crass, it allowed them to stray from being a [...] "one punchline joke". Callum Thomson of Hit The Floor magazine gave the album a 9/10 and said that [...] "it’s everything you should expect from these two masters of comedic music by now". Steven Hyden from The A.V. Club gave the album a B+ and concluded with [...] "No joke: Rize of the Fenix is one of the year's most enjoyable hard-rock records." [...] As of May, the community grade by users is B. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic gave a score of 4 out of 5 stars and said [...] "Rize of the Fenix does amount to a rousing comeback for Tenacious D: they're back to their old tricks, oblivious to whether the world at large actually cares about their shenanigans". Ryan Reed from Paste magazine gave the album an 8.3/10 and praised a number of songs, such as the title song for being [...] "so powerful, so perfect, so representative of what <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> <b>do</b> well" [...] and [...] "The Ballad of Hollywood Jack and the Rage Kage" [...] for being [...] "another classic" [...] which [...] "could be taken at face-value as a legitimate betrayal-redemption story", although mentioning that the writing style for the other songs [...] "seems to suggest the assistance of a computer-based Rock Generator, with tunes that feel more like templates".|$|E
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Sean Westergaard awarded the album 4 stars stating [...] "This {{is really a}} great setting to hear what <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> can <b>do</b> as soloists, with the easy-to-follow changes of the blues and stripped-down ensemble. Luqman Ali's {{drumming}} is the anchor, and everyone gets plenty of solo space. Fans of John Gilmore should surely seek this out, but Michael Ray and Sun Ra are also simply fantastic".|$|R
5000|$|Carl Edwards {{scored the}} pole {{for the race}} {{with a time of}} 14.991 and a speed of 127.997 mph. He said {{afterwards}} that winning the pole was [...] "just awesome. This place is really complicated and my <b>guys</b> <b>did</b> a good job making the car drive well on all different segments.” Matt Kenseth, who qualified second, said that he was [...] "just a little off. <b>These</b> <b>guys</b> <b>did</b> a great job with our Dollar General Camry today. Obviously, all of the JGR cars were fast again so thanks to everyone who’s building these things and TRD (Toyota Racing Development) with the engines. In the first round we were pretty good we thought and then the second round we tried something and we were too tight and then the third round we were a little too loose really. We were just that much off, but overall it was a great day and we’ll still get a good pit stop and {{a good place to start}} and hopefully we’ll get it driving good tomorrow and we can race them on Sunday.” During round 1, Ty Dillon got loose exiting turn 3 and slammed into the back of Landon Cassill.|$|R

I had just gotten into town, we went filming that night, I got every, I pulled {{everything}} out of the car, set up the lights, did the generators and all this. We lit up this ledge. One of the filmers, Matt Eversole, was grumpy cause he didnt wanna go filming. theres a bunch of us about to skate and dude takes a fucking piss, on the ledge; it was a painted ledge.

Todd described the concert [...] "Marc sang, maybe for the last time, that song. These musicians' incredible generosity was so phenomenal. There {{was a time when}} Marc thought nobody cared about his music. But he was amazed by what all <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> were <b>doing,</b> and it got to him in an incredible way." ...|$|R
5000|$|Robert Abele of the Los Angeles Times {{called it}} [...] "a movie {{streamlined}} {{to evoke the}} timeless zip of martial arts movies past" [...] and praised the [...] "refreshingly grounded and old-school kinetic" [...] action. Sheila O'Malley, writing at RogerEbert.com, also praised the [...] "thrilling immediacy" [...] of the fight scenes: [...] "you realize you are actually seeing <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> actually <b>do</b> this, as opposed to watching something pieced together later in the editing room". Dave McGinn of the Globe and Mail, in contrast, called the film [...] "ambitious but generic" [...] and filled with [...] "stale conventions".|$|R
5000|$|Music critic Mark Deming, {{writing for}} AllMusic, stated: [...] "The scrappy enthusiasm that fueled the BoDeans' best music {{has given way}} to a more {{measured}} and mature sound in the 21st century, but Sam Llanas and Kurt Neuman are still capable of rocking a bit when they feel like it (cue up 'Lucille' for a taste), and the emotional ardor that's always made itself known in their songwriting is as clear and present as ever... Still is well worth a listen for BoDeans fans, but it falls a few notches short of what <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> can <b>do</b> when they're hitting their stride." ...|$|R
5000|$|Matt Heafy of Trivium {{called it}} one of his {{favorite}} albums and said [...] "This has been a hugely influential album on me, and they’re a band that I feel are way underrated. They’re a band so many people haven’t heard about but this album is truly a gem. Everyone’s putting technical and jazz elements of things like virtuoso guitarist Allan Holdsworth in there, but <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> were <b>doing</b> it before all of them and Martyr don’t do it for the sake of it, they do it for the sake of new sounding songs. The band incorporate jazz, thrash, death and tech and so much more. They really have their own sound." ...|$|R
5000|$|Aaron Weisburd, {{who founded}} Internet Haganah, criticized the term, writing: [...] "The {{problem is that}} the term jihobbyist conveys the notion that <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> are not serious, that they do not {{constitute}} a threat. In fact what <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> are <b>doing</b> is marking time while waiting for the opportunities and associations to appear {{that will allow them to}} become real jihadis." [...] Brachman responded by saying, in part, [...] "term jihobbyist is potentially useful in that it introduces shades of grey into the discussion: it acknowledges that people can support al-Qaida and wish death upon Americans, without ever ‘joining up’ officially", and that [...] "The term, 'Jihobbyism,' also runs the risk of creating a false dichotomy between those who 'do' and those who 'talk.' The premise is flawed because 'talking' is a form of 'doing.' It may be less immediate in its consequences, but as we’ve learned, talking can actually be more dangerous than blowing stuff up: talking can serve as a force multiplier".|$|R
5000|$|I {{walked up}} and saw <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> <b>doing</b> strange things ... Setting fire to the hootches and huts and waiting {{for people to come}} out and then {{shooting}} them ... going into the hootches and shooting them up ... gathering people in groups and shooting them ... As I walked in you could see piles of people all through the village ... all over. They were gathered up into large groups. I saw them shoot an M79 launcher into {{a group of people who}} were still alive. But it was mostly done with a machine gun. They were shooting women and children just like anybody else. We met no resistance and I only saw three captured weapons. We had no casualties. It was just like any other Vietnamese village - old papa-sans, women and kids. As a matter of fact, I don't remember seeing one military-age male in the entire place, dead or alive. One group of 20-50 villagers was walked to the south of Xom Lang and killed on a dirt road. According to Ronald Haeberle's eyewitness account of the massacre, in one instance, [...] There were some South Vietnamese people, maybe fifteen of them, women and children included, walking on a dirt road maybe [...] away. All of a sudden the GIs just opened up with M16s. Beside the M16 fire, they were shooting at the people with M79 grenade launchers ... I couldn't believe what I was seeing.|$|R
2500|$|Speaking in January 2010 to noted UK soul writer Pete Lewis of {{the award-winning}} Blues & Soul, Fakir {{confirmed}} {{plans for the}} [...] "new" [...] Four Tops to release a new album, while revealing his personal feelings about the current line-up: [...] "To me the new group is like {{an extension of the}} family, because we've all been very close for so many years... Which makes it easier for ME, because I truly miss Lawrence, [...] "Obie" [...] AND Levi - I'd be lying if I said I didn't - and not one of them could EVER be replaced. But, you know, <b>these</b> new <b>guys</b> <b>do</b> perform well enough for the people to still enjoy the shows and still enjoy the music. So for me, it kinda makes it bittersweet. Because, {{at the end of the}} day, the legacy is still going on and I'm very pleased that it IS!" ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{other five}} {{were arrested in}} Lackawanna, New York, a suburb of Buffalo, New York in September 2002. On September 14, 2002, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) {{held a press conference}} in Buffalo to {{announce}} the arrests of five of the local Al Qaeda suspects. The FBI Special Agent in charge of the investigation, Peter Ahearn (At the time head of the FBI's Buffalo Field Office), stated that there was no specific event triggering the arrests, which followed four to eight months of investigations. Later, FBI counterterrorism chief Dale Watson told The New York Times that the bureau acted as [...] "we are probably 99 percent sure that we can make sure <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> don't <b>do</b> something - if they are planning to do something." [...] Watson paraphrased the President's response as that [...] "under the rules that we were playing under at the time, that's not acceptable. So a conscious decision was made, 'Let's get 'em out of here'." ...|$|R
5000|$|Fielding later {{recalled}} {{the reasons for}} doing this: [...] "So a couple of jazz guys formed little bands, not to go in buses on the road, but to record with, do a few weekends at the Palladium, just rehearse, and keep the thing going. We were doing it for each other, really. And the first records I made—that’s what they were. Frank had put a band together for the Palladium: and I said: “If he can do it, I can do it.” I had five radio shows at the time: so we put this bunch together, and we started to do some wild things. ... In that band were Conrad Gozzo, Sam Donahue, Shelly Manne, Johnny Williams, Buddy Collette, Red Callender—everybody. I knew what <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> could <b>do,</b> and I wrote to the absolute limit of their abilities, which no one else did. We did some spectacular performances. Albert Marks recorded {{us a couple of}} times, and those are the early Trend records which are such collector’s items now. I think they were collector’s items the day they went in the store; they never really sold well." ...|$|R
500|$|Mars {{explained}} the meaning behind the album's title {{by saying that}} {{it had become a}} [...] "soulful, experimental, electronic, hard-to-explain" [...] concept. In order to record an album like that, it was—according to him—mandatory to experiment and not follow any known pattern, resulting the guests enlisted for the record to be unexpected. According to the singer, jazz artist Esperanza Spalding and Diplo were among them. Furthermore, the [...] "pop's most innovative producers" [...] (Bhasker, Haynie and Ronson) had to be taken [...] "beyond their comfort zone". While being interviewed for his Billboard Artist of the Year cover story, Mars complimented Ronson and Bhasker by explaining that [...] "it's not about what's hot on the radio or the fastest way to make a buck, <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> are fearless, <b>doing</b> the music they want to do". Mars additionally felt that [...] "when there are no safe bets, that's when [...] blood move." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "We're brave, we're {{not afraid}} to do stuff, most people are. They're deathly afraid to do {{anything}} different.... When everybody else {{was talking about how}} stupid country music was, country music was the last thing to like, if you wore a cowboy hat you were a redneck, you know, we decided go say, 'Yeah, we play country music, it's fun.'"Up in San Francisco, KUSF Wave, their magazine, did the first review Rank and File ever got, live review. They said we sucked, and then they said, 'What are <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> trying to <b>do,</b> start a trend?' Well, that's the way it worked out, but only because we were brave enough and smart enough to do it first. That's how you get to be influential—if you're brave enough to do something different and you're smart enough to do it right. Otherwise you're just another dumb-ass band." ...|$|R
