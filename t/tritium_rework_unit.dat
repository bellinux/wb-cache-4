In this study, we investigate {{the relationship between these}} tectonic features and the flexural rigidity of the lithosphere in Cameroon, in terms of effective elastic thickness (Te), by the use of the coherence function analysis. For that purpose, we use a new dataset of- 32, 000 gravity and topography points from Cameroon and the adjacent countries. The Te contour map deduced from this study shows a good relationship between the tectonic provinces and the rigidity of the lithosphere, the minima (14 - 20 km) are beneath the active rifted and volcanic areas (Benue, CVL, and Adamawa), and the maxima (- 40 km) correspond to the Archean <b>reworked</b> <b>unit</b> in Congo. A spectral analysis of the gravity data is performed to determine the crust-mantle boundary in these tectonic provinces. The crustal thickness (Tc) contour map shows a variation from 14 km to about 45 km, consistent with other geophysical data. The lower values (14 - 20 km) are obtained in central Cameroon on the Adamawa uplift, and the highest values are found in southern Cameroon (Archean reworked Congolese craton). Comparing Te and Tc values shows that there is generally a positive correlation between the two parameters, with an exception in Chad where this correlation is rather negative...|$|R

We also assume as it is true in most real world situation that the <b>unit</b> <b>rework</b> processing cost need not to be equal to unit normal processing cost. We consider the case in which during a specified period of time consisting of several cycles the rework process takes place only in its last cycle.

For this purpose we assume in the last cycle of this period first the normal production starts after which the rework of all defective units produced in the period begins.

40|$|Published online: 30 Apr 2013 The Wet Cave {{vertebrate}} fossil {{deposit of}} the Naracoorte Caves in south-eastern South Australia contains {{a rich and}} diverse assemblage of small mammal fauna known to span the Upper Pleistocene–Holocene. Here, we describe five previously unidentified in situ units (A, B, C, E and F) and one likely <b>reworked</b> <b>unit</b> (D) in the Wet Cave sedimentary profile, which are correlated with paleoclimatic conditions associated with the Last Glacial Cycle. Additional radiocarbon dates presented here provide a finer temporal resolution for the upper sections of the sequence than previously available and reveal rapid deposition of polished quartz sands laminated with brown silts during the last glacial maximum (LGM). Change in sediment type and depositional processes are dated from 16. 8 to 16. 4 k cal y BP and {{are associated with the}} onset of deglaciation. The characteristics of the five in situ depositional units are similar to those identified from the contemporaneous fossil and sedimentary sequence of Blanche Cave 3 rd Chamber, located approximately 400 m away, reflecting interactions between paleoclimate, sediment mobility and deposition at this locality. Greater variation is evident between the Wet Cave sedimentary profile and the inner chamber of Robertson Cave, located approximately 6 km away and shows that local processes and cave structure exerted some control on sediment accumulation. Paleoclimatic inferences from the depositional sequence of Wet Cave are broadly consistent with those inferred from regional landforms for south-eastern Australia but provide a local signal more suitable for cross-correlation of the fossil faunas. In particular, the Wet Cave sequence suggests that local conditions were relatively stable in the lead up to the LGM despite fluctuation in both local and regional effective precipitation. Sedimentary units associated with the post-LGM deglaciation are characterised by alternating sand and sandy-silt layers, assumed to reflect the impact of enhanced seasonality and/or climatic fluctuation leading towards the Holocene.

40|$|Most of the {{economic}} gold and uranium placers are developed on low angle disconformities in the Central Rand Group and concentrations of gold and uranium are usually at their optimum on unconformity surfaces. Examples include the Kimberley Reef and South Reef of the East Rand, the Main Reef Leader of the Central Rand, the Carbon Leader of the Carletonville goldfield, the Vaal Reef of the Klerksdorp goldfield and the Basal/Steyn placers of the Welkom goldfield. The individual goldfields represent fluvial fans which are composed {{of a large number}} of tectonogenetic sedimentary packages separated by unconformities. The tectonic responses between cycles of sedimentation produced unconformities and tectonically controlled cyclic sedimentation is one of the key factors culminating in the preparation and deposition of auriferous placers within the Witwatersrand succession. Unconformities, which represent breaks in sedimentation, result in the preconditioning of palaeosurfaces and redistribution of sediments and heavy minerals on them.

An abundance of recent well and seismic data sheds {{new light on}} lithology, biostratigraphy, provenance, geographic distribution and terminology of all Rogaland rock units, used widely {{in the search for}} oil and gas. While finer siliciclastic units largely remain as previously defined, previous sandstone/siltstone formations and one (<b>reworked)</b> chalky <b>unit</b> are now re-defined. These lithostratigraphic units are local sediment bodies of a lithology different from the surrounding and embracing formation. Hence, these lithostratigraphic units are members in the formal stratigraphical hierarchy.

This shows, for the first time, that the final juxtaposition of the northwestern parts of the Eastern Ghats Mobile Belt against the Bhandara Craton came about in the late Neoproterozoic and not, as previously thought, during the Mesoproterozoic. The northwestern part of the Eastern Ghats Mobile Belt comprises a fold-thrust belt consisting of a stack of northwesterly verging nappes that have been thrust over the Bhandara Craton. The Sinapalli Nappe is the lowermost nappe and rests over a tectonic contact on the Archean granites and gneisses of the craton. The basal decollement is exposed as a two-km-wide ductile-brittle thrust, hosting nepheline syenite plutons that show fabrics consistent with a synkinematic emplacement during thrusting. The Sinapalli Nappe is comprised of a sequence of alternating mafic granulites and quartzofeldspathic gneisses with slivers of basement granites, which are folded in three phases of folding (F- 1, F- 2 and F- 3) and were subjected to granulite facies metamorphism during F- 1 folding.

The formation consists of five informal, but distinct units, and their stacking architecture suggests a deepening-upward, shallow marine depositional setting. Unit I is characterized by cross-bedded, sandy, bioclastic packstones to grainstones deposited in a high energy beach-to-intertidal environment. Unit II consists of indistinctly bedded, nodular, bioclastic (mainly larger foraminifera) packstones and wackestones deposited in a logoonal lagoonal environment. Unit III is defined by medium to thickly bedded, bioclastic packestones to grainstones and subordinate, laterally confined conglomerates.

This study resolves this dilemma and gains further insight regarding {{the history of the}} Chilean coast. Problematic interpretations stem primarily from the remarkable similarity between the molluscan fauna of these units with those well documented for the late Oligocene to early Miocene of Peru. Planktic foraminifers, however, indicate that the Chilean sections accumulated in the late Miocene to early Pliocene interval following a regional hiatus that extends into the Eocene. The prevalence of mixed-depth bathyal assemblages of benthic foraminifers and ostracodes, the majority of which include lower-bathyal (> 2000 m) indicators, reveals that downslope displacement was a primary mode of deposition in the basins. Although the molluscan assemblages are dominated by shallow marine taxa, most include species that range into or are restricted to deeper waters. Sedimentary features connote rapid subsidence and deep-water deposition of gravity flows.

40|$|Reservoir {{qualities of}} {{subsurface}} reservoir rocks are primarily controlled by their composition, texture and grain size. The ability to quantifiably predict such porosity and permeability {{is a significant}} factor in reservoir quality forward modeling. Sand composition, texture and grain size are functions of hinterland processes: provenance, tectonic setting, climate, sand evolution and transportation, and the depositional environment. Sands from the modern dryland Umbum Creek, western Lake Eyre Basin, Central Australia reflect the nature of the hinterland region and drainage basin. Evolution of sand composition throughout the river course is mainly related to the changes in the relative proportion of bedrock lithologies. Six petrographic provenances were identified and established in the Umbum Creek drainage basin: upstream Palaeoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic provenances supply lithic grains and metamorphic minerals to the stream's sand, whereas quartz is mainly sourced from <b>reworked</b> older sedimentary <b>units</b> further downstream. Initial rock compositions such as mineralogy, texture and grain size are the main influence on diagenetic processes such as cementation, quartz overgrowth, mechanical and chemical compaction, grain breakage and pressure solution. In the case of the Umbum Creek sands, the medium to coarse grain size, 88 - 92 % of quartz, less than 2 % of feldspar and less than 10 % of lithic fragments, together with subrounded to rounded grains, moderately well sorting and very little in clay content, leads to a suitable candidate for good reservoir quality, if buried.

40|$|We reconstructed the {{evolution}} of the volcanic activity within the central Garrotxa monogenetic Volcanic Field, the youngest volcanic area of the Iberian Peninsula, by investigating the stratigraphy of the volcanic successions and the morphology of the monogenetic eruptive centres. Analysis of this volcanic succession has been conducted following the Unconformity Bounded Stratigraphic Units criteria. The detailed stratigraphy of the volcanic successions shows that the central Garrotxa Volcanic Field (GVF) evolved through four main periods of volcanic activity (Synthems) represented by the eruptive products of the mafic monogenetic volcanoes and associated syneruptive <b>reworked</b> deposits (Eruptive <b>Units)</b> and by the intereruptive deposits (Epiclastic Units). The distribution and the morphologies of the monogenetic volcanoes suggest that feeder dykes were emplaced under influence of the present stress filed and along pre-existing fractures of the basement. Our facies analysis of the deposits and their distribution shows that migration of volcanism toward the centre of the basin was accompanied by a trend of increasing explosivity. Episodic hydromagmatism in central Garrotxa occurred without a specific geographic locus or obvious temporal correlation. Finally, by integrating field data with the stratigraphy extracted from water wells, we determined the volume of the volcanic deposits. The small average volume of products emitted during each eruptive period, and the long quiescence separating them, allow us to classify the GVF as a low-output rate volcanic field.

40|$|Thermohaline ocean {{currents}} with near-bed velocities {{of a few}} tens of cm s- 1 {{have the ability to}} transport and sort sand, which is often deposited in thin sheets referred to as ‘contourite’ sand sheets. We examine a small sandy contourite sheet located in 800 - 1000 m water depth on the west Shetland slope in the Faroe-Shetland Channel. We describe the sedimentology of the contourite, and the relationship between sediment transport processes and contourite distribution through the last deglaciation and Holocene, based on a set of 17 short cores. Four sedimentological units ranging from very poorly sorted mud at the base (unit 1) to moderately sorted, slightly muddy, fine sand at the top (unit 4) are recognised. Ice-rafted detritus (IRD) occurs in the lower three units, but is absent in unit 4. The upper two units, 3 and 4, make up the contourite sand sheet. Analysis of the sand fraction of units 3 and 4 shows that the mean sand grain size is remarkably constant at around 3 throughout, except in some unit 3 samples with unusually high IRD content, where the mean can be coarser. IRD content correlates strongly with mean grain size, sorting and skewness throughout unit 3 even when the IRD content is small, showing that IRD input {{is one of the key}} processes controlling the sedimentology of unit 3. We conclude that the muddy sand contourites form by incomplete winnowing of the underlying glaciomarine sediments. The mud component is transported with the sand from the same source, either as small particles attached to sand grains or as sand-sized mud aggregates. Thickness maps of units 3 and 4 show that they have different depocentres, with unit 4 displaced northwest (downslope) relative to unit 3. Sedimentological trends in unit 3 are inconsistent and show no consistent transport direction. In contrast, clear across slope trends are seen in unit 4, with weak alongslope trends from the centre to both ends of the elongate contourite body. This suggests that the upper part of the contourite, unit 4, is derived from the downslope <b>reworking</b> of <b>unit</b> 3 sediment. There is no evidence for significant alongslope transport in either unit 3 or unit 4. The patchy occurrence of sandy contourites along the west Shetland slope is interpreted to result from localised export of sand from further upslope. The usefulness of the contourite sand in palaeoceanographic terms is limited. No meaningful dates can be derived from the sediments because of reworking and bioturbation. However, the presence of IRD within unit 3 shows that the Holocene circulation pattern, with strong bottom water flow through the Faroe-Shetland Channel, was established while there was still significant floating ice in the area. ...|$|R
40|$|The Lower Acacus Formation {{consists}} of fourteen deltaic packages which change laterally across the Hamada Basin, NW Libya. Southern fluvial-channel sandstones prograded northward into coastal-deltaic sandstones and siltstones, {{and eventually to}} offshore-marine sandstones and shales. Each depositional environment in the Lower Acacus Formation produced a characteristic facies with specific compositional characteristics. [...] Petrographic and petrophysical properties of selected sandstone units within the Lower Acacus Formation indicate that the sandstones have been altered by the diagenetic processes of compaction, authigenesis, and dissolution. Three diagenetic facies are identified from the southern basin flanks to the northern basin centre respectively: (a) quartz-cemented facies, (b) carbonate-cemented facies, and (c) clay-cemented facies. Each of the diagenetic facies contains a characteristic authigenic mineral suite reflecting a specific sequence of alterations which are (a) quartz-overgrowths and iron oxide, (b) carbonate cementation and dissolution, and (c) clay authigenesis respectively. [...] Isotopic study of selected sandstone units reveals a diagenetic history involving meteoric fluids modified by increasing water/rock interactions and saline (connate) water mixing with burial. [...] The major types of porosity have a regional distribution related to type of grain framework, matrix and cement in each depositional facies. Dissolution of carbonate cements and unstable grains was the dominant process to create secondary porosity; such porosity being associated with the proximal deltaic facies. Preserved primary porosity is mainly associated with the fluvial-channel facies. Microporosity and some fracture porosity are the dominant porosity types in the distal deltaic and reworked marine- offshore facies. With continued diagenesis, differential cementation and dissolution redistributed porosity and modified primary porosities in the Lower Acacus Formation. [...] A multistage model of the leaching of carbonate cements and secondary porosity development is proposed. This includes: (I) a shallow depth (early) diagenetic stage wherein CO₂-charged meteoric waters flushed through channel systems of the fluvial sandstone facies {{in the southern part}} of the basin, and (2) a deeper (late) diagenetic stage mainly due to carbonic acid-rich waters expelled from maturing organic-rich Tanezzuft shales into the deltaic sandstone facies in the northern part of the basin. [...] Early diagenesis recognized in the different sandstones of the Lower Acacus Formation has major impact on the present-day hydrologic system across the Hamada Basin. Present-day hydrologic zones have a distribution which is spatially expanded relative to the Lower Acacus diagenetic zones and indicates the role of fluid flushing and dilution through time. [...] At the basin-wide scale the relationship between sandstone facies and the distribution of diagenetic elements is an important aspect of the Lower Acacus reservoir character heterogeneity. Recognized diagenetic facies heterogeneity includes: (1) iron-oxides and interstitial clay coatings associated with quartz-overgrowths in the quartz- cemented facies of fluvial origin, (2) calcite cement patterns in the carbonate-cemented facies of proximal deltaic origin, (3) ferroan-dolomite cement associated with the fine-grained, micaceous, clay-clast-rich sandstones of proximal deltaic origin, and with the <b>reworked</b> marine sandstone <b>units,</b> and (4) authigenic clay (kaolinite) and its effect on permeability throughout the various depositional facies. [...] Integration of the many data sets results in a basin-wide 3 -D geological model which includes four phases of major regional diagenetic changes: Phase I and II represent reduction of primary porosity and permeability in fluvial sandstone units. Phase III led to secondary pore formation and to modification of primary porosity in proximal delta front sandstone units. Phase IV represents pore-filling in distal delta front siltstones and <b>reworked</b> marine sandstone <b>units.</b> [...] Improved regional basin analysis and computerized basin modelling must consider and apply the variability expected from a multitude of parameters ranging from primary depositional processes to processes of burial and subsequent modification of formation characteristics. Commonly-applied generalizations regarding diagenesis as determined from individual well studies are inadequate and in many instances perhaps invalid for developing productive regional model. Use of regional diagenetic modelling integrated with depositional facies and basin analysis represents an initial step in predicting regions of maximum enhanced and preserved porosity in the subsurface. ...|$|R
40|$|A new borehole, 210 mbsf (meters below sea floor) deep, {{drilled in}} Ribbon Reef 5 on the Great Barrier Reef off Cooktown, NE Australia, reveals a shallowing-upwards succession, the younger {{part of which}} is punctuated {{by a series of}} erosion surfaces. Nine depositional units have been defined by lithological changes and are {{numbered}} sequentially {{from the base of the}} hole upwards. A minostratigraphy, magnetostratigraphy, radiocarbon dating, uranium series dating, and modeling together with strontium ratios have been applied in an attempt to establish a chronology of accumulation. Carbonate deposition began about 770 ka ago in a relatively deepwater slope environment and is represented by a series of debris flows. Lithoclasts within these rocks, indicate that older limestones already existed in the area. Subsequent accretion involved the downslope accumulation of grainstones and wackestones, sometimes cross-laminated, characterized by intervals with abundant rhodoliths and scattered, probably <b>reworked,</b> corals. Four <b>units</b> at the base of the hole reflect deposition that probably began during isotope stage 16 and continued through stage 15 from about 770 to about 564 ka. Unit 5 probably extended to stage 11 (about 400 ka), and unit 6 to stage 9 (∼ 330 ka). Typical reefal associations of corals and calcareous algae were established in this area only above depths of about 100 m in the borehole, units 5 - 4. The succession is apparently unbroken to an erosion surface at 36 mbsf indicating subaerial emergence. The lack of evidence of emergence below this surface reflects progressive accretion or progradation or both. Two younger erosion surfaces define further periods of lowered sea level. Unit 7 is attributed to deposition during isotope stage 7, but erosion during stage 8 resulted in the preservation of only 8 m of unit 7 limestones. Unit 8 is correlated with stage 5 (∼ 125 ka), and unit 9 is interpreted as Holocene (post 7, 700 ka). The limited thicknesses of units 7, 8, and 9 are considered to reflect erosion. The progressive shallowing brought the depositional surface within the zone exposed during lowstands, and there is no sedimentological evidence that aggradation was restricted by a lack of accommodation. © 2004, SEPM (Society for Sedimentary Geology) ...|$|R
40|$|The Irumide belt is an {{elongate}} crustal province characterised by Mesoproterozoic tectonism and magmatism {{that stretches}} over {{a distance of}} approximately 900 kilometers from central Zambia to the Zambia-Tanzania border and northern Malawi. It is bounded to the northwest by largely undeformed Palaeoproterozoic basement lithologies of the Bangweulu block and is truncated to the northeast by Mesoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic transcurrent shear zones within reactivated parts of the Palaeoproterozoic Ubendian belt. To the southeast and south, Irumide lithologies were reworked within the Neoproterozoic Lufilian and Zambezi belts, and to the east by the East African Orogen. Lithologies in the Irumide belt comprise a Palaeo- to Mesoproterozoic complex of gneisses and granitoids and a supracrustal succession of quartzites and pelites. A three-fold subdivision was accepted prior to this study; (1) Palaeoproterozoic granites and gneisses forming the Irumide basement, (2) a supracrustal succession of quartzites and metapelites called the Muva Supergroup, (3) various deformed and undeformed granitoids intruding both the Palaeoproterozoic basement and Muva Supergroup and considered to be pre-Irumide (1. 4 Ga) and syn-, late- to post-Irumide (1. 1 - 0. 95 Ga). The age of Irumide tectonism itself was poorly constrained between 1. 4 and 1. 0 Ga. The basement units comprise the Mkushi Gneiss in the southwest and the Luwalizi Granite, Mwambwa River and Mulungwizi Gneisses in the northeast. These units have been correlated with the Palaeoproterozoic Bangweulu block and Ubendian belt in the past. These basement units are structurally and in places unconformably overlain by a metasedimentary succession of quartzites and metapelites, which in the southwest {{has been called the}} Kanona Group, and in the northeast the Manshya River Group. Both sequences have been correlated with similar quartzite-pelite successions on the Bangweulu block, termed the Mporokoso Group, and, together with a second cycle <b>reworked</b> <b>unit</b> on the Bangweulu block called the Kasama Formation, were collectively grouped into the Muva Supergroup. Both basement and supracrustals have been deformed, metamorphosed and intruded by a host of granitoids which, based on structural fabrics, were subdivided into pre-, syn-, late- and post-tectonic suites with respect to Irumide tectonism. Due to the lack of reliable geochronological constraints, this subdivision had remained untested until now. All units in the Irumide belt have been strongly affected by compressional tectonics, resulting in northwest-directed thrusting onto the Bangweulu block basement and extensive crustal shortening. Minor southeast-verging structures form part of locally developed backthrusts within an overall northwest-vergent tectonic regime. At least parts of the Irumide basement were affected by Irumide tectonism, but large-scale thrusting was mainly accommodated along a basal decollement at the basement-cover interface. Extensive shortening is exemplified by tight- to isoclinal folding within the supracrustal sequence, ranging from upright to recumbent. Thrusts developed where shortening could not be accommodated by tight folding, which produced tectonic duplication within the metasedimentary pile, making formation-to-formation correlations across the belt tenuous at best. Irumide tectonism has been reported to affect the base of the Mporokoso Group on the Bangweulu block, where folding along the Luongo shear zone occurred contemporaneously with thermal resetting of biotite dated at ~ 1. 0 Ga (K-Ar dates). Metamorphic parageneses record low- to medium-pressure/medium- to high-temperature conditions. Metamorphic grades range from greenschist facies in the northwestern foreland, to upper amphibolite facies in the southeast, with local granulites. Peak Irumide metamorphism, recorded in metamorphic zircon rim overgrowths, has been dated in this study at 1. 02 Ga. Metamorphism to the southeast, across the younger Karoo grabens, had previously been constrained at 1. 05 Ga, indicating an across strike diachronous development of metamorphism for the Irumide belt. The lithological units identified and dated as part of this study in the Irumide belt include: (1) limited Neoarchaean rocks emplaced at 2. 73 Ga and representing the oldest rocks in the Bangweulu block; (2) ca. 2. 05 - 1. 85 Ga volcano-plutonic complexes and gneisses representing the most important components in the Bangweulu block; (3) an extensive quartzite-metapelite succession with minor carbonate forming the Mporokoso, Kanona and Manshya River groups, and deposited at ca. 1. 8 Ga; (4) granitoids emplaced between 1. 65 - 1. 55 Ga; (5) deposition of the Kasama Formation between 1. 43 and 1. 05 Ga (second-cycle reworking of the Mporokoso Group); (6) voluminous syn- to post-kinematic Irumide granitoids emplaced between 1. 05 - 0. 95 Ga. In addition, a minor suite of 1. 36 - 1. 33 Ga anorogenic plutons (nepheline syenite and biotite granite) have been identified in the far northeastern Irumide belt, but were not included in this study. Whole-rock geochemical data for magmatic rocks in northern Zambia, predominantly from within the Irumide belt, indicate uniform crust-dominated patterns. Overall high REE contents and trace element characteristics indicate the significant participation of older crust in the generation of all magmatic suites. The data are insufficient to conclusively demonstrate that this crustal melting was associated with either intra-plate, volcanic arc or post-collisional/extensional collapse. A limited number of Sm/Nd isotopic data for the entire range of magmatic suites corroborate the highly reworked nature of parent magmas, with all samples characterised by strongly negative åNd(T) values and TDM model ages between 2. 2 and 3. 2 Ga. The geochronological data presented in this thesis show that the Irumide belt includes a Palaeoproterozoic basement complex comprising units as old as 2. 73 Ga, but mostly made up of granitic gneisses ranging in age between 2. 05 and 1. 93 Ga, while granitic and volcanic units of the Bangweulu block to the northwest were dated at 1. 87 - 1. 86 Ga. Detrital zircon age data from quartzites and zircon crystallisation ages of interlayered tuffs within the Muva Supergroup indicate a depositional age of between 1. 88 and 1. 85 Ga, with local derivation from locally recognised basement units, although similarly aged rocks of the Tanzania craton to the northeast are also a possible source. The detrital record of the Muva Supergroup shows that the various components of the Bangweulu block, including 2. 73, 2. 05 - 1. 93 and 1. 87 - 1. 86 Ga units, were assembled by the time of deposition of the Muva Supergroup at around 1. 8 Ga. Both the basement units and the Muva Supergroup were intruded by a previously unknown magmatic suite of biotite granites between 1. 65 - 1. 55 Ga, the first record of such a magmatic event in central Africa. The new data presented in this thesis allow a critical assessment of previously proposed regional correlations between Mesoproterozoic teranes in central and southern Africa. Significant temporal differences between the Irumide belt and the Kibaran belt, Choma-Kalomo block and Namaqua-Natal belts had previously not been detected due to the poor quality, low resolution or limited size of isotopic data sets. The new data set produced in this study indicates a distinct and separate tectono-magmatic history for each of these terranes, therefore precluding previously suggested correlations. In particular, the presumed southeastward continuation of the Irumide belt across the Neoproterozoic Zambezi belt into the Choma-Kalomo block is precluded by the data presented in this thesis. This new geochronological framework allows for significant spatial separation of the Kalahari and Congo cratons prior to the Neoproterozoic closure of the Damara-Lufilian-Zambezi ocean, and is therefore in support of palaeogeographic models of Rodinia which either place the Congo and Kalahari cratons as distinct and separate fragments within the supercontinent, or show {{one or both of the}} two cratons not to form part of it. Currently, available data are not able to determine the tectonic setting or the palaeogeographic location of the Irumide belt, and as a result it is unclear whether it developed within Rodinia as a collisional orogen, at its margin as an accretionary orogen, or was not associated with Rodinia at all...|$|R
40|$|El bloque de San Guillermo forma una superficie elevada de 17. 800 km² en el oeste de la provincia de Santa Fe y el borde noreste de la provincia de Córdoba. Debido a su posición topográfica, durante el Cuaternario estuvo sujeto a sedimentación eólica, sin influencia de sedimentación o erosión fluvial, algo atípico en la Pampa Norte. Está limitado por fallas con rechazos del orden de los 30 metros, y tiene una definida identidad estratigráfica, sedimentológica y geomorfológica que lo diferencia de las áreas vecinas. Una perforación de estudio hasta 102 m de profundidad realizada en la localidad de San Guillermo (en un punto típico del mismo) atravesó 53 metros de loess primario y una unidad limo arcillosa de edad probablemente pleistocena, sedimentados en discordancia sobre la Fm Paraná (arenas y pelitas miocenas). El paquete loéssico está representado por tres formaciones, cuya mineralogía está dominada en forma casi excluyente por tres formas de cuarzo: policristalino, en microaglomerados y monocristalino. El mineral arcilloso dominante es la illita. La fuente de origen de dichos materiales es probablemente un loess antiguo situado al sur. El tamaño de grano dominante es el limo, que representa el 65 % del total. La perforación se realizó con un sistema ad hoc que combina perforación rotativa directa con muestreo por percusión tipo SPT, lo que permitió obtener 15 muestras inalteradas y 91 muestras comunes, aptas también para análisis. Un estudio {{regional}} utilizando descripciones de más de 100 pozos anteriores existentes en la región del centro de Santa Fe y este de Córdoba, cubriendo unos 50. 000 km², permitió determinar que en el bloque de San Guillermo la columna estratigráfica se mantiene constante y que varía fuera de sus límites por procesos de erosión y sedimentación fluvial. An {{investigation on}} the regional distribution of loess in the North Pampa {{resulted in the}} identification of the San Guillermo Elevated Block. The pivotal work of the project was the drilling of a research borehole at the town of San Guillermo (30 ° 15 ´ lat. S and 61 ° 50 ´ long. W), North Pampa. This work is part of the "FLAGS Project" founded by the National Agency of Science Promotion, Argentina. The borehole (101. 50 m depth) comprises the entire Quaternary column of the region and part of Tertiary sedimentary rocks. A total of 91 sediment samples were collected continuously at 1 m depth intervals. 15 oriented undisturbed tube cores were recovered at intervals of 6 m. Also geoelectric and gamma profiles were made. The borehole revealed 54 m of loess which begins at the surface. A Quaternary paludal unit (between 54 and 60. 3 m deep) separates the loess column from a Miocene littoral sedimentary unit (Paraná Formation). The Quaternary section is composed of three primary (not <b>reworked)</b> loess <b>units,</b> and an underlying clayey silt. The upper loess unit is the well known Tezanos Pinto Formation (OIS 2). The other two loessic units are composed of dominant silt (average textural composition: 65 % silt), with subordinated clay and scarce fine sand; the segregations of CaCO 3 are abundant. Colour varies from 7, 5 YR 6 / 3 (light brown) to 7, 5 YR 7 / 3 (pink). The mineralogic composition of the very fine sand fraction is dominated by three forms of quartz: polycrystalline, forming microagglomerates and monocrystalline quartz. X-ray diffractions of total samples indicate a dominance of quartz, with scarce feldspars and illite. The source of the loessic units is probably an old loess located at the south. Such a thick aeolian profile of the borehole provides detailed information on the Pampean Eolian System (PES), mainly considering that outcropping loess-paleosols sequences from North Pampa hardly reach 10 m. The section is representative of a relatively elevated flat area with a surface of 17, 800 km² covering the NW of Santa Fe Province and the NE belt of Córdoba Province. That area is limited by fractures and has a marked stratigraphic, sedimentological and geomorphological identity, different to the surrounding region. It is identified here as the San Guillermo Elevated Block, which during the Quaternary underwent only eolian influence, in contrast {{to the rest of the}} North Pampa, which was subject mainly to fluvial and alluvial influence of currents arriving from the west and the north. According to the complementary information obtained from more than 100 previous boreholes covering an area of 50, 000 km², the stratigraphic column of the San Guillermo Elevated Block is clearly different to the stratigraphic column of the area located to the east. The stratigraphic correlation evidences that the San Guillermo Block is the western limit of the Pliocene- Lower Pleistocene Ituzaingó Fm deposited by the Paraná River...|$|R
