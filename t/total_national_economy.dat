30|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognized}} that pastoralist lands and land use practices provide much of the habitat that migratory wildlife in East African national parks continues to rely on for seasonal habitat requirements (Myers 1972; Western 1982). As northern Tanzania's tourism industry has grown, with the northern safari circuit comprising about 6 % of the country's <b>total</b> <b>national</b> <b>economy,</b> the economic importance of pastoralist conservation practices in these extensive ecosystems has increased considerably. This highlights the strategic economic importance to the Tanzanian state of pastoralist land use practices, including in particular the rights to zone land for seasonal uses and continue to practice mobility as {{a key element of}} management systems.|$|E
40|$|Primary {{agricultural}} production {{is a significant}} factor of the <b>total</b> <b>national</b> <b>economy,</b> primarily due to its share in GDP and total employment. Together with food industry, this sector has over 15 % of Serbian GDP. Although {{the share of the}} primary {{agricultural production}} in realized GDP has constantly decreasing since the beginning of 2000 (owing to bigger growth of GDP in other sectors of Serbian economy), the primary agriculture significantly contribute to other industrial sectors, which directly depend on raw materials from agriculture, then inputs industry for agriculture, as well as accompanying service activities. Initiated changes in the field of agriculture, although under influence of numerous factors, which have an amortization effect on them, have acquired a character of irreversible processes. A reform of agricultural sector can hardly return to a starting position, but there, first of all, can talk about its vacillating tempo and agrarian policy instruments, which often should set up a balance between diametrically opposite goals. In such conditions, Serbian agriculture has extraordinary place and role in the total economic development of the country, especially in the process of adjusting economic mechanisms for realization of specific social goals, on conduction of reforms and transition, and primarily on mitigation of the world economic/financial crisis' impact, which seriously jeopardize a revival and development of economy...|$|E
40|$|Van den Noort {{investigated}} whether {{agriculture in}} the Netherlands always functioned efficiently. He analysed information on the extent and distribution of agricultural income separately for 1923 - 1940 and 1949 - 1963. For this purpose the relations between economic factors were examined and clarified by mathematical formulae both existing and specially developed. Before the War {{the course of the}} agricultural income was much more fitful than that of the national income and the decline in agriculture during the years of depression was much greater than in the <b>total</b> <b>national</b> <b>economy.</b> After the War fluctuations remained great, while expansion after 1952 was much slower in agriculture than {{in the rest of the}} economy. Productivity in agriculture increased in both periods much faster than income per unit 'factor input' (the total of production factors in agriculture). After the net price had decreased, consumers profited considerably from the technical progress. These events and the increase in capital per man-year of labour decreased the quantity of labour, more than the total 'factor input'. This was important for a better labour distribution in the national economy. Sector and functional distribution of income in agriculture were distinguished. The first indicated the role of {{agriculture in the}} national income, particularly as to its industry, and was closely bound up with the sector labour distribution. The second one indicated division over the production factors labour and capital (including soil). To study these last factors the course of rentprices and salaries was traced. In considering the income parity in agriculture the agricultural policy after the War proved to have fulfilled its aims, and agriculture of the Netherlands was shown as a whole to have functioned efficiently...|$|E

40|$|This {{article was}} {{motivated}} {{by the fact that}} the complete economic indicators are a necessary prerequisite for good economic policymaking. Therefore, it is useful to possess an estimate of the extent of economic activities that bypass the standard statistical system of a country. In the article, the method of discrepancy in the system of national accounts was applied to assess the scope of unofficial economy in the Republic of Croatia in 1998. The method is based on fundamental identity describing economic flows: the expenditure of one economic unit is the revenue of another. Therefore, the sum of <b>total</b> expenditures in <b>national</b> <b>economy</b> must be equal to the sum of total revenues. The total unofficial economy based on this estimate was between 9. 3 percent and 12. 8 percent of the officially recorded GDP, but the author stresses that this result should be interpreted with caution, since the method applied usually generates the lower limit of the estimate...|$|R
50|$|The {{industry}} mix {{effect is}} equal to the original 100,000 employees times the growth in the industry nationwide, which was 8%, minus the <b>total</b> <b>national</b> growth of 5%.

The analysis implies that the state construction would have increased by another 3,000 employees had it followed the industry trends, because the construction industry nationwide performed better than the <b>national</b> <b>economy</b> overall.|$|R
