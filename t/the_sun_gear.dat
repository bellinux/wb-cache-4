25|$|Epicyclic gears {{are also}} called {{planetary}} gears because the axes {{of the planet}} gears revolve around the common axis {{of the sun and}} ring gears that they mesh with and roll between. In the image, the yellow shaft carries <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> which is almost hidden. The blue gears are called planet gears and the pink gear is the ring gear or annulus.|$|E
25|$|An {{epicyclic}} differential can use {{epicyclic gearing}} to split and apportion torque asymmetrically between {{the front and}} rear axles. An epicyclic differential {{is at the heart of}} the Toyota Prius automotive drive train, where it interconnects the engine, motor-generators, and the drive wheels (which have a second differential for splitting torque as usual). It has the advantage of being relatively compact along the length of its axis (that is, <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> shaft).|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>gear</b> is {{operated}} from the hand-operated crank (connected to gear a1, driving the large four-spoked mean sun gear, b1) {{and in turn}} drives {{the rest of the}} gear sets. <b>The</b> <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> is b1/b2 and b2 has 64 teeth. It directly drives the date/mean sun pointer (there may have been a second, [...] "true sun" [...] pointer that displayed the sun's elliptical anomaly; it is discussed below in the Freeth reconstruction). In this discussion, reference is to modelled rotational period of various pointers and indicators; they all assume the input rotation of the b1 gear of 360 degrees, corresponding with one tropical year, and are computed {{solely on the basis of}} the gear ratios of the gears named.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: If <b>the</b> left <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> (red) {{encounters}} resistance, {{the planet}} gear (green) spins {{as well as}} revolving, allowing <b>the</b> left <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> to slow down, with an equal speeding up of <b>the</b> right <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> (yellow).|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Input torque {{is applied}} to the ring gear (blue), which turns the entire carrier (blue). The carrier is {{connected}} to both <b>sun</b> <b>gears</b> (red and yellow) only through the planet gear (green). Torque is transmitted to <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>gears</b> through <b>the</b> planet gear. The planet gear revolves around the axis of the carrier, driving <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>gears.</b> If <b>the</b> resistance at both wheels is equal, the planet gear revolves without spinning about its own axis, and both wheels turn at the same rate.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Two <b>sun</b> <b>gears</b> (not shown) {{fit inside}} this planet carrier. <b>The</b> <b>sun</b> <b>gears</b> are powered through {{clutches}} from the engine. One of {{three sets of}} three planet gears inside the carrier can be seen.|$|R
50|$|In one arrangement, the {{planetary}} carrier (green) is held stationary, and <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> (yellow) {{is used as}} input. In this case, {{the planetary}} gears simply rotate about their own axes (i.e., spin) at a rate determined {{by the number of}} teeth in each gear. If <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> has Ns teeth, and each planet gear has Np teeth, then the ratio is equal to −N/N. For instance, if <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> has 24 teeth, and each planet has 16 teeth, then the ratio is −24/16, or −3/2; this means that one clockwise turn of <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> produces 1.5 counterclockwise turns of each of the planet gear(s) about its axis.|$|E
50|$|Note {{that the}} axle {{of the planet}} gear {{is tied to the}} axle of <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> by a link that freely rotates around the axis of <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> and keeps the planet gear engaged with <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> but does not {{contribute}} to the drive torque. This link appears, at first sight, to be similar to a crank but the drive is not transmitted through it. Thus, it did not contravene the crank patent.|$|E
50|$|An {{epicyclic}} gear train {{consists of two}} gears mounted so that the center of one gear revolves around {{the center of the}} other. A carrier connects the centers of the two gears and rotates to carry one gear, called the planet gear, around the other, called <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>gear.</b> The planet and sun gears mesh so that their pitch circles roll without slip. A point on the pitch circle of the planet gear traces an epicycloid curve. In this simplified case, <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> is fixed and the planetary gear(s) roll around <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In {{discussing}} the spur gear differential, {{the use of}} the term annular gear is a convenient way to distinguish <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>gears</b> of <b>the</b> two epicyclic gear trains. [...] <b>The</b> second <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> serves <b>the</b> same purpose as the annular gear of a simple planetary gear train, but clearly does not have the internal gear mate that is typical of an annular gear.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The {{opening for}} <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>gears</b> is {{resting on a}} table. A dinner fork is shown for scale. An internal-tooth ring gear (not shown) meshes with three of the planet gears. The ring gear turns the drive shaft.|$|R
50|$|The {{planetary}} gear housing features external gear teeth {{and can be}} rotated by a motor and worm gear. Alteration of the housing position allows rotation of <b>the</b> output <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> independently of <b>the</b> input <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> position. I.e. if the driver were to hold the steering wheel (and therefore <b>the</b> input <b>sun</b> <b>gear)</b> stationary, driving <b>the</b> {{planetary gear}} housing {{will result in the}} rotation of the steering pinion (and therefore a steering action at the front wheels). By manipulating the position of the planetary gear housing, the active steering ECU can synthesize a variable steering ratio or generate steering actions independently of the driver.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: In this example, {{the carrier}} (green) is held {{stationary}} while <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> (yellow) {{is used as}} input. The planet gears (blue) turn in a ratio determined {{by the number of}} teeth in each gear. Here, the ratio is −24/16, or −3/2; each planet gear turns at 3/2 the rate of <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>gear,</b> in the opposite direction.|$|E
5000|$|... is the Number {{of teeth}} of the Ring, <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>gear</b> and each Planet gear respectively.|$|E
50|$|Epicyclic gearing is also {{available}} which consists of a sun, a carrier, and two planets which mesh with each other. One planet meshes with <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>gear,</b> while the second planet meshes with the ring gear. For this case, when the carrier is fixed, the ring gear rotates {{in the same direction}} as <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>gear,</b> thus providing a reversal in direction compared to standard epicyclic gearing.|$|E
5000|$|... is {{the angular}} {{velocity}} of <b>the</b> Ring, <b>Sun</b> <b>gear,</b> Planet gears and planet Carrier respectively, and ...|$|R
5000|$|The double {{planetary}} gear system incorporates an input <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> connected to <b>the</b> driver’s steering wheel, two planetary <b>gears,</b> an output <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> connected to <b>the</b> steering pinion, and a rotating housing. If the housing is held still, the driver’s steer inputs are translated from <b>the</b> input <b>sun</b> <b>gear,</b> thought <b>the</b> {{planetary gear}}s (sharing a common lay shaft) to <b>the</b> output <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> with a net 1:1 ratio. I.e. if the planetary gear housing is held still, conventional steering operation is retained. This characteristic provides a means of steering the vehicle {{in the event of}} an active steering system failure.|$|R
25|$|Because of {{the large}} space between <b>the</b> mean <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> and <b>the</b> front {{of the case and}} the size of and {{mechanical}} features on <b>the</b> mean <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> it is very likely that the mechanism contained further gearing that either has been lost in or subsequent to the shipwreck or was removed before being loaded onto the ship. This lack of evidence and nature of the front part of the mechanism has led to numerous attempts to emulate what the Greeks of the period would have done and, of course, {{because of the lack of}} evidence many solutions have been put forward.|$|R

5000|$|So, {{with the}} {{planetary}} carrier locked, one turn of <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> results in [...] turns {{of the ring}} gear.|$|E
50|$|The {{planetary}} gear driving power through direct connection or link initiates <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>gear.</b> <b>The</b> <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> then drives the {{planetary gear}}s assembled with the external gear ring to operate. The {{whole set of}} planetary gear system revolves on its own axis and along the external gear ring where the output shaft connected to the planetary carrier achieves the goal of speed reduction. A higher reduction ratio {{can be achieved by}} doubling the multiple staged gears and planetary gears.|$|E
50|$|The FMX {{transmission}} is controlled through two clutches called the forward and rear clutches, and two band brakes, called the forward and rear bands. The clutches and bands are operated by hydraulic pressure. In this case, forward means {{closest to the}} engine. When applied, a clutch connects a rotational component to the engine, causing the component to turn, and a band holds the component, preventing it from turning. The forward clutch controls power to <b>the</b> primary <b>sun</b> <b>gear.</b> <b>The</b> rear clutch controls power to <b>the</b> secondary <b>sun</b> <b>gear.</b> Confusingly, <b>the</b> band that holds the rear clutch is called the front band. The rear band holds the planet carrier.|$|R
50|$|The Ravigneaux set has two <b>sun</b> <b>gears,</b> a large <b>sun</b> {{and a small}} sun, and {{a single}} planet carrier, holding two sets of {{planetary}} gears, inner planets and outer planets. The carrier is one sub-assembly but has two radii to couple with {{the inner and outer}} planets, respectively. The two sets of planet gears rotate independently of the carrier but co-rotate with a fixed gear ratio with respect to each other. The inner planets couple with <b>the</b> small <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> and co-rotate at a fixed gear ratio with respect to it. The outer planets couple with <b>the</b> large <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> and co-rotates with a fixed gear ratio with respect to it. Finally, the ring gear also couples and co-rotates with the outer planets in a fixed gear ratio with respect to them.|$|R
50|$|A Ravigneaux gearset is like {{a simple}} {{planetary}} gear set, except that each planet gear {{is replaced by a}} set of three gears, all on the same carrier. All three gears in a set are seen inside the carrier in the left photo. The gear {{on the right side of}} this photo is in slightly farther toward the center of the carrier than the gear it meshes with on the left. The left and right gears turn in the opposite direction. Only the outer planet gears mesh with the ring <b>gear.</b> <b>The</b> primary <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> (<b>the</b> small <b>sun)</b> meshes with <b>the</b> inner planets, and <b>the</b> secondary <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> (large <b>sun)</b> meshes with <b>the</b> <b>gears</b> that turn with the outer planets.|$|R

50|$|Many {{cordless}} drills incorporate {{this type}} of torque limiter in a planetary gearset. It may {{be a part of}} an assembly of multiple gearsets used to primarily reduce speed and multiply torque as well as perform ratio changes. The torque limiter is typically the last gearset in the transmission. It uses the planet carrier as the input with <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> as the output, and the annulus normally locked. A series of ball detents act on the annulus to lock it, allowing power to be transmitted from the planet carrier to <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>gear.</b> When the torque transmitted through the gearset reaches a determinate amount, the torque acting on the annulus causes it to unlock from its ball detents and freely rotate, causing power to be diverted from the load on <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> to the annulus and thereby stalling the output until torque is reduced to an amount where the ball detents can lock the annulus again. This system equally limits torque in both directions of rotation and also works with <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> as the input. The compression of the ball detents (and therefore the amount of torque at which the limiter is utilized) is typically adjusted by means of a rotating collar accessible to the user which is indexed and held in place with its own separate ball detents.|$|E

25|$|Thus, for example, {{if the car}} {{is making}} a turn to the right, the main ring gear may make 10 full {{rotations}}. During that time, the left wheel will make more rotations because it has farther to travel, and the right wheel will make fewer rotations as it has less distance to travel. <b>The</b> <b>sun</b> <b>gears</b> (which drive <b>the</b> axle half-shafts) will rotate at different speeds relative to the ring gear (one faster, one slower) by, say, 2 full turns each (4 full turns relative to each other), resulting in the left wheel making 12 rotations, and the right wheel making 8 rotations.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the effect of}} gear geometrical errors in wind turbine planetary gearboxes with a floating <b>sun</b> <b>gear.</b> Numerical simulations and experiments are employed throughout the study. A National Renewable Energy Laboratory 750 kW gearbox is modelled in a multibody environment and verified using the experimental data obtained from a dynamometer test. The gear geometrical errors, which are both assembly dependent and assembly independent, are described, and planet-pin misalignment and eccentricity are selected as the two most influential and key errors for case studies. Various load cases involving errors in the floating and non-floating <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> designs are simulated, and the planet-bearing reactions, gear vibrations, gear mesh loads and bearing fatigue lives are compared. All tests and simulations are performed at the rated wind speed. For errorless <b>gears,</b> <b>the</b> non-floating <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> design performs better in terms of gear load variation, whereas the upwind planet bearing has more damage. In <b>the</b> floating <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> scenario, <b>the</b> planet misalignment is neutralized by changing <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> motion pattern and the planet gear's elastic deformation. The effects of gear profile modifications are also evaluated, revealing that profile modifications such as crowning improve the effects of misalignment...|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} 3-speed hubs use {{a single}} planetary epicyclic gearset. <b>The</b> <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> (in yellow above) is mounted solidly to the axle {{and is thus}} fixed relative to the bicycle frame.|$|E
50|$|The {{ring gear}} {{may also be}} held fixed, with input {{provided}} to the planetary gear carrier; output rotation is then produced from <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>gear.</b> This configuration will produce an increase in gear ratio, equal to 1+N/N.|$|E
5000|$|The {{combination}} of epicycle gear trains with a planet engaging both a sun gear and {{a ring gear}} is called a planetary gear train. [...] In this case, the ring gear is usually fixed and <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> is driven.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>sun</b> and planet <b>gear</b> is {{a method}} of {{converting}} reciprocating motion to rotary motion and {{was used in the}} first rotative beam engines.|$|R
