25|$|Good Samaritan laws offer legal {{protection}} {{to people who}} give reasonable assistance to those who are, or who they believe to be, injured, ill, in peril, or otherwise incapacitated. The protection is intended to reduce bystanders' hesitation to assist, {{for fear of being}} sued or prosecuted for unintentional injury or wrongful death. An example of such a law in common-law areas of Canada: a good Samaritan doctrine is a legal principle that prevents a rescuer who has voluntarily helped a victim in distress from being successfully sued for wrongdoing. Its purpose is <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>people</b> <b>from</b> being reluctant to help a stranger in need for fear of legal repercussions should they make some mistake in treatment. By contrast, a duty to rescue law requires people to offer assistance, and holds those who fail to do so liable.|$|E
500|$|Sometime around September 19, 1869, Corbin, at {{the urging}} of Gould, sent a letter to Grant desperately urging him not to release gold from the Treasury. Grant {{received}} the letter from a messenger while playing croquet with Porter at a deluxe Pennsylvania retreat. He finally realized {{what was going on and}} was determined to stop the gold manipulation scheme. When pressed for a reply to Corbin's letter, Grant responded curtly that everything was [...] "all right" [...] and that there was no reply. One Grant biographer described the comical nature of the events as an Edwardian farce. Grant, however, did have his wife Julia respond in a letter to Corbin's wife that Abel Corbin needed to get out of the gold speculation market. When Gould visited Corbin's house, he read the letter from Mrs. Grant containing the warning from Grant, after which he began to sell gold, while also buying small amounts of gold in order <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>people</b> <b>from</b> getting suspicious. [...] Gould never told Fisk, who kept buying gold in earnest, that Grant was catching onto their predatory scheme.|$|E

500|$|Lee Ruth Davis, her sister, and two {{brothers}} were {{hidden by the}} Wrights while their father hid in the woods. On the morning of Poly Wilkerson's funeral, the Wrights left the children alone to attend. Davis and her siblings crept {{out of the house}} to hide with relatives in the nearby town of Wylly, but they were turned back for being too dangerous. The children spent the day in the woods but decided to return to the Wrights' house. After spotting men with guns on their way back, they crept back to the Wrights, who were frantic with fear. Davis later described the experience: [...] "I was laying that deep in water, that is where we sat all day long... We got on our bellies and crawled. We tried <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>people</b> <b>from</b> seeing us through the bushes... We were trying to get back to Mr. Wright house. After we got all the way to his house, Mr. and Mrs. Wright were all the way out in the bushes hollering and calling us, and when we answered, they were so glad." [...] Several other white residents of Sumner hid black residents of Rosewood and smuggled them out of town. Gainesville's black community took in many of Rosewood's evacuees, waiting for them at the train station and greeting survivors as they disembarked, covered in sheets. On Sunday, January 7, a mob of 100 to 150 whites returned to burn the remaining dozen or so structures of Rosewood.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout the Cold War, {{many of the}} {{targeted}} countries' governments sponsored jamming of VOA broadcasts, which sometimes led critics to question the broadcasts' actual impact. For example, in 1956, Polish People's Republic stopped jamming VOA transmissions , but People's Republic of Bulgaria continued to jam the signal through the 1970s. Chinese language VOA broadcasts were jammed beginning in 1956 and extending through 1976. However, {{after the collapse of}} the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union, interviews with participants in anti-Soviet movements verified the effectiveness of VOA broadcasts in transmitting information to socialist societies. The People's Republic of China diligently jams VOA broadcasts. Cuba has also been reported to interfere with VOA satellite transmissions to Iran from its Russian-built transmission site at Bejucal. David Jackson, former director of Voice of America, noted: [...] "The North Korean government doesn't jam us, but they try <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>people</b> <b>from</b> listening through intimidation or worse.

2500|$|Electric fence {{comes in}} many styles of wire, rope and webbing, and is {{particularly}} useful for internal division of pastures. [...] It carries only a mild charge that causes a noticeable shock, but no permanent injury to animals or people. [...] It is relatively inexpensive and {{is easy to}} install, but if electricity fails, it is easily broken. [...] It is excellent both as a temporary fence and, in single strands, as a top or middle barrier to keep horses away from conventional fencing. There is some danger that horses can become tangled in an electric fence, though because the materials are finer, it usually breaks, stopping the current, though injuries are still possible. [...] Because electricity can fail, {{it should not be}} the sole fencing used on property boundaries, particularly next to roads, though a strand on top may be used to keep a horse from leaning over a fence made of other materials. [...] Nor should it be used alone in small pens where horses may accidentally bump into it on a regular basis. [...] However, small single-horse enclosures are sometimes seen at endurance riding competition, where temporary fencing must be set up in remote areas. [...] In residential areas, warning signs should be posted on any boundary fences with electrified sections <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>people</b> <b>from</b> touching the fence and accidentally being shocked.|$|E
2500|$|As a man, Mar Samuel was {{distinguished}} for his modesty, gentleness, and unselfishness, being {{always ready}} to subordinate his own interests {{to those of the}} community. He said: [...] "A man may never exclude himself from the community, but must seek his welfare in that of society" [...] (Berakhot 49b). He demanded seemly behavior from every one, saying that any improper conduct was punishable by law (Ḥag. 5a). One should help one's fellow man at the first signs of approaching difficulties, so as to prevent them, and not wait until he is in actual distress (ib.). In his solicitude for helpless orphans he imposed upon every court the task of acting as father to them (Yeb. 67b; Giṭ. 37a, 52b); and he declared that a loan taken from an orphan was not canceled in the Sabbatical year, even if no prosbul had been made out for it (Giṭ. 36b-37a). He stored his grain until prices had risen, in order to sell it to the poor at the low prices of the harvest-time (B. B. 90b). In order to save the people from being cheated he ordered the merchants never to take a profit of more than one-sixth of the cost price (B. M. 40b), and he was ready even to temporarily modify the Law in order to prevent them from selling at a high price goods necessary for the fulfilment of a religious duty (Pes. 30a; Sukkah 34b). In a certain case also he permitted the infraction of a religious prescription in order <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>people</b> <b>from</b> harm (Shab. 42a).|$|E

[...] "Responses to guilt are oh, so predictable," [...] she stated. [...] "What do guilty people do? They lie, they avoid, they run, they mislead... they divert attention away from themselves and they act like nothing is wrong." [...] She suggested that the garbage bag in the trunk of the car was a [...] "decoy" [...] put there <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>people</b> <b>from</b> getting suspicious about the smell of the car when she left it abandoned in a parking stall directly beside a dumpster in an Amscot parking lot.

[...] "That's the only question you need to answer in considering why Caylee Marie Anthony was left {{on the side of the}} road dead."
