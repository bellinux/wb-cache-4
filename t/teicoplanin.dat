5|$|Studies {{have been}} {{conducted}} in several countries with different health care system models to assess the cost-effectiveness of linezolid compared to glycopeptides such as vancomycin or <b>teicoplanin.</b> In most countries, linezolid was more cost-effective than comparable antibiotics {{for the treatment of}} hospital-acquired pneumonia and complicated skin and skin structure infections, either due to higher cure and survival rates or lower overall treatment costs.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid's {{spectrum}} of activity against Gram-positive bacteria {{is similar to that}} of the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin, which has long been the standard for treatment of MRSA infections, and the two drugs are often compared. Other comparable antibiotics include <b>teicoplanin</b> (trade name Targocid, a glycopeptide like vancomycin), quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid, a combination of two streptogramins, not active against E. faecalis), and daptomycin (Cubicin, a lipopeptide), and some agents still being developed, such as ceftobiprole, dalbavancin, and telavancin. Linezolid is the only one that can be taken by mouth. In the future, oritavancin and iclaprim may be useful oral alternatives to linezolid—both are in the early stages of clinical development.|$|E

2500|$|MRSA {{infections in}} both the {{hospital}} and community setting are commonly treated with non-β-lactam antibiotics, such as clindamycin (a lincosamine) and co-trimoxazole (also commonly known as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole). [...] Resistance to these antibiotics has also led {{to the use of}} new, broad-spectrum anti-gram-positive antibiotics, such as linezolid, because of its availability as an oral drug. First-line treatment for serious invasive infections due to MRSA is currently glycopeptide antibiotics (vancomycin and <b>teicoplanin).</b> [...] A number of problems with these antibiotics occur, such as the need for intravenous administration (no oral preparation is available), toxicity, and the need to monitor drug levels regularly by blood tests. [...] Also, glycopeptide antibiotics do not penetrate very well into infected tissues (this is a particular concern with infections of the brain and meninges and in endocarditis). [...] Glycopeptides must not be used to treat methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA), as outcomes are inferior.|$|E
50|$|The {{structures}} of the <b>teicoplanin</b> core and the side-chains that characterize the five major <b>teicoplanin</b> compounds are shown below.|$|E
50|$|<b>Teicoplanin</b> (TARGOCID, marketed by Sanofi Aventis Ltd) is {{actually}} a mixture of several compounds, five major (named <b>teicoplanin</b> A2-1 through A2-5) and four minor (named <b>teicoplanin</b> RS-1 through RS-4).All teicoplanins share a same glycopeptide core, termed <b>teicoplanin</b> A3-1 — a fused ring structure to which two carbohydrates (mannose and N-acetylglucosamine) are attached. The major and minor components also contain a third carbohydrate moiety — β-D-glucosamine — and differ only by the length and conformation of a side-chain attached to it.|$|E
50|$|While not {{approved}} {{for use in}} the U.S., <b>teicoplanin</b> was discovered in the early 1990s and is marketed in Europe. It has more fatty acid chains than vancomycin and is considered to be 50 to 100 times more lipophillic. <b>Teicoplanin</b> also has an increased half-life compared to vancomycin, as well as having better tissue penetration. It can be two to four times more active than vancomycin, but it does depend upon the organism. <b>Teicoplanin</b> is more acidic, forming water-soluble salts, so it can be given intramuscularly. <b>Teicoplanin</b> is much better at penetrating into leucocytes and phagocytes than vancomycin.|$|E
5000|$|Six {{different}} types of vancomycin resistance are shown by enterococcus: Van-A, Van-B, Van-C, Van-D, Van-E and Van-G.

5000|$|Analysis {{indicated}} tyrosine {{and three}} types of nonproteinogenic amino acids, (S)-4-hydroxyphenylglycine, 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine, and β-hydroxytyrosine as {{the building blocks of}} the <b>teicoplanin</b> group of glycopeptides. In all, six of the seven total amino acids of the <b>teicoplanin</b> backbone are composed of nonproteinogenic or modified amino acids. Eleven enzymes are coordinatively induced to produce these six required residues. [...] <b>Teicoplanin</b> contains two chlorinated positions, 2 (3-Cl-Tyr) and 6 (3-Cl-β-Hty). The putative halogenase Orf8* has been proposed to catalyze the halogenation on both amino acids. Chlorination is thought to occur at a very early point in the biosynthesis prior to phenolic oxidative coupling, with the possibility of tyrosine or β-hydroxytyrosine being the substrate of chlorination.|$|E

50|$|Acquired VanA- and VanB-type {{glycopeptide}} {{resistance in}} enterococci {{is due to}} synthesis of modified peptidoglycan precursors terminating in D-lactate. As opposed to VanA-type strains which are resistant to both vancomycin and <b>teicoplanin,</b> VanB-type strains remain <b>teicoplanin</b> susceptible. The vanY gene was necessary for synthesis of the vancomycin-inducible D,D-carboxypeptidase EC activity previously proposed {{to be responsible for}} glycopeptide resistance. However, this activity was not required for peptidoglycan synthesis in the presence of glycopeptides.|$|E
50|$|Oral <b>teicoplanin</b> {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} {{to be effective in}} the treatment of pseudomembranous colitis and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea, with comparable efficacy with vancomycin.|$|E
50|$|Vancomycin and <b>teicoplanin</b> are {{glycopeptide}} antibiotics used {{to treat}} MRSA infections.Teicoplanin is a structural congener of vancomycin that has a similar activity spectrum but a longer half-life.Because the oral absorption of vancomycin and <b>teicoplanin</b> is very low, these agents can be administered intravenously to control systemic infections. Treatment of MRSA infection with vancomycin can be complicated, due to its inconvenient route of administration. Moreover, the efficacy of vancomycin against MRSA is inferior to that of anti-staphylococcal beta-lactam antibiotics against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Teicoplanin</b> {{refers to}} a complex of related natural {{products}} isolated from the fermentation broth of a strain of Actinoplanes teichomyceticus, consisting {{of a group of}} five structures. These structures possess a common aglycone, or core, consisting of seven amino acids bound by peptide and ether bonds to form a four-ring system. These five structures differ by the identity of the fatty acyl side-chain attached to the sugar. The origin of these seven amino acids in the biosynthesis of <b>teicoplanin</b> was studied by 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance. [...] The studies indicate amino acids AA1, AA2, AA4, AA5, and AA6 are derived from tyrosine, and amino acids AA3 and AA7 are derived from acetate. To be specific, <b>teicoplanin</b> contains 4-hydroxyphenylglycine and 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine residues, a chlorine atom attached on each of the tyrosine residues, and three sugar moieties, N-fatty acyl-β-D-glucosamine, N-acetyl-β-D-glucosamine, and D-mannose.|$|E

50|$|<b>Teicoplanin</b> is an {{antibiotic}} {{used in the}} prophylaxis and treatment of serious infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. It is a semisynthetic glycopeptide antibiotic with a spectrum of activity similar to vancomycin. Its mechanism of action is to inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis.|$|E
50|$|Glycopeptide {{antibiotics}} are a {{class of}} drugs of microbial origin that are composed of glycosylated cyclic or polycyclic nonribosomal peptides. Significant glycopeptide antibiotics include the anti-infective antibiotics vancomycin, <b>teicoplanin,</b> telavancin, ramoplanin and decaplanin, and the antitumor antibiotic bleomycin. Vancomycin is used if infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is suspected.|$|E
50|$|Vancomycin was {{isolated}} in 1953, and used clinically from 1955. Approved in 1958 by FDA to treat penicillin resistant staphylococci. MRSA first seen in 1961. Bleomycin was first discovered in 1966. <b>Teicoplanin</b> {{was discovered in}} the early 1990s. Telavancin is a semi-synthetic lipoglycopeptide derivative of vancomycin (approved by FDA in 2009).|$|E
50|$|S. haemolyticus has {{the highest}} level of {{antibiotic}} resistance among the CoNS. Various strains are resistant to {{one or more of these}} antibiotics: penicillins, cephalosporins, macrolides, quinolones, tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, glycopeptides, and fosfomycin (see table in Genome structure), and multidrug resistance is common. As indicated above, even glycopeptide-resistant (vancomycin and <b>teicoplanin)</b> strains have begun to emerge.Meropenem would be suitable for treatment.|$|E
50|$|Several newly {{discovered}} strains of MRSA show antibiotic resistance even to vancomycin and <b>teicoplanin.</b> These new {{strains of the}} MRSA bacterium have been dubbed vancomycin intermediate-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VISA). Linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin, daptomycin, ceftaroline, and tigecycline are used to treat more severe infections that {{do not respond to}} glycopeptides such as vancomycin. Current guidelines recommend daptomycin for VISA bloodstream infections and endocarditis.|$|E

[...] A summary of the gene layout and purpose is shown below.|$|E
50|$|In {{molecular}} biology the small pathogenicity island RNA X (alias RsaOR) gene is a bacterial non-coding RNA. It {{was discovered in}} a large-scale analysis of Staphylococcus aureus. SprX was shown to influence antibiotic resistance of the bacteria to Vancomycin and <b>Teicoplanin</b> glycopeptides, which are used to treat MRSA infections. In this study the authors identified a SprX target, stage V sporulation protein G (Spo VG). By reducing Spo VG expression levels, SprX affects S. aureus resistance to the glycopeptide antibiotics.|$|E
50|$|Penicillin is the {{treatment}} of choice for both disease states. It is resistant to vancomycin.E. rhusiopathiae is sensitive in vitro and in vivo mainly to penicillins, but also to cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone), tetracyclines (chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline), quinolones (ciprofloxacin, pefloxacin), clindamycin, erythromycin, imipenem, and piperacillin. It is resistant to vancomycin, chloramphenicol, daptomycin, gentamicin, netilmicin, polymyxin B, streptomycin, <b>teicoplanin,</b> tetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Penicillins and cephalosporins are the first-line choicefor treatment.

50|$|Chakraborty's {{researches}} {{covered the}} design and synthesis of unnatural amino acids, cyclic peptides and biologically active natural products. He is credited with designing new amide-linked molecular entities based on Sugar Amino Acids and anticancer compounds such as amphidinolides, epothilones, crocacins, and clavosolide and the synthesis of glycopeptide antibiotics (vancomycin and <b>teicoplanin)</b> and immunosuppressants (FK506, rapamycin, stevastelins and antascomicin). He has published his researches by way of several peer-reviewed articles; ResearchGate, an online repository of the science articles, has listed 243 of them. He has also mentored several doctoral scholars in their studies.|$|E
50|$|The {{enzymes that}} hydrolyze the {{peptidoglycan}} cross-links continue to function, even while those that form such cross-links do not. This weakens the cell {{wall of the}} bacterium, and osmotic pressure becomes increasingly uncompensated—eventually causing cell death (cytolysis). In addition, the build-up of peptidoglycan precursors triggers the activation of bacterial cell wall hydrolases and autolysins, which further digest the cell wall's peptidoglycans. The small size of the penicillins increases their potency, {{by allowing them to}} penetrate the entire depth of the cell wall. This is in contrast to the glycopeptide antibiotics vancomycin and <b>teicoplanin,</b> which are both much larger than the penicillins.|$|E
