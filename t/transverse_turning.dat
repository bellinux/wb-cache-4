Four different conditions of the same material from the same batch were studied fine grain material in the soft, solution annealed state and in the precipitation hardened state, and large grain material in the same two conditions.

A striking effect {{was that of the}} grain size on the notch wear - one of the limiting factors for tool life - which could be clearly related to the amount of burrs formed in the large grain size material both in the solution annealed and fully precipitation hardened condition.

40|$|The {{effect of}} grain size in wrought Alloy 718 and Waspaloy on the wear of {{cemented}} carbide tools was examined {{by measuring the}} progression of wear in a specific <b>transverse</b> <b>turning</b> operation. Work material with different microstructure was achieved through heat treatments of the material from a single batch, for each alloy. The worn cutting tools were analysed by means of scanning electron microscopy and X-ray microanalysis to study the wear mechanism. The grain size of the work material in relation to undeformed chip thickness is found to control the depth of cut (DOC) notch wear, which is the tool life limiting factor when machining the work material with large grain size. The adhesive wear is shown to dominate on the rake face, but this wear is not tool life limiting since the cladding of work material to the tool surface basically protects the tool from further wear. Concerning the flank wear, machining of Waspaloy is associated with less such wear than machining of Alloy 718 irrespective of grain size. The analysis shows that higher cutting forces and expected cutting resistance due to higher work to fracture cannot explain the difference in flank wear. Instead, from {{the analysis of the}} oxidized surface below the flank wear it is supposed that the difference in tribological conditions is an important factor for flank wear development...|$|E

40|$|Superalloys {{are used}} in {{applications}} such as gas turbines, steam power plants and nuclear power systems that require good high temperature properties and/or exceptional corrosion resistance. Superalloys are classified as materials that are “difficult to machine”. In production machining is a most commonly occurring procedure. Thus, the concept of machinability – {{the ease with which}} a material will be machined – becomes important. In particular since machinability problems tend to be increasingly costly with the toughness of the work material. This work aims to study the microstructural influence on the machinability of the two wrought superalloys Alloy 718 and Waspaloy. The most obvious reason is the apparent scarcity of knowledge about how the microstructure affects the machining procedures. Through heat treatment four different conditions of each alloy were studied; fine and coarse grain size that were solution annealed or aged. The machining operation chosen was <b>transverse</b> <b>turning.</b> The machinability was examined through actual progression of tool wear, burr formation, surface deformation and chip microstructure. These investigations showed less flank wear when machining fully age hardened Waspaloy compared to solution annealed Alloy 718. The hardness had a significant effect on the flank wear within each alloy, while the effect of grain size was much more limited. The grain size was found to affect the deformation behaviour, the large grain size material exhibits more inhomogeneous deformation then the same material in the small grain size condition. Inhomogeneous deformation occurs when the size of the grains was in the same order of magnitude as the feed rate and the inhomogeneous deformation was connected with large notch wear and also with burr formation. The deformation of the machined surface was also larger (deeper) in the large grain size material. Inhomogeneous deformation also affects the chip formation, the chips from the coarse grain microstructures are much more serrated, with larger segmentation depth...|$|E
40|$|Superalloys {{are used}} in {{applications}} such as turbines, steam power plants and nuclear power systems in components that require good high temperature properties and/or corrosion resistance. They are classified as difficult-to-cut materials and hence, from a sustainable production point of view, tool wear and tool life are major factors when machining these alloys. The work presented in this thesis provides insight {{to the influence of}} microstructure on the machining of the nickel and nickel-iron based superalloys Waspaloy and Alloy 718 (commonly known as Inconel 718), respectively. The influence of microstructure, with respect to grain size and hardness, on machining is investigated in a <b>transverse</b> <b>turning</b> operation through the assessment of tool wear, wear mechanisms, surface deformation in the machined material, burr formation and characteristics of the chips. Concerning flank wear, machining of Waspaloy is associated with less wear than machining of Alloy 718. Fully age hardened Waspaloy showed even less flank wear than solution annealed Alloy 718 irrespective of grain size. This observation cannot be explained by cutting resistance, since Waspaloy shows higher cutting forces. Surface analysis shows a difference in tribological conditions on the flank face of the tool, which influences the magnitude of flank wear. The wear mechanisms when machining these alloys are concluded to be a combination of adhesive, abrasive, diffusion and dissolution mechanisms, but also associated with a beneficial effect of oxidation of tungsten, leading to potential formation of low-friction surface just beneath the flank wear zone. The grain size of the work material was found to affect the deformation behaviour in the metal cutting process. Inhomogeneous deformation occurs when the size of the grains is in the same order of magnitude as the undeformed chip thickness, in both solution annealed and fully precipitation hardened condition irrespective of the alloy composition. The inhomogeneous deformation was connected with large depth of cut notch wear and burr formation, together with formation of segmented chips. Depth of cut notch wear is the tool life limiting factor when machining the work material with the large grain size. Finally, a method for analysing and identifying crucial variables in the material specification that affect the machinability of the work material is presented...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A general {{formalism}} {{for understanding}} the thermodynamics of horizons in spherically symmetric spacetimes is developed. The formalism reproduces known results {{in the case of}} black hole spacetimes and can handle more general situations like: (i) spacetimes which are not asymptotically flat (like the de Sitter spacetime) and (ii) spacetimes with multiple horizons having different temperatures (like the Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime) and provide a consistent interpretation for temperature, entropy and energy. I show {{that it is possible to}} write Einstein’s equations for a spherically symmetric spacetime in the form TdS −dE = PdV near any horizon of radius a with S = (1 / 4) (4 πa 2), |E | = (a/ 2) and the temperature T determined from the surface gravity at the horizon. The pressure P is provided by the source of the Einstein’s equations and dV is the change in the volume when the horizon is displaced infinitesimally. The same results can be obtained by evaluating the quantum mechanical partition function without using Einstein’s equations or WKB approximation for the action. Both the classical and quantum analysis provide a simple and consistent interpretation of entropy and energy for de Sitter spacetime as well as for (1 + 2) dimensional gravity. For the Rindler spacetime the entropy per unit <b>transverse</b> area <b>turns</b> out to be (1 / 4) while the energy is zero.

(ii) QFT near any horizon is mapped to a conformal field theory without introducing concepts from string theory. (iii) For spherically symmetric spacetimes (in D= 1 + 3) with a horizon at r=l, the partition function has the generic form Z∝[S-β E], where S= (1 / 4) 4 π l^ 2 and |E|=(l/ 2). This analysis reproduces the conventional result for the blackhole spacetimes and provides a simple and consistent interpretation of entropy and energy for deSitter spacetime. (iv) For the Rindler spacetime the entropy per unit <b>transverse</b> area <b>turns</b> out to be (1 / 4) while the energy is zero. (v) In {{the case of a}} Schwarzschild black hole there exist quantum states (like Unruh vacuum) which are not invariant under time reversal and can describe blackhole evaporation.

The use of the maximum interquark separation as a common infrared cut-off in the Sudakov suppression factor is proposed, since it avoids difficulties with the α _s-singularities and yields a proton form factor insensitive to {{the inclusion of the}} soft region which therefore can be confidently attributed to perturbative QCD.

It <b>turns</b> out that the perturbative contribution, although theoretically self-consistent for Q^ 2 larger than about 6 GeV^ 2 to 10 GeV^ 2, is too small compared to the data.

40|$|A general {{formalism}} {{for understanding}} the thermodynamics of horizons in spherically symmetric spacetimes is developed. The formalism reproduces known results {{in the case of}} black hole spacetimes. But its power lies in being able to handle more general situations like: (i) spacetimes which are not asymptotically flat (like the de Sitter spacetime) and (ii) spacetimes with multiple horizons having different temperatures (like the Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime) and provide a consistent interpretation for temperature, entropy and energy. I show {{that it is possible to}} write Einstein's equations for a spherically symmetric spacetime in the form TdS-dE=PdV near any horizon of radius a with S=(1 / 4) (4 π a^ 2), |E| = (a/ 2) and the temperature T determined from the surface gravity at the horizon. The pressure P is provided by the source of the Einstein's equations and dV is the change in the volume when the horizon is displaced infinitesimally. The same results can be obtained by evaluating the quantum mechanical partition function without using Einstein's equations or WKB approximation for the action. Both the classical and quantum analysis provide a simple and consistent interpretation of entropy and energy for de Sitter spacetime as well as for (1 + 2) dimensional gravity. For the Rindler spacetime the entropy per unit <b>transverse</b> area <b>turns</b> out to be (1 / 4) while the energy is zero. The approach also shows that the de Sitter horizon [...] like the Schwarzschild horizon [...] is effectively one dimensional as far as the flow of information is concerned, while the Schwarzschild-de Sitter, Reissner-Nordstrom horizons are not. The implications for spacetimes with multiple horizons are discussed.
