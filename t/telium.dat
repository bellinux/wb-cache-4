40|$|Psychotria nervosa, {{commonly}} called “wild coffee” (Rubiaceae), {{is an important}} ethno-medicinal plant in India. In 2010, a new rust disease of P. nervosa was observed in three regions of Mysore District, Karnataka (India), with disease incidence ranging from 58 to 63 %. Typical symptoms of the rust disease on wild coffee were prominently visible during the early monsoon season (May to June), with chlorotic spots on the adaxial and black pustules (telia) on the abaxial leaf surface. Telia produced abundant teliospores, which were bicelled, pedicillate, and measured 33 to 45 by 19 to 30 μm. The germination of teliospores produced a typical metabasidium bearing four basidiospores, each containing two haploid nuclei. Spore stages of the wild coffee rust pathogen were studied using artificially inoculated healthy wild coffee plants with germinated teliospores. Only telia were observed on the inoculated plants, indicating that this rust fungus has an abbreviated microcyclic life cycle that includes only teliospores and basidiospores. Phylogenetic analysis based on internal transcribed spacer and partial large subunit (LSU) sequence data showed that the wild coffee rust pathogen is related to Macruropyxis fraxini, Puccinia bartholomaei, P. choridis, and P. sparganioidis. The herbarium sample of P. psychotriae was examined and was shown to be different with respect to <b>telium</b> size and teliospore dimensions (24 to 32 by 13 to 18 μm). Therefore, the rust pathogen causing wild coffee rust is a new species, P. mysuruensis sp. nov...|$|E
40|$|The leaf rust {{disease in}} Plumeria first {{appeared}} in Sri Lanka {{some time in the}} year 2002 and is now widespread. The disease is found in both Plumeria rubra and P. obtusa (Apocynaceae) and the infected leaves show numerous tiny, raised, orange, rusty pustules on the abaxial surface of the leaf. The adaxial surface opposite to infected sites is chlorotic reducing the available photosynthetic area of the leaf. Symptoms were absent in the stem or flowers. The causal agent was identified as Coleosporium plumeriae. This is the first report of Plumeria leaf rust in Sri Lanka. Microscopic studies indicated the presence of uredia, formed from the transversing mycelium and emerged through ruptured lower epidermis. No other fruiting structures, <b>telium,</b> aecium or spermatium were encountered at any stage of the disease in Plumeria or in Pinus, which was previously reported as a secondary host of C. plumeriae. Two other fungi, Absidia sp. and Verticillium sp., were found to colonize the rust areas of more mature leaves in succession, Absidia sp. appearing first. These two fungi grew as mycoparasites on C. plumeriae and had no direct contact with the leaf tissue. However, colonization by these two fungi resulted in necrosis around the rust infections inflicting damage to leaves. Young leaves down to about the third from the apical bud are resistant to rust infection. Young leaves contain more latex compared to mature leaves and the latex shows inhibitory action against germination of uredospores. Latex was found to possess chitinase activity on a gel diffusion assay. Latex may therefore be playing a role in the resistance of young leaves against rust infection...|$|E
