5|$|If a {{defendant}} is convicted, the usual remedy for {{a violation of}} one of <b>these</b> <b>provisions</b> is reversal of the conviction or modification of the defendant's sentence. With the exception of structural errors (such as the total denial of counsel), constitutional errors are subject to harmless error analysis, although they must be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. With {{the exception of a}} Double Jeopardy or Speedy Trial violation, the government will usually be permitted to retry the defendant. Pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), <b>these</b> <b>provisions</b> are the source of nearly all reviewable errors in federal habeas review of state convictions.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} other {{provisions}} of the UN Charter that deal with transitional arrangements, and thus are now spent. For example, article 61(3) and article 109(3). However, In Larger Freedom does not contain any proposals with respect to <b>these</b> <b>provisions.</b>|$|E
500|$|According to Stacy and Dayton, <b>these</b> <b>provision</b> are [...] "compelling {{evidence}} that the founders did not intend the national role in criminal law {{to be limited to}} crimes expressly mentioned in the Constitution." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{provisions}} largely {{apply to}} England and Wales, and Northern Ireland but some provisions, as to disclosure and sharing {{of information and}} proceeds of crime, apply in Scotland. <b>These</b> <b>provision</b> fall under the Sewel convention which demands {{the consent of the}} Scottish Parliament for Westminster to legislate on devolved issues. Such consent was granted.|$|R
50|$|On retrial, with <b>these</b> new <b>provisions,</b> Escamilla {{was acquitted}} of the charges.|$|R
5|$|There are bellmouths {{and space}} for two {{additional}} trackways (for {{a total of}} six) on the BMT Fourth Avenue Line south of 59th Street. <b>These</b> <b>provisions</b> were for the Staten Island Tunnel, which would have intersected with the line south of 59th Street.|$|E
5|$|One {{possible}} {{interpretation of}} <b>these</b> <b>provisions</b> is that unlawful non-citizens {{should be kept}} in detention for as long as necessary to remove them, and that if removing them never became practicable, that they would be detained until death. In contrast, Al-Kateb argued that the provisions only allowed unlawful non-citizens to be detained while removal was a practical possibility, and that if removal was not a practical possibility, then they should be released from detention, at least while it remained impractical.|$|E
5|$|Sections 9A(3)(b) and 9A(3)(c) of the Interpretation Act {{contemplate}} {{the use of}} explanatory statements to a tabled bill or a speech made by a minister {{on the occasion of}} the motion for the second reading of the bill as interpretive aids. However, they do not permit reference to other explanatory statements or speeches. The statements the court may refer to under <b>these</b> <b>provisions</b> are strictly the statements concerning the bill in question.|$|E

5|$|Throughout its history, the {{coverage}} formula remained controversial because it singled out certain jurisdictions, {{most of which}} were in the Deep South. In Shelby County v. Holder (2013), the Supreme Court declared {{the coverage}} formula unconstitutional because the criteria used were outdated and thus violated principles of equal state sovereignty and federalism. The other special provisions that are dependent on the coverage formula, such as the Section 5 preclearance requirement, remain valid law. However, without a valid coverage formula, <b>these</b> <b>provisions</b> are unenforceable.|$|E
5|$|In December 1921, the Anglo-Irish Treaty was {{concluded}} between the British Government {{and representatives of}} the Second Dáil. It gave Ireland complete independence in its home affairs and practical independence for foreign policy, but an opt-out clause allowed Northern Ireland to remain within the United Kingdom, which it immediately exercised as expected. Additionally, an oath of allegiance to the King was to be taken. Disagreements over <b>these</b> <b>provisions</b> led to a split in the nationalist movement and a subsequent Irish Civil War between the new government of the Irish Free State and those opposed to the treaty, led by Éamon de Valera. The civil war officially ended in May 1923 when de Valera issued a cease-fire order.|$|E
5|$|Justinian's {{religious}} policy {{reflected the}} Imperial {{conviction that the}} unity of the Empire presupposed unity of faith, and it appeared to him obvious that this faith could only be the orthodox (Nicaean). Those of a different belief were subjected to persecution, which imperial legislation had effected from the time of Constantius II and which would now vigorously continue. The Codex contained two statutes that decreed the total destruction of paganism, even in private life; <b>these</b> <b>provisions</b> were zealously enforced. Contemporary sources (John Malalas, Theophanes, John of Ephesus) tell of severe persecutions, even of men in high position. In 529, the Neoplatonic Academy of Athens was placed under state control as paganism, strangling this training school for this branch of Hellenistic philosophy..|$|E
40|$|As {{requested}} by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, this note focuses on Articles 14 and 15 of the proposed Directive on services. <b>These</b> two <b>provisions</b> are crucial: they define the "screening" process and the timetable which will make operational the "country of origin" principle (Article 16) on which the Directive crucially relies. As <b>these</b> two <b>provisions</b> raise economic more than legal questions, this note focuses on {{the economics of the}} Directive...|$|R

5|$|On March 15, Washington defused the Newburgh {{situation}} by {{giving a speech}} to the officers. Congress ordered the Army officially disbanded in April 1783. In the same month, Congress passed a new measure for a twenty-five-year impost—which Hamilton voted against—that again required the consent of all the states; it also approved a commutation of the officers' pensions to five years of full pay. Rhode Island again opposed <b>these</b> <b>provisions,</b> and Hamilton's robust assertions of national prerogatives in his previous letter were widely held to be excessive.|$|E
5|$|The Fundamental Rights {{is defined}} as the basic human rights of all citizens. These rights, defined in Part III of the Constitution, apply {{irrespective}} of race, place of birth, religion, caste, creed, or gender. They are enforceable by the courts, subject to specific restrictions. The Directive Principles of State Policy are guidelines for the framing of laws by the government. <b>These</b> <b>provisions,</b> set out in Part IV of the Constitution, are not enforceable by the courts, but the principles on which they are based are fundamental guidelines for governance that the State is expected to apply in framing and passing law's.|$|E
5|$|The {{costs of}} <b>these</b> <b>provisions</b> are offset by taxes, fees, and {{cost-saving}} measures, {{such as new}} Medicare taxes for those in high-income brackets, taxes on indoor tanning, cuts to the Medicare Advantage program in favor of traditional Medicare, and fees on medical devices and pharmaceutical companies; {{there is also a}} tax penalty {{for those who do not}} obtain health insurance, unless they are exempt due to low income or other reasons. In March 2010, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the net effect of both laws will be a reduction in the federal deficit by $143billion over the first decade.|$|E

5|$|The new {{parliament}} passed {{a set of}} measures known as the Provisions of Oxford, which Henry swore to uphold. <b>These</b> <b>provisions</b> created a smaller council of 15 members, elected solely by the barons, which then {{had the power to}} appoint England's justiciar, chancellor and treasurer, and which would be monitored through triennial parliaments. Pressure from the lesser barons and the gentry present at Oxford also helped to push through wider reform, intended to limit the abuse of power by both the King's officials and the major barons. More radical measures were passed by the new council the next year, {{in the form of the}} Provisions of Westminster.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} {{repatriation}} {{did not end}} there, though. Upon their return to Australia the effort shifted towards placing the returned soldiers into employment, or education {{and taking care of}} those that were too badly injured to work. In order to meet these needs the Commonwealth established the Repatriation Department, tasked with managing the placement of returned soldiers into employment, training, education, housing. Eventually this also included the colossal task of managing the provision of war pensions, managing repatriation hospitals and convalescent homes and administering the Soldier Settlement Scheme. The total cost of <b>these</b> <b>provisions</b> was considerable, and in June 1935 it was estimated to have cost approximately £238,000,000 which was more than the total amount spent on defence during the war.|$|E
5|$|<b>These</b> <b>provisions</b> {{are similar}} to those set out in section 5 of the Theft Act 1968 in {{relation}} to theft. It is clearly a right of property ownership to deal with property as one wishes, including its damage or destruction. However a person setting fire to his own house which is subject to a mortgage can be charged because the mortgagee will have a proprietary right or interest in the property. Property that is abandoned has no owner, and cannot be stolen; it follows that such property cannot be the subject of a charge of criminal damage.|$|E

50|$|The Constitutional Court, in S v Steyn, has {{declared}} <b>these</b> new <b>provisions</b> to be unconstitutional. The court's six-month moratorium has expired; accordingly sections 309B and 309C, {{in their original}} form, have fallen away.|$|R
5|$|<b>These</b> <b>provisions</b> covered both Cartledge-like {{situations}} and {{cases where the}} injured party, while aware of his injuries, does not connect them to the true cause until {{more than three years}} after the injuries were sustained. The act had a limited retrospective effect - it covered injuries that had happened before the Act came into force if an action had not been brought. If a judgment had already been made in a case, the Act could not apply to it, meaning the Act actually had no effect on the Cartledge case itself.|$|E
5|$|Two {{provisions}} require certain jurisdictions {{to provide}} election materials to voters in multiple languages: Section 4(f)(4) and Section 203(c). A jurisdiction covered by either provision must provide all materials {{related to an}} election—such as voter registration materials, ballots, notices, and instructions—in the language of any applicable language minority group residing in the jurisdiction. Language minority groups protected by <b>these</b> <b>provisions</b> include Asian Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and Native Alaskans. Congress enacted the provisions to break down language barriers and combat pervasive language discrimination against the protected groups.|$|E
5|$|Weber {{joined the}} worker and soldier council of Heidelberg in 1918. He then {{served in the}} German {{delegation}} to the Paris Peace Conference and as advisor to the Confidential Committee for Constitutional Reform, which drafted the Weimar Constitution. Motivated by {{his understanding of the}} American model, he advocated a strong, popularly elected presidency as a constitutional counterbalance {{to the power of the}} professional bureaucracy. More controversially, he also defended the provisions for emergency presidential powers that became Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution. <b>These</b> <b>provisions</b> were later used by Adolf Hitler to subvert the rest of the constitution and institute rule by decree, allowing his regime to suppress opposition and gain dictatorial powers.|$|E

The reply from Jim Knight, (Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Rural Affairs, Landscape and Biodiversity) was that [...] "hese applications are made under section 147 of the Inclosure Act 1845.
