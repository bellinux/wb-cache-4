Children with FXS pull away from light touch and can find textures of materials to be irritating. Transitions from one location to another can be difficult for children with FXS.

25|$|Now {{imagine that}} this woman grows up and has {{children}} with a brown-haired man who also has a Bb genotype. Her eggs will be a mixture of two types, one sort containing the B allele, and one sort the b allele. Similarly, her partner will produce a mix of two types of sperm containing {{one or the other}} of these two alleles. When the transmitted genes are joined up in their offspring, <b>these</b> <b>children</b> <b>have</b> a chance of getting either brown or red hair, since they could get a genotype of BB = brown hair, Bb = brown hair or bb = red hair. In this generation, there is therefore a chance of the recessive allele showing itself in the phenotype of the children—some of them may have red hair like their grandfather.|$|E
25|$|DSPD often {{coordinates}} and collaborates {{with other}} state agencies {{to provide care}} for recipients of ID/RC HCBS waiver serves. Perhaps the strongest inter-agency partnership exists between the Division and the Division of Child and Family Services. These two state agencies often work together on crossover issues regarding their two respective populations. The most common crossover issue involves children who have experienced traumatic abuse or neglect and demonstrate extreme behavioral issues. Unfortunately, victims of acute abuse and neglect also experience significant developmental delays and thus qualify for services. In cases where <b>these</b> <b>children</b> <b>have</b> no other family or guardians, DSPD steps in to provide long-term care. Often, the child remains in the custody and guardianship of Child and Family Services. Division and Child and Family Services staff work closely together in these cases to ensure that services are administered appropriately and {{that the child is}} safe and healthy.|$|E
500|$|To Marianne Hirsch, Spiegelman's life is [...] "dominated by {{memories}} {{that are not}} his own". [...] His work is one not of memory but of postmemory—a term she coined after encountering Maus. [...] This describes {{the relation of the}} children of survivors with the survivors themselves. [...] While <b>these</b> <b>children</b> <b>have</b> not had their parents' experiences, they grow up with their parents' memories—the memory of another's memory—until the stories become so powerful that for these children they become memories in their own right. [...] The children's proximity creates a [...] "deep personal connection" [...] with the memory, though separated from it by [...] "generational distance".|$|E

2500|$|From {{the mid to}} late 19th century Canada had {{a policy}} of {{assisting}} immigrants from Europe, including city people and an estimated 100,000 unwanted [...] "Home Children" [...] from Britain. The modern descendants of <b>these</b> <b>children</b> <b>have</b> been estimated at five million, contributing to Canada's identity as the [...] "country of the abandoned". Offers of free land attracted farmers from Central and Eastern Europe to the prairies, as well as large numbers of Americans who settled to a great extent in Alberta. Several immigrant groups settled in sufficient densities to create communities of a sufficient size to exert an influence on Canadian identity, such as Ukrainian Canadians. Canada began to see itself as a country that needed and welcomed people from countries besides its traditional sources of immigrants, accepting Germans, Poles, Dutch and Scandinavians in large numbers before the First World War.|$|E
2500|$|Lack of {{sanitation}} in bathing, toilets, {{and water}} {{also contributes to}} poor health. In the same study of street children in Bombay, 29.6 percent of children reported bathing in the sea and 11.5 percent reported bathing in pipes, wells, or canals. Open air bathing of street children {{is in fact a}} very common sight in all parts of India. <b>These</b> <b>children</b> <b>have</b> to put their naked bodies on display {{for a very long time}} before, during and after bathing. As a result, they develop hardly any sense of modesty. They as well as the onlookers have a casual approach to this phenomenon. Street children also lack restroom facilities, demonstrated by the fact that 26.4 percent of the children used the roadside or railway line for their toilet. For water, the children reported asking restaurants or hotels for water (69.1 percent) or using pipes and water taps (15.6 percent).|$|E

The {{contemporary}} chronicler Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie wrote that Hepburn [...] "ever {{was a master}} of whores all of his days and committed whoredom and adultery both with maidens and men's wives". By at least five different mistresses he produced at least thirteen illegitimate children. He had four sons and one daughter by Isabel Liddell, namely Patrick, Adam, George, John and Jane; by another mistress, Marion Strang, he had one son, whose name was William; with Janet Urquhart, he fathered another three sons and one daughter, Patrick, David, Thomas, and Joanna; with Elizabeth Innes, he sired a son named Alexander; and by a mistress whose name has not survived he had a further two daughters. Bishop Hepburn eventually had ten of his bastards legitimised, and indeed it is largely down to his efforts to achieve legitimisation that the names of many of <b>these</b> <b>children</b> <b>have</b> been recorded in the Register of the Great Seal.|$|E

Let us take hold of these little ones at once. They are now soft, plastic, mouldable; a tone will stir their young souls to the very depths, a look will affect them for ever. But a hardening process has commenced within them, and if they are not seized at once, they will become harder than adamant; and then scalding tears, and the most earnest trials, will be all but useless.|$|E
