It is adorned with relief portraits of famous lawmakers and lawgivers throughout history. Of the twenty-three relief portraits only Moses is sculpted from a full front view and is located across from the dais where the Speaker of the House ceremonially sits.|$|E
25|$|President Obama also {{attempted}} to address inequality before taxes (i.e., market income), {{with an increase}} in the minimum wage and infrastructure investment. While the Republican Congress did not support a federally-mandated {{increase in the minimum wage}}, 18 states did increase their minimum wages, benefiting an estimated 7 million workers, following the President's 2013 State of <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> <b>speech</b> calling for an increase. During late 2015, the House and Senate, in rare bipartisan form, passed the largest infrastructure package in a decade, costing $305 billion over five years, less than the $478 billion in Obama's initial request. He signed the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act into law in December 2015.|$|E

We find strong evidence for Reagan's usage of the civil religion rhetoric: over half (59 %) of the discourse in his seminal and 48 % in his State of <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> <b>speeches</b> focus on civil religion. We also find an apparent shift in modern presidential rhetoric, from themes concerned with (1) institutions, to ones focused more on (2) individuals, families, and children...|$|R

500|$|Prior to June 2014, Obama offered {{substantial}} {{support for a}} broadly-based [...] "All of the above" [...] approach to domestic energy policy, which Obama has maintained since his first term and which he last confirmed at his State of <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> <b>speech</b> in January 2014 to a mixed reception by both parties. In June 2014, Obama made indications that his administration would consider a shift towards an energy policy more closely tuned to the manufacturing industry {{and its impact on}} the domestic economy. Obama's approach of selectively combining regulation and incentive to various issues in the domestic energy policy such as coal mining and oil fracking has received mixed commentary for not being as responsive to the needs of the domestic manufacturing sector as needed, following claims that the domestic manufacturing sector utilizes as much as a third of the nation's available energy resources.|$|E
500|$|R.A., {{writing on}} The Economists Free Exchange blog, {{concluded}} that Cowen's analysis of education {{suggested that the}} rich world would do better by aiding mass education programs in developing countries rather than pursuing the diminishing returns in domestic education and research, in contrary [...] to President Obama's State of <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> <b>speech</b> in 2011. Looser immigration law would also allow rich and poor countries to exploit this source of growth. Secondly, it proposed to harvest [...] "policy low-hanging fruit" [...] i.e. reforming or abolishing foolish and costly policies. It proposed taxing [...] "bads" [...] such as traffic congestion and pollution rather than [...] "goods" [...] such as income, reducing spending on medical treatments with no clear benefits, and removing agricultural subsidies and mortgage interest reduction. In The Economist, two different sets of policy responses were considered {{depending on whether the}} true cause is ailing technological innovation or a decline in workers' bargaining power in the face of emerging-market industrialization. Progressive taxation and redistribution would offset labor's position of weakness whilst a limited state would reduce commitments it cannot expect to fulfill in a stagnating economy.|$|E

They claimed that the President [...] "had created a police state" [...] in the area around the Congress building and interpreted it as a violation of the Constitution that made it impossible for Congress to be called into session, and thereby enabling Fox to address the chamber. He explicitly told his followers not to be lured into violent confrontations, declaring, [...] "We aren't going to fall into any trap. We aren't going to be provoked".

25|$|State of <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> <b>speeches</b> usually last {{a little}} over an hour, {{partly because of the}} large amounts of applause that occur from the {{audience}} throughout. The applause is often political in tone, with many portions of the speech being applauded only by members of the President's own party. As non-political officeholders, members of the Supreme Court or the Joint Chiefs of Staff rarely applaud in order to retain the appearance of political impartiality. In recent years, the presiding officers of the House and the Senate, the Speaker and the Vice President, respectively, have departed from the neutrality expected of presiding officers of deliberative bodies, as they, too, stand and applaud in response to the remarks of the President with which they agree.|$|R

When asked if the speech was an indication of competition with Ryan and Speaker Boehner's leadership team, Bachmann dismissed such a view as [...] "a fiction of the media", she had alerted Ryan and the leadership team that her response might go national and no objections were raised.|$|E
2500|$|Although the United States {{declared}} war on Germany on April 6, 1917, it did not initially declare war on the other Central Powers, a state of affairs that Woodrow Wilson described as an [...] "embarrassing obstacle" [...] in his State of <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> <b>speech.</b> Congress {{declared war}} on the Austro-Hungarian Empire on December 7, 1917, but never made declarations of war against the other Central Powers, Bulgaria, the Ottoman Empire or the various co-belligerents allied with the Central Powers.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} set {{out with the}} purpose to {{investigate}} the potential shifts in how victory {{is presented in the}} duration of contemporary conflicts. The argumentation is focused on how democratic states, involved in wars, seem to announce different statements regarding victory in its outreach to its inhabitants. This paper will study the case of the American administration of George W. Bush, who initiated and ruled during the first years in the Global War on Terror. By investigating the seven annual State of <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> <b>speeches</b> in a combined quantitative–qualitative method, with Martel’s theoretical framework on victory, the analysis searched after such potential shifts or static usage of the linguistics approach to victory. The answer to the stated research question according to the study conducted by this author is that the publicly announced implications of victory have been subjected to an ongoing shift during the examined time period...|$|R

40|$|State of <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> {{addresses}} {{have always}} allowed presents to argue {{their views on}} policy issues. Arguments, however, even those in presidential speeches, can rely on fallacies as well as valid statements. This investigation sought to find a correlation between the validity/fallacy ratio in each speech and the president’s average approval rating over the two {{months prior to the}} address. State of <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> <b>speeches</b> were selected from Franklin Roosevelt to George W. Bush and the ratio of the number of lines of validities to fallacies was calculated for each speech. A high approval rating had a weak positive association with a high validity/fallacy ratio (few fallacies per validity), yet the correlation was obscured by outliers. When validity/fallacy ratios were calculated for various policy issues, the issues generally considered the most urgent had a low validity/fallacy ratio (many fallacies per validity), while the more distant issues had higher validity/fallacy ratios. The difference between the two types of issues was found to be statistically significant (p < 0. 05). The discrepancy is explained by the different audiences towards which the president directs each argument—fallacies to the public on urgent issues and logical arguments to Congressmen on more distant ones.

This thesis contributes to an ongoing debate in the literature attempting to define propaganda, and its permanence in news coverage during times of war.
