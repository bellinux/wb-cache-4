5|$|Galenas keel {{was laid}} down by Maxson, Fish & Co. in 1861 and she was {{launched}} on 14 February 1862. The ship was commissioned on 21 April 1862 with Commander Alfred Taylor in command. Galena arrived in Hampton Roads on 24 April, after having suffered several engine breakdowns en route, and was assigned to Flag Officer L.M. Goldsborough's North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. Commander John Rodgers relieved Taylor the same day. When Goldsborough inspected the ship shortly after her arrival he ordered that her spars be cut away and the nuts on <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hull to be covered with sheet iron {{to prevent them from}} breaking loose when the ship was hit.|$|E
5|$|The female {{may begin}} feeding by biting off the male's head (as {{they do with}} regular prey), and if mating has begun, the male's {{movements}} may become even more vigorous in its delivery of sperm. Early researchers thought that because copulatory movement is controlled by a ganglion in the abdomen, not the head, removal of the male's head was a reproductive strategy by females to enhance fertilization while obtaining sustenance. Later, this behavior {{appeared to be an}} artifact of intrusive laboratory observation. Whether the behavior is natural in the field or also the result of distractions caused by the human observer remains controversial. Mantises are highly visual organisms and notice any disturbance in the laboratory or field, such as bright lights or moving scientists. Chinese mantises that had been fed ad libitum (so that they were not hungry) actually displayed elaborate courtship behavior when left undisturbed. The male engages the female in a courtship dance, to change her interest from feeding to mating. Under such circumstances, the female has been known to respond with a defensive deimatic display by flashing the colored eyespots on <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> front legs.|$|E
500|$|In April 2008, the zoo {{decreased}} {{human interaction}} with the cub, hoping that one day she could coexist with members of her species and not be dependent on humans. [...] Becoming more independent from her keepers, Flocke was reported often playing happily on her own. [...] She was given a plastic [...] "dummy", similar to a child's teething ring, tied to the bars on <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> stable door to suckle on while resting. [...] This suckling caused the cub's nose to appear bent; her muzzle remained in this shape for some time before returning to normal.|$|E

50|$|The Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple is {{dedicated}} to the Hindu goddess Kali, fierce embodiment of Shakti and the god Shiva's wife, Parvati. Kali has always been popular in Bengal, the birthplace of the labourers who built this temple in 1881. Images of Kali within the temple show her wearing a garland of skulls and ripping out <b>the</b> <b>insides</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> victims, and Kali sharing more peaceful family moments with her sons Ganesha and Murugan.|$|R
500|$|Only {{a few of}} Lavigne's tattoos {{are unique}} to her; the rest are matched with those of her friends. Lavigne had a star tattooed on <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> left wrist that was created {{at the same time}} as friend and musical {{associate}} Ben Moody's identical tattoo. In late 2004, she had a small pink heart around the letter [...] "D" [...] applied to her right wrist, which represented her then-boyfriend, Deryck Whibley. Lavigne and then-husband Whibley got matching tattoos in March 2010, in celebration of his 30th birthday. In April 2010, Lavigne added another tattoo on her wrist, that of a lightning bolt and the number 30.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{have noted}} that her sound is more pop than rock, but Black is militant at her rock and roll image, saying [...] "...I know I'm rock n roll." [...] When asked {{about what it means}} to be rock and roll, she stated: [...] Genre-wise, her sound has been called [...] "{{industrial}} pop", a fusion of pop and industrial metal. Her flashy and irreverent image has been compared to the work of many other artists. Often, comparisons are drawn between her and Lady Gaga, but she has also been compared to Joan Jett, Courtney Love, and Nicki Minaj. Black's two-tone hairstyle and fashion is inspired by both Manson and Spears as well, along with her desire to develop a persona in which a stable duality between [...] "good" [...] and [...] "bad" [...] exists. The former has gained her comparisons to the cartoon character Cruella de Vil. Black disavows the association as completely unfounded, specifically saying, [...] "She's a [...] cartoon. Are you serious?" [...] Black calls her fans [...] "trainwrecks", alluding to the tattoo on <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> middle finger. Malcolm Harris, writing for The Huffington Post, discovered Porcelain Black on the cover of UnSound and reacted to her image: ...|$|E
500|$|In 2013 a Channel 4 {{documentary}} used forensic examiners who digitised {{the original}} nitrate film {{from the three}} cameras present. The film was digitally cleaned and examined. Their examination suggests that Davison intended to throw a suffragette flag {{around the neck of}} a horse or attach it to the horse's bridle. A flag was gathered from the course; this was put up for auction and, as at 2017, it hangs in the Houses of Parliament. Michael Tanner, the horse-racing historian and author of a history of the 1913 Derby, doubts the authenticity of the item. Sotheby's, the auction house who sold it, describe it as a sash that was [...] "reputed" [...] to have been worn by Davison. The seller stated that her father, Richard Pittway Burton, was the Clerk of the Course at Epsom; Tanner's search of records shows Burton was listed as a dock labourer two weeks prior to the Derby. The official Clerk of the Course {{on the day of the}} Derby was Henry Dorling. When the police listed Davison's possessions, they itemised the two flags provided by the WSPU, both folded up and pinned to <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> jacket. They measured 44.5 by 27 inches (113 x 69cm); the sash displayed at the Houses of Parliament measures 82 by 12 inches (210 x 30cm).|$|E
2500|$|Almeda {{was painted}} in Blue Star Line's {{standard}} livery <b>of</b> the era. <b>Her</b> hull was black, her boot-topping red and her masts white. Her stokehold ventilators were black and her deck ventilators were white, and <b>the</b> <b>insides</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> ventilator cowls were red. She had two funnels {{and they were}} red with a black top, with a narrow white and a narrow black band and on each side a large blue star on a white disc. In her original form Almedas funnels had a type of cowl called an [...] "Admiralty top".|$|R

2500|$|Major repairs were {{undertaken}} in 1814, including the fitting of [...] metal braces along <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hull, {{to strengthen the}} timbers. This was the first use of iron in the vessel structure, other than small bolts and nails. Active service was resumed from February 1817 when she was relisted as a first-rate carrying 104 guns. However her condition remained poor, and in January 1822 she was towed into dry dock at Portsmouth for repairs to her hull. Refloated in January 1824, she was designated as the Port admiral's flagship for Portsmouth Harbour, remaining in this role until April 1830.|$|E

She also had the words [...] "Move or Bleed" [...] {{on the left side}} of her rib cage, as well as a bouquet of sweet peas on her lower back.|$|E

2500|$|Her {{hair was}} {{naturally}} brown, red, or strawberry blond and was shoulder-length. She stood around five feet two {{inches tall and}} weighed between 103 and 110 pounds. She had wisdom teeth {{as well as a}} gap visible between two teeth on her upper right set. She wore earrings and painted her nails silver. The victim had dental fillings in some of her teeth, showing that she had seen a dentist. Her eyes were a hazel-blue (some sources state green) and a presumably amateur tattoo of an [...] "S" [...] was on <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> upper right arm. This tattoo appeared to have been [...] "inked" [...] not long before she died. She likely died a day before she was discovered. The victim had a suture procedure on one of her teeth, which led investigators to believe she was not impoverished.|$|E

But, fortunately, just when she was growing weak and dizzy, the horses ahead slowed to a walk on a descent. The road wound down into a wide deep canyon. Carley had a respite from her severest pains. Never before had she known {{what it meant to be}} so grateful for relief from anything.|$|E
6000|$|Very {{little was}} said {{between the two}} women on that morning {{respecting}} Mr. Gilmore. Mrs. Fenwick, who had allowed herself to be convinced that Mary would act with great impropriety {{if she did not}} accept the man, thought that further speech might only render her friend obstinate. Mary, who knew <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> friend's mind very clearly, and who loved and respected her friend, could hardly fix her own mind. During the past night it had been fixed, or nearly fixed, two different ways. She had first determined that she would refuse her lover,--as to which resolve, for some hours or so, she had been very firm; then that she would accept him,--as to which she had ever, when most that way inclined, entertained some doubt as to the possibility of her uttering that word [...] "Yes." ...|$|E
