5|$|At the 12th Daytime Emmy Awards held in 1985, Tracey E. Bregman was {{the first}} winner of this award for her role of Lauren Fenmore on The Young and <b>the</b> <b>Restless.</b> The awards {{ceremony}} had not been aired on television for the prior two years, having been criticized for voting integrity. The award was originally called Outstanding Ingenue in a Drama Series, the criteria of the new category were deemed confusing; performers of differing ages were nominated and critics argued some were of supporting or lead actress standards. Adding to the confusion, the first winner, Bregman, and the Outstanding Supporting Actress winner that year, Beth Maitland, played characters near to the same age. The category was renamed Outstanding Juvenile Female in a Drama Series in 1989 and began using its current title in 1991. The criteria were later altered, requiring that the actress be aged 25 or below.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, Chris Engen began portraying Adam as an adult. After {{a year in}} the role, Engen {{announced}} his exit from The Young and <b>the</b> <b>Restless</b> because of objections over his storyline, and Michael Muhney was recast in the role. Controversy arose two weeks after Muhney's debut when Adam seduced male character Rafe Torres (Yani Gellman). The media accused Engen of homophobia, but the actor dispelled these rumors, saying he was unhappy with his storyline long before the homosexuality plot twist was aired. In 2013, Muhney was fired from the role and made his last appearance on January 30, 2014; later that year, Justin Hartley was cast as Adam, who portrayed Adam for an additional two years before vacating the role on September 1, 2016.|$|E
