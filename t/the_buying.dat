Throughout the war years, most of the output of many large corporations was reserved for materiel production; however, management were keen to promote their connection {{to the war effort}} and keep their name before <b>the</b> <b>buying</b> public until they could resume peacetime sales. Coggins received advertising commissions from such corporations including Elco, Koppers, US Steel, and Westinghouse. He also received commissions from the U.S. War Department for aircraft recognition charts, and he was intrigued to later find these charts used during his army basic training.|$|E
5|$|East German {{citizens}} {{could also}} emigrate through the semi-secret route of being ransomed by the West German {{government in a}} process termed Freikauf (literally <b>the</b> <b>buying</b> of freedom). Between 1964 and 1989, 33,755political prisoners were ransomed. A further 2,087prisoners were released to the West under an amnesty in 1972. Another 215,000people, including 2,000children cut off from their parents, were allowed to leave East Germany to rejoin their families. In exchange, West Germany paid over 3.4 billion DM– nearly $2.3billion at 1990 prices– in goods and hard currency.|$|E
5|$|In December 2015 the Finnish MoD sent {{a letter}} to Great Britain, France, Sweden and the US informing them that the fighter project had been {{launched}} in the Defence Forces. The goal of the project is to replace the Hornet fleet, which will be decommissioned as of 2025, with multi-role fighters. The project has been named the HX Fighter Program. The JAS-39 is mentioned in the letter as a potential fighter for the program. The request for information concerning the HX Fighter Program was sent in April 2016. The five responses were received in November 2016. The official Request for Quotation will be sent to all five aircraft manufacturers that provided responses to the RFI, through their four governments, in the spring of 2018.

5|$|Rise of Mana is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game where the player takes control of two protagonists inhabiting a single body: the characters' genders and names can be customized prior to beginning the game. During gameplay, the character can switch between angelic and demonic forms: this enables the player to see thoughts in different non-player characters (NPCs), with each form showing {{different types of}} thought or prompting a different reaction from NPCs. The game uses a free-to-play gaming model: while the game can be downloaded and played for free, players {{have the option of}} spending money on in-game items. The characters' base is a room in a small village: in the room, players can check messages, and set their current equipment and weapons. A message board in the town provides access to social features. In the town, NPC-run shops enable the crafting of new weapons and equipment in exchange for in-game currency, along with <b>the</b> <b>buying</b> and selling of various in-game items.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the board game Monopoly {{can be traced back}} to the early 20th century. The {{earliest}} known version of Monopoly, known as The Landlord's Game, was designed by an American, Elizabeth Magie, and first patented in 1904 but existed as early as 1902. Magie, a follower of Henry George, originally intended The Landlord's Game to illustrate the economic consequences of Ricardo's Law of Economic rent and the Georgist concepts of economic privilege and land value taxation. A series of board games were developed from 1906 through the 1930s that involved <b>the</b> <b>buying</b> and selling of land and the development of that land. By 1933, a board game had been created much like the version of Monopoly sold by Parker Brothers and its related companies through the rest of the 20th century, and into the 21st. Several people, mostly in the Midwestern United States and near the East Coast, contributed to the game's design and evolution.|$|E
5|$|In {{the eighteenth}} century the {{development}} of the Grand Tour took young Scottish aristocrats to the continent, particularly Rome, which was home to the exiled Jacobite Stuarts. This in turn fuelled interest in classical and Renaissance styles, and <b>the</b> <b>buying</b> of artistic works, particularly sculptures. However, the only major Scottish collection of marble before the nineteenth century was that of James Johnstone, 2nd Marquess of Annandale. As in England, commissions of new statuary tended to be crafted in relatively cheap lead and even more economical painted or gilded plaster. The plasterwork of John Cheere's yard in London was particularly in demand. Also important was the work from the yard of John Bacon (1740–99). Bacon was also a partner in Mrs Eleanor Coade's Artificial Stone Manufactory at Lambeth in London. This produced a buff coloured ceramic that could be moulded to provide fine detail, and be fired in sections, but was impervious to frost and fire. Much cheaper than carved stone, Coadstone was used for sphinxes, balustrading, capitals, coats of arms, tablets and ornamental vases. It was used extensively by the Adam brothers, particularly in the houses they built in Scotland, such as Cullen, Banff, Culzean Castle, Ayrshire, Dunbar Castle, East Lothian, Gosford House, East Lothian and Wedderburn, Berwickshire. They also supplied sculpture, candelabra and cippi that made up the neo-classical Adam Style.|$|E
40|$|In English auctions, {{introducing}} a buy price, i. e., the seller’s maximum price bid at which any bidder {{at any time}} can immediately win the auction, allows the seller to gain higher expected utility than that in a traditional auction when either the seller or the buyers are risk-averse. If the seller sets <b>the</b> <b>buy</b> price high enough, the buyprice English auction is efficient and guarantees the highest bidder wins. Under this condition, the expected utilities of uniformly risk-averse buyers with CARA utilities remain {{the same as in}} a traditional auction, and the buy-price and traditional auctions are revenue equivalent when both the seller and the buyers are risk neutral. A bidder with a valuation above <b>the</b> <b>buy</b> price follows one of three possible pure strategies: If his valuation is very high, he would use <b>the</b> <b>buy</b> price unconditionally without trying to observe other bidders; If his valuation is relatively high, he would use <b>the</b> <b>buy</b> price on <b>the</b> condition that there exists another competing bidder; Otherwise, he would use <b>the</b> <b>buy</b> price when <b>the</b> current high bid reaches a threshold level between the reserve and <b>the</b> <b>buy</b> price.
