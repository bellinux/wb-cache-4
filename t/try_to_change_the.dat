5|$|Most of Æthelred's time as {{archbishop}} {{was spent}} {{dealing with the}} effects of Viking raids, but he also had a conflict with King Alfred the Great over royal control of ecclesiastical affairs. It was during Æthelred's archbishopric that the Golden Gospels, a still-surviving 8th century gospel book, was ransomed from a raiding army and donated to Canterbury. Pope John VIII also urged Æthelred and Archbishop Wulfhere of York to reform the dress of the English clergy. The Anglo-Saxon clergy wore the short tunic that was the normal costume of the laypeople of Britain. The Roman custom, however, was to wear long clerical robes or habits, and the Anglo-Saxon custom was opposed by the papacy and other continental clergy. Whether Æthelred and Wulfred took steps to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> dress of their clergy is unknown, but the clothing customs of the Anglo-Saxon clergy did not change.|$|E
5|$|Though these {{measures}} were established to counter {{many of the}} irrationalities in the Soviet economic system, the reform did not <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> existing system radically; it instead tried to improve it gradually. Success was ultimately mixed, and Soviet analyses on why the reform failed to reach its full potential have never given any definitive answers. The key factors are agreed upon, however, with blame being put on {{the combination of the}} recentralisation of the economy with the decentralisation of enterprise autonomy, creating several administrative obstacles. Additionally, instead of creating a market which in turn would establish a pricing system, administrators were given the responsibility for overhauling the pricing system themselves. Because of this, the market-like system failed to materialise. To make matters worse, the reform was contradictory at best. In retrospect, however, the Eighth Five-Year Plan as a whole is considered {{to be one of the}} most successful periods for the Soviet economy, and the most successful for consumer production.|$|E

25|$|Some materialists among modern {{historians have}} tried to read a form of class {{struggle}} into Sverre and the Birkebeiner's fight against Erling and Magnus. However, {{the extent to which}} Sverre's men actually represented the impoverished strata of the population remains disputed. It is clear that most of the lendmenn—the nobility of the time—sided with King Magnus, but Sverre also quickly won several of them over to his side. In any event, the Birkebeiner did not <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> social order of society; they merely wanted to place themselves at its top.|$|E
25|$|The {{military}} police {{was involved in}} various ways in Operation Peace for Galilee, although the bulk of its duties were according to standard procedure. The corps had ample {{time to prepare for}} the operation and very specific designations were made for it {{as a result of the}} lessons learned from the Yom Kippur War (see also: Sectors and operations during emergency). For the first time, it met a friendly population in Lebanon, which often cooperated with the IDF - this created a need for MP presence to prevent the soldiers from making illegal dealings with the locals. Placing road signs was also a major issue, as for the first time a major city (Beirut) needed to be labeled, and enemy forces would certainly <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> signs to mislead the IDF. To counter this, Graffiti was used on the city buildings to indicate direction.|$|E

Before he dies, the soldier informs Kratos that Zeus has destroyed Sparta in Kratos' absence. Outraged, Kratos is further motivated and frees a phoenix, riding the creature to the Sisters' stronghold where he confronts two, Lakhesis and Atropos. After they refuse his request to alter time, Kratos battles them. During this, the Sisters <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> outcome of Kratos' battle with Ares, but Kratos kills them both, then confronts the remaining Sister, Clotho.

[...] Despite this media and public relations training, industry sources stated, [...] "They gave him talking points and he just didn't execute". [...] The same sources also noted that, while [...] "Parker seemed at times to understand the need to emphasize his sorrow about the devastating impact of the 1999 encounter on {{the woman at the}} center of the charges, sources say when the cameras rolled he reverted to his original position." [...] In an October 2016 60 Minutes interview, Parker maintained that he was innocent of the crime and that he did not feel guilty about it, but conceded that, from the perspective of a 36-year-old man, he had done something morally wrong.|$|E

[...] However, [...] "Phillies" [...] {{continued}} {{to appear on the}} team's jerseys, with a blue jay appearing on the sleeves. The student council of Johns Hopkins University, whose varsity teams are also known as the Blue Jays, vehemently protested Carpenter's decision, claiming that the change dishonored their school due to the Phillies' losing history. [...] The nickname was officially dropped on January 10, 1950.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to Willingham's claims about student-athlete literacy, UNC released another report by {{a board of}} educational experts outside the university that examined data between 2004 and 2012. That report {{found that there were}} 341 men’s and women’s basketball players and football players during these years; of this group, 34 students did not meet CNN’s threshold of being [...] "college literate", which meant a minimum SAT reading score of 400 or an ACT score of 16; essentially, the university suggested that of its athletes, ten percent had academic issues. This is in contrast with the allegation by Mary Willingham, based on her personal investigations, that 60% of college athletes were not [...] "college literate". In another of her analyses, she found that 150 to 200 of 400 student-athletes were [...] "underperforming", some [...] "badly underperforming", with the last group being mostly made of men's and women's players of basketball and football. One view suggested that the university's {{response to}} these and other allegations was to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> focus away from wrongdoing, in part by challenging Willingham's assertions and research. The review board disputed her findings on the grounds that her methodology was not appropriate.|$|E

In a complaint filed to the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario, Ms. Zhao stated {{she was forced}} to hide her belief in the Falun Gong spiritual movement, which the Chinese government calls an illegal [...] "evil cult", and argued that McMaster [...] "is giving legitimization to discrimination." [...] She told an interviewer that during her CI training in Beijing, she was told that if students asked about Tibet or other sensitive topics, [...] "Don’t talk about this. If the student insists, you just <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> topic, or say something the Chinese Communist Party would prefer." [...] Andrea Farquhar, McMaster’s assistant vice-president of public and government affairs, said the university was [...] "looking for clarity" [...] from its Chinese partners on aspects of their agreement, notably hiring practices. Having lent its name to the Confucius Institute on its campus, Ms. Farquhar said McMaster was insisting that Canadian laws and expectations be respected. In 2013, McMaster University announced they would close their Confucius Institute. Andrea Farquhar explained that after months of making a concerted effort to save their 5-year partnership with Hanban, [...] "We were uncomfortable, and felt that it didn’t reflect the way the university would do hiring", and explained that McMaster’s Chinese partners replied with a letter expressing [...] "some disappointment." [...] Ms. Zhao, a Chinese citizen, has since been granted refugee status in Canada.|$|E

60|$|Copperhouse Cross in the Brake Hunt was a {{very popular}} meet. It was easily reached by a train from London, was in the centre of an {{essentially}} hunting country, was near {{to two or three}} good coverts, and was in itself a pretty spot. Two roads intersected each other on the middle of Copperhouse Common, which, as all the world knows, lies just on the outskirts of Copperhouse Forest. A steep winding hill leads down from the Wood to the Cross, and {{there is no such thing}} within sight as an enclosure. At the foot of the hill, running under the wooden bridge, straggles the Copperhouse Brook,--so called by the hunting men of the present day, though men who know the country of old, or rather the county, will tell you that it is properly called the river Cobber, and that the spacious old farm buildings above were once known as the Cobber Manor House. He would be a vain man who would now <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> name, as Copperhouse Cross has been printed in all the lists of hunting meets for at least the last thirty years; and the Ordnance map has utterly rejected the two b's. Along one of the cross-roads there was a broad extent of common, some seven or eight hundred yards in length, on which have been erected the butts used by those well-known defenders of their country, the Copperhouse Volunteer Rifles; and just below the bridge the sluggish water becomes a little lake, having probably at some time been artificially widened, and there is a little island and a decoy for ducks. On the present occasion carriages were drawn up on all the roads, and horses were clustered on each side of the brook, and the hounds sat stately on their haunches where riflemen usually kneel to fire, and there was a hum of merry voices, and the bright colouring of pink coats, and the sheen of ladies' hunting toilettes, and that mingled look of business and amusement which is so peculiar to our national sports. Two hundred men and women had come there for the chance of a run after a fox,--for a chance against which the odds are more than two to one at every hunting day,--for a chance as to which the odds are twenty to one against the success of the individuals collected; and yet, for every horseman and every horsewoman there, not less than £5 a head will have been spent for this one day's amusement. When we give a guinea for a stall at the opera we think that we pay a large sum; but we are fairly sure of having our music. When you go to Copperhouse Cross you are by no means sure of your opera.|$|E
