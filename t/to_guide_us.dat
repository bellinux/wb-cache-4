25|$|At the {{division}} of the land of Israel among the seven tribes not yet provided for, the lot of Zebulun was third. The tribe's territory started with Sarid (Joshua 19:10), which is supposed to have been Tel Shadud, some five miles southwest of Nazareth. Zebulun's boundaries have not been made out. Of the nineteen proper names that the book of Joshua gives <b>to</b> <b>guide</b> <b>us,</b> only Bethlehem of Galilee (Beit lahm, seven miles northwest of Nazareth) can be identified with certainty, although the archaeological site Tel Hanaton is associated with the city Hanaton listed as the boundary with Asher. The historian Josephus assigns to Zebulun the land near to Carmel and the sea, as far as the Lake of Genesareth. To its northwest lay Asher, to the southeast Issachar. It included a part of the Jezreel Valley, and the great highway from the sea to the lake. Within the territory of Zebulun, Jesus was raised, and did and said much that is narrated in the Gospels, especially in the Synoptics, about his Galilean ministry.|$|E

500|$|During the Vietnam War and the Laotian Civil War, Phou Pha Thi {{mountain}} was {{an important}} strategic outpost which had served both sides at various stages of the conflict. In 1966, the United States Ambassador to Laos approved a plan by the United States Air Force (USAF) to construct a TACAN site on top of Phou Pha Thi, as {{at the time they}} lacked a navigation site with sufficient range <b>to</b> <b>guide</b> <b>U.S.</b> bombers towards their targets in North Vietnam. In 1967 the site was upgraded with the air-transportable all-weather AN/TSQ-81 radar bombing control system. This enabled American aircraft to bomb North Vietnam and Laos at night and in all types of weather, an operation code-named Commando Club. Despite U.S. efforts to maintain the secrecy of the installation, which included the [...] "sheep-dipping" [...] of the airmen involved, U.S. operations at the facility did not escape the attention of the North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces.|$|E
500|$|Botanists responded favourably to {{the book}} {{immediately}} on its publication.

Daniel Oliver thought it [...] "very extraordinary", and even Darwin's old beetle-hunting rival Charles Babington, by then professor of botany at the University of Cambridge and inclined to oppose natural selection, called it [...] "exceedingly interesting and valuable... highly satisfactory in all respects. The results are most curious and the skill shown in discovering them equally so." [...] George Bentham praised its value in opening [...] "a new field for observing the wonderful provisions of Nature... a new and unexpected track <b>to</b> <b>guide</b> <b>us</b> in the explanation of phenomena which had before that appeared so irreconcilable with the ordinary prevision and method shown in the organised world." ...|$|E

Nazir-Ali argued that the decline of Christianity {{and the rise of}} liberal values in the UK during the 1960s had created a moral vacuum which radical Islam threatened to fill. He wrote that [...] "We have argued {{that it is necessary to}} understand where we have come from, <b>to</b> <b>guide</b> <b>us</b> to where we are going, and to bring us back when we wander too far from the path of national destiny."

2500|$|Smith {{asserted}} {{that he was}} not joking; he sincerely supported the amendment and, indeed, along with Rep. Martha Griffiths, he was the chief spokesperson for the amendment. For twenty years Smith had sponsored the Equal Rights Amendment (with no linkage to racial issues) in the House because he believed in it. He for decades had been close to the National Woman's Party and its leader Alice Paul, who was also the leader in winning the right to vote for women in 1920, the author of the first Equal Rights Amendment, and a chief supporter of equal rights proposals since then. She and other feminists had worked with Smith since 1945 {{trying to find a way}} to include sex as a protected civil rights category. Now was the moment. Griffiths argued that the new law would protect black women but not white women, and that was unfair to white women. Furthermore, she argued that the laws [...] "protecting" [...] women from unpleasant jobs were actually designed to enable men to monopolize those jobs, and that was unfair to women who were not allowed to try out for those jobs. The amendment passed with the votes of Republicans and Southern Democrats. The final law passed with the votes of Republicans and Northern Democrats. Thus, as Justice William Rehnquist explained in Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, [...] "The prohibition against discrimination based on sex was added to Title VII at the last minute on the floor of the House of Representatives... the bill quickly passed as amended, and we are left with little legislative history <b>to</b> <b>guide</b> <b>us</b> in interpreting the Act's prohibition against discrimination based on 'sex.|$|E
