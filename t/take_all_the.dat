5|$|Another account {{recalled}} how Marseille once ignored {{an order to}} turn back from a fight when outnumbered by two to one, but seeing an Allied aircraft closing on his wing leader, Marseille broke formation and shot the attacking aircraft down. Expecting congratulations when he landed, his commander was critical of his actions, receiving three days of confinement for failing to carry out an order. Days later, Marseille was passed over for promotion and was now the sole Fähnrich in the Geschwader. This was a humiliation for him, suspecting that his abilities were being suppressed so the squadron leaders could <b>take</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> glory in the air.|$|E

25|$|Sagan's {{contribution}} to the 1969 symposium was {{an attack on the}} belief that UFOs are piloted by extraterrestrial beings: Applying several logical assumptions (see Drake equation), Sagan calculated the possible number of advanced civilizations capable of interstellar travel to be about one million. He projected that any civilization wishing to check on all the others on a regular basis of, say, once a year would have to launch 10,000 spacecraft annually. Not only does that seem like an unreasonable number of launchings, but it would <b>take</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> material in one percent of the universe's stars to produce all the spaceships needed for all the civilizations to seek each other out.|$|E
25|$|In 1931, Park {{tied with}} local rivals Wallasey for the {{championship}} which {{was made possible by}} the acquisition of fast bowler Jack Bartley who took 67 wickets at an average of 10.37. During two spells with the club between 1931 and 1936, Bartley would take over 400 wickets for which two of those seasons would see him snare over 100 dismissals. He became the second 1st XI bowler to <b>take</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> wickets in a match as he claimed 10-37 against New Brighton in 1935.It was in that particular year that saw Park celebrate winning the championship again. It was a second title success for captain Arthur Cooke who was to take charge of the 1st XI on three separate occasions (1929-1932, 1934-1936 and 1938-1939).|$|E
25|$|When Gonzalo {{arrived at}} the main bohío of Quemuenchatocha, he found the Muisca ruler sitting in his throne and {{surrounded}} by his closest companions. All men were dressed in expensive mantles and adorned with golden crowns. On August 20, 1537, the Spanish beat the zaque and the big and strong Muisca ruler was taken captive to Suesca. There he was tortured and the Spanish soldiers hoped he would reveal where he hid his precious properties. The absence of Quemuenchatocha paved the route for his nephew Aquiminzaque to succeed him as ruler of the northern Muisca, a practice common in Muisca traditions. When Quemuenchatocha was finally released from captivity in Suesca, he fled to Ramiriquí, where he died shortly after. The Spanish soldiers found gold, emeralds, silver, mantles and other valuables in Tunja. They {{were not able to}} <b>take</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> precious pieces and many were secretly taken away by the Muisca, using folded deer skins. They hid the valuables in nearby hills.|$|E

25|$|Bagman loves gambling, {{which got}} him in {{financial}} trouble so severe that he pays some of his creditors (including Fred and George Weasley) with disappearing Leprechaun Gold, after they have gambled on the Quidditch World Cup. After the World Cup final, some goblins corner him in the woods outside the stadium and <b>take</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> gold he had on him, which {{is not enough to}} cover his debts. To clear his debts with the goblins, Bagman makes a bet on the Triwizard Tournament, of which {{he is one of the}} judges. He bets the goblins that Harry would win. He tries to help Harry over the course of the Tournament, giving him a perfect score in the First Task even though he is injured, and offering him advice. Harry and Cedric Diggory end up tying for first place in the tournament, and Bagman does not win the bet as the goblins argue that Bagman was betting Harry would win outright. Bagman runs away after the Third Task of the Tournament.|$|E
25|$|On his return, Macleod was {{surprised}} and expressed doubt about the results. Banting took this as an attack on his integrity. They argued bitterly, but Banting finally accepted Macleod's instruction that further experiments were needed, and he even convinced Macleod to provide better working conditions and to give him and Best a salary. Further experiments were successful and the three started to present their work at meetings. Macleod was a far better orator, and Banting {{came to believe that}} he wanted to <b>take</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> credit. Their discovery was first published in the February 1922 issue of The Journal of Laboratory and Clinical Medicine. Macleod declined co-authorship because he considered it Banting's and Best's work. Despite their success, there remained the issue of how to get enough pancreas extract to continue the experiments. Together, the three researchers developed alcohol extraction, which proved to be far more efficient than other methods. This convinced Macleod to divert the whole laboratory to insulin research and to bring in the biochemist James Collip to help with purifying the extract.|$|E
25|$|In all, some 650–800 Germans died, {{and some}} 550 of the around 1,400 wet and cold {{survivors}} of Blücher were captured, by soldiers from Company no. 4 of the Norwegian Royal Guards {{under the command}} of Kaptein (Captain) A. J. T. Petersson. In total, some 1,200 of the survivors had made it ashore at Frogn near Drøbak and the guardsmen were supposed to <b>take</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> Germans prisoner, but mainly focused on tending for the many wounded and dying. Around 1,000 of the Germans, including Generalmajor Erwin Engelbrecht and Admiral Oskar Kummetz, were eventually moved to a nearby farm and placed under light guard. None of the prisoners were interrogated. By 18:30, the Norwegian soldiers withdrew from the area, abandoning the Germans. Generalmajor Engelbrecht and Admiral Kummetz then made their way to Oslo. The German leading officers reached Oslo at 22:00, moving into the Hotel Continental, though without the most of the troops intended to occupy the Norwegian capital. Many of the German wounded were initially taken to Åsgården summer hotel in Åsgårdstrand for medical care, where Norwegian wounded had already been brought. The hotel was the temporary improvised location for the Royal Norwegian Navy Hospital, which had been evacuated from Horten at midnight on 8 April.|$|E
