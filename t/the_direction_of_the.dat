5|$|One torque {{generated}} by a tire, called the self aligning torque, is caused by asymmetries in the side-slip {{along the length of}} the contact patch. The resultant force of this side-slip occurs behind the geometric center of the contact patch, a distance described as the pneumatic trail, and so creates a torque on the tire. Since <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> side-slip is towards the outside of the turn, the force on the tire is towards the center of the turn. Therefore, this torque tends to turn the front wheel in <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> side-slip, away from <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> turn, and therefore tends to increase the radius of the turn.|$|E
5|$|The {{single tooth}} of Trapalcotherium is {{identified}} as a lower molar because it has two longitudinal rows of cusps; as a first molar because it is longer than wide; and as a left tooth because the left side (interpreted as labial, in <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lips) bears more cusps than the right side (lingual, <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tongue). The tooth is 2.48mm long and 2.07mm wide. Part of the back labial corner is missing.|$|E

5|$|An {{endpoint}} of a pipe is addressable with a tuple (device_address, endpoint_number) as {{specified in}} a TOKEN packet that the host sends when {{it wants to}} start a data transfer session. If <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> data transfer is from the host to the endpoint, an OUT packet (a specialization of a TOKEN packet) having the desired device address and endpoint number is sent by the host. If <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> data transfer is from the device to the host, the host sends an IN packet instead. If the destination endpoint is a uni-directional endpoint whose manufacturer's designated direction does not match the TOKEN packet (e.g. the manufacturer's designated direction is IN while the TOKEN packet is an OUT packet), the TOKEN packet is ignored. Otherwise, it is accepted and the data transaction can start. A bi-directional endpoint, on the other hand, accepts both IN and OUT packets.|$|E
