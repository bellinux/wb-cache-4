5|$|From {{the end of}} World War II to {{his death}} in April 1985, Enver Hoxha pursued a style of {{politics}} informed by hardline Stalinism as well as elements of Maoism. He broke with the Soviet Union after Nikita Khrushchev embarked on his reformist Khrushchev Thaw, withdrew Albania from <b>the</b> <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact</b> in 1968 in protest of <b>the</b> <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact</b> invasion of Czechoslovakia, and broke with the People's Republic of China after U.S. President Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China.|$|E
5|$|During the Cold War, <b>the</b> <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact</b> {{countries}} {{launched a}} widespread {{war against the}} potato beetle, blaming {{the introduction of the}} species from America on the CIA, demonising the species in propaganda posters, and urging children to gather the beetles and kill them.|$|E
5|$|While Stalin's {{death in}} 1953 {{slightly}} relaxed tensions, {{the situation in}} Europe remained an uneasy armed truce. The Soviets, who had already created a network of mutual assistance treaties in the Eastern Bloc by 1949, established a formal alliance therein, <b>the</b> <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact,</b> in 1955.|$|E

50|$|The {{decision}} {{was prompted by}} the continuing military build-up of <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact</b> countries, particularly <b>the</b> <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact's</b> growing capability in nuclear systems threatening Western Europe. Of special concern was the growth of long-range theatre nuclear forces, with the SS-20 missile and the 'Backfire' bomber singled out for particular concern.|$|R
50|$|In 1950 Geremek {{joined the}} Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR). He {{was the second}} {{secretary}} of the Basic Party Organisation (POP) of <b>the</b> PZPR at <b>Warsaw</b> University. In 1968, however, he withdrew from the party in protest against <b>the</b> <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact's</b> invasion of Czechoslovakia.|$|R
5|$|After the war, the Command {{continued}} Anti-Submarine Warfare duties {{during the}} Cold War, {{to combat the}} threat posed by the Soviet Navy and other fleets of <b>the</b> <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact.</b> It ceased to exist in 1969 when it was subsumed into the newly formed Strike Command, which had also absorbed the former Bomber, Fighter and Signals Commands and later also absorbed Air Support Command, the former Transport Command.|$|E
5|$|As a {{delegate}} to the U.N. General Assembly in 1968, Cooper strongly denounced <b>the</b> <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact</b> invasion of Czechoslovakia. He also supported Montana Senator Mike Mansfield's proposal to bring {{the matter of the}} Vietnam War before the United Nations. Returning to the Senate in 1969, he joined Alaska Senator Ernest Gruening and Oregon Senator Wayne Morse in protesting restrictions on orderly protests at the United States Capitol.|$|E
5|$|During the Cold War <b>the</b> <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact</b> countries, {{fearing a}} food shortage, decried the beetle as a CIA plot {{to destroy the}} {{agriculture}} of the Soviet Union. Officials launched a Warsaw Pact-wide campaign {{to wipe out the}} beetle, villainizing them in propaganda posters and pulling schoolchildren from class to gather the bugs and drown them in buckets of benzene or spirit.|$|E
50|$|In the People's Republic of Poland, on 8 September 1968, Ryszard Siwiec immolated {{himself in}} Warsaw during a harvest festival at the 10th-Anniversary Stadium in protest against <b>the</b> <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact's</b> {{invasion}} of Czechoslovakia and the totalitarianism of the Stalinist government. Siwiec did not survive.|$|R
5000|$|When the Reagan {{administration}} {{signed a}} {{treaty with the}} Soviet Union requiring each side to withdraw intermediate-range missiles from Europe, General Rogers called the agreement [...] "foolish."

5|$|Battlefield Germany is a turn-based {{strategy}} {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Personal Software Services for the Commodore 64 released in April 1987. It was also ported to the Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum later that year. It is the eighth instalment to the Strategic Wargames series. The game is set during a fictional scenario in which the powers of NATO and <b>the</b> <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact</b> engage in a conventional war throughout Europe, mostly centring in West and East Germany.|$|E
5|$|The Hungarian Revolution of 1956 {{occurred}} {{shortly after}} Khrushchev arranged {{the removal of}} Hungary's Stalinist leader Mátyás Rákosi. In response to a popular uprising, the new regime formally disbanded the secret police, declared its intention to withdraw from <b>the</b> <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact</b> and pledged to re-establish free elections. The Soviet Army invaded. Thousands of Hungarians were arrested, imprisoned and deported to the Soviet Union, and approximately 200,000 Hungarians fled Hungary in the chaos. Hungarian leader Imre Nagy and others were executed following secret trials.|$|E
5|$|The {{communist}} Polish United Workers' Party dissolved {{itself in}} 1990 and {{transformed into the}} Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland. <b>The</b> <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact</b> was formally dissolved on 1 July 1991; the Soviet Union ceased to exist in December 1991 and the last post-Soviet troops left Poland in September 1993. On 27 October 1991, the first entirely free Polish parliamentary elections since the 1920s took place. This completed Poland's transition from a communist party rule to a Western-style liberal democratic political system.|$|E

50|$|TRADOC {{concluded}} {{that there were two}} main possibilities for future conflicts, a major armored conflict in Europe, or a primarily infantry fight in other locations around the world. The latter possibility led to the ill-fated Rapid Reaction Force. The former was more problematic given <b>the</b> <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact's</b> massive numerical superiority, especially given the ending of Selective Service.|$|R
5|$|The first IMO {{was held}} in Romania in 1959. Since then it has been held every year except in 1980. That year, it was {{cancelled}} due to internal strife in Mongolia. It was initially founded for eastern European member countries of <b>the</b> <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact,</b> under the Soviet bloc of influence, but later other countries participated as well. Because of this eastern origin, the IMOs were first hosted only in eastern European countries, and gradually spread to other nations.|$|E
5|$|The {{game is a}} turn-based {{strategy}} and revolves around a fictional conflict between the powers of NATO and <b>the</b> <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact.</b> The player has the choice of choosing to control either NATO or Warsaw Pact forces {{at the beginning of}} the game. The player will begin the game on either side of Europe depending on which side was chosen; if NATO was picked, the player will start at western European countries (France, West Germany, Denmark) whereas if the player sides with <b>the</b> <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact,</b> the game will begin in eastern Europe. The map is hexagon-shaped and allows the player to move their units in six directions. Each side has a variety of units; infantry move at a slower pace than mechanised infantry however armoured units are able to withstand more damage than regular units. The game displays two maps on screen; the larger, central map displays the current situation whereas a smaller map to the corner of the screen displays a mini-map of Europe, which runs north from Denmark to southern France.|$|E
5|$|According {{to friends}} and family, he had {{extensive}} historical knowledge and was deeply disillusioned {{with the reality of}} communist Poland. He supported the protesting students during the March 1968 Polish political crisis in Poland, printing bibuła leaflets and asking his daughter to distribute them. According to health professionals, he was of sound mind, and fully rational, {{at the time of his}} suicide. Siwiec planned his self-immolation months in advance, writing out a last will in April, and leaving written and tape-recorded statements explaining his revulsion at both <b>the</b> <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact</b> invasion of Czechoslovakia and the People's Republic of Poland's participation in it.|$|E

25|$|Unlike <b>the</b> other <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact</b> countries, Poland did {{not endorse}} the Soviet armed {{intervention}} in Hungary. The Hungarian Uprising was intensely {{supported by the}} Polish public.|$|R
5|$|Brezhnev {{approved}} the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan (see also Soviet–Afghan relations) {{just as he}} had previously approved <b>the</b> <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact</b> invasion of Czechoslovakia. In both cases, Brezhnev was not the one pushing hardest for a possible armed intervention. Several leading members of the Soviet leadership decided to retain Brezhnev as General Secretary so that their careers would not suffer by a possible leadership reshuffling by his successor. Other members, who disliked Brezhnev, among them Dmitriy Ustinov (Minister of Defence), Andrei Gromyko (Minister of Foreign Affairs), and Mikhail Suslov (Central Committee Secretary), feared that Brezhnev's removal would spark a succession crisis, and so they helped to maintain the status quo.|$|E
5|$|Cheney {{publicly}} {{expressed concern}} that nations such as Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, could acquire nuclear components {{after the collapse of}} the Soviet Union in 1991. The end of the Cold War, the fall of the Soviet Union, and the disintegration of <b>the</b> <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact</b> obliged the first Bush Administration to reevaluate the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO's) purpose and makeup. Cheney believed that NATO should remain the foundation of European security relationships and that it would remain important to the United States in the long term; he urged the alliance to lend more assistance to the new democracies in Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Early during Kosygin's tenure, the Brezhnev–Kosygin {{attempt to}} create {{stability}} was failing on various fronts. From 1969 to 1970 discontent within the Soviet leadership had grown {{to such an extent}} that some started to doubt both former and current Soviet policies. Examples include the handling of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia (which Kosygin initially resisted), the decline in agriculture production, the Sino–Soviet border conflict (he advocated restraint), the Vietnam War, and the Soviet–American talks on the limitation of strategic missiles. Two summit conferences between the US and the USSR were held: <b>the</b> <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact</b> Summit Conference and the Moscow Summit Conference; both failed to gain support for Soviet policies.|$|E
40|$|For NATO's {{first four}} decades the {{overwhelming}} {{threat to its}} members' security arose from the enormous military strength of the Soviet Union … the allies were unable to match the numerical levels of <b>the</b> <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact's</b> conventional armaments and manpower. This … underlined the key role of nuclear weapons in deterrence, ensuring {{that the cost of}} aggression was plainly too high for any attacker to contemplate...|$|R
50|$|That same year, after <b>the</b> <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact's</b> {{squelching}} of <b>the</b> Prague Spring, he, {{his wife}} Olga, {{and their daughter}} Ruth left Prague for exile, first in Vienna, and later, from 1969, in the USA. The overwhelmingly positive response in Europe to the German edition of his critical work on Nestroy was the effectual cause of his being offered a professorship at Pennsylvania State University.|$|R

5|$|The {{events leading}} up the {{stand-off}} between NATO and <b>the</b> <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact</b> are detailed in a pre-game text; Iran declares war on Iraq and subsequently invades the latter nation, whilst Egypt succumbs to a civil war and establishes Islamic law over the country, culminating in an Egyptian invasion of Israel. The events in the Middle East prompt the superpowers of the United States and the British Empire to intervene, leading up to a conventional war in Europe against the Eastern bloc. The game is set in 1989.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} the International Mathematical Olympiads (IMOs) was held in Romania in 1959. The oldest of the International Science Olympiads, the IMO has since been held annually, except in 1980. That year the {{competition}} initially planned to hold in Mongolia was canceled due to soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Because the competition was initially founded for Eastern European countries participating in <b>the</b> <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact,</b> {{under the influence of}} the Eastern Bloc, the earlier IMOs were hosted only in Eastern European countries, gradually spreading to other nations. Sources differ about the cities hosting some of the early IMOs and the exact dates when they took place.|$|E
5|$|During the Harrier's {{service the}} RAF {{positioned}} {{the bulk of}} the aircraft in West Germany to defend against a potential invasion of Western Europe by <b>the</b> <b>Warsaw</b> <b>Pact</b> forces; the unique abilities of the Harrier allowed the RAF to disperse their forces away from vulnerable airbases. The USMC used their Harriers primarily for close air support, operating from amphibious assault ships, and, if needed, forward operating bases. Harrier squadrons saw several deployments overseas. The Harrier's ability to operate with minimal ground facilities and very short runways allowed it to be used at locations unavailable to other fixed-wing aircraft. The Harrier received criticism for having a high accident rate and for a time-consuming maintenance process.|$|E
