5|$|As of 2013, Schafer {{is still}} {{interested}} in a sequel to Brütal Legend, but would require appropriate funding and resources {{to make it happen}} as an independent developer. Since then, Double Fine launched a successful crowd-funded drive for Psychonauts 2 in December 2015; Schafer said that if that game does well, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> chance that a sequel to Brütal Legend would be possible. Brutal Legend will eventually get a sequel, Tim Schafer of developer Double Fine said June 13 during an appearance at E3 2017.|$|E
5|$|In Paris, Maria and Eugene Jolas nursed Joyce {{during his}} {{long years of}} writing Finnegans Wake. Were it not for their support (along with Harriet Shaw Weaver's {{constant}} financial support), <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> possibility that his books might never have been finished or published. In their literary magazine transition, the Jolases published serially various sections of Finnegans Wake under the title Work in Progress. Joyce returned to Zurich in late 1940, fleeing the Nazi occupation of France.|$|E
5|$|Common {{starlings}} {{will take}} over Eurasian nuthatch nest holes, reducing their breeding success. This {{is most likely to}} occur if the nest is high in a tree and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> local breeding density of the nuthatch. Introduced ring-necked parakeets may also compete with Eurasian nuthatches for nesting holes. The parakeets tend to occur in fragmented urban woodlands, while nuthatches prefer large old oak woodlands, which reduces the level of competition. Ornithologists conducting a 2010 Belgian study suggested that the problem was not so severe as to warrant culling of the parakeets.|$|E

5|$|In {{common with}} most suburbs of the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead, its economy is {{dominated}} by the economies of Newcastle–upon–Tyne and Gateshead town centre. This is reflected in terms of independent commercial space; retail floor space in the suburb totals 1% of that available in the whole metropolitan borough. There are 33 retail units concentrated on Old Durham Road, which provide some employment, though these are {{at the lower end of}} the spectrum and provide little choice. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> provision of hardware stores, fast–food outlets and hairdressers, a butcher's shop, a greengrocer and a supermarket, but there is no bakery, bank nor building society and the Post Office has closed. The retail units were domestic properties, so many are too small for retail purposes and around 20% are vacant.|$|E
5|$|While there, Nico {{settles into}} camp life; Percy and Blackjack save a sea monster Percy nicknames Bessie; and Artemis's {{lieutenant}} Zoë Nightshade has mysterious dreams about the goddess being in grave danger. Percy has similar dreams about Annabeth saving Luke from being {{crushed by the}} ceiling of some cave and holding it up for him. Both are unable to act, however, until the Oracle (a shriveled mummy) somehow leaves the attic where it was kept and delivers the Huntress a prophecy. Chiron and Zoë organize a quest, but Percy is forbidden from going because the Hunters refuse to travel with a boy. He successfully sneaks away from camp on Blackjack, though he is almost stopped by Mr. D (Dionysus) who agrees {{to let him go}} because <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> chance that Percy will get killed while on the quest.|$|E
