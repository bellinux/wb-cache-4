It is the only species of loon able to take off directly from land. If frightened, it may submerge until only its head or bill shows above {{the surface of the}} water.|$|E

The term is also used by planners to identify the incremental rail improvements to increase train speeds and reduce travel time as alternatives <b>to</b> <b>larger</b> efforts to create or expand the high-speed rail networks.

Female adults attach <b>to</b> <b>larger</b> hosts, feed, and lay eggs, while males feed very little and occupy larger hosts primarily for mating.|$|E
