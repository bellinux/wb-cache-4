25|$|BPH can {{be treated}} with medication, a {{minimally}} invasive procedure or, in extreme cases, surgery that removes the prostate. Minimally invasive procedures include <b>transurethral</b> needle ablation of the prostate (TUNA) and <b>transurethral</b> microwave thermotherapy (TUMT). These outpatient procedures may be followed by the insertion of a temporary prostatic stent, to allow normal voluntary urination, without exacerbating irritative symptoms.|$|E

25|$|The surgery {{most often}} used in such cases is called <b>transurethral</b> {{resection}} of the prostate (TURP or TUR). In TURP, an instrument is inserted through the urethra to remove prostate tissue that is pressing against {{the upper part of}} the urethra and restricting the flow of urine. TURP results in the removal of mostly transitional zone tissue in a patient with BPH. Older men often have corpora amylacea (amyloid), dense accumulations of calcified proteinaceous material, in the ducts of their prostates. The corpora amylacea may obstruct the lumens of the prostatic ducts, and may underlie some cases of BPH.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{prostate}} was first described by Venetian anatomist Niccolò Massa in 1536, {{and illustrated by}} Flemish anatomist Andreas Vesalius in 1538, prostate cancer was not identified until 1853. Prostate cancer was initially considered a rare disease, probably because of shorter life expectancies and poorer detection methods in the 19th century. The first treatments of prostate cancer were surgeries to relieve urinary obstruction. Removal of the entire gland (radical perineal prostatectomy) was first performed in 1904 by Hugh H. Young at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Surgical removal of the testes (orchiectomy) to treat prostate cancer was first performed in the 1890s, but with limited success. <b>Transurethral</b> resection of {{the prostate}} (TURP) replaced radical prostatectomy for symptomatic relief of obstruction {{in the middle of}} the 20th century because it could better preserve penile erectile function. Radical retropubic prostatectomy was developed in 1983 by Patrick Walsh. This surgical approach allowed for removal of the prostate and lymph nodes with maintenance of penile function.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Transurethral</b> {{resection}} of the prostate, {{commonly called}} a [...] "TURP," [...] is a surgical procedure performed when the tube from the bladder to the penis (urethra) is blocked by prostate enlargement. In general, TURP is for benign disease {{and is not}} meant as definitive treatment for prostate cancer. During a TURP, a small instrument (cystoscope) is placed into the penis and the blocking prostate is cut away.|$|E

50|$|<b>Transurethral</b> {{microwave}} thermotherapy (TUMT) {{is one of}} {{a number}} of effective and safe procedures used in the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). TUMT provides a one-time efficacious treatment of LUTS due to BPH. It is an alternative treatment to pharmacotherapy such as Alpha blockers, <b>transurethral</b> resection of the prostate (TURP), <b>transurethral</b> needle ablation of the prostate (TUNA), photoselective vaporization of the prostate (PVP) and prostatic removal or prostatectomy.|$|E
50|$|A prostatic stent is a stent {{used to keep}} {{open the}} male urethra and allow the passing of urine in cases of prostatic {{obstruction}} and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Prostatic obstruction is a common condition {{with a variety of}} causes. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is the most common cause, but obstruction may also occur acutely after treatment for BPH such as <b>transurethral</b> needle ablation of the prostate (TUNA), <b>transurethral</b> resection of the prostate (TURP), <b>transurethral</b> microwave thermotherapy (TUMT), prostate cancer or after radiation therapy.|$|E
