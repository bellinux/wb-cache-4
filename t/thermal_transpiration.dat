5000|$|The Knudsen pump also {{referred}} to as [...] "thermal transpiration pump" [...] or [...] "Knudsen compressor" [...] is a gas pump that utilizes no moving parts. Instead it uses <b>thermal</b> <b>transpiration,</b> the phenomenon that gas molecules drift from the cold end to the hot end of a narrow channel. This <b>thermal</b> <b>transpiration</b> flow is induced when the boundary walls of the pump have a temperature gradient. Because the pump is based simply on temperature differences and has no moving parts, it could provide reliable and precise control of gas flow for a variety of applications, such as gas-sensing breath analyzers, chemical weapons detectors, and in satellite control.It is named after Martin Knudsen, a Danish physicist.|$|E
50|$|The final {{piece of}} the puzzle, <b>thermal</b> <b>transpiration,</b> was theorized by Osborne Reynolds in an {{unpublished}} paper that was refereed by Maxwell, who then published his own paper which contained {{a critique of the}} mathematics in Reynolds's unpublished paper. Maxwell died that year and the Royal Society refused to publish Reynolds's critique of Maxwell's rebuttal to Reynolds's unpublished paper, as it was felt that this would be an inappropriate argument when one of the people involved had already died. Reynolds found that if a porous plate is kept hotter on one side than the other, the interactions between gas molecules and the plates are such that gas will flow through from the cooler to the hotter side. The vanes of a typical Crookes radiometer are not porous, but the space past their edges behaves like the pores in Reynolds's plate. On average, the gas molecules move from the cold side toward the hot side whenever the pressure ratio is less than the square root of the (absolute) temperature ratio. The pressure difference causes the vane to move, cold (white) side forward due to the tangential force of the movement of the rarefied gas moving from the colder edge to the hotter edge.|$|E

40|$|The ‘Next Generation Greenhouse Cultivation’ aims {{at a lower}} {{night time}} crop {{transpiration}} {{in order to reduce}} the energy consumption. This transpiration however needs to stay sufficient for the transport of nutrients to the head of the crop. In this project, it was investigated whether the local transpiration of the head of the crop can be determined from the image of a <b>thermal</b> camera. <b>Transpiration</b> lowers the leaf surface temperature and by determining the temperature difference between transpiring and non-transpiring leaves a measure can be found for local transpiration. This appeared to be possible, but only when the camera image shows both the temperature of the leaves to be studied and the temperature of a nearby non-transpiring reference surface. This requires a good camera system as it was not always easy to select the correct pixels in the images. In order to compare the measured temperature differences with what a normal transpiring leaf can be expected to show, intensive use of the Radiation Monitor has been made. This recently published model gave that interesting results that the detailed information about crop transpiration has now been added as standard output.

40|$|A {{reliable}} micro {{gas pump}} {{is an essential}} element {{to the development of}} many micro-systems for chemical gas analyses. At Sandia, the authors are exploring a different pumping mechanism, gas transport by <b>thermal</b> <b>transpiration.</b> <b>Thermal</b> <b>transpiration</b> refers to the rarefied gas dynamics developed in a micro-channel with a longitudinal temperature gradient. To investigate the potential of <b>thermal</b> <b>transpiration</b> for gas pumping in micro-systems, the authors have performed simulations and model analysis to design micro-devices and to assess their design performance before the fabrication process. The effort is to apply ICARUS (a Direct Simulation Monte Carlo code developed at Sandia) to characterize the fluid transport and evaluate the design performance. The design being considered has two plenums at different temperatures (hot and cold) separated by a micro-channel of 0. 1 micron wide and 1 micron long. The temperature difference between the two plenums is 30 kelvin. ICARUS results, a quasi-steady analysis, predicts a net flow through the micro-channel with a velocity magnitude of about 0. 4 m/s due to temperature gradient at the wall (thermal creep flow) at the early time. Later as the pressure builds up in the hot plenum, flow is reversed. Eventually when the system reaches steady state equilibrium, the net flow becomes zero. The thermal creep effect is compensated by the thermo-molecular pressure effect. This result demonstrates {{that it is important to}} include the thermo-molecular pressure effect when designing a pumping mechanism based on <b>thermal</b> <b>transpiration.</b> The DSMC technique can model this complex <b>thermal</b> <b>transpiration</b> problem...|$|E
40|$|<b>Thermal</b> <b>transpiration</b> {{has been}} studied {{experimentally}} using the absolute and differential methods. The results for <b>thermal</b> <b>transpiration</b> of helium in Pyrex tubes, measured using the absolute method, show deviation from the predicted minimum value of the <b>thermal</b> <b>transpiration</b> ratio, Rm, even at low pressures. This concurs {{with the findings of}} other investigators. The deviation is dependent on the submergence depth of the tubes in coolant, with increased deviation for greater submergence. The probable cause of the deviation {{has been shown to be}} the specular reflection of molecules at the relatively smooth Pyrex surfaces, because when the surfaces were roughened to inhibit specular reflection, the deviation disappeared. A mathematical model has been developed to show that variation in deviation with change in submergence depth is a natural consequence of the specular reflection of molecules. <b>Thermal</b> <b>transpiration</b> of helium and nitrogen across arrays of parallel capillaries has been measured in the pressure range 1 - 100 mbar using the differential method, using two different experimental systems. The results from the first system are in general accord with expectations; more <b>thermal</b> <b>transpiration</b> occurring for helium than nitrogen at any given pressure and more <b>thermal</b> <b>transpiration</b> occurring at lower pressures. The magnitude of the effect was, however, less than expected. With the second, improved, experimental system, the magnitude of the effect for helium at 1 mbar was close to that predicted by the kinetic theory. Comparison of the helium data with data calculated using the semi-empirical formula of Takaishi and Sensui gives a good match at all but the lowest pressures. There is almost no match with data from Liang's semi-empirical formula. For nitrogen, there is good agreement with the two formulae for pressures above 10 mbar, but considerable divergence below this. Manual and computer curve fitting has been done to obtain new coefficients for Takaishi and Sensui's formula.

40|$|An {{isothermal}} {{boundary layer}} analysis is presented for the convection flow of a second-order non-Newtonian fluid past a two-dimensional wedge {{embedded in a}} non-Darcian porous medium {{in the presence of}} significant <b>thermal</b> radiation, surface <b>transpiration</b> and Eckert viscous heating. Nonsimilar numerical solutions are generated for the shear stresses and local heat transfer rates at the surface of the wedge using the Keller difference technique extended to a higher matrix or-der. It is found that the heat transfer magnitude is enhanced by an increase in the radiative flux parameter (Boltzmann – Rosseland number, Bo), but depressed considerably with an increase in the viscoelasticity of the second-order fluid para-meter, K. The surface shear stresses are markedly decreased with rise in the vis-coelasticity parameter K. Conversely, surface lateral mass flux (transpiration) is seen to lower the shear stresses at the surface and to greatly boost the heat transfer there.

40|$|In {{order to}} employ {{continuum}} {{models in the}} analysis of the flow behaviour of a viscous Newtonian fluid in micro scale devices, it is necessary to consider at the wall surfaces appropriate slip boundary conditions instead of the classical non-slip condition. The slip behaviour in the case of micro fluid flow of rarefied gases is associated with the combined effect of reduction in momentum transfer due to the {{reduction in the number of}} molecules (shear creep) and the <b>thermal</b> creep or <b>transpiration,</b> which as a consequence of inequalities in temperatures, forces the fluid to slide over a surface from colder to hotter regions. In this work a boundary integral equation formulation for Stokes slip flow, based on the normal and tangential projection of the Green’s integral representational formulae for the Stokes velocity field, which directly incorporates into the integral equations the local tangential shear rate and heat flux at the wall surfaces, is presented. The tangential heat flux is evaluated in terms of the tangential gradient of the temperature integral representational formulae presenting singularity of the Cauchy type, which are removed by the use of an auxiliary field. These formulations are used to simulate a Single rotor mixer and analyze the combined effect of both shear and thermal creep effects over mixer performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of achieving laminar flow {{has been demonstrated}} numerous times both in the laboratory and by flight tests but {{for it to be}} considered as a viable method for production aircraft, robust and mature systems and structural concepts need to be developed and demonstrated. To achieve laminar flow on a large aircraft with swept wings such as a commercial or military transport, through skin suction will be required in the leading edge region (Hybrid Laminar Flow Control). Ice protection will be required to ensure a clean wing after climb to cruise flight level and to guarantee flight safety under icing conditions. At low flight levels between ground and 5000 ft within the thermal convection zone methods to control roughness due to impacted of insect debris and dirt will be necessary. These systems will have to be contained mainly within the leading edge and must be compatible with appropriate leading edge high lift devices. The primary object of this flight experiment was to gain experience with integrating and operating typical systems necessary for a laminar flow airfoil, to evaluate their performance and to observe their interactions. The entire leading edge, outboard of the engine, of the right wing of a Do 228 test vehicle was replaced. The test leading edge included regions to evaluate two combinations of systems together with control zones. One region combined suction with <b>transpiration</b> <b>thermal</b> anti-icing and a Kruger high lift device configured as a shield against insect contamination. The second test region combined suction with foamed liquid for ice protection and insect contamination control. Neither <b>transpiration</b> <b>thermal</b> anti-icing nor liquid foam has been flight tested for this application in Europe. The foam-protected region was divided into two sections. During icing tests the entire span of this region could be operated to ensure that the airflow over the aileron was not disrupted but for insect contamination tests the outer section could be turned off to act as a reference region. In order to determine the effectiveness of the suction and contamination control systems the test required that the boundary layer would be naturally turbulent and only laminarised by suction if the systems operated efficiently and correctly. That part of the span in the propeller slipstream did not form part of the test and was provided with a simple liquid ice protection system for safety and opertional reasons. In order to allow the detection of laminar flow the test aircraft was equipped with an infrared system which measures the small surface temperature difference between laminar and turbulent flow. The pressure distribution is measured by means of a row of pressure taps between the outer two test panels. The flight tests have been conducted in four test campaigns starting in December 2001 and being completed in September 2002. In January and February 2002 the certification flights could be finished with a preliminary certification for further test systems investigation. In a second step the effectiveness of the suction system has been tested. These tests showed that depending on flap deflection and suction velocity transition locations between 25 % and 50 % of chord length could be achieved. Without suction no laminar flow could be observed. In three test campaigns between March and September 2002 the effectiveness of the anti-icing and anti-contamination systems have been investigated. The anti-icing tests have been performed {{in the wake of the}} icing aircraft Do 228 of the Fairchild-Dornier company. This aircraft is equipped with a water spray nozzle system and can load 1 cubic metre of water enabling a spraying time between 30 minutes and one hour. Three hours of anti-icing tests with different liquid water contents (LWC) from 0, 3 up to 1. 7 g/cubic metre clearly showed that the bleed air anti-icing system on the suction surface had not only a faster response due to the better heat transfer by blowing through the porous surface but also a faster de-icing effect due to the overpressure being effective against the ice sheet. The effectiveness of the fluid/foam de-icing system depends strongly on the capability of the foaming device. After modification of the foaming device the fluid/foam system shows a reliable de-icing capability. It's effectiveness was close to that of the standard de-icing system of AS&T. The anti-contamination tests in June and August 2002 have been as successful as expected. On the fluid/foam protected test panel only 10 % of the insects sticking on the unprotected surface could be counted on the surface with fluid protection. The shield protection of the Kruger has an effectiveness of 100 %. No insects could be counted on the protected surface for all test flights. Summarizing it could be stated that all three systems tested be these flight tests worked as effective as expected or even better. They allow to protect an HLFC wing reliably against icing and contamination...|$|R

The Knudsen Compressor is a {{solid-state}} micro/meso-scale gas {{roughing pump}} {{based on the}} rarefied gas phenomena of <b>thermal</b> <b>transpiration.</b> Knudsen Compressors operate by imposing a temperature gradient across a high porosity, low thermal conductivity transpiration membrane, typically a silicon aerogel membrane.

40|$|Knudsen {{compressors}} are devices {{without any}} moving parts {{that use the}} nanoscale phenomenon of <b>thermal</b> <b>transpiration</b> to pump or compress a gas. <b>Thermal</b> <b>transpiration</b> takes place when a gas is in contact with a solid boundary along which a temperature gradient exists. If the characteristic length scale is on the order of, or smaller than, the molecular mean free path, then the gas flows from cold to hot regions. The nanoscale nature of this phenomenon lends itself to use in nanoscale devices where moving parts are difficult to manufacture. Additional applications include low pressure environments, such as space or vacuum, where molecular mean-free paths are long. Although the flow rates obtained from individual Knudsen compressors are small, reasonable flow rates and significant pressure rises can be attained by cascading {{a large number of}} single stages. In this thesis, we use kinetic-theory based simulations to study <b>thermal</b> <b>transpiration</b> and its application to Knudsen compressors. We simulate such flows in a variety of porous media configurations and then study the effect of various device parameters and operating conditions on the compressor performance. It is generally observed that generally Knudsen compressors are more efficient when producing a flow than when creating a pressure rise. Small Knudsen numbers and short device lengths tend to increase the mass flow rate, but decrease pressure rise. Particular attention in our investigation is paid to the compressor efficiency, where a number of efficiency measures are defined, discussed, and compared to previous work in the literature, where available. It is generally found that the Knudsen compressor requires large temperature differences to be competitive as an energy conversion device. by Toby A. Klein. Thesis (S. M.)

Prior to saturation-pressure measurements, the temperature and pressure sensors of the static apparatus were calibrated against reference gauges in use at the LNE-CETIAT laboratories. The effect of <b>thermal</b> <b>transpiration</b> has been studied. The explored temperature range lies between 250 K and 374 K, and the pressure range between 70 Pa and 10 (5) Pa. An automatic data acquisition program was developed to monitor the pressure and temperature. The obtained results have been compared with available literature data. The preliminary uncertainty budget took into account several components: pressure measurements, temperature measurements, and environmental error sources such as <b>thermal</b> <b>transpiration</b> and hydrostatic correction...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the evaluation of}} four types of porous ceramics for use as <b>thermal</b> <b>transpiration</b> materials in Knudsen pumps that operate at atmospheric pressure. Knudsen pumps are motionless gas pumps that utilize <b>thermal</b> <b>transpiration</b> along a channel or a set of channels; the channels must have a temperature gradient and must constrain the flow to remain within the free molecular or transitional flow regimes. Of the ceramics evaluated, a clay-based, 15 bar synthetic ceramic (15 PC) presents the most favorable properties for Knudsen pumps. For an input power of 3. 4 W, a 25 _ 25 mm 2 nine-stage Knudsen pump that uses this material provides a maximum pressure head of 12 kPa and a maximum gas flow rate of ≈ 3. 7 µL min _ 1. Reliability tests demonstrate more than 11 750 h of continuous operation without any deterioration in their gas pumping capabilities. A fitted model suggests that the temporal evolution of pressure at the sealed outlet of a Knudsen pump can be captured adequately using four parameters. These parameters correspond to various nonidealities that play dominant roles in the transient response of these pumps...|$|E

In present work, a gas-phonon interaction modeling approach is suggested based on Boltzmann transport equations. Verification has been conducted by comparisons with asymptotic analytical solutions as well as previously reported numerical results and experimental data. <b>Thermal</b> <b>transpiration</b> in nano-sized channels and thermal resistance of nano-sized constrictions has been studied using the current model <b>Thermal</b> <b>transpiration</b> is the main mechanism for temperature driven pumps in nano/micro-devices. In order to maintain higher temperature ratio between the two ends of the gas path (capillaries), the choice of membrane material is very important, and the gas-solid interaction must be understood. It is shown from the calculations that the temperature gradient, capillary geometry, gas/solid Knudsen conditions, and the gas/solid thermal conductivity ratio are all responsible for the over-all compression efficiency. Heat transfer across mesoscopic constrictions poses a similar gasphonon coupling problem. Simulation shows that the analytical solution applies to limiting cases where the gas gap can be taken as a thin-fihn insulator. However, the heat flux through the gas thermal path may become a significant contributor for smaller gas phase Knudsen conditions...|$|E

The Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC), a popular molecular based simulation technique for rarefied gas, {{has proven to}} be inefficient in dealing with low-speed gas flows. In this paper, we present the Octant Flux Splitting Information Preserving DSMC (OSIP-DSMC) method as an efficient DSMC method for micro/nano gas flows, particularly those driven by thermal loading. The efficiency of the proposed method has been demonstrated through several examples including <b>thermal</b> <b>transpiration...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{model of}} {{rarefied}} gas flow in tubes was developed which combines a lobular distribution with diffuse reflection at the wall. The model with Monte Carlo techniques was used to explain previously observed deviations in the free molecular <b>thermal</b> <b>transpiration</b> ratio which suggest molecules can have a greater tube transmission probability in a hot-to-cold direction than in a cold-to-hot direction. The model yields correct magnitudes of transmission probability ratios for helium in Pyrex tubing (1. 09 to 1. 14), and some effects of wall-temperature distribution, tube surface roughness, tube dimensions, gas temperature, and gas molecular mass.
