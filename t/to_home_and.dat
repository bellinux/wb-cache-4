Despite losing Delle Donne the Huskies were ranked #1 in the preseason polls, having returned 10 players from the 2008 Final Four team (including All-Americans Maya Moore, Renee Montgomery and Tina Charles), in addition to Kalana Greene who recovered from her knee injury.|$|E

5|$|The {{family moved}} from Alford {{to the heart}} of London in 1605 when Anne was 15, where her father was given the {{position}} of vicar of the Church of Saint Martin's in the Vintry. Here his expression of puritan views was tolerated, though somewhat muffled, because of a shortage of pastors. Marbury took on additional work in 1608, preaching in the parish of Saint Pancras, several miles northwest of the city, travelling there by horseback twice a week. In 1610, he replaced that position with one much closer <b>to</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> became rector of Saint Margaret's on New Fish Street, only a short walk from Saint Martin in the Vintry. He was at a high point in his career, but he died suddenly at the age of 55 in February 1611, when Anne was 19 years old.|$|E
5|$|Brimsek {{remained}} with the Bruins {{for three more}} seasons. He {{was named to the}} NHL Second All-Star team twice more and was selected to play in the inaugural NHL All-Star Game in 1947. The Bruins made the playoffs all three seasons but were eliminated in the semi-finals in all of them. Brimsek was also a finalist for the Hart Trophy in 1947–48, finishing behind Buddy O'Connor of the Rangers. Personal problems plagued Brimsek during his final years in Boston. His 10-month-old son had died in January 1949, and his coach and longtime teammate, Dit Clapper, had resigned from his coaching duties. It did not also help that the Boston crowd would occasionally boo Brimsek for his play. After the 1948–49 season, Brimsek requested a trade from Boston to Chicago in order to be closer <b>to</b> <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> to the new blueprint business he had started there. Boston granted his request and he was traded to the Chicago Black Hawks in exchange for cash. Brimsek only played one season with the Black Hawks, recording 22 wins, 38 losses and 10 ties in 70 games played. The team finished last in the standings. Brimsek's lone season with the Hawks was the only season where his team did not reach the playoffs. He retired {{at the conclusion of the}} season.|$|E

Having defeated these, in 968 he marched south and plundered Leinster, killing several notables, and laid siege to Dublin for two months. While Domnall {{did not take the}} port, he carried off a great many cattle. Amlaíb, allied with the king of Leinster Murchad mac Finn, retaliated by attacking the abbey of Kells in 969.

25|$|The {{death of}} her father in January 1852 {{prompted}} her to relocate to Guayaquil where she lived with prominent nobles and {{it was here that}} she began her mission of helping the poor and the sick and caring for abandoned children. It was also here that she {{took a job as a}} seamstress in order to fund her mission as well as supporting her eight brothers and sisters. But she soon moved to Cuenca for some months where she went from home <b>to</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> lived with whoever would take her in including Blessed Mercedes de Jesús Molina to allow herself greater time for silent contemplation and penance. In 1865 her spiritual director fell ill and died in 1868 which was at the time the local bishop invited her to live with the Carmelites even though she had refused the offer.|$|E

25|$|In 1840, upon {{graduation}} from the gymnasium, Pisemsky joined the Faculty of Mathematics at Moscow State University, having overcome resistance {{from his father}} who insisted upon his son enrolling in the Demidov Lyceum, for it was closer <b>to</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> his education {{there would have been}} free. Pisemsky later regarded his choice of faculty as a very fortunate one, even while admitting he drew little practical value out of university lectures. Attending assorted lectures by professors from other faculties, he became acquainted with Shakespeare, Schiller, Goethe, Corneille, Racine, Rousseau, Voltaire, Hugo and George Sand and started to form an educated view on the history of Russian literature. Contemporaries pointed at Pisemsky's two major influences of the time: Belinsky and Gogol. Besides, as Pisemsky's friend Boris Almazov remembered, Pavel Katenin, the follower of French classicism and Russian translator of Racine and Cornel, whom Pisemsky knew through being a neighbour, exerted some influence upon him as well. According to Almazov, Pisemsky had a considerable dramatic talent, and it was Katenin who helped him to develop it.|$|E
25|$|In 2006 One Day Cricket in England {{was given}} a major revamp by the ECB. This led to quite a few changes for day/night cricket in England. For the first time Day/Night matches were played in the than known C Trophy {{although}} as in the Twenty20 Cup matches were limited to the counties who owned paramount floodlights who were joined by Hampshire in becoming the fifth county to install paramount floodlights at the Rose Bowl. Also 2006 saw {{the launch of the}} NatWest Pro40 League which replaced the National League however under the new format the counties only played other once in their divisions as opposed <b>to</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> away. This meant that the number of day/night matches played in the competition was reduced because the counties had fewer home matches to play with. The story stayed the same for 2007 but for one thing. On 10 September 2007, ten years after the first day/night matches were played in England Lord's finally got to stage its first game under floodlights with a match between Middlesex and Derbyshire, a match which Middlesex won by 4 wickets.|$|E
25|$|After {{the team}} left WWC, Butch {{decided that he}} wanted to return closer <b>to</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> went to Australia to wrestle. Luke {{remained}} in the United States determined to keep the “Sheepherders” name on everyone’s lips by teaming up with “Lord” Jonathan Boyd (formerly of the Royal Kangaroos). The duo of Williams and Boyd quickly gained a reputation {{of one of the most}} violent, hard hitting teams in the business. One of the first people to feel the wrath of the “new and improved” Sheepherders was Robert Fuller in South Eastern Championship Wrestling. In December 1981, the Sheepherders won the NWA Southeast Tag Team Championship that had been vacated when Robert Fuller and Jos LeDuc split. After winning the title, Boyd and Williams became embroiled in a bitter feud with Robert Fuller and various partners including his brother Ron Fuller and his cousin Jimmy Golden (later known as Bunkhouse Buck). One act that made the Sheepherders the most hated men in SECW for a while was when the duo kayfabe attacked and injured Jimmy’s father Billy Golden. After almost 10 months with the title, the Sheepherders were finally defeated by Fuller and Golden; this ended the feud on a high note for the face duo, as the Sheepherders were “run out” of the territory.|$|E
