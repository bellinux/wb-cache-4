40|$|A linear {{theory for}} the {{electromagnetic}} properties and interactions of an annular beam-ion channel system in plasma waveguide is presented. The dispersion relations for two families of propagating modes, including the electrostatic and <b>transverse</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>modes,</b> are derived. The dependencies of the dispersion behavior and interaction for different wave modes on {{the thickness of}} the annular beam and betatron oscillation frequency are studied in detail by numerical calculations.

In the weak ion channel situation, the two types of electrostatic waves, that is, space charge and betatron modes, have no interaction with the <b>transverse</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>modes.</b> However, in the strong ion channel situation, the <b>transverse</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>modes</b> will have two branches and a low frequency mode emerged as the new branch.
