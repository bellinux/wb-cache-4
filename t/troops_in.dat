5|$|Both plans {{started in}} July, but by mid-September, the Battle for Guadalcanal took {{priority}} for the Japanese, and <b>troops</b> <b>in</b> New Guinea were ordered {{to withdraw from the}} Port Moresby area to {{the northern part of the}} island, where they faced Australian and United States <b>troops</b> <b>in</b> the Battle of Buna-Gona. Guadalcanal soon became a focal point for both sides with heavy commitments of troops and ships in the battle for Guadalcanal. By the start of 1943, the Japanese were defeated on the island and withdrew their <b>troops.</b> <b>In</b> Burma, Commonwealth forces mounted two operations. The first, an offensive into the Arakan region in late 1942, went disastrously, forcing a retreat back to India by May 1943. The second was the insertion of irregular forces behind Japanese front-lines in February which, by the end of April, had achieved mixed results.|$|E
