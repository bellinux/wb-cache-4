5|$|A {{number of}} Manchester United players, {{including}} some of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>lost</b> {{their lives in the}} Munich air disaster of February 1958, lived in lodgings at 19 Gorse Avenue. A blue plaque was unveiled at the house by former lodger and Munich survivor Sir Bobby Charlton in recognition of the house's association with Manchester United. The owner of the house during the 1950s was Margaret Watson, although {{by the time of the}} plaque's unveiling more than 50 years later it was occupied by a different family.|$|E
5|$|Dogs {{were tied}} with strings around the belly {{and kept in}} the house where they were raised as a food source {{alongside}} domesticated pigs. Seen as a delicacy, they were served during feasts and to the high chiefs. Dogs were less abundant than pigs in the islands, possibly because they were killed while they were young. European visitors noticed the native women, especially <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>lost</b> their own children, would often breastfeed puppies and small pigs.|$|E

5|$|President Bush also {{declared}} Washington, D.C., as {{a disaster}} area {{two days after}} Isabel passed through the area. The United States Department of Agriculture approved a request for an emergency food stamp program for two weeks {{for the city to}} ensure <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>lost</b> food {{as a result of the}} hurricane would not go hungry. By eight days after the hurricane, the Department of Employment Services created disaster unemployment benefits for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>lost</b> their work as a direct result of Isabel. By 11days after Isabel, the government approved $5.21million in disaster assistance (2003USD, $ USD). The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers delivered nearly 800,000pounds (363,000kg) of dry ice to four distribution sites for use with cold food storage to areas in the District suffering from power outages. Various groups joined to provide more than 15,000meals for residents who lost stored food due to spoilage resulting from the power outages. Volunteers assisted in distributing 515tons (467t) of ice, along with 21,000 sandbags throughout the district. Officials opened two disaster recovery centers which moved through the neighborhoods of the district. Ultimately, nearly 1,500residents in the district applied for federal assistance, with FEMA providing the residents more than $600,000 in aid (2003USD, ($ USD).|$|E
5|$|A {{memorial}} at St Magnus' Cathedral {{in nearby}} Kirkwall displays a plaque dedicated to <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>lost</b> their lives, beneath which {{a book of}} remembrance lists their names. This list of names was not released by the Government until 40 years after the sinking. Each week a page {{of the book is}} turned. The ship's bell was recovered in the 1970s and, after being restored, was added to the memorial in St Magnus'. A number of bodies, including some that could not be identified, were interred at the naval cemetery in Lyness.|$|E
5|$|Daoíz is commemorated as {{a leader}} of the initial {{resistance}} against French rule in Spain and, along with Velarde, is remembered in many monuments across the country. The ashes of Daoíz and Velarde, with those of others involved in the Dos de Mayo uprising, were transferred to the Monumento a los Caidos por España in Madrid after its construction in 1840. The monument originally served as a memorial to <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>lost</b> their lives on the Dos de Mayo but on 22 November 1985 King Juan Carlos I redesignated it in memory of all Spaniards who died in war and it now serves as Spain's national Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.|$|E

5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} {{from the}} typhoon breached a flood-retaining wall at Camp Fuji, a training facility for the United States Marine Corps near Yokosuka. Marines inside the camp weathered the storm inside huts {{situated at the}} base of a hill which housed a fuel farm. The breach led to hoses being dislodged from two rubber storage bladders, releasing large quantities of fuel. The fuel flowed down the hill and was ignited by a heater used to warm one of the huts. The resultant fire killed 13 Marines, injured 68, and caused moderate damage to the facility. The facility's barracks were destroyed, along with fifteen huts and several other structures. The barracks were rebuilt, and a memorial was established for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>lost</b> their lives in the fire.|$|E
5|$|About half of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>lost</b> {{their lives}} on the Wall were killed in the first five years after it was {{originally}} installed. Death rates fell from then on, and took a particularly dramatic downturn after 1976. Nearly 86% of the Wall's victims, 120 people, died between 1961 and 1975; between 1976 and 1989 only 19 died. Several factors account for this reduction. The Wall became even more impregnable owing to technical improvements carried out in the mid-1970s and more restrictions were put on the area adjoining the Wall, making it more difficult to reach in the first place. The signing of the Helsinki Accords in 1975 led to new opportunities to cross the border legally, resulting in a rise in emigration applications and a corresponding fall in escape attempts.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the storm}} in South Africa, workers {{restored}} the original {{course of the}} Umfolozi River after it had moved. Officials later purchased a new dredge to remove sediment from Lake St. Lucia, and the canal connecting the lake to the Umfolozi River was later finished. Local governments coordinated relief efforts in the country, including delivering food and providing shelter for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>lost</b> their homes. The South African Red Cross provided food to storm victims, {{many of whom were}} beneficiaries of the food program during the extended drought. The South African government declared KwaZulu Natal as a disaster areas. The country's military provided 25helicopters to rescue flood victims and donated 3,000tents. The government later authorized $85million to fund repairing damaged rails and roads. The American government donated $100,000 to the country, mostly to purchase supplies. West Germany also donated about $231,000, mostly for the feeding program.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of the Nile {{remains one}} of the Royal Navy's most famous victories, and has {{remained}} prominent in the British popular imagination, sustained by its depiction in a large number of cartoons, paintings, poems, and plays. One of the best known poems about the battle is Casabianca, which was written by Felicia Dorothea Hemans in 1826 and describes a fictional account of the death of Captain Casabianca's son on Orient. Monuments were raised, including Cleopatra's Needle in London. Muhammad Ali of Egypt gave the monument in 1819 in recognition of the battle of 1798 and the campaign of 1801 but Great Britain did not erect it on the Victoria Embankment until 1878. Another memorial, the Nile Clumps near Amesbury, consists of stands of beech trees purportedly planted by Lord Queensbury at the bequest of Lady Hamilton and Thomas Hardy after Nelson's death. The trees form a plan of the battle; each clump represents the position of a British or French ship. A similar arboreal memorial is thought to have been planted near Alnwick by Nelson's agent Alexander Davison. The Royal Navy commemorated the battle with the ship names HMS Aboukir and HMS Nile, and in 1998 commemorated the 200th anniversary of the battle with a visit to Aboukir Bay by the modern frigate HMS Somerset, whose crew laid wreaths in memory of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>lost</b> their lives in the battle.|$|E
