5|$|Mephedrone can be {{synthesised}} {{in several}} ways. The simplest method, {{due to the}} availability of the compounds, is to add 4-methylpropiophenone dissolved in glacial acetic acid to bromine, creating an oil fraction of 4'-methyl-2-bromopropiophenone. The oil fraction can then be dissolved in dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) and drops of the solution added to another solution of CH2Cl2-containing methylamine hydrochloride and triethylamine. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is then added and the aqueous layer is removed and turned alkaline using sodium hydroxide before the amine is extracted using CH2Cl2. The CH2Cl2 is then evaporated using a vacuum, creating an oil which is then dissolved in a nonaqueous ether. Finally, HCl gas is bubbled through <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>to</b> produce 4-methylmethcathinone hydrochloride. This method produces a mixture of both enantiomers and requires similar knowledge to that required to synthesise amphetamines and MDMA.|$|E
5|$|The {{large scale}} {{production}} {{of ice cream}} also resulted from the ice trade. Ice cream had been produced in small quantities {{since at least the}} 17th century, but this depended both on having large quantities of ice available, and substantial amounts of labour to manufacture it. This was because using ice to freeze ice cream relies both on the application of salt to an ice mixture to produce a cooling effect, and also on constantly agitating <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>to</b> produce the light texture associated with ice cream. By the 1820s and 1830s, the availability of ice in the cities of the U.S. east coast meant that ice cream was becoming increasingly popular, but still an essentially luxury product. In 1843, however, a new ice cream maker was patented by Nancy Johnson which required far less physical effort and time; similar designs were also produced in England and France. Combined with the growing ice trade, ice cream became much more widely available and consumed in greater quantities. In Britain, Norwegian ice was used by the growing Italian community in London from the 1850s onwards to popularise ice cream with the general public.|$|E
25|$|Some mixers {{work under}} {{atmospheric}} pressure and others under vacuum. If vacuum is used, the mixture goes {{directly into the}} extrusion chamber. When the mixer works under atmospheric pressure, a vacuum unit (vacuum mixer) conveys <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>to</b> the extrusion chamber.|$|E

25|$|The {{increased}} {{partial pressure}} of oxygen {{due to the}} higher oxygen content of nitrox {{increases the risk of}} oxygen toxicity, which becomes unacceptable below the maximum operating depth of <b>the</b> <b>mixture.</b> <b>To</b> displace nitrogen without the increased oxygen concentration, other diluent gases can be used, usually helium, when the resultant three gas mixture is called trimix, and when the nitrogen is fully substituted by helium, heliox.|$|E
25|$|In July 1902, H. H. Franklin Manufacturing Company {{introduced}} a constant level carburetor. It was {{originally designed to}} enable an engine to operate through great ranges of speed and throttle without a change in quality of <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>to</b> compensate for a problem with earlier carburetors where {{the speed of the}} engine was limited by the amount of gasoline as the engine drew differing amounts of air.|$|E
25|$|The top, middle, {{and base}} notes of a {{fragrance}} may have separate primary scents and supporting ingredients. The perfume's fragrance oils are then blended with ethyl alcohol and water, aged in tanks {{for several weeks}} and filtered through processing equipment to, respectively, allow the perfume ingredients in <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>to</b> stabilize and to remove any sediment and particles before the solution can be filled into the perfume bottles.|$|E

50|$|A recent {{method of}} {{creating}} aluminum oxide foams {{has also been}} developed. This technique involves heating crystals with the metal and forming compounds until a solution is created. At this point, polymer chains form and grow, causing <b>the</b> entire <b>mixture</b> <b>to</b> separate into a solvent and polymer. As <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> begins <b>to</b> boil, air bubbles are trapped in solution and locked in to place as the material is heated and polymer is burned off.|$|R
25|$|It is not {{possible}} to completely purify a mixture of components by distillation, as this would require each component in <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>to</b> have a zero partial pressure. If ultra-pure products are the goal, then further chemical separation must be applied. When a binary mixture is evaporated and the other component, e.g. a salt, has zero partial pressure for practical purposes, the process is simpler and is called evaporation in engineering.|$|E
25|$|The {{result is}} that the ratio in the liquid mixture is changing, {{becoming}} richer in component B. This causes the boiling point of <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>to</b> rise, which in turn results in a rise in the temperature in the vapor, which results in a changing ratio of A : B in the gas phase (as distillation continues, there is an increasing proportion of B in the gas phase). This results in a slowly changing ratio A : B in the distillate.|$|E
25|$|The spray is {{produced}} from a reaction between two chemical compounds, hydroquinone and hydrogen peroxide, which {{are stored in}} two reservoirs in the beetle's abdomen. When the aqueous solution of hydroquinones and hydrogen peroxide reaches the vestibule, catalysts facilitate the decomposition of the hydrogen peroxide and the oxidation of the hydroquinone. Heat from the reaction brings <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>to</b> near the boiling point of water and produces gas that drives the ejection. The damage caused can be fatal to attacking insects. Some bombardier beetles can direct the spray {{over a wide range}} of directions.|$|E

25|$|When {{aggregate}} {{is mixed}} together with dry Portland cement and water, the mixture forms a fluid slurry that is easily poured and molded into shape. The cement reacts chemically {{with the water}} and other ingredients to form a hard matrix that binds the materials together into a durable stone-like material that has many uses. Often, additives (such as pozzolans or superplasticizers) are included in <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>to</b> improve the physical properties of the wet mix or the finished material. Most concrete is poured with reinforcing materials (such as rebar) embedded to provide tensile strength, yielding reinforced concrete.|$|E
25|$|After juice filtration, {{additional}} {{ingredients are}} added to <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>to</b> achieve the desired taste and consistency. Some of the main ingredients used to create ketchup include sweeteners, vinegar, salt and spices, and flavouring. These additions are usually integrated {{later on in the}} process with the exception of some spices added in at the beginning. Throughout the entire process, temperature must be consistently monitored to make sure all the ingredients are being added and absorbed properly. Air is then removed in order to prevent oxidation, maintain proper colouring and inhibit the growth of any unwanted bacteria. Before being packaged, the ketchup is heated to approx.190°F (88°C) to prevent contamination.|$|E
25|$|Hadia is a rice beer, {{created by}} mixing herbs with boiled rice and leaving <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>to</b> ferment for around a week. It is served cold and is less {{alcoholic}} than other Indian liquors. Chuak {{is a similar}} drink from Tripura. Palm wine, locally known as Neera, is a sap extracted from inflorescences of various species of toddy palms. Chhaang is consumed {{by the people of}} Sikkim and the Darjeeling Himalayan hill region of West Bengal. It is drunk cold or at room temperature in summer, and often hot during cold weather. Chhaang is similar to traditional beer, brewed from barley, millet, or rice.|$|E

25|$|For barium meal or barium follow-through examinations, a 6-hour {{period of}} fasting is {{observed}} {{prior to the}} studies. Barium is administered orally, sometimes mixed with diatrizoic acid to reduce transit time in the bowel. Metoclopramide is sometimes also added to <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>to</b> enhance gastric emptying. X-ray images are then taken in a supine position at intervals of 20–30 minutes. Real-time fluoroscopy is used to assess bowel motility. The radiologist may press or palpate the abdomen during images to separate intestinal loops. The total time necessary for the test depends on the speed of bowel motility or transit time and may vary between 1 and 3 hours.|$|E
25|$|About 80% of {{production}} involves suspension polymerization. Emulsion polymerization {{accounts for about}} 12%, and bulk polymerization accounts for 8%. Suspension polymerization affords particles with average diameters of 100–180μm, whereas emulsion polymerization gives much smaller particles of average size around 0.2μm. VCM and water are introduced into the reactor along with a polymerization initiator and other additives. The contents of the reaction vessel are pressurized and continually mixed to maintain the suspension and ensure a uniform particle size of the PVC resin. The reaction is exothermic and thus requires cooling. As the volume is reduced during the reaction (PVC is denser than VCM), water is continually added to <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>to</b> maintain the suspension.|$|E
25|$|The scrolls were {{analyzed}} using a cyclotron at the University of California, Davis, where {{it was found that}} all black ink was carbon black. The red ink on the scrolls was found to be made with cinnabar (HgS, mercury sulfide). There are only four uses of this red ink in the entire collection of Dead Sea Scroll fragments. The black inks found on the scrolls that are made up of carbon soot were found to be from olive oil lamps. Honey, oil, vinegar, and water were often added to <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>to</b> thin the ink to a proper consistency for writing. In order to apply the ink to the scrolls, its writers used reed pens.|$|E

25|$|The large {{majority}} of known organisms use catalase in every organ, with particularly high concentrations occurring in the liver in mammals. One unique use of catalase occurs in the bombardier beetle. This beetle has two sets of liquids that are stored separately in two paired glands. The larger of the pair, the storage chamber or reservoir, contains hydroquinones and hydrogen peroxide, while the smaller, the reaction chamber, contains catalases and peroxidases. To activate the noxious spray, the beetle mixes {{the contents of the}} two compartments, causing oxygen to be liberated from hydrogen peroxide. The oxygen oxidizes the hydroquinones and also acts as the propellant. The oxidation reaction is very exothermic (ΔH = −202.8 kJ/mol) and rapidly heats <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>to</b> the boiling point.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of ways to reduce the {{concentration}} of inclusions. In order to reduce oxide formation the metal can be melted with a flux, in a vacuum, or in an inert atmosphere. Other ingredients can be added to <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>to</b> cause the dross to float to the top where it can be skimmed off before the metal is poured into the mold. If this is not practical, then a special ladle that pours the metal from the bottom can be used. Another option is to install ceramic filters into the gating system. Otherwise swirl gates can be formed which swirl the liquid metal as it is poured in, forcing the lighter inclusions to the center and keeping them out of the casting. If some of the dross or slag is folded into the molten metal then it becomes an entrainment defect.|$|E
25|$|The {{remaining}} 119 undelivered aircraft {{were bought}} {{up by the}} British Purchasing Commission and transferred to the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) for the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan between August and September 1940, and all were operational by November The type was named the Yale Mk.I following British naming practice of naming trainers after education institutions and US-supplied aircraft after American locations, in this case, Yale University, and were used initially as intermediate pilot trainers taking pilots from the de Havilland Tiger Moth and Fleet Finch to the much faster and more complex North American Harvard, until this category was dispensed with as being unnecessary. They were then relegated for use as airborne wireless radio trainers, along with the contemporary Fleet Fort intermediate trainer in 1943. Prior to service entry, the throttle and engine mixture controls were modified from the system used by the French whereby the throttle was pulled back to increase power, and the mixture control pulled back to lean out <b>the</b> <b>mixture,</b> <b>to</b> the system used on the Harvard. The Yale appeared in the movie Captains of the Clouds.
