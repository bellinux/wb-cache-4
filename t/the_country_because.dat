5|$|The Roman Catholic Church's {{refusal to}} countenance {{occasional}} attendance at Protestant services, {{as well as}} the excommunication of Elizabeth by Pope Pius V in 1570, presented the choice to Roman Catholics more starkly. The arrival of the seminary priests, while it was a lifeline to many Roman Catholics, brought further trouble. Elizabeth's ministers took steps to stem the tide: fines for refusal to attend church were raised from 12d. per service to £20 a month, fifty times an artisan's wage; it was now treason to be absolved from schism and reconciled to Rome; the execution of priests began—the first in 1577, four in 1581, eleven in 1582, two in 1583, six in 1584, fifty-three by 1590, and seventy more between 1601 and 1608. It became treasonable for a Roman Catholic priest ordained abroad to enter <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> <b>Because</b> the papacy had called for the deposing of the Queen, the choice for moderate Roman Catholics lay between treason and damnation.
