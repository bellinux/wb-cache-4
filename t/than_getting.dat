5|$|Unfortunately, Daley's theory—that it can {{be better}} to get a sum X immediately, rather <b>than</b> <b>getting</b> over many years a sum Y that is {{substantially}} larger than X—assumes something that cannot be assumed. It assumes that governments will prudently husband sudden surges of revenue from the lease or sale of assets.|$|E
5|$|From {{his base}} in Tel Aviv, Holocaust {{survivor}} Emmanuel Lieber directs {{a group of}} Jewish Nazi hunters in search of Adolf Hitler. Lieber believes that the former Führer is still alive, and following rumours and hearsay, he tracks Hitler's movements through South America. After months of wading through swamps in the Amazon jungle, the search party finds the 90-year-old alive in a clearing. Lieber flies to San Cristóbal where he awaits the group's return with their captive. But getting the old man out of the jungle alive is more difficult <b>than</b> <b>getting</b> in, and their progress is further hampered by heavy thunderstorms.|$|E
5|$|The 2012 {{date was}} also loosely {{tied to the}} long-running concept of the Photon Belt, which {{predicted}} a form of interaction between Earth and Alcyone, the largest star of the Pleiades cluster. Critics argued that photons cannot form belts, that the Pleiades, located more than 400 light years away, could {{have no effect on}} Earth, and that the Solar System, rather <b>than</b> <b>getting</b> closer to the Pleiades, was in fact moving farther away from it.|$|E

25|$|Mother Courage {{is among}} Brecht's most famous plays. Some {{directors}} consider {{it to be}} the greatest play of the 20th century. Brecht expresses the dreadfulness of war and the idea that virtues are not rewarded in corrupt times. He used an epic structure to force the audience to focus on the issues rather <b>than</b> <b>getting</b> involved with the characters and their emotions. Epic plays are a distinct genre typical of Brecht. Some critics believe that he created the form.|$|E
25|$|In Afghanistan, a {{helicopter}} carrying Arian and Ernest is hit by Taliban insurgents. Ernest falls out, and Arian jumps after him. Ernest's leg is badly wounded, and he suffers a compound fracture, rendering him immobile as the Taliban arrive. After a drawn-out gunfight, the U.S. soldiers {{run out of}} ammunition. Rather <b>than</b> <b>getting</b> captured, Arian helps Ernest stand up, facing the enemies and turning their empty weapons against them, an action which prompts the Taliban to kill them. The unit commanders attempt a rescue of the downed soldiers, sending A-10 Warthogs, but the weather, time, and distance interfere.|$|E
25|$|A loss of {{opportunity}} is {{another kind of}} loss that is represented in Albee’s play. Agnes has lost the opportunities of youth, of having another child. Agnes’s sister Claire has lost her opportunity at married life, having children, doing something with her life other <b>than</b> <b>getting</b> drunk. Julia, Agnes and Tobias’s daughter, has lost several marriages {{and the opportunity to}} have children. She has also lost her room, symbolic of having lost her childhood. Julia has also lost a brother, who died in his youth. This loss Agnes mourns as a loss of love. After the death of the child, Tobias and Agnes no longer attempted to have more children. This eventually led to the loss of their sexual life together.|$|E

As he departs Detroit on a bus, he angrily remarks to Homer that he {{would have been better off}} if he never met him and that as far as he is concerned, he has no brother. While Marge tries to console Homer, Lisa agrees with Herb and laments on his life before he discovered he was a [...] "Simpson". Grampa soon arrives and asks about Herb.

500|$|After {{being dropped}} by Columbia, the band {{set off to}} Brazil to support All Time Low in January 2011. They {{subsequently}} began recording their fifth studio album with producer and longtime friend Ed Ackerson at his studio, Flowers Studio, in Minneapolis. The band recorded on their own time with their own resources, which both provided comfort {{and a sense of}} nervousness to the group. They did not sit down and preconceive the album as a change in style, but rather relaxed and took their time writing it. [...] "We just felt like it was like we were just taking our time and just kinda living life and not worrying about too much other <b>than</b> <b>getting</b> together and making music," [...] remarked Taylor. Pierre has since looked back on Go with mixed emotions, citing it as his personal least favorite album by the band. He noted that he was struggling with dark thoughts and felt that the band's collective misery translated to the record.|$|E

[...] The reviewer concluded that [...] "it's hard to imagine better uses for a touch screen <b>than</b> <b>getting</b> {{as close as possible to}} the carefree fun on display here." [...] Steven Gottlieb of Video Static said, [...] " [...] a casual and sunny pop video gets a bit of a twist, or a flick, via an interface that's swiped from your iPhone...It's possibly not the kind of finger manipulation some Kelly Rowland fans have been dreaming about, but even they should admit it's a clever conceit." ...|$|E

500|$|Frank Scheck, of the Hollywood Reporter, {{believed}} {{that even though}} Zombie's remake of Carpenter's Halloween was better <b>than</b> <b>getting</b> another sequel in the long running franchise it still was not comparable to the 1978 original. For Scheck, Zombie replaced Carpenter's building suspense, which made it so [...] "brilliant", with graphic violence and extended scenes of nudity; he also criticized McDowell for lacking the intensity that Donald Pleasence brought to the Loomis character. By contrast, TV Guide's Ken Fox felt that Zombie did deliver a [...] "scary horror movie", not by copying Carpenter, but by making the film his own. Fox noted that Zombie seemed to follow more {{in the footsteps of}} Wes Craven and Tobe Hooper's [...] "savage, greasy-haired '70s" [...] films, which allowed him to bring Michael back to his roots and successfully terrify an audience which has grown accustomed to the recent [...] "torture porn" [...] horror films. Bill Gibron, of PopMatters, believes that audiences and critics cannot compare Carpenter's film to Zombie's remake; where Carpenter focused more on the citizens of Haddonfield—with Michael acting as a true [...] "boogeyman"—Zombie focuses more on Michael himself, successfully forcing the audience to experience all of the elements that Michael went through that would result in his [...] "desire for death".|$|E
500|$|The {{music for}} Countdown to Extinction {{was written in}} two {{different}} sessions. The first session was done following the conclusion of Clash of the Titans tour, while the second session took place after a one-month break, {{in the fall of}} 1991. The album was recorded {{in the first half of}} 1992, when the Rodney King Riots took place. These events negatively affected the recording process, as the band was forced to leave the studio every night at six o'clock because of the enacted curfew. Dave Mustaine shared his experience: [...] "There’s nothing worse <b>than</b> <b>getting</b> a creative moment and you have to leave. It was like a school bell ringing." [...] The record was produced by Mustaine and Max Norman at The Enterprise in Burbank, California, while the mixing was handed by Norman with the help of Fred Kelly. Referring to the recording process, Mustaine said that Countdown to Extinction [...] "was one of those records where everything was firing on all 12 cylinders and you just know it". He also said that it didn't take the band a long time to record the album because [...] "records were a lot easier to make back then because the pressure wasn't quite as hard".|$|E
500|$|Many of Uematsu's musical {{influences}} {{come from}} the United Kingdom and the United States. He cites Elton John as his biggest musical influence, and he has stated {{that he wanted to}} be like him. Other major inspirations include The Beatles, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Simon & Garfunkel, and progressive rock bands. In the classical genre, he cites Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky as a great influence. Uematsu has said that 1970s bands, such as Pink Floyd and King Crimson, influenced his Final Fantasy compositions. The intro to the piece [...] "One-Winged Angel" [...] from Final Fantasy VII was inspired by the Jimi Hendrix song [...] "Purple Haze"; the lyrics were taken from the medieval poetry on which Carl Orff based his cantata Carmina Burana, specifically the songs [...] "Estuans Interius", [...] "O Fortuna", [...] "Veni, Veni, Venias" [...] and [...] "Ave Formosissima". In turn, Nobuo Uematsu has had a major influence on video game music and beyond the video games industry as well. For example, [...] "Liberi Fatali" [...] from Final Fantasy VIII was played during the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens during the women's synchronized swimming event. From the same game, [...] "Eyes on Me", featuring Chinese pop singer Faye Wong, sold a record 400,000 copies and was the first song from a video game to win an award at the Japan Gold Disc Awards, where it won [...] "Song of the Year (International)" [...] in 2000.
