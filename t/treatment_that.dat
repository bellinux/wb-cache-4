5|$|Executive {{producer}} and co-writer George Lucas {{decided to make}} the film a prequel as he did not want the Nazis to be the villains again. After three rejected plot devices, Lucas wrote a film <b>treatment</b> <b>that</b> resembled the film's final storyline. Lawrence Kasdan, Lucas's collaborator on Raiders of the Lost Ark, turned down the offer to write the script, and Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz were hired as his replacements, with the screenplay partly based upon the 1939 film Gunga Din.|$|E
5|$|Hepatitis C {{is caused}} by an RNA virus. In 80% of people infected, the disease becomes chronic, and they remain {{infectious}} {{for the rest of}} their lives unless they are treated. There is an effective <b>treatment</b> <b>that</b> uses the nucleoside analogue drug ribavirin combined with interferon. Treatments for chronic carriers of the hepatitis B virus by a similar strategy using lamivudine and other anti-viral drugs have been developed. In both diseases, the drugs stop the virus from reproducing and the interferon kills any remaining infected cells.|$|E

5|$|Patients {{and their}} guardians must be apprised of any serious risks {{and the common}} side effects of pain treatments. What {{appears to be an}} {{obviously}} acceptable risk or harm to a professional may be unacceptable to the person who has to undertake that risk or experience the side effect. For instance, people who experience pain on movement may be willing to forgo strong opioids in order to enjoy alertness during their painless periods, whereas others would choose around-the-clock sedation so as to remain pain-free. The care provider should not insist on <b>treatment</b> <b>that</b> someone rejects, and must not provide <b>treatment</b> <b>that</b> the provider believes is more harmful or riskier than the possible benefits can justify.|$|E

5|$|The risk of {{developing}} pancreatic cancer is lower among non-smokers, and people who maintain a healthy weight and limit their consumption of red or processed meat. A smoker's chance {{of developing}} the disease decreases if they stop smoking, and almost returns {{to that of the}} rest of the population after 20years. Pancreatic cancer can be treated with surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, palliative care, or a combination of these. Treatment options are partly based on the cancer stage. Surgery is the only <b>treatment</b> <b>that</b> can cure pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and may also be done to improve quality of life without the potential for cure. Pain management and medications to improve digestion are sometimes needed. Early palliative care is recommended even for those receiving <b>treatment</b> <b>that</b> aims for a cure.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} tests {{conducted}} by the PSB Corporation and SGS Testing & Control Services found the spring water contains 420mg of chloride per litre, an amount which is substantially higher than the 35 to 100mg in the water from Choa Chu Kang and Bedok waterworks. It was {{also found that the}} sulphide content is three times more than tap water and the spring water is also slightly alkaline due to the presence of minerals. Natural spring waters may have health benefits, similar to the hot springs of other countries near tectonic plates with volcanoes, in a search for cures for some skin conditions, as well as debilitating ailments like rheumatism and arthritis. Although local rheumatologists conceded that hydrotherapy is an accepted <b>treatment</b> <b>that</b> can be helpful for mild forms of rheumatism or muscle strain, they, along with dermatologists, remain skeptical of claims about the alternative healing of the natural spring water.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Szilard {{switched}} to biology. He invented the chemostat, discovered feedback inhibition, and {{was involved in}} the first cloning of a human cell. He publicly sounded the alarm against the possible development of salted thermonuclear bombs, a new kind of nuclear weapon that might annihilate mankind. Diagnosed with bladder cancer in 1960, he underwent treatment using a cobalt-60 <b>treatment</b> <b>that</b> he had designed. He helped found the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, where he became a resident fellow.

In 1929, New York police raided a clinic in New York and arrested two doctors and three nurses for distributing {{contraceptive}} information that was unrelated to the prevention of disease. The ABCL achieved a major victory in the trial, when the judge ruled that use of contraceptives to space births farther apart was a legitimate medical <b>treatment</b> <b>that</b> benefited {{the health of the}} mother. The trial, in which many prominent physicians served as witnesses for the defense, brought {{a large segment of the}} medical community onto the side {{of birth control}} advocates.|$|E
5|$|Following For Your Eyes Only, Roger Moore had {{expressed}} a desire to stop playing James Bond. His original contract had been for three films, a requirement fulfilled with The Spy Who Loved Me. Subsequent films had been negotiated on a film-by-film basis. The producers engaged in a semi-public quest for the next actor to play Bond, which would be for Octopussy. However, when Kevin McClory announced his re-working of Thunderball as Never Say Never Again, the producers re-contracted Moore in the belief that an established actor in the role would fare better against McClory's choice of Bond, Sean Connery. Before For Your Eyes Only had been released, Albert Broccoli had asked John Glen to return and direct Octopussy. George MacDonald Fraser wrote an initial <b>treatment</b> <b>that</b> was extensively revised by Michael G. Wilson and Richard Maibaum.|$|E

5|$|Freda's {{ambition}} {{to make a}} horror film derived from his desire to make films in the fantastique style, feeling that only the Americans and German expressionists {{were able to make}} such films in the past. Freda approached film producer Luigi Carpentieri with the idea of the film despite not having a treatment ready. Promising them that he would have something for them by the next day, he returned with a tape of his <b>treatment</b> <b>that</b> was complete with sound effects. Carpentieri phoned Goffredo Lombardo to convince him further. Freda followed up his tape with the promise that his script could pass the censors and could be filmed in 12 days. This convinced the producer who allowed Freda to create what became I Vampiri. I Vampiri was a low-budget production with Donati and Capentieri of Athena and Lombardo's Titanus investing 32 million lire each initially into the film. The initial budget was 97 million Italian lire which increased to 142 million for its post-production and release after the films format was switched to panoramic CinemaScope.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the stated}} {{purposes}} for writing the account was Las Casas's fear of Spain coming under divine punishment and {{his concern for}} {{the souls of the}} native peoples. The account {{was one of the first}} attempts by a Spanish writer of the colonial era to depict the unfair <b>treatment</b> <b>that</b> the indigenous people endured during the early stages of the Spanish conquest of the Greater Antilles, particularly the island of Hispaniola. Las Casas's point of view can be described as being heavily against some of the Spanish methods of colonization, which, as he described them, inflicted great losses on the indigenous occupants of the islands. His account was largely responsible for the adoption of the New Laws of 1542, which abolished native slavery for the first time in European colonial history and led to the Valladolid debate.|$|E
