The authors reviewed {{the synthesis}} of mesoporous <b>silica</b> <b>materials</b> and their classification, their formation mechanism, {{as well as the}} aspects of controlling porosity and recent progresses of their applications.

40|$|In {{this review}} article we collect and analyse preparation, {{chemistry}} and properties of <b>silica</b> <b>materials</b> relevant for drug delivery applications. We review {{some of the}} most relevant milestones in the research of <b>silica</b> <b>materials</b> for implantable, oral, intravenous and dermal drug delivery systems. Preparation, chemistry and drug delivery characteristics of fumed silica nanoparticles (oral and dermal delivery route), silica xerogels (implant delivery), mesoporous <b>silica</b> <b>materials</b> (implant and oral delivery) and mesoporous silica spheres (intravenous delivery) with particular emphasis on their role in anticancer therapy and the design of stimuli responsive drug delivery systems are analysed. Recent progress in the research of <b>silica</b> <b>materials</b> for controlled drug delivery, namely, biocompatibility aspects, research on hybrid materials, anticancer and stimuli-responsive mesoporous <b>silica</b> <b>materials</b> are particularly emphasized.

40|$|Abstract. Characteristics of <b>silica</b> optical <b>material</b> largely {{depend on}} its thermal history. In this paper, {{formation}} of thermally induced defects in <b>silica</b> optical <b>material</b> is studied. The formation process of defect is analyzed in detail. The {{results show that}} there is an obvious difference in defect formation induced by heating treatment when the composition of <b>silica</b> optical <b>material</b> changes. Defect formation mainly displays as the produce process when the initial defects of the <b>silica</b> <b>material</b> are zero. However, defect formation expresses as the produce and annealing process when the initial defects of the <b>silica</b> <b>material</b> are not zero. The initial defect concentration can be decreased significantly when the <b>silica</b> <b>material</b> is heated in high temperature. At the same time, the new defect is also produced. These theoretic results are consistent with the previous experimental ones...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} investigations aimed at determining {{the structure of}} low-temperature tridymite in refractory <b>silica</b> <b>materials.</b> In the initial phase of works, the literature and Internet databases containing structural data of crystalline compounds were reviewed {{in search of a}} model of tridymite structure which best fits the one forming in <b>silica</b> <b>materials.</b> The results of reviewing the models of polymorphous tridymite forms which are available in the world literature have been verified by Rietveld method, using a sample of <b>silica</b> <b>material</b> that contained tridymite without cristobalite and residual quartz. On the basis of analyses it was found that tridymite in refractory <b>silica</b> <b>materials</b> occurs in a form of two low-temperature polymorphous forms C 1 and F 1, instead of one form – Cc, as it was assumed before. The developed model has been used in a quantitative analysis (Rietvield method) of phase composition of several silica refractories...|$|R

40|$|Poly (1, 4 bis(triethoxysilyl) benzene) (PTESB), a {{representative}} of {{a new type of}} organic-inorganic hybrid polysilsesquioxane material, was characterized by fluorescence spectroscopy for both microenvironmental polarity and solvent accessibility. A dansyl fluorescent molecule was incorporated into the bulk as well as onto the surface of both PTESB and <b>silica</b> <b>materials.</b> Information about the microenvironment polarity and accessibility of PTESB to various organic solvents was determined and compared to that of silica gel. This study found that both the bulk and surface of PTESB are less polar than that of the <b>silica</b> <b>material.</b> The <b>silica</b> <b>material</b> is accessible to polar solvents and water, while YMB is accessible to polar solvents but not to water. The hydrophobicity of PTESB differentiates these new <b>materials</b> from <b>silica</b> gel...|$|R
