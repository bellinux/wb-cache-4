40|$|Port {{state control}} (PSC) {{inspection}} {{is the most}} important mechanism to ensure world marine safe. This paper presents a risk assessment system, which estimates the risk of each candidate ship based on its generic factors and history inspection factors to select high-risk one before conducting on-board PSC inspection. The target factors adopted in Paris MOU PSC inspection and <b>Tokyo</b> <b>MOU</b> PSC inspection are considered in this system as well as the new factors discovered in the PSC inspection database. A risk assessment system based on support vector machine (SVM) is developed to classify candidate ships to high risk or low risk, respectively, based on the target factors. Experiment results show that the proposed system enhances the risk assessment accuracy effectively. Department of ComputingRefereed conference pape...|$|E
500|$|Several other {{regional}} Memoranda Of Understanding {{have been established}} based on the Paris model, including the [...] "Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control in the Asia-Pacific Region", typically {{referred to as the}} [...] "Tokyo MOU", and organizations for the Black Sea, the Caribbean, the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean, and Latin America. The Tokyo and Paris organizations generate, based on deficiencies and detentions, black-, white-, and grey-lists of flag states. The US Coast Guard, which handles port state control inspections in the US, maintains a similar target list for underperforming flag states. , fourteen of the thirty-four flags of convenience listed by the ITF are targeted for special enforcement by the countries of the Paris and <b>Tokyo</b> <b>MOUs</b> or U.S. Coast Guard: Antigua and Barbuda, Belize, Bolivia, Cambodia, the Cayman Islands, Comoros, Cyprus, Honduras, North Korea, Malta, Moldova, Mongolia, Panama, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Vanuatu.|$|R
40|$|The ship {{inspection}} {{system can be}} regarded as a frontline fighting against substandard ships. However, the ship inspec-tion rate in Taiwan is low and the vessels under the flag are categorized in the grey list by Paris and <b>Tokyo</b> <b>MOUs</b> accord-ing to statistics. Thus, the current status of the ship {{inspection system}} of the country should be examined and improved. In this paper, the ship inspection system is evaluated in terms of the system structure, legislation, mechanisms and training patterns. The shortcomings are appreciated under the Hierarchical Task Analysis structure. A list of the alternatives for improvement and the priority are accordingly established based on the Value-Focused Thinking and Analytical Hierarchy Process methods. In addition, the training courses capable of creating prompt effects on ship inspection performance for short terms are also proposed. It is believed that the solutions proposed in this paper will enable the government to establish an integrated scheme for ship inspections. I...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to perform an {{overview}} of the denotation and the use of the Key Performance Indicators (KPI) method in shipping industry and to analyze the performance of a specific company in Port State Control (PSC) KPI. This is accomplished by describing Key Performance indicators, their necessity, their structure, and the requirements during the design and the field of application. A brief historical reference in KPIs is also carried out and furthermore, it is also described reason and method this model was introduced in shipping industry. The established Shipping KPI model is presented in detail, as supported and developed by BIMCO, which is the world largest international shipping association. The model is a global tool for defining, measuring and reporting information on a ship's operational performance in order to boost performance improvements with companies engaged in ship operation activities and to provide an efficient communication platform on ship operation performance to internal and external stakeholders. In addition to the above, this paper reviews and analyzes the performance of a specific shipping Company in port state control inspections carried out on board managed vessels for the period of 2012 - 2016. The company has a fleet of containers and bulk carriers of variable size, age, type, classification society and flag. Through the examination of port state control inspections, results are scrutinized with regards to specific characteristics of the ships, in an effort to establish trends affecting port state control inspections of the company. The results are further analyzed in order to connect detentions with average deficiencies and those with specific vessels’ characteristics, such as age, vessel type, flag and classification societies and the connection of those. Further examination is performed trying to benchmark company’s performance in <b>Tokyo</b> and Paris <b>MOU</b> and US Coast Guard, and evaluate all necessary actions needed in order same to be improved. The analysis is also carried out against industry standards and requirements in order to further identify weaknesses, which need to be addressed through strategic planning and additional actions from the company’s side...|$|R

40|$|The ISPS Code {{had come}} into effect on the 1 st of July 2004. The overall {{objectives}} of the Code are to establish an international framework involving co-operation between contracting governments, government agencies, local administrations and the shipping industry to detect maritime security threats and take pro-active measures against potential terrorist attacks against ships and/or port facilities which are the vital instruments of the international trade. The Code aims to reduce the vulnerability of port facilities and merchant ships to terrorist attacks and to increase the secur ity awareness of the industry. The ISPS Code, is the first ever internationally and widely agreed proactive regulatory framework to safeguard the maritime industry, seaborne trade, and the world economy from terrorism. In this study the success level of implementation of the ISPS Code already achieved by the ship managers is analysed through the port state control databases of the major regional maritime administrations and MOUs such as the Paris MOU, the <b>Tokyo</b> <b>MOU,</b> the Black Sea MOU and the United States Coast Guard (USCG). The monthly statistics of ISPS non-compliant ships have been compiled based on the variables such as the ships’ flag, type, gross tonnage (gt), {{and the nature of}} deficiencies between the 1 st July 2004, when the ISPS Code came into force, until the end those of months with available statistics currently released on the websites of the respective MOUs. Common awareness of errors and lapses, best practices, sharing of information, and industry-wide co-operation will play a vital role to develop a security culture in the shipping industry...|$|E
40|$|This paper applies Hofstede’s {{cultural}} dimensions {{into the}} shipping industry and analyzes the culture effects on vessel detention. All ships {{have their own}} nationality but the flag control is manageably sophisticated. Substandard ships are aware of high risks, and quality control of ships {{is critical to the}} maritime safety and security. It has been proved that the detention rate depends on the flag of registry together with ship age, inspecting authority, type of ship, and recognized organization influencing. Previous research has focused on the performance of individual flag of registry in terms of casualty and detention rate. This study considers the collective characteristics of flags according to culture effects and their influences on ship quality. Based on Hofstede’s five‐dimension culture theory, we map the flag states on culture dimensions. From 12, 635 detention records of the <b>Tokyo</b> <b>MOU</b> region from 2000 to 2009, we determine the effect of culture dimensions against the vessel detention. The findings can be summarised in two aspects. First, the power distance index has little influences on the detention rate. Second, more importantly, the individualism, uncertainty avoidance index and long‐term orientation have positively impacts on the number of detentions. Our findings show that culture indeed has an effect on the vessel detention taken by different Port State Controls. A further look on the flag of registry is that the performance of individual flags may be better illustrated if individual flags are classified according to culture dimensions. This paper is organised as follows: Section 1 introduces the background; Section 2 discusses related literature; Section 3 considers the data collection and methodology; Section 4 concerns the findings; and Section 5 addresses conclusions and further research.

40|$|The {{intention}} of the ISM Code is to provide safety management objectives both ashore and on board {{for the purpose of}} minimising risks and preventing marine casualties, as well as promoting the pollution prevention policy. The purpose of this thesis is to analyse the objectives and the implementation process for the shipping company and her assets, the ships. The responsibilities and the authorities arising from the Safety Management System (SMS), adopted by each company, for all the individuals ashore and aboard highlighted in Chapter 2. As important is to establish a well understood, feasible SMS, as vital is to establish procedures for the control and the inspection of the proper implementation from the Administrations. The objective of the audits, as dealt with in Chapter 3, is to seek information about the SMS and to determine the degree of compliance with the applicable rules and regulations, over a reasonable period of time. Chapter 4 is concemed with the purpose of the vessels boarding program, which is to monitor and inspect vessels to ensure they are operated in a safe manner and, are in compliance with the state and the international rules. Consequently, Chapter 5, focus on the results of Port State Confrols that carried out both by the Paris MOU and <b>Tokyo</b> <b>MOU,</b> and the Hellenic Coast Guard on Greek Owned Container Vessels. Tables with the deficiencies or details of causes that lead to deficiencies are listed in order to be a quick but valuable reference to any party of the marine industry that may be concemed. Conmients from the numerous interviews are also, included in this Chapter. Finally, in the conclusion author will present some thoughts that arose in the process of the research aiming to answer any possible question that may occur to the reader, regarding the ISM Code implementation on board and Port State Control...|$|E
40|$|Tez (Yüksek Lisans) [...] İstanbul Teknik Üniversitesi, Fen Bilimleri Enstitüsü, 2015 Thesis (M. Sc.) [...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2015 Ucuzluğu ve güvenilirliği nedeniyle uluslararası ticaretin belkemiği olan deniz ticaretinin yıllar içinde artan hacmi nedeniyle gemilerin denetlenmesi ihtiyacı ortaya çıkmıştır. Bu kapsamda öncelikle Bayrak Devleti Kontrolü uygulamaya sokulmuş ancak çeşitli sebeplerle (kolay bayrak devleti uygulamaları, sektörün büyümesi, tecrübesizlik, kaynak yetersizliği vb.) bayrak devletlerinin gemileri üzerindeki kontrolünü kaybetmeye başlamasıyla yaşanılan sorunların ortadan kaldırılması maksadıyla yürürlükteki uygulama ve sözleşmelerde değişiklikler yapılarak Liman Devleti Kontrolü yürürlüğe konulmuştur. Bu kapsamda {{standart}}ları sağlayamayan gemilerin tespit edilerek yaptırımlar uygulanması maksadıyla 14 ülke ile 1982 yılında ilk Mutabakat Zaptı olan Paris MOU imzalanmıştır. Halihazırda dünya denizlerini kapsayan 9 bölgesel MOU ve USCG Liman Devleti Kontrolü’nü yerine getirmektedir. Ancak bu uygulamada da denetçi sayısı azlığı, hedefleme sistemlerindeki parametrik farklılıklar vb. nedenlerle bölgeler arasında standart bir uygulamanın olmaması gibi çeşitli sorunlar ortaya çıkmaya başlamıştır. Son yıllarda ise yukarıda bahsedilen iki uygulamaya ek olarak standart altı gemilerin tespit edilerek yüklerin daha iyi/bakımlı ve sorunsuz gemilere taşıtılması maksadıyla sektörde yer alan çeşitli firmalar tarafından İnceleme Denetimleri kapsamında yük taşıtılacak gemilerin denetimi yapılmaya başlanmıştır.   Bu çalışmada İnceleme Denetimleri altında yer alan SIRE özelinde Türk firmalarına bir soru formu gönderilerek 2006 - 2014 yılları arasında yapılan denetimlere ait bilgiler alınmıştır. Bu kapsamda 16 firmaya yapılan toplam 393 denetim incelenmiştir. Denetimler 9 MOU’da, 40 ayrı limanda ve 14 farklı denetçi firma tarafından yapılmıştır. Eldeki edilen verilerin SPSS programında analizi yapılarak  değerlendirilmesi yapılmış, gerçekleştirilen denetim sonuçları incelenerek, bulunan eksikliklerin ve bunlara ait sebeplerin araştırılmasına çalışılmıştır.   Yapılan çalışma sonucunda genel itibariyle; - Denetlenen firmaların denetim başına eksiklik oranlarının birbirlerine yakın olduğu, - Denetimlerde saptanan eksikliklerin, gerek yıllara göre gerekse de denetimi icra eden firmalara göre bakıldığında genel toplamda olduğu gibi 5. bölüm (Emniyet Yönetimi), 8. bölüm  (Petrol, Kimyasal, LPG ve LNG) ve 11. bölümde (Makine ve Dümen Sistemi) yoğunlaştığı,  - Bölgelere göre elde edilen denetim başına eksiklik oranları arasında ciddi bir fark olmadığı, - Denetim başına eksiklik oranının yıllara bağlı olarak azaldığı, tespit edilmiştir. Because {{seaborne trade}} is cheap and safe, {{it has been}} main stay of the international trade. As seaborne trade has increasing annual volumes, the requirement for inspection of ships has raised. In this context, to consider historical development of the inspection forms in the world, it is required to review 13. - 14. century. In these centuries, state control started by intervention to ship loading boundaries, and then developped by the inspection of the captains information, seasons to put out to sea, rules for ship building and eligibility to sea during the centuries; which then {{laid the groundwork for}} state responsibility and control with royal mandates, commandments, court decisions and laws. Because of the increasing volumes in seaborne trade, international community had to co-operate to provide sea safety and to protect marine environment. On the protection of enviroment, international contracts and administration leaded by IMO contributed much to international efforts, intensely in 1970 s. With one of these agreements, United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (1982), flag states were charged with life and property safety of ships; and provide and perpetuate protection of marine environment. In this context, under the control of flag states, the eligible ships are allowed to navigate, and those which are not eligible are allowed to navigate only if they provide the completion of their imperfection. Thereby; by protection of marine environment, marine safety, and perfection of living and working conditions within the ships; minimization of accident risk is provided. Although flag states were authorizated for the compliance inspections of the ships to the international standards of the agreements.; flag states started losing their inspection and control functions over the ships due to various reasons, as: - Fast growth in world navigation fleet, - Deployment of Flag of Convenience applications, - Ships working in long distance, away from flag states, - Lack of experience, - Lack of sources, Due to those reasons, to prevent marine pollution and to provide navigation safety; implementation and agreements in operation were reviewed and changed. Additionally, to  correct the problems of Flag State Controls, Port State Controls were introduced. By Port State Controls, it was aimed to debug flag state controls which was insufficient to inspection eligibility of the ships to international standards, and to apply sanctions to ships not providing  those standards. While struggling against the sub-standart ships, insufficiency of national implemetations on its own, demanded co-operation. It was conclued that, according to the Port State Control,  regional cooperation was is the most functional co-operation type. Thus, standardization of Port State Controls, prevention of unfair trade between the ports, and performing more efficient inspections of the neighbouring states on the ships visiting their regions were provided. In this context, with the aim of detection of the ships which do not provide the standards and to apply sanctions for those, first memorandum of understanding, Paris MOU was signed in 1982 with the participation of 14 countries. Currently, 9 regional MOU exists including world seas. - Paris MOU -   <b>Tokyo</b> <b>MOU</b> -   Vina del Mar MOU -   Caribbean MOU -   Abuja MOU -   Black Sea MOU -   Mediterranean MOU -   Indian Ocean MOU -   Riyadh MOU USA, did not take place within regional agreements made out under Port State Control scope, instead, adopted one-side control precautions by USCG. However, in this Port State Control, due to insufficient number of inspector, parametric differences in targeting systems, etc. several problems occured like non-standard implementations between regions. In recent years, additional to the two applications mentioned above, aiming detection of sub-standart ships and transfer of the shipments by better/well kept and problem-free ships; inspections of the ships are executed in the context of Vetting Inspection by various firms within the sector. These inspections can be performed by: - Individual oil/chemical companies or terminals, - Accredited SIRE inspectors under the SIRE system, - Accredited CDI inspectors under the CDI system, By reason of the inspection, it is not decided whether the ship can pass fail an inspection, however the inspection forms are considered during selection process. The final decision is taken due to various variables as: Port State Control records, terminal reports, the information about ship owner, loading/unloading ports, longevity of the navigation and directions.   In this context, CDI {{is one of the most}} applied Vetting Inspection, which is a Holland establishment, conducting the operation from England. It is a non-profit organization with 83 members and  facilitates 7 / 24 access to inspection reports by database. It is divided into two as CDI-M and CDI-T; and at present 150 inspector and reporters are performing inspections all over the world. Another application is SIRE program, established by OCIMF in 1993, to provide a tank ship risk evaluation tool about ship safety to renters, ship operators, terminal administrators and public authorities and to resolve the issue of sub-standard transportation. It is also a non-profit organization with 70 members and  facilitates 7 / 24 access to inspection reports by database. Beginning from the date the program entered into force, over 180. 000 inspections were performed. In this study, in the context of SIRE, which takes place under Vetting Inspections, a questionnaire form was sent to Turkish firms and data collected for the inspections held between years 2006 - 2014. In this context, 393 inspections held in 16 firms were  reviewed. The inspections were held in 9 MOU, 40 different seaports and made by 14 different inspector firms. The data obtained was analyzed and evaluated by SPSS, the results of the inspections were reviewed and the defects and root causes of the defects were investigated.   As a result of this study, the findings are as followed: - It is determined that, the firms inspected have similar imperfection ratios per inspection, - The detects determined by the inspections; * In general framework, are intensely in Chapter 5 (Safety Management), Chapter 8 (Petroleum, Chemicals, LPG and LNG) and Chapter 11 (Engine and Steering Compartments) * The situation is similar yearly, (In 2007 Chapter 5, in 2010 Chapter 11, in 2011 Chapter 8, in 2012 Chapter 8 and Chapters 11, in 2014 Chapter 8 was not in top 3 grade, in the following years, Chapter 5, Chapters 8 and Chapters 11 were in top 3 grade), however, although imperfection ratio regarding Chapter 13 decreased in recent years, total number of defects are high, * The critics of inspector firms are intensely in Chapters 5, Chapter 8 and Chapter 11, but similar to the issue above, also the critics are dense in Chapter 13. - It was determined that, the ratio of imperfection per inspection has decreased yearly, which shows preparation for the inspections were fulfilled and firms are more conscious of the inspections, - There is not any meaningful difference between defects ratio per inspection according to the regions - Firms detected 3 - 5 defects on average per inspection between 2012 - 2014.
