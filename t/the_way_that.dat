40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I use rhetorical {{analysis and}} draw on articulation theory, primarily {{as it is}} conceived by Stuart Hall, to analyze <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> LGBT social movements constitute and strategically deploy macro-level identities. This research focuses on <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> movement identities [...] from the gay liberation of Stonewall through the current movements for marriage and military service [...] are rhetorically constructed. By tracking national LGBT social-movement organizations through such dynamic changes, my analyses reveal <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> rearticulating <b>the</b> identity of a social movement can help groups change strategies and identifications when activist practices are failing. This scholarship adds to existing research on <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> social movements constitute and reconstitute their shared sense of identity {{in the midst of}} evolving social contexts and also suggests some <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> multimodal rhetorics shape the development of movements...|$|R

5|$|Director Pete Docter {{first began}} writing Up in 2004. The fantasy of a flying house was {{developed}} {{on the idea}} of escaping from life when it becomes too irritating, which stemmed from his difficulty with social situations growing up. Actor and writer Tom McCarthy aided Docter and Bob Peterson in shaping the story for about three months. Docter selected an old man for the main character after drawing a picture of a grumpy old man with smiling balloons. The two men thought that an old man was a good idea for a protagonist because they felt that their experiences and <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> they affect their view of the world was a rich source of humor. Docter was not concerned with an elderly protagonist, stating that children would relate to Carl in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> they relate to their grandparents.|$|E

Matthews was then used just 15 times in 1959–60, as Suart signed Arthur Kaye to take his place, and local lad Steve Hill also vied for the outside-right position. He enjoyed more games in 1960–61, playing 27 league games as the club narrowly avoiding relegation by the odd point.|$|E

Results of comparison with questionnaires showed that the actual dealers classify data in <b>the</b> same <b>way</b> as <b>the</b> virtual dealers in the model does. ...|$|R

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} study, I investigate macro-level ideologies {{about language}} and language learning {{in relation to}} the views and experiences of individual immigrants in order to understand <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> those immigrants are positioned and position themselves within a specific educational and local context. My examination of micro-level processes such as interaction and storytelling illuminates <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> both historical structures and individual subjectivities are mediated by local practices. I examine the situated construction of identity by examining <b>the</b> specific <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> women in this study take up, resist, or transform societal level discourses about language, language learning, or the place of immigrants in U. S. society. Utilizing ethnographic methods such as document collection and analysis, participant observation, interviewing, transcribing, and the close analysis of language in use, I describe and analyze <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> women are positioned by macro-level discourses about language, language learning, and immigration; <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> individual women refugees negotiate dominant discourses about the status and importance of English; and <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> women 2 ̆ 7 s choices with regard to language create particular positions (and thus identities) in relation to dominant-level discourses about language and immigration. I also illuminate the fact that ideologies about language, language learning, and immigration influence and are influenced by the complicated and contradictory nature of individual action and beliefs. In this way, this ethnographic study contributes to the linguistic anthropology of education, studies of immigration and refugee resettlement, and research on the relationship between language learning and identity negotiation/construction. ...|$|R
