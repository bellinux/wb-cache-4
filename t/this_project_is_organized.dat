40|$|Inspired by the lateral-line organ in fish, the {{ultimate}} {{objective of this}} project {{continues to be the}} development of a passive system for AUVs that can detect, classify and locate underwater objects. The lateral line sensory organ in fish enables some species to form three-dimensional maps of their surroundings. The canal subsystem of that organ acts as an array of pressure sensors. Interpreting spatial pressure gradients allows fish to perform a variety of actions from schooling, to tracking prey, to recognizing nearby objects. Similarly, by measuring pressure variations on a vehicle surface, an engineered dense pressure-sensor array could enable the identification and location of obstacles during navigation. Our navigation system is based upon two key technologies: (1) large arrays of very small pressure sensors that can be mounted on the surface of an AUV, and (2) the pressure signal processing algorithms through which object detection, classification and location is implemented. Correspondingly, <b>this</b> <b>project</b> <b>is</b> <b>organized</b> during its early years around the development of these two key technologies...|$|E

40|$|This project opens {{space for}} {{looking at the world}} in a musical way where “jamming” with music through playing and {{listening}} to it helps one resist a more standardized and dualistic way of seeing the world. Instead of having a traditional dissertation, <b>this</b> <b>project</b> <b>is</b> <b>organized</b> like a record album where each chapter is a Track that contains an original song that parallels and plays off the subject matter being discussed to make a more encompassing, multidimensional, holistic, improvisational, and critical statement as the songs and riffs move along together to tell why an arts-based musical way of being can be a choice and alternative in our lives. A riff, though a musical phrase played by a musician, is considered an idea from whoever is being cited to add to the flow of the conversation unfolding in each Track. Track 1 sets the stage for jamming as a curriculum of resistance through my personal experiences being part of “isness ” and “shared intuitive headspaces ” as each concept is explained. This sentiment is furthered in Track 2, which sheds light on the current state of education not making room for an arts-based musical way of seeing the world. Track 3 includes my own narrative of learning how to pla...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is {{increasing}} the research carried out by Sylvain Marchand, researcher of the LaBRI (Laboratoire Bordelais de Recherche en Informatique), about the RetroSpat System. RetroSpat stands for "Retroactive Spatializer" {{and it is a}} free software project for the spatialization of sounds represented in the spectral domain. This system is intended to be a spatializer with perceptive feedback. More precisely, RetroSpat can guess positions of physical sound sources (e. g. loudspeakers) from binaural inputs, and can then output multichannel signals to the loudspeakers while controlling the spatial location of virtual sound sources. So, the project will be based practically on improving the localization method {{as a result of the}} localization corresponding to a sound source, changing the software architecture to merge the localization and spatialization parts and on an improvement of the graphical user interface. <b>This</b> <b>project</b> <b>is</b> <b>organized</b> as follows. In the first section is presented some history of acousmatic music. Next a description of the model in Section 2 is done including the spatialization and localization methods.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is the {{development}} of technologies to enhance the performance of computing systems through the combined use of hardware and software strategies. The project is composed of a set of interacting research lines that can be classified in two main areas: architecture and design of hardware components, on the one hand, and algorithm tuning on new computing platforms, on the other. With regard to the first area, the project explores different approaches to improve the costperformance-power tradeoffs in the conception of both general purpose processors, and special-purpose systems, with special attention to the embedded systems domain. The improvement of design methodologies to generate special purpose hardware, when needed, is also considered. In the area of algorithm-platform tuning, the goal {{is the development of}} algorithms and methodologies that efficiently exploit the computational resources of current computing platforms. We focus on the development of new algorithms that exploit locality along the different levels of the computing system. We intend to export the results of this research into software libraries that include the proposed optimizations and to validate them on high challenge applications over several fields of interest. From the methodological point of view, <b>this</b> <b>project</b> <b>is</b> <b>organized</b> in four main research lines, as follows: a) algorithms, architectures, and applications, b) processors and optimization, c) embedded systems design, and d) asynchronous systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{process of}} {{designing}} the control strategy for mobile robots may {{turn into a}} difficult task as can appear difficult dynamisms on a mechanical an electronic level {{that are difficult to}} model and, besides, its testing can mean {{a lot of time and}} high costs. In this project, it is introduced a simulator environment based on Gazebo to fulfil the need of implementing robot behaviours and control algorithms in a more efficient and productive way. Gazebo is one amongst several software platforms for simulation and robot control. It has an open source program distributed by Apache 2. 0 and is being used widely by the robotics community. It has an easy-going interface, a learn-by-doing program and a growing community. Its easy programming interface has been very useful for most of the project development, which has been focused on the implementation of a line follower robot developed by other ETSEIB student within their Final Grade Project. The challenge has been to reproduce in a virtual level the vehicle navigation and performance and the environment conditions. For this reason, has been required a global vision of the robot’s functionality. <b>This</b> <b>project</b> <b>is</b> <b>organized</b> with a first part of Gazebo software description, followed by the robot implementation to the simulator, the control design and architecture, and a final part with the experimental results of the simulation...|$|E
40|$|This project {{generates a}} vga signal and {{displays}} {{a set of}} monochrome bars on a monitor. The project uses the vga circuit design provided in Jan Gray’s XSOC project (see references). Basically is generates the correct timing signals needed and shifts through a 16 -bit word one bit at a time (monochrome) for pixel information. This project demonstrates how to mix both VHDL and Verilog code together. The XStend board is not required in this project. The XSA- 100 board frequency must be set to 12. 5 MHz! Note: The vga circuit as provided in the XSOC project has a bug. It reads 576 x 455 bits of data for image display, but only displays 560 x 455.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 60 - 62). My research looks at how the institution of the home shaped the British colonial project. Colonialism is rooted in the conflict of national identity. Colonial subjects {{in the presence of a}} politically threatening "Other" combatted opposition to their national identities in various ways - British citizens attempted to re-create England in India and Indian citizens attempted to defend their nationality against British invasion. Current research in postcolonial studies has focused on the symbolic value of the home within the colonial project. My thesis extends current research by exploring the tangible elements of domestic space and the material underpinnings of how the idea of "home" is tied to "nation. " <b>This</b> <b>project</b> <b>is</b> <b>organized</b> around four significant spaces in colonial homes: the courtyard, the drawing room, the verandah, and the zenana, all of which were culturally significant and powerful within the colonial context. Home management guides and domestic manuals written for English settlers moving to India provide a wealth of knowledge about the expectations associated with establishing a home in India. Literary sources address these four spaces by depicting the lived experience and the individual response of colonial characters. Integrating these two bodies of resources, my research looks at how the physical elements of the home helped to determine colonial and national identity. Furthermore, my project looks at how colonial subjects used their homes in methodological ways to portray and reaffirm their national identities...|$|E
40|$|My dissertation, "The People's Republic of Capitalism: The Making of the New Middle Class in Post-Socialist China, 1978 -Present" {{draws on}} a range of visual {{cultural}} forms - cinema, documentary, and fashion - to track the cultural dimension of the emergence of the new middle class subject in China's encounter with global capitalism. Through cultural studies methodologies and critical theoretical practices, I explore the massive reorganization of national subjectivity that has accompanied the economic reforms since 1978. How, I ask, has the middle class replaced the proletariat as the dominant subject of Chinese history? What are the competing social forces that contribute to the making of the new middle class subject, and how do they operate? By considering these questions in terms of the cultural cultivation of new sensibilities as much as identities, I trace China's changing social formations through the realm of cultural productions. <b>This</b> <b>project</b> <b>is</b> <b>organized</b> into three parts, each of which attends to a particular constellation of middle class subjectivities and ideologies. In Part I (Introduction and Chapter 1), I explore how the Chinese middle class subject is shaped by historical, political-economic, and cultural forces. I show that the new social actor is structurally dependent on the national and transnational bourgeoisie and the post-socialist party-state. In Part II (Chapters 2 - 5), I focus on the relationship among fashion, media, and Chinese consumer culture in the socialist and post-socialist eras. By engaging with films such as Xie Tieli's Never Forget (1964), Huang Zumo's Romance on Lushan (1980), Qi Xingjia's Red Dress is in Fashion (1984), and Jia Zhangke's The World (2004) and Useless (2007), I suggest that the representation of fashion and consumption in Chinese cinema, documentary, and new media is a privileged site for deciphering otherwise imperceptible meanings of class, ideology, and history {{in the formation of the}} Chinese middle class subject. In Part III (Chapter 6), I attend to the repressed underside of Chinese consumer culture: rubbish. This project reorients our understanding of socialist and post-socialist China, seeing them as underpinned by the contradictions emblematized in the Chinese middle class. Dissertatio...|$|E

40|$|The {{catalogue}} of Mesozoic radiolarian genera is {{a revision of}} all described genera with re-illustration of their type species. <b>This</b> <b>project</b> <b>was</b> <b>organized</b> {{under the auspices of}} the International Association of Radiolarian Paleontologists (Inter-Rad), and was carried out by the Mesozoic Working Group. This is the second of two contributions, this one devoted to the Jurassic-Cretaceous period. It contains 581 genera with re-illustration of their type species. This part shares 30 genera in common with the Triassic catalogue, most of which arose in the Carnian, Norian and Rhaetian. The sharp difference manifested between the Triassic fauna and the Jurassic-Cretaceous fauna is so evident that it justifies two independent catalogues. A comparable division between the Jurassic and Cretaceous could not be justified however, because of the similarity of the fauna, and by the greater number of genera crossing the Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary which is three times that for the Triassic-Jurassic boundary. A distinct characteristic of Jurassic-Cretaceous genera is the high number of nomina dubia (up to 131), contrary to the low number in the Triassic interval. This reflects, in part, the influence of Haeckelian taxonomy in earlier research on Jurassic-Cretaceous faunas prior to the application of SEM techniques. The Mesozoic Working Group has carefully reviewed and re-examined the taxonomy of all available genera, their family assignment and stratigraphic ranges. Following careful comparisons, 91 genera were declared as synonyms. The review has noted 26 homonyms which were duly notified to their corresponding authors, and were corrected previous to the publication of this catalogue. In spite of this effort, unfortunately nine homonyms still remain. Two invalid nominal genera, and two nomina nuda are also reported. The systematic revisions have validated 341 genera for the Jurassic-Cretaceous interval. At the end of this catalogue 24 additional are resented as support for those genera having a poor photographs p original illustration of the type species...|$|R
