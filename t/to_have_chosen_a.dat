2500|$|The {{girls are}} given an English lesson by trainer Lee Si-won through imitating and {{watching}} scenes of rapper Jessi on Unpretty Rapstar. Through a video recording, Jang Keun-suk then announces {{the beginning of}} the next evaluation prior to the second round of eliminations, meaning that all 61 girls that have survived so far will continue to practice for the performances, but not all of them may get to perform. The evaluation is revealed to be a concept evaluation, and the girls are given five original songs to choose from - EDM song [...] "24 Hours" [...] (produced by DJ Koo and Maximite, who previously produced [...] "Pick Me"), girl crush pop song [...] "Fingertips" [...] (produced by Ryan Jhun), hip hop song [...] "Don't Matter" [...] (produced by San E), trap pop song [...] "Yum-Yum" [...] (produced by iDR), and girlish pop song [...] "In the Same Place"(produced by B1A4's Jin-young) - with the winning team to receive a benefit of 150,000 votes. The girls choose their teams based on their category and individual ranking from the last evaluation. However, as only 14 people can be on one team (twice the amount that will be on the team after the elimination occurs), the first girl <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>a</b> concept is given the right to kick out any extras, thus forcing them to choose another song. After practicing for the new songs, the girls undergo the second elimination, beginning with rank 34 up to 1, with Kim Se-jeong once again taking first place. Jang Keun-suk then announces the 35th and last trainee, SS Entertainment's Lee Su-hyun, who was saved from elimination.|$|E
2500|$|The KF-X {{program is}} being accelerated, with {{required}} operational capabilities {{to be confirmed}} by mid-July 2014, and bidding to start as early as one month later. [...] The ADD and ROKAF appeared <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>a</b> double-engine airframe for greater payload, mobility, thrust, and safety; proponents for a single-engine design maintain {{that it would be}} cheaper, more appealing for export, and that modern engine technologies make engine failure incidents rare. [...] Efforts to accelerate the program may be to address the [...] "air security vacuum" [...] that would occur by 2019, when all F-4s and F-5s would be retired and leave the Air Force 100 planes short. The Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) met that month and officially set specifications and a schedule for the KF-X. [...] The KF-X will be equipped with two engines to address future operational needs and keep up with neighboring countries’ aircraft development trends. [...] Heated debates from KIDA, KAI, and the Korea Defense and Security Forum over the higher costs of developing a twin-engine fighter, the potential difficulty in selling it abroad, and that higher costs would block creation of indigenous avionics and force the adoption of foreign systems were countered by Air Force and ADD arguments that Indonesian support will lower costs during mass production, most technologies were already created independently, and that a larger aircraft has more room for upgrades. [...] The initial design is to be a 4.5 generation fighter with a + payload, with the KF-X Block 2 having an internal weapons bay, and the Block 3 having stealth features comparable to the F-35 Lightning II or B-2 Spirit. [...] Initial operating capability (IOC) is scheduled for 2025, two years later than previously expected.|$|E

60|$|It {{would indeed}} have been {{impossible}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>a</b> worse time for the expedition but, doubtless, the government of India thought chiefly of the necessity for forcing the Burmese {{to stand on the}} defensive, and of so preventing the invasion of India by a vast army. Unquestionably, too, they believed that the occupation of Rangoon, and the stoppage of all trade, would show the court of Ava that they had embarked in a struggle with no contemptible foe; and would be glad to abate their pretensions, and to agree to fair terms of peace.|$|E

5000|$|It {{has been}} widely claimed that this episode was {{inspired}} by real events surrounding Ireland's selection of its entry for the 1994 Eurovision Song Contest.Faced with the daunting (and financially crippling) task of hosting its third consecutive Eurovision, RTÉ were said <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>an</b> inferior quality song (Paul Harrington & Charlie McGettigan's [...] "Rock 'n' Roll Kids") over vastly superior ones {{in order to prevent}} the possibility of an unwanted third victory.

She had been quite, quite sure, when {{she came into the}} house; but she was more than sure now. At every word that had been spoken she had thought of herself and of him. Would he not have known how <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>a</b> fit companion,--only for this great misfortune? And would she have been so much inferior to Miss Forrester? Would he have thought her inferior to any one? Would he not have preferred her to any other female whom the world had at the present moment produced? Oh, the pity of it; the pity of it! ...|$|E
60|$|It {{would have}} been hard, therefore, for Browning <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>a</b> better example for his study of {{intellectual}} egotism than Paracelsus. Modern life accuses the mediæval tradition of crushing the intellect; Browning, with a truer instinct, accuses that tradition of over-glorifying it. There is, however, another and even more important deduction to be made from the moral of Paracelsus. The usual accusation against Browning {{is that he was}} consumed with logic; that he thought all subjects to be the proper pabulum of intellectual disquisition; that he gloried chiefly in his own power of plucking knots to pieces and rending fallacies in two; and that to this method he sacrificed deliberately, and with complete self-complacency, the element of poetry and sentiment. To people who imagine Browning to have been this frigid believer in the intellect there is only one answer necessary or sufficient. It {{is the fact that he}} wrote a play designed to destroy the whole of this intellectualist fallacy at the age of twenty-three.|$|E
60|$|From Sarras {{the army}} seemed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>a</b> double line of advance. The railway {{reconstruction}} followed the old track {{which had been}} prepared through the desert in 1885. The convoy route wound along by the river. Both were protected from attack. The 7th Egyptians guarded Railhead, while the chain of small posts secured the road by the Nile to Akasha. The advanced base grew during the months of April and May into a strong position. Only once did the Arabs venture to approach within artillery range. A small body of horse and camel men made a sort of haphazard reconnaissance, and, being seen from the outpost line, were fired on at a great distance by a field-gun. They fell back immediately, but {{it was believed that}} the range was too great for the projectile to have harmed them; and it was not until two days later that the discovery on the spot of a swollen, blistering corpse, clad in bright jibba, apprised the delighted gunners of the effect of their fire. Warned by this lucky shot the Dervishes came no more, or came unseen.|$|E

60|$|Of, Justinian, and his work, I am {{not able}} myself to form any opinion--and it is, I think, {{unnecessary}} {{for students of}} history to form any, until {{they are able to}} estimate clearly the benefits, and mischief, of the civil law of Europe in its present state. But to Clovis, Theodoric, and St. Benedict, without any question, we owe more than any English historian has yet ascribed,--and they are easily held in mind together, for Clovis ascended the Frank throne in the year of St. Benedict's birth, 481. Theodoric fought the battle of Verona, and founded the Ostrogothic Kingdom in Italy twelve years later, in 493, and thereupon married the sister of Clovis. That marriage is always passed in a casual sentence, as if a merely political one, and while page after page is spent in following the alternations of furious crime and fatal chance, in the contests between Fredegonde and Brunehaut, no historian ever considers whether the great Ostrogoth who wore in the battle of Verona the dress which his mother had woven for him, was likely <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>a</b> wife without love!--or how far the perfectness, justice, and temperate wisdom of every ordinance of his reign was owing to the sympathy and counsel of his Frankish queen.|$|E
60|$|This {{extent of}} {{intervention}} {{will at least}} abolish two or three salient hardships and evils of the civilised life. It will abolish the hardship {{of the majority of}} widows, who on earth are poor and encumbered exactly in proportion as they have discharged the chief distinctive duty of a woman, and miserable, just in proportion as their standard of life and of education is high. It will abolish the hardship of those who do not now marry on account of poverty, or who do not dare to have children. The fear that often turns a woman from a beautiful to a mercenary marriage will vanish from life. In Utopia a career of wholesome motherhood would be, under such conditions as I have suggested, the normal and remunerative calling for a woman, and a capable woman who has borne, bred, and begun the education of eight or nine well-built, intelligent, and successful sons and daughters would be an extremely prosperous woman, quite irrespective of the economic fortunes of the man she has married. She would need to be an exceptional woman, and she would need <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>a</b> man at least a little above the average as her partner in life. But his death, or misbehaviour, or misfortunes would not ruin her.|$|E

5000|$|William M. Rainach, a {{state senator}} from Claiborne Parish who was a {{delegate}} to the 1960 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, agreed with Smallenberger. In Rainach's words, [...] "the Republican platform {{is not quite as}} bad" [...] as that offered by the Kennedy/Johnson forces. Rainach said that the influence of Rockefeller had reduced the practical usefulness of the Republican Party to southern conservatives. Rainach added that if unpledged electors had gained sufficient support across the South, as they did in Mississippi and Alabama, he would have urged negotiations among the electors themselves, rather than having the U.S. House of Representatives choose the president with one vote per state in event of a deadlock in the electoral college. Were the House <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>a</b> president in 1961, Kennedy would have been an automatic winner because the majority of state delegations were then in Democrat hands, Rainach said.|$|E
5000|$|Research {{on the use}} of {{deception}} in online dating has shown that people are generally truthful about themselves with the exception of physical attributes to appear more attractive. [...] According to the Scientific American, “nine out of ten online daters will fib about their height, weight, or age” such that men were more likely to lie about height while women were more likely to lie about weight. In a study conducted by Toma and Hancock, “less attractive people were found to be more likely <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>a</b> profile picture in which they were significantly more attractive than they were in everyday life”. Both genders used this strategy in online dating profiles, but women more so than men. Additionally, less attractive people {{were more likely to have}} “lied about objective measures of physical attractiveness such as height and weight”. In general, men are more likely to lie on dating profiles the one exception being that women are more likely to lie about weight.|$|E
