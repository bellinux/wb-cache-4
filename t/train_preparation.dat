50|$|To {{minimize}} the down time of track during a track renewal project, a track renewal train {{is used to}} automate most of the required process. Prior {{to the arrival of}} the track renewal <b>train,</b> <b>preparation</b> tasks must be completed. In some cases, the old rail needs to be cut into smaller segments and joined with fishplates. The rail fastening system may need to be released prior to its arrival.|$|E
50|$|Island {{platforms}} are {{not ideal}} for vertical passenger flow. Side platforms allow direct access from stationhouse through fare control. Through track serves the stationhouse at major stations, where most expresses stop. Middle bypass tracks {{are available for}} switching, temporary equipment storage, <b>train</b> <b>preparation,</b> and allows passenger trains to pass freights.Stationhouses are usually on the northbound side (up direction, to Taipei), where originating passengers are voluminous. At minor stations, mainline serves the island platform; locals serve the stationhouse while waiting for overtaking expresses.|$|E
50|$|The {{accident}} investigation revealed: An engine replacement at the previous stop, Berlin-Grünau, {{in the middle}} of the night, required testing of the brakes. But several errors (lack of attention, misperception, deficient communication) by the driver and the assigned <b>train</b> <b>preparation</b> technician occurred. The first error, caused by the driver, was to not connect the main brake's hoses and to not open the respective valves after coupling the engine to the first wagon. Filling the brake system by the engine happened far too fast, without the driver noticing. The irresponsive, still activated brakes were misdiagnosed by the technician (who had to service three trains at the same time) to have a pressure higher than what the engine supplied. He did not report this to the driver, but reset the brakes by emptying their air reservoirs. The actual brake test never happened, but the driver later claimed to have received a positive confirmation. The technician, in turn, did not abort the departure of the train. As the result, the train left with all brakes dysfunctional, except the ones of the engine. This emerged as late as the train had to slow down before entering Elsterwerda station.|$|E

50|$|Equipment carried {{aboard the}} brake van, {{which had to}} be checked by the guard before the train's departure, {{consisted}} of a shunting pole (a wooden pole about 6 feet long with a twisted hook on the end which was used to couple and uncouple 3-link and instanter couplings without the guard having to position himself dangerously in between the vehicles), a brake stick (imagine a square ended baseball bat; it was used to lever down the handbrakes of wagons by placing it under the solebar and applying downward pressure), paraffin for the lamps, usually in an old milk bottle, and two pairs of track circuit clips (these are clips that fit over the rail and are connected by a length of wire more than 4 feet 8 and a half inches long; they are clipped over both rails of a track-circuited line so as to short circuit the track and indicate to the signalman that a train is occupying that section; they would be used {{in the event of an}} accident in which other running lines were fouled and trains on them had to be stopped as a matter of great urgency). He would also check that the tail and side lamps were carried, filled, trimmed, and lit at night, during fog or falling snow, or if the train is to run through any tunnel in which lamps are required. These checks were part of the guard's <b>train</b> <b>preparation</b> duties, and his responsibility. The guard would, also at this time, ensure that the van carried coal and kindling to light the stove fire, even in summer if the train was to be relieved by another crew who might have to work into the cool of evening or night. It was common for guards to carry old newspapers with which to stop up any draughts that made their presence felt at speed; partly fitted freight trains might run up to 60 mph.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{paper is}} focused on the {{introduction}} of an ID card based security system inside a railway operator business field, in order to have an improvement in term of performance and quality level of the offered services. The project takes into consideration the “Technical Recommendation” elaborated by UNIFE cab experts, CER and UIC expert team, which provides a framework for the functionalities and the design of ID-cards and ID-card readers. All the persons, part of the railway operator business field, have their own ID card, which contains a personal profile based on the role, on the expertise and on the assigned mission. By means of ID card, realized with the technology state of the art, it is possible to address the following items:Identification: only authorized persons may have access to a well defined area and/or train part. Operation: pre-defined and planned actions, like the ones needed for a <b>train</b> <b>preparation</b> before the commercial service, can be automatically executed. Monitoring: from the headquarter it is possible to know who is doing what and where. Reporting: a digitally signed report can be automatically done, reducing the paper consumption. Analysis: all the events, both on the rolling stock fleet and on the base station are logged and remain availablefor any traceability check and for mission tag profile upgrading or changes. The ID based security system could be an important tool to support the railway operation management to increase the efficiency of the delivered services with security improvement...|$|E
