The corrosion inhibition efficiency at a specific temperature of a particular blend increases on increasing the TOP concentration from 30 ppm to 150 ppm.

40|$|In {{the present}} work the {{influence}} of the addition of some dispersing agents employed for maximizing the solid loading of calcium carbonate suspensions has been investigated. Three commercial deflocculants were used: <b>trisodium</b> <b>orthophosphate,</b> sodium tripolyphosphate and sodium polyphosphate, Calcium carbonate aqueous suspensions were prepared at various solid volume fractions (0. 270 to 0. 382). Rheological tests were carried out at 25 °C by using the rate controlled coaxial cylinder viscometer Rotovisko-Haake 20, system M 5 -osc., measuring device MV 1 P with serrated surfaces. The tests were performed under both continuous and oscillatory flow conditions. All the suspensions prepared without deflocculant show a rheological behavior of the shearthinning type; good correlations between relative viscosity and shear rate data were found by applying the Quemada model. The application of rheological techniques permitted to evaluate the efficiency of the dispersing agents employed. The sodium polyphosphate proved to be the most effective for the calcium carbonate slurries studied; the highest efficiency of polyphosphate can be explained {{on the basis of its}} oligomeric nature...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work is to study the effect of electrical process Parameters (duty cycle and frequency) on morphological, structural, and in-vitro corrosion characteristics of oxide films formed on zirconium by plasma electrolytic oxidation in an electrolyte system consisting of 5 g/L of <b>trisodium</b> <b>orthophosphate.</b> The oxide films fabricated on zirconium by systematically varying the duty cycle and frequency are characterized for its phase composition, surface morphology, chemical composition, roughness, wettability, surface energy, scratch resistance, corrosion resistance, apatite forming ability and osteoblast cell adhesion. X-ray diffraction pattern of all the oxide films showed the predominance of m-ZrO 2 phase. Dense and uniform films with thickness varying from 9 to 15 mu m and roughness {{in the range of}} 0. 62 to 1. 03 mu m are formed. Porosity of oxide films is found to be increased with an increase infrequency. The water contact angle results demonstrated that the oxide films exhibited similar hydrophilicity to zirconium substrate. All oxide films showed improved corrosion resistance, as indicated by far lower corrosion current density and passive corrosion potential compared to the zirconium substrate in simulated body fluid environment, and among the four different combinations of duty cycle and frequency employed in the present study, the oxide film formed at 95 % duty cycle and 50 Hz frequency (HDLF film) showed superior pitting corrosion resistance, which can be attributed to its pore free morpholOgy. Scratch test results showed that the HDLF oxide film adhered firmly to the substrate by developing a notable scratch resistance at 19. 5 +/- 1. 2. N. Besides the best corrosion resistance and scratch retistance, the HDLF film also showed good apatite forming ability and osteo sarcoma cell adhesion on its surface. The HDLF oxide film on zirconium with superior surface characteristics is believed to be useful for various types of implants in the dental and orthopedic fields. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) {{spectra of}} liquids contain {{a wealth of}} {{quantitative}} information that may be derived, for instance, from chemical shifts and spin-spin couplings. The available information depends on the incoherent rapid molecular motion that causes complicating effects present in the solid state to average to zero. Whereas liquid state NMR spectra show narrow lines, the corresponding NMR spectra from the solid state are normally composed of exceedingly broad resonance lines due to highly restricted molecular motion. It is, therefore, difficult to obtain directly as detailed information from the spectra of solids as from those derived from the liquid state. Studies on a new technique (SINNMR, the sonically induced narrowing of the NMR spectra of solids) to remove line broadening effects in the NMR spectra of the solid state are reported within this thesis. SINNMR involves narrowing the NMR absorptions from solid particles by irradiating them with ultrasound when they are suspended in a support liquid. It is proposed that ultrasound induces incoherent motion of the suspended particles, producing motional characteristics of the particles {{similar to those of}} rather large molecules. The first report of apparently successful experiments involving SINNMR[1] emphasised both the irreproducibility of the technique and the uncertainty regarding its true origin. If SINNMR can be made reproducible and the effect definitively attributed to the sonically induced incoherent motional averaging of particles, the technique could offer a simple alternative to the now classical magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR[2] and the recently reported dynamic angle spinning (DAS) [3] and double rotation (DOR) [4] techniques. Evidence is presented in this thesis to support the proposal that ultrasound may be used to narrow the NMR spectral resonances from solids by inducing incoherent motion of particles suspended in support liquids and, additionally, for some solids, by inducing rotational motion of molecular constituents in the lattices of solids. Successful SINNMR line narrowing using 20 kHz ultrasound is reported for a variety of samples: including <b>trisodium</b> <b>orthophosphate,</b> polytetrafluoroethylene and aluminium alloys. Investigations of SINNMR line narrowing in trisodium phosphate have revealed the relationship between ultrasonic power, particle size and support liquid density for the production of optimum SINNMR conditions. It is also proposed that the incoherent motion of particles induced by 20 kHz ultrasound can originate from interactions between acoustically induced cavitation microjets and particles...|$|E
