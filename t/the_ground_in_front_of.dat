5|$|After the Lancastrians {{had ceased}} loosing their arrows, Fauconberg ordered his archers {{to step forward}} again to shoot. When they had {{exhausted}} their ammunition, the Yorkists plucked arrows off <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> them—arrows loosed by their foes—and continued loosing. Coming under attack without any effective response of its own, the Lancastrian army moved from its position to engage the Yorkists in close combat. Seeing the advancing mass of men, the Yorkist archers shot a few more volleys before retreating behind their ranks of men-at-arms, leaving thousands of arrows in the ground to hinder the Lancastrian attack.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{conflicting}} {{conclusions of the}} first two, a third post-mortem was conducted on 22 April by Kenneth Shorrock {{on behalf of the}} Metropolitan police, and Ben Swift on behalf of Simon Harwood. Shorrock and Swift agreed with the results of the second autopsy. The Met's point of contact for Tomlinson's death, Detective Inspector Eddie Hall, told the pathologists before the final post-mortem that Tomlinson had fallen to <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> a police van earlier in the evening, although {{there was no evidence that}} this had happened. The IPCC ruled in May 2011 that Hall had been reckless in making this claim, but had not intended to mislead.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, Kooijman, et al., {{published}} an article in Science showing that neither gyroscopic effects nor so-called caster effects due to trail are necessary for a bike to balance itself. They designed a two-mass-skate bicycle that the equations of motion predict is self-stable even with negative trail, the front wheel contacts <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the steering axis, and with counter-rotating wheels to cancel any gyroscopic effects. Then they constructed a physical model to validate that prediction. This may require {{some of the details}} provided below about steering geometry or stability to be re-evaluated. Bicycle dynamics was named 26 of Discovers 100 top stories of 2011.|$|E
5|$|In May 2011 the IPCC {{released}} three reports into Tomlinson's death, written between April 2010 and May 2011. The main report contained material revealed {{during the}} inquest. The third report detailed an allegation from Tomlinson's family {{that the police}} had offered misleading information to the pathologists before the third autopsy on 22 April 2009. The Met's point of contact for Tomlinson's death, Detective Inspector Eddie Hall, had told the pathologists that Tomlinson had fallen to <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> a police van earlier in the evening, although there was no evidence to support this. The IPCC ruled that Hall had been reckless in making this claim, but had not intended to mislead the pathologists.|$|E
5|$|The arch is {{constructed}} from local stone and was originally {{topped by a}} bronze chariot pulled by six horses. Statues of nymphs poured water into carved marble basins {{at the foot of}} the arch. Caracalla and Julia Domna were represented on medallion busts, though these have been defaced. The monument was reconstructed by the French between 1930–34. However, the restoration is incomplete and of disputed accuracy. The inscription on the top of the arch was reconstructed from the fragments noticed by Windus in 1722, which had been scattered on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the arch.|$|E

5|$|Boone informs Locke he {{is tired}} of lying, and wants to tell Shannon about the hatch. Locke knocks him {{unconscious}} with the handle of his knife, and Boone awakes to find himself tied up. Locke applies a strange paste on Boone's head wound and leaves a knife embedded in <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> Boone so he'll be able to free himself. Locke explains {{that he will be}} able to reach it once he is properly motivated. After several unsuccessful attempts to do so, Boone hears Shannon's screams and the sounds of the 'monster' approaching. This is the impetus he needs, and after a short struggle, and in excruciating pain, he is finally able to reach the weapon. He then frees himself and searches for his sister.|$|E
5|$|Resuming their advance, the Australians were {{supported}} by three squadrons of Corsairs from the Royal New Zealand Air Force—Nos. 14, 22 and 26 Squadrons—which bombed and strafed <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the advancing infantry, {{as well as a}} creeping barrage of artillery and mortar fire. With such strong support the Japanese offered little resistance and over the course of two days the 24th Infantry Battalion covered almost a third of the distance to the Hongorai, for just one man wounded. Further progress was made over the next week, but on 4 May the advance was slowed when they encountered a roadblock defended by a field gun along with a machine gun, mines and other improvised explosive devices. After this, the 15th Brigade's engineer support were called upon to regularly carry out route clearance and proving operations as the Japanese became increasingly desperate to destroy the Australian armour, {{to the extent that they}} were prepared to sacrifice an artillery piece in order to lure the Australian tanks into a trap where they could be destroyed by mines. The Japanese began to adapt their tactics in other ways also. To negate the effectiveness of the Australian tanks, the Japanese began to position themselves off the roads, forcing the infantry to fight without their armoured support. Additionally, the Japanese began to concentrate their artillery with increasing accuracy upon the advancing infantry, which they kept under constant observation and fire.|$|E
