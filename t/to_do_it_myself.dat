60|$|There is, of course, a {{much easier}} way {{than any of}} these. I almost hate to tell this, because I want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>myself.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "From affection!" [...] she returned, {{with the}} deepest derision. [...] "Well, I rather think I shall have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>myself</b> if I want it done from affection! But I suppose you think I ought <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>myself,</b> as the Altrurian ladies do! I {{can tell you}} that in America it would be {{impossible}} for a lady to do her own work, and there are no intelligence-offices where you can find girls that want to work for love. It's as broad as it's long." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Looking {{at him as}} if {{she wanted}} to pot at him with a rifle. I should like <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>myself.</b> What were you saying when he came up?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Lowell Weicker {{was said}} to be {{considering}} a rematch against Senator Joe Lieberman in the 2006 election cycle. He objected to Lieberman's support for the Iraq War and noted in a New York Times article published on December 6, 2005, [...] "If he's out there scot-free and nobody will <b>do</b> <b>it</b> against Senator Lieberman, I'd have to give serious thought <b>to</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>myself,</b> and I don't want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just as you please," [...] said Mr. Thumble. [...] "Only it's rather hard lines <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> all <b>myself</b> {{after coming}} {{all the way}} from Barchester this morning." [...] To this Mr. Crawley condescended to make no reply whatever.|$|R
60|$|SIR WILLIAM. In {{the whole}} {{course of our}} married life, Dorothy, I've never known you set {{yourself}} up against me. I resent this, I warn you--I resent it. Send the girl <b>to</b> me. I'll <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>myself.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know how}} {{it was that he}} could speak--I have never heard either of them say a word before, nor have I been able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>myself</b> until now." ...|$|E
6000|$|I must {{add that}} Charles Lloyd must 'furnish' his own bed-room. It {{is not in}} my power <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>myself</b> without running into debt; from which may heaven amid its most angry dispensations {{preserve}} me! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course not," [...] said I. [...] "Now that I see how it's done, I'm going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>myself.</b> Jonas will mix his {{feed and}} I {{will give it}} to him. He looks sleepy now. Shall I take him upstairs and lay him on our bed?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Initially Eldritch {{worked with}} an unknown {{producer}}: [...] "I had a producer but I had to fire him. That's why I had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> all by <b>myself</b> which was quite demanding." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Something of the kind, though I <b>did</b> {{not expect}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> all <b>myself.</b> While I {{was sure the}} thing was feasible, the fact that I was, or so I felt, taking a little share in {{bringing}} it about was sufficient for me. Now, however, I am not quite so sure on any point as I used to be, which is why I often envy Ingleby." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come {{in and see}} the house," [...] said Bertha, in brusque invitation. [...] "It isn't ship-shape yet. I wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> all <b>myself,</b> but I find it's a big {{proposition}} to go up against. It sure is. But I like it. I'd {{like nothing}} better than running a big hotel--not too big, but just big enough. I tell the Captain that when our mines 'pinch out' I'll go to Denver and start a hotel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now--you'll {{do it for}} me, won't you, dear mistress?' said Anna eagerly. 'And you'll do {{it as well as}} ever you can, please? Because I couldn't bear him {{to think}} I am not able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>myself.</b> I should sink into the earth with shame if he knew that!' ...|$|E
60|$|I arose {{and paced}} the floor. There was entirely too much force in this man's arguments, but, {{although}} I could not immediately answer him, his cool determination to persevere in his iniquitous designs so angered me that I {{declared that he}} should be punished if I had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>myself.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said he, quickly, [...] "don't you do that. If {{the crazy}} {{idea is to}} be {{mentioned}} to her at all, I want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>myself,</b> and in my own way. I will go to her now. I have had my talk with you, and I must have one with her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Feel!" [...] {{echoed the}} hunter, [...] "it felt as bad, or wuss, nor {{the time that}} grizzly bar up the Yellowstone River got his claws into the small o' my back--only I hadn't {{you to help me}} out o' the {{difficulty}} this time. I had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> all <b>myself,</b> Jacob, and hard work it was, I tell 'ee, boy. Hows'ever, it's all over now, an' we're to be spliced this evenin'." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{is their}} head man," [...] the officer interpreted; [...] "he is the boy's father, {{and says that}} his life is now yours, {{and that he is}} ready to give it at any time. This is a very gallant business, sergeant, and I wish I had the pluck <b>to</b> have <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>myself.</b> I shall, of course, send in a report about your conduct. Now come to my tent. I can let you have a shirt and pair of {{trousers}} while yours are being dried." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If the births {{were all}} over for good, and all to-day; and the deaths were all to begin to come off to-morrow; I don't see why it should {{interest}} me, till I {{thought it was a}} coming to my turn," [...] grumbled Tetterby. [...] "As <b>to</b> marriages, I've <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>myself.</b> I know quite enough about THEM." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{should think}} so,” the sailor said warmly. “It {{was a fine}} thing to do, and I would be glad <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>myself.</b> Stick to him, lad, {{as long as he}} will let you. I fancy, from the way he speaks and his manner, that he will mount up above you, but never you mind that.” ...|$|E
60|$|He {{was always}} busy; kept the rooms tidied up, the boots polished, the clothes brushed, the wash-basin full of clean water, my dress clothes laid out {{and ready for}} the lecture-hall an hour ahead of time; and he dressed me from head to heel {{in spite of my}} {{determination}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>myself,</b> according to my lifelong custom.|$|E
6000|$|... "Make {{a bonfire}} of 'em {{directly}} you get home. I meant <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>myself.</b> I can't think what possessed me ever to collect them. I {{have only a}} few professional hand-books now, and am quite a practical man. I am in hopes of having some good news to tell you soon, and then do you think you could--come to me again?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{want any}} change. Besides, {{the place is}} intolerable; and one can't move along the roads. I shall go out in a boat, as I used <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and manage <b>it</b> <b>myself.</b> One can get a few hours every day in that way instead of striving in a damnable hotel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon--that's exactly what I <b>do</b> put <b>it</b> on for. It's exactly {{the thing that}} I'm reduced <b>to</b> <b>doing</b> for <b>myself.</b> <b>It</b> seems <b>to</b> rescue a little, you see, from the wreck of hopes and ambitions, the refuse-heap of disappointments and failures, my one presentable little scrap of an identity." ...|$|R
5000|$|On 11 August 2008, de la Rocha {{spoke to}} the Los Angeles Times about the new project, his first {{interview}} in over eight years. He revealed that a full-length album was scheduled for an Autumn 2008 release, and stated that they [...] "want to play shows and be a band {{and go out and}} start some noise". He also mentions adding members to the group, revealing [...] "We're {{still in the process of}} forming as a band - we need a keyboard player, I'm not good enough <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> all <b>myself</b> - so that will be rectified soon".|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop! For God's sake, mother, stop!" [...] cried poor Hal. But {{passion was}} boiling {{in the little}} woman's heart, {{and she would not}} hear the boy's petition. [...] "You only abet him, sir!" [...] she cried.--"If I had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>myself,</b> it should be done!" [...] And Harry, with sadness and wrath in his countenance, left the room by the door through which Mr. Ward and his brother had just issued.|$|E
60|$|But {{this offer}} was declined. The old man must have his coffee, and {{as there was}} no one else to make it, I {{undertook}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>myself.</b> I thought I remembered how coffee had been made, when I had been camping out, and I went promptly to work. Everybody helped. The old woman ground the berries, Sister Agatha stirred up the fire, and Sylvia broke two eggs, in order to get shells enough to clear the liquid.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{finished}} my sixth {{pair of socks}} today. With the first three I got Susan to set the heel for me. Then I {{thought that was a}} bit of shirking, so I learned <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>myself.</b> I hate it--but I have done so many things I hate since 4th of August that one more or less doesn't matter. I just think of Jem joking about the mud on Salisbury Plain and I go at them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I’d {{never heard}} the fust mate talk like that afore, ’cept once when he fell overboard, when he was full, and stuck in the Thames mud. He said it was Providence; though, as it was low water, {{according}} to the tide-table, I couldn’t see what Providence had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with <b>it</b> <b>myself.</b> He was as excited as anybody, and took the wheel himself, and put the ship’s head for the boat, and as she came closer, our boat was slung out, and me and the second mate and three other men dropped into her, an’ pulled so as to meet the other.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the inaugural}} Tianjin Open in October, Riske was seeded sixth and {{defeated}} Çağla Büyükakçay, Olga Govortsova, Varvara Lepchenko and Zheng Saisai {{en route to}} the final, without dropping a set. She proceeded to win her maiden WTA title, defeating 17-year-old Swiss Belinda Bencic. After the match, Riske said: [...] "It's a huge accomplishment for me to win my first WTA title and I was here China by <b>myself,</b> which made <b>it</b> even more special, just to know that I was able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> by <b>myself.</b> I hope I can keep up the momentum and try to compete every week as best as I can." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh no, no, no!" [...] {{said the}} old man, not unperturbed, [...] "no, no, I wouldn't trouble you for the world," [...] then, nervously folding up the belt, [...] "and I won't be so impolite as <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for <b>myself,</b> before you, either. But, now that I think of it," [...] after a pause, {{carefully}} taking a little wad from a remote corner of his vest pocket, [...] "here are two bills they gave me at St. Louis, yesterday. No doubt they are all right; but just to pass time, I'll compare them with the Detector here. Blessed boy to make me such a present. Public benefactor, that little boy!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Silence ... I {{may be a}} {{dead man}} by then--the jongejuffrouw remember--make for Ryswyk with her first of all--thence {{straight}} to Haarlem--to her father--you can do it easily. A fortune awaits you if you bring her safely to him. Fulfil my pledge, old compeers, if I am not alive <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>myself.</b> I don't ask you to swear--I know you'll do it--and if I must to the gallows first I'll do so with a cry of triumph." ...|$|E
6000|$|The archdeacon sat {{silent for}} awhile meditating, and Mr. Harding {{stood looking at}} him. [...] "Never mind," [...] said the archdeacon at last; [...] "send the message all the same. The news must be sent to someone, and there is at present {{no one else in}} a {{position}} to receive it. Do it at once, my dear friend; you know I would not trouble you, were I in a state <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>myself.</b> A few minutes' time is of the greatest importance." ...|$|E
60|$|LEO [still in tears] I'm sure I {{never thought}} it would be so horrid for Rejjy. I offered honorably <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>myself,</b> and let him divorce me; but he wouldnt. And he said himself that {{it was the only way}} to do it--that it was the law that he should do it that way. I never saw that hateful {{creature}} until that day in Court. If he had only shewn her to me before, I should never have allowed it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am sure I don't {{know what}} I should do without Florinda," [...] {{admitted}} Mrs. Troyle; [...] "she understands my hair. I've long ago given up trying <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything with <b>it</b> <b>myself.</b> I regard one's hair as I regard husbands: {{as long as}} one is seen together in public one's private divergences don't matter. Surely that was the luncheon gong." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Call it what thou list," [...] {{replied the}} peasant. [...] "Truly, it behoves men in state to give good example. I'll bid no man do that I am not ready <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>myself.</b> <b>It</b> {{is as easy}} to hang a man, as to say hang him; we will have no {{splitting}} of offices in this new world, which is happily set up in old England." ...|$|R
60|$|Why, it {{was almost}} cruel the way those moldy {{veterans}} laughed; {{and as for the}} orator, he looked so flustered and helpless that almost anybody would have pitied him, and I had difficulty <b>to</b> keep from <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>myself.</b> Yes, Joan was feeling very well after her rest, and the native mischief that was in her lay near the surface. <b>It</b> <b>did</b> not show when she made the remark, but I knew it was close in there back of the words.|$|R
