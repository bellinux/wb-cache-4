5|$|In places closely {{associated}} with Titanic, the sense of grief was deep. The heaviest losses were in Southampton, home port to 699crew members and also home {{to many of the}} passengers. Crowds of weeping women– the wives, sisters and mothers of crew– gathered outside the White Star offices in Southampton for news of their loved ones. Most of them were among the 549Southampton residents who perished. In Belfast, churches were packed, and shipyard workers wept in the streets. The ship had been a symbol of Belfast's industrial achievements, and there was not only a sense of grief but also one of guilt, as those who had built Titanic came <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> had been responsible in some way for her loss.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the first}} award of the GC to an Australian in 1942 {{and the final}} bestowal to Constable Michael Kenneth Pratt in 1978, 14 Australians were {{directly}} decorated with the medal. Of these, nine were awarded to military personnel and five to civilians. Eight of the medals were awarded posthumously. At {{the time of the}} institution of the GC, living recipients of the Empire Gallantry Medal automatically became recipients of the new award, and were required to return their previous medal; two Australians became GC holders through this method. In 1971, the British Government announced that living recipients of the Albert Medal and Edward Medal would henceforth be recipients of the GC with the option of exchanging their insignia for that of the GC. The decision for such an action {{was the result of the}} decline in the status and significance of the two awards, leading recipients <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> were not receiving the recognition they were due. Of the 27 Australian holders of the Albert Medal, six were living at the time and all opted to exchange their insignia for the GC. None of the eight Australians awarded the Edward Medal were alive in 1971, and thus no Australian became a recipient of the GC through this exchange. Including exchange awards, a total of 22 Australians were decorated with the GC.|$|E
25|$|As {{designed}} by Macgregor Laird, President was 500 GRT larger than British Queen, then the largest ship. Her opulent interiors were {{in sharp contrast}} to the sparse accommodations of Cunard’s fleet. Great American wanted passengers <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> were in a luxury hotel rather than at sea. The saloon measured 80 feet by 34 feet and was in Tudor Gothic style. The corridor aft to the regular staterooms was a picture gallery, with ten oil paintings depicting scenes about Christopher Columbus. The regular staterooms could accommodate 110 passengers and another 44 forward in Servants cabins. The two berth regular cabins were seven feet by seven feet. Her exterior decoration included a figurehead of George Washington.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, a {{new threat}} to the Cape arose. Some 900 of the Kat river Khoikhoi, who had in former wars been firm allies of the British, joined their former enemies: the Xhosa. They were not without justification. They complained that while serving as {{soldiers}} in former wars — the Cape Mounted Rifles consisted largely of Khoikhois — they had not received the same treatment as others serving in defence of the colony, that they got no compensation for the losses they had sustained, {{and that they were}} in various ways made <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> were a wronged and injured race. A secret alliance was formed with the Xhosa to take up arms in order to remove the Europeans and establish a Khoikhoi republic. Within a fortnight of the attack on Colonel Mackinnon, the Kat river Khoikhoi were also in arms. Their revolt was followed by that of the Khoikhoi at other missionary stations, and some of the Khoikhoi of the Cape Mounted Rifles followed their example, including some of the very men who had escorted the governor from Fort Cox. But many of the Khoikhoi remained loyal, and the Fingo likewise sided with the Cape government.|$|E

She argues that Michelle Obama's candidness led many women voters <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> had {{more in common with}} her than Hillary Clinton. She compares Elizabeth Edwards' public image to that of Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton, and criticizes her for [...] "enabl her husband's deception" [...] about his extramarital affair.|$|E
40|$|Money is an {{important}} factor that influences the development of romantic relationships. The current paper examines how the feeling of having relatively more or less money influences human mating strategies in long-term and short-term mating contexts under the framework of evolutionary psychology. We recruited mainland Chinese college students involved in steady, heterosexual romantic relationships to participate in two experiments. In each study, we experimentally triggered participants’ feelings of having relatively more or less money and then examined their thoughts and behaviors related to mating. Results of Study 1 showed that men who were primed <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> that <b>they</b> had relatively more money were less satisfied with their partners’ physical attractiveness than those primed <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> that <b>they</b> had less money, suggesting that the subjective feeling of having more or less money may affect men’s preferences regarding the physical appearance of a mate in a long-term relationship. Interestingly, this difference was not significant for women. Results of Study 2 indicated that both men and women who were primed <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> that <b>they</b> had relatively more money exhibited a greater behavioral approach tendency toward an attractive member of the opposite sex than those primed <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> that <b>they</b> had less money. This finding suggests that people who <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> have relatively more money may have more interest in an attractive alternative than those who <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> have relatively less money. The differences in mating strategies between and within the genders brought about by money support the evolutionary hypothesis that individuals adopt conditional mating strategies in response to environmental conditions. These findings have both conceptual and practical implications for the psychology of evolution and romantic relationships...|$|R

500|$|Despite the novel's immense {{popularity}} upon publication, it has {{not received}} the close critical attention paid to other modern American classics. Don Noble, editor of a book of essays about the novel, estimates that the ratio of sales to analytical essays may be a million to one. Christopher Metress writes that the book is [...] "an icon whose emotive sway remains strangely powerful because it also remains unexamined". Noble suggests it does not receive academic attention because of its consistent status as a best-seller ("If that many people like it, it can't be any good.") and that general readers seem <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> do not require analytical interpretation.|$|E

While a previous episode had already established Monica as being overweight as a child, this was the first on-screen appearance of [...] "Fat Monica" [...] (the fat suit made frequent return appearances).

However, he quickly became aware of the importance of the public participation process itself, stating that it was [...] "one of the rare opportunities for the public <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> were being heard and taken seriously."

500|$|Production {{designer}} Carey Meyer {{built the}} ship Serenity {{in two parts}} (one for each level) as a complete set with ceilings and practical lighting installed {{as part of the}} set that the cameras could use along with moveable parts. The two-part set also allowed the second unit to shoot in one section while the actors and first unit worked undisturbed in the other. As Whedon recalled: [...] "...you could pull it away or move something huge, so that you could get in and around everything. That meant the environment worked for us and there weren't a lot of adjustments that needed to be made." [...] There were other benefits to this set design. One was that it allowed the viewers <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> were really in a ship. For Whedon, the design of the ship was crucial in defining the known space for the viewer, and that there were not [...] "fourteen hundred decks and a holodeck and an all-you-can-eat buffet in the back". He wanted to convey that it was utilitarian and that it was [...] "beat-up but lived-in and ultimately, it was home". As Joss Whedon discusses in the DVD commentary, each room represented a feeling or character, usually conveyed by the paint color. He explains that as you move {{from the back of the}} ship in the engine room, toward the front of the ship to the bridge, the colors and mood progress from extremely warm to cooler. Besides evoking a mood associated with the character who spends most time in each area, the color scheme also alludes to the heat generated in the tail of the ship.|$|E

[...] Here, in the town square, a special form of free and familiar contact reigned among people who were usually divided by the barriers of caste, property, profession, and age”. The carnival atmosphere holds the lower strata of life most important, as opposed to higher functions (thought, speech, soul) which were usually held dear in the signifying order. At carnival time, the unique sense of time and space causes individuals <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> {{are a part of the}} collectivity, at which point they cease to be themselves.
