50|$|The {{second step}} is to {{determine}} the objective <b>technical</b> <b>problem,</b> i.e., determining, {{in the light of the}} closest prior art, the <b>technical</b> <b>problem,</b> or task (Aufgabe), which the claimed invention addresses and successfully solves. This implies determining the feature(s) distinguishing the claimed subject-matter from the closest prior art, determining the technical effect(s) of the distinguishing feature(s), and finally the objective <b>technical</b> <b>problem,</b> or task, is how to adapt or modify the closest prior art to obtain the identified technical effect. The objective <b>technical</b> <b>problem</b> has to be formulated in such a manner that it does not contain pointers to the solution. In other words, the <b>technical</b> <b>problem</b> has to be formulated without including therein a part of a solution provided by the invention. Otherwise, this would result in an ex post facto assessment of inventive step, i.e. an assessment made with hindsight.|$|R

5|$|The {{submarines}} {{have been}} the subject of many incidents and <b>technical</b> <b>problems</b> since the design phase, including accusations of foul play and bias during the design selection, improper handling of design changes during construction, major capability deficiencies in the first submarines, and ongoing <b>technical</b> <b>problems</b> throughout the early life of the class. These problems have been compounded by the inability of the RAN to retain sufficient personnel to operate the submarines—by 2008, only three could be manned, and between 2009 and 2012, on average two or fewer were fully operational. The resulting negative press has led to a poor public perception of the Collins class.|$|E

"Where {{the claim}} {{refers to an}} aim to be {{achieved}} in a nontechnical field, this aim may legitimately appear {{in the formulation of}} the <b>technical</b> <b>problem</b> as part of the framework of the <b>technical</b> <b>problem</b> that is to be solved, in particular as a constraint that has to be met." [...] The technical professional or skilled person would, in a realistic situation, receive knowledge of the features which do not as such make a contribution to the technical character of the invention (the non-technical features) as part of the task information given to him (the objective <b>technical</b> <b>problem).</b> In other words, it is permissible to include non-technical features into the formulation of the <b>technical</b> <b>problem,</b> so that they cannot support a finding of inventive step.|$|R

Whether it was identified by routine maintenance (as was the case in Wallentin) or {{as a result of a}} warning light during flight (as in the present case) seems to me to be irrelevant. Equally and for that very reason the fact that it was unexpected and unforeseeable is also irrelevant. The reality is that once a <b>technical</b> <b>problem</b> is identified it is inherent in the normal activity of the air carrier to have to resolve that <b>technical</b> <b>problem.</b> Further, the resolution of the problem, as was demonstrated in this case, is entirely within the control of the carrier.|$|R

Reichsmarshall Hermann Göring, head of the Luftwaffe, replied that the already overburdened German aircraft industry could not possibly complete the design, testing and mass production of such aircraft before 1946. Instead, he proposed converting existing aircraft (again the Junkers Ju 87 and Messerschmitt Bf 109) as a temporary solution until newer types could be developed. Training of carrier pilots at Travemünde would also resume.|$|E
