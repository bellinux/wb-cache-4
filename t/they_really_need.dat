25|$|The goal of guided {{instruction}} in the gradual release of responsibility model is to guide students toward using different skills, strategies and procedures independently. The student will assume more responsibility with less support from the teacher. Lessons are created as to ensure student success. Oftentimes when students are struggling with a concept in the classroom, {{they do not need}} more teacher modelling, what <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>need</b> is guidance and support to meet high expectations.|$|E
500|$|The {{laughing}} gas {{has been in}} desperately short supply at Holby of late. [...] What <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>need</b> is {{for someone to come}} along and prove that heart transplants can be fun. It's a job for comedy cardiac specialist Percy Durant (guest star Ade Edmondson), who we last saw working out in Ghana with consultant Ric. You could easily imagine Percy driving around in a van with a big, red, plastic heart on top of it, or cracking open someone's chest and pulling out a bunch of flowers. And when it comes to Lisa (Luisa Bradshaw-White), he magically comes up with the answer to all her problems.|$|E
500|$|The fourth {{song and}} third single [...] "Break the Ice" [...] opens with Spears singing the lines [...] "It's {{been a while}} / I know I shouldn't have kept you waiting / But I'm here now". The song {{features}} a choir and Keri Hilson singing background vocals sounding almost like a duet. Hilson explained the song is about [...] "two people, a girl and a guy, [...] and the girl is saying, 'You're a little cold. Let me warm things up and [...]'" [...] After the chorus, the bridge begins with Spears saying [...] "I like this part" [...] mimicking Janet Jackson in [...] "Nasty" [...] (1986). The album's fifth track, [...] "Heaven on Earth", is a Euro disco love song with new wave influences. It is inspired by Donna Summer's [...] "I Feel Love" [...] (1977), with three vocal lines taking place over the beat. Nicole Morier commented that the song was written from a very dark place, saying, [...] "I was thinking of someone and thinking they were so perfect and that I have all these imperfections. [...] I think what's touching {{about it is that}} it's from the perspective of someone who feels like <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>need</b> this person just to feel safe and feel good." [...] Spears named the song her favorite from Blackout. The sixth track, [...] "Get Naked (I Got a Plan)" [...] is an uptempo R song about sex. It is a duet between Spears and Danja, who sings the chorus with his voice distorted to sound like a decaying moan. Spears contributes a series of gasps, sighs and chants and her voice is also distorted.|$|E

The show was later canceled and aired its final episode on June 17, 2006. On this episode, Chung, {{dressed in a white}} evening gown and dancing atop a black piano, sang a parody to the tune of [...] "Thanks for the Memory". Video clips of the bizarre, off-key farewell performance circulated on internet video sites. Connie herself commented, [...] "All I want to be sure of is that viewers understood it was a giant self-parody. If anyone took it seriously, <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>need</b> to get a life." [...] On the June 27, 2006 episode of The Tonight Show, Jay Leno interviewed Chung about her [...] "Thanks for the Memory" [...] parody. During the interview, Chung poked fun at her show's low ratings, referring to the musical number as a [...] "private joke for our two viewers".|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We tested {{effects of}} dissuading {{students}} from requesting help unless <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>needed</b> it. The manipulation occurred while the students solved problems on an ITS that provided proactive help. Compared to their counterparts, dissuaded students requested help much less often. Moreover, the less help students requested, the higher their posttest score. Among students with lower pretest scores, dissuaded students marginally {{gained more than}} their non-dissuaded counterparts. We discuss our results, {{a new type of}} help abuse, some ramifications of proactive help, and the generalizability of our results...|$|R
