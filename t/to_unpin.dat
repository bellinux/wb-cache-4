40|$|We {{have studied}} numerically the {{dynamics}} of a directed elastic string in a two-dimensional array of quenched random impurities. The string is driven by a constant transverse force and thermal fluctuations are neglected. There is a transition from pinned <b>to</b> <b>unpinned</b> behavior at a critical value F_T of the driving force. At the transition the average string velocity scales with the driving force. The scaling is equally well described by a power law v_d∼ (F-F_T) ^ζ, with ζ= 0. 24 ± 0. 1, or by a logarithm, v_d∼ 1 /(F-F_T). The divergence of the velocity-velocity correlation length at threshold is characterized by an exponent ν= 1. 05 ± 0. 1. Comment: 12 pages + 3 Postscript figure...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes an}} experimental {{study on the}} patterning of thin films and spin valve devices. Initially {{the change in the}} magnetisation reversal of ferromagnetic Ni 80 Fe 15 Mo 5 thin films was investigated as the shape anisotropy was increased using optical lithography to pattern wire arrays. These structures show a progressive increase in coercivity and a transition between single and two-stage reversal with increasing milling depth. A similar patterning technique was applied <b>to</b> <b>unpinned</b> (Ni 80 Fe 20 /Cu/Ni 80 Fe 20) pseudo spin valve (PSV) structures in order to enhance the coercivity of one of the ferromagnetic layers. The increased coercivity induced by micropatterning changed the natural similarity of the magnetic layers and the structure exhibited a small spin valve response. These initial measurements were carried out with separate milling and electrical characterisation steps. However, it was decided that it would be ideal to design a technique to do in-situ magnetoresistance measurements during milling. This meant that the samples could be milled and characterised in the same step, leading to a much cleaner and more efficient process. In-situ magnetoresistance measurements were carried out during micropatterning of PS...|$|R

Electrons are not expected to be superfluid at the relevant temperatures but a pionic Bose condensate may appear at higher densities. Both neutrons and protons form quantized vortex arrays : The first - in response to the stellar rotation, the second - in response to its magnetic field. The detailed structure of these arrays throughout the star depends primarily on the temperature and density profiles and on the kinematic history of the star. Vortex dynamics include coherent ("sound waves") modes of free vortices, pinning of vortex cores onto nuclei or as interstitials in the nuclear lattice and scattering of vortex cores by pinning sites and by the charges stellar components. This dynamics can be described as the dynamics of point particles, as long as velocities and forces vary only on scales larger than the size of vortex cores and as long as effects of the spherical boundary are small. In the 3 P 2 phase, the degeneracy of the J = 2 two-neutron state may lead to further dynamical complexity.

40|$|International audienceIn this work, {{we compare}} the {{photodetector}} performance of single nearly defect-free undoped and n-i-n GaN nanowires (NWs).

5000|$|Beginning {{as a young}} woman, Dickinson has {{developed}} and presented performances, exhibitions, and public art projects that merge mythological, autobiographical, geographical, and historical lines of inquiry. During a twelve-year period, Dickinson moved her creative practice to a 200-acre wetland in rural Illinois often living outdoors--sleeping in abandoned deer beds--or inhabiting a six-floor silo and bat-infested barn. In that place and its surrounds--rural, agricultural, and the beginnings of exurbia--Dickinson worked in cooperation with others <b>to</b> <b>unpin</b> straightened rivers, remove agricultural tiles, rout buckthorn, and safely conduct controlled burns. She became a beekeeper and herbalist and, for those twelve years, sat daily and nightly beneath the sun, moon, and stars in order to observe and integrate their alignments. In so doing, Dickinson familiarized herself with one place--its stories and mythologies entwined with its geographies, communities, and climate--and the wider connection of one place to others and all that is embodied within that suggestion. From that learned sensibility, Dickinson developed and presented a series of “performances” in the form in large, collaborative events in which, after months and even years of preparation, she stepped back allowing co-authorship with the landscapes and inhabitants with whom she shared a particular dwelling-place. In these ways, Dickinson embodies, in the best contemporary sense, what generations of [...] "eco artists" [...] and feminist practices have advocated: permeability and the interdependence of learning and making.|$|E
40|$|The pinning and {{collective}} unpinning of superfluid vortices in a decelerating container {{is a key}} element of the canonical model of neutron star glitches and laboratory spin-down experiments with helium II. Here the dynamics of vortex (un) pinning is explored using numerical Gross-Pitaevskii calculations, with a view to understanding the triggers for catastrophic unpinning events (vortex avalanches) that lead to rotational glitches. We explicitly identify three triggers: rotational shear between the bulk condensate and the pinned vortices, a vortex proximity effect driven by the repulsive vortex-vortex interaction, and sound waves emitted by moving and repinning vortices. So long as dissipation is low, sound waves emitted by a repinning vortex are found to be sufficiently strong <b>to</b> <b>unpin</b> a nearby vortex. For both ballistic and forced vortex motion, the maximum inter-vortex separation required <b>to</b> <b>unpin</b> scales inversely with pinning strength. Comment: 16 pages, 18 figure...|$|E
40|$|We use a {{sensitive}} magneto-optical microscopy technique to image the magnetization response of micron-scale ferromagnetic disks {{to changes in}} applied magnetic field. This differential technique relies on a modulated applied magnetic field which allows us to measure changes in magnetization < 1 % with sub-micron resolution. The disks are magnetized in single vortex domains, with defects in the material serving to pin the vortex core at particular positions. By applying a small AC magnetic field, we measure the deformation of the magnetization while the core remains pinned. We can also characterize {{the strength of the}} pinning site by increasing the AC magnetic field <b>to</b> <b>unpin</b> the vortex core. While pinned, we find that the magnetization away from the core reorients slightly to better align with an applied field. Additionally, an applied field causes the pinned core itself to tilt {{in the direction of the}} field.

Pinning reduces the average contact number needed <b>to</b> jam <b>unpinned</b> {{particles}} and shifts the jamming threshold to lower densities, leading to a pinning susceptibility, χ_p.

40|$|The {{influence}} of different chemical treatments on the electrical behaviour of n- and p-type Al/Si Schottky junctions was studied. A Schottky barrier height of 0. 91 eV was achieved on p-type Si probably due <b>to</b> the <b>unpinning</b> of the Fermi-level at the Al/Si interface. This {{is one of}} the highest barrier height values reported so far for a solid-state Schottky junction prepared to p-Si. A doping level reduction was observed {{in the vicinity of the}} Si surface for wafers with native oxide and for those boiled in acetone or annealed in forming gas. It was observed unexpectedly that the reactive plasma etch used for the formation of mesa structures decreases the apparent Schottky barrier height.

40|$|In {{the early}} 1990 s, the Low-Profile Portable Concrete Barrier (PCB) system, {{including}} both the sloped Low-Profile PCB segment and Low-Profile PCB end treatment, were developed. The original Low-Profile PCB end treatment was designed with steel pins inserted along the barrier centerline, through precast holes, and {{anchored to the}} pavement or subgrade. The purpose of these pins was to reduce lateral deflection of the end treatment during an impact. For various reasons, users of the Low-Profile PCB system have stated that the system would be more easily deployed if the vertical pins were not used in situations where lateral deflections can be permitted. The primary objective of the research presented herein {{was to determine the}} feasibility of removing the vertical, steel pins from the Low-Profile PCB end treatment in certain applications and if necessary make modifications. The secondary objective of the research presented herein was to demonstrate the applicability of the finite element analysis (FEA) <b>to</b> <b>unpinned</b> barrier systems. The research objectives were achieved through the use of sound engineering judgment, FEA, and a full-scale crash test. Based on sound engineering judgment and approximate strength analyses of the original Low-Profile PCB design, the author determined the system would most likely function acceptably but would have large lateral deflections. In order to increase connection rigidity and thus control lateral displacement, a plate washer was added to the barrier connection. The modified non-pinned Low-Profile PCB system was tested for strength in a full-scale crash test under Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware (MASH) test 2 - 35. Additionally, the recommended system was analyzed under similar test conditions with LS-DYNA, a finite element code. The recommended system passed the MASH test 2 - 35, in both a full-scale crash test and FEA. While this does not replace the original barrier, it does provide another option for use of the Low-Profile PCB in situations where sufficient room for deflection outside of the length of need exists. If this room does not exist, the barrier must remain pinned...|$|R
