5|$|Despite the {{religious}} references in the series, Nakamura stated she used only her personal knowledge and {{some aspects of}} modern society, such as yakuza and blogging, which were {{not intended to be}} critical but were added because <b>they</b> <b>fit</b> the story. Similarly, secondary characters were only introduced in the series if a chapter needed a new character to introduce a topic. The themes of the chapters were created before the situations and jokes. However, if Nakamura had a specific theme, she created several jokes and then connected them to form a story. When creating a simpler chapter as compared to the more elaborate, thematic ones, she wrote without worrying about creating jokes and situations in advance. With the help of her four assistants, on average she took between ten days and two weeks to make a complete chapter.|$|E

5|$|The main {{use for the}} agung in Maguindanao and Maranao {{society is}} as a supportive/accompanying {{instrument}} of an orthodox kulintang ensemble. Using basic patterns and interlocking rhythms, a player would use the agung to complement the melody played by the kulintang. The patterns players use are normally considered freer than either the babendil or the dabakan; players could manipulate the patterns freely {{as long as they}} conform, reaffirm, reinforce and even generate the rhythmic mode of the piece. The length of the patterns themselves may vary depending on how <b>they</b> <b>fit</b> into the melodic improvisation. Rapid style is useful especially during exhibition of playing skills.|$|E

5|$|Pierce {{cast the}} actors by {{approaching}} customers {{at a local}} gas station whenever he saw somebody that looked like <b>they</b> <b>fit</b> one of the parts. He hired high school students as crew members who helped load and move equipment. For the creature itself, he limited the sightings to shadowy figures because he felt the film would be more frightening if the creature was left to the viewer's imagination. Pierce sang the theme song featured in the film. Once the film was completed, he put the reel {{into the trunk of}} his car and drove to Los Angeles seeking post-production services. He met Jamie Mendoza-Nava, who owned a small post-production company and agreed to work on the film for limited up-front pay and {{a small percentage of the}} film's box-office receipts. Pierce could not find a major studio willing to distribute it, so he rented a local movie theater in Texarkana for one week to screen the film. He cleaned the property himself to prepare for the debut.|$|E
5|$|The roster was {{selected}} internally by NetherRealm Studios with input from DC Comics. The main goal during the selection process, which took around {{three to four}} months, {{was to create a}} cast featuring a wide variety of characters. Characters were chosen based on criteria such as size, ability, gender, popularity, and how well <b>they</b> <b>fit</b> within the Injustice storyline. The addition of each playable hero and villain required about six weeks of development. The characters were designed with the intent to make each fighter unique, and fighting styles and movesets were tailored to the lore and personality of each character. Ed Boon stated that DC Comics had given NetherRealm a large amount of freedom with their properties, allowing them to put their own spin on characters. Several other characters from the DC Universe, such as Darkseid, Scarecrow, Metallo, and Gorilla Grodd, also appear as non-player characters, making cameo appearances in story cutscenes, stages, and other game modes. Outside of the DC universe, Scorpion from the Mortal Kombat series appears as a downloadable guest character.|$|E
5|$|Because of the 1976 {{disturbances}} and {{the subsequent}} arrests, mistreatment and dismissals of worker militants, a group of intellectuals led by Jacek Kuroń, Antoni Macierewicz, Jan Józef Lipski and Adam Michnik founded and operated the Workers' Defence Committee (Komitet Obrony Robotników; KOR). The aim of the KOR was to assist the worker victims of the 1976 repression. Working to support the spontaneous workers' movements, the dissidents recognized the necessarily predominant role {{of the working class}} in resisting the abuses of the regime and the newly formed opposition increasingly became characterized by an alliance of intelligentsia with workers. The KOR, according to Modzelewski, constituted the core of organized opposition and a seed of political alternative; clearing the way for other opposition formations, it engendered political pluralism. More opposition groups indeed soon followed, including the Movement for Defense of Human and Civic Rights (ROPCiO), Free Trade Unions of the Coast (WZW) and the Confederation of Independent Poland (KPN). The periodical Robotnik ("The Worker") was distributed in factories from September 1977. The idea of independent trade unions was first raised by the Gdańsk and Szczecin workers striking in 1970–71, but was later developed and promoted by the KOR and its leftist collaborators, which led to the establishment in 1978 of Free Trade Unions, the precursor of Solidarity. The KPN represented the minority at that time right-wing of the Polish opposition scene. The opposition members tried to resist the regime by denouncing it for violating the Polish constitution, Polish laws and Poland's international obligations. <b>They</b> <b>fit</b> within the post-Helsinki Soviet Bloc human rights movements {{and for the most part}} had not yet developed more radical, anti-system orientations.|$|E

25|$|Path of the Dragon {{was most}} widely {{reviewed}} for the PC, where it received mixed reviews.

25|$|Needle gauges {{can be made}} of any material, but {{are often}} made of metal and plastic. They tend to be about 3 by 5 inches.

25|$|However, the {{structure}} of the history itself is sound, as most things are added with an eye to how <b>they</b> <b>fit</b> in with everything that is already known. As a result, the SFU has a history that covers (in various products) a span of about 130 years. Thanks to Steve Cole being the guiding influence from start to finish, the SFU has far fewer inconsistencies than the canon Star Trek universe.|$|E
25|$|The {{recruitment}} {{process for}} commandos is stringent, with potential candidates handpicked through a vocational assessment {{before they even}} formally begin serving National Service (NS).

Shortlisted candidates are then subjected to more tests to ensure that <b>they</b> <b>fit</b> certain criteria, such as having above average intelligence and excellent eyesight, before they are selected to join the unit. After completing an interview, the chosen candidate is then enlisted into one of the unit's companies and proceeds for basic military training.|$|E
25|$|Stone {{has been}} used as a {{building}} material for thousands of years. It has long been recognized as a material of great durability. The pyramids in Giza, burial chambers in the UK and temples in Malta were all built from stone over 4000 years ago and are still standing. The earliest form of stone construction is known as dry stone, or dry stacking. These are freestanding structures such as field walls, bridges and buildings that use irregularly shaped stones carefully selected and placed so that <b>they</b> <b>fit</b> closely together without slipping. Structures are typically wider at the base and taper in as height increases. They do not require any special tools, only the skill of the craftsman in choosing and placing the stones.|$|E

25|$|Following the game's release, {{some of the}} {{alternative}} outfits for characters had come under criticism for using cultural stereotypes, such as a Native American headdress option for the character of Pharah, {{who seemed to be}} primarily of Egyptian origin. Kaplan noted that they considered for all these outfits if they were appropriate, believing they were respecting the cultures of the characters they had created, and would make necessary changes if they felt there were valid concerns. Kaplan commented that many players have responded positively to these outfits and feel <b>they</b> <b>fit</b> in appropriately with the idealized version of Earth. Later game developments showed that Pharah was actually set out as a half-Egyptian/half-Native American character, making such outfits appropriate in hindsight.|$|E
25|$|By the 1960s {{there was}} a lot of {{controversy}} surrounding the Hohokam and where <b>they</b> <b>fit</b> or didn't fit chronologically.

It was strategically placed in the proximity of the Gila River which then allowed for its famous irrigation system. Haury's re-examination of Snaketown was based around the hope that with the use of new technology, new research methods and ideas surrounding the Hohokam, that questions which had arisen since the first reports on Snaketown in the 1930s. In 1964 Haury began his reexamination which led to the publication in 1976 of one of the most influential works on the Hohokam, The Hohokam, Desert Farmers & Craftsmen: Excavations at Snaketown, 1964-1965.|$|E
25|$|Leather is {{a natural}} product with special {{characteristics}} that make it comfortable to wear, and give it great strength and flexibility. Because it {{is a natural}} product, with its own unique variations, every piece has its own individual characteristics. As they are worn and used, leather gloves (especially if <b>they</b> <b>fit</b> snugly) will conform to the wearer's hand. As this occurs the leather of the glove will become more malleable, and thus softer and more supple. This process is known as 'breaking-in' the glove. Overtime wear spots may appear on {{certain parts of the}} palm and fingertips, due to the constant use of those areas of the glove. Creases and wrinkles will appear on the palm side of the leather glove and will generally correspond to the locations of the hinge joints of the wearer's hands, including the interphalangeal articulations of hand, metacarpophalangeal joints, intercarpal articulations, and wrists.|$|E
