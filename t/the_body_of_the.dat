5|$|A 2012 {{study on}} the effects of {{rainfall}} patterns and parasite infections on <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> springbok in Etosha National Park observed that males and juveniles were in better health {{toward the end of the}} rainy season. Health of females was more affected by parasites than by rainfall; parasite count in females peaked prior to and immediately after parturition. Studies show that springbok host helminths (Haemonchus, Longistrongylus and Trichostrongylus), ixodid ticks (Rhipicephalus species), lice (Damalinia and Linognathus species). Eimeria species mainly affect juveniles.|$|E

40|$|Anatomical {{science has}} used <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{executed}} for dissection over many centuries. As anatomy has {{developed into a}} vehicle of not only scientific but also moral and ethical education, {{it is important to}} consider <b>the</b> source <b>of</b> human <b>bodies</b> for dissection and <b>the</b> manner <b>of</b> their acquisition. From the thirteenth to the early seventeenth century, <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> executed were <b>the</b> only legal source <b>of</b> <b>bodies</b> for dissection. Starting in the late seventeenth century, <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> unclaimed persons were also made legally available. With the developing movement to abolish the death penalty in many countries around the world and with <b>the</b> renunciation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> executed by the British legal system in the nineteenth century, two different practices have developed in that there are Anatomy Departments who use <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> executed for dissection or research and those who do not. <b>The</b> history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> executed in German Anatomy Departments during the National Socialist regime is an example for the insidious slide from an ethical use <b>of</b> human <b>bodies</b> in dissection to an unethical one. There are cases of contemporary use of unclaimed or donated <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> executed, but they are rarely well documented. <b>The</b> intention <b>of</b> this review is to initiate an ethical discourse about <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> executed in contemporary anatomy.

5|$|As a {{component}} of the female reproductive system, the cervix is derived from the two paramesonephric ducts (also called Müllerian ducts), which develop around the sixth week of embryogenesis. During development, the outer parts of the two ducts fuse, forming a single urogenital canal that will become the vagina, cervix and uterus. The cervix grows in size at a smaller rate than <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> uterus, so the relative size of the cervix over time decreases, decreasing from being much larger than <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> uterus in fetal life, twice as large during childhood, and decreasing to its adult size, smaller than the uterus, after puberty. Previously it was thought that during fetal development, the original squamous epithelium of the cervix is derived from the urogenital sinus and the original columnar epithelium is derived from the paramesonephric duct. The point at which these two original epithelia meet is called the original squamocolumnar junction. New studies show, however, that all the cervical as well as large part of the vaginal epithelium are derived from Müllerian duct tissue and that phenotypic differences might be due to other causes.|$|E

5|$|Fibropapillomatosis disease {{caused by}} a form of the herpes-type virus threatens loggerheads with {{internal}} and external tumors.

Trematode infection can be highly debilitating. For example, inflammatory trematode lesions can cause endocarditis and neurological disease.
