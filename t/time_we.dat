5|$|Even {{though to}} me, a Japanese schoolgirl uniform {{is kind of}} like blackface, I am just in {{acceptance}} over it, because something is better than nothing. An ugly picture is better than a blank space, and it means that one day, we will have another display at the Museum of Asian Invisibility, that groups of children will crowd around in disbelief, because once upon a <b>time,</b> <b>we</b> weren’t there.|$|E

5|$|It's good to {{know people}} didn't see it coming. That's a big concern when you {{have this kind of}} story line and you are leading to that kind of reveal.

I pride myself in the fact that, when you pick up an issue of the comic, you don't know what's going to happen at any time. So any <b>time</b> <b>we</b> can work that into the show and maintain that in a television environment, it's very exciting for me. I’m glad people are being caught off guard.|$|E

5|$|My father... was {{the richest}} man in Palestine. He marketed about ten percent of all the citrus crops sent from Palestine to Europe—especially to England and Germany. He owned a summer house in Marseilles, France, and another house in İskenderun, then in Syria and {{afterwards}} Turkey, and a number of houses in Palestine itself. Most of the <b>time</b> <b>we</b> lived in Jaffa. Our house had about twenty rooms, and we children would go down to swim in the sea. We also had stables with Arabian horses, and one of our homes in Ashkelon even had a large swimming pool. I think we must have been the only family in Palestine with a private swimming pool.|$|E
5|$|Other bands {{during that}} part of the '80's, both major and not-so-major acts, were really getting on the {{political}} bandwagon for one stupid reason or another. They were all so fucking serious, trying to be a voice for a generation or some shit like that, but worst of all they remained within the parameters of social acceptability. There was also a big censorship flap going on at the <b>time.</b> <b>We</b> looked at it as a chance to catch up with our obscenity quota.|$|E
