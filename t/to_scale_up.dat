5|$|During {{his time}} at the USDA, Thom became a world {{authority}} on the genera Aspergillus and Penicillium. Thom pioneered the technique of using defined, reproducible culture media to grow microorganisms; most of the taxa he described are still valid today. Together with Margaret B. Church, Thom maintained collections of fungus cultures for the American Type Culture Collection, established in 1925. In 1929, a year after discovering penicillin, Alexander Fleming published a well-known paper in which he identified the mold Penicillium rubrum as the one responsible for creating the drug. Harold Raistrick succeeded in growing the organism on a simple culture medium, but could not isolate the penicillin produced by the mold when grown this way. With Thom's assistance, they correctly identified the organism as Penicillium notatum and, in 1941, developed a method <b>to</b> <b>scale</b> <b>up</b> production at the Department of Agriculture's Northern Regional Research Laboratory in Peoria, Illinois, which ultimately resulted in an inexpensive supply of the drug.|$|E
5|$|The glass forms include {{borosilicate}} {{glasses and}} phosphate glasses. Borosilicate nuclear waste glasses are used on an industrial scale to immobilize high level radioactive waste {{in many countries}} which are producers of nuclear energy or have nuclear weaponry. The glass waste forms {{have the advantage of}} being able to accommodate a wide variety of waste-stream compositions, they are easy <b>to</b> <b>scale</b> <b>up</b> to industrial processing, and they are stable against thermal, radiative, and chemical perturbations. These glasses function by binding radioactive elements to nonradioactive glass-forming elements. Phosphate glasses while not being used industrially have much lower dissolution rates than borosilicate glasses, which make them a more favorable option. However, no single phosphate material has the ability to accommodate all of the radioactive products so phosphate storage requires more reprocessing to separate the waste into distinct fractions. Both glasses have to be processed at elevated temperatures making them unusable for some of the more volatile radiotoxic elements.|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveAs shared {{decision}} makes increasing headway {{in healthcare}} policy, {{it is under}} more scrutiny. We sought to identify and dispel the most prevalent myths about shared decision making. MethodsIn 20 years in the shared decision making field one of the author has repeatedly heard mention of the same barriers <b>to</b> <b>scaling</b> <b>up</b> shared decision making across the healthcare spectrum. We conducted a selective literature review relating to shared decision making to further investigate these commonly perceived barriers and to seek evidence supporting their existence or not. ResultsBeliefs about barriers <b>to</b> <b>scaling</b> <b>up</b> shared decision making represent {{a wide range of}} historical, cultural, financial and scientific concerns. We found little evidence to support twelve of the most common beliefs about barriers <b>to</b> <b>scaling</b> <b>up</b> shared decision making, and indeed found evidence to the contrary. ConclusionOur selective review of the literature suggests that twelve of the most commonly perceived barriers <b>to</b> <b>scaling</b> <b>up</b> shared decision making across the healthcare spectrum should be termed myths as they can be dispelled by evidence. Practice implicationsOur review confirms that the current debate about shared decision making must not deter policy makers and clinicians from pursuing its <b>scaling</b> <b>up</b> across the healthcare continuum...|$|R

Macroeconomic causes encouraged widespread child labour across the world, over most of human history. They suggest that the causes for child labour include both the demand and the supply side. While poverty and unavailability of good schools explain the child labour supply side, they suggest that the growth of low-paying informal economy rather than higher paying formal economy is amongst the causes of the demand side. Other scholars too suggest that inflexible labour market, sise of informal economy, inability of industries <b>to</b> <b>scale</b> <b>up</b> and lack of modern manufacturing technologies are major macroeconomic factors affecting demand and acceptability of child labour.|$|E
25|$|From 1816 to the 1830s, the Navy {{accumulated}} extensive {{stocks of}} live oak timbers {{for use in}} new warship construction under {{the provisions of the}} Act for the Gradual Increase of the Navy of the United States, passed in 1816. In the early 1850s, the Navy decided to build a new sail-powered ship using these existing stockpiles, calling for a sloop-of-war that would be fast, with a long endurance, and sufficiently armed to be capable of engaging other warships of her type. This would produce a capable warship while keeping costs low since the material used was already on hand and an expensive steam engine would not be required. Chief Constructor John Lenthall prepared the design, along with Edward Delano, the constructor of the Gosport Shipyard. In June 1853, Lenthall completed the hull half model, which was necessary <b>to</b> <b>scale</b> <b>up</b> the design and to prepare the necessary hull timbers.

25|$|The {{reality is}} not so clear-cut. The most {{advanced}} fusion programs {{in the world are}} inertial confinement fusion (such as National Ignition Facility) and magnetic confinement fusion (such as ITER and other tokamaks). In the case of the former, there is no solid roadmap to power generation. In the case of the latter, commercial power generation is not expected until around 2050. In both cases, the type of fusion discussed is the simplest: D-T fusion. The reason for this is the very low Coulomb barrier for this reaction; for D+3He, the barrier is much higher, and it is even higher for 3He–3He. The immense cost of reactors like ITER and National Ignition Facility are largely due to their immense size, yet <b>to</b> <b>scale</b> <b>up</b> to higher plasma temperatures would require reactors far larger still. The 14.7 MeV proton and 3.6 MeV alpha particle from D–3He fusion, plus the higher conversion efficiency, means that more electricity is obtained per kilogram than with D-T fusion (17.6 MeV), but not that much more. As a further downside, the rates of reaction for helium-3 fusion reactions are not particularly high, requiring a reactor that is larger still or more reactors to produce the same amount of electricity.|$|E

500|$|An {{association}} between circumcision and reduced heterosexual HIV infection rates was suggested in 1986. [...] Experimental evidence {{was needed to}} establish a causal relationship, so three randomized controlled trials were commissioned {{as a means to}} reduce the effect of any confounding factors. Trials took place in South Africa, Kenya and Uganda. All three trials were stopped early by their monitoring boards on ethical grounds because those in the circumcised group had a lower rate of HIV contraction than the control group. Subsequently, the World Health Organization promoted circumcision in high-risk populations as part of an overall program to reduce the spread of HIV, although some have challenged the validity of the African randomized controlled trials, prompting a number of researchers to question the effectiveness of circumcision as an HIV prevention strategy. The Male Circumcision Clearinghouse website was formed in 2009 by WHO, UNAIDS, FHI and AVAC to provide current evidence-based guidance, information, and resources to support the delivery of safe male circumcision services in countries that choose <b>to</b> <b>scale</b> <b>up</b> the procedure as one component of comprehensive HIV prevention services.|$|E
500|$|Supermarionation, a {{technique}} {{in which the}} movement of the marionette puppet's mouth is electronically synchronised with character dialogue, had been formulated by Gerry Anderson for Four Feather Falls in 1960. Until production for Captain Scarlet, the head of the puppet had been disproportionately large in comparison to its body, as the head contained a solenoid that formed the key component of the lip-synch mechanism. The production team was not able <b>to</b> <b>scale</b> <b>up</b> the body to match the head, as this would have made the puppets hard to operate and have necessitated a proportionate scaling-up {{in the size of the}} puppet sets. Since Gerry Anderson had expressed frustration with this caricatured design during the production of earlier Supermarionation series, and wished that the puppets would more accurately reflect human biology, before production commenced on Captain Scarlet the producer, Reg Hill, and his associate, John Read, designed a new type of puppet in which the solenoid was instead placed inside the chest, to permit a head of realistic proportion. The costume designer for Captain Scarlet was Sylvia Anderson, who was influenced by the work of French fashion designer Pierre Cardin, in particular his 1966 [...] "Cosmonaut" [...] collection, in designing the Spectrum uniforms.|$|E
