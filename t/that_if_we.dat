5|$|If {{you talk}} to people who perform a Burrakatha, you will see a huge {{difference}} in the way the older generation performs the art vis-à-vis the way the way the younger generation performs it... This has happened because of the advent of television. Burrakatha is a long-format art form. The point we are making is <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> don't protect these folk arts, they will be on their way out.|$|E
5|$|An {{approach}} to supporting the possibility premise in Plantinga's {{version of the}} argument was attempted by Alexander R. Pruss. He started with the 8th–9th century AD Indian philosopher Sankara's dictum that if something is impossible, we cannot have a perception (even a non-veridical one) {{that it is the}} case. It follows <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> have a perception that p, then even though it might not be the case that p, it is at least the case that possibly p. If mystics in fact perceive the existence of a maximally great being, it follows that the existence of a maximally great being is at least possible.|$|E

Having said <b>that...</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> do make up our minds at some stage that the Government is so reprehensible that an Opposition must use whatever power is available to it, then I'd {{want to find a}} situation in which Mr. Whitlam woke up one morning finding the decision had been made and finding that he had been caught with his pants well and truly down.|$|E

25|$|More intuitively, {{we can say}} <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> want {{to get all the}} f(x) {{values to}} stay in some small {{neighborhood}} around f(x0), we simply need to choose a small enough neighborhood for the x values around x0.

25|$|The {{dictionary}} learning framework, {{namely the}} linear decomposition of an input signal using a few basis elements learned from data itself, {{has led to}} state-of-art results in various image and video processing tasks.

25|$|It {{is obvious}} <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> could find {{characters}} or signs suited for expressing all our thoughts as clearly and as exactly as arithmetic expresses numbers or geometry expresses lines, {{we could do}} in all matters insofar as {{they are subject to}} reasoning all that we can do in arithmetic and geometry.

25|$|The {{argument}} thus claims <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> {{find the}} inverted spectrum plausible, we {{must admit that}} qualia exist (and are non-physical). Some philosophers find it absurd that an armchair argument can prove something to exist, and the detailed argument does involve a lot of assumptions about conceivability and possibility, which are open to criticism. Perhaps {{it is not possible}} for a given brain state to produce anything other than a given quale in our universe, and that is all that matters.|$|E
25|$|We {{know our}} human bodies have {{boundaries}} and occupy space, {{the same way}} other objects known only through our named senses do. Though we seldom think of our body as a physical object, we know even before reflection that it shares some of an object's properties. We understand that a watermelon cannot successfully occupy the same space as an oncoming truck; we know <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> tried to repeat the experiment with our own body, we would obtain similar results—we know this {{even if we do}} not understand the physics involved.|$|E

25|$|This form {{suggests}} <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> {{can find}} a function ψ whose gradient is given by P, then the integral A is given by the difference of ψ at the endpoints of the interval of integration. Thus the problem of studying the curves that make the integral stationary {{can be related to}} the study of the level surfaces of ψ. In order to find such a function, we turn to the wave equation, which governs the propagation of light. This formalism is used in the context of Lagrangian optics and Hamiltonian optics.|$|E
25|$|Rabbi Leone di Modena, a 17th-century Venetian {{critic of}} Kabbalah, wrote <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> were {{to accept the}} Kabbalah, then the Christian trinity would indeed be {{compatible}} with Judaism, as the Trinity closely resembles the kabbalistic doctrine of the sephirot. This critique {{was in response to}} the knowledge that some European Jews of the period addressed individual sephirot in some of their prayers, although the practice was apparently uncommon. Apologists explain that Jews may have been praying for and not necessarily to the aspects of Godliness represented by the sephirot.|$|E
25|$|To {{create this}} I–Thou {{relationship}} with God, {{a person has}} {{to be open to}} the idea of such a relationship, but not actively pursue it. The pursuit of such a relation creates qualities associated with It‑ness, and so would prevent an I‑You relation, limiting it to I‑It. Buber claims <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> are open to the I–Thou, God eventually comes to us in response to our welcome. Also, because the God Buber describes is completely devoid of qualities, this I–Thou relationship lasts as long as the individual wills it. When the individual finally returns to the I‑It way of relating, this acts as a barrier to deeper relationship and community.|$|E

25|$|Self-reducibility {{describes}} the phenomenon <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> can quickly test whether a SAT instance is solvable, we can almost as quickly find an explicit {{solution to the}} instance. To {{find a solution to}} an instance s, choose one of the Boolean variables x that is input to s, and make two smaller instances s0 and s1 where s'i denotes the formula formed by replacing x with the constant i. Once these two smaller instances have been constructed, apply the test for solvability to each of them. If one of these two tests returns that the smaller instance is satisfiable, continue solving that instance until a complete solution has been derived.|$|E
25|$|A {{consequence}} of sensitivity to initial conditions is <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> {{start with a}} limited amount of information about the system (as is usually the case in practice), then beyond a certain time the system is no longer predictable. This is most familiar in the case of weather, which is generally predictable only about a week ahead. Of course, {{this does not mean that}} we cannot say anything about events far in the future; some restrictions on the system are present. With weather, we know that the temperature will not naturally reach 100°C or fall to -130°C on earth (during the current geologic era), but we can't say exactly what day will have the hottest temperature of the year.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{suppose we}} wish to sample people from a long street that starts in a poor area (house No. 1) and ends in an {{expensive}} district (house No. 1000). A simple random selection of addresses from this street could easily end up with too many from the high end and too few from the low end (or vice versa), leading to an unrepresentative sample. Selecting (e.g.) every 10th street number along the street ensures that the sample is spread evenly {{along the length of}} the street, representing all of these districts. (Note <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> always start at house #1 and end at #991, the sample is slightly biased towards the low end; by randomly selecting the start between #1 and #10, this bias is eliminated.|$|E
