5|$|The {{architecture}} of <b>the</b> <b>layer</b> pyramid {{allows it to}} be securely dated to the time span between the reigns of king Sekhemkhet and that of king Snofru, {{the founder of the}} 4th Dynasty. Rainer Stadelmann, Miroslav Verner and Jean-Philippe Lauer compare the {{architecture of}} <b>the</b> <b>layer</b> pyramid with that of the step pyramids of Djoser and Sekhemkhet, expecting <b>the</b> <b>layer</b> pyramid to have originally consisted of five steps, just as its near-contemporary predecessors. <b>The</b> <b>layer</b> pyramid exhibits at one site both complex developments concerning its substructures and simplifications concerning the building methods employed for the superstructure. According to these egyptologists, <b>the</b> <b>layer</b> pyramid is a clearly advanced version of the buried pyramid of Sekhemkhet.|$|E

5|$|Only {{two large}} mastaba tombs can be {{securely}} dated into Khaba's reign. The {{first one is}} known as Mastaba Z500, which is located at Zawyet el'Aryan. It lies around 200m north of <b>the</b> <b>Layer</b> Pyramid and has a south-north-orientation. The mastaba ist made of mudbricks, its outer wall is niched and it contains only two large chambers without any typical tomb architecture elements. Because of this, Egyptologists such as Nabil Swelim believe that Mastaba Z500 {{was in fact a}} mortuary temple, belonging to the funerary complex of <b>the</b> <b>Layer</b> Pyramid. The datation of the building into Khaba's reign is based on numerous diorite and dolomite vessels and mud seal fragments, bearing the serekh name of king Khaba.|$|E
5|$|The {{disposition}} of the substructures of <b>the</b> <b>layer</b> pyramid is extremely similar to that found in the Buried Pyramid of Sekhemket. Consequently, Mark Lehner and others suggest that the two pyramids must have been constructed very close in time.|$|E
40|$|We find {{a mapping}} of <b>the</b> <b>layered</b> sine-Gordon model to an {{equivalent}} gas of topological excitations {{and determine the}} long-range interaction potentials of the topological defects.

5|$|The {{remaining}} problem about <b>the</b> <b>layer</b> pyramid is {{the question}} of who had it built. Most scholars today believe that it was likely king Khaba of the late 3rd Dynasty. This conclusion is based on stone bowls and vases bearing the serekh of Khaba discovered in Mastaba Z500, located just north of the pyramid. Rainer Stadelmann goes further and identifies Khaba with king Huni, the last ruler of the 3rd Dynasty. His hypothesis is based on his reading of the Turin canon, a kinglist compiled in the early Ramesside period c. 1300 BC, some 1400 years after Huni's lifetime. The Turin canon credits Huni with a relatively long reign of 24 years. According to Stadelmann, this time would be sufficient to cover the time span needed to complete the building of <b>the</b> <b>layer</b> pyramid. He also argues that royal monuments of the first three Egyptian dynasties only present a king's horus name in a serekh and only later do they record the throne or birth name. Thus, the serekh of Khaba could correspond to the throne name Huni. In this case, <b>the</b> <b>layer</b> pyramid would be Huni's tomb. This conclusion is contested by most Egyptologists who think that Huni instead built the Meidum Pyramid, point to the apparent unfinished state of <b>the</b> <b>layer</b> pyramid and identify Khaba with king Hudjefa II mentioned on the Turin canon.|$|E
5|$|The viscous {{nature of}} airflow reduces the local {{velocities}} on a surface and {{is responsible for}} skin friction. <b>The</b> <b>layer</b> of air over the wing's surface that is slowed down or stopped by viscosity, is the boundary layer.

In this state, there are no distinct liquid and gas phases—hydrogen {{is said to be}} in a supercritical fluid state. It is convenient to treat hydrogen as gas in the upper layer extending downward from the cloud layer to a depth of about 1,000km, and as liquid in deeper layers. Physically, there is no clear boundary—the gas smoothly becomes hotter and denser as one descends.|$|E

5|$|Khaba is {{commonly}} {{thought to have}} built <b>the</b> <b>Layer</b> Pyramid, located at Zawyet el'Aryan, about 8km south-west of Giza. The pyramid's construction is typical of Third Dynasty masonry with mudbricks arranged in layers around a core made of rough blocks from the local bedrock. The pyramid was planned to be about 42 to 45 meters tall, but is now only 17 meters. It is unclear whether part of the pyramid has been eroded over time or its construction was never finished. While there are no inscriptions directly relating the pyramid to Khaba, his serekh appears on stone bowls that were discovered in a nearby mastaba, known as Mastaba Z500.|$|E
5|$|King Khaba is {{considered}} to be difficult to assess as a figure of ancient Egypt. His name is archaeologically well-attested by stone bowls and mud seal impressions. Khaba's reign is securely dated to the Third Dynasty. Because of the contradictions within Ramesside king lists and the lack of contemporary, festive inscriptions, his exact chronological position within the dynasty remains disputed. These problems originate in part from contradictory king lists, which were all compiled long after Khaba's death, especially during the Ramesside era. It is also a matter of debate as to where Khaba might have been buried. Many Egyptologists and archaeologists propose that an unfinished step pyramid at Zawyet el'Aryan, known as <b>the</b> <b>Layer</b> Pyramid, belongs to him. Others believe instead that his tomb is a large mastaba close to <b>the</b> <b>Layer</b> Pyramid, where numerous stone vessels bearing Khaba's serekh have been found.|$|E
5|$|On {{the inner}} {{surface of the}} nasal section of skull are ridges called nasoturbinals, which may have {{supported}} cartilage that increased {{the area of the}} olfactory epithelium, <b>the</b> <b>layer</b> of tissue that detects odors.
