5|$|At 02:00 on 13 June the 13th/18th Royal Hussars {{squadron}} {{arrived at}} 'C' Company's {{position at the}} crossroads, later followed by fifty-one men from the 22nd Independent Parachute Company. Bréville was now in British control again {{for the third time}} since the landings on 6 June. But not in <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>to</b> defend against a German counter-attack, so the 1st Battalion Royal Ulster Rifles, part of the 6th Airlanding Brigade, was moved into the village to take over from the survivors of the attack.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the {{original}} clock was moved from its location near 42nd Street, {{and the building}} where the sign had been mounted was demolished so One Bryant Park could be built. An updated model was installed one block away {{on the side of}} a Durst building at 1133 Avenue of the Americas, facing Sixth Avenue near the southeast corner of the intersection with West 44th Street. The new clock is located next to an Internal Revenue Service office. The new clock, which can run backward, is outfitted with a brighter seven-segment display with multiple LEDs per segment, allowing <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>to</b> be read more easily.|$|E
5|$|Psychological {{studies found}} that {{individuals}} with little mathematics education tend to estimate quantities logarithmically, that is, they position a number on an unmarked line according to its logarithm, so that 10 is positioned as close to 100 as 100 is to 1000. Increasing education shifts this to a linear estimate (positioning 1000 10x as far away) in some circumstances, while logarithms are used when <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>to</b> be plotted are difficult to plot linearly.|$|E

5|$|Rousseau hiked to {{the radio}} tower and changed the message from <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>to</b> a repeating {{distress}} call. Three days later, Rousseau {{gave birth to a}} daughter, Alexandra. One week after Alex's birth, Benjamin Linus (Michael Emerson) came and took Alex from Rousseau. Ben told Rousseau that the child would be safe with them, and that she was lucky for being left alive. Before leaving, Ben tells her that if she hears whispers, she should run the other way. After this, Rousseau began setting traps in the jungle with the hope of catching one of the people responsible for Alex's kidnapping.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the burial}} was first {{reported}} in the press, there had been doubts as to its veracity and scope, leading to it being frequently dismissed as an urban legend. In either case the event had become a cultural icon and {{a reminder of the}} North American video game crash of 1983; it was the end result of a disastrous fiscal year which saw Atari, Inc. sold off by its parent company Warner Communications. Though it was believed that millions of copies of E.T. were disposed of in the landfill, Atari officials later verified <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>to</b> be around 700,000 cartridges of various titles, including E.T.|$|E
5|$|CSU updated their {{forecast}} on June 1 {{to include}} 14 named storms, 6 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes to include Tropical Storm Bonnie. It was again updated on July 1 to include 15 named storms, 6 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes, to accommodate for tropical storms Colin and Danielle. On July 5, TSR released their fourth forecast for the season, slightly lowering the predicted numbers to 16 tropical storms, 8 hurricanes and 3 major hurricanes. On August 5, TSR released their final forecast for the season, lowering <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>to</b> 15 named storms and 7 hurricanes {{due to the}} influence that La Niña being less than anticipated previously.

5|$|Falk, Heine, Takemura, Zhang and Hsu {{investigated}} {{the validity of}} implicit self-esteem measures to assess cultural differences. They subjected Canadian and Japanese participants {{to a series of}} tests, one of which was rating <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>to</b> 40 by how much participants liked them. Because the researchers saw little to no correlation between the various implicit self-esteem measures, they did not draw any conclusions about cultural differences. Stieger and Krizan explored cross-cultural differences in number preferences, specifically the day on which Christmas is celebrated as a contributor to number preference. They asked participants from six countries to rate numbers between 1 and 36. They found that in countries where gifts are exchanged on 24 December participants disproportionately preferred the number 24, whereas in countries that do this on 25 December participants preferred 25. They concluded that cultural influences need {{to be taken into account}} if these preferences are used to reflect individual differences.|$|E
5|$|Later {{that same}} year, Khánh became {{involved}} in a power struggle with his deputy Khiêm as well as Minh, who had been retained as the titular head of state. Thảo {{was a close friend}} of Khiêm, so when Khánh prevailed in the power struggle, Khánh despatched Khiêm to Washington as the ambassador with Thảo was his press attaché. In August 1964, Khánh's leadership became increasingly troubled after he tried to augment his powers by declaring a state of emergency. This only provoked large-scale protests and riots calling for an end to military rule, with Buddhist activists at the forefront. Fearful of losing power, Khánh began making concessions to the protesters and promised democracy in the near future, which encouraged more groups to demand changes, and Khánh demoted certain Catholic pro-Diệm supporters. On 13 September, a Catholic-dominated group led by Generals Lâm Văn Phát and Dương Văn Đức, both of whom had been demoted, moved troops into Saigon but then withdrew after it became obvious they did not have <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>to</b> remove Khánh. Khiêm and Thảo were implicated in helping to plot Phát and Đức's attempted putsch; both were sent abroad by Khánh.|$|E
5|$|While it was {{possibly}} an overstatement {{to describe the}} 1975 position as a choice between evils, neither {{of the two major}} political groupings reached the 15 October 1975 crunch position with completely clean hands.

25|$|Binary search, a {{decrease}} and conquer algorithm where the subproblems are of {{roughly half the}} original size, has a long history. While a clear description of the algorithm on computers appeared in 1946 in an article by John Mauchly, {{the idea of using}} a sorted list of items to facilitate searching dates back {{at least as far as}} Babylonia in 200BC. Another ancient decrease and conquer algorithm is the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor of two numbers by reducing <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>to</b> smaller and smaller equivalent subproblems, which dates to several centuries BC.|$|E

25|$|In 1225, Fibonacci was {{challenged}} {{to find a}} construction for triples of square numbers that are equally spaced from each other, forming an arithmetic progression, and for the spacing between these numbers, which he called a congruum. One way of describing Fibonacci's solution is that <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>to</b> be squared are the difference of legs, hypotenuse, and sum of legs of a Pythagorean triangle, and that the congruum is four times {{the area of the}} same triangle. In his later work on the congruum problem, published in The Book of Squares, Fibonacci observed that it is impossible for a congruum to be a square number itself, but did not present a satisfactory proof of this fact.|$|E
25|$|The two armies first clashed in mid-July 684 at {{the plain}} of Marj al-Suffar, and the Qays were pushed towards Marj Rahit. Twenty days of skirmishing {{between the two}} camps followed, until the final battle took place on 18 August. The numbers of the two opponents are uncertain: al-Tabari puts Marwan's forces at 6,000, another {{tradition}} at 13,000 and 30,000 for Marwan and al-Dahhak respectively, while Ibn Khayyat inflates <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>to</b> 30,000 and 60,000 respectively. The traditions agree, however, that the Umayyad forces were considerably outnumbered. Marwan's commanders were Abbas ibn Ziyad, Amr ibn Sa'id al-As and Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad (another tradition has Ubayd Allah commanding the cavalry and Malik ibn Hubayra al-Sakuni the infantry), while only one of al-Dahhak's commanders, Ziyad ibn Amr ibn Mu'awiya al-Uqayli, is known.|$|E
