This research applies the concept of lean manufacturing to identity wastes along the value stream to find out non added value activities. In the initial stage, Big Picture Mapping is used to describe the whole stream entirely, than Process Activity Mapping is used to find value added, non value added and necessary-but-non-value added activities, whilst Quality Filter Mapping is used to find the defects of the quality of defect type. In the last stage, <b>Total</b> <b>Product</b> <b>Maintenance</b> (TPM) is applied to minimize defects by means of Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE). The OEE Sensitivity analysis is applied to the operating time, cycle time and defects to find out the most influential factor for the improvement of OEE. The result of this research has identified cycle time as the influential factor that affects the OEE value. The 10 % decrease in cycle time will improve OEE by 10, 20...|$|E

50|$|Graphically, the APL curve can {{be derived}} from the <b>total</b> <b>product</b> curve by drawing secants from the origin that {{intersect}} (cut) the <b>total</b> <b>product</b> curve. The slope of the secant line equals the average product of labor, where the slope = dQ/dL. The slope of the curve at each intersection marks a point on the average product curve. The slope increases until the line reaches a point of tangency with the <b>total</b> <b>product</b> curve. This point marks the maximum average product of labor. It also marks the point where MPL (which is the slope of the <b>total</b> <b>product</b> curve) equals the APL (the slope of the secant). Beyond this point the slope of the secants become progressively smaller as APL declines. The MPL curve intersects the APL curve from above at the maximum point of the APL curve. Thereafter, the MPL curve is below the APL curve.|$|R

40|$|Contemporary <b>product</b> <b>maintenance</b> (including {{preventive}} services, {{repairs and}} upgrading) {{is becoming increasingly}} complex as products become more versatile and inherently complicated and {{as the number of}} available model variants multiplies. Consequently, maintenance is becoming a bottleneck in many engineering systems. This paper discusses a new online <b>product</b> <b>maintenance</b> approach based on augmented reality. According to this approach, graphical maintenance instruction and animation sequences are pre-coded (in VRML) at the design stage for typical procedures. These sequences are then transmitted upon request and virtually overlaid on the real <b>product</b> at the <b>maintenance</b> site, where and when they are needed. The instructions are conditional and adjust automatically to conditions at the maintenance site, according to input from the machine and updated knowledge at the manufacturer. This approach can alleviate much of the information overload and training required from maintenance personnel. Moreover, it can improve maintenance procedure efficiency by bringing updated expert knowledge to the field. This paper discusses the concept, function and components of the system and reports preliminary results of a nonimmersive implementation.

40|$|<b>Total</b> <b>product</b> quality {{involves}} three strongly inter-related {{notions of}} quality - (i) quality of performance, (ii) {{quality of conformance}} and (iii) quality of service (repairs during post-sale period). As such, study of <b>total</b> <b>product</b> quality requires a framework which integrates the actions of manufacturer and retailer {{and their impact on}} the different dimensions of <b>total</b> <b>product</b> quality. We develop a general game-theoretic model for such a study. For a special case, we derive the optimal manufacturer and retailer actions and discuss various structural, and economic implications of the model such as the inverse relationships between (i) quality of service and quality of performance and (ii) quality of service and retail price.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis was to define the {{manufacturing}} process of a camera application with included optics and its integration with electronics and verify the process information by Volvo Car Corporation’s (VCC’s) cost model and using it to calculate the <b>total</b> <b>product</b> cost. The method used to fulfill the purpose was divided into three phases, understanding the product, creating process maps and performing a cost calculation. By the use of literature studies, observations and interviews, necessary data needed to perform a cost calculation was included in specific process maps. The data was then used as input for VCC’s cost model to calculate the <b>total</b> <b>product</b> cost. By analyzing gathered information using the methods described above, three specific process maps with necessary data were created. These were a process map of lens manufacturing, a process map of lens barrel assembly and a process map of final assembly. When calculating the cost of all the components, {{the cost of the}} lenses was estimated using the specific lens manufacturing process. After calculating the cost of all the ingoing components, the cost of the lens barrel assembly was calculated. This cost was then used to calculate the cost of the final assembly with all ingoing components. The results showed that the <b>total</b> <b>product</b> cost was 72 €, the cost distribution showed that the lenses were the most expensive component constituting for approximately 72 % of the <b>total</b> <b>product</b> cost. When presenting information about the cost distribution of each process within lens manufacturing, it could be seen that the polishing process was the most costly operation of all. Due to lenses being the most expensive component in the product, it was recommended to do further research within optical manufacturing and to review the product requirements and specification regarding the optical system {{in order to reduce the}} <b>total</b> <b>product</b> cost...|$|R
