5|$|Before {{the opening}} of Melbourne Airport, Melbourne's main airport was Essendon Airport which was officially {{designated}} an international airport in 1950. In <b>the</b> <b>mid-1950s,</b> over 10,000 passengers were using Essendon Airport and the limitations of Essendon Airport were beginning to become apparent. Essendon Airport's facilities were insufficient to meet the increasing demand for air travel; the runways were too short to handle the then new jet airliners and the terminals failed to handle the increase in passengers, by <b>the</b> <b>mid-1950s,</b> an international overflow terminal was built in a new northern hangar. Due to the encroachment of the urban boundary, the airport had become surrounded by residential housing, meaning that expansion of Essendon Airport was not possible.|$|E

That same year, he played the role of stuffy English butler Arthur Pinkney in two episodes of The Beverly Hillbillies. Pinkney mistakenly believed the hillbillies were the domestic servants of the family by whom he was hired, while the hillbillies believed Pinkney was a boarder at their Beverly Hills mansion.|$|R
50|$|An early {{example of}} the Gallic ganster film is Maurice Tourneur’s 1935 film Justin de Marseille set in Marseille. Tourneur's gangster-hero differentiates from his American {{equivalent}} by valuing honour, artisanship, community and solidarity. Four years before {{of the rise of}} film noir, in 1937, Julien Duvivier creates Pépé le Moko, a French gangster film in the style of poetic realism that takes place in the Casbah. Its distribution in America was blocked by the US-makers of its 1938 remake Algiers. French gangster films will appear again in <b>the</b> <b>mid-1950's,</b> most notably Jacques Becker's Touchez pas au grisbi, American blacklisted filmmaker Jules Dassin's Rififi and Jean-Pierre Melville's Bob le flambeur.|$|R

5|$|The Silver Age {{marked a}} decline in the {{prominence}} of American comics in genres such as horror, romance, teen and furry animal humor, or westerns, which were more popular than superhero adventures in the late 1940s through <b>the</b> <b>mid-1950s,</b> and fans of these genres see the Silver Age as a decline from that earlier era.|$|E

2500|$|Because of such statements, some adherents {{believe that}} {{caffeine}} is officially prohibited under the Word of Wisdom. In <b>the</b> <b>mid-1950's,</b> <b>the</b> {{director of the}} food services for Brigham Young University, a college owned by the LDS Church, decided not to sell caffeine on campus. [...] This changed in September 2017 when the current director of BYU Dining Services announced that caffeinated beverages would be sold on campus. Wright said this {{was the result of}} a change in customer preferences. Official church publications have occasionally published articles by medical practitioners that warn of the health risks of consuming caffeine. However, in November 2010, the Salt Lake Tribune noted that in the 2010 church Handbook, which sets out the official position of the church on health and social issues, no position on drinking Coca-Cola or caffeinated drinks is included. The Salt Lake Tribune concluded that the church [...] "takes no official position on caffeine".|$|R
5|$|The Silver Age of Comic Books was {{a period}} of artistic {{advancement}} and commercial success in mainstream American comic books, predominantly those in the superhero genre. Following the Golden Age of Comic Books and an interregnum in <b>the</b> early to <b>mid-1950s,</b> <b>the</b> Silver Age is considered to cover the period from 1956 to circa 1970, and was succeeded by the Bronze and Modern Ages.|$|R
5000|$|Douglas Park Public School was {{a public}} {{elementary}} school located at {{the east end of}} Lanor Ave on the north east corner of the 14 acre property shared with Alderwood Collegiate Institute.

5|$|Tristano started {{teaching}} music, especially improvisation, {{in the early}} 1940s, and by <b>the</b> <b>mid-1950s</b> was concentrating on teaching in preference to performing. He taught in a structured and disciplined manner, which was unusual in jazz education when he began. His educational role over three decades meant that he exerted an influence on jazz through his students, including saxophonists Lee Konitz and Warne Marsh.|$|E
5|$|Until <b>the</b> <b>mid-1950s</b> in Britain {{the blues}} {{was seen as}} a form of folk music. When Broonzy toured England he played a folk blues set to fit British {{expectations}} of American blues, rather than his current electric Chicago blues. Skiffle clubs included the ‘Ballad and Blues’ club in a pub in Soho, co-founded by Ewan MacColl. In its early stages these clubs saw the playing of British and American folk music that included folk blues. As the skiffle craze subsided from <b>the</b> <b>mid-1950s</b> many of these clubs, following the lead of MacColl, began to shift towards the performance of English traditional folk material, partly as a reaction to the growth of American dominated pop and rock n’ roll music, often banning American music from performances and became more exclusively English folk clubs.|$|E
5|$|Adkins grew up {{in poverty}} {{in the midst of}} the Depression, and his spirited, unusual {{lifestyle}} is reflected in his music. His songs, which he began recording and distributing locally in <b>the</b> <b>mid-1950s,</b> explored an affinity for sexual intercourse, and decapitation, and were obscure outside of West Virginia until the 1980s. The newfound popularity secured him a cult following, spawned the Norton Records label, and helped usher in the genre known as psychobilly.|$|E
50|$|Another {{point of}} note was that, {{during a period}} of {{relative}} austerity in <b>the</b> early to <b>mid-1950s,</b> <b>the</b> BBC chose to locate The Flower Pot Men in what was plainly a prosperous and leafy suburban or semi-rural area. In changing times since the Second World War, most “ordinary” people would neither have employed nor have been able to afford a gardener - if, indeed, they had a garden.|$|R
5000|$|Accelerated {{studies have}} been in use since at least <b>the</b> <b>mid-1950's,</b> at least for {{biological}} reference materials. Typically, CRMs are monitored at a range of temperatures {{and the results are}} used to predict the rate of change at a proposed, usuallu low, storage temperature. Often, the prediction uses a well known degradation model such as an Arrhenius model. The advantage over real-time studies is that results are available sooner and predictions of stability over a much longer period than the stability study can be defended. For some applications, accelerated {{studies have been}} described as the only practical approach: [...] In the absence of a reference method or a higher order standard, ... accelerated studies under stress conditions provide the only approach for assessment of stability World Health Organisation ...|$|R
5000|$|The FE's thinwall casting {{production}} method was innovative and forward-looking in <b>the</b> <b>mid-1950,</b> resulting in lower weight and dramatically reduced production costs. Ford's competitors {{at the time}} required thicker castings to mask the flaws and defects that resulted from their processes. Improving quality and allowing thinner walls was accomplished through many engineering improvements, including {{reducing the number of}} cores required to cast an engine block. Fewer cores made it easier to assemble the overall mold for casting and reduced the number of potential problems. [...] In the late 1980s when both Ford and GM revamped their V8 offerings, many of the FE's designs and engineering were incorporated in the new engines, including the deep skirt, cross-bolting of the mains and thinwall casting.|$|R
