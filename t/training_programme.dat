40|$|Purpose and objectives: The {{purpose of}} the study is to {{investigate}} the various types of focused <b>training</b> <b>programmes</b> that should be designed for eliminating or preventing small business growth problems. To help achieve this main objective, the following secondary goals are identified : To highlight the role and nature of entrepreneurial training. To identify possible focused <b>training</b> <b>programmes</b> for solving very small business problems. To determine how <b>training</b> <b>programmes</b> should be structured to target very small business growth problems. To explore which other method(s), besides <b>training</b> <b>programmes</b> could be uitilised for solving very small black business entrepreneurs' growth problems. To provide trainers with guidelines in designing focused <b>training</b> <b>programmes</b> for solving very small business problems. Problem investigated: South African entrepreneurs have a poor skills record, which inhibits small business growth. The needs of a business changes as the business grows, resulting in growing pains for the very small business entrepreneur. Successful entrepreneurs are not necessarily academically inclined and often learn in a more dynamic, non-linear environment, therefore various specific focused <b>training</b> <b>programmes</b> need to be designed that can assist very small business entrepreneurs in eliminating or preventing small business growth problems. Methodology: A qualitative study was done, in which an empirical survey was conducted by means of a series of in-depth interviews with ten very small black business entrepreneurs. Findings: The empirical results identified seven types of <b>training</b> <b>programmes</b> focusing on financial management computer training, operations management, people management, marketing management, management and investment management. Other <b>training</b> <b>programmes</b> indicated were stress management, time management and security management. Within each of these types of <b>training</b> <b>programmes</b> specific focus areas were identified. Value of the research: The value of the research {{lies in the fact that}} specific focus areas were identified within the <b>training</b> <b>programmes.</b> Other studies have attempted to identify <b>training</b> <b>programmes</b> but the content thereof was not necessarily linked to the problems that very small businesses experienced, especially when attempting to grow. Time-, staff- and financial constraints regarding <b>training</b> <b>programmes</b> can be overcome. Conclusions: <b>Training</b> <b>programmes</b> should focus on specific training areas, be after hours and be well publicised. Computer training should preferably be on site on a one-to-one basis. <b>Training</b> <b>programmes</b> should suit the skills level of the very small business entrepreneurs and be broken up into smaller sessions to ensure understanding and meeting time constraints. </p...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MBA) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2012 Effective {{training}} {{is an investment}} in the human resources of an organisation, with both immediate and long-term benefits. Researching the effectiveness of training in tourism organisations in South Africa has not received much attention. The purpose of this quantitative study was to evaluate the perceived effectiveness of <b>training</b> <b>programmes</b> attended by employees located at the head office of the North West Parks and Tourism Board in South Africa. The levels of perceived training effectiveness has been proxied by the levels of overall satisfaction with <b>training</b> <b>programmes</b> participated by employees. The study also {{emphasized the importance of}} training as an important human resource development which is the present clay competitive model, Obsolescence among employees and the need to cope with the technological, organisational and social changes make continuous learning and updating of skills indispensable at the North West Parks and Tourism Board, in particular, and other organisation, in general. To address the stated study objectives, employees located at the head office of the North West Parks and Tourism Board received and completed a quantitative survey questionnaire. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. First and foremost, alpha analysis was used in order to judge the reliability of the data and the statistical significance of the measures of effectiveness. The results showed a high level of reliability in the data. Further results demonstrated that most employees found the <b>training</b> <b>programmes</b> they have attended to be relevant to their jobs, the trainers had been competent, <b>training</b> <b>programmes</b> participated have been interesting, <b>training</b> <b>programmes</b> participated have generally been useful, specific skills were learnt from participating in those <b>training</b> <b>programmes,</b> by participating in those <b>training</b> <b>programmes</b> their job performance has improved, {{they have been able to}} practise what they gained from participating in those <b>training</b> <b>programmes,</b> and employees f elt more effective in doing their job after participating in those <b>training</b> <b>programmes.</b> Chi-square tests were also carried out in order to analyze whether there is any association between the perceived levels of effectiveness of <b>training</b> <b>programmes</b> and some important constructs- personal elements, training environment, work environment, and perceived values and derived benefits of training. The results from analyzing the background elements did not reveal any associations with the overall levels of satisfaction with <b>training</b> <b>programmes</b> respondents have participated, which proxies the levels of effectiveness of <b>training</b> <b>programmes</b> participated by respondents. Only two physical comfort items of training environment were found to has significant relationship with the effectiveness of training programmes- the level of accessibility of training facilities at training centres and that the level of pleasantness of physical environment during training sessions. None of the training centre control items was found any significant association with the effectiveness of <b>training</b> <b>programmes</b> while none of the three items of work environment was also found to have a significant association with the effectiveness of <b>training</b> <b>programmes.</b> The results also showed no significant relationship between the level of effectiveness of <b>training</b> <b>programmes</b> attended and the level of agreement to the statement that respondents' supervisors are never interested to know what their staff learn at training and the level of effectiveness of <b>training</b> <b>programmes</b> attended, the level of agreement to the statement that supervisors encouraged them to participate in <b>training</b> <b>programmes,</b> and the level of agreement to the statement that resources are always provided so they could apply and practise what they learn. Of the nine items on the perceived values and derived benefits of training, only two were found to have significant associations with the effectiveness of <b>training</b> <b>programmes</b> - the level of improvement respondents have had after participating in <b>training</b> <b>programmes</b> and the ability to practise on the job those skills learned from participating in <b>training</b> <b>programmes.</b> Master...|$|R

This is {{for the purpose of}} ascertaining the relevance of workers ` <b>training</b> <b>programmes,</b> as an alternative approach to human capital formation, to industrial strike reduction among industrial workers in Nigeria. A total of 230 respondents were selected for the study using stratified sampling technique to reflect the two strata of public and private organizations. Two sets of questionnaire, with three subscales, titled ‘Workers <b>Training</b> <b>Programmes</b> Scale (WTPS) and Industrial Strike Reduction Scale (CRS) were used for data collection. All the hypothesized research questions were examined using Regression Analysis and t-test statistical methods at 0. 05 alpha levels. The finding revealed that workers ` <b>training</b> <b>programmes</b> (taken together) had significantly influenced industrial strike reduction among industrial workers.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between minority languages and translator <b>training</b> <b>programmes</b> {{is a very}} new and under-researched area of inquiry in Translation Studies. The People‘s Republic of China, which has 55 different minorities within its borders, is an ideal country in which to examine this issue. This paper focuses on the Tibetan language, one of the minority languages in China for which translator <b>training</b> <b>programmes</b> are available. The paper first provides {{a brief overview of}} translator <b>training</b> <b>programmes</b> in China in general, and then examines the situation of Tibetan-Chinese <b>training</b> <b>programmes</b> in Tibet and other parts of China, linking these to the job market for translators in these regions. The paper then explores a unique parallel development outside of China of Tibetan-English translator <b>training</b> <b>programmes</b> that have been established for students of Tibetan Buddhism who wish to train as interpreters or translators. The contrast of these two widely differing sets of <b>training</b> <b>programmes</b> reveals the divergent market forces at work that spur the development of such programmes, and also highlights the role that translator programmes may play in the survival of lesser-used languages...|$|R

5|$|By late 1940 {{there were}} severe {{shortages}} of pilots and wireless operators/gunners, with 100 pilots and 200 other personnel required. In {{the short term}} the OTU course was reduced to get the crews out to operational commands faster. It now took no longer than a month compared with the {{six to eight weeks}} considered necessary. This reduced the number of fit pilots, and the quality of pilots overall. The number of unfit pilots was recorded at 374. To cope with the shortening of training, it had to have a well-stocked general <b>training</b> <b>programme.</b> Coastal Command did not possess such an administration. Only 24 pupils were graduating when the minimum requirement was 64. This was compensated by the removal of gunnery and bombing training and a reduction in night and formation flying. Still, Bomber Command received most of the 36,000 aircrew between 1940 and 1942. Entry requirements for crews were relaxed and the programmes found more recruits that way. Manpower was also supplemented by the Commonwealth with Canada providing some of the 6,500 personnel sought by the Air Ministry. By the end of 1941, the operational strength of Coastal Command increased by seven squadrons.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{political}} pressure, the MoD continued to lack confidence in UNAMSIL leadership. Thus, the British government refused to place combat troops under UN command, but did second additional staff officers to UNAMSIL, to the UN headquarters in New York, {{and to the}} SLA. The officers attached to UNAMSIL were tasked with assisting its commanders in planning and mounting operations and were led by a brigadier who became UNAMSIL's chief of staff, while in New York, the officers attached to UN headquarters provided planning support for logistics operations to bring UNAMSIL up to its mandated strength. At the same time, {{the focus of the}} British <b>training</b> <b>programme</b> shifted. Although six battalions had been trained, the SLA still lacked many combat support functions as well as command and control capabilities. The STTTs set out to improve the SLA's capabilities in these areas by providing the next set of recruits with more specialised training in addition to basic infantry training provided to the first intake. The British trainers also constructed an operations room at the SLA's headquarters and provided other support to improve the SLA's communications and logistical capabilities.|$|E

It was in Egypt that {{the regiment}}, and brigade, came under command of the newly formed New Zealand and Australian Division which, along with the 1st Division, made up the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC). In April 1915, the division's infantry units left Egypt for an undisclosed destination, and it was not until 1 May that the regiment learned about the Gallipoli landings. Four days later the regiment received news that it would also deploy to Gallipoli, but in a dismounted role without their horses. On 7 May, twenty-six officers and 482 other ranks (some men remaining behind to look after their horses) boarded trains for Alexandria to board their transports. They arrived off the Gallipoli peninsula on 12 May, and started to disembark, landing at Anzac Cove. By now the troops had been re-equipped for their dismounted role, and carried a rifle with two hundred rounds of ammunition, a small pack, a haversack, mess tins, a bayonet, and an entrenching tool. Once ashore, the regiment camped that night behind the front line.|$|E
5|$|Model {{spent the}} first year of World War II as a chief of staff, first of IV Corps during the {{invasion}} of Poland, and then of Sixteenth Army during the Battle of France. He was promoted to lieutenant general (Generalleutnant) in April 1940, and earned his first senior command posting in November that year, when he was assigned to lead the 3rd Panzer Division. He immediately proceeded to ignore all formalities of organization and command, which endeared him to his men and exasperated his staff—who often had {{to clean up the mess}} he left behind. He also instituted a combined arms <b>training</b> <b>programme</b> where his men were thrown together in various ad-hoc groupings regardless of their parent unit: tankers would train with infantry, engineers with recon units, and so on. Model thus anticipated by some months the regular German use of Kampfgruppen in World War II. While this would become routine later on, it was still not a universal practice in the Wehrmacht in late 1940 and early 1941.|$|E
