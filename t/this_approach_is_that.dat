5|$|According to critics, the {{inherent}} problem with <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it relied heavily upon {{an assumption that}} Michelangelo only painted buon fresco, that he was always satisfied with the result {{at the end of}} the day, and that in four and a half years spent on the ceiling, he stuck exclusively to one approach, and never made small alterations or added details. Arguimbau, on his website, quotes Colalucci, the head of the team, as contradicting himself on this matter.|$|E
5|$|Universal supports. In a more recent, more convenient, {{and more}} widely used method, the {{synthesis}} {{starts with the}} universal support where a non-nucleosidic linker {{is attached to the}} solid support material (compounds 1 and 2). A phosphoramidite respective to the 3'-terminal nucleoside residue is coupled to the universal solid support in the first synthetic cycle of oligonucleotide chain assembly using the standard protocols. The chain assembly is then continued until the completion, after which the solid support-bound oligonucleotide is deprotected. The characteristic feature of the universal solid supports is that the release of the oligonucleotides occurs by the hydrolytic cleavage of a P-O bond that attaches the 3’-O of the 3’-terminal nucleotide residue to the universal linker as shown in Scheme 6. The critical advantage of <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the same solid support is used irrespectively of the sequence of the oligonucleotide to be synthesized. For the complete removal of the linker and the 3'-terminal phosphate from the assembled oligonucleotide, the solid support 1 and several similar solid supports require gaseous ammonia, aqueous ammonium hydroxide, aqueous methylamine, or their mixture and are commercially available. The solid support 2 requires a solution of ammonia in anhydrous methanol and is also commercially available.|$|E
25|$|A final {{advantage}} of <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{it allows for}} natural direct descriptions {{of many of the}} fundamental objects of study to differential geometry and topology.|$|E
50|$|In summary, {{the main}} {{benefits}} of <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> it <b>is</b> easy to implement, low cost, {{and does not}} require special hardware modification. Software designers can benefit from this model by having a quick power estimate for their applications without any extra hardware requirement.|$|R
25|$|The key {{constraint}} in <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it {{had limited}} traction {{because of the}} single driver. These locomotives were equally characterized by both axles, powered or unpowered, being of equal size. Even though the locomotive had the 2-2-0 designation, the leading axle was unpowered and not a lead truck.|$|R

25|$|A {{major concern}} with <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> NNRTI {{resistance}} mutations are commonly observed in both mothers and infants after single-dose nevirapine, and may compromise {{the response to}} future NNRTI-containing regimens. A short course of maternal zidovudine/lamivudine is recommended by the U.S. Public Health Service Task Force to reduce this risk.|$|E
25|$|The {{downside}} to <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> high-power transmissions are failure-prone devices, {{especially in the}} World War II era. They are also complex and time consuming devices to build and repair. Although it eliminates a second engine, compared to the dual-drive concept, it is still relatively complex compared to the solutions that follow.|$|E
25|$|Unique {{distributions}} of compounds across one or many plates {{can be employed}} either {{to increase the number}} of assays per plate or to reduce the variance of assay results, or both. The simplifying assumption made in <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> any N compounds in the same well will not typically interact with each other, or the assay target, in a manner that fundamentally changes the ability of the assay to detect true hits.|$|E
50|$|The main {{problems}} with <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>are</b> <b>that,</b> {{for the foreseeable}} future, electronic computing elements are faster, smaller, cheaper, and more reliable. Such elements are already smaller than some wavelengths of light. Thus, even waveguide-based optical logic may be uneconomic relative to electronic logic. As of 2016, most development effort is for electronic circuitry.|$|R
5000|$|A second <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> to {{introduce}} explicit forces that work {{to maintain the}} constraint; for example, one could introduce strong spring forces that enforce the distances among mass points within a [...] "rigid" [...] body. The two difficulties of <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> the constraints <b>are</b> not satisfied exactly, and the strong forces may require very short time-steps, making simulations inefficient computationally.|$|R

25|$|Re Hobley adopts the {{unconscionability}} rationale {{such that}} {{the imposition of a}} constructive trust is only justified by unconscionability, therefore there must be detrimental reliance. This would appear to be analogous to the doctrine of estoppel. Another consequence of <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the trust must come into existence before the death of the first testator as otherwise {{the subject matter of the}} trust would be uncertain and could possible be avoided by inter vivos dispositions.|$|E
25|$|The radar-time {{definition}} of extended-simultaneity further facilitates visualization {{of the way}} that acceleration curves spacetime for travelers {{in the absence of any}} gravitating objects. This is illustrated in the figure at right, which shows radar time/position isocontours for events in flat spacetime as experienced by a traveler (red trajectory) taking a constant proper-acceleration roundtrip. One caveat of <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the time and place of remote events are not fully defined until light from such an event is able to reach our traveler.|$|E
25|$|Machinability can {{be based}} on the measure of how long a tool lasts. This can be useful when {{comparing}} materials that have similar properties and power consumptions, but one is more abrasive and thus decreases the tool life. The major downfall with <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> tool life is dependent on more than just the material it is machining; other factors include cutting tool material, cutting tool geometry, machine condition, cutting tool clamping, cutting speed, feed, and depth of cut. Also, the machinability for one tool type cannot be compared to another tool type (i.e. HSS tool to a carbide tool).|$|E
5000|$|Fordism, {{named after}} Henry Ford, is [...] "a model of {{economic}} expansion and technological progress based on mass production: {{the manufacture of}} standardized products in huge volumes using special purpose machinery and unskilled labor".

25|$|An {{association}} {{energy of}} 22-25kJ/mol {{is typical of}} charge-induced dipole interactions, {{and so there is}} interest in the use of charged linkers and metals. The metal–hydrogen bond strength is diminished in MOFs, probably due to charge diffusion, so 2+ and 3+ metal ions are being studied to strengthen this interaction even further. A problem with <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> MOFs with exposed metal surfaces have lower concentrations of linkers; this makes them difficult to synthesize, as they are prone to framework collapse. This may diminish their useful lifetimes as well. Most common strategies to increase this binding energy for MOFs and molecular hydrogen have been reviewed.|$|E
25|$|In sum, {{both systems}} are about 24 minutes per year {{ahead of the}} actual {{tropical}} year; the systems' methods of intercalation fixes only their internal error; and Thandeikta slightly accelerates the annual drift. The accumulating error means the New Year's Day which used to fall near the vernal equinox at its launch in 638 now falls on 17 April in 2013—a drift of 15 days, (after adjusting to the Julian and Gregorian calendar switch). Burmese calendarists {{have dealt with the}} issue by using apparent reckoning and periodically modifying the intercalation schedule in the Metonic cycle. One major downside of <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{it is not possible to}} publish future calendars more than a few years (often even a year) ahead.|$|E
25|$|Another {{issue as}} regards mutual wills is the {{question}} of revocability. In Re Hobley Charles Aldous QC held that there could be either unilateral or mutual revocation provided it occurred during the lifetime of both testators. However, the problem with <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> unilateral revocation is against the general principle of contract. Several explanations for this could be proffered. Firstly, there could be an implicit term that the agreement is revocable. Secondly, it could be conceptually viewed that the agreement takes on the revocable nature of the will to which it relates. Thirdly, as the doctrine is based on detrimental reliance, the agreement only concretized on the death of the other party. Fourthly, one could apply the unconscionability rationale that unjust enrichment could only be complete when one party takes a benefit under the will of the other party.|$|E

25|$|One {{example of}} a 2000s {{consumer}} 3D pointing device is the Wii Remote. While primarily a motion-sensing device (that is, it can determine its orientation and direction of movement), Wii Remote can also detect its spatial position by comparing the distance and position of the lights from the IR emitter using its integrated IR camera (since the nunchuk accessory lacks a camera, it can only tell its current heading and orientation). The obvious drawback to <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it can only produce spatial coordinates while its camera can see the sensor bar. More accurate consumer devices have since been released, including the PlayStation Move, the Razer Hydra and the controllers part of the HTC Vive virtual reality system. All of these devices can accurately detect position and orientation in 3D space regardless of angle relative to the sensor station.|$|E
25|$|A non-trivial {{example of}} {{exploiting}} extra {{assumptions about the}} signal is given by the recent field of compressed sensing, which allows for full reconstruction with a sub-Nyquist sampling rate. Specifically, this applies to signals that are sparse (or compressible) in some domain. As an example, compressed sensing deals with signals that may have a low over-all bandwidth (say, the effective bandwidth EB), but the frequency locations are unknown, rather than all together in a single band, so that the passband technique doesn't apply. In other words, the frequency spectrum is sparse. Traditionally, the necessary sampling rate is thus 2B. Using compressed sensing techniques, the signal could be perfectly reconstructed if it is sampled at a rate slightly lower than 2EB. The downside of <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> reconstruction is no longer given by a formula, but instead by the solution to a convex optimization program which requires well-studied but nonlinear methods.|$|E
25|$|One {{limitation}} of the unlawful trading provisions is {{that the cause of}} action vests solely in the liquidator or administrator, as a matter of statute, unlike for a misfeasance proceeding. While both kinds of action can be pursued concurrently, a fraudulent or wrongful trading case may not be assigned to a third party. In Re Oasis Merchandising Services Ltd the company's former directors sought to challenge a wrongful trading claim because the liquidator had sold the right to sue them to a specialist litigation firm, London Wall Claims. The Court of Appeal held that such an assignment contravened the old common law prohibition on champertous causes, or ones which involve a party in litigation for payment when they have no interest. The disadvantage of <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> liquidators or administrators may be too cautious to bring claims, when a specialist firm could bring them.|$|E

25|$|VNAs {{designed}} for the simultaneous measurement of the S-parameters of networks with more than two ports are feasible but quickly become prohibitively complex and expensive. Usually their purchase is not justified since the required measurements can be obtained using a standard 2-port calibrated VNA with extra measurements followed by the correct interpretation of the results obtained. The required S-parameter matrix can be assembled from successive two port measurements in stages, two ports at a time, on each occasion with the unused ports being terminated in high quality loads equal to the system impedance. One risk of <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the return loss or VSWR of the loads themselves must be suitably specified to be {{as close as possible}} to a perfect 50 Ohms, or whatever the nominal system impedance is.

25|$|A {{criticism}} of <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it is trivial, {{based on the}} trivial observation that mathematics is a human activity. To observe that rigorous proof comes only after unrigorous conjecture, experimentation and speculation is true, but it is trivial and no-one would deny this. So it's {{a bit of a}} stretch to characterize a philosophy of mathematics in this way, on something trivially true. The calculus of Leibniz and Newton was reexamined by mathematicians such as Weierstrass in order to rigorously prove the theorems thereof. There is nothing special or interesting about this, as it fits in with the more general trend of unrigorous ideas which are later made rigorous. There needs to be a clear distinction between the objects of study of mathematics and the study of the objects of study of mathematics. The former doesn't seem to change a great deal; the latter is forever in flux. The latter is what the social theory is about, and the former is what Platonism et al. are about.|$|E
25|$|Some {{governments have}} begun to {{approach}} slums as a possible opportunity to urban development by slum upgrading. This approach was inspired {{in part by the}} theoretical writings of John Turner in 1972. The approach seeks to upgrade the slum with basic infrastructure such as sanitation, safe drinking water, safe electricity distribution, paved roads, rain water drainage system, and bus/metro stops. The assumption behind <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> if slums are given basic services and tenure security – that is, the slum will not be destroyed and slum residents will not be evicted, then the residents will rebuild their own housing, engage their slum community to live better, and over time attract investment from government organizations and businesses. Turner argued to demolish the housing, but to improve the environment: if governments can clear existing slums of unsanitary human waste, polluted water and litter, and from muddy unlit lanes, {{they do not have to}} worry about the shanty housing. Squatters have shown great organizational skills in terms of land management and will maintain the infrastructure that is provided.|$|E
