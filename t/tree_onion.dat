40|$|Aims: Determination {{of genetic}} {{diversity}} among UK Burkholderia cepacia isolates from various environmental niches, principally woodland <b>tree</b> rhizospheres and <b>onions.</b> Methods and Results: Genus determination was made using {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) amplification and fatty acid methyl ester profiling. Genetic diversity was investigated by repetitive sequence genetic PCR fingerprinting. Several onion isolates were similar to clinical isolates but others were diverse. Some environmental isolates were possibly synonymous with B. cepacia and B. gladioli but most from woodland rhizospheres were distinct and clustered together. The 16 S rRNA genes of representatives from these clusters were PCR amplified, sequenced and phylogenetically compared with all known Burkholderia and related species. This revealed that the rhizospheric isolates had closest affinity with Burkholderia spp. with known bioremediative and biocontrol capabilities and were unrelated to taxa comprising plant or human pathogenic strains. Conclusions: All of the analyses investigated revealed that environmental and onion isolates of B. cepacia complex bacteria are genetically diverse but that woodland rhizospheric isolates are {{related to each other}} and unrelated to plant or human pathogenic strains. Significance and Impact of the Study: Woodland rhizospheric isolates of B. cepacia are potentially good candidates for use in bioremediation and biocontrol, as they appear distinct from plant or human pathogenic strains...|$|R
40|$|Top, <b>tree</b> or Egyptian <b>onion,</b> Allium x proliferum (Moench) Schrader, 2 n= 2 x= 16, is a minor, vegetatively {{propagated}} garden crop in Europe, North America and North East Asia. Several clones {{of the top}} onion {{were found}} to be locally cultivated in the region of South Croatia under the name “Ljutika-talijanka”. One of these, clone Biorina, was studied by means of both classical cytogenetic techniques (karyotyping and meiosis) as well as molecular techniques (genomic in situ hybridization, GISH and flow cytometry). Analysis of a Feulgen stained karyotype revealed its pseudodiploid structure, since among 16 chromosomes no homologous pairs could be detected. A high frequency of heteromorphic bivalents, followed by univalents and a rare occurrence of multivalents, was recorded in meiosis in the pollen mother cells. Although bivalents with random chiasmata prevailed, we observed occasional occurrence of the bivalents with localized chiasmata. All pollen degenerates at the one-nucleate stage, resulting in complete pollen sterility. Using GISH, we identified the parental origin of all 16 chromosomes and confirmed the hybrid status of the analyzed clone: 8 longer chromosomes originated from the Allium cepa L. parent, whereas 8 shorter chromosomes originated from the Allium fis- tulosum L. parent. The investigated clone had an intermediate amount of DNA (26. 98 pg DNA/ 2 C) as compared to its parent species, A. cepa (31. 95 pg DNA/ 2 C) and A. fistulosum (21. 62 pg DNA/ 2 C) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{taxonomic study}} was {{conducted}} of 48 isolates of plant pathogenic Stemphylium Wallroth species, all of which produced a Pleospora Rabenhorst perfect state in culture. Specific identification was attempted using gross colony characters and morphological features of the imperfect and perfect states. Only conidial and ascospore features proved to be of taxonomic value. The diagnostic conidial features were shape, dimensions, length/width ratio, number of longitudinal and lateral septa, number of lateral septal constrictions, ornamentations and pigmentation. Ascospore features of taxonomic significance were dimensions, and shape of both juvenile and mature spores. On {{the basis of these}} criteria it was concluded that three Stemphylium species were present, namely Stemphylium botryosum Wallroth, Stemphylium globuliferum (Vestergen) Simmons, and Stemphylium vesicarium (Wallroth) Simmons, each with a corresponding Pleospora state. This cross-pairing had value since identification of form-species allowed reliable prediction of the Pleospora species, and vice-versa. The cultural conditions providing the best expression of conidial features (and thus facilitating separation of Stemphylium species) were 5 % V- 8 agar, pH 7. 5, 20 C and an 8 h photoperiod. Synchronous production of conidia was induced with an injury technique and ascostromata were matured most rapidly at either 12 C or a diurnal temperature regime of 8 h at 16 C/ 16 h at 8 C. A taxonomic survey of 166 Stemphylium isolates from 12 host species revealed the three previously mentioned species and a further undescribed species. The latter was isolated from annual phlox and was characterized by exceptionally large ascospores. S. vesicarium was by far the most common species, occurring on asparagus, chrysanthemum, blue lupin, Russell lupin, <b>tree</b> lupin, <b>onion,</b> pepper and tomato. The legumes were hosts of more than one species; lucerne for instance was a host for S. botryosum, S. globuliferum and S. vesicarium, while Russell lupin and tree lupin were only infected by S. botryosum. and S. vesicarium. By contrast, lettuce and carnation were only infected by S. botryosum. Cross-pathogenicity tests indicated that host specialization was relatively uncommon. S. botryosum from lettuce and the Stemphylium sp. from annual phlox were the only isolates exhibiting host specificity. The results of ultrastructural studies of conidiogenesis, the phenomenon of vegetative reversion of conidiophores and juvenile conidia, and the mechanism of ascospore release in Pleospora are discussed. A previously undescribed, saprophytic, chain-forming species of Stemphylium is also described...|$|R
40|$|Groundnut, Arachis hypogaea (L.), can be {{attacked}} by a range of pathogens, including Aspergillus species, which can cause accumulation of the mycotoxin aflatoxin. Although some success in controlling this pathogen has been achieved with application of fungicides, their use is not always feasible in developing nations like Nigeria. The {{aim of this study}} was, therefore, to evaluate naturally-occurring plant oils and BCAs with a past history of efficacy as alternatives to fungicides for reduction of Aspergillus infection and aflatoxin accumulation in groundnut. Aspergillus strains and thirteen different plant essential oils were tested. The oils were derived from clove, camphor, vanilla, garlic, galangal, green oregano, lemon grass, neem, ginger, basil, tea <b>tree,</b> thyme and <b>onion.</b> The biocontrol agents used were fungi Trichoderma harzianum strain T- 22, T. asperellum and T. viride from a commercial biocontrol product, TUSAL, and bacteria Pseudomonas chlororaphis ssp. aureofaciens and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (strains MBI 600, 62 P, and 66 P). The identities of a strain of A. niger, isolated from Nigerian groundnut samples, and of T. asperellum and T. viride were confirmed by PCR amplification of DNA and sequence comparison to reference isolates in the GenBank database. Some of the plant oils (clove, camphor and vanilla) and biocontrol agents (Trichoderma strains) tested proved effective in inhibiting the A. flavus and A. niger strains used in the research, in both in vitro and in planta experiments. Improved seedling emergence in pathogen-contaminated compost and reduced post-harvest pod infection were observed. Combinations of the most active BCAs and EOs also provided disease suppression. ELISA analysis of aflatoxin B 1 in treated, A. flavus-inoculated groundnut pods showed a reduction in toxin concentrations, to a level below that recommended by the European Commission of 15 ppb. Of the control agents tested, the most effective were T. harzianum T- 22 as a BCA and probably clove oil as a plant extract. Commercial products based on Trichoderma are used world-wide. EOs, have, to date, had little use in control of Aspergillus infection of groundnut. It was also demonstrated that detection of asymptomatic A. flavus pod infection could be achieved by the traditional method of surface sterilisation and plating out, and by use of a LAMP assay to detect pathogen DNA. The latter could provide a rapid, portable method for A. flavus detection in harvested groundnut pods and could have application in both developed and developing nations. Since low resource growers in nations like Nigeria need alternative, low-cost methods for protecting groundnut from Aspergillus infection, to produce a nutritionally-valuable, high protein foodstuff low in toxin contamination, such alternative methods of disease control may have a future role to play in global food security. It may prove possible to extract antifungal components from appropriate, locally-sourced plant material in a cost-effective manner. However, whether the level of disease control and suppression of aflatoxin accumulation reported here was adequate for possible commercial application is unclear. Further evaluation, including field experiments, is required...|$|R
