25|$|Languages that do {{not have}} {{grammatical}} tense, such as Chinese, express time reference chiefly by lexical means – through adverbials, time phrases, and so on. (The same is done in tensed languages, to supplement or reinforce the <b>time</b> <b>information</b> conveyed by the choice of tense.) <b>Time</b> <b>information</b> is also sometimes conveyed as a secondary feature by markers of other categories, as with the Chinese aspect markers le and guo, which in most cases place an action in past time. However, much <b>time</b> <b>information</b> is conveyed implicitly by context – it is therefore not always necessary, when translating from a tensed to a tenseless language, say, to express explicitly in the target language all of the information conveyed by the tenses in the source.|$|E

25|$|The {{objective}} of financial reporting {{is to provide}} information that is useful to management and stakeholders for resource allocation decisions.

Advances in accounting information systems such as the advent of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems have enabled the generation of real <b>time</b> <b>information.</b> However, the practice of traditional auditing has not kept pace with the real time economy. Traditional manual audit procedures are labor and time intensive, which limits audit frequency to a periodic basis, such as annually.|$|E

25|$|For some <b>time,</b> <b>information</b> about al-Makzun used by modern-day historians came {{solely from}} Muhammad Amin Ghalib al-Tawil's Taʾrīkh al-ʿAlawiyyīn (History of the Alawites), {{published}} in Latakia in 1966. However, {{a more detailed}} and sourced biography of al-Makzun, Taʾrīkh al-Makzūn, was penned by the Alawite sheikh Yunus Hasan Ramadan in 1913. The latter based his biography on several manuscripts, all held in the private libraries of Alawite sheikhs. These manuscripts largely dated to the 18th century, though one dated to the 17th century and three others were written in the 15th century. One of the manuscripts was written by a supposed descendant of al-Makzun. The only mention of him in non-Alawite medieval sources comes from Majma' al-Adab fi Mu'jam al-Alqab, a biographical dictionary of Ibn al-Fuwati (1244–1323), {{a director of the}} Mustansiriyyah Library in Baghdad.|$|E
25|$|Cathode strip {{chambers}} (CSC) {{are used}} in the endcap disks where the magnetic field is uneven and particle rates are high. CSCs consist of arrays of positively charged “anode” wires crossed with negatively charged copper “cathode” strips within a gas volume. When muons pass through, they knock electrons off the gas atoms, which flock to the anode wires creating an avalanche of electrons. Positive ions move away from the wire and towards the copper cathode, also inducing a charge pulse in the strips, at right angles to the wire direction. Because the strips and the wires are perpendicular, we get two position coordinates for each passing particle. In addition to providing precise space and <b>time</b> <b>information,</b> the closely spaced wires make the CSCs fast detectors suitable for triggering. Each CSC module contains six layers making it able to accurately identify muons and match their tracks to those in the tracker.|$|E
25|$|The redshifting for a {{particular}} quasar provides temporal (<b>time)</b> <b>information</b> about reionization. Since an object's redshift corresponds to the time at which it emitted the light, {{it is possible to}} determine when reionization ended. Quasars below a certain redshift (closer in space and time) do not show the Gunn-Peterson trough (though they may show the Lyman-alpha forest), while quasars emitting light prior to reionization will feature a Gunn-Peterson trough. In 2001, four quasars were detected (by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey) with redshifts ranging from znbsp&=nbsp&5.82 to znbsp&=nbsp&6.28. While the quasars above znbsp&=nbsp&6 showed a Gunn-Peterson trough, indicating that the IGM was still at least partly neutral, the ones below did not, meaning the hydrogen was ionized. As reionization is expected to occur over relatively short timescales, the results suggest that the universe was approaching the end of reionization at znbsp&=nbsp&6. This, in turn, suggests that the universe must still have been almost entirely neutral at znbsp&>nbsp&10.|$|E
