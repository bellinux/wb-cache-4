5|$|The letter, {{which is}} a {{response}} to Boniface who had requested his support, reveals Ælfwald's sound understanding of Latin. Ælfwald's letter reassures Boniface that his name was being remembered by the East Angles: it contains an offer to exchange the names of their dead, so that mutual prayers could be read for them. According to Richard Hoggett, a phrase in the letter, 'in septenis monasteriorum nostorum sinaxis', has been interpreted incorrectly by historians to imply that there were at the time seven monasteries in Ælfwald's kingdom in which prayers were being read, a theory which has proved difficult for scholars to explain. Hoggett argues <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> in the phrase refer to the number of times that the monks offered praise during the monastic day and not to the number of monasteries then in existence. He points out that this interpretation was published by Haddan and Stubbs as long ago as 1869.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{believe that}} the medieval manuscript represents the 4th-century tradition (or even earlier), while others believe <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Words</b> of Institution were originally present and were later dropped, {{probably due to the}} liturgical reform of Mar Isho-Yab III in about AD 650. The former include Macomber and Spinks, the latter H. Engerding and E. Mazza. B.

25|$|Some {{people even}} claim <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> soldier itself {{comes from the}} Latin sal dare (to give salt), but {{mainstream}} sources disagree, noting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> soldier more likely derives from the gold solidus introduced by Diocletian in 301 CE.|$|R

25|$|Although {{there is}} {{discussion}} about the meaning or meanings <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> σταυρός and crux had at that time, and about the shape or shapes that such gibbets had, Christians of the first centuries are unanimous in describing the particular structure on which Jesus died as having a transom, not as a simple upright.|$|E

5000|$|There are two {{theories}} {{regarding the}} origin of <b>the</b> <b>word</b> 'Catahoula.'

25|$|Socrates warns the excitable Hippocrates that Sophists are dangerous. He {{tells him}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> of the Sophists go {{straight}} into the soul (psychē) and can corrupt a person straightaway. Socrates says that buying wisdom from a Sophist is different from buying food and drink at the market.

25|$|Since {{characterisation}} and {{the choice}} of law rules were operating inflexiblly, the solution has been to allow the growth of judicial discretion within both parts of the system. Hence, most legal systems have opted for what English law calls the proper law approach, the identification and application {{of the law that}} has the closest connection with the cause(s) of action. It is accepted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> have the same apparent spirit as the older approach, which requires some caution in their evaluation.|$|E
2500|$|Bob Marley {{is said to}} {{have claimed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> reggae came from a Spanish term for [...] "the king's music".

40|$|This {{communication}} {{try to make}} a phenomenology of <b>the</b> <b>word</b> and in {{this sense}} raise a tour through some features, functions and effects <b>that</b> <b>the</b> language shows.

We talk also <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>word,</b> as a metaphor, creates new meanings that expand our horizon of understanding. And finally we examine <b>the</b> power of <b>words</b> to do things and to do community.

5000|$|The term [...] "natural born" [...] {{has often}} been used synonymously with [...] "native born". [...] The English {{lexicographer}} Samuel Johnson wrote in 1756 <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "natural" [...] means [...] "native," [...] and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "native" [...] may mean either an [...] "inhabitant" [...] or an [...] "offspring".|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to being a period of wealth and economic growth, the late Ming dynasty also brought intellectual fervor and liberalization. New thinkers like Wang Yangming and Li Zhi challenged orthodox Confucianism and argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> of Confucius and Mencius were fallible and that wisdom was universal. They also questioned government power over the economy and personal rights. Scholars of the Donglin school protested increases in government taxation during the Wanli Emperor, and restrictions on freedom of speech, advocating a program similar to classical liberalism.|$|E
25|$|The Koine Greek terms {{used in the}} New Testament of the {{structure}} on which Jesus died are stauros (σταυρός) and xylon (ξύλον). Those words, which can refer to many different things, do not indicate the precise shape of {{the structure}}. Scholars {{have long known that}} the Greek word stauros and the Latin word crux did not uniquely mean a cross. They have known too <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> had that meaning also, and so have not considered necessarily incorrect the traditional picture of a cross with transom.|$|E
25|$|Adherents of the Latter Day Saint {{movement}} give varied {{responses to}} these criticisms. Some point to what they claim is evidence {{for the presence of}} these items and locations. Others invoke the limited geography model, regarding the events of the Book of Mormon as taking place in such a geographically limited area that no evidence should be expected. Some counter <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> used in the Book of Mormon refer not to the animals, plants and technologies that presently exist but to other similar items that did exist at the time. These views are not directly supported by the LDS Church, but they do motivate archaeological efforts to further understand these situations, including research being performed by Brigham Young University (BYU) professors.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{generally}} agreed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> tatara is foreign to Japan, originating in India or Central Asia. There {{is a possibility}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> came from a place in ancient Korea, where the two dynasties would often meet. According to the Kojiki (one of the oldest Japanese historical texts), this meeting place was called Tatara-ba (たたら場) or Tatara-tsu (たたら津), and <b>the</b> <b>word</b> was possibly imported with iron-working technology. Japanese scholar Tokutaro Yasuda suggests <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> may be from <b>the</b> Sanskrit <b>word</b> tātala, meaning [...] "heat," [...] noting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Hindi <b>word</b> for steel is sakeraa, which {{is very similar to}} <b>the</b> <b>word</b> kera (鉧) used in Japan for the steel bloom which the tatara produces. The two Chinese characters used when <b>the</b> <b>word</b> has <b>the</b> original meaning are 踏鞴 and, besides as tatara, they can be also read as fumifuigo, or foot bellows.|$|R
25|$|Note: Plural or {{singular}} without <b>the</b> case means <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> {{or words}} can be declined {{in any case}} in plural or singular respectively, but Plural genitive means, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> second <b>word</b> remains undeclined.|$|R
2500|$|In Denmark, {{usage of}} [...] {{is up for}} debate. Linguists and others may argue <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> has a {{historical}} racist legacy that makes it unsuitable for use today. Mainly older people use <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] with <b>the</b> notion <b>that</b> it is a neutral word paralleling [...] "negro". Relatively few young people use it, other than for provocative purposes in recognition <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>word's</b> acceptability has declined.|$|R
25|$|Language {{learning}} {{takes place}} in different contexts, with both the infant and the caregiver engaging in social interactions. Recent research have investigated how infants and adults use cross-situational statistics {{in order to learn}} about not only the meanings of words but also the constraints within a context. For example, Smith and his colleagues proposed that infants learn language by acquiring a bias to label objects to similar objects that come from categories that are well-defined. Important to this view is the idea that the constraints that assist learning of words are not independent of the input itself or the infant's experience. Rather, constraints come about as infants learn about the ways <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> are used and begin to pay attention to certain characteristics of objects that have been used in the past to represent the words.|$|E
25|$|The {{inherent}} tendency test theoretically {{has a lower}} threshold {{than the}} real risk test, thereby causing persons who are charged with scandalizing contempt to be convicted for the offence with greater ease. In Shadrake, Justice Loh identified two problems with the inherent tendency test {{as it had been}} set out in Wain. First, the High Court had said that the justification for scandalizing contempt was the prevention of interference with the administration of justice as opposed to protecting public confidence in the administration of justice. The former is the concern of sub judice contempt– that is, contempt relating to a case that is currently under consideration by a court– while it is the latter that is concerned with scandalizing contempt. Secondly, such a test indicates <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> in the impugned publication or speech are to be looked at alone. This has the effect of ignoring the circumstances surrounding the utterance or publication of the words, and is excessively harsh.|$|E
25|$|By April and May 1971, Genie's {{scores on}} the Leiter International Performance Scale tests had {{dramatically}} increased, with her overall mental age {{at the level of}} a typical 4-year-9-month-old, but on individual components she still showed a very high level of scatter. Her progress with language accelerated, and doctors noticed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> she used indicated a fairly advanced mental categorization of objects and situations and focused on objective properties to a degree not normally found in children. Around that time, when a minor earthquake struck Los Angeles, she ran frightened into the kitchen and rapidly verbalized to some of the hospital cooks she had befriended, marking the first time she sought out comfort from another person and the first time she was so readily verbal. However, she still had a hard time being with large crowds of people; at her birthday party, she became so anxious at all the guests present that she had to go outside with Rigler to calm down.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{problem is}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> samurai, perhaps {{contrary}} to popular belief, originally {{had nothing to do}} with fighting or being a warrior. As explained in etymology of samurai, <b>the</b> <b>word</b> originally meant [...] "those who serve in close attendance to nobility" [...] and was originally pronounced [...] "saburau". Therefore, <b>the</b> argument <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> samurai is derived from saulabi ("a man who fights") is highly unlikely.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> Latin <b>word</b> salarium linked {{employment}} and salt, but the exact link {{is not very}} clear. Modern sources maintain <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> salarium is derived from <b>the</b> <b>word</b> sal (salt) because at some point a soldier's salary {{may have been an}} allowance for the purchase of salt or the price of having soldiers conquer salt supplies and guard the Salt Roads (Via Salaria) that led to Rome. But there is no evidence for this assertion at all.Some people even claim <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> soldier itself comes from the Latin sal dare (to give salt), but mainstream sources disagree, noting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> soldier more likely derives from the gold solidus introduced by Diocletian in 301 CE.|$|R
25|$|In 1515, Thomas Wyttenbach, Huldrych Zwingli's teacher, {{became a}} priest at the Minster of Bern. In {{the latter part}} of Wyttenbach's stay in Bern, a local priest, Berchtold Haller, lived with him. Around the time that Wyttenbach left Bern in 1520 to become a Reformer of his birthplace, Biel, Haller was elected a canon of the cathedral. In 1521, he became friends with Zwingli in Zurich and began to preach more Protestant sermons. In February, 1522, two Fastnacht plays were given at Bern, which {{attacked}} the Catholic Church. Due to the rising reformist sentiment, in June 1523, the city council ordered <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> of the Bible should be preached. By November 20 of that year, the nuns left the convent in Bern. But in 1524 the priest Meier, who sympathized with Haller, was compelled to leave Bern. That left Haller the only Protestant among the priests. Then, on April 7, 1525, the council issued a new decree restoring the Catholic worship, though with a few changes.|$|E
25|$|Islam is monotheistic {{and insists}} {{that there can}} be no intercessors between an {{individual}} and God. Nevertheless, Sudanese Islam includes a belief in spirits as sources of illness or other afflictions and in magical ways of dealing with them. The imam of a mosque is a prayer leader and preacher of sermons. He may also be a teacher and in smaller communities combines both functions. In the latter role, he is called a faqih (pl., fuqaha), although a faqih need not be an imam. In addition to teaching in the local Qur'anic school (khalwa), the faqih is expected to write texts (from the Qur'an) or magical verses to be used as amulets and cures. His blessing may be asked at births, marriages, deaths, and other important occasions, and he may participate in wholly non-Islamic harvest rites in some remote places. All of these functions and capacities make the faqih the most important figure in popular Islam. But he is not a priest. His religious authority is based on his putative knowledge of the Qur'an, the sharia, and techniques for dealing with occult threats to health and well- being. The notion <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> of the Qur'an will protect against the actions of evil spirits or the evil eye is deeply embedded in popular Islam, and the amulets prepared by the faqih are intended to protect their wearers against these dangers.|$|E
