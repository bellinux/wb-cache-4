5|$|In 1942 Ernst Lubitsch {{directed}} a motion picture titled <b>To</b> <b>Be</b> <b>or</b> Not To Be. The {{story is a}} comedy about a troupe of Polish actors in the Nazi era. A key plot point revolves around the famous soliloquy. The story was remade in 1983 in a film starring (and produced by) Mel Brooks.|$|E
5|$|Passive constructions {{also use}} {{auxiliary}} verbs. A passive construction rephrases an active construction {{in such a}} way that the object of the active phrase becomes the subject of the passive phrase, and the subject of the active phrase is either omitted or demoted to a role as an oblique argument introduced in a prepositional phrase. They are formed by using the past participle either with the auxiliary verb <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>or</b> to get, although not all varieties of English allow the use of passives with get. For example, putting the sentence she sees him into the passive becomes he is seen (by her), or he gets seen (by her).|$|E

25|$|At that time, their {{presence}} as a neutral force was important because local {{police officers were}} often perceived <b>to</b> <b>be</b> (<b>or</b> were even expected to be) biased towards their own ethnic groups when handling race-related issues, further fuelling discontent and violence. Officers who attempt {{to carry out their}} duties impartially and in full accordance with the law also faced social backlash from their own ethnic communities, a difficult situation which can even lead to physical harm to individual officers.|$|E
25|$|Following Acting President, and President-elect Bronisław Komorowski {{resignation}} from Sejm (and thus Marshal's office) on 8 July 2010, Borusewicz became Acting President of Poland {{until the}} election of the new Marshal of Sejm Grzegorz Schetyna. Borusewicz was the first Senate Marshal to become a temporary head of state and the shortest-serving Polish head of state since 1918. Also, he was already the second person <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>or</b> act as President since President Lech Kaczyński's death in April 2010.|$|E
50|$|For marital status, Separate Catholic {{graduates}} <b>were</b> {{more likely}} <b>to</b> have never <b>been</b> married, {{and more likely}} to marry at a later age than government school graduates.

Independent non-religious graduates differed from government school graduates only in being less likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> divorced <b>or</b> separated. Christian school graduates marry younger and <b>are</b> more likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> married than any other group. They are also less likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> divorced <b>or</b> separated and less likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> living with a partner than graduates of government schools.

25|$|She {{also became}} {{interested}} in film {{at that time and}} after graduation appeared as an actress in a film directed by one of the group's members which won the audience award at the Pia Film Festival. When the director left the group, Matsunashi decided to make her own films though she had no formal training in cinema. Her first film, the 1995 short, <b>To</b> <b>Be</b> <b>or</b> Not to Be, which she wrote, directed and acted in, won an Encouragement Prize in the Off Theater Competition at the 1996 Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival.|$|E
25|$|Hamlet's soliloquies have {{captured}} the attention of scholars as well. Early critics viewed such speeches as <b>To</b> <b>be,</b> <b>or</b> not to be as Shakespeare's expressions of his own personal beliefs. Later scholars, such as Charney, have rejected this theory saying the soliloquies are expressions of Hamlet's thought process. During his speeches, Hamlet interrupts himself, expressing disgust in agreement with himself, and embellishing his own words. He has difficulty expressing himself directly, and instead skirts around the basic idea of his thought. Not until late in the play, after his experience with the pirates, is Hamlet really able to be direct and sure in his speech.|$|E
25|$|Since Orcus {{is known}} to be a binary system, the mass of the system has been {{estimated}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> , <b>or</b> about 3.8% the mass of the most massive known dwarf planet, Eris. How this mass is partitioned between Orcus and Vanth depends of their relative sizes. If Vanth's diameter is about one third that of Orcus, its mass is only 3% of the system mass. On the other hand, if the size of Vanth is about half that of the primary (see above), then its mass could be as high as 1/12 of the system mass, or about 8% of the mass of Orcus.|$|E

25|$|A filovirus, {{at first}} {{suspected}} to be Ebola virus (EBOV), was discovered among crab-eating macaques (Macaca fascicularis) within the Covance Primate Quarantine Unit in 1989. This attracted significant media attention, including {{the publication of}} The Hot Zone. The filovirus {{was found to be}} distinct from EBOV and to be nonpathogenic for humans. It was named after the community, and is now known as Reston virus (RESTV). Macaques found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>or</b> suspected to be infected with RESTV were euthanized, and the facility was sterilized. The facility was located in an office park near Sunset Hills Road and Wiehle Avenue. It was eventually torn down, and a daycare was built in its place.|$|E
25|$|The Sri Vaishnavas {{identify}} Vishnu {{with the}} Brahman, while Krishna-centered traditions will associate Para Brahman with Krishna as Svayam Bhagavan. According to Ramanujacharya, Brahman is personal. Indeed, {{he is the}} supreme person, creator and Lord, who leads souls to salvation. Far from having no (positive) attributes, as some Advaita Vedanta followers maintain, Brahman {{is the sum of}} all “noble attributes” — i.e. omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent, and all-merciful, all qualities attributed to Vishnu by all Vaishavas. According to South Indian traditions he is also advitya (Sanskrit meaning without rival). To Vaishnavas, Shiva, Brahma, and the other gods of the Hindu pantheon are viewed as Brahman's agents or servants, created and commissioned by him. Some Vaishnavas consider them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>or</b> see that they have the same status that of angels have in the western religious traditions.|$|E
25|$|Benny also {{acted in}} films, {{including}} the Academy Award-winning The Hollywood Revue of 1929, Broadway Melody of 1936 (as a benign nemesis for Eleanor Powell and Robert Taylor), George Washington Slept Here (1942), and notably, Charley's Aunt (1941) and <b>To</b> <b>Be</b> <b>or</b> Not to Be (1942). He and Livingstone {{also appeared in}} Ed Sullivan's Mr. Broadway (1933) as themselves. Benny often parodied contemporary movies and movie genres on the radio program, and the 1940 film Buck Benny Rides Again features all the main radio characters in a funny Western parody adapted from program skits. The failure of one Benny vehicle, The Horn Blows at Midnight, became a running gag on his radio and television programs, although contemporary viewers may not find the film as disappointing as the jokes suggest.|$|E
