5|$|Hurricane Humberto was a {{moderately}} powerful hurricane that briefly affected Bermuda in September 2001. It was the eighth named storm of the season, {{as well as}} the fourth hurricane. It formed on September 21 between Puerto Rico and Bermuda, partially related to previous Hurricane Gabrielle. Humberto passed about 140 miles (225km) west of Bermuda, which spared the island with its strongest winds. After weakening and believed {{to be on the verge}} of dissipating, Humberto unexpectedly restrengthened to the southeast of Atlantic Canada. The intensification was short-lived and the storm dissipated on September 27. There were a series of significant observational flights into the hurricane <b>that</b> <b>produced</b> <b>a</b> wealth of data on the structure of hurricanes.|$|E

The 1970s energy crisis raised the national profile of energy issues, and Creutz {{served on a}} panel <b>that</b> <b>produced</b> <b>a</b> study called The Nation's Energy Future.

5|$|In {{the late}} 17th century, the Navajo {{acquired}} the Iberian Churra, a {{breed of sheep}} from Spanish explorers. These animals were developed into a unique breed by the Navajo, today called the Navajo-Churro. These sheep were well-suited to the climate in Navajo lands, and <b>that</b> <b>produced</b> <b>a</b> useful long-staple wool. Hand-spun wool from these animals was {{the main source of}} yarn for Navajo blankets until the 1860s, when the United States government forced the Navajo people to relocate at Bosque Redondo and seized their livestock. The 1869 peace treaty that allowed the Navajo to return to their traditional lands included a $30,000 settlement to replace their livestock. The tribe purchased 14,000 sheep and 1,000 goats.|$|E
5|$|Lukather's {{reputation}} as a guitarist and his association with Paich and Jeff Porcaro, who also became established artists, allowed him to secure a solid flow of session work in the 1970s and 1980s. Lukather has been nominated for twelve Grammy Awards, and has won five. While his work with Toto was predominantly based on pop rock music and his solo work ventures into progressive rock and hard rock, many of Lukather's side-projects are focused on jazz fusion. He held a long-time collaboration with jazz guitarist Larry Carlton <b>that</b> <b>produced</b> <b>a</b> Grammy-winning live album, {{and he was a}} member of the jazz fusion band Los Lobotomys, a collaboration of notable session musicians.|$|E
5|$|The Betsimisaraka ("the many inseparables") are {{the second}} largest ethnic group in Madagascar after the Merina and make up {{approximately}} fifteen percent of the Malagasy people. They occupy a large stretch of the eastern coastal region of Madagascar, from Mananjary {{in the south to}} Antalaha in the north. The Betsimisaraka {{have a long history of}} extensive interaction with European seafarers and traders <b>that</b> <b>produced</b> <b>a</b> significant subset with mixed European-Malagasy origins, termed the zana-malata. European influence is evident in the local valse (waltz) and basesa musical genres, which are typically performed on the accordion. Tromba (spirit possession) ceremonies feature strongly in Betsimisaraka culture.|$|E

5|$|The {{arrival of}} the Mk.

The Beaufighter had considerably more powerful engines, speed that allowed it to catch its targets, and a powerful gun pack of four 20mm cannon that could easily destroy a bomber in a single pass. Squadron use began in October, and its first victory came soon after on 19/20 November when a Beaufighter IF of No. 604 Squadron destroyed a Ju 88A-5 near Chichester, very close to the first success of the Mk. III.|$|E

The visit to Wolverhampton Wanderers ended in defeat by the same score. Oliver conceded a penalty kick for a foul on Charlie Reynolds, Wheldon equalised before half-time, and Wolverhampton regained the lead straight after the interval.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, Rollin Woodyatt {{reviewed}} {{the research on}} diet and diabetes. He reported that three water-soluble compounds, β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate and acetone (known collectively as ketone bodies), were produced by the liver in otherwise healthy people when they were starved or if they consumed a very low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet. Russel Wilder, at the Mayo Clinic, built on this research and coined the term ketogenic diet to describe a diet <b>that</b> <b>produced</b> <b>a</b> high level of ketone bodies in the blood (ketonemia) through an excess of fat and lack of carbohydrate. Wilder hoped to obtain the benefits of fasting in a dietary therapy that could be maintained indefinitely. His trial on a few epilepsy patients in 1921 was the first use of the ketogenic diet {{as a treatment for}} epilepsy.|$|E
40|$|The {{design and}} {{synthesis}} of amphiphilic nano- to micro-sized polymeric particles with core-shell nanostructures have attracted more and more attention because of their wide applicability in modern material science and their technological importance {{in the areas of}} colloid and interface science. Many synthetic strategies have been developed for the preparation of amphiphilic core-shell particles that consist of hydrophobic polymer cores and hydrophilic polymeric shells. In this review, we focus on emulsion-based approaches and properties of particles produced. These methods are: (1) grafting to functionalized particle <b>that</b> <b>produces</b> <b>a</b> corona-like particle, (2) grafting from reactive seed particle <b>that</b> <b>produces</b> <b>a</b> brush-like particle, (3) copolymerization of reactive macro-monomer with hydrophobic monomer <b>that</b> <b>produces</b> <b>a</b> corona-like particle, (4) emulsion polymerization in the presence of block or comb-like copolymer containing controlled free-radical moiety <b>that</b> <b>produces</b> <b>a</b> multi-layered particle, and (5) redox-initiated graft polymerization of vinyl monomer from a water-soluble polymer containing amino groups <b>that</b> <b>produces</b> <b>a</b> hairy-like particle. Potential applications of some of these particles in drug and gene deliveries, enzyme immobilization, colloidal nanocatalyst, chemical sensing, smart coating, and thermal laser imaging will be discussed.

5|$|Tests {{were carried}} out {{starting}} in October 1940, and quickly demonstrated a number of minor problems. One of the minor issues is that the crosshairs on the tube that indicated the center would block the spot. A more serious concern {{was the lack of}} range information, which the FIU pilots considered critical. Hanbury Brown went to work on these issues, and returned an updated version in December. A U-shaped reticle {{in the center of the}} display provided a centre location that left the spot visible. Additionally, the circuitry included a second timebase <b>that</b> <b>produced</b> <b>a</b> longer signal as the fighter approached its target. The output was timed so the line was centred horizontally on the dot. This presented the range in an easily understandable fashion; the line looked like the wings of an aircraft, which naturally grow larger as the fighter approaches it.|$|E
