By late June, No.453 Squadron and the other RAF Spitfire units were regularly attacking German positions in Normandy as well as providing air defence for the Allied forces in the area; during the month the squadron flew more than 700 sorties. A small number of Australians posted to RAF squadrons equipped with Hawker Typhoon fighter-bombers also attacked German vehicles and positions in direct support of the Allied ground troops throughout the month. No.456 Squadron, which was one of four night fighter squadrons assigned to protect the beachhead, frequently met German aircraft and shot down twelve of them in <b>the</b> <b>week</b> <b>after</b> the landing. Australian fighter ace Flight Lieutenant Nicky Barr, who had escaped from German custody in Italy during 1943, also briefly served in an air support control unit in Normandy. Barr landed at Omaha Beach on 9 June, but returned to the UK three days later as his commanding officer believed that German forces would execute Barr if they recaptured him.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the best moment to stock trout, Salmo trutta L., larvae into the wild. This goal was accomplished by determining weekly changes in the growth parameters of larvae that were fed in seven variants: on the day of 2 / 3 yolk sac resorption; from <b>the</b> first <b>week</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> day of 2 / 3 yolk sac resorption; from <b>the</b> second <b>week</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> day of 2 / 3 yolk sac resorption; from <b>the</b> third <b>week</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> day of 2 / 3 yolk sac resorption; from <b>the</b> fourth <b>week</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> day of 2 / 3 yolk sac resorption; from <b>the</b> fifth <b>week</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> day of 2 / 3 yolk sac resorption; from <b>the</b> sixth <b>week</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> day of 2 / 3 yolk sac resorption. Based on our results, we concluded the following: 1) trout larvae are ready to start eating at the time of the resorption of 2 / 3 of the yolk sac; 2) trout larvae can live without food for three <b>weeks</b> following <b>the</b> resorption 2 / 3 of the yolk sac without any notable losses; 3) the best moment to stock trout larvae into the wild is in the period from the resorption of 2 / 3 of the yolk sac to <b>the</b> third <b>week</b> <b>after</b> this resorption, so one <b>week</b> <b>after</b> full resorption. This is the optimal period to stock any waters with trout larvae...|$|R
