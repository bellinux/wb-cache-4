Instrumentation is {{provided}} by finger snapping, minor piano keys and piano riffs, a style of repeated chord progression. The lyrics of [...] "Stupid in Love" [...] revolve around a woman in an abusive and adulterous relationship, progressing to the female protagonist leaving her boyfriend.

[...] Rihanna sings the line [...] "This is stupid / I'm not stupid / Don't talk to me / Like I'm stupid" [...] during the chorus.

500|$|For {{the first}} time in any of his works {{involving}} amateurs, Britten envisaged a large complement of child performers among his orchestral forces, led by what Graham described as [...] "the professional stiffening" [...] of a piano duet, string quintet (two violins, viola, cello and bass), recorder and a timpanist. The young musicians play a variety of instruments, including a full string ensemble with each section led {{by a member of the}} professional string quintet. The violins are further divided into parts of different levels of difficulty, from the simplest (mostly playing open strings) to those able to play in third position. The recorders should be led by an accomplished soloist able to flutter-tongue; bugles, played in the original production by boys from a local school band, are played as the children representing animals march into the ark, and at the climax of the opera. The child percussionists, led by a professional timpanist, play various exotic and invented percussion instruments: the score itself specifies sandpaper ("two pieces of sandpaper attached to blocks of wood and rubbed together"), and [...] "Slung Mugs", the latter used to represent the first drops of rain. Britten originally had the idea of striking teacups with a spoon, but having failed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> <b>work,</b> he sought Imogen Holst's advice. She recalled that [...] "by great good fortune I had once had to teach Women's Institute percussion groups during a wartime 'social half hour', so I was able to take him into my kitchen and show him how a row of china mugs hanging on a length of string could be hit with a large wooden spoon.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{explorer}} {{to conquer}} the Northwest Passage solely by ship was the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen. In a three-year journey between 1903 and 1906, Amundsen explored the passage with a crew of six. Amundsen, who had sailed to escape creditors seeking to stop the expedition, completed the voyage in the converted 45 net register tonnage (...) herring boat Gjøa. Gjøa was much smaller than vessels used by other Arctic expeditions and had a shallow draft. Amundsen intended to hug the shore, live off the limited resources {{of the land and}} sea through which he was to travel, and had determined that he needed to have a tiny crew <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> <b>work.</b> (Trying to support much larger crews had contributed to the catastrophic failure of John Franklin's expedition fifty years previously).

2500|$|The 45RFE and 545RFE {{automatic}} transmission in the WJ was notable. It included three planetary gear sets {{rather than the}} two normally used in a four-speed automatic. This gave it six theoretical speeds, {{and it would have}} been the first six-speed transmission ever produced in volume, but it was programmed to only use five of these ratios. Four were used for upshifts, with a different second gear for downshifts. Although five of the six ratios were used, Chrysler decided to call it a [...] "4-speed automatic". In 2001, the programming was changed to make use of all six ratios. Rather than have six forward gears, the transmission was programmed to act as a five-speed with the alternate second gear for downshifts. The rpm at [...] on a 545RFE is 2000 rpm, 200 rpm less than the 45RFE programming. 1999 and 2000 model year WJ owners can have their 45RFE transmission's programming flashed to enable the extra gear as both transmissions are physically the same.
