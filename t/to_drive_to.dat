Despite the restaurant being closed, Pankow angrily demands service. The sheepish fast food attendant tells the man <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> the next window, where he is attacked and violently pulled out of his car. Pankow's body is later discovered with the brain removed from the skull. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are assigned to assist the local police in their investigation.|$|E
5|$|In March 2005, Wessex Trains, {{the company}} {{managing}} the {{station at the}} time, introduced car parking charges. It was noted that this resulted in less use of the car parks, more local street parking and caused people <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> Nailsea and Backwell railway station, where parking was still free. Following local pressure, the charges were reduced in July 2005.|$|E

David agrees to fund an anniversary party for him and attend, but Michael abruptly announces his resignation from the company and walks out.|$|E

Exploiting a large opening, Kaepernick held onto the ball and ran it {{into the end zone}} to narrow Maryland's lead to one touchdown, 42–35, with 2:19remaining. Jaekle attempted an onside kick in an effort to give Nevada another chance on offense, but the ball was recovered by Maryland receiver Danny Oquendo. Scott rushed for two and then 19yards. With the first down, Maryland had enough time to run out the clock and clinch the 42–35victory.|$|E
5|$|After his defeat, Macrinus {{sent his}} son Diadumenian to Artabanus V of Parthia, while he himself {{returned}} to Antioch, proclaiming himself victorious over Elagabalus in battle. News spread of Macrinus' defeat, however, and many civilians who had supported him were slain {{in the city}} and on the roads. Macrinus then shaved off his beard and hair to disguise himself {{as a member of the}} military police. Fleeing the city at night on horseback, he reached Cilicia along with a few companions, masqueraded as a military courier, and secured a carriage <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> Eribolon, near Nicomedia. From there he set sail for Chalcedon.|$|E

The trio are <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> the Nuclear Plutonium Store, where isotopes for all Britain's power stations are housed, and plant explosives to detonate at 12:30p.m.; this will cause a nuclear explosion of unprecedented scale and devastate half of England.

5|$|As the SS Panzer Corps {{began to}} emerge from the city, they engaged Soviet units {{positioned}} directly southwest of the city, including the 17th NKVD Brigade, 19th Rifle Division and 25th Guards Rifle Division. Attempts by the Red Army to re-establish communication with the remnants of the 3rd Tank Army continued, although in vain. On 14–15 March these forces were given permission to withdraw to the northern Donets River. The Soviet 40th and 69th armies had been engaged since 13 March with the Großdeutschland Panzergrenadier Division, and had been split by the German drive. After the fall of Kharkov the Soviet defense of the Donets had collapsed, allowing Manstein's forces <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> Belgorod on 17 March, and take it by the next day. However, weather and exhaustion forced Manstein's counterstroke to end soon thereafter.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the Second World War Wodehouse and his wife {{remained}} at their Le Touquet house, where, during the Phoney War, he worked on Joy in the Morning. With the advance of the Germans, the nearby Royal Air Force base withdrew; Wodehouse was offered the sole spare seat in one of the fighter aircraft, but he turned down the opportunity as it would have meant leaving behind Ethel and their dog. On 21 May 1940, with German troops advancing through northern France, the Wodehouses decided <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> Portugal and fly from there to the US. Two miles from home their car broke down, so they returned and borrowed a car from a neighbour; with the routes blocked with refugees, they returned home again.|$|E
5|$|Forty {{tanks of}} the 1st Brigade {{were to be}} used in the attack on the Third Army front, eight with XVIII Corps and sixteen each in VII Corps and VI Corps. When the blue line had been reached, four of the VII Corps tanks were to join VI Corps for its attack on the brown line. The black line (first objective) was not to be {{attacked}} by tanks, which were to begin the drive to the front line at zero-hour and rendezvous with infantry at the black line two hours later. The tanks were reserved for the most difficult objectives beyond the black line in groups of up to ten vehicles. Four tanks were to attack Neuville Vitasse, four against Telegraph Hill, four against The Harp and another four against Tilloy lez Mofflaines and two were to drive down the slope from Roclincourt west of Bois de la Maison Blanche. Once the blue line had fallen, the tanks still running were <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> rally points.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to notification from Air Traffic Control, three ambulances from Perth were despatched {{in the direction}} of the crash site, known to be somewhere between Chidlow and York. The crash site was several miles from the road so the ambulance crews travelled eastwards all the way to York without sighting a fire. The crews were eventually guided back along the main road and then along a dirt road that enabled them <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> within three or four miles of the crash site. The crews then took their first-aid boxes and set out on foot.|$|E
5|$|Michael (Steve Carell) {{wants to}} throw a party to {{celebrate}} his fifteenth anniversary working at Dunder Mifflin. He becomes unnerved when Charles Miner (Idris Elba), the new company vice president, exhibits a no-nonsense attitude towards him, making Michael not feel like his own boss. Charles seems to establish {{a good relationship with}} the rest of the staff; he buys everyone lunch and reveals the truth about their 401(k) plans and the possibility of layoffs, which Michael withheld so as not to worry the staff. Taking advice from Chief Financial Officer David Wallace (Andy Buckley), Michael tries to become better acquainted with Charles, but is unsuccessful. Michael attempts to contact Wallace on the phone, one attempt leading to getting transferred to Charles. When Charles catches the Party Planning Committee planning Michael's party during office hours, he dissolves the committee and cancels Michael's party. Michael decides <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> New York to talk to Wallace.|$|E
5|$|The XLVI Motorised Corps {{encountered}} little {{resistance from}} the 40th Infantry Division Slavonska, and by the evening of 10 April the whole 4th Army was disintegrating.

At midnight, 2nd Army headquarters declared that the Yugoslav northern front had been decisively defeated, and tasked corps engineer units to consolidate bridging across major rivers. The main body units of the XLVI Motorised Corps moved forward to Virovitica and Slatina. At midnight, the corps commander, General der Panzertruppe Heinrich von Vietinghoff issued orders for the 8th Panzer Division to continue towards Belgrade via Osijek, but directed the 16th Motorised Infantry Division to thrust west as far as Sremska Mitrovica then turn south to drive towards Sarajevo via Zvornik.|$|E

5|$|The Zagreb Corps {{made little}} or no {{progress}} on day two of the battle. Part of the 2nd Guards Brigade was ordered to drive towards Glina with the 20th Home Guards Regiment making a modest advance, while the 153rd Brigade abandoned its bridgehead. In the area of Petrinja, the HV advanced gradually only to be pushed back in some areas by an ARSK counter-attack. The results were reversed at significant cost by a renewed push by the 2nd Guards Brigade. The Zagreb Corps commander was replaced by Lieutenant General Petar Stipetić on orders from President Tuđman. The HV reassigned the 102nd Brigade <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> Glina, and the 57th Brigade was reinforced with the 2nd Battalion of the 149th Brigade. The 145th Brigade was moved from Popovača to the Sunja area, where the 17th Home Guard Regiment and the 151st Brigade made minor advances into the ARSK-held area.|$|E

Later, perhaps {{in the early hours}} of the morning of 7 August, he had returned to the farm on his mother's bicycle—which he had borrowed a few days earlier—cycling along a route that avoided the main roads and approaching the house from the back. He had entered the house through a downstairs bathroom window, taken the rifle with the silencer attached, and gone upstairs.|$|E
