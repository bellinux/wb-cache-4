5|$|Chomsky {{argues that}} the multi-party, representative, liberal {{democracy}} that governs the United States is insufficiently democratic, instead advocating a form of participatory, direct democracy through which the ordinary citizens have a direct say in public policy. As such, he advocates that communities take {{a different approach to}} the upcoming primary elections; instead of simply listening to speeches given by the politicians hoping to be elected, <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>get</b> together in democratic councils and discuss what issues they want addressing. That done, Chomsky argues, they should approach the politicians, informing them that they have no interest in their speeches, but that if they want to get elected, they must come and listen {{to the demands of the}} people; alternately, he argues, these communities should select their own representatives whom they could then vote for.|$|E

25|$|When attacking, {{there may}} be 3 or 4 slips and 1 or 2 gullies, {{potentially}} using up to six fielders in that region alone. This would typically {{be accompanied by a}} mid off, mid on, and fine leg, making it a 7–2 field. Although there are only two fielders on the leg side, <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>get</b> relatively little work as long as the bowlers maintain a line outside off stump. This type of field leaves large gaps in front of the wicket, and is used to entice the batsmen to attack there, with the hope that they make a misjudgment and edge the ball to the catchers waiting behind them.|$|E

Eve Silva Paragorica (Jules de Jongh) asks them to help save the asylum and the {{patients}} within, then she will lead them to Higginbotham. After clearing out the Meanies in the asylum, they find Higginbotham. Eve proposes that <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>get</b> rid of the infection by shrinking Sackboy and sending him into Higginbotham's head. Even after clearing the infection, Higginbotham still appears to be insane.

25|$|Voter {{turnout was}} higher than {{expected}} at 58%. The results saw the Centre Party win the most votes, but they were only 0.8% ahead of the new Res Publica party. As a result, both parties won 28 seats, which was a disappointment for the Centre Party who had expected to win the most seats. Altogether the right of centre parties won 60 seats, compared to only 41 for the left wing, and so were expected to form the next government. Both the Centre and Res Publica parties said that <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>get</b> the chance to try and form the next government, while ruling out any deal between themselves. President Rüütel had to decide who he should nominate as Prime Minister and therefore be given the first chance at forming a government. On 2 April he invited {{the leader of the}} Res Publica party, Juhan Parts, to form a government, and after negotiations a coalition government composed of Res Publica, the Reform Party and the People's Union of Estonia was formed on 10 April.|$|E
25|$|One such {{story is}} that of Rabbi Joshua ben Levi. The rabbi, a friend of Elijah’s, was asked what favor he might wish. The rabbi {{answered}} only that {{he be able to}} join Elijah in his wanderings. Elijah granted his wish only if he refrained from asking any questions about any of the prophet’s actions. He agreed and they began their journey. The first place they came to was the house of an elderly couple who were so poor they had only one old cow. The old couple gave of their hospitality as best they could. The next morning, as the travelers left, Elijah prayed that the old cow would die and it did. The second place they came to was the home of a wealthy man. He had no patience for his visitors and chased them away with the admonition that <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>get</b> jobs and not beg from honest people. As they were leaving, they passed the man’s wall {{and saw that it was}} crumbling. Elijah prayed that the wall be repaired and it was so. Next, they came to a wealthy synagogue. They were allowed to spend the night with only the smallest of provisions. When they left, Elijah prayed that every member of the synagogue might become a leader.|$|E

After [...] "stuffier viewers" [...] became outraged at the idea of the unwed couple moving in together, the {{producers}} decided that <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>get</b> married instead.

At one of Joe's warehouses, White and Orange rendezvous with Pink, who believes that the job was a setup and {{that the police were}} waiting for them. White informs him that Brown is dead, Blue and Blonde are missing, and Blonde murdered several civilians during the heist; White is furious that Joe, his old friend, would employ such a [...] "psychopath". Pink has hidden the diamonds nearby; he argues with White over whether or not <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>get</b> medical attention for Orange. Blonde arrives with a kidnapped policeman, Marvin Nash.|$|E
500|$|The {{programme}} {{received some}} criticism in Norfolk for its inaccurate depiction of local accents. Local journalist and broadcaster Keith Skipper told the Eastern Daily Press: [...] "If {{they are going}} to set these dramas in a specific location with locals and extras surely <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>get</b> the accent right otherwise it is self defeating." [...] An ITV spokesman told the paper: [...] "We hired a professional dialect coach to help the actors achieve their Norfolk accent. The Norfolk accent is different in one area of Norfolk to another.

[...] However, he failed to identify any area of Norfolk in which the accent contains a Mummerset [...] "r".|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} of Quagmire's wedding, Lois' breasts have gotten very large after {{deciding}} to wean Stewie, {{on the advice of}} Brian. While at the reception, the top of her shirt rips open. Peter notices that Quagmire is staring at Lois' huge breasts, and deliberately spills champagne on them. Peter then [...] "helps" [...] Lois by shaking her, which makes her large breasts jiggle. This arouses Quagmire, and he realizes that he has made a mistake by marrying Joan. He informs Joan that some of his friends think <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>get</b> an annulment after discussing it with Peter, Joe and Cleveland, but she threatens to cut herself and him if he annuls their marriage. As a result, Peter decides to help Quagmire fake his death. He shows Joan a video of Quagmire being attacked by a ninja (Joe), a Nazi (Cleveland), a [...] "pots and pans" [...] robot (Peter), and the body being consumed by a dinosaur held by Peter (to the theme of Jurassic Park). Joan is unconvinced by the video. Peter and his friends then operate plan B, which consists of Quagmire pretending to suffer a heart attack and die. Quagmire is buried in a coffin with enough oxygen to last him {{a short period of time}} so Peter can return after the funeral has finished and dig him up. However, when Mayor West announces that all coffins must be buried in concrete (to guard against zombies), Peter exclaims that Quagmire is not dead, and brings him out of the coffin, alive. Death shows up to retrieve his body. Joan pleads for Quagmire's life, and touches Death's arm, which kills her instantly. Death takes Joan instead, as [...] "she was suicidal and her last name was Quagmire." [...] However, before he leaves, Quagmire asks Death to leave the body for another five minutes, thus turning him back into his old usual self.|$|E

An advisor to the Medici told them in 1516 that <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>get</b> as many young men to wear [...] "the courtier's cap" [...] rather than the cappucci. [...] Part of the connotation seems to arise because the chaperon was too complicated to be taken off on meeting one of higher rank (in Florence at any rate); it was merely touched or pushed back on the head slightly.|$|E

2500|$|As to [...] "preconceived intent", at {{the time}} of the {{investigation}} and prosecution, federal court appellate cases and the INS regulations permitted [...] "dual intent", a desire to stay, but a willingness to comply with the law if denied permanent residence. Further, the relevant intent is that of the employer, not the employee. Given the public nature of Rajneesh's arrival and stay, and the aggressive scrutiny by the INS, Rajneesh would appear to have had to be willing to leave the US if denied benefits. The government nonetheless prosecuted him based on preconceived intent. As to arranging a marriage, the government only claimed that Rajneesh told someone who lived in his house that <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>get</b> married in order to stay. Such encouragement appears to constitute incitement, nor a crime in the US, but not a conspiracy, which requires the formation of a plan and acts in furtherance.|$|E
