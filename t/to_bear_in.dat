He {{tried to bring}} his experiences in combat <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>in</b> his new role, which involved supplying the combat units with men and equipment. For his services in this job, he was awarded a second Legion of Merit. In July 1945 he became commander of Pacific Fleet Air Forces, with the rank of vice admiral.|$|E
5|$|Smuts's {{engagement}} with politics {{was very much}} a product of his time at Stellenbosch. While his parent's political moderation and rejection of Afrikaner exclusivism had left him largely unencumbered by any innate prejudices, it was his time at Victoria College which saw him develop his own independent political outlook. These views developed in tandem with another of Smuts's fixations, his philosophical pursuit of the embodiment of unity. This intellectual quest was later to develop into his philosophy of Holism, but even at this early undeveloped stage he brought these ideas <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>in</b> shaping his political opinions. So it was that Smuts emerged as an outspoken supporter of South African unity, and, by extension, a supporter of Rhodes.|$|E
5|$|To Varro, Hannibal {{seemed to}} have little room to {{maneuver}} and no means of retreat as he was deployed with the Aufidus River to his rear. Varro believed that when pressed hard by the Romans' superior numbers, the Carthaginians would fall back to the river and, with no room to maneuver, would be cut down in panic. Bearing in mind that Hannibal's two previous victories had been largely decided by his trickery and ruse, Varro had sought an open battlefield. The field at Cannae was clear, with no possibility of hidden troops being brought <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>in</b> an ambush.|$|E

5|$|As in {{plot and}} setting, Tolkien brings his {{literary}} theories <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>in</b> forming characters and their interactions. He portrays Bilbo {{as a modern}} anachronism exploring an essentially antique world. Bilbo is able to negotiate and interact within this antique world because language and tradition make connections between the two worlds. For example, Gollum's riddles are taken from old historical sources, while those of Bilbo come from modern nursery books. It is {{the form of the}} riddle game, familiar to both, which allows Gollum and Bilbo to engage each other, rather than the content of the riddles themselves. This idea of a superficial contrast between characters' individual linguistic style, tone and sphere of interest, leading {{to an understanding of the}} deeper unity between the ancient and modern, is a recurring theme in The Hobbit.|$|E
5|$|Farrar {{admitted}} that the marriage was never ideal. He later said that neither had expressed their love to each other, even at {{the early stages of}} marriage. Farrar recounted that Green seemed to lack the coping skills most adults bring <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>in</b> challenging times; when she went into a rage, she sometimes harmed herself or broke things, and rarely gave any thought to whether she was in private or in public during these episodes. By the early 1990s, Farrar worked long hours away from the home to avoid arguments and what he perceived as his wife's shortcomings as a homemaker. When the couple fought, Green responded by treating the children, especially Tim, as small adults and telling them about what their father had done wrong. Swayed by their mother's opinions about their father, the children began to resent and disobey Farrar, to the point where Timothy and Farrar had physical altercations.|$|E

The British forces moved up towards Port Said with air support before digging in at 13:00 to hold until the beach assault.

In addition to specific reliefs, a hardship relief is available at the discretion of the local authority. A relief on non-agricultural business on agricultural land or former agricultural buildings has been removed with effect from 14 August 2006.|$|E

40|$|Tibetan brown bears Ursus arctos pruinosus in the Tibetan Plateau {{attack and}} kill {{livestock}} and ransack homes for food, causing significant economic costs for local herders. Although a government fund compensates herders for livestock lost <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> attacks <b>in</b> the Tibetan Autonomous Region (China), compensation may {{not reflect the}} real cost of losing livestock and payments can be delayed. We investigate whether bear-proof fences are a cost-effective method for reducing bear attacks and livestock losses. In January 2009, 14 bear-proof fences were constructed from wire mesh and steel posts around households which had previously experienced substantial losses <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> attacks <b>in</b> the Nagqu Prefecture of the Tibetan Autonomous Region. These households lost 162 animals <b>to</b> <b>bears</b> <b>in</b> the year before fence construction, whereas just three animals {{were lost in the}} year after fence construction. Fences were still standing 4. 8 years after completion and any small damage has been repaired by households. For households that suffer substantial losses <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> attacks, bear-proof fences appear to be an effective and cost-saving intervention to reduce human-bear conflict.

25|$|In close-quarters {{fighting}} {{there is}} no more deadly weapon than the knife. In choosing a knife there are two important factors <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>in</b> mind: balance and keenness. The hilt should fit easily in your hand, and the blade should not be so heavy that it tends to drag the hilt from your fingers in a loose grip. It is essential that the blade have a sharp stabbing point and good cutting edges, because an artery torn through (as against a clean cut) tends to contract and stop the bleeding. If a main artery is cleanly severed, the wounded man will quickly lose consciousness and die.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} 14 cm/50 3rd Year Type naval guns was {{increased}} from four on the TenryÅ« class to seven on the Kuma class, centerline mounted in individual gun turrets, (two fore, three after {{and one on}} either side of the bridge). The positioning meant that only six of the guns could be brought <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>in</b> a broadside. As with the TenryÅ« class, the Kuma class remained highly deficient in anti-aircraft protection, with only two 8 cm/40 3rd Year Type naval guns and two 6.5mm machine guns. Provision was made for 48 naval mines. The two triple torpedo launchers on the TenryÅ« class was changed to four double launchers, placed in pairs so that four torpedoes could be fired on each side. Eight reloads were also provided.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{principal}} reasons for concern about Ashton's {{translation of the}} title. Firstly, 'Judaism' in English carries the meaning of 'the profession or practice of the Jewish religion; the religious system or the polity of the Jews', a topic on which Wagner does not touch. 'Judentum' however in 19th-century Germany carried a much broader meaningâroughly analogous to the nonce English word 'Jewdom' (cf. Christendom) and including {{the concept of the}} social practices of the Jews. In particular it carried the pejorative sense of 'haggling' or 'marketeering'âit was used in this sense for example by Karl Marx. Undoubtedly Wagner wished to refer to this sense, in effect using the word as a pun, as the commercialism implied forms the topic of the essay as a whole. It is therefore important <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>in</b> mind the full range of implications of the title-word 'Judentum' in considering the essay as a whole. 'Jewishness', whilst not ideal, is perhaps a closer English approximation to 'Judentum' than 'Judaism'.|$|E
