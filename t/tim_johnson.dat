5|$|Despite the state's general Republican and {{conservative}} leanings, Democrats have found success in various statewide elections, {{most notably in}} those involving South Dakota's congressional representatives in Washington. American Indians have been becoming more active in state and county electoral politics. In the 2002 election, American Indian voting carried <b>Tim</b> <b>Johnson</b> as the Democratic candidate {{by a margin of}} 532 votes. Until his electoral defeat in 2004, Senator Tom Daschle was the Senate minority leader (and briefly its majority leader during Democratic control of the Senate in 2001–02).|$|E

25|$|The Raiders' {{touchdown}} {{seemed to}} fire up their defense, who forced the Buccaneers to a fourth down on their ensuing possession. Oakland lineman <b>Tim</b> <b>Johnson</b> then blocked Tupa's punt, and Raiders defender Eric Johnson returned the ball 13 yards for a touchdown. Another two-point conversion for Oakland failed, but Tampa Bay's lead was cut to 34–15.|$|E

25|$|Before {{the start}} of the 1998 season, the Blue Jays {{acquired}} closer Randy Myers and slugger Jose Canseco. Gaston was replaced with former Blue Jay <b>Tim</b> <b>Johnson,</b> a relative unknown as a manager. Despite mediocre hitting, strong pitching led by Clemens' second straight pitching Triple Crown (20–6, 2.65 ERA, 271 strikeouts) sparked the Blue Jays to an 88–74 record – their first winning season since 1993. However, this was only good enough to finish a distant third, 26 games behind the New York Yankees, who posted one of the greatest records in all of baseball history at 114–48. They were, however, in contention for the wildcard spot until the final week.|$|E
25|$|In May 2007, it was {{reported}} that McCain had missed 42 consecutive votes (five straight weeks) in the Senate while he was conducting his presidential campaign. From March to May, McCain only attended three-floor votes in the Senate, though none of McCain's missed votes altered a bill's fate. According to Washington Post statistics, McCain missed more votes than any Senator including <b>Tim</b> <b>Johnson,</b> who missed many votes after suffering a brain hemorrhage in December 2006. As of August 2008, McCain had missed 63.8% of votes in the 110th Congress during his campaign. Because of their majority status, Senate Democrats could sometimes delay votes in order to accommodate the schedules of Democratic presidential candidates.|$|E

25|$|This time, the DVLMF {{commemorative}} coin act {{originated in the}} House of Representatives. Representative Dennis Moore (D-Kansas) introduced H.R. 634 in January 2007, and it passed the House 416-to-0 in May. Senator <b>Tim</b> <b>Johnson</b> then introduced companion legislation (S. 2119) in the Senate in October 2007. The DVLMF told members of Congress that the foundation had raised roughly $43 million of the $65 million needed to build the memorial, and that {{commemorative coin}} sales would allow it to complete fundraising in 2008. The Senate Banking Committee favorably reported the legislation on May 20, 2008, with clarifying legislation from Senator Johnson. The Senate adopted the amended bill by a unanimous vote on June 10, and the House adopted the Senate bill on June 18.|$|E
25|$|Pittsburgh won {{the coin}} toss and {{received}} the ball first, but were quickly forced to punt, and another short kick from Newsome gave Houston the ball with great field position on the Steelers 45-yard line. On the Oilers first play, Moon handed the ball off to Lorenzo White, who was quickly leveled by Woodson and defensive end <b>Tim</b> <b>Johnson,</b> causing a fumble that Woodson recovered and returned four yards to the Oilers 46. From there, Pittsburgh could gain just 13 yards with a few Hoge carries before facing a fourth down. But it was enough for Anderson to kick a 50-yard field goal, his longest attempt of the season, which he sent perfectly through the uprights to give the Steelers the win.|$|E
25|$|Then things {{fell apart}} for Tennessee. Backed {{up at their}} own 11-yard line by a Shane Lechler punt and simply trying to run out the clock, running back Robert Holcombe fumbled the ball while being tackled by Raiders linebacker Eric Barton, and {{defensive}} back Anthony Dorsett, Holcombe's old teammate {{who was a member}} of the Titans when they reached Super Bowl XXXIV, recovered the ball at the Tennessee 16-yard line. On the next play, Rice caught a 15-yard reception at the 1-yard line, and then Gannon found Doug Jolley in the back of the end zone for a 1-yard touchdown pass, giving the Raiders a 21–17 lead. Then on the ensuing kickoff, rookie returner John Simon was stripped of the ball by <b>Tim</b> <b>Johnson</b> and Alvis Whitted recovered the fumble for Oakland on the Titans 39-yard line, setting up a 43-yard field goal by Sebastian Janikowski on the last play of the first half, making the score 24-17.|$|E

25|$|Before the 1999 season, the Blue Jays traded Clemens to the Yankees for {{starting}} pitcher David Wells, second baseman Homer Bush and relief pitcher Graeme Lloyd. They also fired manager <b>Tim</b> <b>Johnson</b> during spring training after {{he lied about}} several things (including killing people in the Vietnam War) in order to motivate his players. The Blue Jays had initially been willing to stand by Johnson. A blizzard of questions about his credibility during spring training, however, led Ash to fire him {{less than a month}} before opening day. Johnson was replaced with Jim Fregosi, who managed the Phillies when they lost to the Blue Jays in the 1993 World Series. The offense picked up somewhat in 1999, but the pitching suffered without Clemens, as the Blue Jays finished at 84–78, in third place. After the 1999 season, the Blue Jays' original mascot for 20 years, BJ Birdy, was replaced by a duo named Ace & Diamond.|$|E
25|$|Fundraising also continued. The DVLMF {{contracted}} with Tom Brokaw, former NBC News anchor {{and author of}} the book The Greatest Generation (1998), to host a fundraiser in New York City in April 2004, and the estate of Jesse Brown (who died in 2002) agreed to donate the proceeds of Brown's book The Price of Their Blood: Profiles in Spirit (which documented the lives of 10 disabled veterans) to the memorial construction fund. But one fundraising effort was stalled. Senator <b>Tim</b> <b>Johnson</b> (D-South Dakota) introduced legislation in July 2003 to authorize the United States Mint to manufacture commemorative coins which would be sold to raise money for the memorial. The coins would sell for $10 each (with a legal tender face value of $1). The cost of manufacturing the coins would come from the sale price, with the remainder going to the memorial construction fund. Johnson submitted additional legislation in 2004 after the 2003 bill stalled. This legislation passed the Senate, but stalled in the House. Johnson's bill died at the end of the 108th Congress, locked in a House committee. Nevertheless, the DVLMF said in April 2004 construction on the memorial would begin in the spring of 2005.|$|E
