According to an article published 16 Sep 2015 in The Lancet, which reviewed the safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity of VGX-3100 in a double-blind, randomized controlled trial (phase 2b) targeting HPV-16 and HPV-18 E6 and E7 proteins for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2/3, {{it is the first}} <b>therapeutic</b> <b>vaccine</b> to show efficacy against CIN 2/3 associated with HPV-16 and HPV-18. In June, 2017, VGX-3100 entered a phase 3 clinical trial called REVEAL-1 for the treatment of HPV-induced high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. The estimated completion time for collecting primary clinical endpoint data is August, 2019.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT 23 Numerous {{versions}} of human papillomavirus (HPV) <b>therapeutic</b> <b>vaccines</b> designed to treat 24 individuals with established HPV infection, {{including those with}} cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 25 (CIN), are in development as approved prophylactic vaccines are not effective once HPV 26 infection is established. As human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV 16) is most commonly detected 27 globally, all {{versions of}} HPV <b>therapeutic</b> <b>vaccines</b> contain HPV 16 and some also contain 28 human papillomavirus type 18. While these two HPV types are responsible for approximately 29 70 % of cervical cancer cases, there are other high-risk HPV types known to cause malignancy. 30 Therefore, it would {{be of interest to}} assess whether these HPV <b>therapeutic</b> <b>vaccines</b> may confer 31 cross-protection against other high-risk HPV types. Data available from a few clinical trials that 32 enrolled subjects with CINs regardless of HPV types present demonstrated clinical response, as 33 measured by CIN regression, in subjects with both vaccine-matched and non-vaccine HPV 34 types.

40|$|Human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) {{is widely}} {{known as a}} cause of cervical cancer (CC) and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). HPVs related to cancer express two main oncogenes, i. e. E 6 and E 7, considered as tumorigenic genes; their integration into the host genome results in the abnormal regulation of cell cycle control. Due to their peculiarities, these oncogenes represent an excellent target for cancer immunotherapy. In this work the authors highlight the potential use of <b>therapeutic</b> <b>vaccines</b> as safe and effective pharmacological tools in cervical disease, focusing on vaccines that have reached the clinical trial phase. Many <b>therapeutic</b> HPV <b>vaccines</b> have been tested in clinical trials with promising results. Adoptive T-cell therapy showed clinical activity in a phase II trial involving advanced CC patients. A phase II randomized trial showed clinical activity of a nucleic acid-based vaccine in HPV 16 or HPV 18 positive CIN. Several trials involving peptide-protein-based vaccines and live-vector based vaccines demonstrated that these approaches are effective in CIN as well as in advanced CC patients. HPV <b>therapeutic</b> <b>vaccines</b> must be regarded as a therapeutic option in cervical disease. The synergic combination of HPV <b>therapeutic</b> <b>vaccines</b> with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immunomodulators or immune checkpoint inhibitors opens a new and interesting scenario in this disease...|$|R

40|$|Cervical cancer is, {{globally}} {{known to}} be, {{one of the}} most common cancers among women especially in developing countries. More than 90 % of cervical cancers are associated with high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) particularly HPV types 16 and 18. Two major strategies have been developed for prevention and treatment of cervical cancer and other HPV-associated malignancies; the first one is based on HPV virus-like particles (VLPs) containing HPV structural proteins. VLP based vaccines can induce genotype specific virus neutralizing antibodies for preventing HPV infections. The other strategy is based on HPV early genes especially E 6 and E 7 for eliminating the established HPV infections; therefore they are classified as HPV <b>therapeutic</b> <b>vaccines.</b> This article reviews the preventive and <b>therapeutic</b> <b>vaccines</b> against HPV infections and cervical cancer...|$|R

40|$|Pathology in most chronic {{inflammatory}} diseases {{is characterized}} by an imbalance in cytokine expression. Targeting cytokines with monoclonal antibodies {{has proven to be}} a highly effective treatment. However, monoclonal antibody therapy has disadvantages such as high production costs, generation of antimonoclonal antibodies and the inconvenience of frequent injections. <b>Therapeutic</b> <b>vaccines</b> have the potential to overcome these limitations. The aim of active vaccination is to induce B-cell responses and obtain autoantibodies capable of neutralizing the interaction of the targeted cytokine with its receptor. In order to achieve this, <b>therapeutic</b> <b>vaccines</b> need to circumvent the potent tolerance mechanisms that exist to prevent immune responses against self-molecules. This article focuses on the tolerance mechanisms of the B- and T-cell compartments and how these may be manipulated to obtain high-affinity autoantibodies without inducing potentially dangerous autoreactive T-cell responses...|$|R
