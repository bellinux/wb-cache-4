50|$|The coconut cultivars {{grown in}} Oman are {{generally}} of the drought-resistant Indian 'West Coast tall' variety.

This airlift was completed in mid-January, by which time the Australian C-17 had made eight flights into South Sudan from Brindisi in Italy and Djibouti. During September and December 2014, RAAF Globemasters flew five sorties into Iraq to deliver weapons and ammunition destined for Iraqi forces fighting the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Following the deployment of Australian fighter aircraft in late 2014 to attack ISIL forces as part of Operation Okra, C-17s have also conducted regular flights from Australia <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> carrying munitions and specialised equipment.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} May 1945, the {{division}} was pulled out of Germany and returned to England. It was initially intended {{to send them to}} India to form an airborne corps with the 44th Indian Airborne Division. The divisionâ€™s advance party, formed around the 5th Parachute Brigade, had already arrived in India. Following the Japanese surrender, all these plans changed. The post-war British Army only needed one airborne division, and the 6th Airborne was chosen to remain on strength.

The three AIF infantry divisions sent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> saw extensive action, as did the RAAF squadrons and warships in this theatre.|$|E

5|$|Given these risks, as {{smallpox}} became effectively eradicated and {{the number}} of naturally occurring cases fell below the number of vaccine-induced illnesses and deaths, routine childhood vaccination was discontinued in the United States in 1972, and was abandoned in most European countries in the early 1970s. Routine vaccination of health care workers was discontinued in the U.S. in 1976, and among military recruits in 1990 (although military personnel deploying <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> and Korea still receive the vaccination). By 1986, routine vaccination had ceased in all countries. It is now primarily recommended for laboratory workers at risk for occupational exposure.|$|E
