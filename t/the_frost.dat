5000|$|Within the American Wiccan {{and wider}} modern Pagan community, <b>the</b> <b>Frosts</b> {{have been at}} the centre of various disputes, {{particularly}} surrounding issues such as homosexuality and theology. The Wiccan Margot Adler suggested that much of this controversy stemmed from Gavin's [...] "wry and rather bizarre sense of humor, and his tendency to say anything to get a rise out of someone", something which she thought had resulted in <b>the</b> <b>Frosts</b> often being [...] "misunderstood". In person, she thought, <b>the</b> <b>Frosts</b> [...] "have always been delightful", with Gavin being [...] "kind and humorous" [...] and Yvonne being [...] "forthright and even a bit prim".|$|R
5|$|In 1966, Barker got his {{break with}} the satirical sketch series <b>The</b> <b>Frost</b> Report, having been {{recommended}} for the show by producer James Gilbert. The show starred David Frost, John Cleese and Barker's future comedy partner Ronnie Corbett, whom he had met in 1963 when Corbett was the barman at the Buckstone Club near the Haymarket Theatre, and the two became friends. Corbett stated in his autobiography that the two had gravitated towards each other because of their similar backgrounds; neither had attended university, {{while many of the}} other Frost Report cast and writers had. Each episode of the show, which was performed and broadcast live, was focused on a single topic and principally revolved around a continuous monologue from Frost, with sketches from Barker, Corbett and Cleese as the show went on. Barker starred alongside Cleese and Corbett in <b>The</b> <b>Frost</b> Reports best known sketch, which satirised the British class system, with Barker representing the middle class.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the solar}} nebular disk model, rocky planets {{form in the}} inner part of the protoplanetary disk, within <b>the</b> <b>frost</b> line, where the {{temperature}} is high enough to prevent condensation of water ice and other substances into grains.

5|$|Children's book Tom's Midnight Garden by Philippa Pearce {{is partly}} set in Ely and {{includes}} a scene in Ely Cathedral and scenes inspired by the author's father's own childhood experiences of skating along the frozen river from Cambridge to Ely in <b>the</b> <b>frost</b> of 1894–95. The first series of Jim Kelly's crime novels, featuring journalist Philip Dryden, is largely set in the author's home town of Ely and in the Fens.

5|$|Ganymede {{also has}} polar caps, likely {{composed}} of water frost. <b>The</b> <b>frost</b> extends to 40° latitude. These polar caps were first {{seen by the}} Voyager spacecraft. Theories on {{the formation of the}} caps include the migration of water to higher latitudes and bombardment of the ice by plasma. Data from Galileo suggests the latter is correct. The presence of a magnetic field on Ganymede results in more intense charged particle bombardment of its surface in the unprotected polar regions; sputtering then leads to redistribution of water molecules, with frost migrating to locally colder areas within the polar terrain.|$|E

5|$|The inner Solar System is {{the region}} {{comprising}} the terrestrial planets and the asteroid belt.

5|$|The Sun, which {{comprises}} {{nearly all}} the matter in the Solar System, is composed of roughly 98% hydrogen and helium. Jupiter and Saturn, which comprise {{nearly all the}} remaining matter, are also primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. A composition gradient exists in the Solar System, created by heat and light pressure from the Sun; those objects closer to the Sun, which are more affected by heat and light pressure, are composed of elements with high melting points. Objects farther from the Sun are composed largely of materials with lower melting points. The boundary in the Solar System beyond which those volatile substances could condense is known as <b>the</b> <b>frost</b> line, and it lies at roughly 5 AU from the Sun.|$|E

5|$|The {{bulk of the}} {{adventure}} takes place in two locations: the upper level fortress of the hill giants' lair, and the dungeon level beneath it. In the upper level there are halls, barracks and common rooms. These rooms house Chief Nosnra and other hill giants, ogres, and servants. The dungeon level consists of slave quarters, torture chambers, and caverns. These house troglodytes, bugbears, and carrion crawlers. The majority of the treasure can be found by searching the dungeons. The chief's treasure room contains {{a map of the}} glacial rift from Glacial Rift of <b>the</b> <b>Frost</b> Giant Jarl, and a magic chain that automatically transports the party there.|$|E
5|$|Dew {{point is}} the {{temperature}} to which a given parcel of air must be cooled, at constant atmospheric pressure, for water vapor to condense into water. The condensed water is called dew. The dew point is a saturation point. When the dew point temperature falls below freezing it is called <b>the</b> <b>frost</b> point, as the water vapor no longer creates dew but instead creates frost or hoarfrost by deposition. The dew point is associated with relative humidity. A high relative humidity indicates that the dew point {{is closer to the}} current air temperature. If the relative humidity is 100%, the dew point is equal to the current temperature. Given a constant dew point, an increase in temperature will lead to a decrease in relative humidity. At a given barometric pressure, independent of temperature, the dew point determines the specific humidity of the air. The dew point is an important statistic for general aviation pilots, as it is used to calculate the likelihood of carburetor icing and fog. When used with the air temperature, a formula can be used to estimate the height of cumuliform, or convective, clouds.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} higher boiling points, only metals and silicates could exist in solid {{form in the}} warm inner Solar System close to the Sun, and these would {{eventually}} form the rocky planets of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Because metallic elements only comprised a very {{small fraction of the}} solar nebula, the terrestrial planets could not grow very large. The giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) formed further out, beyond <b>the</b> <b>frost</b> line, the point between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where material is cool enough for volatile icy compounds to remain solid. The ices that formed these planets were more plentiful than the metals and silicates that formed the terrestrial inner planets, allowing them to grow massive enough to capture large atmospheres of hydrogen and helium, the lightest and most abundant elements. Leftover debris that never became planets congregated in regions such as the asteroid belt, Kuiper belt, and Oort cloud. The Nice model is an explanation for the creation of these regions and how the outer planets could have formed in different positions and migrated to their current orbits through various gravitational interactions.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> {{effect of}} <b>frost</b> {{formation}} on <b>the</b> {{performance of a}} domestic refrigerator-freezer evaporator coil was investigated. A low temperature evaporator test facility was developed to closely simulate refrigerator-freezer conditions. <b>The</b> rate of <b>frost</b> deposition on <b>the</b> evaporator {{was determined to be}} constant with respect to time for a ten-hour testing period over a range of air inlet temperatures and relative humidities, refrigerant temperatures, and airflow rates. Higher humidities and air inlet temperatures and lower refrigerant temperatures were found to increase <b>the</b> <b>frosting</b> rate significantly. Varying the airflow rate was found to slightly affect <b>the</b> <b>frosting</b> rate. Increasing <b>the</b> airflow rate increased <b>the</b> <b>frosting</b> rate a small amount, while, decreasing the airflow rate decreased <b>the</b> <b>frosting</b> rate an equally small amount. However, it appears that the actual correlation between airflow rate and frosting rate is not this straight-forward, but is, instead, the result of the influences of the mass transfer coefficient, the evaporator surface temperature, and the air moisture capacity. How these factors balance one another determines the actual relationship between frost rate and airflow. rate. In addition to these findings, {{it was found that the}} UA-value of the evaporator increased as <b>frost</b> was-deposited on <b>the</b> coil while a constant airflow rate was maintained through the coil. The increase at <b>the</b> highest <b>frosting</b> rates was on the order of 40 % but was accompanied by an exponentially increasing air side pressure drop.
