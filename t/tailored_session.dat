40|$|QuestionDoes {{the timing}} of {{inhalation}} of dornase alpha in relation to physical airway clearance techniques influence {{the effect of the}} entire airway clearance regimen?. DesignA randomised crossover trial with concealed allocation, intention-to-treat analysis and blinding of patients, therapists, and assessors. ParticipantsTwenty adults with cystic fibrosis who were not taking dornase alpha were recruited, of whom 17 were randomised and completed the trial. InterventionParticipants performed an individually <b>tailored</b> <b>session</b> of physical airway clearance techniques for at least 15 minutes per day for 28 days. For 14 days, dornase alpha was inhaled before each session of airway clearance techniques and a placebo was inhaled after. For the other 14 days, placebo was inhaled before and dornase alpha after airway clearance techniques. The order of the two 14 -day periods was randomised. Outcome measuresThe primary outcome was the forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV 1). Secondary outcomes were forced vital capacity, 24 -hour sputum production, sputum production during the airway clearance regimen, oxygen saturation, peak oxygen consumption during an incremental exercise test, oxygen desaturation during exercise, and quality of life. ResultsInhalation of dornase alpha after airway clearance techniques did not significantly affect the change in FEV 1 compared with inhalation before airway clearance techniques, mean difference 0. 04 L, 95 % CI − 0. 14 to 0. 23. None of the secondary outcomes differed significantly between the study arms. There was good correlation between the change in FEV 1 and the change in quality of life scores. ConclusionTiming of dornase alpha can be selected according to convenience, patient preference, or to accommodate {{the timing of}} other medications in the treatment regimen.

40|$|UNLABELLED: Using a protocolled {{intervention}} program, pharmacists can decrease nonadherence to osteoporosis medication, by {{continuous monitoring}} and <b>tailored</b> counseling <b>sessions,</b> starting at treatment initiation. In the usual care group, 32. 8 % {{of patients in}}itiating osteoporosis medication discontinued or were nonadherent, compared to 19. 0 % of patients in the intervention group. PURPOSE: While community pharmacies {{have been shown to}} offer a promising platform for osteoporosis management in patients with osteoporosis, {{more research is needed to}} determine pharmacists' effects on improving adherence. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of a community pharmacists' intervention program on the 1 -year discontinuation and nonadherence rates of patients initiating osteoporosis medication. METHODS: This intervention study included 937 patients, recruited from 13 Dutch community pharmacies, initiating osteoporosis medication. The intervention group (N = 495), received the Medication Monitoring and Optimization (MeMO) intervention, comprising of continuous monitoring of patients' adherence to their osteoporosis medication and <b>tailored</b> counseling <b>sessions</b> with nonadherent patients. Results were compared to an internal (n = 442) reference group, receiving usual pharmacy care. Primary study outcomes were therapy discontinuation and nonadherence; results were adjusted for potential confounders using Cox proportional hazard analysis. Secondary outcome was patients' satisfaction. RESULTS: In the usual care group, 32. 8 % of patients initiating osteoporosis medication discontinued or were nonadherent, compared to 19. 0 % of patients in the intervention group (P < 0. 001). Ninety-three percent of the respondents were satisfied with the pharmacies' services provided. Notably, 31 % mentioned that the pharmacy was the only place where they received information on various aspects of administration and acting of their medication. CONCLUSION: Pharmacists can decrease nonadherence and discontinuation with osteoporosis medication by providing <b>tailored</b> counseling <b>sessions</b> and continuous monitoring of drug use.

40|$|Low {{back pain}} {{is a highly}} {{prevalent}} condition with a significant global burden. Management of lifestyle factors such as overweight and obesity may improve low back pain patient outcomes. Currently there are no randomised controlled trials that have been conducted to assess the effectiveness of lifestyle behavioural interventions in managing low back pain. The aim of this trial is {{to determine if a}} telephone-based lifestyle behavioural intervention is effective in reducing pain intensity in overweight or obese patients with low back pain, compared to usual care. A randomised controlled trial will be conducted with patients waiting for an outpatient consultation with an orthopaedic surgeon at a public tertiary referral hospital within New South Wales, Australia for chronic low back pain. Patients will be randomly allocated in a 1 : 1 ratio to receive a lifestyle behavioural intervention (intervention group) or continue with usual care (control group). After baseline data collection, patients in the intervention group will receive a clinical consultation followed by a 6 -month telephone-based lifestyle behavioural intervention (10 individually <b>tailored</b> <b>sessions</b> over a 6 -month period) and patients in the control group will continue with usual care. Participants will be followed for 26 weeks and asked to undertake three self-reported questionnaires at baseline (pre-randomisation), week 6 and 26 post randomisation to collect primary and secondary outcome data. The study requires a sample of 80 participants per group to detect a 1. 5 point difference in pain intensity (primary outcome) 26 weeks post randomisation.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} long term effects of two {{different}} modes of disease management (comprehensive self management and routine monitoring) on quality of life (primary objective), frequency and patients' management of exacerbations, and self efficacy (secondary objectives) in patients with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) in general practice. DESIGN: 24 month, multicentre, investigator blinded, three arm, pragmatic, randomised controlled trial. SETTING: 15 general practices {{in the eastern part of}} the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with COPD confirmed by spirometry and treated in general practice. Patients with very severe COPD or treated by a respiratory physician were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: A comprehensive self management programme as an adjunct to usual care, consisting of four <b>tailored</b> <b>sessions</b> with ongoing telephone support by a practice nurse; routine monitoring as an adjunct to usual care, consisting of 2 - 4 structured consultations a year with a practice nurse; or usual care alone (contacts with the general practitioner at the patients' own initiative). OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the change in COPD specific quality of life at 24 months as measured with the chronic respiratory questionnaire total score. Secondary outcomes were chronic respiratory questionnaire domain scores, frequency and patients' management of exacerbations measured with the Nijmegen telephonic exacerbation assessment system, and self efficacy measured with the COPD self-efficacy scale. RESULTS: 165 patients were allocated to self management (n= 55), routine monitoring (n= 55), or usual care alone (n= 55). At 24 months, adjusted treatment differences between the three groups in mean chronic respiratory questionnaire total score were not significant. Secondary outcomes did not differ, except for exacerbation management. Compared with usual care, more exacerbations in the self management group were managed with bronchodilators (odds ratio 2. 81, 95 % confidence interval 1. 16 to 6. 82) and with prednisolone, antibiotics, or both (3. 98, 1. 10 to 15. 58). CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive self management or routine monitoring did not show long term benefits in terms of quality of life or self efficacy over usual care alone in COPD patients in general practice. Patients in the self management group seemed to be more capable of appropriately managing exacerbations than did those in the usual care group. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical trials NCT 00128765...|$|R

40|$|Objectives To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of using electronic registers to identify and improve management of high-risk asthma patients in primary care. Design Cluster-randomised controlled trial with stratification by high/low deprivation scores and 1 -year follow-up. Participants 29 GP practices in Norfolk, UK with suitable software systems used electronic searches and clinical knowledge to identify 911 patients aged 5 +?years at high risk from their asthma as defined by British asthma guidelines (severe asthma plus adverse psychosocial characteristics, including poor adherence). Intervention Intervention practices established registers of high-risk asthma patients and used an electronic alert to identify these patients at all practice encounters. This allowed reception staff to prioritise appointments and facilitate patient access to clinicians and clinical staff to review patients' asthma at all opportunities.

40|$|Background. Colonoscopy nonattendance is a {{challenge}} for outpatient clinics globally. Absenteeism results in a potential delay in disease diagnosis and loss of hospital resources. This study aims to determine reasons for colonoscopy nonattendance from a Canadian perspective. Design. Demographic data, reasons for nonattendance, and patient suggestions for improving compliance were elicited from 49 out of 144 eligible study participants via telephone questionnaire. The 49 nonattenders were compared to age and sex matched controls for several potential contributing factors. Results. Nonattendance rates were significantly higher in winter months; the OR of nonattendance was 5. 2 (95 % CI, 1. 6 to 17. 0, p< 0. 001) in winter versus other months. Being married was positively associated with attendance. There was no significant association between nonattendance and {{any of the other}} variables examined. The top 3 reasons for nonattendance were being too unwell to attend the procedure, being unable to complete bowel preparation, or experiencing logistical challenges. Conclusions. Colonoscopy attendance rates appear to vary significantly by season and it may be beneficial to book more colonoscopies in the summer or overbook in the winter. Targets for intervention include more <b>tailored</b> teaching <b>sessions,</b> reminders, taxi chits, and developing a hospital specific colonoscopy video regarding procedure and bowel preparation requirements...|$|R

40|$|Background. There is {{currently}} a trend towards unsafe unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) among {{men who have sex}} with men. We evaluated a short individual counselling session on reducing UAI among gay and bisexual men. Methods. A quasi-experimental design was used to evaluate the counselling session. This session was conducted during consulting hours at four municipal health clinics during a Hepatitis B vaccination campaign. These clinics offered free vaccination to high-risk groups, such as gay and bisexual men. All gay and bisexual men attending health clinics in four cities in the Netherlands were asked to participate. Each participant in the intervention group received a fifteen-minute individual counselling based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour and Motivational Interviewing. Changes in UAI were measured over a 5 -months period, using self-administered questionnaires. UAI was measured separately for receptive and insertive intercourse in steady and casual partners. These measures were combined in an index-score (range 0 - 8). Results. While UAI in the counselling group remained stable, it increased in the controls by 66 % from 0. 41 to 0. 68. The results show that the intervention had a protective effect on sexual behaviour with steady partners. Intervention effects were strongest within steady relationships, especially for men whose steady-relationship status changed during the study.

40|$|Aim:To {{determine}} the extent to which children's mastery motivation predicts occupational performance outcomes following upper limb intervention (ULI). Method: In this cohort study, participants received 45  hours of ULI, either in an intensive group-based or distributed individualized model. The Dimensions of Mastery Questionnaire (DMQ) measured mastery motivation at baseline. Occupational performance outcomes were assessed at baseline and 13  weeks’ post-intervention using the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM). Multivariable models determined the contribution of mastery motivation to COPM outcome irrespective of group membership. Results: Forty-two children with congenital hemiplegia (29 males, 13 females; mean age 7 y 8 mo [SD 2 y 2 mo]; range 5 y 1 mo– 12 y 8 mo; Manual Ability Classification System [MACS] I= 20 and II= 22; predominant motor type unilateral spastic n= 41) participated in the study.

40|$|Variants are {{changes in}} the DNA whose {{phenotypic}} effects {{may or may not}} be definitively understood. Because variant interpretation is a complex process, sources sometimes disagree on the classification of a variant, which is called a variant discrepancy. This study aimed to determine the practice of genetic counselors regarding variant discrepancies and to identify the barriers to counseling a variant discrepancy in hereditary cancer genetic testing. This investigation was unique because it was the first to address variant discrepancies from a clinical point of view. An electronic survey was sent to genetic counselors in the NSGC Cancer Special Interest Group. The vast majority of counselors (93 %) had seen a variant discrepancy in practice. The most commonly selected barriers to counseling a variant discrepancy were lack of data sharing (90 %) and lack of a central database (76 %). Most counselors responded that the ideal database would be owned by a non-profit (59 %) and obtain information directly from laboratories (91 %). When asked how they approached counseling sessions involving variant discrepancies, the free responses emphasized that counselors consider family history and psychosocial concerns, showing that genetic counselors <b>tailored</b> the <b>session</b> to each individual. Variant discrepancies are an ongoing concern for clinical cancer genetic counselors, as demonstrated by the fact that counselors desired further resources to aid in addressing variant discrepancies, including a centralized database (89 %), guidelines from a major organization (88 %), continuing education about the issue (74 %) and functional studies (58 %) ...|$|R

He reminded the audience that the first vaccine produced in Vietnam was oral polio vaccine (OPV) in the early 1960 s and contributed to polio eradication in Vietnam, in 2000. Through its manufacturing resources, Vietnam eliminated neonatal tetanus in 2005, and has controlled measles and hepatitis B spread. The Ministry of Health hopes that by sharing experiences, delegates at this conference will foster international cooperation and partnerships among organizations. CEOs elaborated on challenges and opportunities for emerging countries...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Increasing {{moderate}} to vigorous physical activity among urban girls of low socioeconomic status {{is both a}} challenge and a public health priority. Physical activity interventions targeting exclusively girls remain limited, and maintenance of {{moderate to}} vigorous physical activity during the post-intervention period {{has been difficult to}} maintain. The main aim of the 5 -year “Girls on the Move” group randomized trial is to evaluate the efficacy of a comprehensive school-based intervention in increasing girls’ minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity and improving cardiovascular fitness, body mass index, and percent body fat immediately post-intervention (after 17 weeks) and at 9 -month post-intervention follow-up (9 months after end of intervention). Methods/Design A total of 24 urban middle schools in the Midwestern U. S. will be randomized to either receive the intervention or serve as a control (N = 1200 girls). The intervention, based on the Health Promotion Model and Self-Determination Theory, will include: (1) two face-to-face motivational, individually <b>tailored</b> counseling <b>sessions</b> with a registered nurse, one at the beginning and the other {{at the end of the}} intervention period; (2) an interactive Internet-based session during which each girl receives individually tailored motivational and feedback messages via iPad at 11 weeks (shortly after midpoint of intervention); and (3) a 90 -minute after-school physical activity club. Racially diverse, low-active, 10 - to 14 -year-old 5 th to 8 th-grade girls will complete questionnaires and physical measures at baseline and post-intervention (n = 50 per school). Minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity will be assessed with accelerometers. Cardiovascular fitness will be assessed by estimating VO 2 max with PACER (Progressive Aerobic Cardiovascular Endurance Run) scores. Height and weight will be assessed to calculate body mass index. Percent body fat will be estimated with a foot-to-foot bioelectric impedance scale. Linear mixed effects regression analyses will be performed to assess intervention effects. Discussion This multi-component approach is expected to improve girls’ moderate to vigorous physical activity and related physical outcomes.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Family {{and friend}} {{participation}} may provide culturally salient social support {{for weight loss}} in African American adults. METHODS: SHARE (Supporting Healthy Activity and eating Right Everyday) was a 2 -year trial of a culturally specific weight loss program. African American {{women and men who}} enrolled alone (individual stratum, 63 index participants) or together with 1 or 2 family members or friends (family stratum, 130 index participants) were randomized, within strata, to high or low social support treatments; 90 % were female. RESULTS: At 6 months, the family index participants lost approximately 5 to 6 kg; the individual index participants lost approximately 3 to 4 kg. The mean weight change was not different in high vs low social support in either stratum and generally not when high or low support treatments were compared across strata. The overall intention-to-treat mean weight change at 24 months was - 2. 4 kg (95 % confidence interval, - 3. 3 kg to - 1. 5 kg). The family index participant weight loss was greater among the participants whose partners attended more personally <b>tailored</b> counseling <b>sessions</b> at 6 months in the high-support group and at 6, 12, and 24 months in the low-support group (all P <. 05). Also, in the 6 -month intention-to-treat analysis, the percentage of weight loss of the family index participants was greater if partners lost at least 5 % vs less than 5 % of their baseline weight (respectively, - 6. 1 % vs - 2. 9 % [P =. 004], high support; and - 6. 1 % vs - 3. 1 % [P =. 01], low support). CONCLUSIONS: Being assigned to participate with family members, friends, or other group members had no effect on weight change. Enrolling with others was associated with greater weight loss only when partners participated more and lost more weight. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials. gov Identifier: NCT 00146081...|$|R
40|$|Background: Implementation of World Health Organization case {{management}} guidelines for serious childhood illnesses remains {{a challenge in}} hospitals in low-income countries. Facilitators of and barriers to implementation of locally adapted clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) have not been explored. Methods. This ethnographic study based on the theory of participatory action research (PAR) was conducted in Kenyatta National Hospital, Kenya's largest teaching hospital. The primary intervention consisted of dissemination of locally adapted CPGs. The PRECEDE-PROCEED health education model {{was used as the}} conceptual framework to guide and examine further reinforcement activities to improve the uptake of the CPGs. Activities focussed on introduction of routine clinical audits and <b>tailored</b> educational <b>sessions.</b> Data were collected by a participant observer who also facilitated the PAR over an eighteen-month period. Naturalistic inquiry was utilized to obtain information from all hospital staff encountered while theoretical sampling allowed in-depth exploration of emerging issues. Data were analysed using interpretive description. Results: Relevance of the CPGs to routine work and emergence of a champion of change facilitated uptake of best-practices. Mobilization of basic resources was relatively easily undertaken while activities that required real intellectual and professional engagement of the senior staff were a challenge. Accomplishments of the PAR were largely with the passive rather than active involvement of the hospital management. Barriers to implementation of best-practices included i) mismatch between the hospital's vision and reality, ii) poor communication, iii) lack of objective mechanisms for monitoring and evaluating quality of clinical care, iv) limited capacity for planning strategic change, v) limited management skills to introduce and manage change, vi) hierarchical relationships, and vii) inadequate adaptation of the interventions to the local context. Conclusions: Educational interventions, often regarded as 'quick-fixes' to improve care in low-income countries, may be necessary but are unlikely to be sufficient to deliver improved services. We propose that an understanding of organizational issues that influence the behaviour of individual health professionals should guide and inform the implementation of best-practices. © 2014 Irimu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{aim of the}} “School of the Future” project (www. school-of-the-future. eu [1]), which {{receives}} funding {{within the}} EU's 7 th Framework Programme, is to design, demonstrate, evaluate and communicate shining examples of how to reach the future high- performance building level. School buildings and their primary users, namely pupils - the next generation - are in {{the focus of the}} project. Both, the energy and indoor environment performance of 4 demonstration buildings in 4 European countries and climates are being greatly improved due to holistic retrofit of the building envelope, the service systems, the integration of renewables and building management systems. The results and the accompanying research and dissemination efforts to support other actors dealing with building retrofits are leading to a multiplied impact on other schools and on the residential sector, since the pupils will act as communicators to their families. The user behaviour and the awareness of energy efficiency and indoor environment are being improved due to <b>tailored</b> training <b>sessions.</b> Nearly zero emission or nearly zero energy buildings are main goals in various country roadmaps for 2020. The demonstration buildings of this project may not completely reach this level, though, as the aim of the FP 7 call is cost efficiency and multiplication potential. The retrofit concepts, however, result in buildings with far lower energy consumption than achieved by regular retrofits and focus on high indoor environment quality - thus leading the way towards zero emission. They can be considered as schools of the future. Results from national examples of zero emission schools complete the information used for developing the deliverables such as guidelines, information tools, publications and a community at the EU BUILD UP portal. The project is based on a close connection between demonstration, research and industry which is being represented by the “Design Advice and Evaluation Group”. This group of research and industry partners meets twice at every demonstration building site in order to give advice to the local planning group like informing them about suitable up-to-date technologies...|$|R

Objectives: The primary aim {{of this study was to}} determine the attitudes and beliefs of patients with depression toward depression and antidepressants. A secondary aim was to assess the influence of ethnicity on patients’ attitudes and beliefs. Patients and methods: The study involved patients with chronic depression being followed up at an outpatient clinic at a government-run hospital in Malaysia. Patients’ attitudes and beliefs were assessed using the Antidepressant Compliance Questionnaire. Results: A total of 104 patients of Malay, Chinese, and Indian ethnic groups met the selection criteria. Chinese patients had significantly negative attitudes and beliefs toward depression and antidepressants compared to Malays and Indians (b=- 8. 96, t 103 =- 3. 22; P< 0. 05). Component analysis revealed that 59 % of patients believed that antidepressants can cause a person to have less control over their thoughts and feelings, while 67 % believed that antidepressants could alter one’s personality; 60 % believed it was okay to take fewer tablets on days when they felt better, while 66 % believed that antidepressants helped solve their emotional problems and helped them worry less. Conclusion: Patients had an overall positive view as to the benefits of antidepressants, but the majority had incorrect views as to the acceptable dosing of antidepressants and had concerns about the safety of the medication. Assessing patients’ attitudes and beliefs, as well as the impact of their respective cultures, can be used in <b>tailoring</b> psychoeducation <b>sessions</b> accordingly.

40|$|In society, {{breast cancer}} is erroneously {{considered}} to be a female disease. Information regarding the psychosocial, sociocultural, and familial experiences of men diagnosed with breast cancer remains scant. Given the low incidence of male breast cancer in the general population, all diagnosis are considered as an indication for referral for genetic counseling and/or testing. Thus, counselors are often involved in the care of men with breast cancer and assist patients in understanding and adapting to the medical and psychosocial implications of genetic contributions to disease. Genetic counselors {{are in a position to}} inform not only men with breast cancer, but also all at risk family members of the implication of genetic risk information. Because of the broad reach of counselors to many individuals, which makes it relevant to public health, it is important to get a baseline picture of the current state of the counseling environment so that potential issues can be identified that might inadvertently perpetuate the stereotypes surrounding these men. It is also important for counselors to be aware of their own beliefs about the process of counseling men with breast cancer as such beliefs can influence assumptions made about the counselee and therefore can potentially affect the dynamics of the counseling session. We conducted a survey study of genetic counselors in the United States to assess these issues. The majority of respondents are female with 1 - 5 years’ experiences in cancer genetic counseling and reported seeing an average of 1 - 5 males breast cancer patient per year. The genetic counseling environment appears to be supportive for men with breast cancer. Gender does not play a role in the comfort level of either the counselor or counselee. Men appear to pay a more active role in the genetic counseling process than the literature suggests. This may be due to the fact that counselors consider themselves to be an important source of support for these men and often take a proactive approach in the assessment of psychosocial needs. In conclusion, more research is needed to determine specific informational and psychosocial needs of men with breast cancer so that counselors can <b>tailor</b> a <b>session</b> which will assist men to make optimal health care choices...|$|R
