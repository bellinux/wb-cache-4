5|$|The Tenth Amendment {{reinforces}} {{the principles of}} separation of powers and federalism by providing that powers not granted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> by the Constitution, nor prohibited to the states, are reserved to the states or the people. The amendment provides no new powers or rights to the states, but rather preserves their authority in all matters not specifically granted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government.</b>|$|E
5|$|Members of the United States Congress {{started work}} in 1924 on {{upgrading}} Bryce Canyon's protection status from a U.S. National Monument to a National Park {{in order to}} establish Utah National Park. A process led by the Utah Parks Company for transferring ownership of private and state-held land in the monument <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> started in 1923. The last of the land in the proposed park's borders was sold <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> four years later, and on February 25, 1928, the renamed Bryce Canyon National Park was established.|$|E
5|$|Black was {{the author}} of the {{landmark}} decision in Gideon v. Wainwright (1963), which ruled that the states must provide an attorney to an indigent criminal defendant who cannot afford one.

5|$|He {{believed}} that the First Amendment erected a metaphorical wall of separation between church and state. During his career Black wrote several important opinions relating to church-state separation. He delivered {{the opinion of the}} court in Everson v.

5|$|U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt camped with John Muir near Glacier Point {{for three}} days in May 1903. During that trip, Muir {{convinced}} Roosevelt {{to take control of}} the valley and the grove away from California and give it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government.</b> On June 11, 1906, Roosevelt signed a bill that did precisely that, and the superintendent's headquarters was moved from Wawona to Yosemite Valley.|$|E
5|$|Although Madison's {{proposed}} amendments {{included a}} provision {{to extend the}} protection {{of some of the}} Bill of Rights to the states, the amendments that were finally submitted for ratification applied only <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government.</b> The door for their application upon state governments was opened in the 1860s, following ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment. Since the early 20th century both federal and state courts have used the Fourteenth Amendment to apply portions of the Bill of Rights to state and local governments. The process is known as incorporation.|$|E

5|$|Blackburn {{was also}} a zealous {{advocate}} for improved river navigation. He persuaded the legislature to apply a $100,000 allocation from the U.S. Congress to the improvement of navigation along the Kentucky River and gave concurrent jurisdiction over the Big Sandy and Licking Rivers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> {{so they could be}} improved as well. Legislators also approved construction of a canal around the Cumberland Falls and improvements along the Tradewater River.|$|E
5|$|Control of the District of Keewatin {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> {{under the}} management of the Department of the Interior in cooperation with the Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba. The council was not reconstituted until the remaining portions of the territory were once again merged with the Northwest Territories in 1905. The land formally comprising the territory is today governed by the provincial and territorial governments of Ontario, Manitoba and Nunavut.|$|E
5|$|If {{the federal}} {{property}} is an enclave, then {{the federal government}} has exclusive jurisdiction, unless the state reserved rights when it ceded the land <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government.</b> The Assimilative Crimes Act makes it a federal crime to violate a state law while at a federal enclave in that state. The Assimilative Crimes Act only applies to criminal laws (not regulatory laws), and is not applicable if the conduct is already regulated by federal law. Under federal law, military facilities are required to adopt state traffic laws, but the base commander is permitted to institute additional traffic laws.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, {{the federal}} {{government}} accounted for about 29% of the jobs in Washington, D.C. This is thought to immunize Washington to national economic downturns because {{the federal government}} continues operations even during recessions. Many organizations such as law firms, independent contractors (both defense and civilian), non-profit organizations, lobbying firms, trade unions, industry trade groups, and professional associations have their headquarters in or near D.C. to be close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government.</b>|$|E
5|$|In this role, Garran was {{responsible}} for organising the first federal election in March 1901, and for organising the transfer of various government departments from the states <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government,</b> including the Department of Defence, the postal and telegraphic services (now part of the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts) and the Department of Trade and Customs (now part of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade). As parliamentary drafter, Garran also developed legislation to administer those new departments and other important legislation.|$|E
5|$|Increased {{presence}} of white settlers in Indian Territory prompted the United States Government {{to establish the}} Dawes Act in 1887, which divided the lands of individual tribes into allotments for individual families, encouraging farming and private land ownership among Native Americans but expropriating land <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government.</b> In the process, railroad companies took nearly half of Indian-held land within the territory for outside settlers and for purchase.|$|E

5|$|Lesbians in the U.S. are {{estimated}} to be about 2.6% of the population, according to a National Opinion Research Center survey of sexually active adults who had had same-sex experiences within the past year, completed in 2000. A survey of same-sex couples in the United States showed that between 2000 and 2005, the number of people claiming to be in same-sex relationships increased by 30%—five times the rate of population growth in the U.S. The study attributed the jump to people being more comfortable self-identifying as homosexual <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government.</b>|$|E
5|$|Men {{who worked}} for farmers or {{psychiatric}} hospitals received regular wages, which {{they were required to}} give <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government.</b> Objections to this practice developed immediately because the men felt they were helping to fund the war. A compromise was reached where the wages were put into a special fund that was unused until {{after the end of the}} war. At one point, church representatives attempted unsuccessfully to have these funds used for providing a living allowance for the men's dependents.|$|E
5|$|Most {{work had}} been {{completed}} by the dedication, and Six Companies negotiated with the government through late 1935, and early 1936, to settle all claims and arrange for the formal transfer of the dam <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Government.</b> The parties came to an agreement and on March 1, 1936, Secretary Ickes formally accepted the dam {{on behalf of the}} government. Six Companies was not required to complete work on one item, a concrete plug for one of the bypass tunnels, as the tunnel had to be used to take in irrigation water until the powerhouse went into operation.|$|E

This specific project was not approved although the state continued its own efforts to convert the highway, including various segments opened in the 1970s and 1980s.
