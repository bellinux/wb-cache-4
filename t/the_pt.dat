5|$|<b>The</b> <b>PT</b> boat {{force at}} Morotai {{was reduced to}} a single {{squadron}} by February 1945 but remained active {{until the end of the}} war. As well as patrolling around Morotai, the boats operated in the eastern NEI to raid Japanese positions and support Australian and Dutch scouting parties. In May 1945 PT boats and the Australian Z Special Unit rescued the Sultan of Ternate along with his court and harem during an operation codenamed Project Opossum after he was mistreated by the Japanese. By the end of the war <b>the</b> <b>PT</b> boats had conducted nearly 1,300 patrols and destroyed 50 barges and 150 small craft off Morotai and Halmahera.|$|E
5|$|As {{agreements}} between the PNR and PȚ broke down (with the PNR awaiting for new developments), <b>the</b> <b>PȚ</b> joined Iorga's party, the Democratic Nationalists, {{in creating the}} Federation of National-Social Democracy (which also drew support from the group around Nicolae L. Lupu).|$|E
5|$|An {{attempt to}} obtain {{information}} for Operation Dexterity, the attack on New Britain, with a joint Army-Navy reconnaissance team raised issues of inter-service cooperation. The Navy was mainly interested in gathering hydrographic data rather than information {{on the state of}} the Japanese defenders. Because of a breakdown in communications, <b>the</b> <b>PT</b> boat that was supposed to collect the team was unable to rendezvous with it, and the team had to spend eleven more days on the island. Finally, the Navy tried to prevent the Army commander from briefing Alamo Force headquarters on what had occurred.|$|E
30|$|One {{instructional}} practice <b>the</b> <b>PTs</b> {{claimed was}} <b>the</b> {{most effective and}} beneficial with their students was ‘math talk.’ Prior to working with their students, <b>the</b> <b>PTs</b> read an article by Fuson et al. [23] that focused on math talk, which is when “the teacher and students use discourse to support the mathematical learning of all participants” [26], p. 82). <b>The</b> <b>PTs</b> implemented this strategy with their students, and witnessed huge rewards. They found during math talk they could determine students’ mathematical understandings and misunderstandings. <b>The</b> <b>PTs</b> also used math talk to help them differentiate their instruction when they worked with students who were on different levels. <b>The</b> <b>PTs</b> stated math talk provided insight on how their students were {{making sense of the}} mathematics, and they used it as a valuable resource for their students to learn from their peers.|$|R
30|$|In addition, <b>the</b> <b>PTs</b> {{completed}} reflective essays {{at the end}} of {{the service}} learning course. The essays addressed how <b>the</b> <b>PTs</b> had grown based on their experiences; how they applied their learning to their work with their students; and how they can use the ideas in their future classrooms.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>PTs</b> {{expressed}} <b>the</b> {{importance of}} going through the lesson prior to teaching it to students. <b>The</b> <b>PTs</b> stated that going through the lesson helped {{to make sure the}} correct mathematical language was used in the explanations and it provided further understanding of how the activity that was planned was going to be implemented.|$|R
5|$|Narayan {{argued that}} {{appreciation}} of the sarangi and him came only after acknowledgment by the Western audience. He attributed the lack of sarangi students {{to a lack of}} competent teachers and said that the Indian government should assist in preserving the instrument. <b>The</b> <b>Pt</b> (Pandit) Ram Narayan Foundation in Mumbai awards scholarships to sarangi students. Narayan has stated he was skeptical the sarangi would survive and said he would never give up promoting the instrument.|$|E
5|$|The {{commander}} of <b>the</b> <b>PT</b> boat {{force in the}} Southwest Pacific, Commander Morton C. Mumma, opposed building extensive PT boat facilities at Arawe as he had sufficient bases and Japanese barges normally sailed along the north coast of New Britain. Mumma took his concerns to Carpender and Barbey, who eventually agreed {{that he would not}} be required to establish a base there if he thought it unnecessary. Instead, he assigned six boats stationed at Dreger Harbor in New Guinea and Kiriwina Island to operate along the south coast of New Britain east of Arawe each night, and asked only for emergency refuelling facilities at Arawe.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{activities}} {{were taken in}} hand by the US Navy Seabees of the 18th Construction Regiment, which consisted of the 27th, 61st and 63rd Construction Battalions and the 17th Special Battalion, which arrived between 25 and 30 March, and the 77th Construction Battalion which arrived on 14 April. The 27th built a PT boat base, an LCT floating drydock and slipway, and roads. The 61st constructed housing, ammunition storage facilities, a runway, {{and some of the}} buildings at <b>the</b> <b>PT</b> boat base. It also handled sawmill operations. The 63rd assisted at the sawmill and worked on the roads, camps, harbor facilities, warehouses, magazines and avgas dumps. The 77th built taxiways, hardstands, aviation workshops and the avgas tank farm. The 88th worked on runways, roads, radar stations and a causeway at the eastern end of the island.|$|E
30|$|There were 25 <b>PTs</b> {{who took}} <b>the</b> methods course. This {{is the first}} but also the last course for PTs to learn to teach {{mathematics}} before they leave for elementary school jobs. Among these PTs, 24 PTs were female (96  %) and one was a male (4.0  %). All of <b>the</b> <b>PTs</b> were Caucasian. At {{the beginning of this}} course, <b>the</b> <b>PTs</b> were presented with an approved consent form and encouraged to participate in this study by providing permission for the instructor to use their coursework. It was also made clear that PTs’ choices of participation would make no impact on their course grades. Supportively, all <b>the</b> <b>PTs</b> provided permission.|$|R
30|$|From this experience, <b>the</b> <b>PTs</b> {{realized}} {{they did not}} know all the content they needed to know to teach. <b>The</b> <b>PTs</b> stated this forced them to expand their knowledge in geometry and pushed them to be a better teacher. Eric stated that this experience caused him to swallow his “pride” and ask others in the room for help. Eventually, he saw this as a good learning experience because he can now solve the geometry problems. <b>The</b> <b>PTs</b> discussed that in order to effectively teach mathematical content, one must understand it. Additionally, finding the gaps in their own content knowledge helped them “become a better teacher” (Ruth’s Reflective Essay, 2012).|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, in this {{qualitative}} study, {{we examined}} how a service learning course prepares prospective mathematics teachers {{to teach students}} who struggle in mathematics. The service learning course {{examined in this study}} is the See Blue Mathematics Clinic, a course designed by instructors at a large public university in the southeast region of the United States. The course establishes its roots in service learning based on the symbiotic relationship between <b>the</b> <b>PTs</b> and middle and high school students. For example, <b>the</b> <b>PTs</b> provide free tutoring for students to help them improve their mathematical skills, while the students provide real-world teaching experience for <b>the</b> <b>PTs</b> to practice their techniques and differentiation strategies.|$|R
5|$|Initial Allied {{goals for}} the landing at Arawe {{included}} securing a base for American PT boats and diverting Japanese forces away from Cape Gloucester. <b>The</b> <b>PT</b> boat base was subsequently deemed unnecessary and was never built. Only a small Japanese force was stationed at Arawe at the time, although reinforcements were en route. The main Allied landing on 15December was successful, despite a failed subsidiary landing and problems coordinating the landing craft. American forces quickly secured a beachhead and dug in. Japanese air units made large-scale raids against the Arawe area {{in the days after}} the landing, and in late December Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) troops unsuccessfully counterattacked the American force. In mid-January 1944 the American force, reinforced with additional infantry and tanks, launched a brief offensive that pushed the Japanese back. The Japanese units at Arawe withdrew from the area towards the end of February as part of a general retreat from western New Britain.|$|E

25|$|From 2002 until 2007, <b>the</b> <b>PT</b> Cruiser {{was used}} in the city of Urayasu, Chiba Prefecture by the Maihama Resort Cab company to serve as a taxi in the {{vicinity}} of Tokyo Disneyland because of its fun, retro appearance. <b>The</b> <b>PT</b> Cruiser taxis augmented the Maihama Resort Line service to Tokyo Disneyland. Unfortunately, <b>the</b> <b>PT</b> Cruiser wasn't built for the rigors of taxi service, and the fleet became expensive to maintain, with eventual retirement in 2007. <b>The</b> <b>PT</b> Cruiser was offered in Japan until April 2010, when it was replaced by the Dodge Caliber.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>PTs</b> {{commented that}} they were now more {{confident}} working with students who struggle in mathematics. Typically, they were comfortable working with more advanced students where the mathematics connections were {{easier for them to}} make. But, after this class, many of <b>the</b> <b>PTs</b> confirmed they “feel more confident to effectively work with struggling learners, particularly ones who are incredibly behind in their studies” (Michelle’s Reflective Essay, 2012). <b>The</b> <b>PTs</b> reflected that prior to taking the course, they thought they would not be successful helping a student who struggled, but the class provided them with specific strategies to try with their students to make them successful. In fact, some of <b>the</b> <b>PTs</b> stated they were really nervous when they started the course, {{but at the end of}} the semester they were confident in their teaching abilities. “I have walked into this clinic with no experience what-so-ever, but I will be walking out with a wide variety of experience and useful knowledge from myself and my peers” (Gwyn’s Reflective Essay, 2011). Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>PTs</b> expressed that <b>the</b> class provided them with “valuable insight into the mind of a struggling learner in mathematics, and made me not only a better tutor, but also a better teacher” (Andrea’s Reflective Essay, 2014).|$|R
