They have fun joking about the fortunes, and Pearl admits she is a little sad hers did not come true. Pearl goes to a coffee house and cries when the fortune's deadline passes without anyone talking to her. Friday morning, Pearl is leaving for work when she meets a man who is about <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> her door. He says he works at the coffee house she visited, and that she left her wallet behind. After a conversation, Pearl and the man arrange a date.|$|E

Blackpool's reserve team, however, won the Central League championship, scoring 82 {{goals in the}} process. They were assisted significantly by Jackie Mudie, who was just beginning <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> {{the door of the}} first team.

25|$|Mid November, 2007 Operation: Live Free or Die, An {{effort to}} bring volunteers to {{campaign}} door to door in New Hampshire was started by Google employee Vijay Boyapati. His idea to rent a few houses to hold volunteers turned into 14 houses with over 600 people arriving in New Hampshire <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> doors, organize marches, phone bank at the Concord and Nashua Headquarters. Paul visited OLFD volunteers at a local restaurant owned {{by a member of}} the Free State Project called Murphy's Pub, a frequent establishment for FSP members, to thank them in person for their dedication.|$|E

Many {{of the same}} people returned from the previous evening—hustlers, street youths, and [...] "queens"—but they were joined by [...] "police provocateurs", curious bystanders, and even tourists. Remarkable to many was the sudden exhibition of homosexual affection in public, as described by one witness: [...] "From going to places where you had <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> a door and speak to someone through a peephole in order to get in. We were just out. We were in the streets." ...|$|E
500|$|Patrick Murphy, {{chief of}} police for the Berwyn Heights Police Department, was {{especially}} critical of the county police. [...] Murphy argued that the raid {{could have been prevented}} if his department had handled the situation, stating [...] "you can't tell me the {{chief of police}} of a municipality wouldn't have been able <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> the door of the mayor of that municipality, gain his confidence and enter the residence". [...] Furthermore, according to Mayor Calvo, a memorandum of understanding between the county and the city requires county police to inform the city if an operation is being conducted within their jurisdiction.|$|E

He and Lavigne's mother, Judy, {{recognized}} their child's vocal abilities when she was two years old and sang [...] "Jesus Loves Me" [...] {{on the way home from}} church.

[...] Meanwhile, Kent {{was still trying to}} clear his name, and on 25February he went to the vault of St John's, accompanied by Aldrich, the undertaker, the clerk and the parish sexton. [...] The group was there to prove beyond any doubt that a recent newspaper report, which claimed that the supposed removal of Fanny's body from the vault accounted for the ghost's failure <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> her coffin, was false.

500|$|Bannon set {{her stories}} in and among gay bars in the 1950s and 1960s that were secret. As {{described}} in Beebo Brinker, one had <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> {{the door and}} be recognized before being let in. In reality, women {{were not allowed to}} wear pants in some bars in New York City. Police raided bars and arrested everyone within regularly; a raid on a gay bar prompted the seminal Stonewall riots in 1969 that started the gay rights movement. Because of the atmosphere of secrecy and shame, little was recorded at the time {{about what it was like}} to be gay then, and Bannon unwittingly recorded history from her own visits to Greenwich Village. In 2007, one of the writers who adapted three of the books into a play said of Bannon's work, [...] "I think she rises above the pulp. She wasn't trying to write trash. There wasn't any place for a woman to be writing this kind of material... But I just think the writing's transcended its time and its era and its market." ...|$|E
500|$|Joe Nick Patoski, {{an author}} and {{contributor}} to The New York Times, felt that [...] "Fotos y Recuerdos" [...] used the same melody as the Pretenders' new wave sound. He also noticed that Pérez's guitar-lead emulated {{the style of the}} Pretenders James Honeyman-Scott. John LaFollette of The Monitor called [...] "Fotos y Recuerdos" [...] a celebration of multiculturalism which helped [...] " [...] her bank account" [...] using a [...] "marketing strategy" [...] that he called [...] "as American as apple pie." [...] The rock and house music track features a synth-driven violin, ostinatish-percussion, and a steel drum under a cumbia beat. Perone found the song to have [...] "small hints" [...] of music found in Jamaica, Cuba, and Trinidad and Tobago. Patoski believed [...] "Techno Cumbia" [...] contained the [...] "most popular rhythm [...] coursing through the Latin music world." [...] Patoski noted that the track [...] "honored" [...] it by [...] "updating it with vocal samples, second line drumming from New Orleans, and horn charts inspired by soca from the Caribbean." [...] It included the singer rapping under a cumbia beat, the [...] "first successful example" [...] of a cumbia rap prototype. [...] "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom", which also draws on music from the Caribbean, uses [...] "richer" [...] scoring, less-driven synthesizers, and treble-heavy arrangements than the first four songs on Amor Prohibido. Infused with cumbia and reggae, its [...] title suggests the sound of a heart palpitating when a person longs to be the protagonist's object of affection. [...] "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom" [...] is musically similar to [...] "El Chico del Apartamento 512"; Perone called them recurring themes where the protagonist is [...] "attracted to a young man". The song's hook is more accessible to listeners with limited Spanish than that of [...] "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom". The [...] "sunny teen anthem" [...] track [...] "El Chico del Apartamento 512", the protagonist is hit on by several men whom she has no interest in, except for the song's [...] "boy in apartment 512". She finds enough courage <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> his door to find it answered by a woman who asks if she is searching for her brother. Perone found its lyrics to be [...] "lighthearted" [...] and a relief from the tracks featuring heartbreak and despair.|$|E

Now I understand them complately, for ain't we rabbits ourselves? The officers, saving your presence, are the ferrits who turn us out of our holes on duty; and the niggers yonder, with their muskets and their matchlocks, are the men with sticks, ready <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> us <b>on</b> head, directly we show ourselves.

His painting languished: [...] "it's {{hard for me to}} decide what I want to paint. I go for months without finding it sometimes. It comes slowly."
