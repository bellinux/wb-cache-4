5|$|Boron is {{necessary}} for plant growth, but an excess of boron is toxic <b>to</b> <b>plants,</b> and occurs particularly in acidic soil.

5|$|Microbes {{can make}} {{nutrients}} and minerals {{in the soil}} available <b>to</b> <b>plants,</b> produce hormones that spur growth, stimulate the plant immune system and trigger or dampen stress responses.

5|$|A {{teaspoon}} of seawater contains about 50 million viruses. Most {{of these are}} bacteriophages, which are harmless <b>to</b> <b>plants</b> and animals, and are in fact essential to the regulation of marine and freshwater ecosystems; however, they are also important mortality agents of phytoplankton, {{the base of the}} foodchain in aquatic environments. They infect and destroy bacteria in aquatic microbial communities, and {{are one of the most}} important mechanisms of recycling carbon and nutrient cycling in marine environments. The organic molecules released from the dead bacterial cells stimulate fresh bacterial and algal growth, in a process known as the viral shunt. Viral activity may also affect the biological pump, the process whereby carbon is sequestered in the deep ocean.|$|E
5|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a soil {{rhizosphere}} bacterium, can {{attach to}} plant cells and infect {{them with a}} callus-inducing Ti plasmid by horizontal gene transfer, causing a callus infection called crown gall disease.

Today, genetic modification of the Ti plasmid {{is one of the}} main techniques for introduction of transgenes <b>to</b> <b>plants</b> and the creation of genetically modified crops.|$|E

These current phylogenetic analyses often overturn classifications based on older and sometimes less discriminative methods based on morphological features and biological species concepts obtained from experimental matings.|$|E

5|$|In 2015, {{researchers}} at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston found that plants {{can be a}} vector for prions. When researchers fed hamsters grass that grew on ground where a deer that died with chronic wasting disease (CWD) was buried, the hamsters became ill with CWD, suggesting that prions can bind <b>to</b> <b>plants,</b> which then take them up into the leaf and stem structure, {{where they can be}} eaten by herbivores, thus completing the cycle. It is thus possible that there is a progressively accumulating number of prions in the environment.|$|E
5|$|Some {{types of}} organochlorides, though not all, have {{significant}} toxicity <b>to</b> <b>plants</b> or animals, including humans. Dioxins, produced when organic matter is {{burned in the}} presence of chlorine, and some insecticides, such as DDT, are persistent organic pollutants which pose dangers when they are released into the environment. For example, DDT, which was widely used to control insects in the mid 20th century, also accumulates in food chains, and causes reproductive problems (e.g., eggshell thinning) in certain bird species. Due to the ready homolytic fission of the Câ€“Cl bond to create chlorine radicals in the upper atmosphere, chlorofluorocarbons have been phased out due to the harm they do to the ozone layer.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a model-based approach for competitive analysis of manufacturing {{plants in the}} U. S. food processing industry. As part of this approach, plant competitiveness is measured using Operational Competitiveness Ratings Analysis (OCRA) [...] a new non-parametric method of computing relative inefficiency. Drivers of competitiveness are identified in terms of policies related <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> structure and infrastructure. Policies related <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> structure are those decisions that are related with "bricks and mortar" and have long term implications, such as decisions related <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> size and capacity. Policies related <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> infrastructure are decisions related to how the " bricks and mortar" are used. These policies are typically under the direct control of the operations managers and have a short-term orientation, such as decisions related to equipment, quality, inventory, workforce and confusion-engendering activities (e. g. new product introductions and product variety). The empirical analysis is based on detailed cross-sectional data on 20 processed food manufacturing <b>plants.</b> With respect <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> structure, {{the results suggest that}} small sized food processing plants are competitive, and both capacity underutilization and overutilization are detrimental <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> competitiveness. Among the significant results with respect <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> infrastructure, equipment maintenance, quality management programs, packaging supplies inventory, workforce training and product variety are positively associated with plant competitiveness. The results also suggest that introduction of new products disrupts plant operations, {{at least in the short}} run, and is negatively associated with plant competitiveness. ...|$|R

Soybean response <b>to</b> <b>planting</b> date {{is important not}} only in years when planting is delayed by inclement weather, but also when weather does not disrupt the normal planting season. When planting is delayed, and in doublecrop situations, correct crop and variety planting decisions are necessary to obtain maximum yields.

When planting is not delayed by weather, the response of various crops <b>to</b> <b>planting</b> date is useful information for deciding which crop <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> first...|$|R

5|$|The {{major source}} of nickel {{exposure}} is oral consumption, as nickel is essential <b>to</b> <b>plants.</b> Nickel is found naturally in both food and water, and may be increased by human pollution. For example, nickel-plated faucets may contaminate water and soil; mining and smelting may dump nickel into waste-water; nickelâ€“steel alloy cookware and nickel-pigmented dishes may release nickel into food. The atmosphere may be polluted by nickel ore refining and fossil fuel combustion. Humans may absorb nickel directly from tobacco smoke and skin contact with jewelry, shampoos, detergents, and coins. A less-common form of chronic exposure is through hemodialysis as traces of nickel ions may be absorbed into the plasma from the chelating action of albumin.|$|E

5|$|Aristotle {{stated in}} the History of Animals that all beings were {{arranged}} in a fixed scale of perfection, reflected in their form (eidos). They stretched from minerals <b>to</b> <b>plants</b> and animals, and on up to man, forming the scala naturae or great chain of being. His system had eleven grades, arranged according to the potentiality of each being, expressed in their form at birth. The highest animals gave birth to warm and wet creatures alive, the lowest bore theirs cold, dry, and in thick eggs. The system was based on Aristotle's interpretation of the four elements in his On Generation and Corruption: Fire (hot and dry); Air (hot and wet); Water (cold and wet); and Earth (cold and dry). These are arranged from the most energetic to the least, so the warm, wet young raised in a womb with a placenta were higher on the scale than the cold, dry, nearly mineral eggs of birds. However, Aristotle is careful never to insist that a group fits perfectly in the scale; he knows animals have many combinations of attributes, and that placements are approximate.|$|E
