Nor does anyone seriously question that the Constitution protects the right of hunters to own and keep sporting guns for hunting game any more than anyone would challenge the right to own and keep fishing rods and other equipment for fishingor to own automobiles. To 'keep and bear arms' for hunting today is essentially a recreational activity and not an imperative of survival, as it was 200 years ago.

The emergent picture from the study is one of deficient CSR penetration and wide variation among countries where most of the assessed countries are still lagging in the endorsement of international CSR initiatives and schemes. Findings offer fertile ground to theorists and researchers for a deeper investigation of the national specificity of CSR and to further identify institutional determinants that shape the social responsiveness and self-regulation of business entities. The study has also implications for managers and top executives to consider as it infers that <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>background</b> can be influential {{in the development of a}} CSR agenda and can condition the level of CSR penetration...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{associations}} of metabolic syndrome (MetS) or diabetes mellitus (DM) on long-term survival after {{coronary artery bypass}} grafting (CABG) have not been extensively evaluated. The aim {{of the present study}} was to assess the impact of MetS and DM on the 16 -year survival after CABG. Methods: Diabetic and metabolic status together with relevant cardiovascular data was established in 910 CABG patients operated in 1993 - 94. They were divided in three groups as follows: neither DM nor MetS (375 patients), MetS alone (279 patients) and DM with or without MetS (256 patients). The 16 -year follow-up of patient survival was carried out using national health databases. The relative survival rates were analyzed using the Life Table method comparing the observed survival rates of three patient groups to the rates based on age-, sex- and time-specific life tables for the whole population in Finland. To study the independent significance of MetS and DM for clinical outcome, multivariate analysis was made using an optimizing stepwise procedure based on the Bayesian approach. Results: Bayesian multivariate analysis revealed together six variables to predict clinical outcome (2 months to 16 years) in relation to <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>background</b> population, i. e. age, diabetes, left ventricular ejection fraction, BMI, perfusion time during the CABG and peripheral arterial disease.

The huge changes in the social tissue of those societies, which up to now had an established dominant culture and religious affiliation, made them now face more than the effects of migrant flows, which inevitably causes confrontations of cultures and believes. The clash of civilizations, which have been so accurately predicted, took different forms of confrontation by giving floor to extremism into its organized form: an explosion of terrorism. By considering the strong connections between poverty and lack of education as an extremism cradle, many researchers consider {{the inclusion of the}} subjects related to the history and culture of religions as a strategy to reduce cultural and religious conflict as well as extremist behavior and the bases of terrorism, by increasing information and knowledge about religion starting from early teen years.

40|$|Background: Chronic {{inflammatory}} bowel disease (IBD) negatively {{affects the}} patient’s health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Only a few population-based studies have compared the HRQoL of patients with the background population. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the HRQoL in a European cohort of patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease 10 years after diagnosis (European Collaborative study group of Inflammatory Bowel Disease) compared with <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>background</b> population in each country and to assess possible country-specific differences. Methods: Patients with IBD from 7 European countries were invited to a follow-up visit 10 years after their diagnosis of IBD. We assessed their clinical and demographic data, including the generic HRQoL questionnaire short form health survey- 36. Countrywise comparison with the background population was performed with z-scores using the Cohen’s effect size index. Results: Seven hundred sixty-nine patients were eligible for the study. We registered statistically significant and clinically relevant decreases in the short form health survey- 36 dimensional scores in patients with symptoms at the time of follow-up and for patients reporting sick leave during the previous year or having received disablement pension. In the Netherlands and Norway, there was a moderate difference between the patients with IBD and the background population for the general health dimension. Conclusions: Overall, the HRQoL was not reduced in the IBD cohort compared with the background populations. However, in addition to older age and female gender, current symptoms at follow-up, disablement pension, and sick leave during the previous year were significantly associated with a reduced HRQoL in patients with IBD.

Foreword Technology readiness assessment (TRA) is a kind of new tool which pushing utmost and stating using in the scientific management of national background projects. A TRA examines program concepts, technology requirements, and demonstrated technology capabilities in order to determine technological maturity. A TRA can be very useful for describing the status of a technology project, such as a senior design project, master thesis project or a sponsored research project.

40|$|This article explores {{whether the}} {{attitude}} of preparers towards lobbying to a private accounting standard setter is different depending on the regulatory background of the preparers’ home country. Prior literature examined the preparers’ incentives and preparers’ characteristics as drivers {{to participate in the}} due process of international accounting standard setting, but it did not investigate the impact of <b>the</b> preparers’ <b>national</b> regulatory <b>background</b> on participation. As a result of the acceptance of the International Financial Reporting Standards promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) in different countries, preparers who are traditionally accustomed with an accounting standard setting process initiated by governments with few opportunities for formal participation, are now able to participate in a private accounting standard setting process characterized by several possibilities for participation. Comparing survey evidence of Belgian preparers with existing survey evidence of UK preparers, we notice that the participation methods used, the perception on the effectiveness of the participation methods and the reasons for non-participation differ across both groups of preparers. This finding suggests that <b>the</b> <b>national</b> regulatory <b>background</b> of <b>the</b> preparers may affect the behaviour of preparers in their decision to participate in private accounting standard setting. status: publishe...|$|R
