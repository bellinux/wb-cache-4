5|$|McGinnity {{finished}} his MLB career with 246 career wins, seven 20-win seasons, and two 30-win seasons. He had nearly 500 professional wins including {{his years in}} the minor leagues. McGinnity set a career record in batters hit by pitch with 152. He revolutionized the fielding of the pitching position, by attempting to make force outs at any base, instead of only <b>throwing</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> to first base.|$|E
5|$|Alston went undrafted in the 2003 NFL Draft. He {{was signed}} by the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League in May 2003. Alston {{did not make the}} Browns' regular season roster, but he was {{allocated}} to the Berlin Thunder of NFL Europe. While with the Thunder in 2004, Alston threw a touchdown pass to wide receiver Chas Gessner in World Bowl XII. The trick play, which had Alston line up as a receiver before <b>throwing</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> helped the Thunder defeat the Frankfurt Galaxy 30–24 to become World Bowl champions.|$|E
5|$|For the 2001–02 season, McGrady {{averaged}} 25.6 points, 7.9 rebounds, and 5.3 assists per game, {{earning his}} second All-NBA Team selection, {{this time to}} the All-NBA First Team. During that year's All-Star Game, he completed {{one of the most}} memorable highlights of his career, <b>throwing</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> off the backboard to himself and completing an alley-oop in traffic. At season's end, the Magic were again ousted in the first round of the playoffs, losing in four games to the Charlotte Hornets.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1950s, the Manchester City manager Les McDowall {{introduced}} a new tactical system using a deep-lying centre-forward, which {{became known as the}} Revie Plan after Don Revie who played centre-forward. The system depended on maintaining possession of the ball wherever possible, which required Trautmann to make use of his throwing ability. For goalkeepers of Trautmann's era, it was usual to kick the ball as far as possible downfield after making a save. By contrast, Trautmann, influenced by the Hungarian goalkeeper Gyula Grosics, sought to start attacks by <b>throwing</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> to a wing-half, typically Ken Barnes or John McTavish. The wing-half then passed to Revie to develop the attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{birth of}} {{football}} at the Naval Academy is debated among historians. The most accepted occurrence was in 1869, when a midshipman (a student) {{returned from his}} leave with a football. While <b>throwing</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> with a friend, it was dropped {{and a group of}} fellow midshipmen attempted to take it. A contest was eventually organized, which ended abruptly when the ball was kicked into the Severn River. However, biographer C. Douglas Kroll stated that the first evidence of a form of football at the United States Naval Academy came in 1857, but the school's cadets lost interest in the game shortly afterward, a theory supported by journalist Jack Clary. Regardless, the sport had been banned for several years prior to 1879.|$|E
5|$|Barton {{returned}} to QPR for the 2013–14 Football League Championship season. During a match at Burnley in October, a plastic bottle thrown {{from the stands}} hit Barton on the head. He was sent off in QPR's 1–0 home defeat to Leicester City on 21 December 2013, receiving two yellow cards in quick succession for fouling and then <b>throwing</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> in dissent at Gary Taylor-Fletcher. On 21 February 2015, Barton received the ninth red card {{of his career in}} the 32nd minute of a match against Hull City after swinging at Tom Huddlestone's groin following a foul by Darnell Furlong. Chris Ramsey suggested that Barton, who would miss the club's next three home matches as a result, would return to anger management therapy following the incident. In May 2015, Queens Park Rangers announced the release of Barton in the summer of 2015.|$|E

5|$|In an oddity, Greinke {{became the}} first pitcher to start three {{straight}} games in the Majors in 95 years. On July 7, he was ejected from the game after just 4 pitches for angrily <b>throwing</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> into the ground following a close play at first base. The following day, Greinke started again, but lasted only until the third inning. The All-Star break followed, and Greinke was the Brewers' starter on July 13, the team's next game. Greinke's third start ended after 5 innings. Before this, the most recent pitcher to start three consecutive games was Red Faber in the 1917, who started both games of a September 3 doubleheader, throwing just six innings in total, followed by a complete game win the following day. Overall, Grienke finished the 2011 year with a 16-6 record, a 3.83 ERA, and 201 strikeouts in 28 starts.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1938 season, the Victorian Football Association (VFA), the second-tier senior {{football}} {{competition in}} the state, made an ambitious break from tradition in what was ultimately a successful ploy to improve its popularity: it legalised <b>throwing</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> in general play and made a few other rule changes to create a distinct and faster variation of Australian rules football, and ended the legal framework which required players to obtain a clearance when switching from the VFL to the VFA (or vice versa). On March 31, Nash caused a sensation when {{he became the first}} VFL player to defect under this schism, transferring from South Melbourne to Camberwell without a clearance. Nash was already one of the highest paid players in the VFL, but accepted an offer of £8/week to captain-coach the Camberwell Football Club, £3/week to captain-coach the sub-district Camberwell Cricket Club and a job as a Camberwell Council official.|$|E
5|$|The Browns {{had three}} quarterbacks on their roster {{entering}} the 1970 season in Gault, Bill Nelsen, and Mike Phipps. As training camp began, Browns coach Blanton Collier {{planned to use}} Gault in exhibition games, as he was <b>throwing</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> well in practice during the summer. By the end of preseason, Gault {{was named to the}} active roster as the Browns retained all three quarterbacks, an uncommon move at the time. During the Browns' second game against the San Francisco 49ers, starting quarterback Nelsen was injured, leading Gault to enter the game in the fourth quarter. He completed a pass to Gary Collins for 23 yards, threw an incompletion, and threw an interception to Dave Wilcox, allowing the 49ers to go on a game-winning drive in a 34-31 Browns loss.|$|E
50|$|During play in futsal, if the attacking team sends <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> over <b>the</b> goal line, the goalkeeper restarts <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> {{through a}} goal clearance, where they <b>throw</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> to another player {{outside of the}} penalty area. When either team sends <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> over <b>the</b> touch line in futsal, the other team kicks rather than <b>throws</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> back into play in {{what is known as}} a kick-in.|$|R
50|$|On passing plays, the {{offensive}} line is responsible for stopping defensive players from tackling the quarterback before he has <b>thrown</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> Stopping these players indefinitely is usually not possible, so the main objective of {{the offensive}} line is to slow them down, providing the quarterback with several seconds to identify an open receiver and <b>throw</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b>|$|R

5|$|Two running plays gained 11 {{yards and}} a first down, then Tennessee quarterback Jonathan Crompton began <b>throwing</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> His first pass the game fell incomplete, and his second was intercepted by Virginia Tech defender Rashad Carmichael, who ran {{it back to the}} Tennessee 44-yard line. Tech's second drive of the game thus began in Tennessee's {{defensive}} half. The first play of the drive was a 20-yard throw from Taylor to wide receiver Jarrett Boykin. That completed pass was the longest play of the drive, which continued through short rushes and passes. On the seventh play after the interception, Williams ran the ball forward one yard, crossing the goal line for the game's first touchdown. Tech placekicker Matt Waldron successfully converted the extra point, and with 6:56 remaining in the first quarter, Tech led 7-0.|$|E
5|$|In the 1961–62 NBA season, {{the aging}} Cousy {{slowly began to}} fade statistically, {{averaging}} 15.7 points, 3.5 rebounds and 7.8 assists, and was voted into the All-NBA Second Team after ten consecutive First Team nominations. Still, he enjoyed a satisfying postseason, winning the 1962 NBA Finals after 4–3 battles against two upcoming teams, the Philadelphia Warriors and Los Angeles Lakers. The Finals series against the Lakers was especially dramatic, because Lakers guard Frank Selvy failed to make a last-second buzzer beater in Game 7 which would have won the title. Finally, in the 1962–63 NBA season, {{the last of his}} career, Cousy averaged 13.2 points, 2.5 rebounds and 6.8 assists, and collected one last All-Star and All-NBA Second Team nomination. In the 1963 NBA Finals, the Celtics again won 4–2 against the Lakers, and Cousy finished his career on a high note: {{in the fourth quarter of}} Game 6, Cousy sprained an ankle and had to be helped to the bench. He went back in with Boston up 1. Although he did not score again, his was credited with providing an emotional lift that carried the Celtics to victory, 112–109. The game ended with Cousy <b>throwing</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> into the rafters.|$|E
5|$|The Florida State touchback allowed Vick {{to start}} at his 20-yard line for Virginia Tech's second {{possession}} of the game. The possession began {{no better than the}} first one, as Virginia Tech committed a 10-yard holding penalty on the first play. On subsequent plays, however, the Hokie offense began to move the ball with success. Vick completed a 12-yard pass to wide receiver Eddie Royal, and the offense was aided by a 15-yard Florida State penalty, which gave the Hokies an automatic first down. Following the first down, Vick completed the first big Virginia Tech play of the game, <b>throwing</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> 35yards downfield to Justin Harper, who caught it in Florida State territory. Two more plays pushed Virginia Tech {{to the edge of the}} Florida State red zone, but a penalty and another sack prevented the Hokies from advancing the ball further. Virginia Tech was forced to send in kicker Brandon Pace to attempt a 45-yard field goal. The kick was good, and Virginia Tech had tied the game 33 with 1:00 remaining in the quarter.|$|E

25|$|A {{line-out}} {{consists of}} at least two players from each team standing in a two straight lines between five and fifteen metres from, and at right angles to, the scoring bay. The gap between the two teams must be 1 metre and the opposing team cannot have more players in the line-out than the team that was last in 'fluid possession'. One player from each team has to stand two metres back from the line-out to receive the ball and the opposing team must have a player standing {{at the front of the}} line-out two metres from the centre of the line-out. The player <b>throwing</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> stands outside the field of play and must throw it at least five metres down the centre of the line-out. If the throw in is incorrect the opposing team has the choice of taking a scrum fifteen metres from the sideline or <b>throwing</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> in themselves. The player <b>throwing</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> in must not delay or pretend to throw the ball in. Players not taking part in the line-out must stand back ten metres or on the goal line if that is closer.|$|E
25|$|An {{indirect}} free kick is also {{awarded to}} the opposing team if a player plays in a dangerous manner, deliberately obstructs an opponent, prevents the goalkeeper from <b>throwing</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> with hands or anything else for which play is stopped to caution or dismiss a player.
