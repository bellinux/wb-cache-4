5|$|I'll {{say that}} the Ukrainian people <b>treated</b> <b>me</b> well. I recall warmly the years I spent there. This was a period full of responsibilities, but {{pleasant}} because it brought satisfaction... But far be it from me to inflate my significance. The entire Ukrainian people was exerting great efforts... I attribute Ukraine's successes to the Ukrainian people as a whole. I won't elaborate further on this theme, but in principle it's very easy to demonstrate. I'm Russian myself, and I don't want to offend the Russians.|$|E

25|$|She chose {{a spiritual}} director, a Jesuit, Father Pichon. At their first meeting, 28 May 1888, {{she made a}} general {{confession}} going back over all her past sins. She came away from it profoundly relieved. The priest who had himself suffered from scruples, understood her and reassured her. A few months later, he left for Canada, and Thérèse would {{only be able to}} ask his advice by letter and his replies were rare. (On 4 July 1897, she confided to Pauline, 'Father Pichon <b>treated</b> <b>me</b> too much like a child; nonetheless he did me a lot of good too by saying that I never committed a mortal sin.') During her time as a postulant, Thérèse had to endure some bullying from other sisters because of her lack of aptitude for handicrafts and manual work. Sister St Vincent de Paul, the finest embroiderer in the community made her feel awkward and even called her 'the big nanny goat'. Thérèse was in fact the tallest in the family, 1.62 metres (approx. 5'3"). Pauline, the shortest, was no more than 1.54m tall (approx.5').|$|E

[...] Al Jackson, a black pitcher with the Mets under Stengel, concurred, [...] "He never <b>treated</b> <b>me</b> with anything but respect." [...] According to Bill Bishop {{in his account}} of Stengel, [...] "Casey did use language that would certainly be considered offensive today, but was quite common vernacular in the fifties. He was effusive in his praise of black players like Satchel Paige, Larry Doby and Howard." [...] Conscious of changing times, Stengel was more careful in his choice of words while with the Mets.|$|E

Kirschner previously appeared in two season four episodes [...] "Into the Crevasse" [...] and [...] "Emanuelle Goes to Dinosaur Land". Jen Ponton, who plays a Carvel employee who gets fired, said that the cast and crew of 30 Rock were [...] "wonderful to work with. Everyone was absolutely top-notch.

Mr Thrale has now <b>treated</b> <b>me</b> with a Repository, - and provided it with the pompous Title of Thraliana; I must endeavour to fill it with Nonsense new and old." [...] These encouraging remarks from Johnson set the theme of the work as it became a new [...] "Johnsoniana" [...] collection. In particular, she transferred her previous notes and documentations about Johnson's life into the collection.|$|E

[...] At age 13, {{he realized that he}} found men attractive, and came out to his [...] family at 16. [...] "For the first day, there was nice talk of acceptance, though my father did raise his voice. On the second day, and the third, and the fourth, there was this terrible silence. They <b>treated</b> <b>me</b> like an alien." [...] However, his mother was supportive. She said: [...] "If Páll has the talent to fall in love, he should nurture that talent. And he has as much a right to sit down at my table with his partner as anybody else does with their partner." ...|$|E

500|$|Harrison acted quite {{independently}} {{in selecting}} his cabinet, {{much to the}} dismay of the Republican bosses. He began by delaying the presumed nomination of James G. Blaine as Secretary of State so as to preclude Blaine's involvement {{in the formation of the}} administration, as had occurred in President Garfield's term. In fact, other than Blaine, the only Republican boss initially nominated was Redfield Proctor, as Secretary of War. Senator Shelby Cullom's comment symbolizes Harrison's steadfast aversion to use federal positions for patronage: [...] "I suppose Harrison <b>treated</b> <b>me</b> as well as he did any other Senator; but whenever he did anything for me, it was done so ungraciously that the concession tended to anger rather than please." [...] Harrison's selections shared particular alliances – such as their service in the Civil War, Indiana citizenship and membership in the Presbyterian Church. Nevertheless, Harrison with these choices had alienated pivotal Republican operatives from New York to Pennsylvania to Iowa and prematurely compromised his political power and future. Harrison's normal schedule provided for two full cabinet meetings per week, as well as separate weekly one-on-one meetings with each cabinet member.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the songs}} Carey {{recorded}} specifically for #1's was a cover of Brenda K. Starr's [...] "I Still Believe" [...] (1988) co-produced by Stevie J and Mike Mason. During the late 1980s Starr helped Carey secure a record contract while she worked as Starr's backup singer. In the album's liner notes, Carey wrote {{that the purpose of}} the song was solely paying tribute to her. According to Carey, the song [...] "reminds me of the fact that not long ago I was a teenage girl with nothing to my name but a demo tape, my voice, and my ability to write songs. Brenda K. Starr <b>treated</b> <b>me</b> like a 'star' and gave me a shot." [...] Another song Carey and Stevie J co-produced was a cover of, [...] "Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To)" [...] (1975) by Diana Ross. The latter song was the third non-original song on the album, and experienced a limited release throughout few countries in Europe. During a press release for the album, it was reported that an exclusive live version of [...] "Hero" [...] would be included. However, the idea fell through and was never released.|$|E
500|$|Daniel Cowart is of English {{descent and}} {{was raised in}} Bells, Tennessee. He had a strong {{interest}} in computers and had no criminal record. Cowart attended Jackson Christian School until 2006, but did not graduate. [...] He was expelled from Jackson Christian after calling in a bomb threat. He applied for Jackson State Community College to study computers but, although his family believed he was indeed attending the school, he never provided documentation or pursued other steps to enroll there. Cowart moved to Texas in the spring of 2007 to live with friends he met on the Internet, but was unable to find work and returned to Bells to live with his grandparents a month later. Cowart worked at a Bells grocery store called the Bells Market Place for one year until May 2007 before moving to Texas for a brief time. Cowart worked and got along with several minority co-workers, who later expressed shock at his arrest. Mitchell Twitty, a black former co-worker, said of Cowart, [...] "He <b>treated</b> <b>me</b> like we were best friends. I never, ever heard him make a racist remark." [...] Twitty said Cowart tended to keep to himself and at times acted [...] "a little strange." [...] Other co-workers described him as hard-working and friendly, but said he did not have many friends. One family friend thought he was intelligent and full of potential: [...] "I always saw him as a doctor or lawyer, or even a senator. He even had the potential to become what Obama is, running for president." ...|$|E

500|$|For the 1981 season, Ferrari {{introduced}} {{their first}} turbo engined F1 car, the 126C, which produced tremendous power but was let down by its poor handling. Villeneuve was partnered with Didier Pironi who noted that Villeneuve [...] "had a little family [...] {{but he made}} me welcome and made me feel at home overnight... <b>treated</b> <b>me</b> as an equal in every way." [...] Villeneuve won two races during the season. At the Spanish Grand Prix Villeneuve kept five quicker cars behind him {{for most of the}} race using the superior straight-line speed of his car. After an hour and 46 minutes of racing Villeneuve led second-placed Jacques Laffite by only 0.22 seconds. Fifth-placed Elio de Angelis was only just over a second further back. Harvey Postlethwaite, who was hired by Ferrari to design the follow-on and much more successful 126C2 that won the Constructors' Championship in 1982, later commented on the 126C: [...] "That car...had literally one quarter of the downforce that, say Williams or Brabham had. It had a power advantage over the Cosworths for sure, but it also had massive throttle lag at that time. In terms of sheer ability I think Gilles was on a different plane to the other drivers. To win those races, the 1981 GPs at Monaco and Jarama — on tight circuits — was quite out of this world. I know how bad that car was." [...] At the 1981 Canadian Grand Prix Villeneuve damaged the front wing of his Ferrari and drove for most of the race in heavy rain with the wing obscuring his view ahead. There was a risk of being black flagged but eventually the wing became detached and Villeneuve drove on to finish third with the nose section of his car missing.|$|E
