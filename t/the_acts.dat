5|$|<b>The</b> <b>acts</b> became {{controversial}} {{from prosecution}} thereunder of a Congressman {{and a number}} of newspaper editors. Indeed, the Federalist administration initiated fourteen or more indictments under the Sedition Act, as well as suits against five of the six most prominent Democratic–Republican newspapers. The majority of the legal actions began in 1798 and 1799, and went to trial {{on the eve of the}} 1800 presidential election – timing that hardly appeared coincidental, according to biographer Ferling. Other historians have cited evidence that the Alien and Sedition Acts were rarely enforced, namely: 1) only 10 convictions under the Sedition Act have been identified; 2) Adams never signed a deportation order; and 3) the sources of expressed furor over <b>the</b> <b>acts</b> were Democratic–Republicans. However, other historians have emphasized that <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> were employed for political targeting from the outset, causing many aliens to leave the country. <b>The</b> <b>Acts</b> as well allowed for prosecution of many who opposed the Federalists, even on the floor of Congress. In any case, the election of 1800 in fact became a bitter and volatile contest, with each side expressing extraordinary fear of the other and its policies; after Democratic–Republicans prevailed in the elections of 1800, they used <b>the</b> <b>acts</b> against Federalists before the laws finally expired.|$|E
5|$|Anne (6 February 1665 – 1 August 1714) became Queen of England, Scotland and Ireland on 8 March 1702.

25|$|In addition, {{some states}} have used <b>the</b> <b>ACT</b> to assess <b>the</b> {{performance}} of schools, and require all {{high school students to}} take <b>the</b> <b>ACT,</b> regardless of whether they are college bound. Colorado and Illinois have incorporated <b>the</b> <b>ACT</b> as part of their mandatory testing program since 2001.

5|$|By the 19th century, {{the tower}} was {{obscured}} by the surrounding buildings, and was accessed through the brick-built office in front of it, according to the antiquarian and engraver John Smith. The tower began to become too small for storing all the House of Lords' records, and from 1827 onwards only <b>the</b> <b>acts,</b> journals and minute-books were kept in the tower.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> of Union 1800, {{the royal}} arms were amended, {{dropping}} the French quartering.

5000|$|The {{inconsistency}} identified was twofold. First, {{the definition}} of [...] "marriage" [...] in <b>the</b> <b>ACT</b> act was inconsistent with that in <b>the</b> Marriage <b>Act.</b> Second, <b>the</b> <b>ACT</b> act could not nevertheless operate concurrently with <b>the</b> Marriage <b>Act,</b> since <b>the</b> Marriage <b>Act</b> {{was intended to be}} [...] "a comprehensive and exhaustive statement of the law with respect to the creation and recognition of the legal status of marriage". That exhaustiveness extended to {{the definition of}} marriage; the Court did not accept <b>the</b> <b>ACT's</b> contention that <b>the</b> Marriage <b>Act</b> left room for same-sex marriage simply because it did not expressly exclude it. Nor did the Court accept <b>the</b> <b>ACT's</b> contention that <b>the</b> Marriage <b>Act</b> and <b>the</b> <b>ACT</b> act [...] "do not regulate the same status of 'marriage'". After all, the Court observed, [...] "as both the short title and the long title to <b>the</b> <b>ACT</b> <b>Act</b> show, <b>the</b> <b>Act</b> is intended to provide for marriage equality". The Court then found it unnecessary to consider inconsistency with <b>the</b> Family Law <b>Act</b> 1975. It required <b>the</b> <b>ACT</b> to pay <b>the</b> Commonwealth's costs.|$|R

5|$|Mandatory {{sentencing}} {{and increased}} punishment were enacted when the United States Congress passed the Boggs Act of 1952 and the Narcotics Control Act of 1956. <b>The</b> <b>acts</b> made a first-time cannabis possession offense {{a minimum of}} two to ten years with a fine up to $20,000; however in 1970 the United States Congress repealed mandatory penalties for cannabis offenses.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Act</b> orders <b>the</b> {{superintendent}} {{to automatically}} disqualify a municipal or county candidate whose {{check for the}} qualifying fee is dishonored. <b>The</b> <b>Act</b> also authorizes <b>the</b> Secretary of State to investigate election fraud. <b>The</b> <b>Act</b> allows an election to be postponed when the Governor has {{declared a state of}} emergency. <b>The</b> <b>Act</b> gives a write-in candidate in a municipal election more time to give notice of his candidacy. <b>The</b> <b>Act</b> eliminates <b>the</b> requirement that municipal registrars must be residents of the county in which they are registrars. <b>The</b> <b>Act</b> requires registrars to forward a voter 2 ̆ 7 s change of address to the voter 2 ̆ 7 s new county when the voter completes a voter registration application at the polling place. <b>The</b> <b>Act</b> mandates that ballots indicate candidates alphabetically. <b>The</b> <b>act</b> provides that when there are candidates with same or similar names, their addresses are printed on <b>the</b> ballots. <b>The</b> <b>Act</b> outlines that absentee voters must show the same identification as other voters. <b>The</b> <b>Act</b> removes a hunting and fishing license from the list of voter identification. <b>The</b> <b>Act</b> changes <b>the</b> polling requirements for a special election when only one candidate is qualified. <b>The</b> <b>Act</b> makes voting equipment tampering a felony. <b>The</b> <b>Act</b> also changes provisions relating to recall elections...|$|R

5|$|Many of Priestley's {{political}} writings {{supported the}} repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts, which restricted the rights of Dissenters. They could not hold political office, serve in the armed forces, or attend Oxford and Cambridge unless they subscribed to the Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England. Dissenters repeatedly petitioned Parliament to repeal <b>the</b> <b>Acts,</b> arguing that they were being treated as second-class citizens.|$|E
5|$|On 3 October 1918, the 5th Brigade—of {{which the}} 18th Battalion was part—became engaged {{in its last}} battle of the First World War when {{breaching}} the Hindenburg Line close to Beaurevoir and Montbrehain.

5|$|Once the Alien and Sedition Acts were passed, the Federalists {{pushed for}} this letter to be {{printed in the}} Vermont Journal, which Spooner did, thus adding {{additional}} charges against Lyon. One other charge included publishing letters written by the poet Joel Barlow, which Lyon had read at political rallies. These also were published prior to <b>the</b> <b>Acts.</b> Lyon's defense {{was to be the}} unconstitutionality of <b>the</b> <b>Acts,</b> as Jeffersonians saw them as violating the First Amendment to the Constitution. In Lyon's particular case, there was the aforementioned letter to Alden Spooner {{as well as that of}} Barlow, which meant Lyon felt entitled to bring up the Constitution's safeguards against ex post facto laws. This defense was not allowed.|$|E
5|$|The {{executive}} {{body of the}} county consists of a board of commissioners. The three commissioners are elected from county districts in staggered four-year terms.

5|$|The {{manuscript}} {{is believed}} to have been housed in Caesarea in the 6th century, together with the Codex Sinaiticus, as they have the same unique divisions of chapters in <b>the</b> <b>Acts.</b> It came to Italy – probably from Constantinople – after the Council of Florence (1438–1445).|$|E
