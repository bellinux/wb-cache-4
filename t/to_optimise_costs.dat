40|$|A new {{redesign}} {{approach has}} been developed considering {{the perspective of a}} designer who wants to improve product performance over the whole life-cycle while simultaneously optimising costs. Product components can be identified which incur high costs compared to their functional value. In order to identify the optimisation potential, the methods of Value Analysis, Quality Function Deployment and Life Cycle Costing have been matched to each other and integrated into a comprehensive concept. Based on a case study of vehicles, this paper explains the theoretical approach and analyses for designers <b>to</b> <b>optimise</b> <b>costs</b> and conduct product redesign by using Value-Oriented Life Cycle Costing...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the applicability of the 1 3 7 Cs technique in obtaining spatial distributed inform ation on mean soil redistribution rates in Central-South Chile. For this purpose four fields of Palehumult soil and contrasting land use and management were selected in the Coastal Mountain Range of the 9 th Region: Crop fields under subsistence and commercial management and non-permanent prairies under subsistence and commercial management. The spatial distribution of the soil redistribu t i o n rates obtained by the 1 3 7 Cs method was similar to the one obtained by pedological observations. Also, annual sediment fluxes measured at experimental plots were similar to the erosion rates determined by the 1 3 7 Cs method at adjacent points. The 1 3 7 Cs technique is seen as an efficient method to obtain long-term soil redistribution rates under the climatic conditions and the soil type selected in Chile. In the future, it is necessary to study the applicability of the method under other climatic conditions and soil types occurring in Chile in which erosion is not so evident, and to adjust the method <b>to</b> <b>optimise</b> <b>costs</b> and benefi t s...|$|E

30|$|There is {{one notable}} exception: Estonia. Approximately 44 % of Estonian firms had cut wages by summer 2009, and 39 % still {{planned to do}} so in {{relation}} to the crisis. Why is Estonia so different from the other countries examined in this work? A plausible answer lies in a combination of four factors: first, the economy has very flexible wage-setting institutions, with the lowest coverage of collective wage agreements among the sampled countries. Second, it reformed its labour regulations in 2009, imposing more flexible EPL and considerably lowering the layoff costs for employers 9. As argued earlier, both factors tend to favour downward wage flexibility (see also Babecký et al. 2010). Third, Estonia in 2009 was not yet a euro area member state and had a currency board arrangement; this differentiates it from the other two non-euro area countries in the sample that also have relatively flexible wage-setting systems but featured floating exchange rate regimes at the time: the Czech Republic and Poland. These two countries’ national currencies depreciated during the crisis, which gave firms more leeway <b>to</b> <b>optimise</b> <b>costs</b> and reduced the need to cut wages. Fourth and perhaps most important, is the intensity of the negative demand shock that hit the Estonian economy: between Q 2 2008 and Q 2 2009, GDP fell by 16 % (in seasonally adjusted terms). Seemingly, a decline of such magnitude empowers firms to use all possible channels for cutting costs, including base wage reductions. The extent of downward flexibility in nominal base wages during the most acute phase of the crisis in Estonia has also been documented by Dabušinskas and Rõõm (2011).|$|E

40|$|AbstractA multi-period mixed-integer linear {{programming}} {{model has been}} developed to help explore future pathways for electricity supply where costs and carbon reduction are a priority. The model follows a life cycle approach and can <b>optimise</b> on <b>costs</b> and {{on a number of}} environmental objectives. To illustrate the application, the model has been optimised on two objectives: whole system costs and global warming potential (GWP) using the UK as an example. Four different scenarios have been considered up to 2060, each assuming different electricity demand and carbon reduction targets. When <b>optimising</b> on system <b>costs,</b> they range from £ 156. 6 bn for the least carbon-constrained scenario with moderate increase in electricity demand to £ 269. 9 bn for the scenario with high demand and requiring 100 % decarbonisation of electricity supply by 2035. In optimisation on GWP, negative carbon emissions are achieved in all scenarios, ranging from − 0. 5 to − 1. 28 Gt CO 2 eq. over the period, owing to biomass carbon capture and storage. Optimising on the GWP also reduces significantly other environmental impacts at <b>costs</b> comparable <b>to</b> <b>optimised</b> <b>costs.</b> This research shows that meeting carbon targets will require careful planning and consideration of objectives other than costs alone to ensure that optimal rather than suboptimal solutions are found for a more sustainable electricity supply...|$|R
