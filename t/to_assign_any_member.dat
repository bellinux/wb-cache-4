5|$|The {{results of}} {{statistical}} analysis will be strongly affected by any errors {{in identifying the}} inventory of glyphs, {{as well as by}} divergence from a purely syllabic representation, such as a glyph for reduplication. There are also large differences in the frequencies of individual syllables among the Rapanui texts, which makes any direct identification problematic.

Even though both Hitler and Dönitz demanded an increase, the Luftwaffe General Staff declared it was unable <b>to</b> <b>assign</b> <b>any</b> more for naval reconnaissance purposes.

5000|$|Freiberger has {{a dubious}} {{reputation}} in science-fiction fandom, {{due to his}} involvement in the final seasons of Star Trek, Space: 1999, The Six Million Dollar Man, and the cartoon series Josie and the Pussycats, all of which were cancelled on his watch.

50|$|Hilbert's {{approach}} {{signaled the}} shift to the modern axiomatic method. In this, Hilbert was anticipated by Moritz Pasch's work from 1882. Axioms are not taken as self-evident truths.

The elements, such as point, line, plane, and others, could be substituted, as Hilbert is reported to have said to Schoenflies and Kötter, by tables, chairs, glasses of beer and other such objects. It is their defined relationships that are discussed.|$|R
40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that the {{constraint}} to be imposed to the maximization of the entropy for processes outside the class of thermodynamical systems, is generally not well defined. In fact, any probability distribution can be derived from Jaynes's principle with a suitable choice of the constraint. In the case of Tsallis's non-extensive formalism, this implies that {{it is not possible to}} establish any connection between specific non-thermodynamical processes and non-extensive mechanisms and, in particular, <b>to</b> <b>assign</b> <b>any</b> unambiguous non-extensivity index q to those processes.
