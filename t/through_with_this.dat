5|$|In 2010's {{video game}} , the Queen (voiced by Kyoko Satomi in Japanese and Susanne Blakeslee in English) {{appears in the}} Dwarf Woodlands world. She {{recruits}} the protagonist Terra to kill Snow White and bring back her heart in return for allowing him to use the Magic Mirror to locate Master Xehanort. Terra, like the huntsman, ultimately does not go <b>through</b> <b>with</b> <b>this,</b> and the Queen, learning of his betrayal, forces the Mirror to consume him, but Terra manages to fight the Mirror off and the Queen reluctantly gives him the information he looks for. She later appears briefly in Ventus's scenario, where she crosses paths with him {{on her way to}} poison Snow White. She drops the poisoned apple, which Ventus returns to her. She notices Ventus's Keyblade and muses that Terra threatened her with a similar weapon. She is then only briefly mentioned in Aqua's storyline, when the Magic Mirror tells Aqua that the Queen is dead and he is no longer under her control.|$|E
5|$|Streltsov was {{released}} on 4 February 1963, five years into his twelve-year sentence, and owing to the ban from professional play began to split his time between work at the ZiL factory {{and the study of}} automotive engineering at the attached technical college. After failing to patch up his differences with Alla, he married Raisa Mikhailovna in September 1963. He started to play for the amateur factory team, which caused it to attract large crowds, both at home and away. When the ZiL side travelled to Gorky for an away match late in the 1964 season, the team's coach received orders from above not to play Streltsov, something which spectators noticed immediately when the match started; during the first half, they began to riot and threatened to burn down the stadium, chanting Streltsov's name. Worried that the angry crowd might go <b>through</b> <b>with</b> <b>this,</b> the Gorky factory chief ordered the ZiL coach to send Streltsov out for the second half. On stepping onto the field, the former Gulag prisoner received a standing ovation.|$|E

25|$|Germany made {{a request}} to {{purchase}} five Reapers and four ground control stations, plus related support material and training. The request, being made through the Foreign Military Sales process, was presented to Congress through the Defense Security Cooperation Agency on 1 August 2008 and is valued at US$205 million. However, Germany did not go <b>through</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> procurement {{for the time being}} and decided to lease the IAI Heron offered by IAI and Rheinmetall instead, initially for the duration of one year, representing a stop-gap measure before a long-term decision on a MALE-system is being made.|$|E
25|$|The union, {{faced with}} a {{challenge}} to its very existence, threatened to strike if the Mayor went <b>through</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> plan. With {{the support of the}} national CIO, the union was able to maintain its collective bargaining agreements and the right to represent the IRT and BMT employees after the City took over those systems in 1940. The union soon found itself struggling with the special problems of creating a civil service system for thousands of employees, while providing representation for thousands of workers who faced problems with meeting the City's new naturalization and medical requirements. But the union lost ground among its members, both in terms of actual numbers after it lost the closed shop and in terms of actual support, since many workers who may have remained members saw the union as less important now that they had the seeming job security that civil service status promised and the union had lost the right to strike.|$|E

This represents a sharp reversal of fortunes from the previous year; in 2016 Djokovic and Murray dominated the season while Federer and Nadal struggled with injuries, whereas in 2017 while Federer and Nadal both enjoyed a great resurgence in form, Djokovic and Murray both struggled and had their seasons cut short because of injuries.|$|E

500|$|Ling Bouvier, {{voiced by}} Nancy Cartwright, is Selma Bouvier's adopted daughter. She shares Selma' s laugh. In [...] "Goo Goo Gai Pan", Selma discovers {{that she has}} reached {{menopause}} and adopts Ling in China, after lying that she is married to Homer, to fool the Chinese authorities into thinking that Ling {{would be part of}} a traditional family as opposed to being raised by a single mother. The authorities briefly reclaim Ling, but the adoption agent Ms. Woo relates to her experiences of her childhood with her single mother and allows Selma to adopt Ling. Ling has since become a recurring character and has appeared in several episodes. She seems to get along well with her cousin Maggie. Since Patty told Selma to give up smoking once the baby came home, Selma claimed she would switch to chewing tobacco, although it is not clear if she has followed <b>through</b> <b>with</b> <b>this.</b>|$|E
500|$|Electronic Arts often acquires new {{companies}} to expand or add to new product lines. For instance, EA {{chairman and chief}} executive officer Larry Probst said after the acquisition of JAMDAT Mobile that [...] "we intend to build a leading global position in the [...] business of providing games on mobile phones". EA followed <b>through</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> later, making the company into EA Mobile, and allowing people to purchase and download content produced by them directly onto their phones. After the acquisition of Origin Systems, some staff in that company claimed that Electronic Arts initially gave them more resources, but allowed little latitude if employees made a mistake, and in some cases no longer trusted them, and even worked against them. EA has shut down entire companies or the studios thereof after acquiring them, including [...] the studio DICE Canada, Origin Systems, EA Chicago (NuFX), and Pandemic Studios. Gaming blogger Brian Crecente has said that fears that EA doesn't care about the quality of their products after they are acquired are debatable.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1993, Jackson was accused {{of child sexual abuse}} by a 13-year-old boy, Jordan Chandler, and his father, Evan Chandler, a dentist. The Chandler family demanded payment from Jackson, which he refused. Jordan Chandler {{eventually}} told the police that Jackson had sexually abused him. Jordan's mother was, however, adamant that there had been no wrongdoing on Jackson's part. Evan was recorded discussing his intention to pursue charges, saying, [...] "If I go <b>through</b> <b>with</b> <b>this,</b> I win big-time. There's no way I lose. I will get everything I want and they will be destroyed forever..... Michael's career will be over." [...] Jackson used the recording to argue that he was the victim of a jealous father whose only goal was to extort money. In January 1994, after an investigation, deputy Los Angeles County district attorney Michael J. Montagna stated that Chandler would not be charged with extortion, due to lack of cooperation from Jackson's party and its willingness to negotiate with Chandler for several weeks, among other reasons.|$|E

2500|$|In a {{fight that}} would be called [...] "The Dance in Detroit", both Severn and Shamrock circled each other with little to no contact for a {{combined}} total of almost thirty minutes. [...] "I took {{the center of the}} ring understanding that I was going to be fighting for my life and Dan never came at me," [...] Shamrock said. Severn later said that his strategy was to purposely not engage with Shamrock and wait for the fans to boo, hoping that the booing would affect Shamrock psychologically and force him to make a mistake that Severn could capitalize on. Finally, after over 15 minutes of stalling, Severn shot for a takedown, but was unsuccessful and following a brief scramble, Shamrock put Severn on his back in full mount. Shamrock held the mount for close to five minutes, throwing open fist palm strikes to Severn's head and an occasional closed fist punch to the body. Shamrock felt as though he would have damaged Severn badly and perhaps finished him from this position of full mount if he was allowed to punch Severn in the face with a closed fist. Severn eventually gave his back in an attempt to get out and the risk paid off as Shamrock slid off Severn's back and onto his back in full guard. Severn landed a headbutt to open a cut above Shamrock's eye and followed with elbow strikes and punches from Shamrock's guard. Shamrock eventually got back to his feet and after six more minutes stalling, the fight went to a judges decision. The judges gave a split decision win to Dan Severn, which upset Shamrock because he felt as though Severn had broken the rules by utilizing the banned closed fist punches to the head and headbutts. Chants of [...] "boring!" [...] and [...] "Let's go Red Wings!" [...] were echoed throughout the arena during the fight. Shamrock later stated that going <b>through</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> fight was the biggest regret of his fighting career.|$|E
