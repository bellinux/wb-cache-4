Cubs are divided into small groups called Sixes led by a Sixer and a Second. The Pack Scouter may appoint the most responsible Cub in the Pack as a Senior Sixer.|$|E

5|$|The {{foundation}} document stipulated that fees {{were to be}} fixed by the governors and could range from £4–8 per year; in 1888, the fees charged were £7/10s per year. Provision was made for the allocation of scholarships {{to the value of}} the tuition fees for one in every ten boys in the school; one-half of the scholarships were arranged by the governors and awarded only <b>to</b> <b>boys</b> who had spent three years education in a public elementary school. Around the turn of the 20thcentury, an attempt was made to attract younger boys into the school by reducing fees for those under the age of 12 from £2/20s to £2 per term.|$|E
5|$|The {{honor of}} {{becoming}} an altar server, was, in the past, a privilege only available <b>to</b> <b>boys</b> but has since become coed. Altar servers wear long, white, plain robes and assist the priest in his duties during the Mass. At Mt. St. Peter Church, there are four altar servers at every Mass. One is the book bearer and {{is in charge of}} bringing the Bible to the priest at the times during which the priest reads from the Bible during the Mass. The cross bearer holds a large, wooded crucifix and commences the procession in which the priest enters the church. Also present in the procession are the acolytes, and the book bearer. He or she also leads the procession out of the church {{at the end of the}} Mass. The last two altar servers are acolytes and are in charge of lighting the candles in the church prior to the beginning of the Mass and extinguishing them after Mass.|$|E
5|$|The studio defined only Blythe and {{the pets}} as characters, so the Cahills sought {{to expand the}} human character's fictional universe, {{designing}} Blythe's friends, Mrs. Twombly, and the Biskit twins. Julie explained {{that she and her}} husband's preference for quirky comedy inspired that of the show. While the show is aimed at a demographic of young girls, Julie said that she and the writers attempt to cater <b>to</b> <b>boys</b> of the same age and parent viewers simultaneously. Original music for the show is accomplished by film and television composers Daniel Ingram and Steffan Andrews. Ingram wrote that the urban setting of Littlest Pet Shop prompted the use of a modern style of music. The score incorporates pop and other cultural influences for the same reason. Ingram found Hasbro's pushing of the limitations for music in daytime television a source of pride.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} C∞ generic immersions of the projective {{plane into}} the 3 -sphere. Pinkall {{has shown that}} every immersion of the projective plane is homotopic through immersions <b>to</b> <b>Boy's</b> immersion, or its mirror. There is another lesser-known immersion of the projective plane with self-intersection set equivalent <b>to</b> <b>Boy's</b> but whose image is not homeomorphic <b>to</b> <b>Boy's.</b> We show that any C∞ generic immersion of the projective plane whose self-intersection set in the 3 -sphere is connected and has a single triple point is ambiently isotopic to precisely {{one of these two}} models, or their mirrors. We further show that any generic immersion of the projective plane with one triple point can be obtained by a sequence of toral and spherical surgical modifications of these models. Finally we present some simple applications of the theorem regarding discrete ambient automorphism groups; image-homology of immersions with one triple point; and almost tight ambient isotopy classes...|$|R

5|$|The troop {{committee}} {{is made up}} of responsible adults who are approved by the local council and the chartered organization. The committee chairman leads the committee and appoints its members to specific tasks such as treasurer, secretary, advancement, activities, equipment and membership. The committee and the chartered organization representative are responsible for the selection of the Scoutmaster and assistant Scoutmasters. The Scoutmaster must be at least twenty-one and is directly responsible for training and guiding the boy leaders, working with other adults to bring Scouting <b>to</b> <b>boys,</b> and for using the methods of Scouting to achieve the aims of Scouting. A troop may have a chaplain who helps to provide a spiritual element in the unit program, provides spiritual counseling as needed, and encourage Scouts to participate in the religious emblems program.|$|E
5|$|Child {{marriage}} (including {{union or}} cohabitation) {{is defined as}} marriage {{under the age of}} eighteen and is an ancient custom. In 2010 it was estimated that 67 million women, then, in their twenties had been married before they turned eighteen, and that 150 million would be in the next decade, equivalent to 15 million per year. This number had increased to 70 million by 2012. In developing countries one third of girls are married under age, and 1:9 before 15. The practice is commonest in South Asia (48% of women), Africa (42%) and Latin America and the Caribbean (29%). The highest prevalence is in Western and Sub-Saharan Africa. The percentage of girls married before the age of eighteen is as high as 75% in countries such as Niger (Nour, Table I). Most child marriage involves girls. For instance in Mali the ratio of girls <b>to</b> <b>boys</b> is 72:1, while in countries such as the United States the ratio is 8:1. Marriage may occur as early as birth, with the girl being sent to her husbands home as early as age seven.|$|E
