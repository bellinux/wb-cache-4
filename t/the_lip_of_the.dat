5|$|The {{breeding}} season is from August to January, though dependent on local conditions. The nest site is {{usually in the}} drooping foliage of a tall shrub or low tree, such as Casuarina, Melaleuca, Acacia, and mallee eucalypts. The site is sometimes near to or overhanging water, and the nest is usually constructed {{at the end of}} a drooping branch, suspended from twigs or foliage. The striped honeyeater often nests in the vicinity of a nesting butcherbird. It builds a deep cup-shaped or bag-shaped nest, with thick walls and <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opening turned slightly inwards. The nest is made from thin dry grass and coated with plant down, feathers or wool, the coating often completely obscuring the grass framework. It is lined with spider webs, hair, wool or rootlets, and on occasion flowers and tissue paper. The striped honeyeater will commonly re-use material from previous nests.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, it was nature, not {{political}} maneuvering, {{that led to}} the filling of New Melones Lake. The winter and spring rainy season of 1982 was one of the wettest recorded in the 20th century. The Stanislaus River swelled to such high levels that it exceeded what could be safely released through the dam's outlets, and the reservoir rapidly surpassed the temporary limit. The winter of 1983 was even wetter and pushed water so high that it reached <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emergency spillway (but did not flow over it), a level that has not been surpassed since. With the lake full, the state of California lifted the temporary limit in March, 1983. A deciding factor in the rescinding of the water-level limit was the prevention of $50 million in damages by New Melones Dam in 1982 and 1983, which demonstrated the dam's value for flood control.|$|E

25|$|For the RAF, {{everything}} went {{according to plan}} on the first day. Axis supply columns and airfields had been hit repeatedly up {{to the start of}} the attack and once the operation began, British columns were able to move unmolested from their starting points at Sofafi and Buq-Buq, to their destinations covered by RAF fighters. Axis aircraft managed only six attacks that day. On the eastern side, at 05:15, Coast Force—commanded by Brigadier Reginald Savory and charged with capturing Halfaya Pass—started to move on to their objective. On the escarpment was the Halfaya Group, composed of the 2nd battalion Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders, the 13 tanks (twelve Matildas and one light tank) of the 4th Royal Tank Regiment′s C Squadron (which had previously captured Halfaya Pass during Operation Brevity), and an artillery battery from the 31st Field Regiment. To their east and below <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> escarpment were the 1st Battalion 6th Rajputana Rifles and 2nd Battalion 5th Mahratta Light Infantry, two troops of the 4th Royal Tank Regiment′s A Squadron, and a few 25-pounder guns.|$|E

25|$|Prospecting was {{successful}} and several opencasts are visible below the large tanks built along its length. The only {{exception is the}} final and very large tank, below which are two reservoirs. It is likely that this complex was used for washing powdered ore to collect the gold dust. More leats and tanks can be found below {{the line of the}} main aqueduct, some of which are shown on the map of the site. They surround <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> very large opencast and the tank shown at right is one which was built on the main aqueduct. It {{was successful}} in finding a vein, judging by the opencast below, but must have been modified later to feed a washing table built to the left-hand side (near the figure in the picture), probably to wash the crushed ore from the same opencast working. It is labelled Tank C in the schematic diagram. Similar tanks occur below as the Romans followed the large vein down to the road and the main opencast. Most of the opencast workings must therefore be Roman in origin, since one of the aqueducts has been confirmed by carbon 14 dating as to predate all modern workings. Just by the road itself the Carreg Pumsaint has been erected in the space beside a large mound, now thought to be a dump of waste material from mining activities.|$|E
25|$|The Mask of Life's descent ends in Mahri Nui, an {{underwater}} city originally part of Voya Nui before it broke off and {{sunk into the}} sea. Upon sight, it becomes an object {{of interest to the}} Matoran villagers as well as the Barraki: six former warlords sent to the Pit (a prison that sits on <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city) after their crimes as part of the League of Six Kingdoms. But after the Pit was damaged in the Great Cataclysm, they escaped into the surrounding ocean and were mutated by its mutagen waters. Believing the mask can change them back so they can rule the Kingdoms once again, the Barraki battle one another for possession of the Ignika. Meanwhile, the Toa Inika continue their descent through the stone cord, where they battle mutated incarnations of the Piraka, Vezon and an army of murderous Zyglak. Upon reaching the depths of the sea, the Mask of Life transforms the heroes into the water-breathing Toa Mahri, complete with new masks and weapons. The team engage with the Barraki and their aquatic Rahi armies upon arrival, but {{in the midst of the}} battle, Matoro is imprisoned in the Pit by a robotic Maxilos guard that reveals itself as Makuta Teridax, who possessed the robot after his essence followed the Toa through the stone cord. He informs Matoro that Mata Nui's life can only be saved if the Toa shatter the cord, and although not trustful in the villain's words, he relays the information to his team-mates. They agree and evacuate Matoran from both locations before proceeding to destroy the cord; sending Voya Nui plummeting into the ocean and demolishing Mahri Nui in the process. But by the time the Toa Mahri retrieve the Ignika, Mata Nui dies. Believing there's still hope, Matoro - the one person who can touch the Ignika without becoming cursed - races towards a hole in the seabed with it before Voya Nui descends to close it, leaving his team to continue fighting the Barraki. Once in, he falls through a waterfall in what resembles a large cave and hears a voice from inside the mask telling him to put it on. In doing so, Matoro learns of the Ignika's history and how to use it to resurrect Mata Nui. Now knowing it was his destiny to sacrifice himself to save the universe, Matoro uses the sentient mask's powers to teleport the Toa Mahri back to Metru Nui and make them amphibious, before the mask turns his body into pure energy that saves the Great Spirit. Meanwhile, the Maxilos body that Teridax inhabited is found badly damaged after a ferocious battle with the Barraki's armies, and is so presumed dead. Mata Nui has been saved, but remains asleep.|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{displacement field}} along <b>the</b> <b>lips</b> <b>of</b> an internal crack in an infinite elastic plate, submitted to pure shear, was undertaken, {{based on the}} exact solution. It was shown that <b>the</b> in-plane components <b>of</b> displacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crack consist of: (i) a linear term, normal to <b>the</b> initial axis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crack, which brings this axis to its effective position. The angle λ formed by this axis and <b>the</b> initial axis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crack has a tangent given by tan λ = 2 σ∞ E, where σ∞ is the normal stress applied to the plate at infinity and E <b>the</b> elastic modulus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> material, and (ii) a parallel to the initial axis component of displacement, which is proportional to <b>the</b> square <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distance from <b>the</b> tip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crack. This component for pure shear is always negative, making <b>the</b> <b>lips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crack overlap each other. If to these in-plane displacements the out-of-plane component is added, <b>the</b> topography <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crack in pure shear is presenting a ravine with negative slopes, which terminates to two hills around the crack tips, which are sliced in halves along the crack-axis. Either half of each hill is replaced by its mirror surface, relative to the undeformed lateral faces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plate. It was shown that <b>the</b> overlapping <b>of</b> <b>lips</b> starts with <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> any shearing load and develops up to an eventual creation of plastic enclaves at <b>the</b> tips <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crack. Conditions for zero relative displacement between <b>the</b> respective <b>lips</b> were established, which consist in adding a complementary lateral tensile load, whose magnitude depends on the applied load to the plate. © 1986...|$|R
