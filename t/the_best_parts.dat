5|$|George Smith {{established}} a second distillery during 1849, named the Cairngorm-Delnabo Distillery but by 1855 or 1856, both distilleries were running at full capacity, and {{were unable to}} meet rising demand. The operation of two separate sites was also proving difficult and expensive, so plans were formed {{around the same time}} to build a new, larger distillery further down the hill at Minmore. Construction of this new distillery was underway when the old Upper Drumin distillery was destroyed by fire during 1858. Construction of the new Minmore distillery was sped up and salvageable equipment from the Upper Drumin distillery was transferred to the new Mimmore distillery. The Delnabo distillery was closed {{at the same time and}} <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>parts</b> of the equipment were also transferred to the Minmore plant. Production commenced at the new plant during 1859 and it was around the same time the legal entity of George & J.G. Smith, Ltd. was formed.|$|E

The looting was focused on <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>parts</b> of the sculptures, principally the head with the enigmatic eyes. Only later the area was purchased and excavation campaigns began.|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} reviewers {{compared}} this book {{with the earlier}} one, Metamorphosis. [...] The Edmonton Journal considers David Suzuki: The Autobiography to be more candid and insightful than the previous book. On the other hand, Peter Desbarats, writing in Literary Review of Canada, suggests that [...] Metamorphosis had more personal charm. Desbarats is disappointed that The Autobiography {{does not provide a}} better reflection on the themes of Metamorphosis. He points out that <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>parts,</b> Suzuki's early years, are condensed from one third of Metamorphosis to a single chapter in The Autobiography. [...] Desbarats states that neither book ends with a [...] "satisfying final word" [...] and concludes that Suzuki [...] "is his own worst and most frustrating biographer".|$|E

[...] She disliked the work, {{describing}} it variously as [...] "a poor affair" [...] and [...] "my poor book", and claimed that Gatteschi had written <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>parts.</b> There are no statistics on the sales of the book, but it received at least seventeen reviews. In general, the reviews were favourable; as Moskal explains, [...] "with nationalist movements simmering in Europe, to culminate in the revolutions of 1848, reviewers took Rambles seriously as a political as well as a literary endeavour." ...|$|E
500|$|Following Naruto finale, {{there have}} been also {{comments}} on Sasuke's appearances in the sequel and spinoff series. Reviewing Boruto: Naruto the Movie, Chris Zimmerman from DVD Talk noted that Sasuke's personal issues with Sarada fit the main theme and paralleled Naruto's issues with Boruto.

Dan Rhodes said that Sasuke and Naruto's fight scenes in the movie are some of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>parts</b> of the film, predicting longtime fans would look forward to them.|$|E
500|$|Writer Peter C. Newman {{concluded}} that [...] "Stursberg's rage dominates his crackling autobiography - as does his grief {{for the lost}} network's unfulfilled promise." [...] Columnist Martin Knelman, in the Toronto Star, advised, [...] "Don't expect a balanced account of the troubles that brewed. This is strictly the Gospel According to Richard - entertaining but also blatantly self-serving. ... He had no appetite for compromise, consensus or conciliation. He seemed to relish the chance to shock people, make them angry and create dramatic showdowns. Now with this book, he seizes the chance to attack those who stood in his way." [...] Knelman found <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>parts</b> were [...] "the passages where he goes after his perceived enemies with a hatchet", while Newman found [...] "the volume's most devastating profile [...] that of CBC president Hubert Lacroix".|$|E

500|$|A film {{adaptation}} of Nancy Drew {{was released on}} June 15, 2007 by Warner Bros. Pictures, with Emma Roberts as Nancy Drew, Max Thieriot as Ned Nickerson and Tate Donovan as Carson Drew. Andrew Fleming directed the film, while Jerry Weintraub produced. As with the earlier Drew films, reactions were mixed. Some see the film as updated version of the basic character: [...] "although it has been glammed up for the lucrative tween demographic, the movie retains <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>parts</b> of the books, including, of course, their intelligent main character." [...] Others find the movie [...] "jolting" [...] because Nancy's [...] "new classmates prefer shopping to sleuthing, and Nancy's plaid skirt, penny loafers, and magnifying glass make her something of a dork, not the town hero {{she was in the}} Midwest." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Smith {{performed}} her own off-Broadway one-woman show entitled More at the Union Square Theatre in New York City. Directed by Judith Ivey, {{the play}} is about her mixed feelings over the success of The Simpsons, her parents, her relationships, and her struggles with bulimia. The New York Times critic Margo Jefferson called it an [...] "appealing if overlong show", adding that [...] "The career narrative needed shortening. This would involve some editing and revising but wouldn't taint <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>parts</b> of More. It is refreshing to hear a celebrity talk cleanly about being fame-driven and about not getting the degree or the kind of fame you craved. It's fun to watch a skilled actress use her craft to the full." [...] She would later perform the play for three weeks in Los Angeles the following year.|$|E
