5|$|Kulwicki raced in fourNASCAR Busch Grand National Series (now Xfinity Series) {{races in}} 1984. At the time, the Busch Grand National Series was {{considered}} NASCAR's feeder circuit, a proving ground for drivers who wished <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> organization's premiere circuit, the Winston Cup. Kulwicki qualified second fastest and finished {{in second place}} at his first career NASCAR race, which {{took place at the}} Milwaukee Mile, several city blocks from where he grew up. Later that year, he finished seventh at Charlotte and fifth at Bristol. The following year, Kulwicki placed sixteenth in the season-opening Busch Series race at Daytona. Although he won the pole position at that year's event in Milwaukee, he finished fourteenth because of engine problems. Kulwicki's Busch Series successes caught car owner Bill Terry's eye and he offered Kulwicki a chance to race for him in several Winston Cup events.|$|E

25|$|Kierkegaard decided <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Tree of the {{knowledge}} {{of good and evil}} for himself, replacing Adam, and make his choice in the presence of God, where no one was there to accuse or judge him but his Creator. This is what he had Abraham do in Fear and Trembling. This is how Kierkegaard thought learning about oneself takes place. Here is where the single individual learns about guilt and innocence. His book, The Concept of Anxiety, makes clear that Adam did have knowledge when he made his choice and that was {{the knowledge}} of freedom. The prohibition was there but so was freedom and Eve and Adam decided to use it.|$|E
25|$|The {{creation}} of the Home Guard (initially as the Local Defence Volunteers) following Anthony Eden's broadcast appeal to the Nation on Tuesday 14 May 1940 also created further demand for arms production to equip this new force. BSA, as the only rifle producer in Britain, had <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mark and the workforce voluntarily went onto a seven-day week. Motorcycle production was also stepped up from 500 to 1,000 machines per week which meant a finished machine coming off the production line every 5 minutes. The motorcycle department had been left intact in 1939 due to demand which was doubled following Dunkirk. At the same time BSA staff were providing lectures and demonstrations on motorcycle riding and maintenance to 250,000 officers and men {{in all parts of}} the UK.|$|E

500|$|On August 31, Tancredo shifted {{momentarily}} {{to a new}} issue. On {{the two-year}} anniversary of the landfall of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, he called for funds to be withdrawn and federal aid be cut off for the recovery effort. He remarked that it was time, [...] "the taxpayer gravy train left the New Orleans station." [...] The move was perhaps a step for the candidate to woo fiscal conservatives and advocates for states' rights, commenting that [...] "at some point, {{state and local officials}} and individuals have got <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plate and take some initiative, the mentality that people can wait around indefinitely for the federal taxpayer to solve all their worldly problems has got to come to an end." ...|$|E
500|$|Actress Jasika Nicole {{was pleased}} that the writers decided to let her {{character}} discover Walter's secret, commenting [...] "Astrid finds out in a really emotional way because Walter lets it slip to her accidentally. I {{think that it was}} really nice for them to invite Astrid into the importance of that instead of keeping her in the dark. At least she knows that she's a part of this family and this affects her. I think she serves as a really important character in these later episodes because Astrid is kind of the only person that isn't directly involved with everything that is still on his side. She has <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plate and be that comfort for him because if he doesn't have anyone there, he's basically going to regress {{and go back to the}} place, I think mentally, that he was in when he was in the mental institution.

500|$|The three {{remaining}} clubs (Belfast Giants, Nottingham Panthers, and Sheffield Steelers) began {{considering the}} formation of a new league with a lower wage cap and larger commitment to British players to attract other clubs into joining them. In the weeks that followed they were joined by Basingstoke Bison, Cardiff Devils, and Coventry Blaze of the British National League and two new organisations from London and Manchester. A team based in Glasgow was also planned, but did not come to fruition. The new league met considerable opposition from the British National League and the governing body Ice Hockey UK. IHUK wished the remaining Superleague clubs to integrate themselves into the BNL and initially refused to grant the new league affiliation. The Superleague clubs were reluctant to join the predominantly British trained league after several years of playing in an import-dominated league where British players were seldom able <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> standard of their North American and European counterparts. The Elite League instead preferred a twelve import limit {{with the rest of the}} team comprising British-trained players.|$|E

[...] The Truth About Cars (TTAC) wrote, [...] "Making the AWD Ridgeline more expensive to get into doesn’t sound like a recipe for greater marketplace success." [...] According to Honda's Public Relations Manager James Jenkins, Honda's streamlining of the 2018 Ridgeline lineup will “better suit the needs of midsize truck buyers.” [...] TTAC asks the question, [...] "...what’ll it do for midsize truck buyers who want an affordable Honda with all-wheel drive?" [...] According to Bloomberg Business and TTAC, pricing was considered a problem with the first-generation Ridgeline.

He {{explained}} that he and Wallace spent a lot of time with the episode's director, Karl Neilson, [...] "just going over stuff, finding out where the emotions were, who was the victim, who was on the offensive, who was on the defensive", where usually there are no rehearsals. Richie also revealed that the bedsit set was a [...] "tiny space" [...] that was purposely built for the episodes, which Richie said was [...] "quite claustrophobic". He called it a [...] "square room [...] nowhere to hide", with [...] "every blink of the eye, every look, every frown, every sigh" [...] being seen, adding [...] "if you're looking angry, it's there to be seen, you're naked to it". He said he [...] "loved" [...] that about filming the episode, and said, [...] "you work hard to try and be as good an actor as you can and then you're given an opportunity by the BBC and by EastEnders <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mark. Lorraine [...] believing that two actors could do that—it's a bit of a pressure on your shoulders, but me and Jessie loved it."
