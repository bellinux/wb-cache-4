5|$|Digital {{radio in}} the United Kingdom is being {{promoted}} by radio stations and the broadcasting industry on the premise <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>provides</b> superior quality sound over AM, a wider choice of radio stations, is easier to use, and is resistant to the interference which other broadcast media are susceptible to. On the other hand critics say that coverage is not yet sufficient and the quality can be {{less than that of}} FM.|$|E

Shetland's location means <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>provides</b> a number of such records: Muness is the most northerly castle in the United Kingdom and Skaw the most northerly settlement.|$|E
5|$|Wallace (1973) {{addressed}} {{a number of}} criticisms of the committee including <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>provides</b> too little information on the reasons for rarity rejection. Alan Vittery and Sara McMahon have both argued that the committee should inform observers whose records are rejected of the committee's reasons for doing so. This view also {{has the support of}} the editor of Birdwatch, Dominic Mitchell, who has made this the topic of editorials on a number of occasions.|$|E

5|$|One {{reason for}} the {{popularity}} of the local protein synthesis hypothesis is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>provides</b> a possible mechanism for the specificity associated with LTP. Specifically, if indeed local protein synthesis underlies L-LTP, only dendritic spines receiving LTP-inducing stimuli will undergo LTP; the potentiation will not be propagated to adjacent synapses. By contrast, global protein synthesis that occurs in the cell body requires that proteins be shipped out to every area of the cell, including synapses that have not received LTP-inducing stimuli. Whereas local protein synthesis provides a mechanism for specificity, global protein synthesis would seem to directly compromise it. However, as discussed later, the synaptic tagging hypothesis successfully reconciles global protein synthesis, synapse specificity, and associativity.|$|E
5|$|Stossel {{has criticized}} {{government}} programs for being inefficient, wasteful, and harmful. He has also criticized the American legal system, opining <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>provides</b> lawyers and vexatious litigators {{the incentive to}} file frivolous lawsuits indiscriminately. Stossel contends that these suits often generate more wealth for lawyers than for deserving clients, stifle innovation and personal freedoms, and cause harm to private citizens, taxpayers, consumers and businesses. Although Stossel concedes that some lawsuits are {{necessary in order to}} provide justice to people genuinely injured by others with greater economic power, he advocates the adoption in the U.S. of the English rule as one method to reduce the more abusive or frivolous lawsuits.|$|E
5|$|The {{essence of}} network {{synthesis}} {{is to start}} with a required filter response and produce a network that delivers that response, or approximates to it within a specified boundary. This is the inverse of network analysis which starts with a given network and by applying the various electric circuit theorems predicts the response of the network. The term was first used with this meaning in the doctoral thesis of Yuk-Wing Lee (1930) and apparently arose out of a conversation with Vannevar Bush. The advantage of network synthesis over previous methods is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>provides</b> a solution which precisely meets the design specification. This is not the case with image filters, a degree of experience is required in their design since the image filter only meets the design specification in the unrealistic case of being terminated in its own image impedance, to produce which would require the exact circuit being sought. Network synthesis on the other hand, takes care of the termination impedances simply by incorporating them into the network being designed.|$|E

25|$|Economists {{disagree}} on whether Sraffa's work refutes neoclassical economics. Many post-Keynesian economists use Sraffa's critique as justification for abandoning neoclassical analysis and exploring other models of economic behavior. Others see {{his work as}} compatible with neoclassical economics, as developed in modern general equilibrium models, or as unable to determine a long-period position, just like the Walrasian approach. Others still argue {{that the importance of}} Sraffa's economics is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>provides</b> a new framing for how we understand capitalist economies that does not fall back on the arguably unrealistic assumptions of neoclassical economics.|$|E
25|$|A 2010 {{study found}} that caste {{discrimination}} occurs in Britain at work and in service provision. While not ruling {{out the possibility of}} discrimination in education, no such incidents were uncovered. The report found favourable results from educational activities. However, non-legislative approaches were claimed to be less effective in the workplace and would not help when the authorities were discriminating. One criticism of discrimination law was the difficulty in obtaining proof of violations. Perceived benefits of legislation were <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>provides</b> redress, leads to greater understanding and reduces the social acceptance of such discrimination.|$|E
