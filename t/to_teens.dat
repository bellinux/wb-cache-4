500|$|A {{lawsuit was}} brought against the band in 1996, {{by the parents}} of Elyse Pahler, who accused the band of {{encouraging}} their daughter's murderers through their lyrics.

The case was unsealed by the court on May 19, 2000, stating Slayer and related business markets distribute harmful products <b>to</b> <b>teens,</b> encouraging violent acts through their lyrics, and [...] "none of the vicious crimes committed against Elyse Marie Pahler would have occurred without the intentional marketing strategy of the death-metal band Slayer." [...] The lawsuit was dismissed in 2001, for multiple reasons including [...] "principles of free speech, lack of a duty and lack of foreseeability." [...] A second lawsuit was filed by the parents, an amended complaint for damages against Slayer, their label, and other industry and label entities. The lawsuit was again dismissed. Judge E. Jeffrey Burke stated, [...] "I do not consider Slayer's music obscene, indecent or harmful to minors." ...|$|E
500|$|SpongeBob SquarePants has {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics, {{and it has}} been noted for its appeal towards different age groups. James Poniewozik of Time magazine described the title character as [...] "the anti-Bart Simpson, temperamentally and physically: his head is as squared-off and neat as Bart's is unruly, and he has a personality to match—conscientious, optimistic and blind to the faults in the world and those around him". According to Laura Fries of Variety magazine, the series is [...] "a thoughtful and inventive cartoon about a hopelessly optimistic and resilient sea sponge ... Devoid of the double entendres rife in today's animated TV shows, this is purely kid's stuff ... However, that's not to say that SpongeBob is simplistic or even juvenile. It's charming and whimsical, but clever enough to appeal <b>to</b> <b>teens</b> and college-aged kids, as well". The New York Times critic Joyce Millman said SpongeBob [...] "is clever without being impenetrable to young viewers and goofy without boring grown-ups to tears. It's the most charming toon on television, and one of the weirdest. And it's also good, clean fun, which makes sense because it is, after all, about a sponge". Millman wrote, [...] "His relentless good cheer would be irritating if he weren't so darned lovable and his world so excellently strange ... Like Pee-wee's Playhouse, SpongeBob joyfully dances on the fine line between childhood and adulthood, guilelessness and camp, the warped and the sweet".|$|E

40|$|This {{study used}} {{data from the}} Aboriginal Children’s Survey (ACS) to explore {{differences}} in behavioural outcomes for First Nations children born <b>to</b> <b>teen</b> and older mothers living off-reserve in Canada. Of particular interest was an examination of socio-economic and contextual influences, and their contributions to differences in child outcomes. Findings from this study demonstrate that off-reserve First Nations children born <b>to</b> <b>teen</b> mothers (aged 12 - 19 years when they started childbearing) had poorer behavioural outcomes compared to off-reserve First Nations children born to older mothers (aged 25 and over when they started childbearing). These differences were found for emotional symptoms, inattention and hyperactivity, and conduct disorder scores, but not for prosocial behaviours. Contextual factors differed for children born <b>to</b> <b>teen</b> mothers as compared to older mothers, but parenting behaviors {{and the number of}} people involved in raising the child was similar for both groups. While differences in the behaviour of children born <b>to</b> <b>teen</b> mothers are often attributed to poorer socio-economic conditions, this study demonstrates that other contextual factors (e. g., breastfeeding, social support, screen time, residential mobility) may be as important as socio-economic factors in their contribution to the behavioural outcomes of children of teen mothers...|$|R

2500|$|The {{number of}} people {{receiving}} a {{high school and college}} education increased dramatically from 1920 to 1960. Because very few jobs were available <b>to</b> <b>teens</b> coming out of eighth grade, there was an increase in high school attendance in the 1930s. The progressive movement in the United State took off at this time and led to the idea of progressive education. John Flanagan, an educational psychologist, developed tests for combat trainees and instructions in combat training. [...] In 1954 the work of Kenneth Clark and his wife on the effects of segregation on black and white children was influential in the Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education. From the 1960s to present day, educational psychology has switched from a behaviorist perspective to a more cognitive based perspective because of the influence and development of cognitive psychology at this time.|$|E

Susan Frances at AbsolutePunk.net rates the musicianship and production higher than Blasko's vocals, where [...] " [...] is made up to sound more impressive than she actually is on the album ... a limited range so the tunes have a mundane drone. Her vocal melodies transform the girl next door to a femme fatale figure which may explain why so many of those radiant reviews for her album come from male writers". Frances summarises the album as [...] "pleasant and relates to people who are going through a loss or a low point in their lives ... tailored for those going through woeful moods".|$|E
