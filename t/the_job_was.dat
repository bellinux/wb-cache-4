40|$|Grid {{computing}} {{is a form}} of {{distributed computing}} that involves coordinating and sharing data storage and network resource.

The complexity of scheduling problem increases with heterogeneous nature of grid and is highly difficult to schedule effectively. Existing algorithm does not adapt to the dynamic grid environment. In order to utilize the power of grid completely and to assign <b>job</b> to <b>the</b> resource dynamically an efficient algorithm called Adaptive Scoring <b>Job</b> Scheduling (ASJS) <b>was</b> introduced.

This involved controversial decisions, such as hiring in 1951 the Chinese biochemist Tien-chin Tsao and the Hungarian-born economist Peter Bauer. In {{what became known as the}} Peasants' Revolt, fellows led by Patrick Hadley voted an old friend of Chadwick's off the council and replaced him with Bauer.

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1925, Waugh's outlook briefly improved, with the {{prospect}} of a job in Pisa, Italy, as secretary to the Scottish writer Charles Kenneth Scott Moncrieff, who was engaged on the English translations of Marcel Proust's works.

Acton's reply was so coolly dismissive that Waugh immediately burnt his manuscript; shortly afterwards, before he left North Wales, he learned that the Moncrieff job had fallen through. The twin blows were sufficient for him to consider suicide. He records that he went down to a nearby beach and, leaving a note with his clothes, walked out to sea. An attack by jellyfish changed his mind, and he returned quickly to the shore.|$|E
