5000|$|Although {{plans were}} not finalized, the third battlecruiser, [...] "Q", was ordered from Germaniawerft in Kiel on 8 August 1939. One month after, the {{contract}} design was refined. The displacement was increased to 31652 t (design) and 35945 t (full-load), while the draft at those two figures was 8 m and 8.8 m, respectively. At the waterline, the length {{was set at}} 246 m and beam at 30 m. The main battery {{was the same as}} previously (six 380 mm/47 caliber guns in dual turrets), while the secondary battery was split between six paired 150 mm/48 caliber anti-surface guns and paired 105 mm/65 caliber anti-aircraft guns because German designers {{had not been able to}} develop a satisfactory dual-purpose gun. Light anti-aircraft guns were eight 37 mm in four dual mounts and twenty 20 mm autocannon in single mounts. Twelve 533 mm torpedo tubes finished out the armament aboard the ships. Four floatplanes for scouting were planned. At the design displacement, the maximum speed was reduced by half a knot, to 33.5 kn; this required a <b>top</b> <b>shaft</b> horsepower of 173,600.|$|E
40|$|Gas foil {{bearings}} (GFB) {{appear to}} satisfy most requirements for oil-free turbomachinery, i. e. relatively simple in construction, ensuring low drag friction and reliable high speed operation. However, GFBs {{have a limited}} load capacity and minimal amounts of damping. A test rig for the rotordynamic evaluation of gas foil bearings was constructed. A DC router motor, 25 krpm max speed, drives a 1. 02 kg hollow rotor supported on two bump-type foil gas bearings (L = D = 38. 10 mm). Measurements of the test rotor dynamic response were conducted for increasing mass imbalance conditions. Typical waterfalls of rotor coast down response from 25 krpm to rest evidence the onset and disappearance of severe subsynchronous motions with whirl frequencies at ~ 50 % of rotor speed, roughly coinciding with the (rigid mode) natural frequencies of the rotor-bearing system. The amplitudes of motion, synchronous and subsynchronous, increase (non) linearly {{with respect to the}} imbalance displacements. The rotor motions are rather large; yet, the foil bearings, by virtue of their inherent flexibility, prevented the catastrophic failure of the test rotor. Tests at the <b>top</b> <b>shaft</b> speed, 25 krpm, did not excite subsynchronous motions. In the experiments, the subsynchronous motion speed range is well confined to shaft speeds ranging from 22 krpm to 12 krpm. The experimental results show the severity of subsynchronous motions is related to the amount of imbalance in the rotor. Surprisingly enough, external air pressurization {{on one side of the}} foil bearings acted to reduce the amplitudes of motion while the rotor crossed its critical speeds. An air-film hovering effect may have enhanced the sliding of the bumps thus increasing the bearings?? damping action. The tests also demonstrate that increasing the gas feed pressure ameliorates the amplitudes of subsynchronous motions due to the axial flow retarding the circumferential flow velocity development. A finite element rotordynamic analysis models the test rotor and uses predicted bearing force coefficients from the static equilibrium GFB load analysis. The rotordynamic analysis predicts critical speeds at ~ 8 krpm and ~ 9 krpm, which correlate well with test critical speeds. Predictions of rotordynamic stability are calculated for the test speed range (0 to 25 krpm), showing unstable operation for the rotor/bearing system starting at 12 krpm and higher. Predictions and experimental results show good agreement in terms of critical speed correlation, and moderate displacement amplitude discrepancies for some imbalance conditions. Post-test inspection of the rotor evidenced sustained wear at the locations in contact with the bearings' axial edges. However, the foil bearings are almost in pristine condition; except for top foil coating wear at the bearing edges and along the direction of applied static load...|$|E

50|$|The {{shaft of}} a fashion boot can be fitted (i.e. {{following}} {{the curve of}} the wearer’s calf), straight-legged, or loose-fitting (or “slouchy”). In close-fitting boots, flexibility is achieved by the use of gussets; slits in the material either at the <b>top</b> of the <b>shaft</b> (in knee-length boots), or wider panels at the sides of the shaft (in ankle boots), which are backed with elasticized fabric. Compression folds around the ankle allow for movement of the foot. In over-the-knee boots, flexion of the knee is usually attained by a vent {{at the back of the}} boot, running from the <b>top</b> of the <b>shaft</b> to the back of the knee. This may be closed with laces, elasticized, or left open. Where a vent is not used, freedom of movement is achieved either by having the <b>top</b> of the <b>shaft</b> flare outwards above the knee, or making all or part of the shaft out of a stretchable material.|$|R
