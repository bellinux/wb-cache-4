In the Pressed Steel Lorry range there were delivery vans, petrol tankers, breakdown lorries, different types of articulated lorries, rocket launchers, car transporters, circus lorries, mobile shops, Army, RAF and emergency vehicles.

Houses in fishing villages along coastal areas were damaged in Batu Ferringhi and Balik Pulau in Penang. Coastal areas in Peninsular Malaysia e.g. 13 villages in Kuala Muda, Kedah and Kuala <b>Triang</b> in Langkawi island were also affected. About a quarter of holiday vessels anchored in Rebak and Telaga harbour in Langkawi were also damaged. The waves sent parked motorcycles crashing and cars washed with mud at stretches along Gurney Drive in George Town, Penang.

40|$|A {{method of}} {{unstructured}} tetrahedral-mesh generation for general three-dimensional domains is presented. Aconventional boundary representation is adopted {{as the basis}} for the description of solids with evolving geometry and topology. The geometry of surfaces is represented either analytically of by piecewise polynomial interpolation. A preliminary surface mesh is generated by an advancing front method, with the nodes inserted by hard-sphere packing in physical space in accordance with a prescribed mesh density. Interior nodes are inserted in a face-centered-cubic (FCC) crystal lattice arrangement coupled to octree spatial subdivision, with the local lattice parameter determined by a prespecified nodal density function. Prior to triangulation of the volume, the preliminary surface mesh is preprocessed by a combination of local transformations and subdivision in order to guarantee that the surface triangulation be a subcomplex of the volume Delaunay triangulation.

40|$|Given a planar triangulation, {{the goal}} is to select {{elevations}} at its vertices so that resulting piecewise-linear triangulated surface approximates specified elevations using the L 1 -norm as the primary measure-of-fit. Several suboptimal algorithms relating to that problem have been devised and implemented, and are described here, as part of TIN prototype software for terrain modeling in the context of distributed simulation as well as elevation data editing. L 1 -approximation acts as a median filter and thus provides advantages for "bare earth" representation. For added flexibility, a "sign-oriented scaling" scheme has been developed, which generalizes standard norm-based measures-of-fit. L 1 -approximation is either tackled directly or by iterating suitably weighted L 2 - approximations. Numerical experiments are reported.
