40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to numerically {{investigate}} one source of acoustic noise in roller bearings, that which results from the motion <b>of</b> the <b>rollers</b> in the bearing under zero exter-nal load. For the sake of simplification, it was assumed that the cylindrical roller bearings are infinitely long. Furthermore, the effects of the following on the noise of the bearing were also examined: the radial clearance of the bearing, the viscosity of the lubricant, and the number <b>of</b> <b>rollers.</b> The results <b>of</b> the study show that the fundamental frequency of the noise components <b>of</b> the cylindrical <b>roller</b> bearing corresponds to the multiplica-tion of the number <b>of</b> <b>rollers</b> and the whirling frequency <b>of</b> the <b>roller</b> center. The acoustical frequency spectra <b>of</b> the cylindrical <b>roller</b> bearing are pure tone spectra, containing the fundamental frequency <b>of</b> the <b>roller</b> bearing and its superharmonics. The fac-tors that decrease the sound pressure level <b>of</b> a cylindrical <b>roller</b> bearing include low lubricant viscosity, high radial clearance, and a reduced number <b>of</b> <b>rollers.</b> The results and discussions of the present article could aid in the design <b>of</b> low-noise cylindrical <b>roller</b> bearings...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{finite element}} method is adopted to analyze the pre-loaded {{cylindrical}} roller bearings according {{to the theory of}} contact mechanics. The effects of hollow ratio on the radial stiffness of bearings, the maximum contact stress <b>of</b> <b>rollers,</b> and the maximum radial load of bearing are analyzed. The analysis results show that the smaller the hollowness is, the larger the radial stiffness <b>of</b> pre-loaded cylindrical <b>roller</b> bearings, the maximum contact stress <b>of</b> the <b>rollers,</b> and the maximum radial load of the bearing would be. Under different magnitude loads, the reasonable combination of interference magnitude with the hollowness can not only increase the stiffness <b>of</b> <b>roller</b> bearings, but also decrease the maximum stress <b>of</b> <b>rollers,</b> which provides a reference for the design and manufacture <b>of</b> pre-loaded cylindrical <b>roller</b> bearings...|$|R

The fatigue test result shows that roller working is more effective on improving the fatigue strength of the material than ion nitriding. On the other hand, the ion nitriding can much greatly increase the surface hardness than the roller working.
