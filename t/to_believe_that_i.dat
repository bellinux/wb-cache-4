25|$|As a {{young man}} {{growing up in a}} {{conservative}} church, it felt impossible to deal with issues around my own sexuality. It did not feel like a safe environment, and certainly not one in which I could have found support and understanding. So, I came <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had to ignore it and do what I thought was the right thing at the time: live a heterosexual life.|$|E
500|$|In August, del Potro won {{his third}} {{consecutive}} title at the Countrywide Classic in Los Angeles, beating Andy Roddick in straight sets in the final. After the match, Roddick praised his opponent. [...] " [...] hits {{this way and}} this way kind of equally and he can hit it from inside out and running to it, {{which is a good}} thing for him, bad for the rest of us". A fourth consecutive title followed a week later in the Legg Mason Tennis Classic in Washington, D.C., where he recorded a victory over Viktor Troicki, becoming the first player in ATP history to win his first four career titles in as many tournaments. [...] "I don't really understand what I did. It is difficult <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have won four consecutive titles", del Potro said, crediting coach Franco Davín for his impressive run. [...] "He changed my game. He changed my mind. He changed everything. When I play and I see him in the stands, it gives me confidence. I can play relaxed." ...|$|E
500|$|In late January 1567, Mary {{prompted}} {{her husband}} to return to Edinburgh. He recuperated from his illness in a house belonging to the brother of Sir James Balfour at the former abbey of Kirk o' Field, just within the city wall. Mary visited him daily, so that it appeared a reconciliation was in progress. On the night of 9–10 February 1567, Mary visited {{her husband in the}} early evening and then attended the wedding celebrations of a member of her household, Bastian Pagez. In {{the early hours of the}} morning, an explosion devastated Kirk o' Field, and Darnley was found dead in the garden, apparently smothered. There were no visible marks of strangulation or violence on the body. Bothwell, Moray, Secretary Maitland, the Earl of Morton and Mary herself were among those who came under suspicion. Elizabeth wrote to Mary of the rumours, [...] "I should ill fulfil the office of a faithful cousin or an affectionate friend if I did not... tell you what all the world is thinking. Men say that, instead of seizing the murderers, you are looking through your fingers while they escape; that you will not seek revenge on those who have done you so much pleasure, as though the deed would never have taken place had not the doers of it been assured of impunity. For myself, I beg you <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would not harbour such a thought." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 18 January 2011, Russian Premier League side Terek Grozny {{announced}} that Gullit {{has agreed to}} sign a year-and-a-half contract and become the head coach for the Chechen side. Upon signing, Gullit told Sovetsky Sport, [...] "I'd like <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can bring joy {{into the lives of}} the Chechen people through football...Of course, I won't deny that I'm getting lots of money from Terek." [...] Gullit was sacked by the club on 14 June 2011, having only won three games as manager. The club also said Gullit had a [...] "party lifestyle".|$|E
2500|$|By October 1924, Lawrence and Frieda {{left for}} Mexico {{and it was}} {{while they were in}} Oaxaca that he was {{diagnosed}} with tuberculosis. The couple returned to the US, and by April 1925 they were back at the Ranch where they spent the summer, Lawrence continuing work on the novel which became The Plumed Serpent. However, with his better health and their six-month visa about to expire, Lawrence was determined to return to Europe. They left Taos on September 11, Lawrence's 40th birthday, and settled in Italy. Although he never returned to New Mexico, in a letter to Brett in December 1929 from Bandol, France Lawrence expressed some interest in doing so: [...] "I really think that I shall try to come back in the spring. I begin <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shall never get well over here." ...|$|E

This is pure faith, and predicated on my redemption. So, therefore, I just stand strong and continue to tell you, your audience, and the world that I am innocent and, yes, I have been a wretched person, but I have redeemed myself. And I say to you and all those who can listen and will listen that redemption is tailor-made for the wretched, and that's what I used to be…That's what I would like the world to remember me. That's how I would like my legacy to be remembered as: a redemptive transition, something that I believe is not exclusive just for the so-called sanctimonious, the elitists. And it doesn't—is not predicated on color or race or social stratum or one's religious background. It's accessible for everybody. That's the beauty about it. And whether others choose <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have redeemed myself or not, I worry not, because I know and God knows, and you can believe that all of the youths that I continue to help, they know, too. So with that, I am grateful…I say to you and everyone else, God bless. So take care." ...|$|E
