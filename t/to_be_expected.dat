5|$|Category4 hurricanes tend {{to produce}} more {{extensive}} curtainwall failures, with some complete structural failure on small residences. Heavy, irreparable damage and near complete destruction of gas station canopies and other wide span overhang type structures are common. Mobile and manufactured homes are often flattened. Most trees, except for the heartiest, are uprooted or snapped, isolating many areas. These storms cause extensive beach erosion, while terrain may be flooded far inland. Total and long-lived electrical and water losses are <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected,</b> possibly for many weeks.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the example}} of Mozambique, the Zambian and Botswana governments {{permitted}} guerrillas to establish bases from which they could threaten and infiltrate Rhodesia.

5|$|The {{equivalence}} between gravitational and {{inertial effects}} {{does not constitute}} a complete theory of gravity. When it comes to explaining gravity near our own location on the Earth's surface, noting that our reference frame is not in free fall, so that fictitious forces are <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected,</b> provides a suitable explanation. But a freely falling reference frame {{on one side of}} the Earth cannot explain why the people on the opposite side of the Earth experience a gravitational pull in the opposite direction.|$|E

5|$|The storm's {{flooding}} causes major {{damage to}} the lower floors of all structures near the shoreline, and many coastal structures can be completely flattened or washed away by the storm surge. Virtually all trees are uprooted or snapped and some may be debarked, isolating most affected communities. Massive evacuation of residential areas may be required if the hurricane threatens populated areas. Total and extremely long-lived power outages and water losses are <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected,</b> possibly for up to several months.|$|E
5|$|There are {{questions}} about the external validity of the AS diagnosis. That is, {{it is unclear whether}} there is a practical benefit in distinguishing AS from HFA and from PDD-NOS; the same child can receive different diagnoses depending on the screening tool. The debate about distinguishing AS from HFA is partly due to a tautological dilemma where disorders are defined based on severity of impairment, so that studies that appear to confirm differences based on severity are <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected.</b>|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Garfield {{administration}} assumed office in 1881, the Navy's condition had deteriorated still further. A review conducted {{on behalf of the}} new Secretary of the Navy, William H. Hunt, found that of 140 vessels on the Navy's active list, only 52 were in an operational state, of which a mere 17 were iron-hulled ships, including 14 aging Civil War era ironclads. Hunt recognized the necessity of modernizing the Navy, and set up an informal advisory board to make recommendations. Also <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected,</b> morale was considerably down; officers and sailors in foreign ports were all too aware that their old wooden ships would not survive long in the event of war. The limitations of the monitor type effectively prevented the United States from projecting power overseas, and until the 1890s the United States would have come off badly in a conflict with even Spain or the Latin American powers.|$|E

5|$|DJ Hero 2 {{was officially}} {{announced}} in June 2010 for release {{in the last}} quarter of 2010. Prior to the game's announcement, Activision revealed a month before the game's release that it is actively seeking artists for downloadable content and a sequel to the game. David Guetta has stated that he was set to work on the game's sequel, to arrive late in 2010. Activision CEO Bobby Kotick stated that despite low sales of DJ Hero, they are committed to continuing the series, with the sequel due in 2010. The sequel, DJ Hero 2, was further confirmed during an Activision investors report for 2009, citing it as one of only 2 major Guitar Hero titles <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> from Activision in 2010, with an expected late-2010 release date.|$|E
5|$|In {{most current}} cultures, {{it is more}} typical for women to wear long hair than for men to do so. An American study shows {{significant}} correlation between hair length and age, which indicates that younger women tend to have longer hair than older women. A significant correlation was also found between women's hair length and hair quality. Moreover, hair quality was correlated with the women's perceived physical health. Consistent with principles of evolutionary psychology, {{these results indicate that}} hair length and quality can act as a cue to a woman's youth and health, signifying reproductive potential. The correlation between the woman's hair length and marital status, or number of children, was however not more than <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> from the correlation between hair length and age.|$|E
5|$|Modern writers {{all agree}} that Andrée's North Pole scheme was unrealistic. He relied on the winds blowing {{more or less in}} the {{direction}} he wanted to go, on being able to fine-tune his direction with the drag ropes, on the balloon being sealed tight enough to stay airborne for 30 days, and on no ice or snow sticking to the balloon to weigh it down. In the attempt of 1896, the wind immediately refuted his optimism by blowing steadily from the north, straight at the balloon hangar at Danes Island, until the expedition had to pack up, let the hydrogen out of the balloon, and go home. It is now known that northerly winds are <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> at Danes Island; but in the late 19th century, information on Arctic airflow and precipitation existed only as contested academic hypotheses. Even Ekholm, an Arctic climate researcher, had no objection to Andrée's theory of where the wind was likely to take them. The observational data simply did not exist.|$|E

5|$|The National Academy of Sciences {{questioned}} Neel's procedure {{which did}} not filter the Kure population for possible radiation exposure. Overall, while a statistically insignificant increase in birth defects occurred directly after the bombings of Nagasaki and Hiroshima, Neel and others noted that in approximately 50 humans who were of an early gestational age {{at the time of}} the bombing and who were all within about 1km from the hypocenter, an increase in microencephaly and anencephaly was observed upon birth, with the incidence of these two particular malformations being nearly 3 times what was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> when compared to the control group in Kure.|$|E
5|$|The {{companion}} {{which is}} supposed to have spun-up PSR B1937+21 is no longer present, making it one of few millisecond pulsars which does not have a stellar mass companion. The generally high occurrence of companions to millisecond pulsars is <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected,</b> considering a companion is necessary to spin-up millisecond pulsars to their short periods. However, millisecond pulsars do not actively accrete matter from a companion, but instead need to have only done this at some time in the past, and thus the lack of companion for PSR B1937+21 is not seen as a being in disagreement with the spin-up model. Possible mechanisms for creating isolated millisecond pulsars include evaporation of the donor star or tidal disruption of the system.|$|E

5|$|The {{two heads}} at Tres Zapotes, with the La Cobata head, are stylistically {{distinct}} from the other known examples. Beatriz de la Fuente views them as a late regional survival of an older tradition while other scholars argue that they are merely the kind of regional variant <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> in a frontier settlement. These heads are sculpted with relatively simple headdresses; they have squat, wide proportions and distinctive facial features. The two Tres Zapotes heads are the earliest known stone monuments from the site. The discovery {{of one of the}} Tres Zapotes heads in the nineteenth century led to the first archaeological investigations of Olmec culture, carried out by Matthew Stirling in 1938.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they all}} share the forest, {{relationships}} between different Clans are tense. They often come {{into conflict with}} one another, becoming aggressive if a cat from a neighboring Clan accidentally crosses a border. This rivalry can increase in times of deprivation, such as if one Clan is suffering from a shortage of prey but another is thriving. An attempt for one Clan to steal all of or part of another Clan's territory is not unusual. To prepare for this, cats in all Clans are taught battle moves {{in order to protect}} their territory. Each Clan has signature battle moves that are taught to them from an early age (6 months/moons old). Border fights are the most common source of battle (a cat intentionally or unwittingly steps into another Clan's territory), and are often short-lived and cause no real damage to either side. However, bigger and more brutal battles can occur; at this point, casualties are <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected.</b> Despite this rivalry, the Clans can also show concern for another's well being; the idea of one Clan being destroyed causes deep distress, and will prompt urgent action on behalf of all four Clans. On the night of every full moon, the Clans will meet at a designated spot in order to share stories and news in peace. This is known as a 'Gathering', and is the only time in which fighting is prohibited.|$|E
5|$|On 8 June, {{a letter}} arrived from William Tayler, the {{commissioner}} of Patna district, warning that an outbreak of mutiny from the Bengal Native Infantry units in Dinapore was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected.</b> The European population in Arrah spent {{that night at the}} house of Arthur Littledale, a judge working in Arrah, and during the night it was decided that the European women and children were to be sent by boat to Dinapore, escorted by armed members of the European male population, where they would be taken into the care of the 10th Regiment of Foot—this decision was acted upon on the 9th. The following morning a meeting was held at the house of Herwald Wake, the magistrate of Shahabad district, to discuss what to do next. The East India Company civil servants stated that they did not intend to abandon the town and they would remain. All but two of the remaining European male residents of Arrah who were not civil servants or Government employees decided to leave for the relative safety of Dinapore by boat or on horseback and did so the same day. This reduced the European male population of Arrah to eight, rising to sixteen {{over the next few weeks}} as men arrived in the town from the surrounding district. The defence of the town was augmented on 11 June when a party arrived consisting of 50 sepoys and 6 sowars from the Bengal Military Police Battalion, known as Rattray's Sikhs (now the 3rd Battalion of the Sikh Regiment, Indian Army), under the command of Jemadar Hooken Singh. The party had been sent from Dinapore, part of a larger detachment under their commander Captain Rattray whose presence in the area had been personally requested by Tayler, and placed under the direct command of Wake.|$|E

5|$|On April 7, in {{the face}} of a battle for NCAA {{reinstatement}} that saw him miss the last 8 games of the season, Alexander declared for the June 25, 2015 NBA draft. On May 31, Alexander suffered a right knee injury in draft workout with the Los Angeles Lakers. After going undrafted, Alexander joined the Brooklyn Nets for the 2015 NBA Summer League. He averaged 6.7 rebounds, 0.3 assists, and 1.5 blocks in 22 minutes per game in the Summer League. On July 24, 2015, Alexander signed with the Portland Trail Blazers. By the beginning of training camp, Alexander's injury caused him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> to miss two weeks. He was one of five non-guaranteed contract players vying for three roster spots. Alexander missed the entire preseason with the Trail Blazers due to his knee but made the roster and entered the season behind Meyers Leonard, Mason Plumlee, Ed Davis, Noah Vonleh, and Al-Farouq Aminu on the depth chart. Despite minor torn cartilage issues, Alexander was active for the first time on November 8 in Portland's seventh game of the season. Alexander played 17 minutes on November 15, posting 4 points, 4 rebounds and a block against Charlotte.|$|E
5|$|Parker's injury {{extended}} into {{the beginning of}} the 2015–16 NBA season. He returned to action on November 4 against the Philadelphia 76ers in the fifth game of the season for the Bucks but struggled, posting just two points in 16 minutes as a starter. As he ramped up his activity, he was rested on the second of back-to-back games. Nonetheless, after five games, he endured a sprain in his talonavicular joint in the right mid-foot causing him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> to miss several games. He only missed one game. The following week, he began to come off the bench while O. J. Mayo took his starting spot. On December 12, Parker had a 19-point, 7-rebound, 2-steal performance against the Golden State Warriors to help end their 24-game win streak. On January 27, 2016, he was named to the 2016 NBA All-Star Game weekend Rising Stars Challenge lineup. On February 19, he tied his career high with 23 points in a loss to the Charlotte Hornets. He surpassed that total the following night, recording career highs of 28 points and 13 rebounds in a 117–109 double-overtime win over the Atlanta Hawks. On February 29, Parker set a new career high with 36 points in a 128–121 Bucks victory over the Houston Rockets.|$|E
5|$|The 48th Battalion {{returned}} to its former positions on the railway embankment {{on the night of}} 3 April, in their absence the line had been subjected to two more German attacks which had been beaten off fairly easily. On this occasion, despite his usual reticence to congest his forward positions with troops, Leane asked for permission to use two companies forward on the railway embankment, and another forward in a series of posts on the extreme left of the battalion sector. These posts were on either side of a gully just south of the Albert–Amiens road. He held his fourth company in a trench called Pioneer Trench, that had been dug on the high ground overlooking the embankment. He was also given a company of the 46th Battalion which he held in reserve near his headquarters. On 4 April, the commander of the 4th Division, Major General Ewen Sinclair-Maclagan decided the main line of defence would be the railway embankment, rather than the high ground behind it. While this did not change the dispositions of the 48th Battalion, it caused Gellibrand to issue an order that the embankment must be held at all costs, which had significant consequences for the coming battle. On the same day, word was received that a German attack was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> the next morning.|$|E
