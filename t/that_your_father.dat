[...] In 1941â€“42, while travelling for CEMA in Devon and Cornwall, she was invited by the Elmhirsts to make her base at Dartington. In the summer of 1942, while recuperating there, she was persuaded by Christopher Martin, the centre's administrator, to resign her CEMA role and work at Dartington. He had in mind a music course, [...] "the sort of thing <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>father</b> did {{in the old days}} at Morley College". Beginning in 1943, Imogen established [...] a one-year [...] course, initially designed to train young women to organise amateur orchestras and musical events in rural communities. Gradually it developed into a more general musical education for a broader student intake. Under Imogen's leadership the course quickly became the hub of a range of musical activities, including the foundation of an amateur orchestra: [...] "Hardly any of us could play... However bad we were, we went on". Imogen's teaching methods, heavily based on [...] "learning by doing" [...] and without formal examinations, at first disconcerted her students and puzzled the school inspectors, but eventually gained acceptance and respect. Rosamond Strode, a pupil at Dartington who later worked with Imogen at Aldeburgh, said of her approach: [...] "She knew exactly how, and when, to push her victims in at the deep end, and she knew, also, that although they would flounder and splash about at first, it wouldn't be long before... they would be swimming easily while she beamed approval from the bank".|$|E

[...] (NIV) [...] "Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift {{there in front of}} the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother; then come and offer your gift." [...] (NIV) [...] "And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive him, so <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>Father</b> in heaven may forgive you your sins." [...] Mark 11:25 (NIV)* [...] "But I tell you who hear me: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you. If someone strikes you on one cheek, turn to him the other also." [...] Luke 6:27-29 (NIV) [...] "Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful." [...] Luke 6:36 (NIV) [...] "Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven." [...] Luke 6:37 (NIV) ...|$|E
