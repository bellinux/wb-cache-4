40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{one part}} of postmillennialist eschatology which claims that <b>the</b> kingdom <b>of</b> God before Christ’s second coming will be victorious in transforming every aspect of all societies of this world. Evil will not be completely destroyed, but Christian values and principles will be predominant. Some critics of postmillennialism think that support for such a view can only be found in <b>the</b> <b>parables</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mustard seed and the leaven. Therefore, this article explores <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> <b>parables</b> and <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> their interpretation, and briefly analyzes <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kingdom {{in an attempt to}} show <b>the</b> difference in interpretation <b>of</b> <b>parables</b> as allegories, metaphors and similes. The author’s position is that <b>the</b> <b>parables</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mustard seed and the leaven are similes, and though they explicitly compare two elements (kingdom with the seed and kingdom with the leaven), the key to their correct interpretation is to realize that each parable as a whole reveals something about <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kingdom and not just one point of identification or some detail...|$|R
25|$|In addition, some Christian {{authors have}} argued that this typological {{interpretation}} finds its origin in the speech of Saint Stephen in Acts , {{as well as the}} Gospel of Luke and the parables of Jesus, noting strong verbal and conceptual collocation between the Greek translation of the portion of Genesis concerning Joseph and <b>the</b> <b>Parable</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wicked Tenants and <b>the</b> <b>Parable</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Prodigal Son.|$|E

40|$|This article {{proposes a}} {{methodology}} for interpreting <b>the</b> <b>parables</b> <b>of</b> Jesus. <b>The</b> methodology put forward has as starting point two convictions. Firstly, {{the difference between}} <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> Jesus’ <b>parables</b> as told by Jesus the Galilean in 30 CE and <b>the</b> literary context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parables</b> in <b>the</b> gospels {{has to be taken}} seriously. Secondly, an effort has to be made to at least try to avoid <b>the</b> fallacies <b>of</b> ethnocentrism and anachronism when interpreting <b>the</b> <b>parables.</b> In an effort to achieve this goal it is argued that social-scientific criticism presents itself as <b>the</b> obvious line <b>of</b> approach. Operating from these two convictions, the method being proposed is explained by using 12 statements (or theses) which are discussed as concisely and comprehensively as possible. It is inter alia argued that <b>the</b> central theme <b>of</b> Jesus’ <b>parables</b> was <b>the</b> non-apocalyptic kingdom <b>of</b> God, that <b>the</b> <b>parables</b> are atypical stories (comparisons), and that <b>the</b> <b>parables</b> depict Jesus as a social prophet.

Upon review, I find that all <b>the</b> essential elements <b>of</b> each <b>of</b> these <b>parables</b> were available for synthesis by Matthew from Mark, from Matthew 2 ̆ 7 s own prior text, or from prominent Old Testament selections, notably Genesis 18 - 21.

40|$|In <b>the</b> <b>parables</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{workers in}} <b>the</b> {{vineyard}} and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lost son, Jesus shows {{the relationship between}} goodness/forgiveness and justice. The protagonists of the two parables: <b>the</b> workers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first hour {{as well as the}} elder son were expecting justice, while the vineyard owner and <b>the</b> father <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lost son showed goodness which rises above justice. This attitude triggers off “evil eye” of those whose sense of justice is disturbed. Whilst the Old Testament assumed the “eye for eye” rule as the fundamental social strategy, Jesus changes into <b>the</b> strategy <b>of</b> “do to others as you would have them do to you”. History shows that justice which is not counterbalanced by goodness, mercy, and forgiveness may deform into revenge, retaliation, vengeance.

30|$|Originating from a Christian concept, Ricoeur elaborates his hermeneutical concept by exemplarily {{referring}} to <b>the</b> narratives <b>of</b> Jesus in <b>the</b> Synoptic Gospels. <b>The</b> Jesus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Synoptic Gospels makes {{extensive use of}} metaphoric language, here. Instead of formulating plain statements about God, the world, or <b>the</b> duties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Faithful, the synoptic Jesus is rather telling parables, e.g. about God as the merciful father, <b>the</b> Kingdom <b>of</b> God as a winery, whose owner compensates his workers graciously, the prodigal son etc. Similar narrative traditions {{can be found in}} many other religious and spiritual traditions globally. According to Ricoeur, these spiritual narratives possess their own persuasive power, which differs substantially from mere descriptive statements. They disclose potentials for a renewed interpretation and appropriation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> situation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reader - similar to a poem, a short story or even a witty joke. Like other forms of metaphorical language and narratives, <b>the</b> <b>parables</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Christian Gospel express a meaning, which can always become a source of inspiration for a renewed and emancipative practice.|$|R
