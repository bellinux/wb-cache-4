5|$|Tono, {{a fan of}} {{traditional}} kroncong music, is asked to judge a singing competition at Gambir Market. While there, he discovers that Yah is also his favourite singer, who sings under the pseudonym Siti Hayati. At Gambir, he also meets with his old friend Hartono, a political activist with the political party Partindo, who enquires about Tini. On a later date, Hartono visits Tono's home and meets Tini. It is revealed that Tini was romantically involved with Hartono while the <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> in university, where Tini surrendered her virginity to him; this action, unacceptable in traditional culture, made her disgusted with herself and unable to love. Hartono had made the situation worse by breaking off their relationship through a letter. When Hartono asks her to take him back, Tini refuses.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{surviving}} Early Middle Ages sources, {{there are six}} that mention Helmichis by name. Of these, the only contemporary one is the Chronica of Marius of Avenches, written in the 580s. Marius was bishop of Aventicum, a town located in the western Alps in the Frankish Kingdom of Burgundy. Because of the small distance from Aventicum to the Italian peninsula, the chronicler had easy access to information regarding northern Italy. For this reason, historian Roger Collins considers the Chronica, though short, to be reliable on Italian matters. The remaining sources all come from Italy and were written in later centuries. <b>Two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> written in the 7th century, the Continuatio Havniensis Prosperi and the Origo Gentis Langobardorum, both anonymous. The Continuatio is a chronicle written around 625 that has reached us in a single manuscript. As its name suggests, it {{is a continuation of}} the 5th century chronicle of Prosper of Aquitaine. Derived in considerable measure from the Chronica Majora of Isidore of Seville, it blames the Romans for their inability to defend Italy from foreign invaders, and praises the Lombards for defending the country from the Franks. This is the earliest surviving work to name Rosamund, the queen of the Lombards who plays a central role in Helmichis' attested biography. The other 7th century work, the Origo, is a brief prose history of the Lombards that is essentially an annotated king list, although it begins with a description of the founding myth of the Lombard nation. Giorgio Ausenda believes that the Origo was written around 643 as a prologue to the Edictum Rothari, and continued to be updated till 671. According to Walter Pohl, the author's motives are mostly political: the Origo serves to consolidate the Lombards' national identity by emphasising a shared history. Apart from the origin myth, the only more detailed account is the one concerning the death of Alboin, and thus Helmichis.|$|E
5|$|In August 2017, despite {{not being}} signed to the {{promotion}} at the time, Hennigan appeared for Global Force Wrestling at its live events, teaming with James Storm and Moose to defeat Ethan Carter III, Lashley and Eli Drake on August 4, and Carter, Lashley and Low Ki on August 5. On August 17, a video package was shown at Destination X revealing Hennigan's ring name as Johnny Impact. He made his televised in-ring debut on the August 24 episode of GFW Impact! in a Gauntlet for the Gold {{match for the}} vacant GFW Global Championship, ending in the final three before being eliminated by eventual winner Eli Drake. The following week, he and Eddie Edwards interrupted Drake and Chris Adonis' championship celebration, {{which led to a}} tag team match on the main event, which Drake and Adonis won. On the September 14 edition of GFW Impact!, Johnny Impact defeated Low Ki to become the number one contender to the GFW Global Championship at Victory Road. After the match, Impact was brutally assaulted by Drake and Adonis. The week after, Impact defended his number one contender status in two matches, defeating both KM and Texano in the same night. At Victory Road, Impact was defeated by Drake and failed to win the GFW Global Championship. After the match, he was attacked by Drake and Adonis but was saved by Garza Jr.. However, the <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> assaulted by LAX. On the October 12 episode of Impact!, Impact defeated Garza in a number one contendership match to challenge Eli Drake for the Global Championship in the main event of Bound for Glory. At the event, Impact was unsuccessful in defeating Drake for the championship after an interference from a returning Alberto El Patrón.|$|E

5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was given the}} service designation of MiG-9 (internal OKB designations of I-301 and izdeliye FS) and a small batch of ten aircraft, equipped with original German engines, was ordered during 1946 from Factory No. 1 in Kazan before flight testing was completed. They were intended {{to be used in}} the parade, but bad weather forced the cancellation of their flypast. <b>Two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> assigned to participate in the state acceptance trials while others were used as testbeds for various programs. The trials were concluded in June and the MiG-9 generally met the performance goals set by the Council of People's Commissars. The test pilots found the fighter easy and simple to fly. Defects noted during testing were that the engines flamed out when firing the cannon at high altitudes due to gun gas ingestion, no ejection seat was fitted, nor were air brakes or a fire suppression system. The fuel tanks were not self-sealing and no armor was provided for the pilot. Despite these drawbacks, the MiG-9 was ordered into production at Factory No. 1 before the acceptance tests were completed as the Soviet leadership believed that its shortcomings could be rectified during production. A batch of 50 aircraft, 40 single-seat fighters and 10 two-seat trainers, were ordered in late 1946 to participate in the 1947 May Day parade. In recognition of their accomplishment Artem Mikoyan and Mikhail Gurevich were awarded the Stalin Prize in 1947.|$|E
