5000|$|A {{comprehensive}} review of <b>thermomagnetic</b> convection (in A. Mukhopadhyay, R. Ganguly, S. Sen, and I. K. Puri, [...] "Scaling analysis to characterize <b>thermomagnetic</b> convection", International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer 48:3485-3492, (2005)) also shows that this form of convection can be correlated with a dimensionless magnetic Rayleigh number. Subsequently, this group explained that fluid motion occurs due {{to the presence of}} a Kelvin body force that has two terms. The first term can be treated as a magnetostatic pressure, while the second is important only if there is a spatial gradient of the fluid susceptibility, e.g., in a non-isothermal system. Colder fluid that has a larger magnetic susceptibility is attracted towards regions with larger field strength during <b>thermomagnetic</b> convection, which displaces warmer fluid of lower susceptibility. They showed that <b>thermomagnetic</b> convection can be correlated with a dimensionless magnetic Rayleigh number. Heat transfer due to this form of convection can be much more effective than buoyancy-induced convection for systems with small dimensions.|$|E

The deposit performance is also dependent on the chemical formulation and the solution dynamics during the plating process.

50|$|Askerov Bahram Mehrali oglu (5 October 1933 - 12 March 2014) was a physicist. He {{was born}} in the village of Ahmedabad, Tovuz district, Republic of Azerbaijan. In 1957 he {{graduated}} from the Physics and Mathematics Faculty of Baku State University. He went on to graduate study at Institute of Semiconductors in Saint Petersbourg, Russia, where he worked under the supervision of A.I.Anselm. In 1966 he was invited to teach at Baku State University, since 1971 he headed the chair for solid state Physics at the University. Works on the theory of solid state. He developed (together with A.I.Anselm) a quantum theory of <b>thermomagnetic</b> phenomena in semiconductors and metals. They proposed a method for calculating dissipative <b>thermomagnetic</b> currents in quantized magnetic fields, when the usual transport equation is not applicable. B.M.Askerov generalized the W.W.Adams and L.J.Goldstein`s density matrix method, underlying the quantum theory of transverse <b>thermomagnetic</b> phenomena in semiconductors, to the case of the indium-antimonide-type conduction band. He elaborated a theory of electron transport phenomena in quantum wells, classical and size-quantized films, and superlattices.|$|E

50|$|<b>Thermomagnetic</b> {{convection}} {{can occur}} when an {{external magnetic field}} is imposed on a ferrofluid with varying magnetic susceptibility. In {{the presence of a}} temperature gradient this results in a nonuniform magnetic body force, which leads to fluid movement. A ferrofluid is a liquid which becomes strongly magnetized {{in the presence of a}} magnetic field.|$|E
50|$|In {{physics and}} chemistry, the Nernst effect (also termed first Nernst-Ettingshausen effect, after Walther Nernst and Albert von Ettingshausen) is a {{thermoelectric}} (or <b>thermomagnetic)</b> phenomenon observed when a sample allowing electrical conduction {{is subjected to}} a magnetic field and a temperature gradient normal (perpendicular) to each other. An electric field will be induced normal to both.|$|E
50|$|An {{external}} {{magnetic field}} imposed on a ferrofluid with varying susceptibility (e.g., because of a temperature gradient) results in a nonuniform magnetic body force, {{which leads to a}} form of heat transfer called <b>thermomagnetic</b> convection. This form of heat transfer can be useful when conventional convection heat transfer is inadequate; e.g., in miniature microscale devices or under reduced gravity conditions.|$|E
50|$|The Hopkinson {{effect is}} a feature of {{ferromagnetic}} or ferrimagnetic materials, in which an increase in magnetic susceptibility is observed at temperatures between the blocking temperature and the Curie temperature of the material. The Hopkinson effect can be observed as a peak in <b>thermomagnetic</b> curves that immediately precedes the susceptibility drop associated with the Curie temperature. It was first observed by John Hopkinson in 1889 in a study on iron.|$|E
50|$|Convection can be {{qualified}} {{in terms of}} being natural, forced, gravitational, granular, or <b>thermomagnetic.</b> It may also be said to be due to combustion, capillary action, or Marangoni and Weissenberg effects. Heat transfer by natural convection plays a role in the structure of Earth's atmosphere, its oceans, and its mantle. Discrete convective cells in the atmosphere can be seen as clouds, with stronger convection resulting in thunderstorms. Natural convection also plays a role in stellar physics.|$|E

Finlayson first {{explained}} in 1970 (in his paper [...] "Convective instability of ferromagnetic fluids", Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 40:753-767) how an {{external magnetic field}} imposed on a ferrofluid with varying magnetic susceptibility, e.g., due to a temperature gradient, results in a nonuniform magnetic body force, which leads to <b>thermomagnetic</b> convection. This form of heat transfer can be useful for cases where conventional convection fails to provide adequate heat transfer, e.g., in miniature microscale devices or under reduced gravity conditions.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, CA, Dr. Rand was {{assisted}} by physicists {{in creating the}} instrumentation for another novel procedure he called <b>Thermomagnetic</b> Surgery. In this treatment, cancerous organs such as the uterus or kidney would be selectively heated and destroyed without damaging the surrounding tissues. The premise of this approach {{was that it would}} prevent the spread of cancerous cells into the body or blood stream when the malignant organs were removed surgically because the cancers were already dead prior to their removal.|$|E
5000|$|He {{graduated}} from Birmingham University in 1920 with a B.Sc and {{remained at the}} university for a while after in order to start research for a doctorate in Natural Philosophy. This was awarded in 1922 for his thesis entitled, [...] "The <b>thermomagnetic</b> properties of carbon steels at temperatures round the Curie point". Afterwards, he obtained a post lecturing at Edinburgh University in 1922, where he was appointed assistant lecturer in Natural Philosophy. In 1924, {{he was promoted to}} lecturer. Shortly after arriving at Edinburgh, he joined the Edinburgh Mathematical Society in March 1923. In 1951, he was appointed as a senior lecturer, a role in which he filled until his death five years later.|$|E
50|$|Until {{manufacturers}} developed {{new ways}} to mill the oxide, the crystals could easily be broken in the manufacturing process, and this led to excessive print-through (echo). Output from a tape could drop about 1 dB or so in a year's time. Although the decrease was uniform across the frequency range and noise also dropped the same amount, preserving the dynamic range, the decrease misaligned Dolby noise reduction decoders that were sensitive to level settings. The chrome coating was harder than competitive coatings, and that led to accusations of excessive head wear. Although the tape wore hard ferrite heads faster than oxide based tapes, it actually wore softer permalloy heads at a slower rate; and head wear was more a problem for permalloy heads than for ferrite heads. The head wear scare and licensing issues with DuPont kept blank consumer chrome tapes at a great disadvantage versus the eventually more popular Type II tapes that used cobalt-modified iron oxide, but chrome was the tape of choice for the music industry's cassette releases. Because of its low Curie temperature (approximately 386 K), chrome tape lent itself to high-speed <b>thermomagnetic</b> duplication of audio and video cassettes for pre-recorded product sales to the consumer and industrial markets.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{compare the}} {{efficiency}} and the power density of thermoelectric and <b>thermomagnetic</b> generators at maximum power. The performances of <b>thermomagnetic</b> generator are computed using an equation of state, either extrapolated from experimental data for 2 nd order transition or deduced using a phenomenological Landau model on measured data for 1 st order transition. The performances of thermoelectric generator are computed using the Onsager model. Moreover, the heat exchange in finite time is estimated using a simple model of thermal conductance. According to the results, <b>thermomagnetic</b> generator is more efficient and have slightly higher power density than thermoelectric for temperature difference lower than 10 K. Therefore low grade heat thermal energy harvesting could consider <b>thermomagnetic</b> generator...|$|E
40|$|When {{interpreting}} <b>thermomagnetic</b> {{curves of}} non-saturated magnetic minerals, irreversible {{heating and cooling}} curves need not necessarily imply chemical or structural changes. Increased aligning of magnetic moments on heating in an applied magnetic field can also induce an irreversible cooling curve. The two processes can be distinguished by stirring the sample between subsequent <b>thermomagnetic</b> runs. Sample redispersion considerably enhances the interpretative value of <b>thermomagnetic</b> analysis and is therefore strongly recommended, in particular when analysing non-saturated magnetic minerals. Stirring between subsequent runs was extensively used {{in the analysis of}} the <b>thermomagnetic</b> behaviour of haematite and goethite as a function of grain size (i. e. coercivity) in various non-saturating magnetic fields (10 - 350 mT). The shape of the <b>thermomagnetic</b> heating curves of haematite is shown to be dependent on the competitive interplay between the temperature dependence of the exchange energy and that of the coercive force with respect to the applied field. On heating, pure defectpoor haematite, which is magnetically dominated by the canted moment, has an initially increasing <b>thermomagnetic</b> heating curve. Further heating causes the magnetization to increase smoothly up to a certain temperature which depends critically on the applied field and the coercivity of the sample. The irreversible block-shaped <b>thermomagnetic</b> cooling curve lies above the heating curve, and shows hardly any dependence on applied field and grain size. In contrast to the heating curve, the shape of the cooling curve depends only on the temperature variation of the exchange energy. Our data seem to indicate that for defect-poor haematites the domain configuration acquired at the maximum heating temperature is retained on cooling to room temperature. More defect-rich haematite has a gently decreasing <b>thermomagnetic</b> heating curve. On heating to increasingly elevated temperatures (800 °C) the defects are annealed out off the lattice, because the <b>thermomagnetic</b> curves approach those of defect-poor haematite. The defect moment due to lattice defects seems to be additive to, but softer than, the canted moment. The canted and defect moment appear to have the same Neel (or Curie) temperature (= 680 °C), because no change in temperature was observed, whilst the relative contributions did change. The <b>thermomagnetic</b> behaviour of goethite is shown to be dependent on its coercivity and the amount of substituted ions...|$|E
40|$|The {{intermetallic}} compound SmMn 2 Ge 2, displaying multiple magnetic phase transitions, {{is being investigated}} in detail for its magnetization behavior near the 145 K first order ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic transition occuring on cooling, in particular for <b>thermomagnetic</b> history effects in the magnetization data. The most unusual finding is that the <b>thermomagnetic</b> irreversibility, [= M FCW (T) -M ZFC (T) ] at 135 K is higher in intermediate magnetic field strengths. By studying {{the response of the}} sample (i. e., <b>thermomagnetic</b> irreversibility and thermal hysteresis) to different histories of application of magnetic field and temperature, we demonstrate how the supercooling and superheating of the metastable magnetic phases across the first order transition at 145 K contribute to overall <b>thermomagnetic</b> irreversibility.

40|$|A {{problem of}} the {{definition}} of the heat transported in <b>thermomagnetic</b> phenomena has been well realized in the late sixties, but not solved up to date. Ignoring this problem, numerous recent theories grossly overestimate the <b>thermomagnetic</b> coefficients in strongly interacting systems. Here we develop a gauge-invariant microscopic approach, which shows that the heat transfer should include the energy of the interaction between electrons and a magnetic field. We also demonstrate that the surface currents induced by the magnetic field transfer the charge in the Nernst effect, but do not transfer the heat in the Ettingshausen effect. Only with these two modifications of the theory, the physically measurable <b>thermomagnetic</b> coefficients satisfy the Onsager relation. We critically revised the Gaussian fluctuation model above the superconducting transition and show that the gauge invariance uniquely relates <b>thermomagnetic</b> phenomena in the Fermi liquid with the particle-hole asymmetry.

40|$|Summary. Magnetic {{extracts}} {{were prepared}} from samples of Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous pelagic limestones from France and Spain. Thermo-magnetic {{analysis of the}} magnetic extracts using a microbalance required careful monitoring of base weight changes during heating. Heating in argon gas atmosphere induced production of magnetite during heating while slight oxidation occurred during heating in air. The dominant Curie temperature detected by the <b>thermomagnetic</b> analyses was the 585 °C Curie temperature of magnetite. The 680 °C Curie temperature of haematite was only detected when isothermal remanent magnetism (IRM) data indicated large con-centrations of haematite. Even when IRM data indicated its presence, the <b>thermomagnetic</b> analyses did not detect the Nee 1 temperature of goethite. Although <b>thermomagnetic</b> analyses of magnetic extracts provide more direct identification of the dominant, strongly ferromagnetic minerals, IRM acquisition and subsequent thermal demagnetization is a superior technique in detecting high coercivity, weakly ferromagnetic minerals such as goethite and haematite.

In analogy with the thermoelectric effect in electron systems, the <b>thermomagnetic</b> power (magnetic Seebeck coefficient) is provided, and is numerically evaluated by the exact diagonalization for wide ranges of temperatures and various magnetic fields. For the antiferromagnetic regime, we find the magnetic Seebeck coefficient changes sign at certain temperatures, which is interpreted as an effect of strong correlations. We also compute the <b>thermomagnetic</b> figure of merit determining the efficiency of the <b>thermomagnetic</b> devices for cooling or power generation. Comment: 8 page...|$|E
40|$|The {{propagation}} of a nonlinear stationary <b>thermomagnetic</b> wave in superconducting media is qualitatively analyzed {{in view of}} the effect of an external magnetic field. The velocity and the thickness of the wave front are estimated. It is demonstrated that the inclusion of an external magnetic field affects the <b>thermomagnetic</b> wave profile only slightly. The evolution of Joule heat during the dissipative motion of a magnetic flux gives rise to pronounced nonlinear effects showing up as various wave processes. These processes define the dynamics of thermal and electromagnetic perturbations in superconducting media [1 - 3]. The stationary {{propagation of}} a nonlinear shock <b>thermomagnetic</b> wave in the resistive state of a superconductor is an example. As is shown [1], the dispersive, nonlinear, and dissipative processes in superconducting media result in the formation of stable thermoelectric, ⃗ E, and/or <b>thermomagnetic,</b> ⃗ H, waves depending on the surface conditions. It was assumed that the critical current density ⃗jc is independent of the local value of the external magnetic field ⃗H (Bean’s model of critical state [4]). However, in sufficiently strong fields, this dependence cannot be disregarded (see, e. g., [5]) and its effect on the nonlinear <b>thermomagnetic</b> wave should be taken into account. In this paper, we studied the structure of a shock <b>thermomagnetic</b> wave for an arbitrary dependence of the critical current density ⃗jc on the external magnetic field ⃗ H. Expressions for the velocity and the thickness of the wave front were obtained. The propagation of a <b>thermomagnetic</b> wave in a superconducting medium along the x axis with a constant velocity v is described by the nonlinear heat conduction equation (with the self-simulated variables ξ(x, t) = x − vt) [1] Maxwell equations − νv dT dξ dE dξ d = κ dξ dT + jE, (1) dξ = − 4 πv j, (2) c 2 and the related equation of critical state E =...|$|E

30|$|Many {{previous}} studies have reported magnetic field changes accompanying volcanic activity (e.g., Dzurisin et al. 1990; Sasai et al. 2002; Hurst et al. 2004).

A large <b>thermomagnetic</b> effect implies a substantial difference between heat supply from depth and surface and/or near-surface heat discharge.|$|E
