5|$|Soluble ionic {{compounds}} like salt {{can easily}} be dissolved to provide electrolyte solutions. This is {{a simple way to}} control the concentration and ionic strength.

Because the solutes are charged ions they also increase the electrical conductivity of the solution. The increased ionic strength reduces the <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electrical double layer around colloidal particles, and therefore the stability of emulsions and suspensions.|$|E

The variations in the <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oxide layer that forms on the surface of the crystal causes different wavelengths of light to interfere upon reflection, thus displaying a rainbow of colors.
