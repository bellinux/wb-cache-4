5|$|The <b>thrifty</b> gene {{hypothesis}} postulates that, due to dietary scarcity during human evolution, {{people are}} prone to obesity. Their ability {{to take advantage of}} rare periods of abundance by storing energy as fat would be advantageous during times of varying food availability, and individuals with greater adipose reserves {{would be more likely to}} survive famine. This tendency to store fat, however, would be maladaptive in societies with stable food supplies. This theory has received various criticisms, and other evolutionarily-based theories such as the drifty gene hypothesis and the <b>thrifty</b> phenotype hypothesis have also been proposed.|$|E
5|$|Although Shetlands {{are small}} and slow-growing {{compared}} to commercial breeds, they are hardy, <b>thrifty,</b> easy lambers, adaptable and long-lived. The Shetland breed has survived for centuries in difficult conditions and on a poor diet, but they thrive in better conditions. Shetlands retain many of their primitive survival instincts, so they are easier to care for than many modern breeds.|$|E

5|$|While Jesus {{is portrayed}} as an impassioned person for his love for all (even for shopping), Buddha tends to be calm and <b>thrifty,</b> and also likes manga. The comedy often {{involves}} visual gags and puns, as well as jokes in reference to elements of Christianity and Buddhism; for example, Jesus creates wine from water in a public bath and Buddha shines when excited.|$|E
5|$|Seattle {{was also}} the home base of {{impresario}} Alexander Pantages who, starting in 1902, opened a number of theaters in the city exhibiting vaudeville acts and silent movies. His activities soon expanded, and the <b>thrifty</b> Greek went on {{and became one of}} America's greatest theater and movie tycoons. Between Pantages and his rival John Considine, Seattle was for a while the western United States' vaudeville mecca. B. Marcus Priteca, the Scottish-born and Seattle-based architect, built several theaters for Pantages, including some in Seattle. The theaters he built for Pantages in Seattle have been either demolished or converted to other uses, but many other theaters survive in other cities of the U.S., often retaining the Pantages name; Seattle's surviving Paramount Theatre, on which he collaborated, was not a Pantages theater.|$|E
5|$|While other {{refineries}} {{would keep}} the 60% of oil product that became kerosene, but dump the other 40% in rivers and massive sludge piles, Rockefeller remained as <b>thrifty</b> and efficient as ever, using the gasoline to fuel the refinery, and selling the rest as lubricating oil, petroleum jelly and paraffin wax, and other by-products. Tar was used for paving, naphtha shipped to gas plants. Likewise, Rockefeller's refineries hired their own plumbers, cutting the cost of pipe-laying in half. Barrels that cost $2.50 each ended up only $.96 when Rockefeller bought the wood and had them built for himself.|$|E

5|$|Wilsonville {{has often}} had more {{jobs in the}} city than {{residents}} due to its location along Interstate 5.

5|$|In 1944, it {{was decided}} by the University of Melbourne that Burnet would be {{appointed}} a professor {{as part of a}} cooperative program so that university students could be experimentally trained at the institute, while the researchers engaged in some teaching. This was not a success, and there was much tension, as Burnet repeatedly expressed his opinion in public that university teaching and research should be kept separate, at one point leading to a series of open letters from university professors decrying his attitude. Burnet was also not interested in the politics of university funding, and his disengagement from administrative matters engendered resentment. On the other hand, Burnet was vigorous in obtaining funding for the Hall Institute from government bodies, resorting to the bluff of feigning interest in moving overseas to secure continued strong backing. However, he was criticised for being <b>thrifty</b> and refusing to invest in cutting edge equipment, despite the Hall Institute's high standing in research circles. Colleagues believed that he was sceptical of modern technology and thought his outlook to be limiting.|$|E

500|$|With {{the advent}} of speedier and <b>thriftier</b> {{production}} methods, steel has become easier to obtain and much cheaper. It has replaced wrought iron for a multitude of purposes.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{dynamics}} of wealth distribution between workers and capitalists in a neoclassical growth model with differential saving rates. It shows that if capitalists are <b>thriftier</b> than workers and the factors elasticity of substitution is high enough to ensure endogenous growth, capitalists share of total wealth asymptotically tends to one. It is also proved that a tax on capital income shifts the long run distribution of wealth in workers favor, and that the capitalists share of total wealth is a decreasing function of the tax rate. The results of the paper are compared to Pikettys fundamental laws of capitalism...|$|R
