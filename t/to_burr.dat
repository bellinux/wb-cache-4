25|$|Witez II was {{purchased}} in 1949 by Earle E. and Frances Hurlbutt of the Calarabia Ranch near Calabasas, California, who owned {{him for the}} remainder of his life. Because the remount horses had been shipped to a consolidated site in Oklahoma for sale, Hurlbutt flew to Fort Reno, Oklahoma, specifically to bid on the stallion, and paid $8100 for the horse. Witez II lived on the Hurlbutt ranch for many years, but left California from 1960 to 1964 on a lease <b>to</b> <b>Burr</b> Betts of the Betts Circle 2 Ranch in Parker, Colorado.

500|$|Soon {{after the}} 1804 gubernatorial {{election}} in New York—in which Morgan Lewis, greatly assisted by Hamilton, defeated Aaron Burr—the Albany Register published Charles D.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the method <b>to</b> prevent cutting <b>burr</b> at face milling of {{stainless}} steels. Without laser heat treatment for workpiece, SUS 304 caused largest burr height in three type stainless steels. SUS 430 was easier to be hardened using laser heat treatment compared with SUS 304 and SUS 403. As for SUS 304, it was possible <b>to</b> reduce <b>burr</b> height. However, it was impossible <b>to</b> prevention <b>burr</b> generation perfectly. As for SUS 430 and SUS 403, choosing optimum cutting conditions, it was possible <b>to</b> prevention <b>burr</b> generation perfectly. Therefore, laser heat treatment for workpiece is efficient <b>to</b> prevent cutting <b>burr</b> at face milling of stainless steels...|$|R

5000|$|In 1807, Burr {{was arrested}} for treason. Although Jefferson privately confided to Senator William Plumber of New Hampshire {{that he did not}} think there was enough {{evidence}} <b>to</b> convict <b>Burr</b> of treason, his public condemnation of Burr, along with Wilkinson's letter and the deposition of William Eaton, insured an indictment. On January 26, 1807, Eaton gave a deposition regarding his conversations with Burr. The affidavit stated that, as he listened <b>to</b> <b>Burr's</b> ambitions, Eaton came <b>to</b> believe that <b>Burr</b> was planning the overthrow of the United States government.

2500|$|After {{returning}} from Europe, Burr used the surname [...] "Edwards", his mother's maiden name, {{for a while}} to avoid creditors. With help from old friends Samuel Swartwout and Matthew L. Davis, Burr returned to New York and his law practice. Later he helped the heirs of the Eden family in a financial lawsuit. By the early 1820s, the remaining members of the Eden household, Eden's widow and two daughters, had become a surrogate family <b>to</b> <b>Burr.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Burr's weight, {{always an}} issue for him in getting roles, became a public {{relations}} problem when Johnny Carson began making jokes about him during his Tonight Show monologues. Burr refused to appear as Carson's guest from then on, and told Us Weekly years later: [...] "I have been asked {{a number of times}} to do his show and I won't do it. Because I like NBC. He's doing an NBC show. If I went on I'd have some things to say, not just about the bad jokes he's done about me, but bad jokes he does about everybody who can't fight back because they aren't there. And that wouldn't be good for NBC." [...] In later life, his distinctive physique and manner {{could be used as a}} reference that would be universally recognized. One journal for librarians published a writer's opinion that [...] "asking persons without cataloging experience to design automated catalogs … is as practical as asking Raymond Burr to pole vault." [...] A character in a 1989 short story refers <b>to</b> <b>Burr</b> as [...] "grossly overweight" [...] in Ironside.|$|E

We remember an Englishman, however, who would never concede talents <b>to</b> <b>Burr,</b> because the latter said, a L'AmEricaine, EurOpean, instead of EuropEan.|$|E
50|$|Hamilton {{replied that}} Burr should give {{specifics}} of Hamilton's remarks, not Cooper's. He {{said he could}} not answer regarding Cooper's interpretation. A few more letters followed, in which the exchange escalated <b>to</b> <b>Burr's</b> demanding that Hamilton recant or deny any statement disparaging Burr's honor over the past 15 years. Hamilton did not. Burr responded by challenging Hamilton to a duel, personal combat under the formalized rules for dueling, the code duello.|$|R
