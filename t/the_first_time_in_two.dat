However, as the Panthers were out of playoff contention, they traded Bure to the Dallas Stars on March 9, 2004, in exchange for Drew Bagnall and a draft pick. Bure was placed on the Stars' top line with Mike Modano and Jere Lehtinen, and he recorded 7 points in 13 games to conclude the regular season. Bure added three assists in five playoff games.|$|E

5|$|The name euro {{was officially}} adopted on 16 December 1995 in Madrid. The euro was {{introduced}} to world financial markets as an accounting currency on 1 January 1999, replacing the former European Currency Unit (ECU) {{at a ratio of}} 1:1 (US$1.1743). Physical euro coins and banknotes entered into circulation on 1 January 2002, making it the day-to-day operating currency of its original members, and by May 2002 had completely replaced the former currencies. While the euro dropped subsequently to US$0.8252 within two years (26 October 2000), it has traded above the U.S. dollar since the end of 2002, peaking at US$1.6038 on 18 July 2008. Since late 2009, the euro has been immersed in the European sovereign-debt crisis which has {{led to the creation of}} the European Financial Stability Facility as well as other reforms aimed at stabilising the currency. In July 2012, the euro fell below US$1.21 for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> years, following concerns raised over Greek debt and Spain's troubled banking sector. As of October 2017, the euro–dollar exchange rate stands at ~US$1.18.|$|E

50|$|The Canadian Amateur {{stayed in}} Ontario and Quebec until 1921, {{when it went}} to Manitoba. It went to Alberta for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> 1929, to British Columbia for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> 1932, to Atlantic Canada for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> 1949, and to Saskatchewan for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> 1950. Since then, it has rotated around the country's top courses, with the current format {{allowing}} {{each of the six}} major golf regions (Atlantic Canada, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba and Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia) to have its turn on approximately a six-year cycle. Among Canada's ten provinces, only Newfoundland and Labrador has yet to host it.|$|R

5|$|He {{scored a}} hard hitting 76 {{in the first}} innings of the Second Test at Lord's to help Australia take control, but a {{stubborn}} partnership by Bailey and Willie Watson saw England hang on for a draw. Davidson bowled only 24.5 overs for the match, and Wardle was his only wicket. Rainy weather greeted {{the players in the}} Third Test at Old Trafford and more than half the playing time was washed out. Davidson took 2/60 in the drawn match, removing Reg Simpson and Willie Watson. Australia were in a good position {{at the start of the}} final day of the Fourth Test at Headingley, with England leading by only 78 runs with five wickets in hand. However, Bailey (38) and Jim Laker (48) stubbornly resisted with a mixture of time-wasting and dour defence. Davidson eventually removed both, but there was not enough time remaining to secure an Australian victory. His match figures of 3/59 from 50.1 overs were in large part due to the defensive tactics of England. The fate of The Ashes thus came down to the Fifth Test at The Oval. Davidson scored 22 and 21 and could not take a wicket as England won by eight wickets to regain the urn for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> decades. Australia had blundered by omitting a specialist spinner, mistakenly thinking that the pitch would not spin. Davidson hit England's spinners out of the attack for a period, but succumbed to the variable bounce of the pitch.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, Morris {{returned}} to England, {{the setting for}} his three Test centuries five years earlier, for another Ashes series. In a tour opening festival match against East Molesey, Morris made 103 in eighty minutes. After the modest run scoring of the previous three Test seasons, Morris warmed up in 10 lead-in matches that yielded a moderate return of 347 runs at 34.70. However, his performances {{in the first two}} drawn Tests, in which he struck three half centuries, indicated that might be returning to his earlier form. He was unable to maintain his form however, and did not pass 40 in the last three Tests, ending the series with 337 runs at a modest average of 33.70. The teams were locked at 0–0 heading into the Fifth Test, and Hassett and Morris thought that the pitch at The Oval would favour fast bowling. However, they were mistaken, and Morris could manage only 16 and 26 as the hosts' spinners cut down the tourists, while their Australian counterparts watched from the stands. Denis Compton pulled Morris' spin for four to seal an English win by eight wickets. This meant that the hosts regained the Ashes for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> decades with a 1–0 triumph, and Morris thus tasted a series defeat {{for the first time in}} his career. It was a low-scoring series, and Morris placed third in the Australian Test averages and aggregates, behind Hassett with 365 at 36.50. Morris' batting was regarded by commentators as being more carefree than during the Invincibles tour. He took his second and final wicket in Test cricket, that of Alec Bedser, in the Third Test at Old Trafford. Morris also struggled in the first-class matches, making 1,302 runs at 38.09 with only one century, which did not come until almost four months had elapsed on tour, against the Gentlemen of England. Morris placed third in the aggregates but only ranked sixth in the averages. He made many starts, with 11 fifties, but was only able to capitalise and reached triple figures only once.|$|E
