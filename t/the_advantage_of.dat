5|$|A {{secondary}} cutoff {{named the}} Slate Creek or Kinney Cutoff breaks {{from the main}} trail near the Lombard Ferry on the Green River, and meets the Sublette cutoff on Slate Creek Ridge at Emigrant Springs. This route was slightly longer than the Sublette, but had <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> only 10 waterless miles rather than the 45 endured on the Sublette trail.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{which follows}} the {{procedure}} of relatively fast ascent interrupted by periods at constant depth {{is known as}} staged decompression. The ascent rate and the depth and duration of the stops are integral parts of the decompression process. <b>The</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> staged decompression {{is that it is}} far easier to monitor and control than continuous decompression.|$|E

5|$|In The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game (Games Workshop, 2001), Elves {{have similar}} {{statistics}} to similarly armed Men, except for much higher scores for their Fighting and Courage attributes.

40|$|Although new to {{many members}} of the {{psychological}} community, the notion of a “combined” model of training has been in existence for nearly 30 years (Beutler 2 ̆ 6 Fisher, 1994). The present article is intended to outline <b>the</b> benefits and <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Combined-Integrated (C-I) model. Following a brief discussion of the terms “combined” and “integrated,” <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> C-I training are discussed across five key themes: (a) the high overlap across traditional practice area training, (b) <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> breadth of training offered, (c) <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> C-I training for the professional of psychology, (d) <b>the</b> pragmatic <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> C-I training to faculty and students, and (e) the benefits of C-I training for salient constituency groups...|$|R

5|$|Plutonium alloys can be {{produced}} by adding a metal to molten plutonium. If the alloying metal is sufficiently reductive, plutonium can be added {{in the form of}} oxides or halides. The δ phase plutonium–gallium and plutonium–aluminium alloys are produced by adding plutonium(III) fluoride to molten gallium or aluminium, which has <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> avoiding dealing directly with the highly reactive plutonium metal.|$|E
5|$|The Belgian Army, brutally assailed by {{an unparalleled}} {{surprise}} attack, grappling with {{forces that are}} better equipped and have <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> a formidable air force, has for three days carried out difficult operations, the success of which is {{of the utmost importance}} to the general conduct of the battle and to the result of war.|$|E

5|$|The {{ignition}} system {{consisted of two}} rear-mounted, crankshaft-driven magnetos, each supplying one {{of a pair of}} spark plugs fitted to each cylinder. This is common practise for aero engines, as it ensures continued operation {{in the case of a}} single magneto failure, and has <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> more efficient combustion over a single spark plug application.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} light and medium-calibre guns was limited, and {{accuracy}} declined badly at longer range. At longer ranges <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> {{a high rate of}} fire decreased; accurate shooting depended on spotting the shell-splashes of the previous salvo, which limited the optimum rate of fire.|$|E

5|$|Although figs flower asynchronously as a population, in {{most species}} {{flowering}} is synchronised within an individual. Newly emerged female wasps must {{move away from}} their natal tree {{in order to find}} figs in which to lay their eggs. This is to <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> the fig, since it prevents self-pollination. In Florida, individual F. aurea trees flower and fruit asynchronously. Within-tree asynchrony in flowering is likely to raise the probability of self-pollination, but it may be an adaptation that allows the species to maintain an adequate population of wasps at low population densities or in strongly seasonal climates.|$|E

Simple games such as Tetris and Solitaire had existed for PDA devices since their introduction, but by 2009 PDAs and phones had grown sufficiently powerful to where complex graphical games could be implemented, with <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> distribution over wireless broadband.|$|E

5|$|Another {{possible}} way {{to separate the}} trivalent actinides is via solvent extraction chromatography using bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (abbreviated as HDEHP) as the stationary organic phase and nitric acid as the mobile aqueous phase. The actinide elution sequence is reversed {{from that of the}} cation-exchange resin column, so that the heavier actinides elute later. The mendelevium separated by this method has <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> being free of organic complexing agent compared to the resin column; the disadvantage is that mendelevium then elutes very late in the elution sequence, after fermium.|$|E
5|$|As {{far as the}} Belgians were concerned, the Dyle Plan had advantages. Instead of {{the limited}} Allied advance to the Scheldt, or meeting the Germans on the Franco-Belgian border, the move to the Dyle river would reduce the Allied front in central Belgium by , freeing more forces {{for use as a}} {{strategic}} reserve. It was felt it would save more Belgian territory, in particular the eastern industrial regions. It also had <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> absorbing Dutch and Belgian Army formations (including some 20 Belgian divisions). Gamelin was to justify the Dyle Plan after the defeat using these arguments.|$|E
5|$|At present, {{there are}} two major methods of {{producing}} isotopes of transplutonium elements: (1) irradiation of the lighter elements with either neutrons or (2) accelerated charged particles. The first method is most important for applications, as only neutron irradiation using nuclear reactors allows the production of sizeable amounts of synthetic actinides; however, it is limited to relatively light elements. <b>The</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> the second method is that elements heavier than plutonium, as well as neutron-deficient isotopes, can be obtained, which are not formed during neutron irradiation.|$|E
