40|$|Graduation date: 1978 Lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) are {{naturally}} occurring heavy metals {{which have been}} redistributed {{to a large extent}} by man in the environment. These metals have certain common toxic sites of action on biological systems of mammals. Simultaneous exposure <b>to</b> <b>Pb</b> and Cd is highly probable due to common sources of exposure in the environment. The {{purpose of this study was}} to observe the effects of simultaneous, chronic exposure <b>to</b> <b>Pb</b> and Cd on pathology, tissue residues and susceptibility to viral challenge in mice. Mice were exposed, via the drinking water, <b>to</b> either <b>Pb</b> <b>or</b> Cd or both metals simultaneously at various doses for ten weeks and then challenged with encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV). Mortality was enhanced in all groups of mice exposed <b>to</b> <b>Pb</b> and suppressed in groups of mice treated with Cd. Mice simultaneously coexposed <b>to</b> <b>Pb</b> and Cd had mortality rates intermediate to those observed after exposure to the individual metals. It is proposed that Pb suppresses immunity in mice by inhibition of basic metabolic functions deoendent on sulfhydrylcontaining enzymes. The effect of this action results in a decreased ability of cells to produce antibodies, interferon and anti-viral proteins. It is postulated that Cd enhances the immune response in mice by inhibition of zinc-dependent enzymes such as peptidases and RNA polymerase. This results in increased stability and persistance of antibodies, interferon and anti-viral proteins in addition to decreased ability of the virus to replicate. Coexposure <b>to</b> <b>Pb</b> and Cd did not appear to alter histopathologic lesions observed by light microscopy that were produced by exposure <b>to</b> <b>Pb</b> <b>or</b> Cd only. <b>Pb</b> and Cd residues in tissues of mice exposed to these metals, as compared to residues in tissues of mice which received <b>Pb</b> <b>or</b> Cd only, indicate that interaction occurs in regard to metabolism, storage and excretion of these elements. Coexposure <b>to</b> <b>Pb</b> caused increased Cd accumulation at low doses. The effectwasreversed at high doses and Cd tissue residues are reduced. Pb tissue residues, except in kidneys, were generally lower in mice coexposed <b>to</b> Cd. Kidney <b>Pb</b> levels increased in these mice. It is significant that chronic coexposure <b>to</b> <b>Pb</b> and Cd at subclinical doses alters certain effects produced by exposure to only one of the metals.

Despite a protein level expression {{similar to that}} of native pB, 7 pB significantly increased the gene transfer efficiency of a neomycin resistance cassette transposon in both HEK 293 and HeLa cultured human cells. Native pB and SB 100 X, the most active transposase of the Sleeping Beauty transposon system, exhibited similar transposition efficiency in cultured human cell lines. When delivered to primary human T cells ex vivo, 7 pB increased gene delivery two- to threefold compared with piggyBac and SB 100 X. The activity of hyperactive 7 pB transposase was not affected by the addition of a 24 -kDa N-terminal tag, whereas SB 100 X manifested a 50 % reduction in transposition. Hyperactive 7 pB was compared with native pB and SB 100 X in vivo in mice using hydrodynamic tail-vein injection of a limiting dose of transposase DNA combined with luciferase reporter transposons. We followed transgene ex-pression for up to 6 months and observed approximately 10 -fold greater long-term gene expression in mice injected with a codon-optimized version of 7 pB compared with mice injected with native <b>pB</b> <b>or</b> <b>SB</b> 100 X.

Exogenous IAA significantly increased Pb accumulation in roots, but significantly decreased Pb accumulation in shoots over the culture period of 5 days. Increased Pb uptake in maize roots partly took place through calcium and potassium channels, and also depended upon membrane potential. Lipid peroxidation in terms of malondialdehyde (MDA) content was enhanced, indicating that Pb and/or IAA caused oxidative stress in maize seedlings.

40|$|Oxidative stress, {{which is}} the loss of balance between {{antioxidant}} defense and oxidant production in the cells, is implicated in the molecular mechanism of heavy metal-induced neurotoxicity. Given the key role of lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) in inducing oxidative stress, we investigated their role in disrupting the integrity and function of immortalized human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hCMEC/D 3). To study this, hCMEC/D 3 cells were exposed to control media or to media containing different concentrations of <b>Pb</b> <b>or</b> Cd. Those exposed <b>to</b> <b>Pb</b> <b>or</b> Cd showed significantly higher oxidative stress than the untreated group, as indicated by cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutathione (GSH) levels, and catalase enzyme activity.

However, no significant disruption in the integrity of the endothelial monolayer was seen with cadmium at the concentrations used. Taken together, these results show that Pb and Cd induce cell death and dysfunction in hCMEC/D 3 cells and, in the case of Pb, barrier disruption. This suggests blood brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction as a contributing mechanism in Pb and Cd neurotoxicities...|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Mercury (Hg) and lead (<b>Pb)</b> are toxic <b>to</b> the development and function of the central nervous system (CNS). Interleukin- 6 (IL 6) produced by astroglia protects neurons from damage in many progressive degenerative disorders. IL- 6 secretion is chaperoned by a 78 kD glucose-regulated protein (GRP 78), which is an ER-chaperone protein involved in protein folding, assembly, and trafficking. We hypothesized that Pb and Hg could target GRP 78 and thereby block IL- 6 secretion from astroglia. In this report, we constructed an IL- 6 -EGFP chimera and transiently transfected rat C 6 glioma cells and rat primary astroglia. IL- 6 -EGFP signal in transfected cultures exposed <b>to</b> <b>Pb,</b> Hg, <b>or</b> anti-oligos against GRP 78 was detected with a bio-image fluorescence microscope. Data of the bio-image analysis showed that the retention of IL- 6 -EGFP in both astroglia and C 6 cells transfected with IL- 6 -EGFP was at an undetectable level. However, the IL- 6 -EGFP signal in these cultures, while exposed <b>to</b> <b>Pb</b> (0 - 10 ?M) or Hg (0 - 10 ?M) for 24 hours, apparently increased, suggesting that <b>Pb</b> <b>or</b> Hg could block IL- 6 secretion from astroglia. Furthermore, when these transfected cultures were exposed to anti-oligos against GRP 78, as expected, the retention of IL- 6 -EGFP within the cultures increased. In order to quantify the increase of IL- 6 -EGFP retention, we used ELISA to detect IL- 6 levels in the medium of non-transfected astroglia exposed <b>to</b> <b>Pb</b> (0 - 100 ?M) and Hg (0 - 10 ?M). Data showed that IL- 6 levels in the medium decreased when the primary astrocyte cultures were exposed <b>to</b> <b>Pb</b> <b>or</b> Hg, suggesting that the increased retention results in part from a decrease in IL- 6 secretion. We used an immunocytochemistry assay as an additional approach for quantifying IL- 6 amounts of cells treated or not treated with metals. The immunocytochemistry data concurred with the ELISA findings. These data, together with our previous studies, suggest that Pb and Hg may target GRP 78, thereby reducing the amount of IL- 6 secreted from astroglia.

40|$|The {{constitutive}} active/androstane receptor (CAR) {{plays an}} important role as a coordinate transcription factor in the regulation of various hepatic metabolic pathways for chemicals such as drugs, glucose, fatty acids, bilirubin, and bile acids. Currently, it is known that in its inactive state, CAR is retained in the cytoplasm in a protein complex with HSP 90 and the tetratricopeptide repeat protein cytosoplasmic CAR retention protein (CCRP). Upon activation by phenobarbital (<b>PB)</b> <b>or</b> the PB-like inducer 1, 4 -bis[2 -(3, 5 -dichloropyridyloxy) ]-benzene (TCPOBOP), CAR translocates into the nucleus. We have identified two new components to the cytoplasmic regulation of CAR: ubiquitin-dependent degradation of CCRP and protein-protein interaction with HSP 70. Treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG 132 (5 µM) causes CAR to accumulate in the cytoplasm of transfected HepG 2 cells. In the presence of MG 132, TCPOBOP increases CCRP ubiquitination in HepG 2 cells co-expressing CAR, while CAR ubiquitination was not detected. MG 132 treatment of HepG 2 also attenuated of TCPOBOP-induced CAR transcriptional activation on reporter constructs which contain CAR-binding DNA elements derived from the human CYP 2 B 6 gene. The elevation of cytoplasmic CAR protein with MG 132 correlated with an increase of HSP 70, {{and to a lesser extent}} HSP 60. Both CCRP and CAR were found to interact with endogenous HSP 70 in HepG 2 cells by immunoprecipitation analysis. Induction of HSP 70 levels by heat shock also increased cytoplasmic CAR levels, similar to the effect of MG 132. Lastly, heat shock attenuated TCPOBOP-induced CAR transcriptional activation, also similar to the effect of MG 132.

40|$|AbstractThe {{constitutive}} androstane receptor (CAR) is {{a member}} of the nuclear receptor superfamily. The CAR is normally located in the cytoplasmic compartment of untreated liver cells and translocates to the nucleus after exposure <b>to</b> phenobarbital (<b>PB)</b> <b>or</b> PB-like chemicals. Previously, we identified two nuclear localization signals (NLS) in the rat constitutive androstane/active receptor (CAR), NLS 1, which is located in the hinge region, and NLS 2, which overlaps with the ligand-binding domain. However, the nuclear import mechanism of CAR is unclear. In this study, we show that nuclear import of CAR is regulated by importin/Ran-GTP systems. The regulation of CAR nuclear import by a Ran-GTP concentration gradient was confirmed using the dominant negative, GTPase-deficient form of Ran (RanQ 69 L), suggesting the involvement of transport receptors of the importinβ family.

40|$|Introduction: Heavy metal {{pollution}} of soil {{is a significant}} environmental problem having negative impact on human health and agriculture. Particularly, abandoned mining areas represent an important problem all over Europe. The Sardinian mining district (SW Sardinia, Italy) {{has been a major}} source of Pb and Zn in Europe since its closure in the mid- 19 th century. Then, the whole mining complex was abandoned resulting in contamination of the area. Phytoremediation is an emerging technology that uses plants and their associated microorganisms for soil remediation of both organic and inorganic contaminants. Plant-associated microorganisms {{play an important role in}} the phytoremediation process by affecting heavy metal mobility and availability to the plant and increasing heavy metal tolerance and plant growth. Bioaugmentation-assisted phytoremediation is a promising method for the cleaning-up of soils contaminated by metals. Objectives: Actually, there is a need to improve our understanding of the mechanisms involved in plant promotion and to select plant growth-promoting bacteria for specific restoration programmes. The relevance of natural resources of the Sardinian mining district and its touristic importance require the preservation of the local biodiversity. Thus, the objective of this work is the characterization of bacterial community associated to autochthonous plant species. Results: In a previous study, Scrophularia canina subsp. bicolor and Pistacia lentiscus were identified as autochthonous plant species suitable for phytoremediation of the Sardinian mining district.

The images produced by the techniques give {{new insights into the}} structure of streamers, are useful to unravel the complex topology of the solar maximum corona, and can help make connections between coronal and solar disk features. CMEs are seen in striking de- tail out to ? 18 R. The quality of imaging produced by missions such as Solar Orbiter have a strong influence on the impact of that mission, and the solar remote sensing instrumentation, in particular the EUV imager and coro- nagraph, can maximize their scientific effectiveness by employing the new processing techniques...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} the liver-tumor {{promoters}} phenobarbital (PB) and ethyl-α-p-chlorophenoxyisobutyrate (CPIB) on phalloidin sensitivity of normal and preneoplastic hepatocytes were examined. Hepatocytes were isolated by a collagenase perfusion method from rats fed either 0. 05 % <b>PB</b> <b>or</b> 0. 25 % CPIB for 14 weeks, and from those treated for 12 weeks with these agents followed by 2 -week withdrawal of the agents. Preneoplastic hepatocytes were isolated from enucleated nodules induced by the Solt-Farber method in the livers of rats, either treated or not treated with <b>PB</b> <b>or</b> CPIB. The phalloidin sensitivity of hepatocytes of the rats treated with <b>PB</b> <b>or</b> CPIB deceased, showing 73 to 90 % of the control value in the former and 88 to 97 % in the latter, depending on the concentration of phalloidin. After the 2 -week withdrawal of the agents, the sensitivity recovered completely. The sensitivity of the preneoplastic hepatocytes of rats treated with <b>PB</b> <b>or</b> CPIB were far less sensitive to phalloidin than the untreated preneoplastic cells. The sensitivity was 28 to 54 % in the preneoplastic cells of PB-treated and 54 to 59 % in the cells of CPIB-treated rats compared to the values in the untreated preneoplastic cells. After the 2 -week withdrawal of <b>PB</b> <b>or</b> CPIB, the sensitivity increased but was not completely recovered. Thus, preneoplastic hepatocytes were more susceptible <b>to</b> <b>PB</b> and CPIB than normal hepatocytes. Histological examinations showed that PB and CPIB promoted preneoplastic lesions in the livers. The enhanced susceptibility is suggested {{to be responsible for}} the promotion of hepatocarcinogenesis...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} the short-chain fatty acid, 4 -phenylbutyrate (PB), {{has emerged as a}} {{promising}} drug for various clinical conditions. In fact, PB has been Food and Drug Administration-approved for urea cycle disorders since 1996. PB is more potent and less toxic than its metabolite, phenylacetate (PA), and is not just a pro-drug for PA, as was initially assumed. The metabolic pathway of PB, however, has remained unclear. Therefore, we set out to identify the enzymes involved in the beta-oxidation of PB. We used cells deficient in specific steps of fatty acid beta-oxidation and ultra-HPLC to measure which enzymes were able <b>to</b> convert <b>PB</b> <b>or</b> its downstream products. We show that the first step in PB oxidation is catalyzed solely by the enzyme, medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. The second (hydration) step can be catalyzed by all three mitochondrial enoyl-CoA hydratase enzymes, i. e., short-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase, long-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase, and 3 -methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase. Enzymes involved in the third step include both short-and long-chain 3 -hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase. The oxidation of PB is completed by only one enzyme, i. e., long-chain 3 -ketoacyl-CoA thiolase. (jlr) Taken together, the enzymatic characteristics of the PB degradative pathway may lead to better dose finding and limiting the toxicity of this dru...|$|R
40|$|The crystal {{chemical}} {{features of}} the new series of compounds R 6 Mg 23 C with R = La-Sm or Gd and Ce 6 Mg 23 Z with Z = C, Si, Ge, Sn, <b>Pb,</b> P, As, <b>or</b> <b>Sb</b> have been studied by means of single-crystal and powder X-ray diffraction techniques. All phases crystallize with the cubic Zr 6 Zn 23 Si prototype (cF 120, space group Fm 3 m, Z = 4), a filled variant of the Th 6 Mn 23 structure. While no Th 6 Mn 23 -type binary rare earth-magnesium compound is known to exist, {{the addition of a}} third element Z (only 3 atom %), located into the octahedral cavity of the Th 6 Mn 23 cell (Wyckoff site 4 a), stabilizes this structural arrangement and makes possible the formation of the ternary R 6 Mg 23 Z compounds. The results of both structural and topological analyses as well as of LMTO electronic structure calculations show that the interstitial element plays {{a crucial role in the}} stability of these phases, forming a strongly bonded [R 6 Z] octahedral moiety spaced by zeolite cage-like [Mg 45] clusters. Considering these two building units, the crystal structure of these apparently complex intermetallics can be simplified to the NaCl-type topology. Moreover, a structural relationship between RMg 3 and R 6 Mg 23 C compounds has been unveiled; the latter can be described as substitutional derivatives of the former. The geometrical distortions and the consequent symmetry reduction that accompany this transformation are explicitly described by means of the Bärnighausen formalism within group theory...|$|R
40|$|The Lead-Bismuth {{eutectic}} (LBE) {{has been}} determined from previous experimental studies by the Russians and the European scientific community to be a potential material {{that can be used}} as a spallation target and coolant for the AAA proposed application. Properly controlling the oxygen content in LBE can drastically reduce the LBE corrosion to structural steels. However, existing knowledge of material corrosion performance was obtained from point-wise testing with only very sparse experimental data. Scientists have noticed that the concentration of oxygen dissolved in the liquid alloy could control the corrosion rate of steels exposed <b>to</b> <b>Pb</b> <b>or</b> Pb-Bi. At high oxygen concentration, an oxide layer could be formed on the steel surface (lead oxides are less stable than iron oxide), which protects it from corrosion. At low oxygen concentration, there is no oxidation and corrosion occurs by dissolution of the steel components in the liquid metal. The surface of the oxide layer in contact with the bulk flow of liquid metal may also be eroded under a high fluid velocity. Then the surface of the metal will no longer be protected because a porous oxide layer will be formed. The first subtask of this project involves using a CFD code (3 -D simulation) such as STAR-CD to obtain averaged values of stream wise velocity, temperature, oxygen and corrosion product concentrations at a location deemed close to the walls of the LBE loop at more than one axial location along it. The oxygen and corrosion product inside the test loop will be simulated to participate in chemical reactions with the eutectic fluid as it diffuses through towards the walls. Details of the geometry of these loops will be obtained from scientists at LANL. These values will act as a set of starting boundary conditions to the second task. The second subtask and the more important objective of this project is to use the information supplied by the first task as boundary conditions for the kinetic modeling of the corrosion process at the internal walls of the test loop. The outcome of the modeling will be fed back to the first subtask, and the steady state corrosion/precipitation in an oxygen controlled LBE system will be investigated through iterations. The information is hoped to shed some light on the likely locations for corrosion and precipitation along the axial length of parts of the test loop...|$|R
40|$|Conazoles are {{fungicides}} used {{to control}} fungal growth in environmental settings and to treat humans with fungal infec-tions. Mouse hepatotumorigenic conazoles display {{many of the same}} hepatic toxicologic responses as the mouse liver carcinogen phenobarbital (PB) : constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) activation, hypertrophy, Cyp 2 b induction, and increased cell proliferation. The goal {{of this study was to}} apply transcriptional analyses to hepatic tissues from mice exposed <b>to</b> <b>PB,</b> propicona-zole (Pro) <b>or</b> triadimefon (Tri) at tumorigenic exposure levels to reveal similarities and differences in response among these treatments. Mice were administered diets containing PB (850 ppm), Pro (2500 ppm), or Tri (1800 ppm) for 4 and 30 days. Targeted transcriptomic analyses were conducted at the gene level examining differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and subsets of DEGs: cell cycle genes, and transcription factors. Analyses were also conducted on function, pathway and network levels examining Ingenuity Pathway Analysis Tox Lists and Canonical Pathways, and Gene-Go MetaCore dynamic networks and their central hubs. Genes expressed by <b>PB</b> <b>or</b> the two conazoles were also compared with those genes associated with human hepato-cellular cancer. The results from these analyses indicated greater differences between PB and the two conazoles than similarities. Significant commonalities between the two conazole treatments were also noted. We posit that the transcriptional profiles of tissues exposed to toxic chemicals inherently contain their mechanisms of toxicity. We conclude that although PB and these 2 conazoles induce mouse liver tumors and exhibit similar toxicological responses, their transcriptional profiles are signifi-cantly different and thus their mechanisms of tumorigenic action are likely to differ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} search for {{standard}} model Higgs boson production in association with a W boson in proton-antiproton collisions (pp→W±H→ℓνbb) at a center of mass energy of 1. 96 TeV. The search employs data collected with the CDF II detector that correspond to an integrated luminosity of approximately 1. 9 [*][*]fb− 1. We select events consistent with a signature of a single charged lepton (e±/μ±), missing transverse energy, and two jets. Jets corresponding to bottom quarks are identified with a secondary vertex tagging method, a jet probability tagging method, and a neural network filter. We use kinematic information in an artificial neural network to improve discrimination between signal and background compared to previous analyses. The observed number of events and the neural network output distributions {{are consistent with the}} standard model background expectations, and we set 95 % confidence level upper limits on the production cross section times branching fraction ranging from 1. 2 <b>to</b> 1. 1 <b>pb</b> <b>or</b> 7. 5 <b>to</b> 102 times the standard model expectation for Higgs boson masses from 110 to 150 [*][*]GeV/c 2, respectively...|$|R
