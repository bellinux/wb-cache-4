5|$|Flower, Sun, and Rain {{forms the}} final {{part of an}} {{unofficial}} trilogy with Moonlight Syndrome, a spin-off of the Twilight Syndrome series Suda's final work for Human Entertainment, and <b>The</b> <b>Silver</b> Case. According to Suda, while they use the same setting and have some recurring characters, there is otherwise no connection. Despite acting as a sequel to <b>The</b> <b>Silver</b> Case, and featuring a version of that game's protagonist Sumio Kodai, the story was almost completely unrelated {{to the events of}} <b>The</b> <b>Silver</b> Case. This approach was inspired by the Star System utilized by manga artist Osamu Tezuka. The opening scene, where Mondo drives his car towards the island, was put into the game to both introduce Mondo's character to newcomers, and to throw players of <b>The</b> <b>Silver</b> Case off guard and confirm Mondo's two different identities in the two games. It also helped establish the setting and get the player used to Mondo's point of view. His portable computer Catherine, stored in a suitcase, was a reference to the events of <b>The</b> <b>Silver</b> Case due to earlier events being concentrated within it. Despite this, its silver color was coincidental rather than a deliberate reference to the previous game's title.|$|E
5|$|Flower, Sun, and Rain was conceived, directed, {{designed}} and co-written by studio founder Goichi Suda. Production began in 1999 following {{the release of}} <b>The</b> <b>Silver</b> Case, the studio's debut title. Multiple staff from <b>The</b> <b>Silver</b> Case returned, including co-writer Masashi Ooka and character designer Takashi Miyamoto. Returning composer Masafumi Takada co-wrote the score with Shingo Yasumoto. The PS2 version remained exclusive to Japan, while the DS version received an international release. The original version was positively reviewed, but the DS release received mixed to negative reviews from critics.|$|E
5|$|Flower, Sun, and Rain was {{developed}} by Grasshopper Manufacture. The game was conceived by studio founder Goichi Suda, beginning development in 1999 after completion of the studio's debut title <b>The</b> <b>Silver</b> Case. The staff number for <b>The</b> <b>Silver</b> Case was under ten people and thus they had to adjust their development goals based on that. For Flower, Sun, and Rain five or six more people were involved and thus the scope was increased, such as including exploration and action elements. According to Suda, Flower, Sun, and Rain {{was part of the}} studio's transition towards more action-oriented titles. While <b>The</b> <b>Silver</b> Case was published on the original PlayStation, that console was nearing the end of its viable life cycle, so Flower, Sun, and Rain {{was developed}} for the PlayStation 2 (PS2). Flower, Sun, and Rain moved away from the purely text-driven structure of <b>The</b> <b>Silver</b> Case, but it still carried over many of the previous game's themes and concepts. As with <b>The</b> <b>Silver</b> Case, Suda wanted to include puzzles, but felt that he had gone too far with the variety and challenge of puzzles within <b>The</b> <b>Silver</b> Case. Instead, Suda created a single puzzle system revolving around numerical combinations, which both simplified puzzles and tied in with Mondo's character.|$|E
