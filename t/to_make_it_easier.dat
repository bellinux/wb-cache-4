5|$|Agricultural {{improvement}} and the Industrial Revolution came to Aberdaron in the 19th century. The Inclosure (Consolidation) Act 1801 was intended <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> for landlords to enclose and improve common land, introduce increased efficiency, bring more land under the plough, {{and reduce the}} high prices of agricultural production. Rhoshirwaun Common, following strong opposition, was enclosed in 1814; while the process was not completed in Aberdaron, Llanfaelrhys and Y Rhiw until 1861. On the industrial front, mining developed as {{a major source of}} employment, especially at Y Rhiw, where manganese was discovered in 1827.|$|E

5|$|Stelmach {{clashed with}} rural landowners again in 2009 when his {{government}} introduced the Land Assembly Project Area Act, designed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> {{for the government}} to acquire large blocks of land for public purposes such as ring roads or reservoirs. The Act allowed the government to identify land that it may be interested in expropriating {{at some point in the}} future and to indefinitely prohibit any development on that land that could conflict with the government's purposes. Despite vigorous opposition from landowners and the opposition parties, the bill passed the legislature in late April.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the subway}} was built, the Bloor {{streetcar}} line operated {{along the route}} between Jane Street and Luttrell Avenue. Paired PCC streetcars or multiple units (MUs) operated from 1950 {{to the opening of}} the subway line in 1966. The TTC favoured this route because the Prince Edward Viaduct made it easier to build a subway across the Don Valley, and the streetcar that ran along the route was filled with passengers travelling from East York and Scarborough. To provide relief to this streetcar line and <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> to expand into the suburbs, the line was built under Bloor street and Danforth Avenue.|$|E
5|$|Chapman also {{advocated}} {{the use of}} white footballs and numbered shirts, as well as adding hoops to Arsenal's socks <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> for players to pick each other out. He later made a further change to Arsenal's kit, adding white sleeves to the previously all-red shirt and brightening the colour, before a match against Liverpool on 4 March 1933; the same kit theme of red with white sleeves or trim survives to this day. The tradition of both teams walking out together at the FA Cup Final was started in 1930 due to Herbert Chapman's involvement with both clubs, and has continued since.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, {{the state}} {{legislature}} began to reform the laws that governed the production of alcoholic beverages. With {{the passing of the}} New Jersey Farm Winery Act in 1981, and laws providing for licenses for brewpubs and microbreweries in the 1990s, these two industries have grown significantly and the number of wineries and breweries have steadily increased. In February 2013, New Jersey issued the first new distillery license since before Prohibition, and legislation has been proposed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> to establish craft distilleries in New Jersey. , New Jersey currently has 48 wineries, 28 breweries, and 2 distilleries.|$|E

5|$|In late July 1943, No.1 Wing's {{headquarters}} was disbanded <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> {{to deploy}} the Spitfire squadrons to different areas {{as the need}} arose. Under the new command arrangements, the squadrons reported directly to the North-Western Area's headquarters for administrative purposes and No.5 Fighter Sector Headquarters controlled all fighter operations. This change also aimed to end the confusion which existed at the time between whether the wing leader or senior ground controller in the fighter sector headquarters was responsible for directing the Spitfires during battle. No.5 Fighter Sector Headquarters was redesignated No.1 Wing on 25September when Wing Commander Peter Jeffrey assumed command from Caldwell, who had been appointed No.2 Operational Training Unit's chief flying instructor. The headquarters' role remained unchanged.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} Rurouni Kenshin kanzenban, {{published}} in Japan in July 2006, Watsuki included a draft page featuring a redesign of Kenshin's character. To make his X-shaped scar more notable, Watsuki made {{it long enough}} to cross his nose. Kenshin's hair is tied in two tails, which are flowing {{to make him look}} younger, and shorter, and less androgynous. Watsuki also added a Habaki to Kenshin's sword <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> to draw by simplifying its structure, while also emphasizing strength. Kenshin's hitokiri look was also redesigned slightly, by making his clothes more worn and giving him Yukishiro Tomoe's neck scarf.|$|E
5|$|Knowing {{that his}} {{reputation}} {{was at stake}} following the much publicised Tora! Tora! Tora! debacle, Kurosawa moved quickly to a new project to prove he was still viable. To his aid came friends and famed directors Keisuke Kinoshita, Masaki Kobayashi and Kon Ichikawa, who together with Kurosawa established in July 1969 a production company called the Club of the Four Knights (Yonki no kai). Although the plan was for the four directors to create a film each, {{it has been suggested}} that the real motivation for the other three directors was <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> for Kurosawa to successfully complete a film, and therefore find his way back into the business.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{developed}} as a method to detect flaws or irregularities in magnetic materials, magnetic particle inspection {{can be used on}} firearms to visualize the serial number underneath the obliterated area. When performing this technique, examiners place the weapon in a magnetic field. The irregularities in the metal, in this case the serial number, cause the field to deform. When a solution of ferrous particles is added to the weapon's magnetized surface they will be attracted to the area where the magnetic field has deformed and will build up in the area. If fluorescent particles are added to the ferrous solution, ultraviolet light can be used <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> to visualize any recovered serial number.|$|E
5|$|Several press {{accounts}} {{reported that}} Timoshenko {{was shot by}} an unlicensed gun that came from Virginia. Previous reports indicated that the gun dealer had previously been indicted for his illegal gun sales, and that all the weapons found in the BMW were illegally obtained. The gun shop in question is now closed, and the dealer has been stripped of his license. Because the gun was used by {{a person with a}} criminal history, and because the NYPD was denied requests to look up the seller of the gun, legislators sought <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> for law enforcement to carry out their investigative duties.|$|E
5|$|The Oakwood City Council {{wanted the}} Playhouse as a {{community}} center.

When Talbott Realty proved reluctant to sell, the United States Army Corps of Engineers condemned the property, which became Unit IV on 15 February 1944. Remodeling began on 17 March and the Production Group began moving in on 1 June. Three guard houses were added, along with a wire fence. Changes to the site were minimized in order <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> to restore later.

5|$|The {{original}} pie in {{the legend}} included sand eels, horse mackerel, pilchards, herring, dogfish and ling along with a seventh fish. In a traditional pie, the primary ingredient is the pilchard (sardine), although mackerel or herring {{is used as a}} substitute. Richard Stevenson, chef at The Ship Inn in Mousehole, suggests that any white fish will work for the filling, with pilchards or herring just added for the presentation. Prior to putting it in the pie the fish should be skinned and boned (except the head and tail) <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> to eat. Along with the fish, the other traditional ingredients are thickened milk, eggs and boiled potatoes.|$|E
5|$|The two {{companies}} made some basic {{changes to the}} design <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> to produce and a final design was ready in May 1942. The Sperry T-1 was fully compatible with UK-built versions and a T-1 computer could be used with a Mk. XIV sight head or vice versa. Full production commenced at the AC plant in Flint, Michigan, in November and T-1s arrived in the UK from March 1943. The sights were sent to medium bombers like the Wellington, while UK-built versions {{were sent to the}} heavy bombers. In August 1943, George Mann of AC Spark Plug visited the UK for a period of about a year, liaising with RAE Farnborough, Boscombe Down and the Ministry of Aircraft Production.|$|E
5|$|During the game's development, Harmonix {{only used}} low-fidelity {{versions}} of the remasters, which were sufficient for programming and note charting; Apple Corps feared that the leak of any high-fidelity remastered track from Abbey Road studios {{would lead to the}} unauthorized use of samples of the Beatles' music in remixes. High-fidelity {{versions of the}} songs were not implemented until the final publishing of the game. Harmonix performed very little additional remixing upon receipt of these remasters; in some cases, three different guitar parts—lead, solo, and rhythm—were brought into a single cohesive guitar part, slightly raising the volume of the specific guitar track that was used in note tracking <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> for the player to follow in the game.
