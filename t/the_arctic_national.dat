40|$|For {{more about}} the East-West Center, see [URL] <b>The</b> <b>Arctic</b> in World Affairs: A North Pacific Dialogue on International Cooperation in a Changing Arctic {{addresses}} future cooperation in five areas: patterns of <b>Arctic</b> investment, <b>national</b> <b>Arctic</b> strategies, Arctic state/non-Arctic state engagement, innovations applicable to <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> and indigenous responses to Arctic development. Bringing together prominent experts from the three North Pacific Arctic coastal states (Canada, Russia, and the United States) and three leading North Pacific non-Arctic states (China, Japan, and Korea), the book goes beyond generalities; it attempts to identify and {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} innovative measures that will contribute to maintaining <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> as a zone of peace and promoting sustainable development in this region. Regarding patterns of <b>Arctic</b> investment, <b>the</b> book addresses <b>Arctic</b> natural resource development and linkages to global markets using Arctic shipping as a prominent example, but also taking a broader perspective on business and the investment environment in <b>the</b> <b>Arctic.</b> On <b>national</b> <b>Arctic</b> strategies, <b>the</b> book compares <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>Arctic</b> strategies of key Arctic states (Canada, Russia, and the U. S.) and those of key non-Arctic states (China, Japan, Korea), focusing on the main themes of these strategies and prospects for their implementation. Comparing <b>national</b> <b>Arctic</b> strategies will provide an understanding of the driving forces and interests behind Arctic policy formulation. In <b>the</b> case of <b>Arctic</b> state/non-Arctic state engagement, the book examines the efforts of non-Arctic states {{to play a role in}} addressing <b>Arctic</b> issues. <b>The</b> book briefly identifies areas of interest and priority issues for China, Japan, and Korea, and will review any previous experiences with <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> Council working groups (AMAP, PAME, EPPR, SDWG, CAFF and ACAP) and other subsidiary bodies. On innovations applicable to <b>the</b> <b>Arctic,</b> <b>the</b> book reviews developments in the area of R&D and explore their implications for <b>the</b> development of <b>Arctic</b> infrastructure. Regarding indigenous responses to <b>Arctic</b> development, <b>the</b> book devotes special attention to enhancing the understanding of non-Arctic actors regarding Arctic peoples and exploring opportunities for cooperation across this divide. Now that Korea, Japan and China are Arctic Council non-Arctic state observers, the new reality for these nations is that there are six indigenous groups sitting at the table with <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> states as Permanent Participants (and most are joining in the work of the technical working groups). The book attempts to fill gaps in knowledge regarding <b>the</b> maritime <b>Arctic,</b> identifying remaining uncertainties, and developing policy innovations that can promote peaceful and sustainable uses of <b>Arctic</b> resources in <b>the</b> future...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 This study {{relies on}} social science {{research}} on the causal mechanisms of capacity improvement to assess multilateral, environmental interventions in <b>the</b> Russian <b>Arctic.</b> <b>The</b> case studies reveal the occasions wherein target linking, commitment making, behavioral influence, and knowledge production played significant roles in influencing Russian institutions to take sustainable, environmental action. This theoretical basis enables an assessment of <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> Council’s unique use of knowledge production as a mechanism of influence. This assessment is achieved through {{a case study in}} the Council’s first and only major intervention into <b>the</b> Russian <b>Arctic,</b> <b>the</b> <b>National</b> Program of Action (NPA). Unlike other Council programs that coordinate multilateral research, the NPA tried to intervene directly into Russian policy-making by transferring the knowledge it generated into recommended regulations. However, none of these draft laws were ever passed. The study concludes that Russia accepts new environmental commitments, adapts its environmental targets, and acts on new knowledge when doing so intersects candidly with interests that are connected to Russian economics and defense...|$|R
