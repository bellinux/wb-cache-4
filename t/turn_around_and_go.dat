2500|$|According to {{the legend}} of Ɓoxo-koƥ (dog of the forest or [...] "wild dog" [...] (figuritively) - jackal), the jackal was the first living thing created by the supreme deity Roog. The jackal circled {{the world in a}} day and two of its hands were {{transformed}} into paws. [...] The supreme being gave it the ngud tree (guiera senegalensis) and thus ngud became the first tree and the second thing created by Roog. After the creation of ngud, the nalafun tree (combretum paniculatum) was created to whom the deity told: [...] "Go and keep the ngud tree company, it is lonely". During the life cycle of the nalafun, the tree grow so tall that it headed towards the sky. The supreme being considered that an affront and gave it a sharp flick on the head (mak in Serer) and told it: [...] "You are rude. Go! <b>Turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> back to where you've just came from". After that event, the nalafun never grew tall as it once did and was always bent.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, Anderson {{participated in}} the SBS doco-reality show Go Back To Where You Came From, in which six Australians, each with differing {{opinions}} on Australia's asylum seeker debate, were taken on a journey to which refugees have taken to reach Australia. At {{the outset of the}} series Anderson says that [...] "boat people" [...] who arrive in Australia illegally should be sent back to their countries of origin: [...] "If you come here illegally, I don't care about your story, first thing you do is you <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> back." [...] Later in the series, after having met with refugees from Afghanistan who settled in Melbourne as well as visiting war-torn Kabul, Anderson softened his stand on the subject: [...] "Now I've been here and spoken to people, I don't want to turn away refugees, I don't want to turn away people who need to be reunited with their families. I don't want that. Who would want that? [...] I don't want people to go on suffering needlessly, when we can give them somewhere safe to be. But I don't want them to come to Australia in boats." ...|$|E

50|$|After leaving ONS-251 at New York, W-2 <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> northward with HXF-310. Relieved by W-3, {{the ships}} entered Halifax on the 25th.

6000|$|... "Well, then, {{what are}} you doing on this road? You know it is closed. You haven't any right on it at all--you or anybody else. You <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> back, just as quick as you can." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would give}} me a sad turn, sir," [...] said Baragat, [...] "to see you spend Christmas at sea; a thing you never did before, nor ever shall do, if I can help it. If you'll take my advice, sir, you'll <b>turn</b> <b>around,</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> back. It's a shorter {{distance}} to the port we started from than to the one we are going to, and if we turn back now, I am sure we all shall be on shore before the holidays." ...|$|E
5000|$|... “Grim omens…Premonitory {{dreams and}} waking fantasies {{prior to the}} events of 9/11”, and “synchronous {{experiences}} that saved their lives: people who reported inexplicable dread or sudden illness that kept them away from their jobs; people who ‘simply’ <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> home, inexplicably, before any of the events at the WTC or pentagon occurred.” ...|$|R
2500|$|At that time, {{he started}} for the Red river {{district}} of Minnesota, but the Indians were a source of constant menace {{at the time and}} the adventurous lad decided it would be best not to attempt to personally annihilate them, <b>and</b> accordingly <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> to the southern states in 1862. [...] This was the same year that the Minnesota massacre occurred.|$|R
5000|$|On Monday, September 7, 1885, {{at about}} 4 o'clock, {{another group of}} about thirty Chinese started to enter Squak Valley and were met at George W. Tibbetts' store {{by a group of}} white men and Indians. The crowd intimidated the {{arriving}} Chinese, who <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> back the way they came. [...] There are no known reports of who was in the group of men that turned the Chinese away.|$|R
60|$|The {{mountain}} {{side was}} so steep {{that the entire}} town had a slant to it like a roof. Each street was a terrace, and from each to the next street below the descent was forty or fifty feet. The fronts of the houses were level with the street they faced, but their rear first floors were propped on lofty stilts; a man could stand at a rear first floor window of a C street house and look down the chimneys of the row of houses below him facing D street. It was a laborious climb, in that thin atmosphere, to ascend from D to A street, and you were panting and out of breath when you got there; but you could <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> down again like a house a-fire--so to speak. The atmosphere was so rarified, {{on account of the}} great altitude, that one's blood lay near the surface always, and the scratch of a pin was a disaster worth worrying about, for the chances were that a grievous erysipelas would ensue. But to offset this, the thin atmosphere seemed to carry healing to gunshot wounds, and therefore, to simply shoot your adversary through both lungs was a thing not likely to afford you any permanent satisfaction, for he would be nearly certain to be around looking for you within the month, and not with an opera glass, either.|$|E
6000|$|I did not {{immediately}} fix a date for my departure, for {{it was necessary for}} me to consider my grandmother's feelings and welfare, and arrange to make her as happy as possible while I should be gone. In the mean time, it was of course necessary that I should take air and exercise; and while doing this one morning in a pretty lane, just out of the village, a figure in the House of Martha gray came into sight a little distance ahead of me. Her back was toward me, and she was walking slower than I was. [...] "Now, then," [...] thought I, [...] "here is a proof of the awkwardness of my position here. Even in a little walk like this, I must run up against one of those sisters. I must pass her, or <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> back, for I shall not slow up, and appear to be dogging her footsteps. But I shall not turn back,--that does not suit me." [...] Consequently I walked on, and soon overtook the woman in gray. She did not turn her head as I approached, for the sisters are taught not to turn their heads to look at people. After all, it would be easy enough for me to adopt the same rule, and to pass her without turning my head, or paying the slightest attention to her. This was the manner indeed in which the general public was expected to act toward the inmates of the House of Martha when met outside their institution.|$|E
50|$|In its inaugural year, the school's {{football}} team lost every game. The school years 1969 and 1970 saw the school's {{football team}} make a complete <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> {{on to win}} bi-district both years.|$|E
5|$|That evening, D Company {{loaded into}} trucks {{traveled}} {{north to the}} assembly area through a heavy rain. On the way they met two truckloads of South Korean police going south, some of them wounded. These were the police who, together with the detachment of the I Platoon, had been driven off Ka-san that afternoon. After waiting in the rain awhile for orders, the Engineer company <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> back to camp.|$|R
2500|$|The Wigwam in Ladysmith {{raised the}} price from 5 cents to 8 cents, a 62% price {{increase}}! Sixteen-year-old Parker Williams and his school chums were outraged. That increase represented a significant cost increase when the average allowance for a teenager {{was less than}} a dollar. Signs were painted, Parker actually decorated his old car, a 1923 McLaughlin. A parade was staged, and it was so successful they actually <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> back up the street.|$|R
5000|$|Checote then summoned Pleasant Porter {{home from}} Washington D.C., {{and put him}} in charge of the light horsemen. In February 1883, the Nuyaka forces were {{defeated}} by the Checote forces in an armed skirmish in a peach orchard. The action was thereafter known as the [...] "Peach Orchard War." [...] Porter's men pursued the Nuyaka men as they fled west through the Sac and Fox territory. Then, Porter's troops <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> back to Okmulgee.|$|R

50|$|In June 2006, sixteen-year-old American Katherine Lester {{flew to the}} Middle East, to Tel Aviv, Israel, {{after having}} tricked her parents into getting her a {{passport}} {{in order to be}} with a twenty-year-old man she met through Myspace.

50|$|In most episodes {{early in}} the show's first season on Lifetime, costumed {{characters}} such as Frankenstein's monster, a gorilla or a creature named Mr. Yuck ran through the aisles during the Sweep. If the character came near a contestant or vice versa, the contestant had to <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> in the other direction.

5000|$|The {{original}} {{inhabitants of}} the area were the indigenous Tongva people (after 1771 referred to by the Spanish missionaries as [...] "Gabrieleño" [...] {{because they were in}} the jurisdiction of Mission San Gabriel). The first Europeans to visit the area were members of the Portola expedition of 1769. The expedition sought to follow the coastline, but were stopped by the coastal cliffs of the Santa Monica Mountains. The next day they <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> inland, finding a way north through Sepulveda Canyon.|$|R
5000|$|Klaus' {{approach}} {{was supported by}} the head of protocol in the Office of the Czech President, Jindřich Forejt, who described the incident as [...] "incredible". Former spokesman for President Václav Havel, Ladislav Špaček, said that [...] "it is absolutely out of place to check a head of state; it is disrespectful. I am not at all surprised that Klaus <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> off. He should not be there trying to argue with some operative that he is not a terrorist." ...|$|R
50|$|Located on the {{northeast}} corner of Kingsessing Avenue and Cemetery Avenue, there is a loop there for trolleys that do not go on the full route to Yeadon or Darby to <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> back to Center City Philadelphia.

5000|$|The show {{sits on the}} {{boundary}} between musical and song cycle, but it is neither; it is an abstract musical, a series of songs all connected by a theme: [...] "the moment of decision." [...] The show employs four performers who do not literally play the same characters throughout the show but who do have consistently developing character arcs nonetheless. Composer Jason Robert Brown has said of his show, [...] "It's about one moment. It's about hitting the wall and having to make a choice, or take a stand, or <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> back." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{windows of}} the long, low ranch-house were bright squares in the blackness, sending cheerful rays afar. Columbine {{wondered}} in trepidation if Jack Belllounds had come home. It required effort of will to approach the house. Yet since she must meet him, the sooner the ordeal was over the better. Nevertheless she tiptoed past the bright windows, <b>and</b> <b>went</b> all {{the length of the}} long porch, <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> back, <b>and</b> then hesitated, fighting a slow drag of her spirit, an oppression upon her heart. The door was crude and heavy. It opened hard.|$|R
500|$|At Homer's Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, he is {{kicked out}} by Reverend Lovejoy after confessing that his desperation for {{the taste of}} beer led him to [...] "sneak into the {{football}} stadium and eat the dirt underneath the bleachers". But he exhibits more positive changes such as losing weight, saving over $100 and no longer sweating while he eats. After thirty days of sobriety, Homer attempts {{to go back to}} Moe's. Instead, after seeing how alcohol has ruined the lives of Barney and the other barflies, he <b>turns</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>goes</b> home.

50|$|On May 24, Ellsworth led the 11th New York {{across the}} Potomac {{and into the}} streets of Alexandria uncontested. He {{detached}} some men to take the railroad station while he led others to secure the telegraph office. On his way there, Ellsworth turned a corner and {{came face to face}} with the Marshall House Inn, atop of which the banner was still flying. He ordered a company of infantry as reinforcements and continued on his way to the telegraph office. But suddenly, Ellsworth changed his mind, <b>turned</b> <b>around,</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> up the steps of the Marshall House.|$|R
5000|$|Knowing that Widerad {{would insist}} on the status he had been granted at Christmas, Hezilo had {{prepared}} for a fight, placing armed men in position behind the altar {{under the leadership of}} Egbert of Brunswick. When they heard that the dispute had escalated again in the nave, they drove the Abbot of Fulda from the church, using their clubs. These armed men then took it upon themselves to <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> back to church.

50|$|A {{person may}} {{have a duty to}} act when he begins to act but then stops. This {{situation}} typically arises in the hypothetical where a person is drowning. One bystander among many starts swimming out to rescue him but simply changes his mind halfway and decides to <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> back to shore alone. The rationale for holding the bystander culpable is that the other bystanders did nothing because of his act. If the bystander had been the only person around, he would not be causing others not to assist, so he would not be culpable.|$|E
50|$|It {{took the}} battery of G5s {{three days to}} break the offensive. Unita was left at Cuito Cuanavale, to keep control, and the battery of G5s were already retreating, {{when they had to}} <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> back, as Unita were chased out of Cuito Cuanavale by re-enforcements of Cuban and FAPLA forces. The battery of G5s then started another {{full-scale}} attack, taking out the re-enforcements as well. The battery of G5s then blew up a landing strip the Angolans used as an attack platform for their Migs, and an ammo-base, which exploded for hours, and burned for two-to-three days.|$|E
50|$|It was {{a blessing}} that I <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> home in 1947, because in 1948 they went to {{overhand}} pitching, she explained. I never pitched softball, so I couldn't have pitched sidearm or underhand. Asked what kind of pitches she threw most of the time, she replied, High and tight! Laughing, she said, I had a good fastball and a 'nickel' curve. I could throw the ball past most of them, but I got accused of pitching 'high and tight.' When my fastball went in really good, it tailed in toward the right-handed batters. She also hurled a changeup {{to go along with}} her blazing fastball and tricky curve.|$|R

50|$|The {{music video}} for the song, {{directed}} by Pedro Romhanyi, is filmed completely {{in black and}} white and features only the band (along with two trumpet players and a trombone player), performing at night on the rooftop of a building in the central business district of downtown Los Angeles. Halfway through the video, Rob Thomas steps onto {{the edge of the roof}} and spreads his arms like he's going to jump. He doesn't; he <b>turns</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>goes</b> back to where the band is playing. Near the end of the video, the sun dawns and illuminates the rooftop and surrounding buildings of the city.|$|R
