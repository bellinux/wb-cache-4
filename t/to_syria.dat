It {{was regarded as a}} substandard formation by the other brigades of the division, and Kippenberger set about rectifying this. While the rest of the 2nd Division moved <b>to</b> <b>Syria,</b> he and his brigade remained in Baggush, and worked on defensive fortifications for several months. In April, the brigade moved <b>to</b> <b>Syria</b> to complete the 2nd Division.|$|E

5|$|Antiochus VII Sidetes (r.138–129BC), {{a brother}} of Demetrius, assumed the Seleucid throne and married the latter's wife Cleopatra Thea. After {{defeating}} Diodotus Tryphon, Antiochus initiated a campaign in 130BC to retake Mesopotamia, {{now under the}} rule of Phraates II of Parthia (r.c.138–128BC). The Parthian general Indates was defeated along the Great Zab, followed by a local uprising where the Parthian governor of Babylonia was killed. Antiochus conquered Babylonia and occupied Susa, where he minted coins. After advancing his army into Media, the Parthians pushed for peace, which Antiochus refused to accept unless the Arsacids relinquished all lands to him except Parthia proper, paid heavy tribute, and released Demetrius from captivity. Arsaces released Demetrius and sent him <b>to</b> <b>Syria,</b> but refused the other demands. By spring 129BC, the Medes were in open revolt against Antiochus, whose army had exhausted the resources of the countryside during winter. While attempting to put down the revolts, the main Parthian force swept into the region and killed Antiochus in battle. His body was sent back <b>to</b> <b>Syria</b> in a silver coffin; his son Seleucus was made a Parthian hostage and a daughter joined Phraates' harem.|$|E

5|$|On Wednesday, Assad sent Tlass to Moscow {{to seek a}} {{comprehensive}} air umbrella.

On June 9, Assad met with American envoy Habib in Damascus and rejected his terms, demanding that Israel withdraw its forces from Lebanon as a condition for a ceasefire. US President Ronald Reagan called on Begin and Assad to accept a ceasefire effective at 6:00 AM, on June 10. By noon on Friday, when the ceasefire took effect, the IAF had shot down 82 aircraft without losing any in air combat. A year after the battle, a US fact-finding mission headed by Lieutenant-General John Chain, then deputy chief of staff for plans and operations, arrived in Israel to learn lessons from the battle.|$|E
