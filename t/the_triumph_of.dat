5|$|Critics {{have offered}} many {{explanations}} for the characters' longevity, suggesting variously that the Hardy Boys embody simple wish fulfillment, American ideals of boyhood and masculinity, a well-respected father paradoxically argued to be inept, {{and the possibility of}} <b>the</b> <b>triumph</b> <b>of</b> good over evil.|$|E

5|$|In 1821 Etty's The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also {{known as}} <b>The</b> <b>Triumph</b> <b>of</b> Cleopatra) was a {{critical}} success. The painting featured nude figures, and over the following years Etty painted further nudes in biblical, literary and mythological settings. All {{but one of the}} 15 paintings Etty exhibited in the 1820s included at least one nude figure.|$|E

Veshch will champion constructive art, whose mission is not, after all, to embellish life, but to organize it.|$|E

5|$|A christening ewer and basin {{made by the}} Garrard&Co. founder George Wickes in 1735 {{were used}} at the christening of the future GeorgeIII in 1738. His father, Frederick, Prince of Wales, had been banished from the royal court by GeorgeII and was {{forbidden}} to use the CharlesII Font. An inscription {{at the front of}} the ewer records its use at the christening of GeorgeIII's son, Prince Alfred, in 1780. The handle of the ewer is topped by a figure of Hercules slaying the Hydra, symbolising <b>the</b> <b>triumph</b> <b>of</b> virtue over vice.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>triumph</b> <b>of</b> the {{previous}} season, the 1945–46 season {{was a complete}} loss for Kennedy. He {{got off to a}} slow start, beginning the season at right wing before being returned to his center position and he also fell ill. By January Kennedy had only 5 points in 21 games and was then lost {{for the rest of the}} season due to an injury to his foot, when a Boston Bruin player's skate dug into his boot. With the Leafs also losing Captain Syl Apps to injury Toronto missed the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|Although the Colorados had {{defected}} to the Flores insurgency, {{the national guard}} continued to support the fusionist government. Blanco partisans filled its depleted ranks. They also replaced army officers who had deserted to Flores. The Blancos received aid from several Argentine Federalists who joined their cause. As in Uruguay, Argentina had long been a battleground of rival parties, and Bartolomé Mitre's victory at Pavón in 1861 had signaled <b>the</b> <b>triumph</b> <b>of</b> his Unitarian Party over the Federal Party led by Justo José de Urquiza. Mitre denied any involvement in the Flores rebellion, even though his complicity was widely known and taken for granted.|$|E

5|$|Born in London to an {{entertainer}} father, Grimaldi began to perform as a child, making his stage debut at Drury Lane in 1780. He became successful at the Sadler's Wells Theatre the following year; {{his first major}} role was as Little Clown in the pantomime <b>The</b> <b>Triumph</b> <b>of</b> Mirth; or, Harlequin's Wedding in 1781, in which he starred alongside his father. After a brief schooling, he appeared in various low-budget productions and became a sought-after child performer. He took leading parts in Valentine and Orson (1794) and The Talisman; or, Harlequin Made Happy (1796), the latter of which brought him wider recognition.|$|E
5|$|During the Second Barons' War, Boniface {{seems to}} have sided first with the English bishops against King Henry, but later he sided with Henry. In 1262, he went to France, where he excommunicated the barons {{opposing}} the king. He was not summoned to the Parliament at London in January 1265 because he was abroad. On <b>the</b> <b>triumph</b> <b>of</b> the king's party in 1265, he returned to England, arriving there in May 1266.|$|E

5|$|In September 1955, {{the sole}} {{remaining}} Pulqui II prototype was pressed into {{action in the}} Revolución Libertadora, a coup d'état led by General Eduardo Lonardi against Perón. The exact details of its participation are unknown, but when rebel forces commanded by Lonardi captured Córdoba as their first conquest, together with the Meteor F 4s fighter-bombers stationed at the Córdoba Escuela De Aviación - SACE (Military Aviation School), the IAe 33 was enlisted in the struggle. After flying combat missions against Perónist stalwarts, it later appeared in a flyover during the victory parade at Córdoba celebrating <b>the</b> <b>triumph</b> <b>of</b> the coup over loyalist forces.|$|E
5|$|Manitoba's early economy {{depended}} on mobility and {{living off the}} land. Aboriginal Nations (Cree, Ojibwa, Dene, Sioux and Assiniboine) followed herds of bison and congregated to trade among themselves at key meeting places throughout the province. After {{the arrival of the}} first European traders in the 17th century, the economy centred on the trade of beaver pelts and other furs. Diversification of the economy came when Lord Selkirk brought the first agricultural settlers in 1811, though <b>the</b> <b>triumph</b> <b>of</b> the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) over its competitors ensured the primacy of the fur trade over widespread agricultural colonization.|$|E
5|$|The Stuckists gained {{significant}} {{media coverage}} {{for eight years}} of protests (2000–2006 and 2008) outside Tate Britain against the Turner Prize, sometimes dressed as clowns. In 2001 they demonstrated in Trafalgar Square at the unveiling of Rachel Whiteread's Monument. In 2002, they carried a coffin marked The Death of Conceptual Art to the White Cube Gallery. In 2004 outside the launch of <b>The</b> <b>Triumph</b> <b>of</b> Painting at the Saatchi Gallery they wore tall hats with Charles Saatchi's face emblazoned and carried placards claiming that Saatchi had copied their ideas.|$|E

5|$|These views {{informed}} {{his novel}} Quo Vadis (1896). This story of early Christianity in Rome, with protagonists struggling against the Emperor Nero's regime, draws parallels between repressed early Christians and contemporary Poles; and, {{due to its}} focus on Christianity, it became widely popular in the Christian West. <b>The</b> <b>triumph</b> <b>of</b> spiritual Christianity over materialist Rome was a critique of materialism and decadence, and also an allegory for {{the strength of the}} Polish spirit.|$|E
5|$|A Hero's Song is musically {{structured}} like a four-movement symphony, {{beginning with}} an allegro con fuoco, transitioning {{to a slow}} poco adagio lacrimosa, then including a scherzo and concluding with a coda. The piece {{is based on a}} short, energetic theme in B minor played in the violas, cellos, and basses {{at the start of the}} piece. This theme is featured in various forms throughout the first section. Following this, a slow section is marked by quiet music which symbolizes the hero's grief. It includes a funeral march, a musical form Dvořák also used in his Requiem, Stabat Mater, and Piano Quintet No. 2. The hero recovers from his grief as the mood of the music gradually brightens and goes into B major, leading into the dance-like scherzo. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>triumph</b> <b>of</b> the hero is represented by the victorious coda. The piece has a run time of approximately 22 minutes.|$|E
