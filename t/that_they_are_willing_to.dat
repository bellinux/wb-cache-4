5|$|Redbacks usually prey on insects, but {{can capture}} larger animals that become {{entangled}} in the web, including trapdoor spiders, small lizards, and even on rare occasion snakes. One web was recorded as containing a dead mouse. The woodlouse (Porcellio scaber) is a particularly common food item. Developing spiderlings need size-appropriate prey, and laboratory studies show <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> consume common fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster), mealworm larvae (Tenebrio molitor), muscoid flies and early nymphs of cockroaches. Food scraps and lighting attract insect prey to areas of human activity, which brings the redbacks. Once alerted to a creature becoming ensnared in a trap line, the redback advances to around a leg's length from its target, touching it and squirting a liquid glutinous silk over it to immobilise it. It then bites its victim repeatedly on the head, body and leg joints and wraps it in sticky and dry silk. Unlike other spiders, it does not rotate its prey while wrapping in silk, but like other spiders, it then injects a venom that liquefies its victim's innards. Once it has trussed the prey, the redback takes it to its retreat and begins sucking out the liquefied insides, generally 5 to 20 minutes after first attacking it. Redback spiders do not usually drink, except when starved.|$|E

25|$|Ruter {{has stated}} that the {{estimated}} investment cost would be NOK10 billion, but that the tunnel would give high utility and {{would be one of}} the most economic investments they could make. There is no funding for a new tunnel in Oslo Package 3. By 2010, it was discovered that Oslo Package 3 was under-financed, and it is uncertain how much of the investment will be made by 2027. With the new tunnel being made a high priority by the city planners, this will either require additional grants from the municipality or the state, an increase in the toll fees, or the delay of investments in the program to a future Oslo Package 4. The left-wing parties have stated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> delay or abandon several road projects to allocate financing to a new tunnel, while the right-wing parties have stated that they are not willing to allow road projects to be undermined.|$|E

The novel appeals to scientific authority to justify this position; Dubois repeatedly states that his argument is mathematically demonstrable, statements which have led scholars to label the novel [...] "hard science fiction", despite its social and political themes. The [...] "moral decline" [...] caused by this situation is depicted as having caused a global war between an alliance of the U.S., Britain, and Russia against the [...] "Chinese Hegemony" [...] in the year 1987. Despite the alliance between the U.S. and Russia, this war {{has been described as}} demonstrating Heinlein's anti-communist beliefs, which saw [...] "swarming hordes" [...] of Chinese as a bigger threat. The novel draws some comparisons between the Chinese and the Arachnids, and suggests that the lessons of one war could be applied to the other.|$|E
500|$|Soon after {{returning}} to England, Phips joined back up with Increase Mather and again supported him in dealing with Whitehall. Increase Mather's diary says they are together on March 25, 1691, and again on March 26. On March 31, they are together as Increase Mather writes {{a response to the}} Board of Trade. Also at this meeting is Sir Henry Ashurst. These three—Mather the clergyman, flanked by two knights: Sir Phips & Sir Ashurst—would emerge later as the major proponents of the various compromises that brought about a new charter. Not counting Phips, there seem to have been a total of four agents acting on behalf of Massachusetts in seeking to restore the old charter. The two agents holding official commission papers from the Massachusetts council—Cooke and Oakes—were also the least compromising and the least politically deft. The Board of Trade seems to have sought a policy of pushing through a new charter by cleaving the two knights away from these two agents. July 24, Increase Mather records in his diary that he would [...] "part with my life sooner than [...] ". Not long after this Increase Mather left London on vacation. August 11, 1691, a letter was written from Whitehall to the King William's secretary: [...] "I must now desire your Lordship to acquaint the King <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> accept their Charter... and no longer Insist upon the Alterations mentioned..." [...] This could not have been Cooke and Oakes, as they never wavered in their stance opposing a new charter. Mather's diary entry one week later (August 19) indicates that he is still either unaware or has not yet accepted this move. On August 20, the Earl of Nottingham told a committee that he had been with Sir William Phips who informed him that the New England agents [...] "did acquiesce therein [...]" [...] By August 27, Increase Mather had decided to participate in the process of shaping this new charter, if reluctantly.|$|E
2500|$|Trick-or-treating is a Halloween ritual custom for {{children}} and adults in many countries. Children in costumes travel from house-to-house, asking for treats with the phrase [...] "Trick or treat". The [...] "treat" [...] is usually some form of candy, although, in some cultures, money is used instead. The [...] "trick" [...] is a usually idle threat to perform mischief on the homeowners or their property if no treat is given. Trick-or-treating usually occurs on the evening of October 31. Some homeowners signal <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> hand out treats by putting up Halloween decorations outside their doors; others simply leave treats available on their porches for the children to take freely.|$|E

You have stated--and if we were called upon to testify, Miss Markham and I would have to acknowledge that you have so stated--that you claimed this treasure as your discovery, and that it all belonged to you.

60|$|And it {{was just}} that which had most disconcerted me in my {{dealings}} with him. When people say they do not care what others think of them, {{for the most part they}} deceive themselves. Generally they mean only that they will do as they choose, in the confidence that no one will know their vagaries; and at the utmost only <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> act contrary to the opinion of the majority because they are supported by the approval of their neighbours. It is not difficult to be unconventional in the eyes of the world when your unconventionality is but the convention of your set. It affords you then an inordinate amount of self-esteem. You have the self-satisfaction of courage without the inconvenience of danger. But the desire for approbation is perhaps the most deeply seated instinct of civilised man. No one runs so hurriedly to the cover of respectability as the unconventional woman who has exposed herself to the slings and arrows of outraged propriety. I do not believe the people who tell me they do not care a row of pins for the opinion of their fellows. It is the bravado of ignorance. They mean only that they do not fear reproaches for peccadillos which they are convinced none will discover.|$|E

Major Anderson deserves more than ever the thanks of his country for his wise forbearance.

And as for Mr Croft, I suppose I should get a letter from him if he knew where to write, but you know, Freddy, we are travelling about on this wedding tour without letting anybody, especially Mr Croft, know exactly where we are. He must think it an awfully wonderful piece of good luck that a young married couple should happen to be journeying in the very direction taken by a gentleman whom he wants to find, and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> look for the gentleman without charging anything but the extra expenses to which they may be put.

We don't want him to employ anybody else. We want to find Junius Keswick before he does, and then, maybe, we won't want Mr Croft to find him at all. But I hope it will not turn out that way. He said, it was neither crime nor relationship and, of course, it couldn't be. What I hope is, that it is good fortune; but that's doubtful. At any rate, I must see Junius first, if I can possibly manage it.
