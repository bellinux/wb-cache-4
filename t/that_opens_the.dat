5|$|Che {{opened in}} single theaters in N.Y.C. and L.A. where it made $60,100 with sellouts of both venues. Based on this success, IFC Films {{executives}} added two weekends of exclusive {{runs for the}} roadshow version, starting 24 December in N.Y.C. and 26 December in L.A. This successful run prompted IFC Films to show this version in nine additional markets on 16 January. Che will be shown in its entirety, commercial and trailer free with an intermission and limited edition program book at every screening. Soderbergh {{has said that the}} film's roadshow version will not be released on DVD but released in two parts with the animated map <b>that</b> <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> roadshow's second half missing from Part II, as well as the overture and intermission music.|$|E
5|$|The demo of God of War, {{entitled}} God of War: The Hydra Battle, {{was released}} on January 1, 2005. It featured Kratos battling various opponents and ended with {{a portion of the}} Hydra battle <b>that</b> <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> main game. The game {{was released on}} March 22 in North America, July 8 in the United Kingdom, and November 17 in Japan. By the end of July, it was the sixth-best-selling game of 2005 up to that point. In 2006, it became available in the PlayStation 2 lineup of Greatest Hits. By July 2006, the game had sold 1 million copies and earned $43 million in the United States alone. Next Generation ranked it as the 50th highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country. In June 2012, Sony reported that the game sold more than 4.6million copies worldwide.|$|E

25|$|A lyric {{sequence}} {{is a collection}} of shorter lyric poems that interact to create a coherent, larger meaning. The lyric sequence often includes poems unified by a theme.

25|$|Alan W. Pollack also {{interprets the}} chord as a {{surrogate}} dominant, the G being an anticipation that resolves on the G major chord <b>that</b> <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> verse. He suggests it {{is a mixture of}} D minor, F major, and G major (missing the B). Tony Bacon calls it a Dm7sus4 (D F G A C), which is the minor seventh chord (plus the fourth, G) (for more information regarding chord functions see diatonic function).|$|E
25|$|The grim bass motif <b>that</b> <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> first {{movement}} {{represents the}} domineering Sultan (see the first theme, below).

Soon {{after a few}} chords in the woodwinds, reminiscent of the opening of Mendelssohn's Midsummer Night's Dream overture, the audience hears the leitmotif that represents {{the character of the}} storyteller herself, Scheherazade. This theme, the second below, is a tender, sensuous winding melody for violin solo, accompanied by harp.|$|E

25|$|In the US {{and in most}} of {{the western}} world, skydivers are {{required}} to carry two parachutes. The reserve parachute must be periodically inspected and re-packed (whether used or not) by a certified parachute rigger (in the US, an FAA certificated parachute rigger). Many skydivers use an automatic activation device (AAD) <b>that</b> <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> reserve parachute at a pre-determined altitude if it detects that the skydiver is still in free fall. Depending on the country, AADs are often mandatory for new jumpers, and/or required for all jumpers regardless of their experience level. Most skydivers wear a visual altimeter, and an increasing number also use audible altimeters fitted to their helmets.|$|E
25|$|The jaw {{muscles of}} Sebecus were likely {{similar to those}} of living crocodilians, but the distinctively deep skull of Sebecus {{indicates}} that the muscles were longer. In Sebecus, the shape of the skull and jaws provides more room for adductor muscles, or muscles that close the jaws. The supratemporal fenestrae {{at the top of the}} skull are relatively wide, allowing for the passage of large muscles. In crocodilians, the depressor muscle <b>that</b> <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> jaws originates near the top of the skull and inserts into a projection at the back of the jaw called the retroarticular process. Living crocodilians have a straight retroarticular process at the back of the jaw and a low point of origin for the depressor muscle. Sebecus, with its deeper skull, has a higher point of origin for the depressor, but the retroarticular process curves upward to make the length of the depressor about the same as it is in crocodilians. Like living crocodilians, the depressor muscle of Sebecus was relatively underdeveloped. Therefore, while the closure of the jaws would have been very strong, the ability to open the jaws would be much weaker.|$|E

Beyoncé sings the introduction in a low vocal register that heightens her vocal power; in the song, her voice ranges from F3 to F5.|$|E

[...] The track features three-part harmonies by Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, which were then triple-tracked to give nine voices in the final mix.

Harrison played the Moog synthesizer, and Martin played the harpsichord <b>that</b> <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> track.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} a reprise was Aspinall's, who thought that as there was a [...] "welcome song", there should also be a [...] "goodbye song".

At 1:18, {{it is one of}} the Beatles' shorter songs (the shortest is [...] "Her Majesty" [...] at 0:23). The reprise was recorded on 1 April 1967, two months after the version <b>that</b> <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> album.

Their performance was positively commented on, with Pitch.com saying that [...] "King and Jeff Hanneman riff like they're summoning a storm of thunder, lightning and human blood," [...] and was also noted to be a down-tuned, two-string vamp [...] "that slithers into the foreground creates a tension as Lombardo's cymbals call the band into the riff <b>that</b> <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> tune. It's slow, meaty, unrelenting in its tautness. When Araya's voice comes in, the whole track is off the rails and stays there." [...] "War Ensemble" [...] was filmed live from Germany, and contains four minutes of studio footage. Lyrics were said to [...] "please fans still harboring a grudge from Catholic school." ...|$|E

The opening alone bumps the song's rating up by half a star". Roger Friedman of Fox News dubbed the line as [...] "cocky and fun". Eric R. Danton of The Hartford Courant wrote, [...] "The comedy starts right away, when she plays the role of your drunk friend calling at 3 a.m., slurring, 'It's Britney, bitch'". Mike Schiller of PopMatters called the opening line [...] "real value...kind of hilarious" [...] and added that the [...] "inserted “more” syllables in the chorus only add to the feel that this is a genetically engineered sort of dancefloor banger". Popjustice named [...] "Gimme More" [...] the tenth best song of 2007. The StarPhoenix listed it as the second most infectious song of the year.|$|E
500|$|In 1982, coach Joe B.

This event was held in Memorial Coliseum and held 8,500 people in the 12,500 seat gym. Big Blue Madness is now televised and hosts celebrities including Drake, who performed in 2014. Another of the more famous events is [...] "Late Night in the Phog" [...] at Kansas, which was started in 1985 by Larry Brown and is now broadcast in live streaming video via the Internet. The event has caught on on most campuses; various programs have given away T-shirts and allowed players do stunt dunks and half court shots. [...] Some schools schedule intrasquad scrimmages, three-point shooting contests and/or slam dunk contests. [...] The event is often a co-ed event, in which both the men's and women's team participate in the celebration, especially at schools like the University of Connecticut, where the men's and women's teams have a combined 13 championships. Scout.com estimated that in 2007, approximately 160 of the top blue chip high school basketball recruits in the country were attending a Midnight Madness event during the weekend <b>that</b> <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> basketball season.|$|E
500|$|The {{first draft}} {{libretto}} that Illica produced for Puccini resurfaced in 2000 after being lost for many years. It contains considerable differences {{from the final}} libretto, relatively minor {{in the first two}} acts but much more appreciable in the third, where the description of the Roman dawn <b>that</b> <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> third act is much longer, and Cavaradossi's tragic aria, the eventual [...] "E lucevan le stelle", has different words. The 1896 libretto also offers a different ending, in which Tosca does not die but instead goes mad. In the final scene, she cradles her lover's head in her lap and hallucinates that she and her Mario are on a gondola, and that she is asking the gondolier for silence. Sardou refused to consider this change, insisting that as in the play, Tosca must throw herself from the parapet to her death. Puccini agreed with Sardou, telling him that the mad scene would have the audiences anticipate the ending and start moving towards the cloakrooms. Puccini pressed his librettists hard, and Giacosa issued a series of melodramatic threats to abandon the work. The two librettists were finally able to give Puccini what they hoped was a final version of the libretto in 1898.|$|E

500|$|Principal {{photography}} for Miracle at St. Anna lasted nine weeks, {{beginning in}} October 2007 and concluding in December of that year; filming {{took place in}} Italy, New York, Louisiana and The Bahamas. The film was the first by Lee to be shot in Europe, and the director insisted on shooting on locations where the story is set. Filming began in Tuscany, where the Tuscan regional government gave Lee permission to film where the actual events took place. According to producer Luigi Musini, Miracle at St. Anna was shot along the Gothic Line, which was the major line of defense {{in the final stages}} of World War II: [...] "The location is highly representative of what the war was in Italy, what our resistance was. True dramatic episodes took place there.” The first ten days of filming took place on the Serchio River, covering the battle sequence <b>that</b> <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> film. A scene that recreates the Sant'Anna di Stazzema massacre was shot where the atrocity took place; the massacre—in which over 500 villagers were murdered by German occupation forces—is re-enacted in the film. Filming then took place in Rome for one month; in New York for four days; in White Castle, Louisiana for two days; and in The Bahamas for two days.|$|E
