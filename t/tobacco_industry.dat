5|$|Though {{inhabited}} {{prior to}} the 16th century, {{little is known about}} Barbadian music before the arrival of the Portuguese in 1536 and then the English in 1627. The Portuguese left little influence, but English culture and music helped shape the island's heritage. Irish and Scottish settlers emigrated in the 17th century, working in the <b>tobacco</b> <b>industry,</b> bringing still more new music to the island. The middle of the 17th century saw the decline of the <b>tobacco</b> <b>industry</b> and the rise of sugarcane, as well as the introduction of large numbers of African slaves. Brazilian exiles however, along with sugarcane introduced Samba to the island which featured a mixture of Latin music with African influences which soon developed into Soca-Samba which is indigenous to Barbados. Modern Barbadian music is thus largely a combination of English and African elements, with Irish, Scottish, and modern American and Caribbean (especially Jamaican) influences as well.|$|E
5|$|The <b>tobacco</b> <b>industry</b> in North Korea is substantial, with 53,000 {{hectares}} (2.3 {{percent of}} its arable land) dedicated to tobacco cultivation. This is the fourth-highest percentage of arable land dedicated to tobacco in the world, with the annual output exceeding 80,000 tonnes, making North Korea {{one of the top}} 25 tobacco worldwide producers. This is despite 31% of North Koreans being malnourished. The best, strongest and most expensive tobacco comes from the north of the country near the border with China.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, McCain became {{chairman}} of the powerful Senate Commerce Committee; he was criticized for accepting funds from corporations and businesses under the committee's purview, but in response said the small contributions he received {{were not part of}} the big-money nature of the campaign finance problem. McCain took on the <b>tobacco</b> <b>industry</b> in 1998, proposing legislation that would increase cigarette taxes in order to fund anti-smoking campaigns, discourage teenage smokers, increase money for health research studies, and help states pay for smoking-related health care costs. Supported by the Clinton administration but opposed by the industry and most Republicans, the bill failed to gain cloture.|$|E

5|$|The primary {{campaign}} issue was the ongoing Black Patch Tobacco Wars. Hager carried {{the stigma of}} being the hand-picked candidate of Governor Beckham, who had largely ignored the violence during his administration. On the other hand, Willson had twice represented the American Tobacco Company, whose business practices were the reason for farmers' discontent and violence. Democrats made much of this issue, and Willson did little to counter accusations that he was unsympathetic {{to the plight of}} the farmers. Hager tried to appeal to both sides of the conflict, but ultimately lost the support of both. Willson's position appealed to urban voters who wanted the state's reputation for violence to end even if it meant siding with the <b>tobacco</b> <b>industry</b> against the state's farmers.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} antecedent of {{the university}} was the engineering department of the Merchant Venturers' Technical College (founded as a school as early as 1595) which became the engineering faculty of Bristol University. The university was also preceded by Bristol Medical School (1833) and University College, Bristol, founded in 1876, where its first lecture was attended by only 99 students. The university was able {{to apply for a}} royal charter due to the financial support of the Wills and Fry families, who made their fortunes in tobacco plantations and chocolate, respectively. The Wills Family made a vast fortune from the <b>tobacco</b> <b>industry</b> and gave generously to the city and university. The royal charter was gained in May 1909, with 288 undergraduates and 400 other students entering the university in October 1909. Henry Overton Wills III became its first chancellor. The University College was the first such institution in the country to admit women on the same basis as men. However, women were forbidden to take examinations in medicine until 1906.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} congress, tobacco workers {{initiated}} {{a series of}} strikes at three factories, one of which lasted {{through to the end}} of November. Later, in the summer of 1888, strikes by tobacco workers led to a lockout by factory owners in more than 100 factories. The Círculo de Trabajadores organized a collection drive to support the locked out workers, {{going so far as to}} send representatives to Key West, Florida to solicit donations from American tobacco workers. By October, the lockout was ended by factory owners agreeing to meet with workers in negotiations. The outcome of this situation was so favorable to the Alianza Obrera that the union saw its membership jump from 3,000 to 5,000 in the subsequent six months, making it the most powerful union in Cuba. The following year, Roig San Martín died at age 46, just days after his release from jail by the Spanish colonial government; his funeral was reportedly attended by 10,000 mourners. Just a few months later, in response to a lockout/strike in the <b>tobacco</b> <b>industry,</b> the colonial head Manuel Salamanca y Negrete closed the manufacturer's union, the Alianza Obrera and the Círculo de Trabajadores, although the four schools maintained by the Círculo were allowed to remain open, and the Círculo as a whole was allowed to reopen the following year by the new administration.|$|E

25|$|Concerns around {{second-hand}} smoke {{have played}} a central role in the debate over the harms and regulation of tobacco products. Since the early 1970s, the <b>tobacco</b> <b>industry</b> has viewed public concern over second-hand smoke as a serious threat to its business interests. Harm to bystanders was perceived as a motivator for stricter regulation of tobacco products. Despite the industry's awareness of the harms of second-hand smoke as early as the 1980s, the <b>tobacco</b> <b>industry</b> coordinated a scientific controversy with the aim of forestalling regulation of their products.|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} we {{estimate}} and test for the degree of oligopoly power and economies of scale in forty food and <b>tobacco</b> <b>industries</b> using the New Empirical Industrial Organization (NEIO) framework and four-digit SIC data.
