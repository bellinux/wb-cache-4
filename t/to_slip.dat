5|$|After {{going to}} the ground, Jackson managed <b>to</b> <b>slip</b> out of the choke. Jackson began to attack with ground and pound, dealing strikes to Silva's body while Silva {{answered}} with the same from the bottom. Jackson began to land punches to Silva's face, and the latter attempted a Juji-gatame, a variation of an armbar. Silva could not pull off the hold, and Jackson moved into side control shortly after. From here, Jackson threw punches to Silva's head and followed by landing two knees, again to the head (which were legal under Pride rules).|$|E
5|$|Based on what rank Cole holds {{at the end}} of InFamous, two endings are possible. If Cole defeats Kessler as a Hero, he restores {{peace to}} Empire City and is hailed as a savior. Nevertheless, his estrangement from Zeke and Moya, coupled with the {{responsibilities}} of heroism, lead him to realize that he will always be alone. If Cole is Infamous, he allows Empire City <b>to</b> <b>slip</b> further into chaos, and disregards Kessler's warning about the Beast, believing himself to be the strongest to ever exist.|$|E
5|$|Bompart's {{squadron}} departed Brest {{late in the}} evening, hoping <b>to</b> <b>slip</b> {{past the}} inshore British blockade in the dark. However, they took too long to navigate the Raz passage, and were spotted at dawn on 17 September by a frigate squadron under Captain Richard Goodwin Keats, in HMS Boadicea. Keats immediately divided his forces, ordering HMS Ethalion under Captain George Countess and the brig HMS Sylph under Commander John Chambers White to follow the French force, while Keats brought news of the French movements to Admiral Lord Bridport, admiral of the Channel Fleet.|$|E

5|$|By 2:00 AM {{the entire}} army was in motion roughly along Quaker Bridge Road through {{what is now}} Hamilton Township. The men were ordered to march with {{absolute}} silence. Along the way, a rumor was spread that they were surrounded and some frightened militiamen fled for Philadelphia. The march was difficult, {{as some of the}} route ran through thick woods and it was icy, causing horses <b>to</b> <b>slip,</b> and men to break through ice on ponds.|$|E
5|$|Commander David W. Bagley, the destroyer's commander, {{ordered all}} life rafts and boats launched. As the ship sank, her bow {{raised in the}} air almost {{vertically}} before she began <b>to</b> <b>slip</b> beneath the waves. At this point the armed depth charges began to explode, killing a number of {{men who had been}} unable to escape the destroyer, and stunning many others in the water. The destroyer, the first United States destroyer ever lost to enemy action, sank eight minutes after the torpedo struck the rudder, taking with her two officers and 64 men.|$|E
5|$|Fortunately for the Invaders, one {{of their}} members Mike Shonsey managed <b>to</b> <b>slip</b> from the barn {{and was able to}} contact Governor Barber the next day.

5|$|He used {{friends as}} models, {{most notably the}} painter Eugène Delacroix (1798–1863), who {{modelled}} for {{the figure in the}} foreground with face turned downward and one arm outstretched. Two of the raft's survivors are seen in shadow {{at the foot of the}} mast; three of the figures were painted from life—Corréard, Savigny and Lavillette. Jamar posed nude for the dead youth shown in the foreground about <b>to</b> <b>slip</b> into the sea, and was also the model for two other figures.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{restoration}} {{began in}} Mdina, Birgu and the Cittadella. In Mdina, {{some of the}} bastions had started <b>to</b> <b>slip</b> down the clay slopes, and steel rods were inserted in the walls to reinforce them. Throughout the course of restoration, a number of archaeological remains have been found, including remains of Mdina's Punic-Roman and medieval walls, a bastion and a caponier in Birgu, the Cittadella's original entrance, {{and a number of}} other features.|$|E
5|$|In August 1931, Amazing was {{acquired}} by Teck Publications, a subsidiary of Bernarr Macfadden's Macfadden Publications. Macfadden's deep pockets helped insulate Amazing from the financial strain caused by the Great Depression. The schedule of Amazing Stories Quarterly began <b>to</b> <b>slip,</b> but Amazing did not miss {{an issue in the}} early 1930s. However, it became unprofitable to publish over the next few years. Circulation dropped to little more than 25,000 in 1934, and in October 1935 it switched to a bimonthly schedule.|$|E

5|$|In October and November 1944, Christie {{received}} intelligence regarding German {{plans to}} operate a wolfpack of U-boats in Australian waters. He directed Allied forces to detect and eliminate the threat, resulting in the Dutch submarine Zwaardvisch (swordfish) sinking U-168 on 6 October near Surabaya and 's sinking of U-537 on 10 November near {{the northern end of}} the Lombok Strait. Another U-boat disappeared en route while a fourth, U-862, evaded searchers <b>to</b> <b>slip</b> around the south coast of Australia and sink a Liberty ship south of Sydney in late December.|$|E
5|$|In the Belmont, Paynter led {{for most}} of the race until the final furlong when Smith came off the rail, {{allowing}} winner Union Rags <b>to</b> <b>slip</b> through and win by a neck. Paynter had already fended off two challengers during the race, and Smith had switched his whip from his right hand to his left in an attempt to fend off a late challenge from Atigun; Smith considered his decision to be an error that cost him the race.|$|E
5|$|Internet venues {{unrelated}} to medical issues {{have also been}} the audience for such cases. A member of an online fan club for the musical Rent divulged numerous illnesses that caused her <b>to</b> <b>slip</b> {{in and out of}} comas, prompting some cast members to send sympathy cards. When other fan club members expressed their concern, even purchasing airline tickets to visit the sick woman, she reported that she had immediately improved.|$|E

50|$|The Cat's paw is a knot {{used for}} {{connecting}} a rope to an object. It {{is very similar}} to the cow hitch except there is an additional twist {{on each side of the}} bight, making it less prone <b>to</b> <b>slipping.</b>|$|R
5|$|Juha Vainio became {{interested}} in music and started socializing with musicians in the mid-1950s. The centre of jazz music in Kotka was the restaurant Fennia where performers including Keijo Laitinen and the cousin of Vainio's mother, Olli Miettinen played. Although Vainio was under-21 and classed as a minor, he managed <b>to</b> <b>slip</b> into the restaurant where he presented his lyrics to the musicians and was occasionally allowed to play the piano. Vainio recalled that his friends remembered him as being always penniless. He started drinking more and more, often asking his friends for a drink.|$|E
5|$|The RNA is {{typically}} cleaved before transcription termination, as CstF also binds to RNA polymerase II. Through a poorly understood mechanism (as of 2002), it signals for RNA polymerase II <b>to</b> <b>slip</b> {{off of the}} transcript. Cleavage also involves the protein CFII, though it is unknown how. The cleavage site associated with a polyadenylation signal can vary up to some 50 nucleotides.|$|E
5|$|The {{charting}} and {{conquest of}} this new world made real regions previously only idealised in the imagination of artists and poets. At the same time, the certainty of the old biblical paradise began <b>to</b> <b>slip</b> from the grasp of thinkers into the realms of mythology. In response, treatment of the Paradise in literature, poetry and art shifted towards a self-consciously fictional Utopian representation, as exemplified by the writings of Thomas More (1478–1535).|$|E

50|$|An {{additive}} with deflocculant properties, such as sodium silicate, can {{be added}} <b>to</b> the <b>slip</b> <b>to</b> disperse the raw material particles. This allows a higher solids content to be used, or allows a fluid <b>slip</b> <b>to</b> be produced with the a minimum of water so that drying shrinkage is minimised, which is important during slipcasting.|$|R
50|$|The SES has two {{advantages}} over a hovercraft for open sea operation: {{it is more}} resistant <b>to</b> <b>slipping</b> sideways when acted on by air or sea, and it can use water jets for propulsion since the inlet nozzles are always covered by water.|$|R
5|$|The {{spacecraft}} for the AS-202 and AS-204 missions {{were delivered}} by North American Aviation to the Kennedy Space Center with long lists of equipment problems {{which had to}} be corrected before flight; these delays caused the launch of AS-202 <b>to</b> <b>slip</b> behind AS-203, and eliminated hopes the first manned mission might be ready to launch as soon as November 1966, concurrently with the last Gemini mission. Eventually the planned AS-204 flight date was pushed to February 21, 1967.|$|E
5|$|To his surprise, Wellesley {{found the}} entire {{combined}} army before him. Nevertheless, he resolved to attack at once, believing {{that if he}} waited for Stevenson, the Marathas would have the chance <b>to</b> <b>slip</b> away and force the pursuit to drag on. Wellesley was also eager to forge a reputation for himself, and despite his numerical disadvantage, he was confident that the Maratha’s irregular forces would be swept aside by his disciplined troops, and only Scindia’s regular infantry {{could be expected to}} stand and fight.|$|E
5|$|While Eddie goes in pursuit, Peter manages <b>to</b> <b>slip</b> out {{and goes}} after Connors as Spider-Man.
