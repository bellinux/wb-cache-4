5000|$|Cut terraces: Cut <b>terraces,</b> {{also called}} [...] "cut-in-fill" [...] <b>terraces,</b> {{are similar to}} the fill <b>terraces</b> {{mentioned}} above, but they are erosional in origin.

5|$|An {{inclined}} tramway, the ramp, {{was built}} {{from the front}} of the <b>terrace,</b> on the axis of the gatehouse, down towards the port area of Fremantle. The ramp, constructed between 1852 and 1853, is of limestone rubble from the cut and fill activities required to create the prison site and the <b>terrace.</b> The ramp is an integral part of the original design of the prison complex and is of exceptional heritage significance. It is now cut at its western end by a modern road which severs the historic visual link with Fremantle. On each side of the alignment of the ramp, where it intersects with Henderson Street, are three <b>terrace</b> houses for the accommodation of prison warders. These were erected between 1851 and 1858 and mark the boundary of the Convict Establishment at this point. The limestone used for the early prison and its associated housing was quarried on the site.|$|E
