The ramp, constructed between 1852 and 1853, is of limestone rubble from the cut and fill activities required to create the prison site and the <b>terrace.</b> The ramp is an integral part of the original design of the prison complex and is of exceptional heritage significance. It is now cut at its western end by a modern road which severs the historic visual link with Fremantle. On each side of the alignment of the ramp, where it intersects with Henderson Street, are three <b>terrace</b> houses for the accommodation of prison warders. These were erected between 1851 and 1858 and mark the boundary of the Convict Establishment at this point.
