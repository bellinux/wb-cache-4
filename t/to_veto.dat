5|$|In late 2013, the House {{passed a}} forest {{management}} bill co-sponsored by Oregon Representatives Peter DeFazio, Greg Walden, and Kurt Schrader {{that would include}} increased timber harvests on O lands along with resumption of some Secure Rural Schools funding. President Obama has indicated he is likely <b>to</b> <b>veto</b> the bill.|$|E
5|$|The Act {{effectively}} {{removed the}} right of the House of Lords <b>to</b> <b>veto</b> money bills completely, and replaced it with a right of veto over other public bills with a maximum delay of two years (the Parliament Act 1949 reduced this to one). It also reduced the maximum term of a parliament from seven years to five.|$|E
5|$|More {{controversy}} {{surrounded the}} choice of architect. The Manchester Art Federation and other bodies petitioned the city council to hold an open competition, to which the council agreed. The war memorial committee appointed Percy Worthington, a local architect, as the assessor for the competition but attracted severe criticism in the local press when it reserved the right <b>to</b> <b>veto</b> Worthington's choice. After further debate, the competition was abandoned and a subcommittee approached Sir Edwin Lutyens.|$|E

5|$|On March 3, 1873, President Grant {{signed a}} law that {{authorized}} the President's salary to be increased from $25,000 a year to $50,000 a year and Congressmen's salaries to be increased by $2,500. Representatives also received a retroactive pay bonus for previous two years of service. This was done in secret and attached to a general appropriations bill. Reforming newspapers quickly exposed {{the law and the}} bonus was repealed in January 1874. Grant missed an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>veto</b> the bill and to make a strong statement for good government.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the deployment, South African {{authorities}} threatened <b>to</b> <b>veto</b> {{the involvement}} of Australian peacekeeping troops because of doubts about their impartiality. This followed the establishment by the Australian Government of a Special Assistance Program for South Africans and Namibians (SAPSAN) in 1986 to assist South Africans and Namibians disadvantaged by apartheid. The focus of SAPSAN was on education and training {{for the people of}} South Africa and Namibia, and some humanitarian assistance had also been provided. A total of $11.9million was spent under SAPSAN from 1986 to 1990.|$|E
5|$|Since 1 January 2002, the {{government}} of Zimbabwe has had its lines of credit at international financial institutions frozen, through US legislation called the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001 (ZDERA). Section 4C instructs the Secretary of the Treasury to direct directors at international financial institutions <b>to</b> <b>veto</b> the extension of loans and credit to the Zimbabwean government. According to the United States, these sanctions target only seven specific businesses owned or controlled by government officials and not ordinary citizens.|$|E

5|$|The 1799 {{constitution}} contained, for {{the first}} time, {{the power of the}} governor <b>to</b> <b>veto</b> legislation; this power was substantially similar to, and probably based upon, that found in the 1792 New Hampshire Constitution and the 1798 Georgia Constitution. The governor's veto can be overridden by a majority vote of both houses of the legislature. The 1891 constitution empowered the governor with a line-item veto, but its use was forbidden on constitutional amendments and laws related to the classification of property for tax purposes.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Honour is {{a regular}} meeting of Patrol Leaders (PLs) and the Troop Scouter, and is {{responsible}} for the majority of decisions regarding troop discipline, patrol management, troop programme and other matters. The Troop Scouter is the only adult leader regularly attending these meetings, although the Court of Honour may invite other Scouters to attend. The Troop Scouter has the right <b>to</b> <b>veto</b> decision, but should generally only act in an advisory role, allowing the Scouts themselves to make important decisions.|$|E
5|$|The House of Representatives has {{the power}} to appoint the prime minister, make {{constitutional}} amendments, call for a vote of confidence on the prime minister, and make suggestions on foreign and domestic policy. The Council of the Republic {{has the power}} to select various government officials, conduct an impeachment trial of the president, and accept or reject the bills passed by the House of Representatives. Each chamber has the ability <b>to</b> <b>veto</b> any law passed by local officials if it is contrary to the constitution.|$|E

5|$|The {{executive}} branch {{consists of the}} Governor, their staff, and other elected officials. The principal head of government, the Governor is {{the chief executive of}} the Oklahoma {{executive branch}}, serving as the ex officio Commander-in-Chief of the Oklahoma National Guard when not called into Federal use and reserving the power <b>to</b> <b>veto</b> bills passed through the Legislature. The responsibilities of the Executive branch include submitting the budget, ensuring state laws are enforced, and ensuring peace within the state is preserved.|$|E
5|$|The {{governor}} {{works in}} concert with the state legislature (the bicameral Indiana General Assembly, consisting of the Indiana House of Representatives and the Indiana Senate) and the state supreme court (the Supreme Court of Indiana) to govern the state. The governor has the power <b>to</b> <b>veto</b> legislation passed by the General Assembly. If vetoed, a bill is returned to the General Assembly for reconsideration. Unlike other states, most of which require a two-thirds supermajority to override a veto, the Indiana General Assembly may override the veto with an absolute majority vote in both chambers.|$|E
5|$|Caesar held {{both the}} {{dictatorship}} and the tribunate, and alternated between the consulship and the proconsulship. In 48 BC, Caesar was given permanent tribunician powers. This made his person sacrosanct, {{gave him the}} power <b>to</b> <b>veto</b> the senate, and allowed him to dominate the Plebeian Council. In 46 BC, Caesar was given censorial powers, which he used to fill the senate with his own partisans. Caesar then raised {{the membership of the}} Senate to 900. This robbed the senatorial aristocracy of its prestige, and made it increasingly subservient to him. While the assemblies continued to meet, he submitted all candidates to the assemblies for election, and all bills to the assemblies for enactment. Thus, the assemblies became powerless and were unable to oppose him.|$|E

In spite of his quiet withdrawal, the UDF lost both elections heavily. Fall of 2007, he was rejected by the government as a candidate for the position of Judge at the European Court of Human Rights (Strasbourg). In July 2008, he declared that he is voluntarily leaving politics for good.|$|R
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{opponents of the}} Bedell plan had a very {{different}} view of this legislation. Representatives such as Pat Roberts claimed that the referendum was redundant because the farmers already voted the politicians into office, and this bill {{was an example of}} the politicians not doing their jobs. The Reagan Administration opposed the bill because of their opposition to production controls, and the President threatened <b>to</b> <b>veto</b> the farm bill if Bedell's plan was left in place. When the bill got to the floor, an amendment was proposed to strike this provision, and it was passed 251-174.|$|E
5|$|Ross {{became the}} 19th {{governor}} of Texas. His inauguration ball {{was held at}} the newly opened Driskill Hotel, a tradition followed by every subsequent Texas governor. Under the 1876 Texas Constitution, which he had helped write, the governor was granted the power to be commander-in-chief, to convene the legislature, to act as executor of the laws, to direct trade with other states, to grant pardons, and <b>to</b> <b>veto</b> bills. His campaign had focused on land use reform, as most of the frontier issues now resulted from disagreements over the use of public land, especially between farmers and ranchers concerned with water rights and grazing issues. At Ross's urging, the legislature passed laws to restore the power of the Land Office Commissioner, provide punishments for those using state lands illegally, and to catalog existing public lands.|$|E
5|$|The District of Columbia {{government}} {{responded by}} threatening <b>to</b> <b>veto</b> any further Metro subway construction unless {{construction of the}} Green Line was made Metro's highest priority. Twenty-four hours of intense discussions later, Metro agreed to the District government's wishes. Construction began on the Waterfront Station, and the station was largely complete by January 1981. Once complete, the station was used for storage. By December 1980, Metro was still predicting that the Green Line to Anacostia would open in July 1986. But in January 1981, Metro admitted that the line would not open until at least 1990 because of funding constraints. Two months later, Metro estimated {{the cost of building}} the Green Line from U Street NW to Anacostia at $175 million.|$|E

5|$|The Plebeian Council elected two 'Plebeian Magistrates', the Plebeian Tribunes and the Plebeian Aediles. Usually the Plebeian Tribune {{presided over}} the assembly, {{although}} the Plebeian Aedile sometimes did as well. Originally, statutes passed by the Plebeian Council ("Plebiscites") only applied to Plebeians. However, in 449 BC, a statute of an Assembly was passed which gave Plebiscites {{the full force of}} law over all Romans (Plebeians and Patricians). It was not until 287 BC, however, that the last mechanism which allowed the Roman Senate <b>to</b> <b>veto</b> acts of the Plebeian Council was revoked. After this point, almost all domestic legislation came out of the Plebeian Council.|$|E
5|$|The Port Authority is jointly {{controlled}} by the governors of New York and New Jersey, who appoint {{the members of the}} agency's Board of Commissioners and retain the right <b>to</b> <b>veto</b> the actions of the Commissioners from his or her own state. Each governor appoints six members to the Board of Commissioners, who are subject to state senate confirmation and serve overlapping six-year terms without pay. An Executive Director is appointed by the Board of Commissioners to deal with day-to-day operations and to execute the Port Authority's policies. Under an informal power-sharing agreement, the Governor of New Jersey chooses {{the chairman of the board}} and the deputy executive director, while the Governor of New York selects the vice-chairman and Executive Director.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} month, Anne's Catholic half-brother, James Francis Edward Stuart, {{attempted to}} land in Scotland with French assistance {{in an attempt to}} establish himself as king. Anne withheld royal assent from the Scottish Militia Bill 1708 in case the militia raised in Scotland was disloyal and sided with the Jacobites. She was the last British sovereign <b>to</b> <b>veto</b> a parliamentary bill, although her action was barely commented upon at the time. The invasion fleet never landed and was chased away by British ships commanded by Sir George Byng. As a result of the Jacobite invasion scare, support for the Tories fell and the Whigs were able to secure a majority in the British general election, 1708.|$|E
