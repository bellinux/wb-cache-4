40|$|People {{spend most}} of their time inside {{buildings}} and the indoor microbiome is a major part of our everyday environment. It affects humans' wellbeing and therefore its composition is important for use in inferring human health impacts. It is still not well understood how environmental conditions affect indoor microbial communities. Existing studies have mostly focussed on the local (e. g., building units) or continental scale and rarely on the regional scale, e. g. a specific metropolitan area. Therefore, we wanted to identify key environmental determinants for the house dust microbiome from an existing collection of spatially (area of Munich, Germany) and temporally (301 days) distributed samples and to determine changes in the community as a function of time. To that end, dust samples that had been collected once from <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>floors</b> of 286 individual households, were profiled for fungal and bacterial community variation and diversity using microbial fingerprinting techniques. The profiles were tested for their association with occupant behaviour, building characteristics, outdoor pollution, vegetation, and urbanization. Our results showed that more environmental and particularly outdoor factors (vegetation, urbanization, airborne particulate matter) affected the community composition of indoor fungi than of bacteria. The passage of time affected fungi and, surprisingly, also strongly affected bacteria. We inferred that fungal communities in indoor dust changed semi-annually, whereas bacterial communities paralleled outdoor plant phenological periods. These differences in temporal dynamics cannot be fully explained and should be further investigated in future studies on indoor microbiomes...|$|R

40|$|After {{attending}} this presentation, attendees {{will understand}} that forensic investigations {{are based on a}} multidisciplinary approach in which autopsy findings and toxicological results often result in association with circumstances and crime scene investigations. This presentation will impact the forensic science community by demonstrating how recreational abuse of anesthetic and sedative agents in health care practitioners, especially anesthesiologists is an increasing event. This presentation will also show an unusual case of suicide in which the manner and means of suicide was dependent upon the occupation of the victim. Presented is a case of a 50 -year-old man, anesthetist at the main local hospital, who was found dead in the house where he lived alone since separating from his wife. On the previous evening he was found on the landing’s floor with an occipital bruise injury and treated in the Emergency Department. The next day his brother, alerted by his colleagues that tried in vain to contact him, went to his house. He found that the front door had been left ajar, with a piece of furniture behind it. When he entered the flat, he noticed the corpse of the brother, supine on <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room’s</b> <b>floor</b> near a piece of furniture. There were two drips with intravenous tubes almost empty (approximately 1 ml). One drip was still inserted in the dorsum of the victim’s right hand with tube for intravenous drip totally open. On the glass of this drip there was written “Miclela Caput” (meaning “Caput Mixture,” written incorrectly). On the glass of the other drip there was written “ 500 TPS+ 200 DIPR” (meaning Sodium Thiopental+Diprivan). In the house there were some empty blisters of Zolpidem, more than 20 packs of different drugs (some of them empty), an ash-tray containing white liquid, several empty ampoules of Propofol, Midazolam and Thiopental, and several new and used syringes. In the bedroom there were two knapsacks containing pornographic materials and four plastic phalli. External examination revealed abundant livor mortis, numerous recent needle marks with fresh and older hemorrhages in both arms, and a sutured occipital injury. Autopsy and histological findings were pulmonary and brain oedema, moderate fatty liver, acute poly-visceral congestion, hemorrhagic pancreatitis. Systematic toxicological analysis was performed on biological and non biological samples for alcohol, drugs of abuse and pharmaceuticals. Blood toxicological examination by GC/MS revealed lethal concentration of Zolpidem (0. 86 μg/ml) and high therapeutic blood concentrations of Propofol (0. 30 μg/ml), Midazolam (0. 08 μg/ml), Amitriptyline (0. 07 μg/ml), and low concentration of Thiopental (0. 03 μg/ml). Zolpidem was also found in gastric content while Thiopental was found in urine. Hair segment analysis (0 – 2 cm) revealed Propofol (4, 7 μg/mg) and the presence of Zolpidem, Amitriptyline and Ketoprofen. Residual’s toxicological analysis of the inserted drip (“Caput mixture”) revealed Propofol and Midazolam (approximately 1, 9 and 0, 08 mg/ml). Analysis of the non-inserted drip, showed Propofol and Thiopental (approximately 2 and 5 mg/ml). The low blood concentration of Thiopental suggests a self administration of the non-inserted drip at least 12 hours before death. The blood Propofol level was lower than or within the commonly accepted therapeutic range of 1. 3 – 6. 8 μg/ml after a standard anesthetic induction dose. Published reports indicate that in most cases, the postmortem Propofol concentrations were at therapeutic levels. It {{should be pointed out that}} especially for those agents used in anesthesia; the therapeutic concentrations refer to patients being supported respiratorywise, while in non-supported or non-intubated patients such concentrations may be lethal. Most of those deaths are thought to have occurred because of the rapidity of Propofol’s injection which led to apnea and death. A mere interpretation of the blood and tissue concentrations of Propofol in the toxicological analysis may be of limited diagnostic significance without taking into account the before mentioned reports. Toxicological analysis of hair confirmed the recreational abuse of Propofol. These anesthetic and sedative drugs are often used in combination for anesthesia’s induction. All of these act synergistically in combination and may induce respiratory depression. This effect depends on individual susceptibility, on dose used and, especially for Propofol and Midazolam, infusion’s rapidity. In conclusion, the victim was administered a solution of anesthetic drugs, rapidly infused in a lethal combination and simultaneously a hypnotic drug in lethal dose...|$|R

40|$|Background Exposure {{to house}} dust mite (HDM) allergens {{often results in}} {{worsening}} of asthma. Therefore, avoidance of exposure to HDM allergens is often proposed. Unfortunately, {{the most effective and}} feasible avoidance strategy is still not completely assessed. Consequently, we investigated the effects of a combined HDM avoidance strategy on HDM allergen concentrations and clinical condition of allergic, mild asthmatic, patients using no inhaled steroids. Methods Asthmatic patients, allergic to HDM, using no inhaled corticosteroids, were randomly allocated to an active (n = 76) or a placebo allergen-avoidance group (n = 81). Avoidance measures consisted of applying Acarosan(R) (placebo: water) to <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> and bedroom <b>floors,</b> and the use of HDM-impermeable covers for mattresses and bedding (placebo: cotton covers for mattresses only). Effects on allergen concentrations (Der p 1), FEV 1, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, peak how parameters and asthma symptom scores were studied during 20 weeks and controlled for the allergic status of the patients. Results The active covers reduced Der p 1 concentrations to 9. 4 % (P = 0. 0001), and were always significant lower than in the placebo group (P = 0. 0002). Acarosan(R) resulted in slight but significant decreases (twofold, P = 0. 0001), both on <b>living</b> <b>room</b> and bedroom <b>floors,</b> but concentrations were never significantly lower than the placebo group. Although the combined avoidance strategy resulted in a considerable reduction in allergen load in the active group, no differences were seen between the two groups in any of the clinical parameters during the follow-up period in this group of allergic asthmatics, using no inhaled corticosteroids. Corrections for the allergic status did not alter these results. Conclusions The combined avoidance strategy was effective in reducing HDM allergen concentration. This was especially achieved by the allergen-impermeable covers, while the effects of Acarosan(R) were only marginal. However, this allergen reduction was not reflected in a convincing improvement in clinical condition in this group Of mild allergic asthmatics, using no inhaled steroids. Perhaps, a longer follow-up period would have resulted in more pronounced effects...|$|R

The inclined path around the monument was a walkway leading to the apartments of the Sultan. Two large openings in <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>rooms</b> of <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> were inferred as leading to the vaults or the treasury. On the level platform, outside the building in front of the apartment rooms, small holes equally spaced are seen, which have been inferred to be holes used to fix wooden pillars to hold a temporary shamiana (pavilion) or cover.
