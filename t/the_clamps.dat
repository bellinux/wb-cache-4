5|$|The {{original}} {{design of the}} Indiana class included bilge keels, but with keels they would not fit {{in any of the}} American drydocks at the time, so they were omitted during construction. This meant a reduction in stability and caused a serious problem for Indiana, when both main turrets broke loose from their clamps in heavy seas a year after being commissioned. Because the turrets were not centrally balanced, they swung from side to side with the motion of the ship, until they were secured with heavy ropes. When the ship encountered more bad weather four months later, she promptly steamed back to port for fear <b>the</b> <b>clamps</b> would break again. This convinced the navy that bilge keels were necessary and they were subsequently installed on all three ships.|$|E
40|$|AbstractReplication {{machines}} use ring-shaped clamps that encircle DNA {{to tether}} the polymerase to <b>the</b> chromosome. <b>The</b> <b>clamp</b> is assembled on DNA by a clamp loader. This report shows that <b>the</b> polymerase and <b>clamp</b> loader coordinate their actions with <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> by competing for it through overlapping binding sites. The competition is modulated by DNA. In {{the absence of}} DNA, <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> associates with <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> loader. But after <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> is placed on DNA, the polymerase develops a tight grip on <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> and out-competes <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> loader.

40|$|<b>The</b> sliding <b>clamps</b> of {{chromosomal}} replicases are {{acted upon}} by both <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> loader and DNA polymerase. Several other proteins and polymerases also interact with <b>the</b> <b>clamp.</b> These proteins bind <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> at <b>the</b> same spot {{and use it}} in sequential fashion. First <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> loader must bind <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> in order to load it onto DNA, but directly thereafter <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> loader must clear away from <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> {{so it can be}} used by the replicative DNA polymerase. At the end of replication, the replicase is ejected from <b>the</b> <b>clamp,</b> which presumably allows <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> to interact with yet other proteins after its use by the replicase. This paper describes how different proteins in the Escherichia coli replicase, DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, coordinate their traffic flow on <b>the</b> <b>clamp.</b> <b>The</b> mechanism by which traffic flow on <b>the</b> beta <b>clamp</b> is directed is based on competition of the proteins for <b>the</b> <b>clamp,</b> where DNA structure modulates the competition.

2500|$|In 1939 {{the museum}} closed because of World War II. Two {{years later the}} reliefs were taken down and stored elsewhere. At {{the end of the}} war, the pieces of the altar which had been placed in an air-raid shelter near the Berlin zoo fell {{into the hands of the}} Red Army and were taken to the Soviet Union as war trophies. They were stored in the depot of the Hermitage Museum in Leningrad until 1958. In 1959 a large part of the {{collection}} was returned to East Germany (GDR), including the altar fragments. Under the leadership of the museum's then director, Carl Blümel, only the altar was presented as it had been before the war. The other antiquities were newly arranged, not least because the Altes Museum had been destroyed. In October of that year the museum reopened. In 1982 a new entrance area was created which permitted a visit to the museum to begin with the Pergamon Altar. Previously, the entrance had been in the west wing of the building, so that visitors had to pass through the [...] Vorderasiatisches Museum Berlin (Middle East Museum) to get to the Pergamon Altar. In 1990, 9 heads from the Telephus frieze, which had been evacuated to the western part of Berlin because of the war, returned to the Pergamon Museum. All these war-related events had negative consequences for the remaining altar and frieze fragments. It also turned out that earlier restorations had created problems. <b>The</b> <b>clamps</b> and fasteners which connected the individual fragments and also served to anchor the frieze and sculpture to the wall were made of iron, which had started to rust. As this rust spread it threatened to crack open the marble from the inside. Restoration became urgent after 1990. From 1994 to 1996 the Telephus frieze, parts of which had not been accessible in the 1980s, was worked on. Afterward the Gigantomachy was restored under the leadership of Silvano Bertolin. First the western frieze, then the northern and southern portions, and finally the eastern frieze were restored, an effort which cost over three million euro. On June 10, 2004 the completely restored frieze was presented for public viewing. The Pergamon altar can now be viewed in a form reflecting current scientific insights.|$|E

40|$|Chromosomal {{replication}} is {{an essential}} process in all life. This dissertation highlights regulatory roles for two critical protein complexes {{at the heart of}} the replication fork: 1) <b>the</b> sliding <b>clamp,</b> <b>the</b> major polymerase processivity factor, and 2) <b>the</b> sliding <b>clamp</b> loader, a spiral-shaped AAA+ ATPase, which loads <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> onto DNA. <b>The</b> <b>clamp</b> is a promiscuous binding protein that interacts with at least 100 binding partners to orchestrate many processes on DNA, but spatiotemporal regulation of these binding interactions is unknown. Remarkably, a recent disease-causing mutant of <b>the</b> sliding <b>clamp</b> showed specific defects in DNA repair pathways. We aimed to use this mutant as a tool to understand the binding specificity of clamp interactions, and investigate the disease further. We solved three structures of the mutant, and biochemically showed perturbation of partnerbinding for some, but not all, ligands. Using a fission yeast model, we showed that mutant cells are sensitive to select DNA damaging agents. These data revealed significant flexibility within the binding site, which likely regulates partner binding. Before <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> can act on DNA, <b>the</b> sliding <b>clamp</b> loader places <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> onto DNA at primer/template (p/t) junctions. <b>The</b> <b>clamp</b> loader reaction couples p/t binding and subsequent ATP hydrolysis to clamp closure. Here we show that composition (RNA vs. DNA) of the primer strand affects clamp loader binding, and that the order of ATP hydrolysis around the spiral is likely sequential. These studies highlight additional details into <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> loader mechanism, which further elucidate general mechanisms of AAA+ machinery...|$|R

40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY PROJECT CONTEXT ESCO Incorporated {{manufactures}} {{a variety}} of steel parts using a sand mold casting process. In this process a clamping device is used to prevent the sand mold from leaking during the pouring process. <b>The</b> current <b>clamp</b> design has several deficiencies including an uneven distribution of <b>the</b> <b>clamping</b> force, mold damage caused by the engagement of <b>the</b> <b>clamping</b> device, and <b>the</b> manual disengagement of <b>the</b> <b>clamp.</b> These factors result in defective parts and time delays in part manufacturing. The MIME capstone design team 46. 1 was tasked with creating an improved clamping device that would eliminate these issues and increase profits for ESCO. DESIGN PROCESS The team began the design process by analyzing the customer needs and developing corresponding engineering requirements. The second {{step in the process}} consisted of researching {{a variety of}} clamping designs and design components used both within and outside of the casting industry and evaluating them according to how well they satisfied the required functions. Based on this information the team created four different <b>clamp</b> designs. <b>The</b> four designs were then evaluated against the engineering requirements and ranked in a decision matrix. The concept with the highest ranking was selected as the final design. SELECTED DESIGN <b>The</b> <b>clamp</b> design selected for implementation, shown in Figure 1, is based on two main components: a rack and pinion jack and an adjustable steel footprint. The rack and pinion jack reduces set-up time by combining <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> height adjustment and clamping force application with handle rotation. The force is applied smoothly, thus avoiding damage to the mold. The adjustable footprint uses steel angle irons that can withstand the high temperatures of the casting process and a slotted connection to accommodate a variety of mold layouts. It also distributes <b>the</b> required <b>clamping</b> force evenly. Finally, the design utilizes two pinned connections that allow <b>the</b> <b>clamping</b> device to disengage automatically from the sand mold. IMPLEMENTATION AND TESTING The team purchased the Rack and Pinion jack from a company in Germany and purchased the remaining parts from local hardware stores. Next, the team performed all of the welding and fabrication for each of the components of <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> at Oregon State University. <b>The</b> <b>clamp</b> was then assembled and tested on a simulated sand mold. Load cells were used to demonstrate the ability of <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> to provide <b>the</b> necessary <b>clamping</b> force as well as the force distribution. Additional tests on <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> were performed including: durability, setup time, maintenance, sand mold clearance, and the ability of <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> to auto disengage. RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS <b>The</b> <b>clamp</b> design passed all of the tests. Based on the implementation and testing, modifications were made to improve the functionality of <b>the</b> <b>clamp.</b> First, <b>the</b> team replaced the plastic handle on the jack with an aluminum handle for increased durability. Second, the team added a sheet metal guard around the bottom portion of the rack to prevent damage due to liquid metal splashing onto the rack. In the future, the team recommends replacing the manually operated handle with an attachment that allows for a pneumatic drill to reduce setup time. Additionally, the team recommends adding a torque wrench attachment to the handle to provide a more consistent clamping force each time <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> is engaged...|$|R
