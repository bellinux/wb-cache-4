5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} {{fell across}} the Dominican Republic, with isolated totals of 10inches (250mm) expected. The rainfall caused flooding along the Yaque del Norte River, and initially {{there appeared to}} be a threat that the Tavera Dam along the river would fail, potentially killing thousands in Santiago Province. Officials instead opted to open all six floodgates at 0400UTC on December 12, which released about 1.6milliongallons (6.1millionliters) of water into the river every second. The deluge created a 66foot (20m) wave of water that caught many off guard due to the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>night</b> and only about 15minutes to prepare, according to eyewitnesses who criticized the decision; the flooding killed at least 35people and left homes in seven towns flooded. Two other deaths were reported elsewhere in the country, and more than 34,000people fled their homes due to the storm; more than 7,500houses were damaged. Damage in the country was estimated at $1.5billion (2007DOP, $45million 2007USD). In neighboring Haiti, two deaths were reported in the northern portion of the country. On December 11, a station in the Turks and Caicos Islands recorded sustained winds of 36mph (58km/h).|$|E
5|$|On April 20, 1925, Wright {{returned}} from eating {{dinner in the}} detached dining room when he noticed smoke billowing from his bedroom. By that <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>night,</b> most of the employees had returned home; only a driver and one apprentice were left in the complex. Unlike the first Taliesin fire, Wright {{was able to get}} help immediately. However, the fire quickly spread due to high winds. Despite the efforts of Wright and his neighbors to extinguish the flame, the living quarters of the second Taliesin were quickly destroyed. However, the workrooms where Wright kept his architectural drafts were spared. According to Wright's autobiography, the fire appeared to have begun near a telephone in his bedroom. Wright also mentioned a lightning storm approaching immediately before noticing the fire. Wright scholars speculate that the storm may have caused an electrical surge through the telephone system, sparking the fire.|$|E

2500|$|In the mid-1980s, the Burger King {{fast-food}} chain lampooned Rogers' {{image with}} an actor called [...] "Mr. Rodney", imitating Rogers' television character. Rogers found the character's pitching fast food as confusing to children, and called {{a press conference}} in which he stated that he did not endorse the company's use of his character or likeness (Rogers did no commercial endorsements of any kind throughout his career, though, over the years, he acted as a pitchman for several non-profit organizations dedicated to learning). The chain publicly apologized for the faux pas and pulled the ads. By contrast, Fred Rogers found Eddie Murphy's parody of his show on Saturday Night Live, [...] "Mister Robinson's Neighborhood," [...] amusing and affectionate; the parody was also initially broadcast at a <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>night</b> when his own child audience was not likely to see it.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the success}} of Death on the Nile, MacCorkindale moved to the United States in 1980. Although warned that it would limit his chance of finding work, MacCorkindale refused to adopt an American accent when {{audition}}ing, believing that his British diction would help fill a [...] "niche". However, for two years he failed at the audition stage for all major parts {{on account of his}} nationality. The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) told MacCorkindale that he was not an [...] "eight o'clock actor", which he took to mean that [...] "at that <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>night</b> they didn't want viewers watching someone who sounded intellectual or who had an accent that was alien to their ears and, therefore, hard work when it came to listening." [...] During this time he appeared in single-episode roles in series such as Dynasty, Fantasy Island, Hart to Hart, Matt Houston and The Dukes of Hazzard, as well as playing David Clement, an aristocrat, in the mini-series Manions of America.|$|E

2500|$|An {{exquisite}} literary perfectionist, {{akin to the}} 19th century French poet Stéphane Mallarmé, Saint-Exupéry produced draft pages [...] "covered {{with fine}} lines of handwriting, much of it painstakingly crossed out, with one word left standing where there were a hundred words, one sentence substitut for a page...". He worked [...] "long hours with great concentration". According to the author himself, it was extremely difficult to start his creative writing processes. [...] Biographer Paul Webster wrote of the aviator-author's style [...] "Behind Saint-Exupéry's quest for perfection was a laborious process of editing and rewriting which reduced original drafts {{by as much as}} two-thirds". The French author frequently wrote at night, usually starting about 11 p.m. accompanied by a tray of strong black coffee. In 1942 Saint-Exupéry related to his American English teacher, Adèle Breaux, that at such a <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>night</b> he felt [...] "free" [...] and able to concentrate, [...] "writing for hours without feeling tired or sleepy", until he instantaneously dozed off. He would wake up later, in daylight, still at his desk, with his head on his arms. [...] Saint-Exupéry stated {{it was the only way}} he could work, as once he started a writing project it became an obsession.|$|E
2500|$|At the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863, Reynolds {{clashed with}} Maj. Gen. Hooker, his {{predecessor}} at I Corps, but {{by this time}} the commander of the Army of the Potomac. Hooker originally placed the I Corps on the extreme left of the Union line, southeast of Fredericksburg, hoping to threaten and distract the Confederate right. On May 2, Hooker changed his mind and ordered the corps to conduct a daylight march nearly 20 miles to swing around and become the extreme right flank of the army, to the northwest of the XI Corps. The march was delayed by faulty communications and by the need to move stealthily to avoid Confederate contact. Thus, the I Corps was not yet in position when the XI Corps was surprised and overrun by Lt. Gen. Thomas J. [...] "Stonewall" [...] Jackson's flank attack, a setback that destroyed Hooker's nerve for offensive action. Hooker called a council of war on May 4 in which Reynolds voted to proceed with the battle, but although the vote was three to two for offensive action, Hooker decided to retreat. Reynolds, who had gone to sleep after giving his proxy vote to Meade, woke up and muttered loud enough for Hooker to hear, [...] "What was the use of calling us together at this <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>night</b> when he intended to retreat anyhow?" [...] The 17,000-man I Corps was not engaged at Chancellorsville and suffered only 300 casualties during the entire campaign.|$|E
2500|$|The boys run out {{to watch}} the {{carnival}} arrive {{at three in the}} morning. As the train pulls in, the smoke billows in circles and solidifies as the carnival. Mr. Holloway talks about this <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>night</b> as [...] "soul's midnight," [...] when men are closest to death, locked in the depths of despair. The boys go the next day to explore the carnival and they encounter their seventh grade teacher, Miss Foley, who is dazed after visiting the Mirror Maze. Jim insists on coming back that night and Will agrees, but when they bump into the lightning-rod salesman's bag, they realize that they must stay to learn what happens after dark. After investigating all of the rides, they go up to a carousel. Mr. Cooger suddenly grabs Will and Jim after they climb up on horses and he informs them the merry-go-round is broken. Another man arrives and tells him to put them down, introducing himself as Mr. Dark and tells them the huge man's name is Mr. Cooger. Mr. Dark pays attention only to Jim, who is enthralled by what he sees. He then tells the boys to come back the next day and offers them passes to the carousel. [...] They run away and then hide and wait. Both witness Mr. Cooger riding backwards on the carousel (as the music plays backwards), and when he steps off, to their shock- he is twelve years old.|$|E

But Dr. Lightfoot observes, that as there is a special mark over a word in the story of Lot's eldest daughter lying with her father (a dot above the letter י [...] "yod" [...] of last Hebrew word in Lot's eldest daughter gave birth to Moab, the progenitor of Ruth's tribe) and a special mark on this word here, in the story of Ruth going to Boaz his bed, seems to relate one to the other, and both together to point at the great providence of God in bringing light out of darkness, Ruth, a (fore)mother of Jesus Christ, out of the incest of Lot.|$|E
