In December Ford took his case to the Commander in Chief (and commander of New Guinea Force), General Sir Thomas Blamey. After being lectured by Ford for about an hour on the history and dangers of malaria, and what needed to be done, Blamey said: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> you, Colonel Ford.

500|$|The exact {{genre of}} Nightcrawler {{has been the}} subject of debate. While most critics agree that the film {{predominantly}} features thriller elements, other descriptions have been used, including dark comedy, drama, horror, and neo-noir. When asked about the film's genre, Gilroy stated: [...] "I see Nightcrawler as having genre elements in the sense that it’s a thriller. It also has some strong dramatic elements and I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> the question as there's some really strong elements of drama." [...] Gyllenhaal particularly noted the comedic elements, commenting: [...] "Gilroy and I were laughing pretty much the whole movie." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 10 January 2011, it was {{confirmed}} that Ian McKellen and Andy Serkis would reprise their respective roles of Gandalf the Grey and Gollum from The Lord of the Rings film trilogy. Although both actors {{were expected to}} return for their roles McKellen was previously quoted in July 2010 on TVNZ's Good Morning that: [...] "I'm not under contract and my time is running out. I don't want to give the producers the impression that I'm sitting waiting." [...] It was later revealed that Serkis would also serve as second unit director on the films. Serkis stated, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> Peter's sensibility and we have a common history of understanding Middle-earth. A lot of the crew from The Lord of the Rings was returning to work on The Hobbit. There is really a sense of Peter wanting people around him who totally understand the material and the work ethic." ...|$|E

He thanked UTV Chairman Ronnie Screwvala for his unrelenting support. Bhansali made headlines {{for the day when}} he said that Aishwarya Rai was [...] ".. his muse, his jaan, and I get terribly excited when I make a film with her because she is very, very special. Some people are timeless and Aishwarya will be there for another 20 years". About the lead actor he said, [...] "I have never enjoyed working with any other actor as much as I have enjoyed working with Hrithik, just for the kind of talent he has, for the kind of person he is". He also revealed the reason why he became the musical director of the movie, [...] "The reason behind doing the music of the film is that I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> the characters and understand what they would express musically more than any other music director. Some deep thoughts are my concern, so whatever little music I knew, it was a sort of experiment. But I am happy with what I have done,".|$|E

Quite so. Quite so. Her native air. Depend upon it, that's {{the best place for}} her. By all means, I should say, try Haiti." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> the {{elements}} of Mrs. Sanderson's character at that time quite well, with one exception. Unfortunately, I stopped too soon in my analysis. I innocently {{took it for granted}} that she possessed a moral side to her worldly and perhaps frivolous nature.
