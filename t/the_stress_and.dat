5|$|The film begins {{during the}} thirtieth {{year of the}} show. During the day, Truman notices strange occurrences that all seem {{centered}} on him (a falling spotlight, rain that only falls on him). Truman spots a disheveled man and recognizes him as his father, who had snuck back into the set, but actors quickly drag the man away. Despite efforts by Meryl and Truman's best friend Marlon to reassure Truman, Truman becomes even more suspicious about his life. One day, he takes Meryl by surprise by going on an impromptu road trip, but their way is blocked by apparent and increasingly implausible emergencies. Meryl begins to break down from <b>the</b> <b>stress,</b> <b>and</b> during an argument with Truman, breaks character and is later taken off the show. Truman, depressed and confused, is consoled by Marlon, and Christof uses the opportunity to re-introduce Truman's father to the show properly, {{under the guise of}} having lost his memory after the boating accident, in the hope of bringing Truman back to some emotional stability and a controllable state.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn the literature, it {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that residual surface <b>stress</b> <b>and</b> surface elasticity are two equally important parts of surface <b>stress</b> theory <b>and</b> that, generally, neither of these aspects can be neglected. In this paper, we develop a non-classical formulation of the Boussinesq problem with the surface effect, in which both <b>the</b> residual surface <b>stress</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> surface elasticity are considered. To {{take into account the}} surface effect, a Lagrangian description of the governing equations of the surface is adopted. The theoretical and numerical results in this paper show that the contributions of <b>the</b> residual surface <b>stress</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> surface elasticity to <b>the</b> <b>stresses</b> <b>and</b> displacements at <b>the</b> surface are not always equal. <b>The</b> residual surface <b>stress</b> mostly influences <b>the</b> normal <b>stress,</b> whereas <b>the</b> surface elasticity is a dominant factor in <b>the</b> in-plane shear <b>stress.</b> As an application of this formulation, the three-dimensional Hertzian contact problem at the nanoscale is studied. It is concluded that the surface effect strengthens the elastic contact stiffness. The smaller the contact region, the larger the contact stiffness. Finally, in terms of the dimensionless surface parameters, the influences of <b>the</b> residual surface <b>stress</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> surface elasticity on <b>the</b> <b>stresses</b> <b>and</b> displacements are further studied, and a simple scaling law for <b>the</b> <b>stresses</b> <b>and</b> displacements at <b>the</b> surface is constructed for the first time...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} <b>stresses</b> <b>and</b> excess {{pore fluid}} pressure that are induced in a saturated poroelastic soil of halfspace extent by a concentrated line load. The line load is {{moving at a}} constant velocity along {{the surface of the}} poroelastic halfspace. The governing equations for the proposed analysis are based on the Biot's theory of dynamics in saturated poroelastic soils. The governing partial differential equations are solved using Fourier transforms. The solutions for <b>the</b> <b>stresses</b> <b>and</b> excess pore pressure are expressed in the forms of inverse Fourier transforms. The numerical results are obtained by performing the numerical inversion of the transform integrals. A parametric study is presented to illustrate the influences of the velocity of moving load and the poroelastic material parameters on <b>the</b> <b>stresses</b> <b>and</b> excess pore pressure. At a high velocity, the maximum values of <b>the</b> <b>stresses</b> in a poroelastic halfspace are smaller than those in an elastic solid, whilst at a low velocity <b>the</b> <b>stresses</b> in a poroelastic halfspace are larger than those in an elastic halfspace.
