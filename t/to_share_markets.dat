The disclosure of information produced by listing is claimed to be necessary so Chinese state owned banks can compete with foreign banks, meeting China’s WTO obligations. Events in the Bank of China (Hong Kong) Holdings Ltd (BOCHK) in 2003 show that information disclosure <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>markets</b> is an imperfect way to efficiently manage corporate capital. The sudden removal from Hong Kong to Beijing of the BOCHK’s CEO and the non-disclosure of information about it reveals its weaknesses. Disclosure focused on media, rather than regulatory, requirements. The opacity formed by the coincidence of state power and ownership in mainland China and the jurisdictional boundary with Hong Kong was increased in Hong Kong by the investor relations professionals. Information came to be manipulated by the bank’s investor relations advisers. The ostensible openness of the bank was used by regulators to justify further inaction. Rather than increasing transparency the BOC(HK) experience suggests that {{the economic and political}} power of Chinese companies, and their state shareholders, may lead to less transparency outside mainland China...|$|E

40|$|Recently {{a body of}} {{literature}} has emerged from the United States that attempts to quantify and explain the role the media plays {{in the provision of}} financial information <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>markets.</b> This paper extends that line of enquiry by focusing on the implications for the accounting profession of various forms of alternative, frequently mediadriven, financial information providers. The paper briefly examines the demographic changes in the Australian share markets and adopts a ‘value chain’ approach in its analysis {{of the relationship between the}} media and the accounting profession. It highlights the growth in the media’s provision of financial information, analysis and advice and examines the response of the accounting discipline to the changes in the ‘financial information’ market. Finally, the paper suggests that for the accounting profession to maintain its members’ presence in the financial information market it will need to rigorously develop and differentiate its knowledge set to reinforce its value against the growing competition for financial advice coming from ‘new’ media. We suggest that to achieve this goal the discipline will need to develop and adopt a more holistic intradisciplinary ‘evidence based’ knowledge management system approach to maintaining and developing its knowledge set. 13 page(s...|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{an economic}} model for private commons {{that consists of}} network providers serving a fixed primary demand and making strategic pricing decisions to improve their revenues by providing service to a secondary demand. For general forms of secondary demand, we establish the existence and uniqueness of two critical prices for each provider: the break-even price and the <b>market</b> <b>sharing</b> price. The prior determines service profitability while the latter determines a provider’s willingness <b>to</b> <b>share</b> the <b>market.</b> We further show that the <b>market</b> <b>sharing</b> price is always greater than the breakeven price, leading to a price interval in which a provider is both profitable and willing <b>to</b> <b>share</b> the <b>market.</b> Making use of these results, we shed insight {{into the nature of}} market outcomes (Nash equilibria) when two providers compete to attract secondary demand: (i) if the <b>market</b> <b>sharing</b> intervals of the two providers overlap, then the providers end up sharing the market; (ii) else, the provider with the lower break-even price captures the entire market {{as the result of a}} price war. 1...|$|R
