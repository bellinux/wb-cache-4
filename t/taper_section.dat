40|$|To {{get high}} output power with good beam quality, a <b>tapered</b> <b>section</b> is {{introduced}} to large-mode-area (LMA) Yb-doped fiber laser. Output {{characteristics of the}} fiber laser without <b>tapered</b> <b>section</b> and with <b>tapered</b> <b>section</b> are compared experimentally. When the launched pump power is 119. 1 W, 77. 9 W with M- 2 3. 08 and 56. 4 W with M- 2 1. 14 can be obtained, respectively. The corresponding slope efficiencies are 71. 8 % and 54. 1 %, respectively. Although output power of the tapered fiber laser has 30. 6 % penalty, brightness of it is as much as 5. 28 times of the fiber laser without <b>tapered</b> <b>section.</b> Moreover, spectra of them are measured.

A real commercial aircraft is used as a model {{in order to create a}} wing model by using finite element modelling techniques through the use of ABAQUS software. The development of the wing model involves the creation of each of the structural members of the wing, the joint of them in order to create the final model, the creation of the mesh necessary for the analysis and the application of the loads to perform an analysis that accurately predicts the stresses and displacement that the wing withstands. Two different models are presented, one consisting on one <b>tapered</b> <b>section</b> wing and the second consisting on a wing with two <b>tapered</b> <b>sections.</b> These models are subjected to two different wing loads in cruise conditions, a simplified triangular load and a load that represents a real distribution of aerodynamic loads in the wing. In order to create the final wing model made of carbon fiber material, the wing is analyzed first by using the two different geometries presented and aluminum material. The wing model evolves from the one <b>tapered</b> <b>section</b> wing under triangular loads using aluminum material to the second model under real distribution loads using carbon fiber material.

40|$|Tapered diode lasers combine {{high output}} {{power and a}} beam quality near to the {{diffraction}} limit resulting in very high brightness. Therefore, they are finding use {{in a wide range}} of applications today, such as pumping of rare-earth-doped fibre amplifiers, tunable frequency doubling of diode lasers for blue-green outputs, and non linear spectroscopy. Due to increasing brightness and lifetime tapered lasers even become attractive for material processing and for telecom applications like pumping of Er-doped fiber amplifiers or raman amplifiers. In order to further enhance the brightness of tapered diode lasers the output power has to be increased while simultaneously the beam quality has to be kept near the diffraction limit.

The tradeâoff between capacity and safety at motorway roadworks represents a dilemma for the traffic engineer. Capacity is reduced with the closure of one or more lanes to traffic. Lower operating speeds may be observed due to the substandard layout and to the lower speed limits imposed on site. Speed cameras are sometimes introduced to enforce the posted speed limits. Observations suggest that traffic behaviour at the approach to a roadwork section differs in terms of driversâ operating speeds and their choice of lanes. Speed differentials close to the merge section could be a contributory cause of flow breakdowns and are a danger to roadâusers and workers alike. In addition, some drivers force themselves into the path of others on adjacent lanes by accepting smaller gaps to merge into especially when they are getting closer to the <b>taper</b> <b>section.</b> Previous work suggests that higher accident rates are usually associated with roadwork sections compared with normal motorway ones...|$|E

A cost-efficient way to realize high-power high-brightness devices is the tapered resonator concept. We demonstrate InGaAsP/InP based diode lasers with compressively strained quantum wells and wavelengths around 1480 nm which were grown by solid source MBE. From broad area lasers with variations in quantum well number and waveguide layer thickness, parameters for the logarithmic gain model are deduced. With their implementation in 2 -dimensional BPM simulations, an optimized resonator geometry is derived. Devices employ a 500 Âµm ridge section followed by a 2000 Âµm <b>taper</b> <b>section</b> with 6 Â° angle. Continuous-wave (cw) output powers reach more than 1. 5 W.
