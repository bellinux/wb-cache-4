Alternative fits to X-ray spectra of ten late-type dwarfs from ROSAT are made using the latest available versions of the radiative power loss codes of Raymond and Smith, Landini and Monsignori Fossi, and Mewe et al [...] Differences between these codes are found to arise from the choice of atomic physics {{and the number of}} transitions included. The resulting coronal temperatures and emission measures are found to follow correlations proposed by Montesinos and Jordan (1993). The lower <b>transition</b> <b>region</b> is modelled using observations made with the International Ultraviolet Explorer and up-to-date atomic data. Models of the upper <b>transition</b> <b>region</b> and corona are derived assuming a balance between the radiative and conductive losses. Wave pressure is included in these models for the first time. Recent observations with the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer aid the choice of starting parameters. The calculations are carried out in plane parallel and spherically symmetric geometries. The models of the lower and upper <b>transition</b> <b>region</b> are then combined; the spherically symmetric models of the upper <b>transition</b> <b>region</b> fit more smoothly on to those of the lower <b>transition</b> <b>region</b> than do the plane parallel models. The new model of Procyon and new measurements of N e resolve a previous discrepancy which led to suggestions that emission in the <b>transition</b> <b>region</b> is restricted in area. The heating requirements are examined. In the five dwarfs, but not in Procyon, the conductive fluxes {{at the base of the}} upper <b>transition</b> <b>region</b> are found to exceed the radiative energy losses for the layers immediately below. In Procyon, it is shown that acoustic wave heating is a viable mechanism for heating the lower <b>transition</b> <b>region</b> and corona, while the correlation of coronal properties with the dynamo Rossby number suggest that magnetic heating models are more likely for the five dwarfs. </p...|$|R
