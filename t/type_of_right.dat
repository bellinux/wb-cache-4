50|$|In the European Economic Area (European Union member countries, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), a {{supplementary}} protection certificate (SPC) is a sui generis {{intellectual property}} (IP) right that extends {{the duration of}} certain rights associated with a patent. It enters into force after expiry of a patent upon which it is based. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> is available for various regulated, biologically active agents, namely human or veterinary medicaments and plant protection products (e.g. insecticides, and herbicides). Supplementary protection certificates were introduced to encourage innovation by compensating for the long time needed to obtain regulatory approval of these products (i.e. authorisation to put these products on the market).|$|E
5000|$|Denationalized {{citizenship}} {{and an increase}} in self-determination can create new political spaces and arenas of participation. Denationalized citizenship may empower groups such as women who could establish a public presence and make claims on the state. [...] Therefore denationalized citizenship exists partly due to the actions of the excluded. Increased civil rights facilitate the denationalization of citizenship as citizens can make claims against their nation-states and act autonomously in the political sphere. Denationalized citizenship reflects the evolving and progressing capacity of democracy and the democratization of citizenship is therefore linked to denationalization and the changing authority of nation-states. Another <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> which denationalizes citizenship is the portable rights within the European Union, for example, where there is a change in recognition from citizens of a nation-state to individuals as individuals. Denationalized citizenship calls for a new understanding of citizenship as a concept which encompasses many, at times overlapping, communities and feelings of belonging and identification.|$|E

40|$|Survival {{analysis}} {{is becoming increasingly}} important in the prevention and social sciences literature. When using survival analysis methods in social science and prevention applications {{it is important to}} identify the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> censoring occurring in the data, so that the appropriate risk set can be used in estimation of the hazard function. In this article we review the two most widely used approaches to estimating the hazard function and the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> censoring these methods assume. A <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> censoring that occurs frequently in social science studies involving prospective longitudinal panel designs is retro-censoring which occurs when a subject's response is necessarily lost in the interval in which the subject is censored. When retro-censoring occurs, the naive use of popular methods from biostatistics and other fields to estimate hazard probabilities will lead to biased estimators and inflated Type I error rates. However, once identified, retro-censoring is easily ac [...] ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the understanding of children's rights in 63 (9 -, 11 -, and 13 -year-olds) mixed-race South African children and their mothers. In individual semi-structured interviews participants responded to hypothetical vignettes in which children's nurturance and self-determination rights conflicted with parental authority in the home. Participants were required {{to decide whether they}} should support the story characters' rights and provide justifications for their responses. Findings indicated that both children and mothers were more likely to endorse children's nurturance than self-determination rights. In contrast to previous research, {{no significant differences were found}} between children and mothers in terms of support for either <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>right.</b> In terms of reasoning, both children's and mothers' responses revealed distinct patterns of thinking influenced by the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> under consideration.

To investigate the neural basis of GO, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to measure brain activities of subjects engaged in playing GO. Enhanced activations were observed in many cortical areas, such as dorsal prefrontal, parietal, occipital, posterior temporal, and primary somatosensory and motor areas.

40|$|Abstract: Right bundle branch {{block is}} an electrocardiographic {{phenomenon}} with specific criteria. Currently, two specific forms of right bundle branch block are acknowledged, a proximal and a distal variant. A {{vast array of}} pathologies can cause proximal, distal or even combined forms of right bundle branch block. In this study {{it is suggested that}} a third <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> bundle branch block exist: one caused by a subaortic muscular tendon in the left ventricle, leading to an increased velocity of conduction in the left ventricle, with a resultant “relative ” right bundle branch block. It is concluded that it is necessary (and time) {{to take a closer look}} at endoventricular structures in the assessment of structural causes of right bundle branch block. ...|$|E

In addition, it is shown that there exists a one-input automaton whose transformation semigroup has its order greater than any polynomial function of the number of states and that the index and the period of the transformation semigroup of a one-input automaton can be determined in time proportional to the number of states. A one-input automaton with the minimum number of states such that its transformation semigroup is isomorphic to a given cyclic one is also discussed...|$|E

It is argued that this literature either gives insufficient attention {{to the nature of}} the Indonesian state or does so in a way that obscures the interests of the country's powerful politico-business oligarchy.

40|$|We use the {{additional}} variables of suitably enlarged superspaces to write new actions for extended objects, with kappa-symmetry, {{in such a}} way that the tension emerges from them as an integration constant. Our actions correspond to the spacetime scale-invariant ones previously considered by Bergshoeff et al. once the worldvolume forms introduced there are reinterpreted in terms of fields associated with the coordinates of the enlarged superspaces. It is shown that the kappa-symmetry of the new actions is given by a certain <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> local transformations of the extended superspace groups. Further, we also show that the enlarged superspaces that allow for strictly invariant Wess-Zumino terms also lead to strict kappa-invariance i. e., the Lagrangian itself (not only the action) is both supersymmetry- and kappa-invariant.
