5|$|Burnell {{was behind}} {{the efforts of the}} royal {{officials}} to enforce royal rights during his term of office as chancellor, including <b>the</b> <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Quo warranto procedures. He also helped with the legislative and legal reforms of Edward's reign. During Burnell's tenure the chancellor's office and records became fixed in London rather than travelling with the king. Burnell went abroad on diplomatic missions for Edward, and for a time governed Gascony. He continued to enjoy the king's trust until his death in 1292; one historian has suggested that Burnell may have been the most important royal official of the 13th century.|$|E

We conclude with some possible future directions. SAGE is a general purpose computer algebra system started in 2005 which includes (among many other packages) GAP, for group theory, Maxima, for symbolic computation, Pari, for number theory, and Singular, for multivari-ate polynomial computations and commutative algebra. SAGE uses Python as its interpretive language.

5|$|Heartbleed is a {{security}} bug in the OpenSSL cryptography library, {{which is a}} widely used implementation of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. It was introduced into the software in 2012 and publicly disclosed in April 2014.

It results from improper input validation (due to a missing bounds check) in <b>the</b> <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TLS heartbeat extension, thus the bug's name derives from heartbeat. The vulnerability is classified as a buffer over-read, a situation where more data can be read than should be allowed.|$|E
