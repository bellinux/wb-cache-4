5|$|Further reviews came in {{this time}} as Defence {{planners}} attempted {{to grapple with the}} questions regarding strategy following the wars of diplomacy of the previous three decades. The emergence of the Defence of Australia doctrine as the foundation upon which Australian defence policy would be based following Paul Dibb's 1986 review of Australia's defence capabilities seemed to provide <b>the</b> <b>Reserves</b> with a definite role. Nevertheless, there remained a reluctance to rebuild <b>the</b> <b>Reserves</b> and despite these major reviews, as late as the 1990s the Army still had not managed to develop a well-structured reserve force, as it had continued to grapple with the competing demands of maintaining large-scale general readiness over developing a 'hard core' of capability within <b>the</b> <b>Reserves</b> that would be able to provide the Army with a nucleus force in times of national emergency.|$|E
50|$|The Skyhook {{system is}} {{engineered}} {{so that it}} should not interfere with reserve deployment activated by directly pulling <b>the</b> <b>reserve</b> rip cord in situations where no main parachute had been deployed. The key component in the system, from which the Skyhook derives its name, is a cantilevered hook that grasps <b>the</b> <b>reserve</b> bridle about midway between <b>the</b> <b>reserve</b> pilot chute and the bag containing <b>the</b> packed <b>reserve</b> chute. If <b>the</b> departing main parachute applies more pull force on the bridle than <b>the</b> <b>reserve</b> pilot chute, then the main parachute will remain hooked onto <b>the</b> <b>reserve</b> bridle, and so it will pull <b>the</b> <b>reserve</b> parachute out of <b>the</b> <b>reserve</b> compartment. If <b>the</b> <b>reserve</b> pilot chute exerts more pull force on the bridle than the main parachute, then the main parachute will unhook and <b>the</b> <b>reserve</b> pilot chute will deploy <b>the</b> <b>reserve</b> parachute normally.|$|R

5|$|In 1929 {{the company}} asked HM Treasury for an {{extension}} of the period in which government loans to the company could be paid. The Treasury first demanded an audit of the company accounts, and sent Sir William McClintock to write a report on the financial state of the company. McClintock's report revealed that the company had not earned any trading profits since 1925, but was still paying dividends by taking money from <b>the</b> <b>reserves.</b> The company had reported £439,000 profits for 1926, but had drawn £750,000 out of <b>the</b> <b>reserves</b> and falsified accounts to make it appear that the money came from trading. In 1927 the company made a trading loss of £507,000, but money was again drawn from <b>the</b> <b>reserves</b> to make it appear that the company had made a profit of £478,000. As a result of this, and a report that in 1928 the company had issued a fraudulent prospectus inviting customers to buy shares in the company and saying that it had earned an average £500,000 a year in the last decade, arrest warrants were issued for Lord Kylsant and John Moreland, the company auditor. At the time the ruse was discovered the company had a trading deficit of £300,000 a year, <b>the</b> <b>reserves</b> were completely exhausted, and the company owed £10 million.|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} other major rivers in <b>the</b> <b>reserve.</b> <b>The</b> Tjulån River {{originates}} at the Tjulträsk lakes and joins the Vindel River in Ammarnäs. The Juktån River passes the great lake Överst Juktan and continues outside <b>the</b> <b>reserve</b> to Ume River {{for a total}} length of 170 km. Finally the Tärnaån River originates at Lake Tärnasjön before joining into the Ume River just outside <b>the</b> <b>reserve.</b> <b>The</b> Ume River itself is located outside <b>the</b> <b>reserve,</b> between <b>the</b> Artfjället mountain ranges {{and the rest of}} <b>the</b> <b>reserve</b> and unlike <b>the</b> rivers within <b>the</b> <b>reserve,</b> its waters have been regulated and used for hydroelectric power.|$|R
50|$|At present several {{villages are}} located inside <b>the</b> <b>reserve</b> and many rural {{communities}} near <b>the</b> <b>reserve.</b> In 1985 {{a number of}} agricultural lands were taken from their owners to be incorporated into <b>the</b> <b>reserve</b> and land grants were compensated elsewhere. Now 40 households use 20 hectares of ranges inside <b>the</b> <b>reserve</b> and to an extent overlap between <b>the</b> <b>reserve</b> and land-use boundaries allows locals to violate the legal protection of <b>the</b> <b>reserve.</b> An example of this, is the Gorovan Sands Sanctuary which near <b>the</b> <b>reserve</b> {{is known to be}} Armenia's only protected true desert reserve has been exploited from sand mining and livestock grazing.|$|R
