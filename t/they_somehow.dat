25|$|Salme's Advanced Guard, {{which was}} posted near Sant' Imento {{north of the}} highway, was unchallenged most of the day. At about 2:30 pm, the {{divisions}} of Montrichard and Olivier crossed the Trebbia and marched to Salme's support. Seeing these French reinforcements in his front, Melas decided not to release Fröhlich's division. The Third Column commander sent Ott forward at 6:00 pm and the Austrians easily brushed aside Salme's outnumbered unit. Together, Ott and Fröhlich pushed Montrichard and Olivier back beyond the Trebbia by evening. That night in a bizarre operation, Rosenberg took two Russian grenadier battalions across the Trebbia south of Gossolengo. <b>They</b> <b>somehow</b> penetrated the French lines as far as Settima where they routed a French detachment and liberated some prisoners. At 3:00 am, Rosenberg's expedition {{headed back to the}} west bank, again without arousing any French sentries. Four squadrons of the Karaczay Dragoons mounted a similar expedition but were detected and driven off by musketry. Both groups missed the pointless battle that occurred earlier in the evening. Hearing what they believed to be Moreau's artillery, three French battalions mounted an extemporaneous attack at 9:30 pm, surprising an Austrian battalion. Melas called up reinforcements from his own and Förster's divisions while Prince Liechtenstein charged into the fray with the Lobkowitz Dragoons. The artillery of both sides opened up on the melee, causing many friendly fire casualties. After strenuous efforts, the leaders of both sides managed to wind down the senseless fighting by 11:00 pm.|$|E

500|$|The {{interpretation}} of the 1837 and 1842 treaties remains ambiguous, as the US government claimed the Ojibwa ceded title to the lands, and the Ojibwa claimed they ceded only resource rights. The government had stated that the lands of the Ojibwa were unsuitable for farming and white settlement. The Ojibwa did obtain annuity payments to be paid each year at La Pointe, and reserved the right to hunt, fish, gather, and move across any lands outlined in the treaties.

He facetiously critiqued that the album's songs [...] "may reek of stale joss sticks and patchouli-scented self-actualisation, but in their very datedness <b>they</b> <b>somehow</b> sound very modern." [...] Pitchfork journalist Sean Fennessey felt Axelrod's first two records were [...] "essential if only as a tour guide through early 90s hip-hop", having [...] "literally been a rap producer's delight for years".

2500|$|The {{neurotic}} person's self {{is split}} between an idealized self {{and a real}} self. As a result, neurotic individuals feel that <b>they</b> <b>somehow</b> do {{not live up to}} the ideal self. They feel that there is a flaw somewhere in comparison to what they [...] "should" [...] be. The goals set out by the neurotic are not , or indeed possible. The real self then degenerates into a [...] "despised self", and the neurotic person assumes that this is the [...] "true" [...] self. Thus, the neurotic is like a clock's pendulum, oscillating between a fallacious [...] "perfection" [...] and a manifestation of self-hate. Horney referred to this phenomenon as the [...] "tyranny of the shoulds" [...] and the neurotic's hopeless [...] "search for glory". She concluded that these ingrained traits of the psyche forever prevent an individual's potential from being actualized unless the cycle of neurosis is somehow broken, through treatment or, in less severe cases, life lessons.|$|E
2500|$|Kung is the Wade-Giles {{romanisation}} of Mandarin pronunciation of {{the same}} Chinese character , now spelt Gōng in pinyin. It {{is not really a}} name but a part of a descriptive title — [...] "The Respectful Prince of the Blood" [...] — previously borne by Changning, the fifth son of the Shunzhi Emperor. The Chinese title [...] translates literally as [...] "king" [...] but is usually understood as a [...] "prince" [...] in terms of the imperial Chinese nobility. Because Changning's rank had not been given [...] "iron-cap" [...] status, each generation of his descendants were reduced in rank unless <b>they</b> <b>somehow</b> proved themselves anew and earned a new title of their own. Yixin, however, was given [...] "iron-cap" [...] status and his direct heirs inherited his full title as well. In English, however, it is usually misunderstood as a name: PrinceKung in older sources and PrinceGong in newer ones. He was also sometimes known as the [...] "Sixth Prince" [...] or, less flatteringly, [...] "Devil #6". He was posthumously known as [...] "the Respectful and Loyal Prince of the Blood": Prince Kung-chung or Gongzhong.|$|E
2500|$|Foreign {{visitors}} reported generally favorably on the autobahns, {{particularly the}} foreign press in Germany for the 1936 Olympics; in October 1937 {{it was noted}} that an English visitor had remarked on the [...] "real democracy" [...] at an autobahn work site, and in September 1936 the former British Prime Minister David Lloyd-George visited Hitler partly to discuss the autobahns, and returned home calling him a [...] "great man". But they were also regarded as inhumane. Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. described their version of the parkway design as [...] "a horrid clash of nature and technics." [...] In his critical book on Nazi Germany, The House That Hitler Built, historian Stephen Henry Roberts described them as [...] "needlessly grandiose but most impressive. Efficiently made and more efficiently managed, <b>they</b> <b>somehow</b> reduce the individual to insignificance." [...] Walter Dirks may also have intended veiled criticism when he wrote in the Frankfurter Zeitung in 1938 of autobahn driving as overwhelmingly passive: [...] "It is a mark of how passive we are, of how much the sweep of road affects our senses, that the relationship between driver and road seems to be reversed. The road takes the active role, moving toward us quickly and smoothly,... sucking the car inexorably into itself." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the battle, the Army of Italy was {{hemmed in}} between the crests of the Ligurian Alps on {{the north and the}} Ligurian Sea on the south. During the course of the war, the Italian Riviera had been denuded of {{supplies}} so provisions had to be shipped from France in order to sustain the army. The supply convoys were often held up by foul winds or British warships. On top of this, the soldiers had not been paid in five months and their clothing and shoes were worn out. In these conditions, many men deserted but soon the soldiers broke out in mutiny. In one incident, Championnet and Suchet were faced with 3,000 mutineers who had only received rations on six days out of the last thirty. <b>They</b> <b>somehow</b> convinced the soldiers to return to duty. The men of the Genoa garrison announced to Saint-Cyr that they were marching back to France. The general dissuaded them by pointing out that they would certainly starve to death on the long march along the Riviera. Fortunately, supply ships reached Genoa just in time. Watrin's division abandoned its positions, leaving only their officers and sous-officiers holding Bocchetta Pass. The men were only persuaded to stop by the news that the Genoa garrison had decided to remain; they got back before the Austrians could seize the pass. Championnet was in despair at the misery of his men.|$|E
2500|$|Challenging the {{traditional}} view monetarists and New Keynesians like J. Bradford DeLong, Lawrence Summers and Christina Romer argued that recovery was essentially complete prior to 1942 and that monetary policy was the crucial source of pre-1942 recovery. The extraordinary growth in money supply beginning in 1933 lowered real {{interest rates and}} stimulated investment spending. According to Bernanke {{there was also a}} debt-deflation effect of the depression which was clearly offset by a reflation through the growth in money supply. But before 1992 scholars did not realize that the New Deal provided for a huge aggregate demand stimulus through a de facto easing of monetary policy. While Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz argued in [...] "Monetary History of the United States" [...] (1963) that the Federal Reserve System had made no attempt to increase the quantity in high-powered money and thus failed to foster recovery <b>they</b> <b>somehow</b> did not investigate the impact of the monetary policy of the New Deal. In 1992 Christina Romer explained in [...] "What Ended the Great Depression?" [...] that the rapid growth in money supply beginning in 1933 {{can be traced back to}} a large unsterilized gold inflow to the US which was partly due to political instability in Europe but to a larger degree to the revaluation of gold through the Gold Reserve Act. The Roosevelt administration had chosen not to sterilize the gold inflow precisely because they hoped that the growth of money supply would stimulate the economy.|$|E
2500|$|Since the 1960s, Chomsky has {{maintained}} that syntactic knowledge {{is at least}} partially inborn, implying that children need only learn certain parochial features of their native languages. Chomsky based his argument on observations about human language acquisition, noting {{that there is an}} enormous gap between the linguistic stimuli to which children are exposed and the rich linguistic knowledge they attain (see: [...] "poverty of the stimulus" [...] argument). For example, although children are exposed to only a finite subset of the allowable syntactic variants within their first language, <b>they</b> <b>somehow</b> acquire the ability to understand and produce an infinite number of sentences, including ones that have never before been uttered. To explain this, Chomsky reasoned that the primary linguistic data (PLD) must be supplemented by an innate linguistic capacity. Furthermore, while a human baby and a kitten are both capable of inductive reasoning, if they are exposed to exactly the same linguistic data, the human will always acquire the ability to understand and produce language, while the kitten will never acquire either ability. Chomsky labeled whatever relevant capacity the human has that the cat lacks as the language acquisition device (LAD), and he suggested that one of the tasks for linguistics should be to determine what the LAD is and what constraints it imposes on the range of possible human languages. The universal features that would result from these constraints constitute [...] "universal grammar".|$|E
