2500|$|An {{electrostatic}} detection device, or EDD, is a specialized {{piece of equipment}} commonly used in questioned document examination to reveal [...] in paper that may otherwise go unnoticed. It is a non-destructive technique (will not damage the evidence in question), allowing further tests to be carried out. It is a sensitive technique capable of detecting indentations on pages several layers below the <b>top</b> <b>sheet</b> and many years after the indentations were created.|$|E
2500|$|Scaling up {{this design}} and adding a <b>top</b> <b>sheet</b> gives a wiggler magnet, used in Synchrotrons and free {{electron}} lasers. Wiggler magnets wiggle or oscillate an electron beam {{perpendicular to the}} magnetic field. As the electrons are undergoing acceleration they radiate electromagnetic energy in their flight direction, and as they interact with the light already emitted, photons along its line are emitted in phase, resulting in a [...] "laser-like" [...] monochromatic and coherent beam.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} examine {{objective}} evaluation equations for disposable diaper's <b>top</b> <b>sheets,</b> representative <b>top</b> <b>sheets</b> are evaluated by those equations and by subjective method comparing with reusable diaper's fabrics. Following conclusions were obtained. Objective evaluation equation for primary hand (DPCM- 1) is useful for calculation of primary hands "NAMERAKASA" and "KOSHI", however, it is not effective to "SOFUTOSA" and "FUKURAMI". Two objective evaluation equations for total hand value (THV) (DPCM- 2, 3) are both available for <b>top</b> <b>sheets.</b> THV decreased {{in the order of}} spunbond, air-through, meltblow, and spunlace for both objective and subjective values. Used fabric for reusable diapers examined here (plain weave) has higher "NAMERAKASA", "SOFUTOSA" "FUKURAMI" and THV, however, lower "KOSHI" than the original fabric. © 2008 The Textile Machinery Society of Japan...|$|R

60|$|Jake agreed, {{and picking}} up the pad thought the <b>top</b> <b>sheet</b> had been hurriedly removed, because a torn {{fragment}} projected from the leather clip.

Forel was a kindly man, but he knew that speculation in Western mines has its under-side, and it was for the girl's sake he stripped off the <b>top</b> <b>sheet</b> of the blotting-pad, which had a recent impression on it, and afterwards poured the remaining contents of a wineglass out into the stove. Then he glanced all round the room before he went out to send for a doctor. It was an hour later when he found his wife alone.|$|E
50|$|A <b>top</b> <b>sheet</b> is a {{flat sheet}} which bed {{occupants}} lie underneath. Blankets, quilts, duvets/comforters and other bed covers are laid over the <b>top</b> <b>sheet,</b> {{but because of}} the <b>top</b> <b>sheet</b> they do not directly touch the bed occupant.|$|E
50|$|However, a <b>top</b> <b>sheet</b> {{has its own}} advantages. First, a tucked-in <b>top</b> <b>sheet</b> {{can provide}} a {{comfortable}} feeling of snugness that duvets cannot, as duvets are not usually large enough to tuck under the mattress. Second, top sheets allow {{a wider range of}} blanket choices besides duvets, such as quilts.|$|E

50|$|A {{sheet of}} carbon paper is placed between {{two or more}} sheets of paper. The {{pressure}} applied by the writing implement (pen, pencil, typewriter or impact printer) to the <b>top</b> <b>sheet</b> causes pigment from the carbon paper to make a similar mark on the copy sheet(s). More than one copy {{can be made by}} stacking several sheets with carbon paper between each pair. Four or five copies is a practical limit. The <b>top</b> <b>sheet</b> is the original and each of the additional sheets is called a carbon copy.|$|E
5000|$|The third sheet is {{carbon paper}} (purple/blue). Pressing this coating layer with {{something}} sharp or applying heat, the ink {{is transferred to}} the <b>top</b> <b>sheet</b> leaving a purple/blue image.|$|E
50|$|Top {{sheets are}} {{standard}} in the U.S., but much of Europe prefers to use duvet covers. A duvet cover consists of two rectangles sewn together on all but one side to create a sleeve for the duvet, which can be taken off and washed. When no other blankets are lain atop the covered duvet, it can provide several advantages over a <b>top</b> <b>sheet.</b> First, respecting sanitation, with a <b>top</b> <b>sheet</b> the bed occupant could accidentally in the night remove the barrier {{between himself and the}} duvet (which is less washable); with a duvet cover this is impossible. Second, for households with children, a bed with a covered duvet is easier to make: the child need only tug the corners of the duvet back towards the corners of the bed. Tucking in a <b>top</b> <b>sheet</b> before arranging the duvet is an extra step. Third, switching a duvet cover is a cheaper way to change color schemes than buying a new comforter.|$|E

50|$|Instead of {{inserting}} a special sheet {{in between the}} original and the intended copy, carbonless copy paper has micro-encapsulated dye or ink {{on the back side}} of the <b>top</b> <b>sheet,</b> and a clay coating on the front side of the bottom sheet. When pressure is applied (from writing or impact printing), the dye capsules rupture and react with the clay to form a permanent mark duplicating the markings made to the <b>top</b> <b>sheet.</b> Intermediary sheets, with clay on the front and dye capsules on the back, can be used to create multiple copies; this may be referred to as multipart stationery.|$|E
50|$|Another {{approach}} {{involves the}} use of design to simplify the bed-making. For instance, Smart Bedding's bedding set connects the <b>top</b> <b>sheet</b> and duvet to make it for easy bed-making as well as a better night's sleep.|$|E

The {{pressure}} of writing or typing on the <b>top</b> <b>sheet</b> transferred colored wax to its back side, producing a mirror image of the desired marks. (This acted like a reverse of carbon paper.) The wax-supply sheet was then removed and discarded, and the other sheet (containing the images) was fastened onto the drum of the (manual or electrical) machine, with the waxed (back, or reverse-image) side out.|$|E
