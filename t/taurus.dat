5|$|In Greek mythology, <b>Taurus</b> was {{identified}} with Zeus, who assumed {{the form of}} a magnificent white bull to abduct Europa, a legendary Phoenician princess. In illustrations of Greek mythology, only the front portion of this constellation are depicted; this was sometimes explained as <b>Taurus</b> being partly submerged as he carried Europa out to sea. A second Greek myth portrays <b>Taurus</b> as Io, a mistress of Zeus. To hide his lover from his wife Hera, Zeus changed Io into {{the form of a}} heifer. Greek mythographer Acusilaus marks the bull <b>Taurus</b> as the same that formed the myth of the Cretan Bull, one of The Twelve Labors of Heracles.|$|E
5|$|In late 2015, the PGSO {{received}} Ford <b>Taurus</b> Police Interceptors {{for use in}} its vehicular fleet.|$|E
5|$|<b>Taurus</b> {{became an}} {{important}} object of worship among the Druids. Their Tauric religious festival was held while the Sun passed through the constellation. Among the arctic people known as the Inuit, the constellation is called Sakiattiat and the Hyades is Nanurjuk, with the latter representing {{the spirit of the}} polar bear. Aldebaran represents the bear, with the remainder of the stars in the Hyades being dogs that are holding the beast at bay. In Buddhism, legends hold that Gautama Buddha was born when the Full Moon was in Vaisakha, or <b>Taurus.</b> Buddha's birthday is celebrated with the Wesak Festival, or Vesākha, which occurs on the first or second Full Moon when the Sun is in <b>Taurus.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Taurus</b> {{is a big}} and {{prominent}} constellation in the northern hemisphere's winter sky, between Aries {{to the west and}} Gemini to the east; to the north lie Perseus and Auriga, to the southeast Orion, to the south Eridanus, and to the southwest Cetus. In September and October, <b>Taurus</b> is visible in the evening along the eastern horizon. The most favorable time to observe <b>Taurus</b> in the night sky is during the months of December and January. By March and April, the constellation will appear to the west during the evening twilight.|$|E
5|$|This {{constellation}} forms {{part of the}} zodiac, {{and hence}} is intersected by the ecliptic. This circle across the celestial sphere forms the apparent path of the Sun as the Earth completes its annual orbit. As the orbital plane of the Moon and the planets lie near the ecliptic, they can usually {{be found in the}} constellation <b>Taurus</b> during some part of each year. The galactic plane of the Milky Way intersects the northeast corner of the constellation and the galactic anticenter is located near the border between <b>Taurus</b> and Auriga. <b>Taurus</b> is the only constellation crossed by all three of the galactic equator, celestial equator, and ecliptic. A ring-like galactic structure known as Gould's Belt passes through the constellation.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{features}} exist {{that are of}} interest to astronomers. <b>Taurus</b> hosts two of the nearest open clusters to Earth, the Pleiades and the Hyades, {{both of which are}} visible to the naked eye. At first magnitude, the red giant Aldebaran is the brightest star in the constellation. In the northwest part of <b>Taurus</b> is the supernova remnant Messier 1, more commonly known as the Crab Nebula. One of the closest regions of active star formation, the Taurus-Auriga complex, crosses into {{the northern part of the}} constellation. The variable star T Tauri is the prototype of a class of pre-main-sequence stars.|$|E
5|$|Flexible-fuel {{vehicles}} {{were introduced in}} Sweden as a demonstration test in 1994, when three Ford <b>Taurus</b> were imported to show the technology existed. Because of the existing interest, a project was started in 1995 with 50 Ford <b>Taurus</b> E85 flexifuel {{in different parts of}} Sweden: Umeå, Örnsköldsvik, Härnösand, Stockholm, Karlstad, Linköping, and Växjö. From 1997 to 1998 an additional 300 <b>Taurus</b> were imported, and the number of E85 fueling grew to 40. Then in 1998 the city of Stockholm placed an order for 2,000 of FFVs for any car manufacturer willing to produce them. The objective was to jump-start the FFV industry in Sweden. The two domestic car makers Volvo Group and Saab AB refused to participate arguing there were not in place any ethanol filling stations. However, Ford Motor Company took the offer and began importing the flexifuel version of its Focus model, delivering the first cars in 2001, and selling more than 15,000 FFV Focus by 2005, then representing an 80% market share of the flexifuel market.|$|E
5|$|Gamma Aurigae, now Beta Tauri (El Nath, Alnath) is a B7III class star (B-type giant). It was {{originally}} {{considered to be}} a part of both Auriga and <b>Taurus,</b> but is now classified only as Beta Tauri.|$|E
5|$|Three {{subspecies}} of aurochs are formally recognised, {{with the}} Eurasian subspecies reaching Europe about 250,000 years ago, where it survived until the 17th century. Eurasian aurochs were also domesticated into cattle breeds of European form (Bos <b>taurus,</b> {{also known as}} Bos primigenius <b>taurus)</b> commencing about 8,000 {{years ago in a}} region known as the Fertile Crescent in the Near East. These cattle began to enter Europe during and after the Neolithic expansion.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} of peace, in 218BC, while Achaeus was {{involved}} in an expedition to Selge south of the <b>Taurus,</b> Attalus, with some Thracian Gauls, recaptured his former territories. However Achaeus returned from victory in Selge in 217BC and resumed hostilities with Attalus.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 2000, German IDS and ECR Tornados {{received}} the ASSTA 1 (Avionics System Software Tornado in Ada) upgrade. ASSTA 1 involved a replacement weapons computer, new GPS and Laser Inertial navigation systems. The new computer allowed {{the integration of}} the HARM III, HARM 0 Block IV/V and <b>TAURUS</b> KEPD 350 missiles, the Rafael Litening II Laser Designator Pod and GBU-24 Paveway III laser-guided bombs. The ASSTA 2 upgrade began in 2005, primarily consisting of several new digital avionics systems, a new ECM suite and provision for the <b>Taurus</b> cruise missile; these upgrades are to be only applied to 85 Tornados (20 ECRs and 65 IDSs), as the Tornado {{is in the process of}} being replaced by the Eurofighter Typhoon. The ASSTA 3 upgrade programme, started in 2008, will introduce support for the laser-targeted Joint Direct Attack Munition along with further software changes.|$|E
5|$|In the 9th century, {{a legend}} sprang {{up to the}} effect that an ancient column at the Forum of <b>Taurus</b> had an {{inscription}} predicting that Constantinople would be conquered by the Rus. This legend, well known in Byzantine literature, was revived by the Slavophiles in the 19th century, when Russia was on the point of wresting the city from the Ottomans.|$|E
5|$|The aphelion, or {{farthest}} {{point from}} the Sun, {{would be in}} the general direction of the constellation of <b>Taurus,</b> whereas the perihelion, the nearest point to the Sun, {{would be in the}} general direction of the southerly areas of Serpens (Caput), Ophiuchus, and Libra.|$|E
5|$|The panel {{features}} an enthroned sun, with the Zodiac signs dancing around it. The signs of Leo, Virgo, Cancer, Gemini, <b>Taurus</b> and Aries {{dance on the}} right, and Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces are dancing on the left.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its natural}} {{strategic}} {{position on a}} small peninsula into the Mediterranean Sea below the <b>Taurus</b> Mountains, Alanya has been a local stronghold for many Mediterranean-based empires, including the Ptolemaic, Seleucid, Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman Empires. Alanya's greatest political importance came in the Middle Ages, with the Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm {{under the rule of}} Alaeddin Kayqubad I, from whom the city derives its name. His building campaign resulted in many of the city's landmarks, such as the Kızıl Kule (Red Tower), Tersane (Shipyard), and Alanya Castle.|$|E
5|$|During the Shiba {{siblings}} second year, Mayumi is {{succeeded by}} , a timid and youthful looking girl. Azusa {{has an interest}} in magic engineering and suspects Tatsuya is <b>Taurus</b> Silver. She is able to use a unique magic named after her, Azusa Dream, to forcefully pacify people. Mari is succeeded by , an impulsive and good-natured girl. She is engaged to , an androgynous and timid boy, and loves him dearly. Azusa is voiced by Saki Ogasawara, Kanon is voiced by Saori Onishi, and Isori is voiced by Sōma Saitō.|$|E
5|$|F. Gary Gray won a Film Life Movie Award for Best Director at the 2004 American Black Film Festival. Clay Cullen, Michael Caines, Jean Paul Ruggiero and Mike Massa won {{an award}} for Best Specialty Stunt at the 2004 <b>Taurus</b> World Stunt Awards for the boat chase through the canals of Venice. The Italian Job was {{nominated}} for the 2003 Saturn Award for Best Action/Adventure/Thriller Film, but lost to Kill Bill. In April 2009, IGN named the film's Los Angeles chase sequence {{one of the top}} 10 car chases of the 21st Century.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decades}} since the Tornado's introduction, {{all of the}} Tornado {{operators}} have undertaken various upgrade and modification programmes to allow recently introduced weapons {{to be used by}} their squadrons. Amongst the new armaments that the Tornado has been adapted to deploy are the enhanced Paveway and Joint Direct Attack Munition bombs, and modern cruise missiles such as the <b>Taurus</b> and Storm Shadow missiles; these upgrades have increased the Tornado's capabilities and combat accuracy. Precision weapons such as cruise missiles have replaced older munitions such as cluster bombs.|$|E
5|$|Much of the Mendips is open {{calcareous}} grassland, {{supporting a}} wide variety of flowering plants and insects. Some parts are deciduous ancient woodland, and some have been used intensively for arable agriculture, particularly since World WarI. As the demand for arable land in Britain declined, some areas were returned to grassland, but the use of fertilisers and herbicides has reduced its biodiversity. Grazing by rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), sheep (Ovis aries) and cattle (Bos <b>taurus)</b> maintains the grassland habitat.|$|E
5|$|Practice {{and first}} round {{qualifying}} {{was held on}} Thursday, October 15, 1998; Bobby Labonte led pre-qualifying practice with a lap time of 46.722 seconds. Five Ford teams, those of drivers Chad Little, Jimmy Spencer, Rich Bickle, Dick Trickle and Billy Standridge, ran Thunderbird-bodied race cars, instead of the standard <b>Taurus</b> ran at most 1998 Winston Cup Series races, believing the Thunderbird to have an aerodynamic advantage at the restrictor plate racetracks. Randal Ritter's car failed to pass inspection due to extreme irregularities in its construction, and the team withdrew before practice began.|$|E
5|$|Supernova SN 1054 {{was another}} widely {{observed}} event, with Arab, Chinese, and Japanese astronomers recording the star's appearance in 1054 CE. It {{may also have}} been recorded by the Anasazi as a petroglyph. This explosion appeared in the constellation of <b>Taurus,</b> where it produced the Crab Nebula remnant. At its peak, the luminosity of SN 1054 may have been four times as bright as Venus, and it remained visible in daylight for 23 days and was visible in the night sky for 653 days.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantine force went on {{to invade}} Arzanene. Philippicus besieged Chlomaron, the chief city of the area. At this point, Jovius and Maruthas, two local leaders, {{defected}} to the Byzantines. They promised to help locate the ideal positions for building impregnable forts that would control the passage through the <b>Taurus</b> Mountains and Hakkâri, allowing the Byzantines to control the routes that connected Arzanene with Persarmenia and Lower Mesopotamia. Philippicus assigned Heraclius the Elder, noted at this point as his second-in-command (hypostrategos), to follow the guides to the strong points indicated.|$|E
5|$|The Prince George's County Sheriff's Office {{currently}} {{operates a}} fleet consisting primarily of sixth-generation Ford <b>Taurus</b> Police Interceptors, ninth generation Chevrolet Impalas and Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptors. It also operates the Ford Police Interceptor Utility, both the post-2013 and post-2016 variants. The PGSO's transportation unit uses specialized Chevrolet and Dodge vans, whereas the motorcycle unit uses Harley-Davidson Police Edition motorcycles. The PGSO {{also has a}} Freightliner FS-65 bus.|$|E
5|$|The Quyllurit'i festival {{takes place}} {{at the end of a}} period of a few months when the Pleiades constellation, or Seven Sisters, a 7-star cluster in the <b>Taurus</b> constellation, disappears and reappears in the skies of the Southern Hemisphere. Its time of {{disappearance}} was marked in Inca culture by a festival for Pariacaca, the god of water and torrential rains. It occurs near the date of qarwa mita (qarwa meaning when the corn leaves are yellow).|$|E
5|$|The group, now {{numbering}} approximately twenty people, left Constantinople {{in early}} May 1915. They crossed the Bosphorus {{to take the}} unfinished Baghdad Railway to Baghdad. The <b>Taurus</b> Mountains were crossed on horseback, using—as von Hentig reflected—the same route taken by Alexander the Great, Paul the Apostle, and Frederick I. The group crossed the Euphrates at high flood, finally reaching Baghdad {{towards the end of}} May.|$|E
5|$|The {{observation}} {{of a total}} solar eclipse of May 29, 1919, helped to confirm Einstein's theory of general relativity. By comparing the apparent distance between stars in the constellation <b>Taurus,</b> with and without the Sun between them, Arthur Eddington stated that the theoretical predictions about gravitational lenses were confirmed. The observation with the Sun between the stars was only possible during totality since the stars are then visible. Though Eddington's observations were near the experimental limits of accuracy at the time, work in the later half of the 20th century confirmed his results.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} common eland is Taurotragus oryx, composed of three words: tauros, tragos and oryx. Tauros is Greek for a bull or bullock, meaning {{the same as the}} Latin <b>taurus.</b> Tragos is Greek for a male goat, referring to the tuft of hair that grows in the eland's ear and its resemblance to a goat's beard. Oryx is Latin and Greek (generally orygos) for pickaxe, referring to the pointed horns of North African antelopes like the common eland and scimitar-horned oryx.|$|E
5|$|The tiger {{catshark}} is {{a sluggish}} predator of a {{diverse array of}} benthic organisms. Its diet is dominated by bony fishes and crustaceans, and also includes cephalopods, polychaete worms, smaller sharks, and scavenged fish offal. It has been observed at the spawning grounds of the chokka squid (Loligo vulgaris reynaudi), feeding on squid that have descended to the bottom to mate and deposit eggs. Documented predators of this species include the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus) and the ragged tooth shark (Carcharias <b>taurus).</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{valley is}} located on the southeastern edge of Mare Serenitatis along a ring of {{mountains}} formed between 3.8 and 3.9 billion years ago when a large object impacted the Moon, forming Mare Serenitatis and pushing rock outward and upward. Taurus–Littrow is located in the <b>Taurus</b> mountain range and south of Littrow crater, features after which the valley received its name. The valley's name, coined by the Apollo 17 crew, was eventually approved by the International Astronomical Union in 1973.|$|E
5|$|Tigranes, who was {{residing}} at Tigranocerta in {{the summer}} of 69, was not only astonished by the speed of Lucullus' rapid advance into Armenia but {{by the fact that he}} had even launched such an operation in the first place. Unable to reconcile with this reality for a certain period of time, he belatedly sent a general named Mithrobarzanes with 2,000 to 3,000 cavalrymen to slow down Lucullus' advance but his forces were cut to pieces and routed by the 1,600 cavalry led by Sextilius, one of the legates serving under Lucullus. Learning of Mithrobarzanes' defeat, Tigranes entrusted the defense of his namesake city to Mancaeus and left to recruit a fighting force in the <b>Taurus</b> Mountains. Nevertheless, Lucullus' legates were able to disrupt two separate detachments coming to the aid of Tigranes and even located and engaged the king's forces in a canyon in the <b>Taurus.</b> Lucullus, nevertheless, chose not to pursue Tigranes while he had an unimpeded path towards Tigranocerta; he advanced and began to lay siege to it.|$|E
5|$|To voice her {{disapproval of}} the banning and unbanning of the book, Gordimer {{published}} What Happened to Burger's Daughter or How South African Censorship Works, {{a book of}} essays written by her and others. It was published in Johannesburg in 1980 by <b>Taurus,</b> a small underground publishing house established in the late-1970s to print anti-apartheid literature and other material South African publishers would avoid for fear of censorship. Its publications were generally distributed privately or sent to bookshops {{to be given to}} customers free to avoid attracting the attention of the South African authorities.|$|E
5|$|Under {{a treaty}} of {{alliance}} with Attalus, Antiochus crossed the <b>Taurus</b> in 216BC, attacked Achaeus and besieged Sardis, and in 214BC, {{the second year of}} the siege, was able to take the city. However the citadel remained under Achaeus' control. Under the pretense of a rescue, Achaeus was finally captured and put to death, and the citadel surrendered. By 213BC, Antiochus had regained control of all of his Asiatic provinces.|$|E
5|$|Whether the bigeye and {{smalltooth}} sand tigers {{belong in}} the same family as the superficially similar sand tiger shark (C. <b>taurus)</b> has been debated among systematists, with morphological and dentitional studies giving inconsistent results. A 2012 molecular phylogenetic analysis, based on mitochondrial DNA, supported a sister species relationship between O. noronhai and O. ferox but not a clade consisting of Odontaspis and Carcharias. Instead, Odontaspis was found to be closer to the crocodile shark (Pseudocarcharias kamoharai), suggesting that it and Carcharias should be placed in separate families.|$|E
5|$|With no army left {{to defend}} Tigranocerta, and a foreign populace that gleefully opened the gates to the Romans, Lucullus' army began the {{wholesale}} looting and plunder of the city. The city was literally deconstructed piece by piece. The king's treasury, {{estimated to be}} worth 8,000 talents, was looted and each soldier in the army was awarded 800 drachma. The battle also resulted in severe territorial losses: most of the lands in Tigranes' empire {{to the south of}} the <b>Taurus</b> fell under the sway of Rome.|$|E
5|$|At this point, again {{according}} to his own account, he felt remorse and considered returning to Constantinople, where he would give the fortune he had amassed to the poor, but he was forestalled by the Bishop of Tyre and Sidon, who found him and delivered an offer by the Patriarch of Antioch to name him bishop of Taurezion (an unidentified location, suggested as being either in the <b>Taurus</b> Mountains or in the Tauric peninsula, i.e. the Crimea). Paul accepted, and was apparently consecrated by the Bishop of Tyre and Sidon (ca. 1375). At the same time, the Patriarch of Constantinople Philotheos I Kokkinos heard about his dealings in the east, and at Trebizond Paul was met by a messenger from the Patriarch who demanded his immediate return to Constantinople to stand trial.|$|E
5|$|Besides Pluto, Makemake is {{the only}} other dwarf planet that was bright enough that Clyde Tombaugh could have {{detected}} it during his search for trans-Neptunian planets around 1930. At the time of Tombaugh's survey, Makemake {{was only a few}} degrees from the ecliptic, near the border of <b>Taurus</b> and Auriga, at an apparent magnitude of 16.0. This position, however, was also very near the Milky Way, and Makemake would have been almost impossible to find against the dense background of stars. Tombaugh continued searching for some years after the discovery of Pluto, but he did not find Makemake or any other trans-Neptunian objects.|$|E
