5|$|Meg {{catches the}} mumps when the Griffins attend Quahog's annual Star Trek convention, because Peter forced her <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> an irresponsible {{attendee}} with mumps {{to take a}} picture, believing {{him to be in}} costume as an alien. While recovering in bed, Meg becomes a born-again Christian after watching Kirk Cameron on television and begins irritating everyone with her beliefs. Meg is horrified to learn that Brian is an atheist and attempts to convince him to repent and convert to Christianity, but he repeatedly refuses. Finally taking drastic measures, Meg spreads the word of Brian's atheism around Quahog, which generally hates atheists, making him a social outcast.|$|E
5|$|Elgar's statue {{at the end}} of Worcester High Street stands {{facing the}} cathedral, only yards from where his father's shop once stood. Another statue of the {{composer}} by Rose Garrard {{is at the top of}} Church Street in Malvern, overlooking the town and giving visitors an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the composer in the shadow of the Hills that he so often regarded. In September 2005, a third statue sculpted by Jemma Pearson was unveiled near Hereford Cathedral in honour of his many musical and other associations with the city. It depicts Elgar with his bicycle. From 1999 until early 2007, new Bank of England twenty pound notes featured a portrait of Elgar. The change to remove his image generated controversy, particularly because 2007 was the 150th anniversary of Elgar's birth. From 2007 the Elgar notes were phased out, ceasing to be legal tender on 30 June 2010.|$|E

500|$|The Royal Assent {{ceremony}} {{takes place}} in the Senate, as the sovereign is traditionally barred from the House of Commons. On the day of the event, the Speaker of the Senate will read to the chamber a notice from the secretary to the governor general indicating when the viceroy or a deputy thereof will arrive. The Senate thereafter cannot adjourn until after the ceremony. The speaker moves to sit beside the throne, the Mace Bearer, with mace in hand, stands adjacent to him or her, and the governor general enters to take the speaker's chair. The Usher of the Black Rod is then commanded by the speaker to summon the members of parliament, who follow Black Rod back to the Senate, the Sergeant-at-Arms carrying the mace of the House of Commons. In the Senate, those from the commons stand behind the bar, while Black Rod proceeds <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the governor general, who then nods his or her head to signify Royal Assent to the presented bills (which do not include appropriations bills). Once the list of bills is complete, the Clerk of the Senate states: [...] "in Her Majesty's name, His [...] Excellency the Governor General [...] doth assent to these bills." [...] If there are any appropriation bills to receive Royal Assent, the Speaker of the House of Commons will read their titles and the Senate clerk repeats them to the governor general, who nods his or her head to communicate Royal Assent. When these bills have all been assented to, the Clerk of the Senate recites [...] "in Her Majesty's name, His [...] Excellency the Governor General [...] thanks her loyal subjects, accepts their benevolence and assents to these bills." [...] The governor general or his or her deputy then depart parliament.|$|E

2500|$|The splendour of Byzantine art {{was always}} in the mind of early medieval Western artists and patrons, and many of the most {{important}} movements in the period were conscious attempts to produce art fit <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> both classical Roman and contemporary Byzantine art. This was especially the case for the imperial Carolingian art and Ottonian art. [...] Luxury products from the Empire were highly valued, and reached for example the royal Anglo-Saxon Sutton Hoo burial in Suffolk of the 620s, which contains several pieces of silver. Byzantine silks were especially valued and large quantities were distributed as diplomatic gifts from Constantinople. [...] There are records of Byzantine artists working in the West, especially during the period of iconoclasm, and some works, like the frescos at Castelseprio and miniatures in the Vienna Coronation Gospels, seem to have been produced by such figures.|$|E

In around 1987, Sui got the opportunity to move her line into Annette B, a showroom curated by Annette Breindel. Breindel, who had a history of nurturing young designers, was a major influence for Sui and helped the designer emerge onto the fashion scene. During this period, Sui finally was able to move her operation out of her apartment and into the garment district. By the late 1980s, Sui had gained a global cult-like following, getting the attention of Japanese fashion powerhouses such as Onward Kashiyama. Sui would go on to majorly expand Japanese operations in the mid 90s.|$|R

5000|$|The {{project was}} pushed forward by Charles Koppelman, the CEO of EMI Records Group North America. An {{orchestra}} was rehearsed at Capitol Records Studio A in Los Angeles, where Sinatra had recorded many times, the orchestra using classic Nelson Riddle arrangements. Sinatra {{showed up for}} the first two days of intended tracking sessions but begged off laying down any vocals, the first day because he did not like being isolated in a vocal booth as intended by recording engineer Al Schmitt. On the second day Ramone, Schmitt and the studio staff had arranged a small stage for Sinatra <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> on <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the orchestra, to make the recording session feel more like a live performance, but Sinatra said his voice was not in optimal condition. At this point, about $350,000 had been spent to put the project together, and Ramone was worried the record would never be completed. On the third day, June 30, 1993, Sinatra appeared looking sharp and confident in a suit and tie, and he proceeded to record nine songs in five hours, beginning with [...] "Come Fly With Me".|$|R
