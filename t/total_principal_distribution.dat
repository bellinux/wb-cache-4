40|$|Based on {{elasticity}} theory, we use numerical Galerkin {{finite element}} discretization method and implement Matlab finite element code to simulate “stress shadow” distributions of mutual orthogonal fractures. The principal stress and <b>principal</b> <b>distributions</b> have the symmetry characteristic on the intersection (coordinate origin). The relationships between stress shadow and flow pressure ratio, pore pressure, fluid pressure and horizontal stress contract are analyzed, respectively. By these techniques of variable displacement construction, changing the viscosity of the fracturing fluid, exploitation {{of oil and}} gas wells changing pump rate and fracturing fluid viscosity, reducing pore pressure and increasing the injection volume, taking the advantages of shadow effect, it is likely to produce a complex fracture network.

In the {{polarimeter}} developed, a reference {{beam of light}} consists of the two orthogonal linearly polarized components that interfere with their counterpart orthogonal components of an elliptically polarized signal beam of light. Two crossed interference patterns are formed over a MOS TV camera so that the significant parameters for determining a <b>principal</b> stress <b>distribution</b> can be recorded in a computer. The major advantage is that not only {{each of the two}} principal stresses but also the principal stress-difference can be independently determined, and no use of any optical component for polarization alignment makes it possible to follow a rapid change in stress distribution within the maximum frame rate 2066 s of the MOS TV camera. 1...|$|R
30|$|Maximum <b>principal</b> stress <b>distribution</b> is {{the most}} {{significant}} analysis as it is most likely to initiate crack propagation within the brittle cement and enamel [19]. Higher peak stress value is inversely proportional to bond strength [20]. In the present study, a higher maximum principal stress was obtained with the tensile loading mode, and the adhesive layer was prone to fracture as it had lower bond strength than the shear loading mode. In addition, loading at the short side in shear test showed higher bond strength compared with loading at the long side (Table  3). This finding is in agreement with Algera et al. [12]. The maximum <b>principal</b> stress <b>distribution</b> pattern seemed to be correlated with the weak link of the adhesive layer [20].|$|R
