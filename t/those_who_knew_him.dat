5|$|Pryce's death, and its horrific nature, {{were met}} with great grief from all <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> during his career, {{especially}} his wife Nella, his parents Jack and Gwyneth and the Shadow team. His body was buried at St Bartholomew's Church in Otford, near Sevenoaks, Kent, the same church where he and Nella were married two years earlier.|$|E
5|$|As {{required}} by Mexican federal law for property ownership in Coahuila y Tejas, Houston had been baptized into the Catholic {{faith in the}} Adolphus Sterne House in Nacogdoches prior to Texas independence. By 1854, when Houston told Reverend Samson he felt compelled to make a public profession of faith, perhaps {{on the floor of}} the United States Senate, Margaret and her family had spent 14 years influencing her husband's faith. Ultimately, he decided to make the profession among <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> best in Texas.|$|E
5|$|Oppenheimer's deft {{handling}} of the July conference impressed his colleagues; his insight and ability to handle even the most difficult people {{came as a surprise}} even to <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> well. In the wake of the conference, Oppenheimer saw that while they had {{come to grips with the}} physics, considerable work was still required on the engineering, chemistry, metallurgy and ordnance aspects of building an atomic bomb. He became convinced that bomb design would require an environment where people could freely discuss problems and thereby reduce wasteful duplication of effort. He reasoned that this could best be reconciled with security by creating a central laboratory in an isolated location.|$|E

5|$|Darling had {{a strong}} {{personality}} and an independent outlook. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> well thought him destined {{to be a leader}} in whatever he undertook. He shunned strong drink and tobacco and found it difficult to tolerate overindulgence in alcohol. Normally even-tempered, he did show displeasure at the heckling from the crowd at Lord's at his obstinate defensive effort {{in the face of an}} Australian batting collapse. He was a stickler for fair play, but his actions against the English batsman KS Ranjitsinhji would today be seen as gamesmanship. During the bowler's approach and after the bowler had looked at the field, the Australian fielders moved behind Ranjitsinhji's back. This worried the Indian prince when playing his leg glance and eventually saw him left out of the English team.|$|E
5|$|Federal {{prosecutors}} {{launched an}} investigation {{to determine if}} he had acted out of hatred for Obama. Writings by Ortega-Hernandez and testimonies from <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> revealed that he believed that he was Jesus, and that President Obama was the Antichrist and the devil. Ortega-Hernandez was {{not found to be}} affiliated with any extremist groups. In September 2013, Ortega-Hernandez pled guilty to two of the nineteen charges against him: one count of destruction of property and one count of discharging a firearm during a crime of violence. As part of his plea bargain, the remaining charges were dropped, including the charge of attempting to assassinate the President, which carried a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. On March 31, 2014, Ortega-Hernandez was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment by Judge Rosemary M. Collyer. His lawyers had asked for a 10-year sentence, stating Ortega-Hernandez was suffering from depression and stress. Prosecutors had asked for the maximum sentence of 27½ years. He is serving his sentence at United States Penitentiary, Beaumont, with a release date of October 24, 2033.|$|E

25|$|When {{he first}} arrived in Paris, he wrote home {{regularly}} to his mother, he sketched his nudes at the Académie Colarossi, and he drank wine in moderation.

He is noted to have commented, upon meeting Picasso who, at the time, was wearing his trademark workmen's clothes, that even though the man was a genius, that did not excuse his uncouth appearance.|$|E

25|$|Romero {{entered the}} local public school, which offered only grades one through three. When {{finished}} with public school, Romero was privately tutored by a teacher, Anita Iglesias, {{until the age}} of thirteen. During this time Óscar's father, Santos, trained Romero in carpentry. Romero showed exceptional proficiency as an apprentice. Santos wanted to offer his son the skill of a trade, because in El Salvador studies seldom led to employment. However, the boy broached the idea of studying for the priesthood, which did not surprise <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
25|$|In her 2007 work Jack L'Éventreur démasqué ('Jack the Ripper Unmasked'), Sophie Herfort {{proposed}} that Macnaghten himself had committed the Ripper murders. Basing {{her work on}} archival documents associated with case, including letters {{believed to have been}} sent by Jack the Ripper, as well as Mcnaghten's own memoirs and writings of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>him,</b> Herfort argued that Mcnaghten embarked upon the murders as a result of Charles Warren's opposition to his appointment at the Metropolitan Police and with the intention of driving Warren from his position as Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis. The Ripper murders would indeed cease following Warren's resignation, which directly facilitated Mcnaghten's appointment.|$|E
25|$|Mack {{lived through}} the entire era of racially {{segregated}} baseball (the {{early days of the}} game in his youth sometimes featured black players, but this ended by the 1890s and the major leagues remained white-only until Jackie Robinson broke down the color barrier in 1947), and even afterwards never displayed any serious interest in signing blacks. According to <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>him,</b> Mack was not a racist by the standards of his day and had no particular objection to a player's skin color. However, {{he did not want to}} cross the dictatorial commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis who represented the majority of MLB owners that opposed integrated baseball.|$|E

25|$|Guo Jia {{was from}} Yangzhai County (陽翟縣), Yingchuan Commandery (潁川郡), {{which is in}} present-day Yuzhou, Henan. As a youth, he was famous for his {{intelligence}} and foresight. Since reaching adulthood at around the age of 19, Guo Jia had been travelling {{around the country and}} befriending members of the scholar-gentry and other talented persons. He did not associate himself with the hoi polloi and was thus not very well known outside of his circles. However, all <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> recognised his talent and felt that he was extraordinary. When he was 26, he served in the Han government as a minor official {{in the office of the}} Minister over the Masses (司徒).|$|E
25|$|One {{friendship}} {{was made}} in these years that has been worth more than words can tell. I refer to that of Matthew McClung.

I had known him before at Lehigh in his undergraduate days, and had played on the same teams with him Never was there a squarer sportsman, or a fairer, more conscientious and efficient official; nor a truer, more gallant type of real man than he. His early death took out of the game a man of the kind we can ill afford to lose and no tribute that I could pay him would be high enough.|$|E
25|$|Of a {{firm and}} unselfish but abrupt and passionate disposition, Ashkenazi {{everywhere}} aroused the discontent and {{hatred of the}} rich and the scholarly. Extensive learning, keen intelligence, and exceptional linguistic attainments, all combined to make him one of the most distinguished men of his day. All his contemporaries, even <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> only {{as the head of the}} Klaus at Altona, unite in praising his profound learning, his astuteness, his clearness of exposition, which never degenerated into the subtleties of the pilpul, and his absolute disregard for the influence of money. He would suffer serious deprivation rather than accept pecuniary assistance; and this characteristic, interpreted by the wealthy of that day as obstinacy and arrogance, became to him a source of much suffering and enmity.|$|E

25|$|Shelley {{promoted}} Keats {{as someone}} whose achievement {{could not be}} separated from agony, who was 'spiritualised' by his decline and too fine-tuned to endure the harshness of life; the consumptive, suffering image popularly held today. The first full biography was published in 1848 by Richard Monckton Milnes. Landmark Keats biographers since include Sidney Colvin, Robert Gittings, Walter Jackson Bate and Andrew Motion. The idealised image of the heroic romantic poet who battled poverty and died young was inflated by the late arrival of an authoritative biography and the lack of an accurate likeness. Most of the surviving portraits of Keats were painted after his death, and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> held that they did not succeed in capturing his unique quality and intensity.|$|E
25|$|According to <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>him,</b> the war deeply {{depressed}} Dayan. He {{went into}} political eclipse for a time. In 1977, despite having been re-elected to the Knesset for the Alignment, {{he accepted the}} offer to become Foreign Minister in the new Likud government led by Menachem Begin. He was expelled from the Alignment, as a result and sat as an independent MK. As foreign minister in Begin's government, he was instrumental in drawing up the Camp David Accords, a peace agreement with Egypt. Dayan resigned his post in October 1979, because of a disagreement with Begin over whether the Palestinian territories were an internal Israeli matter (the Camp David treaty included provisions for future negotiations with the Palestinians; Begin, who {{did not like the}} idea, did not put Dayan in charge of the negotiating team). In 1981 he founded a new party, Telem.|$|E
25|$|The Elder Sampson had {{converted}} from Anglicanism to Orthodoxy {{at the age}} of 14. He received a degree in medicine and a theological education, and in 1918 he joined a monastic community near Petrograd. In the same year, he was arrested and taken to a mass execution where he survived by being wounded and covered up with the other bodies. He was rescued by fellow monks from the heap. He later became a priest. In 1929 he was arrested again and was released in 1934. He was arrested again in 1936 and sentenced to ten years in prison. He served these years as a prison doctor in Central Asia, and for this reason the authorities did not wish to release him due to the need for his service when his term came to an end in 1946. He escaped and wandered through the desert, while successfully avoiding capture. He went on to do pastoral work without any legal papers. He died in 1979, and was remembered as a saint by <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
