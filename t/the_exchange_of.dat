There are plenty of the itacistic faults, especially <b>the</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> ει for ι and αι for ε. <b>The</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> ει and ο for ω is less frequent.|$|E

This circumstance triggered the Japanese foreign ministry to proclaim that any ship delivering coal to Russian vessels within {{the war zone}} would be sunk. After the Russo-Japanese War, Germany insisted on reciprocity in <b>the</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> military officers and students, and in the following years, several German military officers were sent to Japan to study the Japanese military, which, after its victory over the tsarist army became a promising organization to study. However, Japan's growing power and influence also caused increased distrust on the German side.|$|E

5|$|Dinocephalosaurus {{represents}} {{the climax of}} aquatic adaptations among the protorosaurs. Given its long neck and paddle-like limbs, it was probably incapable of functioning comfortably in a terrestrial environment. One consequence of these adaptations is that Dinocephalosaurus would have been incapable of building nests on land. This would also have prevented it from possessing hard-shelled reptilian eggs; such eggs necessitate <b>the</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> gases with the outside environment, and this process is significantly slower in water {{than it is in}} air. Thus, Dinocephalosaurus could not have been oviparous. At the same time, however, archosaurs are known for the total absence of viviparous, or live birth, among its living members.|$|E

5|$|German–Partisan {{prisoner}} exchanges re-commenced in late 1943, {{but became}} {{the responsibility of}} the Partisan Chief Headquarters for Croatia rather than Partisan Supreme Headquarters. Initially these were organised by Stilinović, then by Dr. Josip Brnčić, before Boris Bakrač took over the role. Between March 1944 and May 1945, Bakrač attended about 40 meetings with German representatives, 25 of which were in Zagreb under agreements for safe conduct. On the German side, Ott continued to play a leading role. These negotiations resulted in <b>the</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> between 600 and 800 Partisans in total.|$|E

This is thought to be due to Haumea's weak 7:12 orbital resonance with Neptune gradually modifying its initial orbit {{over the course of a}} billion years, through the Kozai effect, which allows <b>the</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> an orbit's inclination for increased eccentricity.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> bill <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> {{is a kind}} {{of paper}} in order that its holder shall entitle the debtor named in the {{document}} to pay a certain amount of payments. <b>The</b> bill <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> represents a means of payment and an instrument of providing the payment. It is an unconditional order given by the drawer to the drawee to pay a certain amount to the payee listed on <b>the</b> bill <b>of</b> <b>exchange.</b> <b>The</b> bill <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> is generally a paper on the orders but it can be issued as value paper to a name. It is such promissory notes where the issuer becomes a clause not by order. <b>The</b> bill <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> though it appears as a means of payment and an instrument for securing the payment it also appears as a means of international payment, because <b>the</b> bill <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> can become a modern instrument of crediting and payment.

This means that instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bill <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> to be paid after the expiry of a certain deadline for submission <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bill <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>the</b> holder may sell or discount, or to pay before the deadline for submission.
