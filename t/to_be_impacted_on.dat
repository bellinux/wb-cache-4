40|$|The {{well-being}} of tourists or visitors within a destination has, until recently, received little attention. Issues {{relating to the}} personal safety and health of the travelling public have been highlighted {{by a number of}} high profile incidents of terrorist attacks, large scale natural disasters and life threatening epidemics. While such events are devastating in nature and of great concern, for the majority of travellers, health and personal safety are more likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>impacted</b> <b>on</b> by illness, being involved in an accident or becoming the victim of crime. This thesis contributes to our existing understanding of how tourism can be affected by incidents by selecting a definable geographical area and investigating the available data from official sources to examine the dimensions, scale and nature of visitor-related incidents of crime, road traffic accidents and emergency health care. This audit was undertaken through collaborative research with the Central Scotland Police Force, the Central Scotland Road Accident Investigation Unit and the National Health Service Forth Valley. Primary research was then undertaken with visitors to the area. This in-depth approach looks beyond existing statistics to probe factors contributing to visitor-related incidents, in relation to existing tourism literature. The results indicate that, visitors experience incidents that differ in nature and type from those experienced by local residents, and the times and places they were most at risk also varied.

40|$|The overall {{research}} {{aim was to}} examine the cognitive development of Irish and English speaking developing bilingual children. Caveats from previous research indicated the importance of considering language factors such as acquisition, proficiency and use, which informed a further {{research aim}} of conducting a comprehensive examination of language background information for immersion educated children, through multiple sources. Working memory and executive control were of particular research interest as prior international " research with developing bilingual children produced mixed findings for both working memory and executive control, with a link between these processes suggested <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>impacted</b> <b>on</b> by the bilingual experience (Bialystok, 2009), The first study examined whether any evidence supported an examination of working memory in the developing bilinguals, given Bialystok's (2009) suggestion of equivalent working memory performance in bilingual and monolingual children and adults. As findings indicated differences in the structure and development of working memory as compared with data from Alloway, Gathercole and Pickering (2006), further investigation into language factors impacting on developing bilinguals' language experience, were conducted to provide a context within which to consider findings. Language information was used to consider subsequent findings of research examining short term memory, working memory, receptive vocabulary, non-verbal lQ and executive control in developing bilingual and monolingual children. Findings overall indicated largely equivalent cognitive and linguistic performance of bilingual and monolingual children which must be considered in light of developing bilinguals' early acquisition and additive bilingualism. Notable cognitive differences between developing bilingual and monolingual children were found and replicated on a mazes memory task of visuospatial working memory.

40|$|Forgiveness is {{a concept}} which is gaining {{recognition}} in psychology, particularly due to the positive correlation between forgiveness and individual 2 ̆ 7 s {{physical and mental health}} (Enright, Rique 2 ̆ 6 Coyle, 2000). Findings in a study by Allan, Allan, Kuminer, and Stein (2006), focusing on human rights violations, led to the hypothesis that people who are directly affected by an offence (primary victims), may find it easier to forgive an offender than individuals who have a family member violated, so called secondary victims. The current study, comprised of two stages, was undertaken to explore this hypothesis by identifying and comparing factors which impact on the development of forgiveness in primary and secondary victims of violent and sexual offences. Stage One of the current study consisted of 21 community members who had either been directly or in-directly affected by a violent or sexual offence. Due to the focus on the participant 2 ̆ 7 s experiences relating to forgiveness, an empirical phenomenological approach was used. The participants, recruited through n variety of methods, took part in a semi-structured interview and completed the Enright Forgiveness Inventory (EFI, Enright, Rique, 2 ̆ 6 Coyle, 2000). The findings of the Stage One indicated {{that the majority of the}} primary victims identified as having forgiven the offender, in contrast to the majority of secondary victims stating that they had not forgiven the offender. Through content analysis of the interview data, three main themes common to the two groups were identified, namely, internal factors, factors relating to the offender and factors relating to the offence. Additionally, secondary victims appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>impacted</b> <b>on</b> by the process of primary victims. While the main themes identified by the two groups were similar, the primary md secondary victims had distinct approaches to forgiveness. Specifically, the primary victims appeared to have a self-focus, with little reliance on external influences on forgiveness. In contrast, the secondary victims appeared to have an external focus, thereby making forgiveness more difficult to achieve. Based on the differences identified through Stage One, Stage Two of the current study explored seven main areas, predominantly relating to the ways in which the participants conceptualised forgiveness. A convenience sample of 60 primary and secondary victims were invited to complete a survey either by email, mail, telephone or face-to-face. Consistent with Stage One, the results from Stage Two indicated that primary victims were significantly more likely to develop forgiveness toward the offender. Furthermore, they had a more positive view of forgiveness, viewing it as being of benefit to their own well-being and recovery. In contrast, secondary victims were significantly more likely to indicate that they had not forgiven the offender. They generally viewed forgiveness as having no benefit to any individual involved and as having no impact on their own or the primary victim 2 ̆ 7 s recovery process. Furthermore, the secondary victims expressed the view that they were not entitled to forgive the offender for their actions toward the primary victim, and that forgiving the offender would be a betrayal of the primary victim. The practical implications of this difference is discussed, particularly in relation to the different approach which may be needed in interventions aimed at increasing forgiveness in these two groups...|$|E

40|$|Neonicotinoids are now {{the most}} widely used {{insecticides}} in the world. They act systemically, travelling through plant tissues and protecting all parts of the crop, and are widely applied as seed dressings. As neurotoxins with high toxicity to most arthropods, they provide effective pest control and have numerous uses in arable farming and horticulture. However, the prophylactic use of broad-spectrum pesticides goes against the long-established principles of integrated pest management (IPM), leading to environmental concerns. It has recently emerged that neonicotinoids can persist and accumulate in soils. They are water soluble and prone to leaching into waterways. Being systemic, they are found in nectar and pollen of treated crops. Reported levels in soils, waterways, field margin plants and floral resources overlap substantially with concentrations that <b>are</b> sufficient <b>to</b> control pests in crops, and commonly exceed the LC 50 (the concentration which kills 50 % of individuals) for beneficial organisms. Concentrations in nectar and pollen in crops <b>are</b> sufficient <b>to</b> <b>impact</b> substantially <b>on</b> colony reproduction in bumblebees. Although vertebrates are less susceptible than arthropods, consumption of small numbers of dressed seeds offers a route to direct mortality in birds and mammals. Synthesis and applications.

During the summer of 1999 / 2000, Lincoln University researchers assessed the potential for eradication of hedgehogs from the island. Bait trials suggested that hedgehogs were readily live-trapped, that meat baits were more effective than eggs or cereal baits as lures, and that hedgehogs are present in all major habitat types on the island. A review of past studies suggested that a trap spacing of 150 m should be suitable for hedgehog trapping.

Preliminary trapping with a grid of 53 live-traps over 11 nights resulted in the capture of 24 hedgehogs and 2 rats, with a time investment of 3. 1 person hours per hedgehog captured. Catch rates did not decline significantly during the trial, which implies that a substantial population of hedgehogs remains on the island.

Increased job insecurity <b>is</b> presumed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>impacting</b> <b>on</b> home ownership aspirations and sustainabilty across all income groups but is largely untested. While Australia {{has one of the}} highest casual employment rates among developed countries, SA stands out within the nation as being the most precarious labour market. SA experienced a net loss of 20, 000 full time jobs in the decade 1990 to 2000 with part time and casual employment the main job growth area. Australia’s welfare and housing polices have been predicated for fifty years on the perceived merits of home ownership. Welfare benefits both during employment and on retirement have been based on household investment being extended over time through home ownership. Thus any significant change in purchaser behaviour particularly in the cohort who would traditionally have entered home ownership as early as possible, merits review. The main research instrument was a postal survey of first time homebuyers who made their purchase during the period 1 st January 1999 to 31 st December 2000. The study area included the Adelaide metropolitan area and the rural townships of Mount Gambier, Murray Bridge and Port Lincoln.

The aim <b>is</b> <b>to</b> both stimulate discussions and encourage further thinking - in a field where globalisation and cross-cultural interactions appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>impacting</b> <b>on</b> how brands <b>are</b> defined, perceived and consumed. Design/methodology/approach: Inductive reasoning and syllogisms, as a basis for conceptual metaphor theory and critical discourse analysis. Evidence gathered from structured and systematic literature reviews - supported by anecdotal evidence; personal observations and experience; and existing empirical data. Research limitations/implications: As this is a conceptual paper, it is limited at times by reviewing existing empirical data and having to draw {{from a wide range of}} cross-disciplinary sources. Practical implications: It is suggested that further empirical research in this field is required; in order to fill gaps in understanding, consolidate existing thinking, and devise additional theoretical frameworks. This would prove of benefit to both academics and practitioners alike. Originality/value: A new perspective is being proposed as to how a brand’s value, its personality and resonance amongst consumers can be evaluated. From this, a new dimension <b>is</b> being added <b>to</b> the way in which brand value is perceived and subsequently communicated. Furthermore, it is felt that brand value calculations should be reflective of the more figurative and symbolic effects possessed by the brands themselves, which gift them unique and vertical success factors.
