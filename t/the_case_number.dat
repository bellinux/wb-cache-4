2500|$|On May 1, 2009, Picard filed {{a lawsuit}} against Stanley Chais, 82. The {{complaint}} alleges he [...] "knew or should have known" [...] he was deep in a Ponzi scheme when his family investments with Madoff averaged 40% and sometimes soared as high as 300%. It also claims Chais was a primary beneficiary of the scheme for at least 30 years, allowing his family to withdraw more than $1 billion from their accounts since 1995 – money that belonged to Madoff victims. <b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>number</b> is Picard v.

2500|$|... against J. Ezra Merkin, {{seeking to}} recover almost $500 million {{withdrawn}} from Madoff accounts {{in the last}} six years. The complaint alleges that since 1995, Merkin steered more than $1 billion to Madoff through three private hedge funds, Ascot Partners, Ariel Fund, and Gabriel Capital. Since 2002, the funds withdrew at least $494 million from [...] Madoff — returns that Merkin “knew or should have known” were fraudulent. There were at least 500 instances {{in the last ten years}} when his Madoff account statements showed large blocks of stock bought or sold at prices that did not match the stock’s trading range for the day when the transactions supposedly occurred. <b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>number</b> is 08-01789 (BRL): IRVING H.

The government's submission stated that Lam erred in finding that foreign domestic helpers' residence in Hong Kong {{could not be}} regarded as [...] "out of the ordinary", in finding that {{the government}}'s right to apply immigration control under Basic Law Article 154 could not be applied to Vallejos, and in failing to consider extrinsic materials from both prior to and subsequent to {{the publication of the}} Basic Law in 1990. High Court Chief Judge Andrew Cheung and High Court vice-presidents Robert Tang and Frank Stock heard the government's appeal on 2123 February 2012. David Pannick continued to represent the government. In {{the first day of the}} hearing, Pannick argued that [...] "there is no undermining of the rule of law if the legislature enjoys a certain margin of discretion". Pannick also pointed to the previous British administration's treatment of Vietnamese refugees in Hong Kong in the 1980s as a precedent. He further brought up examples from UK law, such as the fact that time spent there on a student visa was not regarded as [...] "ordinary residence" [...] and did not count towards the time required to obtain indefinite leave to remain.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} least squares estimation of the parameters of two–dimensional (2 -D) exponential signals observed {{in the presence of}} an additive noise field, when the assumed number of exponentials is incorrect. We consider both <b>the</b> <b>case</b> where <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of exponential signals is underestimated, and <b>the</b> <b>case</b> where <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of exponential signals is overestimated. In <b>the</b> <b>case</b> where <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of exponential signals is underestimated, we prove the almost sure convergence of the least squares estimates (LSE) to the parameters of the dominant exponentials. In <b>the</b> <b>case</b> where <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of exponential signals is overestimated, the estimated parameter vector obtained by the least squares estimator contains a subvector that converges almost surely to the correct parameters of the exponentials.

40|$|In {{different}} countries, even in Germany, {{for a lot}} {{of operations}} minimum quantities have been established in the last years. In august 2005 the GBA introduced a minimum quantity of 50 per hospital per year for the Implantation of knee-endoprotheses. In the literature you can find a growing consensus that minimum quantities improve the quality of surgical interventions and reduce the number of complications. In most of these publications only individual complications (such as motility, infections und mortality) are observed and there were only hospitals with different <b>case</b> <b>numbers</b> compared with each other. Many of these publications used records of an external quality assurance, who are subject to certain limitations. Therefore it seems useful, additional to <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>numbers</b> per year, to determine as many influencing factors as possible and set their impact strength against those of <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>numbers.</b> In addition, this work has tried to investigate, whether a changing caseload within a single hospital influences the number of complications. To realize this, retrospective data from primary knee-endoprothetic implantations over a period of nine consecutive years from the Park-Klinik Weissensee have been collected. An attempt was made to determine as many potentially relevant risk factors and operation-specific complications from this data as possible. Subsequently, different statistical methods were used (Chi-square-test, Mann-Whitney-U-test, Fisher’s exact test, logistic regression) to filter out relevant influencing factors and to test them for influence on individual complications and the overall complication rate. As a result, for many of the occurred complications individual factors could be isolated, which showed significant distribution differences. With the logistic regression cold be proved, that <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of <b>cases</b> per year {{is only one of many}} factors, which influence the surgical results and therefore in <b>case</b> of evaluating <b>the</b> influence of <b>case</b> <b>numbers</b> on <b>the</b> complication rate other factors must be taken into account...|$|R
