5|$|Jones had {{previously}} developed a gruesome game called Go <b>to</b> <b>Hell.</b> <b>In</b> an interview Jones {{stated that he}} developed the game for his own amusement; he enjoyed the reactions people gave to the game. The original, pre-release, version of the game featured more grisly images. Reviewers praised the game's graphics but had mixed feeling about the scenes actually depicted by the graphics. Some reviewers criticized the game's gameplay as repetitive but praised as being fun and akin to a horror movie by others.|$|E
5|$|The {{facility}} has been invaded by demons {{after one of}} UAC's scientists, Olivia Pierce, made a pact with them and opened a portal <b>to</b> <b>Hell.</b> <b>In</b> desperation, Samuel Hayden releases the Doom Slayer from his sarcophagus to repel the demonic invasion and close the portal. The Doom Slayer recovers his Praetor Suit and fights {{his way through the}} overrun facility, making several excursions into Hell along the way. He recovers a magical blade, the Crucible, which he uses to destroy the portal's power source. Finally, he comes across Pierce, who transforms into the monstrous Spider Mastermind, and kills her.|$|E
5|$|Jason {{made his}} comic book {{debut in the}} 1993 {{adaptation}} of Jason Goes to Hell, written by Andy Mangels. The three-issue series was a condensed version of the film, with a few added scenes that were never shot. Jason made his first appearance outside of the direct adaptations in Satan's Six No. 4, published in 1993, which {{is a continuation of}} the events of Jason Goes <b>to</b> <b>Hell.</b> <b>In</b> 1995, Nancy A. Collins wrote a three-issue, non-canonical miniseries involving a crossover between Jason and Leatherface. The story involves Jason stowing away aboard a train, after being released from Crystal Lake when the area is drained due to heavy toxic waste dumping. Jason meets Leatherface, who adopts him into his family after the two become friends. Eventually they turn on each other. In 1994 four young adult novels were released under the title of Friday the 13th. They did not feature Jason explicitly, but revolve around people becoming possessed by Jason when they put on his mask.|$|E

The man is shown scenes of himself leering at women, telling dirty jokes, not listening to the pastor's message and committing other sins.

Brian was made a member of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s European Division. Years later, Pete Wisdom learned about this and sarcastically remarked he was proud that Brian was acting like him.|$|E

500|$|Friction {{with the}} provincial {{government}} rose notably when, in October 1771, Allen and a company of Boys drove off a group of Scottish settlers near Rupert. Allen detained two of the settlers and forced them to watch the torching of their newly constructed cabins. He then ordered them to leave, saying, [...] "Go your way now, and complain to that damned scoundrel your Governor, God damn your Governor, Laws, King, Council, and Assembly". [...] When the settlers protested his language Allen continued the tirade, threatening to send any troops from New York <b>to</b> <b>Hell.</b> <b>In</b> response, New York's governor, William Tryon, issued warrants for the arrests of those responsible, and eventually put a price of £20 on the heads of six participants, including Allen. Allen and his comrades countered by issuing offers of their own.|$|E

500|$|In 1198 Osbert married Margaret of Rye, {{with whom}} he had at least one son. Osbert paid the king 20 pounds for the right to marry Margaret. Osbert died in 1206, without having made a will. At his death, his yearly income was more than 240 pounds. Ralph of Coggeshall {{mentions}} Osbert, without using his name, as a royal judge who would go <b>to</b> <b>Hell</b> <b>in</b> his [...] "Vision of Thurkill". This work detailed the punishments that awaited sinners, and Osbert was accused of accepting gifts from both sides of lawsuits. Coggeshall did state that Osbert was [...] "most expert in worldly law" [...] and was famous for [...] "his overflowing eloquence and experience in the law". According to Coggeshall, Osbert's punishment in Hell would consist of having to swallow hot coins and then being forced to vomit the coins back up. After his death, William of Huntingfield offered King John a fine for the right to the custody of Osbert's heir and lands, the fine amounting to 200 marks and two palfreys.|$|E
500|$|The {{meaning of}} these figures {{has never been}} clear. They are {{certainly}} {{in keeping with the}} Humanist acceptance of the classical Greek view that [...] "the man is the measure of all things". But Michelangelo knew the Bible well. He would have been well {{aware of the fact that}} although seraphim and cherubim are described as being winged creatures, they are described as looking like men. When Michelangelo later painted the altar wall of the chapel, he included a great number of angels, particularly in the lunettes which are decorated with scenes of angels carrying the symbols of the Passion. Other angels are employed sounding the trumpets which call forth the dead, displaying books in which the names of the saved and the damned are written and casting sinners down <b>to</b> <b>Hell.</b> <b>In</b> all, the Last Judgement contains more than forty angels, all closely resembling the Ignudi. It is reasonable to conclude that the Ignudi represent angels. [...] If the Ignudi are indeed angels, they are the ever-present attendants and messengers of God, impassively watching and waiting on the fate of Humankind.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Hell's Where the Heart Is", an Oni {{girl named}} Rajyaki is sent {{by her father}} Enma to seal the treasures of the Seven Gods of Fortune. On her journey, a womanizing ex-monk called Seikichi accidentally proposes {{to her and she}} accepts him as her husband. In the end, Seikichi saves her after a grueling battle by feeding her the sacred peach of Fukurokuju. Due to this, she is banished from Yomi by her father. In one ending, the Seven Gods of Fortune persuade Rajyaki to return to her father, while Seikichi moves to live a proper life. In the end, Rajyaki returns in human form and formalizes their marriage, which {{continues}} after Seikichi dies and goes <b>to</b> <b>Hell.</b> <b>In</b> the alternate ending, Rajyaki and Seikichi run into each other again when she is being hunted by samurai. Seikichi saves her, pretending he killed her and using that to establish himself as a samurai. Rajyaki takes the guise of his human wife, and they have three daughters who bear their mother's demonic horns. The Genroku Legends conclude with the narrator detailing the locations of the Seven Gods' treasures scattered through the stories, and thanking the player for locating them and calming Enma so his demons could return to Hell.|$|E

500|$|Pemberton and Shearsmith are fans {{of classic}} horror films, and the episode {{displays}} {{inspiration from the}} likes of Alfred Hitchcock's filmography and the Hammer Horror films. Pemberton called the episode the [...] "most genre" [...] of the series, while Shearsmith described it as their attempt to produce a [...] "full on ... gothic horror-esque" [...] episode. The writers utilised the horror norm of a gothic mansion rather than bringing horror into a normal home. This route, Shearsmith suggested, has now become atypical. The setting allowed the writers to mix modern elements with traditional gothic horror, sometimes for comedic effect (a reference to [...] "something called broadbands"), and sometimes to add to the horror (mobile phones cannot be used, as the characters are in a [...] "dead zone"). While the writers did want the episode grounded in reality, they also wanted to make more use of gothic horror tropes than they had in other episodes of Inside No. 9. [...] "The Harrowing" [...] was advertised with a poster homage to classic horror films. The poster was designed by Graham Humphreys, a graphic designer known for his work on horror film posters. The episode's name was taken from the Harrowing of Hell, the story of Jesus Christ's descent <b>to</b> <b>Hell</b> <b>in</b> Christian theology.|$|E
500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. When asked about how he performed his comeback, di Grassi {{said he did not}} know but praised his mechanics for their work. He stated that the race showed that Formula E could switch to [...] "Heaven <b>to</b> <b>Hell</b> <b>in</b> one go", and felt if the third safety car period had not intervened, he could have managed his advantage over Vergne. He also revealed that on three occasions during the race, he believed that the possibility of him securing the victory had ended. Vergne, who finished in second, had mixed emotions, feeling that the victory was in his grasp but was happy that he secured a place on the podium and was in contention for the championship: [...] "We started very far away but I know I’m in the right team with the right car to win the championship. I think we’re coming back a little bit better and we’re getting stronger every race as a team." [...] Third-place finisher Bird said that it was [...] "a good race" [...] for everyone who watched the event on television and the sport. He felt the action observed in the race was positive for the series. Bird also said he was happy with the passing manoeuvre he performed on d'Ambrosio and reserved praise for his team.|$|E
500|$|Visual {{effects were}} done by Rocket Science VFX and Mr. X Inc. Paul Jones {{served as the}} special effects creator, who {{previously}} designed the Nemesis character in Resident Evil: Apocalypse. The production team planned to use extras to portray 300 zombies at once, but time restraints prevented that. Around 150 zombies were eventually used and Mr. X Inc's visual effects supervisor, Dennis Berardi, added more in post-production. For Alice's clones they shot motion control photography for multiple passes of Jovovich. For the wide shots they took digital photo doubles. Visual effects production manager Eric Robertson described {{the look of the}} film, [...] "interesting contrasts, pure whites, which is a staggering look. It's so clean and tight along with some real darkness too that may evoke a bit of a feel of Silent Hill. So we've got the extremes, but it's definitely a unique look for this incarnation and it's been fun to see those looks." [...] A burned cityscape with ash and smoke in the sky was created to depict a postapocalyptic Los Angeles, in which most of the film is set. Bolt described this approach as, [...] "In a world that has gone <b>to</b> <b>hell</b> <b>in</b> a handbasket, there's no control and no fire service, so clearly, what's going to happen to LA is it's going to get burned." ...|$|E

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of [...] "The Exciting Middle Part", while Eliminators destroy Yugopotamia, Timmy is in Fairy World in front of fairy game geeks. He plays The Chosen One Video Game, which utilizes a white wand guitar controller that imitates the actual white wand, like a Guitar Hero controller that imitates a real guitar. When Mark's space pod plunges into the Earth and destroys an Eliminator disguised as Mark, the Eliminator's feet curl up in a way reminiscent of the Wicked Witch of the East from the Wizard of Oz. At {{the site of the}} Abracatraz Prison where the kidnapped fairies are held hostage, its front gate contains an inscription that reads [...] "Abandon all hope, ye who here enter", which when translated into Italian reads [...] "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate", the phrase used at the entrance gate <b>to</b> <b>Hell</b> <b>in</b> the Inferno chapter of Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy. In order to get Dark Laser to come to Earth so Timmy, along with Mr. Crocker and Vicky, can board on his Death Ball and blast off into space, Timmy posts a video that ridicules him onto a video-sharing website called [...] "TooYube", whose name and logo {{are similar to those of}} YouTube. Before heading to the Blue Moon, Turbo Thunder flies Timmy and Mark from Fridgidarium to another planet, Thunder World.
