50|$|The Shelon (Шелонь) is a {{river in}} the {{northwest}} part of European Russia, in Dedovichsky, Porkhovsky, and Dnovsky Districts of Pskov Oblast and Soletsky and Shimsky Districts of Novgorod Oblast. The Shelon {{is one of the}} principal tributaries of Lake Ilmen. It has a length of 248 km and drains a basin of 9710 km2. The towns of Porkhov and Soltsy, as well as urban-type settlements of Dedovichi and Shimsk, are located {{on the banks of the}} Shelon River. The principal tributaries of the Shelon are <b>the</b> Sudoma (<b>left),</b> <b>the</b> Belka (right), the Polonka (right), <b>the</b> Uza (<b>left),</b> <b>the</b> Udokha (<b>left),</b> <b>the</b> Sitnya (<b>left),</b> and <b>the</b> Mshaga (<b>left).</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{cerebrum}} has a contralateral organisation {{with each}} hemisphere {{of the brain}} interacting primarily with {{one half of the}} body: <b>the</b> <b>left</b> side of the brain interacts with {{the right side of the}} body, and vice versa. The developmental cause for this is uncertain. Motor connections from the brain to the spinal cord, and sensory connections from the spinal cord to the brain, both cross sides in the brainstem. Visual input follows a more complex rule: the optic nerves from the two eyes come together at a point called the optic chiasm, and half of the fibres from each nerve split off to join the other. The result is that connections from <b>the</b> <b>left</b> half of the retina, in both eyes, go to <b>the</b> <b>left</b> side of the brain, whereas connections from the right half of the retina go to the right side of the brain. Because each half of the retina receives light coming from the opposite half of the visual field, the functional consequence is that visual input from <b>the</b> <b>left</b> side of the world goes to the right side of the brain, and vice versa. Thus, the right side of the brain receives somatosensory input from <b>the</b> <b>left</b> side of the body, and visual input from <b>the</b> <b>left</b> side of the visual field.|$|E
5|$|The {{coronary}} sinus {{is a large}} vein that drains {{into the}} right atrium, and receives most of the venous drainage of the heart. It receives blood from the great cardiac vein (receiving <b>the</b> <b>left</b> atrium and both ventricles), the posterior cardiac vein (draining the back of <b>the</b> <b>left</b> ventricle), the middle cardiac vein (draining the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>left</b> and right ventricles), and small cardiac veins. The anterior cardiac veins drain {{the front of the}} right ventricle and drain directly into the right atrium.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>left</b> {{and right}} {{sides of the}} brain appear symmetrical, but they {{function}} asymmetrically. For example, the counterpart of the left-hemisphere motor area controlling the right hand is the right-hemisphere area controlling <b>the</b> <b>left</b> hand. There are, however, several important exceptions, involving language and spatial cognition. <b>The</b> <b>left</b> frontal lobe is dominant for language. If a key language area in <b>the</b> <b>left</b> hemisphere is damaged, it can leave the victim unable to speak or understand, whereas equivalent damage to the right hemisphere would cause only minor impairment to language skills.|$|E
