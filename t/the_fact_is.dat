5|$|Intentionality is the {{capacity}} of mental states to be directed towards (about) or be in relation with something in the external world. This property of mental states entails that they have contents and semantic referents and can therefore be assigned truth values. When one tries to reduce these states to natural processes there arises a problem: natural processes are not true or false, they simply happen. It would not {{make any sense to}} say that a natural process is true or false. But mental ideas or judgments are true or false, so how then can mental states (ideas or judgments) be natural processes? The possibility of assigning semantic value to ideas must mean that such ideas are about facts. Thus, for example, the idea that Herodotus was a historian refers to Herodotus and {{to the fact that he}} was a historian. If <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> true, then the idea is true; otherwise, it is false. But where does this relation come from? In the brain, there are only electrochemical processes and these seem not to have anything to do with Herodotus.|$|E

25|$|To this remark, the Buddha {{tells them}} that the Brahmins have indeed {{forgotten}} about their past if they said such things. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> that {{the women in the}} Brahmin caste can get pregnant, give birth, and take care of their children. But the Brahmins still say that they are born from the Mouth of the God Brahma and other (castes) are born from Brahma's feet. Thus, the Brahmin's words are untrue. The Buddha said that the Brahmins are not speaking truthfully and they will reap a bad result from their own deeds.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} change of command directly affecting the forts {{took place on}} October 17, 1861, when Brigadier General Thomas F.

Drayton, {{who was a member of}} a prominent Charleston family and a graduate of the United States Military Academy, remained in command through the actions of November 7.

25|$|A {{culmination}} {{of use of}} official resources for private gain may lead to further pressures on incoming officials from other kinsmen. However, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> the importation of modern rules on inter-ethnic political relationships is a recent colonial and western initiative that may take time to become the norm, deep allegiance to other ethnic groups for administrative decisions early on was sometimes viewed suspiciously, and an early institutionalization of a unitary system in the country, may also {{have led to a}} further familiar groupings induced corruption. Nevertheless, a modern practical approach to leadership and relationships has gradually taken a prominent role in the political process. The necessity for practical inter-depedence and cooperation is at the forefront of yearnings for good governance in the country.|$|E

25|$|The first British {{synchronizer}} gear {{was built}} by the manufacturer of the machine-gun {{for which it was}} designed: it went into production in December 1915. George Challenger, the designer, was at the time an engineer at Vickers'. In principle it closely resembled the first form of the Fokker gear, although this was not because it was a copy (as is sometimes reported): it was not until April 1916 that a captured Fokker was available for technical analysis. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> that both gears were based closely on the Saulnier patent. The first version was driven by a reduction gear attached to a rotary engine oil pump spindle, as in Saulnier's design; a small impulse-generating cam was mounted externally, on the port side of the forward fuselage, where it was readily accessible for adjustment.|$|E

25|$|In February 2012, Italian Marines {{based on}} the tanker Enrica Lexie {{allegedly}} fired on an Indian fishing trawler off Kerala, killing two of her eleven crew. The Marines allegedly mistook the fishing vessel as a pirate vessel. The incident sparked a diplomatic row between India and Italy. Enrica Lexie was ordered into Kochi where her crew were questioned by officers of the Indian Police. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> still sub juris and its legal eventual outcome could influence future deployment of VPDs, since states will be either encouraged or discouraged to provide them depending on whether functional immunity is ultimately granted or denied to the Italians.Another similar incident {{has been reported to}} have happened in the Red Sea between the coasts of Somalia and Yemen, involving the death of a Yemeni fisherman allegedly {{at the hands of a}} Russian Vessel Protection Detachment (VPD) on board a Norwegian-flagged vessel.|$|E
25|$|Arrow's death-of-a-candidate example (1963, page 26) {{suggests}} that the agenda (the set of feasible alternatives) shrinks from, say, X = {a, b, c} to S = {a, b} because {{of the death of}} candidate c. This example is misleading since it can give the reader an impression that IIA is a condition involving two agenda and one profile. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> that IIA involves just one agendum ({x, y} in case of pairwise independence) but two profiles. If the condition is applied to this confusing example, it requires this: Suppose an aggregation rule satisfying IIA chooses b from the agenda {a, b} when the profile is given by (cab, cba), that is, individual 1 prefers c to a to b, 2 prefers c to b to a. Then, it must still choose b from {a, b} if the profile were, say: (abc, bac); (acb, bca); (acb, cba); or (abc, cba).|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} known poem in Malayalam, Ramacharitam, {{dated to}} the 12th to 14th century CE, was completed before {{the introduction of}} the Sanskrit alphabet. It shows the same phase of the language as in Jewish and Nasrani Sasanas (dated to mid‑8th century A.D.). But the period of the earliest available literary document cannot be the sole criterion used to determine the antiquity of a language. In its early literature, Malayalam has songs, Pattu, for various subjects and occasions, such as harvesting, love songs, heroes, gods, etc. A form of writing called Campu emerged from the 14th century onwards. It mixed poetry with prose and used a vocabulary strongly influenced by Sanskrit, with themes from epics and Puranas.Rama-charitam, which was composed in the 14th century A.D., may be said to have inaugurated Malayalam literature just as Naniah's Mahabharatam did for Telugu. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> that dialectical and local peculiarities had already developed and stamped themselves in local songs and ballads. But these linguistic variations were at last gathered together and made to give a coloring to a sustained literary work, the Rama-charitam, thereby giving the new language a justification and a new lease on life.|$|E
