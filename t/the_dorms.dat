5|$|Collectively, <b>the</b> <b>dorms</b> were {{at first}} simply {{referred}} to by the university as the Tower Residence Halls. In 1971, the university formally named the complex Litchfield Towers in honor of Edward Litchfield who had served as Pitt's chancellor during their construction and subsequently died in a tragic 1968 airplane crash.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1952, the bonfires were {{constructed}} entirely from fresh-cut logs. The event suffered its first fatality in 1955, {{when a student}} {{was struck by a}} swerving car. The same year (for unrelated reasons), Bonfire was moved from Simpson Drill Field in front of the Memorial Student Center to Duncan Field, near <b>the</b> <b>dorms</b> of the Corps of Cadets (whose leaders oversaw construction). In 1957, the structure collapsed two days before Bonfire was to be held, but students worked around-the-clock to rebuild it, and the bonfire burned as scheduled.|$|E
5|$|Workers {{building}} the dam received {{an average of}} 80Â¢ an hour; the payroll for the dam was among {{the largest in the}} nation. The workers were mainly pulled from Grant, Lincoln, Douglas, and Okanogan counties and women were allowed to work only in <b>the</b> <b>dorms</b> and the cookhouse. Around 8,000 people worked on the project, and Frank A. Banks served as the chief construction engineer. Bert A. Hall was the chief inspector who would accept the dam from the contractors. Orin G. Patch served as the chief of concrete. Construction conditions were dangerous and 77 workers died.|$|E

5|$|On July 10, 2005 a new trolley station {{opened on}} the SDSU campus, after {{construction}} began in 1999. The station connected students and faculty with other areas in San Diego county and helped to combat the low availability of parking around campus. The $103 million station {{was just one of}} the university's several construction projects that occurred in the 2000s. Starting in the late 1990s, a $500 million College Community Redevelopment Project led to the development of the $8.5 million Piedra del Sol Apartments, the $14.3 million Fraternity Row, and future developments of a $15 million Sorority Row, a $150 million Paseo retail, office, and apartment project, as well as a $125 million research and office park. In 2003, a pedestrian bridge opened, connecting several of <b>the</b> <b>dorms</b> to the main campus. In the same year, the campus's most technologically advanced and largest classroom (capable of holding 500 students) was completed. Through 2008 and 2009, the campus began work on constructing a new alumni center, expanding Aztec Center, and modifying Storm Hall and Nasitir Hall to add more office and classroom space.|$|E
5|$|This simple {{philosophy}} was tested as Texas A transitioned from an all-male military college to a coeducational research university. The addition {{of women to}} the Corps presented some challenges, including one high-profile lawsuit and fierce resistance from former Corps and Band members. When women were finally admitted to the band under court order (Fall Semester, 1985); the first three women had to be housed in a separate dorm until accommodations could be made within the band dorms. Reporters were relentless and Haney finally called an open press conference with the three young ladies. The female cadets refused pictures unless their fish buddies (members of their freshman class in their unit) {{were included in the}} photos. With a band dropout rate of 33% the odds were against all of the female cadets succeeding, only Andrea Abat remained in the band through her senior year. Haney realized the separate living conditions were not conducive to good order and discipline and integrated <b>the</b> <b>dorms,</b> grouping females {{at one end of the}} dorm and designating one bathroom for exclusive female use.|$|E
25|$|The {{exterior}} of <b>the</b> <b>dorms</b> for habitual sex offenders where Father Joe lives was actually {{an apartment complex}} in Vancouver that was slated for demolition while the production crew were filming there. Snow {{that can be seen}} outside <b>the</b> <b>dorms</b> was actually fake snow that was imported by the crew and fabricated by the film's Special Effects Department. Bill Roe and Mark Freeborn worked together to create a creepy green glow on the location using green lights. The production crew also created their own factory smoke for chimneys in the background, as Carter came to the opinion that the smoking chimneys made the location look like London. The interior of Joe's apartment was another set and was exactly like the real apartment except that it was slightly bigger. A trans-light was incorporated into the set to resemble daylight visible through a window of the apartment. The set also had a porch that was used for some shots in the scene where Mulder and Scully were outside the apartment. Additional filming was done in Coquitlam, another Vancouver suburb, at Riverview Hospital's Unit 8 building.|$|E

25|$|For this episode, Shin Bora, Heo Young-ji and Block B's Park Kyung {{appeared}} as special panelists. In between announcements of each girl's ranking {{during the first}} elimination, {{events leading up to}} the elimination are shown. Just after arriving at <b>the</b> <b>dorms,</b> the girls are taken to get flu shot. Weeks after, they are weighed and do a series of exercises with the help of trainer Ray Yang. Some girls are put on a strict diet in order to lose weight. The trainees are also tricked into participating in a 'hidden camera'. The first is a consideration test to see who will help a staff struggling with two heavy packs of water bottles. The second is a puddle of coke which was spilled {{on the floor of a}} waiting room to see if they will clean it up. The third is a $30,000 camera which a staff pretends to break during a fake interview. The staff tells each trainee that she might get fired, and some girls take responsibility, pretending it was them who broke it. The 97 trainees choose the 'top visual'. Pledis Entertainment's Zhou Jieqiong takes first place while Jung Chae-yeon, Kim Do-yeon, Kim Se-jeong, Kim Ji-sung, Seo Hye-lin, Park Si-yeon, Kwon Eun-bean, Ki Heui-hyeon (Cathy), Lee Su-hyun, and Jeon So-mi takes 2nd to 11th place respectively.

50|$|Despite {{its young}} history, Keough Hall {{residents}} have established themselves as an up-and-coming dorm community with great enthusiasm and brotherhood, winning Men's Hall of the Year in 2009.

25|$|The {{first part}} of the book chronicles James Bond's {{starting}} attendance at Eton College, {{which is one of the}} best schools in England. There he meets Pritpal, the son of an Indian Maharajah. The two become good friends and live together in <b>the</b> <b>dorms</b> along with another of his friends, a Chinese boy named Tommy Chong. Bond also comes into contact with George Hellebore, an American bully three years older than James. George's father, Lord Randolph Hellebore is an armament dealer who sold weapons to various countries after World War I. It is later revealed that Lord Hellebore knew Bond's father, Andrew Bond, who also sold arms while working for Vickers after the war. Lord Hellebore arrives at Eton to direct and host a tournament cup ("Hellebore Cup") for the boys. The competition is divided into three events: shooting, swimming, and running, It is rumoured that George Hellebore is supposed to win, but an unexpected rival named Andrew Carlton manages to beat him. Bond places seventh in shooting, fourth in his heat in swimming (which was not good enough to qualify for the final race), and first in cross country running. During the running sequence Lord Hellebore attempts to help his son cheat so that he could win the tournament; however, Bond after seeing George take a shortcut a first time decides to follow George the next time, and being the superior runner then passes him to win the race. George tries to trip James with his leg but loses his balance and falls into a mud puddle. Because Bond won first in running, Andrew Carlton is the winner and George Hellebore came in third place in the cup overall, which was unacceptable by his father's standard.|$|E

500|$|The dormitory, {{constructed}} from brick and stone, {{consists of a}} four-story U-shaped main body with a nine-story tower built ostensibly [...] "to help campus water pressure." [...] Construction on the house wrapped up in 1907. Historian Elizabeth A.

Wooden structural support elements are minimal in the house, with the dormitory instead relying on steel and concrete. Instead of using stone for decorative exterior elements including trim and faces, as was common at the time of construction, Pilcher utilized terracotta. Other external features include a pitched copper roof with a low slope, limestone-surrounded entrances, crenellations, and light red brick. According to architectural writers Karen Van Lengen and Lisa Reilly, the tower's presence [...] "created a more monumental and less homelike impression than that of its neighbor, Josselyn" [...] which they speculate may have earned the dorm its nickname, [...] "Pilcher's Crime".|$|E
