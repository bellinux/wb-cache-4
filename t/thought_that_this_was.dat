5|$|As well as {{providing}} thematic consistency with the original, {{the repetition of}} iconography also acted as a vital marketing tool. The marketing of the album was documented in an episode of the 1995 BBC television programme The Music Biz. Executives at Virgin Records <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> important to attract the target audience, who they believed no longer spent much time in record shops. They felt that similarities {{to the design of}} the first album, including Meat Loaf's name in Gothic typography, would entice consumers of the 1977 album to purchase this.The section from this episode about the marketing of Bat Out of Hell II, and the filming of this music video, has been reshown as part of BBC Learning Zone's media studies strand.|$|E
5|$|Between 24 April and 1 May, the IX Army {{fought a}} desperate action {{to break out}} of the pocket in an attempt to link up with the XII Army. Hitler assumed that after a {{successful}} breakout from the pocket, the IX Army could combine forces with the XII Army and would be able to relieve Berlin. There is no evidence to suggest that Generals Heinrici, Busse, or Wenck <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> even remotely strategically feasible, but Hitler's agreement to allow the IX Army to break through Soviet lines allowed many German soldiers to escape to the west and surrender to the United States Army.|$|E

25|$|Air China's parent company, {{state-owned}} China National Aviation Corporation, {{announced in}} January 2008 {{that it would}} offer 32% more than Singapore Airlines for the 24% stake in China Eastern, potentially complicating the deal that Singapore Airlines and Temasek had proposed. However, minority shareholders declined the offer made by Singapore Airlines. It is <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> due to the massive effort made by Air China to buy the 24% stake.|$|E
25|$|The lack of {{official}} credits {{is not a}} legal problem, given {{the age of the}} source material, but it troubled journalist Jim Fusilli of the Wall Street Journal.

25|$|The sketch was {{conceived}} when SCTV {{moved to the}} CBC television network. Due to {{the difference in the}} amount of time allocated for commercials, each episode to be broadcast on that network was two minutes longer than those syndicated to the United States. The CBC network heads asked the show's producers to add specifically identifiably Canadian content for those two minutes. Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a ridiculous request, given that the show had been taped in Canada, with a mostly Canadian cast and crew, for two years. The request inspired them to create a parody that would incorporate every aspect of the humorous stereotype of Canadians.|$|E
25|$|It is {{a curious}} fact that amaurotic family idiocy, a rare and fatal disease of children, occurs mostly among Jews. The largest number of cases has been {{observed}} in the United States—over thirty in number. It was at first <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> an exclusively Jewish disease {{because most of the}} cases at first reported were between Russian and Polish Jews; but recently there have been reported cases occurring in non-Jewish children. The chief characteristics of the disease are progressive mental and physical enfeeblement; weakness and paralysis of all the extremities; and marasmus, associated with symmetrical changes in the macula lutea. On investigation of the reported cases, they found that neither consanguinity nor syphilitic, alcoholic, or nervous antecedents in the family history are factors in the etiology of the disease. No preventive measures have as yet been discovered, and no treatment has been of benefit, all the cases having terminated fatally.|$|E
25|$|Ancient sources mention {{what brought}} Pompey into the alliance, but are silent on what {{interests}} might have brought Crassus into the fold. There are only mentions of Caesar bringing Pompey and Crassus together, which Plutarch {{described as a}} reconciliation. Cassius Dio <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> something that required skill—almost {{as if it were}} a reconciliation of the irreconcilable. In the writings of Suetonius and Plutarch and in some letters and a speech of Cicero, we find clues about both what the interests of Crassus may have been, and indications that Crassus and Pompey might have been less irreconcilable that their portrayals suggest and that the three men of the triumvirate had collaborated before. It could be argued that the formation of the first triumvirate was the result of the marginalisation of an enemy (Caesar) and an outsider (Pompey) and the rebuttal of interests associated with Crassus by the optimates who held sway in the senate.|$|E
500|$|Triton's western {{hemisphere}} {{consists of a}} strange series of fissures and depressions known as [...] "cantaloupe terrain" [...] because of its resemblance to {{the skin of a}} cantaloupe melon.

50|$|Retinal mosaic is {{the name}} given to the {{distribution}} of any particular type of neuron across any particular layer in the retina.

25|$|From Geneva she {{proceeded}} to the United Kingdom, renting a flat in London's Barbican Estate. In March {{she made a}} visit to Washington D.C., where she met with middle-ranking government officials but was kept at bay by the governing administration of President Ronald Reagan. Bhutto made several additional visits to the United States over the coming few years. While in exile, Benazir became a rallying point for the PPP. Murtaza {{believed that it was}} he, and not Benazir, who was their father's designated political heir; as evidence, he cited that he had been asked to manage his father's Larkana constituency in the 1977 general election. Bhutto biographer Shyam Bhatia <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> probably Zulfikar's intention, as the latter would have recognised the significant impediments to a woman being elected leader in a conservative Islamic society like Pakistan. Benazir nevertheless maintained that her father had always wanted her to become a politician.|$|E
25|$|These {{groups were}} collectively called Islas del Arzobispo (Archbishop Islands) in Spanish {{sources of the}} 18th19th century. This name is most likely due to an {{expedition}} organized by the Arzobispo (Archbishop) Pedro Moya de Contreras, Viceroy of New Spain, to explore the northern Pacific and the islands of Japan. Its main objective was to find the long sought and legendary islands of Rica de Oro (Rich in Gold), Rica de Plata (Rich in Silver) and the Islas del Armenio (Islands of the Armenian). After several years of planning and frustrated attempts the expedition finally set sail on 12 July 1587 commanded by Pedro de Unamuno. Even if it did revisit the Daitō Islands, already charted by Bernardo de la Torre in 1543, the expedition {{could not find the}} wanted islands after searching the positions where they were charted in contemporary references. Japanese maps at the time seem to have been rather inaccurate and therefore considered by some to be deliberately misleading. It is <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> an attempt to discourage colonization attempts by foreign nations. Frederick William Beechey used the Spanish name as late as 1831 and believed that the Japanese Boninsima referred to entirely different islands.|$|E
25|$|In 62 BC Pompey {{returned}} to Italy {{after winning the}} Third Mithridatic War against Pontus and Armenia (in present-day eastern Turkey) and annexing Syria. He wanted the senate to ratify the acts of the settlements he had made with the kings and cities in the region en bloc. He was opposed by the optimates led by Lucius Licinius Lucullus, who carried {{the day in the}} senate with the support of Cato the Younger. Pompey had taken over the command of the last phase of that war from Lucullus, who felt that he should have been allowed to continue the war and win it. Moreover, when he took over the command of the war Pompey ignored the settlements Lucullus had already made. Lucullus demanded that Pompey should render account for each act individually and separately instead of asking for the approval of all his acts at once in a single vote {{as if they were the}} acts of a master. The character of the acts was not known. Each act should be scrutinised, and the senators should ratify those that suited the senate. Appian thought that the optimates, particularly Lucullus, were motivated by jealousy. Crassus cooperated with Lucullus on this matter. Plutarch wrote that when Lucullus {{returned to}} Rome after being relieved from his command the senate hoped that it would find in him an opponent of the tyranny of Pompey and a champion of the aristocracy. However, he withdrew from public affairs. Those who looked on the power of Pompey with suspicion made Crassus and Cato the champions of the senatorial party when Lucullus declined the leadership. Plutarch also wrote that Pompey asked the senate to postpone the consular elections so that he could be in Rome to help Marcus Pupius Piso Frugi Calpurnianus to canvass for his candidacy. Cato swayed the senate to reject this. Plutarch also noted that according to some sources since Cato was the major stumbling-block for his ambitions, he asked for Cato’s elder niece's hand for himself and the hand of the younger one, whereas according to other sources he asked for the hand Cato’s daughters. The women were happy with this because of Pompey’s high repute, but Cato <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> aimed bribing him by means of a marriage alliance and refused.|$|E

25|$|Other writers blamed either Pompey or Caesar. Plutarch did not {{indicate}} when the incident happened either. In his version it was a ploy by the supporters of Pompey, who claimed that Vettius was plotting to kill Pompey. When questioned in the senate he accused several people, but when he spoke {{in front of the}} people he said that Licinius Lucullus was the one who arranged the plot. No one believed him and {{it was clear that the}} supporters of Pompey got him to make false accusations. The deceit became even more obvious when he was battered to death a few days later. The opinion was that he was killed by those who had hired him. Suetonius wrote that Caesar had bribed Vettius to tell a story about a conspiracy to murder Pompey according to a prearranged plot, but he was suspected of ‘double-dealing.’ He also wrote that Caesar was supposed to have poisoned him. Cicero gave an account in some letters to his fiend Atticus. Vettius, an informer, claimed that he had told Curio Junior that he had decided to use his slaves to assassinate Pompey. Curio told his father Gaius Scribonius Curio, who in turn told Pompey. When questioned in the senate he said that there was a group of conspiratorial young men led by Curio. The secretary of Calpurnius Bibulus gave him a dagger from Bibulus. He was to attack Pompey at the forum at some gladiatorial games and the ringleader for this was Aemilius Paullus. However, Aemilius Paullus was in Greece at the time. He also said that he had warned Pompey about the danger of plots. Vettius was arrested for confessing to possession of a dagger. The next day Caesar brought him to the rosta (a platform for public speeches). Vettius did not mention Curio. He implicated other men instead. Cicero thought that Vettius had been briefed on what to say during the night. The men he mentioned had not cast any suspicion. Cicero noted that it was <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a set up and that the plan had been to catch Vettius in the forum with a dagger and his slaves with weapons, and that he was then to give information. He also thought that this had been masterminded by Caesar, who got Vettius to get close to Curio.|$|E
500|$|After {{weeks in}} which the court heard the prosecution's {{evidence}} from the committal hearings, the defence opened on 7 June.
