5|$|Blessed be God's name? Why, but {{why would}} I bless Him? Every fiber in me rebelled. Because He caused <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> to burn in His mass graves? Because He kept six crematoria working day and night, {{including}} Sabbath and the Holy Days? Because in His great might, He had created Auschwitz, Birkenau, Buna, {{and so many other}} factories of death? How could I say to Him: Blessed be Thou, Almighty, Master of the Universe, who chose us among all nations to be tortured day and night, to watch as our fathers, our mothers, our brothers end up in the furnaces?...|$|E
5|$|William Booth {{began his}} 'Christian Revival Society' in 1865, preaching the gospel {{in a tent}} erected in the 'Friends Burial Ground', Thomas Street, Whitechapel. Others joined his 'Christian Mission', and on 7 August 1878 the Salvation Army was formed at a meeting held at 272 Whitechapel Road. A statue commemorates both his mission and his work in helping the poor. Dubliner Thomas John Barnardo came to the London Hospital, Whitechapel to train for medical missionary work in China. Soon after his arrival in 1866 a cholera {{epidemic}} swept the East End killing 3,000 people. Many families were left destitute, with <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> orphaned and forced to beg or find work in the factories. In 1867, Barnardo set up a Ragged School to provide a basic education but was shown the many children sleeping rough. His first home for boys was established at 18 Stepney Causeway in 1870. When a boy died after being turned away (the home was full), the policy was instituted that 'No Destitute Child Ever Refused Admission'.|$|E

As a result, they turned to putting additives into the feed and milk, including melamine, to boost the measured level of protein. Hundreds of <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> became ill, China's milk exports virtually ended, executives and officials were arrested and some executed, and companies went bankrupt.|$|E
25|$|Following the Chernobyl {{disaster}} in 1986, Schneerson called for efforts to rescue Ukrainian Jewish children from Chernobyl and founded a special organization for this purpose. The first rescue flight occurred on August 3, 1990, when 196 Jewish children were flown to Israel {{and brought to}} a shelter campus.

25|$|A key {{turning point}} for braille {{literacy}} was {{the passage of the}} Rehabilitation Act of 1973, an act of Congress that moved <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> from specialized schools for the blind into mainstream public schools. Because {{only a small percentage of}} public schools could afford to train and hire braille-qualified teachers, braille literacy has declined since the law took effect. Braille literacy rates have improved slightly since the bill was passed, in part because of pressure from consumers and advocacy groups that has led 27 states to pass legislation mandating that children who are legally blind be given the opportunity to learn braille.|$|E
25|$|Texans were {{disturbed}} by {{accounts of the}} continued captivity of <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> and women, especially because of the stories by those rescued or ransomed. They made increased demands for the Republic to retaliate against the Comanche. Under Lamar, the Republic of Texas waged war on the Comanche, invaded Comancheria, burned villages, attacked and destroyed numerous war bands, but the effort bankrupted the fledgling Republic. More importantly, although the Texas forces succeeded in rescuing large numbers of hostages, thousands remained in captivity. Houston was elected to his second term {{in large part because}} of the failure of Lamar's Indian policies.|$|E

Coordinating with the United Nations and “utilizing an executive order to raise immigration quotas, President Carter doubled the number of Southeast Asian refugees allowed into the United States each month.” The URM {{was established}}, in part, to deal with the influx of refugee children.|$|E

25|$|The OECD {{reported}} on Irish schools {{and levels of}} education in 1962-68, as {{an essential part of}} the process of Ireland's 1973 accession into the EEC, providing the vital external stimulus for reform. Finally the 1970 Kennedy Report, prepared in 1967-70, though flawed in parts, led to the abolition of the schools over the next decade, starting with Artane in 1969. In the interim, tens of <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> had been inmates, some from infancy. Despite frequent complaints and enquiries that called for reforms, the official line until the 1990s was that nobody in government, the church or the civil service really knew what was taking place. Notably, Micheal Martin stated on 13 May 1999 that: The concept of the child as a separate individual with rights came late to this country.|$|E
25|$|McCloskey won the 1942 Caldecott Medal for Make Way for Ducklings. The story set in Boston, Massachusetts {{features}} a mallard pair that nests {{on an island}} in the Charles River. After some time raising eight ducklings on the island, the mother leads them to the Public Garden downtown. Famously, a friendly policeman stops traffic for them to cross a busy street. The story soon became a Boston institution. Sculptor Nancy Schön created a bronze version of Mrs. Mallard and the ducklings in 1987, installed along a walkway between pond and street. There <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> climb them every year and many more people photograph them; the park is also the annual site of a Make Way for Ducklings Mother's Day parade, featuring hundreds of children dressed in the costumes of their favorite characters.
