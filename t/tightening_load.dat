40|$|Threaded {{fasteners}} {{were developed}} long time (let’s remember that Archimedes – 287 - 212 BC – invented the water screw). Nowadays, bolted joints {{are used in}} almost all sectors of the industry. But in spite of having been an important machine part for centuries, problems may be encountered with them. They are so common that they are taken for granted and too often, not analyzed as deeply as it should be. The wrong tightening {{is one of the}} most frequent causes of ductile rupture and by far the most frequent cause of fatigue failure. The tightening operation is never easy. It is necessary to pay particular attention to the choice of the tightening tool, the process and the control method. The tightening operation may itself cause damage on parts. The <b>tightening</b> <b>load</b> must not be too low, or excessive or not equally distributed among the bolts. These three defects can even be made on the same bolted joint! This impacts badly the performance of the assembly and leads to a shorter lifespan. If insufficient precautions are taken, the real tightening preload on all the bolts will not fit well with the requirements and would be badly distributed. Consequently, the practical conditions are quite different from the hypothesizes which are taken for the initial calculations (analytics or FEM) at the design stage. Thus, the results of the calculations of bolted joints cannot be considered as accurate and reliable. Practically, there are several means to tighten a bolt. The two ways most frequently used are torque wrench and hydraulic bolt tensioner. Torque wrench involves exerting a torque to the bolt head or the nut. Hydraulic bolt tensioner applies a traction load directly on the bolt. It is well known that bolt tensioners give better accuracy and homogeneity in the final <b>tightening</b> <b>load</b> than the torque method, but the tension load applied with the tensioner must be higher than the final remaining <b>tightening</b> <b>load.</b> So, the paper focusses on the hydraulic tensioner to show how the <b>tightening</b> <b>load</b> can be obtained from the applied tension load and to propose a way to optimize and secure the tightening process. However, for the reasons above mentioned it appears necessary to first make a general description of technical aspects of bolted joints. What really happens when tightening with torque wrench or with bolt tensioner is explained...|$|E
40|$|HYPOTHESIS No. 5 FiberWire (Arthrex, Naples, FL, USA) {{cerclage}} (FWC) and 1. 25 -mm {{stainless steel}} wire cerclage (SSWC) are biomechanically similar in resistance to prosthetic subsidence in shoulder arthroplasty. METHODS In this laboratory bench study, 3 different surgical knot configurations (4 -throw knot, cow hitch, and simple hitch) using a No. 5 FWC were evaluated and compared with a 1. 25 -mm SSWC. First, distraction tests were performed using bovine femoral cortical half shells mounted on a testing jig. Cerclage <b>tightening,</b> <b>load</b> to a 3 -mm gap opening, and load to total failure were measured. Second, uncemented humeral prosthetic stems were inserted into an experimentally split humeral medullary canal, secured by the cerclage. After 100 N of preloading, the prosthesis was advanced into the humerus at a speed of 0. 2 mm/s, and resistance during subsidence up to a penetration depth of 10 mm, as well as gap opening, was measured. RESULTS Tightening force showed higher values for SSWC (618 N) than FWC (131 - 137 N) (P <. 001). Load to total failure was comparable among the 3 different FWC knots (2, 642 - 2, 804 N), which were significantly stronger than SSWC (1, 775 N, P <. 001). At 3 mm of distraction, SSWC (1, 820 N), cow hitch (1, 803 N), and single-throw hitch (1, 709 N) performed significantly better than a 4 -throw knot (1, 289 N) (P <. 01). Subsidence testing showed no difference in force restraint or gap opening between the best FWC and SSWC. CONCLUSIONS FWCs appear, in vitro, equally suitable to steel wires to stabilize nondisplaced periprosthetic humeral fractures. To actively reduce a displaced fracture, steel wires may still be the first choice...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{problematic}} of gear units and machine foundating and consequences that occur by foundation screws releasing. Namely, reliable operating of gear units, {{as well as}} other stationary machines, requires properly foundating. However, after certain period of time, relaxation of screw material, self-untightening of nuts and looseness of foundation screws influence on reducing the force of preload screw <b>tightening</b> and unequal <b>load</b> distribution. This unequal load distribution causes unequal deformations, which generate occuring vibrations. In extreme cases, breakages of screws and heavier accidents of systems driven by that gear units or machines can happen.

Standards for tightening procedures for large diameter anchor bolts are proposed. These bolts, 38 mm (I 1 / 2 in.) in diameter or greater, are widely used in highway appurtenance. In current practices, the contractor is left to his or her own judgment concerning how tight to tighten the nuts on the anchor bolt system. Recent bolt failures have raised concerns about nut tightening procedures. When the nuts of a double nut system are not <b>tightened</b> sufficiently, fatigue <b>loading,</b> and even impact loading, can cause failure of the bolts. Four full-size test specimens were built to evaluate the double nut connection used for anchorage on cantilever overhead sign structures (COSS) and on high mast illumination poles (HMIP). This thesis details the tightening, static, and fatigue tests performed on the two COSS specimens...|$|R
30|$|The occlusal force {{does not}} load {{only on the}} screw. The {{internal}} conical connection interface also helps to transfer and distribute the loading force to the implant [13]. The axial compressive component of occlusal force during oral function causes axial displacement of the abutment to the implant connection, increasing the frictional resistance and screw joint stability of the dental implant [7, 8]. Three factors {{that may lead to}} the axial displacement of the implant-abutment connection are machining tolerance, the wedge effect, and the settling effect. Firstly, machining tolerance is a dimensional variation characteristic of machined components. The precision of every implant component varies during manufacturing due to machining tolerance [14]. Secondly, the wedge effect occurs when <b>tightening</b> torque or <b>loading</b> force is applied to the abutment [15]. The abutment acts as a wedge transferring the axial force directly to the implant. Lastly, the settling effect occurs when rough spots on the contacting surfaces of the connection are flattened under load [16]. It causes the two surfaces to come closer together and leads to axial displacement. This axial displacement causes the length of the abutment screw to shorten, diminishing the screw preload [17]. The settling effect is the main cause of screw loosening. When the abutment is fastened to the implant body with the abutment screw, a settling phenomenon occurs in which the implant body and the abutment are deformed. Even if fastened at 30 [*]N[*]cm, depending on the implant system, the loosening torque becomes smaller than the 7 to 10 % fastening torque. After 5 [*]min from this point, it is necessary to loosen it twice [18]. The degree of settling depends on the surface roughness, surface hardness, and magnitude of the tightening torque and of the occlusal loading force [16]. On the one hand, the settling effect [17] causes the axial displacement leading to the decrease of the screw preload. On the other hand, the axial displacement causes the cone connection surface adaptation providing frictional resistance and screw-joint stability [7, 8].|$|R
40|$|Trabalho final do 5 º ano com vista à atribuição do grau de mestre no âmbito do ciclo de estudos de Mestrado Integrado em Medicina Dentária apresentado à Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Coimbra. Background: Micromovements in the implant-abutment {{connection}} {{may influence}} periimplant bone preservation, {{especially in the}} cervical region of the implant. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate and quantify these micromovements after repeated cycles of tightening and loosening the prosthetic screw using the method of three dimensional image correlation (DIC 3 D). Materials and Methods: 10 Mis® Seven internal hexagon 4. 2 x 13 implants were included in an acrylic block with similar elasticity of bone and randomly allocated into 2 groups. Mis® Titanium abutments (Standard cementing post, anti-rotational) were screwed to the implants at 30 Ncm torque and loaded up to 200 N with an universal testing machine (AG-I Shimadzu®) at a 30 º angle. Samples were then randomly allocated into two groups. Group I was submitted to one cycle of loosening and retightening of the abutment screw and group II was submitted to 2 consecutive cycles of loosening and tightening of the abutment screw. Each sample was loaded again and the micromovements captured with Vic- 3 D (Correlated Solutions, Inc), in three axis U, V, W, corresponding to the movements in the mesio-distal, vertical and antero-posterior directions, statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 20. 0, considering independent samples t-test for group comparison and paired samples t-test for intra-group comparison. Mixed ANOVA was used to determine the interaction of screw loosening and <b>tightening</b> cycles and <b>load</b> on the micromovements of the abutments. Results: No statistically significant differences were found between groups regarding the three directions, under any load. Also, no statistically significant differences were found between micromovements before and after the screwing cycles for each group. However, absolute displacement was higher in Group II under 100 N load than in Group I after the protocol with a statistically significant difference of - 0. 168 (95 % CI, - 0. 321 to - 0. 016), t(8) =- 2. 55, p= 0. 03. Conclusion: The implant/abutment connection according to the protocol performed, demonstrated good resistance and a precise fit between these interfaces, therefore, in case of unscrewing is not justified changing the screw...|$|R
40|$|Technical {{progress}} {{in the field of}} municipal wastewater treatment, which includes removal of eutrophicating pollution loads, has {{in the past few years}} significantly improved the process flow of sewage treatment plants. More attention is now being paid to the high number of disease-causing germs in the sewage treatment plant effluent. Micro and ultra filtration, combined with the activated sludge process, has turned out in recent years to be a suitable method for minimising the effluent <b>load.</b> <b>Tightening</b> discharge standards for sewage treatment effluents can thus be met, without the need for the conventional aeration and secondary clarification tanks or filtration and disinfection plants. Membrane bioreactor technology provides a good alternative to the conventional treatment of municipal wastewater (Huber Technology, 2004). - Most of the current regulatory requirements will be met by the membrane separation step. - Membrane bioreactor technology is a space saving technique. Its modulebased design allows the capacity to be easily increased when needed. - Membranes will continue to decrease in price in the coming years. - With improved effluent quality, re-use of the formerly wasted effluent is possible, which makes it a sustainable technology. - It combines the biological treatment with a membrane separation step. Because of this combination it has several advantages over conventional treatment by activated sludge followed by a settling tank. - The settling tank is unnecessary because of the membrane separation; submerged membrane bioreactors can be up to 5 times smaller than a conventional activated sludge plant. - Membrane bioreactors can be operated at mixed liquor suspended solids of up to 20, 000 mg/L. - Biomass concentration can be greater than in conventional systems, which reduces reactor volume. - The membrane can retain soluble material with a high molecular weight, improving its biodegradation in the bioreactor. - Good effluent quality. - Good disinfection capability, with significant bacterial and viral reductions achievable using UF and MF membranes. This paper describes the activated sludge treatment and the membrane bioreactor processes, using Melbourne Water's Western Treatment plant at Werribee, in Victoria, and CitiWater's Magnetic Island plant, in Queensland, as examples of the treatment processes. Sufficient information is given to permit an understanding of the two processes and their relationships. The more recent MBR technology can be seen as an emulation of the natural filtration processes occurring in broad acre treatment, without the large tracts of land area, or the plant and the number of required processes needed for later advancements...|$|R
