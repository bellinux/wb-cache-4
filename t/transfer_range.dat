40|$|Geostationary {{satellites}} (GEOs) play {{a significant}} role in the regional satellite navigation system. Simulation experiments show that the clock corrections could be mitigated through a single strategy or double differencing strategies for a navigation constellation, but for the mode of individual GEO orbit determination, high precision orbit and clock correction could not be obtained in the orbit determination based on the pseudorange data. A new GEO combined precise orbit determination (POD) strategy is studied in this paper, which combines pseudorange data and C-band <b>transfer</b> <b>ranging</b> data. This strategy overcomes the deficiency of C-band <b>transfer</b> <b>ranging</b> caused by limited stations and tracking time available. With the combination of <b>transfer</b> <b>ranging</b> and pseudorange data, clock corrections between the GEO and the stations can be estimated simultaneously along with orbital parameters, maintaining self-consistency between the satellite ephemeris and clock correction parameters. The error covariance analysis is conducted to illuminate the contributions from the <b>transfer</b> <b>ranging</b> data and the psudoranging data. Using data collected for a Chinese GEO satellite with 3 C-band <b>transfer</b> <b>ranging</b> stations and 4 L-band pseudorange tracking stations, POD experiments indicate that a meter-level accuracy is achievable. The root-mean-square (RMS) of the post-fit C-band ranging data is about 0. 203 m, and the RMS of the post-fit pseudorange is 0. 408 m. Radial component errors of the POD experiments are independently evaluated with the satellite laser ranging (SLR) data from a station in Beijing, with the residual RMS of 0. 076 m. The SLR evaluation also suggests that for 2 -h orbital predication, the predicted radial error is about 0. 404 m, and the clock correction error is about 1. 38 ns. Even for the combination of one C-band <b>transfer</b> <b>ranging</b> station and 4 pseudorange stations, POD is able to achieve a reasonable accuracy with the radial error of 0. 280 m and the 2 -h predicted radial error of 0. 888 m. Clock synchronization between the GEO and tracking stations is achieved with an estimated accuracy of about 1. 55 ns, meeting the navigation service requirements...|$|R

40|$|Charge-transfer {{polymers}} are a {{new class}} of nonlinear optical materials which can be used for generating femtosecond holographic gratings. Using semiconducting polymers sensitized with varying concentrations of C{sub 60 }, holographic gratings were recorded by individual ultrafast laser pulses; the diffraction efficiency and time decay of the gratings were measured using non-degenerate four-wave mixing. Using a figure of merit for dynamic data processing, the temporal diffraction efficiency, this new class of materials exhibits between two and 12 orders of magnitude higher response than previous reports. The charge <b>transfer</b> <b>range</b> at polymer/C{sub 60 } interfaces was further studied using transient absorption spectroscopy. The fact that charge-transfer occurs in the picosecond-time scale in bilayer structures (thickness 200 {angstrom}) implies that diffusion of localized excitations to the interface is not the dominant mechanism; the charge <b>transfer</b> <b>range</b> is a significant fraction of the film thickness.
