25|$|By {{the time}} Ramos succeeded Corazon Aquino in 1992, the Philippine economy was already {{burdened}} {{with a heavy}} budget deficit. This was largely the result of austerity measures imposed by a standard credit arrangement with the International Monetary Fund and the destruction caused by natural disasters such as the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo. Hence, according to Canlas, pump priming through government spending was immediately ruled out due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>deficit.</b> Ramos therefore resorted to institutional changes through structural policy reforms, of which included privatization and deregulation. He sanctioned {{the formation of the}} Legislative-Executive Development Advisory Council (LEDAC), which served as a forum for consensus building, {{on the part of the}} Executive and the Legislative branches, on important bills on economic policy reform measures (4).|$|E

The baseline assumed a series of significant spending cuts under the Budget Control Act of 2011 would take effect, so delaying or avoiding them increases the deficit relative to the baseline. The CBO's analysis assumes most of the spending reductions in the Budget Control Act ($1.2 trillion over a decade) or the equivalent will still occur.|$|E

This is an increase of 4%, or 2.1% percent real growth after adjusting for inflation.
