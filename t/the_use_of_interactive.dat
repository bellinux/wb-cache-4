This led to some complicated puzzles that the team was inspired to build upon further as a separate title. Croteam designed the general world setting and outline of the story, and then brought two writers on board, Tom Jubert and Jonas Kyratzes, who consulted on narrative design and philosophy on the bases of transhumanism and other important questions about humanity.|$|E

The present study examines ethnic differences in <b>the</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> <b>interactive</b> uncertainty reduction communication [...] self-disclosure, interrogative strategies, non-verbal immediacy, and other's self-disclosure [...] and their inter-relationships with attributional confidence (uncertainty reduction). A total of 1163 college students from the United States, representing African-, Asian-, Hispanic-, and Euro-American ethnicities participated in a survey soliciting information on <b>the</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty reduction strategies with a same-sexed, same-ethnic, equal-status acquaintance. Significant differ-ences were found in <b>the</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty reduction strategies among the various ethnicities. Self-disclosure had a pan-cultural effect on attributional confidence but the other types of uncertainty reduction communication appeared to be more culture-specific, contributing significantly to attributional confidence only for certain ethnic groups.
