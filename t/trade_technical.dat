2500|$|In the Skandinavisk Tidskrift för Textilindustri (Scandinavian Journal of Textile Industry), N:o 7-8, 1931, {{which was}} printed at AB Borås Tidningstryckeri in Swedish, {{there was an}} article about Kornél Tolnai's {{invention}} with text and pictures. The title of the article was A valuable tool for rationalization of industrial operation, Business professionals, investors and manufacturers insist on an economic production. (In Swedish: Ett värdefullt hjälpmedel vid rationalisering av industriell drift, Affärslivet, aktieägare och fabrikanter yrka på en ekonomisk produktion.) The responsible publisher for the publication, a <b>trade</b> <b>technical</b> journal, was Hugo Hennig from the textile factory in Borås. The Teletachograf and the Centralograf were put together, as for example {{in the office of the}} manager of the spinning mill in the big cotton firm [...] (Goldberger Textilművek Rt.) in Budapest. Here was also System Tolnai connected to a control plant in the ringspinning hall.|$|E
2500|$|In 1934, {{ten years}} after his exam in 1924 at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Kornél Tolnai had a lecture about his inventions Teletachograf and Centralograf at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics (Hungarian: , BME). The title of the lecture was Efficiency Improvement of the Textile Industry. The lecture had the same {{information}} as was printed in the Hungarian <b>trade</b> <b>technical</b> journal [...] "Magyar Textiltechnologusok Lapja", May 25, 1934 [...] "TEXTIL-IPAR", Budapest. At that time, in 1934, the technical highschool in Budapest was named Royal Joseph Technical University. It was reorganized in 1871 and was elevated to equal rank with other universities in the country. In 1910 it moved to its current site near Gellért square (next to the Art Nouveau Hotel Gellért). In 1934 it was reorganized again as Palatine Joseph University of Technology and Economics and it played a dominant role in the interwar industrialization process, together with engineering and economist training in Hungary. In Hungarian {{the name of the}} highschool was M. kir. József nádor Műszaki és Gazdaságtudományi Egyetemet.

Despite positive evidence about profitability and improvements in testing procedures, skepticism about <b>technical</b> <b>trading</b> profits remains widespread among academics mainly due to data snooping problems.

Results indicate that for various futures contracts and <b>technical</b> <b>trading</b> systems tested, <b>technical</b> <b>trading</b> profits have gradually declined over time.

The advantage of the FDR over existing methods is that it selects more outperforming rules and di- versies against model uncertainty. Persistence tests show that an investor would never have been able to select ex ante the future best-performing rules. Moreover, even the in-sample performance is completely oset by the introduction of transaction costs. Overall, our results seriously call into question the economic value of <b>technical</b> <b>trading</b> rules. <b>Technical</b> <b>Trading,</b> False Discovery Rate,Persistence, Transaction Costs. ...|$|R
