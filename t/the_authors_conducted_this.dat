40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} the Courts in ensuring that human rights that exist on paper are ‘practical and effective’ in application. <b>The</b> <b>author</b> <b>conducts</b> <b>this</b> examination by considering the important role {{of the rule of law}} in the application of human rights. <b>The</b> <b>author</b> argues that <b>the</b> written law, which enshrines human rights, only becomes legally enforceable if there exists a functioning and proper government structure. That structure includes an independent and impartial judiciary which is capable of ensuring proper implementation of the rule of law. In a democracy governed by the rule of law, the government is also bound by the law and that law contains safeguards protecting everyone’s individual freedoms. <b>The</b> <b>author</b> sets out five developments which explain the great increase in the importance of fundamental rights in recent years - proliferation, horizontal effect, internationalisation and a broadening of perspective. The final part of the paper takes two topics which emanate from consideration of the first of these five developments, proliferation. The first topic is the scope for a national approach versus European uniformity and the second is the difference between destructive and constructive criticism of the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights. This paper concludes by again underlining the important role of the rule of law in ensuring government accountability and the implementation of human rights and argues that because of the acceptance by national Courts of the aforementioned developments, those Courts are better prepared to interpret human rights in the modern world...|$|R

Three hospice caring triads comprised of patients, family caregivers, and nurses along with one nurse-patient dyad, were recruited into this longitudinal qualitative study. Each group was observed during nursing visits. Triad and dyad members were individually interviewed. Nurses participated in a focus group and survey. <b>The</b> <b>author</b> used constant comparative methods of data analysis, including line-by-line gerund coding, theoretical codes from cancer pain assessment standards, theoretical sampling of early codes, memo writing, and concept-mapping to raise codes into concepts and domains for a theoretical framework. Study trustworthiness included appropriate methodology to answer research questions, prolonged and repeated participant engagement, triangulation of content across participants, reflexive memos, and use of multiple data sources. Results were presented in a triadic case study comparing and contrasting the two cancer pain social processes domains related to pain control: Controlling Cancer Pain and Proximity. The first domain included perceptions of pain control, goals, and efficacy. The second domain included physical and emotional distance between triad members, presence of communication, and level of agreement. When triads were compared, one triad with close emotional and physical proximity had a shared perception of pain meaning and goals for control, and effective communication for pain management behaviors. The other triads had more physical and emotional distance, communication that was vague, and differing perceptions of pain control, pain meaning, or control goals. An important difference for these other triads {{was a lack of}} agreement about pain perception and pain severity, as well as vague communication about pain perception, with subsequent impact on pain goals. Controlling Cancer Pain and Proximity social processes are inextricable with cancer pain management for hospice caring triads. Assessment tools for proximity-related social processes which measure closeness, communication, and agreement among hospice caring triad members should be developed and tested for improving cases of poorly controlled pain.

Thus, <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>this</b> study to compare how frequently junior anesthesiology residents suspected obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in preoperative assessments of SPs versus a VH. Method The authors presented a patient whose case included the historical features of OSA (snoring, daytime fatigue, observed apnea, hypertension, and obesity). Three SPs (in 2008) and one VH (in 2009) were necessary to run the residents through the assessment. The VH appeared morbidly obese and had a neck circumference of 40 inches. An airway exam of the VH displayed an image of redundant soft tissue, prominent tongue, and tonsillar hypertrophy. The VH responded to natural speech by recognizing “triggers ” in a human’s voice.

40|$|Bereavement, an {{unavoidable}} event in everyone’s life, brings endless missing, grief, and suffering to people. Among {{all kinds of}} bereavement, losing a child is considered the most sorrowful and traumatizing. It is extremely difficult for parents who lose a child to recover from their deepest pain. On May 12, 2008, an earthquake, measuring 8. 0 Ms, occurred in Wenchuan, Sichuan province, China. The earthquake killed more than 70, 000 people and left about 20, 000 missing. During the earthquake, some school buildings collapsed and as a result, hundreds of students died. Their parents experienced overwhelming bereavement. To understand what bereaved mothers experience and how they cope with bereavement after the loss of children, <b>the</b> <b>author</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>this</b> longitudinal study based on the dual process model of coping with bereavement (DPM), and applied qualitative inquiry using interpretative phenomenological analysis. In this study, <b>the</b> <b>author</b> has reported on her 4 waves of interviews with these parents, regarding how they coped with grief over 2 years. <b>The</b> <b>author</b> <b>conducted</b> 4 waves of in-depth, face-to-face interviews with mothers who lost their children during the Wenchuan earthquake (N= 43). The findings reveal that three levels of stresses exist in these bereaved mothers’ (BMs) grief experiences, including individual, family, and society levels. On the individual level, they experienced not only emotional distress, such as overwhelming grief, despair, and anger, but they also experienced cognitive distresses, such as regret, guilt, meaninglessness and hopelessness. On the family level, BMs experienced various stresses, such as family incompleteness, despair of their family life, and tensions with their spouses. On the society level, these BMs experienced pressure from social expectations and public opinion. They felt segregated and detached from their social networks. Life became meaningless to these BMs, resulting in suicidal thoughts. These BMs practiced a variety of coping strategies {{to deal with their}} endless grief and stresses in their daily lives. These BMs actively worked through their grief and negative emotions. They adjusted their cognition to deal with their children’s deaths, and made efforts to reconstruct their lives; through things like having another child, rebuilding their life purpose, and rebuilding relationships with others. Avoidance strategies included proactive avoidance and reactive avoidance coping. Respite was manifested in the BMs temporarily devoting themselves to other things in order to distract themselves from tremendous bereavement.

Methods. The authors found online CDE courses through Internet search engines and dental indexes. They recorded each course's Web page address, title, topic, length, credit hours and cost. Then they classified course providers, categorized topics, compared course length with credit hours and calculated cost per credit hour. Results. The authors located 157 online CDE courses offered by 32 providers. The courses covered a wide range of topics, and most were five screens long or shorter. Credit hours per screen ranged from 0. 05 to two, and cost per credit hour ranged from no charge to $ 25. Conclusions. Online CDE courses are hard to locate, making this material accessible only to people who are well-versed in retrieving information on the Internet. The brevity of most courses may make them appropriate for incremental study at the dental practitioner's convenience. Guidelines to correlate credit hours with course length should be developed.

However, according to the minister of Communication and Information Technologies (MOCIT), only three e-services are provided by this program up to writing this paper. Moreover, he decided to freeze the current working on e-government programme. These facts drove <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> to <b>conduct</b> <b>this</b> research. General review of the existing literature concerning e-government implementation in Jordan was applied, then a qualitative research was utilised to uncover the reasons behind the failure of the e-government program in Jordan. The collected data then was analysed using Strauss and Corbin's method of grounded theory. This paper illustrates that Jordanian government need to exert strenuous efforts to move from the first stage of e-government implementation into an interactive one after fourteen years of launching the program, considering that only three e-services are presented up to October 2013. Reasons behind the failure of e-government in Jordan have also been identified. Keywords—e-government; grounded theory; Jordan; total failure I...|$|R
40|$|For many years, Finland {{has been}} a pioneer in mobile telephony. In order to {{maintain}} this status quo, the Ministry of Transport and Communications has initiated “Mona ” – a mobile services development program. Mona’s purpose is to bring together mobile operators, software developers and companies that apply mobile applications, {{with the aim of}} creating productive conditions for mobile application development in Finland. This report, which focuses on an analysis of the Finnish mobile cluster, {{is one of the first}} concrete results of the Mona program. The goal of the report is to analyze the structure of the Finnish mobile cluster, identify the main drivers and obstacles to the success of mobile services, and assess the competitive potential of Finnish mobile services production. Commissioned by the Ministry of Transport and Communications, this study was carried out by Mr. Ilkka Leppävuori of EPStar Ltd. His previous studies in this area, the cluster analysis report published in autumn 2001 and his Master of Science Thesis at the Tampere University of Technology, form the basis of this report. I wish to express my thanks to <b>the</b> <b>author</b> for <b>conducting</b> <b>this</b> interesting study and hope that it will be of help to industry observers both i...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>authors</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>this</b> {{study to}} {{evaluate}} the efficacy of a health check-up program and the health status of health care workers at Srinagarind Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University. The authors reviewed all yearly-check up charts of personnel who worked at Srinagarind Hospital from 2002 to 2003 including history taking, physical examination, and laboratory testings. There were 606 office workers and 1, 024 nursing staff enrolled. The mean ages of both groups were 38. 9 and 36. 5 years old, respectively. The office workers visited physicians significantly more often than the nursing staff (553 of 606 vs 271 of 1, 024; p-value = 0. 00). Obesity was found much more in office workers (127 of 472 versus 129 of 749). There were {{significant differences between the}} groups on impaired fasting plasma glucose, DM, HT, high cholesterol level, high triglyceride level, and significant elevation of ALT or AST (all p-value = 0. 00). In the obese group, there was also a significantly higher number of cases who had high blood pressure, defined as IFG or DM, high cholesterol level, and high triglyceride level (p-value = 0. 00) except the significant elevation of ALT or AST level. Cases of obesity with significant elevation of hepatic enzyme had many atherosclerotic risk factors. Therefore, metabolic derangements are the important problem for health care workers...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Because {{of limited}} {{reporting}} of HIV status in case {{reports to the}} national tuberculosis (TB) surveillance system, <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>this</b> study to estimate the proportion of US TB cases with HIV co-infection and to describe demographic and clinical characteristics of co-infected patients. METHODS: The 50 states, New York City, and Puerto Rico submitted the results of cross-matches of TB registries and HIV-AIDS registries. The authors determined the number of TB cases reported for 1993 - 1994 that were listed in HIV-AIDS registries and analyzed data on demographic and clinical characteristics by match status. RESULTS: Of 49, 938 TB cases reported for 1993 - 1994, 6863 (14 %) were listed in AIDS or HIV registries. The proportions of TB-AIDS cases among TB cases varied by reporting area, from 0 % to 31 %. Anti-TB drug resistance was higher among TB-AIDS cases, particularly resistance to isoniazid and rifampin (multidrug resistance) and rifampin alone, In some areas with low proportions of multidrug-resistant TB cases, however, the difference in multidrug resistance between TB-AIDS patients and non-AIDS TB patients was not found. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of TB cases with HIV co-infection, particularly in some areas, {{underscores the importance of}} the HIV-AIDS epidemic for the epidemiology of TB. Efforts to improve HIV testing as well as reporting of HIV status for TB patients should continue to ensure optimum management of coinfected patients, enhance surveillance activities, and promote judicious resource allocation and targeted prevention and control activities...|$|E
40|$|Orientation: Women in male-dominated occupations face unique {{challenges}} and use distinct coping strategies affecting their motivation and retention in these occupations. Research purpose: The {{purpose was to}} explore the experiences of women working in maledominated occupations to clarify the challenges they face and identify coping strategies {{that enable them to}} continue on their career paths. Motivation for the study: Many women who choose male-dominated careers soon change in favour of more female-dominated or gender-balanced career paths. An understanding of women’s experiences may facilitate strategies geared towards their motivation and retention in male-dominated occupations. Research design, approach and method: <b>The</b> <b>authors</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>this</b> exploratory qualitative study from a constructivist grounded theory perspective. They used a purposive sample of five women and conducted in-depth unstructured interviews. They analysed data using a constructivist grounded theory methodology. Main findings: The authors found that formal and covert organisational practices, which upheld gender discrimination and bias, were the main challenges that women face. These practices included the inadequate accommodation of women’s unique physical, identity and work-life balance needs. Elements of women’s resilience included the use of femininity, adopting male characteristics, mentorship and intrinsic motivational factors. Practical/managerial implications: The findings may guide organisations to develop and implement policies, strategies and initiatives geared towards attracting, integrating, retaining, supporting and motivating women who are, or wish to be, employed in historically maledominated occupations. Contribution/value-add: This study contributes to an evolving body of knowledge aimed at understanding how to integrate and retain women in male-dominated occupations better...|$|E
40|$|In {{view of the}} {{increasing}} concerns for escalating energy costs, healthier living, and environmental degradation, sustainable building initiatives are being pursued with {{both public and private}} support, although with significant misperceptions. The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify homeowner perceptions of renewable energy sources and to identify the causes of apprehension towards using renewable energy technology in affordable housing. The methodology of this study uses a non-experimental, descriptive designed, random survey. Findings indicate significantly high initial costs for green building technology, such as solar panels, and serve as the primary reason for apprehension toward installing renewable energy systems in homes. However, survey results indicate high preference by homeowners for grants and incentives for green investments. Research limitations include a low sample size and delimitations of a small survey distribution area. The void of perspective research on green affordable housing influenced <b>the</b> <b>author</b> to <b>conduct</b> <b>this</b> study with the intention to bring additional clarity to the subject. The researcher recommends continued support of public incentives for green energy education and technology especially by soliciting the involvement of nonprofit organizations. Cost effective housing, improved health conditions, and environmental awareness are survival points afforded by a transformation of rethinking towards green, sustainable living...|$|R
