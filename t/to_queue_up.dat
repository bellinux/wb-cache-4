5|$|An {{agreement}} was signed with Amadeus in 2007 to upgrade Biman's ticketing system with an e-ticketing solution {{to comply with}} IATA rules, which set out a deadline of 31 December 2007 for all member airlines to switch over their ticketing systems. E-ticketing has enabled major airlines to provide online check-in facilities, reducing the need <b>to</b> <b>queue</b> <b>up</b> at check-in counters. However, Biman has not made any attempts to improve customer service through the adoption of e-ticketing, {{although it has been}} able to reduce its own costs. In 2005, Biman had briefly stopped using the Amadeus ticketing system when the government suspended the operation of a local Amadeus subsidiary following a court order, after allegations of money laundering. The suspension, however, lasted only a month, and was lifted after the writ was appealed in the High Court.|$|E
5|$|The two Ferrari {{cars and}} the Renault of Kubica became the first cars <b>to</b> <b>queue</b> <b>up</b> behind the safety car, {{while the rest of}} the field had enough notice to divert to the pitlane for their first stop. The {{significance}} of these events was that both Vettel and Hamilton were able to make their first stops before their advantage over the rest of the field was cancelled out by catching the safety car, while Alonso, Massa and Kubica fell down the order. Hamilton's stop was for a replacement front wing. The safety car drove into the pit lane at the end of lap 14 and the cars were allowed to overtake. Vettel locked his tyres and ran deep driving into the final turn, and resisted Hamilton's attempt at overtaking him. Alonso immediately pushed hard and passed Hülkenberg for ninth place at turn 17 on the 15th lap. A line of cars formed behind Kobayashi while Vettel and Hamilton pulled away from the rest of the field, as the front two began trading the fastest lap time of the event. Button gained a large amount of top speed but remained behind both Sauber cars. Schumacher passed both Virgin cars to move into the 17th position by lap 17.|$|E

[...] The Manchester Guardian commented, [...] "The audience evidently found it a good entertainment, but Mr. Coward [...] certainly had not flattered our intelligence.

[...] The New Statesman discerned a sad side to the play in its story of a couple who can live neither with nor without each other: [...] "It is not the least of Mr. Coward's achievements that he has ... disguised the grimness of his play and that his conception of love is really desolating." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper designs {{distributed}} dynamic {{traffic signal}} control policies for urban traffic networks. Vehicles {{at the end}} of an approach <b>to</b> an intersection <b>queue</b> <b>up</b> in separate lanes corresponding to different possible turn maneuvers at the upcoming intersection, according to fixed turn ratios. The departure rate of vehicles from the queue is governed by traffic signal control at the intersections. We consider traffic signal control architectures under which, at every intersection, only a subset of non-conflicting approaches get green light simultaneously. We propose a class of cooperative green light policies, under which traffic signal control at an intersection requires information only about the occupancy levels on the lanes incoming at that intersection. In particular, such a policy does not require information about turn ratios, external arrival rates or departure rates. We show that such minimalist policies are maximally stabilizing for acyclic network topologies under some scenarios, and, when the network is stabilizable, the network admits a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium under these policies. Simulations to illustrate the applicability of our results to cyclic network topologies are also presented...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that yard {{operation}} {{is the heart of the}} entire terminal as the efficiency of yard operations determines that of the overall terminal operations. To achieve smooth flow of containers in a yard, yard cranes need to be positioned at the right location at the right time to pickup containers from or load containers onto trucks. This research studies the problem of scheduling a yard crane to perform a given set of container handling jobs with different ready times to minimize the sum of job waiting times. It is shown that the problem is NP-complete. An algorithm is developed to find a lower bound for the optimal solution of the scheduling problem and genetic algorithm (GA) approach is proposed to find an effective yard crane schedule. Five popular crossover schemes are considered in this paper. The performance of GA with the five crossover schemes are evaluated on a comprehensive set of test problems which are randomly generated based on realistic yard operations data. The computational results show that the GA approach can indeed find effective solutions for the scheduling problem. Significance: The current practice of scheduling yard came in port container terminals often lead <b>to</b> trucks <b>queuing</b> <b>up</b> at yard blocks. The paper proposes to use GA approach to find an effective yard crane schedule to reduce the sum of truck waiting times. © INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
