5|$|At the {{beginning}} of World War I in 1914, Dr. Robert Heindl of Germany had noted that the 15,000 political prisoners at <b>the</b> <b>penal</b> colony could create an undesirable revolution and therefore their release in one stage, following capture of the island by a German ship by bombardment, was risky. He suggested that after due care and adequate security had {{been put in place}} the convicts of <b>the</b> <b>penal</b> colony could be shifted to the mainland in small boats.|$|E

5|$|Following the French Revolution in 1789, {{the cause}} of republicanism was taken up in many countries, {{including}} the Kingdom of Ireland, at that time ruled by the Kingdom of Great Britain. Opposition to British rule had existed in Ireland for centuries, but the French example, combined with the imposition of <b>the</b> <b>Penal</b> Laws which discriminated against the Catholic majority and a large Presbyterian minority, prompted {{the creation of the}} Society of United Irishmen, a broad non-sectarian coalition of groups seeking to create an Irish Republic. Initially a non-violent political movement, the United Irishmen were forced to operate as a secret society after membership was made illegal in 1793 at the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars. Deciding that their only hope of creating the Irish Republic lay in armed revolt, the United Irishmen began secretly organising and arming their forces. In search of external aid, two of their leaders, Lord Edward FitzGerald and Arthur O'Connor travelled to Basle to meet with French General Lazare Hoche. Their efforts were supported by Protestant Dublin lawyer Theobald Wolfe Tone, who travelled to Paris to appeal to the French Directory in person. During this period, the British government repealed some of <b>the</b> <b>Penal</b> Laws, in an attempt to quell unrest.|$|E
