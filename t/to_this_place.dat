25|$|This {{pleasant}} climate {{has attracted}} royalty and nobles since Aztec times. Most of the Aztec emperors called Cuernavaca their summer residence. Foreign princes, archdukes and other nobles have been attracted <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>place</b> {{because of its}} flowers, sun, fruits, fresh-water springs and waterfalls. Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico set up a country residence in the city. Philanthropist Barbara Hutton, who held several royal titles through marriage, had {{a home in the}} city. The Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, lived in exile in the city following the Iranian Revolution. Although a native of the U.S., Bauhaus designer Michael van Beuren established his residence in a family hacienda in Cuernavaca while fleeing the rise of the Nazi regime in Germany (where he studied and practiced his profession), and a colony of Bauhaus designers grew in the city during World War II.|$|E
25|$|The Franciscans had a {{profound}} effect on the local population, installing the annual celebrations for the Culto do Divino Espírito Santo (Cult of the Holy Spirit), and becoming responsible for the education of the local community. Offering many courses, including Latin, it was their system that became the basis for the reforms in the post-Pomboline national educational system. But, after lasting briefly, those educators abandoned the island and the Franciscans returned to their place in São Boaventura. During the early transition between Franciscan and public systems, Father José António Camões, was important in his functions (between 1797 and 1807) exercising his role as the only grammar teacher on the island. He returned <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>place</b> in 1815, where he continued until 1827 in this capacity. Santa Cruz remained the only educational centre in the Western Group of Azorean islands, until the middle of the 19th century; it consolidated its position, forcing the local population to send their children to live in the regional capital in order to obtain an education. The convent, whose chief benefactor was Father Maurício António de Freitas, promoter of the religious foundation Externato da Imaculada Conceição, was also the primary establishment to provide post-secondary education after the fall of the religious orders. The nucleus of post-secondary education began in October 1959, in the home of the poet Roberto de Mesquita, until it was moved, much later, to the Convent of São Boaventura where it was transformed into a public institution.|$|E

500|$|... "Back from Vacation" [...] {{was written}} by Justin Spitzer, a staff writer who joined The Office in its third season. The episode was his first script for the series. Spitzer found Jan's final scene with Michael– in which he expects she will yell at him for their {{circulated}} picture but instead informs him they are staying together– especially tricky to write. Spitzer was unsure how to craft the scene, and eventually requested advice from the other series' writers. They decided that Jan would give a [...] "psychobabble" [...] response to Michael. Sitting on a panel of television writers at Northwestern University, Spitzer briefly described her reasoning, [...] "Jan’s nuts. She has some bad psychiatrist giving her bad advice." [...] He praised {{the benefits of a}} [...] "good writers room," [...] in which [...] "scenes go <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>place</b> you never could have gone to alone." ...|$|E
500|$|As noted before, {{the monastery}} was {{built around the}} Taktsang Senge Samdup (stag tshang seng ge bsam grub) cave, where custom holds that the Indian Guru Padmasambahva meditated in the 8th century. He flew <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>place</b> from Tibet {{on the back of}} Yeshe Tsogyal, whom he {{transformed}} into a flying tigress for the purpose and landed at the cliff, which he [...] "anointed" [...] as the place for building a monastery. He established Buddhism and the Nyingmapa school of Mahayana Buddhism in Bhutan, and has been considered the “protector saint of Bhutan”. Later, Padmasmbahva visited Bumthang district to subdue a powerful deity offended by a local king. Padmasambhava's body imprint is stated to be imprinted on the wall of a cave near Kurje Lhakhang temple. In 853, Langchen Pelkyi Singye came to the cave to meditate and gave his name of Pelphug to the cave, [...] "Pelkyi's cave". After he died later in Nepal, his body was said to have been miraculously returned to the monastery by the grace of the deity Dorje Legpa; it is now said to be sealed in a chorten in a room to the left {{at the top of the}} entrance stairway. The chorten was restored in 1982-83 and again in 2004.|$|E
500|$|Puri, {{the holy}} land of Lord Jagannatha, also known by the popular vernacular name Shrikhetra, has many ancient names in the Hindu scriptures such as the Rigveda, Matsya purana, Brahma Purana, Narada Purana, Padma Purana, Skanda Purana, Kapila Purana and Niladrimahodaya. In the Rigveda, in particular, it is {{mentioned}} as a place called Purushamandama-grama meaning {{the place where the}} Creator deity of the world – Supreme Divinity deified on an altar or mandapa was venerated near the coast and prayers offered with Vedic hymns. Over time the name got changed to Purushottama Puri and further shortened to Puri, and the Purusha {{came to be known as}} Jagannatha. Sages like Bhrigu, Atri and Markandeya had their hermitage close <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>place.</b> Its name is mentioned, conforming to the deity worshipped, as Srikshetra, Purusottama Dhāma, Purusottama Kshetra, Purusottama Puri and Jagannath Puri. Puri, however, is the popular usage. It is also known by the geographical features of its location as Shankhakshetra (the layout of the town is in the form of a conch shell), Neelāchala ("Blue mountain" [...] a terminology used to name a very large sand lagoon over which the temple was built but this name is not in vogue), Neelāchalakshetra, Neelādri. In Sanskrit, the word [...] "Puri" [...] means town or city, and is cognate with polis in Greek.|$|E

500|$|Prince Albert Victor died in 1892, but society {{gossip about}} his sex life continued. Sixty {{years after the}} scandal the {{official}} biographer of King George V, Harold Nicolson, was told by Lord Goddard, who was a twelve-year-old schoolboy {{at the time of}} the scandal, that Prince Albert Victor [...] "had been involved in a male brothel scene, and that a solicitor had to commit perjury to clear him. The solicitor was struck off the rolls for his offence, but was thereafter reinstated." [...] In fact, none of the lawyers involved in the case was convicted of perjury or struck off at the time, indeed most had very distinguished careers. However, Arthur Newton was struck off for 12 months for professional misconduct in 1910 after falsifying letters from another of his clients—the notorious murderer Harvey Crippen. In 1913, he was struck off indefinitely and sentenced to three years' imprisonment for obtaining money by false pretences. Newton may have invented and spread the rumours about Prince Albert Victor in an attempt to protect his clients from prosecution by forcing a cover-up. State papers on the case in the Public Record Office, released to the public in the 1970s, provide no information on the prince's involvement other than Newton's threat to implicate him. Hamilton Cuffe wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions, Sir Augustus Stephenson, [...] "I am told that Newton has boasted that if we go on a very distinguished person will be involved (PAV). I don't mean to say that I for one instant credit it—but in such circumstances as this one never knows what may be said, be concocted or be true." [...] Surviving private letters from Somerset to his friend Lord Esher, confirm that Somerset knew of the rumours but did not know if they were true. He writes, [...] "I can quite understand the Prince of Wales being much annoyed at his son's name being coupled with the thing... we were both accused of going <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>place</b> but not together... I wonder if it is really a fact or only an invention." [...] In his correspondence, Sir Dighton Probyn refers to [...] "cruel and unjust rumours with regard to PAV" [...] and [...] "false reports dragging PAV's name into the sad story". When Prince Albert Victor's name appeared in the American press, the New York Herald published an anonymous letter, almost certainly written by Charles Hall, saying [...] "there is not, and never was, the slightest excuse for mentioning the name of Prince Albert Victor." [...] Biographers who believe the rumours suppose that Prince Albert Victor was bisexual, but this is strongly contested by others who refer to him as [...] "ardently heterosexual" [...] and his involvement in the rumours as [...] "somewhat unfair".|$|E
