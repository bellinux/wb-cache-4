5|$|After the 1896 launch {{was called}} off, enthusiasm {{declined}} for joining the expedition {{for a second}} attempt in 1897. From the candidates Andrée picked the 27-year-old engineer, Knut Frænkel, to replace Ekholm. Frænkel was a civil engineer from the north of Sweden, an athlete who was fond of long mountain hikes. He was enrolled specifically to take over Ekholm's meteorological observations. Despite lacking Ekholm's theoretical and scientific knowledge, he handled this task efficiently. His meteorological journal has enabled researchers to reconstruct <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three men during their last few months with considerable precision.|$|E

5|$|The Dresden Codex {{contains}} accurate astronomical tables, {{which are}} recognized by {{students of the}} codex for its detailed Venus tables and lunar tables. The lunar series has intervals correlating with eclipses, while the Venus tables correlate with <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planet Venus. The codex also contains astrological tables and ritual schedules. The religious references show in a cycle of a 260-day ritual calendar the important Maya royal events. The codex also includes information on the Maya new-year ceremony tradition. The rain god Chaac is represented 134 times.|$|E

5|$|Also bird banding. The {{attachment}} of a small, individually numbered {{metal or}} plastic tag to the leg or wing {{of a wild}} bird to enable individual identification. This helps in keeping track of <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bird and its life history. Upon capture for ringing, {{it is common to}} take measurements and examine the conditions of feather , amount of subcutaneous fat, age indications and sex. The subsequent recapture or recovery of the bird can provide information on migration, longevity, mortality, population, territoriality, feeding behaviour and other aspects that are studied by ornithologists. Bird ringing is the term used in the UK and in some other parts of Europe; while the term bird banding is more often used in the U.S. and Australia.|$|E
5|$|At 10p.m. on March 5, the Mexican {{artillery}} ceased their bombardment. As Santa Anna had anticipated, {{the exhausted}} Texians soon {{fell into the}} first uninterrupted sleep {{many of them had}} since the siege began. Just after midnight, more than 2,000 Mexican soldiers began preparing for the final assault. Fewer than 1,800 were divided into four columns, commanded by Cos, Colonel Francisco Duque, Colonel José María Romero and Colonel Juan Morales. Veterans were positioned {{on the outside of the}} columns to better control the new recruits and conscripts in the middle. As a precaution, 500 Mexican cavalry were positioned around the Alamo to prevent escape of either Texian or Mexican soldiers. Santa Anna remained in camp with the 400 reserves. Despite the bitter cold, the soldiers were ordered not to wear overcoats which could impede their movements. Clouds concealed the moon and thus <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soldiers.|$|E
5|$|By 1798 the British Royal Navy had {{successfully}} contained the French Navy {{within its own}} harbours, employing a strategy of close blockade to ensure dominance at sea during the French Revolutionary Wars. The strategy was particularly effective in the English Channel, where the proximity of British bases and the importance in limiting <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French invasion forces stationed around Boulogne focused British attention on the Normandy coast. This was essential to prevent the concentration of a large force of invasion barges that had been constructed at various harbours {{under the guidance of}} a Captain Muskein. To improve the Royal Navy's ability to observe French movements on the Normandy coast, a force under the command of Captain Sir Sidney Smith seized, garrisoned, and fortified the uninhabited Îles Saint-Marcouf in 1795.|$|E

The resulting double team then reacts to <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> linemen as well as <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> linebacker. <b>The</b> initial <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> double teams helps to equalize defensive talent and creates cutback lanes.|$|R
50|$|A {{prominent}} example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> classical three-body {{problem is}} <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> a planet with a satellite around a star. In most cases {{such a system}} can be factorized, considering <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complex system (planet and satellite) around a star as a single particle; then, considering <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> satellite around the planet, neglecting <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> around <b>the</b> star. In this case, the problem is simplified to two instances <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two-body problem. However, <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> star on <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> satellite around the planet {{can be considered as}} a perturbation.|$|R
5|$|Captain San Pedro {{detected}} <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American {{troops from}} his positions {{on a nearby}} hill and ordered his men to open fire. Garretson then ordered a direct attack on the Spanish and Puerto Rican forces in the hacienda. At day break, the 6th Massachusetts overran the Spanish forces and suffered four casualties. Puig was expecting reinforcements from Yauco which did not arrive and was ordered to disengage and retreat. Before retreating {{the right wing of}} the Spanish force, which was not overrun, initiated a flanking attack against two positions held by the Illinois and Massachusetts companies. The unexpected strength of the Spanish force caused some of the 6th Massachusetts troops to momentarily panic, but the Spanish forces were eventually driven off. Puig and his forces suffered two officers and three soldiers wounded and two soldiers dead.|$|E
5|$|Damage to nerves III, IV, or VI {{may affect}} the {{movement}} of the eyeball (globe). Both or one eye may be affected; in either case double vision (diplopia) will likely occur because <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eyes are no longer synchronized. Nerves III, IV and VI are tested by observing how the eye follows an object in different directions. This object may be a finger or a pin, and may be moved at different directions to test for pursuit velocity. If the eyes do not work together, the most likely cause is damage to a specific cranial nerve or its nuclei.|$|E
5|$|During the French Revolutionary Wars, {{he fought}} with {{distinction}} {{again for the}} First Coalition, particularly at Ketsch and Frœschwiller, and in 1796 at Emmendingen, Schliengen and Kehl. He was stationed at key points to protect <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Austrian army. With a force of 10,000, he defended the German Rhineland at Kehl, and reversed a bayonet assault by French troops at Bellheim; his troops also overran Speyer without any losses. By {{the end of the}} War of the First Coalition, at the age of 35, he had achieved the rank of Field Marshal. During the War of the Second Coalition, he fought in the first two battles of the German campaign, at Ostrach on 21 March 1799, and at Stockach on 25 March 1799. At the latter action while leading a regiment of grenadiers, he was hit by French case shot and knocked off his horse. He died shortly afterward.|$|E

5|$|French {{military}} planners had to balance competing demands for the 1781 campaign. After the unsuccessful American attempts of co-operation leading to failed assaults at Rhode Island and Savannah, they realised more {{active participation in}} North America was needed. However, they also needed to co-ordinate their actions with Spain, where there was potential interest in making {{an assault on the}} British stronghold of Jamaica. It turned out that the Spanish were not interested in operations agaynst Jamaica until after they had dealt with an expected British attempt to reinforce besieged Gibraltar, and merely wanted to be informed of <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West Indies fleet.|$|E
5|$|Guevara grows {{sick and}} by Day 280 can barely breathe {{as a result}} of his acute asthma. Nevertheless, he {{continues}} to lead his group towards the other column of revolutionaries. On Day 302, the Bolivian Army wipes out the other column, killing Tania Bunke, Juan Acuña Ñunez, and several others in an ambush as they attempt to cross the Vado del Yeso after a local informant tells the Bolivian troops about <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rebels. By Day 340, Guevara is trapped by the Bolivian Army in the Yuro Ravine near the village of La Higuera. Che is wounded and captured. The next day, a helicopter lands and Cuban American CIA agent Félix Rodríguez emerges to interrogate Che, but without success. The Bolivian high command then phones and orders Guevara's execution. He is shot on 9 October 1967, and his corpse lashed to a helicopter's landing skids and flown out.|$|E
5|$|In {{the seventh}} century, Isidore of Seville argued in his Etymologiae that {{astronomy}} described <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heavens, while astrology had two parts: one was scientific, describing <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sun, {{the moon and}} the stars, while the other, making predictions, was theologically erroneous. In contrast, John Gower in the fourteenth century defined astrology as essentially limited to the making of predictions. The influence of the stars was in turn divided into natural astrology, with for example effects on tides and the growth of plants, and judicial astrology, with supposedly predictable effects on people. The fourteenth century sceptic Nicole Oresme however included astronomy as a part of astrology in his Livre de divinacions. Oresme argued that current approaches to prediction of events such as plagues, wars, and weather were inappropriate, but that such prediction was a valid field of inquiry. However, he attacked the use of astrology to choose the timing of actions (so-called interrogation and election) as wholly false, and rejected the determination of human action by the stars on grounds of free will. The friar Laurens Pignon (c. 1368–1449) similarly rejected all forms of divination and determinism, including by the stars, in his 1411 Contre les Devineurs. This was in opposition to the tradition carried by the Arab astronomer Albumasar (787-886) whose Introductorium in Astronomiam and De Magnis Coniunctionibus argued the view that both individual actions and larger scale history are determined by the stars.|$|E

5|$|Success was {{forthcoming}} in 1942. Later, in February 1942, Coastal Command {{identified the}} Luftwaffe Würzburg radar sets in France. Eager to evaluate them, the British Army carried out Operation Biting, a commando raid to capture, dismantle and transport {{an example of}} the mobile radar to Britain. The force increased to 70 aircraft in eight flights as the year progressed. Operations were carried out in the Atlantic, over Scandinavia, the North Sea, and the Baltic Sea. In November, PR units operated from Gibraltar in support of Operation Torch, the Allied landing in French North Africa. It was detailed to keep watch on <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vichy French Fleet at Toulon, France. One of the most active squadrons at this time operated Spitfires.

5|$|The Allies {{marched in}} normal order in two main columns, {{the first line}} on the left, the second line on the right; farther to the right, though, marched a column {{consisting}} of the foot reserve, and {{between the first and}} second lines trundled the reserve artillery. The right wing cavalry advanced at the head and the left wing cavalry at the tail of the two main columns. Noting some Prussian movement, Soubise ordered a wheeling pivot to the east, a complicated maneuver under parade-ground conditions, and difficult in the field, with troops unfamiliar with each other, on uneven terrain. At first, the columns retained regulation distance, wheeling eastward toward Zeuchfeld, but then part of the reserve infantry moved between the two main columns, hampering <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reserve artillery. In addition, the troops on the outer flank of the wheel found themselves unable to keep up with the overly rapid movement of the inner pivot.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} game {{incorporating}} graphics that updated in real time, rather than {{only when the}} player made a move, was a pool game programmed by William Brown and Ted Lewis specifically for {{a demonstration of the}} University of Michigan-developed MIDSAC computer at the University of Michigan in 1954.

The computer calculated <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> balls as they collided and moved around the table, disappearing when they reached a pocket, and updated the graphics continuously, forty times a second, so as to show real-time motion.
