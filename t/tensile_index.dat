40|$|AbstractThermomechanical pulp (TMP) fibers, {{generally}} used {{to produce}} newspapers and carton materials, have poor inter- and intra-fiber bonding contributing to low strength properties. Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVOH) was applied as a co-additive of 1, 2, 3, 4 -butanetetracarboxylic acid (BTCA), {{in the presence of}} sodium hypophosphite (SHP) as a catalyst, to esterify paper sheets based on TMP fibers. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy technique was used to confirm the formation of the ester bond. The effects of curing temperature, molar mass and mass amount of the PVOH on the <b>tensile</b> <b>index</b> were investigated. The increasing of the curing temperature improved further the wet <b>tensile</b> <b>index.</b> The presence of PVOH increased both the dry and the wet <b>tensile</b> <b>index</b> of the paper sheets.

40|$|The joint {{strength}} between single fibres and {{its influence}} on strength properties of papers was evaluated, {{taking into account the}} effect of pulp yield, ionic form of the carboxyl groups and drying. Fibre/fibre joint strength stayed almost constant for pulps with yield between 45 % and 50 %. Further increasing the pulp yield increased the joint strength until a maximum value was reached at a pulp yield of 57 %, after which the joint strength decreased. Joint strength correlated well to paper tensile strength for never dried fibres, i. e. a lower joint strength resulted in lower sheet <b>tensile</b> <b>index.</b> The decrease in sheet <b>tensile</b> <b>index</b> was not as pronounced as the decrease in joint strength. Changing counter-ion from Na+ to Ca 2 + or H+ did not affect fibre flexibility, although it reduced the joint strength as the molecular contact area decreased due to a reduced swelling upon changing the counter-ions. Drying the high yield pulp lowered both the joint strength and the sheet <b>tensile</b> <b>index</b> to the same extent. The sheet <b>tensile</b> <b>index,</b> for the low yield pulp, decreased much more than the fibre/fibre joint strength after drying the fibres. In conclusion, a combination of a lower fibre flexibility, resulting in fewer contact points between fibres in the sheet, and a lower joint strength after drying was responsible for the reduction in sheet <b>tensile</b> <b>index...</b>|$|E

30|$|From the {{observation}} of fiber morphology, no significant changes were noticed in the fiber length while the fines content was decreased by the xylanase-pretreatment of the pulp. The lower fines content led to the higher numeric average of fiber length and thus the paper strength was enhanced (Liu et al. 2012). In general, the strength of paper {{is influenced by the}} fiber morphology which can be adversely affected by the kink and curl of fibers (Page 1969). However, in this study, the paper strength, in terms of the tear and <b>tensile</b> <b>indexes,</b> increased along with the curl and kink indexes of the fibers after xylanase pretreatment. This {{may be due to the}} digested fibers becoming more flexible, thus the moderate curl of the fibers could enhance the interweaving between them which led to the strengthened bonding between the pulp fibers (Liu et al. 2012) These results clearly indicated that the crude xylanase from A. pullulans CBS 135684 had potential for treatment of rice straw before bleaching for paper manufacture since it significantly improved the paper brightness without compromising fiber quality.|$|R

Five commercial mechanical pulps (three TMP grades, one SGW and one CTMP) were fractionated into five streams in a hydrocyclone pilot plant. Fiber dimensions and fibrillation were analyzed of the P 16 /R 30 and P 30 /R 50 fractions and {{compared to the}} sheet properties. For comparison, samples were also analyzed by SEM cross-sectional image analysis and in a MorFi Lab optical analyzer.

The main objective of this study is to examine the quality of wood and pulp from a clone of Eucalyptus grandis, at age 4 years approximately, planted in three different soils, two of which being low fertility and one being a superior fertility soil, and their reflections on wood quality and pulping results. Chemical analyses of the soils followed guidelines developed by Raij et al. (2001), while physical and chemical properties of the wood followed ABTCP, TAPPI and ABNT standards.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{pressurised}} compressive chip pre-treatment and low dosage sulphite pre-treatment were evaluated for production of thermomechanical pulp in mill scale trials using Norway spruce (Picea abies) at the Braviken paper mill (Holmen Paper AB, Sweden). The general {{aim of the}} study was to improve the energy efficiency during the production of mechanical pulps suitable for news and improved news grade papers. The pressurised compressive chip pre-treatment performed in an Impressafiner, resulted in a reduced acetone extractive content for first stage blow line pulp by up to 24 %. Furthermore, pulp produced from mechanically pre-treated chips had higher tensile- and tear indices, elongation and light scattering and lower freeness compared to pulps from untreated chips produced with equal total specific energy consumption. The total specific energy consumption was reduced by 120 kWh/bone dry ton (6 %) at equal <b>tensile</b> <b>index,</b> when pulps were produced together with the Impressafiner pre-treatment. Sulphite pre-treatment increased <b>tensile</b> <b>index,</b> elongation, density and brightness and reduced light scattering and shive content compared to pulps produced with only mechanical pre-treatment at equal specific energy consumption. The increase in <b>tensile</b> <b>index</b> and reduction in light scattering followed linear relations to the dosage of sodium sulphite in the measured dosage range (0 - 1. 2 % Na 2 SO 3). The addition of ~ 1. 2 % sodium sulphite gave a sulphur content in pulp of ~ 0. 67 % (as Na 2 SO 3) and reduced the specific energy consumption by 210 - 320 kWh/bdt (12 - 15 %) when compared at equal <b>tensile</b> <b>index.</b> However, light scattering was not retained for this energy reduction. Further analyses showed that sulphite pre-treatment did not significantly affect the distribution of the Bauer-McNett fractions or the fibre length for pulps refined with equal specific energy consumption but did increase fibre delamination/internal fibrillation as measured by Fernando and Daniel’s (2010) version of Simons’ staining. The specific energy consumption for pulps produced with sulphite pre-treatment (1. 2 % Na 2 SO 3) and double disc refining were 650 kWh/bdt (30 %) lower than for pulps produced in a two stage single disc refiner line (no pre-treatment), when compared at a similar <b>tensile</b> <b>index</b> and light scattering coefficient...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{electric}} energy efficiency of single stage double disc refining for production of printing grade mechanical pulp from Norway spruce wood chips. The thesis {{is based on the}} hypothesis, that more energy efficiency refining can be attained by balanced increases of wood softening and refining intensity. Five mill scale trials were performed where wood softening and refining intensity was varied by applying or changing the following process parameters and variables: Chip pretreatment/impregnation with water Low dosages of sodium sulfite (Na 2 SO 3) added to impregnation Temperature and retention time in the atmospheric preheater bin Refining temperature (housing pressure) Feeding segment design combined with increased production rate By combining suitable increases in wood softening and refining intensity, it was possible to reduce the specific electric energy consumption in refining by 15 % (~ 290 kWh per bone dry ton (bdt)) while preserving important pulp properties within ± 5 %, compared to the standard double disc refining process. This was done by combining chip impregnation, using an addition of 0. 36 % (on bone dry basis) sodium sulfite, with a new feeding segment design which enabled 25 % higher production rate. When using the new feeding segment design at an increased production rate at unchanged wood softening, it led to reduced fiber length and increased sheet light scattering coefficient at certain <b>tensile</b> <b>index,</b> compared with the standard segment design at normal production rate. This is consistent with the effects normally seen when the refining intensity is increasing. The specific electric energy consumption was 8 % lower at a <b>tensile</b> <b>index</b> of 43. 5 Nm/g (on Rapid Köthen laboratory sheets) compared to refining at lower intensity using the standard segment design at normal production rate. Mechanical chip pretreatment with subsequent water impregnation showed a reduction in specific electric energy consumption of 6 % (~ 120 kWh/bdt). When chip impregnation was applied in a later trial with a milder chip compression, it led to increased wood softening seen as better preserved fiber length and reduced light scattering coefficient. This resulted in a reduction in <b>tensile</b> <b>index</b> at certain specific electric energy consumption when applied with the standard refining condition but to an increase in <b>tensile</b> <b>index</b> when applied with refining at higher intensity using the feeding segment design at higher production rate. An addition of 1. 2 % sodium sulfite during impregnation led to a sulfonate content of pulps of ~ 0. 28 % (as Na 2 SO 3 equivalents, including post sulfonation) and an average increase in <b>tensile</b> <b>index</b> of about 8. 3 Nm/g, when compared to unsulfonated pulps at certain specific electric energy consumption. The increase in <b>tensile</b> <b>index</b> correlated with increased delamination and internal fibrillation of fibers (measured by Simon’s staining), which indicate that the increase in <b>tensile</b> <b>index</b> for sulfonated pulps was a result of improved fiber flexibility and collapsibility. The reduction in disc gap at certain specific electric energy consumption in refining due to an increased wood softening after sulfonation may explain the increase in delamination and internal fibrillation for sulfonated pulps. The smaller disc gap probably led to a more intense refining, i. e. loading at higher deformation rates due to a higher degree of deformation in bar crossings. Different temperatures (80 vs. 97 °C) and retention times (6 vs. 9 min.) in the atmospheric preheater bin were studied. This showed that the lower temperature and shorter retention time was beneficial for the tensile strength and light scattering of pulp when applying low dosage sodium sulfite pretreatment. This was most likely a result of too high degree of wood softening prior to defibration in the breaker bar zone when combining low dosage sodium sulfite pretreatment with the higher preheating bin temperature at longer retention time. Different refining temperatures (4. 6 and 6. 4 bar(g) refiner housing pressure) were evaluated both without and with low additions (0. 6 % and 1. 2 %) of sodium sulfite. Raising the refining temperature increased <b>tensile</b> <b>index</b> by 3. 2 Nm/g and the addition of 1. 2 % sodium sulfite by 8. 6 Nm/g. The combined increase (~ 12 Nm/g) was similar to the effect of increasing the specific electric energy consumption by 380 kWh/bdt, when comparing pulps at equal <b>tensile</b> <b>index.</b> However, the pulps produced with increased refining temperature and sodium sulfite addition had lower light scattering coefficient at certain <b>tensile</b> <b>index.</b> The combination of increased refining temperature and addition of 0. 6 % sodium sulfite was interesting and resulted in pulp with higher <b>tensile</b> <b>index,</b> light scattering coefficient and brightness together with lower shives content at certain specific electric energy consumption, compared with pulp produced at the lower refining temperature without addition of sodium sulfite. Finally, an implementation of the technology presented here is discussed in relation to the Braviken mill (Holmen Paper AB, Norrköping, Sweden) concerning reduction in electric energy consumption and steam recovery. The technology has potential to reduce the electrical energy use by ~ 100 GWh/year at the Braviken paper mill, where this study was performed.

Significant height effects were found with all wood properties, and also with tear <b>index,</b> zero span <b>tensile</b> strength and opacity. • Discriminant analysis showed that for 76 out of 100 handsheets the raw material source, i. e. growth site, could be predicted correctly using a set of handsheet properties with tear index and bulk index being most prominent. • This is unique evidence that site conditions are strongly reflected in handsheet properties produced from Eucalyptus pulp. eucalypt / wood quality / fibre length / pulp / paper Résumé – Effet du site sur les propriétés des fibres, de la pâte et des feuilles d’essai d’Eucalyptus globulus. • Nous avons échantillonné des arbres de huit ans de deux clones d’Eucalyptus globulus Labill., sur trois sites différents de Tasmanie en Australie, pour analyser les propriétés du bois et les propriétés papetières...|$|R
30|$|In this work, paper {{prepared}} from {{cotton fibers}} {{was treated with}} a NaOH-thiourea-urea aqueous solution to provide high wet strength. Effects of alkali concentration, soaking time, cooling temperature, cooling time, and washing time were evaluated by single-factor experiments. Analysis by FT-IR, XRD, TGA, and SEM {{was used to examine}} differences of microscale properties between treated and untreated papers. The optimal conditions were determined to be an alkali concentration of 6 %, a soaking time of 2  s, a cooling temperature of −[*] 6  °C, a cooling time of 10  min, and a washing time of 15  min. These optimal conditions increased dry <b>tensile</b> <b>index</b> of the treated paper by 84 %, dry burst index by 368 %, wet <b>tensile</b> <b>index</b> by 380 %, and wet burst index by 1150 % as compared to untreated paper. There were no significant changes of thermostability, structure of the functional groups, and crystallinity; however, the paper surface morphology changed significantly.|$|E
40|$|It {{is shown}} in this paper that {{knowledge}} of the spatially measured temperatures inside the refining zone in TMP refiners is essential in describing non-linear dynamics of high consistency refining. By expanding the pulp and handsheet properties using piece-wise linear functions into the time domain, an auto-regressive model {{can be applied to}} verify that the tempera-ture and the consistency profiles, in combination with the motor load and production rate, are key input candidates when modeling changes in different pulp properties. The model accuracy is analyzed using process information captured at different time and operating conditions. It is also shown that it is more complex to estimate and validate the <b>tensile</b> <b>index</b> than the mean fiber length and Somerville shives content, especially close to refiner operating limits where a shift in the process gain may occur. This type of switched dynamics in <b>tensile</b> <b>index</b> estimation at a specific consistency is related to non-linear behaviors where the fiber pad distribution most likely undergoes a local collapse...|$|E
40|$|As a vital {{component}} in the strive towards improved energy efficiency {{in the operation of}} TMP refining processes, this work highlights the importance of well-designed procedures when collecting and analysing pulp properties with respect to process conditions. Process data and pulp from a CD 82 chip refiner have been used to show that <b>tensile</b> <b>index</b> has strong covariance with fibre residence time calculated by the extended entropy model. A combination of theoretical and practical analysis methods has shown that, in order to assure representative, reliable results, pulp sampling procedures should comprise composite pulp samples collected during a sampling period of about three minutes. In addition, at least four subsequently collected composite pulp samples {{should be included in the}} analysis to effectively dampen effects from fast process variations as well as from slow process drift. An in-depth study on <b>tensile</b> <b>index</b> measurements clarifies that 40 - 60 strips should be used in the case we studied regardless if machine made paper or handsheets are considered...|$|E
40|$|The {{paper and}} {{paperboard}} industry in Malaysia grew from 1. 6 % to 35 % from 1993 to 2000. The growth highlights {{the potential of}} using the 26. 2 millions tonnes of oil palm frond (OPF) for pulp and paper production. The {{research has indicated that}} the chemical composition of OPF fibers lie between that of hardwoods and that of straws and grasses. OPF fibers can easily be pulped using the chemical process, producing pulp and paper of better properties than most hardwoods pulps. This research also highlights the beating effect in terms of the fiber morphology, paper strength and properties. A P. F. I Mill used to beat the OPF pulps. The beaten pulp was made into fiber network for morphological measurements and the stocks were tested for freeness and drainage time. Handsheets were made from pulp samples taken at different times during the beating process and standard physical test were carried out to give refining curves. The fiber length and diameter decrease with the degree of beating cause of the fragmentation. The soda pulp also gives the effect on drainage time which is increasing with the degree of beating. The content stock freeness (CSF) is decrease with the degree of beating cause of increasing the surface area to absorb water of fine fiber. The high degrees of beating give the strength paper which showed in burst and <b>tensile</b> <b>indices.</b> The study showed that beating effect of soda-AQ pulp produced pulp with different fiber morphology, strength and paper properties...|$|R
40|$|Surface sizing {{of paper}} by anionic starch were carried out {{with the aim of}} its {{concentration}} effect on physical and strength properties of recycled paper. For this, hand sheets (100 GSM) of mixed recycled pulp containing 1 % cationic starch were prepared and were treated by the sizing agent on the sheet surface at various concentration (0, 3 - 10 %). Application and concentration increment of the starch solution caused its higher retention on the surface and lesser penetration into the paper structure (Z direction), contributed to the better hydrophobicity of sized paper and significantly reduction in water absorption of the paper, with the highest reduction in the Cobb test up to the solution concentration of 5 %. Also, the results revealed that regarding to absorption and its increment into the paper surface combined to penetration to the paper thickness, strength properties of bending stiffness, burst and <b>tensile</b> <b>indices</b> have been increased which the improvement rate were more predominant up to the 5 % cons. Penetration of a part of sizing agent into the porous structure of paper and resulted improvement in fiber bonding are possible and probable, that higher concentration and viscosity of the starch solution contributed to the lesser penetration and bonding formation with higher retention on the paper surface which resulted in continuous improvement in paper smoothness. With the sizing solution thickening, tear index decreased due to starch film formation on the paper surface with brittle character. In general, increasing of the anionic starch solution up to the 5 % could be reported as an optimum level...|$|R
