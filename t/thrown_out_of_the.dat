He had therefore made Il Lombardia a significant target. Nibali had performed strongly in the other late-season Italian classics, while his team had shown its strength in supporting Diego Rosa to victory in Milano–Torino.

5|$|He {{was arrested}} on 10 October 1990 on charges {{relating}} to kidnapping and extortion. The charges alleged an extortion scheme that involved tying a supposed bomb to a British businessman's leg. The Bhutto family considered the indictment politically motivated and fabricated. In the October 1990 elections, {{he was elected to}} the National Assembly while in jail. Bhutto and the PPP staged a walkout from the inaugural session of the National Assembly to protest Zardari's incarceration. He posted $20,000 bail, but his release was blocked by a government ordinance that removed a court's power to release suspects being tried in the terrorist court, which fast-track trials for alleged terrorists. The ordinance was later revoked and a special court acquitted him of bank fraud and conspiracy to murder political opponents. He was freed in February 1993. In March 1994, Zardari was acquitted of bank fraud charges. All other corruption charges relating to Bhutto's first term were dropped or <b>thrown</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> courts.|$|E

50|$|In {{his playing}} days, Pérez was {{regarded}} by his versatility to play both outfield corners and first base. A solid average defender {{with a strong}} throwing arm, he showed good footwork around first base {{and was able to}} pick <b>throws</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dirt well. Strictly a line-drive hitter with little power, he placed more emphasis on speed and running the bases aggressively.|$|R

5|$|His {{basketball}} {{performance in}} high school was unimpressive. He came off the bench to average four points per game (ppg). His stepmother informed him that when he graduated high school he would be <b>thrown</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house. Chris {{had been able to}} leave home on a football scholarship and would later play in the National Football League, but Washington himself had nowhere to go. He trained for three hours a day {{toward the end of his}} senior season, and showed up uninvited at a playground game featuring top high school players from Washington and Pennsylvania, where he talked his way into the game. Tom Young, who had recently left his job as an assistant coach at Maryland University to become head coach at American University, saw him play there, and although Washington did not perform particularly well, Young was impressed by his hustle and how he ignored the poor treatment he received from the people who organized the game.|$|E
5|$|Jemima {{tells her}} life story to Maria and Darnford, {{explaining}} {{that she was}} born a bastard. Jemima's mother died {{while she was still}} an infant, making her already precarious social position worse.

When the man's wife discovers that Jemima is pregnant with his child, she is <b>thrown</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house. Unable to support herself, she aborts her child and becomes a prostitute. She becomes the kept woman of a man of some wealth who seems obsessed with pleasure of every kind: food, love, etc. After the death of the gentleman keeping her, she becomes an attendant at the asylum where Maria is imprisoned.|$|E
5|$|Mido was <b>thrown</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Egypt team {{during the}} 2006 African Cup of Nations as a {{consequence}} of an argument with coach Hassan Shehata in the semi-final game against Senegal, which started after Mido reacted badly to being substituted. His replacement Amr Zaki came on to score a header with his first touch, putting Egypt into the final. A day later, Mido reconciled with Shehata, but was given a six-month suspension from playing with Egypt. Mido was eventually recalled by the side following his suspension, ready for the 2008 African Cup of Nations qualification which Egypt won. Mido was included in the Egypt squad to play South Africa in London in November 2006, despite suffering from a knee injury at the time. However, he was left out of the Egypt squad to play Mauritania in an African Nations Cup qualifier in March 2007.|$|E

5|$|Nearer {{the time}} of the vote Chisholm made a {{successful}} pitch to the league chairmen which worried Dyke. He phoned the ITV franchises and advised them to raise their collective bid – this came to a total of £262 million. Upon receiving the bid {{on the day of the}} vote, Parry phoned Chisholm and advised him to bid higher. Chisholm in turn telephoned Murdoch to seek his permission and submitted a new offer which totalled £304 million. At the clubs' meeting, Parry recommended BSkyB's joint bid with the BBC which won the vote by 14 to 6 with two abstentions. The deal was scrutinised by much of the English print media and leading figures of English football. ITV sought legal action after learning BSkyB had submitted an improved bid without their knowledge, but their case was <b>thrown</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> High Court.|$|E
5|$|The four {{throwing}} events generally all {{begin on}} one side of the stadium. The javelin throw typically takes place on a piece of track that is central and parallel to the straights of the main running track. The javelin throwing area is a sector shape frequently across the Pitch (sports field) in the middle of the stadium, ensuring that the javelin has a minimal chance of causing damage or injury. The discus throw and hammer throw contests begin in a tall metal cage usually situated in one of the corners of the field. The cage reduces the danger of implements being <b>thrown</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field of play and throws travel diagonally across the field in the centre of the stadium. The shot put features a circular throwing area with a toe board at one end. The throwing area is a sector. Some stadia also have a water jump area {{on one side}} of the field specifically for steeplechase races.|$|E
5|$|The fourth {{match was}} a triple threat match, for the WWE Intercontinental Championship, in which {{champion}} Shelton Benjamin defended the title against Carlito and Johnny Nitro. The match began with Carlito performing a springboard moonsault from the ring apron hitting both Nitro and Benjamin in the process. A {{spot in the}} match saw Carlito set up Nitro in a Tree of Woe, a move in which a wrestler suspends his opponent upside down on a turnbuckle, with the opponent's back being up against it, Carlito stood on the turnbuckle, in which Benjamin followed by jumping up with Carlito. Nitro lifted Benjamin on his shoulders and threw him down, while Benjamin dropped Carlito, making both men hit the mat. Later in the match, Carlito performed a backcracker on Benjamin. Nitro, who was <b>thrown</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ring, returned and removed Carlito from making the cover on Benjamin. He instead covered Benjamin for the pinfall victory, thus becoming the new Intercontinental champion.|$|E
