Consistent with Gestalt guidelines, the Emotion to Know method proposes respect for diversity and originality considering each of them as resources, and finding the educator in the role of the solicitor and provoker of opportunities rather than a mere <b>transmitter</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> and pre-packaged and pre-planned content.|$|E
50|$|Instructionism are {{educational}} practices {{characterized for}} being instructor-centered.

The 'transmission' of knowledge and skills from the teacher to the student in this context is often manifested in the form of drill, practice and rote memorization. An 'instructionist', then, focuses on the preparation, organization and management of the lesson making sure the plan is detailed and the communication is effective.

Pedagogy, “the {{principles}} and methods of instruction ” (Wordnet), implies a relationship among actors playing the roles of teacher and student and has {{a direct impact on}} the students ' learning performance. In the past, the teacher was a <b>transmitter</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> and the student a passive receiver. Nowadays, students are encouraged to challenge, deepen and create their own knowledge and teachers are supposed to lead this process. For that reason, transparency emerges as an important concern that aims to enhance this relationship by improving student awareness about the process and the contents of learning.

The pretest posttest control group experimental design was chosen 			for the experiment.

The 			population of the study consisted of all the students of 10 th class 			studying in the Government High Schools located in Rawalpindi city. 			The sample of the study consisted of 90 students of 10 th class 			studying in Govt. High School DAV College Road, Rawalpindi. They 			were divided into three groups, each group consisted of 30 students. 			These groups were formed through matching {{on the basis of their}} 			pretest scores. One of these groups was randomly chosen as control 			group and other two as experimental groups. The independent variable 			in the study was model of teaching and the dependent variable was 			the academic achievement of students. The dependent variable was 			measured through a self constructed 50 -item achievement test that 			was used both as a pretest as well as a posttest. The experimental 			groups were exposed to the treatment of teaching models while the 			control group was provided with conventional teaching. The material 			used for teaching the experimental groups consisted of the lesson 			plans prepared in the light of each teaching model according to 			Hunter seven planning steps. After the treatment of eight weeks 			duration, the obtained data was analyzed by using the statistical 			techniques such as mean, standard deviation, coefficient of 			variation, simple analysis of variance Scheffe test and Tuckeys 			test in order to find out whether the difference in the mean 			achievement score of the comparison groups was statistically 			significant. The level of significance used in the study was. 05. 			The main results of the study confirmed the research hypotheses.

In an authoritative discourse, the discussion is “closed” to other voices, having a fixed intent and controlled outcome. In a dialogic discourse, the teacher encourages the students to express their ideas and debate their points of view. The discussion is “open” and may include several different views. The intent of the dialogic discourse is generative, and the outcome is unknown. Scott et al. (2006) suggested {{that there is a}} necessary tension during classroom discourse between the authoritative and dialogic dimensions. The teachers may shift between approaches, according to their teaching purposes and goals (Scott et al. 2006). The interactive/non-interactive dimension determines the students’ involvement level during the discourse. In interactive discourse, many students participate in the discussion, whereas in non-interactive discourse, the number of students participating in the discussion is limited to one or a very few.|$|E

Such art can in turn become significant elements in teachers’ own personal-professional identities.

The aim of the study was to analyse whether the images in a collection of coloring books entitled The Boys´ Doodles Book and The girl´s Doodles Book show sexist stereotypes about body models and dominant patterns of physical activity. An independent observational group studied the images of the body through content analysis with a coding scheme using categories (gender, age, somatotype, space and type of physical activity) previously adopted by experts. The Boys´ Doodles Book shows an adult man with different body types, while women are not represented. In both books, the bodies do not maintain a preferred location. The Girls´Doodles Book represents a higher percentage of girls with a slender body, while men, who were under-represented, assume different body types. The Girls´Doodles Book tends to represent women in physical activities or sports with an artistic component.

40|$|Abstract:- The {{renovation}} {{of teaching and}} learning methodologies, promoted by the onset of the Bologna Declaration, is leading to shifting perceptions of roles and responsibilities of both teachers and students. Particularly in large engineering classes, certain subjects benefit from more active approaches to learning, namely those associated with team work and tutorial practices, rather than traditional lecture/teacher-driven presentations. Project-led education (PLE) and Project/problem-based learning (PBL) are successful student-centred teaching strategies by directing team work towards independent learning. These new approaches transfer the teacher’s role from a mere <b>transmitter</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> to that of advisor and facilitator of the learning process, by providing guidance and suggestions designed to encourage students to find their own solutions for proposed problems. This paper describes a methodology for promoting and encouraging independent team work using tutorial techniques for the practical sessions of the Environmental Impact Assessment course (mandatory and elective) included in the Civil Engineering programme at the University of Minho. The authors were faced with a multi-faceted problem: managing and motivating a large class of civil engineering students in a transdisciplinary and non-traditional civil engineering setting.
