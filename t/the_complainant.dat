25|$|Under Pennsylvania law, a {{defendant}} is strictly {{liable for the}} offense of rape, a felony of the first degree, when <b>the</b> <b>complainant</b> is 12 or younger.

25|$|One {{week before}} Gacy's wedding, on June 22, {{he was arrested}} and charged with aggravated battery and {{reckless}} conduct. The arrest was in response to a complaint filed by a youth named Jackie Dee, who informed police that Gacy, impersonating a police officer, had flashed a sheriff's badge, lured him into his car, and forced him to perform oral sex. These charges were later dropped after <b>the</b> <b>complainant</b> attempted to blackmail Gacy into paying money in exchange for dropping the charges.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>complainants,</b> Abdul Malik bin Sukor, an undischarged bankrupt, and his wife, Mislia binte Yusof, {{wished to}} sell their Housing and Development Board flat in Woodlands. They sought {{the help of a}} real estate agent named Rudolph Khoo, who {{informed}} them that Malik would have to be discharged from his bankruptcy before they could sell their flat. Khoo offered to help <b>the</b> <b>complainants</b> obtain a loan of S$25,000, to be repaid upon the sale of the flat. To facilitate these procedures, Khoo introduced a lawyer, Alan Shankar s/o (son of) Anant Kulkarni, to <b>the</b> <b>complainants,</b> who was to assist them in applying for a discharge from bankruptcy on Malik's behalf, acting for them in the sale of their flat, and documenting several loans that they had procured from one Chiang Bin Kwang. The loans from Chiang were to be repaid with the proceeds from the sale of the flat. Following this, Mislia asked for two more loans from Chiang, which Shankar helped to arrange. In total, she signed three agreements to borrow a sum of $88,500, consisting of $45,000, $30,000 and $13,500 on three separate occasions. However, Mislia claimed she only received $40,000, consisting of $25,000, $10,000 and $5,000 on each of the occasions. Four years later, <b>the</b> <b>complainants</b> lodged a complaint against Shankar with the Law Society of Singapore. Following an investigation, Shankar was tried by the Disciplinary Committee of the Law Society and convicted of three counts of grossly improper conduct contrary to section 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act. The charges were based on allegations that Shankar had acted for both <b>the</b> <b>complainants</b> and Chiang without advising <b>the</b> <b>complainants</b> of <b>the</b> consequences of this conflict of interest, that he had not taken full instructions from <b>the</b> <b>complainants,</b> that he had asked <b>the</b> <b>complainants</b> to sign documents without properly explaining their effect, and that he had not ascertained whether the sums of money that Chiang paid to Mislia were in line with the loan agreements.|$|R

40|$|From a {{group of}} 203 cases of low-frequency-noise {{complaints}} a random selection of twenty-one cases were investigated. The main aim of the investigation was {{to answer the question}} whether the annoyance is caused by an external physical sound or by a low-frequency tinnitus. Noise recordings were made in the homes of <b>the</b> <b>complainants,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>complainants</b> were exposed to these recordings from their own home in blind test listening experiments. Furthermore, the low-frequency hearing function of <b>the</b> <b>complainants</b> was investigated, and characteristics of the annoying sound was matched. The results showed that some of <b>the</b> <b>complainants</b> are annoyed by a physical sound (20 - 180 Hz), while others suffer from low-frequency tinnitus (perceived frequency 40 - 100 Hz). Physical sound at frequencies below 20 Hz (infrasound) is not responsible for the annoyance – or at all audible – in any of the investigated cases, and none of <b>the</b> <b>complainants</b> has extraordinary hearing sensitivity at low frequencies. For comparable cases of low-frequency noise complaints in general, it is anticipated that physical sound is responsible in a substantial part of the cases, while low-frequency tinnitus is responsible in another substantial part of the cases. 1...|$|R
25|$|Women are not {{necessarily}} sympathetic to female complainants who have been sexually harassed. If the harasser was male, internalized sexism (or jealousy over the sexual attention towards the victim) may encourage some women to react with as much hostility towards <b>the</b> <b>complainant</b> as some male colleagues. Fear of being targeted for harassment or retaliation themselves may also cause some women to respond with hostility. For example, when Lois Jenson filed her lawsuit against Eveleth Taconite Co., the women shunned her both at work and in the community—many of these women later joined her suit. Women may even project hostility onto the victim in order to bond with their male coworkers and build trust.|$|E
25|$|A {{landmark}} decision, {{issued on}} 29 January 2014, {{was the first}} injunction for marriage recognition in Puebla. The case involved a same-sex couple who legally married in Mexico City in 2012 and filed for spousal benefits with the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) {{in the state of}} Puebla, but were denied. Because <b>the</b> <b>complainant</b> died during the injunction process, a lower court had dismissed the case, but the Supreme Court of the Nation, granted the injunction and ordered recognition of the marriage by both the state of Puebla and the IMSS. The injunction required IMSS to extend benefits equal to married heterosexual couples' benefits to gays and lesbians who are married or have entered into civil unions throughout Mexico.|$|E
25|$|The sectarian {{tension in}} Little Syria reached its zenith in 1906 when John Stefan, {{brother of the}} priest Khairallah Stephan, {{was killed in a}} {{restaurant}} brawl on Washington Street. Mokarzel was apprehended by the police for the assault that was linked to the murder. Mokarzel's calumnious accusation and arrest were overturned as <b>the</b> <b>complainant</b> did not show up to the trial. The charge was dismissed and the police authorities settled on an Orthodox man, Elias Zreik, as the murderer. During Zreik's trial, the prosecution held that Elias and his brother George were sent to kill Mokarzel; when they did not find him in his office they set out to the restaurant where his Maronite sympathizers often met.|$|E

In an interview with Gacy's former wife the same day, they learned of the disappearance of John Butkovich. The same day, the Maine West High School ring was traced to a John A. Szyc. In an interview with Szyc's mother the same day, she informed officers of the January 1977 disappearance of her son and that several items from his apartment were also missing, including a Motorola TV set. She added that investigators had informed her the month following his disappearance that her son had apparently sold his Plymouth Satellite to a John Gacy. Investigators noted that one of Gacy's employees, Michael Rossi, drove a similar car to Szyc's: A check of the VIN confirmed the car driven by Rossi had belonged to Szyc.|$|E

500|$|In 1822, Conwell {{showed his}} support for Harold by {{appointing}} him as Vicar General of the diocese. The Hogan schism took on new dimensions, however, when Hogan was charged with rape and battery. Philadelphia mayor Robert Wharton presided over the trial, which captured the city's attention. Although the jury found him not guilty, Hogan's image was harmed. A letter from the Pope sided with Conwell but, after initially agreeing to leave the diocese, Hogan reversed himself and stayed on. The pro-Hogan faction prevailed at St. Mary's trustee elections that year amid bloody rioting between parish members. The next year, 1823, some Hogan supporters convinced a local woman to bring a paternity suit against Conwell, but the charges were dismissed quickly and <b>the</b> <b>complainant</b> was convicted of perjury.

500|$|The {{official}} summary {{synopsis of}} the film was published in The Moving Picture World. It states, [...] "A poor widow who supports her two children, one a baby and the other girl of six, by scrubbing, weakens under her hard work, and finally dies. Marie, the 'little mother,' anxious that her home may not be broken up, calls {{on one of her}} mother's employers and requests that she be given a chance to take the dead woman's place. The artist, a wealthy, good-hearted man, pleased with the child's pluck, laughingly employs her, and makes her believe that she is really doing all the 'chores.' The artist's kindness, much to his surprise, brings him recompense one [...] One of his models plots to fleece him. She calls at his studio, faints in his arms, and when her confederate rushes in with a policeman, she makes charges that lead to the arrest of the innocent artist. Just as the policeman is leading her benefactor away, the little scrub woman sees what is happening. She follows the party to the police station, but is afraid to enter. When <b>the</b> <b>complainant</b> and her husband come out, the child is impressed with the fact that they seem to be on the best of terms. Her suspicions are aroused, and she shadows them like a regular detective. What crook would ever imagine that a little girl, wheeling a baby carriage, was a sleuth? This pair certainly did not, for when they meet a new friend in the park, they stop to tell him how they successfully arranged to trim a rich artist, never doubting that he would pay liberally to have the case dropped. The little girl, from her place in hiding, heard the story. So the little girl found a policeman, and told him about it. And the policeman went with her to the hiding place, and heard enough to warrant him in making what he afterward described as a 'two handed collar.' The adventurous and her confederate were hailed to the police station and locked up, while the artist was set free in a hurry. The result is that there is now a 'scrub woman' whose duties are a sinecure although the wages are high, {{and the future of the}} 'little mother' and her baby are assured." ...|$|E
