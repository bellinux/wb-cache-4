5|$|In August 2009, it was {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>Lee</b> was to leave the show. Producers confirmed <b>that</b> <b>Lee</b> would film her last scenes the following month and they would air in Australia that November. Following the news, Lee {{said that she would}} miss the friendships that she had formed with the actors and crew.|$|E
5|$|On 11 November 2014, the Badminton World Federation {{confirmed}} <b>that</b> <b>Lee</b> {{was temporarily}} suspended from competing {{due to an}} apparent anti-doping regulation violation. The hearing was held on 11 April 2015 in Amsterdam.|$|E
5|$|On 27 April 2015, it was {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>Lee</b> had been handed a backdated eight-month ban for his anti-doping rule violation. The panel was convinced <b>that</b> <b>Lee</b> had no intent to cheat and allowed him to resume his career by 1 May 2015. Lee was stripped of his silver medal from the 2014 World Championships but allowed to keep his two bronze medals from the 2014 Asian Games.|$|E
50|$|Dr. Seo Jae-jeong of Johns Hopkins University claimed <b>that</b> <b>Lee's</b> {{unrealistic}} expectations {{in dealing with}} North Korea were due to his Christian faith.|$|R
50|$|In May 2016 it was {{reported}} in The Hollywood Reporter <b>that</b> <b>Lee's</b> novel High Dive was being adapted into a feature film by Director Brian Kirk.|$|R

5|$|On {{the night}} of July 2, Meade {{correctly}} predicted at a council of war <b>that</b> <b>Lee</b> would attack {{the center of his}} lines the following morning.|$|E
5|$|Chinese PEN Center {{director}} Bei Ling alerted Apple Daily to Lee Bo's disappearance, and {{the journal}} reported on 1 January 2016 <b>that</b> <b>Lee</b> {{had become the}} fifth member of Causeway Bay Books to disappear. His wife was unwilling {{to speak to the}} press at the time, but filed a missing person's report with the Hong Kong police the following day.|$|E
5|$|History {{may never}} know {{the true story of}} Lee's {{intentions}} at Gettysburg. He never published memoirs, and his after-action report from the battle was cursory. Most of the senior commanders of the charge were casualties and did not write reports. Pickett's report was apparently so bitter <b>that</b> <b>Lee</b> ordered him to destroy it, and no copy has been found.|$|E
25|$|It is said <b>that</b> <b>Lee's</b> {{policy in}} the 1960s and 1970s (stop at two) worked too well, and the birth rate {{declined}} at a rapid rate and resulted to an aging population.|$|R
50|$|Electronic Arts had {{initially}} stated <b>that</b> <b>Lee's</b> Wii Remote head tracking technology would appear as an Easter egg {{in the game}} Boom Blox, but later announced that the feature had been removed.|$|R
50|$|Bock {{announced}} her run against Barbara Lee in the 2002 primary as a Democrat, arguing <b>that</b> <b>Lee's</b> {{vote against the}} war in Afghanistan was unpatriotic. She later withdrew from the race before the filing deadline.|$|R
5|$|As noon {{drew near}} with no sight of either Huger or Magruder, who were {{supposed}} to be manning the Confederate right flank, Lee replaced these two forces with the smaller units of Brig. Gens. Armistead and Wright, two of Huger's brigades that had reached the battlefield some time earlier. Huger and his other two brigades (under Brig. Gens. Ransom and Mahone) were still too far north of the scene. Despite the mishaps and disunity, Malvern Hill would be the first time during the Seven Days Battles <b>that</b> <b>Lee</b> managed to concentrate his force.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{theatrical}} release of Miracle at St. Anna, Spike Lee and the Italian production company On My Own Produzioni Cinematografiche brought {{a lawsuit against}} TF1, alleging that the company failed in its contractual agreement with On My Own to distribute the film in international markets, excluding the United States, Canada and Italy. In its defense, TF1 refused to distribute Miracle at St. Anna, claiming <b>that</b> <b>Lee</b> had made a different film than the one promised, and refused to pay On My Own the €11 million advance needed to distribute the film internationally.|$|E
5|$|For the English {{winter of}} 1930–31, Lee took on {{positions}} at both St. Andrew's College and Rhodes University, both in Grahamstown in South Africa. The MCC were touring that winter, and suffered heavily with injuries and illness. No fewer than seven players were missing at various stages, and the England captain, Percy Chapman, requested <b>that</b> <b>Lee</b> be excused from his coaching duties {{to join up}} with the touring party. Having believed he had secured this permission, {{he made his first}} appearance against Natal, scoring 14 runs in his only innings. He played in three further tour matches, twice making scores in the forties, but not reaching a half-century during the tour. His only Test appearance came in the fourth Test between England and South Africa. Lee opened the innings alongside Bob Wyatt and scored 18 and 1 in his two innings of the match, which finished a draw. During the match, the MCC were contacted by one of the schools he had been coaching at, which claimed <b>that</b> <b>Lee</b> had broken his contract by leaving without permission. Lee argued vehemently against these claims, citing the fact that the sportsmaster at the school had told Jack White that he had permission to leave, but the MCC were unmoved, and refused to issue Lee his England cap and blazer until he had apologised. Lee felt he had no need to apologise, and never received either cap or blazer, though small compensation {{came in the form of}} an England touring tie, which Jack Hobbs gave to him.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} the 2011-12 season, Leeds manager Neil Warnock {{revealed}} on 2 May <b>that</b> <b>Lees</b> {{had been}} offered a new contract at Leeds United. Warnock revealed to Yorkshire Radio that he felt <b>that</b> <b>Lees</b> {{had been one of the}} bright sparks of the season and that he had become one of the first names on the team sheet for Leeds. He was subsequently given the number 4 squad shirt for the beginning of the 2012-13 season. Lees' first goal of the season came in Leeds' 2-1 defeat against Blackpool. Lees scored his second goal of the season in the League Cup match against Oxford United.|$|R
25|$|Young, III, Alfred C. Lee's Army During the Overland Campaign: A Numerical Study (Louisiana State University Press; 2013) 400 pages; argues <b>that</b> <b>Lee's</b> Army was {{far larger}} in {{strength}} and suffered much higher casualties than previously believed.|$|R
5000|$|Low Thia Kiang, Secretary-General for the Workers' Party of Singapore, said <b>that</b> <b>Lee's</b> [...] "passing marks {{an end of}} an era in Singapore's history", {{and that}} [...] "his {{contributions}} to Singapore will be remembered for generations to come".|$|R
5|$|Lee made Sally's Beauty Spot, a 12-minute-long {{short film}} {{focusing}} on a mole on her sister's right breast, for a film editing class at NYU in 1990. For the film she used a second-hand Bolex camera and edited it with a Steenbeck editing suite. She later recalled that she recorded the film while in her pyjamas. The production cost a total of $4,000. Fellow Canadian filmmaker David Weaver described it as sexualizing Sally's body, something <b>that</b> <b>Lee</b> had not intended. The film was first screened at the Festival of Festivals in Toronto. After graduation, Lee spent time as a curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art before returning to Canada.|$|E
5|$|Mainland law {{enforcement}} agencies must notify their Hong Kong counterparts within 14 days under a reciprocal mechanism if any Hong Kong resident is detained across the border, but Hong Kong officials had received no word through these channels at the expiration of the deadline. On 8 January Chinese security officials acknowledged <b>that</b> <b>Lee</b> Bo was being held in China. This {{took the form of}} a nine-word message sent to the Hong Kong Police Force with no indication of his whereabouts or his activity status.|$|E
5|$|McClellan did {{not believe}} his army {{was ready for a}} battle, and hoped <b>that</b> <b>Lee</b> would not give them one. Nonetheless, he left his troops at Malvern Hill and {{traveled}} downstream aboard the ironclad USS Galena to inspect his army's future resting place at Harrison's Landing. McClellan did not delegate an interim commander; Porter, who was in command during the initial attack, became the de facto leader on the Union side of the battle.|$|E
5000|$|There was {{no doubt}} <b>that</b> <b>Lee's</b> whole army ... was close at hand and {{strongly}} entrenched again. Grant ... declared emphatically he would not run his head against heavy works. Charles A. Dana, representative of the War Department, accompanying Grant.|$|R
50|$|This {{addition}} to Lee {{will make it}} the largest rural high school in Kent County. It is hoped <b>that</b> <b>Lee's</b> growth will necessitate the building of larger additions which will make {{it one of the}} largest township high schools in Michigan.|$|R
5000|$|... : Prime Minister of Malaysia Najib Razak {{sent his}} condolences saying [...] "I am saddened {{to hear about}} the passing of Lee, {{founding}} PM of Singapore" [...] and <b>that</b> <b>Lee's</b> [...] "achievements were great" [...] and [...] "his legacy is assured".|$|R
5|$|Newt Lee, {{the night}} watchman, arrived at work shortly before 4:00 and Frank, who was {{normally}} calm, came bustling {{out of his}} office. Frank told Lee {{that he had not}} yet finished his own work and asked Lee to return at 6:00. Newt Lee noticed that Frank was very agitated and asked if he could sleep in the packing room, but Frank was insistent <b>that</b> <b>Lee</b> leave the building and told Lee to go out {{and have a good time}} in town before coming back.|$|E
5|$|On Labour Day, he won {{his first}} ever India Open, and also his third {{consecutive}} Malaysia Open Grand Prix Gold title a week later. Despite the fact <b>that</b> <b>Lee</b> won all the matches he played during the Sudirman Cup, Malaysia's journey ended in quarterfinals, after being beaten by South Korea 2–3. In late June, he won the Indonesia Open, becoming the first non-Indonesian player to complete the hat-trick in the tournament.|$|E
5|$|The {{centerpiece}} of the Lincoln Room is a portrait of Abraham Lincoln painted by 19th-century American portraitist Edward Dalton Marchant; {{it is one of}} a number of drawings, paintings, and photographs of Lincoln used to decorate this room. The sitting room in the Blair House wing of the complex was originally used by the Blair family to receive U.S. presidents. In this room in 1861, Montgomery Blair, acting on Lincoln's orders, offered the command of the Union Army to Robert E. Lee, an offer <b>that</b> <b>Lee</b> declined.|$|E
2500|$|New York Times {{columnist}} Joe Nocera continued this argument. He {{also took}} issue with how the book was promoted by the 'Murdoch Empire' as a [...] "newly discovered" [...] novel, attesting that {{the other people in}} the Sothebys meeting insisted <b>that</b> <b>Lee's</b> attorney was present in 2011, when Lee's former agent (who was subsequently fired) and the Sotheby's specialist found the manuscript. They said she knew full well that it was the same one submitted to Tay Hohoff in the 1950s that was reworked into Mockingbird, and <b>that</b> <b>Lee's</b> lawyer Tonja Carter had been sitting on the discovery, waiting for the moment when she, and not Alice, would be in charge of Harper Lee's affairs.|$|R
25|$|Wasim Jaffer (3) {{given out}} by Mark Benson – Jaffer bowled by a yorker from Brett <b>Lee.</b> Replays show <b>that</b> <b>Lee's</b> front foot {{was close to}} outside the crease {{which would make it}} a no ball, however the {{evidence}} was not conclusive.|$|R
50|$|Keith Williams notes <b>that</b> <b>Lee's</b> work is {{difficult}} to categorise as he was not explicitly anti-war, but nor was he 'a naive patriot'. He argues this is {{a key factor in}} explaining why Lee's poetry came to disappear from the 'post-Great War canon'.|$|R
5|$|After {{overseeing}} {{the transfer of}} Richmond, Breckinridge joined Lee's forces at Farmville, Virginia, {{on the night of}} April 5 and remained there until April 7. He continued on to Danville, arriving on April 11 to discover <b>that</b> <b>Lee</b> had surrendered on April 9 and the Confederate cabinet had already fled to Greensboro, North Carolina. Arriving in Greensboro on April 13, he advised the cabinet that the remaining Confederate armies should be surrendered; only Davis and Secretary of State Judah P. Benjamin disagreed. At Bennett Place, he assisted Joseph E. Johnston in his surrender negotiations with Major General William Tecumseh Sherman. Sherman later praised Breckinridge's negotiating skills, and the surrender terms agreed to were later rejected by Washington as too generous, forcing Sherman to offer the same terms as Grant had at Appomattox, which were accepted.|$|E
5|$|In mid-2005 Barrales {{began looking}} for musicians for the band, asking friends of his {{to see if they}} could {{recommend}} anyone, which is how he heard of guitarist Alex Lee. When Barrales saw Lee play, he dropped the thought of trying to play rhythm guitar himself because he had a fear of not being able to keep up. There were a few years <b>that</b> <b>Lee</b> was playing guitar, but he was already playing along to music by Steve Vai, John Petrucci, Rusty Cooley, Paul Gilbert and Michael Angelo Batio. Lee decided to join Barrales, and together, they went on searching until they found themselves the drummer Carlos Regalado, who was known locally by playing covers of Megadeth and Metallica. With Regalado in the band, he helped to find bassist Ruben Dominguez. The band was impressed with the skills of Dominguez, who soon joined the band completing its line-up. The band then decided to name themselves after Exodus' Bonded by Blood, an album they had in common in their collection, even though their music tastes differed.|$|E
5|$|On Monday, April 28, Frank, {{accompanied}} by his attorney, Luther Rosser, gave a written deposition to the police that provided a brief timeline of his activities on Saturday. He said Phagan was in his office between 12:05 and 12:10p.m., <b>that</b> <b>Lee</b> had arrived at 4p.m. but was asked to return later, and that Frank had a confrontation with ex-employee James Gantt at 6p.m. as Frank was leaving and Lee arriving. Frank explained that Lee's time card for Sunday morning had several gaps (Lee was supposed to punch in every half-hour) that Frank had missed when he discussed the time card with police on Sunday. At Rosser's insistence, Frank exposed his body to demonstrate {{that he had no}} cuts or injuries and the police found no blood on the suit that Frank said he had worn on Saturday. The police found no blood stains on the laundry at Frank's house.|$|E
50|$|Wasim Jaffer (3) {{given out}} by Mark Benson - Jaffer bowled by a yorker from Brett <b>Lee.</b> Replays show <b>that</b> <b>Lee's</b> front foot {{was close to}} outside the crease {{which would make it}} a no ball, however the {{evidence}} was not conclusive.|$|R
5000|$|Lee was, naturally, {{identified}} as the [...] "spiritual leader" [...] (though he personally never joined the party); the TSU hoped <b>that</b> <b>Lee's</b> popularity would help the TSU make the 5% support mark. Further, Lee's dominance in the party was revealed when the candidates TSU nominated had all been personally approved by Lee beforehand. Meanwhile, as Lee's actions increasingly departed from the KMT's unificationist positions, he was eventually expelled from the Kuomintang. Although there was some initial speculation <b>that</b> <b>Lee's</b> expulsion would cause mass defections in the Kuomintang, none of the major Kuomintang leaders or Lee's close associates changed sides. Nonetheless, {{former members of the}} KMT were still to be the fundamental building blocks of the new party, with half of TSU candidates coming directly from the KMT.|$|R
2500|$|On June 6, 1863, Union Brigadier General John Buford {{informed}} Hooker <b>that</b> <b>Lee's</b> [...] "movable" [...] force, {{consisting of}} six brigades of cavalry, was at Culpeper. Buford {{did not know}} about the presence of Ewell's Second Corps and two of James Longstreet's First Corps divisions at Culpeper.|$|R
