5|$|All {{the other}} Channel Islands raids were less successful. In January 1943, Operation Huckabuck, {{a raid on}} Herm, was a failure.

The next raids were Operations Hardtack 28 and Hardtack 7 in December 1943.

The exploding mines alerted the German garrison and the Commandos had <b>to</b> <b>abandon</b> <b>the</b> operation.

5|$|Afterward, Evans {{moved the}} Klan's {{national}} headquarters to Washington, D.C., where {{the murder of}} Simmon's lawyer had received less publicity.
