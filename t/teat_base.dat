40|$|Aim: The present {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} study the association between udder morphology and in vitro activity of milk leukocytes in high yielding crossbred cows. Materials and Methods: A total of 48 healthy high yielding crossbred cows were selected for the study. The udder configuration and teat/udder morphology were recorded before milking. Milk samples (100 ml/cow) were collected aseptically. Milk somatic cell counts (SCC) and milk differential leukocyte counts were performed microscopically. Milk leukocytes (viz., neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages) were isolated from milk samples by density gradient centrifugation. Phagocytic index (PI) of milk neutrophils and macrophages were evaluated by colorimetric nitro blue tetrazolium assay. Lymphocytes proliferation response was estimated by MTT assay and expressed as stimulation index. Results: There was a significant (p< 0. 01) positive correlation between milk SCC with mid teat diameter, <b>teat</b> <b>base</b> diameter and significant (p< 0. 05) negative correlation between milk SCC and {{the height of the}} teat from the ground. Milk SCC was found to be significantly (p< 0. 01) lower in bowl-shaped udder and higher (p< 0. 01) in pendulous type. Milk macrophage percentage was positively (p< 0. 01) correlated with udder circumference. PI of milk neutrophil was negatively (p< 0. 01) correlation between <b>teat</b> <b>base</b> diameter, and PI of milk macrophages was found to be positively (p< 0. 01) correlated with teat apex diameter. Both PI of milk neutrophils and macrophages was found to be significantly (p< 0. 01) lower in the animals having flat and round teat and pendulous type of udder. In vitro PI of milk neutrophils was found to be significantly (p< 0. 01) lower in flat teat. In vitro PI of milk macrophages was found to be significantly (p< 0. 01) lower in the round and flat teats compared to pointed and cylindrical teats. Conclusion: Udder risk factors such as teat shape and size, teat to floor distance, udder shape, and size may decrease the in vitro activity of milk leukocytes hence facilitates the incidence intramammary infections...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the features and size of teat structures in cows using ultrasonography. The experiment was conducted with 12 clinically healthy Black-and-White cows, 3 years of age, with body weight 350 – 450 kg. Ultrasonography was performed on 48 teats using ultrasound SonoScape A 5 v (SonoScape, China) with multifrequency linear transducer (5 – 12 MHz). The potential of the imaging technique to visualize teat structures as well as teat canal length and diameter, the diameter in the area of the rosette of Furstenberg, teat wall thickness, teat cistern diameter in its middle part and teat cistern diameter in <b>teat</b> <b>base</b> was evaluated. Scans were conducted before milking, immediately after milking, and 1 and 2 hours after milking. The average teat canal length measured by ultrasound was 8. 48 ± 1. 41 mm before milking, and until the 2 nd post milking hour its size became statistically significantly (p< 0. 001) lower (7. 48 ± 0. 93 mm). Teat canal diameter showed a significant difference (p< 0. 01) only immediately after milking compared to the size before milking. The diameter of the middle part and the base of the teat cistern also tended to decrease considerably after milking (p< 0. 001) as compared to premilking values. The teat wall thickness immediately after milking and 1 hour after milking were statistically significantly higher (p< 0. 001) compared to the premilking size. The analysis of results showed that ultrasonography is a rapid non-invasive and accurate method for determination of characteristics and size of teat structures. It could be used for evaluation of changes occurring in bovine teat after milking – shortening of the teat canal, teat wall thickening and reduction of teat cistern diameter...|$|E
40|$|The thesis explores {{an issue}} of {{mastitis}} in dairy cows, and factors that influence {{the health of a}} mammary gland. In span of 2012 - 2013, 629 quarter samples of milk were collected, the somatic cells count (SCC) was determined and the results related to the condition of <b>teats</b> <b>base,</b> and also to an order and phase of lactation. The results were compared to the pool samples collected in 2008 - 2013 (SCC, TBC) and the number and development of clinical mastitis was followed (2012 - 2013). The condition of <b>teats</b> <b>base</b> was estimated as an important factor contributing to the health of a mammary gland. The lowest SCC was identified in the first phase of lactation, and, contrary to that, the highest SCC was identified in the third phase of lactation (active involution). The order of lactation proved to be an important factor influencing SCC in milk. Dairy cows staying in pasture were shown to have less SCC in milk; it can therefore be concluded that grazing has a positive impact on SCC in milk. In the examined period, very low number of clinical mastitis was determine...|$|R
40|$|Prevention {{of damage}} to the teat and {{mastitis}} requires determination of the teat load caused by a collapsing liner. The {{aim of this study}} was to test a pressure-indicating film designed to measure the pressure between a collapsing liner and artificial teats. The Ultra Super Low and the Extreme Low pressure-indicating films were tested on two types of artificial teat. The experiments were performed with a conventional milking cluster equipped with round silicone liners. For each teat and film type, 30 repetitions were performed. Each repetition was performed with a new piece of film. Kruskal-Wallis tests were performed to detect differences between the pressure values for the different teats. The area of regions where pressure-indication color developed was calculated to determine the most suitable film type. Both film types measured the pressure applied to both artificial teats by the teat cup liner. Thus, the pressure-indicating films can be used to measure the pressure between a collapsing liner and an artificial <b>teat.</b> <b>Based</b> on the results of the present investigation, a pressure-indicating film with the measurement ranges of both film types combined would be an optimal tool to measure the overall pressure between an artificial teat and a collapsing liner...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, a Lactococcus lactis strain was tested {{for its ability}} of growth {{inhibition}} of Staphylococcus aureus in-vitro, using a cocultivation method. Furthermore, the strain was used in a field trial as probiotic teat dip for dairy cows. For the cocultivataion, a Lactococcus lactis strain and a Staphylococcus aureus strain were incubated in microtitre plates in different concentrations and their growth was observed by turbidity measurement. To evaluate the potential impact on bacterial growth, DNA was extracted from all incubates and the strains were quantified with qPCR. A minor inhibition of growth of S. aureus was detected when cocultivation was performed with the highest used concentration of L. lactis and the lowest used concentration of S. aureus. No other concentration led to the implication of a mutual impact of the strains. During the field trial over the period of four months, a control group of 35 dairy cows was dipped with a <b>teat</b> dip <b>based</b> on iodine and an experimental group of 37 animals was treated with a <b>teat</b> dip <b>based</b> on Lactococcus lactis. Data of clinical parameters were collected to evaluate {{the impact of the}} application of the teat dips on the teat skin as well as the udder health. Furthermore, the colonization of the teat canal by the applied Lactococcus lactis strain was evaluated, using microbiological and molecular biological methods after taking swab samples. The evaluation of clinical parameters and selected characteristic values for udder health revealed few differences between the control and the experimental group. Accordingly, the application of the teat dip containing Lactococcus lactis can be classified as comparable to the teat dip used in the control group, containing iodine. The commercially available PathoProof™ Mastitis PCR Assay was quantified with extracts of culture strains, which lead to some false-positive results. Therefore, the samples of the experimental animals could not be tested for all mastitis causing pathogens detectable with the test kit and a possible variation of the microflora of the teat canal could not be evaluated. The establishment of the used Lactococcus lactis strain in the teat canal of dairy cows could be shown by microbiological as well as molecular biological methods. With regard to the present results, the use of a probiotic teat dip seems to be comparable to conventional teat dips. However, further studies are needed to evaluate the effects of the probiotic teat dip under different conditions, including animal housing, hygiene and genetics...|$|R
40|$|Teat {{number is}} a {{discontinuous}} and often canalized trait in populations of domestic swine. This {{is the case}} in the Iberian pig where 90 p. 100 of individuals show 10 teats. The estimation of genetic parameters for this discrete and strongly leptokurtic trait presents difficulties similar to those encountered in dichotomous ones, and several specific methods of estimation have been suggested, generally assuming the existence of an underlying normally distributed random variable. Heritability estimates of <b>teat</b> number, <b>based</b> on 30 271 animals of three strains of Iberian pig, have been obtained both using conventional correlation and regression methods and through 3 specific techniques proposed by RosExTSOrr, GI AN OLA and TALL IS. These methods allow one to estimate what proportion of the heritability of the assumed underlying variable (h 2) can be accounted for by the heritability estimated in the observed scale (h!). The estimated proportion ranged between 0. 30 and 0. 75 depending on the degree of canalization of the trait in the 3 different populations considered. The use of these specific methods, despite their interest, may present serious difficulties in practical breeding conditions...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{model was}} developed in rabbits to study bovine mastitis. Six lactating rabbits for each isolate were used to induce mastitis by using highly prevalent E. coli O 9 and O 147 isolates from bovine mastitis cases that possessed three different virulent genes. In the study, 104, 105, 106 and 107 cfu/ml of E. coli bacterial suspensions were inoculated in to each pair of <b>teats</b> via the <b>base</b> of the <b>teat</b> and to the first pair, 1 ml of PBS was administered. Gross lesions were recorded for 6 days post inoculation. Milk samples were collected from zero days, up to 144 hrs. Mastitis was induced as indicated {{by an increase in}} SCC, positivity with CMT and increase in total viable bacterial counts in milk. The macroscopic lesions were very well appreciated in all the infected quarters at 48 hrs post infection.

40|$|In studies {{designed}} to determine the factors responsible for control of herpesvirus replicaton in an infected cell, we examined the interaction of varicella-zoster (VZ) virus-infected human embryonic lung cells with the pesticide carbaryl. The replication of the cell-associated VZ virus was enhanced 2 - to 13 -fold as compared to control cultures in Sevin 4 Oil-treated cultures and in cultures treated with the pesticide's active ingredient, carbaryl. The replication of VZ virus in cultures <b>teated</b> with the <b>base</b> oil plus inert ingredients found in the pesticide formulation was not enhanced. Possible differences in cytotoxicity induced by Seven 4 Oil, pure carbaryl, or the base oil preparation were ruled out since treated and control cultures were shown to have similar numbers of viable cells when measured by trypan blue exclusion tests or by the ability of treated cells to form foci. A dose response study showed a decrease in viral enhancement in cells treated with decreasing carbaryl concentrations...|$|R
40|$|Teat {{disinfection}} pre- and post-milking {{is important}} for the overall health and hygiene of dairy cows. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the efficacy of a novel probiotic lactobacilli-based <b>teat</b> disinfectant <b>based</b> on changes in somatic cell count (SCC) and profiling of the bacterial community. A total of 69 raw milk samples were obtained from eleven Holstein-Friesian dairy cows over 12 days of teat dipping in China. Single molecule, real-time sequencing technology (SMRT) was employed to profile changes in the bacterial community during the cleaning protocol and to compare the efficacy of probiotic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and commercial teat disinfectants. The SCC gradually decreased following the cleaning protocol and the SCC of the LAB group was slightly lower than that of the commercial disinfectant (CD) group. Our SMRT sequencing results indicate that raw milk from both the LAB and CD groups contained diverse microbial populations that changed over the course of the cleaning protocol. The relative abundances of some species were significantly changed during the cleaning process, which may explain the observed bacterial community differences. Collectively, these results suggest that the LAB disinfectant could reduce mastitis-associated bacteria and improve the microbial environment of the cow teat. It could be used as an alternative to chemical pre- and post-milking teat disinfectants to maintain healthy teats and udders. In addition, the Pacific Biosciences SMRT sequencing with the full-length 16 S ribosomal RNA gene was shown to be a powerful tool for monitoring changes in the bacterial population during the cleaning protocol...|$|R
40|$|Winter {{conditions}} {{can lead to}} rapid dehydration and cracking of teat tissue, thus increasing mastitis risks. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the teat end health and skin conditioning performance of two experimental heptanoic acid <b>based</b> <b>teat</b> dips vs the commercial product Remain Gold ® using a split udder design during the winter season under best management winter milking practices. The experimental heptanoic acid teat dips KX- 6185 and KX- 6186 showed similar teat end health and teat skin conditioning to Remain Gold under winter conditions. Marked changes in teat end scores were measured over time and over periods as short as days. On the other hand, product treatment comparisons frequently showed parallel trends in score averages. This illustrates the importance of a split udder design to evaluate skin conditioning performance. The split udder design minimizes the risk of experimental bias due to cow and environmental factors. Most reported teat skin studies rely on comparing teat dips in separate cow groups with little consideration to group balancing even though factors such as hyperkeratosis is known to be affected by cow age and lactation stage. This study illustrates the high risk of traditional design skin toleration studies inaccurately attributing effects to teat dips...|$|R
40|$|Very {{little is}} known about the udder characteristics, {{partitioning}} of milk in the mammary gland and efficiency of machine milking in donkeys. This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of the udder and teats, milk yield in relation to pulsation rates (90, 120 and 150 cycles/min), milk partitioning in the mammary gland, composition of the spontaneously removed and residual milk fractions and milking efficiency. Forty-one healthy Martina Franca jennies in the third month of lactation and routinely milked twice daily were used in three studies. Udder characteristics were evaluated by direct measurements and ultrasonographic scanning. Residual milk was obtained by milking after an oxytocin administration (40 IU i. m.). The prevalent shapes were 'bowl' for udders and 'conical' for teats. After milking the udder characteristics decreased within a range from- 11 · 6 % (udder depth) to- 25 · 7 % (diameter of <b>teat</b> at the <b>base).</b> The internal structures of the udder resulted as several pockets of ducts empting directly into the teat. The pulsation rate of 120 cycles/min improved (P< 0 · 05) the milk yield in comparison to the 90 and 150 cycles/min, reduced the residual milk fraction, thus improved (P< 0 · 05) milking efficiency. Residual milk composition had higher (P< 0 · 05) fat content and somatic cell count than the spontaneously removed milk fraction. The udders revealed several pockets of ducts empting into the teat instead of a single cisternal cavity and showed a certain compliance. The use of 120 cycles/min pulsation rate improved milking efficiency...|$|R
40|$|In two experiments, {{the effect}} of {{applying}} hydrated lime as a cubicle bedding material on the microbial count on teat skin and new intramammary infection were evaluated. In experiment 1, dry dairy cows (n= 60) were {{assigned to one of}} three cubicle bedding treatments for a 5 week period. The treatments applied were: Hydrated lime (HL), HL (50 %) + Ground limestone (50 %) (HL/GL) and GL. In experiment 2, two teat disinfectants products chlorhexidine (CH) and iodine (I) were applied to teats at milking in conjunction with two cubicle bedding materials with lactating cows (n= 60) for a sixweek period. The treatments applied were: HLCH; HLI; and GLI. The HL treatment had significantly more teats (P< 0. 001) with no Staphylococcus spp. or Streptococcus spp. bacteria present compared to GL. There were no differences observed between treatments for California Mastitis Test (CMT) score at calving or somatic cell count (SCC) post-calving. In experiment two, the HLI treatment tended (P< 0. 08) to have lower bulk milk SCC than the GLI. The average bulk milk SCC over the trial period was 68, 000, 54, 000 and 83, 000 cells/mL for HLI, HLCH and GLI, respectively. The incidences of medium-term teat changes were numerically higher with HLI and there were no differences in the mean hyperkeratosis score between treatments. The mean teat hyperkeratosis scores on day 42 were 2. 2, 2. 1 and 2. 1 for HLI, HLCH and GLI, respectively. The HLI treatment had lower levels of Staphylococcal and Streptococcal bacteria on teats compared to GLI (P< 0. 001). Hydrated lime could be successfully used as cubicle bedding material for dairy cows if used at the recommended rates with either chlorhexidine or iodine <b>based</b> <b>teat</b> disinfectants. peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{decades of}} {{research}} and steady progress in control, mastitis {{remains one of the}} most economically important diseases of dairy cattle. The two main periods of high susceptibility to mastitis during the dry period are the first two or three weeks after drying-off and two weeks pre-calving. Dry-cow therapy (DCT), consisting of the use of long-acting antibiotics after the last milking of lactation, has been practiced since the 1960 s in order to eliminate existing intramammary infections and prevent new intramammary infections (IMI) during the dry period. The extensive use of antibiotics to treat and control mastitis has possible consequences for human health through an increased threat of emergence of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms that may enter the food chain. Non-antibiotic formulations for the treatment and prevention of mastitis have the potential to reduce the need for antibiotics. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of an external <b>teat</b> seal <b>based</b> on tetrahydrofuran (DryFlex (DF)) and a commercially available wound sealant for humans based on 2 -octylcyanoacrylate (Band-Aid (BA)) in protecting against mastitis caused by experimental challenge with Streptococcus ubcris after dry-off, under dairy farming conditions in New Zealand. Cows (175) with a somatic cell count (SCC) of less than 200, 000 SCC/ml, four functional quarters, and no signs of clinical mastitis or teat abnormalities were enrolled at dry-off. Single-quarter milk samples were taken for bacteriological culture, four days and one day before dry-off and again on two occasions within four days after calving. After the last milking before dry-off, 88 cows received DF and 87 cows received BA, with pairs of the contra-lateral quarters left front/right back (LF-RB) and right front/left back (RF-LB) assigned to the treatment or the untreated-control groups. All cows were challenged by experimental exposures by dipping all quarters in a bacterial broth of Streptococcus uberis (1. 27 x 108 cfu/ml and 1. 02 x 108 cfu/ml for the first and second experimental exposures, respectively), two and four days after dry-off. Subsequently, assessment for clinical mastitis was performed daily on all quarters. Individual quarters were observed and palpated for the presence of clinical signs consistent with mastitis, i. e., heat, swelling, a painful udder and if required, by an examination for the presence of clots and flakes in the secretions. Following bacterial challenge with Strep uberis, in the DF group, clinical mastitis developed in 35 of the treated quarters and 83 of the untreated quarters. The corresponding data for the BA group are 67 of the treated quarters and 64 of the untreated quarters. The incidence of mastitis was greatest between days 6 and 11 after dry-off for both groups. The risk of mastitis in the DF group was higher in control quarters than in the quarters treated with DF (RR: 2. 37, 95 % CI 1. 70 - 3. 32, P = 0. 000). There was no significant difference between the treated and untreated quarters in the BA group in the number of new clinical mastitis acquired during the dry period (RR: 0. 96, 95 % CI: 0. 73, 1. 25, P = 0. 74). Strep. uberis was the most prevalent bacterium on days 6 - 7 and from day 9 onwards, and it was detected in 160 (95 %) single-quarter milk samples. The use of pulscd-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) in a subset of isolates showed that 11 of 19 of the intramammary infections found between six and eleven days after dry-off (peak of infection) were caused by the challenge strain. DryFlex was visible on 50 % of the teat-ends for four days. The average number of days for which the teat-ends remained covered with DF was 5. 2 for all quarters. The experimental challenge model developed and used in this study appeared to be successful in generating intramammary infections during the dry period of dairy cows and proved a robust test of teat seals. The application of DryFlex at the end of lactation was beneficial in reducing mastitis in dairy cows after dry-off. The octylcyanoacrylate used in the present study showed no benefit in reducing the incidence of mastitis after dry-off when compared with quarters left untreated. It would appear from the results of this experiment that a teat seal of the DryFlex type would have a role to play in the prevention of mastitis during the early dry period. However, further work is required to improve the persistence of DryFlex on teats of non-lactating dairy cows...|$|R
