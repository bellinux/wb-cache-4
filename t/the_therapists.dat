25|$|The fourth mode {{of therapy}} {{is the use}} of a {{consultation}} team designed to support <b>the</b> <b>therapists.</b> These teams have several important functions including reducing therapist burnout, providing therapy for <b>the</b> <b>therapists,</b> improving empathy for clients and providing ongoing consultations for client difficulties.|$|E
25|$|A major {{criticism}} {{has been that}} clinical studies of CBT efficacy (or any psychotherapy) are not double-blind (i.e., either the subjects or <b>the</b> <b>therapists</b> in psychotherapy studies are not blind {{to the type of}} treatment). They may be single-blinded, i.e. the rater may not know the treatment the patient received, but neither the patients nor <b>the</b> <b>therapists</b> are blinded to the type of therapy given (two out of three of the persons involved in the trial, i.e., all of the persons involved in the treatment, are unblinded). The patient is an active participant in correcting negative distorted thoughts, thus quite aware of the treatment group they are in.|$|E
50|$|The Fairbairnian Object Relations {{therapist}} imagines {{that all}} {{interactions between the}} client and <b>the</b> <b>therapist</b> are occurring in the client's inner object relations world, {{in one of the}} three dyads. If the client thinks <b>the</b> <b>therapist</b> is wise and compassionate <b>the</b> <b>therapist</b> sees this as an interaction between the client's Libidinal Ego and Exciting Object. If the client is angry at <b>the</b> <b>therapist</b> for not meeting the client's needs, <b>the</b> <b>therapist</b> might see it as an interaction between the client's Antilibidinal Ego and the Bad Object. <b>The</b> <b>therapist</b> might ask <b>the</b> client if this particular interaction reminds the client of something from childhood.|$|R
50|$|The {{nature of}} reparenting often {{requires}} <b>the</b> <b>therapist</b> {{to develop a}} close relationship with the client. There is no protocol to provide the boundary as to what <b>the</b> <b>therapist</b> can or cannot do. Many a times, it is up to <b>the</b> <b>therapist</b> to determine <b>the</b> plan of action to take when faced with a dilemma during treatment. As a result, there is risk of <b>the</b> <b>therapist</b> becoming too extreme in their methods, which can endanger the client and lead to new psychological problems. Due to the dominant role of <b>the</b> <b>therapist</b> in <b>the</b> relationship, <b>the</b> <b>therapist</b> has greater power over <b>the</b> client. <b>Therapist</b> may abuse this authority and exploit the client. There is also risk toward <b>the</b> <b>therapist</b> in that he or she may become too attached to the client, which can hinder professional judgement.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Therapist</b> empathic understanding: <b>the</b> <b>therapist</b> {{experiences}} an empathic {{understanding of}} the client's internal frame of reference.

25|$|Psychedelic therapy {{involves}} the use of very high doses of psychedelic drugs, with the aim of promoting transcendental, ecstatic, religious or mystical peak experiences. Patients spend most of the acute period of the drug's activity lying down with eyeshades listening to nonlyrical music and exploring their inner experience. Dialogue with <b>the</b> <b>therapists</b> is sparse during the drug sessions but essential during psychotherapy sessions before and after the drug experience. There are two therapists, one man and one woman. The recent resurgence of research (see above) uses this method. It is more closely aligned to transpersonal psychology than to traditional psychoanalysis. Psychedelic therapy is practiced primarily in North America. The psychedelic therapy method was initiated by Humphry Osmond and Abram Hoffer (with some influence from Al Hubbard) and replicated by Keith Ditman.|$|E
25|$|Treadmill {{training}} (more {{commonly known}} as body weight supported treadmill training) can be applied via manual (therapist) or robotic assistance. In manual treadmill training <b>the</b> <b>therapists</b> provide assistance to facilitate an upright posture and a normal stepping pattern. Therapist assistance may be provided at the patient’s pelvis, leg and foot, and a third therapist controlling the treadmill settings. In robotic-assisted treadmill training, a device replaces the need for therapists to assist the patient in generating a normal stepping pattern. Currently, there are three different models available: Hocoma's Lokomat, the HealthSouth AutoAmbulator, and the Mechanized Gait Trainer II. The Lokomat is a driven gait orthosis that consists of a computer -controlled exoskeleton that secured to the patient’s legs while being supported over a treadmill. In addition to a belt driven treadmill and an overhead lift, the HealthSouth AutoAmbulator also includes a pair of articulated arms (that drives the hip and knee joints) and two upright structures that house the computer controls and body-weight unloading mechanism. Unlike the first two, the Mechanized Gait Trainer II does not work {{in conjunction with a}} treadmill; instead it is based on a crank and rocker gear system which provides limb motion similar to an elliptical trainer. Robotic-assisted treadmill training was developed with three goals in mind: 1. to decrease therapist physical demand and time, 2. to improve repeatability of step kinematics, and 3. to increase volume of locomotor training.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>therapist’s</b> {{structured}} {{focus on}} the patient’s feelings and defences creates complex feelings within the patient towards <b>the</b> <b>therapist,</b> called Complex Transference Feelings (CTF). The patient feels grateful to <b>the</b> <b>therapist</b> for his relentless efforts to free him from the suffering incurred through anxiety and defences while simultaneously feeling angry with <b>the</b> <b>therapist</b> for <b>the</b> relentless pressure and challenge to their long-held defensive system (Davanloo 1990, 2005).|$|R
5000|$|Firstly <b>the</b> <b>therapist</b> becomes 'non-verbally attuned' {{with the}} child's affective state. <b>The</b> <b>therapist</b> then {{attempts}} to explore 'themes' {{with the child}} whilst remaining attuned. Whilst this is done, <b>the</b> <b>therapist</b> then 'co-regulates' (helps the child to manage) the child's emerging affective states with 'matched vitality affect', and develops secondary affective/mental representations of them which is co-constructed with the child for purposes of integration (<b>the</b> <b>therapist</b> tries to help the child gain a coherent narrative about their experiences and {{an awareness of the}} positive aspects of themselves). According to Hughes [...] "The <b>therapist</b> allows <b>the</b> subjective experience of the child to impact <b>the</b> <b>therapist.</b> <b>The</b> <b>therapist</b> can then truly enter into that experience and from there express her/his own subjective experience. As <b>the</b> <b>therapist</b> holds both subjective experiences, the child experiences both. As the child senses both, the child begins to integrate them and re-experience the event {{in a way that will}} facilitate its integration and resolution." [...] In the anticipated frequent disruptions, due to the child's traumatic and shaming experiences, <b>the</b> <b>therapist</b> accepts and works with these and then 'repairs' the relationship.|$|R
500|$|Reich {{established}} the Orgonomic Infant Research Center (OIRC) in 1950, {{with the aim}} of preventing muscular armouring in children from birth. Meetings were held in the basement of his house in Forest Hills. Turner wrote that several children who were treated by OIRC therapists later said they had been sexually abused by <b>the</b> <b>therapists,</b> although not by Reich. One woman said she was assaulted by one of Reich's associates when she was five years old. Children were asked to stand naked in front of Reich and a group of 30 therapists in his basement, while Reich described the children's [...] "blockages." [...] Reich's daughter, Lore Reich Rubin, told Turner that she believed her father was an abuser, although she did not say she had been abused by him, and she acknowledged that she had no evidence. She believed that Reich himself had been abused as a child, which is why he developed such an interest in sex and childhood sexuality.|$|E
2500|$|Music therapy {{intervention}} programs can include {{an average of}} 18 sessions of treatment. The achievement of a physical rehabilitation goal relies on the child's existing motivation and feelings towards music and their commitment to engage in meaningful, rewarding efforts. Regaining full functioning also confides in the prognosis of recovery, {{the condition of the}} client, and the environmental resources available. [...] Both techniques use systematic processes where <b>the</b> <b>therapists</b> assist the client by using musical experiences and connections that collaborate as a dynamic force of change toward rehabilitation.|$|E
2500|$|Foster Cline and {{associates}} at the Attachment Center at Evergreen, Colorado began {{to promote the}} use of the same or similar holding techniques with adopted, maltreated children who were said to have an [...] "attachment disorder". This was replicated elsewhere such as at [...] "The Center" [...] in the Pacific Northwest. A number of other clinics arose in Evergreen, Colorado, set up by those involved in or trained at the Attachment Center at Evergreen (renamed the Institute for Attachment and Development in about 2002). These included one set up by Connell Watkins, formerly an associate of Foster Cline at the Attachment Center and its clinical director. Watkins was one of <b>the</b> <b>therapists</b> convicted in the Candace Newmaker case in 2001 in which a child was asphyxiated during a rebirthing process {{in the course of a}} two-week attachment therapy [...] "intensive". Foster Cline gave up his license and moved to another state following an investigation of a separate attachment therapy related incident.|$|E
5000|$|Transference can be {{described}} as the client's distorted perceptions of <b>the</b> <b>therapist.</b> This can have a great effect on the therapeutic relationship. For instance, <b>the</b> <b>therapist</b> may have a facial feature that reminds the client of their parent. Because of this association, if the client has significant negative or positive feelings toward their parent, they may project these feelings onto <b>the</b> <b>therapist.</b> This can affect the therapeutic relationship in a few ways. For example, if the client has a very strong bond with their parent, they may see <b>the</b> <b>therapist</b> as a father or mother figure and have a strong connection with <b>the</b> <b>therapist.</b> This can be problematic because as a therapist, it is not ethical to have a more than [...] "professional" [...] relationship with a client. It can also be a good thing, because the client may open up greatly to <b>the</b> <b>therapist.</b> In another way, if the client has a very negative relationship with their parent, the client may feel negative feelings toward <b>the</b> <b>therapist.</b> This can then affect the therapeutic relationship as well. For example, the client may have trouble opening up to <b>the</b> <b>therapist</b> because he or she lacks trust in their parent (projecting these feelings of distrust onto <b>the</b> <b>therapist).</b>|$|R
30|$|Stage 2 : Pressure (Davanloo 1999 c). Once {{the patient}} begins to resist <b>the</b> <b>therapist’s</b> {{attempts}} to understand, <b>the</b> <b>therapist</b> applies {{pressure to the}} patient’s feelings or defences to overcome defences sufficiently to allow <b>the</b> <b>therapist</b> and patient to understand the problem (Abbass and Town 2013).|$|R
5000|$|Kelly {{acknowledged}} that both <b>the</b> <b>therapist</b> and patient would each bring a {{unique set of}} constructs to bear in the consulting room. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>therapist</b> could never be completely [...] "objective" [...] in construing his or her client's world. <b>The</b> effective <b>therapist</b> was, however, one who construed the patient's material at a high level of abstraction within the patient's (as opposed to <b>the</b> <b>therapist's)</b> system of construction. <b>The</b> <b>therapist</b> could then comprehend {{the ways in which the}} patient saw the world that were disordered and help the patient to change his or her maladaptive constructs.|$|R
2500|$|Cognitive {{behavioral}} {{therapy is}} most closely {{allied with the}} scientist–practitioner model in which clinical practice and research is informed by a scientific perspective, clear operationalization of the problem, and an emphasis on measurement, including measuring changes in cognition and behavior and in the attainment of goals. These are often met through [...] "homework" [...] assignments in which {{the patient and the}} therapist work together to craft an assignment to complete before the next session. The completion of these assignments– which {{can be as simple as}} a person suffering from depression attending some kind of social event– indicates a dedication to treatment compliance and a desire to change. <b>The</b> <b>therapists</b> can then logically gauge the next step of treatment based on how thoroughly the patient completes the assignment. Effective cognitive behavioral therapy is dependent on a therapeutic alliance between the healthcare practitioner and the person seeking assistance. Unlike many other forms of psychotherapy, the patient is very involved in CBT. For example, an anxious patient may be asked to talk to a stranger as a homework assignment, but if that is too difficult, he or she can work out an easier assignment first. The therapist needs to be flexible and willing to listen to the patient rather than acting as an authority figure.|$|E

5000|$|IBCT {{consists}} of two major phases, an evaluation/feedback phase and an active treatment phase. The first three sessions consist of an evaluation period where <b>the</b> <b>therapist</b> learns about <b>the</b> concerns of the couple. In the first session, <b>the</b> <b>therapist</b> usually sees both partners together, learns what brings the couple to therapy, and obtains {{a brief history of}} their relationship. <b>The</b> <b>therapist</b> may suggest couples read a self-help book during treatment that serves as a guideline for IBCT therapy. Also during this first session, <b>the</b> <b>therapist</b> normally gives each partner some questionnaires to complete and bring to their individual sessions, which are the next two sessions. In these individual sessions, <b>the</b> <b>therapist</b> explores each partner's relationship concerns and individual history. In the fourth session, <b>the</b> <b>therapist</b> sees both partners together for the [...] "feedback session." [...] <b>The</b> <b>therapist</b> may gather some final information {{in the beginning of the}} session, but most of the session is devoted to feedback from <b>the</b> <b>therapist,</b> in which he or she describes the couple's difficulties and strengths and how therapy will try to assist the couple. A major part of the feedback session is <b>the</b> <b>therapist's</b> formulation of <b>the</b> couple's problems, a conceptualization of the major themes in the couple's struggles, the understandable reasons why the couple has these struggles, how their efforts to resolve the struggles so often fail, and how therapy can help.
