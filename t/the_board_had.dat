5|$|At first, CBS {{refused to}} pay Larson, {{considering}} him a cheater. However, Brockman and the producers {{could not find a}} clause in the game's rules with which to disqualify him (largely because <b>the</b> <b>board</b> <b>had</b> been constructed with these patterns {{from the beginning of the}} series), and the network complied. Because he had surpassed the CBS winnings cap (at the time) of $25,000, Larson was not allowed to return for the next show.|$|E
5|$|In November 2005, the Kansas State Board of Education {{voted to}} allow criticisms of evolution, {{including}} language about intelligent design, {{as part of}} testing standards. On February 13, 2007, the board voted 6–4 to reject the amended science standards enacted in 2005. This was the fifth time in eight years that <b>the</b> <b>board</b> <b>had</b> rewritten the standards on evolution.|$|E
5|$|Sterling Airways came in {{as a new}} {{strategic}} minority owner, and the two airlines {{started an}} alliance along with Transwede. Their key goal was to secure concessions to fly between the Scandinavian capital cities of Oslo, Stockholm and Copenhagen, but no permission was ever granted. Instead Norway Airlines started its own service between Oslo and London. Operations ceased on 14 October 1992 after <b>the</b> <b>board</b> <b>had</b> filed for bankruptcy.|$|E
50|$|Much of the {{background}} work of <b>the</b> National Science <b>Board</b> is done through its committees.

5|$|In {{the general}} election, Taylor secured just 2,383 more votes than Goebel. The Democrat-controlled General Assembly {{challenged}} the election results. Under the Goebel Election Law, a three-man Board of Elections (dominated by Democrats) were {{to review the}} results and certify the winner in the contest. Two {{of the members of}} <b>the</b> <b>board</b> <b>had</b> openly campaigned for Goebel, and all three owed their appointments to him, but in a surprising decision, the board voted 2—1 to certify Taylor as the winner.|$|E
5|$|The Army Service Forces was {{abolished}} on 14 May 1946, on {{the recommendation}} of War Department's Simpson Board, but the Army Ground Forces remained. Devers' November 1945 testimony before <b>the</b> <b>board</b> <b>had</b> urged that the Army Service Forces be retained. Army Ground Forces was given control of the six armies in the United States, but as demobilization gathered pace, the strength of the army shrank dramatically. Devers was faced with the unpleasant task of informing many officers that they were being demoted. One reform that he did achieve was {{to reduce the number of}} combat branches to just three: infantry, armor and artillery.|$|E
5|$|The case of Ellis v. Dubowski (1921) {{lays down}} the {{principle}} {{that there can be}} no delegation of authority to an absolute body from which no right of appeal exists. In this case, a licensing committee exercising statutory powers to license cinemas to be used for film screenings had imposed a condition in a licence that films had to be certified by the British Board of Film Censors before they could be shown. This was found to be ultra vires because the Board should not be made the final dictator. Furthermore, the fact that <b>the</b> <b>Board</b> <b>had</b> been given absolute power to prohibit films for reasons which might be private or influenced by trade considerations was sufficient to render the condition ultra vires.|$|E

5|$|The verdict (8 November 2013) and {{sentence}} (6 December 2013) {{were both}} {{delivered at the}} Military Court Centre in Bulford, Wiltshire. The judge advocate (the civilian judge heading the panel at a court-martial) was Judge Advocate General Jeff Blackett. The verdict carried with it a mandatory life sentence, so {{it was only in}} the judge advocate's and court-martial board's power to decide on the minimum sentence once <b>the</b> <b>board</b> <b>had</b> found Blackman guilty. He was sentenced to a minimum of 10 years in prison. On 22 May 2014, at the Courts Martial Appeal Court, its most senior judge, Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, upheld the life sentence, but reduced Blackman's minimum term to 8 years.|$|E
5|$|Responsibility for {{the river}} has resided {{with a number of}} legal bodies in the past. The first was the Rother Levels Commissioners of Sewers, who were {{established}} by letters patent issued under the provisions of the Statute of Sewers dated 1531. The lower river was also covered by the Rye Harbour Commissioners, after they were established by Act of Parliament in 1731. In 1872, the Board of Conservators for the River Rother was created to manage and protect stocks of fish in the river. As in many parts of Britain, the rights and duties of these various bodies competed and overlapped, and by the early twentieth century, the situation was chaotic. An attempt to resolve the confusion was made in 1930, with the passing of the Land Drainage Act 1930, under which 47 catchment areas were established, and a Catchment Board was then created for each one, with overall responsibility for that area. Thus the Rother and Jury's Gut Catchment Board was created. While <b>the</b> <b>board</b> <b>had</b> overall responsibility, local management of rivers and drainage was under the control of Internal Drainage Boards, and the transition was eased by reconstituting Commissioners of Sewers as Internal Drainage Boards, {{under the terms of the}} act.|$|E

25|$|After {{successfully}} introducing diesel {{buses to}} its {{operation in the}} mid-1930s, <b>the</b> <b>Board</b> <b>had</b> hoped to phase out its older petrol-powered vehicles and focus on diesels, both for new routes and as required to replace trams. With the onset of World War 2, the supply of diesel-powered vehicles dried up and the only option for augmenting the fleet was the Fords, which eventually numbered 41 in service to the Board.|$|E
25|$|It was Mayor Westervelt's stated aim to {{sort out}} the bad seed. In 1853 an {{administrative}} body was created, called the Board of Police Commissioners, consisting of Mayor Westervelt, the recorder and the city judge.

25|$|As {{an earlier}} attempt to acquire diesel buses had been thwarted by the war, <b>the</b> <b>Board</b> <b>had</b> {{to settle for}} {{purchasing}} petrol buses after the war owing to the shortage of diesel vehicles. This enabled the commencement of new services in 1946 to areas {{not covered by the}} tramway network including Mount Pleasant, Somerfield, Creyke Road, Huntsbury, Wharenui, and Sanatorium on the Cashmere Hills.
