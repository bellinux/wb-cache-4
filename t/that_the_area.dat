5|$|An early type of axe {{known as}} a palstave has been {{discovered}} on Crompton Moor, providing evidence of Bronze Age human activity. It is believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> was inhabited by Ancient Britons, and that the Brigantes gave the River Beal its name. An ancient track, perhaps of Roman origin, crosses the modern Buckstones Road leading to Castleshaw Roman fort in neighbouring Saddleworth.|$|E
5|$|Analysis {{of antiquities}} related to {{skeletal}} remains revealed 12 species of domesticated and wild animals: cattle, buffaloes (Bubalisbubalis linn), sheep (Ovis aries), cheetal (Axis axis), barasinga, pig, elephant, rhinoceros, cheetal (Axis axia), dog, a carp and {{two types of}} turtles. Bones of birds and fish were also found. Faunal finds indicate <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> was forested over an undulating topography.|$|E

5|$|Archaeological {{findings}} in the fields between West and East Worldham reveal <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> has been visited and inhabited {{since at least the}} Palaeolithic era. An Iron Age Hillfort, dated to around 100 BC, lay on the summit of King John's Hill, to the east of East Worldham. The Romans built a road from Chichester to Silchester which passed below the hill over what is now Green Street and Pookles Lane.|$|E
5|$|Burial mounds {{in present-day}} Indian Mounds Park suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> was {{originally}} inhabited by the Hopewell Native Americans about {{two thousand years}} ago. From the early 17th century until 1837, the Mdewakanton Dakota, a tribe of the Sioux, lived near the mounds after fleeing their ancestral home of Mille Lacs Lake from advancing Ojibwe. They called the area I-mni-za ska dan ("little white rock") for its exposed white sandstone cliffs.|$|E
5|$|Chipped {{stone tools}} found at Zemun show <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> around Belgrade was {{inhabited}} by nomadic foragers in the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic eras. Some of these tools {{belong to the}} Mousterian industry, which are associated with Neanderthals rather than modern humans. Aurignacian and Gravettian tools have also been discovered there, indicating occupation between 50,000 and 20,000 years ago.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, {{intersection}} of Highway 33 and Prince Edward County Road 1 (Scoharie Road) near Picton saw {{the introduction of}} a traffic roundabout, the first ever constructed on a provincial highway in the province, to replace the at-grade intersection. The MTO felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> had reached its operational threshold due to high tourist and recreational activity, particularly during the busy summer months, and so felt a traffic roundabout was needed.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} the voyage of Henry Hudson, an Englishman who worked for the Dutch East India Company, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> was mapped.

5|$|Volcanic eruptions are {{not known}} to have {{occurred}} from the Anahim hotspot in historical times.

5|$|A {{number of}} Anglo-Saxon {{charters}} document {{the incorporation of}} areas of moor in estates, suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> continued to be exploited.

According to legend, Alfred the Great burnt cakes when hiding in the marshes of Athelney, after the Danish invasion in 875. After the battle of Edington the Danish king was baptised at Aller and a peace treaty signed at Wedmore.|$|E

5|$|An acute {{shortage}} of housing {{after the fall}} of the Communist regime in 1990 led some Albanians to set up home in abandoned bunkers, though the lack of running water and sanitation meant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> around inhabited bunkers soon became contaminated and unhealthy.

In the coastal city of Durrës one beachside bunker has been turned into the Restaurant Bunkeri, and another bunker in Gjirokastër was turned into a café.|$|E
5|$|Archæological {{evidence}} from the Birrigai rock shelter in Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve indicates habitation dating back at least 21,000 years. It is possible <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> was inhabited for considerably longer, with evidence of an Aboriginal presence in south-western New South Wales dating back around 40,000–62,000 years. Another site of significance in the reserve is the Bogong Rocks shelter, which contains the oldest evidence of Aboriginal occupation at a bogong moth resting site. These insects were {{an important source of}} food for the Aboriginal peoples of the Southern Alps and would accumulate by the thousands in caves and rock crevices, where they were collected and later roasted in sand or ashes, and then eaten whole.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} earlier {{construction}} of nearby Battersea Bridge, during excavations workers found large quantities of Roman and Celtic weapons and skeletons in the riverbed, leading many historians to conclude <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> {{was the site of}} Julius Caesar's crossing of the Thames during the 54 BC invasion of Britain.
