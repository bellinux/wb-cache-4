50|$|A through hole, also <b>thru-hole</b> or {{clearance}} hole, {{refers to}} a hole that is reamed, drilled, milled etc., completely through the material of an object. In other words, a through hole is a hole that {{goes all the way}} through something. This is to distinguish it from a blind hole, which does not go {{all the way through the}} material of the object.|$|E
50|$|Before the {{original}} line up dissolving, Densky and Saucier performed live to help promote {{the release of}} Intricate Unit's second full-length album, Detached. Detached also had subsequent releases entitled, Detached (Detached). This latter album contained completely remixed and remastered songs with bonus tracks that would eventually appear on <b>Thru-Hole.</b> The cover of this album is a picture that Kopec edited himself of an ex-girlfriends bathroom tub after she died her hair red.|$|E
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{is directed}} to a process of a method for the full metallization of thru-holes in a polymer structure comprising the steps of applying a film-forming amount of a conductive polymer-metal composite paste to a metal cathode; bonding a patterned polymer structure to said paste; subjecting said polymer structure to an electrolytic plating bath for a time sufficient to fully metallize <b>thru-hole</b> surfaces in said patterned polymer structure and removing the structure from the cathode assembly. The fully metallized <b>thru-hole</b> polymer structure can then be cleaned and polished to produce a finished product...|$|E
50|$|They {{can be used}} {{discretely}} as a signal/ground contact or for Electromagnetic interference (EMI) protection. When {{a specific}} mating array is needed, Fuzz Buttons can be placed in <b>thru-holes</b> in an insulated piece of material, such as dielectric plastic.|$|R
50|$|Laser {{drilling}} is {{the process}} of creating <b>thru-holes,</b> referred to as “popped” holes or “percussion drilled” holes, by repeatedly pulsing focused laser energy on a material. The diameter of these holes can be as small as 0.002”. If larger holes are required, the laser is moved around the circumference of the “popped” hole until the desired diameter is created; this technique is called “trepanning”.|$|R
50|$|For {{the past}} century, Lake Cochichewick has been North Andover's main supply of {{drinking}} water and public access to the lake was forbidden. In May 2002, however, the town began issuing boating permits: Certain watercraft are allowed and must be designed to be manually propelled, by oars or paddles. Rowing shells, johnboats, dinghies, rowboats, canoes and kayaks are acceptable {{as long as the}} occupants are isolated from contact with the lake. Boats must not have any <b>thru-holes</b> (e.g. self-bailers) that would allow contact between the occupants and the lake water. Electric motors are acceptable as an alternate form of propulsion. The maximum length of a motorized craft is 15 feet. Inflatable boats, windsurfers and seaplanes are not allowed. No domestic animals are allowed to be in boats, on the ice, or in the water at any time.|$|R
40|$|Many {{downhole}} instrumentation tools manufacture today utilizing {{organic material}} packaging technology for producing electronic modules. Such approach with organic PCB, standard packaged discrete semiconductor and SMT-type passive components has limited the device {{operating temperature range}} in 177 ºC area. An alternative packaging approach is to utilize Hybrid Microelectronics Technology to increase the operating temperature limit up to 225 ºC in production environment. Besides performance improvements on upper operating temperature limit, thermal cycling, high frequency shock and vibration, based on our customer’s reliability testing data, hermetically sealed high-temperature Hybrid module’s survivability can exceed over 7000 hours of MTTF at 225 ºC high temperature storage condition along with other environmental matrix testing. Moreover, comparing with high-temperature SMT and <b>Thru-hole</b> Technologies, Hybrid Microcircuit increases packaging density and provides valuable real estate saving. Vectron International has successfully utilized Hybrid Technology to manufacture thousands of hi-temperature electronic module for 200 ºC to 225 ºC applications. This paper describes the packaging design of a 225 ºC hi-temp electronic module for down-hole application using such technology. This paper will also touch bases on material selection, fabrication technique and some reliability data of this high-temperature Hybrid module...|$|E
40|$|Selective {{soldering}} is {{a process}} for soldering <b>thru-hole</b> components on the bottom side of an assembly. In a selective soldering process a robot system is used {{to pick up the}} assembly and drag it over a single point select wave, or dip the assembly into multiple nozzles that are mounted on a product specific nozzle plate. In contrast, the soldering process utilizing traditional wave soldering equipment consists of transporting the entire assembly, by means of a conveyor system, over a liquid solder wave. The implementation of lead-free alloys will affect the thermal load of components and board material due to higher process temperatures. Not all of the components can withstand the high temperatures that they may be exposed to during wave and reflow processes. For this reason selective soldering becomes interesting since in this process only the areas that come into contact with the lead-free solder will reach higher temperatures while other sections and components remain significantly below critical temperature levels. This paper focuses on the effects of board surface finishes and selective soldering process parameters such as drag speed and solderpot temperatures, on the formation and strength of the solder joints. The analysis shows that the process development and material selection should be optimized per component type. This work was accomplished within the scope of the NEMI Lead Fre...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} design, fabrication, {{and testing of}} a microfluidic system {{to be used for}} whole-cell analysis. The study of cellular function and structure is essential for disease diagnosis and treatment. Microsystems developed to perform these bioanalyses add benefits such as requiring smaller samples and reagents, testing multiple samples in parallel, and supporting point-of-care testing, all of which increases throughput and reduces cost-per-analysis. Traditional methods for designing a microsystem use standard materials and techniques such as silicon, glass, photolithography, and wet and dry etching. This research is focused on utilizing materials and techniques that require less infrastructure, allow for a faster design-to-prototype cycle, and can integrate electrical and fluidic functionality to address a variety of possible applications. The microfluidic system presented in this thesis is comprised of multiple layers of Kapton, a polyimide available from DuPont. Kapton provides a biocompatible substrate that is flexible while maintaining structural stability and can be used in high temperature and other harsh environments. Microchannels with widths of 400 m and <b>thru-hole</b> fluidic vias less than 5 m in diameter are laser ablated through the flexible polyimide sheets using excimer and CO 2 lasers. Electrical traces and contact pads are defined on the substrate by vapor deposition through reusable microstencils rather than with photolithography. The patterned layers are bonded using heat staking and then packaged with the addition of wires and a fluidic interface. Validation of the system for whole-cell analysis was first performed with impedance spectroscopy measurements collected on air, DI water, phosphate buffered saline, clusters of human cancer cells, and human cancer tissue samples. This was followed by testing the ability to use the device to control the movement and position of 10 m diameter microbeads and dissociated cells. As a whole, this research demonstrates the realization of a microfluidic system for whole-cell analysis based on non-standard fabrication materials and techniques. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Frazier, A.

40|$|Patterns on {{real-world}} {{objects are}} often due to variations in geometry across the surface. Height fields and other common parametric methods cannot synthesize {{many forms of}} geometric surface texture such as thorns, scales, and bark. We present an example-based technique for synthesizing a variety of geometric textures on a model’s surface. The applied textures can be from models specifically created for this purpose, or may be drawn from user-specified regions of an example model. We extend existing neighborhood-based texture synthesis algorithms to operate on volumetric models. Similar to image analogies [11], given a training pair of unfiltered and filtered source models and an unfiltered destination model (all volumetric grids), we synthesize a filtered fourth model that exhibits the desired geometric texture. The user defines vector fields to specify the direction of texture anisotropy on the source and destination models. The vector field defines a coordinate frame on the destination object’s surface {{that is used to}} sample the voxel density values in the neighborhood near a given voxel, which then gives a feature vector that is matched to the neighborhoods in the source model. Destination voxels are visited in an order that is dictated by the vector field. We show geometric synthesis results on a variety of models using textures such as pits, grooves, <b>thru-holes</b> and thorns. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of the characteristic band edge frequencies of three different 500 -GHz electromagnetic-bandgap crystals to systematic variations in unit cell dimensions has been analyzed. The structures studied were square bar woodpiles made with dielectric having epsiv rap 12 and epsivr= 37. 5 and two wide bandgap epsivr= 37. 5 crystals designs proposed by Fan and Johnson and Joannopoulos. These epsivr values correspond to high-resistivity silicon and a zirconium-tin-titanate ceramic, respectively. For the woodpiles, the fractional frequency bandgap varied very little for dimensional deviations of up to plusmn 5 % from the optimum. The bandgaps of the Fan and Johnson and Joannopoulos structures were affected {{to a greater extent}} by dimensional variations, particular sensitivity being exhibited to the air-hole radius. For all crystals, the effect of increasing the amount of dielectric in the unit cell was to shift the bandgap edges to lower frequencies. Both silicon and ceramic woodpiles, along with a ceramic Fan structure, were fabricated and dimensionally characterized. Mechanical processing with a semiconductor dicing saw was used to form the woodpiles, while the Fan structure required both dicing and UV laser drilling of circular <b>thru-holes.</b> Good agreement with predicted normal incidence transmissions were found on the low-frequency side of the bandgap in all cases, but transmission values above the upper band edge were lower than expected in the ceramic structure...|$|R
