5000|$|Under QBS, {{the owner}} would {{publicly}} advertise a project and describe it in significant detail in a published [...] "Request for Qualifications" [...] (RFQ). <b>The</b> <b>RFQ</b> should contain selection criteria explicitly {{in order for}} firms to judge the likelihood of being selected.

50|$|A Request for Quotation (RFQ) is {{used when}} discussions with bidders are not {{required}} (mainly when the specifications of a product or service are already known) and when price is the main or only factor in selecting the successful bidder. An RFQ may also be used prior to issuing a full-blown RFP to determine general price ranges. In this scenario, products, services or suppliers may be selected from <b>the</b> <b>RFQ</b> results to bring in to further research in order to write a more fully fleshed out RFP.|$|E
5000|$|The process usually {{starts with}} a demand or {{requirements}} - this could be for a physical part (inventory) or a service. [...] A requisition is generated, which details the requirements (in some cases providing a requirements specification) which actions the procurement department.

Suppliers send their quotations in response to <b>the</b> <b>RFQ,</b> and a review is undertaken where the best offer (typically based on price, availability and quality) is given the purchase order.|$|E

40|$|At the Max-Planck-Institut für Kernphysik in Heidelberg the new High Current Injector is {{presently}} {{being put into}} operation. In its first phase the injector consist of a high current ion source for singly charged ions, two RFQ- and eight 7 -gap-resonators. In this phase preferably Li- and Be-beams will be accelerated to an energy of 1. 8 MeV/u with intensities up to 3 orders of magnitude higher than with the present tandem-postaccelerator-combination. All res-onators operate at a frequency of 108. 48 MHz with a high duty cycle up to 25 % at a maximum power consumption of 80 kW per cavity.

50|$|A {{request for}} {{qualifications}} (RFQ) {{is a step}} sometimes used in the formal process of procuring a product or service, for example by a government agency.

In this two-step process, the response to <b>the</b> <b>RFQ</b> will describe the company or individual's general qualifications to perform a service or supply a product but generally will not include specific details or price proposals.|$|E
5000|$|The {{quadrupole}} mass analyzer (a {{radio frequency}} quadrupole {{used as a}} mass filter) was invented by Wolfgang Paul in the late 1950s to early 60s at the University of Bonn, Germany. Paul shared the 1989 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work. Samples for mass analysis are ionized, for example by laser (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization) or discharge (electrospray or inductively coupled plasma) and the resulting beam is sent through <b>the</b> <b>RFQ</b> and [...] "filtered" [...] by scanning the operating parameters (chiefly the RF amplitude). This gives a mass spectrum, or fingerprint, of the sample. Residual gas analyzers use this principle as well.|$|E

50|$|Cooling these ion beams, {{particularly}} radioactive ion beams, {{has been}} shown to drastically improve the accuracy and sensitivity of mass measurements by reducing the phase space of the ion collections in question. Using a light neutral background gas, typically helium, charged particles originating from on-line mass separators undergo a number of soft collisions with the background gas molecules resulting in fractional losses of the ions’ kinetic energy and a reduction of the ion ensemble’s overall energy. In order for this to be effective however, the ions need to be contained using transverse radiofrequency quadrupole (RFQ) electric fields during the collisional cooling process (also known as buffer gas cooling). These RFQ coolers operate on the same principles as quadrupole ion traps and {{have been shown to be}} particularly well suited for buffer gas cooling given their capacity for total confinement of ions having a large dispersion of velocities, corresponding to kinetic energies up to tens of electron volts. A number of <b>the</b> <b>RFQ</b> coolers have already been installed at research facilities around the world and a list of their characteristics can be found below.|$|E
5000|$|Once {{the project}} has been defined, but before much of the {{engineering}} work has been completed, {{it may be necessary}} to choose an ESCO by putting the project “out to bid”. This is usually the case when the client has developed the project on his or her own or is required to allow others to bid on the work as required by the government. The latter is the case on any state or federally funded project. The typical process includes a Request for qualifications (RFQ) in which the interested ESCO’s submit their corporate resumes, business profiles, experience, and initial plan. Once received, the client creates a “short list” of 3-5 companies. This list is of the companies whose profile for the project best matches with the owners’ ideas in <b>the</b> <b>RFQ.</b> The client then asks for a Request for Proposal (RFP) that is a much more detailed explanation of the project. This document contains all cost savings measures, products, M & V plans, and the performance contract.

Once submitted, the Proposals are then reviewed by the client, who may conduct interviews with the applicants. The client then selects the ESCO that presents the best possible solution to the energy project, as determined by the client.
