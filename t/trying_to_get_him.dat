5|$|At dinner, Lord Tywin {{tells his}} son Tyrion that Tyrion and his barbarian allies will {{fight in the}} vanguard of the army. Tyrion {{suspects}} his father is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> killed. Tyrion returns to his camp and finds the prostitute Shae whom Bronn found for him at Tyrion's request. As the three of them swap stories, Tyrion reveals that, when he was 16, he married a woman named Tysha whom Jaime and he had rescued. When his father Tywin learned of this, he made Jaime confess that Tysha was actually a hired prostitute. Tywin then made Tyrion watch as Lannister guardsmen all had sex with her, each paying her one silver coin provided by Lord Tywin.|$|E
5|$|Preparations for {{the race}} were overshadowed by {{speculation}} over IndyCar CEO Randy Bernard's job, after he tweeted that some team owners were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> fired. Dixon claimed pole position {{for the race}}, the first IndyCar event in Detroit since 2008, and maintained his lead throughout the race. After 38 laps, James Hinchcliffe hit a dislodged piece of the track and continued straight into the tire wall. Further investigation discovered that the track was disintegrating in various places, and the event was red flagged. After a two-hour break, in which track officials ripped out the damaged sections of track and filled the holes with concrete, the race was restarted, shortened to 60 laps. Rain also started to fall lightly, and shortly after the restart a caution was issued when Hélio Castroneves spun. Dario Franchitti gained four places after the red flag, benefiting from his softer red tires, to finish second behind his teammate.|$|E

25|$|The battle {{itself was}} smaller in scale when {{compared}} to the Battle of Ticinus. Although Fabius was not duped by Hannibal’s moves, his blocking force at the pass was. Leonard Cottrell, in his book “Hannibal: Enemy of Rome", wrote that the trick was designed to be recognized by Fabius as a trick. Hannibal had studied the mind of his opponent, and devised a plan to make him do exactly what Hannibal needed him to do. Fabius thought Hannibal was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> to fight a night action over broken, uneven ground, where Roman infantry would lose their greatest advantages of discipline and teamwork, as their formations would become disorganized. Since Hannibal was choosing the battle ground and the hour, he might have sprung other surprises to gain further advantages on the Romans. Fabius predictably did what Hannibal had anticipated: nothing. The Romans guarding the pass, with no Fabius to keep them in check, thought they were doing their job when they rushed out, preventing a Carthaginian escape. Again, they acted as Hannibal had anticipated, and the Carthaginians took advantage of their actions to escape.|$|E
25|$|Baker {{attempted}} an unorthodox {{deployment of}} his late-inning relievers in an August 24 rubber {{game against the}} Houston Astros in interleague play, sending out Doolittle for the eighth and Kintzler for the ninth. Both relievers struggled, with Doolittle allowing a run before Kintzler allowed two, blowing the save opportunity. The Nationals ultimately won {{the game and the}} series 5–4 in the eleventh inning, with Solis earning the save, the first of his career. Baker explained after the game that he had been attempting to play matchups, using Doolittle against left-handed batters in the eighth before Kintzler handled Houston's right-handed batters in the ninth; Kintzler, however, said the Nationals were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> to 30 saves on the season, after he had collected 28 with the Twins prior to being traded at the end of July. Upon returning to Washington, D.C., on August 25, the Nationals optioned Severino to Syracuse and recalled Cole for a spot start against the division rival New York Mets, in which Cole took the loss despite allowing only one run over six innings and setting a new personal best for strikeouts with eight in what ended as a 4–2 Mets victory. In a harrowing moment in the eighth inning of the next game in the series on August 26, a 9–4 bounceback victory for Washington, Nationals second baseman Adrián Sánchez was felled by a foul tip into the chest after trying to bunt away a 97-mph fastball from Mets reliever Jeurys Familia that sailed in on him. Sánchez was able to finish out his at-bat, driving home a run with a single into left field for his third RBI of the day, before being pulled from the game and hospitalized overnight for observation and testing. Sánchez was released in the morning after a CT test determined he had escaped serious injury. Cole was optioned back to the minors on August 27, as outfielder Rafael Bautista was recalled and Fedde was brought up as the 26th man for a day-night doubleheader against the Mets. The Nationals split the doubleheader, losing the first game — displaying diminished velocity and giving up five runs on two home runs, Fedde took a no-decision as the Nationals rallied back from a five-run deficit only to lose 6–5, as pinch-runner Edwin Jackson was thrown out at home plate {{in the bottom of the}} ninth inning to end the game — and winning the second 5–4 behind a quality start from Tanner Roark and a go-ahead RBI by Stevenson, the first of his career, on a bases-loaded walk.|$|E
