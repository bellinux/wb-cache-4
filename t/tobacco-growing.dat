25|$|Running from Zonguldak in {{the west}} to Rize in the east, the narrow coastal strip widens at several places into fertile, {{intensely}} cultivated deltas. The Samsun area, close to the midpoint, is a major <b>tobacco-growing</b> region; east of it are numerous citrus groves. East of Samsun, the area around Trabzon is world-renowned for the production of hazelnuts, and farther east the Rize region has numerous tea plantations. All cultivable areas, including mountain slopes wherever they are not too steep, are sown or used as pasture. The mild, damp climate of the Black Sea coast makes commercial farming profitable. The western part of the Black Sea region, especially the Zonguldak area, is a center of coal mining and heavy industry.|$|E

2500|$|The Catalan Don Jaime Partagás y Ravelo (Arenys de Mar, 1816 - Vuelta abajo, Cuba, 1868) {{was the son}} of Jaume Partagás (tailor) and Teresa Ravelo. He {{migrated}} to Cuba in 1831 and worked for Lloret de Mar businessman, Joan Conill in Havana. Establishing his own factory, La Flor de Tabacas de Partagás in 1845, at 1 Cristina St. in Havana (later relocated to Calle Industria), Don Jaime owned many of the best plantations in the Vuelta Abajo <b>tobacco-growing</b> region of Cuba. Don Jaime's ability to choose from among the finest tobaccos on the island, and an instinct for blending and fermenting tobaccos made the brand incredibly successful. [...] Don Jaime is also legendarily credited with hiring one of the first lectors to read to and entertain the cigar rollers as they worked.|$|E
60|$|At {{that time}} Batu Beru {{was not what}} it has become since: {{the center of a}} prosperous <b>tobacco-growing</b> district, a tropically suburban-looking little {{settlement}} of bungalows in one long street shaded with two rows of trees, embowered by the flowering and trim luxuriance of the gardens, with a three-mile-long carriage-road for the afternoon drives and a first-class Resident with a fat, cheery wife to lead the society of married estate-managers and unmarried young fellows {{in the service of the}} big companies.|$|E
60|$|<b>Tobacco-growing</b> was patronised by Government in 1878, {{probably}} {{with the view}} of mixing it in their monopoly-manufactories with the growths of Cuba and Manilla. But on this favour being withdrawn the next year's harvest fell to one-fourth (354,640 lbs. to 36,978). The best sites were in Hierro (Ferro) and Adejo, {{in the south of}} Tenerife. The chief obstacles to success are imperfect cultivation, the expense of skilled labour, and deficiency of water to irrigate the deep black soil. Both Virginia and Havana leaves were grown, and good brands sold from eight to sixteen dollars per 100 lbs. The customers in order of quantity are Germany, England, France, South America, and the West Coast of Africa, where the cigars are now common. One brand (Republicanos) is so good that I should not wish to smoke better. At home they sell for twelve dollars per 1,000; a price which rises, I am told, in England to one shilling each. They are to be procured through Messieurs Davidson, of Santa Cruz.|$|E

50|$|In 1961, the Francisco Donatién Factory in the Pinar del Río Province of Cuba began {{producing}} cigars {{for domestic}} consumption, {{in addition to}} the cigarettes it had been producing for years.

50|$|Manufacturing, {{which did}} well during {{part of the}} 20th century, has also {{declined}} in Southwest Virginia despite local officials' efforts to recruit new industry. Tobacco has declined since the buyout of the federal quota program, but Virginia has made wise use of its money from the health-related tobacco settlements, devoting much of it to economic development in the state's <b>tobacco-growing</b> regions, which include part of Southwest Virginia. Since the early 2000s, natural gas extraction has grown into an important industry, particularly in the coalfield region. Throughout Southwest Virginia, tourism has begun to take off as an important industry.|$|E

The states are Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia.|$|E
