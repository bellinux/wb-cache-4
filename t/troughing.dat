40|$|Vancomycin <b>trough</b> {{concentrations}} {{should be}} measured within 30 min {{of the next}} dose, but {{studies have shown that}} <b>troughs</b> are often measured too early, producing erroneous results that could lead to dosing errors. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify the frequency of early <b>trough</b> measurements and to evaluate whether pharmacokinetically extrapolating mistimed concentrations may locate sub-therapeutic concentrations. Vancomycin <b>troughs</b> were retrospectively reviewed. For <b>troughs</b> ≥ 10 mg/L and measured > 0. 5 h early, the true <b>trough</b> was estimated using pharmacokinetic extrapolation methods to identify sub-therapeutic outcomes. Differences ≥ 2 mg/L between the measured and estimated true <b>trough</b> level was considered to have potential clinical significance. Of 143 <b>troughs</b> evaluated, 62 (43 %) were measured too early and 48 of those <b>troughs</b> were ≥ 10 mg/L. 25 % of those 48 <b>troughs</b> were sub-therapeutic. The potential for a difference ≥ 2 mg/L between the measured and estimated true <b>trough</b> was found to be greatest when the measured <b>trough</b> was ≥ 10 mg/L, the patient’s creatinine clearance (CrCl) was ≥ 60 mL/min, and the timing error was ≥ 2 h. To increase the therapeutic utility of early vancomycin <b>trough</b> concentrations, estimated true <b>troughs</b> can be determined by extrapolating measured values based on the time difference and CrCl...|$|R

40|$|An {{objective}} {{method was}} developed to analyze longwave and shortwave <b>trough</b> lines in wind field data using different methods, given that these <b>trough</b> lines were researched in different ways. Longwave <b>trough</b> lines were analyzed by locating the cyclonic center and filtering candidate <b>trough</b> points simultaneously; the candidate longwave <b>trough</b> points were then traced based on distance and angle conditions. Next, candidate shortwave <b>trough</b> points were determined based on angular deflection and vorticity data, which were clustered and fitted to a curve for extraction. This method was applied to wind field data from the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) to analyze <b>trough</b> lines in East Asia and South Asia. The experimental results show that our method can effectively identify <b>trough</b> lines by comparing them with manual analysis results. The statistical {{results indicate that the}} method more precisely identifies longwave <b>trough</b> lines than shortwave <b>trough</b> lines, and that <b>trough</b> lines during the fall and winter are more accurately and effectively identified than those during the spring and summer...|$|R
30|$|The ionospheric {{mid-latitude}} <b>trough</b> is a {{depleted region}} of ionospheric plasma density in the nightside F region and lies just equatorward of the auroral equatorward boundary. Throughout the paper, <b>trough</b> will refer {{specifically to the}} mid-latitude <b>trough.</b> The <b>trough</b> generally consists of three parts: an equatorward wall, a <b>trough</b> minimum, and a poleward wall. Because the large electron density gradient {{on either side of}} the <b>trough</b> affects radio wave propagation, the precise position of the <b>trough</b> is very important for many practical activities, such as trans-ionospheric communication and navigation.|$|R

40|$|Cable {{circuits}} {{installed in}} unfilled <b>troughs</b> must often support high current ratings. To achieve higher ratings in unfilled <b>troughs</b> in the U. K., <b>trough</b> lids {{can be replaced}} by ventilated grilles, provided that the <b>trough</b> is within a substation site. While several methods exist for rating the traditional covered <b>trough</b> design, no standard method exists for naturally ventilated installations. To examine the possible uprating available, a coupled numerical model has been created for cable <b>trough</b> installations. Following successful benchmarking tests where the covered <b>trough</b> was modelled, the method has been extended to <b>troughs</b> with full natural ventilation. The results have been compared to commonly used engineering assumptions in order to validate simpler analytical methods. It was found that by allowing full natural ventilation of existing covered <b>troughs,</b> the continuous rating could be increased {{by as much as}} 28 %...|$|R
30|$|In this study, we {{examined}} the <b>trough</b> structure averaged longitudinally {{over the course of}} a day. The longitudinal average of the <b>trough</b> structure depends not only on the longitude effect of the <b>trough</b> occurrence rate (He et al. 2011) but also on the longitude effect of the <b>trough</b> structure (Karpachev 2003). The occurrence rate of the <b>trough</b> shows significant variations depending on the season, solar activity, and MLT (Ishida et al. 2014). The longitude effect of the <b>trough</b> minimum position primarily depends on the Kp (Karpachev et al. 1996). These factors can lead to the large scatter of the data and make the interpretation of the data in terms of physical processes more difficult. Although these limitations exist, our results are consistent with those found in many earlier studies. During disturbed conditions, the temperature associated with the disturbed electric field increases in the <b>trough</b> region, and the plasma density at a <b>trough</b> minimum decreases. However, in this study, the TEC at the <b>trough</b> minimum remained constant with increasing Kp. Pryse et al. (2006) investigated the TEC <b>trough</b> in the United Kingdom and found the same feature. Therefore, the relationship between the TEC value at the <b>trough</b> minimum and the temperature at the <b>trough</b> minimum is needed to study at different geomagnetic activities, which can help us understand the physical mechanism of <b>trough</b> formation. In addition, a quantitative test of the wind effect in the <b>trough</b> is also needed in the future.|$|R

The synoptic pattern {{that led to the}} convection, consisted of mid and upper level <b>troughing</b> over much of the eastern United States, and an associated surface cold front advancing eastward along the northern Gulf of Mexico coast. Shortwave energy was rounding the base of the longwave trough through the day and was the main trigger for the vigorous convection.|$|E
50|$|In 1928 the {{property}} was put up for auction by the then owners Messrs J. and L. Smith who also owned Ethel Creek, Bolinda and Illgarrarie Stations.

5000|$|<b>Troughs</b> {{may be at}} the surface, or aloft, or both {{under various}} conditions.

Strong land surface heating strengthens the <b>trough</b> whereas topography and sea surface temperatures are of marginal importance. Diurnal variations in surface heating between the land and ocean lead to the <b>trough</b> line oscillating around the coast whereas its more general eastward movement is synoptically controlled.

5000|$|The Foundry {{struggled}} {{during its}} early years, with Griffiths receiving funding {{from his father}} to cover debts. However, by 1881 the business had improved and the foundry was [...] "making steam engines and boilers, wool and other presses, washpool requirements, spouting and soap tanks, pumps, windmills, <b>troughing,</b> castings - iron or brass, ironwork for verandahs, and also contracting to provide railway stock for the Queensland Government Railways."

50|$|The storm {{started to}} rebuild central {{convection}} on July 31, yet <b>troughing</b> and dry air entrainment degraded outflow over the southern portion. On August 1, deep convection finally {{wrapped around the}} LLCC because of tracking over the warmest regions of the Kuroshio Current, as well as dry air began to weaken. When Damrey passed near Yakushima at 06Z, the system developed a central dense overcast. According to JTWC Best Track Data, Damrey became a typhoon at 12Z. Poleward outflow channel still remained, but increasing convergence from the outflow of Typhoon Saola produced subsidence on the southern semi-circle and limited convection.|$|E
30|$|This study {{statistically}} {{investigated the}} seasonal variation, magnetic local time (MLT) variation, geomagnetic activity dependence, and solar activity {{dependence of the}} mid-latitude <b>trough</b> using GPS total electron content (TEC) data from 2000 to 2014. The daily median Kp index was used to characterize the daily geomagnetic activity level. The {{results showed that the}} <b>trough</b> minimum position depended primarily on the geomagnetic activity, MLT, and the season. The <b>trough</b> depth depended primarily on the solar flux index (F 107) and, to a lesser degree, on MLT. The <b>trough</b> depth increased as F 107 increased and as the incidence angle of solar flux decreased. The <b>trough</b> equatorward half-width decreased as the geomagnetic activity increased. These variations in the GPS-TEC <b>trough</b> minimum position were compared with the variations in the TEC <b>trough</b> derived from the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI)- 2007 model. The GPS-TEC <b>trough</b> minimum position changed little with respect to F 107, whereas the IRI-TEC <b>trough</b> minimum position showed a strong F 107 dependence.|$|R
50|$|It {{is formed}} by a wooden beam {{suspended}} {{so that the}} part that supports the pestle {{is larger than the}} other, which ends with a <b>trough.</b> A spout fills the <b>trough</b> with the water, thus raising the pestle.

As such, the monjolo is an important tool for agricultural facilitation.|$|R
50|$|If a <b>trough</b> {{forms in}} the mid-latitudes, a {{temperature}} difference between {{two sides of the}} <b>trough</b> usually exists {{in the form of a}} weather front.

5000|$|Against the {{expectations}} of its designer, the bridge did not perform well initially. On 11 June 1892, The Queenslander reported that it required [...] "rather {{a large amount of}} money to keep it in repair". A major flood in 1894 resulted in two sections of iron <b>troughing</b> being lifted and doubled over by the force of the flood. This necessitated the complete renewal of the roadway with layers of concrete and tarred metal. Then, in 1927, a record flood completely destroyed the northern approach to the bridge. In 1929, the bridge roadway was resurfaced and the hardwood curbing was replaced with concrete.|$|E

Methods: Adult patients who received at least two consecutive doses of vancomycin and had at least one reported vancomycin <b>trough</b> at steady state were considered. Data extracted and analyzed included patient gender, age, weight, height, and serum creatinine as well as vancomycin dose and interval, number of consecutive doses prior to the <b>trough,</b> time between <b>trough</b> and preceding dose, and measured vancomycin <b>trough</b> level. This data was applied to each of the prediction methods to determine how accurately they predicted actual measured vancomycin <b>trough</b> levels at steady state. Results: Data from 103 patients was analyzed. Vancomycin <b>trough</b> predictions using the Bergstrom method averaged 12. 2 mg/dl, {{with a standard deviation of}} 3. 4.

25|$|The spiral <b>troughs</b> {{in the ice}} cap {{are formed}} by {{katabatic}} winds that entrain surface ice eroded from the equator-facing sides of the <b>troughs,</b> likely aided by solar ablation (sublimation), which is then redeposited on the colder pole-facing slopes.
