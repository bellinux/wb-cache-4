5|$|The {{military}} {{leaders at the}} fort had been given written information from the Indian Agent regarding the killings during the raid. Plans were made to arrest the Indians involved. D Troop was hidden on foot behind the main office building. Carpenter had mounted troopers waiting nearby. Sherman and Grierson sat on the porch, reviewing the situation {{and waiting for the}} Indians to arrive. When the Indians came, they blatantly boasted of what they had done. After Sherman told the Indians they were under arrest, a signal was given and the dismounted troopers came forward with carbines and pistols in hand. Lone Wolf, supporting the Kiowa Chiefs, pulled a rifle out from under his blanket serape and pointed it at Sherman. Sherman, ready for any problem, quickly disarmed him before the trigger could be pulled. Big Tree made an attempt to escape but was quickly subdued by Carpenter's mounted troopers. Sherman decided that these men were criminals to be tried in a civil court and Carpenter was told <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>done.</b>|$|E

She would say, 'Take a salamander,' as if a general should command a private to catch a Tartar. Or, she would casually issue the order, 'Throw in a handful--' of something entirely unattainable. In these, the Housewife's most glaring moments of unreason, Bella would shut her up and knock her on the table, apostrophising her with the compliment, 'O you ARE a stupid old Donkey!

25|$|Having {{very limited}} {{resources}} meant {{much about the}} filmmaking process relied heavily on the pragmatism of the filmmakers and their determination <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>done.</b> Pre-production focussed on having a great script, finding a great cinematographer, actors, and music. The directors were inspired by the mumblecore movement of filmmakers. Alex Lisman the cinematographer had a documentary background so the directors knew he could shoot fast and solidly.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the capital}} {{investment}} needed to build the railroad was generated by selling government-guaranteed bonds (granted per mile of completed track) to interested investors. The Federal donation of right-of-way saved money and time as {{it did not have}} to be purchased from others. The financial incentives and bonds would hopefully cover most of the initial capital investment needed to build the railroad. The bonds would be paid back by the sale of government-granted land, as well as prospective passenger and freight income. Most of the engineers and surveyors who figured out how and where to build the railroad on the Union Pacific were engineering college trained. Many of Union Pacific engineers and surveyors were Union Army veterans (including two generals) who had learned their railroad trade keeping the trains running and tracks maintained during the U.S. Civil War. After securing the finances and selecting the engineering team, the next step was to hire the key personnel and prospective supervisors. Nearly all key workers and supervisors were hired because they had previous railroad on-the-job training, knew what needed to be done and how to direct workers <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>done.</b> After the key personnel were hired, the semi-skilled jobs could be filled if there was available labor. The engineering team's main job was to tell the workers where to go, what to do, how to do it, and provide the construction material they would need <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>done.</b>|$|E

Major Worth was president of the inquiry, with Lieutenant Henry H. Gird acting as secretary (court reporter), and two other faculty and staff to be selected by Thayer for court duties. If the inquiry determined that further disciplinary action was necessary, Thayer was empowered to court-martial any cadet or other military personnel. Worth elected Hitchcock and Lieutenant William Bryant to the court, despite Hitchcock's involvement in controlling the riots in North Barracks.|$|E

25|$|The 1975 Wimbledon Championships had Evert faced {{off against}} Billie Jean King in the semifinals, which saw Evert win {{the first set}} because of the fine groundstrokes she was hitting.

While Hall noted that he had a great father as a child, he felt the message needed to be conveyed to dads. Hall and the band wrote the song in about two days, in order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>done</b> prior to an annual NASCAR event held by their church.

40|$|Large‐scale journal deaccession is an all‐consuming project {{requiring}} considerable {{planning and}} staff time. The Library team at Siena Heights University, a small, Catholic, liberal arts university in rural Southeast Michigan, recently completed such a project. Project is a keyword—a large project {{like this is}} not business as usual, and must be managed as a project with appropriate staff from throughout the organization. Further, journal deaccession on this scale is not simple—it involves a change in what libraries have always done. Staff need time to absorb the changes, and to understand all of the ramifications on their future work. Perspectives from both librarians and paraprofessional staff are essential for a multifaceted view of the organizational, historical, operational, and emotional concerns involved in a large‐scale journal deaccession project. This paper outlines how one small institution’s journal deaccession project was managed, from initial conception <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> <b>it</b> <b>done,</b> including which staff should be involved, steps necessary to complete the project, how {{to talk about the}} project internally and with stakeholders, potential pitfalls, and how to deal with problems as they arise...|$|R

Korn asked Ross Robinson to produce, and wanted to begin recording at Indigo Ranch, mostly because their first album had been recorded there and was a success.
