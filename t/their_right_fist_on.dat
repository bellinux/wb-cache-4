5000|$|The House of Prince Duan, one of {{the royal}} {{families}} in the capital, employed {{a large number of}} boxing masters and wrestlers—some of which were anxious to have a trial of strength with Yang Lu-ch'an. Yang typically declined their challenges. One day, a famous boxing master of high prestige insisted on competing with Yang to see who was the stronger. The boxer suggested that they sit on two chairs and pit <b>their</b> <b>right</b> <b>fists</b> against each other. Yang Luchan {{had no choice but to}} agree. Shortly after the contest began, Duan's boxing master started to sweat all over and his chair creaked as if it were going to fall apart; Yang however looked as composed and serene as ever. Finally rising, Yang gently commented to the onlookers: [...] "The Master's skill is indeed superb, only his chair is not as firmly made as mine." [...] The other master was so moved by Yang's modesty that he never failed to praise his exemplary conduct and unmatched martial skill.|$|R

Our points of view are as follows. "How they were taught suburi when they were beginners. ", "Which body parts they concentrate on. ", and "What is on their minds during suburi. " We will also focus on the difference in the generations. We made a survey sending questionnaires and received 242 returns out of 250 (return rate 96. 8 %). Respondents are all experienced kendo players who are from college students up. We have tallied up the answers and will explore the results. 1. The body parts concentrated in chudan-no-kamae (Basic-posture) In chudan-no-kamae, most of the players answered they concentrate on their "left grip", "the top of the sinai", "tanden (abdomen) ", "left leg", and "left waist", so we think that they concentrate on the left side of the body with the left grip centered. In modern kendo, players have to meet the quick changes between offense and defense, so they put much importance in chudan-no-kamae. It's possible that the body parts now concentrated on will change as they practice a lot and master sizentai(the natural posture). 2. The body parts concentrated in raising or lowering the sinai It has become clear that most of them tend to concentrate on their "left grip" when raising the sinai. The "shoulder", "elbows", "grips", and "the top of the sinai" are also prevalent. Though there is a difference in the generations, they all concentrate on the upper body. It may help them not to loosen their left grip and also to raise the sinai in the centerline of the body. More than 80 percent of the players answer that when they raise the sinai, is position is either "pointing backward diagonally at the ceiling" or "parallel to the floor. " In other words the starting point of the swing is mostly not so low in the back. The fact that they concentrate on the "left grip", "the top of the sinai", and "both grips" shows that it is proper for the smooth swing to raise the sinai at those points. 3. The position of the sinai when they stop lowering it There is a big difference between under-thirties and over-forties on the position of the sinai when they stop lowering it. Most of the under-thirties players stop their sinai at the height of the top of the head, while over-forties stop when <b>their</b> <b>right</b> <b>fist</b> comes at the height of the right shoulder. We infer that it was caused by the different way of being taught by their instructors in the early stage of kendo training. It has been reported that when they swing in the air, the start of muscle-activity and the slowdown period in swinging are earlier than when they play against an opponent. It is necessary to manifest the height of the sinai when they stop swinging. We can determine that when they stop lowering the sinai, the position of it should be at the height of the top of the head, and that the grip should be under the shoulders, which may help them to swing completely...|$|R
