60|$|Dolores did {{not feel}} drawn to confession, {{but she knew that}} when Aunt Jane once set herself to ask questions, there was no use in trying to conceal anything. So she made answers, chiefly 'Yes' or No,' and her aunt, by severe and diligent pumping, had {{extracted}} bit by bit what it was most essential should be known, before the gong summoned them. Dolores would rather have been a solitary prisoner, able to chafe against oppression, than have been obliged to come down and confront everybody; but she crept into the place left for her between Mysie and Wilfred. She had very little appetite, and never found out how Mysie was fulfilling her resolution of kindness by baulking Wilfred of sundry attempts to tease; by substituting her own kissing-crust for Dolly's more unpoetical piece of bread; and offering to exchange her delicious strawberry-jam <b>tartlet</b> for the black-currant one at which her cousin was looking with reluctant eyes.|$|E

(The Doctor made a horrible grimace at the word 'priest.') 'But it seemed to me, when one had nothing to eat and was beaten, {{it was a different}} affair.

5000|$|Though {{any food}} served before {{the main course}} is {{technically}} an hors d'oeuvre, the phrase is generally limited to individual items, such as cheese or fruit. A glazed fig topped with mascarpone and wrapped with prosciutto is an hors d'oeuvre, and plain figs served on a platter may also be served as hors d'oeuvres. It could be pickled beets or anchovy eggs as topping over tomatoes {{as part of the}} initial [...] "drinks" [...] session such as of alcoholic or non alcoholic beverages.

40|$|Making a fruit spread is {{a delicious}} way of {{preserving}} nature’s bounty and adding interest to meals. Several kinds of spreads {{can be prepared}} – jams, jellies, conserves, butters and curds. They may supplement the breakfast table or {{can be used as}} a topping or filling for tea-time treats – pies, <b>tartlets,</b> meringues, cookies, cakes, muffins, scones and crumpets. What is a fruit curd? Fruit curds are traditional English spreads, made with fruit juice, butter, eggs, sugar and flavorings. The result is a rich, smooth, melt-in-the-mouth blend that is prized in the best year-round or holiday gift-giving tradition. Increasingly, gourmet gift-shops and food stores catering to epicurean tastes stock several flavors of fruit curds including orange, raspberry, strawberry, nectarine, lime, key lime, mango and even banana curd! The most well-known and sought-after variety, however, continues to be the classic ‘lemon curd ’- this article will therefore highlight this citrus curd. Making lemon curd at home is sometimes perceived as a challenge to novice cooks, but once the home-food preserver has mastered the art of making this delicacy, its versatility and the demand for this item will be well worth the effort...|$|R

60|$|When we gave {{a dinner}} at home, we had gravy soup, turbot and lobster-sauce, haunch of mutton, boiled fowls and tongue, lukewarm oyster-patties and sticky curry for side-dishes; wild duck, cabinet-pudding, jelly, cream and <b>tartlets.</b> All {{excellent}} things, except {{when you have}} to eat them continually. We lived upon them entirely in the season. Every one of our hospitable friends gave us a return dinner, which was a perfect copy of ours--just as ours was a perfect copy of theirs, last year. They boiled what we boiled, and we roasted what they roasted. We none of us ever changed the succession of the courses--or made more or less of them--or altered the position of the fowls opposite the mistress and the haunch opposite the master. My stomach used to quail within me, in those times, when the tureen was taken off and the inevitable gravy-soup smell renewed its daily acquaintance with my nostrils, and warned me of the persistent eatable formalities that were certain to follow. I suppose that honest people, who have known what it is to get no dinner (being a Rogue, I have myself never wanted for one), have gone through some very acute suffering under that privation. It may be some consolation to them to know that, next to absolute starvation, the same company-dinner, every day, is one of the hardest trials that assail human endurance. I date my first serious determination to throw over the medical profession at the earliest convenient opportunity, from the second season's series of dinners at which my aspirations, as a rising physician, unavoidably and regularly condemned me to be present.|$|R
