40|$|A {{number of}} {{mutations}} {{have been described}} with pleiotropic effects on the expression of genes for degradative enzymes in Bacillus subtilis. The sacU 32 (Hy) and sacQ 36 (Hy) mutations increase {{the expression of a}} wide variety of enzymes that degrade biological polymers. The phenotypes caused by mutations at the hpr locus are more restricted; they are known to increase expression of the alkaline and neutral proteases. The alkaline protease (aprE) promoter was analyzed to determine the target site for stimulation by these loci. Deletion of upstream regions of the aprE promoter could abolish or greatly reduce stimulation by mutations at these loci. A region upstream of - 200 was necessary for full stimulation by an hpr- 97 mutation, whereas a region between - 141 and - 164 was necessary for full stimulation by the sacU 32 (Hy) and sacQ 36 (Hy) mutations. Northern analyses of mRNA preparations showed that the levels of aprE mRNA were increased in strains carrying the sacU 32 (Hy) or hpr- 97 mutation. Moreover, primer extension analysis of these mRNA preparations revealed that <b>the</b> <b>transcription</b> start point <b>was</b> <b>identical</b> to that in a wild-type strain. We hypothesize that upstream activation of the subtilisin promoter mediated by these genes is a mechanism for global responses to a variety of nutritional conditions...|$|R
40|$|Human {{endogenous}} retroviruses (HERV) {{and related}} elements {{account for more}} than 8 % of the human genome and significantly contribute to the human transcriptome by long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter activity. In this context, HERVs are thought to intervene in the expression of adjacent genes by providing regulatory sequences (cis-effect) or via noncoding RNA including natural antisense transcripts. To address the potential impact of HERV activity in urothelial carcinoma, we comparatively analyzed <b>the</b> HERV <b>transcription</b> profiles in paired samples of non-malignant urothelium and urothelial carcinoma derived from 13 patients with bladder cancer by means of a retrovirus-specific microarray (RetroArray). We established a characteristic HERV signature consisting of six ubiquitously active HERV subgroups (E 4 - 1, HERV-Rb, ERV 9, HERV-K-T 47 D, NMWV 3, HERV-KC 4). <b>The</b> <b>transcription</b> pattern <b>is</b> largely <b>identical</b> in human urothelial carcinoma, non-malignant urothelial tissue, four tumor-derived cell lines and in a non-malignant urothelial cell line (UROtsa). Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) of HERV-E 4 - 1, HERV-K(HML- 6) and HERV-T(S 71 -TK 1) revealed a bias to lower HERV activity in carcinoma samples compared to non-malignant tissue. Determination of active HERV-E 4 - 1 loci by cloning and sequencing revealed six HERV-E 4 - 1 proviral loci that are differentially regulated in urothelial carcinoma cells and normal tissue. Two full-length HERV-E 4 - 1 proviruses, HERV-Ec 1 and HERV-Ec 6, are located in antisense orientation in introns of the genes PLA 2 G 4 A and RNGTT, respectively. PLA 2 G 4 A encodes a cytosolic phospholipase A 2 (cPLA 2) that is dysregulated i...|$|R
40|$|A 3. 8 -kilobase-pair EcoRI {{fragment}} which corrects {{the mutations}} {{carried by the}} NifB- Azotobacter vinelandii strains CA 30 and UW 45 was cloned, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. Four complete open reading frames (ORFs) and two partial ORFs were found. The translation product of the first partial ORF is the carboxy-terminal end of a protein homologous to the nifA gene product from Klebsiella pneumoniae. A 285 -base-pair sequence containing a potential nif promoter and nif regulatory sites separates this nifA gene from the first complete ORF which encodes a protein homologous to nifB gene products from K. pneumoniae and Rhizobium species. The Tn 5 insertion in strain CA 30 and the nif- 45 mutation of strain UW 45 are located within this nifB gene. The ORF downstream from nifB predicts an amino acid sequence with a cysteine residue pattern that is characteristic of ferredoxins. No similarities {{were found between the}} translation product of the third complete ORF and those of nif genes from other organisms. At the carboxy-terminal end of the predicted translation product of the fourth complete ORF, 30 of 60 amino acid residues <b>were</b> <b>identical</b> with the sequence of the nifQ gene product from K. pneumoniae. The partial ORF located {{at the end of the}} fragment encodes the N-terminal part of a potential protein with an unknown function. Northern (RNA) blot analysis indicated that transcripts from the region containing the four complete ORFs were NH 4 + repressible and that <b>the</b> <b>transcription</b> products <b>were</b> <b>identical</b> in cells derepressed under conditions of Mo sufficiency or Mo deficiency or in the presence of vanadium. In contrast to the NifB- strain CA 30, which is Nif- under all conditions, mutants that carry mutations affecting the C-terminal end of nifB or genes located immediately downstream from nifB, grew under all N 2 -fixing conditions. However, in the presence of Mo, most of the strains required 1, 000 times the amount of molybdate that is sufficient for maximal growth of the wild-type strain CA under N 2 -fixing conditions. Growth data from strain CA 37, which carries a Kanr insertion in nifQ, indicate that nifQ in A. vinelandii is not required for N 2 fixation in the presence of V 2 O 5 or under Mo-deficient conditions. Growth studies and acetylene reduction assays performed on two nifEN deletion strains showed that nifE and nifN are required for N 2 fixation under Mo sufficiency, as previously observed (K. E. Brigle, M. C. Weiss, W. E. Newton, and D. R. Dean, J. Bacteriol. 169 : 1547 - 1553, 1987), but not under conditions of Mo deficiency or in the presence of 50 nM V 2 O 5...|$|R
