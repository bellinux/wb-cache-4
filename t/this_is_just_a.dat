The new album included a later take of [...] "The Long and Winding Road", recorded on 31 January. [...] With no strings or other added instrumentation beyond that which was played in the studio at the time, it was closer to the Beatles's original intention than the 1970 version.

500|$|There {{were also}} a few {{positive}} reviews. One such review came from Fraser McAlpine of BBC, who opened, [...] "It's {{one of the fundamental}} laws of pop, anything which tips a nod to 'You Spin Me Round (Like A Record)' by Dead Or Alive is going to be worth a listen." [...] He continued, [...] "Even though <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> song written {{from the perspective of a}} randy man watching a pole-dancer and bragging about how much money he has [...] in a manner which would make Akon blush, there's just something kind of cute about the whole thing." [...] McAlpine attributed this to the song's [...] "Tigger-beat", explaining, [...] "How can anything too sordid be going on when everyone is bouncing around like they're on spacehoppers?" [...] Bill Lamb of About.com commented, [...] "You will hear echoes of another pop classic, but the new song stands on its own feet."

500|$|In {{reference}} to the 1978 kung fu film The 36th Chamber of Shaolin that the group enjoyed watching, the Clan considered themselves as lyrical masters of the 36 chambers, and arrived onto the rap scene while appearing to be ahead, and more advanced over others, with [...] "knowledge of 36 chambers of hip hop music when everyone else in hip hop was striving to attain the knowledge of 35 lessons." [...] Also, while the human body has 108 pressure points (1 + 0 + 8 = 9), only the Wu-Tang martial artists learned and understood that 36 of those pressure points are deadly (9 + 36 = 45) (4 + 5 = 9) The lyrics and rhymes of the 9 members are to be considered as 36 deadly lyrical techniques for pressure points. All {{of this is the}} basis for the album title, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers), being that 9 members x 4 chambers = 36. However, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> theory; the true significance of the title is not definitively known.|$|E

He wants a different standard for religions other than his own, and to me, that is where intolerance and bigotry begin." [...] Stone commented that [...] "In 10 years and over 150 episodes of South Park, Isaac never had a problem with the show making fun of Christians, Muslims, Mormons and Jews. He got a sudden case of religious sensitivity when it was his religion featured on the show. To bring the civil rights struggle into <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> non sequitur.
