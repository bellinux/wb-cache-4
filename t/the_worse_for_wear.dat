500|$|The film's {{sense of}} self-seriousness and the camaraderie amongst the {{characters}} were generally cited as positive aspects. Maslin wrote that certain tacky {{elements of the}} film's television roots were outweighed by {{the closeness of the}} Enterprise crew and [...] "by their seriousness and avidity about what seem to be the silliest minutiae [...] That's what longtime Trekkies love about the series, and it's still here—a little <b>the</b> <b>worse</b> <b>for</b> <b>wear,</b> but mostly untarnished." [...] The Los Angeles Times wrote that despite its spectacle, the film's [...] "humanity once again outweighs the hardware, and its innocence is downright endearing". Mackay offered an alternate view, calling the characters' actions and dialogue [...] "wooden" [...] and saying that the film's monsters had more life than the acting. Lloyd's portrayal of Kruge received praise from New Yorks David Denby and The Daily Newss Hunter Reigler.|$|E
2500|$|When the Count, much <b>the</b> <b>worse</b> <b>for</b> <b>wear</b> {{after the}} {{so-called}} [...] "duel", in which Oliver clearly won, called him [...] "a savage. a lout, a yokel and a buffoon", Annie, {{who was just}} as angry at de Tour as Warbucks was, defends him by kicking the pseudo-Count in the shin.|$|E

2500|$|An entirely {{different}} type of person was Virendranath Chattopadhyay, member of a famous family in India. Popularly known as Chatto {{he was a very}} able and a very delightful person. He was always hard up, his clothes were very much <b>the</b> <b>worse</b> <b>for</b> <b>wear</b> and often he found it difficult to raise the wherewithal for a meal. But his humour and light heartedness never left him. He had been some years senior to me during my educational days in England. He was at Oxford when I was at Harrow. Since those days he had not returned to India and sometimes a fit of homesickness came to him when he longed to be back. All his home-ties had long been severed and it is quite certain that if he came to India he would feel unhappy and out of joint. But in spite of the passage of time the home pull remains. No exile can escape the malady of his tribe, that consumption of the soul, as Mazzini called it ... Of the few I met, the only persons who impressed me intellectually were Virendranath Chattopadhyay and M.N. Roy. Chatto was not, I believe, a regular communist, but he was communistically inclined.|$|E

5000|$|This episode {{received}} excellent reviews. Cliff Wheatley of IGN {{gave the}} episode a 9.1/10, stating [...] "Supergirl {{might have been}} a little late to the Valentine's Day festivities, but this episode was none <b>the</b> <b>worse</b> <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> <b>for</b> it. [...] "Mr. and Mrs. Mxyzptlk" [...] offered up an entertaining villain and a conflict that helped enrich two of the show's key romantic relationships. It captured the show at its most lighthearted and charming." ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{final element}} was the [...] (or [...] ) shot, {{which came from}} carom or carambole billiards, a three-ball game popular in various {{countries}} of western Continental Europe, especially popularized by France (and today also popular {{in many parts of}} Asia and South America). In the 1700s, the carambole game added a red [...] to the two white cue balls, and dispensed with the pockets. This ball was adopted into the English game, which retained the pockets, and the goal was to cannon off both the red and the opponent's ball on a single shot, earning 2 points. This influence on the English game appears to have come about through the popularity of French tables in English coffee houses; London alone had over two thousand such establishments in the early 18th century. One period advertisement read: [...] "A very good French Billiard Table, little <b>the</b> <b>worse</b> <b>for</b> <b>wearing,</b> full size, with all the materials fit for French or English play".|$|R

60|$|The {{disappointed}} Dominie {{shut his}} ponderous tome, much marvelling {{in his mind}} how a person possessed of the lawyer's erudition could give his mind to these frivolous toys. But the Counsellor, indifferent to the high character for learning which he was trifling away, filled himself a large glass of Burgundy, and, after preluding a little with a voice somewhat <b>the</b> <b>worse</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>wear,</b> gave the ladies a courageous invitation to join in 'We be Three Poor Mariners,' and accomplished his own part therein with great eclat.|$|R

60|$|We saw, {{in one of}} the rooms, {{the funeral}} canopy beneath which the Duke of Wellington lay in state,--very gorgeous, of black velvet {{embroidered}} with silver and adorned with escutcheons; also, the state bed of Queen Anne, broad, and of comfortable appearance, though it was a queen's,--the materials of the curtains, quilt, and furniture, red velvet, still brilliant in hue; also King William's bed and his queen Mary's, with enormously tall posts, and a good deal <b>the</b> <b>worse</b> <b>for</b> time and <b>wear.</b>|$|R

60|$|Thereon ensued {{silence in}} the little room, half parlour, half study, nearly filled with books and piano; and the furniture, though {{carefully}} protected with brown holland, looking <b>the</b> <b>worse</b> <b>for</b> <b>wear,</b> and as if danced over by a good many young folks.|$|E
60|$|Thanks to the {{application}} provided by {{the owner of the}} museum, these evidences of a fight were rapidly reduced, and when Sam awoke they looked little <b>the</b> <b>worse</b> <b>for</b> <b>wear,</b> although he readily discovered that something serious had happened while he was wrapped in slumber.|$|E

60|$|Many civilities {{passed between}} her ladyship and {{the representatives of}} sundry ancient loyal {{families}} who were upon the ground, by whom she was held in high reverence; and not a young man of rank passed by them {{in the course of}} the muster, but he carried his body more erect in the saddle, and threw his horse upon its haunches, to display his own horsemanship and the perfect bitting of his steed to the best advantage in the eyes of Miss Edith Bellenden. But the young cavaliers, distinguished by high descent and undoubted loyalty, attracted no more attention from Edith than the laws of courtesy peremptorily demanded; and she turned an indifferent ear to the compliments with which she was addressed, most of which were little <b>the</b> <b>worse</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>wear,</b> though borrowed <b>for</b> the nonce from the laborious and long-winded romances of Calprenede and Scuderi, the mirrors in which the youth of that age delighted to dress themselves, ere Folly had thrown her ballast overboard, and cut down her vessels of the first-rate, such as the romances of Cyrus, Cleopatra, and others, into small craft, drawing as little water, or, to speak more plainly, consuming as little time as the little cockboat in which the gentle reader has deigned to embark. It was, however, the decree of fate that Miss Bellenden should not continue to evince the same equanimity till the conclusion of the day.|$|R
6000|$|In {{the library}} after lunch. It {{is not much}} of a [...] library, its {{literary}} equipment consisting of a [...] single fixed shelf stocked with old paper-covered [...] novels, broken backed, coffee stained, torn and [...] thumbed, and a couple of little hanging shelves [...] with a few gift books on them, the rest of the [...] wall space being occupied by trophies of war and [...] the chase. But it is a most comfortable [...] sitting-room. A row of three large windows in the [...] front of the house shew a mountain panorama, which [...] is just now seen in one of its softest aspects in [...] the mellowing afternoon light. In the left hand [...] corner, a square earthenware stove, a perfect [...] tower of colored pottery, rises nearly to the [...] ceiling and guarantees plenty of warmth. The [...] ottoman in the middle is a circular bank of [...] decorated cushions, and the window seats are well [...] upholstered divans. Little Turkish tables, one of [...] them with an elaborate hookah on it, and a screen [...] to match them, complete the handsome effect of the [...] furnishing. There is one object, however, which is [...] hopelessly out of keeping with its surroundings. [...] This is a small kitchen table, much <b>the</b> <b>worse</b> <b>for</b> [...] <b>wear,</b> fitted as a writing table with an old [...] canister full of pens, an eggcup filled with ink, [...] and a deplorable scrap of severely used pink [...] blotting paper.|$|R
60|$|The journey {{had been}} a failure, so far as finding {{a home in the}} wilds was concerned, where the head of the family could live without much labor; and now the {{homeless}} ones, decidedly <b>the</b> <b>worse</b> <b>for</b> <b>wear,</b> were returning to Willow Point, on the Little Humboldt River.|$|E
60|$|Randy {{rushed over}} to the little shelf which {{contained}} all the school-books the family had ever possessed, and brought forth a large geography, much <b>the</b> <b>worse</b> <b>for</b> <b>wear.</b> There was no separate map of Alaska, {{but there was one}} of North America, and this he scanned with interest.|$|E
60|$|It {{would not}} be a {{difficult}} matter to move, for two coats, rather <b>the</b> <b>worse</b> <b>for</b> <b>wear,</b> and three old tomato cans were all the property they had to bring; Paul's tops, which constituted his baggage, could be carried in the pocket of his jacket without any trouble.|$|E
50|$|Bearing a stubbly, unshaven lantern jaw {{that would}} not disgrace Desperate Dan, and a nose {{that appears to have}} {{sustained}} an impact with a solid object at some time in its history, Ogri's rough and unhandsome face belies its essentially good-natured owner. Ogri originally had a blond mane of hair that showed under his helmet, however this changed early in his history to the better-known black scruff he now sports. Well able to deal out violence when it is warranted, Ogri normally asks little of the world except that it should leave him alone and he does not trouble it when it does not trouble him. He enjoys his beer but is seldom if ever seen <b>worse</b> <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> <b>for</b> drink, and certainly never to the extent of being unfit to ride. Ogri is an all-weather rider, and treats inclement weather {{in the same manner as}} the risk of injury - with respect, but defiance.|$|R
60|$|A {{little before}} the sale commenced, a short, broad, muscular man, in a checked shirt {{considerably}} {{open at the}} bosom, and pantaloons much <b>the</b> <b>worse</b> <b>for</b> dirt and <b>wear,</b> elbowed {{his way through the}} crowd, like one who is going actively into a business; and, coming up to the group, began to examine them systematically. From the moment that Tom saw him approaching, he felt an immediate and revolting horror at him, that increased as he came near. He was evidently, though short, of gigantic strength. His round, bullet head, large, light-gray eyes, with their shaggy, sandy eyebrows, and stiff, wiry, sun-burned hair, were rather unprepossessing items, it is to be confessed; his large, coarse mouth was distended with tobacco, the juice of which, from time to time, he ejected from him with great decision and explosive force; his hands were immensely large, hairy, sun-burned, freckled, and very dirty, and garnished with long nails, in a very foul condition. This man proceeded to a very free personal examination of the lot. He seized Tom by the jaw, and pulled open his mouth to inspect his teeth; made him strip up his sleeve, to show his muscle; turned him round, made him jump and spring, to show his paces.|$|R
6000|$|Not {{long after}} this {{we saw the}} Piscataquoag, or Sparkling Water, {{emptying}} in on our left, and heard the Falls of Amoskeag above. Large quantities of lumber, as we read in the Gazetteer, were still annually floated down the Piscataquoag to the Merrimack, {{and there are many}} fine mill privileges on it. Just above the mouth of this river we passed the artificial falls where the canals of the Manchester Manufacturing Company discharge themselves into the Merrimack. They are striking enough to have a name, and, with the scenery of a Bashpish, would be visited from far and near. The water falls thirty or forty feet over seven or eight steep and narrow terraces of stone, probably to break its force, and is converted into one mass of foam. This canal-water {{did not seem to be}} <b>the</b> <b>worse</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>wear,</b> but foamed and fumed as purely, and boomed as savagely and impressively, as a mountain torrent, and, though it came from under a factory, we saw a rainbow here. These are now the Amoskeag Falls, removed a mile down-stream. But we did not tarry to examine them minutely, making haste to get past the village here collected, and out of hearing of the hammer which was laying the foundation of another Lowell on the banks. At the time of our voyage Manchester was a village of about two thousand inhabitants, where we landed for a moment to get some cool water, and where an inhabitant told us that he was accustomed to go across the river into Goffstown for his water. But now, as I have been told, and indeed have witnessed, it contains fourteen thousand inhabitants. From a hill on the road between Goffstown and Hooksett, four miles distant, I have seen a thunder-shower pass over, and the sun break out and shine on a city there, where I had landed nine years before in the fields; and there was waving the flag of its Museum, where [...] "the only perfect skeleton of a Greenland or river whale in the United States" [...] was to be seen, and I also read in its directory of a [...] "Manchester Athenaeum and Gallery of the Fine Arts." ...|$|R
