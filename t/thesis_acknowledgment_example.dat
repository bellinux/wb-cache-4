40|$|ENGLISH: The {{current study}} {{is aimed at}} {{identifying}} the generic structure and the functional choices of gratitude expressions of <b>thesis</b> <b>acknowledgment</b> written in English by Indonesian undergraduate students from Maulana Malik Ibrahim State Islamic University of Malang (UIN) and Petra University Surabaya. It {{is divided into two}} main issues, generic structure and functional choices of gratitude expressions. To examine the generic structure, genre analysis is at work. It reveals that the generic structure of Maulana Malik Ibrahim State Islamic University of Malang and Petra comprises introductory move, thanking move, announcing move, and signing off. There are two steps of introductory move; reflection on writing the thesis, and praising God and prophetic saying for UIN; four steps for thanking move; presenting participants, thanking for academic assistance, for moral support, and for resources; and two steps of announcing move; accepting responsibility and hope for contribution. In the second phase, the writer uses Systemic Functional Linguistics. From the ideational, interpersonal, and textual analysis of the gratitude expressions, it is concluded that the different choices of processes, themes, and pronouns are influenced by the sociocultural and interpersonal relation of the writers and the addressees. From the two analyses, the writer concludes that the generic structure of acknowledgment is a written form of writer’s interpersonal relation with the addressees. The clear and regular pattern of the genre, the complex hierarchy of thanks, and the frequent use of interactant pronouns reveal that acknowledgment is culturally bound with the sociocultural, socio-religious, and institutional background of the writers. This thesis portrays only few of various phenomena which occur in Indonesian acknowledgments. It is purely corpus-based study that further research which includes the writers’, readers’, and addresses’ personal view is seen significant. Different samples, such as graduate and post graduate students’ <b>thesis</b> <b>acknowledgments,</b> books, journals, and so forth, are also worth researching...|$|R

40|$|Disciplinary Identities is an {{intelligent}} blend of synthesis and innovation. With it, Ken Hyland coherently follows {{the trail of}} his previous work, in particular that of Disciplinary Discourses (2004), whose final chapters constitute his present point of departure, and of those articles explaining the tension between positioning (authorial stance and visibility) and “proximity ” (the conformity and “engagement ” with communal constraints and expectations) to take a broad view of academic identity through a constructivist approach. Indeed the works on identity currently circulating are, as Hyland states in his preface, diverse and massively numerous, and therefore one must have powerful reasons for launching another book onto the market. Disciplinary Identities, suffice it to say, is not only justified but also welcome because of three very strong points: first, its conjugation of shared knowledge and new findings – the latter regarding hardly explored representational genres such as academic bios, <b>theses</b> <b>acknowledgments,</b> prize applications and academic homepages; second, its eclecticism, both theoretical and methodological, which enriches the current landscape of research into academic interpersonality and provides us with a versatile arsenal of tools; and third, an ample conceptual coverage leading to suggestive directions for further studies. Among them are the connection between identity and multimodality (the author’s survey of academic webpages reminds us that identities are relational, multimodal and semiotic), the whys and wherefores of generic bending, issues of disciplinary and discursive appropriation and hybridization, the diachronic evolution of self- and group branding, the erosion of genres by individual style, or the variation of content and form across channels and media (oral, written, multimodal, traditional and digital) and throughout educational levels. rESEñAS / BOOK rEVIEW...|$|R

Therefore, to reduce the bandwidth waste and transmission delay, caused by acknowledgment packets, without reducing data transmission reliability, some improved ARQ-based protocols [6 - 9] use data packets as implicit acknowledgments; some protocols [10 - 14], such as segmented data reliable transport (SDRT) [12, 13], NCRF (network coding [14] in rateless fashion) [15], and NCIA (network coding with implicit acknowledgment) [15], send coded packets in burst, which only needs a acknowledgment packet; some protocols, such as ADELIN (adaptive reliable transport) [16, 17], VBF-NC (vector-based forwarding-network coding) [18] and MPNC (multiple path and network coding) [19], guarantee transmission reliability only by sending enough coed packets.|$|R

40|$|A {{selective}} acknowledgment (SACK) mechanism, {{combined with}} a selective repeat retransmission policy, has been proposed to overcome the limitations with the cumulative acknowledgment scheme in TCP. With the SACK mechanism, the receiver informs the sender about the noncontiguous blocks of data that have been received and queued. However, for each such noncontiguous block, SACK requires 8 bytes to convey {{the information to the}} sender. Since TCP options field has a fixed length, an acknowledgment packet, at the maximum, can carry information about only 4 noncontiguous blocks. Under some error conditions, this limitation can cause the TCP sender to retransmit packets that have already been received successfully by the receiver. In this paper, we propose an improved selective acknowledgment (ISACK) scheme to overcome the limitations of the current selective <b>acknowledgment</b> scheme. Using <b>examples,</b> we demonstrate how the proposed scheme works. We further propose an adaptive selective acknowledgment (ASACK) strategy that dynamically switches between SACK and ISACK to give optimal performance. ...|$|R

Military communications further require secure connections for data transfer. The Free Space Optical (FSO) communication system, with {{its ability to}} connect at a high data rate, offers an appealing solution to the current need. Using laser technology and transmitting at a wavelength invisible to the human eye, FSO is difficult to detect and intercept, providing a highly secure means of communication. However, it faces the limitation of being a strictly line-of-sight communication technology and {{is known to be}} greatly affected by atmospheric attenuation. This thesis documents three experiments involving FSO technology, including the process of the experiment preparations, laser-related hazard assessment, and implementation of a standard procedure to mitigate any possible risk. The contribution of this <b>thesis</b> is the <b>acknowledgment</b> that this proposed process is feasible. Experiments were conducted on an SA Photonics NEXUS 3 FSO Communications System.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a case study of}} a {{kindergarten}} {{in one of the most}} deprived areas of Aotearoa New Zealand. Through the documentation of the stories of management, teachers and families, the thesis explores how the transformation of the kindergarten and a policy intervention have provided multiple opportunities and affordances for adults to realise their aspirations. Bourdieu’s logic of practice thinking tools and Bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems theory are intertwined to theorise about the contribution of macrosystem ideologies that position communities as vulnerable and frame up subsequent exosystem policy attempts to intervene. The concept of habitus is applied to explain how a commitment to social justice and an empowerment view of individuals and communities can afford conditions for the transformation of habitus. The thesis argues that the level of strength of an affordance is significant in the recognition and utilisation of opportunities and that early childhood teachers can be mesosystem agents in mediating affordances. Inherent in the <b>thesis</b> is the <b>acknowledgment</b> that early childhood services have the potential to contribute to positive life trajectories for adults as well as children, particularly for those in communities who have the odds stacked against them. The thesis adds to the scholarship about habitus and its transforming features and contributes to a deeper understanding about the role of effective early years services as powerful intervention sites for adults. The unique combination of Bourdieu and Bronfenbrenner’s theories offers new insights about the individual/environment relationship and impacts on agency. The thesis outlines a range of policy implications for consideration with respect to communities who are poorly provided for due to dominant ideological discourses and reiterates the right of all individuals to realise their hopes and dreams...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{split into two}} parts, which are united {{in the sense that}} they involve {{applying}} ideas from quantum information to fundamental physics. The first part is focused on examining discrete-time models in quantum computation (discrete-time quantum walks and quantum cellular automata) as discretized models of relativistic systems. One of the results here is a theorem demonstrating that a large class of discrete-time quantum walks have relativistic dynamics in the continuum limit. Additionally, the problem of fermion doubling for these models is investigated, and it is seen that the problem can be circumvented in two dimensional space. This was already known for one dimensional systems. Another result involves taking the limits of causal free field theories in discrete spacetime to recover continuum field theories, something that is not straightforward because of the nontrivial nature of the vacuum in quantum field theory. Additionally, it is shown that general systems of fermions evolving causally in discrete spacetime can be represented by quantum cellular automata, which makes them efficiently simulable by quantum computers. A related result is that quantum cellular automata composed of fermions are equivalent to regular quantum cellular automata. In the second part of this thesis, the focus is on the foundations of statistical physics. The main result of this part is a general bound on the time it takes a quantum system to effectively reach equilibrium. The discussion also includes a practical definition of equilibration that takes our measurement capabilities into account. Finally, the nature of the equilibrium state is also discussed, with a focus on initial state independence, which relates to the important question of when the equilibrium state is a Gibbs state.

40|$|The Mauritian Education {{system is}} a highly elitist and examination-oriented system where {{teachers}} in state secondary schools enjoy complete autonomy {{in the selection of}} their teaching methods. Despite education policies recommending learner-centred teaching (LCT) for a more inclusive, integrated and holistic approach to education (NCF, 2009, p. 7), most secondary education teachers generally use teacher-centred teaching (TCT) methods even after having learned LCT in professional teaching courses. In this study I examine how 30 professionally trained teachers from eight state secondary schools in Mauritius understand LCT and how they implement it in class. I also explore why those teachers choose this approach and which skills they think are necessary for effective LCT. This qualitative study uses a social-constructivist approach. It was carried out in two phases. In the first phase I looked into teachers’ understandings of LCT and in the second phase I observed teachers enactment of LCT in their classrooms. Data gathering tools were questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, focus groups, class observations and debriefing sessions. The findings point towards two perspectives of LCT: the first perspective is a cognitive perspective, which is more achievement-oriented, and the second one is an emancipatory perspective, which focuses on re-engaging learners with their studies. The study also shows that their work contexts, their beliefs and the pressure of an exams-oriented system shape teachers’ understanding of LCT and in its actual form LCT in Mauritian schools is only partially learner-centred with a mix of LCT and TCT. The main contribution of this <b>thesis</b> is the <b>acknowledgment</b> of the kind of LCT that teachers can achieve without any form of support and the potential of our teachers in transforming our classrooms with authentic and effective forms of LCT provided continuing professional development and school support become regular features of our education system...|$|R

40|$|Canada {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as a liberal, multicultural nation that prides itself on a history of peace and tolerance. Oftentimes set up in contrast to the United States, Canada’s history of colonialism has been popularly imagined as a gentler, necessary, inevitable, and even benevolent version of expansion and subjugation of Indigenous populations. In recent decades scholars in the social sciences and humanities have challenged the rhetoric of Canada as a consistently benevolent and peaceful nation. They have pointed to the discontinuity between Canada’s rosy image, drawn from foundational nation-building myths of benevolence, and the deeply rooted colonial narratives of necessity and inevitability that underpin those nation-building myths. This discontinuity manifests itself in far reaching patterns of social and economic disparity between Indigenous and settler populations over time across the nation. This reality is acutely seen in the Canadian West, as Canada’s historic frontier. This thesis re-problematises narratives of Canadian nation-building from a regional perspective. It is argued that positioning the West as the frontier peripheral to Canadian ‘civilisation’ is part of a broader settler colonial logic that sees the contemporary manifestation of disparity between Indigenous and settler populations as emanating from uniquely backward, peripheral places in Canada, rather than challenging the fundamental benevolence of the Canadian nation. Through a close reading of two trials pertaining to an instance of multiple perpetrator sexual assault that occurred in Saskatchewan in 2003, I demonstrate how the complex web of interlocking systems of domination that oppress and privilege in trials do not emanate from the backwardness of the place in which they occurred, but are rather indicative of broader societal processes and power relations indicative of settler colonialism. This thesis argues there is a conflation between western Canadian identity, and settler identity, owing to the foundational nation-building myths in which the West became Canadian. In moving forward, this <b>thesis</b> proposes an <b>acknowledgment</b> of the settler colonial nature of westward expansion and suggests practicing openness to considering different ways westward expansion might have been understood and experienced. Key to this process is learning to listen, learning to hear, learning to believe, and learning to see oneself implicated in the stories of those who experienced westward expansion differently from how it is popularly constructed in settler society. I begin here by proposing the complainant’s voice in the trial be heard, and be believed. Her voice and her silence provides insight into understanding the oppressive power of settler-colonialism...|$|R

This system makes it conceivable to utilize the speaker's voice to confirm his/her personality and give controlled access to administrations like voice based biometrics, database access administrations, voice based dialling, phone message and remote access to PCs. Speech processing front end for extricating the feature set is a critical stage in any voice recognition system. The ideal list of capabilities is still not yet chosen however the limitless endeavours of scientists. There are numerous sorts of highlights, which are determined distinctively and have great effect on the acknowledgment rate. This project shows one of the strategies to extract the feature from a voice signal, which can be utilized {{as a part of}} speech acknowledgment system. The key is to change the speech wave to some kind of parametric representation (at an impressively lower data rate) for further examination and processing. This is frequently known as the voice processing front end. An extensive variety of potential outcomes exist for parametrically speaking to the discourse signal for the speaker <b>acknowledgment</b> undertaking, for <b>example,</b> Mel-Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCC), Linear Prediction Coding (LPC), and others. MFCC is maybe the best known and generally prominent, furthermore, these will be utilized as a part of this undertaking. MFCCs are in view of the known variety of the human ear’s discriminating transmission capacities with recurrence channels dispersed sprightly at low frequencies and logarithmically at high frequencies have been utilized to catch the phonetically essential qualities of discourse. Nonetheless, another key normal for discourse is semi stationary, i. e. it is brief time stationary which is contemplated and investigated utilizing brief time, recurrence space examination. In this project work, I have built a straightforward yet completed and agent automatic speaker recognition (ASR) framework, as connected to a voice based attention framework, i. e., a speech based access control system. To attain to this, I had to first made a relative investigation of the MFCC approach with the Time space approach for acknowledgment by simulating both these strategies utilizing MATLAB 7. 0 and investigating the consistency of acknowledgment utilizing both the procedures. The voice based attendance system is based with respect to confined or one word recognition. A specific speaker articulates the secret word once in the instructional course so as to prepare and store the highlights of the entrance word. While in the testing session the speaker articulates the secret key again to accomplish acknowledgment if there is a match. The highlight vectors interesting to that speaker are acquired in the preparation stage and this is made utilization of later on to allow validation to the same speaker who {{at the end of the}} day expresses the same word in the testing stage. At this stage a gate crasher can likewise test the framework to test the inalienable security include by expressing the same word...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{examined}} global media discourses regarding {{the coverage of}} an anti-poverty campaign for Africa by celebrities in Europe by comparing media coverage of this event in the UK, US, and African press. The Make Poverty History campaign was organized in 2005 to pressure G 8 leaders meeting in Glen eagles Scotland to cancel African aid, increase aid, and make trading conditions fairer. Former rock star, and humanitarian Sir Bob Geldof, rocker Bono, and filmmaker Richard Curtis, were the central figures in organizing this campaign on the global justice movement side of things. On the political arena, former British premier, Tony Blair, also had an agenda that put Africa and climate change {{at the top of}} the G 8 agenda in 2005. Given Africa 2 ̆ 7 s historical negative coverage in the media, this study sought to investigate how a celebrity campaign which sought to change the perception of Africa as a pitiable place in need of charity, to one of a wronged continent in need of justice, would alter, if at all, the traditional coverage of Africa. The study sought to address three questions in particular: what were global media discourses regarding the Make Poverty History campaign; how were the major players in this campaign portrayed by the press in the United Kingdom, the center of the campaign, the United States, the key player in the G 8, and in Africa, the continent in which all this attention was being directed to; and lastly to establish to what degree differences existed between media coverage of this campaign, and colonial/postcolonial discourses on the continent. The findings from the Western press showed both continuities and discontinuities of colonial rhetorical modes. These discursive continuities are classification, affirmation, debasement, idealization, and negation. These discourses are not static but have variations and shifts but some clear outlines of a continuation of colonial discourses were apparent. Classification refers to arranging nations according to a single standard of political and economic development. The Western press constantly held up industrialized countries as the ideal for Africa to follow. Affirmation has to do with confirming the moral superiority of the rich nations 2 ̆ 7 publics. The Western media esteem the ability of the Western public, for example, to serve as the conscience of big business to restrain them from exploiting Third World countries. The leaders of the campaign also painted outstanding leaders on a mission to save the world, while the beneficiaries of the campaign were not involved. Debasement has to do depicting the 2 ̆ 2 Other 2 ̆ 2 in a degrading manner. This recurred in the coverage except the trope of debasement and idealization operated together with African leaders acting as the 2 ̆ 2 villains 2 ̆ 2 and the ordinary people as 2 ̆ 2 noble 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 unspoilt 2 ̆ 2 continuing the ambivalence of colonial discourse. Negation had to do with the media being ahistorical and denying historical links between Africa 2 ̆ 7 s deprivation in the past and its present reality. Even the campaign itself was in denial of Africa 2 ̆ 7 s past by adopting its slogan as Make Poverty History. Nonetheless, accommodation is a new discourse that came out of the reading and signified diverse perspectives within Western media coverage. Some perspectives from the activist public considered left-wing have entered the mainstream, for <b>example,</b> <b>acknowledgment</b> that subsidies given to farmers in wealthy countries make African countries less competitive contributing to poverty levels. 	African media texts had different perspectives. These can be classified as: self-affirmation (quest for global inclusion and /raising Africa 2 ̆ 7 s global profile); sovereignty (quest for economic independence); and self-reliance. African publications sought to reaffirm the place of Africa within the community of nations. They also sought resist what they considered undue interference by outsiders in the inside affairs of the continent. But there was some ambivalence because they still expressed concern over being forgotten by the rest of the world. Lastly, African media texts called for Africans to fashion their own solutions to the problems they encounter instead of waiting for outside help. These discursive strategies could be seen as defensive and in direct response to Africa 2 ̆ 7 s portrayal in the international media. Nevertheless, the African media provided perspective and continually drew the link between Africa 2 ̆ 7 s current problems and its historical development and place in global relations. While the Western press focused on Africa 2 ̆ 7 s present dilemma, the African press provided an alternative reading of the situation by illustrating global connections in Africa 2 ̆ 7 s plight...|$|R
