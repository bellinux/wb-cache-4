To date, our understanding regarding the nature and effects of <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>cultures</b> of <b>the</b> Democratic and Republican parties suffers from lack of rigorous empirical examination. This study explores <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>cultures</b> of <b>the</b> <b>political</b> parties by examining the behaviors of congressional members seeking their party's nomination for another office. In this dissertation, I measure the extent which the Democratic and Republican parties' <b>political</b> <b>cultures</b> effect progressively ambitious members of the U. S. Senate and U. S. House of Representatives. In addition, I provide firsthand accounts of how these cultures impact state legislative careers. The empirical tests I present in this project largely support Freeman's earlier accounts as {{to the nature of the}} two major parties' <b>political</b> <b>cultures</b> at <b>the</b> national level. Based on firsthand accounts, however, I also provide evidence to suggest <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>cultures</b> of <b>the</b> parties are subject to short-term, localized forces at the state-level...|$|R
