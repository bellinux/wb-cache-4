25|$|I {{think that}} Amphiaraos {{most of all}} {{dedicated}} himself to interpreting dreams: it is clear that, when he was considered a god, he set up an oracle of dreams. And <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> to purify oneself, when someone comes to consult Amphiaraos, and the purification ritual is to sacrifice to the god, and people sacrifice to him and to all those whose names are on (the altar), and - when these things are finished – they sacrifice a ram and spread out its skin under themselves, lie down waiting for the revelation of a dream.|$|E
500|$|In 1970, Sinatra {{released}} Watertown, one of {{his most}} acclaimed concept albums, with music by Bob Gaudio (of the Four Seasons) and lyrics by Jake Holmes. However, it sold a mere 30,000 copies that year and reached a peak chart position of 101. He left Caesars Palace in September that year after an incident where executive Sanford Waterman pulled a gun on him. He performed several charity concerts with Count Basie at the Royal Festival Hall in London. On November 2, 1970, Sinatra recorded the last songs for Reprise Records before his self-imposed retirement, announced the following June at a concert in Hollywood {{to raise money for the}} Motion Picture and TV Relief Fund. He finished the concert with a [...] "rousing" [...] performance of [...] "That's Life", and stated [...] "Excuse me while I disappear" [...] as he left the stage. He told LIFE journalist Thomas Thompson that [...] "I've got things to do, like <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> not to do [...] at all for eight months... maybe a year", while Barbara Sinatra later claimed that Sinatra had grown [...] "tired of entertaining people, especially when all they really wanted were the same old tunes he had long ago become bored by". While he was in retirement, President Richard Nixon asked him to perform at a Young Voters Rally in anticipation of the upcoming campaign. Sinatra obliged and chose to sing [...] "My Kind of Town" [...] for the rally held in Chicago on October 20, 1972.|$|E
6000|$|She {{responded to}} his appeal. [...] "Don't <b>be</b> impatient. That's <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>Be</b> {{resigned}} to this luxury {{for a few}} days. The Voices {{will tell you what}} to do. They may be planning a surprise for you." ...|$|R
50|$|Once Basset was {{established}} in Valencia, practically exercising the function of Viceroy, and {{with most of the}} country under control of the Maulets (meaning, of the armed villagers), <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> to abolish all taxes to the Nobles.|$|R
60|$|When {{the boys}} rose the next morning, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> {{to look out}} of the window, {{to see what the}} promise was in respect to the weather. It was not raining, but the sky was {{overcast}} and heavy.|$|R
2500|$|Boulanger {{accepted}} pupils {{from any}} background; her only criterion {{was that they}} had to want to learn. She treated students differently depending on their ability: her talented students were expected to answer the most rigorous questions and perform well under stress. The less able students, who did not intend to follow a career in music, were treated more leniently. Each student had to be approached differently: [...] "When you accept a new pupil, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> to try to understand what natural gift, what intuitive talent he has. Each individual poses a particular problem." [...] "It does not matter what style you use, as long as you use it consistently." [...] Boulanger used a variety of teaching methods, including traditional harmony, score reading at the piano, species counterpoint, analysis, and sight-singing (using fixed-Do solfège).|$|E
6000|$|... "Consider!" [...] he ejaculated. [...] "I know. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> to eat breakfast. Then we'll {{lie down}} again until it's time for supper." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Yes; one hardly {{hoped to}} find one so soon. Well, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> {{to go down and}} search in the sand-hills for canoes.” ...|$|E
60|$|I am sure I did {{not know}} how we were to get ready, or what we were to do, but my main idea was that no time was to be lost in doing something. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> to awaken our friends.|$|R
60|$|When we met together, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> {{to consult}} as to taking Mina again into our confidence. <b>Things</b> <b>are</b> getting desperate, {{and it is}} at least a chance, though a {{hazardous}} one. As a preliminary step, I was released from my promise to her.|$|R
6000|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> {{a general}} chorus of [...] "there goes Bill!" [...] then the rabbit's voice alone [...] "catch him, {{you by the}} hedge!" [...] then silence, and then another {{confusion}} of voices, [...] "how was it, old fellow? what happened to you? {{tell us all about}} it." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> {{to realize}} {{exactly what he}} has done as yet. We may, then, get a light on what his task is to be.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{strikes me}} <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> {{to set the}} stove going. Guess if I'm {{going to get on}} a record hustle I want my breakfast." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, it's somewhere about here," [...] Bill said. [...] "I {{can hear}} the rushing of water, somewhere below. Now, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> to move these bales." ...|$|E
60|$|But God {{inspired}} Moses and the Prophets {{to write}} {{as they have}} written. They were not to tell men that <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> to <b>be</b> learnt was how to be rich; nor how to be strong; nor even how to be happy: but that <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> to <b>be</b> learnt was that God created the heaven and the earth.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> to <b>be</b> {{done was}} to detach the damaged saw from its frame.|$|R

6000|$|... "'Now <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> {{to provide}} you with clothes. I am expecting Colonel Stewart here, every minute, and he will see that you are made comfortable.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank {{goodness}} that is over," [...] Dick exclaimed. [...] "I {{thought they}} had no chance with us, here. Now <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> to get our wind again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I mustn't let it {{interfere}} with our business; {{and we have}} a good deal to do before we shall be settled here. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> lodgings." ...|$|E
60|$|Stooping down I saw {{the bear}} under the bed, now {{crowding}} himself {{back as far}} as possible into a corner. No part of his chain was exposed to view, and for a moment I did not see how I was going to get him out. But <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> {{to get rid of the}} woman.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> to {{find out}} what steps had been taken, if any, with {{insurance}} companies. For Iris's sake his inquiry had to be conducted quite openly. His object must seem none other than the discovery of Lady Harry Norland's present address. When bankers, insurance companies, and solicitors altogether have to conduct a piece of business {{it is not difficult to}} ascertain such a simple matter.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> listed <b>is</b> usually <b>the</b> {{brand name}} and generic {{name of the}} product. The other {{sections}} are as follows: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{expect that}} is it," [...] Mr. Blount agreed. [...] "And now, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> to get {{something}} to eat. When that is done, {{we will have a}} consultation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "he's sure a daisy, but I {{guess he}} can be taught, and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> to let him see you're not afraid of him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, as I have said, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> {{to get the}} lad out of prison. We'll {{trust to}} accident, chance, or {{whatever}} you choose to call it, for the balance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But surely,' said Violet, 'it {{cannot be}} the right {{beginning}} of being dutiful to resist <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>is</b> asked of you.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> to <b>be</b> done--and that instantly--was {{to inform}} Blanche {{that she was}} discovered, and to forbid her to stir in the matter.|$|R
60|$|But {{she stopped}} {{no longer even}} to reproach herself. She saw that <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> to <b>be</b> thought of was to get him indoors.|$|R
6000|$|... “We {{shall have}} plenty of time,” Stephen said, “that is, if the natives do not {{interfere}} with us. However, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> {{to find something to}} eat, for I am half famished.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll {{let that}} pass," [...] I {{answered}} shortly. [...] "I'm glad I did not. We {{are in an}} awkward place, and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> {{to decide how to}} get out of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If we do that, Skip will {{be sure he}} {{has driven}} us out. I think we'd better go right up to City Hall, an' start in straight; but <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is,</b> where'll we live?" ...|$|E
60|$|So Rollo asked Jonas what he {{had better}} do first, and Jonas told him that <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> to dig his ground all over, pretty deep; and, as it was {{difficult}} to begin it, Jonas said he would begin it for him. So Jonas began, and dug along one side, and instructed Rollo how to throw up the spadefuls of earth out of the way, so that the next spadeful would come up easier.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> to <b>be</b> {{undertaken}} in this weighty work, is a watchfulness over the failings and an inlargement of the dominion, of the Senses.|$|R
60|$|I wish I {{knew what}} he thought of the whole performance; but a friend of the lean man, who sat just in front of Arick, tells me what seemed to startle him most. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> when two of the {{officers}} came out with blackened faces, like minstrels, and began to dance. Arick was sure that they were really black, and his own people, and he was wonderfully surprised to see them dance in this new European style.|$|R
