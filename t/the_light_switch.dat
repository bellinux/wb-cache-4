5|$|The {{prototype}} and series trains have various differences. The {{number of}} seats was increased from 264 to 309 by changing the seat configuration in second class from 2+1 to 2+2. The information screens {{on the outside of}} the carriages were moved from the center of the carriages to next to the doors. There are also differences with <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>switch</b> logic, which often leads to the trains running with both front and tail lights on at the same end. The prototypes differed also originally by their restaurant car and Extra class features. They were modified in the mid-2000s to be similar to the series trains.|$|E
5|$|Finally, at the end, a bus {{shows up}} outside the Krusty Krab, despite Squidward {{claiming}} that the buses do not run this late at night. The bus then drops off a mysterious dark silhouette matching {{the description of the}} Hash-Slinging Slasher. SpongeBob and Squidward immediately realize that they are experiencing genuine supernatural events and panic. When the strange, unidentified figure enters the building, it is revealed he is simply a kid applying for a job, stating that he had tried calling the Krusty Krab by telephone earlier, but had hung up out of nervousness (the bus that he arrived in remains unexplained). However, Squidward then questions who was flickering the lights earlier. It is then revealed that the flickering lights are caused by doctored footage of Count Orlok from the 1922 silent film Nosferatu, with whom the characters are inexplicably familiar, flicking <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>switch</b> on and off.|$|E

50|$|Entanglement is an {{installation}} {{that consists of}} two neon signs that say “entanglement” on them that <b>light</b> up. <b>The</b> two signs are 72 inches by 14.75 inches in size. The two signs both have a <b>light</b> <b>switch</b> that turns both of them on and off. When one of <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>switches</b> is turned on, both signs light up. When one of <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>switches</b> is turned off, both signs are off. The two signs are placed in separate rooms, separate buildings, or even in separate countries. The idea came from what entanglement means in quantum physics which is where two particles behave as one.|$|R
2500|$|A toggle <b>light</b> <b>switch</b> is a switch, most {{commonly}} used to operate electric lights, permanently connected equipment, or electrical outlets whereby the switch handle does not control the contacts directly, but through an intermediate arrangement of internal springs and levers. <b>The</b> toggle <b>light</b> <b>switch</b> is safe, reliable, and durable, but produces a loud [...] "snap" [...] or [...] "click" [...] noise when a person's finger manually flips <b>the</b> toggle <b>light</b> <b>switch</b> into <b>the</b> on/off position.

40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} to {{demonstrate}} the application of modern Engineering Software to improve and advance the mechanical design processes of a low beam projector headlight. Nowadays, advanced finite element tools are able to run and coupled different physics modules to analyze complex geometries and their material combinations. The particular issue {{in this study is}} <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>switching</b> mechanism in a headlight structure design. During <b>lighting,</b> <b>the</b> jam of the low beam projector solenoid actuated pivot due to thermal expansions has been distressing the normal operation of the overall headlight structure. A comparison between the original and a new convection enhanced head lamp design is therefore scrutinized. For both cases, heat transfer analysis, where it was included natural convection, conduction, and radiation with a concentrated heat source are proposed in order to obtain the temperature distribution fields at <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>switching</b> mechanism. <b>The</b> results were used to run future structural stresses analyses where the average thermal expansion of the crankshaft mechanism was determined...|$|R

50|$|The {{major problem}} with this method is that {{in one of the}} four switch {{combinations}} the socket around the bulb is electrified at both of its terminals even though the bulb itself is not lit. As the shell may be energized, even with <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>switched</b> off, this poses a risk of electrical shock when changing the bulb. This method is therefore prohibited in modern building wiring.|$|R
