The data retention of EPROM, EAROM, EEPROM, and Flash may be limited by charge leaking from the floating gates of the memory cell <b>transistors.</b> <b>Leakage</b> is accelerated by high temperatures or radiation. Masked ROM and fuse/antifuse PROM do not suffer from this effect, as their data retention depends on physical rather than electrical permanence of the integrated circuit, although fuse re-growth was once a problem in some systems.|$|R

50|$|Due to <b>transistor</b> <b>leakage,</b> {{there is}} a limit to the {{theoretical}} efficiency of CMOS logic. This efficiency barrier ultimately prevents continued increases in computing power in power-constrained applications. While NEM relays have significant switching delays, their small size and fast switching speed when compared to other relays means that mechanical computing utilizing NEM Relays could prove a viable replacement for typical CMOS based integrated circuits, and break this CMOS efficiency barrier.|$|E
5000|$|The actual {{persistence}} of readable charge values and thus data in most DRAM memory cells is {{much longer than}} the refresh time, up to 1-10 seconds. [...] However <b>transistor</b> <b>leakage</b> currents vary widely between different memory cells on the same chip due to process variation. [...] In {{order to make sure}} that all the memory cells are refreshed before a single bit is lost, manufacturers must set their refresh times conservatively short.|$|E
5000|$|CPU speed {{improvements}} slowed significantly {{partly due}} to major physical barriers and partly because current CPU designs have already hit the memory wall in some sense. Intel summarized these causes in a 2005 document.“First of all, as chip geometries shrink and clock frequencies rise, the <b>transistor</b> <b>leakage</b> current increases, leading to excess power consumption and heat... Secondly, the advantages of higher clock speeds are in part negated by memory latency, since memory access times {{have not been able}} to keep pace with increasing clock frequencies. Third, for certain applications, traditional serial architectures are becoming less efficient as processors get faster (due to the so-called Von Neumann bottleneck), further undercutting any gains that frequency increases might otherwise buy. In addition, {{partly due to}} limitations in the means of producing inductance within solid state devices, resistance-capacitance (RC) delays in signal transmission are growing as feature sizes shrink, imposing an additional bottleneck that frequency increases don't address.” ...|$|E

We show that a triangular fin reduces leakage current by 70 % over a rectangular fin with the same base fin width. We describe how fin shape can be used to implement multithreshold nFinFETs without increasing chip area consumption. We also describe how by combining triangular fins with existing gate–source/drain underlap multithreshold techniques, it is possible to design ultralow-power nFinFETs with less than 1 pA/µm leakage current while maintaining high performing ION/IOFF, threshold voltage, and subthreshold swing.
