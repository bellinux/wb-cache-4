50|$|Although Labor {{controlled}} the House of Representatives with a 9-seat majority, it was 5 seats {{short of a}} majority in the Senate. Consequently, Labor faced constant opposition in getting its legislation through the parliament. By March 1974, a number of bills had been twice rejected by the Senate, which gave Whitlam the capacity to call a double dissolution, in which the entire parliament would be up for election. If the government were returned, it could reintroduce the bills in question, and if they were rejected by the Senate a third time, the government could seek <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>a</b> joint <b>sitting</b> of the Senate and House. In either event, a double dissolution would bring House and Senate elections back in synchronisation with each other.|$|R
50|$|However, Labor still {{lacked a}} {{majority}} in the Senate. Undaunted, Hawke pushed ahead with the proposal. The Constitution provides that where a double dissolution has taken place, the relevant bills may be reintroduced a third time, and if they are defeated a third time, the governor-general may agree <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>a</b> joint <b>sitting,</b> which Labor would control numerically due to having won a large majority in the House. Despite the obstacles it had faced until this point, the passage of the Australia Card Bill now seemed ultimately assured. It was introduced for a third time to the House of Representatives, where it was passed on 16 September. It was introduced to the Senate the following day, and debated on 18, 21 and 23 September.|$|R
5000|$|It now became {{irrelevant}} {{that the}} Bill would be passed by <b>a</b> joint <b>sitting,</b> because the Opposition would use its {{numbers in the}} Senate to indefinitely delay its practical implementation. Although the government could have sought to force the issue by having certain matters tested in the High Court, public opinion had now come into play, {{and it was also}} decidedly against the idea of identification cards. There were what Michael Kirby characterised as [...] "unprecedented demonstrations of popular opposition", with rallies all over the country, and newspapers and talk-back radio inundated with anti-Australia Card sentiment. Graham Greenleaf, writing in The Computer Law and Security Report, Vol 3 No 6, March/April 1988, wrote [...] "There has never been a debate like it in the letters page; there has never been such a cry of opposition from the nation over one topic…". There was a greater number of signatories on various petitions to parliament against the Australia Card than on any previous series of related parliamentary petitions. Under these circumstances, Hawke chose not to proceed with his plan <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>a</b> joint <b>sitting,</b> and the Australia Card Bill was abandoned.|$|R
6000|$|Soon the sleigh {{appeared}} in sight, {{coming up the}} river at full speed, and a loud [...] "hurrah!" [...] from {{the men at the}} gate, told the visitor that he was a welcome guest. It was a dog-sleigh--a sort of conveyance much used by the fur-traders in winter travelling. In form, it was as like as possible to a tin slipper bath. It might also be compared to a shoe. If the reader will try to conceive of a shoe large enough <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>a</b> man, <b>sitting</b> with his legs out before him, that will give him a good idea of the shape of a dog cariole. There is sometimes an ornamental curve in front. It is made of two thin hardwood planks curled up in front, with a light frame-work of wood, covered over with deer or buffalo skin, and painted in a very gay manner. Four dogs are usually harnessed to it, and these are quite sufficient to drag a man on a journey of many days, over every sort of country, where there is no road whatever. Dogs are much used for hauling little sledges in that country in winter. The traveller sits wrapped up so completely in furs, that nothing but his head is visible. He is attended by a driver on snow-shoes, who is armed with a large whip. No reins are used. If the snow is hard, as is usually the case on the surface of a lake or river, the driver walks behind and <b>holds</b> on <b>to</b> <b>a</b> tail-line, to prevent the dogs from running away. If the traveller's way lies through the woods, the snow is so soft and deep that the poor dogs are neither willing nor able to run away. It is {{as much as they can}} do to walk; so the driver goes before them, in this case, and beats down the snow with his snow-shoes--"beats the track," [...] as it is called. The harness of the dogs is usually very gay, and covered with little bells which give forth a cheerful tinkling sound.|$|R
