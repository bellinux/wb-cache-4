Nineteen participants drove two visually distinct virtual environments (high and low visual cues). In addition, each of these worlds was experienced with and without GVS. Post-drive scores on the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) were used to evaluate the effect of GVS on SAS. In addition, three driving variables were measured to examine driving performance: steering variability, lane departures, and average vehicular speed. GVS application while driving resulted in significant decreases in total SSQ and disorientation symptoms.

The effect of both vestibular and cutaneous stimulation was also evaluated on the naturalistic driving behaviour of curves.

Conversely, galvanic vestibular stimulation while driving curves resulted in vehicular speeds that were reflective of natural real world driving behaviour and similar SSQ scores to control. These results support the theory that cutaneous stimulation of the neck is a worthy alternative to vestibular stimulation for reducing SAS especially in scenarios requiring complex visual scenes; however, if naturalistic driving behaviour (of curves) is important, vestibular stimulation remains the better choice as it can reduce SAS symptoms (in virtual environments with low visual stimuli) and also promotes naturalistic driving behaviours...|$|E

Neighboring supporting cells swelled and filled the space beneath the degenerating hair cell. Between three and five supporting cells participate in the reparative process. The distribution of cytokeratin is also altered during scar formation. The area once occupied by the hair cell becomes filled with cytokeratin-rich processes of supporting cells.

This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate (PtdInsP 2) to inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (InsP 3) and 1, 2 -diacylglycerol (DG) which act as second messengers.

However, nothing {{is known about the}} the InsP 3 second messenger system in the vestibule. In this study, the receptor-mediated release of inositol phosphates (InsPs) in <b>the</b> <b>vestibular</b> <b>sensory</b> epithelia was compared to that in the cochlear sensory epithelia of Fischer- 344 rats. After preincubation of the isolated intact tissues with myo-[3 H] in-ositol, stimulation with the cholinergic agonist carbamylcholine or the P 2 purinergic agonist ATP-[gamma]-S resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in the formation of [3 H]InsPs in both epithelia. Similarly, the muscarinic cholinergic agonist muscarine enhanced InsPs release in both organs, while the nicotinic cholinergic agonist dimethylphenylpiperadinium (DMPP) was ineffective. The muscarinic cholinergic antagonist atropine completely suppressed the InsPs release induced by carbamylcholine, while the nicotinic cholinergic antagonist mecamylamine was ineffective. Potassium depolarization did not alter unstimulated or carbamylcholine-stimulated release of InsPs in either organ. In both tissues, the P 2 purinergic agonist [alpha],[beta]-methylene ATP also increased InsPs release, but the P 1 purinergic agonist adenosine did not. These results extend our previous observations in the organ of Corti of the guinea pig to the rat and suggest a similar control of the InsP 3 second messenger <b>system</b> in <b>the</b> <b>vestibular</b> <b>sensory</b> epithelia.

40|$|In this paper, we {{show that}} {{differences}} in reaction times (RT) to self-motion depend {{not only on the}} duration of the profile, but also on the actual time course of the acceleration. We previously proposed models that described direction discrimination thresholds for rotational and translational motions based on the dynamics of <b>the</b> <b>vestibular</b> <b>sensory</b> organs (otoliths and semi-circular canals). As these models have the potential to describe RT for different motion profiles (e. g., trapezoidal versus triangular acceleration profiles or varying profile durations), we validated these models by measuring RTs in human observers for a direction discrimination task using both translational and rotational motions varying in amplitude, duration and acceleration profile shape in a within-subjects design. In agreement with previous studies, amplitude and duration were found to affect RT, and importantly, we found an influence of the profile shape on RT. The models are able to fit the measured RTs with an accuracy of around 5 ms, and the best-fitting parameters are similar to those found from identifying the models based on threshold measurements. This confirms the validity of the modeling approach and links perceptual thresholds to RT. By establishing a link between vestibular thresholds for self-motion and RT, we show {{for the first time that}} RTs to purely inertial motion stimuli can be used as an alternative to threshold measurements for identifying self-motion perception models. This is advantageous, since RT tasks are less challenging for participants and make assessment of vestibular function less fatiguing.

Vestibular impairment occurs following damage to <b>the</b> <b>vestibular</b> <b>sensory</b> cells in <b>the</b> crista ampullaris and it manifests with ataxia and nystagmus. The subject complains of gait disturbances and oscillopsia (visual blurring with head movement) in the absence of prior existence of vertigo (Kisilevsky et al. 2004). All aminoglycosides exhibit toxicity on both the cochlea and the vestibules but often not in equal proportions though tobramycin is known to affect both the cochlea and vestibules equally (Guan 2011). Aminoglycosides such as streptomycin and gentamycin are predominantly vestibulotoxic whereas neomycin and kanamycin are more toxic on the cochlea (Guan 2011).|$|R
50|$|Otology is {{a branch}} of {{medicine}} which studies normal and pathological anatomy and physiology of the ear (hearing and <b>vestibular</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>systems</b> and related structures and functions) {{as well as their}} diseases, diagnosis and treatment. Otologic surgery generally refers to surgery of the middle ear and mastoid related to chronic otitis media, such as tympanoplasty, or ear drum surgery, ossiculoplasty, or surgery of the hearing bones, and mastoidectomy. Otology also includes surgical treatment of conductive hearing loss, such as stapedectomy surgery for otosclerosis. Neurotology, a related field of medicine and subspecialty of Otolaryngology, is the study of diseases of the inner ear, which can lead to hearing and balance disorders. Neurotologic surgery generally refers to surgery of the inner ear or surgery that involves entering the inner ear with risk to the hearing and balance organs, including labyrinthectomy, cochlear implant surgery, and surgery for tumors of the temporal bone, such as intracanlicular acoustic neuromas. Neurotology is expanded to include surgery of the lateral skull base to treat intracranial tumors related to the ear and surrounding nerve and vascular structures, such as large cerebellar pontine angle acoustic neuromas, glomus jugulare tumors and facial nerve tumors.|$|R
40|$|CHD 7 is a chromodomain gene mutated in CHARGE syndrome, a {{multiple}} anomaly condition characterized by ocular c oloboma, h eart defects, a tresia of the choanae, r etarded growth and development, g enital hypoplasia, and e ar defects including deafness and semicircular canal dysgenesis. Mice with heterozygous Chd 7 deficiency have circling behavior and semicircular canal defects and {{are an excellent}} animal model for exploring the pathogenesis of CHARGE features. Inner ear vestibular defects have been characterized in heterozygous Chd 7 -deficient embryos and early postnatal mice, {{but it is not}} known whether vestibular defects persist throughout adulthood in Chd 7 -deficient mice or whether <b>the</b> <b>vestibular</b> <b>sensory</b> epithelia and their associated innervation and function are intact. Here we describe a detailed analysis of inner ear vestibular structures in mature mice that are heterozygous for a Chd 7 -deficient, gene-trapped allele (Chd 7 Gt/+). Chd 7 Gt/+ mice display variable asymmetric lateral and posterior semicircular canal malformations, as well as defects in <b>vestibular</b> <b>sensory</b> epithelial innervation despite the presence of intact hair cells in the target organs. These observations have important functional implications for understanding the clinical manifestations of CHD 7 mutations in humans and for designing therapies to treat inner ear vestibular dysfunction.

40|$|Mutations of SLC 26 A 4 are {{a common}} cause of human hearing loss {{associated}} with enlargement of <b>the</b> <b>vestibular</b> aqueduct. SLC 26 A 4 encodes pendrin, an anion exchanger expressed {{in a variety of}} epithelial cells in <b>the</b> cochlea, <b>the</b> <b>vestibular</b> labyrinth and <b>the</b> endolymphatic sac. Slc 26 a 4 (Δ/Δ) mice are devoid of pendrin and develop a severe enlargement of the membranous labyrinth, fail to acquire hearing and balance, and thereby provide a model for the human phenotype. Here, we generated a transgenic mouse line that expresses human SLC 26 A 4 controlled by the promoter of ATP 6 V 1 B 1. Crossing this transgene into the Slc 26 a 4 (Δ/Δ) line restored protein expression of pendrin in the endolymphatic sac without inducing detectable expression in the cochlea or <b>the</b> <b>vestibular</b> <b>sensory</b> organs. <b>The</b> transgene prevented abnormal enlargement of the membranous labyrinth, restored a normal endocochlear potential, normal pH gradients between endolymph and perilymph in the cochlea, normal otoconia formation in <b>the</b> <b>vestibular</b> labyrinth and normal sensory functions of hearing and balance. Our study demonstrates that restoration of pendrin to the endolymphatic sac is sufficient to restore normal inner ear function. This finding in conjunction with our previous report that pendrin expression is required for embryonic development but not for the maintenance of hearing opens the prospect that a spatially and temporally limited therapy will restore normal hearing in human patients carrying a variety of mutations of SLC 26 A 4...|$|R
