40|$|The DDP (Demand-driven/Pruning) {{analysis}} algorithm {{allows us}} to perform data-flow analyses of programming languages that are dynamically typed and have higher-order control flow, such as Smalltalk or Scheme. Because it is demand-driven and employs search pruning, it scales to large code bases. However, versions of the algorithm previously described [19] do not handle data polymorphism well, conservatively merging separate data flows that go through distinct instantiations of a collection type. In this paper, we describe a new extension to DDP that helps to disentangle these flows, permitting more precise results. The extension is based on source-tagging classes so that each reference to a class in the source code yields a subdivision of the type associated with that class. An initial implementation of this polyvariant analysis {{has been added to}} the DDP-based <b>tool</b> <b>Chuck,</b> a part of the integrated Squeak program-development environment; we show examples of the tool in action...|$|E

40|$|In the {{representation}} of the machine tool’s manufacturing accuracy, involving thermo-elastic deformations in the <b>tool</b> and its <b>chuck</b> in the considerations is unavoidable, since a portion of the process heat is transmitted into the tool. Capture and estimation of the resultant thermo-elastic deformations is of significant importance for their compensation and correction. This paper presents the investigation and evaluation of thermo-elastic displacements in the tool-chuck system resulting from the heat flows from machining. The temperature and displacement measurements were conducted on a test bed with measuring equipment. In the first series of experiments, the transient heat conduction in the stationary <b>tool</b> and the <b>chucking</b> system, decoupled from the motor spindle, was captured. The chucks were compared in terms of their working principle. The identification of the thermal boundary and contact conditions was assisted by Finite Element models. The paper describes the experimental setups, the methods of measurement and the numerical models. An additional section discusses the determination of realistic heat sources generated in the machining process. Since measurement of these heat flows is either impossible or expensive and time-consuming, they are determined by numerical simulation of the machining process itself. This way, it can be determined to what extent the heat flows generated in the experiments by means of heating cartridge or induction correspond to those generated by the actual machining heat sources...|$|R

The temperature fields in the cutting tool and the clamping system can be intentionally influenced by air cooling. The cooling influence cannot be readily evaluated in practice.

In these models, the relevant air fluxes around the tool have to be considered. The challenge is to define all of the boundary and transfer conditions.

40|$|A strong need {{has existed}} {{to develop a}} hard turning process that can replace {{grinding}} as a finishing process, due to its huge benefits in surface integrity and manufacturing flexibility over finish grinding and superfinishing. Due to the significant advances in machine tool accuracy and cutting <b>tool</b> material properties, <b>chucking,</b> {{which has not been}} improved significantly over the last several decades, has become the weakest link in the whole machine processing system. However, the understanding of chucking accuracy is lacking, nor is any systematic research on the improvement of chucking accuracy is available in literature. In this study, methods which enable evaluating, and improving chucking accuracy of a cylindrical workpiece were developed. This study performed systematic error identification and the analyses of the characteristics of the factors that affect chucking accuracy. Then, the formulations of the relation between the measurable factors and the chucking error were carried out as well as a chucking error map. From these analyses and formulations, methods for compensating the error components on chucking accuracy were developed. The methods were tested using the rings of a taper-roller bearing. From the tests of the methods, it was proven that hard turning alone, without any other finishing process such as grinding, can satisfy the same level of form accuracy that is currently achieved by finish grinding. With the developed chucking methods and strategies, the concentricity error could be reduced significantly or eliminated. For the case studied, we achieved about 20 times improvement in concentricity and 30 times in repeatability. The knowledge, created by this research on the improvement of chucking accuracy, can be applied to other operations requiring precision holding of a workpiece or a tool, as well as to general turning operations. ...|$|R
