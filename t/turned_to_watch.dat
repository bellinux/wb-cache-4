25|$|When the {{helicopter}} landed, Cleland jumped out, {{followed by the}} two soldiers. They ducked beneath the rotors and <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> the liftoff. Cleland reached {{down to pick up}} a grenade that he believed had popped off his flak jacket. It exploded and the blast slammed him backward, shredding both his legs and one arm.|$|E
60|$|Oliver took {{no further}} notice {{of him at}} the time, however, but <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> {{the flow of the}} molten tin.|$|E
60|$|Joshua {{declined}} argument, and I <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> Oliver, who {{had covered}} {{his face with his}} hands, and seemed to be weeping.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is thy <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch,</b> Priest," [...] said Gwenoch to Ailward. [...] "So {{keep the}} door well, for I am worn out with hunting," [...] and so fell asleep.|$|R
6000|$|... "But a ship is long, long o' comin'," [...] said Slag to Jarring as he {{accompanied}} {{the latter part}} of the way to the beacon-fire one night when it was Black Ned's <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you make}} that remark out of {{interest}} in me, I have merely to assure you that I am impervious to cold. I should not mind taking my <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> the mill one of these summer nights, armed with your musket, Joe." ...|$|R
60|$|The robber <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> its fall and, {{filled with}} sudden anger, the boy grabbed the weapon, pointed {{it at his}} enemy, and pressed the button. Down tumbled the Turk, without a cry, and lay {{motionless}} {{at the foot of}} the wall.|$|E
60|$|Helena {{tightened}} {{her fingers}} on his knee. She felt herself stinging with painful joy; {{but one of the}} ladies was looking her curiously. She leaned back in her place, and <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> at the shocks of corn strike swiftly, in long rows, across her vision.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, Doctor, I will obey your orders, {{but it is}} {{only fair}} to say that Mr. Bathurst's remarks are only in answer to {{something}} I said," [...] and Isobel <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> the race, but with an interest less ardent than she had before felt.|$|E

60|$|The women took it by <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch,</b> and Godfrey, {{worn out}} by the {{excitement}} of the day, slept until morning. Alexis was restless, moving uneasily and muttering to himself. His eyes were open, but he took no notice {{of what was going on}} around him. The surgeon they had first seen came alone.|$|R
50|$|Railways have {{a strong}} rivalry with Royals Football Club. Big crowds always <b>turn</b> up <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> the game.|$|R
60|$|Teddy was on {{the point}} of saying he fancied that fear of the {{ultimate}} result might have some share in this alleged nervous attack; but, fortunately, he checked himself in time, and <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> Poyor who was hiding the boat beneath an ingeniously constructed screen of leaves.|$|E
60|$|She <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> {{him as he}} {{came along}} the aisle behind the boxes; her head still throbbed with the dying {{pulsations}} of the music. Everybody seemed to know and greet him with cordial readiness of hand. He came along easily, his handsome blonde face showing little more expression at meeting her than the others, yet {{when he saw her}} rapt and flushed face he was touched.|$|E
6000|$|The shame, when {{caught at}} last and cornered: the {{grinning}} face that would stop to watch; the careless jokes of passers-by, regarding {{the whole thing}} but as a sparrows' squabble: worst of all, perhaps, the rare pity! The after humiliation when, finally released, I would dart away, followed by shouted taunts and laughter; every eye <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> me, shrinking by; my whole small carcass shaking with dry sobs of bitterness and rage! ...|$|E
25|$|At home, over 12,000 <b>turned</b> up <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> Blackpool's {{reserves}} beat Burnley. Financially, {{the club}} {{had never been}} in a better position.|$|R
60|$|LARRY. I'm {{sorry to}} {{disappoint}} you, father; but I {{told you it}} would be no use. And now I think the candidate had better retire and leave you to discuss his successor. [He takes a newspaper from the table and goes away through the shrubbery amid dead silence, all <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> him until he passes out of sight round the corner of the house].|$|R
6000|$|... "Our best {{plan will}} be to leave it alone till morning. If we sit outside the hut, and take it in <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch,</b> we shall hear him when he moves, which he is sure to do when it gets dark. It will be a still night, and we should hear a stick break half a mile away. We shall catch him, safe enough, before he has gone far." ...|$|R
6000|$|The train whistled, and {{everybody}} <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> {{it as it}} came pushing around the bluff like a huge hound on a trail, its nose close to the ground. Among the first to alight was Sanford, in a shining new silk hat and a new suit of clothes. He was smiling gaily as he fought {{his way through the}} crowd to his wife's side. [...] "Hello!" [...] he shouted. [...] "I thought I'd see you all here." ...|$|E
60|$|So low had {{the voices}} fallen that the {{listener}} {{could not have}} caught the words had not his ear been strained to the utmost. He did hear all, and his wasted face flashed with the wrath of a young man, then grew pale and stern as he <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> his wife. She stood apart from the others talking to Sir Jasper, who looked unusually handsome and debonair as he fanned her with a devoted air.|$|E
60|$|Like a flash he sprang {{across the}} opening to the pile of arrows. Gathering up all he could carry under one arm, he {{overturned}} the seething cauldron with a kick, {{and disappeared into the}} foliage above just as the first of the returning natives entered the gate {{at the far end of}} the village street. Then he <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> the proceeding below, poised like some wild bird ready to take swift wing at the first sign of danger.|$|E
50|$|Huntington Stadium's record {{attendance}} for a rugby league {{match was}} set on 5 January 1990 when 4,977 <b>turned</b> up <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> a Division 2 match against Halifax.|$|R
50|$|The 1927-28 season {{also saw}} the club's record ever home attendance, as 47,289 people <b>turned</b> up <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> an FA Cup fifth round match with Tottenham Hotspur.|$|R
50|$|Incidentally, the Maracana Stadium {{holds the}} all-time volleyball {{attendance}} record from when 95,000 <b>turned</b> out <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> Brazil beat the USSR in an open-air friendly game in 1983.|$|R
60|$|Peter {{promptly}} {{crossed his}} heart and promised that he wouldn't tell a single soul. Mrs. Meadow Lark seemed to feel better. Right away she flew back and Peter <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> her. He saw her disappear in the grass, but it wasn't where {{he had found the}} nest. Peter waited a few minutes, thinking that he would see her rise into the air again and fly over to the nest. But he waited in vain. Then with a puzzled look on his face, he turned to look up at Carol.|$|E
60|$|A minute later, {{with a low}} grating sound, we ran aground upon a gravelly leach. My bundle {{was thrown}} ashore, I stepped after it, and a seaman pushed the prow off again, {{springing}} in as his comrade backed her into deep water. Already the glow in the west had vanished, the storm-cloud was half up the heavens, and a thick blackness had gathered over the ocean. As I <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> the vanishing boat a keen wet blast flapped in my face, {{and the air was}} filled with the high piping of the wind and with the deep thunder of the sea.|$|E
60|$|He {{smiled to}} {{himself at the}} result of his very uncivilized and ungallant action, for he had not lowered his own eyes when they met those of the young woman. She was very young, and equally good to look upon. Further, there was {{something}} rather familiar about her that set Tarzan to wondering where he had seen her before. He resumed his former position, and presently he was aware that she had arisen and was leaving the deck. As she passed, Tarzan <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> her, in the hope that he might discover a clew to satisfy his mild curiosity as to her identity.|$|E

50|$|On 27 May 2012, {{less than}} two months before the event, The Sunday Times {{reported}} another potential logistical problem facing games organisers. In light {{of the size of the}} crowds <b>turning</b> out <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> the torch relay, estimates of crowd sizes for the marathon were revised and now suggest that up to 1.5 million people might <b>turn</b> up <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> the event. As there is only a pavement capacity of about 150,000 along the key streets of the event, contingency plans to avoid dangerous overcrowding are being considered.|$|R
40|$|A {{receiver}} evades his would-be tackler and leaps, {{stretching out}} his fingertips for a pass that {{hangs in the}} air for an eternity. Etched with apprehension, the faces of teammates and opponents alike <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> the ball's pilgrimage as it traces a graceful arc over the dust and sweat. With balance and purpose it seeks its target like a marksman's bullet, but only fate knows how this tiny leather traveler's journey ends. University of Maryland football, circa 1930...|$|R
60|$|The others {{agreed with}} him, for {{they had seen}} that smear of smoke on the skyline since early morning. Then they <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> the engineer, {{who came out of}} a door close by, and glanced up to weather, {{blinking}} in the bitter wind. He was a big loosely-built man in dungarees, with the pallid face of one accustomed to the half-light and heat of the engine-room, but in his case it was also unhealthily puffy. Then he slouched right aft, and stood still again looking down at the dial of the taffrail log which records the distance run, while he fumbled in a curious aimless fashion with the blackened rag in his hand.|$|E
60|$|My landlady {{was already}} {{awaiting}} {{me at the}} place appointed, and we walked off together towards the house. It had been a prudent arrangement, for we met and passed {{at least half a}} dozen strangers before we arrived there, and one and all by the unfeigned astonishment with which they <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> our two figures out of sight (for I stooped once or twice, as if to tie my shoelace, in order to see), clearly proved themselves to belong to that type of humanity to which my new acquaintance had referred frigidly as THEY. Vanity of vanities, when one old loitering gentleman did not so much as lift an eyelid at me--he was so absorbed in own thoughts--I felt a pang of annoyance.|$|E
60|$|She {{rose from}} her {{reclining}} posture and sat up in the boat, willing, if she could, to resist the rush of thoughts that urged themselves along with the conjecture how far the boat had carried her. Why need she mind? This was a sheltered nook where there were simple villagers who would not harm her. For a little while, at least, she might rest and resolve on nothing. Presently she would go and get some bread and milk, {{and then she would}} nestle in the green quiet, and feel that there was a pause in her life. She <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> the crescent-shaped valley, that she might get back the soothing sense of peace and beauty which she had felt in her first waking.|$|E
50|$|The Asian Festival of Speed (AFOS) {{was held}} at the circuit from October 20, 2006 to October 22, 2006, when a record 33,000 people <b>turned</b> up <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> the races.|$|R
50|$|A {{precedent}} {{was set in}} June, 2001 {{when the}} island's first professional men's rugby team lost to Cook Islands 28-8. Almost all of the island's 1700 residents <b>turned</b> out <b>to</b> <b>watch.</b>|$|R
