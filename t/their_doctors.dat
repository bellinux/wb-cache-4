25|$|In the Netherlands, {{patients}} and <b>their</b> <b>doctors</b> (GPs) have different {{perceptions of the}} efficacy of diagnostic and dietary interventions in IBS. Patients consider food intolerance and GPs regard lack of fibre as the main etiologic dietary factor. It {{has been suggested that}} Dutch GPs explore the patients' expectations and potentially incorporate these in their approach to IBS patients.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{consumers}} {{lower costs}} by asking <b>their</b> <b>doctor</b> for generic drugs when available.

25|$|Most {{symptoms}} of breast disorders, including most lumps, do not {{turn out to}} represent underlying breast cancer. Fewer than 20% of lumps, for example, are cancerous, and benign breast diseases such as mastitis and fibroadenoma of the breast are more common causes of breast disorder symptoms. Nevertheless, {{the appearance of a}} new symptom should be taken seriously by both patients and <b>their</b> <b>doctors,</b> because of the possibility of an underlying breast cancer at almost any age.|$|E
25|$|The TMAS {{has been}} proven {{reliable}} using test-retest reliability. O’Connor, Lorr, and Stafford found there were five general factors in the scale: chronic anxiety or worry, increased physiological reactivity, sleep disturbances associated with inner strain, sense of personal inadequacy, and motor tension. This study showed that persons administered the test could be display different anxiety levels across these areas. O’Connor, Lorr, and Stafford’s realization allows patients and <b>their</b> <b>doctors</b> to better understand which dimension of anxiety needs to be addressed.|$|E

25|$|Several works {{published}} in the 1950s {{drew attention to the}} damaging and sometimes fatal effects of psychosurgery, though their authors were not opposed to the treatment. Maurice Partridge’s follow-up of 300 patients operated on by McKissock revealed a higher death rate than was usually acknowledged, with six per cent of patients dying wholly or {{partly as a result of}} the surgery. The book described how many patients, even those whose surgery was considered as success by <b>their</b> <b>doctors,</b> were left with serious disabilities.|$|E
25|$|There are two bright spots. One: We {{can improve}} the quality of care and cut costs without rationing. There are models out there for how to do it right -- the Mayo Clinic, the Geisinger Clinic in Pennsylvania, the Cleveland Clinic and California's Kaiser Permanente {{are just a few of}} the {{organized}} group practices that are doing a better job for less. <b>Their</b> <b>doctors</b> are better than average at using the best medical evidence available. They're more likely to be using electronic medical records, which can help keep track of patients who have multiple physicians and need complex care. And they're less likely to provide unnecessary care.|$|E
25|$|Not {{everyone}} with rheumatoid arthritis responds favorably to treatment with methotrexate, but multiple studies and reviews {{showed that the}} majority of people receiving methotrexate for up to one year had less pain, functioned better, had fewer swollen and tender joints, and had less disease activity overall as reported by themselves and <b>their</b> <b>doctors.</b> X-rays also showed that the progress of the disease slowed or stopped in many people receiving methotrexate, with the progression being completely halted in about 30% of those receiving the drug. Those individuals with rheumatoid arthritis treated with methotrexate have been found to have a lower risk of cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarctions (heart attacks) and strokes.|$|E
50|$|For {{patients}} with these symptoms, <b>their</b> <b>doctor</b> will check <b>their</b> {{heart rate and}} blood pressure, and may recommend they see a specialist, like a cardiologist or neurologist. For children with ME/CFS {{who do not have}} heart or blood vessel disease, <b>their</b> <b>doctor</b> might suggest patients increase daily fluid and salt intake and use support stockings. If symptoms do not improve, prescription medication can be considered.|$|R

25|$|This, of course, is {{not always}} true. Patients do {{sometimes}} lie to <b>their</b> <b>doctors</b> (to get painkillers {{to which they are}} not entitled, for example). Hearsay exceptions do not mandate that a trier of fact (the jury or, in non-jury trials, the judge) accept the hearsay statement as being true. Hearsay exceptions mean only that the trier of fact will be informed of the hearsay statement and will be allowed to consider it when deciding on a verdict in the case. The jury is free to disregard a hearsay statement if the jury does not believe it. The hearsay rule controls only what out-of-court statements a trier of fact gets to consider in deciding a case, not how they consider the out-of-court statements.|$|E
500|$|The Detroit Free Press {{noted that}} Ohio State's players sought {{to slow the}} pace of Michigan's [...] "hurry up" [...] style of play.

The Ohio men could not stand the gaff, and <b>their</b> <b>doctors</b> and trainer ran more yards than both teams put together." [...] After the game, coach Yost commented on Ohio State's tactic: [...] "Their laying down for time took much of the vim out of our team, and rested their tired out players." ...|$|E

Patients who are invited {{to take part in}} a trial are advised to ask, among other things, for a written guarantee that the trial has been publicly registered, and that the main outcome of the trial will be published within a year of its completion.

500|$|On {{the morning}} of 9 May, Tegetthoff learned that a Danish {{squadron}} consisting of the steam frigates [...] and [...] and the corvette [...] were patrolling off the island of Heligoland. Tegetthoff took the five ships under his command out to attack the Danish vessels, resulting in the Battle of Heligoland. Basilisk and the other Prussian ships were too slow {{to keep pace with}} Schwarzenberg and Radetzky. After Schwarzenberg caught fire, Tegetthoff broke off the action and escaped to the neutral waters around Heligoland, where the ships remained until early the next day. During the period off Heligoland, the Prussian vessels sent <b>their</b> <b>doctors</b> to the Austrian frigates to help tend to their wounded. The next morning, the ships returned to Cuxhaven. Though the Danish squadron had won a tactical victory at Heligoland, the arrival of Austrian warships in the North Sea forced the Danes to withdraw their blockade.|$|E

2500|$|For example, in the United States, {{the patent}} rights given to {{pharmaceutical}} companies {{encourage them to}} charge high prices (above marginal cost) and to advertise to convince patients to persuade <b>their</b> <b>doctors</b> to prescribe the drugs.

However, this practice has been criticized as potentially dangerous, especially by those who feel that only doctors can reliably assess contraindications, risk/benefit ratios, and an individual's overall suitability for use of a medication.
