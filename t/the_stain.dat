5|$|By {{the end of}} 1955, {{thousands}} of political prisoners had returned home, and told their experiences of the gulag labor camps. Continuing investigation into the abuses brought home the full breadth of Stalin's crimes to his successors. Khrushchev believed that once <b>the</b> <b>stain</b> of Stalinism was removed, the Party would inspire loyalty among the people. Beginning in October 1955, Khrushchev fought to tell the delegates to the upcoming 20th Party Congress about Stalin's crimes. Some of his colleagues, including Molotov and Malenkov, opposed the disclosure, and managed {{to persuade him to}} make his remarks in a closed session.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, Clairmont {{became a}} lover of the Romantic poet Lord Byron, and Mary Godwin and Shelley had a second child on 24 January 1816, who was named William after Godwin. In February, Imlay went to visit the Shelleys, who had settled in Bishopsgate. Godwin's debts {{continued}} to mount, and while he demanded money from Shelley, Godwin still refused to see either him or his daughter. At this time, Charles Clairmont (Imlay's step-brother), frustrated with {{the tension in the}} Godwin household, left for France and refused to help the family any further. At around the same time, Claire Clairmont, Mary Godwin, and Shelley left for the Continent, seeking Byron. Godwin was aghast. He relied on Shelley's money, and <b>the</b> <b>stain</b> on his family's reputation only increased when the public learned that the group had left to join the rakish Byron.|$|E
25|$|The stains or mineral powder (such as Hematite) are earth {{colors in}} various hues of brown, black, green, and blue. These colors are also accented by the {{original}} colors of the clay (red, white, or gray) to provide a further rich texture. After <b>the</b> <b>stain</b> {{is applied to the}} ceramic piece, Al-Zahawi would use a cloth with turpentine to remove some of <b>the</b> <b>stain</b> and reveal the texture of clay and patterns of the rib tool. <b>The</b> <b>stain</b> is then protected by a transparent wax that has limited shine but nevertheless allows the colors and shades of <b>the</b> <b>stain</b> and the rich texture to become more pronounced. Al-Zahawi has also experimented with engraving designs on the surface of certain sculptures to bring out a particular area or special form. With staining versus glazing, these engravings are extenuated and truly give the art a unique and exotic feel.|$|E
50|$|There are {{basically}} three Mogu <b>staining</b> methods: <b>the</b> <b>staining</b> by smearing (渲染; Xuàn-Rǎn), <b>the</b> <b>staining</b> by dotting (点染; Diǎn-Rǎn), and <b>the</b> <b>staining</b> by just filling colours (填染; Tián-Rǎn).|$|R
40|$|Cotton fabric was artificially {{stained with}} four kinds of soil derived from food: red wine, coffee, tea and green tea. <b>The</b> <b>stained</b> fabric samples {{were allowed to}} stand at room {{temperature}} for up to five months and then subjected to color measurements and laundering tests using a standard detergent. The color change (in lightness and/or shade) of <b>the</b> <b>stains</b> increased and <b>the</b> washability became poor with an increase in standing time. Heat treatment on <b>the</b> <b>stained</b> fabrics induced similar effects to standing. Changes in color and washability of <b>the</b> <b>stains</b> can be attributed to oxidation and polymerization of polyphenolic colorants contained in <b>the</b> <b>stains...</b>|$|R

40|$|Discrete {{localization}} of stain in pericanalicular granules {{was found}} in I 0 ~ frozen sections of formol-phosphate-sucrose-fixed liver <b>stained</b> by <b>the</b> Gomori acid phosphatase technique and examined in the light microscope. <b>The</b> <b>staining</b> patterns, before and after treatment with Triton X- 100 and lecithinase, were identical with those previously reported for formolcalcium-fixed material treated in the same way, {{and it can be}} assumed that <b>the</b> <b>stained</b> granules are identical with "lysosomes. " Examination in the light microscope of <b>the</b> <b>staining</b> patterns and lead penetration in fixed blocks and slices of various dimensions showed nuclear staining and other artefacts to be present, produced by the different rates of penetration of the various components of <b>the</b> <b>staining</b> medium into <b>the</b> tissue.

25|$|Born in the Württemberg royal {{residence}} on 13 October 1748, Werneck {{entered the}} service of Habsburg Austria in 1764 as an Oberleutnant in the Weid-Runkel Infantry Regiment Nr. 28. Shortly afterward, he transferred to <b>the</b> <b>Stain</b> Infantry Regiment Nr. 50 as a Hauptmann (captain). After 20 years of service in the regiment he became its Oberst (colonel) in 1784. During the war with Ottoman Turkey, he led his troops {{in the first of}} several actions at Slatina-Timiş on 13 September 1788, where he captured a hill. The following year he fought at Mehadia. Werneck made his reputation on 30 September 1789 while leading the 1st Assault Column at the Siege of Belgrade. On this occasion his command included a battalion of <b>the</b> <b>Stain</b> Regiment, a battalion of grenadiers, and a company of volunteers. On 9 October after the siege was successfully concluded, Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor appointed him General-major.

25|$|So flawed is this Resolution {{that only}} its {{effective}} repeal by the General Assembly can provide {{any hope of}} expunging <b>the</b> <b>stain</b> on the U.N.’s escutcheon in the international system.

25|$|In {{the absence}} of {{successful}} treatment, hypertrophy (increased tissue mass) of the stains may cause problems later in life, such as loss of function (especially if <b>the</b> <b>stain</b> is near the eye or mouth), bleeding, and increasing disfigurement. Lesions {{on or near the}} eyelid can be associated with glaucoma. If the port-wine stain is on the face or other highly visible part of the body, its presence can also cause emotional and social problems for the affected person.|$|E
25|$|The {{colorimetric}} {{detection method}} depends on incubation {{of the western}} blot with a substrate that reacts with the reporter enzyme (such as peroxidase) that is bound to the secondary antibody. This converts the soluble dye into an insoluble form of a different color that precipitates next to the enzyme and thereby stains the membrane. Development of the blot is then stopped by washing away the soluble dye. Protein levels are evaluated through densitometry (how intense <b>the</b> <b>stain</b> is) or spectrophotometry.|$|E

25|$|Diagnosis {{is through}} direct {{observation}} of the ulcer {{with the use of}} fluorescein stain, which is taken up by exposed corneal stroma and appears green (see photos above and below). With descemetoceles, Descemet's membrane will bulge forward and after staining will appear as a dark circle with a green boundary, because it does not absorb <b>the</b> <b>stain.</b> Other tests that may be necessary include a Schirmer's test for keratoconjunctivitis sicca and an analysis of facial nerve function for facial nerve paralysis.|$|E
25|$|TEM {{samples of}} {{biological}} tissues need high atomic number stains to enhance contrast. <b>The</b> <b>stain</b> absorbs the beam electrons or scatters {{part of the}} electron beam which otherwise is projected onto the imaging system. Compounds of heavy metals such as osmium, lead, uranium or gold (in immunogold labelling) may be used prior to TEM observation to selectively deposit electron dense atoms in or on the sample in desired cellular or protein region. This process requires {{an understanding of how}} heavy metals bind to specific biological tissues and cellular structures.|$|E
25|$|When I {{first started}} doing <b>the</b> <b>stain</b> paintings, I left {{large areas of}} canvas unpainted, I think, because the canvas itself acted as forcefully and as {{positively}} as paint or line or color. In other words, the very ground {{was part of the}} medium, so that instead of thinking of it as background or negative space or an empty spot, that area did not need paint because it had paint next to it. The thing was to decide where to leave it and where to fill it and where to say this doesn't need another line or another pail of colors. It's saying it in space.|$|E

25|$|In 2016, {{the results}} of an eight-year review of the forgery were released, {{identifying}} Dawson's modus operandi. Multiple specimens demonstrated the same consistent preparation: application of <b>the</b> <b>stain,</b> packing of crevices with local gravel and fixation of teeth and gravel with dentist's putty. Analysis of shape and trace DNA showed that teeth from both sites belonged to the same orangutan. The consistent method and common source indicated the work of one person on all the specimens, and Dawson was the only one associated with Piltdown II. The authors did not {{rule out the possibility that}} someone else provided the false fossils to Dawson, but ruled out several other suspects, including Teilhard de Chardin and Doyle, based on the skill and knowledge demonstrated by the forgeries, which closely reflected ideas fashionable in biology at the time.|$|E

It also {{was one of the first}} stain pictures, one of the first large field pictures in which <b>the</b> <b>stain</b> technique was used, perhaps the first one. Louis and Noland saw the picture unrolled on the floor of her studio and went back to Washington, DC., and worked together for a while, working at the implications of this kind of painting.|$|E
