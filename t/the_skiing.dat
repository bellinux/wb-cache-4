5|$|Plans for an {{ice rink}} in Lillehammer {{started in the}} 1980s with the Lillehammer bid for the 1992 Winter Olympics. In 1985, Lillehammer Municipal Council {{accepted}} {{an agreement with the}} Norwegian Confederation of Sports (NIF), which offered to finance 50 percent of a new multi-use arena in Lillehammer. Combined with the construction of <b>the</b> <b>skiing</b> resort Hafjell, {{it was part of a}} plan to document the construction of new venues in and around Lillehammer to help the town secure the right to host the Olympics. The construction received NOK25 million in state grants. To promote the Olympic bid, the venue was given priority by NIF in their recommendation for use of public grants. In May 1987, the municipal council stated that they did not want to apply to host the B-Group of the 1989 World Ice Hockey Championships, because they feared the venue would not be completed by November 1987. NIF President Hans B. Skaset stated that this could jeopardize the entire Olympic bid if Lillehammer withdrew from arranging such a small event. The decision was changed a week later. The venue opened in December 1988 and cost NOK65 million.|$|E

5|$|Events under <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> Flying World Cup {{have several}} {{differences}} to <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> Flying World Championships.

These points contribute towards both Ski Flying and Ski Jumping World Cup standings; the former being effectively a 'mini season' within the latter. However, a feature shared with <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> Flying World Championships is that the starting order switches over from <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> Jumping World Cup standings to <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> Flying World Cup standings after the first competition of the latter, and remains that way for all subsequent events.|$|R

Boot-ski load and the contacting pressure distribution on the running surface satisfy force equilibrium and moment equilibrium. The deflection of <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> is related with the moment distribution and bending stiffness distribution of <b>the</b> <b>ski.</b> <b>The</b> pattern of the pressure distribution changed with the bending stiffness distribution of <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> on <b>the</b> same hardness of the snow in the measurement...|$|R
40|$|Recently, various {{goods for}} a ski have been {{developed}} and attached to <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> for improving a skiing characteristic.

However, {{the effect of the}} binding plate has not been proved theoretically. In the present paper, the authors have attempted to confirm the effect theoretically by simulating <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> turn.

25|$|While {{the events}} were the same, since the 1992 Games {{there was a}} rule change so that instead of jumping three times and taking the points for the best two, the {{competitors}} only jumped twice. In the individual normal hill/15 km, Japan's Kenji Ogiwara had only lost a single event in the season's World Cup, but came in sixth on the hill, which was won by Norway's Fred Børre Lundberg. He won the event after finishing eight-best in <b>the</b> <b>skiing,</b> ahead of Japan's Takanori Kono, Norway's Bjarte Engen Vik and Ogiwara in fourth. In the team normal hill/3 x 10 km, Japan finished first, third and fifth among the jumpers, giving them a 5:07 minute lead over Norway and finishing 4:49 minutes ahead.

25|$|Southwest of the Zugspitze, {{between the}} Zugspitzeck and Schneefernerkopf, is the Northern Schneeferner {{which has an}} eastern aspect. With an area of 30.7 {{hectares}} (2006) {{it is the largest}} German glacier. Around 1820 the entire Zugspitzplatt was glaciated, but of this Platt Glacier (Plattgletscher) only the Northern and Southern Schneeferner remain. The reason for the relatively constant area of the Northern Schneeferner in recent years, despite the lack of shade, is the favourable terrain that results in the glacier tending to grow or shrink in depth rather than area. In the recent past the glacier has also been artificially fed by the ski region operators, using piste tractors to heap large quantities of snow onto the glacier in order to extend <b>the</b> <b>skiing</b> season.|$|E
25|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>skiing</b> {{techniques}} used by this class {{is called the}} three track method, and was developed {{as part of the}} American Training System. For skiers with an amputation, one of the first skills learned using this technique is how to walk with the ski so the skier can learn how to flex the ankle, knee and hip. This allows the skier to determine their centre of gravity. The skier is then taught how hop turn in order to understand arm and leg coordination while on skis. This technique is only used while stationary and is not a competition skill. The skier next learns how to fall down and get back up again. The next skill learned is climbing gentle terrain, followed by learning to go down a straight run and learning to stop. After this, the skier learns how to get on and off a ski lift. This is followed by learning how to traverse the fall line, which teaches the skier how to maintain the ski edge. Other skills are then taught including the Uphill Christie, beginning turns, parallel turns, short swings and moguls.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{ability of}} <b>the</b> {{cross-country}} <b>skis</b> to glide freely is {{of very high}} importance for both sports and recreational skiing. Significant body {{of research and development}} is nowadays devoted to the materials and treatment methods for improving gliding of <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> running surfaces, as well as to <b>the</b> related <b>skiing</b> techniques for optimal use of ski gliding. One of the common concepts here is that the most significant energy loss contribution in such interaction is caused by the pure interfacial friction of <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> running surface and the snow. But this interaction is quite complex and we have proposed that other channels of the energy loss can be of significance. Among the possibilities one can point out to the effects of the snow deformation under <b>the</b> <b>skis,</b> “dragging” of snow by <b>the</b> <b>skis</b> and damping of <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> vibrations by <b>the</b> snow. Present paper reports on the field experimental studies of <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> interaction with <b>the</b> snow. These studies are aiming at developing the measurement technology allowing the assessment of gliding properties of <b>the</b> cross-country <b>skis</b> when data are collected from the sensors placed into <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> track...|$|R
50|$|The {{solution}} to the turning problem had already long been used in <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> industry, <b>the</b> used of spring steel edges. Normally these were thin strips held onto <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> using small screws, {{but this was not}} suitable for the laminated design. Head designed a version with a flange that extended sideways about 1/5 of the way into the base of <b>the</b> <b>ski.</b> <b>The</b> edges were laid up and bonded into the base as <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> was being glued together. The new version not only fixed the problem of soft edges, but was found to greatly improve the overall performance of <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> as well.|$|R
25|$|Odin must share half of {{his share}} of the dead with a {{powerful}} goddess; Freyja. She is beautiful, sensual, wears a feathered cloak, and practices seiðr. She rides to battle to choose among the slain, and brings her chosen to her afterlife field Fólkvangr. Freyja weeps for her missing husband Óðr, and seeks after him in far away lands. Freyja's brother, the god Freyr, is also frequently mentioned in surviving texts, and in his association with weather, royalty, human sexuality, and agriculture brings peace and pleasure to humanity. Deeply lovesick after catching sight of the beautiful jötunn Gerðr, Freyr seeks and wins her love, yet at the price of his future doom. Their father is the powerful god Njörðr. Njörðr is strongly associated with ships and seafaring, and so also wealth and prosperity. Freyja and Freyr's mother is Njörðr's sister (her name is unprovided in the source material). However, there is more information about his pairing with <b>the</b> <b>skiing</b> and hunting goddess Skaði. Their relationship is ill-fated, as Skaði cannot stand to be away from her beloved mountains, nor Njörðr from the seashore. Together, Freyja, Freyr, and Njörðr form a portion of gods known as the Vanir. While the Aesir and the Vanir retain distinct identification, they came together {{as the result of the}} Æsir–Vanir War.|$|E

5|$|Ski flying events {{outside of}} the World Championships are a regular feature on <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> Jumping World Cup calendar, usually {{occurring}} on two or three hills only.
