25|$|Though not {{appearing}} in Tekken 7s original arcade release, Nina returns in its updated title, Tekken 7: Fated Retribution. In the story mode, {{she was forced}} to work for the returning Heihachi in the first-half, until she began to concern about Lars' good reason on keeping Jin safe with him, deeming it very interesting to watch and resign from Zaibatsu, faking her death while setting her private assassination job for hire. She is later tasked with infiltrating a mafia wedding... posing as the bride. During the ceremony, a firefight broke out where Nina took out all her targets. However, the commotion had attracted the Tekken Force, who had been dispatched to suppress the violence, and they gave chase. With the Tekken Force in hot pursuit, Nina made her escape. That's when she bumped into a man she found vaguely familiar, who happens to be her son, Steve Fox. Steve wouldn't leave her alone. He seemed to have something he wanted <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>her...</b> Nina decided that a confrontation was her best chance of escape.|$|E
500|$|Josh Taylor of Jesus Freak Hideout said, [...] "the way {{in which}} [...] {{continually}} addresses Britney Spears just seems the least bit odd", but commented on how pleasant the song is. A review by Idolator noticed [...] "Britney" [...] has [...] "a melody that dares to be clear and pretty in ways emo bands [...] donâ€™t usually dare," [...] and commented how the song's [...] "strongly sung" [...] lyrics are [...] "sweet [...] not cynical at all." [...] The Denver Post reported that after the song's release, Spears' mother Lynne thanked Norman for writing the song, [...] "because {{it was all she}} wanted <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> daughter." [...] On the week of September 19, 2008, [...] "Britney" [...] peaked at number twenty-eight on Billboard Hot Christian Adult Contemporary chart.|$|E
500|$|In {{making the}} album Parablepsia, Kawada {{describes}} {{the concept of}} the album as [...] "E.M.R.", which stands for [...] "Electric. Mami Kawada. Rock". She considers [...] "Borderland" [...] to be most representative of her style, so she wanted to make an album which included songs which sounded similar to it. Originally, she only wanted a single song to convey the theme of the album, but for Parablepsia, several songs do. This includes the title song [...] "Parablepsia", which she describes as a song about not losing yourself in a society which moves around in circles, [...] "Fly Blind", which is a song about not always allowing yourself to be influenced by society, [...] "Eager Eyes", which is the song in the album which has the closest style to [...] "Borderland", [...] "It's no big deal", which takes inspiration from a phrase that her father used <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> and [...] "Dendritic Quartz", which is about flowers which constantly bloom and will never wither; [...] "Dendritic Quartz" [...] takes inspiration from a pendant she owns which has a pattern of trees.|$|E

2500|$|Phil has a {{panic button}} {{installed}} and Kathy helps the police trace Gavin via his mobile phone. Ben tells Gavin to leave or be arrested, {{as the police}} have arrived. Ben tells his family that Gavin has left, but Gavin returns, where Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell) apparently recognises him and appears fearful. On Halloween, Kathy is on edge, and she fears Gavin has gone into Ian's house. Ben and Kathy then see Gavin, but are unsure it was him. They go to Phil's house, where Gavin locks Phil and Dennis Rickman Jnr (Bleu Landau) in a bedroom. When Kathy attempts to call the police, Gavin appears. He threatens to light fireworks inside the house, hoping to kill himself, Kathy, Ben, Phil and Dennis. Sharon Mitchell (Letitia Dean), Phil's wife and Dennis's mother, arrives and Gavin reveals he knows that Sharon is the adopted daughter of Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) and Angie Watts (Anita Dobson). Gavin surprises Kathy by saying that Walford was once his home {{and he had a}} child. Sharon realises Gavin could be her birth father, and he confirms it when he says, [...] "Hello, princess", which Den used <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> Kathy pleads with Gavin not to light the fireworks and promises to leave with him again. Phil escapes, knocks Gavin unconscious and ties him up. While Sharon talks to Kathy, she realises that Margaret Midhurst (Jan Harvey), the solicitor who arranged her adoption and who she has been visiting to track her father, is Gavin's sister. When Gavin wakes up, Sharon asks about her adoption; Gavin says he had a fling with Carol Hanley (Sheila White), who had a breakdown after Sharon's birth, and Gavin was not paternal but Den was, so he traded Sharon for part in a bank raid that Den was working on. Phil then tells Sharon that Gavin previously had him locked in a room with no windows and just a bottle of whisky, meaning Phil turned to alcohol. Sharon decides to call the police so presses Phil's panic button. Sharon then confronts Gavin, who tells her that he asked Den to greet Sharon for him occasionally by calling her [...] "princess". When the police arrive, Gavin has gone. Sharon reveals she took money from Phil's safe to let Gavin go, and when she meets Margaret again, she confirms she helped Gavin fake his death and gives Sharon his phone number. Sharon calls and leaves a message, and later receives a text message, saying they will see each other soon.|$|E

6000|$|Pierston turned <b>to</b> Avice, wanting <b>to</b> <b>say</b> much <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> yet {{not knowing}} what <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> He lamely remarked at last: 'You go back the same way, Avice?' ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Bell drew {{up toward}} her and stood by her side in silence. She pitied her with all her heart, {{but she did not}} know what <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> comfort <b>her.</b>|$|R

6000|$|... "About Bell?" [...] said Mrs Dale, {{as though}} much {{surprised}} {{that he should have}} anything <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> respecting her eldest daughter.|$|E
60|$|Let us {{get back}} to my wife. She showed herself again after a long absence, having {{something}} (at last) <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> husband.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Hermione is there,' he said, {{in rather}} an uneasy voice. 'She is going away in two days. I suppose I ought <b>to</b> <b>say</b> good-bye <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> I shall {{never see her}} again.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{ought to}} have been {{specially}} careful on a Friday," [...] she used <b>to</b> <b>say</b> afterwards <b>to</b> <b>her</b> husband, while perhaps Nana {{was on the other side}} of her, holding her hand.|$|R
6000|$|Laurie saw and {{understood}} the affectionate anxiety which she hesitated to express, and looking straight into her eyes, said, {{just as he}} used <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it <b>to</b> <b>her</b> mother, [...] "It's all right, ma'am." ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Price {{gathered}} up her things slowly. Philip waited behind after the others <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> something consolatory. He {{could think of}} nothing but: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "She {{knows it}} now," [...] said Johnny; [...] "I went <b>to</b> <b>say</b> good-bye <b>to</b> <b>her</b> the other day, when I {{thought she was}} going to be married. I could not help telling her then." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, ma'am," [...] he {{answered}} tremulously, {{going to his}} door. Miss Vane had been obliged <b>to</b> instruct him <b>to</b> <b>say</b> ma'am <b>to</b> <b>her</b> niece, whom he had at first spoken of by her Christian name.|$|R
6000|$|... "I couldn't ask Emily {{about this}} letter. Now {{that they are}} married I {{have to make the}} best of it,--for her sake. I couldn't bring myself <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{anything}} <b>to</b> <b>her</b> which might seem to accuse him." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{what made}} it all so painful and {{distressing}} was that the more we met, the less did I seem able to find <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
6000|$|DAVID. No, by God! [But {{his love}} for MAGGIE {{steadies}} him. There is even a note of entreaty in his voice.] Have you nothing <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> man? ...|$|E

50|$|After he is reprimanded by Picard for his disobedience, La Forge {{concludes that}} his mother is in fact dead, {{and that it had}} all seemed so real he had thought he had a chance <b>to</b> <b>say</b> goodbye <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R

6000|$|He was, however, rather perplexed to {{know what}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> and {{therefore}} preferred {{waiting to see what}} turn she herself would give to the conversation. At length Feemy said, ...|$|E
