The Yekaterinburg Ring Road would surround the largest municipalities of Yekaterinburg and its purpose {{would be to}} help {{the economy of the}} <b>city</b> and reduce <b>traffic</b> on the Middle Ring Road of the city, making it easier for civilians to commute around the <b>city</b> than going <b>through</b> the <b>city's</b> <b>traffic</b> congestion. Eventually, the Ring Road would connect to other federal roads in order for easier access between other Russian cities. Construction of the road started in the same year. The projects were assigned to the Ministry of Transport and Communications since the projects were crucial to the city's economy. Officials hope the road projects will build environments more conducive to improving local quality of life and outside investments. Completing these major inter-regional roads will increase productive traffic by 1.5 to 2 times, improving the local economy with its ease of access to industries.|$|R
50|$|The {{passenger}} and {{freight traffic}} {{in and around}} the city has been increasing at a rapid pace due to {{increase in the number of}} industries, IT hubs and other socio-economic development. Vehicular traffic from highways such as Mumbai-Pune-Solapur highway pass <b>through</b> the <b>city,</b> causing <b>traffic</b> congestion. The purpose of the ring road is to divert the passing-by traffic from outside towards other cities, without letting them enter Pune. It will also provide connectivity to important areas of the city. It is predicted that nearly 10 lakh vehicles will use the ring road to enter, leave or pass <b>through</b> the twin <b>city.</b>|$|R

2500|$|The Beatles woke {{up early}} on 5 July in {{readiness}} for their flight to Delhi in India. After their requests for room service had gone unanswered, Evans {{went down to}} reception and found that all security protection inside the hotel had disappeared. The morning newspapers carried front-page stories condemning the Beatles for their failure to attend the engagement at Malacañang Palace. The tour party faced further intimidation initiated by Marcos loyalists. The Inland Revenue presented a tax bill on the band's concert earnings, which were still held by Ramos; this was despite a stipulation in NEMS' contract with Cavalcade that any such tax would be paid by the local promoter. All assistance from the hotel staff was withdrawn, as was any police escort <b>through</b> the <b>city</b> <b>traffic,</b> leaving Epstein to call ahead and plead with the pilot of their KLM flight to delay his takeoff.

When the National Highway passes <b>through</b> the <b>city,</b> the <b>traffic</b> hurried to pass over the railway gates {{in the city and}} outskirts, which makes taffic worse. To avoid the traffic congestion, the {{government}} of India constructed a mini bypass road connecting Eastern locks and Vatluru on both ends of the city. Even then, the traffic problem could not be resolved. The main bypass road which was constructed under Golden Quadrilateral programme which was completed in the late 1990s but then only 10,000 vehicles passed through the main bypass road but now it has almost doubled.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Recently, the {{synchronized}} flow {{traffic pattern}} {{has been found}} in empirical data of oversaturated <b>city</b> <b>traffic.</b> Traffic simulation models based on classical theories cannot reproduce synchronized flow. We present simulation results based on Kerner’s three-phase traffic theory. By using a version of the Kerner-Klenov stochastic microscopic traffic flow simulation model, we are able to reproduce all traffic patterns found in <b>city</b> <b>traffic,</b> including synchronized flow. The key role in understanding the emergence of synchronized flow within the model plays the driver’s speed adaptation effect.

40|$|In <b>city</b> <b>traffic</b> management, traffic {{breakdown}} is a {{very important}} issue, which is defined as a speed drop of a certain amount within a dense traffic situation. In order to predict <b>city</b> <b>traffic</b> flow breakdown accurately, in this paper, we propose a novel <b>city</b> <b>traffic</b> flow breakdown prediction algorithm based on fuzzy rough set. Firstly, we illustrate the <b>city</b> <b>traffic</b> flow breakdown problem, in which three definitions are given, that is, 1) Pre-breakdown flow rate, 2) Rate, density, and speed of the traffic flow breakdown, and 3) Duration of the traffic flow breakdown. Moreover, we define a hazard function to represent the probability of the breakdown ending at a given time point. Secondly, as there are many redundant and irrelevant attributes in city flow breakdown prediction, we propose an attribute reduction algorithm using the fuzzy rough set. Thirdly, we discuss how to predict the <b>city</b> <b>traffic</b> flow breakdown based on attribute reduction and SVM classifier. Finally, experiments are conducted by collecting data from I- 405 Freeway, which is located at Irvine, California. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to achieve lower average error rate of <b>city</b> <b>traffic</b> flow breakdown prediction...|$|R
