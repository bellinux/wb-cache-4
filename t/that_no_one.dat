5|$|According to Herodotus, the Persians {{numbered}} 300,000 {{and were}} accompanied by troops from Greek city states that supported the Persian cause (including Thebes). Herodotus admits <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> counted the latter, but he guesses that there were about 50,000 of them. Mardonius' troops consisted of not only Persians and Medes, but also Bactrians, Scythians, Indians, Boeotians, Locrians, Malians, Thessalians, Macedonians, Thracians, and 1,000 Phocians.|$|E
5|$|Alan Rushton adds <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> in the {{household}} of the newly married Duchess of Kent, including Conroy, {{is known to have}} had haemophilia, and that her probable awareness of the scandals surrounding the behaviour of Caroline of Brunswick and Caroline Matilda of Great Britain would have deterred her from seeking an affair elsewhere. Furthermore, Princess Victoria was said to have borne a strong family resemblance to her father and grandfather George III.|$|E

5|$|Although Parsons {{requested}} <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> protest his death, the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah {{planned to}} organize a candlelight vigil {{in opposition to the}} execution.

5|$|Because {{these three}} surface {{energies}} form {{the sides of}} a triangle, they are constrained by the triangle inequalities, γij < γjk + γik meaning <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> of the surface tensions can exceed {{the sum of the}} other two. If three fluids with surface energies that do not follow these inequalities are brought into contact, no equilibrium configuration consistent with Figure 3 will exist.|$|E
5|$|De Soto then {{determined}} {{to set out}} for Cofitachequi. The people of Ocute explained that the great wilderness separated them, and <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> alive had ever crossed it due to the war, despite what De Soto's guide had claimed. Nevertheless, the army departed on April 13. A party from Ocute initially joined the Spanish to raid Cofitachequi, but De Soto sent them home upon realizing there was no easy way through the wilderness.|$|E

50|$|Society’s {{first task}} is to place {{restraints}} on the exercise of mutual antagonism, so that mutual need can be satisfied. Such restraints moderate the struggle for comfort, power and glory, so that everyone can be protected from the worst outcomes for a person—grave indignity, harsh penury, enslavement, or violent death. How to control hostility between people {{is the problem of}} order. As soon as limits are placed on mutual antagonism, men encounter the problem of freedom: how to order society so <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one’s</b> liberty is arbitrarily preferred over another’s, so <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one’s</b> arbitrarily chosen means and ends of striving take unjustifiable precedence over another’s? Society tries to solve the problems of order and freedom by making and applying impersonal laws.|$|R
5|$|However, {{this seems}} unlikely, given <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> has ever {{documented}} that female euglossines produce pheromones; male euglossines produce pheromones using the chemicals they collect from orchids, and these pheromones attract females, {{rather than the}} converse, as Cullina (2004) suggests.|$|E
5|$|No One Lives Forever {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} upon its release, {{and has an}} 88.34% ranking on the aggregate site GameRankings (based on 28 reviews), and a score of 91 out of 100 on Metacritic (32 reviews).

5|$|The {{candidate}} that wins {{the election and}} assumes office is eventual President of South Korea Cho Myung-ho (Lee Jung-gil). His administration begins with his undertaking the grand task of forwarding talks of reunification between the North and South after witnessing the grim reality that is the struggle between the two nations. With strong ambitions, he leads diplomatic outreaches with the North <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> expected of a candidate so early in his term.|$|E

5|$|Vanbiesbrouck {{was born}} in Detroit, Michigan to a Belgian {{immigrant}} bricklayer, Robert Vanbiesbrouck, and an Italian immigrant Sara. He grew-up with two brothers; the oldest, Frank, {{who was also a}} goaltender in youth hockey. He inspired Vanbiesbrouck to play goaltender. John later noted that he learned more about goaltending just from watching Frank than any coaching could, adding <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> ever helped him more to become the player he was.|$|E
5|$|A major {{difference}} between And Then There Were None and Murder on the Orient Express that Sheldon pointed out {{was that in the}} former, the premise of the novel was <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> solved the murder. This forced Sheldon to desperately {{try to find a way}} to integrate clues into the story so that the player could actually discover the murderer, although the game remained quite uninteractive. In Murder on the Orient Express, the actual novel follows an investigation, so Sheldon could more easily integrate clues to lead to all three possible solutions. Sheldon also excised unnecessary puzzles from Murder on the Orient Express, as they were an unpopular feature of its predecessor.|$|E
5|$|After his death, MGM {{tried to}} {{continue}} with Romance of the Pink Panther and offered the role of Clouseau to Dudley Moore, who turned it down. The studio subsequently turned back to Blake Edwards, who was adamant not to recast the character, feeling certain <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> could adequately replace Sellers. In 1982 Edwards released Trail of the Pink Panther, which was composed entirely of deleted scenes from his past three Panther films. Frederick sued, claiming {{the use of the}} clips was a breach of contract; the court awarded her $1million ($ million today), plus 3.15 per cent of the film's profits and 1.36 per cent of its gross revenue.|$|E

5|$|Although his {{prestige}} {{was on the}} rise, Rosas made {{no serious}} attempts to further liberalise his regime. Every year he presented his resignation and the pliant House of Representatives predictably declined, claiming that maintaining him in office was vital for the nation's welfare. Rosas also allowed exiled Argentines {{to return to their}} homeland, but only because he was so confident of his control and <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> was willing to risk defying him. The execution in August 1848 of the pregnant young Camila O'Gorman, charged with a forbidden romance with a priest, caused a backlash throughout the continent. Nonetheless, it served as a clear warning that Rosas had no intention of loosening his grip.|$|E

Bart plays with it until it sprays water on an overloaded electrical socket, causing a fire that engulfs and melts the plastic Christmas tree and all of the presents beneath it. Bart hides the evidence outside beneath the snow in the front yard.|$|E
5|$|By mid-2011, Arafiles {{had moved}} his {{practice}} to East Texas and was affiliated with Cozby Germany Hospital in Grand Saline.

In November 2011, Arafiles entered a guilty plea on two counts of misuse of official information. Two other charges were dismissed and a pending indictment for aggravated perjury was dropped. Arafiles was forced to surrender his medical license, sentenced to 60 days in jail and five years of probation, and assessed a $5,000 fine.|$|E
