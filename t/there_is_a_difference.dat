The later ending also explores the narrator's own death, whereas the earlier version serves as a Christian consolation regarding death.|$|E

5|$|Hume {{notes that}} the skull of the Rodrigues {{starling}} {{was about the same}} size as that of the hoopoe starling, but the skeleton was smaller. Though the Rodrigues starling was clearly able to fly, its sternum was smaller compared to that of other starlings; however, it may not have required powerful flight, due to the small area and topography of Rodrigues. The two starlings differed mainly in details of the skull, jaws, and sternum. The maxilla of the Rodrigues starling was shorter, less curved, had a less slender tip, and had a stouter mandible. Not enough remains of the Rodrigues starling have been found to assess whether it was sexually dimorphic. Subfossils show a disparity in size between specimens, but {{this may be due to}} individual variation, as the differences are gradual, with no distinct size classes. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> in bill length and shape between two Rodrigues starling specimens, which could indicate dimorphism.|$|E

5|$|Standard cards can be {{purchased}} at vending machines within all Metrorail stations, at Metro sales offices, selected retail stores, and online. The purchase price includes $2 for the card itself plus an initial fare value, which varies depending on where they are purchased: cards purchased at stations cost $10 ($2 for the card and $8 fare value), while those purchased online cost either $10 or $30 ($2 for the card and $8 or $28 fare value). The cards can be reloaded using farecard vending machines or using cash at fareboxes onboard buses. Until 2016, riders could also add value to their SmarTrip cards by trading in paper farecards (a used farecard up to $20, or an unused farecard of any value). <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> between SmarTrip and CharmCard on the maximum value that can be stored on the card. SmarTrip can store up to $300 in value, while CharmCard can store up to $200.|$|E
5|$|The school vacated {{the entire}} 199293 season and every game it played from the 199596 season through the 199899 season. This {{included}} the 1997 National Invitation Tournament title and the 1998 Big Ten Tournament title. It also vacated its two Final Four games in 1992 and its entire NCAA tournament record in 1993, 1996 and 1998. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> between forfeiting {{a game and}} vacating a game; a vacated game does not result in the other school being credited with a win. This included virtually the entire career of Fisher's successor, Brian Ellerbe.

5|$|A careful {{examination}} of Facsimile No. 2 shows that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> between {{most of the}} hieroglyphic signs and the signs on the right third of the figure on the outer edge {{as well as the}} outer portions of the sections numbered 12–15. These signs are hieratic, not hieroglyphic, and are inverted, or upside down, {{to the rest of the}} text. In fact, they are a fairly accurate copy of lines 2, 3, and 4 of the Joseph Smith Papyrus XI, which contains a portion of the Book of Breathings. Especially clear is the word snsn, in section 14, and part of the name of the mother of the owner of the papyrus, (tay-)uby.t, repeated twice on the outer edge. An ink drawing of the hypocephalus in the Church Historian's office shows these same areas as being blank. It is likely that these portions were destroyed on the original hypocephalus and someone (the engraver, one of Joseph Smith's associates, or Joseph himself) copied the lines from the Book of Breathings papyrus for aesthetic purposes.|$|E

If one agrees with the thought experiment, we believe that Mary gains something after she leaves the room—that she acquires knowledge of a particular thing that she did not possess before. That knowledge, Jackson argues, is knowledge of the quale that corresponds to the experience of seeing red, and it must thus be conceded that qualia are real properties, since <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> between a person who has access to a particular quale and one who does not.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1990 This study {{investigated}} the practices public and academic library administrators find useful and utilize in analyzing use of collections. The study also investigated administrators' satisfaction with their collection use analysis practices, and the impact they perceived automation to have upon collection use analysis practices. A survey developed {{for this study was}} sent to two stratified random samples of 495 academic libraries and 605 public libraries in the United States. Eight hundred and eighty-eight usable responses were received. Chi-square analyses of six null hypotheses were made and data analyzed computing totals, percentages and rankings. All six null hypotheses were rejected in specific instances. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> differences in the collection analysis practices nonautomated and automated libraries in the sample used found useful. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> correlation between a library's satisfaction with its practices and its state of automation. In two of four instances <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> generalizable <b>difference</b> between the expectations of automated and nonautomated libraries regarding the utility of automated systems in gathering data for analyzing collection use. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> in the practices used by the sample of automated and nonautomated libraries to analyze collection use. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> in the collection analysis practices identified as useful by the sample of academic and public libraries. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> in the practices used by the sample of academic and public libraries to analyze collection use...|$|R
