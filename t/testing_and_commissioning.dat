5|$|Launch and Early Orbit Phase {{operations}} were {{completed in the}} morning of 11 April 2010, and SIRAL-2 was activated later the same day. At 14:40 UTC, the spacecraft returned its first scientific data. Initial data on ice thickness was presented by the mission's Lead Investigator, Duncan Wingham, at the 2010 Living Planet Symposium on 1 July. Later the same month, data was made available to scientists for the first time. The spacecraft underwent six months of on-orbit <b>testing</b> <b>and</b> <b>commissioning,</b> which concluded with a review on 22 October 2010 that found the spacecraft was operating as expected, and that it was ready to begin operations.|$|E
25|$|A {{vote on the}} Trident renewal {{programme}} {{was held}} in the House of Commons on 18 July 2016, and determined that the UK should proceed with construction of the next generation of submarines. The motion passed with a significant majority of 472 MPs voting in favour and 117 against. The MoD put the cost of building, <b>testing</b> <b>and</b> <b>commissioning</b> the replacement vessels at £31billion (plus a contingency fund of £10billion) over 35 years, or about 0.2percent of government spending, or 6percent of defence spending, every year. It is expected the new fleet of submarines will come into operation starting 2028 at the earliest and certainly by the 2030s. The Dreadnought class will extend the life of the Trident programme until at least the 2060s.|$|E

Other savings in the installation of the jackets could also be made.|$|R
