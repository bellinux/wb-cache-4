25|$|Thread forming and <b>thread</b> <b>rolling</b> are {{processes}} for forming screw threads, {{with the former}} referring to creating internal threads and the latter external threads. In both of these processes threads are formed into a blank by pressing a shaped tool, commonly called a 'thread rolling die' against the blank, in a process similar to knurling. These processes are used for large production runs because typical production rates are around one piece per second. Forming and rolling produce no swarf and less material is required because the blank size starts smaller than a blank required for cutting threads; there is typically a 15 to 20% material savings in the blank, by weight. A rolled thread can be easily recognized on fasteners that were formed from an unstopped blank because the thread has a larger diameter than the blank rod from which it has been made; however, necks and undercuts can be cut or rolled onto blanks with threads that are not rolled, and some fasteners are made from blanks with a reduced shank {{in the region to}} be rolled to maintain a constant major diameter from thread to unthreaded shank. Unless faced off, the end threads of a rolled fastener have a cupped end, as the surplus material in the tapering down final threads collapses uniformly over the end of the blank.|$|E
2500|$|All {{threading}} could feasibly be done using a single-point tool, {{but because}} of the high speed and thus low unit cost of other methods (e.g., tapping, die threading, and <b>thread</b> <b>rolling</b> and forming), single-point threading is usually only used when other factors of the manufacturing process happen to favor it (e.g., if only a few threads need to be made, if an unusual or unique thread is required, or if {{there is a need for}} very high concentricity with other part features machined during the same setup.) ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{are four}} main types of <b>thread</b> <b>rolling,</b> {{named after the}} {{configuration}} of the dies: flat dies, two-die cylindrical, three-die cylindrical, and planetary dies. The flat die system has two flat dies. The bottom one is held stationary and the other slides. The blank is placed {{on one end of the}} stationary die and then the moving die slides over the blank, which causes the blank to roll between the two dies forming the threads. Before the moving die reaches the end of its stroke the blank rolls off the stationary die in a finished form. The two-die cylindrical process is used to produce threads up to [...] in diameter and [...] in length. There are two types of three-die processes; the first has the three dies move radially out from the center to let the blank enter the dies and then closes and rotates to roll the threads. This type of process is commonly employed on turret lathes and screw machines. The second type takes the form of a self-opening die head. This type is more common than the former, but is limited by not being able form the last 1.5 to 2 threads against shoulders. Planetary dies are used to mass-produce threads up to [...] in diameter.|$|E

In this paper how thread helix angle affects axial metal flow was analyzed from the perspective of rolling force and the forming process of thread shaft was simulated with different helix angles by the deform- 3 D software. Through the measurement of the point coordinates, the effect of the helix angle on the axial metal flow of rolled pieces was analyzed. Finally, the conclusion was obtained that helix angle causes the asymmetry of axial metal flow with small difference values for asymmetry and the axial metal flow of rolled pieces increases as the helix angle increases. The <b>rolling</b> <b>thread</b> segment can be ensured in the middle of rolled pieces by moving the blank a suitable distance in the reverse direction of the axial flow direction...|$|R

50|$|The {{order of}} {{installation}} of a typical headset follows. The steerer tube is cut to the appropriate length by the bicycle fork manufacturer and the top 1-2 inch cm of the steerer is <b>threaded</b> using a <b>rolling</b> process. This process assures that no material is lost and the steerer would not be weakened as with a die or lathe cutting. Threaded forks necessitate that the threads on the steerer only use the top 1-2 inches, therefore the forks are sold in varying lengths. If {{there is a need}} to use a fork that is too long, meaning the fork steerer is not threaded down far enough, a bicycle mechanic can use a die to extend the threads. This is not recommended if the threads need to be cut farther than an inch or so. As a side note, one should never try to thread an unthreaded steerer after manufacturing as this will weaken the steerer tube. The threads are normally of the ISO standard, 1 in by 24 tpi, but other standards exist. The headtube may be faced and then the cups are pressed into the headtube using a special press that ensures they are square and true. The fork crown may be faced and then the crown race is pressed on to the fork crown with a special press that also makes sure that it is square and true. Then the bearings are placed on top of the crown race, after which the steerer tube is inserted into the headtube. The upper bearings are placed in the upper cup, and the upper race is screwed onto the steerer. A washer, frequently a keyed washer, is placed on top of the upper race and a locknut is screwed on top of that.|$|R

40|$|The {{requirements}} for the manufacturers of steel have been increased in many respects in recent years. The harsh competition between the manufacturers requires a continuous reduction of the production costs and a successive improvement of product quality. The work presented herein {{is a part of}} efforts towards maximizing rolling mill throughput and minimizing processing costs and crop losses by computational intelligence based process modeling and optimisation in tandem cold rolling. It {{is the first time that}} the computational intelligence based optimisation has been applied to the rolling schedules of tandem cold rolling mills as is shown in this thesis. Rolling schedule is essential for a tandem cold strip mill operation. This involves the determination of inter-stand gauges, tensions and rolling speeds at individual stands. As the rolling process is examined and shown to be a nonlinear programming problem incorporated the complex interactions of multiple rolling parameters such as reductions, roll force and torque, rolling speeds and tensions. Each of the parameters can be set to a value in its admissible data range of float type, which is determined by <b>threading</b> conditions. The <b>rolling</b> schedule is a set of such rolling parameters. Therefore, different combinations of these rolling parameters generate numerous rolling schedules. Although some empirical rolling schedules may be reasonably satisfactory, however, it is hard to declare which schedule is the best solution. In this study, an intelligent searching mechanism is introduced to optimize the rolling schedule by assessing rolling constraints and the combined cost function of tension, shape and power distribution. The optimisation results have been compared with current rolling practices based on empirical models. It is shown that the proposed model can significantly reduce the power distribution cost, maximize the safe level of strip tension, and obtain good strip shape. The proposed model is generic for complex engineering problem optimisation, and is capable for Multiple-Objective Problem Solving (MOPS). A hybrid model of Influence Coefficient Method and Spring-Beam Method is proposed and verified for strip shape analysis and prediction. From the point of view of product quality, shape is an important parameter in the rolling process. Bad shape is a frequent cause for threading delay, rejection or rectification by costly means. Particularly for cold strip, the thinner the strip, the greater is the difficulty in maintaining good shape, which requires the optimum relationship of roll force, strip tension, work roll crowns and/or bending force. A physically based shape predictive model has been established, on the basis of which, a heuristic optimisation approach is employed to search for the optimum setting of the bending forces for those mill stands with bending systems, and to optimize reduction schedule for those without roll bending system. The proposed model has also been extended to optimize shape problem during threading by using optimal roll ground crown or optimum roll bending force. A comparison is made between results predicted by the proposed model and test results obtained on a production mill. The control of head and tail off-gauge is becoming increasingly important for many companies in the steel industry so as to maximize yield from their rolling operations. there are various kinds of fluctuations in unsteady states such as threading, acceleration, deceleration, and tailing out processes, and these fluctuations always accompany non-linearity and hysteresis, it is very difficult to accurately model, and then optimize and/or control these processes. Therefore, dynamic simulation and analysis of mill performance during these transient rolling phases, is vital in order to ensure that thickness is controlled within the desired tolerance. The significant advantage to be gained from the simulation is that the logic errors potentially existing in a rolling mill operation could be corrected and the mill performance could be improved. Innovative models for the unsteady rolling process simulation have been presented. The threading and acceleration processes have been dynamically simulated. The results generated from the simulation have been compared with the measurements of the strip produced from a production mill. The interactive relationships between roll force, exit thickness and inter-stand tensions are presented for both threading and acceleration processes. The speed dependent rolling parameters for acceleration process are analyzed and taken into account in the simulation. Deceleration and tailing-out processes are also addressed, as they are similar to acceleration and threading processes, respectively. The proposed model has also been examined with respect to changes in initial conditions such as friction between work rolls and strip, strip properties and work roll profile. The proposed models and simulations have been implemented and verified with plant data. The numerical simulations together with their result analysis will be beneficial to fine-tune the rolling process parameters and are effective in achieving significant cost savings and product quality improvements...|$|R
40|$|Prediction {{as a tool}} in {{engineering}} {{has been used in}} taking right judgement in many of the professional activities. This being the fact, the role and significance of prediction in geotechnical practice needs no emphasis. Bulk of all man made structures are either made of soil or are resting on natural soil, involving large quantities of soil. Thus, it is often necessary for the geotechnical engineer to quickly characterize the soil and determine their engineering properties, so as to assess the suitability of the soil for any specific purpose. Obtaining these properties requires undisturbed samples, which involves time and money, and also elaborate laboratory procedures. Thus, it is desirable to find simpler and quicker methods of testing, using the data of which the engineering properties can be predicted satisfactorily especially so, for preliminary design purposes. Most often this can be achieved from simple tests known as inferential tests, and the engineering properties namely, compressibility, swell/collapse, hydraulic conductivity, strength and compaction characteristics can be obtained from empirical/semi-empirical correlations. The index tests namely the Atterberg limits form the most important inferential soil tests with very wide universal acceptance. These tests are relatively simple to perform and have provided a basis for explaining most engineering properties of soils in geotechnical practice. In this direction, this investigation has been carried out to correlate the engineering properties with the simple index properties and their indices, namely, the liquid limit, plastic limit, shrinkage limit, plasticity index and shrinkage index (liquid limit - shrinkage limit). Any good correlation in the prediction of engineering properties with the index properties will enhance the use of simple test for prediction purposes. This thesis is an attempt towards this direction. It is often necessary to identify the basic mechanisms controlling the engineering properties from a micro-mechanistic point of view and correlate with the index properties, thereby facilitating prediction of engineering properties better. Though attempts {{have been made in the}} past to predict the engineering properties of soils from the index properties/indic­es, they are not quite satisfactory. This thesis is an attempt to predict the engineering properties of fine-grained soils from the index properties taking into consideration the mechanisms controlling them. Since, the index properties are used for prediction of engineering properties, the existing methods of determining the same have been examined carefully and critically. It's satisfactory determination is found important because other indices namely plasticity index, Ip and shrinkage index, Is = (wL - ws), are determined based on it. Also the liquid limit is one of the important and widely used parameter in various existing correlations. In this direction, two new methods of determining the liquid limit have been developed, namely (i) absorption water content and liquid limit of soils and (ii) liquid limit from equilibrium water content under Ko-stress. In the absorption water content method, the water absorbed by an oven dried soil pat at equilibrium gives a good correlation with the liquid limit of soils. Here, the water holding capacity at equilibrium goes well with the mechanism of liquid limit, which is also the water holding capacity of a soil at a particular small but measurable shear strength. A good relationship is found to exit between the absorption water content, wA and the liquid limit, wL, and it is given as : WA = 0. 92 wL	(i) In the second method, namely, the liquid limit from equilibrium water content under K 0 -stress, which is the equilibrium water content under a Ko stress of 0. 9 kPa is found to be equal to the liquid limit obtained from the cone penetration method of determining the liquid limit It is found that this method of determining the liquid limit overcomes the limitations of the conventional methods of determining the liquid limit, also easy to determine with a simple apparatus and has good repeatability. Determination of plastic limit of the soils by the <b>rolling</b> <b>thread</b> method often poses a problem especially when the soil is less plastic. Hence, to overcome this problem, a new method has been proposed to predict the plasticity index in terms of the flow index. The relationship between the plasticity index and the flow index by the cone penetration cup method is found to be better than by the percussion cup method. Since, the cone penetration method of the liquid limit determination is more popular than the percussion cup method, the flow index from the cone method is recommended to determine the plasticity index from the correlation as given below: (/p) c = 0. 74 Ifc	(ii) Thus, the plastic limit can be determined with the plasticity index, thereby dispensing with the determination of plastic limit by the thread method. The determination of consolidation characteristics form an important aspect in the design of foundations and other earth retaining structures. The determination of consolidation characteristics namely the compression index, the coefficient of consolidation and the coefficient of secondary compression is time consuming. So, researchers have resorted to correlating the compressibility behaviour with simple index properties. While attempts have been made in the past to correlate the compressibility behaviour with various index properties individually, all the important properties affecting the compressibility behaviour has not been considered together in any single study to examine which of the index property/properties of the soils correlates better with the compressibility behaviour, especially with the same set of test results. Number of existing correlations with the liquid limit alone as a primary index property correlating with the compression index have limitations in that they do not consider the plasticity characteristics of the soils fully. The index parameter, shrinkage index, Is has a better correlation with the compression index, Cc and also the coefficient of volume change, mv than plasticity index. Coefficient of consolidation, Cv has also shown to correlate well with shrinkage index than the plasticity index. Even the coefficient of secondary compression, Cαε has shown to have a better correlation with shrinkage index than the plasticity index. However, liquid limit has a poor correlation with all the compressibility characteristics. The correlation of Cc and Cv with shrinkage index, Is is as given below: Cc = 0. 007 (Is + 18) 	(iii) Cv = 3 x 10 - 2 (Is) - 3. 54 (in m 2 /sec) Further, to reduce the testing time of conventional consolidation test in order to obtain the compressibility characteristics, a new method known as rapid method of consolidation has been proposed, which is very effective in enormously reducing the time of consolidation without sacrificing the accuracy of the end results. The time required in the rapid method of consolidation testing could be as low as 4 to 5 hours to complete the whole test as compared to 1 to 2 weeks as the case may be by the conventional consolidation test. Using any curve fitting procedure the degree of consolidation, U for any pressure increment can be found out. Thus, the effective pressure at that stage can be calculated and further the pressure incremented without further delay. This procedure is repeated for every pressure increment with a load increment ratio of unity till the desired pressure level is reached. Even for a highly compressible soil like BC soil with a liquid limit of 73. 5 %, the consolidation test could be completed within 5 hours by the rapid method, without any sacrifice of the accuracy of the results as compared to 7 days by the conventional method to reach a pressure of 800 kPa. Hydraulic conductivity is one of the basic engineering properties of soils. Of late hydraulic conductivity of fine-grained soils has assumed greater importance in waste disposal facilities. From the present investigation it is found that hydraulic conductivity with water for each pair of soils having nearly the same liquid limit but different plasticity properties is found to be vastly different, but found to correlate well with shrinkage index. A method to predict the hydraulic conductivity of fine -grained soils as a function of void ratio is proposed with the use of shrinkage index as given below: k = C [	] (in m/sec) 	(v) 1 + e C = 2. 5 x 10 - 4 (/s) - 5. 89 and n = 4 	(vi) It has also been brought out that as the dielectric constant of the pore fluid decreases; there is a drastic increase in the intrinsic permeability of soil. These changes are attributed to the significant reduction in the thickness of diffuse double layer, which in turn is mainly dependent on the dielectric constant of the pore fluid. The quantification of the change in the hydraulic conductivity with the change in the pore fluids of extreme dielectric constant, i. e., from water to carbon tetrachloride could be expressed in terms of the volume of water held in the diffuse double layer and the same has a good correlation with shrinkage index. With the advancement in the knowledge of the engineering behaviour of fine-grained soils, there is an increasing trend toward larger involvement of fine-grained soils in earth structures and foundations. Though extensive work has been done in the past to understand the swelling behaviour of expansive soils and the mechanisms involved therein, it is yet not satisfactory. From the literature it can be seen that lot of work has been done to correlate the swell potential with various physical properties. The simple means of identifying the swelling type of soils is by means of free swell tests with the ratio of free swell with carbon tetrachloride to the free swell of water. The same has found to correlate well with the percent swell/collapse of the ten soils used in the present investigation. However, it was found that shrinkage index has a better correlation with the swell/collapse behaviour of fine-grained soils, compared to the liquid limit or the plasticity index. In this study, it is also shown that neither the liquid limit nor the plasticity index can qualitatively describe the swell/collapse behaviour of fine-grained soils. This has been attributed primarily to two different mechanisms governing montmorillonitic and kaolinitic soils separately. Even swelling pressure has shown to have a good correlation with shrinkage index. It is found that the compression index of the samples consolidated from the swollen condition correlates well with the shrinkage index. Laboratory determination of the compaction characteristics are very much important for use in earth work constructions. It is found that only the plastic limit bears a good correlation with the compaction characteristics namely optimum moisture content and maximum dry unit weight. This conclusion is also supported by the data from the literature. The correlations are given as: OMC = 0. 92 wp (in percent) 	(viii) and ydmax = 0. 23 (93. 3 - wp) (inkN/m 3) 	(ix) Liquid limit, plasticity index and shrinkage index do not bear any correlation with the compaction characteristics. It is quite possible that, the plastic limit, which is the optimum water content of a saturated soil at which it behaves as a plastic material, and thus can be moulded to any shape, thereby the soil can be compacted or moulded to the densest possible state at that water content. Hence, possibly the good correlation. A simple method to predict the compaction curve is proposed based on the plastic limit of the soils. Of all the important engineering properties, both volume change (compressibility and swelling) and hydraulic conductivity have good correlation with the shrinkage index. However, the compaction characteristics correlate well with the plastic limit. Herein, an hypothesis is proposed to possibly explain why shrinkage index has shown to be a better parameter to correlate with most of the engineering properties with the exception of the compaction characteristics. The liquid limit is a parameter which takes part of the plasticity characteristics of a soil. Recently it has been well brought out that shrinkage limit is primarily a function of how the varying grain sizes are distributed in a soil. Thus, shrinkage limit takes care of the gradation of the soil fractions in it. Thus, by considering the shrinkage index, which is the difference of the liquid limit water content on one end and shrinkage limit water content on the other end, the primary physical properties of the soils namely the plasticity and the grain size distribution are considered. This possibly explains the good correlation of shrinkage index with the engineering properties of fine-grained soils. However, compaction being a moulding of the soils into a compact state, it has a good correlation with the plastic limit, which is the optimum water content of a saturated soil at which it behaves as a plastic material, and thus can be moulded to any shape, thereby the soil can be compacted or moulded to the densest possible state at that water content. Hence, the good correlation. As the present investigation gives the correlative equations to predict the engineering properties of fine-grained soils from the appropriate index properties, which are obtained from simple and quick laboratory tests, it is hoped that this will go a long way in being a handy tool for a practicing geotechnical engineer in the preliminary assessment of fine-grained soils and thereby take appropriate judgement in various aspects of geotechnical constructions with it...|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} steps in {{manufacturing}} a screw: heading, <b>thread</b> <b>rolling,</b> and coating. Screws are normally made from wire, which is supplied in large coils, or round bar stock for larger screws. The wire or rod is then {{cut to the}} proper length {{for the type of}} screw being made; this workpiece is known as a blank. It is then cold headed, which is a cold working process. Heading produces the head of the screw. The shape of the die in the machine dictates what features are pressed into the screw head; for example a flat head screw uses a flat die. For more complicated shapes two heading processes are required to get all of the features into the screw head. This production method is used because heading has a very high production rate, and produces virtually no waste material. Slotted head screws require an extra step to cut the slot in the head; this is done on a slotting machine.

The blank is placed {{on one end of the}} stationary die and then the moving die slides over the blank, which causes the blank to roll between the two dies forming the threads. Before the moving die reaches the end of its stroke the blank rolls off the stationary die in a finished form. The two-die cylindrical process is used to produce threads up to 6 in in diameter and 20 in in length. There are two types of three-die processes; the first has the three dies move radially out from the center to let the blank enter the dies and then closes and rotates to roll the threads. This type of process is commonly employed on turret lathes and screw machines. The second type takes the form of a self-opening die head. This type is more common than the former, but is limited by not being able form the last 1.5 to 2 threads against shoulders. Planetary dies are used to mass-produce threads up to 1 in in diameter.|$|E
50|$|Thread forming and <b>thread</b> <b>rolling</b> are {{processes}} for forming screw threads, {{with the former}} referring to creating internal threads and the latter external threads. In both of these processes threads are formed into a blank by pressing a shaped tool, commonly called a 'thread rolling die' against the blank, in a process similar to knurling. These processes are used for large production runs because typical production rates are around one piece per second. Forming and rolling produce no swarf and less material is required because the blank size starts smaller than a blank required for cutting threads; there is typically a 15 to 20% material savings in the blank, by weight. A rolled thread can be easily recognized on fasteners that were formed from an unstopped blank because the thread has a larger diameter than the blank rod from which it has been made; however, necks and undercuts can be cut or rolled onto blanks with threads that are not rolled, and some fasteners are made from blanks with a reduced shank {{in the region to}} be rolled to maintain a constant major diameter from thread to unthreaded shank. Unless faced off, the end threads of a rolled fastener have a cupped end, as the surplus material in the tapering down final threads collapses uniformly over the end of the blank..|$|E
50|$|The rods {{were cut}} into 22-foot lengths {{as they leave}} the last stand {{by means of a}} flying shear. The Savannah rods were air cooled to room {{temperature}} on the cooling bed and then were cold straightened in a Medart Straightener. Rods to be beta heat treated by-pass the cooling bed and were lifted into the beta heat treating furnace by means of a hoist, to be held at 1,320-1,365 °F for 11-20 minutes and then quenched in cold water. After quenching, these rods were conveyed to the Medart straightener for straightening. The rods were located in -inch Acme-Gridley automatic screw machines where slugs were cut from the rods. The Hanford slugs were then placed in the Heald machine, which cuts the slugs to desired lengths and finishes and radiuses the ends. The Savannah River slugs were reduced to exact dimensions of size, surface, and straightness on a centerless grinder after which a contour was placed on the surface by a <b>thread</b> <b>rolling</b> machine. The slugs were numbered and put on a basket on a conveyor that passes through a degreasing tank, pickling tank, two rinse tanks and a hot air dryer before depositing the slug basket in the Inspection Department. The slugs were inspected for seams, striations, dimensions and handling defects with the good slugs being packed for shipment.|$|E
5000|$|Progressive {{stamping}} {{can also}} be produced on transfer presses. These are presses that transfer the components from one station to the next {{with the use of}} mechanical [...] "fingers". For mass production of stamped parts which do require complicated in-press operations, it is always advisable to use a progressive press. One of the advantages of this type of press is the production cycle time. Depending upon the part, productions can easily run well over 800 parts/minute. One of the disadvantages of this type of press {{is that it is not}} suitable for high precision deep drawing which is when the depth of the stamping exceeds the diameter of the part. When necessary, this process is performed upon a transfer press, which run at slower speeds, and rely on the mechanical fingers to hold the component in place during the entire forming cycle. In the case of the progressive press, only part of the forming cycle can be guided by spring-loaded sleeves or similar, which result in concentricity and ovality issues and non uniform material thickness. Other disadvantages of progressive presses compared to transfer presses are: increased raw material input required to transfer parts, tools are much more expensive because they are made in blocks with very little independent regulation per station; impossibility to perform processes in the press that require the part leave the strip (example beading, necking, flange curling, <b>thread</b> <b>rolling,</b> rotary stamping etc.).|$|E
