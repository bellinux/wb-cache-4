5|$|In Half-Life 2, {{the player}} {{takes on the}} role of Dr. Gordon Freeman. Throughout the game, the player follows the story of a dark, dystopian future in which mankind has been enslaved by <b>the</b> <b>Combine,</b> a mysterious alien enemy. In contrast, Concerned follows the same general path through the story {{established}} by Half-Life 2, but instead follows the adventures of Gordon Frohman, a hapless, lethally clumsy oaf who arrives in City 17 a few weeks before Freeman. Frohman is incredibly na√Øve and, unlike the other citizens, seems to enjoy living under the rule of the totalitarian administrator, Dr. Breen, and <b>the</b> <b>Combine.</b> He holds an insane reverence for the latter, even going to the point of having a plush doll of a Combine soldier.|$|E
5|$|Little is {{revealed}} of the Combine's role outside of Earth, but dialogue in Half-Life 2 states that they control worlds in different dimensions and inhabited by {{a range of}} species. <b>The</b> <b>Combine</b> occupation of Earth, however, is {{shown to be a}} brutal police state. In City 17, an Eastern European city, Civil Protection units are seen frequently, often conducting random searches of apartment blocks, interrogating human citizens and engaging in random police brutality. The military Overwatch forces of <b>the</b> <b>Combine</b> are shown attacking human resistance bases in an effort to further solidify their control. The citizens themselves are all clad in blue uniforms and live in designated apartment blocks. Citizens are shown to be moved around to different cities or locales at the Combine's will, using passenger trains. Vortigaunts, alien creatures from the original Half-Life, are also shown to have been enslaved, and are observed in various jobs such as janitors.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Combine</b> are {{frequently}} shown as harsh rulers over {{the citizens of}} Earth, suppressing dissent with brutality, policing using violence and using invasive surgery to transform humans into either soldiers or slaves.

The atmosphere generated by the dystopian Combine state has been praised by reviewers, although the artificial intelligence of the transhuman Combine characters was thought to be inferior to that of other characters in Half-Life 2.

5|$|As {{with its}} predecessors, {{the game is}} played in the first person as series protagonist Gordon Freeman against transhuman troops, known as <b>the</b> <b>Combine,</b> and other hostile alien creatures.

5|$|At {{the heart}} of the Combine's command {{structure}} in Half-Life 2 is the Citadel, an enormous structure of Combine construction, reaching approximately 2.6 kilometres (1.6 miles) into the sky from ground level, and delving deep underground. Located within City 17, the Citadel serves as the primary headquarters of <b>the</b> <b>Combine,</b> housing both Combine Advisors and the office of the Earth administrator, Wallace Breen. Breen is frequently seen on large screens around the city from which he spreads propaganda. The Citadel projects an energy field that is able to prevent human reproduction, as well as a field that keeps dangerous alien wildlife out of the city. In addition, the Citadel contains a trans-dimensional teleporter which allows <b>the</b> <b>Combine</b> to travel between their native universe and Earth. The Citadel also contains construction facilities for various synthetic Combine combat machines.|$|E
5|$|Half-Life 2 {{picks up}} the story, in which the G-Man takes Freeman out of stasis and inserts him on a train en route to City 17 an {{indeterminate}} number of years after {{the events of the}} first game, with Earth now enslaved by the transhuman forces of <b>the</b> <b>Combine.</b> The player guides Gordon to aid in humanity's struggle against <b>the</b> <b>Combine</b> and its human representative, Dr. Wallace Breen. He oversees the occupation from his base of operations in the Citadel, a monolithic building at the heart of City17. Fighting alongside Gordon is an underground resistance led by former colleague Dr. Eli Vance, as well other allies including Dr. Vance's daughter Alyx Vance and the enigmatic Vortigaunts, an alien species. Half-Life 2 ends with a climactic battle atop the Citadel that inflicts critical damage to its dark fusion reactor. When it seems as if Alyx and Gordon are to be engulfed by the explosion, the G-Man appears once more. After giving a cryptic speech, he extracts Gordon from danger and places him in stasis once again.|$|E
30|$|Cushion {{plants are}} {{important}} facilitator species in alpine ecosystems.

For leaf elongation, only <b>the</b> <b>combined</b> warming and nutrient manipulation had a significant positive effect. Temperature, nutrient, and <b>the</b> <b>combined</b> treatment initially increased cover of S. acaulis, but by the seventh year of manipulations, <b>the</b> <b>combined</b> warming and nutrient treatment {{had a very strong}} and significant negative effect on cover.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Combine</b> use a large {{array of}} science fiction technology. They have access to {{teleportation}} technology, which takes them from their dimension to Earth. However, their teleporter technology is restrictive in comparison to that developed by Eli Vance, Isaac Kleiner and Judith Mossman in that it cannot be used to teleport to other locations on Earth without significant modification. Throughout the games, various futuristic computer consoles, doors, power sources and weapon emplacements are encountered. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>Combine</b> employ the use of small airborne robots, scanners, to observe the citizens of Earth. The city variant merely moves about the streets, monitors individuals, and takes photographs, while the combat equivalent is capable of dropping mines into an area. Civil Protection makes use of smaller airborne robots called manhacks, which fly using razor-sharp rotating blades with which they attack their targets to cause laceration injuries. These are often deployed in closed-in areas. <b>The</b> <b>Combine</b> also use two types of land mines; hopper mines throw themselves {{into the air and}} detonate when an enemy is detected nearby, while the spherical rollermines roll towards vehicles or other enemies, attach themselves and deliver damaging electrical attacks. Combine technology is also used to transform humans into Overwatch soldiers or stalkers, deformed and mutilated humans with no memory of their past selves who act as slaves and maintenance workers in Combine facilities. Transformation into a Stalker is considered among the Combine's worst punishments for dissidents.|$|E
5|$|The Combine's first {{appearance}} is in Half-Life 2. Through {{the early stages}} of the game, Combine Civil Protection units pursue Gordon Freeman through City 17 after he accidentally reveals his presence to Wallace Breen. Due to Freeman's actions in Half-Life, Breen sees Freeman as a major threat. As Freeman escapes the city, Civil Protection units raid the resistance base of Black Mesa East and capture resistance leader Eli Vance, who is transferred to holding facilities at Nova Prospekt. Freeman and Vance's daughter Alyx break into the facility to rescue him, but Eli Vance is teleported to <b>the</b> <b>Combine</b> Citadel by double agent Judith Mossman. However, the strike against Nova Prospekt is seen as the start of a revolution by the citizens of Earth, who take up arms against <b>the</b> <b>Combine.</b> In response, Combine Overwatch are deployed to City 17, and heavy street fighting takes place. Freeman manages to infiltrate the Citadel but is captured and taken to Breen. Mossman allows Freeman to break free of his captivity, and Breen flees to the Citadel's trans-dimensional teleporter, intent on escape. However, Freeman destroys the teleporter's reactor before Breen can escape, causing a large explosion that destroys the top of the Citadel.|$|E
