On being washed of the adhering soil, holes of 12 inches [...] wide by 25 inches deep were found cut in them at an angle, to all [...] appearance for the insertion of struts {{for the support of}} an upper [...] structure. On the outside, 14 inches down on either side, holes of 2 [...] inches diameter were found intersecting the central hole, apparently [...] for the insertion of a wooden key or <b>trenail</b> to retain the struts. [...] These were found at intervals, and were held in position by stones and [...] smaller jammers.' ...|$|E
60|$|The Smeaton, {{not having}} been made fast to the buoy, had, with the ebb-tide, drifted to leeward a {{considerable}} way eastward of the rock, and could not, till {{the return of}} the flood-tide, be worked up to her moorings, so that the present tide was lost, notwithstanding all exertions which had been made both ashore and afloat with this cargo. The artificers landed at six a.m.; but, as no materials could be got upon the rock this morning, they were employed in boring <b>trenail</b> holes and in various other operations, and after four hours' work they returned on board the tender. When the Smeaton got up to her moorings, the landing-master's crew immediately began to unload her. There being too much wind for towing the praams in the usual way, they were warped to the rock in the most laborious manner by their windlasses, with successive grapplings and hawsers laid out for this purpose. At six p.m. the artificers landed, and continued at work till half-past ten, when the remaining seventeen stones were laid which completed the third entire course, or fourth of the lighthouse, with which the building operations were closed for the season.|$|E

5000|$|Studying {{the hull}} {{called for the}} most {{spectacular}} measures. In order to examine the keel and take samples from it, {{it was necessary to}} dig a tunnel under the hull and to use underwater chain-saws.

5000|$|A treenail, also <b>trenail,</b> trennel, or trunnel, is {{a wooden}} peg, pin, or dowel used to fasten {{pieces of wood}} together, {{especially}} in timber frames, covered bridges, wooden shipbuilding and boat building. Many such buildings and bridges are still in use. [...] Locust is a favorite wood when making trunnels in shipbuilding due to its strength and rot resistance and red oak is typical in buildings.|$|E
5000|$|Ancient {{shipbuilding}} used treenails to {{bind the}} boat together. They {{had the advantage}} of not giving rise to [...] "nail-sickness", a term for decay accelerated and concentrated around metal fasteners. Increased water content causes wood to expand, so that treenails gripped the planks tighter as they absorbed water. Similar wooden <b>trenail</b> fastenings were used as alternatives to metal spikes to secure railroad rail-support [...] "chairs" [...] to wooden sleepers (ties) in early Victorian times.|$|E
60|$|It did {{not rise}} slowly, as does an {{ordinary}} building.

5000|$|The viaduct is 1,048 feet (319m) {{long and}} 76 feet (23m) high with 7 {{segmental}} arches each of 120 feet (36.5m) span. When originally built the viaducts {{were made of}} laminated timber construction on the Wiebeking system supported on tall stone pillars and cost £25,000. Each arch was made from 14 layers of 22" [...] x 3-1/2" [...] timbers held together by <b>trenails</b> and built by Messrs. Robson. A paper on the viaducts's design won Benjamin Green a silver Telford Medal from the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1841.|$|R
50|$|In {{constructing}} the line deep valleys at the Ouse Burn and Willington Dene {{had to be}} crossed. Laminated timber arch superstructures on stone piers were used, a configuration known after its creator as the Wiebeking system. They were desiged by John and Benjamin Green. The Ouseburn Viaduct consisted of five spans of 116 feet and 32 ft 6in rise. The Willington Viaduct had seven spans of up to 128 feet span. The timber arches consisted of 14 layers of timber, each 22 inches by 3 1/2 inches, held by <b>trenails.</b> Both structures were replaced by iron viaducts in 1869.|$|R
60|$|The {{wind was}} southerly to-day, {{but there was}} much less sea than yesterday, and the landing-master's crew were enabled to {{discharge}} and land twenty-three pieces of stone and other articles for the work. The artificers had completed the laying of the twenty-seventh or first course of the staircase this morning, and in the evening they finished the boring, <b>trenailing,</b> wedging, and grouting it with mortar. At twelve o'clock noon the beacon-house bell was rung, and all hands were collected {{on the top of}} the building, where prayers were read for the first time on the lighthouse, which forcibly struck every one, and had, upon the whole, a very impressive effect.|$|R
50|$|It is {{reasonable}} to assume that galleys in both Western Scotland and the West of Ireland were built in accordance with well-established shipwrights' techniques of north-west Europe, of which the Norse were major exponents. There was extensive Norse settlement both on the west coast of Scotland and around the coasts of Ireland. Norse shipwrights attached both the stem and stern to the keel with scarfed joints, the hull itself being clinker-built with iron nails. Ribs were attached to the strakes with cords or <b>trenails,</b> and thwarts installed. The mast was then inserted in the mast step. The stem and stern posts would have notches to receive the ends of planks, and knees secured the thwarts.|$|R
5000|$|The escapees {{arrived back}} in Hobart in March 1837 and {{were put on}} trial for piracy - a hanging offence. This caused a {{considerable}} public spectacle in the settlement, and the court was packed for the trial. James Porter and William Shires argued that as the Frederick {{had not yet been}} officially launched, it was impossible for them to have committed piracy: [...] "It was canvas, rope, boarding and <b>trenails,</b> put together shipwise - yet it was not a legal ship; the seizure might have been theft, but not piracy." [...] The situation was further complicated by the Frederick having been taken in a harbour rather than on the high seas, a requisite for piracy.|$|R
6000|$|We {{have said}} that {{everything}} in the lighthouse was substantial and very strong. All the woodwork was oak, the floors and walls of solid stone,--hence, when Dove, who had no nerves or physical feelings, proceeded with his cooking, the noise he caused was tremendous. A man used to woman's gentle ways would, on seeing him poke the fire, have expected that the poker would certainly penetrate not only the coals, but {{the back of the}} grate also, and perchance make its appearance at the outside of the building itself, through stones, joggles, dovetails, <b>trenails,</b> pozzolano mortar, and all the strong materials that have withstood the fury of winds and waves for the last half-century! ...|$|R
60|$|This {{course or}} layer {{consisted}} of 123 blocks of stone, {{those in the}} interior being sandstone, while the outer casing was of granite. Each stone was fastened to its neighbour above, below, and around by means of dovetails, joggles, oaken <b>trenails,</b> and mortar. Each course was thus built from its centre to its circumference, and as all the courses from the foundation to a height of thirty feet were built in this way, the tower, up to that height, became a mass of solid stone, as strong and immovable as the Bell Rock itself. Above this, or thirty feet from the foundation, the entrance-door was placed, and the hollow part of the tower began.|$|R
50|$|The dock {{entrance}} {{was on the}} River Hull {{just south}} of North Bridge, and the dock itself built west-south-west along {{the path of the}} North Wall as far as the Beverley Gate. The dock walls were of local brick, with Bramley Fall stone coping piece. Cement for the lock wall's front construction was rendered waterproof through the use of pozzolana imported from Italy. Piling for the walls consisted of piles narrowing from 12 by 9 in to 3 in at the bottom supporting sleepers 12 by 6 in wide by deep <b>trenailed</b> to the piles. The alluvium excavated during the dock construction was deposited mostly on land to the north, raising the ground by 5 ft—the land was later sold for building upon.|$|R
50|$|Timber {{sleepers}} were {{expensive and}} not durable, and the railways’ engineers had strong - and conflicting - {{views about the}} best wood species and the best preservative treatments. The railways moved towards standardisation on a softwood sleeper preserved by pressure injection of creosote, measuring 8 ft 6in (2 591 mm) long by 10in (254mm) by 5in (127mm). Chairs were secured to the sleepers by <b>trenails</b> (steel spikes driven through a timber sleeve) or three chair-screws on first class routes. The GWR alone among the main line railways kept to its own standard, the 00 rail at 97½ lb/yd (48.365 kg per metre), and with two fangbolts securing each chair to the sleeper, {{with the head of}} the bolt under the sleeper and a nut above the chair—more secure but much more difficult to adjust.|$|R
6000|$|There is {{a common}} fallacy in naval matters founded on poetical license, {{to the effect that}} the mariner is {{separated}} from death by a single plank; whereas, the unpoetical truth is, that the separation consists of many hundreds of planks, and a solid bulwark of timbers more than a foot thick, besides an inner [...] "skin," [...] the whole being held together by innumerable iron and oaken bolts and <b>trenails,</b> and tightened with oakum and pitch. We had almost fallen into this error--or poetical laxity of expression--by saying that, on the night of which we write, little did Miss Tippet know that she was separated from, not death exactly, but from something very awful, by a single plank; at least, by the floor of her own residence, and the ceiling of the house below--as the sequel will show.|$|R
60|$|The lighthouse, thus happily completed, rose to {{a height}} of seventy feet, and {{consisted}} of forty-six courses of masonry. The internal arrangements will be understood at once by reference to our engraving, which exhibits {{a section of the}} tower. There was first the solid part, 35 feet in height and 16 feet 8 inches in diameter at the top, the base being much wider. Then came the still very solid portion with the entrance-door and the spiral staircase. Above that, the first store-room, which had no windows. Next, the second store-room, with two windows. Next the kitchen, followed by the bed-room, both of which had four windows; and, last, the lantern. The rooms were 12 feet 4 inches in diameter, with walls 2 feet 2 inches thick, and the whole fabric, from top to bottom, was so dovetailed, <b>trenailed,</b> cemented, inter-connected, and bound together, that it formed and still continues, a unique and immoveable mass of masonry.|$|R
60|$|Besides laying, boring, <b>trenailing,</b> wedging, and {{grouting}} thirty-two stones, {{several other}} operations were proceeded {{with on the}} rock at low-water, {{when some of the}} artificers were employed at the railways and at high-water at the beacon-house. The seamen having prepared a quantity of tarpaulin or cloth laid over with successive coats of hot tar, the joiners had just completed the covering of the roof with it. This sort of covering was lighter and more easily managed than sheet-lead in such a situation. As a further defence against the weather the whole exterior of this temporary residence was painted with three coats of white-lead paint. Between the timber framing of the habitable part of the beacon the interstices were to be stuffed with moss as a light substance that would resist dampness and check sifting winds; the whole interior was then to be lined with green baize cloth, so that both without and within the cabins were to have a very comfortable appearance.|$|R
6000|$|Upon inquiry it {{appeared}} {{that three of the}} stones last laid upon the building had been partially lifted from their beds by the force of the sea, and were now held only by the <b>trenails,</b> and that the cast-iron sheer-crane had again been thrown down and completely broken. With regard to the beacon, the sea at high-water had lifted part of the mortar gallery or lowest floor, and washed away all the lime-casks and other movable articles from it; but the principal parts of this fabric had sustained no damage. On pressing Messrs. Logan and Watt on the situation of things {{in the course of the}} night, Mr. Logan emphatically said; [...] "That the beacon had an ill-faured[15] twist when the sea broke upon it at high-water, but that they were not very apprehensive of danger." [...] On inquiring as to how they spent the night, {{it appeared}} that they had made shift to keep a small fire burning, and by means of some old sails defended themselves pretty well from the sea sprays.|$|R
6000|$|According to {{directions}} {{they ran}} down, and jumped on board [...] "with a will." [...] Smeaton {{took his place}} in the stern. They pushed off with a will; sailed and pulled out the fourteen miles with a will; jumped on the rock, landed the heavy stones, went immediately into action, cleaned the bed, and laid the first stone of the great work--all under the same vigorous impulse of the will. This was at eight in the morning. By the evening tide, the first [...] "course," [...] which formed but a small segment of a circle, was fitted with the utmost despatch, bedded in mortar and <b>trenailed</b> down. Next day the second course was partly landed on the rock; the men still working with a will, for moments out there were more precious than hours or days in ordinary building,--but before they got the whole course landed, old Ocean also began to work with a will, and eventually proved himself stronger than his adversaries, by driving them, in a terrific storm, from the Rock! ...|$|R

50|$|In {{some ways}} the birlinn paralleled the more robust ocean-going craft of Norse design. Viking ships were double-ended, with a keel scarfed to stems fore and aft. A shell of thin {{planking}} (strake) was constructed {{on the basis of}} the keel, the planks being edge-joined and clenched with iron nails. Symmetrical ribs or frames were then lashed to the strakes or secured with <b>trenails.</b> Over most of the ribs was laid a slender crossbeam and a thwart. The mast was stepped amidships or nearly so, and oars, including a steering oar, were also used. The stem and stern post sometimes had carefully carved notches for plank ends, with knees securing the thwarts to the strakes and beams joining the heads of the frames. The hull bore a general resemblance to the Norse pattern, but stem and stern may have been more steeply pitched (though allowance must be paid for distortion in representation). Surviving images show a rudder. Nineteenth-century boat-building practices in the Highlands are likely to have applied also to the birlinn: examples are the use of dried moss, steeped in tar, for caulking, and the use of stocks in construction.|$|R
6000|$|This morning, at a quarter-past eight, the artificers were landed as usual, and, {{after three}} hours and three-quarters' work, five stones were laid, {{the greater part of}} this tide having been taken up in {{completing}} the boring and <b>trenailing</b> of the stones formerly laid. At noon the writer, with the seamen and artificers, proceeded to the tender, leaving on the beacon the joiners, and several of those who were troubled with sea-sickness--among whom was Mr. Logan, who remained with Mr. Watt--counting altogether eleven persons. During the first and middle parts of these twenty-four hours the wind was from the east, blowing what the seamen term [...] "fresh breezes"; but in the afternoon it shifted to E.N.E., accompanied with so heavy a swell of sea that the Smeaton and tender struck their topmasts, launched in their bolt-sprits, and [...] "made all snug" [...] for a gale. At four p.m. the Smeaton was obliged to slip her moorings, and passed the tender, drifting before the wind, with only the foresail set. In passing, Mr. Pool hailed that he must run for the Firth of Forth to prevent the vessel from [...] "riding under." ...|$|R
60|$|The wind being now N.W., {{the sea was}} {{considerably}} run down, and this morning at five o'clock the landing-master's crew, thirteen in number, left the tender; and having now no detention with the landing of artificers, they proceeded to unmoor the Hedderwick praam-boat, and towed her alongside of the Smeaton: {{and in the course}} of the day twenty-three blocks of stone, three casks of pozzolano, three of sand, three of lime, and one of Roman cement, together with three bundles of <b>trenails</b> and three of wedges, were all landed on the rock and raised to the top of the building by means of the tackle suspended from the cross-beam on the middle of the bridge. The stones were then moved along the bridge on the waggon to the building within reach of the balance-crane, with which they were laid in their respective places on the building. The masons immediately thereafter proceeded to bore the trenail-holes into the course below, and otherwise to complete the one in hand. When the first stone was to be suspended by the balance-crane, the bell on the beacon was rung, and all the artificers and seamen were collected on the building. Three hearty cheers were given while it was lowered into its place, and the steward served round a glass of rum, when success was drunk to the further progress of the building.|$|R
50|$|The ship's {{dimensions}} {{have now}} been estimated at around 116 ft in length and around 27 ft in width. The vessel was clinker built with each plank overlapping the one below, the lower plank always being {{on the inside of}} the one above. The planks of the outer hull were positioned first and, on the Newport Ship, are secured to each other with iron nails driven through the overlap from the outside and then fitted with iron rove plates. The end of each nail was then hammered flat against the rove to produce a tight seal. Gaps along the overlap were secured by caulking with tar and animal hair. Hair from horse, cow, sheep and goat has all been identified in the Newport ship. The frames (ribs) of the ship were then fitted inside the hull and secured to the planks. Each framing piece was secured to the keel (spine) of the ship by having its keel cutout placed over the keel and held by precision of fit. Nails and <b>trenails</b> have not been used in this ship to secure frames to keel. The keel is made of beech, but the rest of the ship is made of oak, although no reason for this has yet been suggested. One possible explanation is a simple shortage of oak compared with beech at the time of construction. Almost all woodworking on the ship has been done using axes and adzes, with saw marks found on only a few timbers.|$|R
60|$|At eight a.m. the artificers and sailors, forty-five in number, {{landed on}} the rock, and after four hours' work seven stones were laid. The {{remainder}} of this tide, from the threatening appearance of the weather, was occupied in <b>trenailing</b> and making all things as secure as possible. At twelve noon the rock and building were again overflowed, when the masons and seamen went on board of the tender, but Mr. Watt, with his squad of ten men, remained on the beacon throughout the day. As it blew fresh from the N.W. in the evening, it was found impracticable either to land the building artificers or to take the artificers off the beacon, and they were accordingly left there all night, but in circumstances very {{different from those of}} the 1st of this month. The house, being now in a more complete state, was provided with bedding, and they spent the night pretty well, though they complained of having been much disturbed at the time of high-water by the shaking and tremulous motion of their house and by the plashing noise of the sea upon the mortar gallery. Here James Glen's versatile powers were again at work in cheering up those who seemed to be alarmed, and in securing everything as far as possible. On this occasion he had only to recall to the recollections of some of them the former night which they had spent on the beacon, the wind and sea being then much higher, and their habitation in a far less comfortable state.|$|R
50|$|As {{the planks}} reached the desired height, the {{interior}} frame (futtocks) and cross beams were added. Frames were placed close together, {{which is an}} enduring feature of thin planked ships, still used today on some lightweight wooden racing craft such as those designed by Bruce Farr. Viking boat builders used a spacing of about 850 mm. Part {{of the reason for}} this spacing was to achieve the correct distance between rowing stations and to create space for the chests used by Norse sailors as thwarts (seats). The bottom futtocks next to the keel were made from natural L-shaped crooks. The upper futtocks were usually not attached to the lower futtocks to allow some hull twist. The parts were held together with iron rivets, hammered in from the outside of the hull and fastened from the inside with a rove (washers). The surplus rivet was then cut off. A ship normally used about 700 kg of iron nails in a 18 m long ship. In some ships the gap between the lower uneven futtock and the lapstrake planks was filled with a spacer block about 200 mm long. In later ships spruce stringers were fastened lengthwise to the futtocks roughly parallel to the keel. Longships had about five rivets for each yard (90 cm) of plank. In many early ships treenails (<b>trenails,</b> trunnels) were used to fasten large timbers. First, a hole about 20 mm wide hole was drilled through two adjoining timbers, a wooden pegs inserted which was split and a thin wedge inserted to expand the peg. Some treenails have been found with traces of linseed oil suggesting that treenails were soaked before the pegs were inserted. When dried the oil would act as a semi-waterproof weak filler/glue.|$|R
60|$|Smeaton was, indeed, {{the patron}} saint of the Bell Rock. Undeterred by the {{sinister}} fate of Winstanley, he had tackled and solved the problem of the Eddystone; but his solution had not been in all respects perfect. It remained for my grand-father to outdo him in daring, by applying to a tidal rock those principles which had been already justified by the success of the Eddystone, and to perfect the model by more than one exemplary departure. Smeaton had adopted in his floors the principle of the arch; each therefore exercised an outward thrust upon the walls, which must be met and combated by embedded chains. My grandfather’s flooring-stones, on the other hand, were flat, made part of the outer wall, and were keyed and dovetailed into a central stone, so as to bind the work together and be positive elements of strength. In 1703 Winstanley still thought it possible to erect his strange pagoda, with its open gallery, its florid scrolls and candlesticks: like a rich man’s folly for an ornamental water in a park. Smeaton followed; then Stevenson in his turn corrected such flaws as were left in Smeaton’s design; and with his improvements, it is not too much to say the model was made perfect. Smeaton and Stevenson had between them evolved and finished the sea-tower. No subsequent builder has departed in anything essential from the principles of their design. It remains, and it seems to us as though it must remain for ever, an ideal attained. Every stone in the building, it may interest the reader to know, my grandfather had himself cut out in the model; {{and the manner in which}} the courses were fitted, joggled, <b>trenailed,</b> wedged, and the bond broken, is intricate as a puzzle and beautiful by ingenuity.|$|R
