25|$|During the 2004 Presidential {{campaign}}, Drudge {{ran a story}} quoting General Wesley Clark, {{in which}} Clark claimed that the John Kerry campaign would implode over an intern affair. Drudge reported that other news outlets were investigating the alleged affair, but removed it from the site shortly afterwards when <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>news</b> outlets dropped their investigations.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{suppose you}} heard <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>news</b> that arrived in town to-day, m'm?' she said again. 'Lord Mountclere {{is going to}} be married to-morrow.' ...|$|E
50|$|She {{has written}} for The Huffington Post, <b>the</b> Guardian, and <b>other</b> <b>news</b> outlets.|$|R
50|$|As a Fox {{affiliate}} and as {{an independent}} station, KTGF broadcast short news updates anchored by Karen Wolf; <b>the</b> only <b>other</b> <b>news</b> programming on <b>the</b> station was the syndicated CBN NewsWatch.|$|R
60|$|Excusing {{himself from}} Nelly and {{following}} Uncle Chris into the passage-way outside the box, he heard <b>the</b> <b>other's</b> <b>news</b> listlessly. It {{came as no}} shock to Freddie. He had never thought Mr. Pilkington anything to write home about, and had never supposed that Jill would accept him. He said as much. Sorry for the chap in a way, and all that, but had never imagined for an instant that he would click.|$|R
6000|$|With <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>news</b> that Halleck's {{mother gave}} {{him on his}} return, she told him of the chance that had brought his old college comrade to them again, and of how Bartley was now married, and was just settled in the little house she had helped his wife to find. [...] "He has married a very pretty girl," [...] she said.|$|E
60|$|Mary, {{whom they}} had never liked, was to be {{mistress}} of Fairclose, and was to gain all the advantages that they had expected but had never obtained. The thought was not pleasant, but it was speedily forgotten in the excitement of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>news.</b> Her mother, however, seeing the pleasure that her husband unmistakably felt {{at the thought of}} the marriage, was genuinely pleased. Not only might the connection be useful to the girls, but it might be invaluable in covering their retirement from Fairclose. There might be something more about that than her husband had said. At any rate this would silence all tongues {{and put an end to}} the vague anxiety that she had long felt. She had always liked Cuthbert, and had long ago cherished a faint hope that he might some day take to Mary.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, I do. I credit {{you with}} numbers of them. Now draw that chair {{up to the}} window--it is not comfortable, {{but it is the}} best of them--and let us talk. Now, in the first place you don't know how sorry, how dreadfully sorry I have been about what has {{happened}} at home. I was shocked, indeed, at the news of the sudden death of your dear father. He was always so kind when he came to see us, and I liked him so much, I felt for you deeply. It must have been an awful shock for you. I heard it a few days after I got to Dresden. Then came <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>news</b> about that terrible failure and its consequences. It seemed too shocking altogether that you should have lost the dear old place, but I do think I was most shocked of all when I heard that my father had bought it. Somehow it {{did not seem to be}} right. Of course it must have been, but it did not seem so to me. Did it to you, Cuthbert?" [...] and she looked at him wistfully.|$|E
60|$|They could {{scarcely}} have spoken a hundred words before their colloquy {{was at an}} end. The new-comer returned to his carriage and M. de Cartienne followed his example. I {{looked at him as}} he stepped in, anxious to see what effect <b>the</b> <b>other's</b> <b>news</b> had had upon him. Apparently it was not so bad as he had feared, for, although he still looked anxious and pale, his face had lost its ghastly hue.|$|R
5000|$|Teddy - Teddy {{is a young}} orphan who is friends' with Orson and Olivia. From {{the whole}} group, Teddy is the only who can read and write, and is usually the one who tells <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> around town. He works as a {{newspaper}} boy.|$|R
5000|$|Sun News Network - Like <b>other</b> {{national}} <b>news</b> channels, it {{was subject}} to the same mandatory distribution order as <b>the</b> <b>other</b> national <b>news</b> channels (inclusion in [...] "the best available discretionary package consistent with their genre and programming") from March 2014 until the channel's shutdown on February 13, 2015.|$|R

60|$|<b>The</b> only <b>other</b> <b>news</b> {{here you}} know as well as I; to wit, that the country is going to be ruined, and that the Church is going to be ruined, and that both have become so used to being ruined, that they will go on {{perfectly}} well.|$|R
25|$|The {{city has}} one daily newspaper: the Echo, {{published}} by the Trinity Mirror group. The Liverpool Daily Post was also published until 2013. The UK's first online only weekly newspaper called Southport Reporter (Southport and Mersey Reporter), {{is also one of}} <b>the</b> many <b>other</b> <b>news</b> outlets that covers the city.|$|R
50|$|Newsbeat is the {{flagship}} news programme on BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 1Xtra. Newsbeat {{is produced by}} BBC News but differs from <b>the</b> BBC's <b>other</b> <b>news</b> programmes in its remit to provide news tailored for a specifically younger audience. It is primarily hosted by Chris Smith and Tina Daheley.|$|R
5000|$|Control Room - a 2004 {{documentary}} film about Al Jazeera and {{its relations with}} the US Central Command (CENTCOM), as well as <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>news</b> organizations that covered the 2003 invasion of Iraq.|$|E
5000|$|Michael Keaton as Robert Wiener, a CNN {{producer}} who braves Iraq {{and refuses to}} flee when all <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>news</b> broadcasters have fled Iraq. He is resourceful in his dealings with Iraqi bureaucracy.|$|E
50|$|In 2011 TVR {{operated}} a rebranding {{of the channel}} and a significant programme change. Then it had a more dynamic programme, with news every hour and debates in between, competing <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>news</b> channels, Antena 3 and Realitatea.|$|E
50|$|The {{documentary}} uses many media {{headlines from}} the day, including {{media coverage of}} <b>the</b> election and <b>other</b> <b>news</b> stories, such as Ross Perot's presidential exit and re-entrance, among other topics.|$|R
50|$|Since 2007, he {{has been}} the {{managing}} partner of McAllister Olivarius. In addition to his legal practice, he comments regularly on politics and diplomacy for <b>the</b> BBC and <b>other</b> <b>news</b> organisations.|$|R
5000|$|Antena 3 has {{constant}} {{rivalry with}} <b>the</b> <b>other</b> major Romanian <b>news</b> station, Realitatea TV, owned by Elan Schwartzenberg.|$|R
50|$|The Pennsylvania bureau, called PolitickerPA.com, {{was cited}} as a source by <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>news</b> media, {{including}} the Philadelphia Daily News, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, the Pittsburgh City Paper, The Beaver County Times, The Citizens Voice, and the Lancaster New Era.|$|E
50|$|Control Room is a 2004 {{documentary}} film about Al Jazeera and {{its relations with}} the US Central Command (CENTCOM), as well as <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>news</b> organizations that covered the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

50|$|It was {{announced}} in May 2011 that Frei would be switching from the BBC to Channel 4 later in the year. Frei would serve as the broadcaster's Washington correspondent for Channel 4 News, as well as reporting for <b>the</b> channel's <b>other</b> <b>news</b> programmes. He has since returned often from Washington {{and has become a}} semi-regular presenter on Channel 4's evening news slot.|$|R
50|$|Potential positives {{stem from}} this practice, too. The {{individual}} journalist who releases a story has widespread influence, and the story, in turn, receives widespread attention. In the United States, {{when a reporter}} breaks an important story to <b>the</b> media, <b>other</b> <b>news</b> organizations {{pick it up and}} spread it further. This ultimately keeps stories alive, and leads to a story's impact on viewers.|$|R
5000|$|Freelance {{journalists and}} photographers accept cash to write about, or take photos of, events {{with the promise}} of {{attempting}} to get their work on <b>the</b> AP or <b>other</b> <b>news</b> outlets, from which they also will be paid. Is that ethical? ...|$|R
50|$|Following the {{takeover}} {{less than a}} month, Richard Gray was named head of news for the A-Channel stations and CKX-TV (another station in the CHUM acquisition). Gray reports directly to the CTVgm corporate group instead of CTV News to preserve independent news presentation and management. Gray now oversees CKVR and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>news</b> departments; CHRO, CFPL, CKNX, CHWI, CIVI and CKX-TV.|$|E
5000|$|The app {{has been}} said to have a unique minimalistic user experience. Kit Eaton of New York Times commented that Random [...] "let's you browse the news in a {{different}} way to all <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>news</b> sites you've probably ever used." [...] Mashable reviewed Random by concluding that the [...] "app {{may be one of the}} most simple content-discovery apps on the market." ...|$|E
50|$|Rai News 24 is Italy's first {{non-stop}} {{news and}} information channel, broadcast on digital terrestrial television in Italy and via satellite around Europe and North America. It is also the only Italian news channel to broadcast live 24/7 (similar to the fact that, every day, between 1am and 6am, when all <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>news</b> channels in Itália just play continuous replay loop, RaiNews24 is still LIVE to bring viewers late-breaking news).|$|E
50|$|The Agency is {{planning}} <b>the</b> introduction of <b>other</b> <b>news</b> services and multimedia services, after implementation {{of its new}} organisational chart which will allow an increase of its editorial staff and working hours.

50|$|AllThingsD {{reported}} on March 28, 2013 that, according to sources, Twitter co-founder Biz Stone {{was close to}} launching a native mobile app called Jelly. On April 1, 2013, Biz Stone wrote the company's first blog post, giving only very vague information about the product. A TechCrunch writer inferred that the product would be targeted at do-gooders on <b>the</b> go. <b>Other</b> <b>news</b> publications also published speculation about the app.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, {{there is}} a nexus of a money-lender, land-lord, a local MLA and a police inspector, who have {{an eye on the}} land owned by Laxmi's husband. The goons attack him and in the incident, he loses his arm. On <b>the</b> <b>other</b> hand, <b>news</b> comes that Shiva has been killed in action at the Indo-Pak border.|$|R
