Two amateur radio call signs, U1MIR and U2MIR, were assigned to Mir in the late 1980s, allowing amateur radio operators on Earth to communicate with the cosmonauts. The station was also equipped with a supply of books and films for the crew to read and watch.|$|E
5|$|Sheriff Behan, testifying for the prosecution, {{said the}} Cowboys had not resisted, but had thrown {{up their hands}} and turned out their coats <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>they</b> were not armed. He said that Tom McLaury threw open his coat {{to show that he}} was not armed and that the first two shots were fired by the Earp party. Sheriff Behan insisted Doc Holliday had fired first using a {{nickel-plated}} revolver, although other witnesses reported seeing him carrying a messenger shotgun immediately beforehand.|$|E
5|$|The Elementary Education Act 1880 {{insisted on}} {{compulsory}} attendance from 5–10 years. For poorer families, ensuring their children attended school proved difficult, {{as it was}} more tempting to send them working if the opportunity to earn an extra income was available. Attendance Officers often visited the homes of children who failed to attend school, which often proved to be ineffective. Children {{under the age of}} 13 who were employed were required to have a certificate <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>they</b> had reached the educational standard; employers of these children who weren't able to show this were penalised. An act brought into force thirteen years later went under the name of the Elementary Education (School Attendance) Act 1893, which stated a raised minimum leaving age to 11. Later the same year, the act was also extended for blind and deaf children, who previously had no means of an official education. This act was later amended in 1899 to raise the school leaving age up to 12 years of age.|$|E

500|$|Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan testified on {{the third}} day of the hearing. During two days on the stand, he gave strong {{testimony}} that the Cowboys had not resisted but either threw up their hands and turned out their coats <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>they</b> were not armed. Behan's views turned public opinion against the Earps, who were free on bail. He and other prosecution witnesses testified that Tom McLaury was unarmed, that Billy Clanton had his hands in the air, and that neither of the McLaurys were troublemakers. They portrayed Ike Clanton and Tom McLaury as being unjustly bullied and beaten by the vengeful Earps {{on the day of the}} gunfight. On the strength of the prosecution case, Spicer revoked the bail for Doc and Wyatt Earp and had them jailed on November 7. [...] They spent the next 16 days in jail.|$|E

500|$|During {{his short}} life, Ramanujan {{independently}} compiled nearly 3,900 results (mostly identities and equations). Many were completely novel; [...] his original and highly unconventional results, {{such as the}} Ramanujan prime, the Ramanujan theta function, partition formulae, and mock theta functions, have opened entire new areas of work and inspired {{a vast amount of}} further research. Nearly all his claims have now been proven correct. The Ramanujan Journal, a peer-reviewed scientific journal, was established to publish work in all areas of mathematics influenced by Ramanujan, and his notebooks - containing summaries of his published and unpublished results - have been analyzed and studied for decades since his death as a source of new mathematical ideas. As late as 2011 and again in 2012, researchers continued to discover that mere comments in his writings about [...] "simple properties" [...] and [...] "similar outputs" [...] for certain findings were themselves profound and subtle number theory results that remained unsuspected until nearly a century after his death and which relied on work published in 2006. He became one of the youngest Fellows of the Royal Society and only the second Indian member, and the first Indian to be elected a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. Of his original letters, Hardy stated that a 'single look' was enough <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>they</b> could only have been written by a mathematician of the highest calibre, comparing Ramanujan to other mathematical geniuses such as Euler and Jacobi.|$|E

Arsenic was also rubbed into the faces and arms of women to [...] "improve their complexion".

2500|$|A running gag {{throughout}} {{the series is}} the fastidious labelling of all items in Dymo tape, such as hairdryers, magnets, a bottle of maths, or a jar of nuts (which contained both types of nut: the foodstuff and fastener). Another recurring joke {{is the use of}} fictional apparatus and materials used in the experiments—items such as the [...] "Besselheim plate" [...] pokes fun at real lab equipment, often named after their designers (e.g. Petri dish, Erlenmeyer flask). Pencils are always used to point at key elements of the experiments, as the 'scientists' do not speak: this is sometimes taken to ridiculous levels—pointing out pencils using a pencil; pointing at chocolates and then at a person <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>they</b> are a gift. [...] Also, the series repeatedly instructs viewers to keep a notebook, described as a [...] "copy book," [...] and to inscribe random and essentially worthless details of the lessons taking place with the spoken instruction to [...] "write this down in your copy book." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first {{important}} {{case was}} O'Kelly v Trusthouse Forte plc. Some waiters worked various dinner {{functions in the}} Grosvenor House Hotel. They tried to form a union. They were dismissed. They claimed that this was unfair, and to do that, they had <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>they</b> were [...] "employees" [...] {{within the meaning of}} the unfair dismissal legislation. [...] The word [...] "employee" [...] had hitherto always been taken to mean someone who is obviously not in business on his own account (i.e. not [...] "self employed"), but recognised as subordinate labour, economically dependent on the employer. However, Alexander Irvine QC argued that the waiters had no [...] "mutuality of obligation" [...] with the employer: they were not bound to accept work engagements when they were called up, and the employer was under no obligation to call them up. They could leave, or be fired, at will. Sir John Donaldson accepted this argument and deemed the waiters to fall outside of the scope of unfair dismissal legislation.|$|E

[...] Johnny Behan testified that he tried to prevent the confrontation. I [...] "told them...I was down there for the purpose of disarming the Clantons and McLaurys. They wouldn't heed me, paid no attention. And I said, 'Gentleman, I am Sheriff of this County, and I am not going to allow any trouble if I can help it.' They brushed past me." [...] He said Cowboys had put up their hands or thrown open their coats <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>they</b> weren't armed, and that Doc Holliday had fired first. He testified that the first five shots had come from the Earps. He clearly blamed the Earps and Doc Holliday for instigating the shootout.|$|E
