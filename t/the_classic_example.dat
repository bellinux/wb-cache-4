5|$|The German leader Arminius is <b>the</b> <b>classic</b> <b>example</b> at an {{individual}} level: {{after several years}} of serving in Rome's forces as prefect of an auxiliary unit, he used the military training and experience he had gained to lead a confederacy of German tribes against Rome, culminating in the destruction of three Roman legions in the Teutoberg Forest in 9AD, and the abandonment of Augustus' strategy of annexing Germany as far as the Elbe river. (This strategy was never revived by later emperors).|$|E
5|$|The near-absence {{of genetic}} {{recombination}} in mitochondrial DNA {{makes it a}} useful source of information for scientists involved in population genetics and evolutionary biology. Because all the mitochondrial DNA is inherited as a single unit, or haplotype, the relationships between mitochondrial DNA from different individuals can be represented as a gene tree. Patterns in these gene trees {{can be used to}} infer the evolutionary history of populations. <b>The</b> <b>classic</b> <b>example</b> of this is in human evolutionary genetics, where the molecular clock can be used to provide a recent date for mitochondrial Eve. This is often interpreted as strong support for a recent modern human expansion out of Africa. Another human example is the sequencing of mitochondrial DNA from Neanderthal bones. The relatively large evolutionary distance between the mitochondrial DNA sequences of Neanderthals and living humans has been interpreted as evidence for the lack of interbreeding between Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans.|$|E

25|$|A network {{covalent}} solid {{consists of}} atoms {{held together by}} a network of covalent bonds (pairs of electrons shared between atoms of similar electronegativity), and hence {{can be regarded as}} a single, large molecule. <b>The</b> <b>classic</b> <b>example</b> is diamond; other examples include silicon, quartz and graphite.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>classic</b> <b>example</b> {{given by}} Marshall is of {{inferior}} quality staple foods, whose demand {{is driven by}} poverty that makes their purchasers unable to afford superior foodstuffs. As {{the price of the}} cheap staple rises, they {{can no longer afford to}} supplement their diet with better foods, and must consume more of the staple food.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>classic</b> <b>example</b> of the {{trans effect}} is the {{synthesis}} of cisplatin. Starting from PtCl42−, the first NH3 ligand is added {{to any of the}} four equivalent positions at random. However, since Cl− has a larger trans effect than NH3, the second NH3 is added trans to a Cl− and therefore cis to the first NH3.|$|E

Hence, unsought goods require advertising and personal-selling support.|$|R
25|$|The heter mechira was {{accepted}} by Modern Orthodox Judaism {{and is one of}} <b>the</b> <b>classic</b> <b>examples</b> of <b>the</b> Modern Orthodox approach toward adapting classical Jewish law to the modern world.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>classic</b> <b>example</b> is the telephone, where {{a greater}} number of users {{increases}} the value to each. A positive externality is created when a telephone is purchased without its owner intending to create value for other users, but does so regardless. Online social networks work similarly, with sites like Twitter and Facebook increasing in value to each member as more users join.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>classic</b> <b>example.</b> A {{number of}} {{cuneiform}} tablets {{were found at}} Amarna in Egypt, the city of the pharaoh Akhenaten. They were written mostly in Akkadian, the diplomatic language of the time. Several named rulers in the region including the kings of Assyria and Babylon. Assuming that the correct kings have been identified, it locks the chronology of the ancient Near East to that of Egypt, {{at least from the}} middle of the 2nd millennium.|$|E
25|$|When {{a mineral}} is broken in a {{direction}} that does not correspond to a plane of cleavage, it is termed to have been fractured. There are several types of uneven fracture. <b>The</b> <b>classic</b> <b>example</b> is conchoidal fracture, like that of quartz; rounded surfaces are created, which are marked by smooth curved lines. This type of fracture occurs only in very homogeneous minerals. Other types of fracture are fibrous, splintery, and hackly. The latter describes a break along a rough, jagged surface; an example of this property is found in native copper.|$|E

25|$|The red body, slow {{peculiar}} flight, bright colouration {{and pattern}} of the wings are meant to indicate to predators that this butterfly is inedible, being well protected by the poisons it has sequestered from its larval food plant. It also emits a nasty smelling substance when handled to further enhance its unappealing qualities. Hence it is rarely attacked by predators, a strategy so successful, that edible butterflies have evolved to mimic it, <b>the</b> <b>classic</b> <b>example</b> being that of the female morph of the common Mormon that is Papilio polytes, female form stichius.|$|E
25|$|Homeless shelters {{often provide}} other {{services}} to the community at large. <b>The</b> <b>classic</b> <b>example</b> is the soup kitchen for persons who are not staying at the shelter. Others include support groups, and/or substance abuse treatment. If they do not offer any of these services, they can usually refer their clients to agencies that do. Supportive housing integrates services in a more assertive fashion. The typical pathway through the interlocking system is that a person may start in a shelter and move through transitional housing into supportive housing and finally independent housing.|$|E
25|$|While many {{examples}} exist, <b>the</b> <b>classic</b> <b>example</b> {{was reported by}} Goody and Watt (1968). Written records prepared by the British in Ghana in the early 1900s show that Ndewura Jakpa, the seventeenth century founder {{of the state of}} Gonja, had seven sons, each of whom ruled a territorial division within the state. Six decades later two of the divisions had disappeared for various reasons. The myths of the Gonja had been revised to recount that Jakpa had five sons, and that five divisions were created. Since they had no practical, present purpose, the other two sons and divisions had evaporated.|$|E

25|$|Definite loss: The loss {{takes place}} at a known time, in a known place, and from a known cause. <b>The</b> <b>classic</b> <b>example</b> is death of an insured person on a life {{insurance}} policy. Fire, automobile accidents, and worker injuries may all easily meet this criterion. Other types of losses may only be definite in theory. Occupational disease, for instance, may involve prolonged exposure to injurious conditions where no specific time, place, or cause is identifiable. Ideally, the time, place, and cause of a loss should be clear enough that a reasonable person, with sufficient information, could objectively verify all three elements.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>classic</b> <b>example</b> is the ear {{ossicles}} of mammals, {{which we}} know from paleontological and embryological studies originated in {{the upper and lower}} jaws and the hyoid bone of their synapsid ancestors, and further back still were part of the gill arches of early fish. We owe this esoteric knowledge to the comparative anatomists, who, a century ago, were {{at the cutting edge of}} evolutionary studies. The word exaptation was coined to cover these shifts in function, which are surprisingly common in evolutionary history. The origin of wings from feathers that were originally used for temperature regulation is a more recent discovery (see feathered dinosaurs).|$|E
25|$|In 1908, he and Kodály {{traveled}} {{into the}} countryside to collect and research old Magyar folk melodies. Their growing interest in folk music coincided with a contemporary social interest in traditional national culture. They made some surprising discoveries. Magyar folk music had previously been categorised as Gypsy music. <b>The</b> <b>classic</b> <b>example</b> is Franz Liszt's famous Hungarian Rhapsodies for piano, which he based on popular art songs performed by Romani bands of the time. In contrast, Bartók and Kodály discovered that the old Magyar folk melodies were based on pentatonic scales, {{similar to those in}} Asian folk traditions, such as those of Central Asia, Anatolia and Siberia.|$|E
