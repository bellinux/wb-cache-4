5|$|Andromeda {{is one of}} the 48 constellations {{listed by}} the 2nd-century Greco-Roman {{astronomer}} Ptolemy and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. Located north of the celestial equator, it is named for Andromeda, daughter of Cassiopeia, in the Greek myth, who was chained to a rock to be eaten by the sea monster Cetus. Andromeda is most prominent during autumn evenings in the Northern Hemisphere, along with several other constellations named for characters in the Perseus myth. Because of its northern declination, Andromeda is visible only north of 40° south latitude; for observers farther south it lies below the horizon. It {{is one of the}} largest constellations, with an area of 722 square degrees. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>over</b> 1,400 times the size of the full moon, 55% of the size of the largest constellation, Hydra, and over 10 times the size of the smallest constellation, Crux.|$|E

2500|$|As Romania {{made the}} {{transition}} to democracy, the Church was freed from most of its state control, although the State Secretariat for Religious Denominations still maintains control {{over a number of}} aspects of the church's management of property, finances and administration. The state provides funding for the church in proportion to the number of its members, based on census returns and [...] "the religion's needs" [...] which is considered to be an [...] "ambiguous provision". Currently, the state provides the funds necessary for paying the salaries of priests, deacons and other prelates and the pensions of retired clergy, as well as for expenses related to lay church personnel. For the Orthodox church <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>over</b> 100 million euros for salaries, with additional millions for construction and renovation of church property.

2500|$|California has {{the largest}} {{population}} of foster care youth in the nation, with 55,218 children in the system as of 2012. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>over</b> {{twice as many as}} the 20,529 foster children in New York, the state with the second largest population of foster youth, had by the end of 2012. Over 30 percent of California foster youth reside in Los Angeles County, amounting to 18,523 children. Children can be removed from their homes and placed into the foster care system for a variety of reasons, but, in California, 81.2 percent of children were removed because of neglect. Even after being placed in the foster care system, however, these children might not find the kind of care or stability they need. Girls in foster care have been shown to have marginally higher rates of teenage pregnancy than the general population of California. Children in foster care also have to face disproportionately high rates of mental illnesses as some studies have shown that as much as 47.9 percent of foster care youth showed signs of serious emotional or behavioral issues. After [...] "aging out" [...] of the system at age 18, research has shown that previous foster youth still face difficult instability in their lives. As much as 30 percent of previous foster children are diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Only about 50 percent graduate from high school and less than 10 percent graduate from college. A study focused on foster care alumni in Los Angeles County showed that about 65 percent leave foster care without a place to live and 25 percent are incarcerated by age 20. Despite these difficulties, California is working toward easing the transition for foster youth through programs and legislation like the California Fostering Connections to Success Act of 2010, which expanded upon similar federal legislation and increased the age limit for receiving foster care benefits.|$|E
