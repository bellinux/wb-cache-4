5|$|A {{modified}} version of the spacecraft was proposed, which would have included a cargo module attached to the back of a modified equipment module. The spacecraft would have approached the station, and docked backwards using a port on the rear of <b>the</b> <b>cargo</b> module. If one of the forward docking configurations had been used for the Gemini itself, the docking would have been controlled remotely from the station, with the Gemini then separating from <b>the</b> <b>cargo</b> module and flying around the station to dock normally on a different port. The rear-docking Gemini would have simply remained attached to <b>the</b> <b>cargo</b> module, with the crew boarding the station through it. Its docking would have been controlled by its own crew, from a station at the back of <b>the</b> <b>cargo</b> module.|$|E

40|$|Air cargo {{carriers}} used to 'own' <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> business. For {{over a decade}} though, <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> carriers' market share has been growing at lower rates than <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> market itself. Despite these difficulties and IATA's efforts to simplify air cargo processes by introducing electronic documentation, most shipments are still accompanied by printed documents - up to 30 and more per shipment. It {{is the purpose of}} the research to analyse the dynamics of <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> system, which lead to the challenges <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> industry is currently faced with. It is analysed, which role the various players of <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> system and its environment play and who is driving developments in <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> industry. Furthermore it is reflected, to what extent ICT (Information and Communication Technologies), namely electronic documentation for air <b>cargo,</b> impact <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> system’s dynamics and whether they can contribute to strengthen <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> industry again. Based on a historic review the main players of <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> system are identified and the development of their role is described in a first step. Applying a systems theoretic approach the dynamics of <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> system are reflected. This analysis reveals that, whilst there is information available regarding the structures of <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> system's environment, very little is known regarding the structures within <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> system itself and between its players: the freight forwarders, <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> carriers and <b>the</b> handling agents. In order to close this research gap, in a second empirical step, structured expert interviews with key players of <b>the</b> entire air <b>cargo</b> system (freight forwarders, handling agents, air {{cargo carriers}}, shippers and consignees, IT providers, IATA, customs) were held. Based on these interviews dynamics within <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> system are reflected and the impact of electronic documentation on these structures is analysed. The research shows that the use of ICT and particularly electronic documentation are a necessary, but not sufficient step for rendering air cargo profitable again. Instead, it is essential for the players within <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> system to redefine their own role as well as their mode of cooperation and communication...|$|R

5|$|Before {{specialized}} {{bulk carriers}} existed, shippers had two methods to move bulk goods by ship. In the first method, longshoremen loaded <b>the</b> <b>cargo</b> into sacks, stacked the sacks onto pallets, {{and put the}} pallets into <b>the</b> <b>cargo</b> hold with a crane. The second method required the shipper to charter an entire ship and spend {{time and money to}} build plywood bins into the holds. Then, to guide <b>the</b> <b>cargo</b> through the small hatches, wooden feeders and shifting boards had to be constructed. These methods were slow and labor-intensive. As with the container ship, the problem of efficient loading and unloading has driven the evolution of the bulk carrier.|$|E

40|$|The {{analysis}} of <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> demand {{is based on}} the application of a system engineering technique which includes 12 conditional factors. Firstly the intercontinental trade, the latest development of logistics and the influences of the changes in prices and the supply of air cargo transport are explained in detail. During the next step the reciprocal influence of each of the factors is discussed separately and formally interpreted. As a result a formal method to estimate the volume and the composition of <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> demand is developed. The description of the rudiments of the organisation of <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> supply includes an explanation of the principal settings of the market. Apart from the segmentation of the supply into three different levels of quality, an approach to assess the individual features of <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> supply is proposed. Following this <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> volume of all European airports is systematically analysed. First the belly volume of passenger aircraft is observed, distinguishing the intercontinental and the continental volume. Moreover <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> transport on board of all-cargo aircraft counted at European airports is analysed. From this a formal model to explain <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> volume of an individual airport is evolved. This {{is based on the}} premise of widely liberal terms of competition within the air cargo-market and takes into account the Western European conditions. <b>The</b> air <b>cargo</b> supply is modelled analogous to the basic conditions of the decision making process of <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> industry. <b>The</b> suitability of the model for forecating is derived from ist application at the Munich airport. For the first time it is possible to consider the full variety of all conditional factors of <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> volume systematically. It can thus be concluded that the supply of <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> industry finally determines the volume and the structure of <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> of an airport.
