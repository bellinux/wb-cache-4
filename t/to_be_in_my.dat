500|$|The {{video was}} {{directed}} by James Foley, who worked with Madonna in her music video for [...] "Live to Tell", produced by David Naylor and Sharon Oreck, and Michael Ballhaus {{was in charge of}} the photography. The video was shot on location over three days in Staten Island, New York and Manhattan. Staten Island was chosen on Foley's suggestion as it was where he grew up: [...] "We talked about wanting to tap into a working-class environment, because by that time she had done 'Material Girl' and 'Like a Virgin' and other stuff that was very glamorous and stylized. She wanted to do something a bit more grounded and 'drama'." [...] Actor Alex McArthur was signed to play Madonna's boyfriend and the father of her child in the video. Madonna had spotted McArthur in a small role as a naive youth in the 1985 film Desert Hearts, and she thought he was a natural to play her mechanic boyfriend. [...] "I was out in the garage working on my Harley," [...] said McArthur, [...] "I answered the phone and a voice said, 'Hi, this is Madonna. I would like you <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> next video.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Rhimes said she tried {{to talk him out}} of quitting, explaining: [...] "I looked in his face and he was really sure. It felt like the right thing for him." [...] However, in another interview, Knight said of his exit: [...] "My five-year experience proved to me that I could not trust any answer that was given [...]" [...] Knight was [...] "at peace" [...] with his departure, saying: [...] "There just comes a time when it's so clear that moving on is the best decision." [...] However, Heigl tried to talk Knight out of leaving, saying: [...] "I didn't think it was the right decision. I felt like some of the problems could be worked through. But by the time it came to fruition, I was [...] for him because he was ready to go." [...] On the topic of losing a US$14 million contract, Knight commented: [...] "From an outsider's perspective, I get the [...] 'He's just a spoiled actor, he doesn’t know how good he has it.' There are a lot of people who would like <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> position. But in the end, I need to be fulfilled in my work." ...|$|E
500|$|Nino, a key villain, {{is portrayed}} by Ron Perlman, {{one of the}} last actors to join the cast. Regarding the casting of Perlman, Refn said, [...] "The {{character}} of Nino was originally not particularly interesting, so I asked Ron why he wanted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> movie when he's done so many great films. When Perlman said, 'I always wanted to play a Jewish man who wants to be an Italian gangster', and I asked why, and he said, 'because that's what I am – a Jewish boy from New York', well, that automatically cemented it for me." [...] Oscar Isaac portrays a Latino convict named Standard, who is married to Irene and is just released from prison a week after Irene meets The Driver. He found the role to be a bit unappealing and chose to turn the archetypal character into something more. He said of the role: As soon as I sat down with Nicolas, he explained this universe and world of the story, so we made the character into someone interested in owning a restaurant, someone who made some wrong decisions in his life, ending up in a bad place. By making 'Standard' more specific and more interesting, we found that it made the story that more compelling.|$|E

2500|$|Artists' {{representative}} Renaldo Epworth helped Wood land {{his early}} comic-book assignments, making it unclear if that connection led to Wood's lettering or to his comics-art debut, the ten-page story [...] "The Tip Off Woman" [...] in the Fox Comics Western Women Outlaws No. 4 (cover-dated January 1949, on sale late 1948). Wood's next known comic-book art {{did not appear}} until Fox's My Confession No. 7 (August 1949), at which time he began working almost continuously on the company's similar My Experience, My Secret Life, My Love Story and My True Love: Thrilling Confession Stories. His first signed work is believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Confession #8 (October 1949), with the name [...] "Woody" [...] half-hidden on a theater marquee.

My dad was a DJ {{in his early twenties}} so he had quite an extensive record collection that I listened to occasionally. After I experienced my first heartbreak and I thought the world was going to end, the natural way to console my tattered heart was to write a song. Of course my parents, being the supportive and loving caretakers they are, showered me with much undeserved praise and encouraged me to keep writing. My sister and I heeded their advice and began writing and playing original songs together." [...] – Meg ...|$|E
2500|$|Shortly after Motown {{moved their}} {{headquarters}} to Los Angeles, California in 1972, Jamerson moved there himself and found occasional studio work, but {{his relationship with}} Motown officially ended in 1973. He went on to perform on such 1970s hits as [...] "Neither One Of Us" [...] by Gladys Knight & The Pips (1973), [...] "Boogie Down" [...] (Eddie Kendricks, 1974), [...] "Boogie Fever" [...] (The Sylvers, 1976), [...] "You Don't Have to Be a Star (<b>To</b> <b>Be</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Show)" [...] (Marilyn McCoo and Billy Davis, Jr., 1976), and [...] "Heaven Must Have Sent You" [...] (Bonnie Pointer, 1979). He also played on recordings by Robert Palmer (Pressure Drop, 1975), Dennis Coffey (Instant Coffey, 1974), Wah Wah Watson (Elementary, 1976), Rhythm Heritage (1976), Al Wilson (1977), Eloise Laws (1977), Smokey Robinson (1978), Ben E. King (1978), Hubert Laws (1979), Tavares (1980), Joe Sample & David T. Walker (1981), and Bloodstone (1982). However, as other musicians went on to use high-tech amps, round-wound strings, and simpler, more repetitive bass lines incorporating new techniques like thumb slapping, Jamerson's style fell out of favor with local producers {{and he found himself}} reluctant to try new things. By the 1980s he was unable to get any serious gigs working as a session musician.|$|E
500|$|The episode also {{contains}} a scene wherein Reyes serenades Scully with [...] "karaoke renditions" [...] of whale calls.
