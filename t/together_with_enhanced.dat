It was demonstrated that many small mammals respond to winter-associated environmental cues by reducing their body mass and body fat mass <b>together</b> <b>with</b> <b>enhancing</b> thermogenesis (Merritt et al. 2001; Lovegrove 2005; Wang et al. 2006), such as Meriones unguiculatus (Li and Wang 2005 a), Microtus brandti (Li and Wang 2005 b), Djungarian hamster (Steinlechner et al. 1983), and Eothenomys miletus (Zhu et al. 2010 a, b). In contrast, other mammals maintain a stable body mass or even show an increase in body mass when exposed to winter-like conditions (Steinlechner et al. 1983), such as Dicrostonyx groenlandicus, Mesocricetus auratus, and Akodon azarae (Nagy 1993). In the present study, we showed that temperature is an important environmental cue that can cause A. draco to significantly reduce its body mass in cold conditions as a decreased body mass is important for decreasing absolute energy requirements. Body mass declines in winter-like conditions are considered to be an adaptive mechanism for reducing energy requirements when stress occurs (Li and Wang 2007).|$|R
