5|$|The pudendal nerve passes {{between the}} {{piriformis}} muscle and coccygeus (ischiococcygeus) muscles and leaves <b>the</b> <b>pelvis</b> through {{the lower part}} of the greater sciatic foramen. It crosses over the lateral part of the sacrospinous ligament and reenters <b>the</b> <b>pelvis</b> through the lesser sciatic foramen. After reentering <b>the</b> <b>pelvis,</b> it accompanies the internal pudendal artery and internal pudendal vein upwards and forwards along the lateral wall of the ischiorectal fossa, being contained in a sheath of the obturator fascia termed the pudendal canal, along with the internal pudendal blood vessels.|$|E
5|$|Opisthocoelicaudia {{may have}} been able to rear up on its hindlimbs for foraging, using its tail as a third leg. In 1977, Borsuk-Białynicka cited several {{skeletal}} features that might have been related to rearing, including the opisthocoelous vertebrae of the anterior part of the tail, which, according to this author, would have made the tail more flexible than in other sauropods. Features of <b>the</b> <b>pelvis,</b> such as the thickened shelf of the acetabulum, the flaring ilia, and the fused pubic symphysis, may have allowed <b>the</b> <b>pelvis</b> to withstand the stress of rearing.|$|E
5|$|The entepicondylar foramen is absent, as in {{all members}} of the Sigmodontinae; if present, as in some other rodents, this foramen (opening) {{perforates}} the distal (far) end of the humerus (upper arm bone). <b>The</b> <b>pelvis</b> and the bones of the hindlimbs are heavily built. The femoral tubercle of the acetabulum (part of <b>the</b> <b>pelvis),</b> which anchors the rectum femoris muscle, is reduced relative to Holochilus and Lundomys.|$|E

5|$|Pain {{produced}} by cancer within <b>the</b> <b>pelvis</b> {{varies depending on}} the affected tissue. It may appear {{at the site of}} the cancer but it frequently radiates diffusely to the upper thigh, and may refer to the lower back, the external genitalia or perineum.|$|E
5|$|Recurrence {{of early}} stage endometrial cancer ranges from 3 to 17%, {{depending}} on primary and adjuvant treatment. Most recurrences (75–80%) occur outside of <b>the</b> <b>pelvis,</b> and most occur {{two to three}} years after treatment, 64% after two years and 87% after three years.|$|E
5|$|Thoratic scutes on struthiosaurines are oval to {{teardrop}} shaped, and possess sharp ridges {{that rise}} distally. Some scutes {{were long and}} had small domes on them. The first primary osteoderms on <b>the</b> <b>pelvis</b> are large, compressed from the sides, and have a sharp, short point. S. sp. was preserved with five fragmentary scutes from <b>the</b> <b>pelvis.</b> One fragment includes two small scutes with a ridge down the middle, joining the two together, and a compressed osteoderm with a small spike. It is thought that the fragment was {{from the edge of}} the pelvic region. Another fragment includes two oval osteoderms with small ossicles fused between them. Pelvic shields were probably formed on struthiosaurines by these scutes.|$|E

5000|$|Like <b>the</b> bony <b>pelvis,</b> <b>the</b> renal <b>pelvis</b> ( [...] ) {{gets its}} English name via New Latin {{from the older}} Latin word , [...] "basin", as in [...] "wash basin". In both cases the name {{reflects}} {{the shape of the}} structure, {{and in the case of}} <b>the</b> renal <b>pelvis,</b> it also reflects the function. The name reflects that each renal pelvis collects urine from the calyces and funnels it into the ureter like a wash basin collects water and funnels it into a drain pipe. <b>The</b> renal <b>pelvis</b> is occasionally called the pyelum (from Greek πύελος pýelos, [...] "trough", ‘anything hollow’), and the combining form [...] denotes <b>the</b> renal <b>pelvis</b> (pyelo- is not to be confused with [...] ). The words [...] and [...] are other words for funnel-shaped cavities (which medical English got from the Latin and Greek words for [...] "funnel", respectively), and <b>the</b> renal <b>pelvis</b> is sometimes called the renal infundibulum. The form *renal choana is logical but is not used.|$|R
25|$|The pelvic {{region of}} the trunk {{includes}} <b>the</b> bony <b>pelvis,</b> <b>the</b> pelvic cavity (the space enclosed by <b>the</b> bony <b>pelvis),</b> <b>the</b> pelvic floor, below the pelvic cavity, and the perineum, below the pelvic floor. The pelvic skeleton is formed {{in the area of}} the back, by the sacrum and the coccyx and anteriorly and to the left and right sides, by a pair of hip bones.|$|R
5|$|Adjuvant {{radiotherapy}} {{is commonly}} used in early-stage (stage I or II) endometrial cancer. It can be delivered through vaginal brachytherapy (VBT), which is becoming the preferred route due to its reduced toxicity, or external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). Brachytherapy involves placing a radiation source in the organ affected; {{in the case of}} endometrial cancer a radiation source is placed directly in the vagina. External beam radiotherapy involves a beam of radiation aimed at the affected area from outside the body. VBT is used to treat any remaining cancer solely in the vagina, whereas EBRT can be used to treat remaining cancer elsewhere in <b>the</b> <b>pelvis</b> following surgery. However, the benefits of adjuvant radiotherapy are controversial. Though EBRT significantly reduces the rate of relapse in <b>the</b> <b>pelvis,</b> overall survival and metastasis rates are not improved. VBT provides a better quality of life than EBRT.|$|E
5|$|Depending {{on which}} bones are present, sex can be {{determined}} by looking for distinctive sexual dimorphisms. When available, <b>the</b> <b>pelvis</b> is extremely useful in the determination of sex and when properly examined can achieve sex determination with a great level of accuracy. The examination of the pubic arch {{and the location of}} the sacrum can help determine sex.|$|E
5|$|However, <b>the</b> <b>pelvis</b> is {{not always}} present, so {{forensic}} anthropologists {{must be aware of}} other areas on the skeleton that have distinct characteristics between sexes. The skull also contains multiple markers {{that can be used to}} determine sex. Specific markers on the skull include the temporal line, the eye sockets, the supraorbital ridge, as well as the nuchal lines, and the mastoid process. In general, male skulls tend to be larger and thicker than female skulls, and to have more pronounced ridges.|$|E
30|$|During {{cystoscopy}} a {{guide wire}} (Sensor®, Boston Scientific, Natick, USA) {{was placed in}} <b>the</b> renal <b>pelvis</b> via a ureteral catheter under fluoroscopic control. A dual lumen ureteral catheter (COOK Medical Inc, Bloomgton, USA) was then inserted and a second guide wire was placed in <b>the</b> renal <b>pelvis.</b> <b>The</b> dual lumen catheter was removed and a 4 -F ureteral catheter was placed {{over one of the}} guide wires in <b>the</b> renal <b>pelvis</b> for pelvic pressure (PP) measurements.|$|R
30|$|Inspection of mouse PET/CT images {{revealed}} a small subregion of high 64 Cu activity in <b>the</b> renal <b>pelvis.</b> This observation prompted micro-dosimetric evaluation based on imaging data, which measured an absorbed radiation dose of 0.610  mSv/MBq to <b>the</b> renal <b>pelvis.</b> These values were confirmed by analysis of primate imaging data, wherein the estimated absorbed radiation dose to <b>the</b> renal <b>pelvis</b> was 0.650  mSv/MBq.|$|R
50|$|In humans, <b>the</b> renal <b>pelvis</b> is <b>the</b> {{point of}} {{convergence}} {{of two or}} three major calyces. Each renal papilla is surrounded by a branch of <b>the</b> renal <b>pelvis</b> called a calyx.|$|R
5|$|Pelvic {{inflammatory}} disease or pelvic inflammatory disorder (PID) is an {{infection of the}} upper part of the female reproductive system namely the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries, and inside of <b>the</b> <b>pelvis.</b> Often there may be no symptoms. Signs and symptoms, when present may include lower abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, fever, burning with urination, pain with sex, or irregular menstruation. Untreated PID can result in long term complications including infertility, ectopic pregnancy, chronic pelvic pain, and cancer.|$|E
5|$|The {{type and}} sole {{accepted}} species of Kentrosaurus is Kentrosaurus aethiopicus, named by Hennig in 1915. Fragmentary fossil material from Wyoming, named Stegosaurus longispinus by Charles Gilmore in 1914, was in 1993 {{classified as a}} North American species of Kentrosaurus, as K. longispinus. However, this action was not accepted by the paleontological community, and S. longispinus has been assigned to its own genus, Alcovasaurus, differing from Kentrosaurus in having more elongated tail spikes {{and the structure of}} <b>the</b> <b>pelvis</b> and vertebrae.|$|E
5|$|Herrerasaurus {{displays}} {{traits that}} are found in different groups of dinosaurs, and several traits found in non-dinosaurian archosaurs. Although it shares most {{of the characteristics of}} dinosaurs, there are a few differences, particularly in the shape of its hip and leg bones. Its pelvis is like that of saurischian dinosaurs, but it has a bony acetabulum (where the femur meets <b>the</b> <b>pelvis)</b> that was only partially open. The ilium, the main hip bone, is supported by only two sacrals, a basal trait. However, the pubis points backwards, a derived trait as seen in dromaeosaurids and birds. Additionally, the end of the pubis has a booted shape, like those in avetheropods; and the vertebral centra has an hourglass shape as found in Allosaurus.|$|E

50|$|The sacrospinous {{ligament}} (small or anterior sacrosciatic ligament) is a thin, triangular {{ligament in}} <b>the</b> human <b>pelvis.</b> <b>The</b> {{base of the}} ligament {{is attached to the}} outer edge of the sacrum and coccyx, and the tip of the ligament attaches to the spine of the ischium, a bone in <b>the</b> human <b>pelvis.</b> Its fibres are intermingled with the sacrotuberous ligament.|$|R
5|$|In 1895, surgeon J. W. Ballantyne {{considered}} {{the case of}} the Biddenden Maids from a teratological perspective. He suggested that they had in fact been pygopagus (twins joined at <b>the</b> <b>pelvis).</b> Pygopagus twins are known to put their arms around each other's shoulders when walking, and Ballantyne suggested that this accounted for their apparently being joined at the shoulders in drawings. The pygopagus Millie and Christine McCoy had lived in Britain for a short time before going on to a successful singing career in the United States, and it was known from their case that such twins were capable of surviving to adulthood.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, eggs {{possibly}} {{attributable to}} M. yaotunensis were discovered paired inside <b>the</b> <b>pelvis</b> of a fossil oviraptorid skeleton. In 2008, Chinese paleontologists Cheng Yen-nien, Ji Qiang, Wu Xiao-chun and Shan Hsi-yin discovered {{a pair of}} eggs representing the first in China to contain embryonic remains of oviraptorosaurs. Both eggs were referred to M. yaotunensis. The fourth oospecies, M. lashuyuanensis, was described in 2009 by the Chinese paleontologists Fang Xiao-si, Li Pei-xian, Zhang Zhi-jun, Zhang Xian-qiu, Lin You-li, Guo Sheng-bin, Cheng Ye-ming, Li Zhen-yu, Zhang Xiao-jun and Cheng Zheng-wu.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} tetrapods, the gastralia and ribs with uncinate processes, {{together}} with bony {{elements such as}} bony plates in the skin (osteoderms) and clavicles (collar bone), would have formed a sort of exoskeleton around the body, protecting the belly and helping to hold in the guts and inner organs. These anatomical details most likely evolved from structures involved in locomotion even before the vertebrates ventured onto land. The gastralia {{may have been involved}} in the breathing process in early amphibians and reptiles. <b>The</b> <b>pelvis</b> and shoulder girdles are arranged differently from those of lizards, as is the case with other parts of the internal anatomy and its scales.|$|E
50|$|Kidney cancer {{originates}} in the kidney in two principal locations: the renal tubule and <b>the</b> renal <b>pelvis.</b> Most cancers in the renal tubule are {{renal cell carcinoma}} and clear cell adenocarcinoma.

5|$|Males reach sexual {{maturity}} at 3–5 weeks; females can be fertile {{as early as}} four weeks and can carry litters before they are adults. Females that have never given birth may develop irreversible fusing of the pubic symphysis, a joint in <b>the</b> <b>pelvis,</b> due to calcification which may occur between six and ten months of age. If they become pregnant after this has happened, the birth canal will not widen sufficiently; this may lead to dystocia and death {{as they attempt to}} give birth. Calcification of the female's pubic symphysis (if not bred) is a common myth. The reason for potential calcification is a metabolic disease, like ochronosis. A healthy, normal female guinea pig's pubic symphysis does not calcify.|$|E
5|$|Originally, Michael Raath (1972) {{described}} Vulcanodon {{not as a}} sauropod but as an advanced, specialized prosauropod, possibly of {{the family}} Melanorosauridae. According to Raath, the sauropod-like limb proportions have been independently evolved in Vulcanodon and sauropods (convergent evolution). He argued that primitive features of <b>the</b> <b>pelvis</b> {{as well as the}} knife-shaped teeth preclude a classification within the Sauropoda. The teeth, however, are now known to belong to a theropod. Arthur Cruickshank (1975) was the first to show that Vulcanodon was indeed a sauropod, arguing that the fifth metatarsal bone was equally long as the remaining metatarsals, a condition seen in other sauropods but not in prosauropods. Today, Vulcanodon is universally accepted {{to be one of the}} most basal (primitive) members of Sauropoda.|$|E
5|$|Raath (1972) {{noted the}} {{discovery}} of nine fragmentary carnivorous teeth near the pelvic region of the skeleton. He argued that the Vulcanodon carcass might have been embedded with {{the head and neck}} bended backwards above <b>the</b> <b>pelvis,</b> a posture called death pose that is frequently seen in dinosaur skeletons. The teeth would have been the only preserved elements of the skull. However, as shown by Cooper (1984), these teeth do not pertain to Vulcanodon but to a theropod dinosaur that may have scavenged on the Vulcanodon carcass.|$|E
3000|$|Introduction: {{to asses}} pelvic pain in {{patients}} underwent office transvaginal hydrolaparoscopyit is mini-invasive technique which allows exploration of <b>the</b> posterior <b>pelvis.</b> <b>The</b> procedure {{was performed in}} out-patient departments with local anesthesia, through the use a 3.9 mm diameter’s trocar inserted into the posterior fornix to 10 - 20 mm from the cervix, with a mini endoscope of 2.7 mm in diameter, a 30 ° optics used to view <b>the</b> posterior <b>pelvis.</b>|$|R
