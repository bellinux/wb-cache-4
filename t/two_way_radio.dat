2500|$|The four {{different}} versions had engines {{of three different}} configurations, two water-coooled V-12 engines and two [...] radial engines, one a single row nine cylinder, air-cooled unit and the other an eighteen-cylinder, water-cooled in-line radial engine. Although {{they were all in}} the [...] power range, their layouts required very different cowlings and resulted in a range of lengths. Otherwise the C.101-7 variants all had the same dimensions, though the weights varied. They all were fitted with <b>two</b> <b>way</b> <b>radio</b> and had generous fuel capacity for a good range; the tank of the C.103 at least could be released in an emergency to prevent it catching fire.|$|E

50|$|As two-way radios {{became the}} leading method of two-way communication, {{industries}} like movie and television production companies, security companies, event companies, sporting events and others {{needed to find}} a solution to use <b>two</b> <b>way</b> <b>radios</b> that was cost-effective and economically smart. Instead of buying two-way radios these companies began renting two-way radios short term and long term. The two-way radio rentals is a significant and important component of two-way radio businesses. Many have become reluctant to buy <b>two</b> <b>way</b> <b>radios</b> because of the duration of their event or the necessity to save money. Renting <b>two</b> <b>way</b> <b>radios</b> has brought comfort to customers in renting <b>two</b> <b>way</b> <b>radios</b> because the price and non commitment to owning such <b>two</b> <b>way</b> communication devices. Customers can rent anything from two-way radios to two-way radio equipment like speaker microphones or repeaters.|$|R
50|$|Although the Niagara Parks Police are Special Constables, the sworn {{full-time}} {{officers are}} among the few Special Constables in Canada authorized to carry firearms on top of other standard equipment such as handcuffs, telescopic baton, pepper spray, <b>two</b> <b>way</b> <b>radios,</b> {{similar to that of}} other police services across Canada. Seasonal Provincial Offences Officers are not trained or authorized to carry any form of use of force equipment and therefore carry only <b>two</b> <b>way</b> <b>radios</b> for communication.|$|R
5000|$|Equipment consoles: These {{are used}} to house <b>two</b> <b>way</b> <b>radios,</b> light switches, and siren switches. Some may be {{equipped}} with locking compartments for safe storage of firearms or file compartments.|$|R
5000|$|The SCR-694 was a {{portable}} <b>two</b> <b>way</b> <b>radio</b> set {{used by the}} U.S. military during World War II.|$|E
5000|$|DXing is {{the hobby}} of {{receiving}} and identifying distant radio or television signals, or making <b>two</b> <b>way</b> <b>radio</b> contact with distant stations in amateur radio, citizens' band radio or other <b>two</b> <b>way</b> <b>radio</b> communications. Many DXers also attempt to obtain written verifications of reception or contact, {{sometimes referred to}} as [...] "QSLs" [...] or [...] "veries". The name of the hobby comes from DX, telegraphic shorthand for [...] "distance" [...] or [...] "distant".|$|E
50|$|On {{an episode}} of McHale's Navy (1962-1966) {{a bit of the}} song was sung by Ensign Chuck Parker (Tim Conway) into a <b>two</b> <b>way</b> <b>radio</b> as a code.|$|E
50|$|Not all <b>two</b> <b>way</b> <b>radios</b> are {{hand-held}} devices. The same {{technology that}} is used in <b>two</b> <b>way</b> <b>radios</b> can be placed in other radio forms. An {{example of this is}} a wireless callbox. A wireless callbox is a device {{that can be used for}} voice communication at security gates and doors. Not only can they be used to talk to people at these entry points, personnel can remotely unlock the door so the visitor can enter. There are also customer service callboxes that can be placed around a business that a customer can use to summon help from a two-way radio equipped store employee.|$|R
50|$|ICOM {{manufactures}} <b>two</b> <b>way</b> <b>radios</b> and receivers for use {{in marine}} applications, Airband, amateur radio applications, land mobile applications, and FRS / GMRS applications. Some radios made by ICOM are compatible with Motorola and SmarTrunk trunking systems.|$|R
50|$|Two of {{the trucks}} became bogged leaving their crews unable to escape. Vaporising of fuel {{lines and the}} absence of <b>two</b> <b>way</b> <b>radios</b> also {{hindered}} the attempt of the men to fight the fire highlighting the need for improved equipment.|$|R

50|$|Another use of {{two-way radio}} {{technology}} {{is for a}} wireless PA system. A wireless PA is essentially a one-way <b>two</b> <b>way</b> <b>radio</b> that enables broadcasting messages from handheld two-way radios or base station intercoms.|$|E
50|$|The bomb squad {{was formed}} in the 1980s. In 2005, the Bomb Squad {{received}} its first BDR, (bomb disposal robot), with a camera, <b>two</b> <b>way</b> <b>radio</b> and a disposal arm. It is also used in hostage negotiations.|$|E
5000|$|Rubber Ducky [...] - [...] Most {{common antenna}} used on {{portable}} <b>two</b> <b>way</b> <b>radios</b> and cordless phones {{due to its}} compactness, consists of an electrically short wire helix. The helix adds inductance to cancel the capacitive reactance of the short radiator, making it resonant. Very low gain.|$|R
50|$|The {{range of}} the eXRS radios is not {{explicitly}} stated, however, the manufacturer claims that it is {{equal to or greater}} than FRS and GMRS. Since the Earth is curved, the range of <b>two</b> <b>way</b> <b>radios</b> at these frequencies is limited to about 6 miles in good conditions, regardless of the advertised range.|$|R

5000|$|When {{undertaking}} arrest warrants, agents may wear bullet-resistant vests, badges {{and other}} clothing bearing the inscription [...] "bail enforcement agent", or similar titles. Many agents also use <b>two</b> <b>way</b> <b>radios</b> {{to communicate with}} each other. Many agents arm themselves with firearms; or sometimes with less lethal weapons, such as tasers, batons, and the lachrymators CS gas and pepper spray, or pepper spray projectiles.|$|R
50|$|Rubber ducky antennas {{have lower}} gain than a full size quarter-wavelength antenna, {{reducing}} {{the range of}} the radio. They are typically used in short-range <b>two</b> <b>way</b> <b>radios</b> where maximum range is not a requirement. Their design is a compromise between antenna gain and small size. They are difficult to characterize electrically because the current distribution along the element is not sinusoidal {{as is the case with}} a thin linear antenna.|$|R
50|$|VHF is {{the first}} band at which {{wavelengths}} are small enough that efficient transmitting antennas are short enough to mount on vehicles and handheld devices, so the VHF and UHF wavelengths are used for <b>two</b> <b>way</b> <b>radios</b> in vehicles, aircraft, and handheld transceivers and walkie talkies. Portable radios usually use whips or rubber ducky antennas, while base stations usually use larger fiberglass whips or collinear arrays of vertical dipoles.|$|R
50|$|There {{is a third}} smaller tower {{that has}} many {{directional}} antennae, mainly used for telecommunications, but also for <b>two</b> <b>way</b> <b>radio</b> for emergency services and other similar purposes. It has Telstra markings on much of the equipment and sheds.|$|E
50|$|As {{a pioneer}} of {{commercial}} radio networks, Vertel provided its first fully managed <b>two</b> <b>way</b> <b>radio</b> network some 24 years before the deregulation of the Australian telecommunications market (and 8 years before the first mobile phone call {{was placed in the}} country).|$|E

50|$|The town watch {{program is}} similar to that of the {{neighborhood}} watch, the major difference is that the Town Watch tend to actively patrol in pseudo-uniforms, i.e. marked vests or jackets and caps, and is equipped with <b>two</b> <b>way</b> <b>radios</b> to directly contact the local police. The Town Watch serves as an auxiliary to the police which provides weapons (if any), equipment, and training. The town watch usually returns their gear at the end of their duty.|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} an antenna {{is related to}} the length of the radio waves used. The UHF antenna is stubby and short; at UHF {{frequencies}} a quarter-wave monopole, the most common omnidirectional antenna is between 2.5 and 25 cm long. UHF wavelengths are short enough that efficient transmitting antennas are small enough to mount on handheld and mobile devices, so these frequencies are used for <b>two</b> <b>way</b> land mobile <b>radio</b> systems, such as walkie-talkies, <b>two</b> <b>way</b> <b>radios</b> in vehicles, and for portable wireless devices; cordless phones and cell phones. Omnidirectional UHF antennas used on mobile devices are usually short whips, sleeve dipoles, rubber ducky antennas or the planar inverted F antenna (PIFA) used in cellphones. Higher gain omnidirectional UHF antennas can be made of collinear arrays of dipoles and are used for mobile base stations and cellular base station antennas.|$|R
50|$|Audio {{equipment}} {{associated with}} radio transmitters, particularly transceivers in <b>two</b> <b>way</b> <b>radios,</b> such as Citizens band, FRS, which have {{automatic gain control}} (AGC) or squelch noise control. Malfunctions in the AGC or squelch circuits, which have long time constants, can cause low frequency oscillation. Another possible cause, sometimes {{in combination with the}} first, is leakage of the strong radio frequency (RF) signal from the transmitter into the receiver audio sections, which can cause quenching oscillations. This is a RFI problem, caused by inadequate shielding or filtering to keep the RF out.|$|R
50|$|The {{company was}} formed in 1973 when a young Australian {{entrepreneur}} started a business called Communication Site Rentals. As the name suggested, this business initially provided high communication sites for government departments and large organisations who wanted to deploy <b>two</b> <b>way</b> <b>radio</b> (at the time a relatively new technology).|$|E
50|$|For example, during marine {{transfer}} operations when flammable products are transferred between the marine terminal and tanker ships or barges, two-way radio communication {{needs to be}} constantly maintained in case the transfer needs to stop for unforeseen reasons such as a spill. The United States Coast Guard requires that the <b>two</b> <b>way</b> <b>radio</b> must be certified as intrinsically safe.|$|E
50|$|The UK Government has {{commissioned}} a UK Spectrum Usage and Demand report through the UK Spectrum Policy Forum (run by Department for Culture, Media and Sport).

50|$|Land mobile {{radio system}} (LMRS), also called public {{land mobile radio}} or private land mobile radio, is a {{wireless}} communications system intended for use by terrestrial users in vehicles (mobiles) or on foot (portables). Examples are <b>two</b> <b>way</b> <b>radios</b> in vehicles. Such systems are used by emergency first responder organizations such as police, fire, and ambulance services, public works organizations, dispatched services such as taxis, or companies with large vehicle fleets or numerous field staff. Such a system can be independent, but often can be connected to other fixed systems such as the {{public switched telephone network}} (PSTN) or cellular networks.|$|R
