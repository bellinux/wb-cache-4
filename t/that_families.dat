5|$|Furthermore, it {{was found}} <b>that</b> <b>families</b> failed to seek medical {{treatment}} for their daughters because of the stigma associated with negative medical histories.

5|$|Members of the Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) {{along with}} Kasargod MP P Karunkaran staged a protest on 8 September 2010 at the airline's office in Mangalore where they {{submitted}} a memorandum to officials demanding <b>that</b> <b>families</b> {{of the victims}} receive early and equitable settlements of compensation due.

5|$|Nintendo {{targeted}} a wider demographic profile {{with the}} first Nintendo DS (2004) than it had with the Game Boy line. Comparing 2008 life-to-date DS and DS Lite sales to the best-selling game console, Sony's PlayStation 2, showed potential in further expanding the Nintendo DS gaming population—particularly in Europe and the United States. To further promote the product line while expanding its gaming population, Nintendo created the DSi. Iwata has said <b>that</b> <b>families</b> often share DS and DS Lite consoles, so to encourage each family member to buy an individual handheld, Nintendo added personalization features to the DSi.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary purpose}} of Weston's new colony was profit, rather than the {{religious}} reasons of the Plymouth settlers, and this dictated how the colony would be assembled. Weston believed <b>that</b> <b>families</b> were a detriment to a well-run plantation and so he selected able-bodied men only but not men experienced in colonial life. In total, there were several advanced scouts and fifty to sixty other colonists. The final complement also included one surgeon and one lawyer. The party was outfitted with enough supplies to last the winter.|$|E
40|$|Research {{suggests}} <b>that</b> <b>family</b> camp {{experiences can}} enhance family relationships. Families often participate in family camp experiences for a vacation, {{as part of}} a therapeutic and/or intervention strategy, or to gain general enrichment or engagement. To better understand the impacts of family camp experiences on family functioning, a mixed-methods study was conducted with 60 families across 18 camps. Respondents shared <b>that</b> <b>family</b> camp experiences benefit families because of the positive impacts of the camp staff, parenting reinforcement, and enhancement of family relationships, with 60 % of respondents indicating <b>that</b> <b>family</b> camp experiences reinforced good parenting and 86 % of respondents indicating <b>that</b> the <b>family</b> camp experience reinforced family relationships. Recommendations for future research and practice are provided...|$|R

5|$|While the DSi's {{design is}} similar to that of the DS Lite, it {{features}} two digital cameras, supports internal and external content storage, and connects to an online store called the Nintendo DSi Shop. Nintendo stated <b>that</b> <b>families</b> often share DS and DS Lite consoles. Its new functionality was intended to facilitate personalization, so as to encourage each member of a household to purchase a DSi. The handheld supports exclusive physical media in addition to DS games with DSi-specific features and standard DS titles. The only exception to its backward compatibility are earlier DS games that required the GBA slot. Nintendo had sold over 41 million DSi and DSi XL units combined.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the Taiwan flooding in Kaohsiung, officials deployed 7,888troops to the southern portion of the island to assist in rescue and recovery work. Soldiers also set up five medical centers, and utilized amphibious vehicles to rescue people in flooded areas. Taiwan's president Ma Ying-jeou toured the flooded regions on September23, emphasizing that efforts to drain the flooding should be the main priority. More than 100buildings in Kaohsiung required water pumps and thousands of volunteers to remove standing water from basements and streets. The mayor Kiku Chen temporarily suspended her reelection campaign due to the floods. About 80% of the factories in Kaohsiung were reopened by September21. The high crop damage allowed farmers to qualify for low interest loans. Rail lines took two weeks to reopen due to damage. Power and water service was restored {{within days of the}} storm, although residents in flooded areas were advised to boil water before usage. There was also an increase in dengue fever after the floods. The Red Cross Society of China donated about US$100,000 {{in the days after the}} storm. The government announced on September20 <b>that</b> <b>families</b> affected by the floods would receive NT$30,000 (US$945.92) per house. Throughout Taiwan, exports during September 2010 decreased 6.9% from August's levels due to the storm and an industrial fire.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} family control and dividend policy in Indonesia. There are three possible explanations for the relationship. The expropriation hypothesis predicts <b>that</b> <b>family</b> control has {{a negative impact on}} dividend payouts. Meanwhile the reputation hypothesis and the family income hypothesis predict <b>that</b> <b>family</b> control has a positive impact on dividend payouts. Using a panel data of Indonesian publicly listed firms in the period of 2003 - 2009, the results shows <b>that</b> <b>family</b> control has a significant negative impact on dividend payouts, dividend yields and likelyhood to pay dividends. The results control for other variables that may potentially affect dividend payments such as growth opportunity, debt, profitability, firm size and firm age. From agency theory perspective, the finding is consistent with the argument <b>that</b> <b>family</b> controlling shareholders prefer lower dividends, in order to preserve cash flows that they can potentially expropriate (the expropriation hypothesis) ...|$|R

25|$|An {{important}} factor is <b>that</b> <b>families</b> {{did not produce}} a sufficient amount of male descendants. As noble status was inherited patrilineally, the lack of men lead to families’ extinction. A reason is that noblemen as warriors were exposed to greater risks than the population in general and therefore died in a young age and without issue.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} I present {{empirical}} evidence <b>that</b> employment in <b>family</b> firms is less sensitive to performance and product market fluctuations, {{both at the}} industry and at the firm level. This supports the idea <b>that</b> <b>family</b> firms are able to offer their employees implicit employment protection. Family firms {{are believed to have}} longer time horizons, and are as owners more easily identified with their company and its actions. These are features <b>that</b> could make <b>family</b> firms more cautious in terms of adjusting their employment. I confirm previous findings <b>that</b> <b>family</b> firms are less sensitive to sales fluctuations at the industry level and I show that this also holds for fluctuations in value added. I extend the analysis to show <b>that</b> <b>family</b> firms are less sensitive to unanticipated industry shocks by filtering out the trend component. When investigating idiosyncratic shocks to the firm, I find <b>that</b> <b>family</b> firms are less anxious to translate temporary shocks in performance into changes in employment. By using full population data from tax registers, I am able to identify all family firms, both listed and non-listed. This has previously not been feasible...|$|R

25|$|At {{the time}} of {{creating}} the poverty definition, the Department of Agriculture found <b>that</b> <b>families</b> of three or more persons spent about one third of their after-tax income on food. For these families, poverty thresholds were set at three times {{the cost of the}} economy food plan. Different procedures were used for calculating poverty thresholds for two-person households and persons living alone. Annual updates of the SSA poverty thresholds were based on price changes in the economy food plan, but updates do not reflect other changes (food is no longer one-third of the after-tax income).|$|E
