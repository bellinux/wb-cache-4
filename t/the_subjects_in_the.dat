The results were printed in the March 2004 issue, after about 1,979 votes had been cast. The three couples with {{the highest number of}} votes were Nagisa/Tamao at 481 votes, Hikari/Amane at 343 votes, and Kizuna/Chikaru at 260 votes. The results from the second round of voting were published in the May 2004 issue of the magazine which included the figures for the sixty-four different combinations between the twelve girls. The three couples with the highest number of votes this time were Nagisa/Tamao again at 150 votes, Nagisa/Amane at 114 votes, and Hikari/Amane for a second time at 102 votes. In the third round of voting in the July 2004 issue, the number of votes increased dramatically; the number one voted couple {{for the third time in}} a row was Nagisa/Tamao at 1,215 votes.|$|E

25|$|The half dome of {{the central}} apse has a colossal half-length figure of Christ, with a seated Virgin and Child below; the other apses have {{full-length}} figures of St Peter and St Paul. Inscriptions on each picture explain the subject or saint represented; these are in Latin, except some few which are in Greek. <b>The</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nave begin with scenes from the Book of Genesis, illustrating the Old Testament types of Christ and His scheme of redemption, with figures of those who prophesied and prepared for His coming. Around the lower tier and the choir are subjects from the New Testament, chiefly representing Christ's miracles and suffering, with apostles, evangelists and other saints. The design, execution and choice of subjects all appear to be of Byzantine origin, the subjects being selected from the Menologion of Basil II drawn up by the emperor Basil II in the 10th century.|$|E

500|$|Badu's songwriting was {{characterized}} by pointillism, stream of consciousness, and scenic narrative. Her lyrics are alternately overtly political and deeply personal, interlaced with Five Percenter notions and references to the Nation of Islam. Badu expresses a motherly perspective and feelings of dismay and empathy for <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> songs. Charles Aaron commented that [...] "a sense of history and maternal compassion ... grounds even her most oblique forays." [...] Abebe wrote similarly, [...] "her keen writing about people" [...] gives songs [...] "much of their shape" [...] and views that her candor helps communicate the album's [...] "social concerns, which could otherwise sound like {{a laundry list of}} black-community struggles".|$|E

[...] He said that running a marathon was the most difficult thing he had done in his life, until he started to make a documentary about it. [...] Following storylines of runners training all over the world, and filming <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crowded Chicago Marathon are some of the challenges Dunham encountered when making the film.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the study, when asked to rate the tedious tasks, the subjects of the second group (paid $1) rated the tasks more positively than did <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first group (paid $20) and than did the subjects of the control group; the responses of the paid subjects were evidence of cognitive dissonance. The researchers, Festinger and Carlsmith, proposed that the subjects experienced dissonance, between the conflicting cognitions: [...] "I told someone that the task was interesting." [...] and [...] "I actually found it boring." [...] Moreover, the subjects paid one-dollar were induced to comply; compelled to internalize the [...] "interesting task" [...] mental attitude, because they had no other justification. The subjects paid twenty dollars were induced to comply by way of an obvious, external justification for internalizing the [...] "interesting task" [...] mental attitude, thus, they experienced a lesser degree of cognitive dissonance.|$|E

2500|$|The {{antithesis of}} the heroic Aryan race with its vital, {{creative}} life-improving qualities was the [...] "Jewish race", whom Chamberlain presented as the inverse of the Aryan. Every positive quality the Aryans had, the Jews had the exact opposing negative quality. The American historian Geoffrey Field wrote: To each negative [...] "Semitic" [...] trait Chamberlain counter-posed a Teutonic virtue. Kantian moral freedom took the place of political liberty and egalitarianism. Irresponsible Jewish capitalism was sharply distinguished from the vague ideal of Teutonic industrialism, a romantic vision of an advanced technological society which had somehow managed to retain the Volksgemeinschaft, cooperation and hierarchy of the medieval guilds. The alternative to Marxism was [...] "ethical socialism", such as that described by Thomas More, [...] "one of the most exquisite scholars ever produced by a Teutonic people, of an absolutely aristocratic, refined nature". In the rigidly elitist, disciplined society of Utopia with its strong aura of Christian humanism, Chamberlain found an approximation of his own nostalgic, communal ideal. [...] "The gulf separating More from Marx", he wrote, [...] "is not the progress of time, but the contrast between Teuton and Jew". Chamberlain announced in The Foundations that [...] "all the wars" [...] in history were [...] "so peculiarly connected with Jewish financial operations". Chamberlain warned that {{the aim of the}} Jew was [...] "to put his foot upon the neck of all nations of the world and be Lord and possessor of the whole earth". As part of their plans to destroy Aryan civilization, Chamberlain wrote: [...] "Consider, with what mastery they use the law of blood to extend their power." [...] Chamberlain wrote that Jewish women were encouraged to marry Gentiles while Jewish men were not, so the male line [...] "remained spotless...thousands of side-branches are cut off and employed to infect Indo-Europeans with Jewish blood". In his account of the Punic wars between [...] "Aryan Rome" [...] and [...] "Semitic Carthage", Chamberlain praised the Romans for their total destruction of Carthage in 146 BC {{at the end of the}} Third Punic War as an example of how Aryans should deal with Semites. Later on, Chamberlain argued that the Romans had become too tolerant of Semites like the Jews, and this was the cause of the downfall of the Roman empire. Chamberlain argued that it was due to miscegenation that the Jews had caused the Aryan Roman Empire to go into decline and collapse. Chamberlain wrote that the [...] "African half breed soldier emperor" [...] Caracalla had granted Roman citizenship to all <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Empire regardless of race or religion in 212 AD, and as result of this, the Romans had freely mixed with Semitic and African peoples, leading Chamberlain to conclude: [...] "Like a cataract the alien blood poured down into the depopulated city of Rome and soon the Romans ceased to exist". As such, the destruction of the Western Roman Empire by the Germanic peoples was merely an act of liberation from the Völkerchaos ("Chaos of the Peoples") that the Roman empire had become.|$|E

60|$|It is, however, to {{be remembered}} that this {{quietness}} in character of subject was much more possible to an early painter, owing to the connection in which his works were to be seen. A modern picture, isolated and portable, must rest all its claims to attention on its own actual subject: but {{the pictures of the}} early masters were nearly always parts of a consecutive and stable series, in which many were subdued, like the connecting passages of a prolonged poem, in order to enhance the value or meaning of others. The arrangement of <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Arena Chapel is in this respect peculiarly skilful; and to that arrangement we must now direct our attention.|$|E

We were of opinion, that, if our dependencies had so outgrown the positive institutions made {{for the preservation of}} liberty in this kingdom, that the operation of their powers was become rather a pressure than a relief to <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> colonies, wisdom dictated that the spirit of the Constitution should rather be applied to their circumstances, than its authority enforced with violence in those very parts where its reason became wholly inapplicable.|$|E

60|$|The artist appears, {{until very}} lately, rather {{to have taken}} from Switzerland {{thoughts}} and general conceptions of size and of grand form and effect {{to be used in}} his after compositions, than to have attempted the seizing of its actual character. This was beforehand to be expected from the utter physical impossibility of rendering certain effects of Swiss scenery, and the monotony and unmanageableness of others. The Valley of Chamounix in the collection of Walter Fawkes, Esq., I have never seen; it has a high reputation; the Hannibal passing the Alps in its present state exhibits nothing but a heavy shower and a crowd of people getting wet; another picture in the artist's gallery of a land-fall is most masterly and interesting, but more daring than agreeable. The Snowstorm, avalanche, and inundation, is one of his mightiest works, but the amount of mountain drawing in it is less than of cloud and effect; <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Liber Studiorum are on the whole the most intensely felt, and next to them the vignettes to Rogers's Poems and Italy.
