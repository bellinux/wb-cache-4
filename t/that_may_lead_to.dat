5|$|Swelling of damaged muscle {{occasionally}} {{leads to}} compartment syndrome—compression of surrounding tissues, such as nerves and blood vessels, {{in the same}} fascial compartment—leading {{to the loss of}} blood supply and damage or loss of function in the part(s) of the body supplied by these structures. Symptoms of this complication include pain or reduced sensation in the affected limb. A second recognized complication is disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a severe disruption in blood clotting <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> uncontrollable bleeding.|$|E
5|$|Children with RAD are {{presumed to}} have grossly {{disturbed}} internal working models of relationships <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> interpersonal and behavioral difficulties in later life. There are few studies of long-term effects, {{and there is}} a lack of clarity about the presentation of the disorder beyond the age of five years. However, the opening of orphanages in Eastern Europe following the end of the Cold War in the early-1990s provided opportunities for research on infants and toddlers brought up in very deprived conditions. Such research broadened the understanding of the prevalence, causes, mechanism and assessment of disorders of attachment and led to efforts from the late-1990s onwards to develop treatment and prevention programs and better methods of assessment. Mainstream theorists in the field have proposed that a broader range of conditions arising from problems with attachment should be defined beyond current classifications.|$|E
