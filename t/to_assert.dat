25|$|The śramaṇa traditions {{subscribed to}} diverse philosophies, {{significantly}} disagreeing {{with each other}} as well as orthodox Hinduism and its six schools of Hindu philosophy. The differences ranged from a belief that every individual has a soul (self, atman) <b>to</b> <b>asserting</b> {{that there is no}} soul, from axiological merit in a frugal ascetic life to that of a hedonistic life, from a belief in rebirth <b>to</b> <b>asserting</b> that there is no rebirth.|$|R

5|$|A {{tradition}} {{going back}} at least to Menander (Fr. 258 K) suggested that Sappho killed herself by jumping off the Leucadian cliffs for love of Phaon, a ferryman. This is regarded as unhistorical by modern scholars, perhaps invented by the comic poets or originating from a misreading of a first-person reference in a non-biographical poem. The legend may have resulted in part from a desire <b>to</b> <b>assert</b> Sappho as heterosexual.|$|E
5|$|During that period, the Byzantines were {{generally}} on the defensive, and suffered some catastrophic defeats {{such as the}} razing of Amorium, the home city of the reigning Byzantine dynasty, in 838. Nevertheless, with the waning of the Abbasid Caliphate's power after 842 {{and the rise of}} semi-independent emirates along the Byzantine eastern frontier, the Byzantines were increasingly able <b>to</b> <b>assert</b> their own power.|$|E

50|$|Years {{later in}} 2009, court ruled against Prosinečki, mostly due <b>to</b> <b>asserting</b> that the lawsuit against Dinamo had no merit since Prosinečki played for Croatia Zagreb, and not Dinamo Zagreb.

5|$|In 1886 {{the queen}} {{attempted}} to solicit {{the support of}} the United States in preserving Madagascar's sovereignty by sending gifts to then-President Grover Cleveland, including silk akotofahana cloths, an ivory pin and a woven basket.

Ranavalona signed a treaty granting further concessions to the French on December 12, 1887.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} this period that the Soviets started <b>to</b> <b>assert</b> {{themselves}} in several new theaters of action, in particular through Cuban proxies during the Angolan Civil War starting in 1975 and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. U.S. strategy to this point had been focused on containing Communism and preparation for war in Europe. The new Soviet actions revealed that the military lacked capability outside these narrow confines.|$|E

2500|$|According to the {{redundancy}} {{theory of}} truth, asserting that a statement is true is completely equivalent <b>to</b> <b>asserting</b> the statement itself. [...] For example, making {{the assertion that}} [...] "'Snow is white' is true" [...] is equivalent <b>to</b> <b>asserting</b> [...] "Snow is white". [...] Redundancy theorists infer from this premise that truth is a redundant concept; that is, it is merely a word that is traditionally used in conversation or writing, generally for emphasis, but not a word that actually equates to anything in reality. [...] This theory is commonly attributed to Frank P. Ramsey, who held {{that the use of}} words like fact and truth was nothing but a roundabout way of asserting a proposition, and that treating these words as separate problems in isolation from judgment was merely a [...] "linguistic muddle".|$|R

5|$|The size of {{a market}} assumes primary {{importance}} {{in the study of}} what induces investment in a country. Ragnar Nurkse referenced the work of Allyn A.

5|$|There {{has been}} {{criticism}} {{from a number}} of people that the highly fragmented DG structure wastes a considerable amount of time in s as the different departments and Commissioners compete with each other.

In 1898, during the Klondike Gold Rush in the Northwest Territories, parliament created the Yukon Territory. Alberta and Saskatchewan became provinces in 1905.|$|E
5|$|Upon his release, Allen {{returned}} to the Grants, which had declared independence in 1777, and resumed political activity in the territory.

5|$|With urbanisation, {{distinctive}} urban accents {{have arisen}} which often differ greatly from the historical accents {{of the surrounding}} rural areas and sometimes share features with Southern English accents. Northern English dialects remain {{an important part of}} the culture of the region, and the desire of speakers <b>to</b> <b>assert</b> their local identity has led to accents such as Scouse and Geordie becoming more distinctive and spreading into surrounding areas.|$|E
50|$|It is {{debated whether}} {{implicit}} attitudes (that is, attitudes people have without being consciously aware of them) belong {{under the category}} of implicit memory or if this merely involves a pragmatic approach <b>to</b> <b>asserting</b> knowledge.

5|$|A son of King Harald Hardrada, Magnus was in 1058 {{appointed}} nominal {{leader of}} an expedition into the Irish Sea while still only a child.

He later accompanied his father in Harald's campaign against Denmark in 1062, and was appointed regent and made king before Harald's fatal invasion of England in 1066. Magnus briefly ruled Norway alone thereafter, until his younger brother Olaf returned from England in 1067.|$|E
5|$|After Yugoslavia's leader Josip Broz Tito died in 1980, long-suppressed ethnic {{nationalism}} revived and {{the individual}} republics began <b>to</b> <b>assert</b> their authority more strongly {{as the federal government}} weakened. Slovenia and Croatia moved towards multi-party democracy and economic reform, but Serbia's authoritarian communist President Slobodan Milošević opposed reform and sought to increase the power of the communist Yugoslav government. In 1990, Slovenia and Croatia held elections that ended communist rule and brought pro-independence nationalist parties to power in both republics. In Croatia, the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) party of Franjo Tuđman took office, with Tuđman as President.|$|E
