These data are, to date, neither organised nor correlated to the proximal stratigraphic and chronological records.

Section 3 explains the proposed harmonic retrieval algorithm with multidimensional folding for extracting the code, <b>timing</b> offset, <b>and</b> <b>frequency</b> offset of active RSSs. In addition, the proposed two-dimensional code design and code detection/evaluation methodology is described. In Section 4, the statistical characteristics of the proposed algorithm, which utilizes IMDF method, is derived to show the identifiability for the number of resolvable RSSs and to confirm the acquisition range of the proposed algorithms on the <b>timing</b> offset <b>and</b> <b>frequency</b> offset. Section 5 evaluates the performance of the proposed method and investigates the comparison with the existing algorithms. Section 6 presents our conclusion.|$|R

50|$|Dr. Feng’s work {{applies the}} neuroethology of frog {{communication}} to medicine. A recent project on hearing aids {{is based on}} how female frogs find their mates. Females must recognize the male they choose by his call. By localizing where his call is coming from she can find him. An additional challenge {{is that she is}} localizing his call while listening to the many other frogs in the chorus, and to the noise of the stream and insects. The breeding pond is a very noisy place, and females must distinguish a male’s calls from the other noise. How they recognize the sound pattern of the male they are pursuing from the surrounding noise is similar to how intelligent hearing aids help people hear certain sounds and cancel out others. The underlying neural mechanisms are fast neural oscillations, and synaptic inhibition to cancel out noise. The <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> <b>frequency</b> of the sound also play a part in frog communication and may be used in Feng’s work. He also studies bat echolocation to create intelligent hearing aids.

5000|$|The {{church has}} always sought to {{assemble}} as many bishops {{as possible for}} the election and consecration of new bishops.

[...] Consecrations by the Pope were exempt from the three bishop requirement. The reason for the three bishop requirement was stated by St. Isidore: [...] "custom that a bishop should not be ordained by one bishop, but by all the comprovincial bishops, is known to have been instituted on account of heresies, and in order that the tyrannical authority of one person should not attempt anything contrary to the faith of the Church." ...|$|E

50|$|Natural {{fertility}} is {{a concept}} developed by the French historical demographer Louis Henry {{to refer to the}} level of fertility that would prevail in a population that makes no conscious effort to limit, regulate, or control fertility, so that fertility depends only on physiological factors affecting fecundity. In contrast, populations that practice birth control will have lower fertility levels as a result of delaying first births (a lengthened interval between menarche and first pregnancy), extended intervals between births, or stopping child-bearing at a certain age. Such control does not assume the use of artificial means of fertility regulation or modern contraceptive methods but can result from the use of traditional means of contraception or pregnancy prevention (e.g., coitus interruptus). Many social norms or practices effect fertility regulation including celibacy, the age at marriage and the <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> <b>frequency</b> of sexual intercourse, including periods of prescribed sexual abstinence. Breastfeeding has also been used to space births in areas without birth control. Ansley Coale and other demographers have developed several methods for measuring the extent of such fertility control, in which the idea of a natural level of fertility is an essential component.|$|E
50|$|The Global Positioning System (GPS) {{operated}} by the US Air Force Space Command provides very accurate <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> <b>frequency</b> signals. A GPS receiver works by measuring the relative time delay of signals from a minimum of four, but usually more, GPS satellites, {{each of which has}} at least two onboard caesium and as many as two rubidium atomic clocks. The relative times are mathematically transformed into three absolute spatial coordinates and one absolute time coordinate.GPS Time (GPST) is a continuous time scale and theoretically accurate to about 14 ns. However, most receivers lose accuracy in the interpretation of the signals and are only accurate to 100 ns.The GPST is related to but differs from TAI (International Atomic Time) and UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). GPST remains at a constant offset with TAI (TAI - GPST = 19 seconds) and like TAI does not implement leap seconds. Periodic corrections are performed to the on-board clocks in the satellites to keep them synchronized with ground clocks. The GPS navigation message includes the difference between GPST and UTC. As of July 2015, GPST is 17 seconds ahead of UTC because of the leap second added to UTC on 30 June 2015. Receivers subtract this offset from GPS Time to calculate UTC and specific timezone values.|$|E

The effectiveness of our proposed synchronization method and optimization criteria are confirmed by computer simulation results. I...|$|R
