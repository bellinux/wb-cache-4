5|$|During the party, Tony Yayo enters {{another room}} of the mansion and removes a {{painting}} {{from one of the}} walls, revealing a hidden safe: after opening it and removing a silver necklace, a woman (Buffie Carruth) who has followed him from the party enters <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> pair begin to embrace. At this point, the police suddenly enter the room, searching for Tony Yayo, although it is shown that he has escaped just in time through an open door in the room. Reunited in the Mercedes-Benz with 50 Cent, Tony Yayo gives the necklace to 50 Cent: at this point, Tony Yayo abruptly wakes up, in his jail cell, showing the preceding events of the video to have been a dream.|$|E
5|$|The {{two people}} fencing {{take off their}} masks, which reveal them to be Madonna and her doppelgänger {{surprised}} to see each other; they resume their violent fighting. The black Madonna slices across the white Madonna's stomach, which is mirrored in the imprisoned Madonna's stomach in the chamber. She rides on a hanging chain from the ceiling and smashes a mirror across the wall. The black Madonna breaks open a dark room by throwing the white Madonna against the wall. Different artifacts from the Bond films are present in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> two Madonna's fight through them. Meanwhile, the Madonna in the torture chamber wears phylacteries around her arm while hiding behind an electric chair.|$|E

5|$|Everyone sits in silence, {{waiting for}} Parsons's manager to arrive. Jan {{suggests}} that Graham blow up another balloon for Tamsin. Sally, Si and Graham realise that, {{with the camera}} footage they have, they can blow up all the purple balloons and sell them to multiple bidders. Jan screams when she sees movement in Tamsin's bedroom, and it is realised that Frankie is still alive. Jan takes Tamsin out of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> remaining three agree, after panicked discussion, that they should kill Frankie. Si loses a coin toss and smothers Frankie with a cushion. Later, out on the street, Frankie's body is put into an ambulance. Si says to Sally and Graham {{that he will be}} in touch and leaves. Sally and Graham discuss selling the camcorder footage, and Jan runs inside to see that Tamsin is not in her chair or room. Upstairs, Tamsin crawls onto the bed containing the balloon, carrying a heart-shaped helium balloon. On the street, Sally, Graham and Jan see Tamsin opening the upstairs window. She releases the helium balloon with the balloon containing Frankie's breath attached. The two float skyward as Graham films.|$|E
5|$|A {{pastiche}} {{of following}} scenes alternates between Spears {{dancing on the}} soundstage, singing with the microphones and a scene of just red lips, {{a reference to the}} opening shot of the 1975 film The Rocky Horror Picture Show. This begins to show her losing grip, reminiscent of her break down. When the breakdown starts, she begins to eject painting through IVs in her fingers, staining <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> monitors, symbolizing her own fall as her name becomes tainted. Then, two versions of Spears, both wearing blue and red dresses with flowing trains, are seen fighting each other, another symbolism, this time of her fighting her inner demons. After this, both versions of Spears, as well as her on the wedding dress, fall exhausted to the ground, symbolizing the lowest point of her life during the breakdown. While interspersed scenes of Spears in the soundstage are shown, the other versions of herself start to wake up, showing her getting her feet back on the ground and making a comeback, refusing to give up. The final scene shows Spears dressed in a short black dress with her dancers in black on a stage, with confetti and pyrotechnics around them. In the final shot a question mark (?) appears in multicolored letters. This final scene shows her as she once was, a superstar who is back to reclaim her title. The video ends with the same multicolored lettering of a question mark, symbolizing the unknown that is to come.|$|E

25|$|UV {{has also}} been shown to reduce gaseous {{contaminants}} such as carbon monoxide and VOCs. UV lamps radiating at 184 and 254nm can remove low concentrations of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide if the air is recycled between <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lamp chamber. This arrangement prevents the introduction of ozone into the treated air. Likewise, air may be treated by passing by a single UV source operating at 184nm and passed over iron pentaoxide to remove the ozone produced by the UV lamp.|$|E

25|$|After breakfast, the Prince, {{accompanied}} by the playful Bendicò, goes into his office, which is lined with century-old paintings of the Salina family's estates. As he sits at his cluttered desk, the Prince recalls how much he dislikes both <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> work it represents. This dislike intensifies during visits from his accountant {{and one of his}} tenants, both of whom are allied with the Redshirts. Both of them assure the Prince that the unification of Italy will be peaceful and will benefit everyone, including the nobility. The Prince allows himself to be reassured, certain that the class system will remain unchanged no matter what. The Prince's visit to the Salina chaplain, Father Pirrone, atop a tower where the men practice their joint hobby of astronomy, reinforces this belief.|$|E

25|$|After a few days, Jim Olive's {{business}} partner became {{concerned about his}} absence from work and contacted police, who visited the Olive house and spoke with Marlene Olive. She provided various alibis for herself and Riley, which the police later determined were false, and stories about her parents having either disappeared or died, claiming that one parent had killed the other and then disappeared with the body or that both parents were killed by Hells Angels. Police also noted the recently cleaned room in the otherwise disordered house. The friend who had helped clean informed the police about the blood in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> couple's statements about killing the Olives and burning their bodies. Acting either on information from Marlene Olive or from her friend, police searched the China Camp barbecue pit and determined that it contained fragments of burnt human remains.

25|$|Their first-round match-up with Cleveland {{was widely}} seen as the most evenly matched series in the 2006 NBA Playoffs. The teams {{exchanged}} wins {{during the first two}} games in Cleveland, with Game 2 highlighted by the Wizards holding LeBron James to 7–25 shooting from the floor while Brendan Haywood gave James a hard foul in the first quarter that many cited as the key to shaking up the rest of James's game. In Game 3 at the Verizon Center, James hit a 4-footer on the way down with 5.7 seconds left to take the game and the series lead for the Cavs with a 97–96 win. Arenas missed a potential game-winning three-pointer on the other end to seal the win for the Cavs. Game 4 saw the Wizards heat up again, as Arenas scored 20 in the fourth quarter after claiming he changed his jersey, shorts, shoes and tights in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Wizards won 106–96. Yet in Games 5 and 6, the Cavs would take control of the series, both games decided by one point in overtime.|$|E
25|$|The {{powerful}} Duke of Westmorland {{learns that}} the gallant young soldier Edward {{is in love}} with his daughter, Albina, who is a young widow to Count Raimond. Despite her love for Edward, Albina's virtue impedes her from agreeing to marry him. Westmorland and Edward persuade her to remarry because Edward is soon destined to go off to war; she agrees. Editha, who is jealous of Albina, seeks help from Lord Gondibert, Raimond's brother, who secretly loves Albina. On the eve of the wedding, Gondibert tells Edward that Albina has been unfaithful, and to prove it he disguises himself and allows Edward to spy on him sneaking into Albina's chamber at night. Edward then calls off the wedding, and the furious Westmorland challenges him to a duel to protect Albina's honour. Before the duel begins, Gondibert's elderly servant, Egbert, exposes his master's lie, and the king banishes Gondibert. Before he leaves, Gondibert vows to kill Albina and then commit suicide. He sneaks into Albina's chamber and stabs a woman he thinks is Albina, and then he stabs himself. But the woman {{turns out to be a}} disguised Editha, who had also stolen into the room. Edward is relieved when the real Albina rushes into <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> dying Gondibert asks for and receives her pardon.|$|E
