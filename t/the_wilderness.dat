5|$|Marshall died {{of heart}} failure {{at the age of}} 38 in 1939. Twenty-five years later, {{partly as a result of}} his efforts, <b>The</b> <b>Wilderness</b> Society helped gain passage of <b>the</b> <b>Wilderness</b> Act. The Act was passed by Congress in 1964 and legally defined {{wilderness}} areas of the United States and protected some nine million acres (36,000km2) of federal land. Today, Marshall is considered largely responsible for <b>the</b> <b>wilderness</b> preservation movement. Several areas and landmarks, including The Bob Marshall Wilderness in Montana and Mount Marshall in the Adirondacks, have been named in his honor.|$|E
5|$|Recreational {{activities}} {{permitted by}} the Forest Service at <b>the</b> <b>Wilderness</b> include day hiking, horse riding, and backpacking.

5|$|Since its founding, <b>The</b> <b>Wilderness</b> Society {{has helped}} pass many bills for {{preservation}} and conservation of public lands. It has also purchased lands for preservation, contributing {{a total of}} 109millionacres (421,000km2) to the National Wilderness Preservation System. Marshall's dream of permanent wilderness protection became a reality 25years after his death when President Lyndon B. Johnson signed <b>the</b> <b>Wilderness</b> Act into law on September 3, 1964 in the Rose Garden of the White House. The ceremony was attended by Alice Zahniser and Mardy Murie, the widows of two prominent members of <b>The</b> <b>Wilderness</b> Society.|$|E

5|$|Backcountry hiking is {{available}} in the Craters of the Moon Wilderness and the much larger Backcountry Area beyond (added in 2000). Only two trails enter <b>the</b> <b>wilderness</b> area and even those stop after a few miles or kilometers. From there most hikers follow the Great Rift and explore its series of seldom-visited volcanic features. All overnight backcountry hikes require registration with a ranger. No drinking water {{is available}} in the backcountry and the dry climate quickly dehydrates hikers. Avoiding summer heat and winter cold are therefore recommended by rangers. Pets, camp fires, and all mechanized vehicles, including bicycles, are not allowed in <b>the</b> <b>wilderness</b> area.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Wilderness</b> Act of 1964 {{enhanced}} the protection status of remote and/or undeveloped land already contained within federally administered protected areas.

The only manner in which people can enter wilderness areas is either on foot or horseback. Hunting and fishing are permitted in <b>the</b> <b>wilderness,</b> {{just as they are}} throughout the forest, provided those engaging in such activities have the proper licenses and permits.|$|E
