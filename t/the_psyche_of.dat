[...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely negative review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four.

The town draws upon <b>the</b> <b>psyche</b> <b>of</b> its visitors and ultimately forms alternative versions of the town, which differ depending on the character. The concept behind the town was [...] "a small, rural town in America"; to make the setting more realistic, some buildings and rooms lack furnishings.|$|E
500|$|Austen's plots {{highlight}} women's traditional {{dependence on}} marriage to secure social standing and economic security. As an art form, the 18th-century novel lacked {{the seriousness of}} its equivalents from the 19th century, when novels were treated as [...] "the natural vehicle for discussion and ventilation of what mattered in life". [...] Rather than delving too deeply into <b>the</b> <b>psyche</b> <b>of</b> her characters, Austen enjoys them and imbues them with humour, according to critic John Bayley. He believes that the well-spring of her wit and irony is her own attitude that comedy [...] "is the saving grace of life". Part of Austen's fame rests on the historical and literary significance {{that she was the}} first woman to write great comic novels. Samuel Johnson's influence is evident, in that she follows his advice to write [...] "a representation of life as may excite mirth".|$|E

500|$|All {{the costumes}} {{in the film}} were {{designed}} by Mona May, who had previously worked on Clueless, The Wedding Singer, and The Haunted Mansion. To create the costumes, May spent one year in pre-production working with animators and her costume department of 20 people, while she contracted with five outside costume shops in Los Angeles and New York City. She {{became involved in the}} project during the time when the animators are designing the faces and bodies of the characters as they had to [...] "translate the costumes from two-dimensional drawings to live-action human proportion". Her goal was to keep the designs [...] "Disneyesque to the core but bring a little bit of fashion in there and humor and make it something new". However, May admitted this was difficult [...] "because they're dealing with iconic Disney characters who have been in <b>the</b> <b>psyche</b> <b>of</b> the viewing audience for so long".|$|E
500|$|By {{the mid-1960s}} {{numerous}} garage bands began to employ tone-altering {{devices such as}} [...] on guitars often {{for the purpose of}} enhancing the music's sonic palate and adding an aggressive edge, using loudly amplified instruments to create a barrage of [...] "clanging" [...] sounds, often expressing anger, defiance, and sexual frustration. [...] A sense of despondency and restlessness entered <b>the</b> <b>psyche</b> <b>of</b> the youth in the United States and elsewhere, with a growing rise of tension and alienation creeping into the collective mindset—even in the largely conservative suburban communities which produced so many garage bands. [...] The garage bands, though generally apolitical, nonetheless reflected the tenor of the times. [...] Nightly news reports had a cumulative effect on the mass consciousness, including musicians. [...] Detectable in much of the music from this era is a combination of disparate emotions, particularly in light of President Kennedy's assassination and the ongoing escalation of troops sent to Vietnam, yet displaying what some now view as a bygone innocence.|$|E

500|$|Amongst {{individual}} Australian soldiers, {{the news}} of the victory helped to dispel some of the notions about the invincibility of the Japanese soldier that had developed in <b>the</b> <b>psyche</b> <b>of</b> Allied soldiers following the defeats of early 1942, and which had impacted on Allied planning up to that point. Some of these notions would remain {{until the end of the}} war, but {{the news of}} Milne Bay allowed some soldiers to rationalise the Japanese soldiers' past victories as being the result of tangible factors, such as numerical superiority, that could be overcome, rather than innate factors associated with the intangible qualities of the Japanese soldier that were not so easily overcome. After this, amongst the Allies there was [...] "a sense that fortune's wheel was turning", and although leaders such as Blamey emphasised the difficulties that lay ahead, a feeling of confidence in eventual victory emerged. MacArthur warned the War Department that success was attributable to good intelligence that allowed him to concentrate a superior force at Milne Bay, and might not be repeatable.|$|E
500|$|On the {{critical}} side, The Daily Telegraphs Jenny McCartney dismissed the metaphors {{in the chorus}} and thought the song's topic was over-hyped.

In an NPR article, the writer Maura Johnston commented that the lyrics portray Rihanna as the subject of Eminem's violence. Jay Smooth, a New York radio personality, responded that [...] "while Eminem explores <b>the</b> <b>psyche</b> <b>of</b> the abuser with an almost disturbing amount of depth and detail," [...] Rihanna's perspective is downplayed and not explained fully. Johnston and Smooth wrote that such imbalances are a prevalent issue in popular music duets. To Sady Doyle, although [...] "Love the Way You Lie" [...] is one of Eminem's most affecting tracks and finds him remorseful, {{it does not make}} up for his past misogynistic actions and hateful songs.

500|$|A central {{concept for}} the series is the Collective Unconscious, a place {{generated}} by the hearts of humanity and from which Personas are born. According to the official Persona Club P3 book, the Collective Unconscious was generated by the primitive life on Earth {{as a means of}} containing the spiritual essence of Nyx, a space-born being whose presence would cause the death of all life on Earth. Her body was damaged by the impact and became the moon, while her psyche was left on the surface and locked away {{at the heart of the}} Collective Unconscious. The fragments of Nyx's psyche, known as [...] "Shadows", are both a threat and a crucial part of humanity's existence. To further help defend against hostile Shadows, people generated the deities that exist within the Collective Unconscious, many of which manifest as Personas. Nyx appears in Persona 3 as the antagonist. The major dungeon locations in each game (such as Tartarus in Persona 3 and the Palace in Persona 5) are generated by the latent wishes or anxieties of humans, and are generally used by another force for their own ends. A recurring location is the Velvet Room, a place between reality and unconsciousness created by Philemon that changes form depending on <b>the</b> <b>psyche</b> <b>of</b> its current guest. Its inhabitants, especially an enigmatic old man called Igor, aid the main characters by helping them hone their Persona abilities.|$|E
