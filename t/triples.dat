Jericho threw the referee into the cell wall, causing the referee to bleed. <b>Triple</b> H performed a spinebuster on Jericho as referees opened the cell door {{to check on the}} downed referee. <b>Triple</b> H hit Jericho with a sledgehammer and pinned Jericho, but the referee was still down. Mike Chioda replaced the referee. <b>Triple</b> H and Jericho fought outside the cell, where <b>Triple</b> H performed a DDT through a broadcast table on Jericho. <b>Triple</b> H retrieved a 2X4 wrapped in barbed wire, but Jericho climbed the cell, leading to <b>Triple</b> H and the referee climbing the cell. Jericho hit <b>Triple</b> H with the 2X4 and applied the Walls of Jericho on <b>Triple</b> H atop the Cell, but <b>Triple</b> H hit Jericho with the 2X4, forcing Jericho to release the hold. Jericho attempted to hit <b>Triple</b> H with the 2X4, but <b>Triple</b> H performed a low blow on him and attempted a Pedigree, which Jericho countered into a back body drop. <b>Triple</b> H hit Jericho with the 2X4 and pinned him after a Pedigree atop the cell to win the match.|$|R

50|$|Another {{predominant}} rivalry {{heading into}} the event was between <b>Triple</b> H and Kurt Angle. At SummerSlam, The Rock defeated <b>Triple</b> H and Angle in a <b>Triple</b> Threat match to retain the WWF Championship after Angle received a concussion {{at the hands of}} <b>Triple</b> H. Angle had started taking a liking to <b>Triple</b> H's on-screen wife, Stephanie McMahon which made <b>Triple</b> H, jealous of Angle. On the August 28 episode of Raw is War, Angle interfered in a match between Eddie Guerrero and <b>Triple</b> H by attacking both men with a chair. Guerrero's valet and <b>Triple</b> H's former on-screen girlfriend, the WWF Intercontinental Champion Chyna checked on both men and hugged <b>Triple</b> H. On the August 31 episode of SmackDown!, Angle showed McMahon, a video of <b>Triple</b> H and Chyna hugging each other to create differences between <b>Triple</b> H and McMahon. Later that night, <b>Triple</b> H was arrested by police officers before his scheduled match against Guerrero and Angle.

On the September 11 episode of Raw is War, Angle interfered in <b>Triple</b> H's match with Chris Jericho and distracted <b>Triple</b> H, causing <b>Triple</b> H to leave the ring and chase Angle. Later that night, Angle attacked both <b>Triple</b> H and McMahon after his Handicap match against T & A (Test and Albert).
