One of the men who found the remains said he saw a large bucket in the woods, which he upturned. Details of the contents have not been released. He then spotted Bobo's remains spread on the ground behind him. Investigators recovered her skull, teeth, several ribs, and one shoulder blade. Her skull had a bullet hole in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> on the right with the trajectory going left, fracturing her left cheek bone when it exited.|$|E
25|$|The main {{facade of}} the monastery complex is to the west, with <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> facing the main plaza and {{municipal}} palace of the town. The town clock is visible from the main plaza; the clock was placed {{on one of the}} monastery’s back towers by Father Evaristo Nava in the early 20th century. The main plaza is sometimes called the Plaza de Tributación, referring to its pre-Hispanic and early colonial period function as a place to collect tribute such as crops and handcrafted items from the area which is now eastern Morelos state. During the early colonial period, this plaza was part of the monastery complex and continued its tribute collecting function. (forteleza) While the San Juan Bautista Church dominates both the town of Yecapixtla as well as the surrounding municipality, {{there are a number of}} other churches such as San Sebastián Mártir, Santiago Apóstol, de la Virgen de Guadalupe, Santo Tomás Apóstol, San Agustín, Nuestro Padre Jesús, Santa Lucía, San Nicolás, San Miguel, Los Reyes, San Marcos, La Santa Cruz, San Pablo, Santa Mónica, La Inmaculada Concepción, Santa Cruz Ecatepec and San Francisco Calapa.|$|E

500|$|In February 1881, Carroll {{contacted}} his publisher {{about the}} possibility of creating The Nursery [...] "Alice", a simplified edition of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland with coloured and enlarged illustrations. Tenniel coloured twenty illustrations from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, in addition to revising some aspects of them; Alice is depicted as a blonde, and her dress is yellow, with blue stockings. Her dress became pleated with a bow at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> and she wore a bow in her hair. Edmund Evans printed the illustrations in colour through [...] chromoxylography, a process using woodblocks to produce colour prints.|$|E
500|$|At the hospital, Brian {{has been}} taken by two orderlies {{under the control of}} a young girl with a cube. Rory follows them to the lift and {{discover}}s <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> masks a portal to a ship in Earth's orbit. The Doctor and Amy arrive, discover the girl, find she is an android, and disable her. They discover the portal, and join Rory as he frees Brian. The Doctor is confronted by a hologram of a Shakri, who, according to Gallifreyan legend, were self-appointed [...] "pest controllers" [...] in the universe. The Shakri released the cubes to Earth to wipe out humanity and prepare to send out more, but the Doctor reverses the cubes' function, sending a signal that brings those harmed back to life. Feedback from this causes the ship to explode, though the four escape safely.|$|E

500|$|In another instance, a scene {{called for}} Garland {{to exit the}} saloon, jump on a horse, and ride out of town. When the scene was shot, Garland jumped over the horse instead of on it, so the scene had to be shot again. During the second take, she twisted her ankle running down the stairs in the saloon, but {{continued}} the scene. When Garland returned home, {{she thought it would}} feel good to put her ankle in a warm bath and did. She left it there for about an hour, but when she took it out, she found that it had swollen to twice its normal size. When she returned to the set, Corman said, [...] "Well, we have to start shooting." [...] In order to fit her ankle into her boot, the crew cut <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> and taped it to her foot. Garland was unable to walk for nearly a week after Gunslinger finished shooting, writing that [...] "I had screwed up my ankle so bad!" ...|$|E
500|$|Inside the {{underground}} {{part of the}} Orchid station, Ben puts every metal item he can find into a small compartment {{at the back of}} the room, while Locke watches the orientation video for the Orchid. On the tape, Pierre Chang (François Chau) begins to discuss time travel involving [...] "negatively charged exotic matter" [...] when the VCR malfunctions and the tape rewinds itself. Shortly, Keamy arrives and tells Locke that if he (Keamy) dies, the C4 on the freighter will detonate, due to a remote trigger linked to a heart rate monitor he is wearing. Regardless, Ben kills Keamy with no remorse or sympathy for those on the boat, in order to avenge his adopted daughter Alex (Tania Raymonde), whom Keamy executed. Ben seals and then activates power to the compartment he had loaded with metal items, blowing a hole in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Ben, now wearing a parka, tells Locke that whoever moves the island is forced to leave it and never come back; Ben must do it so that Locke can stay and lead the Others. Locke then goes to the Others, who welcome him home. Ben climbs through the hole and down a rocky tunnel beyond it into a frozen chamber, cutting his arm in the process. [...] He then turns a very large metal wheel. As he completes the rotation, an eerie sound and white-yellow light soon envelop the entire island. Ben disappears, only to reappear several months later in the Sahara Desert (as seen in [...] "The Shape of Things to Come").|$|E
500|$|Whereas its pre-evolutions Charmander and Charmeleon are ground-bound lizard like creatures, Charizard {{resembles a}} large {{traditional}} European dragon. Despite the resemblance, Charizard is explicitly a Fire/Flying-type, not a Dragon-type, except in its [...] "Mega Charizard X" [...] form; however, it can learn Dragon-type attacks. Charizards have two wings that are teal, while <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is orange, {{as with the}} most of its body. Its belly and soles are cream-colored, while their eyes are light blue in color. The video games describe Charizard as having wings that can carry them close to an altitude of 4,600feet, flying proudly around the sky and constantly seeking for powerful opponents to quarrel with. They can breathe intense flames that can melt any material, but will never torch a weaker foe. If Charizard become angry, the flame {{at the tip of}} their tail can flare up in a whitish-blue color. Because of their reckless behavior, Charizard are known to unintentionally cause wildfires. When Charizard is Mega Evolved, it can take on one of two forms. In its [...] "X" [...] form, it gains the Dragon type, and its color scheme changes from orange and cream to black and blue. In its [...] "Y" [...] form, its appearance gets sharper with pointed horns and wings, and it is able to fly much higher. In the episode [...] "Charmander - The Stray Pokémon" [...] in which is the episode where Ash catches- or rather - befriends Charmander it is learnt that a Charmander or any of its evolutions die if their tail fire goes out.|$|E

2500|$|I think Walter is {{a writer}} at heart. Writers aren't always that good at {{communicating}} in person. He's also a tough son-of-a-bitch. He's like a cowboy. His director's chair was made out of leather and on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> read [...] "Lone Wolf". [...] He used to frequent gun clubs and he wasn't a very delicate guy.... We were doing a love scene. When they said, [...] "We need to ADR the love scene." [...] I really freaked out. I had never done a love scene before... I really needed help to get through it. I panicked, and the Producer... Joel Silver, called Walter and somehow persuaded him {{to come over and}} direct me through the ADR. Streets of Fire was a big picture for me, and I was overwhelmed. I think that bothered Walter. I think he thought that I was a needy guy. He was used to working with actors who had experience like Nick Nolte or David Carradine. I've always wondered why Walter has never wanted to work with me again. I think he was too much of gentlemen to tell me that I was too needy at the time.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2009, Jones {{appeared}} in Unforgiven, a three-part drama on ITV1, where she plays Ruth Slater, a woman {{released from prison}} after serving a 15-year prison sentence {{for the murder of}} two policemen. Naturally brown-haired, Jones dyed her hair [...] "tobacco yellow" [...] with [...] "big roots"; Jones joked that whilst not filming she [...] "really should have worn a wig". Additionally, the character of Ruth wore no make-up throughout, with Jones stating she was left feeling [...] "quite exposed", but nonetheless saying [...] "Ruth wouldn't have worn any make-up, I don't think". Jones received favourable reviews for her portrayal, with Brian Viner of The Independent writing: [...] "a stunning performance, the stuff of Bafta nominations if ever I saw it. Heck, on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> she might even get propelled into the movies, and bring a bit of North Country sense to the Golden Globes". Viner summarised his review of Unforgiven by stating, [...] "Five stars all round, and six for Jones". Jones later stated, [...] "I loved that role. They don't come along that often. It was seen by the broadsheets as well as the tabloids. It gave me a little bit of credibility, I suppose".|$|E
2500|$|On Sunday, November 21, {{a hunting}} party of about 15 {{people were in}} a cabin on this private land. [...] Terry Willers, {{one of the two}} co-owners of the land, left the cabin and saw Vang sitting in a deer stand. He used a {{handheld}} radio to ask the people still in the cabin whether or not anyone should be in the stand. Upon receiving a response in the negative, he approached Vang and told him to leave the property. Vang then apologized and started moving south towards a trail through a forested area of the property. According to Terry Willer's testimony, [...] "As Bob got back on the radio and asked me where he was at and I said, uh, he's heading south down on the food plot right now. I radioed in to the cabin that I had a tree-rat and I had chased him off." [...] At that point five of the hunters from the cabin who had heard the radio message arrived at the tree stand. Lauren Hesebeck a surviving victim stated, [...] "Bob had said I'm going to go talk to him to find out who he is, why he's there, and make sure he doesn't, you know, knows that he's on private property and that he's not welcomed there. Denny had said to me this ought to be interesting, let's go and see what's going on. We got in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> standing up (ATV), hanging on the rear bar."After following the directions given by Willers, they proceeded to approach Vang further down the trail. Crotteau then suggested making a note of his hunting license number to make a report to the DNR and, according to Hesebeck's testimony, Crotteau [...] "flipped over the hunting tag on Vang's back to get his license number".|$|E
