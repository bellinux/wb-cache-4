Results generally indicate experience, training, age of household head, household size and social capital as the key variables that positively influence decision of farmers to adopt Cocoa Pest and Disease Control (CODAPEC) and Cocoa High-Tech <b>Technology</b> <b>packages.</b> Very old cocoa farms contribute to the non-adoption of these <b>technology</b> <b>packages</b> by the farmers...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to analyze factors influencing adoption of wheat <b>technology</b> <b>packages</b> by smallholder farmers in Gurawa, Meta and Habro districts in eastern Ethiopia. The analysis was based on a household survey data collected from 136 randomly selected households. A Two-limit Tobit model was used to elucidate factors affecting adoption of <b>technology</b> <b>packages</b> measured based on an index derived from five components of wheat technologies which included row planting, pesticide application, use of improved varieties, and application of inorganic fertilizers, namely, Diammonium Phosphate (DAP) and Urea. Among the variables included in the model, variation in district, gender, age of the household head, education status of the household head, farm size, distance to market, distance to FTC (Farmers’ Training Centers), cooperative membership, dependency ratio, and annual income of the households were found to significantly affect the adoption of wheat <b>technology</b> <b>packages.</b> Policy makers, planners and development practitioners should give due attention to these determinants to support smallholder farmers in wheat production and enhance gains derived from it...|$|R
40|$|Production {{of wheat}} by {{smallholder}} farmers in Ethiopia contributes a significant share to the agricultural {{production of the}} country. However, the actual productivity of the crop has been far below its potential. Varied levels of technology adoption are often observed among smallholder farmers producing the crop. For enhanced dissemination of <b>technology</b> <b>packages</b> and improving wheat productivity, {{it is vital to}} elucidate socio-economic factors that are behind disparity in technology adaption among smallholder farmers. Therefore, this study was conducted to analyse the socio-economic, institutional, and other pertinent variables that determine the existing disparity observed among smallholder farmers in terms of adopting wheat production <b>technology</b> <b>packages</b> in Gurawa and Meta districts of eastern Ethiopia. The study utilized survey data collected from 124 randomly selected wheat households producing wheat. For this purpose, an ordered logit model was applied. The econometric results revealed that age of the household head, membership in cooperative institutions, and household annual income significantly and positively explained the disparity observed in adoption of wheat production <b>technology</b> <b>packages.</b> Conversely, gender of household head (sex), farming experiences, number of plots owned, and frequency of contacts with extension agents explained the disparity significantly, but negatively. It could be concluded that development practitioners, planners, and policy makers should give due considerations to the aforementioned socio-economic and institutional factors when designing dissemination of wheat production <b>technology</b> <b>packages</b> for adoption by farmers...|$|R
