She shared Fry's zeal for architectural and social modernisation, and they became professional as well as personal partners, establishing Fry, Drew and Partners, which existed from 1946 to 1973. Their first work together was for the British government in its West African colonies. In 1944 Fry was appointed town planning adviser to Lord Swinton, the resident minister of British West Africa; Drew was engaged as Fry's assistant. Their official postings continued until 1946, when Fry and Drew set up in private practice. Although based in London, most of their work {{for the next few years}} continued to be in west Africa for the British colonial authorities. The Frys opened an office in Ghana (then known as the Gold Coast) and worked there and in Nigeria, primarily on educational establishments, and often in <b>temporary</b> <b>partnership</b> with other British architects.

In the secondary story, Mongul frees himself of Mother Mercy's vines after being imprisoned in Green Lantern Corps vol. 2, issue #26 (September 2008). Ravenous after his imprisonment, he destroys a space craft belonging to newlyweds Kered and Miri Riam (on their way to their honeymoon) in order to ransack it for food. Kered approaches Mongul to ask him to spare their jet packs and enough food for them to find help. In response, Mongul cracks the face plate of Kered's pressure suit, killing him. After Mongul leaves, Miri drifts in space alone for two days before deciding to kill herself out of grief. Before she is able to complete her suicide, a violet power ring finds her and offers to fill the hole in her heart with violet light. Miri accepts and becomes the first new recruit to the Star Sapphires. Miri quickly finds herself fighting for love as she assists a group of Green Lanterns attempting to apprehend Sinestro Corps member: Kryb. Through their <b>temporary</b> <b>partnership</b> they are able to defeat the yellow ring wielder. Though an argument ensues between Miri and Kyle Rayner (one of the Green Lanterns involved in the incident) over whether Kryb should be sent to Oa or Zamaron for detainment, it's agreed that Miri will escort Kryb back to Zamaron for reconditioning and re-education.|$|E

40|$|Owing to {{advances}} in digital technology, emerging breakthrough solutions responding to market needs {{are becoming increasingly}} innovative and complex. Large amount of resources, competencies, skills, etc. are required to accomplish such solutions, usually beyond the capabilities and capacities of a single organization. The emergence of co-innovation networks as breeding environments for creation of <b>temporary</b> <b>partnerships</b> has enhanced the possibility of success for organizations and facilitating their collaborations. One obstacle to configuration of such partnerships as well as collaboration has been the difficulty in assessing the trust level of potential partners. So far, trust level assessment has been performed manually by organizations and in ad hoc manners, which is both time consuming and hardly produces accurate results. Consequently, formation of collaborative initiatives has become more challenging and organizations are reluctant to work with each other. This paper addresses the supervised automation of the assessment of trust level of organizations in co-innovation networks.

40|$|ABSTRACT Throughout {{the world}} {{there has been}} an {{increased}} attention for international large-scale sports events, but there is still little knowledge of how they operate. The particular relationship as well as the organizational structure and coordination between organizers within large-scale events have not been studied to a large extent. Since large-scale events are truly international, the involved stakeholders operate across borders, which further adds a dimension to the relationship. Due to the often temporary aspect of international large-scale events and thus their diverse network of <b>temporary</b> <b>partnerships,</b> they are seen as highly complex. They are becoming more prevalent and {{there is a need for}} deeper exploration as they have attracted little attention in research and specifically misses out on cases on meaningful relations in terms of collaboration and coordination. Therefore, this study aims to explore the relationship between international and national stakeholders towards the successful hosting and managing of a temporary international large-scale event. It intends, in greater depth, to understand the complex nature of international large-scale sports events in regards to challenges and meaningful collaboration and coordination. Interviews with 14 respondents and a participant observation of the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships in Falun 2015 constitute the basis for this thesis. The main conclusion of this study implies that even though the relationship is structured in accordance to the hosting contract, trust appears to be a necessity and of critical importance as it facilitated the collaboration and coordination in the relationship. The stakeholders moreover highlighted the relationship as a partnership...|$|R

2500|$|In late 1965, Wilson {{began working}} on {{material}} for a new project, Pet Sounds. He formed a <b>temporary</b> songwriting <b>partnership</b> with lyricist Tony Asher, who was suggested to Wilson by mutual friend Daro. Wilson, who had recorded the album's instrumentation with the Wrecking Crew, then assembled the Beach Boys to record vocal overdubs, following their return from a tour of Japan. Upon hearing what Wilson had created {{for the first time}} in 1965, the group, particularly Mike Love, was somewhat critical of their leader's music, and expressed their dissatisfaction. At this time, Wilson still had considerable control within the group and, according to Wilson, they eventually overcame their initial negative reaction, as his newly created music began to near completion. The album was released May 16, 1966, and, despite modest sales figures at the time, has since become widely critically acclaimed, often being cited among the all-time greatest albums. Although the record was issued under the group's name, Pet Sounds is arguably seen as a Brian Wilson solo album. Wilson even toyed with the idea by releasing [...] "Caroline, No" [...] as a solo single in March 1966, it reaching number 32 on the Billboard charts.|$|R

40|$|Over {{the first}} years of this century, Germany’s public {{finances}} developed very unfavourably. Significant pressures to reduce the overall budget deficit emerged. However, not least given the budgetary autonomy of the individual federal states and their influence on federal legislation, for several years central government failed to bring the German deficit ratio back below the Maastricht threshold by means of consolidation measures. Recourse to temporary measures remained limited, while Eurostat was reluctant to accept deficit-decreasing entries in the national accounts. With regard to national fiscal rules, asset sales and securitisations were used to avoid too obvious conflicts. Following the significant decrease in budget deficits experienced since the end of 2005, current European and national fiscal rules are now respected without circumventions. However, a planned tightening of national borrowing limits as well as the European aim to have a structurally balanced budgetary position might lead to a search for new sidestepping measures.

50|$|In 1678 Stockton was {{building}} ships and Yarm {{also had a}} shipbuilding activity at that time. It was between 1790 and 1805 that Thomas Haw of Stockton was a building ships for the Napoleonic wars. Shipbuilding did not begin in Middlesbrough until 1833 when a wooden sailing ship called The Middlesbro was built. Teessides first iron ship was built in Thorneby in 1854, it was a screw steamer called The Advance, and Teessides first steel ship was Little Lucy built in 1858. One famous Teesside-built ship was the 377 feet long Talpore, built by Pearse and Co of Stockton in 1860. It was a troop ship for the River Indus, and was the worlds largest river steamer at the time. An archive of the ships built on Teesside has been created, In Hartlepool Thomas Richardson of Castle Eden and John Parkin of Sunderland established a shipyard at Old Hartlepool in 1835 and built The Castle Eden ship. The shipbuilding company of William Gray was established here in 1862 and Gray {{became one of the}} most influential men in the town. He was the first mayor of West Hartlepool in 1887. William Gray shipbuilders won the Blue Ribband prize for maximum output in 1878, 1882, 1888, 1895, 1898 and 1900. The yard closed in 1961.On Tyneside, Charles Mark Palmer, born in South Shields, established a yard at Jarrow in 1851 and built its first iron collier, The John Bowes, in the following year. It was the first ever seagoing screw collier and was built for John Bowes of Barnard Castle for shipping coal to London. Palmers were also famed for building the first rolled armour plates for warships in 1854. William Smith and Co launched the 1600 ton Blenheim in 1848. W. G. Armstrong, the famous northern engineer, acquired an interest in the Tyneside shipbuilding firm of Mitchells in 1882, and the company of W. G. Armstrong, Mitchell and Co was formed. The yard built battleships as well as a ship called Gluckauf, which was arguably the worlds first oil tanker. It was launched by the yard in 1886. Scotsman Charles Mitchell started building ships at Walker-on-Tyne in 1852 and purchased a 6.5 acre (2.6 hectare) site at Wallsend in 1873 to soak up excess orders from his Walker shipyard. The new yard failed financially and was handed to his brother-in-law Charles Swan. Charles and his brother Henry were directors of the Wallsend Slipway Company, a repair yard established by Mitchell in 1871. In 1878 Charles arranged a partnership with Sunderland shipbuilder George Hunter, but in 1879 Charles died after falling overboard from a channel steamer whilst returning from the Continent with his wife.

40|$|A {{system of}} systems (SoS) is formed from {{existing}} independent component systems. Some reasons these independent systems might be combined include a merger or acquisition, a <b>temporary</b> <b>partnership,</b> {{because of the}} formation of an integrated supply chain, or if a service-oriented architecture is used. SoSs are difficult to analyze because of the scale of the integration, the components’ independent existence, and the (potentially) conflicting nature of their requirements. We propose bridging between requirements analysis and architecture of an SoS by using an interdisciplinary approach. From Software Engineering we take iterating between requirements and architecture, and from Philosophy we take structured argumentation. Iterating between requirements and architecture is ideal for exposing issues with constructing a system of systems from existing artifacts. Structured argumentation is used to explore these issues, to inform the analysis, to reveal underlying assumptions in the analysis, and to help either establish system correctness to an acceptable level or provide rebuttals that invalidate the analysis...|$|E
