5|$|NY326 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York and extended from the village of Union Springs to the city of Auburn. The route initially followed Oakwood Road and Genesee Street from the hamlet of Oakwood to Auburn, where it ended at an intersection with NY34 (South Street) in downtown Auburn. A divided highway was built west of Auburn , connecting the overlapping routes of US20 and NY5 to NY326. US20 and NY5 were rerouted <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> the new highway south to NY326, and all three routes continued east into downtown on Genesee Street. By 1977, US20 and NY5 were realigned once again <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> a new arterial leading from {{the north end of the}} divided highway eastward into downtown. NY326, meanwhile, was realigned <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> the divided highway north to US20 and NY5.|$|E

Albany Street is the eastbound half of a one-way couplet with nearby Main Street; as a result, the two directions of NY167 split <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> different alignments through western Little Falls. From Overhead Street, northbound NY167 turns east <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> Albany Street for two blocks to Little Falls' commercial center, where it intersects with southbound NY169 at South Ann Street. NY169 turns east here <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> Albany Street while NY167 heads south along the two-way South Ann Street for one block to reach NY5, a four-lane divided highway on the north bank of the Mohawk River. At this point, NY167 northbound reconnects to the southbound route, which follows NY5 west from South Ann Street to NY5's junction with {{the west end of}} Albany Street.|$|E

5|$|The {{first state}} {{trunkline}} highway designated {{along the path}} of the modern US41 was M-15, in use as far back as 1919. The 1925 draft plan for the establishment of the US Highway System would have replaced M-15 with three different US Highways. Between Menominee and Powers, M-15 was <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> the route that US41 follows today. East of Powers to Rapid River, the trunkline would have been just US2. The next segment between Rapid River and Covington was planned as US102 while the remainder north to Copper Harbor was planned as US41. In between Powers and Covington, US41 was planned <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> US2 west to Iron Mountain and then route of the modern US141 between Powers and Covington. When the system was created on November 11, 1926, US41 was the only US Highway routed along the alignment of M-15. The original map showed US41 following an unbuilt alignment between Powers and Marquette. The new US41 designation was instead routed <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> the former M-15.|$|E
