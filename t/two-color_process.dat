If color design was carefully managed, the lack of colors such as true green could pass unnoticed. Although Cinecolor used the same duplitized stock as Prizma and Multicolor, it had the advantage that its printing and processing methods yielded larger quantities of finished film in less time.|$|R

50|$|Mannes and Godowsky {{first took}} an {{interest}} in color photography when in 1917, still high school pupils at the time, they saw a movie called Our Navy, a movie made using a four-color additive process. Both agreed the color was terrible. After reading up on the subject in the library they started to experiment with additive color processes. Their experiments were continued during their college years, eventually producing a camera having two lenses that project images side by side on a single strip of film. The color rendition of this additive <b>two-color</b> <b>process</b> was not too bad, but aligning the two lenses of the projector needed was too difficult.|$|E

The large cross sections observed for specific one-color two-step transitions are due to the near double resonant excitation into autoionizing states. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|While Paramount {{was a large}} {{organization}} with a network of theaters, its fiscal consciousness was largely responsible for preventing Fleischer Studios from acquiring the three-color Technicolor Process, leaving it available for a four year exclusivity with Walt Disney, who created a new market for color cartoons, established by Academy Award winner, Flowers and Trees (1932).Paramount relinquished {{to the release of}} the Color Classics series starting in 1934. But with the exclusivity of the three-color process still held by Disney, Fleischer Studios used the available <b>two-color</b> <b>processes,</b> Cinecolor, a two-emulsion red and blue <b>process,</b> and <b>Two-color</b> Technicolor, using red and green. By 1936, the Disney exclusivity was expired, and Fleischer Studios used the three-color process in its color cartoons beginning with Somewhere in Dreamland and continued using it for the remainder of its active years.|$|R
50|$|As {{founding}} member of The Society of Motion Picture Engineers, Max {{was aware of the}} technical advancements of the industry, particularly in the development of color cinematography. Due to Paramount's financial restructuring, Max was unable to acquire the three-color Technicolor process from the start. This created the opportunity for Walt Disney, who was then a small fledgling producer to acquire a four-year exclusivity. With this, he created a new market for color cartoons beginning with Flowers and Trees (1932). In 1934 Paramount approved color production for Fleischer, but he was left with the limited <b>two-color</b> <b>processes</b> of Cinecolor (red and blue) and Two-Color Technicolor (red and green) for the first year of his Color Classics. The first entry, Poor Cinderella was made in the two-emulsion/two color Cinecolor Process and starred Betty Boop in her only color appearance. By 1936, Disney's exclusivity had expired, and Fleischer had the benefit of the three-color Technicolor Process beginning with Play Safe.|$|R
50|$|By early 1934, Friz Freleng was {{appointed}} the main {{director of the}} Merrie Melodies, following the departures of other directors from Leon Schlesinger Productions (the company later known as Warner Bros. Cartoons). Beauty and the Beast (released in April 1934) was the first Merrie Melodies animated short film directed by Freleng. It was a color film, using a <b>two-color</b> <b>process.</b> However, following its release, Freleng would direct six short films in black and white. Among them were The Girl at the Ironing Board and The Miller's Daughter. From November 1934 onwards, the Merrie Melodies switched to only including color films. The sibling series Looney Tunes continued to be produced in black and white.|$|E
5000|$|Gold Diggers of Broadway {{was filmed}} in Technicolor. According to Herbert Kalmus, the co-founder and President of the company, the system Technicolor used {{at that time}} was a {{subtractive}} imbibition <b>two-color</b> <b>process</b> introduced in 1928 which utilized filters and a normal-thickness dye-transfer print, as opposed to two prints cemented together, as had previously been the case. [...] Warner Bros. was one of the primary users of the new system, although other studios utilized it as well, often for color sequences within an otherwise black-and-while film. Warners, however, often made films that were color throughout: in 1930 they released 15 films which used two-color Technicolor, only four of which used color only for limited sequences.|$|E
50|$|By 1924 {{they were}} able to patent a <b>two-color</b> <b>process.</b> The {{important}} part of that patented process was a process called controlled diffusion. By timing how long it took for an image to form in the top layer, but not yet in the next layer beneath that one, they began to solve the problem that Fischer could not. Using this time-controlled way of processing one layer at a time, they could create the dye image of the required color in only that layer in which it is required. Some three years later they were still experimenting using this controlled diffusion method of separating the colors in the multi-layer emulsion, but by then they had decided that instead of incorporating the color couplers into the emulsion layers themselves, they could be added to the developing chemicals, solving the problem of wandering color couplers. The only part left of Fischer's original problem with a multi-layer emulsion were the wandering sensitizing dyes.|$|E

50|$|MGM {{was one of}} {{the first}} studios to {{experiment}} with filming in Technicolor. Using the <b>two-color</b> Technicolor <b>process</b> then available, MGM filmed portions of The Uninvited Guest (1923), The Big Parade (1925), and Ben-Hur (1925), among others, in the process. In 1928, MGM released The Viking, the first complete Technicolor feature with sound (including a synchronized score and sound effects, but no spoken dialogue).|$|R
50|$|The first Color Classic {{was photographed}} in the <b>two-color</b> Cinecolor <b>process.</b> The {{rest of the}} 1934 and 1935 {{cartoons}} were shot in two-color Technicolor, because the Disney studio had an exclusive agreement with Technicolor that prevented other studios from using the lucrative three-strip process. That exclusive contract expired in September 1935, and the 1936 Color Classic cartoon Somewhere in Dreamland became the first Fleischer cartoon produced in three-strip Technicolor.|$|R
50|$|The Everyman {{play was}} first {{brought to the}} cinema in 1913 using the Kinemacolor <b>two-color</b> <b>process</b> that {{projected}} black-and-white film through red and green filters to produce an early form of color movie. Linda Arvidson, a well-known actress who was recently separated from her movie producer husband D.W. Griffith, was cast in the title role, as she {{at the time was}} the leading lady for Kinemacolor studios. Unfortunately, Kinemacolor's parent company in Britain collapsed right after release of the movie, and Arvidson's estranged husband bought out the California operations of Kinemacolor, which included rights to their United States film releases. Griffith's acquisition of the Everyman film meant that distribution was a low priority, and despite the Broadway success of the play, the casting of a high-profile actress, and the novelty of color, the film made little impact. Subsequently, Crawley-Maude Features, which was owned by former Everyman leading lady Constance Crawley and her manager Arthur Maude, produced in 1914 their own film adaptation of Everyman, which did little better than the Kinemacolor version.|$|E
5000|$|The Miller's Daughter is a {{black and}} white film, one of the last Merrie Melodies {{released}} in black and white. In April 1934, the first Merrie Melodies film directed by Freleng was released. It was Beauty and the Beast, a color film using a <b>two-color</b> <b>process.</b> However, the next six films directed by Freleng (including The Miller's Daughter) were all in black and white. A new release season started in November 1934, with the release of Those Beautiful Dames in color. From then on, all Merrie Melodies were color films. Meanwhile the sibling Looney Tunes series continued to be released in black and white. Barrier notes that the change in color came with an increase in payments made from Warner Bros. to producer Leon Schlesinger. Warner Bros. made a payment of 1,750 dollars for each black-and-white Merrie Melodies film. It made a payment of 9,250 dollars for the color films of the series. Despite an increase in the production budget of the series, the Schlesinger budgets continued to be smaller than the Disney ones. According to Barrier, the switch to color did not translate to [...] "greater refinement" [...] for the Merrie Melodies under the direction of Freleng.|$|E
5000|$|Mystery of the Wax Museum was {{the last}} feature film under a 1931 Technicolor contract. Warner had already noted the publics apathy with the {{artificial}} color system. Technicolor was greeted with hostility by critics and public awash in its unreal hues and humdrum quality control since 1929. The considerable additional expense of the compromised two-color spectrum, which was a fine idea when color was a novelty, was now anathema. Warners had tried without success to get Technicolor to permit them to swap out the last feature commitment {{for a series of}} shorts, but when the studio violated the contract by filming Doctor X with an additional black-and-white unit [...] - [...] thereby permitting them to process prints at their own lab and avoid paying Technicolor thousands of dollars [...] - [...] Technicolor dug in their heels and refused. Consequently, Mystery of the Wax Museum {{was the last}} studio feature in the two-color Technicolor system. Technicolor founder Herbert Kalmus declaring it [...] "the ultimate that is possible with two components." [...] Apparently the combination of the <b>two-color</b> <b>process</b> with the lighting of Rennahan and the set designs of Grot created an unreal atmosphere that worked well for the films story.|$|E
5000|$|The three negatives {{were printed}} to gelatin matrix films, which were {{processed}} with a selectively hardening developer, treated {{to remove the}} silver, and hot-washed to leave only a gelatin relief of the images. A receiver print, consisting of a 50% density silver print of the black-and-white negative for the green component, and including the soundtrack and frame lines, was made and treated with dye mordants {{to aid in the}} imbibition process (the inclusion of a [...] "black" [...] image was discontinued in the early 1940s). The matrix for each color was soaked in its complementary dye (yellow, cyan, or magenta), then each in succession was brought into high-pressure contact with the receiver, which imbibed and held the dyes, thus reproducing a nearly complete spectrum of color, unlike previous <b>two-color</b> <b>processes.</b> The first animation film to use the three-color (also called three-strip) system was Walt Disney's Flowers and Trees (1932), which introduced it to an enthusiastic public. The first short live-action film was La Cucaracha (1934), and the first all-color feature in [...] "New Technicolor" [...] was Becky Sharp (1935).|$|R

2500|$|Scott renewed his {{acquaintance}} with producer Harry Joe Brown {{and together they}} began producing many of Scott's Westerns, including several that were shot in the <b>two-color</b> Cinecolor <b>process.</b> Their collaboration produced the superior Coroner Creek (1948) with Scott as a vengeance-driven cowpoke who [...] "predates the Budd Boetticher/Burt Kennedy heroes by nearly a decade," [...] Gunfighters (1947) based on the Zane Grey novel Two Sombreros, and The Walking Hills (1949), a modern-day tale of gold hunters.|$|R
5000|$|The first Kodak {{product called}} Kodachrome {{was invented by}} John Capstaff in 1913. His Kodachrome was a {{subtractive}} process that used only two colors: blue-green and red-orange. It required two glass plate negatives, one made using a panchromatic emulsion and a red filter, the other made using an emulsion insensitive to red light. The two plates could be exposed as a [...] "bipack" [...] (sandwiched emulsion to emulsion, with a very thin red filter layer between), which eliminated the need for multiple exposures or a special color camera. After development, the silver images were bleached out with chemistry that hardened the bleached portions of the gelatin. Using dyes which were absorbed only by the unhardened gelatin, the negative that recorded the blue and green light was dyed red-orange and the red-exposed negative was dyed blue-green. The result {{was a pair of}} positive dye images. The plates were then assembled emulsion to emulsion, producing a transparency that was capable of surprisingly good (for a <b>two-color</b> <b>process)</b> color rendition of skin tones in portraits. Capstaff's Kodachrome was made commercially available in 1915. It was also adapted for use as a 35 mm motion picture film process.Today, this first version of Kodachrome is nearly forgotten, completely overshadowed by the next Kodak product bearing the name Kodachrome.|$|E
5000|$|King of Jazz was {{the nineteenth}} all-talking motion picture filmed entirely in two-color Technicolor {{rather than simply}} {{including}} color sequences. At the time, Technicolor's <b>two-color</b> <b>process</b> employed red and green dyes, each {{with a dash of}} other colors mixed in, but no blue dye. King of Jazz was to showcase a spectacular presentation of George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue, so this presented a problem. Fortunately, the green dye Technicolor used can actually appear peacock blue (cyan) under some conditions, but acceptable results in this case would require very careful handling. Art director Herman Rosse and production director John Murray Anderson came up with solutions. Tests were made of various fabrics and pigments, and by using an all gray-and-silver background the bluish aspect of the dye was set off to best advantage. Filters were also used to inject pale blues into the scene being filmed. The goal was to produce a finished film with pastel shades rather than bright colors. Nevertheless, as it appears in an original two-color Technicolor print, the sequence might best be described as a [...] "Rhapsody in Turquoise". Later prints made from the original two-component negative, which had survived, make the blues look truer and more saturated than they appeared to audiences in 1930.|$|E
5000|$|In 1935, American Eastman Kodak {{introduced}} {{the first modern}} [...] "integral tripack" [...] color film and called it Kodachrome, a name recycled from an earlier and completely different <b>two-color</b> <b>process.</b> Its development was led by the improbable team of Leopold Mannes and Leopold Godowsky, Jr. (nicknamed [...] "Man" [...] and [...] "God"), two highly regarded classical musicians who had started tinkering with color photographic processes and ended up working with the Kodak Research Laboratories. Kodachrome had three layers of emulsion coated on a single base, each layer recording {{one of the three}} additive primaries, red, green, and blue. In keeping with Kodak's old [...] "you press the button, we do the rest" [...] slogan, the film was simply loaded into the camera, exposed in the ordinary way, then mailed to Kodak for processing. The complicated part, if the complexities of manufacturing the film are ignored, was the processing, which involved the controlled penetration of chemicals into the three layers of emulsion. Only a simplified description of the process is appropriate in a short history: as each layer was developed into a black-and-white silver image, a [...] "dye coupler" [...] added during that stage of development caused a cyan, magenta or yellow dye image to be created along with it. The silver images were chemically removed, leaving only the three layers of dye images in the finished film.|$|E

40|$|Phenotypic and genomic {{dynamics}} enable {{bacteria to}} adapt quickly to various ecological niches and environmental fluctuations {{such as the}} presence of xenobiotic compounds. We explored the different adaptive mechanisms in the bacterium Sphingobium francense, which is able to degrade lindane, a chlorinated xenobiotic compound historically used in agricultural and medicine. Previous studies demonstrated the association of mobile genetic elements with lin genes implicated in lindane catabolic pathways. We also observed that the wildtype, sp+, a lindane degrading strain, produces mutants (at a rate of 4 percent per replating) unable to degrade lindane. In order to study the role of mobile genetic elements in the adaptability of this bacterium, we developed an original strategy based on the pyrosequencing data obtained for the genome of Sphingobium francense sp+ and microarray comparative genomic hybridizations. This approach uses a <b>two-color</b> <b>process</b> to estimate the different types of genomic rearrangements that occurred in a mutant genome in comparison to the reference strain sp+ genome. For this study, five non-lindane degrading mutants and one revertant, which recovered the capacity to degrade lindane, were characterized. Analyzes of each microarray showed that the nonlindane degrading mutants underwent large genomic rearrangements and the selected mutants were genetically different. Moreover, we established the proximity between some environmental genes and mobile genetic elements. Some of these regions were deleted in the mutants reinforcing the observation that mobile genetic elements {{play an important role in}} bacterial adaptation to environmental perturbation. Thus, all the data obtained confirms the extraordinary plasticity of the Sphingobium genome linked to the presence of multiple mobile genetic elements, which are involved in the instability of lindane degradation capability and other environmental functional genes...|$|E
