5|$|There {{are three}} steps to a Batson inquiry. First, the party {{opposing}} {{the use of}} a peremptory challenge must make a prima facie case. This requires only an inference, not preponderance. Second, the party seeking the peremptory challenge must provide a permissible, neutral explanation for the challenge. Third, the trial court must decide whether <b>the</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> pretextual. A rationale is pretextual if it applies equally to a similarly situated juror who was seated.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the disc}} {{machines}} designed at the Volta Lab had their disc mounted on vertical turntables. <b>The</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> {{that in the}} early experiments the turntable with disc was mounted on the shop lathe, along with the recording and reproducing heads. Later, when the complete models were built most of them featured vertical turntables.|$|E
25|$|Opposing {{the tidal}} {{deceleration}} of Earth is a mechanism {{that is in}} fact accelerating the rotation. Earth is not a sphere, but rather an ellipsoid that is flattened at the poles. SLR has shown that this flattening is decreasing. <b>The</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> that during the ice age large masses of ice collected at the poles, and depressed the underlying rocks. The ice mass started disappearing over 10000 years ago, but Earth's crust is still not in hydrostatic equilibrium and is still rebounding (the relaxation time {{is estimated to be}} about 4000 years). As a consequence, the polar diameter of Earth increases, and the equatorial diameter decreases (Earth's volume must remain the same). This means that mass moves closer to the rotation axis of Earth, and that Earth's moment of inertia decreases. This process alone leads to an increase of the rotation rate (phenomenon of a spinning figure skater who spins ever faster as they retract their arms). From the observed change in the moment of inertia the acceleration of rotation can be computed: the average value over the historical period must have been about −0.6 ms/century. This largely explains the historical observations.|$|E

500|$|Xenophon {{advised that}} {{male and female}} slaves should be lodged separately, that [...] "…nor {{children}} born and bred by our domestics without our knowledge and consent—no unimportant matter, since, if the act of rearing children tends to make good servants still more loyally disposed, cohabiting but sharpens ingenuity for mischief in the bad." [...] <b>The</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> perhaps economic; even a skilled slave was cheap, so {{it may have been}} cheaper to purchase a slave than to raise one. Additionally, childbirth placed the slave-mother's life at risk, and the baby was not guaranteed to survive to adulthood.|$|E
500|$|There is {{a charter}} {{allegedly}} issued by Domhnall to Paisley Abbey, {{found in the}} cartulary of that abbey. In this charter Domhnall is given no title, instead merely described by his genealogy: Douenaldus filius Reginaldi filii Sumerledi, [...] "Domhnall, son of Raghnall, son of Somhairle". This charter is thought by some historians to be spurious, mainly because the witness list and wording of the charter are, {{in the words of}} Alex Woolf, [...] "suspiciously similar" [...] to those in a genuine charter of Domhnall's son Aonghus Mór. Presumably, <b>the</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> that the monks of Paisley Abbey at some later stage may have thought it in their interest to replicate Aonghus Mór's charter in order to add the authority of the founder of Clan Donald to their land rights.|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> {{that the}} {{interstellar}} medium is optically thin. Starlight traveling through a kiloparsec column undergoes about a magnitude of extinction, so that the optical depth ~ 1. An optical depth of 1 corresponds to a mean free path, which is the distance, on average that a photon travels before scattering from a dust grain. So on average, a starlight photon is scattered from a single interstellar grain; multiple scattering (which produces circular polarization) is much less likely. [...] Observationally, the linear polarization fraction p ~ 0.015 [...] from a single scattering; circular polarization from multiple scattering goes as , so we expect a circularly polarized fraction of [...]|$|E

2500|$|Lindeman {{states that}} social motives (i.e., [...] "to {{comprehend}} {{self and the}} world, {{to have a sense}} of control over outcomes, to belong, to find the world benevolent and to maintain one's self-esteem") are often [...] "more easily" [...] fulfilled by pseudoscience than by scientific information. Furthermore, pseudoscientific explanations are generally not analyzed rationally, but instead experientially. Operating within a different set of rules compared to rational thinking, experiential thinking regards an explanation as valid if <b>the</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> [...] "personally functional, satisfying and sufficient", offering a description of the world that may be more personal than can be provided by science and reducing the amount of potential work involved in understanding complex events and outcomes.|$|E
2500|$|Hellanicus of Lesbos, in Fragment 7 of the Argolica, {{concerns}} {{himself with}} one word in one {{line of the}} Iliad, [...] "pasture-land of horses", applied to Argos in the Peloponnesus. What is said about it is reported by different authors and all accounts differ. <b>The</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> trivial and mythical, but all accounts agree Hellanicus said the term Argeia (gē) or Argolis once applied to all Peloponnesus and that Pelasgus and his two brothers received it as an inheritance from their father, named either Triopas, Arestōr or Phorōneus. Pelasgus built the citadel Larisa of Argos on the Erasinus river, whence the name Pelasgic Argos (of the Peloponnesus), but later resettled inland, built Parrhasia and named the region or caused it to be named Pelasgia, to be renamed Arcadia {{with the coming of}} the Greeks.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his study}} of Eliade, Jung, and Campbell, Ellwood also {{discusses}} the connection between academic theories and controversial political involvements, noting that all three mythologists {{have been accused of}} reactionary political positions. Ellwood notes the obvious parallel between the conservatism of myth, which speaks of a primordial golden age, and the conservatism of far right politics. However, Ellwood argues that <b>the</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> more complex than that. Wherever their political sympathies may have sometimes been, he claims, the three mythologists were often [...] "apolitical if not antipolitical, scorning any this-worldly salvation". Moreover, the connection between mythology and politics differs for each of the mythologists in question: in Eliade's case, Ellwood believes, a strong sense of nostalgia ("for childhood, for historical times past, for cosmic religion, for paradise"), influenced not only the scholar's academic interests, but also his political views.|$|E

2500|$|The second theory {{comes from}} Kay Smith who {{points out that}} key to {{developing}} the classic gun may be a new method of gun casting, muzzle side up. Smith observes: [...] "The surviving pieces of ordnance from earlier in the 15th century are big pieces with large bore sizes. They do not look like the long thin gun.… Essentially they are parallel-sided tubes with flat ends. <b>The</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>is,</b> probably, that they were cast muzzle down in the traditional bell-founding method whereas the long thin guns were cast muzzle up.… Perhaps this marks the real 'revolution' in artillery. Once the technique of casting muzzle up with the attendant advantages, {{and it is not}} clear what those are at present, had been mastered by cannon founders, the way was open for the development of the 'classic' form of artillery." [...] However, Smith himself states that {{it is not clear what}} advantages this technique would have conferred, despite its widespread adoption.|$|E
2500|$|The best {{indicator}} of teacher quality, according to Dewey, {{is the ability}} to watch and respond to the movement of the mind with keen awareness of the signs and quality of the responses he or her students exhibit with regard to the subject-matter presented (Dewey, APT, 2010; Dewey, 1904). [...] As Dewey notes, [...] "I have often been asked how it was that some teachers who have never studied the art of teaching are still extraordinarily good teachers. [...] <b>The</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> simple. [...] They have a quick, sure and unflagging sympathy with the operations and process of the minds they are in contact with. [...] Their own minds move in harmony with those of others, appreciating their difficulties, entering into their problems, sharing their intellectual victories" [...] (Dewey, APT, 2010, p.36). [...] Such a teacher is genuinely aware of the complexities of this mind to mind transfer, and she has the intellectual fortitude to identify the successes and failures of this process, as well as how to appropriately reproduce or correct it in the future.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} types of wordplay used in cryptics. One is {{straightforward}} definition substitution using parts of a word. For example, in one puzzle by Mel Taub, the answer IMPORTANT is given the clue [...] "To bring worker into the country may prove significant". <b>The</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> that to import means [...] "to bring into the country", the [...] "worker" [...] is a worker ant, and [...] "significant" [...] means important. Here, [...] "significant" [...] is the straight definition (appearing here {{at the end of}} the clue), [...] "to bring worker into the country" [...] is the wordplay definition, and [...] "may prove" [...] serves to link the two. Note that in a cryptic clue, there is almost always only one answer that fits both the definition and the wordplay, so that when one sees the answer, one knows that it is the right answer—although it can sometimes be a challenge to figure out why it is the right answer. A good cryptic clue should provide a fair and exact definition of the answer, while at the same time being deliberately misleading.|$|E
