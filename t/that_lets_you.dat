It featured Free-to-play experiences via Games for Windows LIVE as well as: A persistent online capital city that lives and grows even when you're offline, Cooperative multiplayer quests, trading and a level-based system <b>that</b> <b>lets</b> <b>you</b> progress at your own pace. Premium content could be earned or purchased, such as access to blueprints and special items, {{as well as more}} quests and features. In September 2013, it was announced that the game would remain functional until July 1, 2014, after which it would be shut down due to the content being too expensive to maintain.|$|E
500|$|Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone {{appreciated}} André 3000's {{performance and}} the song itself, writing: [...] "André 3000 is sharp and effortlessly charismatic on his rapped verse, but the real attraction here is the track itself." [...] Similarly, David Amidon of PopMatters commented that the song features [...] "one of those rare 'look how effortless rapping is for me'." [...] This was echoed by Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork Media, who wrote that [...] " [...] carefree retro sensibility pops up on three more highlights, including 'Party', which combines a pitch-perfect André 3000 guest verse, a Slick Rick sample, [...] while its bounce provides prime summer barbecue background." [...] Rich Juzwiak of The Village Voice was also positive: [...] "'Party' sounds right out of The SOS Band's catalog (its plodding tempo {{is the only thing}} <b>that</b> <b>lets</b> <b>you</b> know she isn't quoting a particularly poetic, desperately meth-seeking craigslist m4m ad [...] )". Jon Caramainca of The New York Times wrote that Beyoncé sings the song [...] "in her best impression of naughtiness." [...] Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound praised the minimal production and simplistic lyrics of [...] "Party" [...] further describing the song as being as [...] "simple as a Beyoncé song gets: a low-key, synth-y beat paired with inspired vocals by Beyoncé and a killer, fluid verse by Mr. Benjamin [...]" ...|$|E

2500|$|GameSpy's Justin Speer {{scored the}} PlayStation 2 version 4 out of 5, calling it [...] "a ridiculously violent, unbelievably profane game <b>that</b> <b>lets</b> <b>you</b> glorify {{yourself}} with virtual {{millions of dollars}} in hard-earned drug money, fast cars, boats, underlings, women and copious amounts of blood. It's a good feeling." [...] However, he noted that [...] "gamers who are getting used to the next-generation of console visuals aren't going to be impressed with either the PS2 or the Xbox version." [...] He also argued the game becomes somewhat repetitive towards the end. However, he concluded [...] "Scarface is a long-lasting experience that's simply a lot of fun.

2500|$|... 411Mania {{gave it a}} {{score of}} 9.6 out of 10 and said that it {{initially}} [...] "felt like Call of Duty, but as I progressed through the game, I {{found that there was}} substantially more. The game plays it by the numbers in many ways but it's very polished and fun. The multiplayer will keep you occupied for months. Any PS3 owner will do themselves a disservice by not picking up this game." [...] USA Today gave it a score of four stars out of five, saying, [...] "Easily the best game for the new Sony PlayStation 3 game console, Resistance: Fall of Man is a first-person shooter <b>that</b> <b>lets</b> <b>you,</b> as an American soldier stationed in the United Kingdom, lead the fight to rid the world of a vicious alien race." [...] Maxim similarly gave it a score of eight out of ten, saying that the game [...] "managed to exceed our lofty expectations, but only by an wirey crotch hair." [...] The Sydney Morning Herald also gave it four stars out of five and called it [...] "an accomplished shooter providing many fun online modes, engaging solo missions and superb weapons." [...] However, The New York Times gave it an average review, saying that [...] "In spite of rave reviews it’s a fairly pedestrian humans-versus-aliens first-person shooter that brings nothing new to the genre. The artificial intelligence of combatants is lackluster, and the semi-sepia-toned graphics are surprisingly unimpressive, no better than what you would see on the five-year-old Xbox." ...|$|E
