They are so {{respected}} in <b>their</b> <b>cultures</b> that they occasionally hold funerals for beached whales, a throwback to Vietnam's ancient sea-based Austro-Asiatic culture. The god of the seas, according to Chinese folklore, was a large whale with human limbs.|$|E
5|$|Stereotypical and {{historically}} inaccurate images of Indians in general interfere with learning about them by creating, supporting and maintaining oversimplified and inaccurate views {{of indigenous peoples}} and <b>their</b> <b>cultures.</b> When stereotypical representations are taken as factual information, they {{contribute to the development}} of cultural biases and prejudices, (clearly a contradiction to the educational mission of the University.) In the same vein, we believe that continuation of the use of Indians as symbols and mascots is incongruous with the philosophy espoused by many Americans as promoting inclusivity and diversity.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, Thurman and {{her husband}} moved to San Francisco. She wrote several {{articles}} about their Asian trip, analyzing information, discussing their meeting with Gandhi and pressing for scholarship exchanges for negro students at Indian universities. It was from the Thurmans and their talks and writings that Martin Luther King Jr. learned of non-violent resistance {{as a means of}} social protest. By 1944, the church which they had envisioned after their meeting with Gandhi became a reality when they, along with Fisk, opened the Church for the Fellowship of All Peoples. It was the first interracial, non-denominational church in the United States. While her husband assumed the pastoral duties, Thurman organized forums and lectures for the members to learn about other peoples such as Native Americans, Africans, Asians and <b>their</b> <b>cultures,</b> covering everything from the Jews to the Navajos.|$|E
40|$|This file {{was last}} viewed in Adobe Reader X. Higher {{education}} is evolving {{and becoming a}} diverse arena for different races and ethnicities. The issue explored in this study consisted of interactions among Latinos in higher education. Latinos were the ideal subjects for this study because of the diversity within the group. For example, within the Latino culture there are people from the Caribbean, Central America, South America, Mexico, Portugal and Spain. Diversity is studied from the perspective within the Latino culture because Latinos have numerous subcultures. For example, the Latino population can be classified as Spaniard, Portuguese, Mexican, Chicano, Nuyorican, South American, Caribbean Islander and many other subcultures as well. This was a qualitative study focused on six interviews conducted to determine the level of interaction each participant maintained within <b>their</b> <b>culture</b> and outside <b>their</b> <b>culture.</b> The interviews revealed {{that all of the}} students frequently interacted within <b>their</b> own <b>culture</b> and a majority of the students interacted with students outside <b>their</b> <b>culture.</b> It was concluded that students that frequently interacted within and outside <b>their</b> <b>culture</b> had a better overall university experience than students who primarily interacted within <b>their</b> <b>culture</b> and rarely interacted outside of <b>their</b> <b>culture...</b>|$|R

25|$|Once {{thought to}} face {{extinction}} as a race or culture, Native Americans of numerous tribes have achieved revival of aspects of <b>their</b> <b>cultures,</b> together with asserting their sovereignty {{and direction of}} their own affairs since the mid-20th century. Many have started language programs to revive use of traditional languages; some have established tribally controlled colleges and other schools on their reservations, so that education is expressive of <b>their</b> <b>cultures.</b> Since the late 20th century, many tribes have developed gaming casinos on their sovereign land to raise revenues for economic development, {{as well as to}} promote the education and welfare of their people through health care and construction of improved housing.|$|E

25|$|Like Harrington, other reviewers {{recognize}} that Spybuck possessed a remarkable talent, but it often served a practical {{purpose in the}} domain of ethnography. His paintings served as illustrations for numerous anthropological writings. Dobkins calls this practice autoethnography, in which the artist or writer assimilates the techniques of ethnographers to create representations of themselves and <b>their</b> <b>cultures,</b> with the implication of an asymmetrical power relationship between the ethnographer patron and the Native artist. Along with Spybuck, Dobkins names Jesse Cornplanter (Seneca), Peter Pitseolak (Inuit), and Frank Day (Maidu) as artists who practiced autoethnography to regain control over representations of <b>their</b> <b>cultures</b> and to retrieve and preserve their traditions. Other reviewers recognize Spybuck as an Indian artist who is a recorder and preserver of traditional practices in the midst of social change.|$|E
