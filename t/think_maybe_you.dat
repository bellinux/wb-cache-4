5000|$|Dynasty {{debuted in}} January 1981, with Pamela Sue Martin portraying Fallon. She said in 2007 {{that because of}} her thin hair, {{producers}} insisted she wear a wig when the series began. Martin said, [...] "I {{put up with this}} for a while, but a few months later I saw a picture of myself on a magazine cover. The wig made me look like a country and western star. I refused to wear it any more." [...] In 2006, she said of Forsythe, [...] "He really was like a father to me. I asked John to walk me down the aisle when I got married in real life, but he said, 'I <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> should ask your real dad.' I was just so attached to him." ...|$|E

5000|$|Once, {{to protest}} the lack of female {{bathrooms}} at Harvard, she led a mass urination on the grounds. When asked about this, she said: I'm just a loud-mouthed middle-aged colored lady with a fused spine and three feet of intestines missing {{and a lot of}} people <b>think</b> I'm crazy. <b>Maybe</b> <b>you</b> do too, but I never stop to wonder why I'm not like other people. The mystery to me is why more people aren't like me. In 1974, People magazine wrote that she was [...] "The biggest, loudest and, indisputably, the rudest mouth on the battleground." ...|$|R

It meant the whole world could tumble around us and the landslide would bring you down." [...] "Everybody {{seems to think that}} I wrote this song about them ... and my dad, my dad did {{have something to do with}} it, but he absolutely thinks that he was the whole complete reason it was ever written. I guess it was about September 1974, I was home at my dad and mom's house in Phoenix, and my father said, 'You know, I <b>think</b> that <b>maybe</b> ... <b>you</b> really put a lot of time into this singing career, <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> should give this six more months, and if you want to go back to school, we'll pay for it ... Lindsey and I went up to Aspen, and we went to somebody's incredible house, and they had a piano, and I had my guitar with me, and I went into their living room, looking out over the incredible, like, Aspen sky way, and I wrote [...] "Landslide" ... three months later, Mick Fleetwood called." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "It is us, the {{professional}} artists of flamenco, {{who have to}} make cante flamenco, and nobody else, Flamenco, like any other art, is an art of professionals, {{although there are many}} people who peer at us, with a look as if to say: What interesting little creatures! or maybe: Oh! What music the people are playing! and so on. And people often <b>think</b> that <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> have to have fingers swollen from picking potatoes to be able to play the guitar with feeling. Look, picking potatoes is every bit as worthy as playing a guitar. But I can tell you that a man -with fine, sensitive fingers is not going to be able to make a go of picking potatoes: and I can also tell you that a man with fingers swollen from picking potatoes is not going to be able to play a guitar because he hasn't got the manual dexterity and he hasn't got the dedication. This is a profession like any other which you have to dedicate yourself to completely. It is an art of professionals." ...|$|R
2500|$|Additional {{recording}} {{took place}} at Auerbach's Easy Eye Sound Studio in Nashville in February 2014, including all of Auerbach's vocals. According to the band, they wrote 30 songs while recording the album, but were unable to complete all of them. Carney spent about three-to-four days sequencing the album at his studio before soliciting Auerbach's input. The only change made to the running order was the addition of [...] "Gotta Get Away" [...] to the end; Carney had wanted [...] "In Our Prime" [...] to close the record, but Auerbach thought the song was too sad and preferred a catchy, upbeat track to conclude the album. Carney agreed with the change, saying, [...] "Actually, I think it works well at the end, too. It erases your brain from whatever heavy elements {{there are in the}} record. I <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> it encourages <b>you</b> to go back and listen to the record again." ...|$|R

40|$|All of {{the senses}} are {{important}} when eating. Think about eating a potato chip – fi rst you see the chip (<b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> notice if it has any dark/burnt spots?). Next <b>you</b> touch it (<b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> notice if it’s greasy, or if it’s thick?). Then as you bring the chip to your mouth <b>you</b> smell it (<b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> smell the seasoning? Or the oil it was fried or baked in?), then you eat it and hear the crunch of the chip, and you probably also taste the saltiness (<b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> also experience some additional fl avor?). Imagine if {{any one of these}} experiences was missing – would a chip be the same if you didn’t hear it crunch in your mouth...|$|R
