40|$|Graduation date: 1982 A new {{three-phase}} argon {{plasma arc}} {{was developed for}} analytical emission spectroscopy. The power supplied to the plasma arc utilized a simple circuit with three-phase as line voltage stepped down via a transformer to 104 Vrms. A three concentric quartz <b>tubing</b> <b>assembly</b> {{was determined to be}} the optimum configuration for supplying argon and sample aerosol to the plasma. A Babington-type nebulizer with a split sample aerosol flow stream was constructed and used to supply sample aerosol to the three-phase plasma arc. The three-phase argon plasma arc has an area of low electron density in the center which enabled the sample, in aerosol form, to be efficiently introduced into the plasma. Desolvation of the sample aerosol prior to reaching the plasma enhanced the emission signal by 30 %. Detection limits between 0. 1 ppm and 2 ppm were determined for seven elements. Calibration curves yielded a linear dynamic concentration range of approximately three orders of magnitude. Background emission from the tungsten electrodes employed was recorded from 250 - 600 nm...|$|E

40|$|This review covers {{developments}} {{in the design of}} Laser Ablation (LA) cells, the associated transport <b>tubing</b> <b>assembly,</b> and their coupling to Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) instrumentation. Recent ablation cell designs have reduced the pulse response duration for a single laser shot to < 10 ms, using the criterion of the full peak width at 1 % of the height of the maximum signal intensity. The evolution towards these low dispersion systems has been profoundly influenced by our understanding of processes driving the initial dispersion, of the design aspects of the cell and tubing that influence transport-induced dispersion and transport efficiency, and of limitations imposed by the temporal resolution of ICP-MS instruments, all of which are discussed. Rapid response LA-ICP-MS systems greatly benefit throughput and sensitivity, which are key parameters in 2 D and 3 D imaging at high lateral resolution. The analysis and imaging of biological material has come to the forefront as a key application of LA-ICP-MS. The impact of the technical {{developments in}} LA-ICP-MS systems on emerging applications, including multiplexed metal-tagged antibody detection (for immunohistochemistry), nanoparticle and compound hypo- and hyperaccumulation, and (intra-) cellular/histological studies, is also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Recently, a new device, the Versajet™, {{involving}} "Hydrosurgery Technology" {{which combines}} lavage and sharp debridement instrumentation {{has been described}} for soft tissue debridement. Methods The Versajet™ Hydrosurgery System utilizes a reusable power console with foot pedal activation, disposable handpiece and <b>tubing</b> <b>assembly</b> in conjunction with sterile saline and standard waste receptacle. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to report our experiences with this instrument in debridement of a variety of wounds prior to final reconstructive surgery. Technical details and pitfalls are discussed to facilitate clinical use. Results Efficient, safe and fast debridement was achieved in all patients using the hydrosurgery system. The actual time the hydrosurgery system was used for debridement averaged as 15. 5 minutes. In ten patients, an adequately debrided wound bed was achieved with a single operative procedure, in four patients; two stages were required prior to reconstructive surgery. In one patient with recurrent sacral-iscial pressure sore, two debridements were carried out followed by long term vacuum assisted closure. The postoperative course was uneventful in all patients, but in three with a minor breakdown of the skin graft, which eventually healed with no surgical intervention. Conclusion As a result of our clinical experience, the Versajet™ enables surgeon to precisely target damaged and necrotic tissue and spare viable tissue. This modality may be a useful alternative tool for soft tissue debridement in certain cases. However, further studies are required to investigate its cost-effectiveness in wound management. </p...|$|E
40|$|April 2006, page 1) briefly dis-cussed {{recovery}} considerations specific {{for heavy}} oils, particularly the large yields from some foamy oil reservoirs. Like foamy oil, sand pro-duction (simultaneous extraction of sand {{along with the}} oil) —the subject {{of this part of}} the article—has been associated with enhanced heavy oil recovery. Also as with foamy oil, sand production is not well understood mathematically, and the petroleum industry is attempting to evalu-ate its impact on reservoir performance, in terms of both well deliverability and ultimate recovery. Sand: Control and Exploitation Sand long represented little more than a costly problem and a safety hazard for the petroleum industry. Sand-related problems include: ■ erosion of equipment, such as valves, pump stators, tubing, and surface pipes; ■ subsidence of the reservoir matrix and collapse of casings; ■ blocked <b>tubing</b> <b>assemblies</b> and plugged surface facilities, leading to well blockage; ■ decreased conductivity of the reservoir matrix and, consequently, reduced efficiency of oil recovery; ■ need for disposal procedures; and ■ need for extensive work to replace or repair equipment and clean wells. Many techniques have been developed to prevent the mobilization of sand—that is, to control it. These techniques range from chemical con-solidation (e. g., via the injection of resin) to physical exclusion (via slotted liners, prepacked screens, and gravel pack placement). Use of thes...|$|R

The end of the tubes are inserted into the lugs and subsequently brazed with a silver or brass filler metal. The lug greatly increases the strength of the joint by distributing the molten filler metal over a larger surface area via capillary action. When brazing a bicycle frame, builders may use a small positioning structure called a jig to hold the tubes in place and maintain their precise alignment and frame geometry.|$|R

This was accomplished {{by the use of}} a ‘/ 3 -hp rotary pump and attached manifold, which compressed the gas from the city line and supplied it at a constant pressure to the burner module of the system. A method for the automatic analysis of serum Li was devised by using K as an internal standard and comparing the output of the Li-sensitive photo-cell with that of an at-tenuated K-sensitive cell. In addition, a simple procedure was incorporated into the routine determination of serum Na and K: samples of insufficient volume were diluted in a solution of known electrolyte concentration, which permitted their quantitation without changing the tubing manifold or other operating components of the system. the introduction of the Technicon AutoAnalyzer * Flame Pho-tometer System in our laboratory about 1 year ago, three problems arose concerning its operation for routine automatic and simultaneous serum electrolyte analyses.

40|$|This Final Technical Report {{summarizes}} {{the research and}} development (R&D) work performed by Stolar Research Corporation (Stolar) under U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Contract Number DE-FC 26 - 04 NT 15477. This work involved the development of radar navigation and radio data transmission systems for integration with microhole coiled <b>tubing</b> bottom hole <b>assemblies.</b> Under this contract, Stolar designed, fabricated, and laboratory and field tested two advanced technologies of importance to the future growth of the U. S. oil and gas industry: (1) real-time measurement-while-drilling (MWD) for guidance and navigation of coiled tubing drilling in hydrocarbon reservoirs and (2) two-way inductive radio data transmission on coiled tubing for real-time, subsurface-to-surface data transmission. The operating specifications for these technologies are compatible with 3. 5 -inch boreholes drilled to a true vertical depth (TVD) of 5, 000 feet, which is typical of coiled tubing drilling applications. These two technologies (i. e., the Stolar Data Transmission System and Drill String Radar) were developed into pre-commercial prototypes and tested successfully in simulated coiled tubing drilling conditions. Integration of these two technologies provides a real-time geosteering capability with extremely quick response times. Stolar is conducting additional work required to transition the Drill String Radar into a true commercial product. The results of this advanced development work should be an important step in the expanded commercialization of advanced coiled tubing microhole drilling equipment for use in U.
