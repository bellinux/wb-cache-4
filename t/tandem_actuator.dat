40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{modelling}} and the experimental characterisation {{of the dynamics of}} a quadruple Direct-Drive servovalve used in the horizontal tail <b>tandem</b> <b>actuator</b> of a modern Fly-By-Wire advanced jet trainer. By means of a specifically designed test equipment, the servovalve dynamic response is characterised for the normal operative condition {{as well as for the}} fail-operative conditions, which have been simulated by artificially injecting one or more electrical failures (open circuit and short circuit) into the four coils of the servovalve Linear Force Motor. In parallel with the experimental activities, an accurate model of the dynamics of the servovalve has been developed in the Matlab/Simulink environment. The simulation results are compared with the experimental data and a good agreement is achieved over a wide range of tested conditions. The effects of the electrical failures on the dynamic performance of the servovalve are examined and evaluated. In order to overcome the performance degradation in the fail-operative conditions, the applicability of a simple compensation technique is discussed. The model is designed as a multiple-state machine, where the transition from a state to another is managed using the Simulink/Stateflow charts. This choice, together with the use of Simulink/S-functions for the execution of part of the simulation code, allowed to obtain a real-time executable model, which can be used for real-time monitoring purposes as well as for real-time hardware-in-the-loop simulation...|$|E
40|$|The {{real-time}} {{fault diagnosis}} and failure management (FDFM) of current operational and experimental dual tandem aircraft {{flight control system}} actuators was investigated. Dual <b>tandem</b> <b>actuators</b> were studied because of the active FDFM capability required to manage the redundancy of these actuators. The FDFM methods used on current dual <b>tandem</b> <b>actuators</b> were determined by examining six specific actuators. The FDFM capability on these six actuators was also evaluated. One approach for improving the FDFM capability on dual <b>tandem</b> <b>actuators</b> may be {{through the application of}} artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Existing AI approaches and applications of FDFM were examined and evaluated. Based on the general survey of AI FDFM approaches, the potential role of AI technology for real-time actuator FDFM was determined. Finally, FDFM and maintainability improvements for dual <b>tandem</b> <b>actuators</b> were recommended...|$|R
40|$|The design, {{fabrication}} {{and flight}} testing of a powered elevator {{system for the}} Augmentor Wing Jet STOL Research Aircraft (AWJSRA or Mod C- 8 A) are discussed. The system replaces a manual spring tab elevator control system that was unsatisfactory in the STOL flight regime. Pitch control in the AWJSRA is {{by means of a}} single elevator control surface. The elevator is used for both maneuver and trim control as the stabilizer is fixed. A fully powered, irreversible flight control system powered by dual hydraulic sources was designed. The existing control columns and single mechanical cable system of the AWJSRA have been retained as has been the basic elevator surface, except that the elevator spring tab is modified into a geared balance tab. The control surface is directly actuated by a dual <b>tandem</b> moving body <b>actuator.</b> Control signals are transmitted from the elevator aft quadrant to the actuator by a linkage system that includes a limited authority series servo actuator...|$|R
