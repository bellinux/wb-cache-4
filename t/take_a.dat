5|$|Bipartite verbal {{compounds}} such {{as these}} are not peculiar to any language in particular. They are in fact very common, and may even occur in every language, albeit with varying frequency. English {{has a number of}} complex predicates, include go sightseeing, have breakfast and <b>take</b> (<b>a)</b> bath. The event described by go sightseeing is unable to be described using a single verb sightsee; inflections like sightsaw and sightseen are ungrammatical. An event like <b>take</b> (<b>a)</b> bath, however, may be described by a single verb bathe, but it arguably has a slightly different meaning. <b>Take</b> (<b>a)</b> bath, in any case, is far more common.|$|E
