5|$|<b>The</b> <b>pale</b> {{crag martin}} {{has a very}} large range of 5.9millionkm2 (2.29millionsqmi). The total {{population}} is unknown, but the bird is described as very common in Jordan and common in Egypt. It has an expanding range and increasing population. Its large range and presumably high numbers mean that <b>the</b> <b>pale</b> crag martin is {{not considered to be}} threatened, and it is classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|Dark-plumaged {{immature}} birds may {{be confused}} with turkey vultures, but soar with flat wings, while <b>the</b> <b>pale</b> plumaged adults could feasibly {{be confused with}} the wood stork, although the latter's long neck and legs allow for easy recognition from afar.|$|E
50|$|Young {{birds have}} browner upperparts with cream fringes to <b>the</b> feathers. <b>The</b> <b>paler</b> chest and abdomen have {{longitudinal}} stripes. <b>The</b> <b>paler</b> uppertail makes <b>the</b> banding more obvious.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 10-12 mm. <b>The</b> forewings are <b>pale</b> fawn-ocherous, profusely sprinkled and minutely mottled with fawn-brown, almost obliterating <b>the</b> <b>paler</b> ground color, a few blackish specks {{along the}} costa, especially before the middle. <b>The</b> hindwings are <b>pale</b> gray.|$|R

5|$|In {{areas of}} Pakistan where its range {{overlaps}} {{with that of}} the dusky crag martin, <b>the</b> <b>pale</b> crag martin breeds at a higher altitude. Its range does not overlap there with the Eurasian crag martin, which is found high in the Himalayas, but where both occur in Iran, <b>the</b> <b>pale</b> crag martin favours more arid habitats. In North Africa, the Eurasian species is again found at a higher level. The separation by altitude and aridity means that it is not known whether the closely related Ptyonoprogne martins could hybridise. If they were shown to do so, it would cast doubts on their specific distinctness.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Pale</b> Emperor {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from music critics, the album received an average score of 71, indicating generally favorable reviews, based on 19 publications.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>pale</b> blue {{color of}} the dot {{is the result of}} {{polarization}} and scattering of the light reflected from Earth. The polarization in turn depends on various factors such as cloud cover, exposed areas of oceans, forests, deserts, snow fields etc.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>pale</b> {{crag martin}} is much drabber than most African swallows, and {{confusion}} is unlikely except with other crag martins or with sand martins {{of the genus}} Riparia. It is 15% smaller, paler and greyer than the Eurasian crag martin, and has smaller tail spots. It is smaller, paler, and has a more contrasting throat than the rock martin. In the far east of its range, <b>the</b> <b>pale</b> crag martin always has lighter underparts than the dusky crag martin. Although only slightly larger than the sand martin and brown-throated sand martin, <b>the</b> <b>pale</b> crag martin is more robust, has white tail spots, and lacks a breast band. Separation of similar species in flight may be complicated by the difficulty of judging colours accurately in strong desert light, particularly with juveniles. The fast flight of the brown-throated sand martin also makes identification more difficult.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>pale</b> {{crag martin}} was {{formerly}} often treated as the small, pale northern subspecies {{of the rock}} martin, but it is now usually {{considered to be a}} separate species. The changes in size and colour are continuous, so the evidence for separate species is not strong, although some rock martins can weigh {{more than twice as much}} as the smallest subspecies of <b>the</b> <b>pale</b> crag martin. The average weight for P.o.fusciventris is 22.4g (0.79oz) against 10g (0.35oz) for P.o.obsoleta. There do not appear to be any intermediate forms where pale crag martins and rock martin populations breed close to each other in Somalia and Ethiopia.|$|E
5|$|The small, pale {{northern}} subspecies of {{crag martin}} {{found in the}} mountains of North Africa and the Arabian peninsula is now usually split as <b>the</b> <b>pale</b> crag martin, Ptyonoprogne obsoleta. The remaining birds are now identified as Eurasian crag martin.|$|E
5|$|Aaronson {{was born}} on 18 February 1895 at 34 Great Pearl Street, Spitalfields in the East End of London to poor Orthodox Jewish parents who had immigrated from Vilna in <b>the</b> <b>Pale</b> of Settlement in Eastern Europe. His father was Louis Aaronson, a bootmaker, {{and his mother was}} Sarah Aaronson, née Kowalski. He {{attended}} Whitechapel City Boys' School and later received a scholarship to attend Hackney Downs grammar school.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 15th century central English {{authority}} in Ireland had all but disappeared and a renewed Irish culture and language, albeit with Norman influences, was dominant again. English Crown control remained relatively unshaken in an amorphous foothold around Dublin known as <b>The</b> <b>Pale,</b> and under the provisions of Poynings' Law of 1494, the Irish Parliamentary legislation was subject to the approval of the English Parliament.|$|E
5|$|His pale, heavy-boned face {{showed signs}} of sleeplessness.

There was a little cup of black coffee, absurdly delicate, beside his gnarled work-warped hand.|$|E
5|$|In 1172, {{following}} the subjugation of <b>the</b> <b>Pale</b> in Ireland, Henry II gave Bristolians {{the right to}} reside in and trade from Dublin.

It was a day without wind; not a ripple stirred the surface of the water; the soft gray clouds filled all the sky, and hid the sun from view.|$|R

50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 40 mm. The forewings vary from dark brown to black. On <b>the</b> <b>paler</b> specimens, {{a pattern of}} light and dark brown may be discernible. <b>The</b> hindwings are <b>pale</b> with wide black borders.|$|R
5|$|One reason {{senators}} {{were reluctant}} to remove the President was that his successor would have been Ohio Senator Wade, the president pro tempore of the Senate. Wade, a lame duck who left office in early 1869, was a Radical who supported such measures as women's suffrage, placing him beyond <b>the</b> <b>pale</b> politically {{in much of the}} nation. Additionally, a President Wade was seen as an obstacle to Grant's ambitions.|$|E
5|$|Ruthenium trichloride is a {{well-known}} compound, existing in a black α-form and a dark brown β-form: the trihydrate is red. Of the known trihalides, trifluoride is dark brown and decomposes above 650°C, tetrabromide is dark-brown and decomposes above 400°C, and triiodide is black. Of the dihalides, difluoride is not known, dichloride is brown, dibromide is black, and diiodide is blue. The only known oxyhalide is <b>the</b> <b>pale</b> green ruthenium(VI) oxyfluoride, RuOF4.|$|E
