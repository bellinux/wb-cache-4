The aim is to select equipment that can perform this procedure automatically while staying within the confines of a budget. The test requires synchronous jacking of train wheels and it was concluded from the research carried out that synchronous lifting of heavy objects can be successfully achieved through the use of ‘digital hydraulics’, a term explained in detail within this dissertation. The concept of digital hydraulics was tested for application to the <b>twist</b> <b>test</b> and was found to be completely successful.

30|$|Clinically, {{instability}} presents with intermittent nonspecific {{back pain}} that worsens with movement. A variety of imaging modalities are currently {{used to assess}} spinal instability. Conventional MRI and CT performed in the prone position provide limited information on the functional status of the affected segment as spondylolisthesis with instability may “self-reduce” without a normal axial load. These techniques can demonstrate indirect signs of instability, such {{as the presence of}} traction spurs, intradiscal vacuum phenomenon or ligamentum flavum hypertrophy. Functional modalities, such as kinetic MRI and flexion and extension radiographs, are effective ways to evaluate abnormal motions in the involved segment. For the lumbar spine, on flexion-extension radiographs values of 10 ° for sagittal rotation and 4  mm for sagittal translation are typically used to infer instability [17]. Specific criteria for the diagnosis of instability of the cervical spine have not yet been established: transitions from 1  mm to 3.5  mm on functional radiographs have been proposed in the literature [47], and a 3 -mm slippage appears to be a reliable cut-off. The CT <b>twist</b> <b>test</b> is obtained through the facet joint while the patient twists his/her body and the pelvis is tightly strapped to the CT table.

All testing {{was done on}} a fixture designed and fabricated by Pratt 2 ̆ 6 Miller Engineering and installed on an Instron testing system at Cal Poly. The <b>twist</b> <b>test</b> was performed by supporting diagonal corners of the plate while simultaneously loading the opposite two corners at a crosshead rate of. 06 in/min (ASTM 3044 - 94 R 11). Out of 10 panels tested, six were tested longitudinally, with the L direction of the honeycomb parallel {{to the front of}} the test plate, and four were tested in the transverse orientation, with the L direction of the honeycomb perpendicular {{to the front of the}} plate. The average compliance for the longitudinal loading was 1. 303 mil/lb, and the transverse loading was 1. 394 mil/lb. The panels failed with a combination core shear failure and face-to-core debonding. The anisotropic nature of the honeycomb core supports the difference in the compliance of the panels; however the complex loading of the <b>twist</b> <b>test</b> results the difference being not statistically significant.

40|$|The {{combination}} of autograft, BMP and bisphosphonate {{has been shown}} to produce strong calluses. In this study, without autograft we investigate the effect of bisphosphonate treatment on BMP-induced calluses, both in bending and in rotation. Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 42) underwent femoral osteotomy and BMP- 7 treatment. At 2 weeks an injection of saline or bisphosphonate was administered. The animals were sacrificed after 6 weeks. Both femurs were tested in either three-point bending or twisting. All femurs healed. BMP + bisphosphonate-treatment led to larger calluses (p < 0. 05) and in three-point bending, higher ultimate force (p < 0. 01) and greater stiffness (p < 0. 05) than BMP alone. The BMP + bisphosphonate group was nearly 60 % stronger than controls, while the BMP group did not reach the strength (p < 0. 05) nor stiffness (p < 0. 01) of the controls. In the <b>twisting</b> <b>test,</b> similar trends were found but less pronounced. Three-point bending produced transverse callus associated fractures, whereas the <b>twisting</b> <b>test</b> produced spiral fractures, located in the structurally weaker distal femur. BMP + bisphosphonate-treatment produces calluses that are mechanically superior to calluses induced by BMP alone, when tested both in three-point bending and in twisting. For the mechanical evaluation of pharmacologically enhanced calluses with breaking strengths exceeding the native bone, the bending test is recommended. © 2014 Orthopaedic Research Society.

40|$|AbstractCurrently {{grinding}} {{is commonly}} used as the finishing operation to manufacture seal mating surfaces and bearing surfaces, especially in the automotive industry. It would lead to more resource-efficient production if the cost- and energy-intensive grinding process could be replaced by machining with geometrically defined cutting edges, such as hard turning [1, 2]. However, turning operations usually cause a twist structure on the surface, which can convey lubricants like a pump. Several methods exist to overcome this problem, for example, tangential turning, rotation turning and turn broaching, etc. Due to {{the high costs of}} tools and special machines required by these methods, the industrial application is still limited. This paper describes a more efficient approach by applying a modified feed kinematic. When using this approach, hard turning produces twist-free surfaces. The results of the latest <b>twist</b> <b>test</b> methods have confirmed that the surfaces are free of twist, hence free of conveying effect of lubricant and that they are suitable for application in manufacturing of seal mating surfaces and bearing surfaces. Furthermore, this method requires only minimal investment in any turning machine...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{accurately}} identify fibres is {{of importance to}} conservators, but this can prove problematic when dealing with fibres which possess similar chemistry and microstructure - the bast fibres flax and hemp are particularly challenging in this regard. Conventional techniques such as microscopic examination, the measurement of fibre widths {{and the use of}} the <b>twist</b> <b>test,</b> will often prove unreliable, especially when dealing with degraded materials. This research has concentrated on the development of an attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectropscopic technique empolying polarized radiation to differentiate these two fibre types on the basis of the characteristic nature of the winding of their secondary cell walls: while the angle of fibrillar wind is roughly the same for both fibres (~ 7 º), the senses of wind are opposite - S (anti-clockwise) in the case of flax; Z (clockwise) for hemp. A crystallinity index, derived from the spectra, was found to vary in a systematic manner as the fibres were rotated with respect to the electric vector of the incident radiation. A good correlation between this variation and theoretical models was observed. It was found that the characteristic sense and angle of wind of the fibres could be determined, and thus hemp and flax distinguished...|$|E

However AZO film are too brittle and their resistivity is rather high in some cases compared to ITO, can not completely meet flexible optoelectronic device requirements. In this work, AZO (35 nm) /Ag(12 nm) /AZO (35 nm) films was deposited on polyethylene naphthalate using RF magnetron sputtering system at room temperature.

40|$|In this study, simple {{expressions}} for the, anistropic rigidities of orthogonally rib-stiffened {{reinforced concrete}} slab structures are presented. These expressions are valid for both, the pre-cracking and post-cracking stages of concrete, and are, therefore, applicable to reinforced {{as well as}} prestressed concrete structures. Bending and <b>twisting</b> <b>tests</b> on several orthogonally rib-stiffened reinforced concrete slab structures were conducted. The experimental results of <b>twisting</b> <b>tests</b> show that using shear reinforcement (stirrups) has {{a significant effect on}} increasing the pre-cracking and post-cracking torsional rigidities, so proposed equations for estimating these torsional rigidities were developed to properly account for the presence of stirrups. The experimental results of bending tests verify that using stirrups has no effect on both the pre-cracking and post-cracking flexural rigidities, so the existing equations for determining these flexural rigidities were not modified. The structural response of orthogonally rib-stiffened reinforced concrete slabs to loads was observed. It shows that using stirrups leads to ductile behavior of such structures. The experimental procedure and the necessary precautions that must be taken to help ensuring accurate results were discussed. The use of realistic estimates for the torsional constants of rib-stiffened reinforced concrete slab structures when using shear reinforcement will lead to better design as well as economy.

40|$|The Massey Twist Tester is an {{instrument}} developed {{to assess the}} texture of {{fresh fruit and vegetables}} rapidly. Since its original development in 1990, the Twist Tester has been modified extensively and numerous prototypes have been developed. In principle a small rectangular flat blade is rotated inside the fruit, and the torque required is measured. The current version incorporates a motor driven unit rotating inside a set of needles which hold the fruit firmly. Although measurements of fruit properties have been reported in previous studies, these have all been based on earlier designs, and no data on the new version of the Twist Tester have yet been published. The main aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the performance of the new version of the Twist Tester by comparing it to the standard penetrometer, which has been widely used in many parts of the world for several years. Samples of fruit and vegetables were stored in different conditions to vary the level of firmness in order to expose how well each instrument performed in detecting the changes of textural properties. Generally, both Twist Tester and Penetrometer readings declined with storage time. In the testing of Braeburn apples, the Twist Tester has highly correlated with storage time as compared to penetrometer, The Twist Tester and Texture Analyser produced results for the Royal Gala apples which were highly correlated with those obtained from the penetrometer, suggesting that this test could be used, as it is more reliable for determining the maturity of apples. For plums, the correlation of the Twister with storage time at three storage conditions were high (r = 0. 92, 0. 95 and 0. 92), compared to the correlated of penetrometer with storage time which was (r = 0. 83, 0. 44 and 0. 77). The penetrometer has a slightly higher degree of correlation with storage time for pears, compared to the Twist Tester. Pears declined in crushing strength and penetrometer readings with storage time, but over the last 7 days the value of firmness increased. The literature review showed that when water loss from the fruit is extreme, it forms a rubbery texture, produces a higher degree of firmness. Further research work would need to be done to obtain a more reliable result. The Twist Tester performed well in predicting the changes of textural properties of nashi, which showed a stronger correlation with storage time than the penetrometer relationship with storage time. During storage of kiwifruit, the penetrometer could not detect any changes after 14 days, while Twist Tester obtained a reliable result. This showed that penetrometer could not test the firmness of texture of any soft fruits. The relationship between the crushing strength and storage time produced a high coefficient in all three storage conditions (r = 0. 91, 0. 89, 0. 80) while the penetrometer readings showed the following correlations with storage time (r = 0. 77, 0. 76, 0. 44). Thus the Twist Tester can determine the maturity of kiwifruit as well as any soft tissue products. Changes in the textural properties of potatoes also were well detected by the Twist Tester, which showed a stronger correlation with storage time than did the penetrometer. Firmness and crispness as measured by both the Twist Tester and penetrometer readings were highly correlated, while other variables showed only a poor relationship with instrumental measurement. Further research is needed to improve these results by using a well-trained taste panel. Changing the speed of <b>Twist</b> <b>Test</b> has no significant effects on the crushing strength of fruit and vegetables within the range of 5 - 10 rpm. The Twist Tester is more accurate, easy to operate and may be used to determine the quality and maturity of a wider range of products than penetrometer...|$|E

40|$|A {{mechanical}} approach employing cyclic twisting deformation to {{a surface}} mount assembly is examined {{as an alternative}} to temperature cycling for evaluating solder joints fatigue performance. This highly accelerated test is aimed at reducing solder joint reliability testing cycle time. In this study, the mechanics of solder joints in a surface mount assembly subjected to cyclic twisting deformation is investigated. For this purpose, a test package with 24 by 24 peripheral-array solder joints is modeled using the finite element method. Unified inelastic strain theory defines the strain-rate-dependent plastic stress-strain response of the 60 Sn- 40 Pb solder. Cyclic twisting deformation in the range of Â± 1 Â° per 50 mm length of the assembly board at a rate of 120 s per twist cycle was applied. The calculated stress and strain distributions in the critical solder joint are compared with those predicted for temperature cycling and accelerated temperature cycling tests. Results showed that the accumulated inelastic strain concentrates in a small region of the critical solder joint near the component side for temperature cycling and near the board side for cyclic twisting load cases. The rate of inelastic strain accumulation per fatigue cycle in the solder joint for both temperature cycling (TC 1) and mechanical <b>twisting</b> (MT 1) <b>tests</b> are similar. Thus, mechanical <b>twisting</b> <b>test</b> imparts similar deformation characteristics to temperature cycling tests in terms of the shear strain range. Low cycle fatigue is dominated by localized shear effect as reflected in the largest shear strain range of the hysteresis loops.

40|$|Twisting {{monotonic}} {{and fatigue}} experiments {{were conducted on}} multi-layered films of Ag-alloy based indium tin oxide (ITO) deposited on polyethylene terephthalate (PET). In the <b>twisting</b> <b>tests,</b> crack development and electrical resistance were monitored in situ. Cracks initiated at an angle of 39 ° ± 1. 7 ° and propagated towards {{the direction of the}} sample length. Two sets of experiments were performed; the first set of experiments was conducted to study the effect of twisting angle and temperature on the film's electromechanical performance. The other set of experiments was conducted to study the effect of temperature in the absence of cyclic twisting deformation. The change in electrical resistance increased with number of twisting cycles and twisting angle. In addition, the highest change in electrical resistance was observed for samples subjected to cyclic fatigue at 100 °C, which is attributed to crack growth and oxidation of the Ag-alloy layer. The cracks were observed to initiate not only from coating defects but also from edge defects. Development of cracks is accelerated due to the combined effects of the external repeated stress and temperature. Therefore, it is suggested that controlling temperature when using ITO/Ag-alloy/ITO thin film under mechanical stress is important for electrical device performance; temperatures in both fabrication and use should not exceed 50 °C...|$|R
40|$|A {{compression}} test with rotating dies {{was employed to}} estimate the friction factor between aluminum samples and steel tooling during large plastic deformations. A cylindrical workpiece was compressed under dry and cold conditions. The magnitudes of torque and normal force were measured and the average friction factor was calculated using the Coulomb friction law. It was found that under certain conditions the friction increased with increasing angular velocity of the die. This finding led {{to the conclusion that}} the choice of die rotation speed is important in interpreting the results from the <b>twist</b> compression <b>test...</b>|$|R

It {{has been shown}} that warm twist extrusion results in grain refinement with conservation of a substantial part of high-angle boundaries, smearing of the texture, more homogeneous distribution of grains and development of the dynamic recrystallization processes.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{studies the}} {{conductivity}} of plain woven fabric of embedded silver-plated fibers of different twists. Five samples of different numbers of <b>twists</b> are <b>tested</b> under weft tensile. The results are the following: {{during the process}} of elongation, the resistance of fabric is bigger than the initial resistance, the rate of resistance change shows positive relationship with strain and presents a rising tendency generally; when the number of twists is 300 T/m, the rate of resistance change is bigger than other four fabrics under the same strain, the stability of changes of relative resistance of fabric is better than others; the rate of resistance change of fabric changes stably in the range of 0 %~ 15 % elongation...|$|R
