Virajas lost his desire to rule the earth after beholding Vishnu and became an ascetic. Virajas' son was Krittimat, who became an ascetic. Krittimat's son was Kardama. Kardama's son was Ananga and Ananga's son was Atibala. Atibala, also called Anga, conquered <b>the</b> <b>earth</b> <b>and</b> ruled well. Atibala married Mrityu's daughter, Sunita and had a son named Vena. Vena's son would be Prithu.|$|E

5|$|After {{the five}} heroine's routes are completed, the story shifts to a setting amid a ruined Kazamatsuri where Kotarou {{encounters}} Kagari {{in a world}} after re-evolution, still on the Moon. Kotarou {{at this point is}} a unified entity of all the Kotarous from all timelines where humanity was destroyed and he has memories of these events. The Moon's Kagari is trying to research a way so <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>and</b> humanity are not destroyed, and Kotarou attempts to buy her time while fighting a hoard of familiars summoned by Sakura Kashima of Gaia whose resolve is to annihilate humanity by killing Kagari. Kotarou and the entire cast rejoin together to protect Kagari, who manages to finish her plan to allow <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>and</b> humanity to coexist by sending the Moon's life force back to Earth. In the past, the Earth had sent this energy to the Moon so life could continue. There is just enough energy and resources left for a final re-evolution.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{intends to}} develop a method based on the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict permanent earthquake-induced deformation of <b>the</b> <b>earth</b> dams <b>and</b> embankments. For this purpose, data sets of observations from 152 published case histories {{on the performance of}} <b>the</b> <b>earth</b> dams <b>and</b> embankments, during the past earthquakes, was used. In order to predict earthquake-induced deformation of <b>the</b> <b>earth</b> dams <b>and</b> embankments a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) analysis was used. A four-layer, feed-forward, back-propagation neural network, with a topology of 7 - 9 - 7 - 1 was found to be optimum.

5|$|Earth's axis of {{rotation}} is tilted, producing seasonal variations on the planet's surface. The gravitational interaction between <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>and</b> Moon causes ocean tides, stabilizes the Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation.
