50|$|Metal oxide varistors {{typically}} have lower resistance as they heat up; if connected directly across a power bus, for protection against electrical transients, a varistor with a lowered <b>trigger</b> <b>voltage</b> can slide into catastrophic thermal runaway {{and sometimes a}} small explosion or fire.

50|$|It is {{possible}} to connect a high voltage triggering flash with a camera, which can only tolerate 5 or 6 volts, {{through the use of}} an adaptor containing the necessary voltage protection circuitry, typically using a high power TRIAC. Such adapters drain power from the flash's <b>trigger</b> <b>voltage</b> and therefore often do not need a power supply of their own.|$|E
50|$|Another older form of {{lightning}} arrestor employs a simple narrow spark gap, over which an arc will jump when a high voltage is present.

50|$|With the hot-shoe for {{external}} flash, the Powershot G series can accept not only compatible flash units but also various connecting cords and wireless triggers. However, the Powershot G series {{is sensitive to}} the voltage produced by certain flash units, particularly older designs.

50|$|If no {{potential}} difference exists between its emitter and either of its base leads, {{there is an}} extremely small current (flow of charge) from B1 to B2. On the other hand, if an adequately large voltage relative to its base leads, known as the <b>trigger</b> <b>voltage,</b> is applied to its emitter, then a very large current from its emitter joins the current from B1 to B2, which creates a larger B2 output current.|$|E
5000|$|Metal oxide varistors {{typically}} develop lower resistance as they heat up. If connected {{directly across}} an AC or DC power bus (a common usage for protection against electrical transients), a MOV which {{has developed a}} lowered <b>trigger</b> <b>voltage</b> can slide into catastrophic thermal runaway, possibly culminating in a small explosion or fire. [...] To prevent this possibility, fault current is typically limited by a thermal fuse, circuit breaker, or other current limiting device.|$|E
50|$|Some {{electronic}} components develop lower resistances or lower <b>triggering</b> <b>voltages</b> (for nonlinear resistances) as their internal temperature increases. If circuit conditions cause markedly increased current flow in these situations, increased power dissipation may raise the temperature further by Joule heating. A vicious circle or positive feedback effect of thermal runaway can cause failure, sometimes in a spectacular fashion (e.g. electrical explosion or fire). To prevent these hazards, well-designed electronic systems typically incorporate current limiting protection, such as thermal fuses, circuit breakers, or PTC current limiters.|$|R
5000|$|For two {{terminal}} devices (such as diodes and DIACs), this {{is sufficient to}} fully characterize the device. The curve tracer can display all of the interesting parameters such as the diode's forward voltage, reverse leakage current, reverse breakdown voltage, and so on. For triggerable devices such as DIACs, the forward and reverse <b>trigger</b> <b>voltages</b> will be clearly displayed. The discontinuity caused by negative resistance devices (such as tunnel diodes) can also be seen. This is a method for finding electrically damaged pins on integrated circuit devices.|$|R
50|$|A gas {{discharge}} tube (GDT) is a sealed glass-enclosed device containing a special gas mixture trapped between two electrodes, which conducts electric current after becoming ionized by a high voltage spike. GDTs can conduct more current for their size than other components. Like MOVs, GDTs have a finite life expectancy, and can handle a few very large transients or {{a greater number of}} smaller transients. The typical failure mode occurs when the <b>triggering</b> <b>voltage</b> rises so high that the device becomes ineffective, although lightning surges can occasionally cause a dead short.|$|R
50|$|An {{internal}} camera circuit shorts {{the center}} contact and shoe mount, thus triggering the flash. The <b>trigger</b> <b>voltage</b> (for a flash) between the center contact and the shoe has varied over the years, between manufacturers, {{and even in}} the same manufacturer. When the contacts with a shutter were mechanical contacts, the actual voltage and polarity did not matter too much as long as it did not cause arcing, but now with electronic triggering, either or both can cause problems.|$|E
50|$|TRIACs {{resemble}} SCRs in {{that they}} both act as electrically controlled switches. Unlike SCRs, TRIACS can pass current in either direction. Thus, TRIACs are particularly useful for AC applications. TRIACs have three leads: a gate lead and two conducting leads, referred to as MT1 and MT2. If no current/voltage {{is applied to the}} gate lead, the TRIAC switches off. On the other hand, if the <b>trigger</b> <b>voltage</b> is applied to the gate lead, the TRIAC switches on.|$|E
50|$|While {{the most}} common problem {{adapting}} flash equipment to cameras is an excessive <b>trigger</b> <b>voltage,</b> sometimes the trigger circuit voltages provided by some modern flashes or radio triggers can also be too low {{to ensure that the}} electronic triggering circuits in the camera or receiver can still reliable trigger it. Trigger circuit voltages below ca. 2 to 2.5 volts may exhibit this problem, unless the triggering circuit is specifically designed to continue to work with such low voltages as well.|$|E
40|$|The {{reduction}} of breakdown voltage of a trigatron air-gap {{is related to}} the charge and energy of the triggering spark.

50|$|The ISO 10330 {{specification}} {{allows for}} a <b>trigger</b> <b>voltage</b> of 24 volts. Some manufacturers, particularly Canon, ask {{for no more than}} 6 volts. Some older flashes may have significantly high voltages, sometimes in the several hundreds of volts. Some of them may also use negative DC polarity, and some studio flashes may even provide AC voltages. Whilst no problem for electromechanical trigger contacts in older cameras, not all electronically controlled trigger circuits in newer cameras are designed to work with inverse DC polarity or AC.|$|E

50|$|Three-terminal {{devices such}} as {{transistors}} and FETs also use {{a connection to the}} control terminal of the device being tested such as the Base or Gate terminal. For transistors and other current based devices, the base or other control terminal current is stepped. For field effect transistors, a stepped voltage is used instead. By sweeping the voltage through the configured range of main terminal voltages, for each voltage step of the control signal, a group of V-I curves is generated automatically. This group of curves makes it very easy to determine the gain of a transistor, or the <b>trigger</b> <b>voltage</b> of a thyristor or TRIAC.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of pulse-switching vibration control technique is investigated {{using a new}} method for switching sequence, {{in order to enhance}} the vibration damping. The control law in this method which was developed in the field of piezoelectric damping is based on triggering the inverting switch on each extremum of the produced voltage (or displacement); however, its efficiency in the case of random excitation is arguable because of the local extremum detection process. The new proposed method for switching sequence is only {{based on the fact that}} the <b>triggering</b> <b>voltage</b> level was determined using windowed statistical examination of the deflection signal.

50|$|This example can be {{implemented}} with a capacitive or resistive-capacitive integrating circuit driven respectively by a constant current or voltage source, and a threshold device with hysteresis (neon lamp, thyratron, diac, reverse-biased bipolar transistor, or unijunction transistor) connected in parallel to the capacitor. The capacitor is charged by the input source causing the voltage across the capacitor to rise. The threshold device does not conduct at all until the capacitor voltage reaches its threshold (<b>trigger)</b> <b>voltage.</b> It then increases heavily its conductance in an avalanche-like manner because of the inherent positive feedback, which quickly discharges the capacitor. When the voltage across the capacitor drops to some lower threshold voltage, the device stops conducting and the capacitor begins charging again, and the cycle repeats ad infinitum.|$|E
5000|$|Flashtubes {{operate at}} high voltages, with {{currents}} {{high enough to}} be deadly. Under certain conditions, shocks as low as 1 joule {{have been reported to}} be lethal. The energy stored in a capacitor can remain surprisingly long after power has been disconnected. A flashtube will usually shut down before the capacitor has fully drained, and it may regain part of its charge through a process called [...] "dielectric absorption". In addition, some types of charging system can be equally deadly themselves. The <b>trigger</b> <b>voltage</b> can deliver a painful shock, usually not enough to kill, but which can often startle a person into bumping or touching something more dangerous. When a person is charged to high voltages a spark can jump, delivering the high capacitor current without actually touching anything.|$|E
50|$|The analog {{channels}} {{were read}} by sending voltage into the line, through a potentiometer in the controller, {{in this case}} 100,000 ohm, and then into a capacitor. The value was read by timing {{how long it took}} for the voltage in the capacitor to cross a certain threshold. The rate varied depending on the resistance, and thus physical position, of the potentiometer. In the Atari port, which had similar analog channels, there was a convenient timer available {{in the form of the}} video clock circuitry. In the PC there was no similar clock because video functionality normally provided on an expansion card. Instead, these timers were provided by a separate chip that combined the voltage readers and timers. When the <b>trigger</b> <b>voltage</b> was reached, the resulting value was copied into a register where it could be read out at any time. The value was being constantly updated by the hardware, but it was up to the software application to poll the value often enough for smooth movement.|$|E

50|$|An {{alternative}} construction uses two capacitors connected as a Blumlein generator. Two capacitors {{are connected}} {{so that one}} plate is a common earth, the others are each connected to the spark gap electrodes. These capacitors are often constructed from a single layer of printed circuit board, or similar stack of copper foil and thin dielectric. The capacitors are linked through an inductor, a simple air-spaced coil. One capacitor also has a small spark gap across it. When HT is applied, the two capacitors are charged slowly, effectively linked by the inductor. When the spark gap reaches its <b>triggering</b> <b>voltage,</b> it discharges and quickly reduces that capacitor's voltage to zero. As the discharge is rapid, the inductor acts as an open circuit and so the voltage difference across the transverse spark gap (between the two capacitors) rises rapidly until the main spark gap discharges, firing the laser.|$|R
