5|$|Coal is now {{delivered}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>station</b> mainly using {{rail transport}} and is unloaded {{at the station}} using a merry-go-round system.

These passenger services ceased in 1964, and now the line is only used to serve the power station and smelter. Coal from the local opencast mines is brought <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>station</b> by road using heavy goods vehicles. Coal is graded and washed at the station prior to being burned.|$|E
