5|$|The villanelle {{written by}} Stephen Dedalus, {{the protagonist of}} James Joyce's novel A Portrait of <b>the</b> <b>Artist</b> <b>as</b> a Young Man. It {{has been the subject}} of several {{critical}} analyses.|$|E
5|$|On 7 January 1904 Joyce {{attempted}} to publish A Portrait of the Artist, an essay-story dealing with aesthetics, {{only to have}} it rejected by the free-thinking magazine Dana. He decided, on his twenty-second birthday, to revise the story into a novel he called Stephen Hero. It was a fictional rendering of Joyce's youth, but he eventually grew frustrated with its direction and abandoned this work. It was never published in this form, but years later, in Trieste, Joyce completely rewrote it as A Portrait of <b>the</b> <b>Artist</b> <b>as</b> a Young Man. The unfinished Stephen Hero was published after his death.|$|E
5|$|A Portrait of <b>the</b> <b>Artist</b> <b>as</b> a Young Man is {{a nearly}} {{complete}} rewrite {{of the abandoned}} novel Stephen Hero. Joyce attempted to burn the original manuscript {{in a fit of}} rage during an argument with Nora, though to his subsequent relief it was rescued by his sister. A Künstlerroman, Portrait is a heavily autobiographical coming-of-age novel depicting the childhood and adolescence of protagonist Stephen Dedalus and his gradual growth into artistic self-consciousness. Some hints of the techniques Joyce frequently employed in later works, such as stream of consciousness, interior monologue, and references to a character's psychic reality rather than to his external surroundings are evident throughout this novel.|$|E

5|$|In 1939 The Map of Love {{appeared}} {{as a collection of}} 16 poems and seven of the 20 short stories published by Thomas in magazines since 1934. Ten stories in his next book, Portrait of <b>the</b> <b>Artist</b> <b>as</b> a Young Dog (1940), were based less on lavish fantasy than The Map of Love and more on real-life romances featuring himself in Wales. Sales of both books were poor, resulting in Thomas living on meagre fees from writing and reviewing. At this time he borrowed heavily from friends and acquaintances. Hounded by creditors, Thomas and his family left Laugharne in July 1940 and moved to the home of critic John Davenport in Marshfield, Gloucestershire. There Thomas collaborated with Davenport on the satire The Death of the King's Canary, though due to fears of libel the work was not published until 1976.|$|E
5|$|Rakoto's {{opportunity}} for national fame arrived with the 1958 visit of French President Charles de Gaulle to Madagascar. The visit was {{in conjunction with}} the dissolution of colonial status and naming of Philibert Tsiranana as Prime Minister, part of the island's transition to full independence in 1960. Tsiranana had previously seen the flutist perform and invited Rakoto and his group of 18musicians to accompany de Gaulle and perform traditional pieces during a portion of the French statesman's walking tour through the capital city of Antananarivo. Following this performance, Rakoto dedicated himself full-time to a career in music, performing regularly at traditional celebrations on the island. Tsiranana, who became president of Madagascar two years later, was the first to refer to <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>as</b> Rakoto Frah, the name that the musician would use {{for the rest of his}} career.|$|E
5|$|Thomas was an {{accomplished}} writer of prose poetry, with collections such as Portrait of <b>the</b> <b>Artist</b> <b>as</b> a Young Dog (1940) and Quite Early One Morning (1954) showing {{he was capable}} of writing moving short stories. His first published prose work was After the Fair, printed in The New English Weekly on 15 March 1934. Jacob Korg believes that Thomas's fiction work can be classified into two main bodies, vigorous fantasies in a poetic style and, after 1939, more straightforward narratives. Korg surmises that Thomas approached his prose writing as an alternate poetic form, which allowed him to produce complex, involuted narratives that do not allow the reader to rest.|$|E

2500|$|Fra Angelico (born Guido di Pietro; February 18, 1455) was an Early Italian Renaissance painter {{described}} by Vasari in his Lives of <b>the</b> <b>Artists</b> <b>as</b> having [...] "a rare and perfect talent".|$|R
5|$|In the {{opinions}} then current at the Royal Academy and among critics, {{the most prestigious}} form of painting was considered history painting, in which an artwork illustrated a story. It was thought that such works enabled British artists to show themselves as equal or even superior to those European artists active at the time, {{as well as to}} the Old Masters. Other forms of painting such as portraiture and landscapes were considered lesser styles, as they did not give <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>as</b> much opportunity to illustrate a story but instead were simply depictions of reality. Nonetheless, even the most eminent artists would often devote time to portrait painting, as portraits were generally commissioned by the subjects or their families, providing a guaranteed source of income to the artist; two of the first three presidents of the Royal Academy (Joshua Reynolds and Sir Thomas Lawrence) had made their names as portrait painters. Owing to a lack of patrons willing to commission history paintings, by the early 19th century history painting in England was in serious decline.|$|E
5|$|Pound's {{editorial}} {{choices were}} {{based on what he}} saw as the degree of sympathy that these writers displayed with Imagist precepts, rather than active participation in a group as such. Williams, who was based in the United States, had not participated in any of the discussions of the Eiffel Tower group. However, he and Pound had long been corresponding {{on the question of the}} renewal of poetry along similar lines. Ford was included at least partly because of his strong influence on Pound, as the younger poet made the transition from his earlier, Pre-Raphaelite-influenced style towards a harder, more modern way of writing. The inclusion of a poem by Joyce, I Hear an Army, which was sent to Pound by W.B. Yeats, took on a wider importance in the history of literary modernism, as the subsequent correspondence between the two led to the serial publication, at Pound's behest, of A Portrait of <b>the</b> <b>Artist</b> <b>as</b> a Young Man in The Egoist. Joyce's poem is not written in free verse, but in rhyming quatrains. However, it strongly reflects Pound's interest in poems written to be sung to music, such as those by the troubadours and Guido Cavalcanti. The book met with little popular or critical success, at least partly because it had no introduction or commentary to explain what the poets were attempting to do, and a number of copies were returned to the publisher.|$|E

25|$|In 1966, Andrei Tarkovsky made a film Andrei Rublev, {{loosely based}} on the artist's life.

25|$|Belvedere College is the {{backdrop}} for much of James Joyce's novel A Portrait of <b>the</b> <b>Artist</b> <b>as</b> a Young Man.

In the book Joyce mentions {{his involvement in the}} College Opera which continues today. The College's Dramatic Society performs four times during the academic year.|$|E

25|$|At club level, Magee {{represented}} Bective Rangers, and it {{is recorded}} that at a club meeting in 1903 that he suggested the team should change strip colours to rose, green and white; the colours that the team still play in.

25|$|Pieneman's {{painting}} was already known to Saleh, {{and he may}} have known <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>as</b> well. Saleh was also likely inspired by history painters, particularly Louis Gallait; Krauss finds similarities between Gallait's The Abdication of Charles V and Saleh's depiction of Diponegoro's arrest. The artist's use of colour is reminiscent of the nature works by Horace Vernet and Eugène Delacroix, both of whom Saleh was familiar with, and De Kock's pose appears to have been influenced by Italian Renaissance paintings.|$|E
25|$|Oesterheld was {{influenced}} by anti-war authors, such as Erich Maria Remarque, Stephen Crane or Leo Tolstoy; {{as well as by}} the career of the mentioned Ernie Pyle. Pratt also revealed that he stole more than four hundred of war photos from the staff of Il Gazzettino di Venezia, which were used by <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>as</b> inspiration for the comic strip. Oesterheld was also influenced by those photos, and many stories were inspired by specific photos that led the author to develop a story about them.|$|E
