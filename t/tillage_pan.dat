40|$|A 2 -year {{field study}} {{evaluated}} {{the influence of}} subsoiling and nematicide application, alone and in combination, on the growth and yield of field corn in a sandy soil in north-central Florida. The field had a 25 - 30 -cm-deep <b>tillage</b> <b>pan</b> (plowpan) and was infested with Belonolaimus longicaudatus, Hoplolaimus galeatus, Trichodorus christei, and Pratylenchus spp. Subsoiling increased corn yield both years, and the residual effect of subsoiling {{in the first year}} increased yields in the second year. Preplant application of DD injected in-row increased yields and reduced nematode populations. At-planting applications of DD injected in-row and carbofuran in-furrow or in a band were less effective than subsoiling in increasing yields and reducing nematode numbers. Interactions between subsoiling and nematicide treatments occurred in the second year...|$|E
40|$|A {{field trial}} was {{conducted}} for 2 years in an Arredondo fine sand containing a <b>tillage</b> <b>pan</b> at 15 - 20 cm deep {{to determine the}} influence of subsoiling on the distribution of corn roots and plant-parasitic nematodes. Soil samples were taken at various depths and row positions at 30, 60, and 90 days after planting in field corn subsoiled under the row with two chisels and in non-subsoiled corn. At 30 and 60 days, in-row nematode population densities to 60 cm deep were not affected by subsoiling compared with population densities in nonsubsoiled plots. After 90 days, subsoiling had not affected total root length or root weight at the 20 depth-row position sampling combinations, but population densities of Meloidogyne incognita and Criconemella spp. had increased in subsoiled corn. Numbers of Pratylenchus zeae were not affected. Subsoiling generally resulted in a change in distribution of corn roots and nematodes in the soil profile but caused little total increase in either roots or numbers of nematodes. Corn yield was increased by subsoiling...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAgricultural use of soils implies tillage {{and often}} {{compaction}} and therefore influences processes on soil surface and affects infiltration {{of water into}} the subsoil. Although many studies on soil surface processes or flow patterns in soils exist, works relating both are rare in literature. We did two tracer experiments with Brilliant Blue FCF on a tilled and compacted plot and a non-tilled one to investigate water storage on the soil surface during simulated rainfall and changes of soil microtopography, to analyse the associated flow patterns in the soil and to relate both to tillage and compaction. Our results show that storage was larger on the tilled and compacted plot than on the non-tilled one. After tillage, transport processes above the plough pan were partly disconnected from those underneath because macropores were disrupted and buried by the tillage operation. However, preferential flow along cracks occurred on both plots and the macropores buried below the <b>tillage</b> <b>pan</b> still functioned as preferential flow paths. Therefore, we conclude that the studied soil is susceptible to deep vertical solute propagation at dry conditions when cracks are open, irrespective of tillage and compaction.

40|$|Tillage {{interrupts}} {{natural processes}} in the soil. The greater the difference between man-made and natural state the heavier is the stress on soil biological activities. An intervention deforming the soil structure will have {{both positive and negative}} impacts on plants. Heavier negative impacts may cause stress. Tillageinduced compaction is an abnormal change in the soil structure causing stress both directly and indirectly. Until recent years scientists knew more about compaction than did farmers, who tended to explain losses by referring to adverse weather conditions. Research is now underway in two directions: studying soil state in soil quality trials and monitoring selected fields in 67 districts. In the course of our research we have been studying some climatic, edaphic and tillage stress factors. This paper comprises an evaluation of certain impacts of <b>tillage</b> <b>pans</b> on the soil (structure) and plants (root zone depth). One important finding is proof of structure degradation in the wake of interventions that {{have a negative impact on}} the soil biological activity along with proof of structure improvement in the wake of tillage causing as little stress as possible. Compaction was found to be a stressor limiting water transport and aggregation in the soil and aggravating damage caused by drought and waterlogging alike. Plants responded to compaction stress in terms of weakened emergence, deficient nutrient and water uptake, root deformation, and low yields...|$|R
40|$|Dense soil <b>tillage</b> <b>pans</b> {{can develop}} from the {{improper}} use of tillage tools. The influence of compacted layers or pans on plant growth and development, although much studied, is not clearly understood. This greenhouse experiment evaluated {{the influence of}} uniformly compacted soil and thin layers of compacted soil placed at various depths on early growth of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Artificially compacted soil [Alliance silt loam, Aridic Argiustoll (Eluviated Brown Chernozem); A horizon] profiles were constructed in polyvinyl chloride tubes of 150 -mm diameter by 350 mm long. Treatments were: (1) uniformly noncompacted (bulk density 1. 30 Mg m- 3) soil; (2) uniformly compacted (bulk density 1. 80 Mg m- 1) soil; (3) a compacted (bulk density 1. 80 Mg m- 3) soil layer at 100 - to 120 -mm depth with the remaining soil noncompacted (bulk density 1. 30 Mg m- 3); or (4) a compacted (bulk density 1. 80 Mg m- 3) soil layer at 180 - to 200 -mm depth with the remaining soil noncompacted (bulk density 1. 30 Mg m- 3). Generally, winter wheat grown in cores that were uniformly compacted or compacted in the upper layer responded similarly. Plant height, {{at the end of}} the experiment (32 d after planting), for the uniformly compacted and upper compacted layer treatments was 280 mm, compared to 323 mm for the control (uniformly noncompacted). Leaf area development was similar to the response indicated for plant height throughout the growth period. Root mass and length tended to be less in layered or compacted soil than in noncompacted soil. Roots accumulated within or immediately above compacted soil layers. Higher bulk density or a shallow compacted layer produced winter wheat with reduced height, leaf area, and dry matter compared with soil of normal density or with a deeper compacted layer...|$|R
40|$|In Italy, {{there has}} been a {{significant}} increase of the areas cultivated with short-rotation forestry (SRF) poplar (Populus spp.) for the production of lignocellulosic biomass. This species has been generally introduced on soils managed with conventional farming practices that {{led to the formation of}} a hardpan. This constitutes a serious obstacle for root development and water availability, which affect the successful establishment of the plantation. To this end the Unit of Agricultural Engineering of the Agricultural Research Council (CRA-ING) has developed a new system for reduced tillage (RT), to be used during the establishment of SRF poplar. This new system aims at breaking the <b>tillage</b> <b>pan</b> and at reducing both traffic intensity and site preparation cost. A new machine has been developed, which is based on a commercial rotary plough, suitably modified by adding a shank subsoiler. This machine can perform both deep soil ripping and surface ploughing in a single pass, treating narrow strips where poplar cuttings are to be planted. The study compared conventional tillage (CT) with RT, showing that latter allowed a dramatic reduction of the number of field operations and of all related problems, while creating better conditions for poplar rooting without meaningful effects on yield...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1989 The {{effects of}} five tillage {{treatments}} on soil bulk density and mechanical impedance were examined on Newburg sandy loam {{soil in the}} Willamette Valley, Oregon, in 1987. Subsequent effects on seedling emergence and yield of carrots (Daucus carota L., cvs. Orlando Gold and Royal Chantenay) were also measured. Mechanical impedance was recorded on three dates at 2. 5 -cm intervals {{to a depth of}} 44 cm with a hydraulically driven penetrometer. A <b>tillage</b> <b>pan</b> often prevented penetration of the penetrometer beyond 35 cm. Soil cores were collected, on the days of penetrometer measurements, at three depths to measure bulk density and water content. Early season mechanical impedance at soil depths less than 23 cm was less in reduced tillage treatments than in conventional or excessive tillage treatments. Subsoiling before tillage resulted in less mechanical impedance at depths between 23 and 35 cm. Differences in mechanical impedance between treatments diminished later in the season {{to the point of being}} nonsignificant. Because of soil variability and the limited number of soil cores taken, bulk density differences between treatments were not significant for any of the dates. In both carrot cultivars, total yields were not significantly affected by tillage. Size distribution of roots (by diameter) was affected, with reduced tillage producing smaller diameter carrots. This was most likely a result of the slightly higher, though nonsignificant, number of seedlings emerged in the reduced tillage treatment. Seedling emergence of both cultivars had a moderate negative correlation with soil mechanical impedance at 5 cm...|$|E
40|$|Drylands {{occupied}} {{a large area}} of lands on Earth and {{a large percentage of}} the population are living in these areas. Land degradation or desertification is one of the biggest problems in arid zones. In general, little effort for mapping land degradation at regional to global scales has been made. Recent efforts to assess desertification in Iran led to devise the Iranian Model of Desertification Potential Assessment or IMDPA. In this article we intend to consider the concerns of international models of desertification, re-evaluate the Iranian Model of Desertification Potential Assessment in the East of Esfahan and Studies carried out on this model till now to review and to evaluate indicators of the soil, vegetation and erosion in the IMDPA. Our aim in this paper is to clarify many of the black spots of desertification in Iran, we're going to show where to start and what to expect on a study of desertification. In this study, water, soil and vegetation indicators and their indices in 172 homogeneous work units were assessed using the instruction of IMDPA, and the results were compared with a study done in the 90 s. According to land degradation and desertification studies we propose a model as " Iranian Model of Desertification Status Assessment " or IMDSA be created in which the three indicators of land degradation, namely the degradation of soil, vegetation and water can be used on it. According to our study, to indicate soil degradation state, the four indices of <b>Tillage</b> <b>Pan,</b> Infiltration, Aggregate Size Distribution and Score of EC and to evaluate vegetation degradation status, the four indices of Alien Invasive or proliferous weed species, Biomass decline, Bare Spots, and proportion of useful species for use in the Iranian Model of Desertification Status Assessment were appropriate...|$|E
40|$|Winter wheat (TriTcum aestivum L.) is sown {{as deep as}} 20 cm {{below the}} summer fallow soil surface in dry years in the {{semiarid}} Pacific North-west (PNW). Many growers pack the summer fallow mulch in late Au-gust before seeding winter wheat to improve stand establishment. But packing may increase blowing dust, which is a major soil loss and air quality concern. A 2 -yr study was conducted on two silt loam soil types in 280 mm and 230 mm average annual precipitation zones in eastern Whington to determine the agronomic benefits and potential wind ero-sion hazards associated with packing. Igcking a loose, thick surface mulch increased soil bulk density (RD) between the 5 - to 12 -cm depth. This significantly benefited wheat seedling emergence and stand estab-lishment, which subsequently increased grain yield 9 % over nonpacked plots. But packing a soil with a thin mulch layer overlying a high BD <b>tillage</b> <b>pan</b> {{had no effect on}} soil BD, wheat seedling emergence, or grain yield. Packing rendered the soil more vulnerable to wind erosion at both locations by reducing soil clod mass 55 % and surface residue 38 % com-pared with not packing. There are agronomic benefits from packing summer fallow mulch before seeding, but packing should be practiced judiciously, and not considered when surface midue or soil clods are lacking. This is especially true for poorly aggregated coarse-textured soils where soil structure is diflBcult to maintain. S TAND ESTABLISHMENT is the most important single fac- tor affecting wheat yields under dryland conditions in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) (Bolton, 1983). Early es-tablishment of winter wheat on summer-fallowed soils in low (< 300 rnrn annual) precipitation areas of the PNW is frequently limited by insufficient seedzone water. In most years, soil water content is adequate for germination and establishment just below the firm layer created by rod-weeders (Pikul et al., 1985). Rodweeders are typicall...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{structure}} can {{be strongly}} damaged by compaction which derives from compressive forces of wheels and tillage machinery applied to soils under farming systems. Compaction process alters the spatial arrangement, {{size and shape}} of clods and aggregates. As a consequence, the soil bulk density and the soil strength increase and the soil functioning is severely disturbed with a reduction in permeability to air, water and heat which in turn affects environmental quality, root and shoot growth and consequently crop production. Compaction causes a restriction in root penetration and rooting depth, an increase in root diameter and a reduction in water and nutrient uptake. However the responses in rooting stress and then in plant growth to compaction are controversial. They depend on the degree of compaction, its depth and persistence both laterally and vertically, on the texture of soils and their capacity to transfer water and more on weather conditions. Indeed, the crop production is strongly influenced by water stocks invested by roots. It was also observed that roots are preferentially confined to macropores as earthworm’s galleries, voids, cracks, bypassing generally compacted clods with a clump effect in loose soil. For high rainfall intensity, it results in preferential water flow which may supply enough water to plants. In addition compaction damage is not irreversible. As a result of climate activity, soil cracking through wetting and drying, fauna activity, compacted clods may progressively break down with decreasing soil impedance and changing in water retention and flow. Given the above mentioned debate, the objective {{of this study was to}} examine in space and time at high resolution the eventual changes in water content and soil structure of cropped soil as compared to bare soil after a prior compaction by in-field wheel traffic. Our study focused on the growing season of wheat crop. From in-field experiment, a precise time monitoring of water content and soil structure was analysed at the soil profile scale on a loamy-clay soil. The methods used to estimate both variables consisted in local soil sampling and visual morphological descriptions supplemented by Electrical Resistivity Tomographies (ERT), which have already been proven to be useful and efficient enough to describe soil water changes and the structural variability in soils. Our results enhanced the relevant impact of compaction on water transfer and, therefore, on availability of water reserves for plants. Compacted zones created by wheel tracks and the <b>tillage</b> <b>pan</b> restricted root penetration and remained wetter than the loosen matrix. However these results depend on climatic events. As observed after rainfalls, reduced infiltration due to compaction was overcome by preferential flow pathways identified at borders of clods where roots were relatively clumped. In addition, the ploughpan was shown to be a restrictive layer for water flow. These combined effects modified in time water stocks in the rooting zone as well as the structural resilience of clods...|$|E
