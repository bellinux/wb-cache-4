5|$|UPMC Susquehanna Lock Haven {{hospital}} is a 77-bed {{hospital with a}} 120-bed extended-care unit. It offers inpatient, outpatient, and 24-hour emergency services with heliport access. Susque-View Home, next to the hospital, offers long-term care <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> and other services including speech, physical, and occupational therapy for people of all ages. A 10-physician community-practice clinic based in the city provides primary care and specialty services. A behavioral health clinic offers programs for children and adolescents and psychiatric outpatient care for all ages.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by {{the orphanage}} staff {{who thought that}} Monroe would be happier living in a family, Grace became her legal {{guardian}} in 1936, although she {{was not able to}} take her out of the orphanage until the summer of 1937. Monroe's second stay with the Goddards lasted only a few months, as Doc molested her. After staying with various of her and Grace's relatives and friends in Los Angeles and Compton, Monroe found a more permanent home in September 1938, when she began living with Grace's aunt, Ana Atchinson Lower, in the Sawtelle district. She was enrolled in Emerson Junior High School and was taken to weekly Christian Science services with Lower. While otherwise a mediocre student, Monroe excelled in writing and contributed to the school's newspaper. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> Lower's health issues, Monroe returned to live with the Goddards in Van Nuys in either late 1940 or early 1941. After graduating from Emerson, she began attending Van Nuys High School.|$|E
30|$|The {{remaining}} 48 {{items were}} grouped into six domains. These domains {{are consistent with}} <b>the</b> literature or <b>elderly</b> reality, because they involve aspects related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Elderly’s</b> life that interfere in their quality of life. Paschoal (2011) noted that family, health aspects, physical independence, autonomy and religiousness, among other factors, interfere in <b>the</b> <b>elderly’s</b> perception of quality of life.|$|R

5|$|Some {{parts of}} Western Europe, {{especially}} Scandinavian {{countries have been}} creating family friendly policies that have aided them in equalizing the gender difference in {{participation in the work}} force. Nordic countries have the highest female participation rates in the work force in the world and salary differences are among the lowest. Government aid in providing care <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> and the young have enabled women in Scandinavia {{to be a part of}} the working population in nearly a high rate as men. Examples of government aid include paid parental leave and benefits and post maternity re-entry programs. Such programs have led to a greater participation of women in the workforce, as well as a higher birth rate, and a robust economy.|$|E
5|$|The Echo has won {{numerous}} accolades, as well {{as government}} praise, for its campaigning journalism, specialist writing, community work, photographic images and appeals for good causes over the decades. Examples of notable writing include a 2006 campaign highlighting {{the threat posed by}} bogus callers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> and a 2005 campaign to protect 999 crews from being attacked on duty, which both received official praise in Parliament. A 1996 drug education campaign, which included the creation of a telephone service for tip-offs about suspected local drug dealers, was also highly praised. The Newspaper Society named the Echo as its Campaigning Newspaper of the Year for the Drug Busters drive, and the campaign also won an award from the International Newspaper Marketing Association.|$|E
5|$|The {{first three}} lairds {{transformed}} the estate into a valuable asset. Lord Pitfour, the second laird, purchased additional lands including Deer Abbey and Inverugie Castle. Pitfour's son, James Ferguson, {{who became the}} third laird, continued to improve and expand the estate by adding the lake and bridges, and establishing planned villages. The third laird died a bachelor with no children, so the estate passed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> George Ferguson, who was only in possession of the property for a few months. George was already a wealthy man, owning lands in Trinidad and Tobago, but despite not directly improving the Pitfour estate he added considerable value to the inheritance passed to his illegitimate son. The extravagant lifestyles of the fifth and sixth lairds led to the sequestration of the estate, which was sold off piecemeal to pay their debts.|$|E

5|$|The older {{stations}} on the North South and East West {{lines were}} originally built with no accessibility facilities, such as lifts, ramps, tactile guidance systems (Braille tactiles {{on the floor}} surface), wider fare gates, or toilets for passengers with disabilities; authorities in the past actively discouraged use of their system by the disabled. Now, these facilities are being progressively installed {{as part of a}} programme to make all stations accessible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> and to those with disabilities. All stations are now barrier-free, although works are still ongoing to provide stations with additional barrier-free facilities. The installation of lifts at pedestrian overhead bridges next to six MRT stations and additional bicycle racks at 20 stations is slated to be completed by the end of 2013.|$|E
5|$|The {{benefits}} of benzodiazepines are least {{and the risks}} are greatest in the elderly. The elderly are at {{an increased risk of}} dependence and are more sensitive to the adverse effects such as memory problems, daytime sedation, impaired motor coordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls, and an increased risk of hip fractures. The long-term effects of benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine dependence in the elderly can resemble dementia, depression, or anxiety syndromes, and progressively worsens over time. Adverse effects on cognition can be mistaken for the effects of old age. The {{benefits of}} withdrawal include improved cognition, alertness, mobility, reduced risk incontinence, and a reduced risk of falls and fractures. The success of gradual-tapering benzodiazepines is as great in the elderly as in younger people. Benzodiazepines should be prescribed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> only with caution and only for a short period at low doses. Short to intermediate-acting benzodiazepines are preferred in the elderly such as oxazepam and temazepam. The high potency benzodiazepines alprazolam and triazolam and long-acting benzodiazepines are not recommended in the elderly due to increased adverse effects. Nonbenzodiazepines such as zaleplon and zolpidem and low doses of sedating antidepressants are sometimes used as alternatives to benzodiazepines.|$|E

40|$|At present, {{there are}} few {{alternatives}} to institutional care for our aging citizens, because nearly all efforts <b>to</b> help <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> have been directed toward the institutional setting. Supporting services for those older persons who could continue living at home are either inadequate or nonexistent in most communities. Because of these gaps in services, many older people are forced to seek institutional care, which proves to be damaging <b>to</b> <b>the</b> recipient and costly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> community. <b>The</b> <b>elderly</b> require {{a broad range of}} services which would permit them to continue living independently in the community with dignity and security...|$|R

25|$|From its {{earliest}} days, {{a hallmark of}} the organization's local efforts was service to the communities in which members reside.

25|$|International {{comparisons}} of healthcare {{have found that}} the United States spends more per-capita than other similarly developed nations but falls below similar countries in various health metrics, suggesting inefficiency and waste. In addition, the United States has significant underinsurance and significant impending unfunded liabilities from its aging demographic and its social insurance programs Medicare and Medicaid (Medicaid provides free long-term care <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> poor). The fiscal and human impact of these issues have motivated reform proposals.|$|E
