50|$|All modern roller {{coasters}} have up-stop wheels that hug {{the bottom of}} the rail. As their name implies, they prevent the train from coming up off the track. Side friction wheels hug the sides of the rail, either the outside or inside, depending on the track manufacturer. These wheels help the train stay {{in the center of the}} two rails to keep the train from derailing. The last wheel set are called <b>tractor</b> <b>wheels,</b> or running <b>wheels.</b> <b>Tractor</b> <b>wheels</b> have a simple but important purpose.

The purpose of using machinery in agriculture sector {{is to improve}} the productivity, increase performance, and easier for farmers to manage their crop in field planting. Agriculture tractor can be divided into 3 categories which are unequal four wheel drive or front-wheel assist and two wheel drive. Wheel slippage can be defined as a measurable quantity that indicates the relative effectiveness of the traction delivery system to the <b>tractor</b> <b>wheel.</b> The suitable operating load was an important factor to optimizing the tractor performance before operates in field planting. The measurement of <b>tractor</b> <b>wheel</b> slip was important for the farmer to know in order to prevent the excessive ballasting on the tractor depends on the soil condition in their field. The <b>tractor</b> <b>wheel</b> slip should be optimally run at 10 % to 15 % for two wheel drive (2 WD) tractors and 8 % to 12 % for four wheel drive (4 WD) or front wheel assist (FWA) equipped units. This study was carried out to measure the <b>tractor</b> <b>wheel</b> slippage for 2 WD and 4 WD in tilled soils surfaces. The location was carried out on tilled soil in UITM Jasin. The result shows that there was significant difference between tractor engine speeds for 2 WD but at the same times, it also shows there no significant difference at the certain engine speed on both 1000, 1500 rpm and 2000, 2500 rpm respectively. For 4 WD tractor, its shows that there are significant differences among various speed but still show significant difference at 2000 and 2500 rpm. Besides, the relationship was strongly positive and percentage of wheel slippage for 4 WD was most suitable to operate in tilled soil conditions at share farm UITM Jasin...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the modelling and simulation of welding process {{based on the}} finite element method (FEM) in order to predict the welding distortion of <b>tractor</b> <b>wheel</b> blades. Two FEM modellings are needed to obtain the welding distortion models, namely thermal and elasto-plastic. The effect of welding thermal is assumed as tendon force and {{to be used as}} input of the analysis of elasto-plastic modelling. Welding distortion simulation results were verified using the experimental data. The verification results have shown similar shape of the welding deformation between simulations and experimental. Also, deviation value of displacement distortion between simulation and experimental is small. Hence, the simulation of welding deformation modelling using thermal elasto-plastic FEM can be used to predict the welding distortion of <b>tractor</b> <b>wheel</b> blades. Based on simulation results, the shape of radial and axial displacement distortion due to welding the blade with serial sequence was larger than that of the shape distortion due to welding of the blade with a recommended sequence. After welding simulation of those of 16 <b>wheels</b> <b>tractor</b> blades, the predicted value of displacement distortion due to welding of the blade with serial sequence is equal to 3, 393 mm, which was larger than that of 1, 440 mm due to welding of the blade with recommended sequence...|$|R

40|$|Soil {{compaction}} causes {{deleterious effects}} on physical and mechanical proprieties of agricultural soils. In order {{to investigate the}} effect of soil moisture content and <b>tractor</b> <b>wheeling</b> intensity on traffic-induced soil compaction, this study was carried out on a field with clay loam soil. Soil dry bulk density and hydraulic conductivity as well as emergence percentage of corn seedlings and dry mass of the sampled mature plants were considered the dependent variables of the experiment. Independent variables consisted of soil moisture content with five levels (12, 15, 17, 19, and 21 %), traffic intensity with three levels (four, two, and zero passes of <b>tractor</b> <b>wheel</b> (<b>tractor</b> model: John Deere 3350) from the entire area of the plot), and soil sampling depth with three levels (0 - 10, 10 - 20, and 20 - 30 cm). According {{to the results of}} this study, gradual increase in soil water content generally resulted in an increase in soil bulk density; moreover, increasing the <b>tractor</b> <b>wheeling</b> intensity from 0 to 4 passes increased bulk density by 13 %. Furthermore, the driest soil water content had the highest and the wettest soil water content had the lowest emergence percentage of corn seedlings among the treatments; moreover, traffic intensity treatment inversely affected the emergence percentage of corn seedlings and the dry mass of mature plants. To sum up, these results indicate that, for improving water permeability and reducing dry bulk density of the examined clay loam soil, as well as better emergence of corn seedlings and ultimately increasing crop yield, it is recommended to avoid wheeling when soil moisture content is high, reduce the number of machinery wheel passes from the farm as low as possible, and restrict the wheel passes to fixed strips along the field, whenever possible...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{measurement}} was to verify the drawbar characteristics of chosen tractors with different undercarriages. The tractors were of the same engine power as well as type of gearbox (PowerShift – gears full shifted while loaded). We were dealing with the <b>wheeled</b> <b>tractor</b> John Deere 8320 and crawler tractor John Deere 8320 RT. The measurement was implemented in the land register of Vrbovec (Znojmo region) {{in an area where}} green peas were grown as the main product and winter wheat as the preceding crop. The measured and the counterproductive tractors were interconnected by the rope containing strain-gauge force sensors. The <b>wheeled</b> <b>tractor</b> was decelerated by the tractor crawler. The tractor crawler was decelerated by two <b>wheeled</b> <b>tractors.</b> The <b>wheeled</b> <b>tractor’s</b> stress-strain properties were also measured applying two pressure rating alternatives. Variant A presented inflation pressure of 160 kPa on the front axle and of 140 kPa on the rear axle. Variant B applied inflation pressure of 120 kPa on the front axle and of 100 kPa on the rear axle. Measured and calculated findings reveal that the tractor crawler achieved higher drawbar power and lower specific tractive consumption and traction slip than the <b>wheeled</b> <b>tractor</b> with both variants of inflation.

50|$|Aggregation is {{important}} in the subsoil, the layer below tillage. Such aggregates involve larger (2- to 6-inch) blocks of soil that are more angular and not as distinctive. These aggregates are less impacted by biological activity than the tillage layer. Subsurface aggregates are important for root growth deep into the profile. Deep roots allow greater access to moisture, which helps in drought periods. Subsoil aggregates can also be compacted, mainly by heavy equipment on wet soil.
