40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to propose}} a tax reform that would reduce income taxes and other {{indirect}} taxes {{while at the same}} time increasing inheritance and estate taxes. Such a reform is economically very efficient and would certainly equalize income distribution. Design/methodology/approach – A wide review of the death and inheritance taxes in the USA and Europe is presented. Findings – Government's revenue from inheritance and gifts is lower than 1 percent of GDP. This is due mainly to a combination of considerable <b>tax-free</b> <b>allowances</b> for the closest relatives and high thresholds where the top rates apply. No empirical examination of the effect of inheritance tax on economic growth or economic efficiency could be found. Practical implications – Because inheritance taxes are economically efficient, they improve the immoral unequal income distribution drastically. Therefore, it should be concluded that inheritance tax must be implemented. Originality/value – This paper discusses the various economic aspects of the proposed tax reform.

An increase was made in <b>tax-free</b> <b>allowances</b> for children, which enabled 1,000,000 families to claim an allowance for the second child, compared to 300,000 families previously. The Second Modification and Supplementation Law (1970) increased the allowance for the third child from DM 50 to DM 60, raised the income-limit for the second child allowance from DM 7,800 to DM 13,200; subsequently increased to DM 15,000 by the third modification law (December 1971), DM 16,800 by the fourth modification law (November 1973), and to DM 18,360 by the fifth modification law (December 1973). A flexible retirement age after 62 years was introduced (1972) for invalids and handicapped persons, and social assistance was extended to those who previously had to be helped by their relatives. From 1971, special subventions were provided to enable young farmers to quit farming “and facilitate their entry into the non-agricultural pension system by means of back payments.” ...|$|R

50|$|In the Philippines, {{there is}} one {{shopping}} mall called the Duty Free Philippines Fiestamall, which is located {{a few miles away}} from Ninoy Aquino Airport as opposed to being at the airport itself. It is the only shopping mall {{of its kind in the}} world. The goods that are sold in this mall are often imported products which come from around the world (mainly from United States, Asia and Australasia) and are not found in any other shopping malls in the country, aside from duty-free malls. Tourists, visitors and returning citizens of Philippines often pay a visit to this mall shortly after their arrival (since only arriving passengers and their companions are allowed access). In order to gain entry, a passport is needed to be presented and registered at the Customer Registration Counter at the entrance of the mall. The customer will then be issued a shopping card; these shopping cards must be presented to the cashier for validation of purchases. Arriving customers are given a certain <b>tax-free</b> <b>allowance</b> on purchases and anything in excess will be subject to local and national taxes. In the past, the mall used to only accept US dollars and Philippine peso but in recent years, it had begun accepting other currencies such as Japanese yen, Brunei dollar, Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Swiss franc, Saudi riyal, Bahraini dinar, and Thai baht. Currency exchange booths are also available inside the mall if a customer wishes to exchange currencies into Philippine pesos or US dollars. Credits cards can also be used for purchasing goods.In Australia, duty-free shops, once common, have all but disappeared since the introduction of GST in 2000. Retailer James Richardson operates several duty-free shops in major cities, but most duty-free shops are now located within international airports. Residents and tourists are allowed to purchase virtually any physical good within 60 days of departure, which needs to be taken on the outward flight, and claim the GST component back through the Tourist Refund Scheme when passing through customs. Consumers are now free to fully use their items prior to departure. This is in contrast prior to 2000, where all purchases had to be packed by the duty-free store in a sealed clear plastic bag, and could only be broken open by customs staff just prior to departure.|$|E

50|$|In 1975, a basic <b>tax-free</b> cash <b>allowance</b> {{starting}} at £665 {{for children under}} the age of ten provided a considerable amount of support for families living on low incomes, and its combination with direct taxation meant greater support to poor families than in any other country in the EEC. A two-parent family with four dependent children on 66% of average earnings gained an amount after tax and allowances equal to 49.4% of its income compared with 8.2% in the United Kingdom. Nevertheless, that same year, INSEE found that at any wage level disposable income per head was still much lower in large families than those with no or very few children, while the cost of bringing up a family weighed particularly heavily on households headed by a low-paid worker. According to one estimate from the early Seventies, using 1500 francs net per month for those in full-time employment 44% of women and 24.5% of men were low paid. The percentage of workers who were low paid was particularly high in personal services such as hairdressing (74%), hotel and catering (60%) and textiles (51%).|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between high {{social security contributions}} and the local labour market performance has been and still is intensively discussed in the political arena. Various reform concepts suggested by members of politics and associations are going around. Some measures to restrict the increase in social security contributions have been implemented over the past years. To evaluate the different reform approaches, the causal {{relationship between}} social security contributions and employment is of significant importance. The question at the crux of this issue is what effects a change/reduction in the social security contribution rates has on firstly, labour supply and demand alone, and then, when taking into consideration circular-flow effects, on the employment level in {{the economy as a}} whole. The analyses of supply and demand show that by reducing social security contributions ceteris paribus additional manpower can be motivated to take up employment, and that companies would be prepared to hire additional workers. This is also true at macroeconomic level. Without counter-financing, the circular-flow model predicts a permanent increase in labour demand, and thus in employment, by 150, 000 to 160, 000 people {{in the case of a}} linear reduction in social security contributions by one percentage point. Considerably lower or even slightly negative employment effects result from counter-financing with direct or indirect taxes or a combination thereof. If the reduction in social security contributions is carried out in an asymmetrical way, for example by means of a <b>tax-free</b> <b>allowance,</b> this results in considerably higher labour market effects than with a linear reduction with an identical volume of financial relief. In order to really be able to realise the additional employment opportunities of low-skilled and low-wage workers provided by an asymmetrical reduction in social security contributions, it would also be important when developing supporting wage policies, for tax increases which also affect low-income groups not to result in a disproportionately large increase in the lower wage groups. This concluding finding shows again the importance of a close co-operation between fiscal policy and collective bargaining policy.

Dies w nach Berechnung des DIW Berlin Familien mit Kindern durchschnittlich um rund 700 Euro pro Jahr entlasten. Die Entlastung steigt mit dem Einkommen. Im untersten Zehntel (Dezil) der Einkommensverteilung betr 4 gt die durchschnittliche Entlastung der Familien knapp 300 Euro pro Jahr, w 4 hrend sie im obersten Zehntel rund 840 Euro ausmacht.

Im Zusammenhang mit der Familienbesteuerung wird h 4 ufig das franz 6 sische Familiensplitting als Vorbild genannt. In dieser Studie werden der deutsche Familienleistungsausgleich sowie der Reformvorschlag der Union als Varianten eines Familienrealsplittings in Art und Wirkung mit dem tariflichen Familiensplitting in Frankreich verglichen. Es zeigt sich, dass schon das bestehende deutsche Modell in weiten Teilen gro ist als das franz 6 sische. Die finanziellen Vorteile f deutsche Familien w sich bei Umsetzung der Unionspl 4 ne vergr 6. Generell haben alle Splittingmodelle den gravierenden Nachteil, dass sie dem familienpolitischen Ziel der Vereinbarkeit von Beruf und Familie entgegenwirken. Angesichts der hohen fiskalischen Kosten des Unionsvorschlags sollte deswegen in Erw 4 gung gezogen werden, die Mittel eher in Ma zu investieren, die einen solchen Zielkonflikt nicht aufweisen, wie zum Beispiel den Ausbau qualitativ hochwertiger Kinderbetreuung. As part {{of their}} {{election}} manifesto, under the heading 'family income splitting', the German Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union of Bavaria (CDU/CSU) has proposed increasing child benefits by 35 euros per month and raising the <b>tax-free</b> <b>allowance</b> for dependent children to {{the same level as}} the basic personal tax exemption for adults. According to calculations by DIW Berlin, if this proposal were to be implemented, families with children would be around 700 euros a year better off, on average. The higher the family's income, the more tax relief they would receive. Families in the lowest income decile only stand to gain an average of just under 300 euros per year, while those in the upper decile will be approximately 840 euros per year better off. Consequently, tax relief for low-income families is below average and yet, the total cost of the reform is more than seven billion euros per annum. In the context of family taxation, the French family income splitting system is frequently cited as a model. The present study outlines the German family allowance system and also the reform proposed by the CDU/CSU as examples of 'real' family income splitting (Familienrealsplitting) and compares them, in terms of their structure and impact, with the French system of 'notional' family income splitting (tarifliches Familiensplitting). The analysis reveals that the current German model is already, to a great extent, more generous than the French one. Should they be implemented, the CDU/CSU plans would further increase the financial benefits already provided to German families under the current system. However, it is generally the case that all income splitting models have the serious disadvantage of undermining the important family policy goal of enabling a reconciliation of work and family life. Given the high fiscal costs of the CDU/CSU proposal, serious consideration should be given to investing the additional funds in other family policy measures that do not present conflicts of interest, such as expanding high-quality child care options, for example...|$|E
