25|$|Assaliaq (assaliq; lit. «fried thing»; also, pancake; other fried food; fry bread) {{is fresh}} fried fish. All {{parts of the}} fish except the {{entrails}} are used to prepare this dish, although often the heads are removed as well. The fish is filleted, dipped in seasoned flour, or just seasoned with salt, and fried in oil. If households enjoy picking and sucking backbones or only a few fish are available, the backbone will be fried along with the filleted pieces. Heads are sometimes fried for the same reasons. Boiled rice is the favorite side dish with <b>this</b> <b>meal.</b> Middle aged and younger people enjoy <b>this</b> <b>meal</b> for the flavor. The verb assali- (to fry; to make pancakes or griddlecakes) is derived from Russian жа́рить (zhárit’) ‘to roast, fry, broil, grill’.|$|E

25|$|According to Scala's Original Beef and Sausage Company (formed in 1925), <b>this</b> <b>meal</b> was {{originally}} introduced at weddings and banquets where the meat was sliced thinly {{so there would}} be enough to feed all the guests. It rapidly grew in popularity and eventually became one of Chicago's most famous ethnic foods: the original Italian beef sandwich.|$|E
25|$|In {{the story}} of Abraham hosting the three visitors, Abraham offers cakes, a well {{prepared}} young calf, curds, and milk. <b>This</b> <b>meal</b> has similar elements to an earlier meal described in {{the story of}} Sinuhe, an Egyptian nobleman who lived for a time in Canaan around 1900 BCE, at which bread, wine, cooked meat, roast fowl, and dairy products were served.|$|E
25|$|The {{bones in}} the stomach region had not been etched by the stomach acid, {{indicating}} <b>this</b> <b>meal</b> {{was less than a}} day old. It is possible that the stomach exit was too narrow to let these remains pass and that the acid was used to extract calcium from the bones, a much-needed nutrient for a young growing animal. The subsequent digestive tract with most extant vertebrates is incapable of further digesting bones. Afterwards the remains would then have been regurgitated. However, the presence of vertebrae in the intestines suggests that the exit was wide and that non-avian theropods in this respect were more like present Lepidosauromorpha than extant Archosauria who regurgitate. This is also confirmed by a high bone content in the coprolites of large theropods. Fish contains much calcium and {{it is possible that the}} hatchling instinctively sought it out; alternatively, it could have been preferentially fed fish by its parents. The presence of skin in the faeces was to be expected as this is not easily digested.|$|E

500|$|On {{the evening}} before his execution, Parsons watched The Mummy and was visited in his death watch cell by his brother and his cousin. They shared his last meal of Burger King hamburgers, French fries, milkshakes, root beer, and {{chocolate}} chip ice cream. Parsons' attorney said he believed his client chose <b>this</b> <b>meal</b> because the Burger King slogan [...] "Have it your way" [...] was a reflection of him taking control of his life. After playing a game of Uno, he asked for the score of the 1999 American League Championship Series game. Parsons was permitted to call his mother Marie Gordon Rivera in Florida and his sister.|$|E
500|$|The daily rituals in most temples {{included}} two sequences of offering rites: one {{to clean and}} dress the god for the day, and one to present it with a meal. The exact order of events in these rituals is uncertain and may have varied somewhat each time they were performed.In addition, the two sequences probably overlapped with each other. At sunrise, the officiating priest entered the sanctuary, carrying a candle to light the room. He opened {{the doors of the}} shrine and prostrated himself before the god's image, reciting hymns in its praise. He removed the god from the shrine, clothed it (replacing the clothes of the previous day), and anointed it with oil and paint. At some point the priest presented the god's meal, including a variety of meats, fruits, vegetables, and bread. The god was believed to consume only the spiritual essence of <b>this</b> <b>meal.</b> This belief allowed the food to be distributed to others, an act that the Egyptians called the [...] "reversion of offerings". The food passed first to the other statues throughout the temple, then to local funerary chapels for the sustenance of the dead, and finally to the priests who ate it. Temple artwork often shows the king presenting an image of the goddess Maat to the temple deity, an act that represented the purpose of all other offerings.|$|E
500|$|The song {{opens with}} the singer using sexually {{explicit}} language to describe an evening {{at her home}} where she is cooking a meal for her love interest while being naked and alone, [...] "I'm in my penthouse half-naked / I cook <b>this</b> <b>meal</b> for you naked". Idolator's Mike Wass interpreted these lines as showing the singer [...] "emotional shortcomings". The Atlantic editor Nolan Feeney felt that these lines showcased many of the singer's recurring themes present on her other albums — [...] "the empowerment that comes with being a strong, independent woman, and the fulfillment that comes with love and marriage". Finney wrote that during {{the beginning of the}} song, Beyoncé seemed excited about her role as a wife in the kitchen, but afterwards as the events go wrong and she is left alone, the same role feels oppressive.The singer continues singing lines about jealousy and realizes her partner will not come: [...] "I wish you were me/ So you could feel this feeling/ I never broke one promise, and I know when you're not honest." [...] After the chorus, Beyoncé sings the lines [...] "Sometimes I want to walk in your shoes, do the type of things I never ever do. I take one look in the mirror, and I say to myself, 'Baby girl, you can't survive like this.'" [...] The protagonist can not tolerate the fact she has been underappreciated and goes on to put on a [...] "freakum dress out my closet" [...] (a reference to her own song [...] "Freakum Dress" [...] (2006)) and stay the night outside further singing about her own attractiveness. As she continues to describe her love–hate relationship detailing her emotions, Beyoncé sings the song's bridge: ...|$|E

5000|$|Later rabbinic sources list great spiritual {{rewards for}} eating <b>this</b> third <b>meal</b> and state {{that it is}} {{equivalent}} to all the meals combined. Indeed, while sometimes called seudah shlishit, or [...] "third meal," [...] it is often called shalosh seudos, [...] "three meals" [...] for its significance.|$|R
2500|$|Rabbi Yaakov Emden {{writes that}} <b>this</b> <b>meal</b> {{is called a}} Seudat Zachar (Meal of Remembrance), and is held {{specifically}} on Shabbat because that day is also connected with remembrance, as the Torah states, [...] "Remember the Shabbat day to sanctify it" [...] (Exodus 20:8).|$|E
2500|$|Reciting kiddush {{before the}} meal {{on the eve}} of Shabbat and Jewish {{holidays}} is thus [...] a commandment from the Torah (as it is explained by the Oral Torah). Reciting kiddush before the morning meal on Shabbat and holidays is a requirement of rabbinic origin. Kiddush is not usually recited at the third meal on Shabbat, although Maimonides was of the opinion that wine should be drunk at <b>this</b> <b>meal</b> as well.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Rema it is {{customary}} {{to sit on}} low stools or on the floor, as is {{done during}} shiva, from the meal immediately before the fast, the seudah hamafseket, until midday (chatztot hayom).

2500|$|Along {{with the}} {{avoidance}} of chametz, the principal ritual unique to this holiday is the seder. The seder, meaning [...] "order", is an ordered ritual meal eaten {{on the first night}} of Passover, and outside Israel also on the second night. <b>This</b> <b>meal</b> is known for its distinctive ritual foods—matzo (unleavened bread), maror (bitter herbs), and four cups of wine—as well as its prayer text/handbook/study guide, the Haggadah.

2500|$|In the Southern United States, eating {{black-eyed peas}} or Hoppin' John (a {{traditional}} soul food) on New Year's Day {{is thought to}} bring prosperity in the new year. The peas are typically cooked with a pork product for flavoring (such as bacon, fatback, ham bones, or hog jowls) and diced onion, and served with a hot chili sauce or a pepper-flavored vinegar. The traditional meal also includes collard, turnip, or mustard greens, and ham. The peas, since they swell when cooked, symbolize prosperity; the greens symbolize money; the pork, because pigs root forward when foraging, represents positive motion. Cornbread, which represents gold, also often accompanies <b>this</b> <b>meal.</b>|$|E
