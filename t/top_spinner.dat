25|$|Benaud {{was not a}} large spinner of the ball, but he {{was known}} for his ability to extract {{substantial}} bounce from the surface. In addition to his accurate probing consistency, he possessed a well-disguised googly and topspinner which tricked many batsmen and yielded him many wickets. In his later career, he added the flipper, a combination of the googly and <b>top</b> <b>spinner</b> which was passed to him by Bruce Dooland. Coupled with his subtle variations in flight and angle of the delivery, he kept the batsman under constant pressure. Benaud had the tendency to bowl around the wicket {{at a time when he}} was one of the first players to do so; it had an influence on spin bowlers like Shane Warne and Ashley Giles. Benaud was regarded as one of the finest close-fielders of his era, either at gully or in a silly position. As a batsman, he was tall and lithe, known for his hitting power, in particular his lofted driving ability from the front foot.|$|E

He possessed strong wrists and fingers, {{developed}} by squeezing a squash ball, which {{enabled him to}} spin the ball hardteammates and opponents spoke of the [...] "buzzing" [...] or [...] "fizzing" [...] noise that the ball made on its way toward the batsman after leaving his hand. Fleetwood-Smith's approach to bowling was uncomplicated. Following a very brief five-pace run up to the wicket, he brought his arm over quickly to deliver at a pace considered fast for a spin bowler. His three variations were the off-break (spinning into the right-hand batsman), the wrong 'un (spinning away) and the <b>top</b> <b>spinner,</b> which Hammond believed to be his best ball. He did not bother with varying his pace or flight: the only concession he made to tactical considerations was {{a signal to the}} wicket-keeper, to let him know which of the three variations he was about to deliver. Therefore, he rarely engaged in an extended strategic battle with a batsman in the manner of Grimmett or O'Reilly. The danger to the batsman lay in his unpredictability; he bowled all of his variations with no discernible change to his bowling action and needed no help from the pitch to extract turn.

5000|$|He played District Cricket for the Melbourne Cricket Club {{from the}} {{beginning}} of the 1941/1942 season. In his first match for Melbourne, playing against the Essendon Cricket Club, he put on an exceptional performance after the break for tea: …Splendid bowling by Hill, formerly of St. Patrick's College, Ballarat, was a striking feature of Melbourne's display against Essendon (167). Up till tea time he had 0/24, but he finished with 6/36 off 15.1 overs. Bowling leg breaks slightly faster than usual, he showed good control in his first senior match.…At Essendon Hill, a new M.C.C. bowler form Mordialloc took 6/36. He kept a good length and got wickets with <b>top</b> <b>spinners</b> that made pace from the pitch.|$|R

50|$|Tactically, a bowler will bowl topspinners {{to draw a}} batsman forward {{before using}} the dip and extra bounce to deceive them. In particular, batsmen looking to sweep or drive are {{vulnerable}} as the bounce can defeat them.In modern-day cricket Anil Kumble is considered the foremost leg spin exponent of the <b>top</b> <b>spinner.</b> Muttiah Muralitharan {{is an example of}} an offspinner who frequently uses this delivery.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the time}} of his 1953 Test selection, a {{newspaper}} described his action as follows: …Jack Hill, the [...] "slightly different" [...] bowler… grips the ball as though he will bowl a leg break, but, although he can bowl leg breaks, he is really a <b>top</b> <b>spinner,</b> making great pace off the wicket. He has surprised and bowled many good batsmen because the ball nips off the wicket much faster than expected.|$|E

500|$|O'Reilly {{was one of}} {{the best}} spin bowlers ever to play cricket. He {{delivered}} the ball from a two-fingered grip at close to medium pace with great accuracy, and could produce leg breaks, googlies, and <b>top</b> <b>spinners,</b> with no discernible change in his action. A tall man for a spinner (around 188cm, 6ft 2in), he whirled his arms to an unusual extent and had a low point of delivery that meant it was very difficult for the batsman to read the flight of the ball out of his hand. When O'Reilly died, Sir Donald Bradman said that he was the greatest bowler he had ever faced or watched. In 1935, Wisden wrote of him: [...] "O'Reilly {{was one of the}} best examples in modern cricket of what could be described as a 'hostile' bowler." [...] In 1939, Wisden reflected on Bill O'Reilly's successful 1938 Ashes tour of England: [...] "He is emphatically one of the greatest bowlers of all time." ...|$|R

50|$|Submission was a Chance Rides Double Swinging Inverter {{located in}} the X-Sector area and was built in 2001. From 2005, the ride only {{operated}} one of its arms to save electricity and the ride's cycles were shortened. The slogan used in advertisement was 'Hang in there'. Following the area's theme, the ride was painted blue and was covered in a shiny metal, most likely steel. Each of its two arms had a counterweight {{in the shape of}} two metal spikes, which would sweep near to the ground like a scythe. The sequence was always the same, different to some other weight based rides that have numerous sequences, this was also probably to be more energy efficient. The Ride type itself is a rare flat-ride and not seen at a lot of themeparks, Submission did not have the best of reviews at Alton Towers mainly due to it having the same sequence (unlike others such as Ripsaw), the restraints were very similar to those on a Huss <b>Top</b> <b>Spinner</b> making it fairly uncomfortable to ride when inverted, breakdowns occasionally happened and as a result, queues were very short. In 2013 it was later revealed that Submission would be closed {{after the end of the}} 2013 season by which there is a vacant grass area where it once stood next to the break-block section on Oblivion. The grass area is often referred to as the 'Submission memorial ground' by thrill-seekers which has become a popular sitting area in the park section.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two primary}} worlds within {{the story of}} Nanatsuiro Drops: the human world called Retroscena, and a magical world called Figurare from which the Stellar Spinners originate. There are {{currently}} two schools that teach magic within Figurare: Pramu Clovis and Sentou Asparas. According to Natsume, each year the two schools pick their <b>top</b> Stellar <b>Spinners</b> (the one from Pramu Clovis is called Prima Pramu, and from Sentou Asparas is called Prima Asparas) to send to the human world to capture seven stardrops in a goodwill competition to improve relations.|$|R
5000|$|Another Stellar Spinner, but {{one from}} Figurare. Presumably {{this is her}} {{first time in the}} human world, hence her {{confusion}} with certain simple tasks such as washing rice (which she confuses for [...] "sharpening" [...] it due to both words using the same kanji). She is an expert spell-caster and quite proficient at capturing stardrops. Her power level in the beginning far exceeds Sumomo's, as evidenced by her telling Sumomo to try to touch her [...] "recipe" [...] (her spellbook). Sumomo is shocked by it and unable to grasp it. They later develop a friendly rivalry, as well as shared feelings for Masaharu. Nona is the <b>top</b> Stellar <b>Spinner</b> from the Prima Asparas school. Later, she joins Masaharu and Sumomo's school to study the human world; we discover that she altered her appearance so she can attempt to blend in that's why her human appearance is different than her stellar form.|$|R

5000|$|Roller Electrospinning {{system a}} method for {{producing}} nanofibres was developed by Jirsak et al.. This method is known under the name Nanospider from Elmarco Company in Liberec. Roller electrospinning is the unique method which {{has been used in}} industry to produce nanofibers continuously.Nanospider consists of rotating roller to spin fibers directly from the polymer solution. This roller spinning electrode partially immersed in the tank with the polymer solution. A grounded collector electrode is placed at the <b>top</b> of the <b>spinner</b> [...] A nonwoven backing material moves along the collector electrode which makes the production of the nanofibre layer a continuous process. Many Taylor cones are simultaneously formed {{on the surface of the}} rotating spinning electrode, which makes the technology highly productive.|$|R
25|$|In {{selecting}} {{their team}} for Australia the MCC selectors (Sir Pelham Warner, Harry Altham, Gubby Allen, Les Ames, William Findlay, Tom Pearce, Walter Robins, Brian Sellers and Bob Wyatt) {{made the mistake}} on relying on experience {{on one hand and}} youth on the other, but with little between. In this they were not helped by the hole left in English cricket by the Second World War, but only three players (Godfrey Evans, Trevor Bailey and Reg Simpson) were aged between 26 and 31 and could be said to be at their prime; nine of the players were 32 or more and six 26 or less. The captain Freddie Brown had last toured Australia in 1932-33 with Douglas Jardine and Len Hutton, Cyril Washbrook, Denis Compton, Doug Wright, Alec Bedser and Godfrey Evans in 1946-47 under Wally Hammond; {{the rest of the team}} had never travelled down under. Bill Edrich who had made a gutsy 462 runs (46.20) in 1946-47 and would tour Australia again in 1954-55, but was out of favour at Lord's (he was being divorced, and such things counted in the 1950s) and had had an injury-struck season. The two biggest wicket-takers of 1950 were the <b>top</b> <b>spinners</b> Jim Laker and Johnny Wardle. Laker had taken an astounding 8/2 in the 1950 Bradford Test Trial, but his brand of off-spin was deemed too slow for the hard Australian pitches and he was not chosen for the 1954-55 tour either. In the 1956 Ashes series he took 46 wickets (9.60) including 19/90 at Old Trafford and when he finally toured Australia in 1958-59 he took 15 wickets (21.20). The Yorkshireman Johnny Wardle was also left behind, but would finish with 102 Test wickets (20.39) with his combination of Slow Left Arm bowling and Chinamen. To be fair to the selectors Laker had only taken 32 Test wickets (37.34) at the time and Wardle just 2 (56.50). The MCC were committed to a youth policy that consistently failed them. In 1950 they relied overly on young undergraduates from Cambridge University and had lost 3-1 to the West Indies as a result. A continuation of this policy was unlikely to succeed in Australia, but John Dewes, David Sheppard and John Warr were chosen for the tour along with the young professionals Brian Close, Gilbert Parkhouse and Bob Berry. They all failed when faced with real class and only served to increase the burden on the senior players. Remembering his torrid time in 1946-47 Cyril Washbrook declined to tour when selected, but was later flown out with Roy Tattersall and Brian Statham. Washbrook's fears were full realised, Tattersall failed and Statham would not make his Test debut until the party reached New Zealand. Freddie Brown was the selector's third choice to lead the tour, after Norman Yardley of Yorkshire and George Mann of Middlesex both declined the job and he was only chosen as Lord's was determined to have an amateur captain. It was a thankless job as even with the retirement of the great Don Bradman it was clear that Australia were the stronger team and would be hard to beat on their own ground. They had defeated Wally Hammond 3-0 in 1946-47 and Yardley 4-0 in 1948 and England had not won a Test against them in twelve years.|$|R
