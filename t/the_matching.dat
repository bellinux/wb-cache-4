5|$|The {{earliest}} French, German, and Dutch pressings of {{the album}} contain a hidden track on HIStory Begins, which is a 20-second message from Michael to his fans in <b>the</b> <b>matching</b> countries.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} well received, with reviews {{generally}} praising the deep combat system and <b>the</b> <b>matching</b> up of fighters from different SNK franchises, though {{the inability to}} choose team lineups in Team Battle Mode was a near-universal complaint among critics.|$|E
50|$|The {{other main}} {{highlight}} of the season was <b>the</b> <b>match</b> at <b>The</b> Valley on 21 December 1957. <b>The</b> <b>match</b> against Charlton Athletic. <b>The</b> <b>match</b> finished 7-6 to Charlton, this after Charlton had only ten men {{for the majority of}} <b>the</b> <b>match</b> and <b>the</b> fact that with 27 minutes remaining, Town were leading 5-1 before losing <b>the</b> <b>match.</b> This remains <b>the</b> only <b>match</b> in professional football, where a team has scored 6 goals and lost <b>the</b> <b>match.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> fifth <b>match</b> pitted Jeff Hardy {{defending}} the WWF Light Heavyweight Championship against X-Pac. Hardy dominated earlier part of <b>the</b> <b>match</b> until X-Pac got control of <b>the</b> <b>match.</b> Throughout <b>the</b> <b>match,</b> Hardy and X-Pac did cruiserweight action. In the closing moments of <b>the</b> <b>match,</b> X-Pac hit Hardy with an X-Factor and pinned him. However, as <b>the</b> <b>match</b> ended, <b>the</b> referee realized that Hardy's foot {{was on the}} rope and <b>the</b> <b>match</b> continued. Hardy executed a Swanton Bomb and got the pinfall to retain the Light Heavyweight Championship.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>match</b> {{finished}} 2-2 after 90 minutes, and was {{marred by}} a pitch invasion during <b>the</b> <b>match</b> half-time, with considerable amount of fans staying around the pitch during the second half, occasionally disrupting <b>the</b> <b>match.</b> In <b>the</b> <b>match</b> itself, Maccabi took the a 2-0 by the 48th minute and Hakoah equalized by scoring twice within the last 15 minutes of <b>the</b> <b>match.</b>|$|R
5|$|These {{coverings}} {{have been}} considered as a realistic model {{for the growth of}} quasicrystals: the overlapping decagons are 'quasi-unit cells' analogous to the unit cells from which crystals are constructed, and <b>the</b> <b>matching</b> rules maximize the density of certain atomic clusters.|$|E
5|$|Given that <b>the</b> <b>matching</b> {{vocabulary}} and astronomical content {{is drawn from}} throughout Polynesia, far afield from Easter Island, this supports the argument that rongorongo was not a recent, localized development; rather it {{was a product of}} thriving Polynesian trade and cultural interaction throughout the Pacific. There is additional evidence in favor of this theory, such as the identification of Polaris among the glyphs, which is only visible from the northern hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to using a turntable, players {{have the option}} to sing or rap to the mixes' lyrics, similar to vocal parts in current Guitar Hero or Rock Band games using a compatible microphone controller from most previous rhythm games. The game will score vocals based on <b>the</b> <b>matching</b> of pitch, beat and rhythm.|$|E
25|$|If an umpire or match {{official}} deems that a bowler is contravening law 24.3, he details this in <b>the</b> <b>match</b> report {{which is}} passed on <b>the</b> <b>match</b> referee. Within 24 {{hours of the}} conclusion of <b>the</b> <b>match,</b> <b>the</b> <b>match</b> referee provides <b>the</b> team manager and the ICC {{with a copy of}} <b>the</b> <b>match</b> report. A media statement is also issued that the player has been reported.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>match</b> {{was played}} under dry conditions. Rain was {{forecast}} {{towards the end}} of <b>the</b> <b>match,</b> but did not arrive until after <b>the</b> <b>match</b> had finished.|$|R
50|$|On 19 November, <b>the</b> <b>match</b> against Mainz 05 was {{canceled}} after the referee for <b>the</b> <b>match,</b> Babak Rafati, attempted suicide. <b>The</b> <b>match</b> was eventually rescheduled for 13 December.|$|R
5|$|The {{congregation}} raised $40,000 in 2000 {{for emergency}} repairs, and {{was awarded a}} $230,000 grant by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation for restoration work, including roof repair, but {{had not been able}} to raise <b>the</b> <b>matching</b> funds required to receive the grant. On December 6, 2001, a fire and subsequent fire-fighting efforts severely damaged the roof, ceiling, mural paintings and decorative plasterwork.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>matching</b> rules can be {{described}} in several ways. One approach is to color the vertices (with two colors, e.g., black and white) and require that adjacent tiles have matching vertices. Another is to use a pattern of circular arcs (as shown above left in green and red) to constrain the placement of tiles: when two tiles share an edge in a tiling, the patterns must match at these edges.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>matching</b> rules {{distinguish}} {{sides of}} the tiles, and entail that tiles may be juxtaposed in certain particular ways but not in others. Two ways to describe these matching rules are shown in {{the image on the}} right. In one form, tiles must be assembled such that the curves on the faces match in color and position across an edge. In the other, tiles must be assembled such that the bumps on their edges fit together.|$|E
25|$|Law 16: The result. The side which scores {{the most}} runs wins <b>the</b> <b>match.</b> If both sides score {{the same number}} of runs, <b>the</b> <b>match</b> is tied. However, <b>the</b> <b>match</b> may run out of time before the innings have all been completed. In this case, <b>the</b> <b>match</b> is drawn.|$|R
50|$|However, after <b>the</b> <b>match</b> with Xie Jun {{had already}} been {{scheduled}}, Galliamova objected because <b>the</b> entire <b>match</b> {{was scheduled to be}} played in China, the home of her rival. The reason for this was because only China had bid for <b>the</b> <b>match.</b> Galliamova wanted half of <b>the</b> <b>match</b> to be played in Kazan, Russia. However, the Russians did not have the money required. Finally, when Galliamova failed to show up to play <b>the</b> <b>match,</b> <b>the</b> <b>match</b> was declared forfeited to Xie Jun.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> next <b>match</b> was a {{standard}} wrestling match between Bam Bam Bigelow and Goldust. Goldust controlled most of <b>the</b> <b>match</b> against Bigelow while Bigelow performed poorly throughout <b>the</b> <b>match</b> {{and did not}} perform any high-impact moves that jeopardized his character during <b>the</b> <b>match.</b> Goldust eventually avoided a Corner Clothesline by Bigelow and performed a Running Bulldog to win <b>the</b> <b>match.</b>|$|R
5|$|There {{are also}} other related unequivalent tilings, {{such as the}} hexagon-boat-star and MikullaRoth tilings. For instance, if <b>the</b> <b>matching</b> rules for the rhombus tiling are reduced to a {{specific}} restriction on the angles permitted at each vertex, a binary tiling is obtained. Its underlying symmetry is also fivefold {{but it is not}} a quasicrystal. It can be obtained either by decorating the rhombs of the original tiling with smaller ones, or by applying substitution rules, but not by de Bruijn's cut-and-project method.|$|E
5|$|Unfamiliar with Miami culture, Aki Narula {{spent time}} there before filming began {{to learn how}} Miamians dressed and gave Bachachan long cargo shorts and cotton shirts in bright colours. According to the designer, the most {{interesting}} parts of his styling were <b>the</b> <b>matching</b> scarves, which resembled extended shirt collars. Narula gave Bachachan cargo and embroidered pants and sunglasses. The embroidery, primarily dragons and palm trees, conveyed a tropical summer look.|$|E
5|$|Despite the World War I, {{significant}} {{extensions of}} rail lines were carried out, {{particularly in the}} wheat growing areas in the north west and west. The new lengthy parallel lines {{were considered to be}} cheaper to operate than the numerous short spurs such as those in the Goulburn Valley. By 1930 the railway map of Victoria was largely complete, with the best land settled and the remaining land marginal for agriculture, with a number of lines built across the state border into the Riverina of NSW. On November 1937 the first run of the Spirit of Progress was made, a streamlined all air conditioned train run between Melbourne and Albury, led by <b>the</b> <b>matching</b> S class steam locomotives.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> sixth <b>match</b> {{was between}} Batista and Mr. Kennedy. During <b>the</b> <b>match,</b> Batista slammed Kennedy's {{head into the}} steel steps, which cut Kennedy and exposed his cranium. Kennedy won <b>the</b> <b>match</b> after Batista was disqualified for failing to release a choke he had applied on Kennedy. After <b>the</b> <b>match,</b> Kennedy {{received}} twenty stitches to close the cuts he received during <b>the</b> <b>match.</b>|$|R
5|$|Next was a {{match between}} Shelton Benjamin and Christian for the WWE Intercontinental Championship. During <b>the</b> <b>match,</b> Benjamin {{attempted}} to attack Tyson Tomko, who accompanied Christian to <b>the</b> <b>match,</b> but Christian stopped Benjamin. Each man gained control throughout <b>the</b> <b>match.</b> <b>The</b> <b>match</b> ended when Benjamin pinned Christian after a T-Bone Suplex.|$|R
50|$|In <b>the</b> sixth <b>match,</b> Brock Lesnar faced Big Show. During <b>the</b> <b>match,</b> Big Show {{executed}} three Chokeslams on Lesnar for a near-fall. <b>The</b> <b>match</b> {{ended when}} Lesnar executed four German Suplexes and an F5 on Big Show to win <b>the</b> <b>match.</b>|$|R
5|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>matching</b> {{mitochondrial}} DNA, geneticist Turi King {{continued to}} pursue {{a link between the}} paternally-inherited Y-DNA and that of descendants of John of Gaunt. Four living male-line descendants of Gaunt have been located, and their results are a match to each other. The Y-DNA from the skeleton is somewhat degraded, but proved not to match any of the living male-line relatives, showing that a false-paternity event had happened somewhere in the 19 generations between Richard III and Henry Somerset, 5th Duke of Beaufort; work by Turi King and others has shown that historical rates of false paternity are around 1–2% per generation.|$|E
5|$|During this period, WIN {{expanded}} to include new stations in Victoria, Queensland, and New South Wales. In 1984, WIN became the first regional television station to transmit in stereophonic sound. Close links between WIN Television and the Nine Network, ensured it the Nine Network affiliation for southern New South Wales when aggregation took place in 1989 thus the logo of the station changed to that of its partner network with <b>the</b> <b>matching</b> nine dots and similar ident packages. The changes meant that WIN expanded {{into the rest of}} southern New South Wales, launching new stations in Canberra, Orange, Bathurst, Dubbo and Wagga Wagga, amongst others in 1989, {{and at the same time}} acquiring new facilities in Orange, Wagga and Canberra. It also provided the network with two additional competitors, The Prime Network and Capital Television.|$|E
5|$|There was {{a slight}} delay in {{the start of the}} game as some of the glass needed to be fixed. Once the game was under way it took just 1:50 before the Crunch's Jon Mirasty and the Senators' Jeremy Yablonski engaged in the first fight in Outdoor Classic history. Mirasty had {{previously}} stated {{that he was going to}} be involved in the first outdoor fight. The physical play continued and minutes later at the 3:29 mark Paul Baier and Mike Radja were given matching roughing minor penalties. Not long after <b>the</b> <b>matching</b> minors Mike Blunden made a pass to Alexandre Picard to send him on a breakaway. Picard became the first player to score in an Outdoor Classic when he beat Senators' goaltender Mike Brodeur putting the Crunch up 1–0. The score remained the same at the end of a penalty-filled first period. Eight total penalties were called on the two clubs through the first 20 minutes of the game.|$|E
5000|$|In <b>the</b> fourth <b>match,</b> Bray Wyatt faced Chris Jericho. During <b>the</b> <b>match,</b> Luke Harper and Erick Rowan were {{ejected from}} ringside after {{attempting}} to attack Jericho. <b>The</b> <b>match</b> ended when Jericho performed a Codebreaker on Wyatt to win <b>the</b> <b>match.</b>|$|R
50|$|On November 23, 1941, Flamengo and Fluminense {{disputed the}} Campeonato Carioca final, at Gávea Stadium. As the stadium {{is located in}} Lagoa neighborhood, <b>the</b> <b>match</b> was nicknamed Lagoa's Fla-Flu. The first half of <b>the</b> <b>match</b> ended 2-1 to Fluminense. Flamengo's Pirillo scored a goal in the 39th minute {{of the second half}} of <b>the</b> <b>match,</b> but Fluminense only needed a draw in <b>the</b> <b>match,</b> and won <b>the</b> competition. 15,312 people watched <b>the</b> <b>match.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> fourth <b>match</b> was a tag team match fought under Super Libre, or [...] "no disqualification" [...] rules. As {{a result}} of {{everything}} being legal, <b>the</b> <b>match</b> included <b>the</b> user of steel folding chairs and other weapons, resulting in all four wrestlers bleeding during <b>the</b> <b>match.</b> <b>The</b> end came when Oficial 911 turned on his partner Danny Casas after Casas had accidentally hit 911 earlier in <b>the</b> <b>match.</b> <b>The</b> turn allowed Eterno and Canis Lupus to win <b>the</b> <b>match.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>matching</b> {{complex of}} a graph {{consists}} of the sets of edges no two of which share an endpoint; again, this family of sets satisfies the no-Δ condition. It {{may be viewed as}} the clique complex of the complement graph of the line graph of the given graph. When <b>the</b> <b>matching</b> complex is referred to without any particular graph as context, it means <b>the</b> <b>matching</b> complex of a complete graph. <b>The</b> <b>matching</b> complex of a complete bipartite graph K'm,n is known as a chessboard complex. It is the clique graph of the complement graph of a rook's graph, and each of its simplices represents a placement of rooks on an m'n chess board such that no two of the rooks attack each other. When m=n±1, the chessboard complex forms a pseudo-manifold.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>matching</b> {{process itself}} {{has also been}} {{scrutinized}} as limiting the employment rights of medical residents, namely where upon acceptance of a match, medical residents pursuant to <b>the</b> <b>matching</b> rules and regulations, are required to accept any and all terms and conditions of employment imposed by the health care facility, institution or hospital.|$|E
25|$|He mistook {{an editor}} and re-publisher for the {{original}} author. Sutton cites Wilkin (1852) which is an edited collected works, within which <b>the</b> <b>matching</b> phrase occurs, in Browne (1658).|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> next <b>match,</b> Victoria faced Lita for the WWE Women's Championship.
