McKernan was already a recognized theatre operator having previously run two other south side theatres before the Princess: <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>side</b> Gem and <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Side</b> Bijou.

40|$|The {{three major}} species Lethrinops ''pinkhead'', Otopharynx argyrosoma "red" and Copadichromis. cf virginalis {{which used to}} {{dominate}} the catches (by weight) of Lake Malombe {{in the past decade}} were investigated. In order to make rational recommendations regarding size and boundary of the existing sanctuary area (lightly fished), distribution and abundance, population structure and reproductive biology of the three species were related to habitat types of the southern part of <b>the</b> lake (<b>south</b> western <b>side</b> and <b>south</b> eastern <b>side).</b> Analysis of catch composition showed that species richness was higher in <b>the</b> <b>south</b> eastern <b>side</b> than in <b>the</b> <b>south</b> western <b>side</b> of <b>the</b> lake. Rare species such as Labeo mesops and Opsaridium microiepis were observed in <b>the</b> <b>south</b> eastern <b>side</b> and there was visual absence of such species in <b>the</b> <b>south</b> western <b>side</b> of <b>the</b> lake. The overall fish abundance was significantly greater in <b>the</b> <b>south</b> eastern <b>side</b> than in <b>the</b> <b>south</b> western <b>side</b> of <b>the</b> lake. In <b>the</b> <b>south</b> eastern <b>side,</b> <b>the</b> catch per unit effort (CPUE) was twice that of <b>the</b> <b>south</b> western <b>side</b> (P 0. 05). The length-frequency distribution analysis revealed that the three species had the same growth rate regardless of habitat type. However, females grew faster than males. An investigation of reproductive biology showed that the three species have low fecundity and they are asynchronous spawners, with a breeding peak during August and September period. Furthermore, the length-fecundity relationships for L. ''pinkhead'', and 0. argyrosoma "red" indicated that fecundity was more closely related to length in <b>the</b> <b>south</b> eastern <b>side</b> than in <b>the</b> <b>south</b> western <b>side.</b> Based on the above characteristics of L. ''pinkhead'', 0. argyrosoma "red" and C. cf virginalis, and the substrate types, it was strongly suggested that the existing sanctuary (lightly fished) in <b>the</b> <b>south</b> eastern <b>side</b> of <b>the</b> lake could immediately be enlarged to conserve the fish stocks, favourable substratum and aquatic animals that may be of tourists concern...|$|R

McKernan is considered an important trailblazer in Edmonton entertainment.
