5|$|After five {{successful}} seasons, Chris Carter {{wanted to}} tell the story of the series on a wider scale, which ultimately meant creating a feature film. He later explained that the main problem was to create a story for which the viewer would not need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>familiar</b> with the show's setting and the various story arcs.|$|E
5|$|The 1707 Acts of Union had merged the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Scotland {{into one}} {{national}} entity, but they retained separate legal systems. However, the House of Lords became {{the highest court}} of appeal in both English and Scottish law, and as a result, from 1707 Scottish cases on appeal from the Court of Session were sent there. To deal with these cases, a barrister had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>familiar</b> with both Scottish and English law, and Murray found his niche, acting in Scottish cases in the House of Lords as early as 1733. His work in Moncrieff v Moncrieff in 1734 established Murray as a brilliant young barrister praised for his performance by Lords Cowper and Parker. After Moncrieff, Murray was involved {{in almost every case}} in the House of Lords, whether it had been appealed from a Scottish court or not.|$|E
5|$|A {{farmer and}} his son were {{ploughing}} a field on the Isle of Mull using a team of four horses beside Loch Freisa, but work stalled {{after one of the}} horses lost a shoe and was unable to continue. Noticing a horse grazing nearby they decided to try using it as a replacement. Once harnessed to the wooden plough the horse appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>familiar</b> with the task, and initially worked steadily. As it began to work towards an area closest to the loch, it became restless and the farmer gently used a whip to encourage the animal to continue. It reacted by immediately transforming into a gigantic boobrie, giving out a loud bellow and diving into the loch, pulling the plough and the other three horses with it. The frightened farmer {{and his son}} watched as the creature swam to the centre of the loch then dived underwater, taking the other horses and plough with it. Seven hours later there was still no sign of the three horses.|$|E

5|$|The bridge {{ceiling was}} redesigned, with Michelson taking {{structural}} inspiration from a jet engine fan. Minor built a central bubble for the ceiling {{to give the}} bridge a human touch. Ostensibly, the bubble functioned {{as a piece of}} sophisticated equipment designed to inform the captain of the ship's attitude. Most of the bridge consoles, designed by Lee Cole, remained from the scrapped television series. Cole remained on the motion picture production and was responsible for much of the visual artwork created. To inform actors and series writers, Lee prepared a USS Enterprise Flight Manual as a continuity guide to control functions. It was necessary for all the main cast <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>familiar</b> with control sequences at their stations as each panel was activated by touch via heat-sensitive plates. The wattage of the light bulbs beneath the plastic console buttons was reduced from 25watts to 6watts after the generated heat began melting the controls. The seats were covered in girdle material, used because of its stretching capacity and ability to be easily dyed. For the science station, two consoles were rigged for hydraulic operation so that they could be rolled into the walls when not in use, but the system was disconnected when the crew discovered {{it would be easier to}} move them by hand.|$|E

25|$|That Arthur {{had gone}} unmentioned in the source closest {{to his own}} time, Gildas, was noticed at least {{as early as the}} 12th century hagiography that claims that Gildas had praised Arthur {{extensively}} but then excised him completely after Arthur killed the saint's brother, Hueil mab Caw. Modern writers have suggested the details of the battle were so well known that Gildas could have expected his audience <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>familiar</b> with them.|$|E
25|$|The Mooro {{group of}} Noongar were said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>familiar</b> with Mindarie, {{including}} Waukolup Hill in neighbouring Tamala Park, but no Mooro settlements were ever formally {{established in the}} area. After John Butler's initial expedition to Wanneroo in 1835, the first permanent European settler was sheep-farmer Bernard Clarkson, who first acquired a pastoral lease in 1888 of 13,000 acres in the areas comprising modern-day Mindarie, Clarkson, Quinns Rocks and Merriwa. The leases were known as the Mindarie Pastoral Company, and the lands were primarily used for sheep-herding by subsequent generations of the Clarkson family.|$|E

25|$|Hand {{signals are}} {{generally}} used when visibility allows, {{and there is}} a range of commonly used signals, with some variations. These signals are often also used as an alternative by professional divers. There is also a set of instructional hand signals used during training. Recreational divers are expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>familiar</b> with the standard set of hand signals used by their certification agency, and these have to a large extent been standardized internationally and are taught on entry level diving courses. A few additional specialised hand signals are commonly used by technical divers.|$|E
25|$|As both Korea and Taiwan {{had been}} under the {{domination}} of Japan for an indefinite amount of time, many citizens of both territories were forced to work under the Japanese military and experienced violence for a long time. These people who are used <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>familiar</b> with the harsh kind of treatment in their life combined with their anger towards the Japanese are then sent to Borneo to work as prison guards to replace the existing Japanese guards. In addition to their lack of knowledge and training {{for the treatment of}} POWs, many of them are involved in brutalising the POWs where the treatment of POWs are much worsened after the replacement of Japanese guards in Elopura by the Taiwanese in April 1943.|$|E
500|$|During the {{classification}} process, classifiers evaluate factors including whether a swimmer's physical limitations require {{him or her}} to start in the water, and how the swimmer enters the water in competition.

Classifiers are required <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>familiar</b> with the type of disability they are classifying, whether physical, visual or intellectual.|$|E

Israel assumed that the Jordanians would ignore the invasion, however, the Israelis were met with heavy resistance from them.|$|E
