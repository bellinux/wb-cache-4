5|$|After the Ottomans assumed {{power in}} 1517, <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not {{undertake}} any major renovations or repairs to the mosque itself, but <b>they</b> <b>did</b> to the Noble Sanctuary as a whole.

All construction was ordered by the Ottoman governors of Jerusalem and not the sultans themselves. The sultans did make additions to existing minarets, however. In 1816, the mosque was restored by Governor Sulayman Pasha al-Adil after having been in a dilapidated state.|$|E
