5|$|In 2003, the IAU officially {{released}} a statement to define what constitutes an extrasolar planet and what constitutes an orbiting star. To date, it remains the only official decision reached by the IAU on this issue. The 2006 committee {{did not attempt to}} challenge it, or to incorporate it into their definition, claiming <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> defining a planet was already difficult to resolve without also considering extrasolar planets.|$|E
5|$|Swedish King John III and Stefan Batory allied against Ivan IV in December 1577, despite {{problems}} caused {{by the death of}} Sigimund which meant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> the substantial inheritance due to John's wife, Catherine had not been resolved. Poland also claimed the whole of Livonia, without accepting Swedish rule of any part of it. The 120,000 daler lent in 1562 had still not been repaid, despite Sigismund's best intentions to settle it.|$|E
5|$|Carrie Prejean started {{volunteering}} {{with the}} San Diego chapter of JC's Girls in 2008 and became Miss California USA the following year. At the Miss USA 2009 competition, Prejean became {{the subject of}} a controversy because of her response to a question about same-sex marriage. Scher said that the controversy would not affect Prejean's involvement with the organization and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> same-sex marriage was not relevant to the group's activities. Prejean said that in volunteering with JC's Girls, she encountered pornographic models who, through exploitation and abuse, had developed very low self-esteem but who had regained a sense of their own dignity because of their interaction with JC's Girls volunteers.|$|E

50|$|It {{followed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issuing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> warrants, {{as well as}} the searches themselves, were unlawful. In addition, {{the material}} seized at the applicants' offices was not authorized by the warrant. The warrants, therefore, were declared invalid, and the respondents were directed to return the material seized.|$|R
5|$|From the 740s {{until the}} end of the Northumbrian kingdom, coins were issued by most kings, {{although}} in variable quantities. Until recently no coins from Eardwulf's reign were known, which suggested that it may have been a time of instability, or perhaps that the kingdom was impoverished by the payment of tribute to Offa and Coenwulf of Mercia. It is now known <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> new coins continued during Eardwulf's reign, as two of his coins were identified in the 1990s. Issues of new currency appear to have been limited under Eardwulf, and significant numbers of Northumbrian coins are not again attested until the reign of Eardwulf's son Eanred.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} during the preparations (May) for the Olympiad, Israel Gelfer (the Chairman of FIDE's Anti-cheating Committee) said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> anti-cheating became {{important in the}} last couple of years, with the development of telecommunication technologies (mobile phones, watches and even glasses) that have caused a problem which cannot be ignored. Gelfer explained that they are trying to balance between their will to fight against cheaters and at the same time not to create an unhealthy atmosphere in the chess world. The usual electronic scans before and after the game were of course prescribed, while novel procedures included: having a special anti-cheating arbiter (Klaus Deventer) with approximately 15 arbiters under his authority, one of whose charges was to carry out 30–40 checks during the round; and that players MUST inform their Match Arbiter when leaving the playing area.|$|E
5|$|Pearse {{found that}} there was no {{possibility}} of improvement but that Michael Schiavo's decisions might have been influenced by the potential to inherit what remained of Terri Schiavo's estate as long as he remained married to her. Due to a lack of a living will and questions regarding Michael's credibility, Pearse recommended denying his petition to remove her feeding tube. Pearse reported <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> conflict of interest applied to the Schindlers as well since, had Michael divorced Terri as they wanted him to, they would have inherited the remainder of Mrs. Schiavo's estate upon her death.|$|E

25|$|Linus Torvalds {{has criticized}} FSF for using GPLv3 {{as a weapon}} {{in the fight against}} DRM. Torvalds argues <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> DRM and that of a {{software}} license should be treated as two separate issues.|$|E
25|$|The court {{agreed with}} the Court of Appeal in {{deciding}} that the Moloney guidelines were defective in <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> probability should specifically be addressed by the trial judge, and since that had not occurred in the present case, the prosecutor's appeal was dismissed, and the convictions for manslaughter stood.|$|E
25|$|The Court {{declined}} {{to rule on}} the issue of the pending charges themselves, reasoning <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> petitioner's criminal responsibility at the time of the alleged offenses has not yet been adjudicated, and therefore it would be premature for the Court to dismiss the charges against petitioner.|$|E

25|$|In {{his book}} Blood-Red Arab Flag, Charles E. Davies alleges <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> piracy in the Persian Gulf {{appeared}} to have escalated in 1797.

25|$|The main right-wing {{opposition}} party UMP challenged {{the law in}} the Constitutional Council, which had one month to rule on whether the law conformed to the Constitution.

25|$|It is in {{contemporary}} Anglicanism <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> homosexuality {{and its relationship}} to people in the episcopate has been confronted openly. Indeed, the first large mainstream church to ever consecrate an openly gay bishop who was not celibate has been the Episcopal Church in the United States of America, a member of the Anglican Communion, who consecrated Gene Robinson diocesan bishop of the Diocese of New Hampshire in 2003.|$|E
25|$|Hume's {{argument}} {{is supported by}} modern day compatibilists such as R. E. Hobart, a pseudonym of philosopher Dickinson S. Miller. However, P. F. Strawson argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> whether we hold one another morally responsible does not ultimately depend on the truth or falsity of a metaphysical thesis such as determinism. This is because our so holding one another is a non-rational human sentiment that is not predicated on such theses.|$|E
25|$|Europeans are {{concerned}} about antisemitism because, historically, societies with a large degree of antisemitism are self-destructive. Furthermore, the Jews of Europe have generally aligned themselves with Europe's democratic elite, a class whose future is uncertain according to the Economist Intelligence Unit. This {{is one reason why}} First Vice-President of the European Commission Frans Timmermans said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> European antisemitism was more important than many economic, financial, and market issues facing Europe.|$|E

25|$|These {{movements}} share {{fundamental differences}} in the view on open software. The main, factionalizing difference between the groups {{is the relationship between}} open source and proprietary software. Often makers of proprietary software, such as Microsoft, may make efforts to support open source software to remain competitive. Members of the open source community are willing to coexist with the makers of proprietary software and feel <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> whether software is open source is a matter of practicality.|$|E
25|$|At {{least one}} {{contributing}} mechanism for reduced spermatogenesis in cryptorchid testes is temperature. The temperature of testes in the scrotum {{is at least}} a couple of degrees cooler than in the abdomen. Animal experiments in the middle of the 20th century suggested that raising the temperature could damage fertility. Some circumstantial evidence suggests tight underwear and other practices that raise the testicular temperature for prolonged periods can be associated with lower sperm counts. Nevertheless, research in recent decades suggests <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> fertility is more complex than a simple matter of temperature. It seems likely that subtle or transient hormone deficiencies or other factors that lead to a lack of descent also impair the development of spermatogenic tissue.|$|E
25|$|The Treaty of Lausanne, {{signed on}} July 24, 1923 between the Allied powers and Turkey, was {{composed}} after Turkey requested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> Mosul (Nineveh) be re-examined. Assyrians once again {{were not allowed}} to participate as Great Britain interfered, but they were promised again that their rights would be protected. It is worth mentioning that Agha Petros, General of the Assyrian Army, attended the opening ceremonies. The United States stood with Great Britain in these deliberations, the latter promising 20% of the oil industry business be awarded to American companies. Turkey lost its appeal to win Mosul back based on Great Britain's claims that the region would be saved for the future settlement of the Kurdish and Assyrian people, but no final agreement was reached.|$|E
