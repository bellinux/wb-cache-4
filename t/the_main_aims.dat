US funding for the military component of Plan Colombia was on average US$540 million per year between 2000 and 2008, while the Colombian government invested approximately US$812 million per year. Following the September 11 attacks, Plan Colombia resources began to be used for anti-guerrilla operations. Over 80% of US aid to Colombia between 2000 and 2007 was military assistance, which came to reinforce the modernization of the Colombian armed forces under the Pastrana and Uribe administrations.|$|E

One of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>aims</b> in the Skaugum Tunnel project was therefore to avoid similar leaks, and the criteria were set to [...] per minute per [...] This was achieved by using sufficient time for the pre-injection, as well as continuous pregrouting through the entire tunnel. However, water still dripped into the tunnel, which caused several types of damage. In some places, it dripped onto the track causing it to rust, while in other places it fell onto electrical equipment. There were also issues with water running down the walls and collecting in the cable conduit, and the limestone in the water mixing with the ballast. By 2011, the emergency lighting system had to be replaced {{because of the high}} humidity. The National Rail Administration has stated that savings made by the specifications in the water and frost protection methods have caused high maintenance costs because the small leaks which are present {{have done a lot of}} harm. In addition, areas with leaks suffer from icing. This has been part of a trend where older tunnels are nearly maintenance-free, while newer tunnels have incurred high maintenance costs.|$|E

500|$|The Housing Trust {{was a key}} plank in Playford's {{campaign}} to keep costs low and promote investment. By providing cheap housing, workers could also be persuaded to accept lower salaries, therefore keeping production costs down. In 1940, Playford introduced the Housing Improvement Act to parliament, having seen {{the benefits of the}} Housing Trust's activities. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>aims</b> of the legislation were [...] "to improve the adverse housing conditions" [...] by replacing [...] "insanitary, old, crowded, or obsolete dwelling houses" [...] with better-quality buildings—at the time many older residences in the city centre were made of corrugated iron and many areas were slum-like. The law forced landlords to provide a minimum standard of housing and enacted rent controls, setting a maximum rent for various houses; at the time many landlords bought large numbers of low-quality dwellings and charged tenants exorbitant prices. It also expanded the role of the Housing Trust, potentially undercutting the rentier class. Labor were taken aback by Playford's move, as this was the start of a trend whereby the nominally conservative government pursued policies that were more left-wing than other Labor governments across the country. After expressing shock at Playford's [...] "loving kindness to the poor and distressed", Labor helped to get the legislation—which threatened the interests of the landlord class that traditionally supported the LCL—passed into law. During one 15-year period, Housing Trust rents were not increased once despite steady inflation.|$|E

2500|$|On 3 May 1977, the UUAC {{organized}} a general strike. It {{was seen by}} the public as [...] "Paisley's strike", due to his prominent role in it. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>aims</b> of the strike were to restore devolved government to Northern Ireland under a system of simple majority (i.e. unionist) rule, and to force the British Government to introduce tougher security measures against the IRA. As in 1974, loyalist paramilitaries tried to enforce the strike by blocking roads, intimidating workers and attacking businesses that refused to co-operate. However, unlike in 1974, many workers refused to join the strike and the security forces were better prepared. The Ulster Service Corps set up roadblocks and carried out patrols in rural areas. Some members carried guns, although these were generally legally-held firearms. During a speech in the House of Commons, Paisley claimed to have taken part {{in some of these}} patrols and encouraged his supporters to join the group. On 10 May, Protestant bus driver Harry Bradshaw was shot dead by loyalists for working during the strike, and UDR soldier John Geddis was killed when loyalists bombed a petrol station that had stayed open. That same day, Paisley, Baird {{and other members of the}} UUAC were arrested at a roadblock outside Ballymena. Paisley was charged with obstruction of the highway and then released.|$|E
