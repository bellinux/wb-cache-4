5|$|The Western Xia met {{a similar}} fate, {{becoming}} an unreliable vassal to the Mongols by seeking to secure alliances with Jin and Song.

Mzilikazi died in 1868 and, following a violent power struggle, was succeeded by his son, Lobengula.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} {{insufficient}} data to accurately estimate population sizes {{at the time}} of contact with the Spanish, early Spanish reports suggest that sizeable Maya populations existed in Petén, particularly around the central lakes and along the rivers. Before their defeat in 1697 the Itza controlled or influenced much of Petén and parts of Belize. The Itza were warlike, and their martial prowess impressed both neighbouring Maya kingdoms and their Spanish enemies. <b>Their</b> <b>capital</b> was Nojpetén, an island city upon Lake Petén Itzá; it has developed into the modern town of Flores, which is the capital of the Petén department of Guatemala. The Itza spoke a variety of Yucatecan Maya.|$|E

5|$|Around 1450 the Chajoma, led {{by their}} king Lajuj No'j, moved to Mixco Viejo (Jilotepeque Viejo) from Ochal to make <b>their</b> <b>capital</b> more {{inaccessible}} to their hostile neighbours. In spite of this, Iximche defeated the Chajoma and Jilotepeque Viejo became {{subject to the}} Kaqchikel kingdom. Groups C and E show Kaqchikel influence in their architectural styles, while groups A and B have a purer Chajoma architectural style. Both ballcourts {{appear to have been}} remodelled after the Kaqchikel fashion, with thick coatings of stucco.|$|E
5|$|Before their {{defeat in}} 1697 the Itza {{controlled}} or influenced much of Petén {{and parts of}} Belize. The Itza were warlike, and <b>their</b> <b>capital</b> was Nojpetén, an island city upon Lake Petén Itzá. The Kowoj were the second in importance; they were hostile towards their Itza neighbours. The Kowoj were located around the eastern Petén lakes. The Yalain occupied a territory that extended eastwards to Tipuj in Belize. Other groups in Petén are less well known, and their precise territorial extent and political makeup remains obscure; among them were the Chinamita, the Icaiche, the Kejache, the Lakandon Ch'ol, the Manche Ch'ol, and the Mopan.|$|E

5|$|Do-Ashiayana Manzil was a {{portable}} wooden house {{used by the}} Mughal emperors during their visits outside <b>their</b> <b>capital.</b> This was a double storied house built with a platform supported over 16 pillars, of 6 yards height.

This functioned as a sleeping quarter for the king and also for worship and holding Jharokha Darshan, and considered it an emulation of Hindu practice.|$|E

Shiva Prakash, the Kalachuri period {{is one of}} the high points of medieval Kannada literature. Basavanna (or Basava), a social reformer and the prime minister of Kalachuri King Bijjala II, is generally regarded as the inspiration behind this movement.
