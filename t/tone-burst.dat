50|$|ITU-R 468 (originally {{defined in}} CCIR {{recommendation}} 468-4; {{sometimes referred to}} as CCIR-1k) is a standard relating to noise measurement, widely used when measuring noise in audio systems. The standard, now referred to as ITU-R BS.468-4, defines a weighting filter curve, together with a quasi-peak rectifier having special characteristics as defined by specified <b>tone-burst</b> tests.

50|$|Experiments in the BBC led to BBC Research Department Report EL-17, The Assessment of Noise in Audio Frequency Circuits, {{in which}} {{experiments}} on numerous test subjects were reported, {{using a variety}} of noises ranging from clicks to <b>tone-bursts</b> to pink noise. Subjects were asked to compare these with a 1 kHz tone, and final scores were then compared with measured noise levels using various combinations of weighting filter and quasi-peak detector then in existence (such as those defined in a now discontinued German DIN standard). This led to the CCIR-468 standard which defined a new weighting curve and quasi-peak rectifier.|$|R
50|$|It is {{important}} to realise that the 468 specification covers both weighted and 'unweighted' (using a 22 Hz to 22 kHz 18 dB/octave bandpass filter) measurement and that both use a very special quasi-peak rectifier with carefully devised dynamics (A-weighting uses RMS detection for no particular reason). Rather than having a simple 'integration time' this detector requires implementation with two cascaded 'peak followers' each with different attack time-constants carefully chosen to control the response to both single and repeating <b>tone-bursts</b> of various durations. This ensures that measurements on impulsive noise take proper account of our reduced hearing sensitivity to short bursts. This quasi-peak measurement is also called psophometric weighting.|$|R

50|$|There are {{two basic}} {{components}} in an EMAT transducer. One is a magnet {{and the other is}} an electric coil. The magnet can be a permanent magnet or an electromagnet, which produces a static or a quasi-static magnetic field. In EMAT terminology, this field is called bias magnetic field. The electric coil is driven with an alternating current (AC) electric signal at ultrasonic frequency, typically in the range from 20 kHz to 10 MHz. Based on the application needs, the signal can be a continuous wave, a spike pulse, or a <b>tone-burst</b> signal. The electric coil with AC current also generates an AC magnetic field. When the test material is close to the EMAT, ultrasonic waves are generated in the test material through the interaction of the two magnetic fields.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Bimodal hearing {{refers to}} the {{condition}} in which electrical hearing via a cochlear implant (CI) is combined with residual hearing in the non-implanted ear. Several studies demonstrate improvements in speech perception in noise and sound localization. However, the mechanisms underlying these benefits are still unclear. The goal {{of this study is}} to gain insight into the processing of simultaneously presented electrical and acoustical signals using auditory brainstem responses (ABRs). Methods: Seven bimodal listeners were included. The non-implanted ear was stimulated with 500 Hz tone-bursts; the implanted ear with biphasic pulses. Before starting the ABR recording, the electrical stimulation was loudness- and pitch-balanced to 500 Hz <b>tone-bursts</b> presented at 45 dB SL. Subsequently, ABRs were recorded in response to monaural acoustical, monaural electrical and bimodal stimulation. The bimodal ABRs were then compared to the monaural responses. Results: Electrical ABRs were found in all subjects for both the monaural and bimodal condition. In contrast, acoustical ABRs could only be recorded in two out of seven subjects. In one of these subjects, acoustical ABRs were found in both the monaural and bimodal condition. In the other subject, the acoustical ABR was only present in the monaural condition. Conclusion: To our knowledge, the present study is the first to use <b>tone-bursts</b> in a bimodal ABR recording paradigm. Preliminary data show that bimodal ABRs can be recorded. However, obtaining these responses is still challenging due to several reasons. First, inter-aural processing of bimodal stimuli may vary depending on the bimodal stimulus paradigm. Second, the degree and configuration of residual hearing seems to affect bimodal ABRs. A new protocol to obtain bimodal ABRs is proposed...|$|R

The first one considers dedicated excitation signals such as switched-off noise sources or impulsive <b>tone-bursts.</b> The derived ML estimator allows to determine the RT from the received signal even in the presence of background or measurement noise and achieves a significantly higher estimation accuracy than comparable approaches. The second approach allows to estimate the RT from reverber-ant and noisy speech signals without a priori knowledge.

40|$|Currently, {{the most}} {{commonly}} used electrophysiological tests for cochlear implant evaluation are Averaged Electrical Voltages (AEV), Electrical Advisory Brainstem Responses (EABR) and Neural Response Telemetry (NRT). The present paper focuses on the study of acoustic auditory cortical responses, or slow vertex responses, which are not widely used due to the difficulty in recording, especially in young children. Aims of this study were validation of slow vertex responses and their possible applications in monitoring postimplant results, particularly restoration of hearing and auditory maturation. In practice, the use of <b>tone-bursts,</b> also through hearing aids or cochlear implants, as in slow vertex responses, allows many more frequencies to be investigated and louder intensities to be reached than with other tests based on a click as stimulus. Study design focused on latencies of N 1 and P 2 slow vertex response peaks in cochlear implants. The study population comprised 45 implant recipients (aged 2 to 70 years), divided into 5 different homogeneous groups according to chronological age, age at onset of deafness, and age at implantation. For each subject, slow vertex responses and free-field auditory responses (PTAS) were recorded for <b>tone-bursts</b> at 500 and 2000 Hz before cochlear implant surgery (using hearing aid amplification) and during scheduled sessions at 3 rd and 12 th month after implant activation. Results showed that N 1 and P 2 latencies decreased in all groups starting from 3 rd through 12 th month after activation. Subjects implanted before school age or at least before age 8 yrs showed the widest latency changes. All subjects showed a reduction in the gap between subjective thresholds (obtained with free field auditory responses) and objective thresholds (obtained with slow vertex responses), obtained in presurgery stage and after cochlear implant. In conclusion, a natural evolution of neurophysiological cortical activities of the auditory pathway, over time, was found especially in young children with prelingual deafness and implanted in preschool age. Cochlear implantation appears to provide hearing restoration, demonstrated by the sharp reduction of the gap between subjective free field auditory responses and slow vertex responses threshold obtained with hearing aids vs. cochlear implant...|$|R

In this study, the subharmonic response of polymer-shelled UCAs with a mean diameter of 1. 1 μm excited with 40 -MHz <b>tone-bursts</b> of 1 – 20 cycles was analyzed. UCAs were diluted in water and streamed through a flow phantom that permitted single-bubble backscatter events to be acquired at peak-negative pressures from 0. 75 to 5. 0 MPa.

Both techniques were found to be satisfactory and in good agreement over the limited frequency range (38 to 39 kHz) imposed by the characteristics of the transducer-rod combination. In the pulsed mode, measurement of the changes in attenuation and phase of the pulses (<b>tone-bursts)</b> in the rod when the rod is immersed in the sediment allow calculation of the real and imaginary parts of the complex shear modulus. In the resonant mode, measurement of the changes in resonant frequency and the electrical resistance at resonance upon immersion allow a similar calculation of the complex shear modulus.

The {{aim of this study}} is to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with improved axial resolution and reduced ripple artifacts in the SHI using chirp coded excitation. Experiments are performed using a 2. 25 MHz transducer mounted coaxially at a distance of 1 - 10 cm with a 0. 2 mm hydrophone in a tank containing deionised,degassed water. The applied linear chirp signals have 10 sec duration, and fractional bandwidths (FBW) of 20 % and 40 %. In the experiments, the 2. 25 MHz <b>tone-burst</b> signal of same duration is used for comparison. The pressure level of each waveform is calibrated and the mechanical index of 0. 75 is set at the focus of the transducer. The harmonic matched filtering is applied to the received signal to perform pulse compression of the individual harmonic chirp components to recover axial resolution.

The first experiment showed that discrimination ability increased with bandwidth for noise durations up to 100 ms.

A final experiment, using a stimulus consisting of 5 ms Hanning-windowed <b>tone-bursts</b> randomly distributed over time, investigated whether stimulus duration and amount of information differently affect the processing capacity of the auditory system. Results showed that the number of degrees of freedom in the stimulus, not its duration, predominantly influenced the ability to discriminate.

Studies have used a repetition rate of ~ 5. 1 Hz mainly due to a presumption that oVEMP, like cervical VEMP, should produce best responses for ~ 5 Hz, although there is paucity of experimental evidence to support this hypothesis. 52 healthy individuals in the age range of 17 - 35 years underwent air-conduction oVEMP elicited by 500 Hz <b>tone-bursts</b> using seven different repetition rates (3. 1, 5. 1, 10. 1, 15. 1, 20. 1, 25. 1 and 30. 1 Hz).

However, significantly longer latencies were observed only for 20. 1 Hz and larger amplitudes for 3. 1 and 5. 1 Hz (P< 0. 05). There {{was no significant difference between}} the rates of 3. 1 Hz and 5. 1 Hz. However 3. 1 Hz produced poorer signal-to-noise ratio and required considerably longer time and thereby had lesser efficiency than 5. 1 Hz (P< 0. 05).

The present study investigates binaural interaction {{at the level of the}} auditory brainstem. It is hypothesized that brainstem binaural interaction deteriorates with advancing age. Design: Forty-two subjects of various age participated in the study. Auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) were recorded using clicks and 500 Hz tone-bursts. ABRs were elicited by monaural right, monaural left, and binaural stimulation. Binaural interaction was investigated in two ways. First, grand averages of the binaural interaction component were computed for each age group. Second, wave V characteristics of the binaural ABR were compared with those of the summed left and right ABRs. Results: Binaural interaction in the click ABR was demonstrated by shorter latencies and smaller amplitudes in the binaural compared with the summed monaural responses. For 500 Hz <b>tone-burst</b> ABR, no latency differences were found. However, amplitudes were significantly smaller in the binaural than summed monaural condition. An age-effect was found for 500 Hz <b>tone-burst,</b> but not for click ABR. Conclusions: Brainstem binaural interaction seems to decline with age. Interestingly, these changes seem to be stimulus-dependent. 9 page(s...|$|E

Study design: Transtympanic electrocochleography (ECochG) was recorded from two adult patients carrying the R 445 H OPA 1 mutation, and from five children with mutations in the OTOF gene. Cochlear potentials to clicks or <b>tone-bursts</b> were compared to recordings obtained from 16 normally hearing subjects. Electrically-evoked neural responses recorded through the cochlear implant were also obtained. Results: The cochlear microphonic (CM) was recorded from all subjects, with normal amplitudes. After cancelling the CM, cochlear potentials were of negative polarity with reduced amplitude and prolonged duration compared to controls in both groups of patients. Prolonged negative responses were recorded as low as 50 – 90 dB below behavioural threshold in subjects with OTOF mutations whereas in the OPA 1 disorder the prolonged potentials were correlated with hearing threshold. A compound action potential (CAP) was superimposed on the prolonged activity at high stimulation intensity in two children with mutations in the OTOF gene while CAPs were absent in the OPA 1 disorder. Electrically-evoked compound action potentials (e-CAPs) were only recorded from subjects with OTOF mutations following cochlear implantation.

To {{evaluate}} {{the viability of}} disentangling a series of overlapping 'cortical auditory evoked potentials' (CAEPs) elicited by different stimuli using least-squares (LS) deconvolution, and to assess the adaptation of CAEPs for different stimulus onset-asynchronies (SOAs). Approach. Optimal aperiodic stimulus sequences were designed by controlling the condition number of matrices associated with the LS deconvolution technique. First, theoretical considerations of LS deconvolution were assessed in simulations in which multiple artificial overlapping responses were recovered. Second, biological CAEPs were recorded in response to continuously repeated stimulus trains containing six different <b>tone-bursts</b> with frequencies 8, 4, 2, 1, 0. 5, 0. 25 kHz separated by SOAs jittered around 150 (120 - 185), 250 (220 - 285) and 650 (620 - 685) ms. The control condition had a fixed SOA of 1175 ms. In a second condition, using the same SOAs, trains of six stimuli were separated by a silence gap of 1600 ms. Twenty-four adults with normal hearing (< 20 dB HL) were assessed. Main results. Results showed disentangling {{of a series of}} overlapping responses using LS deconvolution on simulated waveforms as well as on real EEG data. The use of rapid presentation and LS deconvolution did not however, allow the recovered CAEPs to have a higher signal-to-noise ratio than for slowly presented stimuli. The LS deconvolution technique enables the analysis of a series of overlapping responses in EEG. Significance. LS deconvolution is a useful technique for the study of adaptation mechanisms of CAEPs for closely spaced stimuli whose characteristics change from stimulus to stimulus.

The cognitive P 300 response was elicited using an oddball paradigm with a 500 Hz <b>tone-burst</b> as the standard and a 250 Hz <b>tone-burst</b> as the deviant stimulus. P 300 s were recorded in response to CI-only and bimodal stimulation. Results: In four out of five subjects, bimodal stimulation elicited better P 300 than CI-only stimulation. In these subjects, latencies were shorter and amplitudes were larger in the bimodal condition. The results on P 300 measures were in agreement with the subjects’ behavioral discrimination abilities. Conclusion: These preliminary data reveal that the bimodal condition elicited better P 300 responses than the CI-only condition. Bimodal listeners may have used various cues to perform the discrimination task...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} a Wavelet Coefficient based approach using experiments {{to understand the}} sensitivity of ultrasonic signals due to parametric variation of a crack configuration in a metal plate. A PZT patch sensor/actuator system integrated to a metal plate with through-thickness crack is used. The proposed approach uses piezoelectric patches, {{which can be used}} to both actuate and sense the ultrasonic signals. While this approach leads to more flexibility and reduced cost for larger scalability of the sensor/actuator network, the complexity of the signals increases as compared to what is encountered in conventional ultrasonic NDE problems using selective wave modes. A Damage Index (DI) has been introduced, which is function of wavelet coefficient. Experiments have been carried out for various crack sizes, crack orientations and band-limited <b>tone-burst</b> signal through FIR filter. For a 1 cm long crack interrogated with 20 kHz <b>tone-burst</b> signal, the Damage Index (DI) for the horizontal crack orientation increases by about 70 % with respect to that for 135 degrees oriented crack and it increases by about 33 % with respect to the vertically oriented crack. The detailed results reported in this paper is a step forward to developing computational schemes for parametric identification of damage using sensor/actuator network and ultrasonic wave...|$|E
40|$|A {{majority}} of the research in Structural Health Monitoring focuses on detection of damage. This paper presents a method of imaging crack damage in an isotropic material using the Time Reversal imaging algorithm. Inputs for the algorithm are obtained via computational simulation of the propagation field of a crack in a medium under <b>tone-burst</b> excitation. The approach is similar to existing techniques such as Diffraction Tomography which makes use of the multi-static data matrix constructed using scatter field measurements from the computational simulation. Results indicate excellent reconstruction quality and accurate estimation of damage size...|$|E
40|$|Ultrasonic Lamb waves {{provide a}} useful {{means for the}} {{nondestructive}} determination of the material elastic constants of shell structures such as plates, pipes, cans and many others. A new optical technique is described for the measurement of the dispersion curves of Lamb wave modes. The experimental system employs the wedge method for the excitation of Lamb modes in aluminum plates of thickness {{in the range of}} a few millimetres. Long <b>tone-bursts</b> are used in order to ensure the generation of narrowband ultrasonic waves. Furtherm ore, an appropriate selection of the wedge angle allows one to generate only the desired individual Lamb mode. The detection of the surface out-of-plane displacements is performed by our self-developed pulsed TV holography system, which evaluates the optical phase by the Spatial Fourier Transform Method. Inasmuch as a whole -field measurement is realized, the wavelength of the excited mode can be precisely measured from the TV holography displacement maps. On the other hand, the wave frequency is measured by a pointwise method, namely a Michelson speckle interferometer. The phase velocity is directly obtained as the product of these two values. Measurements are done for several frequencies and several Lamb modes, thus yielding a collection of experimental points. By fitting these results to the theoretical Rayleigh-Lamb frequency spectrum, values of the shear wave velocity and the Poisson's ratio of the plate material are obtained. For a better accuracy in the measurements, the longitudinal phase velocity was directly determined by the pulse-echo method. The additional knowledge of the mass density allows one to calculate the Young's modulus. Ministerio de Educación y Ciencia y Comisión Europea (FEDER) | Ref.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{cellular}} mechanisms {{leading to}} noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) involve {{the generation of}} reactive oxygen species (ROS). Recent studies on glutathione (GSH) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) show that they can protect the cochlea from ROS-derived damage, increasing the levels of endogenous cellular defences. The {{purpose of this study}} was to verify NAC's oto-protective efficacy and determine if drug administration timing influences the degree of oto-protection. MATERIAL/METHODS: Forty male Sprague Dawley albino rats were divided in four groups exposed to 8 -kHz 105 -dB SPL continuous noise. The groups were treated with diverse NAC administration modalities: group A received 4 injections during 48 hours (pre- and post-noise exposure), group B 1 injection prior to exposure, group C 1 injection 24 h after exposure, and group D served as untreated controls. The single injection dosage was 375 mg/kg; the controls received an equal volume of saline solution. Cochlear function was assessed by pre- and post-noise (after 168 hours) recordings of distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) and auditory brainstem responses (ABR). DPOAEs were obtained by three different asymmetric protocols (P 1 = 60 - 50, P 2 = 50 - 40, P 3 = 40 - 30 dB SPL) for frequencies of 4 - 16 kHz. ABR responses were elicited by <b>tone-bursts</b> at 8 and 16 kHz. RESULTS: The most important outcome of the study was that the administration of NAC significantly reduced the threshold shifts in the treated animals. NAC provided different degrees of threshold reduction according to the timing of the drug injection. CONCLUSIONS: The role played by the timing of NAC injection was important for the OHC protection index. From a DPOAE perspective, the best protection scheme was observed in the group receiving NAC after noise exposure, but full recovery of cochlear function was not observed in any of the tested groups...|$|R
40|$|The {{response}} of the brain to a sensory stimulus may present itself in the electroencephalogram (EEG) as evoked and/or induced activity. While the evoked response is given by peaks and troughs in the signal, time-locked and phase-locked to the stimuli, the induced response is time- but not phase-locked, and {{can be considered as}} an increase or a decrease in the power of EEG in a specific frequency band at a specific time range with regard to the stimulus onset. The induced response does not have the same phase following successive stimuli. It is believed that cognition and perception of a stimulus present themselves primarily as the induced response in the EEG. In this paper, the induced {{response of}} the brain to auditory speech stimuli is investigated and different approaches to detect induced activity are compared. It is shown that there is an increase in theta and delta power in response to words compared to the baseline, starting around 500 ms after their onset. During this time, there is also an increase in pairwise coherence between the posterior electrodes. In response to tone bursts, a change in pairwise coherence was observed in the beta band starting around 200 ms. To the best of our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} such responses have been described using simple protocols without complex stimulus manipulations being involved. Responses in the EEG to speech rather than the more conventional <b>tone-bursts</b> or clicks suggests that it may be feasible to use the EEG as an objective means to demonstrate brain activation to salient real world stimuli. This would be of particular benefit in investigating access to speech in patients who are unable or unwilling to reliably respond to conventional subjective experimental protocols, such as infant...|$|R
