5|$|The war had a {{profound}} effect on Australian society in other ways also. Indeed, for many Australians the nation's involvement is seen as a symbol of its emergence as an international actor, while many of the notions of Australian character and nationhood that exist <b>today</b> <b>have</b> their origins in the war. 64 Australians were awarded the Victoria Cross during the First World War.|$|E
5|$|The country's fallen {{of the two}} World Wars <b>today</b> <b>have</b> no {{official}} commemoration, either in Zimbabwe or overseas. The national war memorial obelisk still stands, but the relief sculptures and inscriptions have been removed. The stone cross monument near Mutare (as Umtali is now called) {{is one of the}} few memorials that remains intact and in its place, atop what is now called Cross Kopje; its meaning has been largely forgotten.|$|E
5|$|The towers are semi-circular. Their inner flanks have lobed arches as decorations, a North African motif {{introduced}} to Egypt by the Fatimids. The vestibule {{to the right}} contains a half-domed recess with elegantly carved arches at each corner. The gates were massive, weighing four tons. The gates <b>today</b> <b>have</b> two minarets, open to visitors, from which the area may be viewed. Additions were made during the 15th century.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, {{horses were}} {{harvested}} from the feral herds {{and used as}} riding and stock horses, {{as well as being}} used for their meat, hair and hides. Originally there were many herds that roamed land owned by the British Crown and the native Māori, but many were eradicated with the intensification of large scale farming and forestry operations combined with increased mechanization that decreased the need for stock horses. Kaimanawa horses <b>today</b> <b>have</b> the highest amount of genetic similarity with the Thoroughbred and other Thoroughbred cross breeds.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the war, Australians {{were far}} more circumspect. The nation's {{involvement}} cost more than 60,000 Australian lives and many more were left unable to work {{as a result of their}} injuries. The impact of the war was felt in many other areas as well. Financially it was very costly, while the effect on the social and political landscape was considerable and threatened to cause serious divides in the nation's social fabric. Conscription was possibly the most contentious issue and ultimately, despite having conscription for home service, Australia was one of only two combatants not to use conscripts in the fighting. Nevertheless, for many Australians the nation's involvement in World War I and the Gallipoli campaign was seen as a symbol of its emergence as an international actor, while many of the notions of the Australian character and nationhood that exist <b>today</b> <b>have</b> their origins in the war and Anzac Day is commemorated as a national holiday.|$|E
5|$|From the 13th to 20th century, {{there were}} Swedish-speaking {{communities}} in Estonia, {{particularly on the}} islands (e.g., Hiiumaa, Vormsi, Ruhnu; in Swedish, known as Dagö, Ormsö, Runö, respectively) {{along the coast of}} the Baltic, communities which <b>today</b> <b>have</b> all disappeared. The Swedish-speaking minority was represented in parliament, and entitled to use their native language in parliamentary debates. After the loss of Estonia to the Russian Empire in the early 18th century, around 1,000 Estonian Swedish speakers were forced to march to southern Ukraine, where they founded a village, Gammalsvenskby ("Old Swedish Village"). A few elderly people in the village still speak Swedish and observe the holidays of the Swedish calendar, although the dialect is most likely facing extinction.|$|E

5|$|Since the country's {{reconstitution}} and recognised independence as Zimbabwe in 1980, Robert Mugabe's {{administration has}} pulled down many monuments and plaques making {{reference to the}} dead of the First and Second World Wars, perceiving them as reminders of white minority rule and colonialism that go against what the modern state stands for. This view is partly rooted in the association of these memorials with those commemorating the British South Africa Company's dead of the Matabele Wars, {{as well as those}} memorialising Rhodesian servicemen killed during the Bush War. Many Zimbabweans see their nation's involvement in the World Wars as a consequence of colonial rule that {{had more to do with}} the white community than the black majority. Southern Rhodesia's dead of the two World Wars <b>today</b> <b>have</b> no official commemoration, either in Zimbabwe or overseas.|$|E
5|$|The colours {{would have}} first {{appeared}} bright and crisp, but over five-and-a-half centuries the painting has acquired layers of grey dirt which darken {{the tone and}} render the colours faint and pallid. Normally these layers of dirt would be removed by restorers, but given the delicate and fragile nature of a work painted in a water-soluble medium, {{it is impossible to}} do so without removing large amounts of pigment. The colours as they appear <b>today</b> <b>have</b> faded from their original hues. The Virgin's mantle is now brown but would have been painted as blue. Joseph's tabard, once blue, now appears as green. The original indigos of the landscape are lost, while the azurite in Nicodemus's collar has darkened.|$|E
5|$|The territory's {{contributions}} {{during the}} First World War {{became a major}} entry in many histories of the colony, and {{a great source of}} pride for the white community, as well as for some black Rhodesians. It played a part in the UK government's decision to grant self-government in 1923, and remained prominent in the national consciousness for decades. When the colonial government unilaterally declared independence from Britain in 1965, it deliberately did so on Armistice Day, 11 November, and signed the proclamation at 11:00 local time. Since the territory's reconstitution and recognised independence as Zimbabwe in 1980, the modern government has removed many references to the war, such as memorial monuments and plaques, from public view, regarding them as unwelcome vestiges of white minority rule and colonialism. The Zimbabwean cultural memory has largely forgotten the First World War; the country's war dead <b>today</b> <b>have</b> no official commemoration, either there or overseas.|$|E

5|$|World War II {{prompted}} {{major changes}} in Southern Rhodesia's financial and military policy, and accelerated the process of industrialisation. The territory's participation in the EATS brought about major economic and infrastructural developments {{and led to the}} post-war immigration of many former airmen, contributing to the growth of the white population to over double its pre-war size by 1951. The war remained prominent in the national consciousness for decades afterwards. Since the country's reconstitution as Zimbabwe in 1980, the modern government has removed many references to the World Wars, such as memorial monuments and plaques, from public view, regarding them as unwelcome vestiges of white minority rule and colonialism. Southern Rhodesia's dead of the war <b>today</b> <b>have</b> no official commemoration, either in Zimbabwe or overseas.|$|E

25|$|Barbiturates such as {{phenobarbital}} {{were long}} used as anxiolytics and hypnotics, but <b>today</b> <b>have</b> been largely replaced by benzodiazepines for these purposes because {{the latter are}} less toxic in overdose.

25|$|The term {{may be used}} in a moral sense—condemning, taking {{advantage}} of others' misfortunes—or in a legal sense where interest rates may be regulated by law.
