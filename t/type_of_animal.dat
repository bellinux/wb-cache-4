5|$|The {{different}} types of rock beneath the soil strongly influence the landscape; they determine the type of vegetation that will grow, and ultimately the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> that will inhabit the area. Limestone has fissures and is soluble in water, therefore rivers {{have been able to}} carve deep, narrow valleys. The rivers then often find routes underground, creating cave systems. Millstone Grit is insoluble but porous, absorbing water which seeps through the grits, until it meets the less porous shales beneath, creating springs where it reaches the surface. The shales are friable and easily attacked by frost and form areas that are vulnerable to landslides, as on Mam Tor.|$|E
5|$|The {{theological}} {{concerns were}} twofold: first, putting {{man at the}} same level as monkeys or apes would lower the spiritually higher position that man was assumed to have in the great chain of being, and second, because the Bible says man was created in the image of God (theomorphism), if monkeys/apes and humans were not distinctly and separately designed, that would mean monkeys and apes were created in the image of God as well. This was something many could not accept. The conflict between world views that was caused by asserting man was a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> would simmer for a century until the much greater, and still ongoing, creation–evolution controversy began in earnest with the publication of On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin in 1859.|$|E

25|$|The Dead Sea scrolls {{were written}} on {{parchment}} made of processed animal hide known as vellum (approximately 85.5 – 90.5% of the scrolls), papyrus (estimated at 8.0 – 13.0% of the scrolls), and sheets of bronze composed of about 99.0% copper and 1.0% tin (approximately 1.5% of the scrolls). For those scrolls written on animal hides, scholars with the Israeli Antiquities Authority, {{by use of}} DNA testing for assembly purposes, believe {{that there may be}} a hierarchy in the religious importance of the texts based on which <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> was used to create the hide.

25|$|Information about {{fish species}} is scarce {{but at least}} four {{protected}} species have been detected. According to a CONANP study in 2007, there are 12 species of reptile here under protection, including the river crocodile (Crocodylus acutus), and one threatened species, the Yucatán banded gecko (Coleonyx elegans). Birds {{are the most common}} <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> in the park, with about 195 species documented. Six of these species are threatened and 17 are subject to special protection. One threatened bird species in the park is the great curassow (Crax rubra). Relatively abundant species include Actitus macularia, Dendrocygna autumnalis, Egretta caerulea, Egretta thula, Tachybaptus dominicus and Coragyps atratus, all of which are associated with bodies of water. There have been 53 species of mammals detected recently in the park, of which two are considered threatened, two in danger and two subject to special protection. Endangered and threatened species include the spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi), jaguarundi, ocelot, lowland paca, white-tailed deer, anteater (Tamandua tetradactyla) and buzzard (Sarcoramphus papa). The most abundant species include the bat Artibeus jamaicensis and the rat Peromyscus mexicanus.|$|E

500|$|Proposals {{that one}} <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal,</b> even humans, could descend from {{other types of}} animals, are known {{to go back to}} the first pre-Socratic Greek philosophers. Anaximander of Miletus (c. 610 – 546 BC) {{proposed}} that the first animals lived in water, during a wet phase of the Earth's past, and that the first land-dwelling ancestors of mankind must have been born in water, and only spent part of their life on land. He also argued that the first human of the form known today must have been the child of a different <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal,</b> because man needs prolonged nursing to live. Empedocles (c. 490 – 430 BC), argued that what we call birth and death in animals are just the mingling and separations of elements which cause the countless [...] "tribes of mortal things." [...] Specifically, the first animals and plants were like disjointed parts of the ones we see today, some of which survived by joining in different combinations, and then intermixing during the development of the embryo, and where [...] "everything turned out as it would have if it were on purpose, there the creatures survived, being accidentally compounded in a suitable way." [...] Other philosophers who became more influential in the Middle Ages, including Plato (c. 428/427 – 348/347 BC), Aristotle (384 – 322 BC), and members of the Stoic school of philosophy, believed that the types of all things, not only living things, were fixed by divine design.|$|E

2500|$|Zakat is payable {{on three}} kinds of assets: wealth, production, and animals. The more {{well-known}} zakat on wealth is 2.5% of accumulated wealth, beyond one's personal needs.

2500|$|Whilst it {{is clear}} that {{pollination}} syndromes can be observed in nature, there has been much debate amongst scientists as to how frequent they are and to what extent we can use the classical syndromes to classify plant-pollinator interactions. Although some species of plants are visited only by one <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> (i.e. they are functionally specialized), many plant species are visited by very different pollinators. For example, a flower may be pollinated by bees, butterflies, and birds. [...] Strict specialization of plants relying on one species of pollinator is relatively rare, probably because it can result in variable reproductive success across years as pollinator populations vary significantly. In such cases, plants should generalize {{on a wide range of}} pollinators, and such ecological generalization is frequently found in nature. [...] A study in Tasmania found the syndromes did not usefully predict the pollinators.|$|E

2500|$|Swammerdam's {{principal}} {{interest in}} this area was demonstrating that insects develop in the same gradual manner as other animals. He wanted to dispel the seventeenth-century notion of metamorphosis—the idea that different life stages of an insect (e.g. caterpillar and butterfly) represent different individuals or a sudden change from one <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> to another. He garnered evidence against this claim from his dissections. By examining larvae, he identified underdeveloped adult features in pre-adult animals. For example, {{he noticed that the}} wings of dragonflies and mayflies exist prior to their final molt. Swammerdam used these observations to bolster his case for epigenesis in his 1669 publication, Historia Insectorum Generalis (The Natural History of Insects). [...] This work also included many descriptions of insect anatomy. It was here that Swammerdam revealed that the [...] "king" [...] bee has ovaries. [...] Biblia natura published posthumously in 1737, carried the first confirmation that the queen bee is the sole mother of the colony. Despite five intense years of beekeeping, the mode of honey bee reproduction escaped him as he wrote, [...] "I do not believe the male bees actually copulate with the females." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} common {{elective}} surgical procedures in animals are those that render animals incapable of reproducing. [...] Neutering in animals describes spaying or castration (also please see castration). [...] To spay (medical term: ovariectomy or ovario-hysterectomy) is to completely remove the ovaries and often the uterus of a female animal. [...] In a dog, this is accomplished through a ventral midline incision into the abdomen. In a cat, this is accomplished either by a ventral midline abdominal incision, or by a flank incision (more common in the UK). With an ovariectomy ligatures are placed on the blood vessels above and below the ovary and the organ is removed. With an ovariohysterectomy, the ligaments of the uterus and ovaries are broken down and the blood vessels are ligated and both organs are removed. [...] The body wall, subcutis, and skin are sutured. [...] To castrate (medical term: orchiectomy) is to remove the testicles of a male animal. [...] Different techniques are used depending on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal,</b> including ligation of the spermatic cord with suture material, placing a rubber band around the cord to restrict blood flow to the testes, or crushing the cord with a specialized instrument like the Burdizzo.|$|E
2500|$|Sackville-West become {{involved}} in planning the coronation of Rezā Khan, and {{got to know the}} six-year old Crown Prince Mohammad Reza fairly well. She noted how the Persian court were obsessed with attempting to ensure the coronation was up to European standards and remarked [...] "there was no point, however humble, on which they would not consult their British friends", with their guidebook being a copy of [...] "the proceedings at Westminster Abbey for the Coronation of His Majesty George V". Much to her amusement, Sackville-West was asked by one Persian minister what a [...] "Rougedragon Poursuivant" [...] was, believing it was a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal.</b> On the coronation day, Sackville described waking up to a [...] "Tehran spruce and furnished beyond recognition". At the Golestan Palace, the throne room which housed the fabled Peacock Throne had been [...] "repainted, the garden paved, such breaches in the walls as revealed the presence of rubbish-heaps were to be filled up". Observing the coronation of Rezā Khan upon the Peacock Throne, Sackville-West referred to the Shia clergymen as a [...] "bevy of bearded old men in long robes and turbans" [...] who appeared like the [...] "baleful chorus of a Greek play". Sackville-West noted that everyone seemed to dislike the Shia clerics and kept a distance from them. Rezā Khan was due to enter the throne room of the Golestan Palace at precisely 3 pm for the coronation, but Sackville-West noted how everyone become tense when the shah was half an hour late, which caused alarm as Rezā Khan was well known for his punctuality and had his ministers flogged if they were late to cabinet meetings. Finally, the main doors opened and in marched Rezā Khan, dressed in his finest uniform and wearing a blue clock, and everyone fell silent. Despite her disdain for the Persian monarchy as [...] "absurd", Sackville-West found the coronation captivating as she found herself craning her neck to see Rezā Khan march up to the Peacock Throne. Walking besides him was his son, the Crown Prince Mohammad Reza, who she wrote was [...] "frightened, possessed himself of a corner of his father's clock". Finally, Sackville-West noted that Rezā Khan crowned himself. In her account of her visit to the former capital of Isfahan to see the Safavid palaces, Sackville-West's repeated use of the word [...] "we" [...] is misleading as it suggests that only Nicolson accompanied her to Isfahan, when in fact, Raymond Mortimer, her husband's lover also traveled in the same car with them.|$|E
