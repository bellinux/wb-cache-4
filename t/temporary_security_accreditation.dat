50|$|The {{information}} and supporting evidence needed for <b>security</b> <b>accreditation</b> is developed during a detailed security review of an information system, typically {{referred to as}} security certification. Security certification is a comprehensive assessment of the management, operational, and technical security controls in an information system, made in support of <b>security</b> <b>accreditation,</b> {{to determine the extent}} to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system. The results of a security certification are used to reassess the risks and update the system security plan, thus providing the factual basis for an authorizing official to render a <b>security</b> <b>accreditation</b> decision.|$|R

5000|$|Once {{the system}} {{documentation}} and risk assessment has been completed, the system's controls must be reviewed and certified to be functioning appropriately. Based {{on the results}} of the review, the information system is accredited. The certification and accreditation process is defined in NIST SP 800-37 [...] "Guide for the <b>Security</b> Certification and <b>Accreditation</b> of Federal Information Systems".Security accreditation is the official management decision given by a senior agency official to authorize operation of an information system and to explicitly accept the risk to agency operations, agency assets, or individuals based on the implementation of an agreed-upon set of security controls. Required by OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III, <b>security</b> <b>accreditation</b> provides a form of quality control and challenges managers and technical staffs at all levels to implement the most effective security controls possible in an information system, given mission requirements, technical constraints, operational constraints, and cost/schedule constraints. By accrediting an information system, an agency official accepts responsibility for the security of the system and is fully accountable for any adverse impacts to the agency if a breach of security occurs. Thus, responsibility and accountability are core principles that characterize <b>security</b> <b>accreditation.</b> It is essential that agency officials have the most complete, accurate, and trustworthy information possible on the security status of their information systems in order to make timely, credible, risk-based decisions on whether to authorize operation of those systems.|$|R

40|$|The {{difficulty}} of cross domain systems <b>security</b> <b>accreditation</b> lies {{inherent in the}} fact that, by definition, such systems always span at least one boundary between security domains controlled by different data owners. Consequently, approved solutions regularly encounter security testing criteria that represent the duplicated responsibility for residual risk of multiple security accreditors. Each data owner perceives a site-specific set of risks that would be desirable to mitigate, a technology-dependent set of risks {{that it is possible}} to mitigate, and a residual risk it is felt acceptable not to mitigate.
