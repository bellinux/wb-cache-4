25|$|An {{important}} building, the Palazzo Branconio dell'Aquila for Leo's Papal Chamberlain Giovanni Battista Branconio, {{was completely}} destroyed {{to make way}} for Bernini's piazza for St. Peter's, but drawings of the façade and courtyard remain. The façade was an unusually richly decorated one for the period, including both painted panels on <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>story</b> (of three), and much sculpture on the middle one.|$|E
25|$|The October 26, 1929, {{edition of}} the Rhinebeck Gazette {{describes}} bins found in <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>story</b> or garret of the house. These were traditionally used to store grain {{out of the reach}} of pilfering Indians. However, there are more practical reasons that local grain was stored in the garret of the house. It was more secure from rodents in the barn and would have been a dryer atmosphere, because even when heat was not required, a fire for cooking was always burning in the fireplace.|$|E

MSNBC.com reported one million page views on the story, making it <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>story</b> in the hours after Kim's body was found.

Newspapers in the region, led by The Oregonian and the San Francisco Chronicle, devoted heavy coverage to the events and their aftermath.|$|E
25|$|The minaret is {{situated}} at the southern corner of the facade looking into Bab al-Wazir Street, affording a dominant view of the entire {{southern part of the}} street. It consists of three stories, the first being circular and plain and the second circular and ribbed while <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>story</b> is a bulb resting on a pavilion supported by eight slender stone columns. Its circular shaft is rare among Mamluk minarets. Prior to its 20th-century restoration, the minaret had four stories. The third story was octagonal and removed during the restoration, depriving the Aqsunqur Mosque a unique feature it shared with another mosque in Cairo, the Sultan al-Ghuri Complex which has four stories. The Aqsunqur Mosque minaret was featured in several 19th-century illustrations.|$|E
25|$|The {{expansion}} of the forecastle in the early 15th century marked the third phase of Trakai's development. The walls of the forecastle were strengthened to a thickness of 2.5 metres and raised with additional firing galleries. Three major defensive towers were constructed on the corners. The southwestern tower was also used as a prison. <b>The</b> <b>top</b> <b>story</b> of the towers was designed for soldiers and housed {{a large number of}} cannons. A main gatehouse was also constructed which, along with the Ducal Palace donjon, had movable gates. The gatehouse was reinforced with additional sections for firing galleries. Near the inner walls several buildings were constructed, including stables, kitchens, and other support structures. When the castle was undergoing this expansion in the 15th century, the water level of Lake Galvė was several metres higher than it is today. The castle builders took advantage of this by separating the Ducal Palace and the forecastle with a moat, just wide enough for small boats to sail through. They were connected by gates that could be raised in case of an enemy attack.|$|E

500|$|As {{originally}} planned, {{the tower}} would have 60 stories consisting of 13 office floors, 40 condominium floors, and 2 floors for mechanical uses, {{but this was}} later amended. However, in the final plan, the 58-story building contained six floors for the atrium, then thirteen office floors {{on top of the}} atrium, and finally 39 condominium floors above the offices. Originally, it was estimated that it would take $100 million to construct the tower. When the tower eventually opened, it had 58 stories, with <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>story</b> marked as [...] "68" [...] because, according to Trump, the five-story-tall public atrium occupies the height of 10 ordinary stories. However, several Bloomberg L.P. writers determined that Trump's calculations did not account {{for the fact that the}} ceiling heights in Trump Tower were much taller than in comparable buildings. As a result of this miscalculation, the tower does not have any floors numbered 6–13.|$|E

500|$|The episode's airing—in particular, its shock regeneration—contributed to {{a public}} surge of interest, {{described}} by Daily Mail journalist Paul Revoir as [...] "Doctor Who fever". The regeneration prompted {{a large amount of}} speculation to Tennant's replacement: actor Robert Carlyle was the bookmaker's favourite to replace Tennant; and actors James McAvoy, Jason Statham, Alan Davies, and James Nesbitt were less popular predictions. In his article about the public reaction to the cliffhanger, Revoir offered five popular theories: a botched regeneration that resulted in two Doctors; a revelation that the whole series was dream sequence like the ninth season of Dallas; Tennant's successor being female; a normal regeneration; and a cover-up by the BBC to disguise the fact that [...] "Journey's End" [...] would be Tennant's last appearance; the first theory proved to be correct. The increase of public interest peaked in the two days prior to the transmission of [...] "Journey's End": the day before transmission saw the Seventh Doctor's actor Sylvester McCoy, Collinson, Davies, and Agyeman appear on separate daytime television shows; and coverage of the series finale was <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>story</b> in BBC News Online's entertainment section several hours before transmission. Davies attributed the amount of interest the episode created—which was greater than he expected—and the success of the new series to the measures made in keeping plot details secret and creating a [...] "live experience": ...|$|E
2500|$|The Swaggerty Blockhouse {{consists}} of three stories, with the first story being the smallest and <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>story</b> being the largest. [...] The first story {{consists of}} a stone-and-mortar springhouse built around a natural spring which empties into Clear Creek a few yards away. [...] A wellhouse adjacent to the first story {{was built in the}} middle 20th-century. [...] The second level consists of hewn oak timbers notched with half-dovetail joints. [...] While the hewing of the second story logs is relatively crude, its notching is very precise, giving it the strength to support the larger third story. [...] Pegs and shelving on the second story indicate that it was once used for storage.|$|E
2500|$|The Romans adapted all the Greek {{orders and}} also {{developed}} two orders of their own, basically modifications of Greek orders. However, {{it was not}} until the Renaissance that these were named and formalized as the Tuscan and Composite, respectively the plainest and most ornate of the orders. [...] The Romans also invented the superposed order. A superposed order is when successive stories of a building have different orders. The heaviest orders were at the bottom, whilst the lightest came at the top. This means that the Doric order was the order of the ground floor, the Ionic order was used for the middle story, while the Corinthian or the Composite order was used for <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>story.</b>|$|E
