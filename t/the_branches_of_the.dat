5|$|The Capetians ruled {{continuously}} from 987 to 1792 {{and again}} from 1814 to 1848. <b>The</b> <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dynasty which ruled after 1328, however, are generally given the specific branch names of Valois (until 1589) and Bourbon (until 1848).|$|E
5|$|According to {{the initial}} description, the eye socket of Euchambersia is rather small. <b>The</b> <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> postorbital and jugal that usually {{surround}} the back {{and bottom of the}} eye socket in therocephalians appear to be either very reduced or absent entirely. Meanwhile, the top of the eye socket is formed by the prefrontal, and the frontal is also small. The skull does not bear a pineal foramen. Like Whaitsia, the pterygoid and palatine of the palate are not separated from the transpalatine, further {{to the side of the}} jaw, by any sort of opening.|$|E
5|$|In 1817, Sharp {{was again}} {{elected to the}} Kentucky House of Representatives. During his term, he {{supported}} measures for internal improvements, but opposed {{the creation of a}} state health board and a proposal to open the state's vacant lands to the widows and orphans of soldiers killed in the War of 1812. Most notably, he supported the creation of 46 new banks in the state, and proposed a tax on <b>the</b> <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bank of the United States in Lexington and Louisville.|$|E
50|$|The Smith {{family is}} an English aristocratic and banking family founded by Thomas Smith (1631-1699), <b>the</b> founder <b>of</b> Smith's Bank of Nottingham. Its members include <b>the</b> Marquess <b>of</b> Lincolnshire (extinct), <b>the</b> Viscount Wendover (extinct), the Barons Carrington, the Baron Pauncefote (extinct), the Barons Bicester, the Bromley baronets and many Members of Parliament. Originally named Smith, <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Barons Carrington assumed <b>the</b> surname Carington, <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bromley baronets the surname Bromley and <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Baron Pauncefote the surname Pauncefote.|$|R
50|$|Bartosz Paprocki {{gives an}} example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rościszewski family taking {{different}} surnames from <b>the</b> names <b>of</b> various patrimonies or estates they owned. <b>The</b> <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rościszewski family that settled in Chrapunia became <b>the</b> Chrapunski family, <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rościszewski family that settled in Strykwina became the Strykwinski family, and <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rościszewski family that settled in Borkow {{became known as}} the Borkowski family. Each family shared a common ancestor and belonged to the same knights' clan, so they bore <b>the</b> same coat <b>of</b> arms as <b>the</b> Rościszewski family.|$|R

5|$|It is {{currently}} the largest banyan tree in Hawaii, {{and one of the}} largest banyan trees in the United States. The tree faces several threats, including soil compaction from foot and vehicle traffic due to tourism and special events in the park, drought, and the interruption of irrigation due to courthouse renovation. New restrictions were imposed in 2000 after the health of the tree began to decline. common myna birds (Acridotheres tristis) roost in <b>the</b> <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree at sunset, causing a cacophony of bird cries as the evening approaches.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>{{branches}}</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{silver birch}} often have tangled masses of twigs known as witch's brooms growing among them, {{caused by the}} fungus Taphrina betulina. Old trees are often killed by the decay fungus Piptoporus betulinus and fallen branches rot rapidly on the forest floor. This tree commonly grows with the mycorrhizal fungus Amanita muscaria in a mutualistic relationship. This applies particularly to acidic or nutrient-poor soils. Other mycorrhizal associates include Leccinum scabrum and Cantharellus cibarius. It has been shown that, as well as mycorrhiza, the presence of microfauna in the soil assists {{the growth of the}} tree, as it enhances the mobilization of nutrients.|$|E
5|$|After {{sweeping}} through France and Belgium in {{the summer}} of 1944, after the Battle of Normandy, the Allies were poised to enter the Netherlands. Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery, commanding the Anglo-Canadian 21st Army Group, favoured a single thrust north over <b>the</b> <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lower Rhine River, allowing the British Second Army to bypass the Siegfried Line and attack the Ruhr. To this end, the Allies launched Operation Market Garden on 17 September 1944. Allied Airborne troops were dropped in the Netherlands to secure key bridges and towns along the Allied axis of advance. Farthest north, the British 1st Airborne Division, supported by men of the Glider Pilot Regiment and the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade, landed at Arnhem to secure bridges across the Nederrijn. Initially expecting a walkover, British XXX Corps planned to reach the British airborne forces in two to three days.|$|E

5|$|Cheney's most {{immediate}} issue as Secretary of Defense was the Department of Defense budget. Cheney deemed it appropriate {{to cut the}} budget and downsize the military, following the Reagan Administration's peacetime defense buildup {{at the height of}} the Cold War. As part of the fiscal year 1990 budget, Cheney assessed the requests from each of <b>the</b> <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> armed services for such expensive programs as the Avenger II Naval attack aircraft, the B-2 stealth bomber, the V-22 Osprey tilt-wing helicopter, the Aegis destroyer and the MX missile, totaling approximately $4.5 billion in light of changed world politics. Cheney opposed the V-22 program, which Congress had already appropriated funds for, and initially refused to issue contracts for it before relenting.|$|E
5|$|Each of <b>the</b> <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ADF has {{a reserve}} component. These forces are the Royal Australian Naval Reserve, Australian Army Reserve and Royal Australian Air Force Reserve. The main {{role of the}} {{reserves}} is to supplement the permanent elements of the ADF during deployments and crises, including natural disasters. This can include attaching individual reservists to regular units or deploying units composed entirely of reserve personnel. As reservists serve on a part-time basis, they are less costly to the government than {{permanent members of the}} ADF, but the nature of their service can mean that reservists have a lower level of readiness than regular personnel and require further training before they can be deployed. It has historically proven difficult to set a level of training requirements which allows reservists to be rapidly deployable yet does not act as a disincentive to recruitment and continued participation.|$|E
5|$|From stanzas 22 to 24, {{more details}} are given by Odin about Valhalla: the holy {{doors of the}} ancient gate Valgrind stand before Valhalla, Valhalla has five hundred and forty doors that eight hundred men can exit from at once (from which the einherjar will flow forth to engage the wolf Fenrir at Ragnarök). Within Valhalla exists Thor's hall Bilskirnir, and within it exist five hundred and forty rooms, {{and of all the}} halls within Valhalla, Odin states that he thinks his son's may be greatest. In stanzas 25 through 26, Odin states that the goat Heiðrún and the hart Eikþyrnir stand on top of Valhalla and graze on <b>the</b> <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree Læraðr. Heiðrún {{produces}} vats of mead that liquor cannot be compared to, and from Eikþyrnir's antlers drip liquid into the spring Hvergelmir from which flows forth all waters.|$|E
50|$|In the 19th century, {{the family}} {{expanded}} further its nobility status, when Giulio Cesare (1781-1859), fourth Prince Rospigliosi, married Margherita Colonna Gioeni, acquiring through that all her titles of nobility.

5|$|Malawi is a democratic, multi-party government, {{currently}} {{under the leadership}} of Arthur Peter Mutharika, who defeated former president Joyce Banda in the 2014 elections, despite alleged poll rigging. The current constitution was put into place on 18 May 1995. <b>The</b> <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government consist of executive, legislative and judicial. The executive includes a president who is both chief of state and head of government, first and second vice presidents and a cabinet. The president is elected every five years, and the vice president is chosen by the president. A second vice president may be appointed by the president if so chosen, although they must be from a different party. The members of the cabinet are appointed by the president and can be from either inside or outside of the legislature.|$|E
5|$|This road {{would serve}} as the initial mail road linking Kingston to Toronto, but was poorly {{maintained}} and soon allowed to fall into disrepair. By 1817, the Kingston Road replaced or bypass much of Danforth's Road, following a similar path to the Trent River (with minor improvements in routing around Scarborough, Port Hope, Cobourg and Grafton) but then blazing a more northerly route through Belleville and Napanee. Like the Danforth Road before it, this 1817 York Road was initially a muddy dirt road; it would, however, suffice to establish reliable scheduled stagecoach runs by which mail and passengers could make the two-day trip from Kingston to Toronto and permit enterprises (such as <b>the</b> <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> newly established Bank of Montreal) safe and timely delivery of documents and valuables. By 1839, the Napanee-Kingston route was being improved {{for use as a}} gravel toll road.|$|E

50|$|In Chinese culture, auspicious wedding {{dates are}} {{typically}} found by numerological analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{date in the}} Chinese calendar. Some modern sources also apply numerological analysis to the date as given by the Gregorian calendar. Another way to determine an auspicious wedding date in Chinese culture is {{to start with the}} espoused’s Zodiac animal sign, distinguished by their respective years of birth. To start, the couple must not get married in a year <b>of</b> <b>the</b> animal with which theirs conflict. The couple may not be <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same Zodiac animal but will likely be similar enough to distinguish the years in which they can marry. Some couples eliminate months that will clash with their Zodiac animals. The next step is to set a time period in which the couple might like to marry in and eliminate all inauspicious days within this period. These days include Year Breaker days (<b>the</b> <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year clashes with <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day), Month Breaker days (<b>the</b> <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> month clashes with <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day), and Personal Clash Day (<b>the</b> <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> couples’ years <b>of</b> birth clash with <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day). There are other inauspicious days, such as the “Four Extinct and Four Departure Days”, the Impoverish or No Wealth days; the couple is allowed to decide for themselves if they are to eliminate these days, as well. From that point, the couple may eliminate further dates with the 12 Day Officers method. Advanced couples even eliminate dates by the stars (or energy) that influence the day.|$|R
