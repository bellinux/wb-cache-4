25|$|The Back <b>to</b> <b>Basics</b> Tour was {{the fourth}} concert tour by American singer Christina Aguilera. The tour was {{launched}} to support her fifth studio album, Back <b>to</b> <b>Basics</b> (2006). It visited Europe, North America, Asia, and Australia from late 2006 to mid 2008.

25|$|After the Vancouver Olympics, Asada {{decided to}} relearn {{all of her}} jumps from scratch by getting back <b>to</b> <b>basics.</b> This contributed to her slump in the 2010–11 and 2011–12 seasons. Under the {{guidance}} of her new coach Nobuo Sato, she stripped her triple jumps to their rudimentary parts and relearned each takeoff and landing, beginning with a single rotation. While reworking her jumps, Asada did not skip any competitions in the 2010–11 season.|$|E
25|$|In 1966, as many rock artists moved towards {{expansive}} {{and experimental}} psychedelia, Bob Dylan spearheaded the back-to-basics roots revival {{when he went}} to Nashville to record the album Blonde on Blonde, using notable local musicians like Charlie McCoy. This, and the subsequent more clearly country-influenced albums, John Wesley Harding (1967) and Nashville Skyline (1969), have been seen as creating the genre of country folk, a route pursued by a number of, largely acoustic, folk musicians. Other acts that followed the back <b>to</b> <b>basics</b> trend in different ways were the Canadian/American group The Band and the California-based Creedence Clearwater Revival, both of which mixed basic rock and roll with folk, country and blues, to be among the most successful and influential bands of the late 1960s. The same movement saw the beginning of the recording careers of Californian solo artists like Ry Cooder, Bonnie Raitt and Lowell George. The back <b>to</b> <b>basics</b> tendency would also be evident in the Rolling Stones' Beggars Banquet (1968) and Exile on Main Street (1972), the Beatles' The White Album (1968) and Let It Be (1970)., The Doors' Morrison Hotel (1970) and L.A. Woman (1971), as well as the Grateful Dead's Workingman's Dead and American Beauty.|$|E
