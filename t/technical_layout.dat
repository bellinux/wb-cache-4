5000|$|Brown Shoe Company's Homes-Take Factory, {{also known}} as the International Hat Company Warehouse, is a {{historic}} building location at 1201 Russell Boulevard in the Soulard neighborhood of St. Louis, Missouri. [...] Built in 1904, by renowned architect Albert B. Groves, the building was originally a factory for the Brown Shoe Company, based in St. Louis. [...] In 1954, the factory was subsequently converted into a warehouse by the International Hat Company. The site has been recognized as a testament to Grove's architectural expertise in the principles of factory design, namely <b>technical</b> advances in <b>layout</b> planning, operational efficiency, and employee safety. [...] Additionally, the factory epitomizes the early 20th century cultural transformation and socio-industrial development of St. Louis into a manufacturing powerhouse. In particular, the Brown Shoe Company is recognized as a principal player in challenging the 19th century dominance of the New England shoe industry. This significantly contributed to the early 20th century sobriquet of St. Louis as the city of [...] "shoes, booze, and blues."

40|$|If we {{designed}} a building intended for people, {{we would be}} able to base it on many predetermined regulations and standards. The only remaining work would be a detailed literature study and creation itself. Constructing buildings for regular farm animal breeding would, in a simplified way, follow the same pattern. However, the ecosystem pavilion is a very particular space. It's a combination of animals, plants, people and various <b>technical,</b> operational, <b>layout</b> and stage design solutions. Designing a tropical pavilion is a very complicated creation, requiring a coordination of various fields which need to find a way to cooperate. Therefore, the architect needs to work closely with zoologists, botanists, breeders and others, try to gain an insight into the animal farming issues and acquire the knowledge of trends in breeding and exposition practice. The aim of the diploma thesis is to summarize the findings drawn from reference literature and to develop a comprehensive research which consists of historical development of menageries, continues to contemporary modern zoological garden and finally to ecosystem pavilion phenomenon. After this complex issue, we review the foundation data on the definition and characteristics of the territory supporting the pavilion study and we reflect on the principles of designing the ecosystem pavilion. The project itself is a study of pavilion interior which represents a sector of Amazon ecosystem. We can simply say that it comprises living botanical and zoological collections of this habitat, which are supplemented by imitations of natural elements. It results in an almost perfect impression of the environment. In accordance with these basic principles, a philosophy of zoo exhibition concept is developed. A man and farmed species are put on a same level. The probability of a visitor to see the animal in the exhibition is the same as the chances of the animal to hide from unwelcome guests. This fact increases the ressemblance of the pavilion ecosystem visit to a real expedition into the countryside...|$|R

As a consequence almost no rms emittance increase is obtained in all three planes and the production of halo particles is reduced. A cylindrical bunch stays cylindrical.

Strong transverse-longitudinal coupling is observed. The simulation results are used also to study the effect of halo scraping...|$|E

At first the thesis {{deals with the}} storage task in theory, storage terms {{and in the end}} it brings results of the {{surveyed}} storage technology for supply of production at a specific selected industrial company and a change proposal. Division of the own storage process is proposed in the theoretical part. As a basic identification when describing the warehouse I have chosen the storage hardware and storage processes. By hardware element are meant especially fixtures necessary for storage, which are mainly the stored goods themselves, <b>layout,</b> <b>technical</b> equipment, computer software but also personnel. The software element can be generally described as a complex system of storage and consignment activities. The storage hardware term I have further divided into storage and stored. In the practical part these divisions are further analysed and specified using an example of a selected manufacturing corporation with emphasis on the storage system change proposal as well as a proposal for a new hardware arrangement, whereas the proposal is verified in the area of monitoring an implementation of similar changes in practice. Advantages and disadvantages of some elements and the proposed changes are discussed as well as further possible topics for an optimisation of the proposed central warehouse. In conclusion it is noted that a uniformity of storage outputs and balance of personnel productivity using standardisation of processes is a very important effect of the controlled storage system...|$|R

40|$|At the Forschungszentrum Juelich a coil {{system for}} {{magnetic}} ergodisation of the plasma edge {{is to be}} built in TEXTOR- 94 : the dynamic ergodic divertor (DED). The helical coils will be installed at the high field side inside the vacuum vessel. They are aligned in parallel to the magnetic field lines in the plasma at the q= 3 surface. The system will be fed by multiphase current to distribute the expected heat load on the divertor target plates over a wider area and e. g. to influence plasma rotation at higher frequencies. The aims of this thesis are to analyse different possible concepts for such a coil arrangement and to lay out selected DED components and thereby to contribute essentially to the final <b>technical</b> solution. The <b>layout</b> development is accompanied by field calculations of the different possible system designs. The path of the coils is calculated by means of the field line helix. A four phase current system with sixteen coils proves to be the most favourable; by connecting pairs of coils carrying opposite currents in series less power supplies (IGBT based) are needed. A coil design of complete turns has the advantage of a higher flexibility regarding the operation mode selection and needs less space than a module system. The coil outlets will be bundled {{to reduce the number of}} required flanges; additional coils above and below the ergodisation coils compensate the resulting asymmetry in the poloidal current distribution. The TEXTOR- 94 liner has to be modified in order that the perturbation coils can be installed. The coil cables are designed for amperages up to 15 kA and frequencies up to 10 kHz and consist of bundles of polyimide insulated copper wires in a corrugated stainless steel tube.
