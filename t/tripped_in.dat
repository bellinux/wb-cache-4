5|$|A {{different}} {{version of}} this tale narrates that when the youngest daughter-in-law was pregnant, she secretly ate the food-offerings ritually dedicated to Shashthi and then blamed the theft on the black cat. Angered by the dishonour of its mistress and the unjust accusation of theft, the cat pledged to teach the young mother a lesson. In {{this version of the}} tale, the cat not only stole her six children, but also ate them. But when the seventh child was born, the mother caught the cat fleeing with her child and followed it but <b>tripped</b> <b>in</b> middle of the chase and fainted. The cat took the infant to Shashthi's abode, where she told the goddess the whole tale of her insult. The benign goddess, however, was annoyed with the cat and rushed to the aid of the mother. The goddess explained the reason of her suffering, and after the mother had begged the cat for forgiveness and had sworn to worship Shashthi on anointed days, all seven of her children were returned to her.|$|E
5|$|On 9 May, Drogba helped Chelsea {{to win the}} Premier League {{by scoring}} a hat-trick in an 8–0 win over Wigan Athletic. In doing so, he not only {{collected}} his third League winner's medal but also won the Golden Boot for the season, his second time doing so, by topping the chart with 29 league goals, beating Wayne Rooney to the title who remained on 26 goals. Both players had {{the same number of}} goals (26) before the start of their respective matches. However, during the game, Drogba appeared to be clearly angry with teammate and regular penalty taker Frank Lampard, after Lampard refused to let Drogba take a penalty which would lead Chelsea to go 2–0 up and give him a chance of winning the golden boot. Lampard scored the penalty, but Drogba did not celebrate with his teammates. Later on in the game though Ashley Cole was <b>tripped</b> <b>in</b> the box when Chelsea were already 5–0 up, and this time Lampard allowed Drogba to take the penalty, which he scored to go two goals clear of Rooney.|$|E

25|$|Archie Williams, {{who won the}} 400 meters at {{both the}} Trials and the Olympics, was a {{relative}} newcomer; {{he had made his}} breakthrough earlier in 1936, running a new world record (46.1) at the NCAA championships. Smallwood and LuValle, who had both defeated Williams at the AAU championships a week before the Trials, took the other Olympic spots. In the 800 meters, the fastest times were seen in the heats; John Woodruff won the first heat in 1:49.9, missing the metric world record by only one-tenth of a second. The final was slower, with Woodruff winning in 1:51.0; returning Olympian Hornbostel was second, and Williamson narrowly overtook Abraham Rosenkrantz for third. Leading favorites Charles Beetham and Ben Eastman were both eliminated; Eastman, the world record holder and pre-Trials world leader, was ill before the race and placed sixth. Beetham, who had defeated Woodruff at the AAU championships, fell and lost his chances when Marmaduke Hobbs <b>tripped</b> <b>in</b> front of him; his appeal for a solo time-trial re-run was rejected by meeting officials.|$|E
25|$|The {{fate of the}} semi finalists {{rested on}} the return leg {{encounter}} in Goa. The match started off with nerves on both sides forcing rookie mistakes in both camps. It was however the visitors Aizawl, who drew first blood, all thanks to their wonderman Joel Sunday who put them ahead in the 37th minute. The 1–0 lead meant Aizawl had an away goal advantage and Sporting Goa would have to score two to progress into the final. The Goans however got their rescue act in place, seconds away from the lemon break whistle. A Sumit Passi header found {{the back of the}} net to draw Sporting Clube de Goa to level terms. The visitors however made the Goan recovery more difficult after the referee awarded a penalty to the highlanders as their captain David Lalrinmuana was <b>tripped</b> <b>in</b> the box by a Sporting Goa defender. Lalchawnkima made no mistake in finding the net from the penalty spot to give Aizawl a 2–1 lead. In the 80th minute however, a butter finger moment from Aizawl goalkeeper Soram Poirei saw him push an easy shot right onto Glan Martins' boots. The forward made no mistake in scoring from close range to draw the Goans 2–2. Sporting Goa however needed another goal to advance to the final. They had their best chance in injury time, but Sumit Passi failed to tap in an easy ball into an open net. The ending however was not very happy for the visitors. Aizawl captain David Lalrinmuana was given the marching orders by the referee when he tried to delay a free-kick from being taken. This made the vital midfielder unavailable for the all important final encounter. The match finished 2–2 on the night and the same on aggregate seeing Aizawl go through to the final having two more away goals than their opponents.|$|E

The invitation was partly thanks to the show's musical director of the time, G.E. Smith, who was a Replacements fan but, {{as a result of their}} shambolic and profanity-laced performance during the late-night live broadcast, SNL producer Lorne Michaels banned them from ever returning to the show.

In a 2015 interview recorded for the Archive of American Television, G.E.

2500|$|The rising {{shares of}} {{variable}} renewable generation {{had led to}} concerns {{about the ability of}} the electricity system to cope.

[...] Free-standing photovoltaic systems on nature conservation areas were excluded from remuneration. [...] The tariff structure for onshore wind was basically maintained, but the degression was tightened from 1% to 1.5% to incentivize efficiency improvements. [...] The system services bonus for onshore wind was extended and the repowering bonus was improved. [...] Offshore wind gained through improved early starter provisions. [...] The start of the degression was postponed until 2018, but increased from 5% to 7%. [...] Starter tariffs were increased but now last 8 rather than 12years. [...] Biomass tariffs were lowered by 10–15% on average, particularly for small systems. [...] The biomass tariff system itself was greatly simplified, with now four size categories and two fuel categories. [...] The degression for biomass was increased from 1% to 2%. [...] The tariffs for hydroelectricity were simplified, the funding period now uniformly 20years, and the degression rate set at 1%. [...] The tariffs for geothermal energy were raised and the start of the degression postponed until 2018, albeit at an increased rate. [...] Electricity storage facilities were fully exempted from grid charges and are to be supported by a special research program.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} the Australian innings the {{temperature}} dropped and a breeze came up which helped the Australian bowlers Alan Davidson and Ray Lindwall with their swing. Peter Richardson and Trevor Bailey were soon out and at 11/2 Peter May (37), promoted to number 3 to protect the other batsmen, and Colin Cowdrey (84) were back at the crease. They attacked the bowling with finely tuned strokes and with Graveney (41) took England to 170/3, May was bowled by Richie Benaud (5/91) when he tried to hit him for six. On the fourth day England collapsed to 188/9, Gordon Rorke (3/23) starting the rot by bowling Cowdrey, who edged the ball onto his stumps, and having Graveney caught by Benaud despite the ball coming off the bat at high speed. Tom Graveney recalled [...] "I had a personal experience of Richie's tactical genius...he held up play while he moved the short leg round a couple of yards. It interrupted my flow because I was forced to wonder why he had done it and whether I should be expecting a new direction from the bowler. This was exactly the reaction that Richie had wanted. There was no reason for the move other than to apply psychological pressure. He was a master at upsetting the concentration of batsman and reach their subconscious" [...] Benaud then dismissed Trueman, Lock, Tyson and Evans, two caught by Wally Grout, one by Burke and the other by the bowler himself. England were 89 runs short of saving the follow on, but Willie Watson and Brian Statham stayed at the crease for 70 minutes. Statham, who batted left-handed, hit 6 fours in a new highest Test score of 36 not out. Lindwall was given the new ball, but could only shave the stumps as Statham hit out. Davidson <b>tripped</b> <b>in</b> one of Trueman's foot marks and had to retire from the field. In the end Rorke bowled Watson to end the 52 run last wicket stand 37 runs short of their target. Rorke on debut returned figures of 18.1–7–23–3, his low economy due to his large number of almost wides and high pace and in one three over spell only one ball could have been played.|$|E
