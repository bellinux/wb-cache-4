The data used in this study consisted of a sample of 133 companies listed in Tehran Stock Exchange from 2008 to 2012. To analyze the data and to perform hypothesis tests, a linear regression model, based on combinatorial methods or data panel, and also a nonparametric Spearman correlation analysis have been applied. The results of the research hypothesis tests based on regression analysis revealed an insignificant relationship between capital structure and economic value added. Furthermore, the results showed that, there was an inverse moderate relationship between rate of <b>total</b> debt to <b>total</b> asset and <b>total</b> current debt to <b>total</b> asset with economic value added.

5|$|Cyclone Bola {{created some}} of the {{heaviest}} rainfall <b>totals</b> for a single storm {{in the history of}} New Zealand, with some locations receiving more than half of their annual rainfall <b>totals</b> from the storm. While the cyclone passed north of the island, a strong easterly flow over the North Island contained the interaction between moist air from Bola and drier air from the ridge to its southeast. In the Gisborne region, the flow resulted in the heaviest rainfall <b>totals,</b> when the moisture ascended over the region's western mountainous areas and condensed into precipitation. One station recorded 419mm (16.5in) in a 24‑hour period. The maximum rainfall total attributed to the storm was 917mm (36.1in), reported at a station near Tolaga Bay. Heavy rainfall <b>totals</b> of up to and over 300mm (12in) were observed in the regions of Auckland and Northland. The cyclone is the largest to be recorded in 93years of rainfall records. As such, it had a large and lasting effect on the rivers of the area when it deposited a large amount of sediment, as recorded in the sedimentary record of Lake Tūtira. Shortly prior to losing its identity, the remnants of Bola also dropped 100–200mm (4–8in) of precipitation on the South Island of New Zealand.|$|E
