5000|$|The key {{independent}} variable {{in this experiment}} {{is the nature of}} the subset selected. In some cases, the subset comprises a feature search set — i.e. the target differs from the two distractors in one dimension only. In other cases, the subset is equivalent to a conjunction search, with the target differing from the distractors in both dimensions. Because the <b>total</b> <b>display</b> contains items that differ from the target in both dimensions, if subjects are quicker to respond to the feature search subsets, this would suggest they had taken advantage of the [...] "pop out" [...] method of target identification. This in turn would mean that they had applied their visual search to the subsetted items only.|$|E

Such services allow users to share the virtual reality (VR) world without any geographical restrictions.

The layout algorithm for positioning child-subtrees rooted at a given parent is incrementally recomputed with each edit operation; it attempts to conserve the <b>total</b> <b>display</b> area allocated to child-subtrees while preserving the user’s mental map. The runtime and space efficiency is good {{as a result of}} exploiting a specially designed Shape abstraction for encoding and manipulating the geometric boundaries of subtrees as monotonic step functions to determine their best placement. All tree operations, including loading, saving trees to files, and incremental cut and paste, are worst case O(N) in time, but typically cut and paste are O(log(N) 2), where N is the number of nodes. ...|$|E

40|$|We tested whether alpine plants {{increase}} {{their effort to}} attract pollinators to compensate for assumed pollinator scarcity at high altitude. A three times larger fraction of the shoot was allocated to flowers in alpine plants (30 species, 2700 m asl) compared to lowland plants (20 species, 600 m asl), while leaf mass fraction did not differ between the altitudes. At high elevation, a three times smaller fraction of the shoot was allocated to stems, which {{was accompanied by a}} change in its function from leaf support for photosynthesis at low altitude to support for flowers at high altitude. Although shoot mass is massively reduced at high altitudes, display area and biomass of individual flowers were remarkably similar at both altitudes. All flowers together attracted pollinators with about the same <b>total</b> <b>display</b> area relative to overall plants size, but generally alpine plants maintain their flowers longer. Together with decreased plant height this leads to an increased self-shading which is likely to cause reductions in carbon gain in alpine plants.

40|$|Our visual {{brain is}} {{remarkable}} in extracting invariant properties from the noisy environment, guiding selection {{of where to}} look and what to identify. However, how the brain achieves this is still poorly understood. Here we explore interactions of local context and global structure in the long-term learning and retrieval of invariant display properties. Participants searched for a target among distractors, without knowing that some “old” configurations were presented repeatedly (randomly inserted among “new” configurations). We simulated tunnel vision, limiting the visible region around fixation. Robust facilitation of performance for old versus new contexts was observed when the visible region was large but not when it was small. However, once the display was made fully visible during the subsequent transfer phase, facilitation did become manifest. Furthermore, when participants were given a brief preview of the <b>total</b> <b>display</b> layout prior to tunnel view search with 2 items visible, facilitation was already obtained during the learning phase. The eye movement results revealed contextual facilitation to be coupled with changes of saccadic planning, characterized by slightly extended gaze durations but a reduced number of fixations and shortened scan paths for old displays. Taken together, our findings show that invariant spatial display properties can be acquired based on scarce, para-/foveal information, while their effective retrieval for search guidance requires the availability (even if brief) of a certain extent of peripheral information...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relationships}} between the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index and precipitation and river flow over northeast Turkey. Precipitation totals and maximum, mean and minimum river flow are analysed at the seasonal scale for 12 and 10 stations, respectively. Pearson’s and Mann-Kendall correlation tests are applied to assess relationships between the NAO index and precipitation and river flow metrics, and to detect trends in time-series. Autumn precipitation <b>totals</b> <b>display</b> significant increasing trends, especially for coastal stations, while inland stations show significant increasing trends for spring precipitation. Minimum and maximum river flow decreases significantly for spring and summer. This tendency implies varying conditions towards a drier regime. Seasonal precipitation patterns show a negative association with the NAO for December–January–February (DJF), March–April–May (MAM) and September–October–November (SON) for some stations. Positive associations between the NAO and winter-extended winter (December–March) river flows are detected for some stations in northeast Turkey...|$|R
