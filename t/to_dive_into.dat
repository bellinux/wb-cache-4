5|$|Ramón Jiménez, Fernández's stepfather, {{defected}} from Cuba in 2005, {{settling in}} Tampa, Florida. Fernández attempted to defect unsuccessfully three times, with each failed defection attempt {{followed by a}} prison term. Fernández, along {{with his mother and}} sister, defected in 2007. On that successful attempt, José's mother fell overboard when the boat hit turbulent waters, and José had <b>to</b> <b>dive</b> <b>into</b> the water to save her life. They reached Mexico, and then moved to Tampa in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The fleet {{returned}} to waters off Okinawa on 4 May and renewed its {{attacks on the}} airfields on the Sakishima Islands. Vice-Admiral Bernard Rawlings, second {{in command of the}} BPF, and his staff had determined that bombardment of Japanese gun positions by the heavy guns of battleships and cruisers might be a more effective method of destroying them than aerial attack. They detached King George V and Howe, as well as five cruisers, that morning to bombard Nobara and Hiara airfields while fighters flew a protective CAP over them and spotted the fall of their shells. The loss of the most effective anti-aircraft ships was more important than anticipated and the Japanese were {{able to take advantage of}} the opportunity. The carrier had just launched two Corsairs for bombardment-spotting duties and the deck park of eleven Avengers was being moved forward to allow aircraft to land when an undetected Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter attacked at 11:31. The Zero first strafed the flight deck before any of Formidables guns could open fire and then turned sharply <b>to</b> <b>dive</b> <b>into</b> the forward flight deck despite the ship's hard turn to starboard. The fighter released a bomb shortly before it would have impacted the deck and was destroyed by the bomb's blast, although the remnants of the Zero struck Formidable.|$|E
5|$|The P-40s {{were better}} armored and faster {{in level flight}} than the Japanese fighters they were up against, mostly Mitsubishi A6M Zeroes, and could outdive them. On the other hand, the Japanese fighters had greater range, could outclimb the P-40, and were far more maneuverable. For an American P-40 pilot, risking a dogfight with a Japanese fighter was {{practically}} suicidal. Wurtsmith attempted to develop tactics that would exploit {{the strengths of the}} P-40 and minimize its weaknesses. The two-plane element was fixed as the chief unit of combat, and individual dogfighting was strictly prohibited. The P-40s would attempt <b>to</b> <b>dive</b> <b>into</b> a Japanese formation, attack, and then continue diving at a speed the Japanese fighters could not match. Above all, Wurtsmith attempted {{to make sure that he}} had enough P-40s in commission to outnumber the Japanese. The efforts of the ground crews and service troops made this possible. By May 1942, he had lost seven P-40s and three pilots while claiming the destruction of 38 Japanese aircraft. The heaviest Japanese attack had been by nine fighters and 24 bombers, which Wurtsmith had met with 50 P-40s; the P-40 pilots claimed 11 Japanese aircraft shot down. May was the first month that passed without a raid since January but the Japanese returned on four consecutive days in June, with three of these raids consisting of 18 to 20 fighters and 27 bombers. That month nine P-40s and 13 Japanese aircraft were lost. Wurtsmith was promoted to colonel on 6 July 1942. Between March 1942 and January 1943, his fighters claimed to have downed 78 enemy aircraft.|$|E

25|$|Another way to {{understand}} the Aeroscraft’s VTOL capability is to compare the Aeroscraft to a submarine. For example, when a submarine needs <b>to</b> <b>dive</b> <b>into</b> the water, it takes on water to make it heavier. When the submarine needs to surface, it releases that water to become lighter. Similarly, the Aeroscraft can control its weight by releasing and taking on air, controlling the heaviness or lightness of the vehicle.|$|E

25|$|Two {{days after}} the {{conversion}} was completed, BAVG-1 was transferred to and commissioned in the Royal Navy {{as part of the}} Lend-Lease program. On 23 December 1941, three US Navy Grumman F4F Wildcats landed on Archer for trials to the launch accelerator. The accelerator misfired, causing the first aircraft <b>to</b> <b>dive</b> <b>into</b> the sea as sufficient airspeed had not been gained. The remaining two aircraft were successfully flown off. Archer put into the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 24 December 1941 for repairs to the accelerator, which had been damaged in the misfire. On 2 January 1942, Archer successfully completed her sea trials. On 9 January, she sailed down the Delaware River bound for Norfolk, Virginia where she was to load aircraft for ferrying to the United Kingdom. Her gyro compass failed near Goose Island and then her engines developed problems. After repairs were effected she arrived at Norfolk and on 12 January she embarked eleven Grumman Martlets.|$|E
25|$|On 13 January, a Bell Jet Ranger {{helicopter}} {{that had}} been waterbombing the fires in the forests west of Canberra crashed into Bendora Dam with one person, pilot Duncan Patrick, injured. The pilot was reloading waterbuckets from the dam {{at the time of}} the crash. ACT Chief Minister Jon Stanhope and ACT Chief Fire Control Officer Peter Lucas-Smith were reviewing the fires nearby during a routine bushfire surveillance flight in the Snowy Hydro SouthCare helicopter. The unconscious pilot had been pulled from the sinking wreckage by a SouthCare rescue helicopter medical crewman Euan McKenzie, but due to the weight of his clothes and lack of life vest, was unable to be dragged from the water. The pilot of the Southcare chopper cautiously positioned his aircraft to allow Stanhope, Lucas-Smith and a paramedic on board <b>to</b> <b>dive</b> <b>into</b> the dam and bring the injured pilot about 60 metres to shore for resuscitation by Lucas-Smith and McKenzie. The pilot had head injuries and underwent emergency surgery at Canberra Hospital.|$|E
25|$|The B-57A was not {{considered}} combat-ready by the USAF and the aircraft were used solely for testing and development. One of the aircraft {{was given to the}} National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) which fitted it with a new nose radome and used it to track hurricanes. The aircraft was placed into limited production. Particularly contentious were the cockpit arrangement and the lack of guns, the Canberra having been designed as a high-speed, high altitude bomber rather than for close air support. The definitive B-57B, which introduced numerous improvements, made its first flight on 18 June 1954. The aircraft initially suffered from the same engine malfunctions as the RB-57As and several were lost in high-speed low-level operations due to a faulty tailplane actuator which caused the aircraft <b>to</b> <b>dive</b> <b>into</b> the ground. The USAF came to consider the B-57B as being inadequate for the night intruder role and thus Martin put all aircraft through an extensive avionics upgrade in response. Regardless, by the end of 1957, the USAF tactical squadrons were being re-equipped with supersonic North American F-100 Super Sabres. The complete retirement was delayed, however, by the start of the Vietnam War.|$|E

25|$|Clemente {{spent much}} of his time during the {{off-season}} involved in charity work. When Managua, the capital city of Nicaragua, was affected by a massive earthquake on December 23, 1972, Clemente (who visited Managua three weeks before the quake) immediately set to work arranging emergency relief flights. He soon learned, however, that the aid packages on the first three flights had been diverted by corrupt officials of the Somoza government, never reaching victims of the quake. He decided to accompany the fourth relief flight, hoping that his presence would ensure that the aid would be delivered to the survivors. The airplane he chartered for a New Year's Eve flight, a Douglas DC-7 cargo plane, had a history of mechanical problems and subpar flight personnel, and was overloaded by 4,200 pounds. It crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Isla Verde, Puerto Rico immediately after takeoff on December 31, 1972 due to engine failure. A few days after the crash, the body of the pilot and part of the fuselage of the plane were found. An empty flight case apparently belonging to Clemente was the only personal item recovered from the plane. Clemente's teammate and close friend Manny Sanguillén was {{the only member of the}} Pirates not to attend Roberto's memorial service. The Pirates catcher chose instead <b>to</b> <b>dive</b> <b>into</b> the waters where Clemente's plane had crashed in an effort to find his teammate. The bodies of Clemente and three others who were also on the four-engine plane, were never recovered. Montreal Expos pitcher Tom Walker, then playing winter league ball in Puerto Rico (in a league later named after Clemente), helped Clemente load the plane, but either because of the plane's weight load or because he wanted Walker, who was single, to go enjoy New Year's, Clemente told him not to join him on the flight. Walker's son is current Milwaukee Brewers second baseman and former Met and Pirate Neil Walker.|$|E
25|$|The Cardinals {{fell into}} an early deficit when Buffalo quarterback Drew Willy {{completed}} {{a pass to}} Naam Roosevelt for a two-yard touchdown. The Cardinals responded midway through the second quarter as MiQuale Lewis ran for a four-yard touchdown. As the first half expired, Ian McGarvey kicked a 47-yard field goal to give the Cardinals a 10–7 lead. In the third quarter, Willy completed a 39-yard pass to Roosevelt to give the Bulls the lead 14–10. The Cardinals responded on the next drive, as Lewis concluded a seven-play, 65yard drive with his second touchdown of the game, this time on a one-yard run to give the Cardinals the lead. After recovering a fumble, the Cardinals offense {{made it all the}} way to the Buffalo one-yard line, but a two-yard loss and a false start penalty pushed the ball back to the eight-yard line. On the next play, Nate Davis attempted <b>to</b> <b>dive</b> <b>into</b> the end zone, but fumbled the ball and was recovered by Buffalo's Mike Newton, who ran the ball back 92yards for a touchdown. After getting to the Buffalo 15yard line, the Cardinals fumbled for the third time and was run back for a 74-yard touchdown by Buffalo's Sherrod Lott for a 28–17 lead. The Cardinals fourth fumble of the game, which was forced and recovered by Buffalo’s Adekunle Akingba, set up Willy’s third touchdown pass to Roosevelt on an eight-yard completion to increase the lead to 35–17. The Cardinals cut the Buffalo lead back to 11points with 4:17remaining in the game after a 22-yard completion from Davis to Louis Johnson. Needing to get the ball back quickly, the Cardinals attempted an onside kick after the score, which was recovered by the Bulls. Buffalo then extended its lead to 18points for a second time at 42–24, on a one-yard touchdown run by James Starks. An interception in the end zone with 41seconds remaining in the game sealed the win for Buffalo. The game received a 1.7Nielsen Rating, which set a Mid-American Conference record for the most viewers to ever watch a game involving two MAC teams on the ESPN family of networks. The Cardinals' fell to #23in the Associated Press poll and to #22in the USA Today and BCS poll.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPurposeThe {{purpose of}} this study was to compare 4 {{techniques}} for arrival at a base after sprinting maximally to reach it: sliding head-first, sliding feet-first, running through the base without slowing, and stopping on the base. A secondary purpose of the study was to determine any advantage there may be <b>to</b> <b>diving</b> <b>into</b> first base <b>to</b> arrive sooner than running through the base. MethodsTwo high-definition video cameras were used to capture 3 -dimensional kinematics of sliding techniques of 9 intercollegiate baseball players. Another video camera was used to time runs from first base to second in 4 counterbalanced conditions: running through the base, sliding head-first, sliding feet-first, and running to a stop. Mathematical modeling was used <b>to</b> simulate <b>diving</b> <b>to</b> first base such that the slide would begin when the hand touches the base. ResultsBased upon overall results, the quickest way to the base is by running through it, followed by head-first, feet-first, and running to a stop. ConclusionThere was a non-significant trend toward an advantage for <b>diving</b> <b>into</b> first base over running through it, but more research is needed, and even if the advantage is real, the risks of executing this technique probably outweigh the miniscule gain...|$|R

500|$|In December 2014, Jed Whedon {{explained}} {{the benefits of}} introducing a society of superhuman characters in the Inhumans, saying [...] "One of the things that, early on {{was very important to}} us last season was, there were so few people in the Cinematic Universe who had powers. Really, only two humans had powers, Captain America and the Hulk. We had to be very responsible—we didn't want <b>to</b> <b>dive</b> <b>into</b> this show and have a new one every week, and have it feel like we disregarded everything that they spent so much money and time building in the films. Along those same lines, the origin of a power is always a complex thing—Marvel cares about it feeling grounded, it feeling scientific at some level. Even on Thor, he says, [...] "In our world, magic and science are the same thing." [...] So this is a way for us to sort of open up our world. It's a way to introduce, into the MCU, the idea that people can be born with a power. They don't have to be engineered in a lab, they don't need to have some freak accident with a vat of acid. They can be born with this. That's sort of a gamechanger, not just on our show, but in the cinematic universe".|$|E

To have it happen in the middle of your first season is an interesting kind of riddle". The writers worked to establish a [...] "regular day at S.H.I.E.L.D." [...] and the existing hierarchy, and then [...] "to blow that up, we knew the way to best illustrate that was by putting it on a personal level with our main man Coulson". Tancharoen elaborated that [...] "We see what it actually looks like for S.H.I.E.L.D. to crumble in Captain America 2, we see the Helicarriers literally barreling through the Triskelion, we see the massive destruction throughout the city, but the benefit of our show is we get <b>to</b> <b>dive</b> <b>into</b> the emotional toll of that." [...] Therefore, it was decided at the beginning of the series that one of the main characters would be a traitor, with Jed Whedon saying [...] "since this is an infiltration based on betrayal on a massive scale, we wanted to have it on the small scale, and have it be a really personal dagger to the heart." ...|$|E
