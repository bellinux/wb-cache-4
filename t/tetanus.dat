5|$|In the United States, {{vaccine is}} {{administered}} {{along with the}} <b>tetanus,</b> diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccines (DTaP) and a pediatric dose of hepatitis B vaccine. In the UK, IPV is combined with <b>tetanus,</b> diphtheria, pertussis, and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccines.|$|E
5|$|Emil von Behring and Kitasato Shibasaburō {{discovered}} in 1890 that diphtheria and <b>tetanus</b> toxins were neutralized {{in the bloodstream}} of animals by substances they called antitoxins, which were specific for the respective toxin. Behring received the first Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their find in 1901. A year after the discovery, Paul Ehrlich used the term antibodies (German Antikörper) for these antitoxins.|$|E
5|$|In the aftermath, {{air rescue}} {{operations}} were conducted, but {{the destruction of}} roads in the area hindered convoys carrying aid. Planes also made supply drops, but rescue operations were hindered by broken roads and rails. Survivors were vaccinated against typhoid and <b>tetanus.</b> Part of Manzanillo was placed under quarantine.|$|E
5|$|Tyler is {{an active}} {{supporter}} of the charitable United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). She was appointed as a Goodwill Ambassador for the United States in 2003. In November 2004, she hosted the lighting of the UNICEF Snowflake in New York City. Tyler also served as spokesperson for the 2004 Givenchy Mother's Day promotion, in support of UNICEF's Maternal and Neonatal <b>Tetanus</b> campaign.|$|E
5|$|The {{city has}} free {{immunization}} programs for children, specifically targeted against the seven major diseases – smallpox, diphtheria, <b>tetanus,</b> yellow fever, whooping cough, polio, and measles. As of 2016, {{a total of}} 31,115 children age one and below has been “fully immunized”. The Manila Dialysis Center that provides free services for the poor has been cited by the United Nations Committee on Innovation, Competitiveness and Public-Private Partnerships {{as a model for}} public-private partnership (PPP) projects.|$|E
5|$|The pelagic {{stingray}} is not aggressive and rarely encountered {{because of its}} habitat preferences, but its very long tail spine demands extreme caution be exercised in handling it. It {{has been responsible for}} two known fatalities: a worker on a tuna longliner who was impaled by a captured ray, and another fishery worker who succumbed to <b>tetanus</b> days after being stung. This species has been kept in public aquariums for almost a century.|$|E
5|$|Anderson et al. argue that, {{aside from}} acute care, {{emergency}} medicine can {{also play a}} significant role in public health. Vaccinations for many diseases such as diphtheria, <b>tetanus</b> and pertussis can be administered by emergency departments, patients can be targeted for specific interventions such as counseling for substance abuse, and conditions like hypertension can be detected and treated. Emergency departments are excellent locations to train health care providers and to collect data, because of the high number of patients. Emergency medicine also improves public health by preventing secondary disease developing from an initial presentation (initial symptoms), and it serves as the first line of defense in disaster scenarios.|$|E
5|$|Bites {{in which}} {{envenomation}} does occur are usually painless {{and may not}} even be noticed when contact is made. Teeth may remain in the wound. Usually, little or no swelling occurs, and rarely are any nearby lymph nodes affected. The most important symptoms are rhabdomyolysis (rapid breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue) and paralysis. Early symptoms include headache, a thick-feeling tongue, thirst, sweating, and vomiting. Symptoms that can occur 30minutes to several hours after the bite include generalized aching, stiffness, and tenderness of muscles all over the body. Passive stretching of the muscles is also painful, and trismus, which is similar to <b>tetanus,</b> is common. This is followed later on by symptoms typical of other elapid envenomations: a progressive flaccid paralysis, starting with ptosis and paralysis of voluntary muscles. Paralysis of muscles involved in swallowing and respiration can be fatal.|$|E
5|$|Burns are {{generally}} preventable. Treatment {{depends on the}} severity of the burn. Superficial burns may be managed with little more than simple pain medication, while major burns may require prolonged treatment in specialized burn centers. Cooling with tap water may help pain and decrease damage; however, prolonged cooling may result in low body temperature. Partial-thickness burns may require cleaning with soap and water, followed by dressings. It is not clear how to manage blisters, but it is probably reasonable to leave them intact if small and drain them if large. Full-thickness burns usually require surgical treatments, such as skin grafting. Extensive burns often require large amounts of intravenous fluid, due to capillary fluid leakage and tissue swelling. The most common complications of burns involve infection. <b>Tetanus</b> toxoid should be given if not up to date.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, formal {{schooling}} had again become {{a feature of}} the islands, and in 1906 the church was extended to make a schoolhouse. The children all now learned English and their native Gaelic. Improved midwifery skills, denied to the island by John Mackay, reduced the problems of childhood <b>tetanus.</b> From the 1880s, trawlers fishing the north Atlantic made regular visits, bringing additional trade. Talk of an evacuation occurred in 1875 during MacKay's time as minister, but despite occasional food shortages and a flu epidemic in 1913, the population was stable at between 75 and 80, and no obvious sign existed that within a few years the millennia-old occupation of the island was to end.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of convincing {{evidence}} of toxicity of thiomersal when used as a vaccine preservative, the USPHS and AAP determined that thiomersal should be removed from vaccines as a purely precautionary measure. This action {{was based on the}} precautionary principle, which assumes that there is no harm in exercising caution even if it later turns out to be unnecessary. The CDC and AAP reasoned that despite {{the lack of}} evidence of significant harm in the use of thiomersal in vaccines, the removal of this preservative would increase the public confidence in the safety of vaccines. Although thiomersal was largely removed from routine infant vaccines by summer 2001 in the U.S., some vaccines continue to contain non-trace amounts of thiomersal, mainly in multi-dose vaccines targeted against influenza and <b>tetanus.</b>|$|E
5|$|If {{bacteria}} form a parasitic {{association with}} other organisms, they are classed as pathogens. Pathogenic bacteria {{are a major}} cause of human death and disease and cause infections such as <b>tetanus,</b> typhoid fever, diphtheria, syphilis, cholera, foodborne illness, leprosy and tuberculosis. A pathogenic cause for a known medical disease may only be discovered many years after, {{as was the case with}} Helicobacter pylori and peptic ulcer disease. Bacterial diseases are also important in agriculture, with bacteria causing leaf spot, fire blight and wilts in plants, as well as Johne's disease, mastitis, salmonella and anthrax in farm animals.|$|E
5|$|Relief {{efforts were}} {{initiated}} by Japanese and American governments immediately following Typhoon Vera. Due to the inundation {{caused by the}} typhoon, localized epidemics were reported, including those of dysentery and <b>tetanus.</b> The spread of disease and blocking debris slowed the ongoing relief efforts. Due to the unprecedented damage and loss of life following Vera, the National Diet passed legislation in order to more efficiently assist affected regions and mitigate future disasters. This included {{the passage of the}} Disaster Countermeasures Basic Act in 1961, which set standards for Japanese disaster relief, including the establishment of the Central Disaster Prevention Council.|$|E
5|$|Some {{survivors}} of Hurricane Liza {{complained that they}} had only received one ration {{of food and water}} within 3 days of the passage of Liza. Subsequently, armed troops guarded gangs of looters that damaged additional homes. An effort was made to cure people who were suffering from sickness, but by midday on October3, after treating more than 5,000persons, the effort had been halted {{due to a lack of}} sterile cotton vital for administrating the shots. Medical workers attempted to vaccinate all survivors for typhoid fever and <b>tetanus,</b> but the supply of syringes ran short. A large memorial service was held on October2 in a nearby church.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Shashthi came to {{represent}} all goddesses and forces responsible for causing diseases {{in children and}} their mothers, who needed to be propitiated on the sixth day after childbirth to prevent these illnesses. Consequently, Shashthi came to personify the sixth day of a child's life. The sixth day of the lunar fortnight is itself called Shashti, a name derived from {{the name of the}} goddess. The Yajnavalkya Smriti, composed during Gupta rule between the 3rd and 5th centuries CE, describes the rites of Shashthi Puja in which Shashthi is worshipped on the sixth day after childbirth to ensure the protection of the newborn baby. According to one explanation for the worship of Shashthi on this day, folk belief associates this critical time in an infant's life with great susceptibility to diseases related to childbirth, such as puerperal fever and <b>tetanus,</b> and that worship of Shashthi is performed to help ward off these diseases.|$|E
5|$|On 10 May 1948, {{the pair}} left {{to work on}} a {{government-funded}} groundnut food scheme in East Africa. There was some difficulty in getting permission for Judy to travel, and it was feared that she and Williams would be split up. This issue was promoted in the Evening Standard, and after the involvement of William Lever, 2nd Viscount Leverhulme, permission was given for Judy to travel with Williams. She had a third and final litter of puppies during her time in Africa. After two years there, Judy was discovered to have a mammary tumour; an operation removed the growth, but a <b>tetanus</b> infection soon set in, and she was euthanized on 17 February 1950 at the age of nearly 14. She was buried in her RAF jacket, with her campaign medals, the Pacific Star, the 1939–1945 Star, and the Defence Medal. Frank spent two months building a granite and marble memorial in her memory, which included a plaque that told of her life story.|$|E
5|$|Some {{cases may}} be {{triggered}} by the influenza virus and potentially influenza vaccine. An increased incidence of Guillain–Barré syndrome followed influenza immunization that followed the 1976 swine flu outbreak (H1N1A/NJ/76); 8.8 cases per million recipients developed the complication. Since then, close monitoring of cases attributable to vaccination has demonstrated that influenza itself can induce GBS. Small increases in incidence have been observed in subsequent vaccination campaigns, {{but not to the}} same extent. The 2009 flu pandemic vaccine (against pandemic swine flu virus H1N1/PDM09) did not cause a significant increase in cases. It is considered that the benefits of vaccination in preventing influenza outweigh the small risks of GBS after vaccination. Even those who have previously experienced Guillain–Barré syndrome are considered safe to receive the vaccine in the future. Other vaccines, such as those against poliomyelitis, <b>tetanus</b> or measles, have not been associated with a risk of GBS.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to the hospital on 12 July for a <b>tetanus</b> injection, Behan was arrested by five policemen and taken to their Arcidosso barracks for questioning. He {{did not know what}} was happening at first as the police had no interpreter in the barracks. He was only provided with a lawyer and interpreter 15 hours later when a magistrate from Grosseto came. Behan exercised his right not to answer questions. He was released, but was formally informed that he was under suspicion. As of 15 July 2008 he was the only suspect in the case. The police subsequently seized his car and a knife from his home, and secured a room in the house in which traces of blood were allegedly found. In addition, shoe prints found were said to have matched his footwear. Custody of his car and home (except for the cellar) were returned to him on 14 July by the judge overseeing the investigation.|$|E
5|$|Insects {{have been}} used medicinally in {{cultures}} around the world, often according to the Doctrine of Signatures. Thus, the femurs of grasshoppers, which were said to resemble the human liver, were used to treat liver ailments by the indigenous peoples of Mexico. The doctrine was applied in both Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and in Ayurveda. TCM uses arthropods for various purposes; for example, centipede is used to treat <b>tetanus,</b> seizures, and convulsions, while the Chinese Black Mountain Ant, Polyrhachis vicina, {{is used as a}} cure all, especially by the elderly, and extracts have been examined as a possible anti-cancer agent. Ayurveda uses insects such as Termite for conditions such as ulcers, rheumatic diseases, anaemia, and pain. The Jatropha leaf miner's larvae are used boiled to induce lactation, reduce fever, and soothe the gastrointestinal tract. In contrast, the traditional insect medicine of Africa is local and unformalised. The indigenous peoples of Central America used a wide variety of insects medicinally. Mayans used Army ant soldiers as living sutures. The venom of the Red harvester ant was used to cure rheumatism, arthritis, and poliomyelitis via the immune reaction produced by its sting. Boiled silkworm pupae were taken to treat apoplexy, aphasy, bronchitis, pneumonia, convulsions, haemorrhages, and frequent urination.|$|E
5|$|The floodwaters {{from the}} {{hurricane}} combined with raw sewage in many poor areas of southwestern Mexico, {{leading to a}} widespread threat for a spread of tropical diseases. As a result, government health workers opened vaccination centers in several cities along the Guerrero and Oaxaca coasts. Thousands were inoculated for typhoid fever and <b>tetanus.</b> Officials noted a potential threat for dengue and cholera {{as a result of}} the spoiled water. Health workers also stated mosquitos possessing malaria and dengue fever were likely to breed in large areas of leftover water. In Acapulco, about two days after the hurricane passed, the first day of sun in a week evaporated the areas of leftover water, spreading dust across the region with the deadly diseases. Residents were warned to boil their food and water for 30minutes due to the threat for contamination by the dust. At least twenty cases of cholera and at least six cases of dengue fever were reported. Most significantly, there were 14,630cases of malaria in 616villages in Oaxaca due to Pauline; this represented about 80% of the malaria cases in Mexico during 1998. Army soldiers distributed chlorine tablets to disinfect water pools and wheelbarrows to remove rotting mud and sewage from their damaged homes. Two C-130 Hercules planes and twenty helicopters airlifted food and water to smaller villages south of Acapulco that were stranded for nearly a week after the hurricane.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tetanus</b> toxoid can {{be given}} {{in case of a}} {{suspected}} exposure to <b>tetanus.</b> In such cases, it {{can be given}} with or without <b>tetanus</b> immunoglobulin (also called <b>tetanus</b> antibodies or <b>tetanus</b> antitoxin). It can be given as intravenous therapy or by intramuscular injection.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tetanus</b> vaccine, {{also known}} as <b>tetanus</b> toxoid (TT), is an {{inactive}} vaccine used to prevent <b>tetanus.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Tetanus</b> can be {{prevented}} through the highly effective <b>tetanus</b> vaccine, which is a <b>tetanus</b> toxin inactivated with formaldehyde to be immunogenic but not pathogenic. The vaccine can be formulated as simple or adsorbed <b>tetanus</b> vaccine, combined <b>tetanus</b> and killed polio vaccine, or the older (diphtheria, <b>tetanus,</b> pertussis) (DPT) vaccine. Side effects are rare, {{but if they do}} occur, include fever, pain (sometimes long lasting) at the injection site, unexplained crying in infants, and irritability in older children or adults.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tetanus</b> {{was known}} to ancient people, who {{recognized}} the relationship between wounds and fatal muscle spasms. In 1884, Arthur Nicolaier isolated the strychnine-like toxin of <b>tetanus</b> from free-living, anaerobic soil bacteria. The etiology of the disease was further elucidated in 1890 by Antonio Carle and Giorgio Rattone, who demonstrated the transmissibility of <b>tetanus</b> for the first time. They produced <b>tetanus</b> in rabbits by injecting their sciatic nerve with pus from a fatal human <b>tetanus</b> case in that same year.|$|E
25|$|In {{children}} under the age of seven, the <b>tetanus</b> vaccine is often administered as a combined vaccine, DPT/DTaP vaccine, which also includes vaccines against diphtheria and pertussis. For adults and children over seven, the Td vaccine (<b>tetanus</b> and diphtheria) or Tdap (<b>tetanus,</b> diphtheria, and acellular pertussis) is commonly used.|$|E
25|$|There are {{currently}} no blood tests for diagnosing <b>tetanus.</b> The diagnosis {{is based on}} the presentation of <b>tetanus</b> symptoms and does not depend upon isolation of the bacterium, which is recovered from the wound in only 30% of cases and can be isolated from patients without <b>tetanus.</b> Laboratory identification of C. tetani can be demonstrated only by production of tetanospasmin in mice. Having recently experienced head trauma may indicate cephalic <b>tetanus</b> if no other diagnosis has been made.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tetanus</b> {{has become}} {{uncommon}} in the United States, {{with an average}} of 29 reported cases per year from 1996 through 2009. Nearly all cases of <b>tetanus</b> are among those who have never received a <b>tetanus</b> vaccine, or adults who don't stay up to date on their 10-year booster shots.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tetanus</b> can be {{prevented}} by vaccination with <b>tetanus</b> toxoid. The CDC recommends that adults receive a booster vaccine every ten years, and standard care practice in many places {{is to give the}} booster to any patient with a puncture wound who is uncertain of when he or she was last vaccinated, or if he or she has had fewer than three lifetime doses of the vaccine. The booster may not prevent a potentially fatal case of <b>tetanus</b> from the current wound, however, as it can take up to two weeks for <b>tetanus</b> antibodies to form.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tetanus</b> {{is caused}} by the <b>tetanus</b> {{bacterium}} Clostridium tetani. <b>Tetanus</b> is an international health problem, as C.tetani spores are ubiquitous. Spores can be introduced into the body through a puncture wound (penetrating trauma). Because C.tetani is an anaerobic bacterium, it and its endospores thrive in environments that lack oxygen. such as a puncture wound.|$|E
25|$|Local <b>tetanus</b> is an {{uncommon}} {{form of the}} disease, in which patients have persistent contraction of muscles in the same anatomic area as the injury. The contractions may persist for many weeks before gradually subsiding. Local <b>tetanus</b> is generally milder; only about 1% of cases are fatal, but it may precede the onset of generalized <b>tetanus.</b>|$|E
25|$|The World Health Organization {{certifies}} {{countries as}} having eliminated maternal or neonatal <b>tetanus.</b> Certification requires {{at least two}} years of rates of less than 1 case per 1000 live births. In 1998 in Uganda, 3,433 <b>tetanus</b> cases were recorded in newborn babies; of these, 2,403 died. After a major public health effort, Uganda in 2011 was certified as having eliminated <b>tetanus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Cephalic <b>tetanus</b> is {{the rarest}} {{form of the}} disease (0.9–3% of cases) and is limited to muscles and nerves in the head. It usually occurs after trauma to the head area, {{including}} skull fracture, laceration, eye injury, dental extraction, and otitis media, {{but it has been}} observed from injuries {{to other parts of the}} body. Paralysis of the facial nerve is most frequently implicated, which may cause lockjaw, facial palsy, or ptosis, but other cranial nerves can also be affected. Cephalic <b>tetanus</b> may progress to a more generalized form of the disease. Due to its rarity, clinicians may be unfamiliar with the clinical presentation and may not suspect <b>tetanus</b> as the illness. Treatment can be complicated as symptoms may be concurrent with the initial injury that caused the infection. Cephalic <b>tetanus</b> is more likely than other forms of <b>tetanus</b> to be fatal, with the progression to generalized <b>tetanus</b> carrying a 15–30% case fatality rate.|$|E
25|$|In 1890 {{antibody}} {{therapy was}} used to treat <b>tetanus,</b> when serum from immunized horses was injected into patients with severe <b>tetanus</b> {{in an attempt to}} neutralize the <b>tetanus</b> toxin, and prevent the dissemination of the disease. Since the 1960s, human <b>tetanus</b> immune globulin (TIG) has been used in the United States in unimmunized, vaccine-naive or incompletely immunized patients who have sustained wounds consistent with the development of <b>tetanus.</b> The administration of horse antitoxin remains the only specific pharmacologic treatment available for botulism. Antitoxin also known as heterologous hyperimmune serum is often also given prophylactically to individuals known to have ingested contaminated food. IVIG treatment was also used successfully to treat several victims of toxic shock syndrome, during the 1970s tampon scare.|$|E
25|$|Vaccines {{typically}} contain {{one or more}} adjuvants, used {{to boost}} the immune response. <b>Tetanus</b> toxoid, for instance, is usually adsorbed onto alum. This presents the antigen {{in such a way}} as to produce a greater action than the simple aqueous <b>tetanus</b> toxoid. People who have an adverse reaction to adsorbed <b>tetanus</b> toxoid may be given the simple vaccine when the time comes for a booster.|$|E
25|$|Some diseases, such as <b>tetanus,</b> cause disease not by {{bacterial}} growth but by bacterial {{production of a}} toxin. <b>Tetanus</b> toxin is so lethal that humans cannot develop immunity to a natural infection, {{as the amount of}} toxin and time required to kill a person is much less than is required by the immune system to recognize the toxin and produce antibodies against it. However the <b>tetanus</b> toxin is easily denatured losing its ability to produce disease, but leaving it able to induce immunity to <b>tetanus</b> when injected into subjects. The denatured toxin is called a toxoid.|$|E
25|$|Unlike many {{infectious}} diseases, {{recovery from}} naturally acquired <b>tetanus</b> does not usually result in immunity to <b>tetanus.</b> This {{is due to}} the extreme potency of the tetanospasmin toxin. Tetanospasmin will likely be lethal before it will provoke an immune response.|$|E
