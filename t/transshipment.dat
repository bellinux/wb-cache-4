Hearings were held a week later, at which Shelley Clarke, a researcher at Imperial College London who studies the shark-fin trade, observed that <b>transshipment</b> operations such as the KD IIs were common and would likely continue as the competition in Hong Kong, the industry's traditional center, grew more intense. While the <b>transshipment</b> ban was an effective response to the decision, she suggested that shipments of containerized fins be allowed {{if they had been}} separated from their carcasses after landing.|$|E

5|$|The Big Inch and Little Big Inch, collectively {{known as}} the Inch pipelines, are {{petroleum}} pipelines extending from Texas to New Jersey, built between 1942 and 1944 as emergency war measures in the U.S. Before World War II, petroleum products were transported from the oil fields of Texas to the north-eastern states by sea by oil tankers. After the United States entered the war on 1 January 1942, this vital link was attacked by German submarines in the Operation Paukenschlag, threatening both the oil supplies to the north-east and its onward <b>transshipment</b> to Great Britain.

5|$|A {{temporary}} slipway {{was built}} at the New Admiralty Shipyard in January 1871 and construction of Novgorod, named after the city, began on 13 April. Using two shifts to speed construction, her hull was completed by 29 December, when the official keel-laying ceremony was held. Within two weeks it was disassembled, and the first shipment of parts arrived at Nikolaev on 2 April 1872. Reassembly began on a specially-prepared slipway eight days later. As there was no rail line between Saint Petersburg and Nikolaev, the components had to be railed to Odessa, where they were transshipped onto river barges and steamers. The boilers were too large {{and had to be}} shipped by freighter from the Baltic Sea to Odessa for <b>transshipment.</b> Construction was delayed by late deliveries of parts and the workforce's lack of experience; the ship was finally launched on 2 June 1873, with Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich in attendance. Novgorods guns were mounted in September, and she entered service the following year, at a cost of 2,830,000 rubles.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the mid-1930s, Orizaba {{often carried}} {{gold and silver}} bars from Veracruz to New York for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Chase National Bank, or for later <b>transshipment</b> to London. In October 1933 three short tons (2.7tonnes) of gold bars and coins were shipped on Orizaba for {{eventual}} delivery to London, prompting some to believe that gold was being smuggled into Mexico {{to take advantage of}} its policy of not charging duties on gold. In July 1934 Orizaba brought in 16cases of Mexican gold, and in January 1935, 20cases; in both instances, for delivery to Chase National Bank. Twice in 1935, the Ward liner delivered over 1,000bars of silver for the Federal Reserve Bank, bringing 1,390bars in March, and 1,933bars in July. Mexico was not the only place from which Orizaba delivered precious metals. In March 1934, she delivered 12cases of gold—consisting of 84 bars, and worth $1,624,000—from Havana for Chase.|$|E
5|$|However, as <b>transshipment</b> costs increased, and {{unprocessed}} bulk cargos {{decreased in}} volume, {{the economics of}} road transport resulted in a gradual dwindling of traffic on the MSC Railway system, and hence contraction in the MSC Railway itself. Traffic reduction was added to by: the 1969 closure of the CWS Irlam soap works; post nationalisation British Steel Corporation building their own line to Glazebrook to junction with BR; and severe reductions in traffic of ICI's soda ash trains, British Tar Products and reduced domestic coal consumption. With the remaining engines stationed at Ellesmere Port and Stanlow, maintenance {{on the line from}} Irlam through to Partington was halted in late summer 1977, and all through traffic except engineering trains stopped on 21 December 1977. The through line was officially closed to all traffic in 1978, but many of the sidings complexes remained; the last operational section of the MSC Railway, at Trafford Park, closed on 30 April 2009.|$|E
40|$|Lateral <b>transshipments</b> are {{a method}} of {{responding}} to shortages of stock in a network of inventory-holding locations. Conventional reactive approaches only seek to meet immediate shortages. The study proposes hybrid <b>transshipments</b> which exploit economies of scale by moving additional stock between locations to prevent future shortages in addition to meeting immediate ones. The setting considered is motivated by retailers who operate networks of outlets supplying car parts via a system of periodic replenishment. It is novel in allowing non-stationary stochastic demand and general patterns of dependence between multiple item types. The generality of our work makes it widely applicable. We develop an easy-to-compute quasi-myopic heuristic for determining how hybrid <b>transshipments</b> should be made.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 67 - 72). To survive in today's competitive market, firms {{need to meet}} customer expectations by offering high quality products with high variety. However, {{there might be some}} physical and financial constraints limiting the assortment size. The process of finding the optimal product assortment by considering both the benefits of a large assortment as well as the costs and limits of it is known as assortment planning. In this thesis, assortment planning is analyzed under predetermined assortment capacity limits for two cases. First, a single firm's optimal assortment problem is studied to maximize its profits. Second, assortment planning problem of a system of multiple firms is investigated jointly, where firms are interacting through product sharing, called <b>transshipments.</b> <b>Transshipments</b> are known to increase product availability, thus decreasing stock-outs. <b>Transshipments</b> have been always utilized as an emergency demand satisfaction action in support of inventory management in the literature. Differently, in this study, <b>transshipments</b> are evaluated in advance of inventory management while making the assortment planning of firms. In both problems, demand is defined to have an exogenous model, where each customer has a predetermined preference for each product from the potential set. Proportional demand substitutions are also allowed from an out of assortment product to others. The results on the optimal assortment of a single firm are used as a benchmark to the optimal assortments of multiple firms communicating through <b>transshipments.</b> By relying on proven optimality results, it is shown how easily optimal assortments can be obtained compared to a full enumeration. Extensive numerical analyses are reported on the performances of the heuristic algorithm and sensitivity of optimal assortments to system parameters. by Ecem Cephe. M. S...|$|R

5|$|The {{economy of}} Dawson Creek {{is based on}} four major industries: agriculture, retail, tourism, and oil and gas. Agriculture has {{historically}} been the most important industry to Dawson Creek, as the city is the regional <b>transshipment</b> point for agricultural commodities. The city is surrounded by the Agricultural Land Reserve, where the soil can support livestock and produces consistently good yields of quality grain and grass crops, such as canola, hay, oats, alfalfa, wheat, and sweet clover. The service and retail sector caters to the city's inhabitants, smaller nearby towns, and rural communities. However, there is significant retail leakage to Grande Prairie, the closest major Alberta city, {{where there is no}} provincial tax on retail purchases, while British Columbia charges 7%. In 2006, the BC government rejected a proposal to lower the sales tax in the province's border communities to 4%. The problem of leakage has been exacerbated in recent years by the introduction of large-format retail stores into the small city. Residents still cross the border for high-priced items but now also purchase medium- and low-priced items from foreign-owned large-format chain stores.|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} the {{secondary}} capital city of Luoyang, which was the favored capital of the two by Empress Wu.

With {{a population of about}} a million, Luoyang became the second largest city in the empire, and with its close proximity to the Luo River it benefited from southern agricultural fertility and trade traffic of the Grand Canal. However, the Tang court eventually demoted its capital status and did not visit Luoyang after the year 743, when Chang'an's problem of acquiring adequate supplies and stores for the year was solved. As early as 736, granaries were built at critical points along the route from Yangzhou to Chang'an, which eliminated shipment delays, spoilage, and pilfering. An artificial lake used as a <b>transshipment</b> pool was dredged east of Chang'an in 743, where curious northerners could finally see the array of boats found in southern China, delivering tax and tribute items to the imperial court.|$|E

5|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} Gibraltar changed following {{the invention of}} steamships; {{the first one to}} reach Gibraltar's harbour arrived there in 1823. The advent of steamships caused a major shift in trade patterns in the Mediterranean. <b>Transshipment,</b> which had previously been Gibraltar's principal economic mainstay, was largely replaced by the much less lucrative work of servicing visiting steamships through coaling, victualling and ferrying of goods. Although Gibraltar became a key coaling station where British steamships refuelled on the way to Alexandria or Cape Horn, the economic changes resulted in a prolonged depression that lasted until {{near the end of the}} century. The demand for labour for coaling was such that Gibraltar instituted the practice of relying on large numbers of imported Spanish workers. A shanty town sprang up on the site of the old Spanish fortifications just across the border, which became the workers' town of La Línea de la Concepción. The poor economy meant that Gibraltar's population barely changed between 1830 and 1880, but it was still relatively more prosperous than the severely impoverished south of Spain. As a consequence, La Línea's population doubled over the same period and then doubled again in the following 20 years.|$|E
5|$|The first {{railway station}} {{to be built}} in Trondheim was located at Kalvskinnet, to serve the narrow gauge Trondhjem–Støren Line railway that was {{completed}} in 1864. The station was designed by Georg Andreas Bull, and still exists as a synagogue. In 1877 the state and city made an agreement to build a new station at Brattøra to serve the new Meråker Line that was being built to Sweden. Brattøra was chosen because it was located directly beside the port, and would allow direct <b>transshipment</b> from ships to the railway of both goods and passengers. The station would become the main station for both railways; this caused a major protest among the local population, who felt it was necessary to have two terminal stations, one for each line, and the city brought the matter before the courts—the case was settled in 1895 in favor of one station. The lack of planning and coordination between the two lines made the new station a large budget cost for the Meråker Line; and described as one of few exceptions to the small-and-cheap policy dominating the state railways i Norway at the time.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} shows that organizations {{with a number of}} "sister" plants, warehouses, or other stocking points can profit from the concept of proactive use of <b>transshipments</b> as an element of their inventory control policy. For certain types of parts, employing <b>transshipments</b> can significantly reduce the total inventory needed throughout the entire collection of stocking points. The study is motivated by a real-life situation involving a large utility company having 29 power-generating plants in five Southeastern states where there are thousands of parts that are commonly used at multiple plants. At present, each plant operates independently and maintains enough stock to meet its own requirements. <b>Transshipments</b> take place between plants whenever there is an emergency requirement for a part, but no explicit consideration is given to this effect while deciding on stocking levels at different plants. In the case we examined, by setting stocking levels to explicitly take account of <b>transshipments,</b> total system cost could be reduced by about 70 % over the company's decentralized policy. In general, this work considers a single-echelon, N-location, continuous-review inventory system in which complete pooling of stock is permitted among the locations. A model is developed for slow-moving, expensive, and consumable parts that are common to two or more locations. A one-for-one ordering policy and queueing theory allow development and solution of a system of equations for the probability distribution of net inventory at each location. A heuristic procedure is also developed to determine cost-effective stocking levels. Actual data from the utility company are used to demonstrate the applicability of the model. Savings achieved as a result of pooling are reported. Inventory Control, Pooling, Multi-Echelon Models, State-Dependent Rates...|$|R
