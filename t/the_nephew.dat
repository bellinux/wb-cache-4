Popeye eventually hears the racket and destroys the radio trying to find what's causing the noise. He soon finds out it's coming from <b>the</b> <b>nephews</b> and tries to catch them in the act.

When the uncle died <b>the</b> <b>nephew</b> refused to pay the widow the money required, arguing that as she was not party to the original agreement she could not benefit from it. The Court of Appeal under Lord Denning tried to use {{this as an opportunity to}} claim that the doctrine of privity was invalid, something the House of Lords rejected. However, the Lords did agree that Mrs Beswick could sue, not as a third party to the contract but as the executrix of her husband's estate.
