Influenced by Walter Rauschenbusch and the Social Gospel movement, McGovern began divinity studies at Garrett Theological Seminary in Evanston, Illinois, near Chicago. He preached as a Methodist student supply minister at Diamond Lake Church in Mundelein, Illinois, during 1946 and 1947, but became dissatisfied by <b>the</b> <b>minutiae</b> <b>of</b> his pastoral duties. In late 1947, McGovern left the ministry and enrolled in graduate studies at Northwestern University in Evanston, {{where he also}} worked as a teaching assistant. The relatively small history program there was {{among the best in}} the country and McGovern took courses given by noted academics Ray Allen Billington, Richard W. Leopold, and L. S. Stavrianos. He received an M.A. in history in 1949.|$|E
5|$|Heian {{culture and}} court life reached a peak {{early in the}} 11th century. The {{population}} of Kyoto grew to around 100,000 as the nobility became increasingly isolated at the Heian Palace in government posts and court service. Courtiers became overly refined with little to do, insulated from reality, preoccupied with <b>the</b> <b>minutiae</b> <b>of</b> court life, turning to artistic endeavors. Emotions were commonly expressed through the artistic use of textiles, fragrances, calligraphy, colored paper, poetry, and layering of clothing in pleasing color combinations—according to mood and season. Those who showed an inability to follow conventional aesthetics quickly lost popularity, particularly at court. Popular pastimes for Heian noblewomen—who adhered to rigid fashions of floor-length hair, whitened skin and blackened teeth—included having love affairs, writing poetry and keeping diaries. The literature that Heian court women wrote is recognized {{as some of the}} earliest and among the best literature written in the Japanese canon.|$|E

It was a bold, imaginative project aimed at disrupting Jacobite supply routes, and one which the Earl conceived and executed with outstanding success.

For his efforts, Karađorđe received the Order of Saint Anna from the Russians. The Governing Council scrambled {{to take an}} oath of loyalty to Russia in the hope that this would garner them further protection, to no avail. The Russian Emperor, Alexander, was aware of Napoleon's plans to invade Russia and desperately sought to return as many Russian soldiers as possible in order to repel the attack. As part of the Treaty of Bucharest, the Russians and Ottomans agreed that Serbian fortifications built after 1804 were to be destroyed, while cities and forts from which the Ottomans had been expelled {{over the course of the}} uprising were to be reoccupied and garrisoned by Ottoman troops. In exchange, the Ottomans agreed to declare a general amnesty for former rebels, as well as to grant the Serbs of the Pashalik of Belgrade some degree of autonomy. As part of the agreement, the Russians agreed to withdraw their forces from Serbia, as well as from Wallachia and Moldavia. The Russians encouraged Karađorđe and his followers to negotiate directly with the Porte regarding <b>the</b> <b>minutiae</b> <b>of</b> the handover of cities and fortifications to the Ottomans. Trepidation filled the rebel camp once it became clear that there was nothing to prevent the Ottomans from exacting reprisals against the Pashalik's Serb population after the Russians withdrew.

The house, in an H-plan, has a pedimented central block and lightly projecting end pavilions.

40|$|Abstract—Most fingerprint-based {{biometric}} systems store <b>the</b> <b>minutiae</b> template <b>of</b> a user in the database. It {{has been}} traditionally assumed that <b>the</b> <b>minutiae</b> template <b>of</b> a user does not reveal {{any information about}} the original fingerprint. In this paper, we challenge this notion and show that three levels {{of information about the}} parent fingerprint can be elicited from <b>the</b> <b>minutiae</b> template alone, viz., 1) the orientation field information, 2) the class or type information, and 3) the friction ridge structure. The orientation estimation algorithm determines the direction of local ridges using <b>the</b> evidence <b>of</b> <b>minutiae</b> triplets. <b>The</b> estimated orientation field, along with <b>the</b> given <b>minutiae</b> distribution, is then used to predict the class of the fingerprint. Finally, the ridge structure of the parent fingerprint is generated using streamlines that are based on the estimated orientation field. Line Integral Convolution is used to impart texture to the ensuing ridges, resulting in a ridge map resembling the parent fingerprint. The salient feature of this noniterative method to generate ridges is its ability to preserve <b>the</b> <b>minutiae</b> at specified locations in the reconstructed ridge map. Experiments using a commercial fingerprint matcher suggest that the reconstructed ridge structure bears close resemblance to the parent fingerprint...|$|R

40|$|As {{automated}} fingerprint recognition systems gain popularity, {{the proliferation}} of information about unchangeable biometric characteristics causes serious privacy and security concerns. This information may enable an impostor to create a matching fingerprint, and the stored information should therefore be considered extremely sensitive. This thesis explores a novel method for generating cancellable fingerprint templates that will impede the reproduction of a fingerprint from the stored template, {{and at the same}} time allow the same fingerprint to be reused in the case of a compromise. During enrollment, the proposed method aligns <b>the</b> <b>minutiae</b> points <b>of</b> a fingerprint to a reference coordinate system using the core and principal direction, and creates a hash value based on <b>the</b> set <b>of</b> <b>minutiae</b> points. It then generates Reed-Solomon error correction codes which enable the reproduction of <b>the</b> full set <b>of</b> <b>minutiae</b> points if a certain number <b>of</b> <b>minutiae</b> points are known. It then performs an irreversible Cartesian block transformation on <b>the</b> <b>minutiae</b> points. During <b>the</b> matching process, <b>the</b> <b>minutiae</b> points <b>of</b> <b>the</b> candidate print are similarly aligned, and transformed using the same Cartesian transformation. A standard matching algorithm is performed on <b>the</b> <b>minutiae</b> sets in <b>the</b> transformed space, which allows the Cartesian transformation to be reversed for <b>the</b> matching <b>minutiae</b> points in <b>the</b> enrolled template.

The same hash value created for the fingerprint during enrollment can thus be re-generated when a matching fingerprint is presented.
