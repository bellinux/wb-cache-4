The carryback in reference is the fines that cling to the conveyor belt after the belt's cargo has been discharged over the head pulley. Having resisted the centrifugal force to be thrown off with the cargo, these fines are sticky enough {{to remain on the}} belt. As the belt returns to the <b>tail</b> <b>pulley,</b> the idlers that support the belt and the pulleys that bend the belt, dislodge this carried back material, causing it to fall and collect in piles and the very fine particles to become airborne. Recently I visited a plant that had a 42 " wide conveyor belt carrying lignite from storage into the plant. An engineer was assigned to make a study determining if the fugitive material that was creating the "DURT" " problem was coming from the belt, and if it was, what to do about it. He was undecided if it was fugitive because of carryback or because of wind effect as the wind swept across the conveyor. If indeed the problem was from wind effect, a gallery would have to be built to enclose the conveyor. Assisting in this investigation, 1 placed a carryback gauge against the bottom of the return strand of the conveyor belt near the head pulley. This gauge is a measuring device with blades that will scrape a one inch wide area when pressed against the moving belt. Any particles clinging to the belt are scraped off and collected in the container of the device. The carryback gauge was placed against the belt at three different locations across the width of the belt; in the center and 10 inches left and right of center. The removed carryback material was measured. It was found to be an average of. 08 ounces in a 10 second period. The belt was traveling at 592 feet per minute...|$|E
5000|$|In 1741, Jacques de Vaucanson, a French {{inventor}} {{who designed}} and built automated mechanical toys, was appointed inspector of silk factories. [...] Between 1747 and 1750, he tried to automate Bouchon’s mechanism. In Vaucanson's mechanism, the hooks that were to lift the warp threads were selected by long pins or [...] "needles", which were pressed against a sheet of punched paper that was draped around a perforated cylinder. Specifically, each hook passed at a right angle through an eyelet of a needle. When the cylinder was pressed against the array of needles, some of the needles, pressing against solid paper, would move forward, which in turn would tilt the corresponding hooks. The hooks that were tilted would not be raised, so the warp threads that were snagged by those hooks would remain in place; however, the hooks that were not tilted, would be raised, and the warp threads that were snagged by those hooks would also be raised. By placing his mechanism above the loom, Vaucanson eliminated the complicated system of weights and cords (<b>tail</b> cords, simple, <b>pulley</b> box, etc.) {{that had been used}} to select which warp threads were to be raised during weaving. Vaucanson also added a ratchet mechanism to advance the punched paper each time that the cylinder was pushed against the row of hooks. [...] However, Vaucanson’s loom was not successful, probably because, like Bouchon’s mechanism, it could not control enough warp threads to make sufficiently elaborate patterns to justify the cost of the mechanism.|$|R
