40|$|O presente estudo anatômico de Coffea arabica L. var. typica Cramer tem por finalidade fornecer informações básicas necessárias ao estudo da anatomia comparada das principais espécies e variedades de cafeeiros, cultivadas no Estado de São Paulo. Nesta primeira contribuição o autor realiza o estudo anatômico detalhado dos órgãos vegetativos e reprodutivos da variedade typica, não se limitando apenas à anatomia descritiva dos diversos órgãos, mas também, sempre que possível, discutindo o desenvolvimento ontogenético das diversas partes do cafeeiro. No estudo da raíz e do caule procurou-se estabelecer a duração do desenvolvimento primário, assinalando o local de aparecimento, primeiramente do câmbio {{vascular}} e, posteriormente, do felógeno ou câmbio suberoso. Na discussão da anatonia das folhas mereceu especial atenção o estudo das domácias, sua morfologia e possível função. As flores são estudadas detalhadamente nos seus diversos elementos. Nos capítulos referentes à anatomia do fruto e da semente, além do estudo puramente descritivo das suas estruturas são ainda discutidas as diversas modificações verificadas durante o desenvolvimento do ovário e dos óvulos, respectivamente em fruto e sementes. The {{knowledge of}} the anatomy of Coffea arabica L. var. typica Cramer {{should be considered as}} a basic contribution to the comparative study of the anatomy of coffee species and varieties cultivated in the State of São Paulo, Brazil. The detailed investigations carried out on the vegetative and reproductive organs of the coffee plant revealed the following. The roots {{at the end of the}} primary growth present a protostelic, poliarch (6, 7, 8, 9, 11 primary xylem bundles), and exarch structure, the following tissues or zone of tissues being visible: root cap, epidermis, exodermis, cortex, endodermis, pericycle, primary phloem and primary xylem. This primary growth has a very short duration and is very soon followed by the secondary growth, formed from a vascular cambium which makes its first appearance in a region localized approximately 5 cm from the root apex. Phellogen arises first in the pericycle and later in phloem and gives origin to a relatively thin periderm; this protective layer replaces the epidermis that is gradually killed and sloughs away. Lateral roots originate from pericyclic cells situated at the protoxylem outer edges. The origin of all stem tissues, as well as those of the leaves, can be traced back to a dome-shaped shoot apex, which measure 220 - 360 microns in diameter and 48 - 120 microns in its major height; this shoot apex interpreted under the terms of Schmidt's theory shows to possess a tunica composed of two or three cell layers, and a corpus, represented by a central core of irregularly arranged cells. Differentiation of meristematic tissue initiates at the distance of 800 - 900 microns from the shoot apex, but the complete primary tissue differentiation is only achieved in a region situated 2. 5 cm from the shoot apex. Stem cross sections at this level exhibit the following tissue zones: epidermis, angular collenchyma, cortical parenchyma, pericycle, primary phloem, primary xylem and pith. No distinct endodermis is visible. The vascular cambium, firstly visible in a region distant 2. 5 cm from the shoot apex, originates from procambial cells localized between the xylem and phloem, being at the beginning only fascicular; the cells of the primary rays undergo cambiform meristematic activity, and interfascicular cambium is thereby formed between the vascular bundles. Following a centripetal differentiation the cambial derivatives give rise to a continuous band of secondary xylem and secondary phloem. Older stem cross sections present a periderm which is about 70 microns thick. Cork cambium arises from the innermost cells of cortex and produces cork externally and phelloderm internally. Petiole presents a tricyclic structure, exhibiting three vascular bundles, the major one corresponding to the mid-rib; all the bundles show a normal orientation of the xylem and phloem tissues. Secondary vascular bundles are also present towards the wings of the petiole cross section. The structure of foliage blade is that of typical leaves of dorsiventral symmetry. At an early stage the blade consists of seven layers of relatively undifferentiated cells. At maturity, just one layer of palisade parenchyma and ten to twelve layers of spongy cells are present. Upper epidermis is uniseriate and formed only by epidermal cells proper; uniseriate lower epidermis exhibits these cells and stomata which are of the rubiaceous type, being formed by two guard cells and two subsidiary cells. Remarkable is the occurrence on the lower epidermis of certain structures called domatiae; the constancy of these structures on the lower epidermis of the leaves of Coffea and a few other rubiaceous genera has been considered an important taxonomic characteristic for genera identification. On the other hand, the domatia localization, shape, size and constitution, as well as the presence or absence of stomata on their outermost cell layer or the presence or absence of hairs on the borders of the domatia aperture, have shown to be important characteristics to be utilized in the differentiation of Coffea species and varieties. In Coffea arabica L. var. typica Cramer the,domatiae are localized at the very angle formed by the secondary veins with the mid-rib, have a vesicular shape and open externally through an elliptical or round pore which measures 200 - 260 microns in diameter; the borders of the pore are nearly glabrous, a few hairs appearing only in a region distant from the borders; very few stomata are also present on the outermost cell layer of the domatia. Stipule structure is similar to that of foliage blade, but no differentiation between palisade parenchyma and spongy cells is apparent. The inflorescence is of the homotatic type, the lateral axes being very short; consequently the flowers are disposed in axilar glomerules; bracteoles are in number of two pairs for each flower set, being respectively lanceolate and triangular, and presenting the same structure of the stipules. Calyx is very rudimentary; the sepals resemble the leaves anatomically, and present only a trace supply; the petals are united in a tube forming a salver-shaped corolla, presenting a single vascular trace each. Stamens are epipetalous and have also a single trace as vascular supply; the anthers are two-celled, opening lengthwise. At maturity each anther exhibits in cross section four pollen-sacs, surrounded by an uniseriate epidermis, two fiber layers and a narrow strip of tapetum vestiges. Microsporogenesis is reported to be normal by several authors. Pollen grains are numerous, globose, with a very thick, smooth, and 3 - 4 -sulcate exine. Pistil is represented by an inferior ovary, <b>terminal</b> <b>style</b> and two stigmatic branches. Ovary is normally two-celled, each one bearing a single anatropous ovule on a central placenta; funicle is very short, and the embryo-sac is of the normal type, monosporic, 8 -nucleate. Anatomically the ovary shows to be formed by uniseriate epidermes, the outer one presenting stomata; between the epidermes there is parenchymatous tissue, and distributed in this thick parenchyma there are 2 or 3 concentric vascular bundle series. The coffee fruit is a drupe, containing normally two seeds; exceptionally there is the occurrence of three or more seeds in the cases of tri-celled or pluri [...] celled ovaries, or through false polyembryony when bi-celled ovaries present more than one ovule in each cell. On the other hand, by abortion of an ovule one-seeded fruit may be formed (peaberry). Ripe fruits have a fleshy and thick pericarp. Fruit development brings about a series of chemical and morphological modifications that lead to a reduction in the thickness of pericarp, from 1. 5 mm in ripe fruits to 0. 4 in dried fruits. Exocarp is represented by a single layer of hardened and lignified cells, with scattered stomata. Mesocarp is formed by several layers of polyhedric, large and lignified cells, the innermost of which are somewhat compressed and flattened. Amidst these cells are visible the vascular bundles showing a great amount of fibers. Endocarp is about 100 microns thick and constitutes in the ripe fruits the so-called "seed parchment". Studied in cross section the endocarp shows to be formed by 5 - 6 layers of intercrossing strong fibers, what gives this zone of tissue an extraordinary strength. Maceration allows the detailed examination of the individual fibers which measure 350 - 370 microns in length by 20 - 45 microns in transverse diameter. The cell walls are very thick and provided with ramiform pits; cell lumen is almost occluded. The coffee seeds or coffee beans are elliptical or egg-shaped, plane-convex, possessing a longitudinal furrow on the plane surface. Seed coat is represented by the so-called "silver skin", which ontogenetically originates from the primine, the single ovule integument. This seed coat is about 70 microns thick and anatomically shows to be constituted by an outer layer of fibers somewhat similar to the endocarp fibers; they are, however, shorter, measuring the longest ones 180 - 320 microns in length and 18 - 30 microns in transverse diameter. Their thick walls are provided with round, elliptical, or elongated simple pits. The size of these fibers, the thickness and number of pits on their walls are considered by Chevalier as important taxonomic characteristics for the differentiation of Coffea species. Completing the silver skin structure there are several layers of amorphic parenchyma tissue, and a layer of indistinct cells which originate from the innermost cell layer of the primine. On the other hand, the fibers had their origin from the outermost cell layer of the primine. Endosperm is foimed by polyhedric cells of very thick cellulosic walls, functioning the cellulose in this case as food storage. With the aid of a special technique plasmodesmata can be detected in the primary-pit-fields of the endosperm cell walls. The endosperm tissue seems to present differences in the structure and chemical composition of its various layers; thus, at the level of the embryo cavity the cells are flattened and elongated constituting a region which probably désintégrâtes during embryo development. The outer layers represented by hard endosperm slough away as a cap that involves the cotyledons of seedlings obtained from completely naked seeds. This cap resembles the seed parchment in gross morphology. The inner layers are considered soft endosperm. As to the chemical composition, the endosperm cells besides Water, contains protein, the alkaloids caféine and coffearine, oil, sugar, dextrins, pentosans, cellulose, caffetannic acids, minerals, various acids and minor constituents. The small embryo, localized at the bottom of the seed, on its convex surface is represented by an hypocotyl and two adherent cordiform cotyledons. Very seldom there is the occurrence of embryo with 3 or 4 cotyledons...|$|E

(including Hydrophyllaceae s. str.), is part of a series of publications on the Boraginaceae in southern Africa.   Wellstedia comprises six species, five in Socotra, Somalia and Ethiopia with the remaining one.   W. dinteri Pilg [...] occurring in southern Africa.   W dinteri Pilg. subsp. dinteri occurs in Namibia and the Northern Cape, whereas the newly instated subspecies W. dinteri subsp. gracilior (D. R. Hunt) Retief & A. E. van Wyk, based on W. dinteri Pilg. var. gracilior D. R. Hunt, is confined to Namibia only. The disjunct distribution of Wellstedia and numerous other plant and animal taxa between the arid regions of northeastern Africa and southern Africa is usually explained by the postulated periodic existence of an arid corridor between the two regions during the arid phases of the Pleistocene and even earlier.   Wellstedia is treated here in Wellstedioideae, a subfamily of Boraginaceae s. I. but is sometimes placed in a family of its own, Wellstediaceae Pilger. Morphologically Wellstedia displays strong similarity to genera of the Ehretioideae and also to certain members of the Hydrophyllaceae.

40|$|The family Boraginaceae s. l., {{to which}} the genus Cordia belongs, {{comprises}} some 100 genera and includes ca. 2000 species (Willis, 1973; Cronquist, 1983) with {{a more or less}} cosmopolitan distribution. Bentham & Hooker (1876) divided the Boraginaceae in to four tribes based primarily on the characteristics of the style and ovary: (1) Cordieae (<b>style</b> <b>terminal,</b> four-branched with each arm terminating in a clavate or capitate stigma; ovary unlobed); (2) Ehretieae (<b>style</b> <b>terminal</b> or lateral, stigma 4 -lobed or bifid); (3) Heliotropieae (<b>style</b> <b>terminal</b> or lateral, stigma 4 -lobed, elongate with a subapical depression, ovary unlobed); (4) Borageae (style gynobasic, stigma truncate or capitate, ovary distinctly 4 -lobed). Subsequently, these tribes were elevated to the category of subfamily by Gürke (1897, in Engler & Prantl, Die Natürlichen Pflanzenfamilien) : (1) Cordioideae, (2) Ehretioideae: (3) Heliotropoideae and (4) Boraginoideae. This treatment of the family Boraginaceae was followed by Rendle (1925), Lawrence (1951) and Cronquist (1983). Hutchinson (1959), combined Cordioideae and Ehretioideae in a distinct (largely woody) family Ehretiaceae with the remaining subfamilies comprising the (largely herbaceous) Boraginaceae s. str. The treatment by Gürke (1897), however, has been more widely accepted, with the genus Cordia aligned with Patagonula and Auxema under the subfamily Cordioideae. The genus Cordia is particularly well represented in the large area of South America delimited by the Federal Republic of Brazil (some 65 species are recognised in the present revision, i. e. ca. one quarter {{of the total number of}} species in the whole genus). The treatment of Cordia by Fresenius (1857) for von Martius' Flora Brasiliensis was unfortunate in being based in large part on a rather infelicitous view of the genus by De Candolle (1845) so that although this has been the standard taxonomic work for Cordia in Brazil, it suffers from many deficiencies. Of great value are the taxonomic studies by Johnston (1930 - 1956) which provided lucid accounts of the infrageneric taxa and species limits (see sect. II for detailed discussion). However, these accounts by Johnston are based on regional areas and extended over a period of 2 S years during which this author changed his view of the taxonomy of generic, sectional and specific delimitations. The revision by Johnston (1930) consists the last treatment of the genus for part of Brazil, and thus there is no modern taxonomic account for Cordia for this country. It is this deficiency which the present study attempts to remedy. The present revision is restricted to the Brazilian species of Cordia, but a view of the genus as a whole, in particular the status of infrageneric categories has also been evaluated. Accompanying a formal revision based on external morphology, a palynological study of a number of species of the genus is provided, and also a discussion of the reproductive biology of some species, particularly with regard to the occurrence of heterostyly. The entire genus Cordia presents many interesting aspects such as its diverse morphological features of habit, inflorescence pattern, flowers and fruits; the reproductive biology with heterostyly presumably evolving towards dioecy in many species and perhaps a high level of polyploidy...|$|R

50|$|The {{sets were}} {{designed}} to operate with the high platforms, sharp curves, and narrow clearances of the Chicago Loop and the Chicago 'L', to run at speeds of 80 mph or more on the North Shore's main line, and to use city streets to the downtown Milwaukee <b>Terminal.</b> The sets' <b>styling</b> resembled that of the Pioneer Zephyr and influenced the styling of other electric trainsets, notably the Odakyū 3000 series SE Romance Cars. The articulated truck/bogie design allowed very smooth running {{with none of the}} horizontal movement characteristic of non-articulated equipment. Although they were streamlined, the sets were not permitted to run faster than conventional North Shore equipment. From the front passenger seat adjacent to the motorman's half cab, if the door was propped open, a passenger could see the speedometer pegged at 90 mph on the long stretch between Dempster Street and North Chicago Junction. When the sets were received in 1941, during one test run the traction motors were allowed full field shunt to determine absolute maximum speed. It reached just over 110 mph, but at that speed the train reached highway crossings before the crossing gates fully closed, a dangerous situation. Thereafter, the sets were limited to 90 mph.|$|R
5000|$|The Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Passenger Terminal is a {{historic}} train station in Mobile, Alabama, United States. Architect P. Thornton Marye designed the Mission Revival <b>style</b> <b>terminal</b> for the Mobile and Ohio Railroad. It was completed in 1907 at a total cost of $575,000. The Mobile and Ohio merged with the Gulf, Mobile and Northern Railroad in 1940 to form the Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad. Passenger service into the station was discontinued by the late 1950s after which all passenger trains in Mobile called at a nearby facility, Mobile station. The building continued to serve as railroad offices. It {{was placed on the}} National Register of Historic Places on August 15, 1975. It had suffered neglect, extensive interior alteration, and partial removal of the train shed by this time. The Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad vacated the old terminal building in 1986 and for fifteen years it suffered from demolition-by-neglect. The Alabama Historical Commission and the Alabama Trust for Historic Preservation named it as one of their [...] "Places in Peril" [...] in 1996. In 2001 the City of Mobile and a private company invested more than $18 million to restore the local landmark with the developer taking advantage of the Federal Historic Preservation Tax Incentive program. Today the building houses private offices and the city's Metro Transit Authority. The renovated facility was extensively damaged by flooding during Hurricane Katrina.|$|R
