25|$|Hand axes {{constitute}} an important group artefacts from the Acheulean. They {{are particularly important}} in open air archaeological sites (Keelley suggested that they are less common in cave sites.) Hand axes, chopping tools and <b>trihedral</b> picks are considered core utensils, which were commonly manufactured out of stones, blocks or rock nodules. However this grouping is problematic as these tools were often also fabricated from (large) flakes. Another common suggestion is to refer to flake tools as micro industry, {{as opposed to the}} more general size referred to as macro industry, which includes hand axes and cleavers. However, some scrapers are as big as hand axes.|$|E

30|$|In {{the above}} sections, we have {{translated}} the building layout reconstruction problem into the MST searching problem. With the edge weight defined as (1)[*]~[*](5) and the Kruskal algorithm, some simulations {{have been implemented}} and some valuable results are obtained. We have known that after the outmost <b>trihedrals</b> located on the outline which are called priori nodes are removed, the MST of the graph formed by the remaining nodes represents the interior layout of the building[19].|$|R
30|$|The {{problem of}} the {{one-time}} artificial judgment is that the reconstruction accuracy depends greatly on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of through-the-wall radar image. Once there exist interference targets or undetected wall-wall-floor <b>trihedrals,</b> the reconstructed layout will {{be different from the}} true layout. Therefore, some researchers propose an iterative reconstruction method based on electromagnetic scattering model[8, 12]. This method is formed by prediction stage and test stage. The prediction stage in the iterative procedure is the same as one-time reconstruction process. The predicted radar image can be obtained according to the predicted layout using electromagnetic modeling method. During the test stage, the measured radar image and the predicted radar image should be compared to modify the predicted building model, making a more accurate description of the building. Each iteration will add absent walls or cut out extra walls so as to be closer to the true layout of the building, comparing with the pre-iteration process. Then the positions of the wall-wall-floor <b>trihedrals</b> will be more accurate after compensation of the wall parameters[13]. To improve the computation efficiency of the iterative reconstruction method, prevent manual intervention during the reconstruction process and realize online computation, an effective building interior layout auto-reconstruction method need to be investigated.|$|R

A novel algorithm for calibrating the circular-transmit-and-linear-receive (CTLR) mode spaceborne compact polarimetric SAR using mixed calibrators is proposed, which is able to correct precisely both FR and radar system errors (i. e., channel imbalance and crosstalk). Six sets of mixed calibrators, consisting of both passive calibrators and polarimetric active radar calibrators (PARCs), are investigated. Theoretical analysis and simulations demonstrate that the optimal calibration scheme combines four polarimetric selective mixed calibrators, including two gridded <b>trihedrals</b> and two PARCs, together with total-electron-content measurements by the Global Navigation Satellite System system...|$|R

30|$|As is {{mentioned}} afore, in a radar measurement data set consisting of reflected signals from principal scatterers, {{we consider the}} wall-wall-floor <b>trihedrals</b> as the nodes of a graph, the horizontal or vertical wall lines being the edges joining the nodes. Any possible layout predicted according to present nodes corresponds a spanning tree of the weighted complete undirected graph BLG. If we have defined reasonable edge weight, we could make the total weight of the spanning tree corresponding to the correct interior layout to be minimum. By this way, we can translate the building interior layout reconstruction process into searching the MST of the complete weighted undirected graph. Therefore, how to construct the edge weight becomes the key of the reconstruction process.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} {{reconstruct}} the building interior layout from the through-the-wall radar image, this paper proposes a method based on minimum spanning tree (MST) which comes from the graph theory. The building layout graph (BLG) model is firstly established using the wall-wall-floor <b>trihedrals</b> inside the building. The vertex set and the edge set including the weight between any two nodes of the graph are defined afterwards. Then, the MST-based method is used {{to reconstruct the}} building interior layout. We have also improved the traditional method by applying the MST model with restricted conditions to solve the reconstruction problem when there exist interference targets in a building. The anechoic chamber measurements are carried out to demonstrate the suitability and efficacy of the MST-based method.|$|R
30|$|Without loss of generality, {{this paper}} focuses on common {{building}} designs with regularity and rectilinearity. The interior walls are either perpendicular or {{parallel to the}} exterior walls. In addition, any closed structure {{is not allowed to}} be existed if the exterior walls of the building are eliminated. The graph-based reconstruction method proposed in this paper comes from recent papers on the subject of floor plan estimation[14, 15]. They also employ graph theory in its problem formulation. This paper proposes a graph-theoretical building interior layout reconstruction method using the prototype of their method. However, the way that graphs are employed in this paper is different: the edges of the graph are used to indicate the walls that are present or absent, and the nodes are used to represent the wall-wall-floor <b>trihedrals</b> inside the building.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Spaceborne {{synthetic}} aperture radar (SAR) systems operating at lower frequencies, such as P-band, are significantly affected by Faraday rotation (FR) effects. This paper presents a novel algorithm for measuring system errors (channel imbalance and cross-talk) {{in the presence of}} Faraday rotation for spaceborne polarimetric SAR data. It uses four polarimetric selective calibrators (four polarimetric active radar calibrators [PARCs] or possibly two PARCs and two gridded <b>trihedrals).</b> Theoretical analysis and simulations demonstrate that the optimized calibration scheme puts tight constraints on the accuracy of the associated Faraday rotation if the cross-talk is to be accurately measured. There are also strong constraints on the allowable signal-to-noise ratio and average polarimetric noise associated with the calibration devices. The analysis suggests that, unless the calibration sites are at the magnetic equator, independent measurements of total electron content (TEC) from a direct ground-satellite line-of-sight dual-frequency system are also needed...|$|R

Shadows and extended features are analyzed in terms of point scatterers. Images of point scatterers are delta function peaks that are imaged as Gaussian peaks with the SAR impulse response function. Complex features and clusters in digital images may contain peaks and valleys at different scales. This paper describes two new peak detection algorithms for Gaussian peaks. The statistical performances of two new peak detection operators are analyzed theoretically. Analytic results are compared with truth in synthesized images with Gaussian peaks and truth in SAR images. The two operators estimate accurately the peak position, peak amplitude and peak width in both of synthesized and SAR images. Experimental results obtained by applying these two peak detectors are presented. 1 Introduction Point scatterers are important because of the physical properties of SAR imaging.

40|$|For {{spaceborne}} {{synthetic aperture}} radar (SAR) systems operating at L-band frequencies or lower, the ionosphere may {{have a significant impact}} on the SAR images. The largest effect at L-band is caused by Faraday rotation (FR). Several studies have modeled the effect of FR and/or devised models to measure and correct FR. With the launch of the fully polarimetric L-band system Phased Array-type L-band SAR (PALSAR), it has become possible to test both models and measurement techniques on real SAR data. In this letter, the quality of calibrated polarimetric PALSAR data is assessed, and FR is measured. It is found that residual crosstalk and channel imbalance are small in the PALSAR data. Two methods are used to measure FR, the first using in-scene distributed targets and the second using large <b>trihedrals.</b> The two methods show very good agreement. The measurements are compared with values of the total electron content using a linear model.

40|$|ABSTRACT [...] Results are {{presented}} for an experiment utilizing land calibration targets imaged by the NRL ultrawideband {{synthetic aperture radar}} (NUWSAR). Projection Pursuit statistical analysis tools were applied {{to a set of}} simultaneous L and X-band polarimetric images of dihedrals and <b>trihedrals</b> to determine optimal and minimal combinations of polarization and radar bands for identifying different scatterers. The normalized mutual information function (NMIF) was used as a quantitative optimization measure. It was calculated for a series of combinations of frequencies and polarizations, beginning with the maximum set of all six elements (HH, VV, and HV for each of X and L-bands), then continuing with successive elimination of single elements, then pairs, and so on. In principle, this will produce 6 ! (or 720) of such combinations. To illustrate the principle, only a subset of element combinations were eliminated, and {{it became clear that the}} NMIF decreases rapidly as one goes beyond 2 members. Results presented suggest that a 'spectral' display of these NMIF results correlates with scale size and shape of targets, and that different types of targets in the scene display a robust NMIF spectral signature. This leads one to hypothesize that such an approach may lead to NMIF library signatures for classification of natural and man made targets similar to the way optical hyperspectral library signatures are utilized, but using microwave radar band and polarization combinations instead...|$|R
40|$|The Ground-Based Synthetic Aperture Radar (GB-SAR) {{facility}} in the UK provides high-resolution, fully polarimetrically calibrated L- through X-band SAR imagery, principally of targets of remote sensing interest such as soils and vegetation. The facility consists of an indoor laboratory and a portable outdoor imaging system. Details of the polarimetric calibrations of both systems are discussed, with consideration given to the special requirements of field operation. Because {{of the need to}} mechanically scan the real antenna to build up a synthetic aperture, the SAR imaging process is significantly longer than its airborne and satellite counterparts. Some of the extended imaging schemes, such as those used in three-dimensional tomographic imaging and diurnal monitoring campaigns, can last from hours to days. However, calibration is normally only possible just prior to, and just after, imaging, leaving the data susceptible to nonlinear system sensitivity fluctuations during the imaging process itself. To address this problem, a novel scheme is discussed that utilizes the signal that arises from the imperfection in the rf isolation of the antenna head as a diagnostic to account for sensitivity fluctuations. Variations of several decibels were seen on a time scale of hours over an extended 2 day measurement. Excellent agreement was found with radar cross section (RCS) fluctuations retrieved from contemporaneous SAR imagery of reference <b>trihedrals</b> placed in the scene...|$|R
40|$|The {{measurement}} of scattered signals at W Band can be exploited to form images of small deformations with precisions {{in the order}} of tenths of micrometers. In this paper an Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar setup is proposed to form high resolution reflectivity images and deformation maps of dielectric or metallic surfaces. First, the system geometry of observation based on a linear motion of the radar antennas is described. A CW frequency domain measurement provides the wide band required for high resolution imaging. The scattered field data is focused on the surface spatial domain using a combination of range compression based on Inverse Fourier Transform combined with a backprojection algorithm to form the synthetic aperture with a high cross range resolution. The focusing performance has been assessed by numerical simulations and experimental measurements of simple scattering objects like spheres and <b>trihedrals.</b> Interferometric images of controlled displacements have been obtained showing a good agreement between real and measured displacements. A representative surface deformation test has been also carried out using a metallic rough surface. The interferometric phase difference between acquisitions can be used to image local deformations {{in the order of}} tens of micrometers from a range of several meters. Likewise the interferogram coherence shows the degree of decorrelation of the radar reflectivity which provides valuable information for surface random change assessment.
