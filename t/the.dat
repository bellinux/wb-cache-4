5|$|After journeying across <b>the</b> {{world to}} get <b>the</b> spirits, meeting <b>the</b> other {{two members of}} <b>the</b> party, thwarting <b>the</b> {{invasion}} attempts of Navarre and Altena, discovering <b>the</b> powers of <b>the</b> Fire and Water Mana Stones, and learning <b>the</b> disappearance of <b>the</b> Mana Stone of Darkness along <b>the</b> way, <b>the</b> main character tries to open <b>the</b> gate to <b>the</b> Mana Sanctuary with <b>the</b> spirits' assistance. <b>The</b> first attempt fails, but <b>the</b> second succeeds; <b>the</b> Faerie realizes that it was opened because someone else released <b>the</b> power from all <b>the</b> Mana Stones. <b>The</b> characters travel into <b>the</b> Sanctuary and <b>the</b> main character claims <b>the</b> Mana Sword. It is then discovered that <b>the</b> main character's adversaries—Koren and <b>the</b> Darkshine Knight for Angela and Duran; Jagan and Isabella for Lise and Hawk; or <b>the</b> Deathjester and a mind-controlled Heath, for Kevin and Charlotte—have defeated <b>the</b> other two sets of primary enemies. <b>The</b> remaining adversaries capture <b>the</b> Faerie and will only release her in exchange for <b>the</b> Mana Sword. <b>The</b> trade is made, and once <b>the</b> enemy receives <b>the</b> Sword, <b>the</b> Mana Stones shatter and <b>the</b> God Beasts are released.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> four-hour battle, <b>the</b> kibbutz fell. A {{dozen of}} <b>the</b> {{defenders}} escaped.

5|$|After <b>the</b> train {{departs from}} <b>the</b> station, it {{immediately}} begins to climb <b>the</b> vertical (90 degree) lift hill. Upon reaching <b>the</b> top of <b>the</b> lift, <b>the</b> train turns 45 degrees backwards putting <b>the</b> train and its riders in an upside down position. Then, as <b>the</b> train exits <b>the</b> lift, {{it goes through}} a heartline roll before going down <b>the</b> only drop in <b>the</b> layout of <b>the</b> roller coaster. <b>The</b> train speeds through <b>the</b> station going back up <b>the</b> lift. Once it loses momentum <b>the</b> train then returns down passing through <b>the</b> station again. It then proceeds back up <b>the</b> drop and partially into <b>the</b> heartline roll before once again losing momentum and returning to <b>the</b> ground. After passing <b>the</b> station for <b>the</b> third time, <b>the</b> train is stopped near <b>the</b> top of <b>the</b> lift hill. It is then lowered back down to <b>the</b> station where <b>the</b> next riders board <b>the</b> train. <b>The</b> XT 150 has <b>the</b> option of sending riders around a second cycle at <b>the</b> operator's discretion. When <b>the</b> train stops on <b>the</b> lift hill at <b>the</b> end of <b>the</b> ride, instead of lowering slowly back to <b>the</b> station, <b>the</b> chain will raise <b>the</b> car up and send it through <b>the</b> ride again.|$|E
5|$|Another {{concern of}} <b>the</b> chronicle was <b>the</b> {{acquisition}} of land by <b>the</b> abbey. <b>The</b> work incorporates three pre-existing inventories of <b>the</b> abbey's possessions, and records each gift to <b>the</b> abbey, giving <b>the</b> grantor and occasionally details of <b>the</b> grantor's life. This detailed record of <b>the</b> various rights and possessions of <b>the</b> abbey was useful if those possessions needed to be defended against outside or inside conflicts. <b>The</b> Liber was used by <b>the</b> monks to defend their claims to be <b>the</b> real heirs of <b>the</b> abbey's rights and property rather than <b>the</b> bishops, after <b>the</b> conversion of <b>the</b> abbey into a bishopric. <b>The</b> chronicle also records <b>the</b> division of property between <b>the</b> monks and <b>the</b> newly appointed bishop. According to <b>the</b> chronicler, <b>the</b> division took place during <b>the</b> episcopate of <b>the</b> first bishop, Hervey le Breton, and was characterised as barely adequate for <b>the</b> needs of <b>the</b> monks. Later <b>the</b> chronicle records documents from <b>the</b> bishops that defined <b>the</b> separation between <b>the</b> monks and <b>the</b> episcopate. <b>The</b> chronicle also records <b>the</b> conflict between <b>the</b> abbey and various Bishops of Lincoln, which had continued until <b>the</b> abbey became a bishopric in 1109.|$|E

5|$|Before <b>the</b> {{reign of}} Henry VIII, <b>the</b> {{sovereign}} always granted {{his or her}} assent in person. <b>The</b> sovereign, wearing <b>the</b> Imperial State Crown, would be seated on <b>the</b> throne in <b>the</b> Lords chamber, surrounded by heralds and members of <b>the</b> royal court—a scene that nowadays is repeated only at <b>the</b> annual State Opening of Parliament. <b>The</b> Commons, led by their speaker, would listen from <b>the</b> Bar of <b>the</b> Lords, just outside <b>the</b> chamber. <b>The</b> Clerk of <b>the</b> Parliaments presented <b>the</b> bills awaiting assent to <b>the</b> monarch, save that supply bills were traditionally brought up by <b>the</b> speaker. <b>The</b> Clerk of <b>the</b> Crown, standing on <b>the</b> sovereign's right, then read aloud <b>the</b> titles of <b>the</b> bills (in earlier times, <b>the</b> entire text of <b>the</b> bills). <b>The</b> Clerk of <b>the</b> Parliaments, standing on <b>the</b> sovereign's left, responded by stating <b>the</b> appropriate Norman French formula.|$|E
5|$|Biblical {{scenes and}} figures {{depicted}} in <b>the</b> Church of <b>the</b> Holy Mother of God include <b>the</b> worshiping of <b>the</b> Christ child as <b>the</b> eucharistic victim (<b>the</b> Melismos) in <b>the</b> {{lower part of}} <b>the</b> apse, <b>the</b> raising of Lazarus, <b>the</b> Annunciation, Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem, Judas Iscariot's betrayal of Jesus, <b>the</b> Passion of <b>the</b> Christ in <b>the</b> upper part of <b>the</b> cella, <b>the</b> Descent from <b>the</b> Cross, <b>the</b> mourning of Jesus, and <b>the</b> Dormition of <b>the</b> Theotokos on <b>the</b> west wall. <b>The</b> north and south walls of <b>the</b> cella, as well as <b>the</b> wall piers, bear frescoes of saints, including rare images of military saints on horseback.

5|$|By <b>the</b> end of <b>the</b> 5th century <b>the</b> western {{section of}} <b>the</b> empire {{was divided into}} smaller {{political}} units, ruled by <b>the</b> tribes that had invaded in <b>the</b> early part of <b>the</b> century. <b>The</b> deposition of <b>the</b> last emperor of <b>the</b> west, Romulus Augustulus, in 476 has traditionally marked <b>the</b> end of <b>the</b> Western Roman Empire.

5|$|For system {{efficacy}} and reliability, aircraft transmissions made {{in response to}} a signal from a satellite are sent in timed slots referenced to <b>the</b> time <b>the</b> signal from <b>the</b> satellite arrived, using <b>the</b> slotted ALOHA protocol. <b>The</b> time that <b>the</b> signal is sent from <b>the</b> ground station begins <b>the</b> time slot. <b>The</b> burst timing offset (BTO) is <b>the</b> time difference between <b>the</b> start of <b>the</b> time slot and <b>the</b> start of <b>the</b> transmission received from <b>the</b> aircraft; it equals twice <b>the</b> distance (for <b>the</b> ground station's signal then aircraft's response) from <b>the</b> ground station to <b>the</b> satellite to <b>the</b> aircraft plus <b>the</b> time <b>the</b> aircraft's SDU takes between receiving <b>the</b> signal and responding (<b>the</b> SDU bias) and <b>the</b> delay between <b>the</b> time <b>the</b> signal arrives at <b>the</b> ground station and <b>the</b> time it is processed (when <b>the</b> BTO value is logged; <b>the</b> ground station bias). <b>The</b> satellite's location is known, thus <b>the</b> distance from <b>the</b> satellite to <b>the</b> ground station can be calculated, while <b>the</b> combined bias of <b>the</b> SDU and ground station is relatively constant and can be calculated from signals exchanged earlier in <b>the</b> flight while it was on <b>the</b> ground at KLIA, thus leaving <b>the</b> distance between <b>the</b> aircraft and satellite as <b>the</b> only variable.|$|E
5|$|In 1895, Queen's University was <b>the</b> first {{official}} challenger for <b>the</b> Cup, {{although it was}} controversial. <b>The</b> Montreal Victorias had won <b>the</b> league title and thus <b>the</b> Stanley Cup, but <b>the</b> challenge match was between <b>the</b> previous year's champion, Montreal HC, and <b>the</b> university squad. <b>The</b> trustees decided that if <b>the</b> Montreal HC won <b>the</b> challenge match, <b>the</b> Victorias would become <b>the</b> Stanley Cup champions. <b>The</b> Montreal HC won <b>the</b> match 5–1 and their cross-town rivals were crowned <b>the</b> champions. <b>The</b> first successful challenge to <b>the</b> Cup came <b>the</b> next year by <b>the</b> Winnipeg Victorias, <b>the</b> champions of <b>the</b> Manitoba Hockey League.

5|$|In StarCraft, <b>the</b> Zerg are {{obsessed with}} <b>the</b> pursuit of genetic purity, and are <b>the</b> focus of <b>the</b> game's second episode.

5|$|In {{addition}} to <b>the</b> images and local elements applied in design, <b>the</b> capacity of <b>the</b> buildings, <b>the</b> nature of <b>the</b> space, <b>the</b> potential of <b>the</b> neighboring districts, <b>the</b> convenience of <b>the</b> traffic square, and <b>the</b> contrast of {{vertical and horizontal}} volumes of <b>the</b> buildings that constitute <b>the</b> skyline are all considered. <b>The</b> horizontal volume of <b>the</b> station is due to <b>the</b> conditions of <b>the</b> site, <b>the</b> functions, and development regulations.

5|$|In <b>the</b> {{early years}} of <b>the</b> cemetery's operation, <b>the</b> {{locomotives}} hauling <b>the</b> funeral trains from Waterloo would not travel down <b>the</b> branch into <b>the</b> cemetery, as it would leave <b>the</b> engine at <b>the</b> wrong end of <b>the</b> train for <b>the</b> return journey.

5|$|Near <b>the</b> hinge of <b>the</b> {{shell is}} <b>the</b> umbo, often a rounded, knob-like {{protuberance}} usually surrounding <b>the</b> beak. <b>The</b> umbo generally and <b>the</b> beak specifically represent <b>the</b> oldest portion of <b>the</b> shell, with extra material gradually being laid down along <b>the</b> margins on <b>the</b> opposite sides. <b>The</b> hinge point or line is <b>the</b> dorsal region of <b>the</b> shell, and <b>the</b> lower, curved margin is <b>the</b> ventral region. <b>The</b> anterior or front of <b>the</b> shell is where <b>the</b> byssus (when present) and foot are located, and <b>the</b> posterior of <b>the</b> shell is where <b>the</b> siphons are located. With <b>the</b> umbones/ hinge uppermost and with <b>the</b> anterior edge of <b>the</b> animal towards <b>the</b> viewer's left, <b>the</b> valve facing <b>the</b> viewer is <b>the</b> left valve and <b>the</b> opposing valve <b>the</b> right.|$|E
5|$|On M1, <b>the</b> anterocone (<b>the</b> cusp at <b>the</b> {{front of}} <b>the</b> tooth) is not divided into smaller cuspules. <b>The</b> {{connection}} between <b>the</b> protocone and <b>the</b> paracone, <b>the</b> major cusps immediately after <b>the</b> anterocone, is located relatively far toward <b>the</b> front. Behind <b>the</b> paracone, <b>the</b> mesoloph accessory crest is present. On M2, {{there is no}} protoflexus (an indentation in front of <b>the</b> protocone, which on this tooth is <b>the</b> frontmost cusp) and <b>the</b> valley between <b>the</b> paracone and <b>the</b> mesoloph, <b>the</b> mesoflexus, is not divided into two pieces by a paracone–mesoloph connection. These traits are both characteristic of <b>the</b> Nectomys subclade. <b>The</b> mesoloph is present on M3, but <b>the</b> posteroloph, a crest at <b>the</b> back of <b>the</b> tooth, is absent or vestigial, as is <b>the</b> hypoflexus (<b>the</b> valley between <b>the</b> protocone and <b>the</b> cusp behind it, <b>the</b> hypocone). <b>The</b> absence or near-absence of <b>the</b> posteroloph is a distinctive trait that differentiates Pennatomys from related oryzomyines.|$|E
5|$|One torque {{generated}} by a tire, called <b>the</b> self aligning torque, is caused by asymmetries in <b>the</b> side-slip along <b>the</b> length of <b>the</b> contact patch. <b>The</b> resultant force of this side-slip occurs behind <b>the</b> geometric center of <b>the</b> contact patch, a distance described as <b>the</b> pneumatic trail, and so creates a torque on <b>the</b> tire. Since <b>the</b> direction of <b>the</b> side-slip is towards <b>the</b> outside of <b>the</b> turn, <b>the</b> force on <b>the</b> tire is towards <b>the</b> center of <b>the</b> turn. Therefore, this torque tends to turn <b>the</b> front wheel in <b>the</b> direction of <b>the</b> side-slip, away from <b>the</b> direction of <b>the</b> turn, and therefore tends to increase <b>the</b> radius of <b>the</b> turn.|$|E
5|$|Over <b>the</b> {{course of}} <b>the</b> year {{different}} sections of <b>the</b> rod serve as <b>the</b> style, which is <b>the</b> part of <b>the</b> gnomon that indicates <b>the</b> time by casting its shadow on <b>the</b> dial face. At <b>the</b> summer solstice, when <b>the</b> Sun is highest (farthest above <b>the</b> equatorial plane), <b>the</b> style {{is closest to}} <b>the</b> top of <b>the</b> rod, and at <b>the</b> winter solstice, when <b>the</b> Sun is lowest, it is closest to <b>the</b> bottom. At <b>the</b> equinoxes, when <b>the</b> Sun is on <b>the</b> equatorial plane, <b>the</b> style is exactly in <b>the</b> center of <b>the</b> length of <b>the</b> rod. <b>The</b> style of <b>the</b> equatorial sundial is parallel to <b>the</b> Earth's axis of rotation.|$|E
5|$|Point 343 {{was held}} through <b>the</b> 18th, however, though with <b>the</b> loss of 63 men; by <b>the</b> evening, {{a force of}} tanks had managed {{to come up and}} {{stabilise}} <b>the</b> position with <b>the</b> aid of artillery support. <b>The</b> 4th/11th Sikh Regiment moved around <b>the</b> Gurkhas to <b>the</b> north, covering <b>the</b> northern flank of <b>the</b> San Marino heights, and <b>the</b> division's 11th Brigade passed through them to help encircle <b>the</b> city. On <b>the</b> evening of <b>the</b> 19th, <b>the</b> 2nd Battalion, Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders of 11th Indian Infantry Brigade began to push into <b>the</b> outskirts of <b>the</b> city from <b>the</b> north, but early on <b>the</b> morning of <b>the</b> 20th were held back by defensive positions in <b>the</b> north-west of <b>the</b> city, where <b>the</b> road to <b>the</b> upper part of <b>the</b> city, situated higher on <b>the</b> mountain, began. Tanks moved into <b>the</b> suburbs, whilst a company of <b>the</b> Camerons moved uphill toward <b>the</b> summit in heavy rain. <b>The</b> city was secured by <b>the</b> early afternoon, with only 24 casualties among <b>the</b> attackers, and 54 prisoners taken.|$|E
5|$|Prior to <b>the</b> bomb run <b>the</b> {{pilot was}} {{directed}} to fly <b>the</b> aircraft in several different directions in sequence, preferably about 120 degrees apart. On each leg, <b>the</b> bomb aimer used <b>the</b> reticle to measure <b>the</b> drift angle, either by rotating <b>the</b> wind direction dial on <b>the</b> computor to get <b>the</b> sight head to <b>the</b> right angle, or by unlocking <b>the</b> azimuth control from <b>the</b> computor and turning <b>the</b> sight manually. <b>The</b> drift angle was whatever angle <b>the</b> sight head was pointing when objects on <b>the</b> ground could {{be seen to be}} moving along <b>the</b> line on <b>the</b> sight. Once measured, <b>the</b> angle of <b>the</b> aircraft and <b>the</b> angle of <b>the</b> drift (measured either from <b>the</b> dial on <b>the</b> computor or <b>the</b> scale on <b>the</b> sight) were recorded. Using <b>the</b> Mk. III Navigation Computor, <b>the</b> RAF's version of <b>the</b> modern E6B, <b>the</b> three sets of angles were entered on <b>the</b> wind calculator face. This normally resulted in a small triangular area forming where <b>the</b> three lines came close to meeting, and <b>the</b> centre of this triangle revealed <b>the</b> wind speed and direction. This value was then entered into <b>the</b> computor.|$|E
5|$|Rhodes, its skyline {{dominated}} by <b>the</b> massive statue, <b>the</b> Colossus of Rhodes, is a war-torn city under assault by Kratos, <b>the</b> God of War, and his Spartan army. <b>The</b> Lair of Typhon, hidden in an unknown location, is a snow-topped mountain and prison of <b>the</b> Titans Typhon and Prometheus. <b>The</b> Island of Creation {{is a vast}} island located at <b>the</b> edge of <b>the</b> world and home to <b>the</b> Sisters of Fate. <b>The</b> island is host to deadly traps, puzzles, and monsters. On <b>the</b> outskirts of <b>the</b> island are <b>the</b> Steeds of Time, and on <b>the</b> island itself are <b>the</b> Temples of Lakhesis and Atropos, and <b>the</b> Bog of <b>the</b> Forgotten, which hides <b>the</b> Gorgon Euryale and is <b>the</b> site of Jason of <b>the</b> Argonauts' last battle. Beyond <b>the</b> Bog are <b>the</b> Lowlands and <b>the</b> Great Chasm: a huge divide that blocks <b>the</b> way to <b>the</b> Palace of <b>the</b> Fates. At <b>the</b> base of <b>the</b> Chasm is <b>the</b> realm of Tartarus—prison of <b>the</b> Titan Atlas, condemned to hold <b>the</b> world on his shoulders. <b>The</b> Temple of <b>the</b> Fates is also filled with traps and monsters, while <b>the</b> final battle occurs on Mount Olympus, home to <b>the</b> gods.|$|E
5|$|Several windows {{maintain}} their original shape and size. <b>The</b> original stained-glass decorations were almost all lost in <b>the</b> 1702 fire and were simply replaced by normal glass. <b>The</b> current stained-glass designs were added during <b>the</b> renovation at <b>the</b> end of <b>the</b> 19th century, {{most of them}} by <b>the</b> Gothenburg firm, Svenska Glasmåleri. <b>The</b> large windows above <b>the</b> portals depict <b>the</b> Trinity: God <b>the</b> Father over <b>the</b> west door, God <b>the</b> Son above <b>the</b> south door (<b>the</b> largest in <b>the</b> church), and God <b>the</b> Holy Spirit above <b>the</b> north door. Crafted in limestone, <b>the</b> rose window at <b>the</b> north portal is <b>the</b> oldest, unchanged since <b>the</b> 13th century.|$|E
