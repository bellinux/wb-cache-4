We find that <b>the</b> <b>low</b> <b>common</b> input regime {{is governed by}} firing rate dependent spike correlations which {{are sensitive to the}} detailed structure of input correlation functions.

All predictions are confirmed in in vitro experiments with cortical neurons driven by synthesized fluctuating input currents. Comment: 5 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{algorithm}} for solving <b>the</b> all-pairs <b>lowest</b> <b>common</b> ancestor problem in directed acyclic graphs (dags). Our algorithm runs in time O(n 2 +λ), where λ satisfies the equation ω(1, λ, 1) = 1 + 2 λ and ω(1, λ, 1) is the exponent of the multiplication of an n × n λ matrix by an n λ × n matrix. By the currently best bounds on ω(1, λ, 1), the running {{time of our}} algorithm is O(n 2. 575). Our algorithm improves upon the recent O(n 2. 616) -time algorithm by Kowaluk and Lingas (ICALP’ 2005) and the previous O(n 2. 688) -time algorithm by Bender et al. (SODA’ 2001). Our result is obtained by using a close relationship between <b>the</b> all-pairs <b>lowest</b> <b>common</b> ancestor problem in dags {{and the problem of}} computing the maximum witnesses of Boolean matrix, as well as fast Boolean multiplications of rectangular matrices. We precise the relationship by completing the proof of O(n ω) -time equivalence between <b>the</b> all-pairs <b>lowest</b> <b>common</b> ancestor problem and the problem of computing maximum witnesses of Boolean matrix product, where ω = ω(1, 1, 1) n α, the running time of our algorithm is at most O(n ω ·h 0. 468).

This was a novel strategy in British politics, and was conceived as a way of reaching the electorate while bypassing the mass media. The packaging of the videocassette did not specify that it was produced by the Referendum Party but rather carried several slogans: [...] "The most important video you'll ever watch", [...] "The story the politicians don't want you to hear", and [...] "If you care about Britain, please pass this video on."

500|$|According to {{academic}} Rikky Rooksby, [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] {{is an example}} of Brian Wilson's growing interest in musical development within a composition, something antithetical to popular music of the time.

It instead develops [...] "under its own power" [...] and [...] "luxuriates in harmonic variety" [...] exemplified by beginning and ending not only in different keys but also in different modes. Comparing [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] to Wilson's previous work Pet Sounds, biographer Andrew Hickey has said: [...] "he best way of thinking about [...] is that it's taking <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>common</b> denominator of 'Here Today' and 'God Only Knows' and turned the result into an R track. We have the same minor-key change between verse and chorus we've seen throughout Pet Sounds, the same descending scalar chord sequences, the same mobile bass parts, but here, rather than to express melancholy, these things are used in a way that's as close as Brian Wilson ever got to funky."

New York Times Magazines Saul Austerlitz called poptimism a product of click-driven internet journalism that aspired to <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>common</b> denominator while being actively hostile to people who are fans of genres and bands associated with rockism. He further criticized it for allowing pop music fans to avoid expanding their taste and contrasted the types of music lauded by poptimists with the literature and film praised by book and film critics. Loss agreed with Austerlitz's text: [...] "When [...] wrote that '(m)usic criticism's former priority—telling consumers what to purchase—has been rendered null and void for most fans. In its stead, I believe, many critics have become cheerleaders for pop stars,' I imagined an editor and a record label exec swooping down on him saying, [...] "Don't tell them that!" [...] We like to believe criticism is devoid of crass commercialism, but Austerlitz gives away that it never was in the first place."
