5000|$|Nociceptors are sensory receptors that {{respond to}} {{potentially}} damaging stimuli by sending nerve {{signals to the}} brain. Although these neurons in invertebrates may have different pathways and relationships to {{the central nervous system}} than mammalian nociceptors, nociceptive neurons in invertebrates often fire in response to similar stimuli as mammals, such as high temperature (40 C or more), low pH, capsaicin, and tissue damage. The first invertebrate in which a nociceptive cell was identified was the medicinal leech, Hirudo medicinalis, which has the characteristic segmented body of an Annelida, each segment possessing a ganglion containing the T (<b>touch),</b> <b>P</b> (pressure) and N (noxious) cells. Later studies on the responses of leech neurones to mechanical, chemical and thermal stimulation motivated researchers to write [...] "These properties are typical of mammalian polymodal nociceptors".|$|E

40|$|The {{cortical}} {{areas that}} represent affectively {{positive and negative}} aspects of touch were investigated using {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) by comparing activations produced by pleasant touch, painful touch produced by a stylus, and neutral touch, to the left hand. It was found that regions of the orbitofrontal cortex were activated more by pleasant touch and by painful stimuli than by neutral touch and that different areas of the orbitofrontal cortex were activated by the pleasant and painful touches. The orbitofrontal cortex activation was related to the affective aspects of the touch, in that the somatosensory cortex (SI) was less activated by the pleasant and painful stimuli than by the neutral stimuli. This dissociation was highly significant for both the pleasant <b>touch</b> (<b>P</b> < 0. 006) and for the painful stimulus (P < 0. 02). Further, it was found that a rostral part of the anterior cingulate cortex was activated by the pleasant stimulus and that a more posterior and dorsal part was activated by the painful stimulus. Regions of the somatosensory cortex, including SI and part of SII in the mid-insula, were activated more by the neutral touch than by the pleasant and painful stimuli. Part of the posterior insula was activated only in the pain condition and different parts of the brainstem, including the central grey, were activated in the pain, pleasant and neutral touch conditions. The results provide evidence that different areas of the human orbitofrontal cortex are involved in representing both pleasant touch and pain, and that dissociable parts of the cingulate cortex are involved in representing pleasant touch and pain...|$|E

40|$|For {{many animals}} {{processing}} of tactile information {{is a crucial}} task in behavioral contexts like exploration, foraging and stimulus avoidance. The leech, having infrequent access to food, developed an energy efficient reaction to tactile stimuli, avoiding unnecessary muscle movements: The local bend behavior moves {{only a small part}} of the body wall away from an object touching the skin, while the rest of the animal remains stationary. Amazingly, the precision of this localized behavioral response is similar to the spatial discrimination threshold of the human fingertip, although the leech skin is innervated by an order of magnitude fewer mechanoreceptors and each midbody ganglion contains only 400 individually identified neurons in total. Prior studies suggested that this behavior is controlled by a three-layered feed-forward network, consisting of four mechanoreceptors (P cells), approximately 20 interneurons and 10 individually characterized motor neurons, all of which encode tactile stimulus location by overlapping, symmetrical tuning curves. Additionally, encoding of mechanical force was attributed to three types of mechanoreceptors reacting to distinct intensity ranges: T cells for <b>touch,</b> <b>P</b> cells for pressure and N cells for strong, noxious skin stimulation. In this study, we provide evidences that tactile stimulus encoding in the leech is more complex than previously thought. Combined electrophysiological, anatomical and voltage sensitive dye approaches indicate that P and T cells both play a major role in tactile information processing resulting in local bending. Our results indicate that tactile encoding neither relies on distinct force intensity ranges of different cell types, nor location encoding is restricted to spike count tuning. Instead, we propose that P and T cells form a mixed type population, which simultaneously employs temporal response features and spike counts for multiplexed encoding of touch location and force intensity. This hypothesis is supported by our finding that previously identified local bend interneurons receive input from both P and T cells. Some of these interneurons seem to integrate mechanoreceptor inputs, while others appear to use temporal response cues, presumably acting as coincidence detectors. Further voltage sensitive dye studies can test these hypotheses how a tiny nervous system performs highly precise stimulus processing...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground: The overexcitation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate {{receptor}} complex {{appears to}} {{play a critical role}} in the development of neuropathic pain, and ketamine acts as an antagonist to that receptor. Some publications have reported on the prominent relief of neuropathic pain with intravenous or subcutaneous ketamine infusions or a single-dose intravenous ketamine injection despite adverse effects. Objectives: The primary objective of this study was to determine the analgesic effect of intravenous ketamine infusion therapy for neuropathic pain refractory to conventional treatments. Secondary objectives included identifying the variables related to the analgesic effect and the pain descriptors susceptible to ketamine infusion. Methods: This 2 -week, open-label, uncontrolled study was conducted in Korean patients with neuropathic pain recruited from the Samsung Seoul Hospital (Seoul, Republic of Korea) outpatient pain management unit. Patients were required to have a pain severity score > 5 (visual analog scale [VAS], where 0 = no pain and 10 = worst pain imaginable) over a period of ≥ 1 month while on standard treatment. The patients were required to have shown no benefit from standard treatment and no pain relief lasting over 1 month. The ketamine infusion therapy was composed of 3 sessions performed consecutively every other day. Midazolam was administered concomitantly to reduce the occurrence of central nervous system-related adverse events (AEs) secondary to ketamine. Each session was as follows: ketamine 0. 2 mg/kg and midazolam 0. 1 mg/kg were administered intravenously for 5 minutes as a loading dose, followed by a continuous infusion of ketamine 0. 5 mg/kg/h and midazolam 0. 025 mg/kg/h for 2 hours. AEs were assessed in the following ways: close monitoring of ECG, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and evaluating the need for treatment of AEs during infu- sion and until discharge by an attending anesthesiologist; an open question about discomfort at the end of each session; spontaneous reports about AEs during each session; and the patients' and caregivers' checklist of AEs occurring at home for 2 weeks after discharge. All the descriptors of pain expressed by the patients in Korean were recorded and translated into appropriate English terminology on the basis of the literature on Korean verbal descriptors of pain. Each of the translated pain descriptors was then classified into 1 of 18 sensory items. Results: The overall VAS score for pain decreased from a baseline mean (SD) of 7. 20 (1. 77) to 5. 46 (2. 29) (P < 0. 001) 2 weeks after treatment in 103 patients (53 males and 50 females; mean age, 52. 56 [17. 33] years) who completed the study. Variables such as age, sex, and the duration and diagnosis of pain were not found to be associated with analgesic effect. Seven of the 18 pain descriptors were found to have a significant response to ketamine infusion treatment between baseline and 2 weeks follow-up: burning pain (P = 0. 008); dull, aching pain (P < 0. 001); overly sensitive to <b>touch</b> (<b>P</b> = 0. 002); stabbing pain (P = 0. 008); electric pain (P = 0. 031); tingling pain (P < 0. 001); and squeezing pain (P < 0. 001). A total of 52 patients reported AEs: 33 during infusion and 44 during recovery and up to 2 weeks follow up. The most commonly reported AEs were snoring (15 [15 %]) during infusion and dizziness (43 [42 %]) during recovery. Conclusions: Ketamine infusion therapy was associated with reduced severity of neuropathic pain and generally well tolerated for up to 2 weeks in these patients with neuropathic pain refractory to standard treatment. Variables such as sex, age, and the diagnosis and duration of pain had no association with the analgesic effect of this treatment. Randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of treatment with ketamine infusion...|$|E

Median (IQR [range]) block height for touch, pinprick, first cold and icy were: T 10 (T 7 –T 12 [T 3 –L 1]); T 5 (T 4 –T 6 [C 7 –L 1]); T 5 (T 4 –T 6 [C 7 –L 1]); and T 3 (T 2 –T 4 [C 7 –L 1]), respectively. Modalities were significantly correlated for: <b>touch</b> and cold, <b>p</b> = 0. 0001; <b>touch</b> and icy, <b>p</b> = 0. 0007; <b>touch</b> and pinprick, <b>p</b> = 0. 0018; cold and icy, p < 0. 0001; cold and pinprick, p = 0. 0001; icy and pinprick, p < 0. 0001.

This indirect effect on a pig’s growth is represented as social breeding value(SBV) in a newly developed breeding model. It has been hypothesized that pigs could affecttheir pen mates’ growth through their behavior. We investigated whether pigs selectedfor a relatively positive (+SBV) or negative genetic effect (-SBV) on the growth of theirpen mates and kept in either barren or straw-enriched pens differ in fearfulness. Effectsof coping style, as assessed in a backtest, and gender were also investigated. Pigs (n = 480) were subjected to a group-wise novel rope test and human approach test and individuallyto a novel environment test in which after 5 min a bucket was lowered from the ceiling. In the novel rope test +SBV pigs were faster than -SBV pigs to <b>touch</b> a rope (<b>P</b> < 0. 01) andin the novel environment test +SBV pigs showed less locomotion than -SBV pigs afterintroduction of the bucket (P < 0. 05).

Straw-enriched pigs also hadlower salivary cortisol concentrations than barren housed pigs (P < 0. 001). Pigs classifiedas high-resisting in the backtest spent more time near the person in the human approachtest (P < 0. 10) and showed more locomotion (P < 0. 10) and vocalizations (P < 0. 001) afterintroduction of the bucket in the novel environment test than low-resisting pigs.

DESIGN: The study group consisted of 150 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of conjunctival melanoma. The clinical parameters of the patient, tumor, and treatment were analyzed in a nonrandomized fashion for their relation to 4 main outcome measures using Cox proportional hazards regression models. RESULTS: The Kaplan-Meier estimate of local tumor recurrence was 26 % at 5 years, 51 % at 10 years, and 65 % at 15 years. The mean number of recurrences per patient was 1 (median, 0). Ninety-eight patients (65 %) had no recurrences, 28 patients (19 %) had 1, 11 patients (7 %) had 2, 5 patients (3 %) had 3, and 8 patients (5 %) had 4 or more recurrences. According to multivariate analysis, the factors that predicted local tumor recurrence were {{the location of the}} melanoma (not <b>touching</b> the limbus) (<b>P</b> =. 01) and tumor-margin pathology (lateral margin involved) (P =. 02). Multivariate analysis for features predictive of ultimate exenteration included initial visual acuity (20 / 40 or worse) (P =. 0007), melanoma color (red) (P =. 01), and melanoma location (not <b>touching</b> the limbus) (<b>P</b> =. 02). Tumor metastasis occurred in 16 % of patients at 5 years, 26 % at 10 years, and 32 % at 15 years. Metastasis was initially in the regional lymph nodes in 17 cases, brain in 4, liver in 3, lung in 2, and disseminated in 1 case. Risks for metastases with use of multivariate analysis included tumor-margin pathology (lateral margin involved) (P =. 002) and melanoma location (not <b>touching</b> limbus) (<b>P</b> =. 04). Tumor-related death occurred in 7 % of patients at 5 years and 13 % at 8 years. Risk factors for death with use of multivariate analysis included initial symptoms (lump) (P =. 004) and pathologic findings (de novo melanoma without primary acquired melanosis) (P =. 05). In a series of univariate analyses, the technique of initial surgery was shown to be an important factor in preventing eventual tumor recurrence (P =. 07), metastasis (P =. 03), and death (P =. 006). Patients who were managed with excisional biopsy using the "no-touch technique" plus alcohol corneal epitheliectomy and supplemental cryotherapy fared far better than those treated with excisional biopsy alone. In addition, the surgical technique used before referral to us was critical. Those patients who had an incisional diagnostic biopsy prior to referral were at risk for more than 1 recurrence (P =. 04), and those who had excisional biopsy alone without supplemental cryotherapy were at risk for eventual exenteration (P =. 0006) and death (P =. 04). CONCLUSIONS: Conjunctival malignant melanoma is a potentially deadly tumor. In this study, metastasis was detected in 26 % of patients and death occurs in 13 % at 10 years. The surgical technique of tumor management was found to be possibly related to tumor metastases and death. Meticulous surgical planning, use of wide microsurgical excisional biopsy with the no-touch technique, and supplemental alcohol corneal epitheliectomy and conjunctival cryotherapy performed by experienced surgeons are advised.

Since 2006, an inhouse adhesive tape {{has been used}} in casework at the Swedish National Forensic Centre, Linkoping. Although this tape gives good DNA yields, we aim to replace it with a commercial tape to save cost and labour. In order to enable a fair comparison between different adhesive tapes, we have developed and evaluated a method for production of relevant reference material. One person, known to be a good shedder, wore identical long-sleeved T-shirts under controlled circumstances, and trace recovery was systematically performed with the in-house tape (3 T-shirts, total of 24 samples). Each sample was DNA extracted and quantified to find the normal variation within the reference material. The DNA recovery differed considerably between samples, with DNA concentrations between 0. 010 - 0. 48 ng/mu L (mean: 0. 083, SD: 0. 12 ng/mu L). Applying such a reference material for comparison between two commercial tapes and our in-house tape resulted in mean DNA recoveries plus/minus one standard deviation of 0. 013 +/- 0. 006 ng/mL (Scenesafe FAST Box), 0. 012 +/- 0. 007 ng/mu L (Touch tape), and 0. 023 +/- 0. 013 ng/mu L (inhouse tape).

Forty-four women received intracervical anesthesia with 10 mL of 2 % prilocaine hydrochloride solution injected at two sites (3 : 00 and 9 : 00 positions) and underwent traditional hysteroscopy. Hysteroscopy was performed using a rigid 3. 7 -mm hysteroscope and a medium of 0. 9 % saline. The image was transmitted to a screen visible to the patient. A visual analog scale (VAS) consisting of a 10 -cm line was used to assess the intensity of pain experienced during and after the procedure. Satisfaction was assessed by VAS at three different times during the procedure (Stage I: insertion of speculum, tenaculum placement, intracervical block for the traditional hysteroscopy group and insertion of hysteroscope into the vagina, vaginoscopy for the no touch method, Stage II: passage through internal cervical os, Stage III: observation of the uterine cavity and Stage IV: 15 minutes later, after hysteroscopy). Results: The mean pain score was significantly lower at Stage I in the no <b>touch</b> group (<b>p</b> 0. 05). Conclusion: Patients reported significantly less pain with no touch method at the vaginoscopy compared with patients undergoing the traditional procedure with tenaculum placement and intracervical anesthesia. Both of the methods have had similar pain scores {{during the rest of the}} procedures and 15 minutes after the procedure with comparable failure rates. No touch method can therefore be considered as a useful hysteroscopic technique...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this experiment {{was to determine if}} nursery pig age affected how many pigs touched and orientated to a human, or were classified as not-orientated during a human-animal interaction test using live human observation and digital image collection methodology. A complete randomized experimental design was utilized in this study where the pen of pigs was the experimental unit. Two methods, a human observer and a digital image, were assigned within rooms to all pens. Three age of pig treatments were compared; 6 -weeks (n = 6 pens), 7 -weeks (n = 10 pens) and 8 -weeks (n = 11 pens). There were no differences for pig age when classified as touch, orientated and not orientated using the digital image (P 3 ̆e 0. 05). Using the human method, more 7 -week old pigs <b>touched</b> the human (<b>P</b> = 0. 02). In conclusion, the digital image can be studied in more detail (on average each digital image was reviewed for 5 minutes) and hence, classifying pigs to these categories could be more accurate, resulting in no age differences for human approach in the pen between 6, 7 and 8 week old nursery pigs...|$|R

40|$|A {{study of}} the head {{ganglion}} of the leech was made to compare the properties of specific sensory cells in this ganglion with those of homologous neurones in the segmental ganglia. 1. In the head ganglion, cells were identified that had electrical properties, sensory modalities and adaptation properties {{similar to those of}} <b>touch</b> (T), pressure (<b>P)</b> and nociceptive (N) cells in the segmental ganglia. The cell bodies of these neurones were situated in characteristics positions that could be correlated with those in the segmental ganglia. Several lines of evidence suggested that they were primary sensory neurones. Fewer T, P and N neurones were identified in the head ganglion than would be expected from its six constituent segmental ganglia. 2. The receptive fields of identified T, P and N cells were situated on the external surface of the head and the interior of the mouth with considerable overlap. They were generally smaller in size than those situated on {{the main part of the}} body. The receptive fields were also displaced anteriorly so that some of them were situated in segments anterior to those of the innervating cells. 3. The morphology of the sensory cells in the head ganglion was studied by intracellular injection of horseradish perioxidase. The general branching characteristics of the cells and the structural appearance of their processes resembled those of homologous cells in the segmental ganglia. However, the routes taken to the periphery by some of the cells were not constant from head ganglion to head ganglion. This variability was confirmed by electrophysiological evidence, and differed from the constancy seen in segmental sensory cells...|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} my Ph. D. {{project is the}} study of the neural coding of sensory-motor {{responses}} in the leech Hirudo Medicinalis. I have used a combination of multielectrode recordings, videomicroscopy and computer vision methods to quantify the leech behavior and simultaneously measure its underlying neuronal activity. Based on this experimental approach, I was able to characterize the motor pattern underlying reflexive behavior in the leech, addressing fundamental issues of systems neuroscience such as population coding and distributed organization of motor responses. In this context, the specific aims of my Ph. D. project can be summarized in three main goals: 1) to develop a new method to quantify the two-dimensional pattern of defmmation induced by muscle contraction on the leech body wall; 2) to investigate the distributed organization of leech reflexive behavior at the level of recruitment and activation of specific classes of motoneurons and muscle fibers; 3) to understand the neural basis of the reliability of leech motor responses, by quantifying their reproducibility at different levels of neural processing. In this scheme, the accomplishment of a specific aim was the starting point to address the next one. Quantitative analysis of defommtion occurring on leech body-wall was the necessary backdrop for characterizing leech sensory-motor responses at the behavioral level. This quantitative analysis of behavior, in tum, was fundamental for comparing reproducibility of leech motor responses with that of neural firing sustaining them. In the following paragraphs, I will summarize the major achievements of my Ph. D. project in relation to established main goals. The first aim of my research was to develop a reliable and innovative method to quantify the pattern of deformation that muscle contraction induces on the leech body-wall. Muscle contraction is usually measured and characterized with force and displacement transducers. The contraction of muscle fibers, however, evokes in the tissue a two and even three-dimensional displacement field, which is not properly quantified by these transducers because they provide just a single scalar quantity. I circumvented this problem by using videomicroscopy and standard tools of computer vision developed for the analysis of time varying image sequences. By computing the so called optical flow, i. e. the apparent motion of points in a time varying image sequence, it is possible to recover a two dimensional motion field, describing rather precisely the displacement caused by muscle contraction in a flattened piece of skin. The obtained two dimensional optical flow can be further analyzed by computing its migin (i. e. the singular point) and four elementary components that combine linearly: expansion, rotation, longitudinal shear and oblique shear. These elementary deformations provide a compact and accurate characterization of the contraction induced by different motoneurons. I demonstrated this technique by analyzing the displacement caused by muscle contraction on the leech body-wall. However, this method can be applied to monitor and characterize all contractions in almost flat tissues with enough visual texture. The second aim of my Ph. D. project was to apply the method described above in order to characterize the pattern of activation of different classes of motoneurons and muscles during leech reflexive behavior. Activation of motoneurons innervating leech muscles causes the appearance of a two dimensional vector field of deformations on the skin surface that can be fully characterized by computing the optical flow. I found that all motoneurons can be classified and recognized according to the elementary deformations of the contractions they elicit: longitudinal motoneurons give rise almost exclusively to longitudinal negative shear, whereas circular motoneurons give rise to both positive longitudinal shear and significant negative expansion. Oblique motoneurons induce strong oblique shear, in addition to longihidinal shear and negative expansion. These results clearly showed that contractions induced by different classes of motoneurons and muscle fibers form a set of basic behavioral units. I also investigated the way in which such behavioral units can combine to sustain motor responses and I found that optical flows induced by the contraction of longitudinal, circular and oblique fibers superimpose linearly. Complex patterns of skin deformation induced by mechanosensory stimulation can therefore be attributed rather reliably to the contraction of distinct longitudinal, circular and oblique muscle fibers. Based on this conclusion, I found that local bending, a motor response caused by local mechanical stimulation of the leech skin, is sustained by coactivation of two distinct classes of motoneurons: circular and longitudinal. I also compared the pattern of deformation produced by local bending with that produced by intracellular stimulation of mechanosensory pressure (<b>P),</b> <b>touch</b> (T) and nociceptive (N) cells: optical flows resulting from the activation of P cells were almost identical to those produced by mechanical stimulation. This confirmed that local bending is almost entirely mediated by excitation of P cells, with minor contributions from T and N cells. In conclusion, these results revealed the distributed nature of leech reflexive behavior at the level of muscle activation and motoneuron recruitment, showing that complex motor responses result from the linear sum of a small number of basic patterns of deformation. The final step in investigating distributed motor behavior in the leech was to characterize the reproducibility of local bending and that of neural firing sustaining it. I analyzed variability at different levels of processing: mechanosensory neurons, motoneurons, muscle activation and behavior. I found that spike trains in mechanosensory neurons were very reproducible, unlike those in motoneurons. However, the motor response was much more reproducible than the firing of individual motoneurons sustaining it. I showed that this reliability of the behavior is obtained by two distinct biophysical mechanisms: temporal and ensemble averaging. The former is guaranteed by the low pass filtering properties of the leech muscles that contract very slowly and therefore are poorly sensitive to the jitter of motoneuron spikes. The latter is provided by the coactivation of a population of motoneurons, firing in a statistically independent way. This statistical independence reduces the vm ability of the population firing. These results have a general significance, because they show that reproducible spike trains are not required to sustain reproducible behaviors and illustrate how the nervous system can cope with umeliable components to produce reliable action...|$|R
