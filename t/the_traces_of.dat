5|$|After Méliès's {{financial}} difficulties and decline, most {{copies of his}} prints were lost. In 1917, his offices were occupied by the French military, who melted down many of Méliès's films to gather <b>the</b> <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> silver from the film stock and make boot heels from the celluloid. When the Théâtre Robert-Houdin was demolished in 1923, the prints kept there were sold by weight to a vendor of second-hand film. Finally, in that same year, Méliès had a moment of anger and burned all his remaining negatives in his garden in Montreuil. In 1925, he began selling toys and candy from a stand in the Gare Montparnasse in Paris. A Trip to the Moon was largely forgotten to history and went unseen for years.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Finding <b>the</b> <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> an {{explicit}} matrix {{is a simple}} operation. But there are applications areas where one need to compute <b>the</b> <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> an implicit matrix. In this paper we explore the use of Monte-Carlo simulation for estimating <b>the</b> <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> an implicit symmetric positive semi-de nite matrix. We analyze algorithms that estimate <b>the</b> <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> matrix represented as a quadratic form x ↦ → x T Ax. We propose an algorithm that nds an ɛ-approximation with probability 1 − δ using O(ɛ − 2 log(1 /δ)) experiments; each experiment requires one application of the implicit matrix. We also provide evidence that our method is asymptotically almost-tight. Furthermore, we analyze other variants of the algorithm, including the the current standard method due to Hutchinson. Finally, we experiment with the various methods, and explore their behavior in practice. 1...|$|R
