50|$|In the film, Gilgamesh is a grotesque, Picasso-esque {{being who}} moves by {{tricycle}} and patrols his box-shaped kingdom that hovers above a dark abyss. The yellow walls are inscribed with calligraphic text and its seemingly vast expanse is randomly broken up by square holes from which medical hooks occasionally project. A table - a mechanism and a trap - concealing a pulsating vagina within {{one of its}} drawers, stands at the centre of Gilgamesh’s domain. High above this space are strung high-tension wires, vibrating in the wind, one caught with a broken tennis racquet. First, Gilgamesh is seen setting up a bizarre trap to lure and catch the wild man Enkidu (who is depicted as a bird-like creature, partially made of genuine animal skeletons). Enkidu appears {{to live in a}} distant forest world visible through a hatch in the side of one of the walls of the floating kingdom. Gilgamesh is seen eating dandelion fluff during the opening credits before he finishes readying the trap. Once finished, Gilgamesh retreats to a room beneath the floor of the floating kingdom, awaiting Enkidu's arrival. Sometime later, Enkidu enters and becomes intrigued by a table with an anatomical, H.R. Giger/da Vinci-esque image of a woman's muscles (symbolizing the character Shamhat). The mechanism activates allowing Enkidu to look inside the image revealing a swaying piece of meat on a hook within the woman’s body. A drawer on the table opens, revealing the pulsating vagina. Ecstatic, Enkidu begins to mount the table, which sets off Gilgamesh's trap, flinging him onto the high-tension wires. An excited Gilgamesh resurfaces, retrieving the ensnared Enkidu by means of a giant gold cloth. Gilgamesh binds his captive with twine, beats him with a spiked club, and brushes his wings before cutting them off with scissors. Gilgamesh cuts the <b>twine</b> <b>binding</b> Enkidu and as the gold cloth falls to the ground the viewer is given a shot of Enkidu’s forest. The same fluff that Gilgamesh was eating earlier litters the forest floor and the viewer is allowed to observe an insect husk rapidly decay. In the end, Gilgamesh is seen riding frenzied circles around Enkidu, who is now trapped beneath the table-mechanism on which the trap was set.|$|E
50|$|The rope dart {{is a long}} rope (usually 3 - 5 m) with a metal dart {{attached}} to one end. This was a weapon from ancient times, which allows the user to throw the dart out at a long-range target and use the rope to pull it back. The rope dart {{can be used for}} <b>twining,</b> <b>binding,</b> circling, hitting, piercing, tightening, slashing and other techniques.|$|R
50|$|The Pennyworth was a {{freighter}}, {{built in}} Scotland in 1916.She is notable {{for being the}} first freighter to carry cargo to Canada's newly opened deepwater port on the Arctic Ocean, at Churchill, Manitoba.She arrived on August 17, 1932, carrying a mixed cargo of liquor, china and glass tableware, <b>binding</b> <b>twine,</b> and lubricating oil, {{as well as a}} few passengers. She was the first freighter to arrive again in 1933, on August 13, 1933.|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} uses {{evidence from}} the notarial records between 1850 and 1905 to analyze {{the economic and social}} relations in a transitional economy. During the period covered by the project, the Sates of Yucatan changed from an economic backland to an export-oriented producer of benequen (sisal) used for <b>binding</b> <b>twine</b> and ropes in the United States and Europe. With the postcolonial power struggles in government as a backdrop, I use the notarial records to study the development of the credit market, as well as the social, institutional, and economic relations between the local players in an increasingly integrated export-oriented economy. ...|$|R
50|$|The Canadian branch plant of the Plymouth Cordage Company {{was started}} in 1904 due to Parliament's {{initiation}} of a 25% import duty on rope and related products. Plymouth, with roots in Massachusetts, moved to secure its business in <b>binding</b> <b>twine,</b> necessary to package farm crops such as grass, wheat or straw. The city of Welland grew up around the Plymouth plant, which was prior to 1904, farmland (owned by Morwood, McCoppen, Leitch and Gunn). The cordage industry {{was a victim of}} the harvester-thresher, which obviated the need for <b>binding</b> (or baling) <b>twine,</b> as the threshing operation is now performed in a contiguous step immediately when the stalk is cut.|$|R
50|$|The Peoria Cordage Company {{buildings}} {{are located in}} an area of one and two story industrial and commercial buildings in the city of Peoria, Illinois, United States. Most of the buildings in the area were constructed between 1890 and 1920. The site consisted of ten buildings when the property was nominated and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982, three of the buildings carried more historical significance than the others. These included the Rope Mill, the New Mill and the Old Mill. The company was founded in 1888 by Edward C. Heidrich and Martin Kingman in response to the growing demand for <b>binding</b> <b>twine.</b>|$|R
