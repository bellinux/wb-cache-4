5|$|According to the National Trust, <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> <b>is</b> trimmed {{regularly}} {{and the giant}} is fully re-chalked every 25 years. Traditionally, the National Trust has relied on sheep from surrounding farms to graze the site. However, in 2008 a lack of sheep, coupled with a wet spring causing extra plant growth, forced a re-chalking of the giant, with 17 tonnes of new chalk being poured in and tamped down by hand. In 2006, the National Trust carried out the first wildlife survey of the Cerne Abbas Giant, identifying wild flowers including the green-winged orchid, clustered bellflower and autumn gentian, which are uncommon in England.|$|E

She reunited with Grant and Mitchum for a sophisticated comedy, <b>The</b> <b>Grass</b> <b>Is</b> Greener (1960), and then joined Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra in a love triangle for a romantic comedy, Marriage on the Rocks (1965). In 1966, the producers of Carry On Screaming! offered her a fee comparable to that paid {{to the rest of the}} cast combined, but she turned it down in favor of appearing in an aborted stage version of Flowers for Algernon.|$|E

Robert Mitchum plays an American oil tycoon who falls in love with Kerr and Jean Simmons plays an eccentric American heiress who is Grant's former girlfriend. The film was a financial disappointment in the US, but successful in England where the original stage version had been a West End hit.|$|E
5|$|Warwick Davis as Nikabrik, a black dwarf. He is {{descendant}} of Ginarrbrik, who served the White Witch, and bears {{one of his}} rings, which was passed down from each generation. Mark Johnson acknowledged casting Davis as the treacherous Nikabrik was casting against type: Berger covered all his face bar his eyelids in prosthetics, to allow Davis {{to ward off the}} audience's perceptions of him. Nikabrik's nose was based on Berger. Davis feared filming in the Czech Republic, because <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> <b>is</b> filled with ticks, so he put elastic bands to hold his trousers against his legs. Davis portrayed Reepicheep in the 1989 BBC production of Prince Caspian.|$|E
5|$|The female may {{be offered}} food by the male during {{courtship}}. He has a brief courtship display {{in which the}} neck is extended and the head held down, the tail is fanned, and the wings are spread with the tips touching the ground. He will then attempt to approach the female from behind, and then leap on her back to copulate. The nest is typically in grassland, sometimes in safer sites along a hedge, or near an isolated tree or bush, or in overgrown vegetation. Where grass is not tall enough {{at the start of}} the season, the first nest may be constructed in herby or marsh vegetation, with the second brood in hay. The second nest may also be at a higher altitude that the first, to take advantage of the later-developing grasses further up a hill. The nest, well hidden in <b>the</b> <b>grass,</b> <b>is</b> built in a scrape or hollow in the ground. It is made of woven coarse dry grass and other plants, and lined with finer grasses. Although nest construction is usually described as undertaken by the female, a recent aviary study found that in the captive population the male always built the nest.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>grasses</b> {{evaluated}} <b>are</b> Chloris roxburghiana, Eragrostis superba, Enteropogon macrostachyus, Cenchrus ciliaris, Chloris gayana, and Sorghum sudanense. These <b>grasses</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> common {{species in}} the rangelands of Kenya and have been promoted {{in the past for}} hay making and reseeding interventions. <b>The</b> <b>grasses</b> <b>were</b> harvested at <b>the</b> mature flowering stage (12  weeks phenological stage), which is a period that provides high biomass without much effect on quality as practiced in the study area. <b>The</b> <b>grasses</b> <b>were</b> then cured in the field for 1, 2, and 3  days before baling and stored indoors for 12, 24, and 36  weeks. Samples were taken for CP content determination at the three periods following Macro-Kjeldahl Method.|$|R

5|$|This crake is {{a partial}} migrant, but {{although}} it is less skulking than many of its relatives, its movements are complex and poorly studied; the distribution map is therefore largely hypothetical. It is mainly a wet-season breeder, and many birds {{move away from the}} equator as soon as the rains provide sufficient grass cover to allow them to breed elsewhere. Southward movement is mainly from November to April, the return north beginning when burning or drought reduces the grass cover again. This species is present throughout the year in some West African countries, and in equatorial regions, but even in those areas numbers vary seasonally due to local movements; north-south migration has been noted within countries including Nigeria, Senegal, The Gambia, Ivory Coast and Cameroon. Migration takes place at night and involves small groups of up to eight birds; It may be one or two months after the rains begin before <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> <b>is</b> sufficiently high for breeding birds to arrive. Even in southern Africa, some birds may stay after breeding if enough usable habitat remains.|$|E
5|$|Wood small-reed (Calamagrostis epigejos) {{is present}} {{in the center of the}} site and threatens to spread into {{herbaceous}} areas. It compromises sustainability of stations, including man orchid and bee orchid populations. Two distinct zones can be distinguished. The first, where the wood small-reed has a very high rate of recovery, is not hosting any heritage value. It is mowed early and disposed of. Grazing is not possible at the moment. The second, on the contrary, not densely colonized by this plant is much more of a fragile situation due to the presence of orchids and the sickle-bearing bush cricket or long-horned groundhopper. Differentiated management is applied depending on the issues. At orchid stations, slight thinning is done early by hand pruning. The less dense areas where <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> <b>is</b> sparse (conducive to the long-horned groundhopper (Tetrix tenuicornis)) are pulled. In the newly opened areas, a systematic and annual pulling avoids expansion. Finally, dense areas, well exposed, are left in that state.|$|E
