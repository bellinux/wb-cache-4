5|$|<b>The</b> <b>pamphlet</b> {{was read}} by Augustin Robespierre, brother of Maximilien Robespierre, who was {{impressed}} by the revolutionary context. <b>The</b> <b>pamphlet</b> itself had little effect against the rebellious forces, but served to advance Napoleon's career. He soon became recognised for his political ambitions by a Corsica-born politician, and family friend, Christophe Saliceti, who arranged to have it published and distributed. Christophe's influence, along with fellow Convention deputy Augustin Robespierre, advanced Napoleon into the position of senior gunner, at Toulon.|$|E

5|$|Though <b>the</b> <b>pamphlet</b> {{describes}} the pitiable and desperate {{conditions in which}} prostitutes lived, and {{the corruption of the}} police supposed to be patrol them, it also accuses prostitutes of 'Inhumanity' and deems them devilish and monstrous. The vices of the prostitute are presented as those endemic among all women.|$|E

5|$|Contemporary {{scholars}} {{have found in}} <b>the</b> <b>pamphlet</b> evidence of several Early Modern British trends: the equation of effeminacy with homosexuality; the use of Sappho as a symbol for lesbianism {{at a time when}} public awareness of lesbian relationships was increasing; and an equation of Roman Catholic Italy and France with moral degeneracy.|$|E

5|$|Ian McCormick diagnoses <b>the</b> <b>pamphlet</b> as {{representing}} a gradual change in European {{discourse on the}} character of the sodomite: previous publications had discussed sexual deviance (conceived in contemporary terms) as a general evil; with Satan's Harvest Home a new attention was brought to the individual character of persons who committed sodomy. He argues that 'before the seventeenth century, sodomy was not even precisely differentiated from its demonic associations with werewolves, heretics, sorcerers, and the like. Increasingly, however, it came to be linked with pride, excess of diet, idleness, and contempt of the poor.' The pamphlet's equation of effeminacy with homosexuality is identified by Michael Kimmel as distinctive for the period.|$|E
5|$|In February 1872 Bruce {{proposed}} {{a bill that}} took some of the commission's recommendations, but widened the geographical scope from the 18 military centres to {{the whole of the}} UK. Although the LNA's initial stance was to accept some of the bill's clauses and try and change others, Josephine rejected it in its entirety and published The New Era, a 56-page pamphlet attacking the legislation; <b>the</b> <b>pamphlet</b> was re-published in serial form in The Shield. It was the first split in the repeal movement and she lost many personal supporters because of her stance. The bill faced too much opposition from the parliamentary supporters of the Contagious Diseases Acts, and was withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|It {{is written}} in the same style as the Tory {{publications}} that attacked Dissenters, and was assumed by some people to be a genuine vindication of their view. <b>The</b> <b>pamphlet</b> raised embarrassing questions about {{the handling of the}} issue by the Tory ministry, and led to Defoe's arrest for seditious libel. His imprisonment, during which he fell into bankruptcy, was to have a lasting influence on his subsequent writings. In the years after his release, Defoe published several pamphlets that attempted to explain its purpose and his own views.|$|E

50|$|The {{first set}} of three {{pamphlets}} were written by directors of the Field Day Company - Tom Paulin, Seamus Heaney and Seamus Deane. <b>The</b> <b>pamphlets</b> were largely responsible for entering Field Day into the political debate whose calcified terms the project had originally wanted to explode.

5|$|Jonathan Swift, then Dean of St Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin, {{was already}} {{known for his}} concern for the Irish people and for writing several {{political}} pamphlets. One of these, Proposal for the Universal use of Irish Manufacture (1720), had so inflamed the British authorities that the printer, John Harding, was prosecuted, although <b>the</b> <b>pamphlet</b> had done little more than recommend that the Irish use the materials they produce rather than export them to England. It was also known by the Irish authorities that Swift's political pamphleteering had been employed by the Tory government of Queen Anne, {{and that he would}} use his abilities to undermine the Whig government of Walpole.|$|E
5|$|Later, Hill {{attacked}} both Fielding and Smart, 13 August 1752, in {{the only}} issue of The Impertinent to be produced. Although the work was published anonymously, it was commonly known that it was produced by Hill, and he soon followed up <b>the</b> <b>pamphlet</b> with his 25 August 1752 The Inspector column in the London Daily Advertiser. With the column, he harshly criticized Smart's Poems on Several Occasions. Fielding eventually left the dispute after the sixth issue of The Covent-Garden Journal was published.|$|E
5|$|Other {{scholars}} {{have identified the}} text's tone as satirical and mildly obscene, locating it among a movement of pamphlets influenced by a counter-trend promoting greater sympathy for prostitution. Linda Dowling interprets <b>the</b> <b>pamphlet</b> less a broadside against sodomites, and more as evidence of a strand in rhetoric that valorized Britain's martial past and saw {{lack of respect for}} it as a precondition for vice. Ian Bell considers the causality of this relationship between moral collapse and vice, characterizing the book as part of strand that saw vice as a product, not a cause, of a fundamental collapse in morality in Augustan London.|$|E
