5|$|The 4th Siege of Badajoz {{took place}} from July to October 1658 during the Portuguese Restoration War. It {{was an attempt}} by a huge Portuguese army {{under the command of}} Joanne Mendes de Vasconcelos, {{governor}} of Alentejo, to capture the Spanish city of Badajoz, which was the headquarters of the Spanish Army of Extremadura. The fortifications of Badajoz were essentially medieval and considered vulnerable by the Portuguese, and had already been attacked by <b>them</b> <b>three</b> times during this war.|$|E

5|$|In 1967 Solti {{was invited}} to become music {{director}} of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. It was the second time he had been offered the post. The first had been in 1963 after the death of the orchestra's conductor, Fritz Reiner, who made its reputation in the previous decade. Solti told the representatives of the orchestra that his commitments at Covent Garden made it impossible to give Chicago the eight months a year they sought. He suggested giving <b>them</b> <b>three</b> and a half months a year and inviting Carlo Maria Giulini to take charge for a similar length of time. The orchestra declined to proceed on these lines. When Solti accepted the orchestra's second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting. Both conductors signed three-year contracts with the orchestra, effective from 1969.|$|E
5|$|In May Arsenal beat Derby County 1–0 {{to return}} to first spot, after Manchester United {{recorded}} three points against Aston Villa. A 1–3 away win against Tottenham Hotspur moved <b>them</b> <b>three</b> points clear after Paul Ince scored a late equaliser for Liverpool against Manchester United. Wenger was adamant that Ferguson's team were marginal favourites, but it was evident the title race would be decided {{on the final day}}, akin to 1995. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink's late winner for Leeds United against Arsenal two days later all but ended their chances of retaining the league championship. Although Manchester United drew their penultimate match away to Blackburn Rovers, they eventually secured the title with a 2–1 victory at home to Tottenham Hotspur; a second half goal scored by Kanu against Aston Villa on the final day ensured Arsenal finished a point behind, in second place.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} balloting, the fifty {{states of the}} U.S. are split into six regions (Far West, Mid Atlantic, Mid West, North East, South, South West), and six {{regional}} representatives are selected to appoint voters in their states. Each region has 145 media votes, {{for a total of}} 870 votes. In addition, all previous Heisman winners may vote, and one final vote is counted through public balloting. The Heisman ballots contain a 3-2-1 point system, in which each ballot ranks the voter's top three players and awards <b>them</b> <b>three</b> points for a first-place vote, two points for a second-place vote, and one point for a third-place vote. The points are tabulated, and the player with the highest total of points across all ballots wins the Heisman Trophy.|$|E

The team began play in East Rutherford, New Jersey at the Brendan Byrne Arena, later renamed the Continental Airlines Arena and then the Izod Center, where they called home through the 2006–07 season. The Devils were initially placed in the Patrick Division. Their first game ended in a 3–3 tie against the Pittsburgh Penguins, with their first goal scored by Don Lever.

5|$|The Romans faced further reverses on the {{battlefield}} and a savage guerrilla war in the Bosnian mountains. It took <b>them</b> <b>three</b> years of hard fighting to quell the revolt, which was described by the Roman historian Suetonius,writing in c. AD 100, as the most difficult conflict faced by Rome since the Punic Wars over two centuries earlier. Tiberius finally succeeded in quelling the revolt in 9AD. This was apparently lucky timing for the Romans: that same year Arminius destroyed Varus' three legions in Germany. The Roman high command {{had no doubt that}} Arminius would have formed a grand alliance with the Illyrians.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} online multiplayer. Having five maps as standard, matches can {{be carried}} out with select players, random players, or through local multiplayer.

In addition, Fates features Amiibo support, with compatible figurines being characters from earlier Fire Emblem games: when scanned, the character represented by a figurine will appear within My Castle, and after talking with <b>them</b> <b>three</b> times they can be fought in battle. When defeated, they become allies that join the main campaign. Talking with them prior to the fight gives the Avatar themed items, such as the mask of Fire Emblem Awakenings Lucina.
