To restrain machining vibration of compressor blade in multi-axis machining, the mechanism of vibration and milling force during machining thin-walled blades is analyzed. A model of machining vibration and a vibration differential equation are established. Response function of blade reflects that the amplitude is influenced by clamping stiffness of blade, the natural frequency and damping of blade-fixture system.

30|$|The {{stability}} of the implant-abutment connection comes from both the screw function and the frictional resistance between the conical, contacting metallic surfaces of the connection [10]. An abutment screw provides stability via a clamping force [11, 12]. When rotational torque {{is applied to the}} screw, the screw elongates and causes stress on the stem and threads.

40|$|ABSTRACT The two-microelectrode {{technique}} of voltage clamping sheep cardiac Purkinje fibers {{was used to}} examine the changes in contraction which occur during trains of voltage clamps. (A "train " is defined as a series of voltage clamps delivered at a particular rate, beginning after a rest long enough that the effects of previous stimulation have died away.) Contractions showed striking staircases, or progressive changes in peak isometric tension, during trains. Short clamps, clamps to voltages more negative than [...] 20 or [...] 30 mV, or holding potentials less negative than the resting potential favored negative staircases, while long clamps, clamps to positive voltages, and holding potentials near the resting potential each favored positive staircases. The staircase behavior appeared to be due to changes in the initial rate of recovery of the ability to contract. The changes in staircase behavior as a function of clamp voltage suggested that the relationship between peak <b>tension</b> and <b>clamp</b> voltage should depend on the experimental design. When the steady-state contraction was plotted as a function of clamp voltage, voltage-tension relations like those recently reported for working ventricle were obtained, with a threshold between [...] 30 and [...] 40 mV and a steep relation between tension and voltage.

40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} that the clamped-wire system used to suspend bones within an Ilizarov external fixator yields when the perpendicular load exceeds 50 N per wire. Cyclic loading was applied to <b>tensioned</b> wires <b>clamped</b> within an Ilizarov ring component, with steadily increasing load amplitude. Wires were tested at four initial tension settings. The amount of energy lost within the clamped-wire system per load cycle was calculated for every test. The results showed {{that there was a}} consistent trend to increasing non-recoverable energy loss per load cycle when peak loads exceed 50 N for all initial tension settings. A finite element (FE) model replicating the experimental conditions was performed to investigate the levels of stress within the loaded wires. The FE model analyses showed that high stresses were generated in the wires close to the clamping sites, and that the stress levels could reasonably be expected to exceed the material yield stress when loaded to about 55 N, for all initial tension settings. The results show that material yield, accompanied by some wire slippage through the clamps, is responsible for system yield, in agreement with previous studies. Although the initial wire tension has an appreciable effect on the wire stiffness, it did not affect the elastic load range of the clamped-wire system. To prevent yield of the clamped-wire system in practice, the fixator should be assembled with sufficient wires to ensure that the load transmitted to each wire by the patient does not exceed 50 N...|$|R

Tension (about 1275 N) was applied to a wire that was subsequently clamped, using cannulated bolts, to the steel half-ring of an Ilizarov external fixator. The tension in the wire was monitored before, during and after clamping. The apparatus was disassembled and the deformations in the wire caused by the clamps were measured. This experiment was repeated 15 times. When the wire was clamped to the frame, the wire tension was reduced by 22 +/- 7 per cent (mean +/- standard deviation, SD). The drop in wire tension was linearly correlated (r = 0. 96; p < 0. 001) with the deformation caused by the bolts. A finite element (FE) model of the wire was also constructed. The model was pre-stressed (<b>tensioned),</b> and the <b>clamping</b> effect replicated.

Arterial segments were mounted in myographs for recording of isometric <b>tension.</b> Whole-cell patch <b>clamp</b> was used to assess KATP-channel currents in isolated smooth muscle cells from the arteries. In arteries preconstricted with the thromboxane A 2 analogue U 46619 pinacidil and cromakalim induced concentration-dependent relaxations. In arteries preconstricted with potassium (124 mM) only high concentrations of pinacidil had a small relaxant effect. In arteries preconstricted with U 46619 pinacidil-induced relaxations were unaffected by pretreatment with Nω-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) and only slightly reduced after mechanical removal of the endothelium. Pinacidil induced relaxations were not significantly affected by 1 μM glibenclamide. However, the relaxations were partly inhibited in potassium-free media and by 1 μM ouabain. In contrast, the concentration-dependent relaxation to cromakalim was partly blocked by 1 μM glibenclamide and partly by 1 μM ouabain and when both drugs were present the inhibition increased. Ouabain (1 μM) and glibenclamide (1 μM) each partly inhibited an ATP-sensitive current induced by pinacidil and cromakalim. In the presence of both inhibitors a greater inhibition was seen. When the solution in the patch pipette was sodium-free the current was reduced and ouabain had no effect. The study suggests that the relaxation to cromakalim and most likely pinacidil is mediated through opening of KATP channels. Inhibition of the Na,K-pump, however, may change the local environment for the KATP channels (i. e. increases the ATP/ADPratio and/or decreases the transmembrane potassium gradient), which partly prevents the activation of the KATP-channel current...|$|R
40|$|Conventional seismic-resistant {{structural}} {{systems are}} currently designed {{to develop a}} global sway plastic mechanism under strong earthquakes, {{which is achieved by}} allowing the development of controlled inelastic deformations in specific locations of main structural members such as beams, bases of columns and braces. Inelastic deformations in structural members result in damage and residual drifts, and therefore, in economic losses such as repair costs and downtime. Moreover, earthquake reconnaissance reports reveal large economic losses related to non-structural damage, e. g. failure of walls due to large storey drifts or failure of acceleration-sensitive equipment due to large peak floor accelerations. These losses highlight the need for resilient structures with the potential to remain intact after frequently occurred earthquakes and return to service within an acceptable short, if not immediate, time after strong rare earthquakes. Moreover, resilient structures should provide a very low probability of collapse (i. e. increased life safety) under very rare maximum considered earthquake. Steel self-centering moment-resisting frames using post-tensioned beam-column connections are a promising class of resilient structures. They exhibit softening force-drift behaviour and eliminate inelastic deformations and residual drifts as the result of gap openings developed in beam-column interfaces and elastic post <b>tensioned</b> bars which <b>clamp</b> beams to columns and provide self-centering capability. Also, post tensioned connections use energy dissipation devices, which are activated when gaps open and can be easily replaced if damaged. Steel frames equipped with passive dampers are another class of resilient structures. Dampers provide supplemental damping to control drifts, and thus, provide an effective means to achieve economical designs with high performance. The main goal of this PhD is to develop a seismic design and assessment procedure for steel self-centering moment-resisting frames (SC-MRFs) with viscous dampers within the framework of Eurocodes 3 and 8. To achieve this goal, nonlinear models of post-tensioned connections, able to capture the strength and stiffness deterioration due to local buckling, are developed. These models enable the assessment of the seismic behaviour of SC-MRFs with viscous dampers up to collapse with the aid of nonlinear dynamic analysis. A seismic design method, which incorporates a robust way to estimate rotation demands in post-tensioned connections, is then formulated. Different SC-MRFs with viscous dampers are designed using the proposed design procedure to study different design scenarios. The accuracy of the design procedure is evaluated through nonlinear dynamic analysis. In addition, the superior collapse resistance of SC-MRFs with viscous dampers is validated through incremental dynamic analysis. The thesis concludes with the implementation of an advanced probabilistic framework for direct economic seismic loss estimation and its application to confirm the potential of SC-MRFs with viscous dampers to significantly reduce economic seismic losses...|$|R
