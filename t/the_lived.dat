5|$|Beyonce has crafted her brand around {{embracing}} femininity {{and female}} sexuality. Although as Dr. Cheryl Thompson explains {{in her article}} “The sweet taste of lemonade: Beyonce serves up black feminist history most recent album,” Beyonce is only recently exploring the intersecting themes of feminism and black empowerment in her work. According to Thompson, Beyonce - like many other black female artists - has held back with her identity as a black woman {{for the sake of}} appealing to the masses. Like the SNL skit that pokes fun at white Beyonce fans that listened to “Lemonade” and realized {{for the first time that}} Beyonce is indeed a black woman, it is only very recently that the artist has transformed her feminist image into something more specific to the issues black women face. As Thompson explains, all of Beyonce’s previous albums were about feminism. “Lemonade” is about black feminism. The importance of having artistry like “Lemonade” in the mainstream is critical to examining <b>the</b> <b>lived</b> experiences of black women, and the racial and gender-based oppression that intersect to create a unique set of obstacles.|$|E

25|$|Its {{philosophy}} has been sketched {{out in a}} number of articles and interviews. The key ideas are those of a politics of the poor, a living politics and a people's politics. A politics of the poor is understood to mean a politics that is conducted by the poor and for the poor in a manner that enables the poor to be active participants in the struggles conducted in their name. Practically, it means that such a politics must be conducted where poor people live or in places that they can easily access, at the times when they are free, in the languages that they speak. It does not mean that middle-class people and organisations are excluded but that they are expected to come to these spaces and to undertake their politics there in a dialogical and democratic manner. There are two key aspects {{to the idea of a}} living politics. The first is that it is understood as a politics that begins not from external theory but from the experience of the people that shape it. It is argued that political education usually operates to create new elites who mediate relationships of patronage upwards and who impose ideas on others and to exclude ordinary people from thinking politically. This politics is not anti-theory – it just asserts the need to begin from lived experience and to move on from there rather than to begin from theory (usually imported from the Global North) and to impose theory on <b>the</b> <b>lived</b> experience of suffering and resistance in the shacks. The second key aspect, of a living politics, is that political thinking is always undertaken democratically and in common. People's politics is opposed to party politics or politicians' politics (as well as to top down undemocratic forms of NGO politics) and it is argued that the former is a popular democratic project undertaken without financial reward and with an explicit refusal of representative roles and personal power while the latter is a top down, professionalised representative project driven by personal power.|$|E

500|$|The {{sociology}} {{of change and}} development attempts to understand how societies develop {{and how they can}} be changed. This includes studying many different aspects of society, for example demographic trends, political or technological trends, or changes in culture. Within this field, sociologists often use macrosociological methods or historical-comparative methods. In contemporary studies of social change, there are overlaps with international development or community development. However, most of the founders of sociology had theories of social change based on their study of history. For instance, Marx contended that the material circumstances of society ultimately caused the ideal or cultural aspects of society, while Weber argued that it was in fact the cultural mores of Protestantism that ushered in a transformation of material circumstances. In contrast to both, Durkheim argued that societies moved from simple to complex through a process of sociocultural evolution. Sociologists in this field also study processes of globalization and imperialism. Most notably, Immanuel Wallerstein extends Marx's theoretical frame to include large spans of time and the entire globe in what is known as world systems theory. Development sociology is also heavily influenced by post-colonialism. In recent years, Raewyn Connell issued a critique of the bias in sociological research towards countries in the Global North. She argues that this bias blinds sociologists to <b>the</b> <b>lived</b> experiences of the Global South, specifically, so-called, [...] "Northern Theory" [...] lacks an adequate theory of imperialism and colonialism.|$|E

2500|$|Two of Jameson's best-known claims from Postmodernism {{are that}} postmodernity is {{characterized}} by pastiche and a crisis in historicity. Jameson argued that parody (which implies a moral judgment or a comparison with societal norms) was replaced by pastiche (collage {{and other forms of}} juxtaposition without a normative grounding). Relatedly, Jameson argued that the postmodern era suffers from a crisis in historicity: [...] "there no longer does seem to be any organic relationship between the American history we learn from schoolbooks and <b>the</b> <b>lived</b> experience of the current, multinational, high-rise, stagflated city of the newspapers and of our own everyday life".|$|E
2500|$|West {{has called}} the U.S. a [...] "racist patriarchal" [...] nation where white {{supremacy}} continues to define everyday life.

[...] This has resulted, he says, {{in the creation of}} many [...] "degraded and oppressed people hungry for identity, meaning, and self-worth."

2500|$|Historians {{working in}} the Humboldtian {{tradition}} developed ideas that would become central in Boasian anthropology.

For Boas, both values were well-expressed in a quote from Goethe: [...] "A single action or event is interesting, not because it is explainable, but because it is true." ...|$|E

2500|$|In hip hop culture, it is {{considered}} essential to [...] "keep it real" [...] or to be authentic to <b>the</b> <b>lived</b> experiences of people from disadvantaged neighborhoods ("the Ghetto"). Despite the fact that hip hop artists typically use imagined scenarios and fictionalized stories in their raps, the culture demands that they act as if all their lyrics are true or potentially true. Because of this, lyrics of rap songs have often been treated as [...] "confessions" [...] {{to a number of}} violent crimes in the United States. It is also considered to be the duty of rappers and other hip hop artists (DJs, dancers) to [...] "represent" [...] their city and neighborhood. This demands being proud of being from disadvantaged cities neighborhoods that have traditionally been a source of shame, and glorifying them in lyrics and graffiti. This has potentially been {{one of the ways that}} hip hop has become regarded as a [...] "local" [...] rather than [...] "foreign" [...] genre of music in so many countries around the world in just a few decades. Nevertheless, sampling and borrowing from a number of genres and places is also a part of the hip hop milieu, and an album like the surprise hit Kala by Anglo-Tamil rapper M.I.A. was recorded in locations all across the world and features sounds from a different country on every track.|$|E
