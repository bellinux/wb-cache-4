40|$|We {{consider}} an industry with firms that produce a final good emitting pollution to different degree {{as a side}} effect. Pollution is regulated by a tradable quota system where some quotas may have been allocated at the outset, i. e. before <b>the</b> <b>quota</b> market is <b>opened.</b> We study how volatility in quota price affects firm behaviour, taking into account <b>the</b> impact of <b>quota</b> price on final-good price. The impact on the individual firm differs depending on how polluting it is - whether it is `clean' or `dirty'- and whether it has been allocated <b>quotas</b> at <b>the</b> outset. In the absence of long-term or forward contracting, <b>the</b> optimal initial <b>quota</b> allocation turns out to resemble a grandfathering regime: clean firms are allocated no quotas - dirty firms are allocated quotas for {{a part of their}} emissions.

40|$|A Dutch {{pilot study}} of fully {{documented}} fisheries provided the opportunity to observe actual changes in fishing behaviour under catch quota management (CQM). Interviews with fishers in the pilot study aided in interpreting the results and giving insight in the decision making process and reasoning of fishers. The CQM pilot study entailed a fleet of small and large demersal vessels. For these vessels, all cod catches were counted against quota, including catches of individuals below minimum landings size. To obtain reliable catch data all vessels were equipped with electronic monitoring (EM) systems. These systems recorded videos of all fishing and processing activities on board. In return, fishers received a 30 % quota bonus for cod and were compensated with more flexibility on effort regulations. It was hypothesized that vessels in the CQM will (i) increase their landings by 30 % according to their quota bonus, (ii) increase the use of gear with large mesh size, and (iii) change effort towards fishing locations with high catch rates of large cod and avoid areas with high catch rates of undersized cod. The results showed that CQM {{had no effect on}} fishing behaviour of the small vessels. In contrast, large vessels significantly increased their cod landings (216 %) and avoided undersized cod. This difference in response of different fleets suggested that implementation of CQM, for instance {{in the context of the}} European Common Fisheries Policy, should consider fleet characteristics. It seemed that larger vessels in this study more easily adapted their behaviour to new management regimes and that <b>the</b> <b>quota</b> bonus <b>opened</b> up new fishing strategies, that were not envisaged during the implementation. </p...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{dependency}} of the adjustment of prices, exchange rates, and production {{on the nature}} of the trade regime. We contrast the adjustment between a quota and a tariff regime for a 'semi-small' economy characterized by monopolistic competitive market structure and short-run nominal contracts under a floating exchange rate regime. Among other issues we focus on the factors determining the behavior of <b>the</b> <b>quota</b> rent and <b>the</b> 'pass- through' of exchange rate adjustment to the domestic prices of importable goods. We demonstrate that the 'pass-through ratio' (measuring the elasticity of the domestic price of importable goods with respect to the exchange rate) is determined by both the commercial policy and by the market power of the various producers. It tends to be higher in a tariff regime because the endogenous adjustment of <b>the</b> <b>quota</b> rent mitigates <b>the</b> 'pass-through'. We also show that the adjustment of the exchange rate tends to be larger in <b>the</b> <b>quota</b> regime than in the tariff regime. In the tariff regime we observe a larger switch of domestic demand relative to <b>the</b> <b>quota</b> regime, and a corresponding smaller exchange rate adjustment. In <b>the</b> <b>quota</b> regime we observe adjustment of <b>the</b> <b>quota</b> rent such as to keep the net domestic demand for foreign goods intact. As a result, the relative price (of the domestic good to the foreign good) facing the foreign consumer adjusts more in <b>the</b> <b>quota</b> regime than in the tariff regime. At the same time the relative price facing domestic consumers in <b>the</b> <b>quota</b> regime adjusts by less than in the tariff regime. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{economic}} effects of introducing <b>quotas</b> to an <b>open</b> access fishery. When quotas are introduced, effort should decrease. This leads to higher prices and lower costs. Thus, overall profits should increase. An empirical analysis of profits in the Norwegian cod fisheries is conducted. Quotas were introduced in this fishery in 1990, and the dataset used covers 1985 - 2005. The research question is: Did profits rise in Norwegian fisheries for cod, after quotas were introduced? Because <b>the</b> <b>quotas</b> limit <b>the</b> activity of the fishers, the stock is affected. In order to see whether quotas increased profits, {{it is necessary to}} do an analysis with levels of stock as it would have developed without <b>the</b> <b>quotas.</b> Therefore a simulation of the stock is done. This is used to simulate landings and profits. The empirical results suggest that there have been a considerable increase in profits for the fishers after 1990. Few variables on effort and opportunities explain profits. Binary variables for years with and without quotas, however, explain a lot of the change in profits. The effects of other changes to policy and market conditions are also controlled for. These indicate that <b>the</b> <b>quotas</b> increased profits in two rounds. First right after the introduction, and then again some years later, as fishers started to trade quotas...|$|R
