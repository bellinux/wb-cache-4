5|$|Skyscrapers {{continued}} to spread both across the U.S. and internationally. New York and Chicago remained {{the center of}} skyscraper development, but most major cities in the U.S. had built skyscrapers by 1929, frequently {{as a result of}} competition between rival cities for status and investment. Cincinnati built the Cincinnati Towers in 1914, followed by the Carew Tower Complex in 1930. In Detroit, the General Motors Building opened in 1920 and the Fisher Building in 1928. Cleveland acquired the Union Trust Building in 1923 and the <b>Terminal</b> <b>Tower</b> in 1929; the latter, built by the Van Sweringen brothers, was, for a short period, the second tallest building in the world. Seattle had built Smith Tower in 1914, and the Los Angeles local government granted itself an exemption from city planning restrictions in order to build the Los Angeles City Hall in 1928. In 1928, the Industrial Trust Tower was built in Providence.|$|E
25|$|Amongst {{the newer}} {{buildings}} {{is the new}} Central Station, which was designed by Wilhelm Holzbauer and added the <b>Terminal</b> <b>Tower</b> skyscraper {{as part of a}} mixed-use complex. Between 2005 und 2011 it was voted Austria’s most beautiful railway station seven times in a row by the Verkehrsclub Österreich. The Wissensturm ("Tower of knowledge") with a height of about 63 metres, houses the public library and the Volkshochschule, an adult education centre. It was designed by Franz Kneidinger and Heinz Stögmüller and opened in 2007. Lentos Art Museum, which opened in 2003, was designed by Zürich-based architects Weber & Hofer and the Musiktheater (music theatre), which opened in 2013, was designed by Terry Pawson.|$|E
25|$|At 3:30p.m. on February 13, 1966, a fire {{broke out}} in a greasy flue {{in the kitchen of}} the {{terminal}} building's second-floor restaurant, The Sky Room. Fanned by gusty winds, the fire spread through the terminal and control tower. Controllers in the tower were able to escape on an aerial ladder and air traffic was diverted to nearby Van Nuys Airport and Los Angeles International Airport for several hours. A controller communicated with aircraft using the radio in a light airplane belonging to Sky Roamers Air Travel, a flying club whose hangar was just east of the control tower. The fire, contained by about 6:30p.m., caused an estimated $2 million in damages to the <b>terminal,</b> <b>tower</b> and equipment in the tower. No injuries were reported.|$|E
50|$|In 1966, <b>Terminal</b> <b>Towers</b> {{including}} a new eight-storey Holiday Inn opened {{on the site of}} the old transit terminal between King and Main at Catharine Street. It's now called Effort Square and the hotel is a Hamilton Plaza.|$|R
50|$|The Jersey County Courthouse, {{located on}} 201 W. Pearl Street in Jerseyville, is Jersey County, Illinois' county {{courthouse}}. Built in 1893 - 94, the 124 foot (37.8 meter) tall courthouse {{was the third}} used by the county since its formation in 1839. Architect Henry Elliott designed the building in the Romanesque Revival style. The building's design features a tall central tower topped by an octagonal cupola, <b>terminal</b> <b>towers</b> at the front corners, and a raised front porch. The building's limestone exterior, which is intricately decorated on the front face, uses stone quarried at the nearby city of Grafton. Elliott also designed the Greene County Courthouse, the Edgar County Courthouse, and the Pike County Courthouse in Illinois, and he incorporated elements of those designs into the Jersey County Courthouse; for instance, its octagonal rotunda and <b>terminal</b> <b>towers</b> were inspired by the Edgar County Courthouse.|$|R

500|$|Cleveland, {{the second-largest}} {{city in the}} U.S. state of Ohio, is home to 142 {{completed}} high-rises, 33of which stand taller than [...] The tallest building in Cleveland is the 57-story Key Tower, which rises [...] on Public Square. The tower has been the tallest building {{in the state of}} Ohio since its completion in 1991, and it also stood as the tallest building in the United States between Chicago and New York City prior to the 2007 completion of the Comcast Center in Philadelphia. The <b>Terminal</b> <b>Tower,</b> which rises , stands as the second-tallest building in the city and the state; {{at the time of its}} completion, the building was the tallest in the world outside New York City.|$|E
500|$|The {{history of}} skyscrapers in Cleveland began in 1889 with the {{construction}} of the Society for Savings Building, often regarded as the first skyscraper in the city. Cleveland went through an early building boom in the late 1920s and early 1930s, during which several high-rise buildings, including the <b>Terminal</b> <b>Tower,</b> were constructed. The city experienced a second, much larger building boom that lasted from the early 1970s to early 1990s, during which time it saw the construction of over 15skyscrapers, including the Key Tower and 200 Public Square. Overall, the city is the site of three of the four Ohio skyscrapers that rise at least [...] in height; Cincinnati contains the other. [...] , the skyline of Cleveland is 27th in the United States and 96th in the world with 16buildings rising at least [...] in height.|$|E
500|$|Cleveland's {{downtown}} {{architecture is}} diverse. Many of the city's government and civic buildings, including City Hall, the Cuyahoga County Courthouse, the Cleveland Public Library, and Public Auditorium, are clustered around an open mall and {{share a common}} neoclassical architecture. Built in the early 20th century, they {{are the result of}} the 1903 Group Plan, and constitute one of the most complete examples of City Beautiful design in the United States. The <b>Terminal</b> <b>Tower,</b> dedicated in 1930, was the tallest building in North America outside New York City until 1964 and the tallest in the city until 1991. It is a prototypical Beaux-Arts skyscraper. The two newer skyscrapers on Public Square, Key Tower (currently the tallest building in Ohio) and the 200 Public Square, combine elements of Art Deco architecture with postmodern designs. Another of Cleveland's architectural treasures is The Arcade (sometimes called the Old Arcade), a five-story arcade built in 1890 and renovated in 2001 as a Hyatt Regency Hotel. Cleveland's landmark ecclesiastical architecture includes the historic Old Stone Church in downtown Cleveland and the onion domed St. Theodosius Russian Orthodox Cathedral in Tremont, along with myriad ethnically inspired Roman Catholic churches. Running east from Public Square through University Circle is Euclid Avenue, which was known for its prestige and elegance. In the late 1880s, writer Bayard Taylor described it as [...] "the most beautiful street in the world". Known as [...] "Millionaire's Row", Euclid Avenue was world-renowned as the home of such internationally known names as Rockefeller, Hanna, and Hay.|$|E

2500|$|Rapid {{development}} of Cleveland's downtown, particularly the <b>Terminal</b> <b>Tower</b> complex (which began construction in 1926), displaced these residents and shops and drove them eastward. By {{the end of}} the 1920s, a much larger and more permanent enclave had formed around the intersection of Rockwell Avenue and E. 22th Street and the name [...] "Chinatown" [...] began {{to be used in the}} 1920s to describe the area.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1958, Otis & Co., a local {{investment}} firm, proposed {{constructing the}} convention center atop Cleveland Union Terminal, the railroad and mass transit station linked to <b>Terminal</b> <b>Tower.</b> The investment company pledged to build the hotel and office building if the city bought the terminal for $20 million ($ in [...] dollars).

[...] Public Square is also home to the historic Old Stone Church, completed in 1855. [...] The west side of Public Square was to become the headquarters of the Cleveland Trust Company, then called Ameritrust, but the project was cancelled after Ameritrust was purchased and merged into Key Bank, leaving that side of the square open to this day, with only a surface parking lot on the site. [...] The classic Higbee's department store building is home to the Jack Cleveland Casino, since its opening on May 14, 2012.|$|E
60|$|The ship, however, was {{not wholly}} deserted. The {{proprietor}} of the boarding-house, a Mrs. Duke, {{was one of those}} helpless persons against whom fate wars in vain; she smiled vaguely both before and after all her calamities; she was too soft to be hurt. But by the aid (or rather under the orders) of a strenuous niece she always kept the remains of a clientele, mostly of young but listless folks.

50|$|Since 1870, Central Station, {{which also}} housed a courtroom, had been located at King William {{on the west}} side of Mary Street. It {{remained}} in use until 1910, when it was replaced by a smaller building. In 1930, a new Central Station was built. Like its predecessor, the new building contained a Police Court room. It retained its dual role until 1966, when the court was relocated to the new <b>Terminal</b> <b>Towers</b> building on Main Street, east of Catherine. The Station would remain in operation and serve as Regional headquarters until 1977 when police operations were moved to the current headquarters building across Mary Street at 155 King William Street.|$|R
5000|$|In 1976, CHAM {{was sold}} to Keith Dancy and the station adopted a [...] "gold and great" [...] format under the CJJD call sign. Soon afterward, the station's {{facilities}} were moved out of <b>Terminal</b> <b>Towers</b> (and the public eye) and up a few blocks to Lloyd D. Jackson Square. For one year in 1978, the station held the radio broadcast rights to the Hamilton Tiger-Cats football team; between the team's creation in 1950 and 2014, {{it was the only}} year in which the Tiger-Cats were not heard on longtime CHML (Tiger-Cats broadcasts, along with all other sports broadcasts in Hamilton, were acquired by TSN Radio 1150 in 2015).|$|R
50|$|In the 1980s, {{developers}} sought {{approval to}} make their proposed BP Building taller than the <b>Terminal</b> <b>Tower,</b> but city officials forced them to scale it down.
