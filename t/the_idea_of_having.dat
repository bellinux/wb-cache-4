Before long, the {{boarders}} learn that police are seeking Vautrin, revealed to be a master criminal nicknamed Trompe-la-Mort ("Cheater of Death"). Vautrin arranges for a friend to kill Victorine's brother, in the meantime, and is captured by the police.|$|E
5|$|They were {{determined}} to thwart any similar tendencies in his son, and when the Great Fire threatened the City, they refused the offers that Charles made of soldiers and other resources. Even in such an emergency, <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> the unpopular Royal troops ordered into the City was political dynamite. By the time that Charles took over command from the ineffectual Lord Mayor, the fire was already out of control.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{wound up}} being {{faithful}} to the comics, many designs were made for Spider-Man's costumes: one concept costume designer James Acheson became fond of <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> a red emblem over a black costume. Another, which would eventually lead to the final product, featured an enlarged logo on the chest and red stripes going {{down the sides of}} the legs. To create Spider-Man's costume, Maguire was fitted for the skintight suit, being covered with layers of substance to create the suit's shape. It was designed as a single piece, except for the mask. The webbing, which accented the costume, was cut by computer. The mask eye lenses were designed to have a mirror look.|$|E

50|$|Przemko II, however, didn't {{intend to}} abandon <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>have</b> his own offspring, because by March 1326, {{he had already}} married with Constance (b. ca. 1313 - d. by 21 November 1363), {{daughter}} of Duke Bernard of Świdnica. Thanks to this union, Przemko II became more closer to Władysław I the Elbow-high: he was the maternal grandfather of Constance.|$|R

Folkvord, along with Torstein Dahle, {{were the only}} representatives from the party who had a chance of gaining a seat in parliament. Jens Stoltenberg, leader of the Labour Party, was negative towards <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> any representatives from the Red Electoral Alliance in parliament, saying that the voters should do anything {{in their power to}} stop them from earning a seat in parliament.

5|$|Betances openly hated Estrada when {{he first}} met him in the late 1870s, but grew more {{tolerant}} of him with time, and even defended Estrada's actions as leader when he assumed control of the Cuban Revolutionary Party. The Puerto Rican affiliates to the Party viewed Estrada's leadership with great skepticism, since Estrada sympathized with <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> the United States intervene in the Cuban independence war to have the Spanish evicted from Cuba. They suspected that his weak leadership allowed opportunists to profit from an invasion and even suggest that the United States keep Puerto Rico in exchange for independence for Cuba. Some written evidence points {{to the truth of}} their affirmations, at least to the extent of wanting to have the Puerto Rican section of the Cuban Revolutionary Party shut down, which eventually did happen.|$|E
5|$|In June 1995, then-Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong asked PA {{to study}} <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> {{community}} centres share their premises with other civil users such as libraries, government offices and commercial developments. Goh, {{who is also}} a Member of Parliament for Marine Parade Group Representation Constituency, suggested combining the Marine Parade Community Club, which was slated for upgrading, with the National Library branch in Marine Parade, in a six-storey building with three floors for the community club and three for the library. In June 1996, Wong Kan Seng, PA's deputy chairman, announced that due to the scarcity of land in Singapore, eight of the redeveloped community centres, including Marine Parade Community Club, would be located with other civil users.|$|E

5|$|In March 2015, Beyoncé {{became a}} co-owner, with other artists, {{of the music}} {{streaming}} service Tidal. The service specializes in lossless audio and high definition music videos. Beyoncé's husband Jay-Z acquired {{the parent company of}} Tidal, Aspiro, {{in the first quarter of}} 2015. Including Beyoncé and Jay-Z, sixteen artist stakeholders (such as Kanye West, Rihanna, Madonna, Chris Martin, Nicki Minaj and more) co-own Tidal, with the majority owning a 3% equity stake. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> an all artist owned streaming service was created by those involved to adapt to the increased demand for streaming within the current music industry.|$|E
5|$|In September, {{one of the}} {{aircraft}} was displayed at Farnborough Airshow, and Norsk Forurensningskontroll stated that they hoped to sell the technology abroad. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> an oil spill services of this type was eventually abandoned by the authorities and by the oil industry, and instead NFK started using their aircraft for various charter purposes, such as bird counting for universities and parachuting. In 1986, the company gained {{a contract with the}} French government for supplying a French–Canadian semi-military female expedition, aiming to traverse the polar basin from the northernmost tip of Svalbard to the North Pole on skis. The aircraft was based in Svalbard, {{and a number of other}} scientific and exploration expeditions were supported, including electronic mapping of the headrock underneath glaciers, under a contract for the Scott Polar Research Institute at Cambridge University, financed by British Petroleum.|$|E
5|$|Lynette grows {{increasingly}} weary at <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> more children. She {{confesses to}} Tom {{that while she}} began loving her other children before they were born, {{she does not have}} the same feelings for her unborn twins. Tom assures her that she will love them once she is able to hold them in her arms. At Lynette's request, the couple conceals the pregnancy from their family and friends. Meanwhile, Gabrielle is irritated with Ana's poor attitude, provocative wardrobe, and disregard for her curfew or other rules. Carlos insists that Gabrielle sign a contract that would make her Ana's legal guardian, but she refuses. However, when Ana expresses interest in becoming a model, Gabrielle understands that they are more alike than she initially thought and signs the guardianship documents.|$|E

5|$|The Carnival of the Animals, Finale was {{directed}} by Goldberg; his wife Susan was its art director. The idea originated from animator Joe Grant, {{one of the two}} story directors on Fantasia who loved the ostriches in Dance of the Hours. When development for Fantasia 2000 began, Grant suggested <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> one of the ostriches play with a yo-yo to the last movement of The Carnival of the Animals. The ostriches were later changed to flamingos as Disney wished to avoid reintroducing characters from the original film and thought flamingos would look more colorful on the screen. Goldberg was partly inspired by co-director Mike Gabriel, who would play with a yo-yo as he took a break from working on Pocahontas (1995). The segment was produced with CGI and 6,000 watercolor paintings on heavy bond paper.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{conceived}} when Tetsuya Mizuguchi asked Masahiro Sakurai {{to make a}} falling block puzzle. Believing that the genre had not evolved since Tetris Attack (1995), Sakurai came up with <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> the blocks fall and shooting back up. The game's prototype was created in three days by a designer, a programmer, and a graphic artist. It {{was inspired by the}} TV series 24, the film The Matrix, and the Missile Command game. According to Mizuguchi, 24 camera work and the beginning of The Matrix (with dripping, green computer code) were the basis of the puzzle-game concept. In a Famitsu interview, Sakurai said that the opening CG video explaining its backstory was added to provide a sense of the game's world.|$|E
5|$|The late 1960s, Radio Pakistan and PTV were {{broadcasting}} commentary only in English, {{which was}} not clearly understandable to most Pakistani cricket fans.

He started commentating in Urdu during the 1969 Jang Gold Cup final, a match between National Sports and Clifton Gymkhana played at the Youth Centre, Nazimabad; in the match 13 Pakistani Test cricketers were playing. Hussain started commentating in Urdu commentary which distinguished him from his contemporaries. His distinguished Urdu commentary career spanned several decades, from the 1970s to the 2000s.|$|E

5|$|The {{pattern of}} {{intermarriage}} continued, as many KMT soldiers married aboriginal {{women who were}} from poorer areas and could be easily bought as wives. Modern studies show {{a high degree of}} genetic intermixing. Despite this, many contemporary Taiwanese are unwilling to entertain <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> an aboriginal heritage. In a 1994 study, it was found that 71% of the families surveyed would object to their daughter marrying an aboriginal man. For much of the KMT era the government definition of aboriginal identity had been 100% aboriginal parentage, leaving any intermarriage resulting in a non-aboriginal child. Later the policy was adjusted to the ethnic status of the father determining the status of the child.|$|E
5|$|The {{planetary}} {{exploration of}} the original Mass Effect was completely revamped. Instead of having large barren landscapes, the designers opted to build distinct and interesting places. The goal was to encourage players to keep exploring the galaxy by changing their expectations about what they could find. Originally, developers experimented with <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> a vehicle {{that could be used}} to navigate the planetary terrain in a more flexible way than in the original title. However, the vehicle was ultimately removed from the final build of the game. The context-sensitive interrupt system, which was originally meant to be a feature in the original Mass Effect, was introduced in Mass Effect 2 to help blend the dialogue better with the rest of the action.|$|E
5|$|After some time, {{they decided}} that the best method of {{featuring}} a vacuum bag {{was to have a}} cleaning lady vacuuming up the evidence. Whereas cleaning ladies had already been the murder victims of several previous episodes, here it seemed absolutely necessary if they wanted an episode to have a realistic plot. However, the writers believed that having a maid as the victim required a main character to work with in order to give some personal involvement. Monk was not considered mostly because he does not have a cleaning lady, and if he did, she would never be good enough for him because of his germophobia and meticulousness. It was eventually decided that the maid would be Dr. Kroger's employee. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> her work for Dr. Kroger was successful, because the writers had been looking to have an episode where Kamel would be the focus.|$|E

5|$|Hergé's {{depiction}} of Bianca Casfafiore in the story– a famous opera singer, {{pursued by the}} press, and changing her outfit for every occasion– {{was influenced by the}} life of the opera singer Maria Callas. One of the new characters that Hergé introduced into the story was the stonemason Arthur Bolt (M. Boullu in the original French version), whose characterisation was based on a real individual who worked for Hergé. Hergé's {{depiction of}} the paparazzi within the story may have been influenced by his own repeat encounters with the press throughout his career. The reporter and the photographer, Christopher Willoughby-Droupe and Marco Rizotto (Jean-Loup de la Battelerie and Walter Rizotto respectively in the original French version) of the Paris Flash, are introduced into the series here, and would later be retroactively added into a re-drawing of The Black Island (1938) by Bob de Moor, also making a reappearance in Tintin and the Picaros (1976). <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> a proposed marriage between Castafiore and Haddock was based on a reader's suggestion that Haddock marry.|$|E

Kelly was impressed by her performance and JKP offered Haze an exclusive performing contract.

In 2004, she appeared on the HBO show Pornucopia, a six-part documentary on the pornography industry in California.|$|E
5|$|Mandodari is {{described}} as a beautiful woman in Valmiki's Ramayana. When Hanuman, the monkey messenger of Rama, comes to Lanka in search of Sita, he is stupefied by Mandodari's beauty when he enters Ravana's bed chambers and mistakes Mandodari for Sita. When Hanuman finally finds Sita, he finds Ravana threatening to kill Sita unless she marries him. Ravana raises his sword to behead Sita when she refuses. Mandodari saves Sita by holding Ravana's hand. Mandodari says that the murder of a woman is a heinous sin and thus Ravana should not kill Sita. She asks Ravana to entertain himself with his other wives and give up <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> Sita as his wife. Ravana spares Sita's life, but does not give up his wish to marry Sita. Though Mandodari considers Sita inferior to her in beauty and ancestry, Mandodari acknowledges Sita's devotion to Rama and compares her to goddesses like Sachi and Rohini.|$|E
