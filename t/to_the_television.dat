5|$|After {{graduating from}} Oxford, Hooper {{directed}} further television commercials, intending {{to break into}} the film industry the same way Ridley Scott, Tony Scott and Hugh Hudson did. He was introduced by his father <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>television</b> producer Matthew Robinson, who mentored Hooper and gave him his first television directing work. For Robinson, Hooper directed episodes of the short-lived Tyne Tees Television soap opera Quayside in 1997, four episodes of the Children's BBC television series Byker Grove in the same year, and his first episodes of the BBC One soap opera EastEnders in 1998.|$|E

5|$|Annette O'Toole plays Martha Kent, Clark's adoptive mother. She and her husband, Jonathan, give Clark wise {{advice about}} coping with his {{increasing}} abilities. In season five Martha takes a state-senate seat, and in season six {{she leaves the}} show.

O'Toole was committed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>television</b> series The Huntress when Ettinger filmed the original pilot. Around the time the creators wanted to recast Martha Kent when The Huntress was canceled, allowing O'Toole to join the cast. The actress had played Lana Lang in Superman III.|$|E

Wrestlers were portrayed as either villains or heroes in the scripted events that built tension and culminated into a wrestling match or series of matches and competed either under their real names or stage names. The event featured wrestlers from WWE's Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brands—a storyline division in which WWE employees are assigned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>television</b> program of the same name.|$|E
5|$|During {{the long}} history of the British science fiction {{television}} programme Doctor Who, a number of stories were proposed but, for a variety of reasons, never fully produced. Below is a list of unmade serials which were submitted by recognised professional writers and the BBC had intended to produce, but {{for one reason or another}} were not made.

5|$|Game Capture HD, which {{connects to}} gaming {{consoles}} to record gameplay, {{was introduced in}} 2012.

It captures video as the console sends it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>television,</b> compresses and stores it. A review in iPhone Life gave it 4 out of 5 stars and noted that it could also be used to record iPad games with the right setup.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to the allegations, Sony stated that the game was not based on reality, and they believed they had adequate permissions necessary.

Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair commented that though companies should have more responsibility and sensitivity to the feelings of others, the issue would be immensely difficult. Although the copyright concerns {{were found to be}} without merit, Sony offered a formal apology to the Church of England and leaders of the cathedral in July 2007, stating that they did not intend to cause offence.|$|E

After being contacted repeatedly by All Souls producers, he read for the parts of Fortado and Sterling; he had to go through the lines a total of five times. During the audition, he met and talked to Aaron Spelling. After failing to be cast in The Street, Rodriquez committed to portraying Fortado.

5|$|The opera's appeal lay {{not only}} in its story about a {{crippled}} shepherd boy healed on the first Christmas Eve but in its wedding of opera and the limitations of television. The broad effects of theater were eschewed and instead an intimacy appropriate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>television</b> studio and home viewing was cultivated. The production starred Chet Allen as Amahl and Rosemary Kuhlmann as his mother. Kuhlmann reprised her role annually for many years.|$|E
5|$|The {{programme}} {{has often}} been compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>television</b> panel game QI. Both were co-created by Lloyd, several of the Museum's 'curators' and comic guests have appeared regularly on QI, and the QI Elves (QI's research team, who provide hosts Stephen Fry and Sandi Toksvig with live information as required during the programme) provide the research. As a result, some critics consider the radio show to be a spin-off of the TV programme, and some have further ventured that The Museum of Curiosity {{is not as good}} as its forerunner. Most reviews of The Museum of Curiosity, however, are positive.|$|E
