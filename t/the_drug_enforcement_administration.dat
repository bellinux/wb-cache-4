McVeigh's criterion for potential attack sites was that the target should house at least two of three federal law enforcement agencies: the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), or <b>the</b> <b>Drug</b> <b>Enforcement</b> <b>Administration</b> (DEA).

5|$|Treviño Morales {{reportedly}} coordinated several violent attacks throughout Mexico, {{including the}} murder of 72 migrants in 2010 and the massacre of 193 people a year later in San Fernando, Tamaulipas.

Although it {{was not the first time}} Calderón received death threats from organized crime, the authorities deemed the drug lord's threat as credible, and urged the President to cancel his trip (though he ultimately went anyway). Under Treviño Morales' leadership, Los Zetas were considered by <b>the</b> <b>Drug</b> <b>Enforcement</b> <b>Administration</b> (DEA) to be highly sophisticated, advanced, and one of the most dangerous criminal organizations operating in Mexico and the hemisphere.
