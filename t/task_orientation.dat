40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the relationship between achievement goal orientation and perceptions of motivational climate in track runner and distance university students. For this reason, 38 College runners including 20 Distance Runner (11 males and 9 females) and 18 Sprint Runner (8 males and 10 females) were selected by random sampling. Data collection was performed by two Achievement Goal Orientation (AGOQ) and Perceived Motivational Climate Questionnaires (PMCQ). Result showed that there arenâ€™t significant differences between ego and <b>task</b> <b>orientations</b> and mastery and performance climate perceptions in distance and sprint runners while significant differences were observed between ego and <b>task</b> <b>orientations</b> in distance and sprint runners. Also there was significant and positive relationship between ego orientation and performance climate perceptions in distance runners (r= 0. 476, P< 0. 05). Furthermore, significant positive relationships were observed between ego and <b>task</b> <b>orientations</b> (r= 0. 721, P< 0. 05), and ego orientation and performance climate perceptions (r= 0. 48, P< 0. 05) in sprint runners...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSocial cues are {{of general}} {{importance}} in human attention. Even {{when presented with}} task-oriented stimuli, social cues are preferred. In <b>orientation</b> <b>tasks,</b> the degree {{of the impact of}} social cues on the perception of signal cues is of high relevance for the behavior, such as in evacuation tasks. Therefore, we investigated the degree of this impact, using free-viewing and <b>orientation</b> <b>task</b> driven stimuli. To investigate the shift of attention in further detail, single persons and groups of persons were set into conflict with signage cues. In the experimental eye tracking study, images of an evacuation guidance system were displayed with appearance of guidance-related signs as well as with appearances of persons. To test the influence of group size, the number of depicted persons was varied. The scenes were observed, alternatively, (i) under free-viewing conditions and (ii) in an <b>orientation</b> <b>task.</b> From {{the results of the study}} we conclude that in <b>orientation</b> <b>tasks</b> there is a shift of attention from social to signage cues, while larger group sizes support the attention shift towards social cues...|$|R
50|$|Social {{presence}} {{is a significant}} feature for improving instructional effectiveness in any setting, {{and one of the}} most significant features of distance education. Tu (2000,2001) argued that within distance learning, social presence rests upon three dimensions, social context, online communication, and interactivity. Social contexts contribute to a predictable degree of perceived social presence. Social contexts involve <b>task</b> <b>orientation</b> (Steinfield, 1986), privacy (Steinfield, 1986), topics (Argyle and Dean, 1965; Walther, 1992), social relationships (Walther, 1992) and social process (Walther, 1992). As an example, when a conversation is task based and public without a sense of community being in place, the perception of social {{presence is}} low and affective filter (a communication blockage brought about by negative emotional feelings) is high.|$|E
50|$|There {{is another}} main {{perspective}} {{that leads to}} a larger gap between the supervisors and subordinates. In a high power distance environment, supervisors tend to pay more attention on tasks rather than human beings that are the main focus for supervisors in a low power distance environment. Apparently, <b>task</b> <b>orientation</b> emphasizes heavily on daily work completion and performance efficiency, yet the top-bottom relationship grows far more slowly since {{there is a lack of}} communication beyond work, which in turn reduces subordinatesâ€™ willingness of seeking help from supervisors. Compared to low power distance countries, equality is embraced by the society that power is minimized to a large extent, where authority and hierarchy are not highlighted and supervisors are accessible and willing to build close relationship with subordinates, whose worries of any harm are turned down when seeking help from the top.|$|E
5000|$|In 2012 and 2013, {{the concept}} of 'Coopetitive Knowledge Sharing' was {{inspired}} by inter-organization research literature toward developing a Coopetitive Model of Knowledge Sharing that explains (1) how coopetition should be conceptualized, (2) What forms coopetition (three formative constructs of outcome (goal, reward), means (task related), boundary (friendship, geographical closeness, sense of team belonging) interdependencies), and (3) How coopetition and its interrelated components interact and influence knowledge sharing behaviors in cross-functional software teams. This series of publications in the Journal of Systems and Software and Information Processing & Management conceptualize and operationalize the multi-dimensional construct of cross-functional coopetition and presents an instrument for measuring this construct.

40|$|Locke and Latham (1985) {{hypothesised}} that {{goals are}} more efficiently attained {{when they are}} perceived to be difficult but realistic to achieve. Furthermore, goal orientation is believed to be a strong determinant of effort exertion and adherence in performing tasks. To verify these two concepts, in real-life situations, 28 young female runners (13 â€“ 16 years) were blocked (randomly assigned) to one of three goal-difficulty conditions over a 4 -week period: easy, difficult/realistic, and improbable/unattainable. Short-term goals for each condition were set (1. 25 %, 2. 5 %, and 3. 75 % improvement per week, respectively), as were long-term goals (5 %, 10 %, and 15 % overall improvement, respectively). Participants completed the <b>Task</b> and Ego <b>Orientation</b> in Sport Questionnaire prior to the goal intervention. Locke and Latham's (1985) goal attainability hypothesis was not supported by the results of the study, as athletes enhanced their running performance equally regardless of their specific goals. Both ego and <b>task</b> <b>orientations</b> were found to be moderately but significantly correlated with running improvement rate. However, <b>task</b> and ego <b>orientation</b> were found to be significantly correlated to each other, indicating that, in this sample of athletes, these two orientations were not independent of each other.

50|$|These {{four basic}} styles {{represent}} {{four types of}} managerial behavior. Reddin was clear that not all types of managerial behavior fit cleanly into these four types, but served as the general framework for his 3D Theory. Since no one managerial style is always effective, and his research showed {{that any of these}} four basic styles could be effective in certain situations and not effective in others. The effectiveness was contingent on the situation in which they are applied. Effectiveness is the third dimension - each one of the four basic styles has a less effective equivalent and a more effective equivalent. Therefore, these 8 managerial styles are not 8 additional kinds of management behavior. These are the names given to the four basic style when used effectively or appropriately, or less effectively.

40|$|Self-regulatory {{capacities}} {{are often}} investigated {{in a laboratory}} setting, using test batteries that measure executive functions (EF), which are believed to underlie self-regulatory capacities. However, {{to gain a better}} understanding of the (self-regulatory) problems caused by deficits in EF skills in real life situations, it may be beneficial to observe these capacities in a more naturalistic environment, like a classroom. Therefore, in the present study, it was examined how various components of EF (inhibition, working memory, and shifting) are related to classroom <b>task</b> <b>orientation</b> in preschoolers with attention problems. We hypothesized that inhibition and working memory would have the largest effect on <b>task</b> <b>orientation.</b> The sample consisted of 65 preschoolers with attention problems (aged 35 - 46 months). EF were measured using diagnostic tasks from a neuropsychological test battery. To observe self-regulatory capacities in the classroom, we employed the <b>task</b> <b>orientation</b> scale of the PC BOS. Only inhibition was found to be significantly (and negatively) related to <b>task</b> <b>orientation</b> and had a medium effect on <b>task</b> <b>orientation.</b> These results suggest that primarily the ability to inhibit impulses and responses to distracters is of importance in task situations in a preschool setting in preschoolers with attention problems...|$|E

40|$|Background. Academic self-handicapping {{refers to}} the use of impediments to {{successful}} performance on academic tasks. Previous studies have shown that it is related to personal achievement goals. A performance goal orientation is a positive predictor of self-handicapping, whereas a <b>task</b> goal <b>orientation</b> is unrelated to selfhandicapping. Aims. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the relationship between academic selfhandicapping, goal <b>orientations</b> (<b>task,</b> performance-approach, performance-avoidance), social goals, future consequences and achievement in mathematics. An additional aim was to investigate grade-level and gender differences in relation to academic self-handicapping. Sample. Participants were 702 upper elementary, junior and senior high school students with approximately equal numbers of girls and boys. Results. There were no grade-level or gender differences as regards the use of self-handicapping. The correlations among the variables revealed that, when the whole sample was considered, self-handicapping was positively related to performance goal orientations and pleasing significant others and negatively to achievement in mathematics. The results of hierarchical regression analysis showed that, in upper elementary and junior high schools, the association between achievement in mathematics and self-handicapping was mediated by performance-avoidance goals. In senior high school, only <b>task</b> goal <b>orientation</b> was a negative predictor of self-handicapping. Â© 2007 The British Psychological Society...|$|R
