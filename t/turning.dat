The creek then turns southeast for some distance before <b>turning</b> southwest and entering Wyoming. It then turns west-southwest for a few miles before <b>turning</b> south and then west. The creek then turns south again, crossing US Route 11. It then turns southwest for more than a mile, entering Forty Fort and reaching its confluence with the Susquehanna River.|$|E

5|$|The front {{landing gear}} is offset to the aircraft's right to allow {{placement}} of the 30mm cannon with its firing barrel along the centerline of the aircraft. During ground taxi, the offset front landing gear causes the A-10 to have dissimilar <b>turning</b> radii. <b>Turning</b> to the right on the ground takes less distance than <b>turning</b> left. The wheels of the main landing gear partially protrude from their nacelles when retracted, making gear-up belly landings easier to control and less damaging. All landing gears are hinged toward the aircraft's rear; if hydraulic power is lost, a combination of gravity and aerodynamic drag can open and lock the gear in place.|$|E

50|$|The car {{is now at}} Esplanade Bridge {{crossing}} the Singapore river, building up speed to 285 km/h. <b>Turn</b> 14 almost meets <b>turn</b> eight, diverting to the right at 78 km/h onto the Raffles Avenue (in front of Esplanade). Next, a series of mostly blind corners from <b>turn</b> 15 to 19. The cars approach {{to the front of}} the floating platform grandstand (<b>turn</b> 16 and 17), then goes under the floating platform grandstand (<b>turn</b> 18 and 19) at 80 km/h. At <b>turn</b> 18, cars must <b>turn</b> in at a specific angle, otherwise will brush or crash along the wall. <b>Turn</b> 20 and 21 is just right after Bayfront Avenue; a right-hand <b>turn</b> 20, then a left-hand <b>turn</b> 21 that leads the car towards <b>turn</b> 22. How fast the cars approach <b>turn</b> 22 is determined by the exit of <b>turn</b> 21, therefore most of the drivers exit <b>turn</b> 21 very close to the wall to gain a speed advantage. Running down towards <b>turn</b> 22 passes the 165m tall Singapore Flyer, where <b>turn</b> 22 and 23 is taken flat-out at about 180 km/h before picking up the throttle again towards the pit straight across the finish line.|$|R

5|$|Two {{unsettled}} historiographic debates exist {{revolving around}} the operation: whether the Egyptians were intending to advance toward Tel Aviv, which most historians agree {{was not the}} case; and whether the operation was a <b>turning</b> point on the Israeli southern front.

5|$|A {{featured}} preliminary {{match on}} <b>Turning</b> Point's card {{was for the}} TNA X Division Championship, in which the champion, Petey Williams, defended the championship against Chris Sabin. The match was promoted for <b>Turning</b> Point on the November 12 episode of Impact!. In the weeks leading to the encounter, Sabin stated {{he had found a}} counter to Williams' finishing maneuver the Canadian Destroyer, which was thought to be uncounterable. The Canadian Destroyer involves Williams grabbing an opponent with his legs around their head, jumping over their back, causing them to perform a backflip, and forcing their head into the mat after they make the full rotation. Making true to his word, Sabin countered the move three times before <b>Turning</b> Point; one on the November 12, one of the November 19, and the last on the November 30 episodes of Impact!.|$|E

Finally, the last <b>turn</b> is out onto Hackensack Plank Road which if going southbound, requires another 180Â° <b>turn</b> and ends the cobblestone portion of the street.

5|$|Behavioral {{researchers}} have found that a choice for instant versus delayed gratification is influenced by several factors including whether the reward is negative or positive reinforcement. A past study by Solnick et al., focused on an experiment where the main concentrations were time added to both conditions and the preference of the participants with experiencing a loud noise for variable amounts of time: 15, 30, 60, and 90 seconds. The buttons to turn off the noise were manipulated by one button <b>turning</b> off the noise for {{a short amount of time}} and the other <b>turning</b> the noise off for an extended time. The participants were found to be more willing to turn off the noise immediately for 90 seconds rather than <b>turning</b> it off for the 120 seconds after a 60-second delay was issued. Findings illustrate that participants chose not to delay their gratification for the relief of noise but rather instantly silence it for a shorter amount of time.|$|E
