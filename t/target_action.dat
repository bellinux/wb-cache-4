The present study examined sleep and the consolidation of gist in 12 -month-old infants using a deferred imitation paradigm. Sixty infants were randomly assigned to a nap, a no-nap or a baseline control condition. In the nap and no-nap conditions, infants watched demonstrations of the same <b>target</b> <b>actions</b> on three different hand puppets that shared some features. During a 4 -h delay, infants in the nap condition took a naturally scheduled nap while infants in the no-nap condition naturally stayed awake. Afterwards, infants were exposed to a novel forth hand puppet that combined some of the features from the previously encountered puppets. Only those infants who took a nap after learning produced a significantly higher number of <b>target</b> <b>actions</b> than infants in the baseline control condition who had not seen any demonstrations of <b>target</b> <b>actions.</b> Infants in the nap condition also produced significantly more <b>target</b> <b>actions</b> than infants in the no-nap condition.

50|$|Another {{theory that}} has been used to explain the {{mechanisms}} of prospective memory is the multi-process model proposed by McDaniel and Einstein (2005). This theory states that prospective memory retrieval does not always need an active monitoring process but can occur spontaneously (i.e., the occurrence of a cue can cause the intention to be retrieved, even when no preparatory attentional processes are engaged). Therefore, multiple processes can be used for successful prospective memory. Further, it was believed that it would be maladaptive to rely solely on active monitoring because it requires a lot of attentional resources. This may potentially interfere with other forms of processing that are required for different tasks during the retention interval. Prospective memory cues will lead to spontaneous retrieval of an intention when at least one of four conditions is met: the cue and <b>target</b> <b>action</b> are highly associated with each other, the cue is salient, the other processes performed during the period between cue and action of the prospective memory task direct attention to relevant cue features (e.g., task appropriate processing), or the intended action is simple.

40|$|We {{examined}} whether sleep quality {{during the}} night and naps during the day preceding a learning event are related to memory encoding in human infants. Twenty-four 6 - and twenty-four 12 -month-old infants 2 ̆ 7 natural sleeping behavior was monitored for 24 [*]hr using actigraphy.

Forty-one 12 -month-old infants {{were randomly assigned to}} a nap condition, a no-nap condition, or a baseline control condition. In a demonstration session, infants in the nap and no-nap condition watched an experimenter perform three <b>target</b> <b>actions</b> on a hand puppet. To enhance encoding opportunities, infants were allowed to practice the <b>target</b> <b>actions</b> three times immediately afterwards (Hayne et al., 2003). Flexibility of memory retrieval was assessed in a test session 4 -hr later with a puppet that was identical in shape but different in color from the one used during the demonstrations. Infants in the nap condition were scheduled to sleep (3 ̆e 30 min) during the 4 -hr interval while infants in the no-nap condition were naturally scheduled to stay awake. Sleeping behavior was monitored using actigraphy. Infants in the baseline-control condition only saw the stimuli during the test session to assess spontaneous production of the <b>target</b> <b>actions.</b> The results indicate that only infants in the nap condition performed a significantly higher number of <b>target</b> <b>actions</b> at test than infants in the baseline-control condition, t(20. 99) =- 2. 202, p=. 039. Our results point towards a facilitative effect of sleep on the flexibility of memory retrieval in 12 -month-old infants.

This is the first study to directly compare toddlers 2 ̆ 7 long-term retention rates for <b>target</b> <b>actions</b> learned from a video or book. Toddlers (N = 158) at 18 - and 24 -months of age saw an experimenter demonstrating how to make a novel three-step toy rattle via a prerecorded video or a picture book. The toddlers 2 ̆ 7 imitation of the <b>target</b> <b>actions</b> was tested after a specific delay (e. g., 2, 4 weeks), and their performance was compared with that of age-matched controls who did not see a demonstration. The 18 -month-olds retained the <b>target</b> <b>actions</b> for 2 weeks, exhibiting forgetting at 4 weeks, whereas the 24 -month-olds retained the information for up to 4 weeks, exhibiting forgetting at 8 weeks. Retention rates for books and videos did not differ at either age. These findings demonstrate very impressive retention from a brief two-dimensional media demonstration, and they contribute to our overall understanding of long-term memory processes during infancy.

40|$|Abstract In adults, the {{selection}} and the planning of actions {{are influenced by the}} anticipation of desired action effects. However, the role of action effects for action control in infants is still an unresolved issue. One important prerequisite for infants action control is that infants are able to relate certain movements to certain effects. To test this assumption, it was investigated how infants action control is affected by action effects. By applying an imitation paradigm, we studied 12 - and 18 -month-old infants who first observed an adult experi-menter demonstrating a three-step action sequence on a toy bear. In three experimental groups, the second ac-tion step, the third action step, or no action step elicited an arbitrary sound as an additional acoustic action ef-fect. It was coded how often each of the target actions was performed by the infant in a subsequent 90 -s test phase. As predicted, the frequency of the infants <b>target</b> <b>action</b> varied depending on which action step elicited the action effect. In both age groups, the <b>target</b> <b>action</b> that was combined with an acoustical effect was not only produced more often but also occurred with lower la-tency and was in most cases the first <b>target</b> <b>action</b> shown by the infants. These results are interpreted as evidence of the important role of action effects in infants action control...|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{researchers}} have been debating whether infants' selective imitative learning is primarily based on sensorimotor processes (e. g., motor resonance through action perception) or whether inferential processes such as teleological reasoning (i. e., reasoning about the efficiency of others' actions) predominantly explain selective imitation in infancy. The current study directly investigated two different theoretical notions employing the seminal and widely used head touch paradigm. In two conditions, we manipulated whether the action appeared to be efficient while motor resonance was optimized to enhance imitation performance in general. The results showed that infants imitated the <b>target</b> <b>action</b> {{to the same extent}} in both conditions irrespective of the action's efficiency. In addition, in both conditions, more infants imitated the head action than in an additional baseline condition or in a condition where the <b>target</b> <b>action</b> was performed by another effector.

40|$|When {{watching}} others describe events, does {{information from}} their speech and gestures affect our memory representations for the gist and surface {{form of the}} described events? Does our reliance on these memory representations change over time? Forty participants watched videos of stories narrated by an actor.

Participants had to reproduce target event sentences, prompted after delays of 2, 6, or 18 minutes. Seeing gestures, either congruent or incongruent, led to better gist recall (more mentions of the <b>target</b> <b>action,</b> more gestures for the <b>target</b> <b>action,</b> and more complete target events) compared to not seeing gestures. However, seeing incongruent gestures sometimes led to reproductions of the incongruent gestures, particularly after short delays, as well as inaccuracies in speech.

40|$|Introduction: the {{embodied}} cognition {{theories of}} language demonstrated {{the relationship between}} linguistic system and motor system. In the present study we investigated whether the action system produced a semantic response (N 400 ERP index) similar to the linguistic system. Methods: fifteen subject saw a sequence of action and performed an explicit task to distinguish congruous from incongruous final <b>target</b> <b>action.</b> Plausible or implausible actions were performed within a contextual frame. Subjects perceived a semantic anomaly, that was a final <b>target</b> <b>action</b> that was not adequate (unusual) (Experiment 1) or not correctly performed (incorrect) (Experiment 2) with respect of the semantic properties required for the central action-goal. Results: ERP analysis showed a significant N 400 -like effect more frontally distributed in response to incongruous conditions for both the Experiments. Nevertheless, a more temporo-parietal cortical distribution was observed {{in case of an}} unusual way to perform the object-related action more than in case of an incorrect way. Conclusions: the N 400 -like effect is similar in nature to that which is generally evoked by linguistic stimuli, and this result may support the explanation of a N 400 increasing based on the difficulty to access to the semantic memory. The temporo-parietal cortical distribution may be explained by assuming that in the Experiment 1 the relationship between the action and its intentional goals was violated...|$|E
