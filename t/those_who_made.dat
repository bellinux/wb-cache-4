Driving back to her office, Miranda spontaneously develops tumors all over her body and dies in her car.|$|E
5|$|Pollack {{believed}} {{that the success of}} the WSOP was not determined based upon the number of participants every year, but rather upon the players' experiences. For example, in 2007 the WSOP flattened its award structure. The cash awards were distributed more evenly so that people who went out earlier earned more money, while <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>made</b> it to the final table won less.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the living}} {{conditions}} of the Robinsons varied according {{to whether or not}} they had had time to prepare. There were roughly three days between the signing of the capitulation and the deadline for civilians to leave the city, during which <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>made</b> the decision to stay could stockpile food and water, and camouflage their hiding places. As time passed, supplies ran out, and many Robinsons had to change their locations for security reasons. The situation soon became equally desperate for all who remained.|$|E

5|$|The {{church is}} entered through the porch {{to the west}} end of the south wall of the nave, which leads to an arched doorway. There are two 18th-century slate plaques on the walls by the south door commemorating <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>made</b> {{donations}} to the poor of the parish; one has names from 1761, the other from 1766. On the opposite wall, a 17th-century slate plaque commemorates Hugh ap Richard Lewis and his wife Jane (died 1660 and 1661 respectively). The internal timbers of the roof, some of which are old, are exposed, but there is a decorated panelled barrel-vaulted ceiling above the sanctuary at the east end of the church. The transept roof is largely 17th-century.|$|E

25|$|That 1936-37 tour {{had proved}} a fairly chastening {{experience}} for England, {{who won the}} first two Tests but lost the final three, and so failed to regain The Ashes.

25|$|Following the Young Turk Revolution in 1908, the Committee of Union and Progress which {{effectively}} {{took control}} of the country sought to develop a strong Ottoman naval force.

25|$|Karaites at {{one time}} made up a {{significant}} proportion of the Jewish population. Estimates of the Karaite population are difficult to make because they believe on the basis of Genesis 32 that counting Jews is forbidden. Some 30–50,000 are thought to reside in the 21st century in Israel, with smaller communities in Turkey, Europe and the United States. Another estimate holds that, of the 50,000 worldwide, more than 40,000 descend from <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>made</b> aliyah from Egypt and Iraq to Israel.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in 1824, Cornish {{miners and}} English investors came to Pachuca and the {{neighboring}} town of Real del Monte to invest {{and work in}} the mines here. Some founded the Compañía Real de Monte y Pachuca. Mexico's remaining Cornish community represents a largely forgotten immigrant story. In the early 19th century, miners in Cornwall were enduring economic hardships. Ships carrying 125 passengers and some 1,500 tons of equipment sailed out of Falmouth, Cornwall, landing in Veracruz three months later. The treacherous 500-kilometre (300mi) trek inland killed about half of the miners and their family members, many succumbing to malaria and yellow fever. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>made</b> it settled in Pachuca and Real del Monte.|$|E
25|$|Hussey was implicated {{along with}} his cousin as complicit in the 1536 {{uprising}} known as the Pilgrimage of Grace. Though Hussey denied participation in the rebellion, {{he was accused of}} conspiring to change laws and depose the king, and that he abetted <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>made</b> war on the king in October 1536. The charges may have been levied in part because of Hussey's Catholic sympathies, and because Hussey and his wife, having served 'Princess' Mary, were partisans on her behalf. Hussey was indicted and tried for treason, and found guilty by the House of Lords. He was beheaded in Lincoln in 1536, while his cousin, Thomas Darcy, was executed on Tower Hill. Hussey's statement ("confession") survives.|$|E

25|$|<b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>made</b> {{their way}} up through the Valtournanche {{to the foot of}} the {{mountain}} were few in number. W. A. B. Coolidge, a diligent collector of old and new stories of the Alps, mentions that during those years, besides Brockedon, only Hirzel-Escher of Zürich, who crossed the Theodul Pass in 1822, starting from Breuil, accompanied by a local guide. The greater number came from the Valais up the Visp valley to Zermatt. In 1813, a Frenchman, Henri Maynard, climbed to the Theodul Pass and made the first ascent of the Breithorn; he was accompanied by numerous guides, among them J. M. Couttet of Chamonix, the same man who had gone with de Saussure to the top of the Klein Matterhorn in 1792.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} the 1930s, {{automobile}} travel had begun to cut into the rail passenger market, somewhat reducing economies of scale, {{but it was the}} development of the Interstate Highway System and of commercial aviation in the 1950s and 1960s, as well as increasingly restrictive regulation, that dealt the most damaging blows to rail transportation, both passenger and freight. General Motors and other were convicted of running the streetcar industry into the ground purposefully in what {{is referred to as the}} Great American Streetcar Scandal. There was little point in operating passenger trains to advertise freight service when <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>made</b> decisions about freight shipping traveled by car and by air, and when the railroads' chief competitors for that market were interstate trucking companies.|$|E
25|$|In early 2007, viewers {{watched as}} JR's mother, who had {{recently}} been discovered alive, is murdered by the serial killer in pursuit of Babe. Though Babe is the serial killer's actual target, Dixie dies in her place. JR originally takes comfort in still having Babe at his side, and vows not to blame her for Dixie's death. This later changes when the series showcases JR witness a kiss between Babe and Josh. Babe explains the kiss as a goodbye gesture, but JR is adamant on making her suffer. When Babe is later attacked by the serial killer, however, she is presumed dead, except by <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>made</b> her body appear lifeless {{in order to keep}} the serial killer from attacking her again. The writers scripted JR as having a difficult time dealing with Babe's perceived death, but eventually reunited the two.|$|E
