30|$|During the 1970 ’s, the {{understanding}} of CSR was influenced by social movements and <b>new</b> <b>legislations.</b> This {{was reflected in the}} academic publications which provided companies with an approach that looked into how to comply with <b>the</b> <b>new</b> responsibilities that have been given to them by <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>legislations</b> that now covered environmental aspects as well as product safety, and labor rights (Carroll 2008). This gave way to the 1980 ’s where the discussion revolved on the ways for implementing CSR.|$|R

5|$|A {{group of}} {{anomalous}} units, as mentioned above, {{had not been}} transferred into the new system; these were the two Irish Yeomanry regiments and the Volunteers of Bermuda and the Isle of Man. The decision had been taken to have no Territorial Force units in Ireland and so the two yeomanry regiments were disbanded and reconstituted in the Special Reserve as the North Irish Horse and South Irish Horse. The Isle of Man Volunteers and Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps remained organised as Volunteers; whilst <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>legislation</b> did extend to the Isle of Man, the force was not reorganised there {{partly due to the}} difficulty of changing to annual training. Bermuda, the Channel Islands and Malta were not encompassed by the scope of the legislation, and so the Militia there continued to operate under the old system.|$|E
5|$|Elliott {{embarked}} for Australia on the RMS Orontes on 15 May 1919, {{sharing a}} cabin {{with an old}} friend, Brigadier General Gordon Bennett. They arrived back in Melbourne on 28 June, and his AIF appointment was terminated the following day. He contested the federal election {{as a candidate for}} the Nationalist Party of Australia on 13 December 1919. He achieved the greatest popular vote of any Victorian candidate for the Senate. Moreover, he repeated this success at the 1925 election. Although not naturally suited to life in the federal parliament, he made significant contributions, and was outspoken in his efforts to assist returned servicemen, particularly those with whom he had served. This outspokenness often took the form of arguing in the Senate in relation to <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>legislation</b> being brought before it, when such legislation involved the defence forces. At other times, he would personally champion the cause of those men who had been in his battalion.|$|E
5|$|In June 1873, around 30 {{members of}} the Assiniboine First Nation {{were killed in the}} Cypress Hills Massacre, {{creating}} a national furore. In response, Macdonald used a Privy Council order to enact <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>legislation,</b> formally creating the North-West Mounted Police with the intention of mobilising the force and deploying it early the next year. A report then arrived from Alexander Morris, the Lieutenant Governor of the North-West Territories, blaming the massacre on the activities of whiskey traders at Fort Whoop-Up; Morris predicted that if action was not taken immediately, there would be a major uprising by the First Nations across the region, into which the United States might choose to intervene. Macdonald was not entirely convinced by the governor's analysis, but nonetheless he agreed to recruit 150 men and send them west to Lower Fort Garry before winter weather blocked the route.|$|E

5|$|On September 13, 2012, {{long time}} Tory MHA and former cabinet {{minister}} Tom Osborne {{announced he was}} leaving the PC Party to sit as an independent. He cited Dunderdale's leadership {{as the reason for}} his defection and said that the turning point for him was the debate over Bill 29. Osborne said that while he voted in favour of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>legislation</b> he did not support it. On October 19, 2012, Dunderdale shuffled her cabinet and Justice Minister Felix Collins, who was responsible for Bill 29, was shuffled out of the Justice portfolio and became Minister of Intergovernmental and Aboriginal Affairs. Though the portfolio change was considered to be a demotion Dunderdale stated that Collins' handling of Bill 29 was not connected to his move. At the time of the cabinet shuffle Dunderdale also created the Office of Public Engagement, which will bring together different departments to aid in communications efforts. The new office will also be responsible for access to information.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} {{division of}} Croatia into counties was abolished in 1922, when the oblasts of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes were introduced; these were later {{replaced by the}} banovinas of Yugoslavia. Socialist Republic of Croatia, as a constituent part of post-World War II Yugoslavia had approximately 100 municipalities as main governmental units and local government entities. The counties were reintroduced in 1992, but with significant territorial alterations from the pre-1922 subdivisions; for instance, before 1922 Transleithanian Croatia was divided into eight counties, but <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>legislation</b> established fourteen counties in the same territory. Međimurje County {{was established in the}} eponymous region acquired through the 1920 Treaty of Trianon. The county borders have sometimes changed since their 1992 restoration (for reasons such as historical ties and requests by cities); the latest revision took place in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Although Poniatowski {{protested the}} First Partition of the Commonwealth (1772), he was {{powerless}} {{to do anything}} about it. He considered abdication, but decided against it. During the Partition Sejm of 1773–1775, in which Russia was represented by ambassador Otto von Stackelberg, with no help forthcoming from abroad and the armies of the partitioning powers occupying Warsaw to compel the Sejm by force of arms, no alternative was available save submission to their will. Eventually Poniatowski and the Sejm acceded to the partition treaty; at the same time, several other reforms were passed. The Cardinal Laws were confirmed and guaranteed by the partitioning powers. Royal power was restricted, as the king lost the power to give out titles, and positions of military officers, ministers and senators, the starostwo territories, and Crown lands would be awarded through an auction. The Sejm also created two notable institutions: the Permanent Council, a main governmental body in continuous operation, and the Commission of National Education. The partitioners intended the Council to be easier to control than the unruly Sejms, and indeed it remained {{under the influence of the}} Russian Empire. Nevertheless, it was a significant improvement in the Commonwealth governance. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>legislation</b> was guaranteed by the Russian Empire, giving it another excuse to interfere in Commonwealth politics if the legislation it favored was changed.|$|E

40|$|Sweden {{is seen as}} one of the world’s most feminist societies. In January 2009 all {{grounds of}} {{discrimination}} were merged into a common law; Diskrimineringslagen. This paper examines representations of gender discrimination, linked to feminist perspectives, in the Parliamentary debate on Sweden’s <b>new</b> discrimination <b>legislation</b> through a discourse analysis. The aim is to find out how the perception of gender discrimination may be linked to attitudes towards the proposal of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> discrimination <b>legislation.</b> <b>The</b> findings are that two competing constructions of gender discrimination {{can be found in the}} empirical material; it’s either seen as a ground of discrimination as more fundamental or equivalent to other grounds of discrimination. The conclusions are that the perception of gender discrimination affects whether the proposal of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> discrimination <b>legislation</b> is seen as a good solution or a problematic solution. The representations of gender discrimination are linked to feminist perspectives in a clearer way in the discourse where the proposal of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> discrimination <b>legislation</b> is seen as a problematic solution; in this discourse gender discrimination is rather associated with taking structural gender relations in consideration than a problem associated with the formal regulation...|$|R
