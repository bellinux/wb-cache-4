5|$|Bradbury {{was called}} up for service in World War II in early 1941, {{although}} the Navy {{allowed him to}} stay at Stanford {{until the end of}} the academic year. He was <b>then</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> the Naval Proving Ground at Dahlgren, Virginia, to work on external ballistics. Already working at Dahlgren were Loeb and Commander Deak Parsons.|$|E

Roswell students in grades ten and eleven were <b>then</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> Milton High School in Alpharetta or North Fulton High School in Atlanta to finish their secondary education (which ended upon completion of grade 11).|$|E
5|$|He was <b>then</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire from 1913 to 1914; his family's wealth {{may have}} {{influenced}} his acceptance to the elite private school. Even though he was seventeen, he was admitted as a lower middleclassman, {{the equivalent of a}} sophomore. While in New England, Hawks often attended the theaters in nearby Boston. In 1914, Hawks returned to Glendora and graduated from Pasadena High School that year.|$|E
5|$|A {{detachment}} under White's command, {{consisting of}} White's Company I, Company K, and the 1st Tennessee, were <b>then</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> New Creek to destroy railroad bridges. The detachment successfully burned the bridges, after which it {{engaged in a}} skirmish with the Cumberland Home Guards. White's forces defeated the guards and captured two cannons, their first trophies of war. Colonel Hill marched to Winchester, and Company I then came {{under the command of}} General Joseph E. Johnston.|$|E
50|$|Cortés <b>then</b> <b>sent</b> emissaries <b>to</b> Moctezuma {{with the}} message that the people of Cholula had treated him with {{trickery}} and had therefore been punished.|$|R

5|$|All {{but four}} of the women from Lidice were {{deported}} immediately to Ravensbrück concentration camp (four were pregnant– they were subjected to forced abortions at the same hospital where Heydrich had died and the women were <b>then</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> the concentration camp). Some children were chosen for Germanization, and 81 were killed in gas vans at the Chełmno extermination camp. Both towns were burned and Lidice's ruins were levelled. At least 1,300 people were massacred after Heydrich's death.|$|E
5|$|Another {{story of}} the poem's origin claimed that Helmer's funeral was held {{on the morning of}} May 2, after which McCrae wrote the poem in 20 minutes. A third claim, by Morrison, was that McCrae worked on the poem as time allowed between arrivals of wounded {{soldiers}} in need of medical attention. Regardless of its true origin, McCrae worked on the poem for months before considering it ready for publication. He submitted it to The Spectator in London but it was rejected. It was <b>then</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> Punch, where it was published on December 8, 1915. It was published anonymously, but Punch attributed the poem to McCrae in its year-end index.|$|E
5|$|Canada's Walk of Fame accepts {{nominations}} for potential inductees {{from the public}} year-round, culminating with their National Nomination Promotion {{during the month of}} April. In 2000, prior to the introduction of the online voting system, over 30,000 nominations were received via letters, fax and e-mail. Now submissions are accepted on the official Canada's Walk of Fame website and thousands of nominations are received every year, which are <b>then</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> selection committee for consideration.|$|E

5|$|Each pair of antennas was {{connected}} to a motorized switch that rapidly switched between the pairs, a technique known as lobe switching. Both signals were <b>then</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> a cathode ray tube (CRT) for display, {{with one of them}} passing through a voltage inverter. If the target was to the left, the display would show a longer blip on the left than the right. When the target was dead ahead, the blips would be equal length. There was an inherently limited accuracy to such a solution, about five degrees but it was a practical solution in terms of limiting the antenna sizes.|$|E
5|$|Fantastic Light {{was then}} {{returned}} to England for a summer campaign. In the Coronation Cup at Epsom in June he finished second to Daliapour and then came fifth of the eight runners behind Giant's Causeway in the Eclipse Stakes. He was <b>then</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> Ascot for the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, where he finished second, reversing the Epsom form with Daliapour, but having no chance against the favourite Montjeu.|$|E
5|$|Glory {{spent much}} of her peacetime career abroad. She was {{assigned}} to the China Station from 1901 to 1905, before returning to British waters for a brief stint with the Channel Fleet and then the Home Fleet from late 1905 to early 1907. After a refit in 1907, she was <b>then</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> the Mediterranean Fleet, where she remained until April 1909. She then returned to Britain and was reduced to reserve status. She remained inactive until the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, at which time she was mobilised into the 8th Battle Squadron.|$|E

5|$|Hastings {{represented}} Mrs Russell in {{the initial}} trial at the High Court and lost; the decision was appealed to the Court of Appeal, where he again lost. The case was <b>then</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> the House of Lords, who {{by a majority of}} three to two (with Lord Birkenhead giving the leading judgment) overturned the previous judgments and said that Mr Russell's evidence as to the legitimacy of his son was inadmissible. Hastings did not represent Mrs Russell in the House of Lords case, however, because by this point he was already Attorney General.|$|E
5|$|In early July, Verijsel {{received}} 360 Ambonese troops, led by Kraeng Tanate, to aid him in {{the defence}} of Semarang. On 21 July, Captain Gerrit Mom arrived from Sulawesi with 800 troops to serve as further reinforcements. Mom and Tanate were <b>then</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> recapture Demak, occupied by 4,000 rebels {{under the command of}} the Chinese general Singseh and Javanese general Raden Suryakusuma. The ensuing battle took place over several days and resulted in a Dutch victory.|$|E
5|$|Provence was <b>then</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> Casablanca, {{where she}} joined Force Y. The unit {{conducted}} several fruitless sweeps into the Atlantic. While in Gibraltar, she was damaged {{and forced to}} return to Toulon for repairs. While en route, she intercepted the Italian passenger ship Oceania; Provence dispatched her to Marseilles so she could be inspected for contraband. Provence sailed for Oran on 24 January 1940, {{and then returned to}} Force Y in Dakar. Force Y was transferred to Oran on 11 April; they arrived five days later. On 27 April, Provence, her two sisters, and several cruisers were moved to Alexandria. On 18 May, Provence and Bretagne returned to Mers El Kébir.|$|E

Freeman presented the book once again to Viking Press and was finally given a chance.|$|R
5|$|Tapestry {{production}} {{began with}} design. The designs, or cartoons were typically executed on paper or parchment, {{put together by}} qualified painters, <b>then</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> weavers, often across a great distance. Because cartoons could be re-used, craftsmen often worked on source material that was decades old. As both paper and parchment are highly perishable, few of the original cartoons survive. Once a design was agreed upon its production might be farmed out among many weavers. Looms were active in all the major Flemish cities, {{in most of the}} towns and in many of the villages.|$|E
5|$|The {{adolescent}} Caligula was <b>then</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> {{live with}} his great-grandmother (and Tiberius's mother) Livia. After her death, {{he was sent to}} {{live with his}} grandmother Antonia. In 30 AD, his brother, Drusus Caesar, was imprisoned on charges of treason and his brother Nero died in exile from either starvation or suicide. Suetonius writes that after the banishment of his mother and brothers, Caligula and his sisters were nothing more than prisoners of Tiberius under the close watch of soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The brigade was <b>then</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> India as the division's advance party, but the {{war ended}} before it could begin operations. Instead the brigade became {{involved}} in disarming the Japanese forces in Malaya and Singapore, to restore British sovereignty. Its last operation was in Java, where it remained until a Dutch force arrived to take over. The brigade then rejoined the 6th Airborne Division, which was serving in Palestine, but was disbanded almost immediately afterwards.|$|E
