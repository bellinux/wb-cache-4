5|$|The {{cerebrum}} has a contralateral organisation {{with each}} hemisphere {{of the brain}} interacting primarily with {{one half of the}} body: <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> of the brain interacts with {{the right side of the}} body, and vice versa. The developmental cause for this is uncertain. Motor connections from the brain to the spinal cord, and sensory connections from the spinal cord to the brain, both cross sides in the brainstem. Visual input follows a more complex rule: the optic nerves from the two eyes come together at a point called the optic chiasm, and half of the fibres from each nerve split off to join the other. The result is that connections from the left half of the retina, in both eyes, go to <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> of the brain, whereas connections from the right half of the retina go to the right side of the brain. Because each half of the retina receives light coming from the opposite half of the visual field, the functional consequence is that visual input from <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> of the world goes to the right side of the brain, and vice versa. Thus, the right side of the brain receives somatosensory input from <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> of the body, and visual input from <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> of the visual field.|$|E

50|$|Min element: In an {{interval}} heap, the minimum element is the element on <b>the</b> <b>left</b> hand <b>side</b> of <b>the</b> root node. This element is removed and returned. To {{fill in the}} vacancy created on <b>the</b> <b>left</b> hand <b>side</b> of <b>the</b> root node, an element from the last node is removed and reinserted into the root node. This element is then compared successively with all <b>the</b> <b>left</b> hand elements of the descending nodes and the process stops when all the conditions for {{an interval}} heap are satisfied.In case if <b>the</b> <b>left</b> hand <b>side</b> element in the node becomes greater than the right side element at any stage, the two elements are swapped and then further comparisons are done. Finally, the root node will again contain the minimum element on <b>the</b> <b>left</b> hand <b>side.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Mk. XIV {{consisted}} of two independent parts, the sighting head and the computor. The sighting head was located in the bomb aimer's window {{at the front of}} the aircraft. The separate computor cabinet was assembled with the operating knobs positioned on the right side of the case, so it had to be placed on <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> of the fuselage. The two were connected via two flexible cable drives.|$|E

5|$|The {{computor}} cabinet {{included only}} four main controls. On <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> of the chassis, {{from top to}} bottom, were dials that set the wind direction, wind speed, target altitude and terminal velocity of the bomb. All of these inputs were set by reading their value in a small window on <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> of the dials. Additional windows provided output values for the indicated airspeed, course, and bombing angle (or range angle). Clips in the upper right held a card with levelling data, as well as notes about the sight or the bombs being dropped. The computor was also connected to several external sources. Compressed air was supplied from the engines to drive the mechanism, and an exhaust allowed the less dense used air to escape. Tubes were also connected to the pitot tube and static air source, which allowed the accurate measurement of airspeed. A separate electrical connection input the direction measured on the distant reading compass, using a selsyn.|$|E

Ignition was by Delco coil and breaker points, with the distributor at the end of the generator/starter unit.|$|E

5|$|Combat in Final Fantasy is menu-based: {{the player}} selects an action {{from a list}} of options such as Attack, Magic, and Item.
