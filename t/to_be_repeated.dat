5|$|While MacDougall {{believed}} {{the results from}} his experiment showed the human soul might have weight, his report, which was not published until 1907, stated the experiment would have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>repeated</b> many times before any conclusion could be obtained.|$|E
5|$|In 1964 the {{guidelines}} were changed to allow individual conventions to create additional categories, which was codified as {{up to two}} categories for that year. These additional awards were officially designated as Hugo Awards, but were not required <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>repeated</b> by future conventions. This was later adjusted to only allow one additional category; while these extra Hugo Awards have been given out in several categories, only a few were ever awarded {{for more than one}} year.|$|E
5|$|MacDougall stated his {{experiment}} {{would have}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>repeated</b> {{many times before}} any conclusion could be obtained. The experiment {{is widely regarded as}} flawed and unscientific due to the small sample size, the methods used, as well as the fact only one of the six subjects met the hypothesis. The case has been cited as an example of selective reporting. Despite its rejection within the scientific community, MacDougall's experiment popularized the concept that the soul has weight, and specifically that it weighs 21 grams.|$|E

5|$|Operations Southeast Croatia and Ozren were early {{opportunities}} for the Germans to learn lessons about the challenges their poorly equipped and often substandard occupation troops faced fighting in the difficult terrain and weather conditions of Bosnia. However, these lessons were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>repeated</b> many more times in the following years as German commanders persisted with their encirclement tactics and unreasonable expectations {{of what could be}} achieved in a given time and space.|$|E
5|$|The {{town has}} a sport complex with badminton, tennis, volleyball and {{basketball}} courts, and two stadiums for hockey and football. In 2014, Youth and Sports Minister Khairy Jamaluddin announced {{formation of a}} National Sports Institute (ISN) in Tawau. It will be the third sports satellite centre in Sabah once completed in 2015. A cross-border sporting event was held in 2014 between the town and Nunukan in Indonesia. It has been proposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>repeated</b> annually to strengthen ties between the towns.|$|E
5|$|A Jack Russell named Bothy {{made history}} in 1982 {{as part of}} the Transglobe Expedition. Owned by explorers Ranulph and Ginny Fiennes, he became the first dog to travel to both the north and south poles. This feat is {{unlikely}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>repeated,</b> as all dogs have been banned from Antarctica by the Antarctic Treaty nations since 1994, due to fears that they could transmit diseases to the native seal population. Ranulph Fiennes and Charles Burton actually made the trip to the north pole by powered sledges before signalling to the base camp that they had arrived. To celebrate their achievement, a plane was sent out to take the two men champagne, along with Bothy.|$|E

5|$|A second method {{involves}} artificially inseminating {{an elephant}} egg cell with sperm cells from a frozen woolly mammoth carcass. The resulting offspring {{would be an}} elephant–mammoth hybrid, and the process would have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>repeated</b> so more hybrids {{could be used in}} breeding. After several generations of cross-breeding these hybrids, an almost pure woolly mammoth would be produced. The fact that sperm cells of modern mammals are viable for 15 years at most after deep-freezing is a hindrance to this method. In one case, an Asian elephant and an African elephant produced a live calf named Motty, but it died of defects at less than two weeks old.|$|E
5|$|Each {{episode of}} Quatermass II was telerecorded onto 35mm film during its live transmission, for a {{scheduled}} repeat the following Monday night at 10:15p.m. All six episodes survive intact in the BBC's archives, although the telerecording copies {{in some cases}} suffer from poor quality sound and vision. Owing to either technical or artistic problems, Cartier had some scenes re-performed by the cast immediately following the live performance on the Saturday evening, and these were telerecorded and used to replace the live versions in the Monday night repeats. Quatermass II {{was one of the}} first BBC drama productions <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>repeated</b> from a telerecording, rather than having the production re-performed live for any second showing as had been the norm in the past.|$|E
5|$|Reformed Christians {{believe that}} {{immersion}} {{is not necessary}} for baptism to be properly performed, but that pouring or sprinkling are acceptable. Sprinkling is said to symbolize the sprinkling of the blood of Christ {{for the removal of}} the guilt of sin. Only ordained ministers are permitted to administer baptism in Reformed churches, contrary to the allowance for emergency baptism by midwives in Roman Catholic churches, though baptisms performed by non-ministers are generally considered valid. Reformed churches, while rejecting the baptismal ceremonies of the Roman Catholic church (such as the use of chrism, salt, and insufflation), accept the validity of baptisms performed with them on the basis that the substance of baptism remains. They do not rebaptize someone who has been baptized using these ceremonies because baptism is never <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>repeated.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{individual}} animals need {{to express}} survival-promoting behaviors, such as seeking food, water, shelter, and a mate. The motivational {{system in the}} brain monitors {{the current state of}} satisfaction of these goals, and activates behaviors to meet any needs that arise. The motivational system works largely by a reward–punishment mechanism. When a particular behavior is followed by favorable consequences, the reward mechanism in the brain is activated, which induces structural changes inside the brain that cause the same behavior <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>repeated</b> later, whenever a similar situation arises. Conversely, when a behavior is followed by unfavorable consequences, the brain's punishment mechanism is activated, inducing structural changes that cause the behavior to be suppressed when similar situations arise in the future.|$|E
5|$|Architectural styles evolve {{and change}} {{to suit the}} {{requirements}} of each individual client. When in 1746 the Duke of Bedford decided to rebuild Woburn Abbey, he chose the Palladian style for the design, as this was now the most fashionable of the era. He selected architect Henry Flitcroft, a protege of Burlington. Flitcroft's designs, while Palladian in nature, would not be recognised by Palladio himself. The central block is small, only three bays, the temple-like portico is merely suggested, and it is closed. Two great flanking wings containing a vast suite of state rooms replace the walls or colonnades which should have connected to the farm buildings; the farm buildings terminating the structure are elevated in height to match the central block, and given Palladian windows, to ensure they are seen as of Palladian design. This development of the style was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>repeated</b> in countless houses, and town halls in Britain over one hundred years. Falling from favour during the Victorian era, it was revived by Sir Aston Webb for his refacing of Buckingham Palace in 1913. Often the terminating blocks would have blind porticos and pilasters themselves, competing for attention with, or complementing the central block. This was all very {{far removed from the}} designs of Palladio two hundred years earlier.|$|E
5|$|Bache {{had long}} {{cherished}} the wish of bringing Liszt to London, which Liszt had last visited in 1841 while still a touring virtuoso, and Liszt knew that whatever standing his music had {{in that city}} had {{in large part to}} do with Bache's efforts. At least in part to repay the debt he felt he owed Bache, Liszt accepted Bache's invitation to attend celebrations in April 1886 to commemorate Liszt's 75th birthday. These celebrations included the foundation of a Liszt piano scholarship at the Royal Academy of Music, a performance of his oratorio The Legend of Saint Elizabeth led by Alexander Mackenzie in St. James's Hall, an audience with Queen Victoria and a public reception in Liszt's honour at the Grosvenor Gallery. Bache was involved in all four of these events, which were highly successful; by popular demand, Saint Elizabeth had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>repeated</b> at the Crystal Palace.|$|E

5|$|The Hugo Award for Best Fancast {{is awarded}} to the best non-professional audio or video {{periodical}} devoted to science fiction, fantasy, or related subjects. The fancast must have released four or more episodes {{by the end of}} the previous calendar year, at least one of which appeared in that year, and it must not qualify for the dramatic presentation category. It must also not provide or be published by an entity that provides a quarter or more of the income of any one person working on the fancast. The name of the award is a portmanteau of fan and podcast. The Hugo Award for Best Fancast was first proposed as a category after the 2011 awards, and then appeared as a temporary category at the 2012 awards. Temporary awards are not required <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>repeated</b> in following years. The 2013 awards, however, did repeat the category, and afterwards it was ratified as a permanent category, and will appear in all future years.|$|E
