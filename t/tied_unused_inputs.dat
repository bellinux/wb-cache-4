40|$|Abstract—Leakage {{power is}} an {{important}} component of the total power consumption in FPGAs built using 90 nm and smaller technology nodes. Power gating, in which regions of the chip can be powered down, has been shown to be effective at reducing leakage power. However, previous techniques focus on staticallycontrolled power gating. In this paper, we propose a modification to the fabric of an FPGA that enables dynamically-controlled power gating, in which logic clusters can be selectively powereddown at run-time. For applications containing blocks with large idle times, this could lead to significant leakage power savings. Our architecture utilizes the existing routing fabric and <b>unused</b> <b>input</b> pins of logic clusters to route the power control signals. No modifications to the existing routing algorithms are required to support the new architecture. We study the area and power tradeoffs by varying the basic architecture parameters of an FPGA, and by varying the size of the power gating regions. We also study the leakage energy savings using a model that characterizes an application in terms of its structure and behavior. We show less than 1 % of area overhead for a power gating region size of 3 X 3 logic tiles. Using the application model, we show that up to 40 % leakage energy reduction can be achieved using the proposed architecture for different application parameters, not including power dissipated by the power state controller.

40|$|The MC 10 E/ 100 E 116 is a quint {{differential}} line receiver with emitter-follower outputs. For applications which require bandwidths {{greater than that}} of the E 116, the E 416 device may be of interest. Active current sources plus a deep collector feature of the MOSAIC III process provide the receivers with excellent common-mode noise rejection. Each receiver has a dedicated VCCO supply lead, providing optimum symmetry and stability. If both inverting and non-inverting inputs are at an equal potential of> − 2. 5 V, the receiver does not go to a defined state, but rather current-shares in normal differential amplifier fashion, producing output voltage levels midway between HIGH and LOW, or the device may even oscillate. The VBB pin, an internally generated voltage supply, is available to this device only. For single-ended <b>input</b> conditions, the <b>unused</b> differential <b>input</b> is connected to VBB as a switching reference voltage. VBB may also rebias AC coupled inputs. When used, decouple VBB and VCC via a 0. 01 �F capacitor and limit current sourcing or sinking to 0. 5 mA. When not used, VBB should be left open. The 100 Series contains temperature compensation...|$|R
40|$|The MC 100 EP 16 VS is a {{differential}} receiver with variable output amplitude. The device is functionally {{equivalent to the}} 100 EP 16 with an input pin that controls the amplitude of the outputs. The VCTRL input pin controls the output amplitude of the EP 16 VS and is referenced to VCC. (See Figure 4.) The operational range of the VCTRL input is from ≤ VBB (max output amplitude) to VCC (min output amplitude). (See Figure 3.) A variable resistor between the VCC and VBB pins, with the wiper driving VCTRL, can control the output amplitude. Typical application circuits and a VCTRL Voltage vs. Output Amplitude graph are described in this data sheet. When left open, the VCTRL pin will be internally pulled down to VEE and operate as a standard EP 16, with 100 % output amplitude. The VBB pin, an internally generated voltage supply, is available to this device only. For single−ended <b>input</b> conditions, the <b>unused</b> differential <b>input</b> is connected to VBB as a switching reference voltage. VBB may also rebias AC coupled inputs.
