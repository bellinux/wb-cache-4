5|$|The {{provisional}} favourite for the women's {{race was}} Kenyan runner Florence Kiplagat, {{who was the}} fastest entrant in the field through her win at the Lille Half Marathon in September (also her debut for the distance). Her compatriots Peninah Arusei and Sarah Chepchirchir – second and third in Lille – completed the strongest three of the Kenyan women's team, which was considered <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> for the title. The Ethiopians, led by Boston Marathon winner Dire Tune, were their main opposition for the team race, although the nation had sent relatively inexperienced runners to the championships on this occasion. China's leading athlete was Zhu Xiaolin, who despite being an established marathon runner had less experience over the half distance. Although Japan lacked a leading figure individually, their overall consistency (which had brought them team medals {{in the last five}} editions) demonstrated their team pedigree. Kenya entered the tournament as the reigning team champions.|$|E
25|$|The Texans surged as <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> in the AFC South in , {{holding an}} 11–1 record by week 14. However, they lost {{three of their}} last four games to finish 12–4; beating the rival Indianapolis Colts in that four-game stretch {{allowing}} them to clinch their 2nd AFC South title. The Texans beat the Bengals again in the wild-card round, but they lost {{in the second round}} to the New England Patriots.|$|E
25|$|When Foster {{joined the}} Leland Giants, he demanded {{that he be}} {{put in charge of}} not only the on-field activities, but the bookings as well. Foster {{immediately}} turned the Giants into <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat.</b> He indoctrinated them to take the extra base, to play hit and run on nearly every pitch, and to rattle the opposing pitcher by taking them deep into the count. He studied the mechanics of his pitchers and could spot the smallest flaw, turning his average pitchers into learned craftsmen. Foster also was able to turn around the business end of the team as well, by demanding and getting 40 percent of the gate instead of the 10 percent that Frank Leland was getting.|$|E

25|$|In 2016, Cal went 5-7, wining only 3 {{out of the}} 9 Pac-12 games. A {{highlight}} of that season was the team's win over UCLA, making {{it the first time}} that Dykes was able to lead <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> one of Cal's three traditional rivals - Stanford, UCLA and USC. On January 8, 2017 Sonny Dykes was fired. He finished at Cal with a four-year record of 19–30. The firing came as a surprise as his contract was previously extended and most coaching changes come right after the end of a season and not the following year. Two of the stated concerns were Dykes' commitment to the program as following the 2016 Dykes was interviewed by Baylor University for their head coaching positions, and the significant decreases in home game attendance - thirty percent less season tickets were renewed for 2017 than for the previous year.|$|E
25|$|This rivalry {{is totally}} {{different}} and interesting. It is started on Season 86. Arellano and Perpetual are tight and wild contenders in many sports, such as Basketball, Track and Field, {{and especially in}} Beach Volleyball, volleyball, and cheerleading. Through the following years, the 2 schools are <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> in volleyball and cheerleading. In these particular sports, these two schools are always in the Final 2, they are always {{compete with each other}} and vie for the win. Even if this rivalry is tough, the 2 schools had a great relationship at each other. Key players for this rivalry are Arellano's Jiovanni Jalalon, Zach Nicholls, John Pinto, and Keith Agovida, in basketball; Christine Joy Rosario, Menchie Tubiera, Rialen Sante, and Danna Henson in volleyball. While on Perpetual are: Scottie Thompson, Bright Akhuetie, Gerald Dizon, in basketball; Royse Tubino, Coleen Bravo, and Lourdes Clemente in volleyball.|$|E
25|$|Coming {{off their}} third NBA Championship in seven years, {{there was a}} sense that the Spurs were the class of the NBA, and once again would be <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> in the NBA for the Championship. For the 2005–06 season, the Spurs {{acquired}} the two-time All-Star Michael Finley and one-time All Star Nick Van Exel. Not surprisingly, the Spurs would come flying out of the gate, winning 16 of their first 19 games. Once again, the Spurs would get challenged within their own division by the Dallas Mavericks as they held the two best records in the Western Conference all season, battling for first place. In the end, the experience of the Spurs would be the difference as they won the Southwest Division again with a new franchise best record of 63–19. The Spurs met the Mavericks in the second round of the playoffs, but it would be Dallas coming out on top 4–3, including a 119–111 overtime victory in Game 7.|$|E

By the mid-1990s, Auckland and Nelson were <b>the</b> <b>teams</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat,</b> with New Zealand basketball legends Pero Cameron and Phill Jones dominating during this era for Auckland and Nelson, respectively.

500|$|Sue (Jane Lynch) {{announces that}} rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline is <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat,</b> thanks mostly to its {{transgender}} lead singer Wade [...] "Unique" [...] Adams (Alex Newell), {{who has become}} a media star. Sue decides that New Directions needs a similar gimmick to win and she tells Kurt (Chris Colfer) to dress in drag, but he adamantly refuses. Puck (Mark Salling) dons a dress and volunteers to lead the drag number, but Will vetoes the gimmickry and refocuses the group on its choreography.|$|E
500|$|On January 23, 2007, Phillies shortstop Jimmy Rollins made a {{statement}} that may have set the rivalry in a dead heat: [...] "I think we are <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> in the NL East… but that's only on paper." [...] Many Mets fans and players laughed at the prediction, especially once the Phillies stumbled {{out of the gate}} in April, starting the season at 1–6 and posting an 11–14 record for the month. The Mets, meanwhile, sat firmly in the NL East lead for almost all of the season.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal began November with {{a trip to}} Elland Road to face Leeds United. There were {{no changes}} to the team from the Charlton game; for Leeds, Pennant started against his parent club after being granted {{permission}} by Wenger. Arsenal's victory by four goals to one was identical to the scoreline in the corresponding fixture of last season. In a match report for the News of the World, journalist Martin Samuel picked Henry as {{the man of the}} match and asserted Arsenal remained <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat.</b> Attention soon turned to the North London derby, where Arsenal played Tottenham Hotspur on 8 November 2003. Tottenham had not beaten their rivals since November 1999 and their last win at Highbury had come a decade previously. Kanu was brought into the starting line-up to partner Henry, as Wiltord was ruled out with a calf strain. Arsenal conceded an early goal after Darren Anderton capitalised on a defensive mix-up, but they scored two late goals in what was described as [...] "another stuttering" [...] performance in The Observer. The result put Arsenal four points clear in first, albeit temporarily as Chelsea's win at home to Newcastle United 24 hours later cut their gap to one point.|$|E

2500|$|I wouldn't say we're {{overwhelming}} favourites but I {{think we}} generally start as favourites against most teams at home.

The Windies haven't played any one-day cricket for a while and we're in the middle of our season, so I suppose we are <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat.</b> But having said that, if they find their feet they're a very good side and we'll have to play very well to win." ...|$|E
