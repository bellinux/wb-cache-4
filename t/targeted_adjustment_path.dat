40|$|It is {{becoming}} increasingly recognised that the IS-LM-AS model {{is no longer the}} best pedagogic tool for describing the way monetary policy works in most industrialised countries. Emerging in its place is the TaylorRomer (TR) model of macroeconomic stabilisation, in which the central bank adopts an interest rate rule. The TR model has the twin advantages of being more realistic and simpler than the traditional IS-LM-AS model. This article argues that the goals of realism and simplicity can be further advanced with some refinement of the TR model. Several minor modifications are advocated. An additional change is proposed to the diagram so as to reflect better the actual <b>adjustment</b> <b>paths</b> that are likely to be observed following demand and supply shocks.

40|$|The {{propagation}} of nominal shocks is analyzed in a fully specified stochastic intertemporal two-country model. We show {{how to solve}} for the equilibrium analytically and analyze the role of real and nominal propagation mechanisms. First we consider the dynamic implications of nominal shocks having an impact effect due to one-period nominal contracts when the propagation over time runs via a basic real propagation mechanism in open economies (current account). We find that this case is characterized by strong persistency in the real effects of nominal shocks, but the dynamic <b>adjustment</b> <b>path</b> is strongly at odds with empirical evidence. Secondly, we introduce a nominal propagation mechanism {{in the form of}} staggered nominal contracts. This turns out to imply a radical change in the dynamic response to nominal shocks, and to generate a dynamic <b>adjustment</b> <b>path</b> of the form observed empirically.

For a country adopting dual floating exchange rate system and facing the supply shocks will cause the price level to increase persistently. If the price level reaches the price ceiling threshold, then the monetary authority will adopt deflationary policy. It is wondered how these shocks will affect the possible <b>adjustment</b> <b>paths</b> of relevant macroeconomic variables. The major findings are as follows. The liquidity effect, foreign interest revenue effect and interest rate income effect which are all caused by change in the nominal money supply are the key factors affecting the possible <b>adjustment</b> <b>paths</b> of relevant macroeconomic variables. Moreover, whether the price regime will collapse or not and {{the timing of the}} monetary authority will adjust nominal money supply are dependent on the price ceiling threshold. The stronger the desire of the monetary authority to defend the price ceiling threshold, the earlier the monetary authority will adopt the monetary policy to attack inflation. supply shocks, regime collapse, dual floating exchange rate regimes, exchange rate dynamics...|$|R

Our empirical model accounts for almost all the variations in the U. S. external position between 1973 and 2008. We estimate that most of the quarter-by-quarter changes in the U. S. external position over this period are due to news about future returns and trade flows, but over long horizons the changes reflect prior expectations about how the U.

40|$|Dombusch's 1976 {{overshooting}} {{exchange rate}} model (hereafter, DBM) {{has long been}} known to underpin severed large macro models, including the Murphy Model (MM). But the dynamic <b>adjustment</b> <b>paths</b> of variables in MM differ markedly from those in DBM, even qualitatively. A leading case in point is the exchange rate which in MM undershoots its new long run-equilibrium value after the injection of a monetary shock, and then actually moves away from this equi-librium for a time before approaching it via a damped cyclical <b>adjustment</b> <b>path</b> (whereas the corresponding path in DBM is monotonic). This paper gives a simplified account of how this comes about. The emphasis is not so much on theoretical rigour but on providing a convincing practical demonstration. Using the simplest form of DBM as a starting point, it is shown how one can develop a miniature model exhibiting an MM-like response to a monetary shock. The key idea is that aggregate demand does not respond instantaneously (as in DBM) to shocks in the macroeconomic environment, but shows some degree of inertia. Nothing more is required to reconcile the qualitative dynamics of MM with DBM...|$|R

We used an error-correction econometric method to estimate the cigarette sales <b>adjustment</b> <b>path</b> in response to changes in prices and CIAL coverage in the United States by utilizing scanner data from supermarkets. Finding from this study indicates that smokeless tobaccos are not perfect substitutes for cigarettes, but increases in the price of cigarettes are associated with an increase in smokeless tobacco sales. The error-correction econometric method suggest that the demand for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco is related to each other; a price increase in either product leads to an increase in demand for the other product. However, the <b>adjustment</b> <b>paths</b> are quite different; an increase in cigarette prices lowers cigarette sales in relatively faster rate than decreases in smokeless tobacco prices or adoption of smoke-free laws.

Using a thirty-two-year history of the debt to equity ratio for each of ninety ‘mature’ United Kingdom firms, a non-parametric estimation procedure shows that the debt to equity ratio evolves in terms of a process which is largely consistent with the predictions of this model. In particular, the evolution of the debt to equity ratio is compatible with a ‘long (fat) tailed’ density function with no convergent moments.
