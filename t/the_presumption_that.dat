5|$|Originally, a toll {{was paid}} for each {{direction}} of travel with sets of toll booths on both carriageways. In 1997, the northbound toll was doubled (from 40p to 80p) and the southbound toll abolished on <b>the</b> <b>presumption</b> <b>that</b> almost all traffic makes a return journey across the bridge, and that {{the removal of the}} southbound toll would result in a reduction of congestion without reducing revenue.|$|E
5|$|This step is {{necessary}} because the rational nexus test is not foolproof. The test {{is based on}} <b>the</b> <b>presumption</b> <b>that</b> the legislative object itself is not {{in violation of the}} Constitution. However, if the object of the statute is itself illegitimate, a classification may be invalid even if it satisfies the test. Hence, the test is only applicable if the object of the impugned legislation is a proper one.|$|E
5|$|According to Béla Miklós Szőke's theory, the {{detailed}} description of the Magyars by western contemporary sources and the immediate Hungarian intervention in local wars give <b>the</b> <b>presumption</b> <b>that</b> the Hungarians had already lived on the eastern territories of the Carpathian Basin since the middle of the 9th century. Regarding the right location of early Hungarian settlements, the Arabic geographer al-Jayhani (only snippets of his work survived in other Muslim authors' papers) in the 870s placed the Hungarians between Don and Danube rivers. Szőke identifies al-Jayhani's Danube with the middle Danube region, as opposed to the previously assumed lower Danube region, because following al-Jayhani's description the Christian Moravians were the western neighbors of the Magyars.|$|E

5|$|Both serials were {{promptly}} {{released on}} iTunes, with DVD releases following {{over the next}} few months. Both on the iTunes and the DVD release, episode 3 of The Web of Fear was represented by a tele-snap reconstruction, edited by John Kelly. Episode 3 {{had been part of the}} same find, but by the end of protracted negotiations for the return of the film cans, the episode had disappeared from the cache, with <b>the</b> <b>presumption</b> <b>that</b> it was sold to a private collector.|$|E
5|$|Some {{animals of}} the far north, like the showshoe and Arctic hares, Arctic fox, stoat, and rock {{ptarmigan}} change their coat colour (by moulting and growing new fur or feathers) from brown or grey summer camouflage to white in the winter; the Arctic fox is the only species in the dog family to do so. However, Arctic hares which live in the far north of Canada, where summer is very short, remain white year-round. Since these animals in widely separated groups have evolved separately, the similarity of coloration is due to convergent evolution, on <b>the</b> <b>presumption</b> <b>that</b> natural selection favours a particular coloration in a particular environment.|$|E
5|$|When BSP workers garlanded Mayawati with {{currency}} {{notes on the}} occasion of the party's silver jubilee celebrations coinciding with BSP founder Kanshi Ram’s birth anniversary on March 15, 2010, Indian news channels and newspapers purported to expose the event as a ‘scandal’ on <b>the</b> <b>presumption</b> <b>that</b> the Chief Minister had publicly committed an act of corruption that was being flaunted openly and declaring that the garland of {{currency notes}} was made from money through corrupt means and not from donations of Bahujan Samaj Party supporters as Mayawati, her Ministers and supporters claimed.|$|E

5|$|Inferior vena cava filters (IVC filters) {{are used}} on <b>the</b> <b>presumption</b> <b>that</b> they reduce PE, {{although}} their effectiveness and safety profile {{are not well}} established. In general, they are only recommended in some high risk scenarios. The ACCP recommended them for those with a contraindication to anticoagulant treatment but not in addition to anticoagulation, unless an individual with an IVC filter but without a risk for bleeding develops acute proximal DVT. In this case, both anticoagulation and an IVC filter are suggested. NICE recommends caval filters in settings where someone with an acute proximal DVT or PE cannot receive anticoagulation, and that the filter is removed when anticoagulation can be safely started. While IVC filters themselves {{are associated with a}} long-term risk of DVT, they are not reason enough to maintain extended anticoagulation.|$|E
5|$|The fateful {{encounter}} between Margaðr and Guthormr is sometimes dated to 1052 on <b>the</b> <b>presumption</b> <b>that</b> Margaðr {{is identical to}} Echmarcach, and that the event must have taken place {{at the conclusion of}} Echmarcach's second reign in Dublin. In fact, the Old Norse personal name Margaðr is a form of the Gaelic personal name Murchad; and the aforesaid accounts of Margaðr likely refer to Echmarcach's nemesis Murchad, rather than Echmarcach himself. Although the saga claims that a thankful Guthormr donated a portion of his looted silver to the shrine of his saintly uncle at Niðaróss, it is unlikely that any church would have accepted property known to have been looted from Christians. Instead, it is possible that Guthormr's hoard of silver was actually the tax that Murchad which had collected from Mann in 1061 during the expulsion of Echmarcach. Such a date corresponds to the implied date of about 1061 given by Heimskringla.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>presumption</b> <b>that</b> {{carnivorous}} dinosaurs, like Megalosaurus, were quadrupeds {{was first}} {{challenged by the}} find of Compsognathus in 1859. That, however, was a very small animal, the significance of which for gigantic forms could be denied. In 1870, near Oxford, the type specimen of Eustreptospondylus was discovered - the first reasonably intact skeleton of a large theropod. It was clearly bipedal. Shortly afterwards, John Phillips created the first public display of a theropod skeleton in Oxford, arranging the known Megalosaurus bones, held by recesses in cardboard sheets, in {{a more or less}} natural position. During the 1870s, North American discoveries of large theropods, like Allosaurus, confirmed that they were bipedal. The Oxford University Museum of Natural History display contains most of the specimens from the original description by Buckland.|$|E

5|$|Teenager Billy Duncan {{wakes up}} in his bed, {{seemingly}} disturbed, and learns his mother is leaving for vacation. He goes to visit his girlfriend Kathy, but her deranged grandfather Colonel Farley makes him leave before he can see her. As Billy drives around town, he is harassed by bullies Chuck Boran and Froggy, and by two police deputies who give him a speeding ticket. Billy wanders into the desert and discovers the laser cannon and pendant. He starts playing with the cannon, pretending to shoot things, then realizes he can fire the weapon while wearing the pendant. Meanwhile, on the alien spacecraft, the two aliens converse with their leader who shows them footage of Billy using the cannon, prompting the aliens to turn their ship around {{to head back to}} Earth. Context implies that the two aliens, upon departing Earth, left the cannon and pendant behind under <b>the</b> <b>presumption</b> <b>that</b> no other human would be able to use them as the green-skinned man had, but they have now learned that they were in error.|$|E

50|$|Not surprisingly, many {{separate}} (but related) fields {{have investigated}} the topic of linguistic convention within their own research paradigms. <b>The</b> <b>presumptions</b> <b>that</b> prop up each theoretical view are {{of interest to the}} philosopher of language. For instance, one of the major fields of sociology, symbolic interactionism, is based on the insight that human social organization is based almost entirely on the use of meanings. In consequence, any explanation of a social structure (like an institution) would need to account for the shared meanings which create and sustain the structure.|$|R

Earlier efforts afforded domestic partners only certain enumerated rights, which the legislature expanded in piecemeal fashion. This bill, introduced by Assemblymembers Jackie Goldberg, Christine Kehoe, Paul Koretz, John Laird, and Mark Leno, created <b>the</b> <b>presumption</b> <b>that</b> domestic partners were to have all of the rights and responsibilities afforded spouses under state law.|$|E

25|$|Lubbock {{had been}} {{as much of an}} ethnologist as an archaeologist. The founders of {{cultural}} anthropology, such as Tylor and Morgan, were to follow his lead on that.

50|$|We {{can better}} {{understand}} resistance by accounting different perspectives and by breaking <b>the</b> <b>presumptions</b> <b>that</b> resistance is always against power.

There are various forms of resistance for various reasons, which then can be, again, classified as violent and nonviolent resistance (and “other” which is unclear).|$|R
