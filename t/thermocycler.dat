40|$|As {{part of a}} large {{international}} {{project for}} validation and standardization of PCR, the influence of <b>thermocyclers</b> on PCR was tested. Six brand-new, Peltier technology-driven 96 -well <b>thermocyclers</b> were subjected to a novel and stringent in-tube (not block) physical testing. The temperature was directly monitored in PCR tubes containing 50 μl of distilled water at 13 different block positions. The certified temperature accuracy of the measurement system was ± 0. 3 °C. Finally, the results of the physical testing were compared to those of an amplification efficiency study running an in-house PCR assay. The cyclers did not perform within the manufacturer′s specification. Premature timing, under- and overshooting, and spatial variation of heat transfer were found to be the critical factors. The physical testing allowed us to distinguish accurate from less-accurate (2 / 6) cyclers. The lack of thermal homogeneities became most evident at the denaturation level during the first 15 s. At the time point zero, the accurate cyclers showed temperature deviations of 0. 5 to 1. 5 °C, whereas less-accurate cyclers failed to reach the set temperature by 13 to 20 °C. Consequently, the two less-accurate cyclers could not gain positive PCR results by running an in-house PCR assay. However, by modifying the original temperature protocol by increasing the denaturation temperature and time, the amplification efficiency of these two cyclers could be improved significantly. The results have implication for laboratories using diagnostic PCR testing...|$|R

5000|$|Detection of {{amplification}} product can {{be determined}} via photometry for turbidity caused by an increasing quantity of magnesium pyrophosphate precipitate in solution as a byproduct of amplification. This allows easy visualization by the naked eye, especially for larger reaction volumes, or via simple detection approaches for smaller volumes. The reaction can be followed in real-time either by measuring the turbidity or by fluorescence using intercalating dyes such as SYTO 9. [...] Dyes such as SYBR green, {{can be used to}} create a visible color change that can be seen with the naked eye without the need for expensive equipment, or a response that can more accurately be measured by instrumentation. Dye molecules intercalate or directly label the DNA, and in turn can be correlated to the number of copies initially present. Hence, LAMP can also be quantitative. In-tube detection of DNA amplification is possible using manganese loaded calcein which starts fluorescing upon complexation of manganese by pyrophosphate during in vitro DNA synthesis.Moreover, visual detection of the LAMP amplicons by the unaided eye was based on their ability to hybridize with the complementary gold-bound ss-DNA and thus prevent the normal red to purple-blue color change that would otherwise occur by salt-induced aggregation of the gold particles. So, a LAMP method combined with amplicon detection by AuNP has advantages over previously other methods in terms of reduced assay time, amplicon confirmation by hybridization and use of simpler equipment (i.e., no need for a <b>thermocycler,</b> electrophoresis equipment or a UV trans-illuminator.|$|E

Neutrophils from 12 volunteers underwent temperature changes in a PCR <b>thermocycler</b> (37 degrees C for 30 minutes, 28 degrees C for 60 minutes, and then 37 degrees C for 90 minutes). Different co-incubates were applied to neutrophils, as follows: Group A: phosphate-buffered saline solution; Group B: platelet activating factor (PAF); Group C: platelet-depleted plasma; Group D: platelet-depleted plasma + PAF; and Group E: platelet-rich plasma. Membrane-bound elastase (MBE) activity was measured every 30 minutes throughout the experiment. MBE acticity decreased significantly after hypothermia, compared with the baseline level (p < 0. 001), and it resumed an increase after re-warming. Among all co-incubates, platelet-rich plasma was the most potent pro-inflammatory stimulus to neutrophils. A linear correlation was found between MBE and platelet count in platelet-rich plasma. (p = 0. 004). A novel in vitro model involving a PCR <b>thermocycler</b> has been proved to be reliable {{in the study of}} neutrophil activation during cardiopulmonary bypass.

40|$|Heat Transfer and Thermal Management {{have become}} {{important}} aspects of the developing field of uTAS systems particularly in the application of the the uTAS philosophy to thermally driven analysis techniques such as PCR. Due to the development of flowing PCR <b>thermocyclers</b> in the field of uTAS, the authors have previously developed a melting curve analysis technique that is compatible with these flowing PCR <b>thermocyclers.</b> In this approach a linear temperature gradient is induced along a sample carrying microchannel. Any flow passing through the microchannel is subject to linear heating. Fluorescent monitoring of DNA in the flow results in the generation of DNA melting curve plots. This works presents an experimental technique where DNA melting curve analysis is used to measure the thermal resistance of microchannel substrates. DNA in solution is tested at a number of different ramp rates and the di®erent apparent denaturation temperatures measured are used to infer the thermal resistance of the microchannel substrates. The apparent variation in denaturation temperature is found to be linearly proportional to flow ramp rate. Providing knowledge of the microchannel diameter and a non-varying cross-section in the direction of heat flux the thermal resistance measurement technique is independent of knowledge of substrate dimensions, contact surface quality and substrate composition/material properties. In this approach to microchannel DNA melting curve analysis the difference between the measured and actual denaturation temperatures is proportional to the substrate thermal resistance and the ramp-rate seen by the sample. Therefore quantitative knowledge of the substrate thermal resistance is required when using this technique to measure accurately DNA denaturation temperatur...|$|R

5000|$|RPA is one {{of several}} {{isothermal}} nucleic acid amplification techniques to be developed as a molecular diagnostic technique, frequently with the objective of simplifying the laboratory instrumentation required relative to PCR. A partial list of other isothermal amplification techniques include LAMP, NASBA, Helicase-dependent amplification (HDA), and Nicking Enzyme Amplification Reaction (NEAR). The techniques differ in the specifics of primer design and reaction mechanism, and in some cases (like RPA) make use of cocktails of two or more enzymes. Like RPA, many of these techniques offer rapid amplification times with the potential for simplified instrumentation, and reported resistance to substances in unpurified samples that are known to inhibit PCR. With respect to amplification time, {{it should be noted that}} modern <b>thermocyclers</b> with rapid temperature ramps can reduce PCR amplification times to less than 30 minutes, particularly for short amplicons using dual-temperature cycling rather than the conventional three-temperature protocols.

Methods: We obtained published high-replicate qPCR datasets from standard block <b>thermocyclers</b> and other cycler platforms and statistically evaluated the impact of smoothing on Cq and AE. Results: Our results indicate that selected smoothing algorithms affect estimates of Cq and AE considerably. The commonly used moving average filter performed worst in all qPCR scenarios. The Savitzky–Golay smoother, cubic splines, and Whittaker smoother resulted overall in the least bias in our setting and exhibited low sensitivity to differences in qPCR AE, whereas other smoothers, such as running mean, introduced an AE-dependent bias.

The infection’s clinical symptoms include growth retardation or feathering disorders but the infection process may remain non-symptomatic {{what makes the}} infected birds more susceptible for secondary viral, bacterial and fungal infections.

However these techniques require application of <b>thermocyclers</b> and qualified staff which may be cost-consuming for some diagnostic units. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay (LAMP) as a simple method of GCV detection. Results The presented study has shown LAMP as a rapid tool of detecting DNA of goose circovirus (GCV) as soon in 30 min time. The method used three sets of primers: two outer primers (F 3 and B 3), two inner primers (FIP and BIP) and two loop primers (FL and BL) to accelerate the reaction. The optimum reaction temperature and the time were 61 °C for 30 min, respectively. The results were analysed using SYBR Green dye and GelRedTM solutions. Thirty-eight isolates of GCV collected from geese flocks in Poland were examined. For comparison, real-time polymerase chain reaction with F 3 and B 3 primers and SYBR Green dye was conducted.
