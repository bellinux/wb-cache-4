5|$|In Five Songs (1956–57) and Musique funèbre (1958) Lutosławski {{introduced}} his {{own brand of}} twelve-tone music, marking his departure from the explicit use of folk music. His twelve-tone technique allowed him to build harmony and melody from specific intervals (in Musique funèbre, augmented fourths and semitones). This system also gave him the means to write dense chords without resorting to tone clusters, and enabled him to build towards these dense chords (which often include all twelve notes of the chromatic scale) at climactic moments. Lutosławski's twelve-note techniques were thus completely different in conception from Arnold Schoenberg's tone-row system, although Musique funèbre does happen {{to be based on}} a <b>tone</b> <b>row.</b> This twelve-note intervallic technique had its genesis in earlier works such as Symphony No. 1, and Paganini Variations.|$|E

25|$|This piano suite was {{the first}} Canadian {{composition}} to use Arnold Schoenberg’s 12-tone system, though in a modified form. It consists of three movements; Waltzling, Dirgeling and Themes with Variables. In this piece, the <b>tone</b> <b>row</b> is treated as motivic material used with the traditional neoclassic forms, such as ABA and theme and variations.|$|E
50|$|In {{practice}} {{far fewer}} than twenty-four tones {{are used in}} a single performance. All twenty-four tones are individual pitches differentiated into a hierarchy of important pitches—pillars—which occur more frequently in the <b>tone</b> <b>rows</b> of traditional music and most often begin <b>tone</b> <b>rows,</b> and scattered less important or seldom occurring pitches (see tonality).|$|R

25|$|An {{aggregate}} may {{be divided}} into subsets, and {{all the members of}} the aggregate not part of any one subset are said to be its complement. A subset is self-complementing if it contains half of the set and its complement is also a permutation of the original subset. This is most commonly seen with hexachords or six-note segments from a basic <b>tone</b> <b>row.</b> A hexachord that is self-complementing for a particular permutation is referred to as prime combinatorial. A hexachord that is self-complementing for all of the canonic operations—Inversion, Retrograde and Retrograde Inversion—is referred to as all-combinatorial.|$|E
500|$|The {{final three}} sonatas are for woodwind and piano: for flute (1956–57), {{clarinet}} (1962), and oboe (1962). They have, according to Grove, become fixtures in their repertoires because of [...] "their technical expertise {{and of their}} profound beauty". The Elégie for horn and piano (1957) was composed {{in memory of the}} horn player Dennis Brain. It contains one of Poulenc's rare excursions into dodecaphony, with the brief employment of a twelve-note <b>tone</b> <b>row.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Cage's first {{completed}} {{pieces are}} currently lost. According to the composer, the earliest works were very short pieces for piano, composed using complex mathematical procedures {{and lacking in}} [...] "sensual appeal and expressive power." [...] Cage then started producing pieces by improvising and writing down the results, until Richard Buhlig stressed to him the importance of structure. Most works from the early 1930s, such as Sonata for Clarinet (1933) and Composition for 3 Voices (1934), are highly chromatic and betray Cage's interest in counterpoint. Around the same time, the composer also developed a type of a <b>tone</b> <b>row</b> technique with 25-note rows. After studies with Schoenberg, who never taught dodecaphony to his students, Cage developed another <b>tone</b> <b>row</b> technique, in which the row was split into short motives, which would then be repeated and transposed according {{to a set of}} rules. This approach was first used in Two Pieces for Piano (c. 1935), and then, with modifications, in larger works such as Metamorphosis and Five Songs (both 1938).|$|E
2500|$|During this period, {{the concept}} of {{serialism}} influenced not only new compositions but also the scholarly analysis of the classical masters. [...] Adding to their professional tools of sonata form and tonality, scholars began to analyze previous works {{in the light of}} serial techniques; for example they found the use of row technique in previous composers going back to Mozart and Beethoven ( [...] ; [...] ). [...] In particular, the orchestral outburst that introduces the development section half-way through the last movement of Mozart's next-to-last symphony is a <b>tone</b> <b>row</b> that Mozart punctuates in a very modern and violent episode that Michael Steinberg called [...] "rude octaves and frozen silences" [...]|$|E
2500|$|In the 1950s, Stravinsky {{began using}} serial {{compositional}} {{techniques such as}} dodecaphony, the twelve-tone technique originally devised by Arnold Schoenberg. He first experimented with non-twelve-tone serial techniques in small-scale vocal and chamber works such as the Cantata (1952), the Septet (1953) and Three Songs from Shakespeare (1953). The first of his compositions fully based on such techniques was In Memoriam Dylan Thomas (1954). Agon (1954–57) {{was the first of}} his works to include a twelve-tone series and [...] (1955) was the first piece to contain a movement entirely based on a <b>tone</b> <b>row.</b> Stravinsky expanded his use of dodecaphony in works such as Threni (1958) and A Sermon, a Narrative and a Prayer (1961), which are based on biblical texts, and The Flood (1962), which mixes brief biblical texts from the Book of Genesis with passages from the York and Chester Mystery Plays.|$|E

50|$|Like {{the first}} movement, the {{thematic}} {{material in the}} third is presented through <b>tone</b> <b>rows</b> and chromatic figures. The third movement builds up tension through its use of highly dissonant chord progressions, and is much darker than the second.|$|R
2500|$|The action {{takes place}} in the fictional, African-American {{neighborhood}} of Catfish Row, Charleston, South Carolina. With the exception of several minor speaking roles, all of the characters are African-American. The music combines elements of popular music of the day, with a strong influence of African-American music, of the period, with techniques typical of opera, such as recitative, through-composition and an extensive system of leitmotifs. Porgy and Bess contains some of Gershwin's most sophisticated music, including a fugue, a passacaglia, the use of atonality, polytonality and polyrhythm, and a <b>tone</b> <b>row.</b> Even the [...] "set numbers" [...] (of which [...] "Summertime", [...] "I Got Plenty o' Nuttin'" [...] and [...] "It Ain't Necessarily So" [...] are well known examples) {{are some of the most}} refined and ingenious of Gershwin's compositions. For the performances, Gershwin collaborated with Eva Jessye, whom he picked as the musical director. The work was first performed in 1935; it was a box-office failure in the middle of the Great Depression.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Tone</b> <b>rows</b> are {{the basis}} of Arnold Schoenberg's twelve-tone {{technique}} and most types of serial music. <b>Tone</b> <b>rows</b> were widely used in 20th-century contemporary music, e.g. Dmitri Shostakovich's use of twelve-tone rows, [...] "without dodecaphonic transformations", though one has been identified in the A minor prelude from book II of The Well-Tempered Clavier (1742) by J. S. Bach, and by {{the late eighteenth century}} was a well-established technique, found in works such as Mozart's C major String Quartet, K. 157 (1772), String Quartet in E-flat major, K. 428, String Quintet in G minor, K. 516 (1790), and the Symphony in G minor, K. 550 (1788). Beethoven also used the technique but, on the whole, [...] "Mozart seems to have employed serial technique far more often than Beethoven". Hans Keller claims that Schoenberg was aware of this serial practice in the classical period, and that [...] "Schoenberg repressed his knowledge of classical serialism because it would have injured his narcissism." [...] There are also examples in the works of Liszt.|$|R

50|$|Needless to say, durations, {{dynamics}} {{and other aspects}} of music other than the pitch can be freely chosen by the composer, and there are also no general rules about which <b>tone</b> <b>rows</b> should be used at which time (beyond their all being derived from the prime series, as already explained). However, individual composers have constructed more detailed systems in which matters such as these are also governed by systematic rules (see serialism).|$|R
5000|$|If {{the first}} three notes are {{regarded}} as the [...] "original" [...] cell, then the next three are its retrograde inversion (backwards and upside down), the next three are retrograde (backwards), and the last three are its inversion (upside down). A row created in this manner, through variants of a trichord or tetrachord called the generator, is called a derived <b>row.</b> The <b>tone</b> <b>rows</b> of many of Webern's other late works are similarly intricate.|$|R
2500|$|Because {{there are}} tonal chord progressions that use all twelve notes, it is {{possible}} to create pitch rows with very strong tonal implications, and even to write tonal music using twelve-tone technique. Most <b>tone</b> <b>rows</b> contain subsets that can imply a pitch center; a composer can create music centered on {{one or more of the}} row's constituent pitches by emphasizing or avoiding these subsets, respectively, as well as through other, more complex compositional devices ( [...] ; [...] ).|$|R
