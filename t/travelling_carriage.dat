60|$|Coming {{in sight}} of the Dragon, they saw a <b>travelling</b> <b>carriage</b> at the door.|$|E
60|$|He rode through Newport {{some three}} hours later without drawing rein. By {{the door of the}} Raven Inn stood a <b>travelling</b> <b>carriage,</b> upon which he did not so much as bestow a look.|$|E
60|$|The great <b>travelling</b> <b>carriage</b> drew up at {{the lighted}} portals of the Feydau, and M. le Marquis stepped out. He entered the theatre with Chabrillane, all unconsciously to deliver himself {{into the hands of}} Andre-Louis.|$|E

50|$|In 1886 {{the corps}} {{obtained}} two 40 Pounder Rifled Breech Loading (RBL) guns on <b>travelling</b> <b>carriages.</b> They were horsed by dray horses from Messrs Youngers' and Messrs M'Ewan's breweries and appeared at all parades until 1889, when two batteries of 16 Pounder Rifled Muzzle Loading guns were issued to the corps and manned by the personnel of four garrison batteries.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have got}} the best idea of it that can be given," [...] said Paul. [...] "It is {{virtually}} posting with a coachman, instead of postillions, few persons in this country, where {{so much of the}} greater distances is done by steam, using their own <b>travelling</b> <b>carriages.</b> The American 'exclusive extra' is not only posting, but, in many of the older parts of the country, it is posting of a very good quality." ...|$|R
6000|$|The sunset struck so brilliantly {{into the}} <b>travelling</b> <b>carriage</b> when it gained the hill-top, that its {{occupant}} was steeped in crimson. [...] "It will die out," [...] said Monsieur the Marquis, glancing at his hands, [...] "directly." ...|$|E
60|$|No {{more was}} required. That {{two years ago}} his godfather should upon certain terms have refused him his house weighed for nothing at the moment. He left his <b>travelling</b> <b>carriage</b> at the little inn and went {{straight}} to M. de Kercadiou.|$|E
6000|$|Soon {{after the}} baronet left the room, a <b>travelling</b> <b>carriage,</b> with {{suitable}} attendants, {{drove to the}} door; {{the sound of the}} wheels drew most of the company to a window. [...] "A baron's coronet!" [...] cried Jane, catching a glimpse of the ornaments of the harness.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Travelling</b> <b>carriages,</b> teams, and waggons, {{laden with}} pictures, [...] carpets, glass, silver, china, and fashionable attire, are rolling [...] {{out of the}} city, {{followed}} by foot-passengers in streams, who carry [...] their most precious possessions on their shoulders. Others bear [...] their sick relatives, caring nothing for their goods, and mothers [...] go laden with their infants. Others drive their cows, sheep, and [...] goats, causing much obstruction. Some of the populace, however, [...] appear apathetic and bewildered, and stand in groups asking questions.|$|R
50|$|The howitzers {{could be}} mounted on either a <b>travelling</b> siege <b>carriage,</b> which {{enabled them to}} be semi-mobile, or on a steel bed, which were then {{positioned}} in fixed defences or fortifications.|$|R
25|$|More {{sites were}} given Bofors guns, and during May {{some of the}} static guns were {{converted}} to semi-mobile status by mounting them on <b>travelling</b> <b>carriages.</b> Also that month, 123rd Z Battery was temporarily attached to the regiment and took over some VPs with its rocket launchers. In September 1941 the regiment provided a cadre of experienced men to provide {{the basis of a}} new 296th LAA Bty formed by 208th LAA Training Regiment at Yeovil. In November this battery joined the regiment, replacing 221st Bty, which was transferred to a newly formed 97th LAA Rgt in 65th AA Brigade.|$|R
60|$|Willing {{to spare}} her own horses, Miss Emmerson had already {{sent to the}} city for the keeper of a livery-stable, to come out and {{contract}} with her for a <b>travelling</b> <b>carriage,</b> to convey her to the Falls of Niagara. The man came, and {{it is no wonder that}} Julia, under her impressions, chose to be present at the conversation.|$|E
60|$|Monsieur the Marquis in his <b>travelling</b> <b>carriage</b> (which {{might have}} been lighter), {{conducted}} by four post-horses and two postilions, fagged up a steep hill. A blush on the countenance of Monsieur the Marquis was no impeachment of his high breeding; it was not from within; it was occasioned by an external circumstance beyond his control--the setting sun.|$|E
60|$|Great Bawbylon is {{far behind}} us. The breezy uplands around tell {{that we have}} reached the Braes of Yarrow. A huge <b>{{travelling}}</b> <b>carriage</b> is slowly toiling {{up the side of}} a hill. Inside are Colonel and Mrs Brentwood, Rosa and chimney-pot Liz. Beside the driver sits Trumps in travelling costume. In the rumble are Susan Blake and Tommy Splint. Rosa's husband and Sam Blake are to follow in a few days.|$|E
60|$|A {{return of}} those {{symptoms}} which had before disquieted Lady Annabel for her daughter, {{and which were}} formerly the cause of their residence at Weymouth, had induced her, {{in compliance with the}} advice of her physicians, to visit Italy; but the fatigue of travel had exhausted the energies of Venetia (for in those days the Alps were not passed in luxurious <b>travelling</b> <b>carriages)</b> on the very threshold of the promised land; and Lady Annabel had been prevailed upon to take a villa on the Lago Maggiore, where Venetia had passed two months, still suffering indeed from great debility, but not without advantage.|$|R
50|$|More than {{a century}} ago, Commodore John Magruder owned two stores in the Washington area. He {{imported}} products to sell to Washingtonians, foreign dignitaries, and those who bought goods while <b>travelling</b> in <b>carriages.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Because, Baas, if he were, {{he would}} not have left Hans, of whom he always thought so well, to run in the sun like a dog, while he and others <b>travel</b> in <b>carriages</b> like great white ladies." ...|$|R
60|$|On the 17th of May, Mrs. Washington, {{accompanied}} by her grandchildren, Eleanor Custis and George Washington Parke Custis {{set out from}} Mount Vernon in her <b>travelling</b> <b>carriage</b> with a small escort of horse, to join her husband at the seat of government: {{as she had been}} accustomed to join him at head-quarters, in the intervals of his revolutionary campaigns. Throughout the journey she was greeted with public testimonials of respect and affection.|$|E
60|$|There is no English {{word for}} vetturino, because where the English {{language}} is spoken, {{there is no}} such thing. The word comes from the Italian word vettura, which means a <b>travelling</b> <b>carriage,</b> and it denotes the man that owns the carriage, and drives it wherever the party that employs him wishes to go. Thus there is somewhat the same relation between the Italian words vettura and vetturino that there is between the English words chariot and charioteer.|$|E
60|$|The morning {{succeeding}} {{the day of}} {{the dinner}} at the Hall, Mrs. Wilson, with all her nieces and her nephew, availed herself of the fineness of the weather to walk to the rectory, where they were all in the habit of making informal and friendly visits. They had just got out of the little village of B----, which lay in their route, when a rather handsome <b>travelling</b> <b>carriage</b> and four passed them, and took the road which led to the Deanery.|$|E
50|$|Hunt {{spent many}} summers {{in and around}} Lexington, Kentucky. He <b>travelled</b> by <b>carriage</b> along with a baggage wagon and saddle horses. The trip from Mississippi took one month. He was related to John Wesley Hunt, {{who lived in the}} Hunt-Morgan House in Lexington.|$|R
60|$|We came to Umballa {{in the hot}} misty dawn, four or five men, who {{had been}} working hard fox eleven months, {{shouting}} for our dales--the two-horse <b>travelling</b> <b>carriages</b> that were to take us up to Kalka {{at the foot of the}} Hills. It was all new to Garm. He did not understand carriages where you lay at full length on your bedding, but Vixen knew and hopped into her place at once; Garin following. The Kalka Road, before the railway was built, was about forty-seven miles long, and the horses were changed every eight miles. Most of them jibbed, and kicked, and plunged, but they had to go, and they went rather better than usual for Garm's deep bay in their rear.|$|R
6000|$|... "I saved all {{the time}} from dinner until the Bartons went to bed, {{which would have been}} lost if I had taken the train. Besides, I like to <b>travel</b> in <b>carriages.</b> One is never too late for a carriage; it is always bound to wait for you." ...|$|R
60|$|The <b>travelling</b> <b>carriage</b> is at {{the door}} which is to bear away the happy pair. Madame Colonna embraces Lucretia; the Marquess gives a grand bow: they are gone. The guests remain awhile. A Prince of the blood will propose a toast; there is another glass of {{champagne}} quaffed, another ortolan devoured; and then they rise and disperse. Madame Colonna leaves with Lady St. Julians, whose guest for a while she is to become. And {{in a few minutes}} their host is alone.|$|E
60|$|They {{all left}} the room together; {{they were in the}} hall; the gentlemen who brought the news looked {{somewhat}} depressed, but Mr. Rigby gay, even amid the prostration of his party, from the consciousness that he had most critically demolished a piece of political gossip and conveyed a certain degree of mortification to a couple of his companions; when a <b>travelling</b> <b>carriage</b> and four with a ducal coronet drove up to the house. The door was thrown open, the steps dashed down, and a youthful noble sprang from his chariot into the hall.|$|E
6000|$|The Major drove rapidly {{from the}} station to the Temple, and found a <b>travelling</b> <b>carriage</b> already before him, and {{blocking}} up the narrow Temple Lane. Two ladies got out of it, and were asking their way of the porters; the Major looked by chance at the panel of the carriage, and saw the worn-out crest of the Eagle looking at the Sun, and the motto, [...] "Nec tenui penna," [...] painted beneath. It was his brother's old carriage, built many, many years ago. It was Helen and Laura that were asking their way to Pen's room.|$|E
50|$|A 10 km {{line from}} Redbank {{to a point}} {{originally}} known as '3 Mile 8 Chains' (now Box Flat Junction) was opened in 1904. From that time a succession of shunt trains serviced the numerous private sidings serving the new mines. Workers <b>travelled</b> in <b>carriages</b> attached to early morning and late afternoon shunt trains.|$|R
50|$|The {{umbrellas}} were embellished {{inside and}} out with pictures of sylphs and fairies in gold, thin gold plates shaped like banyan leaves fastened to the top, and handles of gold adorned with pearls, diamonds, rubies, emeralds, corals and with spangles. The umbrella used by the king when riding an elephant or <b>travelling</b> by <b>carriage</b> was called a yin hti.|$|R
2500|$|It {{was against}} this {{background}} that Lambton met Valerie, Lady Meux, a beautiful socialite. After hearing {{the story of the}} naval guns at Ladysmith, she had ordered six 12-pounder cannon on <b>travelling</b> <b>carriages</b> to be made and sent out to South Africa. Lambton called on her to describe his experiences there, and praise the patriotic spirit of her gift. Lady Meux was [...] "touched by this tribute" [...] and wrote a will making Lambton the heir to the large fortune left by her husband Sir Henry Brent Meux upon his death in 1900, including her house at Theobalds Park in Hertfordshire. The only condition was that Lambton should change his name to Meux. He became a naval aide-de-camp to Queen Victoria on 9 January 1901, attended her funeral on 2 February 1901 and then became naval aide-de-camp to King Edward VII on 25 February 1901.|$|R
60|$|The {{guests were}} {{crowding}} in, and special places were marked for important people. Adam, seeing so many persons of varied degree, looked round for Lady Arabella, {{but could not}} locate her. It was only {{when he saw the}} old- fashioned <b>travelling</b> <b>carriage</b> approach and heard the sound of cheering which went with it, that he realised that Edgar Caswall had arrived. Then, on looking more closely, he saw that Lady Arabella, dressed as he had seen her last, was seated beside him. When the carriage drew up at the great flight of steps, the host jumped down and gave her his hand.|$|E
60|$|The other set {{of wheels}} sounded from the lane Stephen had just traversed. On closer observation, he {{perceived}} {{that they were}} moving from the precincts of the ancient manor-house adjoining the vicarage grounds. A carriage then left the entrance gates of the house, and wheeling round came fully in sight. It was a plain <b>travelling</b> <b>carriage,</b> with a small quantity of luggage, apparently a lady's. The vehicle came to the junction of the four ways half-a-minute before the carrier reached the same spot, and crossed directly in his front, proceeding by the lane on the other side.|$|E
60|$|Heralded by a courier in advance, {{and by the}} {{cracking}} of his postilions' whips, which twined snake-like {{about their}} heads in the evening air, as if he came attended by the Furies, Monsieur the Marquis drew up in his <b>travelling</b> <b>carriage</b> at the posting-house gate. It was hard by the fountain, and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him. He looked at them, and saw in them, without knowing it, the slow sure filing down of misery-worn face and figure, that {{was to make the}} meagreness of Frenchmen an English superstition which should survive the truth through the best part of a hundred years.|$|E
60|$|The {{count was}} loud in his {{expressions}} of regret {{when he heard}} that Julian {{was about to leave}} with his brother at once; but when Julian urged that he was constantly in fear that some chance question might be asked, and that the falseness of his position weighed heavily upon him, the count could not but admit the justice of the view he took. Preparations were immediately begun for departure. They were to travel by sledge through Finland, passing through Vibourg to Abo, and there to cross the Gulf of Bothnia to the Swedish coast, a few miles north of Stockholm, and to travel across the country to Gothenburg. The count placed one of his <b>travelling</b> <b>carriages</b> on runners at their disposal as far as Abo, and insisted on sending one of his own servants with them to attend to their wants on the road.|$|R
50|$|Voltaire {{called him}} a {{universal}} scholar, and commented on the Latin lessons {{he was supposed to}} have given Colbert in his <b>carriage,</b> <b>travelling</b> between Versailles and Paris.|$|R
