40|$|Abstract. The <b>tensile</b> {{strength}} and <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> <b>break</b> of {{epoxidized natural rubber}} (ENR) was investigated by adding different concentration of calcium stearate. Two grades of epoxidized natural rubber (ENR), namely, ENR 25 and ENR 40 were used as model materials. Semi-efficient vulcanization (semi-EV) was used throughout the study. The tensile property of unaged and aged ENR vulcanizates was determined by using U-CAN electron tensile testing machine. Results indicate that <b>tensile</b> {{strength and}} <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> <b>break</b> of unaged ENR 25 and ENR 40 vulcanizates increase gradually with increasing concentration of calcium stearate up to about 1 phr of calcium stearate and after which, the <b>tensile</b> strength and <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> <b>break</b> drop with a further increase in calcium stearate loading. For a similar alcium stearate concentration, the <b>tensile</b> strength and <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> <b>break</b> of ENR 40 vulcanizates exhibits a consistently higher value than that of ENR 25 vulcanizates, {{which is due to}} the higher crosslink density of ENR 40 which contains more epoxide groups than ENR 25.

The mechanical properties of rubber-toughened polypropylene nanocomposites (RTPPNCs) were studied through tensile, flexural and impact tests. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used for investigation of the phase morphology and rubber particles size. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was employed to characterize the formation of nanocomposites. The thermal properties were investigated by using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The dynamic mechanical properties were examined by using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). From the tensile and flexural tests, the optimum loading of organoclay in RTPP was found to be 6 wt%.

While the latter approach resembles the wood plastic composite (WPC) manufacture, the former is similar to plasticizing chemical pulp by esterification to obtain cellulose acetate and other (mixed) esters. On the WPC route, filler loads of up to 8 0 % were reached while maintaining tensile strength, increasing modulus up to more than five times the starting value reaching 3 GPa and increasing HDT from 45 to 105 °C.

40|$|The objectivea of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} right amount of DOP content in PVC Sole Compound made from the mixture of non reclaimed PVC material and reclaimed PVC materials, in order to increase its tensile strenght, <b>tensile</b> stretch and <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> <b>break.</b> With basic formula which contains non reclaimed PVC materials 60 phr *), reclaimed PVC materials 40 phr, epoxy 6 phr, BaCdZn 2 phr, CaCO 3 10 phr, Carbon black 0, 05 phr and DOP 60 phr, it can be found that the sole compound meets the SII 1103 - 84 “Sol Lentur cetak PVC”. The physical properties of the sole compound as tensile strength, <b>tensile</b> stretch and <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> <b>break</b> should be ancreased anyway, because the result showed that the figures close to the minium standard. A study on preparation of sole compound mode with DOP content of 60 phr, 50 phr and 40 phr hqd been conducted. In order ti increase the physical properties of the sole compound such as tensile strength, <b>tensile</b> stretch ang <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> <b>break.</b> After being vulcanizead, the sole then were tested in accordance with SII 1103 - 84 “ Sol lentur cetak PVC”. There is no significant difference in the physical properties between the addition of 60 phr DOP and 50 phr and 40 phr DOP, while the addition of 50 phr and 40 phr DOP does not significantly affect the best. An addition of 50 phr and 40 phr of DOP contet can increase the physical properties such as tensile strength, <b>tensile</b> stretch, <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> <b>break,</b> permanent set, abrasion resistance and tear strength. The right amount of DOP wich can be added to PVC compound for sole using the mentined above is 40 phr. ...|$|R
40|$|Several {{methods of}} {{incorporating}} sago pith waste (SPW) into poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) had been conducted: (i) dry blending (PVA/SPW/G), (ii) blending of SPW and pre-plasticized PVA (pPVA/SPW/G) and (iii) blending of pre-plasticized of both PVA and SPW (pPVA/pSPW). The {{effect of the}} compounding method on the mechanical and water absorption properties were investigated. The addition of SPW into PVA greatly reduced the <b>tensile</b> strength and <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> <b>break.</b> The <b>tensile</b> strength and <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> <b>break</b> of PVA/SPW composites with identical geometry during compounding stage (powder/powder and pellet/pellet), which were PVA/SPW/G and pPVA/pSPW yielded the highest value.

40|$|Additives are {{costly and}} can have {{negative}} environmental effects. Thus, searching for other alternatives to improve recycling plastics without using additives is necessary. This study aims {{to improve the}} hoop <b>tensile</b> strength, <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> <b>break,</b> and shrinkage of the ring stopper made from an acrylonitrile butadiene styrene blend comprising 40 % recyclates through the optimization of processing parameters using the Taguchi method. By adopting the L 9 Taguchi orthogonal array, four controllable factors each at three levels are tested to determine the optimal combination of factors and levels in the injection moulding process. Considering the multiple quality characteristics involved in this study, we investigate the effects of processing parameters on hoop <b>tensile</b> strength, <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> <b>break,</b> and shrinkage of the ring stopper both separately and simultaneously because changing a parameter can result in the improvement or deterioration of each quality response and of the overall product performance. The results revealed that the performance of an injection-moulded ring stopper under the optimal process conditions is equivalent or slightly better {{than that of the}} part produced from virgin resin. The performance of recycled plastics can be effectively enhanced to levels comparable with virgin resins using the Taguchi optimization approach...|$|R
40|$|Coconut shell (CS) {{is one of}} agro-waste {{material}} {{which has}} high natural lignocellulosics content. This material provides a potential resource as a reinforcement agent in thermoplastic elastomeric olefin (TEO). In this study, CS was used as filler in TEO composites. The effect of CS loading and Maleic Anhydride Polypropylene (MAPP) as compatibilizer on mechanical properties, morphology and thermal properties were studied. Results show that the increasing of CS loading has increased the <b>tensile</b> strength, <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> <b>break</b> and Young's modulus of TEO/CS composites. At similar content, the effect of PP-g-MA as compatibilizer has improved the <b>tensile</b> strength, <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> <b>break</b> and Young's modulus of TEO/CS composites. The SEM study of the tensile fracture surface of compatibilized composites indicates {{that the presence of}} PP-g-MA increased the interfacial interaction. TGA results show that the composites with addition of MAPP as a compatibilizer has better the thermal stability compared to composites without addition of MAPP at 600 °C. DSC analysis showed that the addition of MAPP decreases the crystallinity of TEO/CS composites. It was found that the presence of MAPP will extended the molecular chain of the TEO/CS composites.   Keywords: thermoplastic olefin, coconut shell, compatibilizer, composite...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Polypropylene/wood flour {{composites}} {{with different}} nanoclay and maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (PP-g-MA) contents were fabricated by melt compounding {{and then by}} injection molding. The mechanical properties, such as flexural modulus, <b>tensile</b> modulus, <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> <b>break,</b> and impact strength, were evaluated. Results indicated that the flexural modulus, <b>tensile</b> modulus, and <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> <b>break</b> increases with increase of nanoclay up to 3 phc at the same concentration of PP-g-MA, and then decreases. However, the impact strength of the composites decreases with increased nanoclay loading. Also, the effect of compatibilzer was positive in terms of enhancing the mechanical properties of the composites. The morphology of the nanocomposites has been examined by using X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Morphological findings revealed that intercalation form, the sample with 3 phc concentration of clay, which implies {{the formation of the}} intercalation morphology and better dispersion than 6 phc, and the d-spacing of clay layers in the composite were improved in the presence of compatibilizer...|$|R
