6000|$|But {{you come}} again, in p. 269 to the scripture first urged by you, 'If any man will do his will,' &c. {{and you tell}} us, that this must also needs be implied, he shall rightly {{understand}} the doctrine too; which word (understand) you so carry, as may best help you in case you should meet with an adversary. As if any should thus object, that here you have granted that the words make promise of {{an understanding of the}} gospel; yea require in it the very first act of the will; then you readily shift it by saying, That this is implied only, suggesting that obedience to morals is expressed, and therefore must first be thought on and done. But if one of your brotherhood stop here, and make the objection; then you add, 'It is knowledge, at least, in all the necessary points thereof, absolutely necessary and essential parts, from among which you long since did cast out, [...] "Coming to God by Jesus Christ."' Yea you add, 'That by [that which you call] the design of the gospel, it may be presumed, that whosoever considereth it, with a design of being so, [that is, of living up to human principles, and that desireth to be possessed again of the holiness he hath lost, for <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> the proof of which you have written above 300 pages] he must needs believe the gospel to have come from God, and also be enlightened in the true knowledge of at least the necessary points of it,' viz. All moral duties contained therein, which are never a one of them as such an essential of the gospel, but are such duties as are consequential to the belief thereof.|$|E

Pakistan’s media has moved quite fast and is trying to beat the international hues of media. Our media is trying to highlight the problems but solutions are quite suppressed and left out in the open. Hence, it leads to more agitation and detained communication leading to despair of the nation. The role of the media is to voice the real information of the world. It is trying to bring a positive change by various forms for better socio-economic conditions in the long run but why one views so much grim in today’s media channels, print and radio. In particular, talk shows on Pakistan’s different media channels have hyped so much for different topic agendas, which is leading to nowhere.
