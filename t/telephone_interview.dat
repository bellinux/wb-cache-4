He claimed that the remaining students were willing to leave the mosque and lay down their arms, provided the government would grant them amnesty and not fire on them.

In a <b>telephone</b> <b>interview</b> from a live transmission of Geo TV, Ghazi Abdul Rashid denied all {{the charges against him}} and reiterated his innocence. He further negotiated with the government for his safe passage and a guarantee that no harm would come to his followers inside the mosque.

In the first week of the massacres, there were reports in the Israeli press that Israel did not want to put all its ground forces in Gaza because it was preparing attacks on Iran. Then there were reports it was planning attacks on Lebanon. It is a lunatic state.|$|E

Nevertheless, 8.6% of men and 15.1% of women reported either feelings of attraction to the same gender or some sexual experience with the same gender. Overall, 8.6% of women and 5.9% of men reported some homosexual experience in their lives; these figures fell to 5.7% and 5.0% respectively when non-genital sexual experience was excluded. Half the men and two thirds of the women who had same-sex sexual experience regarded themselves as heterosexual rather than homosexual.|$|E

40|$|This article {{considers}} spoken {{interaction in}} semi-structured qualitative research interviews, comparing {{those that are}} conducted by telephone or face-to-face. It draws upon recent empirical research that illuminated {{some of the differences}} that may be observed between these two interview modes. Methodological techniques drawn from Conversation Analysis were used to conduct a systematic and transparent comparison of the interview interactions, focusing on the spoken interactional devices that researcher and interviewee employ in order to pursue and maintain a collaborative and comprehensible dialogue. The article begins with an overview of previous discussion on the interactional effects of the <b>telephone</b> in qualitative <b>interviews.</b> Here, we find that while instructional texts have traditionally advised that the telephone mode is not well-suited to the task of qualitative interviewing - primarily because the lack of face-to-face contact is said to restrict the development of rapport and a 'natural' encounter - researchers giving personal accounts of conducting <b>telephone</b> <b>interviews</b> tend to offer more nuanced or critical reflections {{on the extent to which}} the lack of visual cues affects the interaction in practice. Empirical findings are then presented on: formulation and completion, clarification and comprehension, acknowledgement, interviewees' checks on the 'adequacy' of their talk, and the duration of interviews. Key findings were that: completion or formulation of interviewee talk by the researcher was more common in face-to-face interviews, interviewee requests for clarification were slightly more common in <b>telephone</b> <b>interviews,</b> vocalized acknowledgements given by the researcher were less frequent in <b>telephone</b> <b>interviews,</b> interviewee checks on the adequacy of their responses were more common in <b>telephone</b> <b>interviews,</b> and <b>telephone</b> <b>interviews</b> tended to be shorter than those conducted face-to-face.

40|$|Very little {{research}} has investigated the comparability of telephone and face-to-face employment interviews. This exploratory study investigated interviewers' questioning strategies and applicants' causal attributions produced during semi structured telephone and face-to-face graduate recruitment interviews (N= 62). A total of 2044 causal attributions were extracted from verbatim transcripts of these 62 interviews. It was predicted that an absence of visual cues would lead applicants to produce, and interviewers to focus on, information that might reduce the comparative anonymity of <b>telephone</b> <b>interviews.</b> Results indicate that applicants produce more personal causal attributions in <b>telephone</b> <b>interviews.</b> Personal attributions are also associated with higher ratings in telephone, but not face-to-face interviews. In face-to-face interviews, applicants who attributed outcomes to more global causes received lower ratings. There was also a non-significant tendency for interviewers to ask more closed questions in <b>telephone</b> <b>interviews.</b> The implications of these findings for research and practice are discussed...|$|R

The reaction in the Vancouver media was largely of surprise that Gillis would trade away a well-performing rookie. Vancouver Sun columnist Iain MacIntyre declared it [...] "a stunner" [...] and [...] "one of the most unpopular trades in Vancouver in years." [...] Another Sun article likened the deal to a lopsided 1996 trade between the Canucks and Pittsburgh Penguins in which two first-round prospects of opposite playing styles – the skilled Markus Näslund and the larger, more aggressive Alek Stojanov – were exchanged. Näslund {{went on to become}} the Canucks' all-time leading goal- and point-scorer, while the latter had a short career in the minor leagues.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: For {{reasons of}} feasibility, {{diagnostic}} <b>telephone</b> <b>interviews</b> are frequently used in research of psychiatric morbidity. However, {{it is unknown}} whether diagnostic <b>telephone</b> <b>interviews</b> are as valid as diagnostic face-to-face interviews. RESEARCH QUESTION: Are diagnostic <b>telephone</b> <b>interviews</b> for psychiatric disorders as valid as diagnostic face-to-face interviews? METHOD: A systematic review of original studies in PubMed, PsychINFO and Embase was carried out. We included studies considering (1) the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic <b>telephone</b> <b>interviews</b> using face-to-face interviews as a golden standard and (2) the agreement between diagnostic telephone and diagnostic face-to-face interviews. Eligible were studies in the general population, in patients at risk for psychiatric disorders and in psychiatric outpatients. We assessed risk of bias with the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies (QUADAS) instrument. RESULTS: We included sixteen studies. The included studies were generally small with thirteen studies reporting about < 100 participants. Specificity was generally high in populations with low or intermediate prevalence of psychiatric morbidity. Sensitivity was low in these populations, but slightly higher in samples with more psychiatric disorders. Studies with {{a higher risk of}} psychiatric disorders generally reported higher percentages of agreement and higher kappa values. Considering the QUADAS- 2 criteria, most studies had a medium or high risk of bias, especially concerning patient selection and unbiased judgement of the test. Of the six studies with a medium or low risk of bias, the three studies assessing current anxiety and depressive disorders yielded kappa values between 0. 69 and 0. 84, indicating good agreement. DISCUSSION: There is insufficient evidence that diagnostic <b>telephone</b> <b>interviews</b> for the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders are valid, although results for depression and anxiety disorders seem promising...|$|R
