In the late 1960s, some Vanajas were equipped with British Ergomatic forward control cabins made by Motor Panels. <b>The</b> <b>cabins</b> were bought via A.E.C.|$|E
5|$|The park's {{land was}} once home to Native Americans, {{followed}} by settlers who cleared the forests for subsistence farming and later built sawmills. The second growth forests in and surrounding Worlds End State Park are partially {{a result of}} the efforts of the young men of the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression. They helped overcome the clearcutting of the early 20th century, and built many of the park's facilities, including <b>the</b> <b>cabins</b> that earned it a place on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
50|$|In October 2014, News.com.au {{featured}} a profile on <b>The</b> <b>Cabin</b> and {{a visit to}} <b>the</b> facility. <b>The</b> <b>Cabin</b> announced <b>The</b> <b>Cabin</b> Hong Kong, <b>the</b> first outpatient addiction treatment facility in Asia, in November 2014. In July 2015, <b>The</b> <b>Cabin</b> Chiang Mai announced an outpatient facility in Sydney, Australia called <b>The</b> <b>Cabin</b> Sydney.

5|$|The site of <b>the</b> <b>cabins</b> {{became a}} tourist {{attraction}} as early as 1854. In the 1880s, Charles McGlashan began promoting {{the idea of a}} monument to mark the site of the Donner Party episode. He helped to acquire the land for a monument and, in June 1918, the statue of a pioneer family was placed on the spot where the Breen-Keseberg cabin was thought to have been, dedicated to the Donner Party. It was made a California Historical Landmark in 1934.|$|E
5|$|After {{the lodge}} was completed, {{it was decided}} to build a {{restaurant}} and breezeway onto the lodge building. Logs for most of the project were shipped via railroad {{from as far away as}} Oregon and Washington state, unloaded in Stratford, Illinois and dragged to the construction site by teams of horses. The CCC project also completed sixteen one-room log cabins and three four-bedroom cabins. The work crews also built picnic shelters, trail shelters, and foot bridges. Only the logs for <b>the</b> <b>cabins</b> came from another source. They were purchased from a salvage company that had purchased utility poles from a defunct utility company at the price of 30 cents a piece.|$|E
5|$|Each {{ship had}} {{a crew of}} 854{{officers}} and enlisted men. The enlisted crew spaces were located forward in the upper deck, and were cramped and unhygienic. <b>The</b> <b>cabins</b> for non-commissioned officers were also located here. The superstructure included several cabins for senior officers. The ships were initially painted black but in the 1920s they were repainted gray. Alfonso XIII wore a white identification band on her funnel and Jaime I wore two, though both ships had them removed {{after the start of}} the Civil War. Jaime I was also repainted dark gray at this time.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to copying and restoring portraits, the serjeant-painters also undertook decorative tasks, {{such as the}} painting of banners and stage scenery. Parchment rolls of the Office of the Works record that De Critz oversaw the decorating of royal houses and palaces. Since Peake’s work is not recorded there, {{it seems as if}} De Critz took responsibility for the more decorative tasks, while Peake continued his work as a royal portrait painter. However, Peake and Paul Isackson painted <b>the</b> <b>cabins,</b> carvings, and armorials on the ship the Prince Royal in 1611.|$|E
5|$|Later, at FBI headquarters, Fox Mulder shows Dana Scully a {{photo of}} the missing loggers, telling her that another group of loggers {{disappeared}} in the forest in 1934. The two agents head to the forest, where they meet Park Ranger Larry Moore and Steve Humphreys, head of security for the logging company. While driving through the forest, their truck hits caltrops left in the ground by eco-terrorists, forcing them to walk the rest of the way. Upon arriving at the camp site, Mulder and Scully find <b>the</b> <b>cabins</b> abandoned and the communication equipment destroyed. Searching the forest, they find a corpse encased in a large cocoon hanging from a tree.|$|E
5|$|The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was a work relief {{program for}} young men from {{unemployed}} families, established in 1933. As part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal legislation, {{it was designed to}} combat unemployment during the Great Depression. The CCC operated in every U.S. state. The recreational development of the park began in 1933, when four CCC camps were built in Sullivan County. One of these, CCC Camp S-95, built many of the park facilities, such as the dam for the swimming area, <b>the</b> <b>cabins,</b> hiking trails and roads. The CCC workers blasted out bedrock in the creek for the swimming area and built the Canyon Vista road and lookout.|$|E
2500|$|In acquiescing to {{the public}} {{campaign}} to save <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> <b>the</b> Board of Control for the Park insisted that they be allowed to use <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> as a shelter and reserved the right to remove <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> at any time.

5|$|The {{settlers}} took shelter {{inside the}} fort {{while the men}} and boys took up their positions at the portholes inside the fort. A vicious firefight erupted, involving around 150 of Black Hawk's British Band. The battle raged {{for about an hour}} with heavy gunfire from both sides. At the battle's onset many of the settlement's women had been huddled in and around <b>the</b> <b>cabins,</b> but several married woman, including Elizabeth Armstrong, rallied the women and older children to provide support to the soldiers. She assigned the unmarried young women, boys, and girls as young as eight years old to such tasks as cutting and rolling gunpowder cartridges and molding rifleballs. The married women reloaded the weapons while the soldiers tried to maintain an increased rate of fire.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to refloat her, Captain Pearce ordered Gothenburg to be {{lightened}} forward. Water casks used as ballast and passengers were positioned aft in an endeavour to refloat her as the tide rose, but without success. Finally, a fatal {{attempt was made to}} refloat her, by reversing the engine hard. The vessel came half off the reef, but holed herself badly and then slewed broadside to the waves, in a much worse position. However, with the tide rising and some cargo now being dumped overboard, all aboard still expected Gothenburg to float free. With strong winds changing direction and seas increasing, the boiler fires were extinguished by water rising through the damaged stern. Around midnight, the chief engineer came on deck to report that the engine room was flooded and the engine was of no further use. With heavy seas now rushing down hatchways and into <b>the</b> <b>cabins,</b> Gothenburg was doomed and Captain Pearce was forced to admit that the situation had become desperate.|$|E
5|$|Sixty {{members and}} {{associates}} of the Breen, Graves, Reed, Murphy, Keseberg, and Eddy families {{set up for}} the winter at Truckee Lake. Three widely separated cabins of pine logs served as their homes, with dirt floors and poorly constructed flat roofs that leaked when it rained. The Breens occupied one cabin, the Eddys and Murphys another, and Reeds and Graveses the third. Keseberg built a lean-to for his family {{against the side of the}} Breen cabin. The families used canvas or oxhide to patch the faulty roofs. <b>The</b> <b>cabins</b> had no windows or doors, only large holes to allow entry. Of the 60 at Truckee Lake, 19 were men over 18, 12 were women, and 29 were children, 6 of whom were toddlers or younger. Farther down the trail, close to Alder Creek, the Donner families hastily constructed tents to house 21 people, including Mrs. Wolfinger, her child, and the Donners' drivers: 6 men, 3 women, and 12 children in all. It began to snow again on the evening of November 4—the beginning of a storm that lasted 8 days.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Dietrich <b>Cabin</b> is a {{log cabin}} located in Ottawa City Park in Ottawa, Kansas. Jacob Dietrich, a German immigrant, built <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> in 1859; <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> {{replaced}} his original home, which was built in 1857 and burned down the following year. After Dietrich died in 1863, his wife maintained <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> while raising their three sons. <b>The</b> <b>cabin</b> later became a farmhouse, and several rooms were added to it.

It is the first of its type to be installed in Hong Kong. Martin Leitner, chief sales officer of Leitner, explained that the cable car system used in Hong Kong is much heavier and bigger than that used in Austria. He said the steel columns used to support the system have to be stronger, and thus more expensive.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Arnwine <b>Cabin</b> {{was built}} using hewn poplar logs between 1795 and 1820, and its first known {{occupant}} was John Wesley Arnwine. <b>The</b> <b>cabin</b> was originally located along the Clinch River near the Liberty Hill community in Grainger County.
