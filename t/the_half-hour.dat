5|$|In {{the next}} over, Compton greatly troubled Bradman, who edged two balls and was dropped once. At the other end, Morris {{continued}} {{to take advantage}} of Hutton's inaccurate leg breaks, and Australia reached lunch at 1/121, with the opener on 63 and his captain on 35. Hutton had conceded 30 runs in four overs, and in <b>the</b> <b>half-hour</b> preceding the interval, Australia had added 64 runs. Although Australia had scored at a reasonable rate, they had also been troubled by many of the deliveries and were expected to face further difficulty if they were to avoid defeat.|$|E
5|$|The shorts were {{featured}} on the first three seasons on The Tracey Ullman Show. By the fourth and last season of The Tracey Ullman Show the first season of <b>the</b> <b>half-hour</b> show was on the air. In the two first seasons the shorts were divided into three or four parts, but in the third season they were played as a single story. Tracey Ullman later filed a lawsuit, claiming that her show {{was the source of}} The Simpsons success and therefore should receive a share of the show's profit. Eventually the courts ruled in favor of the network.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though this}} episode aired {{as the last}} episode of the first season, {{it was the first}} episode in {{production}} and was intended to be the first episode to air from <b>the</b> <b>half-hour</b> show. The series is a spin-off from The Tracey Ullman Show in which the family already appeared in a series of animated one-minute shorts. The characters were already created, but had to be further developed in order to carry a half-hour show. The episode was therefore meant as an introduction to the characters. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening and writer/producer Sam Simon (of such television series as Cheers) wrote the script for the episode. Both Groening and Simon are credited with developing the series along with executive producer James L. Brooks. The name of Ms. Botz was based on a real person that once babysat Groening.|$|E

5|$|In {{the next}} over, Compton deceived Bradman with a googly. Bradman {{expected}} {{the ball to}} turn in, but it went the other way, took the outside edge and ran away past slip for four. Bradman leg-glanced the next one for another boundary, before again failing to read a googly on the third ball. This time the edge went to Crapp, who failed to hold on. The sixth ball of Compton's over beat Bradman and hit him on the pads. At the other end, Morris continued to plunder Hutton's inaccurate leg breaks, and Australia reached lunch at 1/121, with Morris on 63 and Bradman on 35. Hutton had conceded 30 runs in four overs, and in <b>the</b> <b>half-hour</b> preceding the interval, Australia had added 64 runs. Both players had been given lives. Although Australia had scored at a reasonable rate, they had also been troubled {{by many of the}} deliveries and were expected to face further difficulty if they were to avoid defeat.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{created the}} first chance {{of the game in}} the 20th minute. A pass from John Barnes sent Steve Nicol clear to shoot, but his effort saw the ball roll wide of the far post. Liverpool created a further {{opportunity}} six minutes after – from a free-kick delivered by Barnes on the left, Rush managed to outjump his marker and head the ball {{in the direction of the}} Arsenal goal. It however hit the near post and rebounded in the direction of Arsenal goalkeeper John Lukic. Minutes after <b>the</b> <b>half-hour</b> mark, Liverpool scored the opening goal – a long ball from Barry Venison went behind the Arsenal defence and reached Peter Beardsley. Unimpeded, he controlled the ball and shot it with his right foot to score. Arsenal's Kevin Richardson missed a chance to level the scoreline after good play by Lee Dixon; from outside the penalty box he scuffed his shot and the ball went over the crossbar.|$|E

According to the Nielsen ratings, the show had a 47.4 household rating; among adults 18–49 it had a 41.5 rating, compared with the game average of 40.5. Reuters noted that <b>the</b> <b>half-hour</b> from 9:30 to 9:58 ET peaked at a 50.7 household rating and a 72 share, with 117.7 million viewers.

Madonna set a record as the most-tweeted subject on Twitter (10,245 posts in one second, {{with an average of}} 8,000 tweets per second for five minutes) and was the most-searched term on Google during the show. Wired CEO Mark Ghuneim tweeted that less than one-third of the tweets were negative, 59 percent were positive and 11 percent were neutral. According to Billboard, the day after the show its ratings and economic impact were discussed.|$|E

5|$|Manchester City had {{the first}} attack of the match, but it came to nothing. Soon Everton began to {{dominate}} the match, with Dean frequently involved in the attacking play. Several Everton attacks came on their left flank. Stein caused Manchester City right-back Sid Cann problems, and Cann was forced to concede a corner kick on several occasions. Just after <b>the</b> <b>half-hour</b> Everton had their first shot on target, when Stein's effort was saved by Langford. Another chance quickly arrived. Stein's cross passed in front of goal, but Dean was unable {{to connect with the}} ball. Two minutes later Manchester City goalkeeper Langford attempted to catch a cross from Britton, but dropped the ball under pressure from Dean. The ball fell into the path of Stein, who put the ball into the empty net to give Everton the lead. At half-time Everton led 1–0.|$|E
5|$|RB Leipzig faced Sevilla in {{the opening}} match of the tournament; the German side were without striker Timo Werner, but manager Ralph Hasenhüttl named new signing Jean-Kevin Augustin in his first eleven. Midfielder Emil Forsberg forced Sevilla goalkeeper Sergio Rico into action early on with a shot, but the ball was comfortably held on to. RB Leipzig {{continued}} to create chances and in the 18th minute a ball played over the Sevilla defence found Augustin. The forward's volley however flew over the goal and into the stand. Sevilla's first meaningful attack just after <b>the</b> <b>half-hour</b> mark resulted in a penalty. Bernardo's challenge on Walter Montoya in the penalty area was adjudged as a foul, despite video replays showing the defender managed to take the ball off the Sevilla midfielder. Wissam Ben Yedder stepped up to take the penalty and duly converted to give Sevilla the lead. The scoreline remained 1–0, despite both clubs' best efforts to score.|$|E

BBC Director General Mark Thompson confirmed that up to a further 1,000 jobs could be created or transferred to the site.

5|$|Arsenal {{in their}} usual home strip of red shirts and white shorts {{kicked off the}} match and {{immediately}} won a corner, which was dealt with by Westerveld. A run by Heskey six minutes later resulted in the player taking a tumble under Gilles Grimandi's challenge, but his appeals for a penalty were ignored by referee Dunn. Arsenal began to dominate play, with Vieira {{at the heart of}} their best moves. The midfielder won a challenge with Heskey in the 17th minute and sent the ball in the direction of Fredrik Ljungberg, who in turn passed it to Henry. The Frenchman went around Westerveld and shot the ball goalwards, which was cleared off the line by Stéphane Henchoz. Television replays later showed the ball hitting Henchoz's arm before going wide; although Henry appealed for a penalty, it was turned down as the incident was missed by both the referee and his assistant. Owen came close to scoring in the 20th minute, but for his shot to be blocked by Martin Keown. Arsenal continued to find the best openings, but struggled to split open the Liverpool defence. A long range effort by Grimandi was easily saved by Westerveld as the final approached <b>the</b> <b>half-hour</b> mark, and a duel between Wiltord and Jamie Carragher on the right side resulted in a Liverpool corner. Two minutes before the interval Henry was penalised for drifting into an offside position, having collected a long pass.|$|E
5|$|Promotion for the St-Pierre and Penn contest {{began in}} November 2008, with UFC President Dana White, {{and the two}} main event fighters embarking on {{publicity}} tours in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and Honolulu, Hawaii. The fighters answered various fan questions, and signed autographs. In an effort to further promote the contest, the UFC introduced UFC Primetime, a three-part series that cost $1.7 million to produce. UFC Primetime detailed the final preparations of St-Pierre and Penn's before their fight. Spike aired <b>the</b> <b>half-hour</b> episodes on the final three Wednesdays {{leading up to the}} fight, beginning on January 14, 2009 and concluding on January 28, 2009. Camera crews spent twenty five days with each fighter rather than the three days for a standard UFC Countdown preview show, and episodes aired shortly after they were filmed. The episodes were aired quickly to provide weekly updates on each fighter's current status. After the first episode aired, it was reported by MMAjunkie.com that B.J. Penn was unhappy with his portrayal in the program, and wanted to withdraw from the project. Penn made a subsequent appearance on TapouT radio to discuss this report and confirmed that he has taken issue with his portrayal on the show. He was adamant that he would not continue to allow filming unless his portrayal changed. In the end, UFC Primetime proved to be a ratings success, as it was announced by Spike that the program was the most watched UFC preview show ever, drawing 1.4 million viewers for its first episode (880,000 viewers for first airing and 614,000 viewers for an immediate repeat). The second episode averaged 825,000 viewers, while the third episode drew 662,000 viewers.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 2009, the {{producers}} of Sesame Street took steps to bring back older viewers; it was also successful in increasing its audience viewership among 3-to-5 year-olds {{by the end of}} the 40th season. In 2012, the show's 43rd season, Elmo's World was replaced with Elmo the Musical, which was targeted at the program's older viewers. Subsequently in September 2014, starting with the show's 45th season, Sesame Workshop began distributing a half-hour version of the program to PBS member stations. The new version, which complemented the existing hour-long broadcast and focuses more on interstitial segments (although certain segments such as Elmo the Musical or Abby's Flying Fairy School are omitted from that version), was added because of increasing mobile and online viewing among children as well as growing competition for preschoolers on linear and online television, an increase in use of PBS Kids' mobile video app during 2013 and decreasing broadcast viewership; <b>the</b> <b>half-hour</b> version airs weekday afternoons on PBS member television stations (with the hour-long version continuing to air in the morning) and was made available for streaming online and on mobile devices through PBS' website, mobile app and Roku channel.|$|E

It took Müller five matches for him to get his first league goal; he scored it against Schalke 04 in Bayern's 2–0 win. Müller then scored in Bayern's next home game {{in the early stages of}} the match, which the went on to win, 3–0. On 26 November 2011, Müller netted the opener on <b>the</b> <b>half-hour</b> in Bayern's 6–0 thrashing of FC Ingolstadt, giving him his second DFB-Pokal goal. Müller was on the short-list of this year's FIFA Ballon d'Or award. On 10 and 15 January, in Bayern's warm up friendlies, Müller scored three goals in two games, a brace against the India national team (which Bayern then went on to win 4–0) and one goal in Bayern's other 4–0 victory over Rot-Weiß Erfurt. Müller provided two assists in Bayern's win over VfB Stuttgart in the DFB-Pokal. On 11 February, Bayern played 1. FC Kaiserslautern and Müller ended a goal drought lasting since 24 September 2011 with a header in their 2–0 victory. On 31 March 2012, Müller played his 100th Bundesliga game against 1. FC Nürnberg. On 19 May 2012, Müller scored the opening goal in the Champions League final against Chelsea with a powerful header. He was substituted shortly afterwards. Bayern Munich, however, lost the final on penalties. Müller stated how dissatisfied he was about the amount of time he had spent on the bench recently. Müller said that although he was dissatisfied he wanted to stay at Bayern. During the season, Müller scored seven goals in 34 league matches, two goals in five German Cup matches, and two goals in 14 Champions League matches.|$|E
