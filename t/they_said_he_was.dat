500|$|The {{idea for}} the show came from Conan O'Brien, who thought of Marge getting {{a job at the}} power plant and that Mr. Burns has a crush on her. The animators had trouble animating Marge with the suit and lipstick. Director Jeff Lynch said there were a few scenes where Marge [...] "looks like a monster". All the jargon used by Troy McClure was {{accurately}} taken from a Time–Life foundation repair book. The original subplot for the episode was Mr. Burns telling Homer to dress up as Mister Atom and have him go to schools to talk to the children. The cast really liked Tom Jones as a guest star. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> fun to work with, and was really nice, and even offered to perform a concert after he was done recording lines.|$|E
2500|$|Police {{said they}} found {{evidence}} on the man's computer that he has conducted a thorough inspection of Milan's synagogue, with information on the security measures used and the police who guard the building.

60|$|While my {{companion}} {{talked with the}} women, I talked with the old man. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> old and foolish, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> evidently too knowing for them.|$|R
5000|$|... "But they {{supposed}} {{that he would}} begin to swell up, {{and that he would}} suddenly fall down and die. But expecting long, and seeing that there came no harm to him, changing their minds, <b>they</b> <b>said,</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a god (theón)." ...|$|R

According to the Times report, Shelby said, “Well his father was Kenyan and <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> born in Hawaii, but I haven’t seen any birth certificate. You have to be born in America to be president.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Monson is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} world's top submission grapplers. He is a multiple event winner at NAGA, Grapplers Quest and FILA, among other submission tournaments. He is nicknamed [...] "The Snowman" [...] for his performance at the 1999 Abu Dhabi Combat Club Submission Wrestling World Championship. The Brazilian fighters at the tournament gave him the nickname because he came in as an unknown, but beat four Brazilians in a row to win the 88–98 kilogram weight class. As he went along in the tournament and continued to beat his opponents, <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> like a snowball (white, compact, rolling and getting bigger and stronger as the tournament went on).|$|E
2500|$|The UN Security Council {{passed a}} {{resolution}} on 8 January 2009 calling for an immediate ceasefire to the hostilities in the Gaza Strip. It passed 14–0–1, with one abstention from the United States. Olmert told reporters, [...] " [...] was left shamed. A resolution that she prepared and arranged, {{and in the end}} she did not vote in favor. In the night between Thursday and Friday, when the Secretary of State wanted to lead the vote on a ceasefire at the Security Council, we did not want her to vote in favor. I said 'get me President Bush on the phone'. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in the middle of giving a speech in Philadelphia. I said I didn't care. 'I need to talk to him now'. He got off the podium and spoke to me. I told him the United States could not vote in favor. It cannot vote in favor of such a resolution. He immediately called the Secretary of State and told her not to vote in favor." [...] When asked about the comments, a White House spokesman said that Olmert's version of events was [...] "inaccurate".|$|E
5000|$|<b>He</b> <b>is</b> the {{representation}} of Roppongi Station, which starts the Oedo Line. Roppongi Station <b>is</b> numbered E23. <b>He</b> has red-brown hair and blue eyes. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> a kind, calm mature person who is capable of seeing what troubles someone, as shown in episodes 1 and 2 where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> able to catch onto {{the fact that both}} customers had something bothering them beside what <b>they</b> <b>said.</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> considered boring because he tends to talk less often than the other stations and has a quiet, slightly shy but friendly demeanor. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> particularly good with computers and often writes reports on their customers and how they helped them. His catchphrase, which he often uses to reassure his fellow train stations is [...] "Don't mind".|$|R
6000|$|The two {{officers}} {{looked at each}} other, and the smaller one gave a long whistle. 'It is the very man!' <b>said</b> <b>he.</b> 'This comes of asking questions!

60|$|Rollo {{asked where}} Waldron was, and <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in his room, packing his trunk. So Rollo {{went to find}} him.|$|E

60|$|There {{could be}} but one opinion as to that, {{everyone}} thought, and when Halvor heard what <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not long in flinging off his beggar's rags and arraying {{himself as a}} bridegroom.|$|E
6000|$|He {{did better}} than ever next night, and <b>they</b> all <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{improving}} fast; and Mr. Alfredi told 'im in a whisper that <b>he</b> thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> better at it than Kumbo.

50|$|When Emelec was disqualified {{from the}} 2007 Ecuadorian Championship, the club held {{elections}} {{to select a}} new management.

6000|$|... "Ah, Mr. Philip!" [...] said Mr. Deane, {{when they}} entered the dining-room, [...] "I've not seen you for a long while. Your father's not at home, I think, is he? I went after him to the office the other day, and <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> out of town." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-bye," [...] said Joan steadily. She {{gave him}} her cold hand and looked calmly {{into his face}} without quailing. She had loved him with all her heart, but now a fatal scorn of him was already {{mingling}} with her love. He was what <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> a scamp without principle or honour.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Troth, am I,' said Dinmont, 'for it made nae sma' {{noise in}} the country-side. He died just at the roup of the {{stocking}} and furniture; it stoppit the roup, and mony folk were disappointed. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the last of an auld family too, and mony were sorry; for gude blude's scarcer in Scotland than it has been.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{love each}} other," [...] Terence repeated, searching into her face. Their faces were both very pale and quiet, and <b>they</b> <b>said</b> nothing. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> afraid {{to kiss her}} again. By degrees she drew close to him, and rested against him.

6000|$|... "They <b>said</b> <b>they</b> {{believed}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a {{man named}} Ephraim Fowler, who had murdered the skipper and mate of a coaster and then went off in the boat." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Not very. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{wandering}} {{in his head}} yesterday, dear boy, and so they said the day before.

The shadows of night were gathering, and all was still.|$|E
6000|$|... "Fergus McMahan was {{a friend}} of mine in the capital. For a {{handsome}} man I'll admit he was the duty-free merchandise. He had blond curls and laughing blue eyes and was featured regular. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a ringer for the statue they call Herr Mees, the god of speech and eloquence resting in some museum at Rome. Some German anarchist, I suppose. They are always resting and talking.|$|E
6000|$|... "Injins! Why not go {{at once to}} the wigwam of Susquesus, {{and get out of}} him and Yop {{the history}} of the state of things. I heard them {{speaking}} of the Onondago at our tavern last night, and while <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> generally thought to be much more than a hundred, that he was still like a man of eighty. That Indian is full of observation, and may let us into some of the secrets of his brethren." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Being {{much of his}} father's turn, {{busy and}} meddling in other people's concerns, got the ill will of most persons in the town and university. …The gownsmen bore him a {{particular}} grudge for interfering much in their affairs. … They often broke the doctor's windows, as <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> had <b>been</b> caught listening on their staircases and doors. … Dr. Ewin, as did his father, squinted very much, hence his nickname of [...] "Dr. Squintum" ...|$|R
5000|$|Orakzai {{was outside}} of a press club of the Hangu Union of Journalists around 6:30 a.m. waiting for a {{delivery}} of newspapers.

50|$|In July 2013 it was {{announced}} that Sampingiraj had signed with new direct-entry I-League side Bengaluru FC.

6000|$|... "That may be {{the word}} I was looking for," [...] he admitted. [...] "Can't say as I should have thought of it myself. Anyway, the bloke never stopped for close on five minutes, and old Joe--him on the ladder there--he {{came all the way}} down and listened with his mouth open, and he don't want no laming neither when there's things to be said.

6000|$|... "What boy! Lie me no lies, sir priest, play me no deceptions!--I {{am not in}} the humour for it. Near to {{this place}} I caught the scoundrels who I judged did steal him from me, and I made them confess; <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> at large again, and they had tracked him to your door. They showed me his very footprints. Now palter no more; for look you, holy sir, an' thou produce him not--Where is the boy?" ...|$|E
60|$|We heard {{different}} rumours {{about him}} {{from time to}} time. Sometimes <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> given up to smoking opium and collecting old books; sometimes he {{was reported to be}} trying strange things in chemistry; sometimes he was seen carousing and amusing himself among the lowest people in the lowest slums of London. Anyhow, a solitary, vicious, underground life was the life the Colonel led. Once, and once only, after his return to England, I myself saw him, face to face.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why don't {{you go in}} {{business}} for yourself? It {{seems to me it}} would just suit me," [...] said Matt enthusiastically.

6000|$|... "Some of {{them seem}} to have caught on to that fact; and they pitied Jack or Jim partly because the chances were so much against him. But they pitied him mostly because in the life before him he would have no use for his {{academic}} training, and he had better not gone to college at all. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> would <b>be</b> none the better for it, and would always <b>be</b> miserable when <b>he</b> looked back to it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{is a great}} {{military}} man," [...] <b>they</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "But <b>he</b> <b>was</b> likewise a fine Police Commissioner and a Civil Service Commissioner, fighting continually {{for what}} was right and good. Let us make him our next governor." ...|$|R
