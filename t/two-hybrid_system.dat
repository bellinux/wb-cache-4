40|$|International audienceTwo-hybrid {{systems are}} {{powerful}} tools {{to find new}} partners for a protein of interest. However, exchange of material between two-hybrid users has been handicapped by the various versions of <b>two-hybrid</b> <b>systems</b> available and by the widely accepted idea {{that they are not}} compatible. In the present paper we show that, contrary to the dogma, the most often used <b>two-hybrid</b> <b>systems</b> may be combined by either transformation or mating assays. The protocol to be followed in each case is provided. This will greatly increase the prospects of the growing network of interacting proteins, by reconciling the "two-hybrid systems" and the "interaction trap"...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{only known}} redox {{system in the}} apicoplast, a plastid-like {{organelle}} of apicomplexan parasites, is ferredoxin and ferredoxin-associated reductase. Ferredoxin donates electrons to different enzymes, presumably including lipoate synthase (LipA), which is essential for fatty acid biosynthesis. We recombinantly expressed and characterized LipA from the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii, generated LipA-specific antibodies and confirmed the apicoplast localization of LipA. Electron transfer from ferredoxin to LipA would require direct protein–protein interaction. Such a robust interaction between the two proteins was demonstrated in both yeast and bacterial <b>two-hybrid</b> <b>systems.</b> Taken together, our results provide strong evidence for a role of ferredoxin as an electron donor to LipA...|$|R

Tetracycline or its derivatives can then be used to regulate the sensitivity of a system utilising Tet-R.|$|E

40|$|Two {{types of}} <b>two-hybrid</b> <b>systems</b> {{demonstrate}} that the transcriptional repressor, nucleoid-associated protein H-NS (histone-like, nucleoid structuring protein) forms dimers and tetramers in vivo, the latter being the active form of the protein. The H-NS ‘protein oligomerization' domain (N-domain) is unable to oligomerize {{in the absence of}} the intradomain linker while the ‘DNA-binding' C-domain clearly displays a protein–protein interaction capacity, which contributes to H-NS tetramerization and which is lost following Pro 115 mutation. Linker deletion or substitution with KorB linker abolishes H-NS oligomerization. A model describing H-NS dimerization and tetramerization based on all available data and suggesting the existence in the tetramer of a bundle of four α-helices, each contributed by an H-NS monomer, is presented...|$|R

N forms a range of multimers from dimers to high-molecular-weight structures, independently of the presence of RNA. Deletion of the N- or C-terminal domains resulted in loss of activity in a minireplicon assay and a decreased capacity for N to form higher multimers.

50|$|Protein-protein {{interaction}} {{prediction is}} a field combining bioinformatics and structural biology {{in an attempt to}} identify and catalog physical interactions between pairs or groups of proteins. Understanding protein-protein interactions is important for the investigation of intracellular signaling pathways, modelling of protein complex structures and for gaining insights into various biochemical processes. Experimentally, physical interactions between pairs of proteins can be inferred from a variety of experimental techniques, including yeast <b>two-hybrid</b> <b>systems,</b> protein-fragment complementation assays (PCA), affinity purification/mass spectrometry, protein microarrays, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), and Microscale Thermophoresis (MST).

25|$|Glutamate {{receptor}} interacting protein (GRIP) is a post-synaptic protein {{with that}} interacts with AMPA receptors {{in a fashion}} analogous to PSD-95 interactions with NMDA receptors. When researchers noticed apparent structural homology between the C-termini of AMPA receptors and NMDA receptors, they attempted {{to determine if a}} similar PDZ interaction was occurring. A yeast <b>two-hybrid</b> <b>system</b> helped them discover that out of GRIP’s seven PDZ domains, two (domains four and five) were essential for binding of GRIP to the AMPA subunit called GluR2. This interaction is vital for proper localization of AMPA receptors, which play a large part in memory storage. Other researchers discovered that domains six and seven of GRIP are responsible for connecting GRIP to a family of receptor tyrosine kinases called ephrin receptors, which are important signaling proteins. A clinical study concluded that Fraser syndrome, an autosomal recessive syndrome that can cause severe deformations, can be caused by a simple mutation in GRIP.|$|E

40|$|SummaryDeveloping small-molecule antagonists against protein-protein {{interactions}} {{will provide}} powerful tools for mechanistic/functional {{studies and the}} discovery of new antibacterials. We have developed a reverse yeast three-hybrid approach that allows high-throughput screening for antagonist peptides against essential protein-protein interactions. We have applied our methodology to the essential bacterial helicase-primase interaction in Bacillus stearothermophilus and isolated a unique antagonist peptide. This peptide binds to the primase, thus excluding the helicase and inhibiting an essential interaction in bacterial DNA replication. We provide proof of principle that our reverse yeast three-hybrid method is a powerful “one-step” screen tool for direct high-throughput antagonist peptide selection against any protein-protein interaction detectable by traditional yeast <b>two-hybrid</b> <b>systems.</b> Such peptides will provide useful “leads” {{for the development of}} new antibacterials...|$|R

40|$|Peroxisome proliferator-activated {{receptor}} alpha (PPARa) is {{a member}} of the nuclear receptor superfamily whose ligands, the peroxisome proliferators (PPs), are liver tumor promoters in rodents. Interaction cloning was performed using bacterially expressed PPARa to identify proteins involved in PP signaling. The ribosomal protein L 11 (rpL 11), a component of the large 60 S subunit, was identified as a PPARa-associated protein. Since rpL 11 is a regulator of p 53 and the cell cycle, the association be-tween this protein and PPARa was examined in detail. PPARa-rpL 11 interaction was confirmed using yeast and mammalian <b>two-hybrid</b> <b>systems</b> as well as in vitro pull-down assays. The association with rpL 11 occurs within the D-domain (hinge-region) of PPARa. Unlike PPARa, the two closely related isoforms PPARb and g do not interact with rpL 11. Cotransfection of mam-malian cells with rpL 11 resulted in ligand-dependent inhibitio...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Protein-protein {{interactions}} {{are critical to}} many biological processes, extending from the formation of cellular macromolecular struc-tures and enzymatic complexes to the regulation of signal transduction pathways. With the availability of complete genome sequences, several groups have begun large-scale identication and characterization of such interactions, relying mostly on high-throughput <b>two-hybrid</b> <b>systems.</b> We collaborate with one such group, led by Marc Vidal, whose aim is {{the construction of a}} protein-protein interaction map for C. elegans. In this paper we rst describe WISTdb, a database designed to store the inter-action data generated in Marc Vidal’s laboratory. We then describe In-terDB, a multi-organism prediction-oriented database of protein-protein interactions. We nally discuss our current approaches, based on induc-tive logic programming and on a data mining technique, for extracting predictive rules from the collected data. 1 The Biological Problem: Protein-Protein Interaction...|$|R
40|$|In {{all living}} organisms, DNA repair {{proteins}} {{are essential for}} maintaining the accuracy of genetic material. In Escherichia coli, methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) corrects most types of misinsertion errors that arise during DNA replication. In contrast, very short patch (VSP) repair, corrects T/G mismatches caused by the deamination of 5 -methylcytosine to thymine in C(T/G) WGG (W = A or T) sequences. Initial experimental data had revealed that the over production of the Vsr endonuclease resulted in a spectrum of transition and frameshift mutations similar to that produced by MMR deficient strains. This spectrum of mutations was also observed for two mutant Vsr proteins known to be defective in VSP repair. These results strongly suggested that the inhibition in MMR repair was due to an interaction between Vsr and {{one or more of}} the MMR proteins. The finding of an interaction between Vsr and MutL using both the yeast and bacterial <b>two-hybrid</b> <b>systems</b> further strengthened this hypothesis. Utilization of the <b>two-hybrid</b> <b>systems</b> further revealed that Vsr mutants, with the amino-terminal truncated, still showed an interaction. Conversely even the smallest deletion of the Vsr carboxyl terminal resulted in loss of interaction. A new purification protocol for Vsr yielded a more stable protein that did not precipitate, nor lose its amino terminus and preserved its activity even after long-term storage at - 80 °C. In vitro endonuclease assays revealed that the activity is equivalent to established values. Single turnover, time course experiments confirmed that MutL does not have a stimulatory effect on Vsr under these conditions. In contrast, under conditions where Vsr is not limiting, MutL does have a stimulatory effect. In addition, Vsr was found to be stimulated to the same extent by MutL mutants deficient in nucleotide binding and/or hydrolysis as it is by wild type MutL. Vsr stimulation in the presence of MutL was unaffected by the presence or absence of ATP or ADP. These results lead us to conclude that the interaction between Vsr and MutL is not nucleotide dependent...|$|R

40|$|Since their introduction, the {{interaction}} trap and other <b>two-hybrid</b> <b>systems</b> {{have been used}} to study protein-protein interactions. Despite their general use, {{little is known about the}} extent to which the degree of protein interaction determined by two-hybrid approaches parallels the degree of interaction determined by biochemical techniques. In this study, we used a set of lexAop-LEU 2 and lexAop-lacZ reporters to calibrate {{the interaction}} trap. For the calibration, we used two sets of proteins, the Myc-Max-Mxi 1 helix-loop-helix proteins, and wild-type and dimerization-defective versions of the lambda cI repressor. Our results indicate that the strength of interaction as predicted by the two-hybrid approach generally correlates with that determined in vitro, permitting discrimination of high-, intermediate-, and low-affinity interactions, but there was no single reporter for which the amount of gene expression linearly reflected affinity measured in vitro. However, some reporters showed thresholds and only responded to stronger interactions. Finally, some interactions were subject to directionality, and their apparent strength depended on the reporter used. Taken together, our results provide a cautionary framework for interpreting affinities from <b>two-hybrid</b> experiments. Biological <b>systems</b> depend on interactions between protein components.

Here, we present two techniques, advanced yeast <b>two-hybrid</b> <b>systems</b> and incorporation of in vivo photo-cross-linking unnatural amino acids, to study membrane protein-protein interactions in vivo.

40|$|Francisella tularensis is {{a highly}} virulent {{intracellular}} pathogen with the capacity to infect a variety of hosts including humans. One {{of the most important}} proteins involved in F. tularensis virulence and pathogenesis is the protein DsbA. This protein is annotated as a lipoprotein with disulfide oxidoreductase/isomerase activity. Therefore, its interactions with different substrates, including probable virulence factors, to assist in their proper folding are anticipated. We aimed to use the immunopurification approach to find DsbA (gene locus FTS_ 1067) interacting partners in F. tularensis subsp. holarctica strain FSC 200 and compare the identified substrates with proteins which were found in our previous comparative proteome analysis.

The protein relationships detected by these cells are analogous to classical genetic relationships, but lend themselves to systematic application to the products of entire genomes and combinatorial libraries. We show that, by performing logical operations on the phenotypic outputs of these complex cells and existing two-hybrid cells, we can make inferences about the topology and order of protein interactions. Finally, we show that cells that register such relationships can perform logical operations on protein inputs.

Protein interaction mapping is performed mainly by co-purification strategies or <b>two-hybrid</b> <b>systems.</b> Recently, we expanded the tools for analyzing protein-protein interactions in bacteria with a two-hybrid technique based on beta-galactosidase complementation, and demonstrated its potential to explore interactions of membrane systems and to study transient interactions between redox partners (Borloo et al. 2007 a). We demonstrate here the functionality of this assay to reveal the interactions within the complex electron transfer chain of the dissimilatory metal reducing bacterium Shewanella oneidensis MR- 1. Specifically, we identified the cytoplasmic membrane-bound CymA as a key component, after which the electron transport chain is found to bifurcate towards several periplasmic proteins. It again congregates at the crucial MtrA, which in turn forms an electron transfer complex with the outer membrane localized MtrB and the terminal ferric reductases MtrC and OmcA.
