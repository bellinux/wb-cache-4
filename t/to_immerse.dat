5|$|Myst was a {{surprise}} hit, with critics lauding {{the ability of the}} game <b>to</b> <b>immerse</b> players in the fictional world. The game was the best-selling PC game until The Sims exceeded its sales in 2002. Myst helped drive adoption of the then-nascent CD-ROM format. Mysts success spawned four direct video game sequels as well as several spin-off games and novels.|$|E

5|$|Critical {{reception}} {{towards the}} game was generally positive. Reviews praised the game's formula, including its open-ended nature and its ability <b>to</b> <b>immerse</b> the player into the game. Criticism targeted the game's lack of documentation, which some reviewers found made it harder {{to learn how to}} play the game. The in-game speed was also criticized for being too slow, which was a crucial issue in the game because time must pass for the player to earn income to purchase new facilities.|$|E

5|$|Chronologically, it is {{difficult}} to establish guidelines that illustrate the evolution of Gaudí's style faithfully. Although he moved on from his initially historicist approach <b>to</b> <b>immerse</b> himself completely in the modernista movement which arose so vigorously in the last third of the 19th century in Catalonia, before finally attaining his personal, organic style, this process did not consist of clearly defined stages with obvious boundaries: rather, at every stage there are reflections of all the earlier ones, as he gradually assimilated and surpassed them. Among the best descriptions of Gaudí's work was made by his disciple and biographer Joan Bergós, according to plastic and structural criteria. Bergós establishes five periods in Gaudí's productions: preliminary period, mudéjar-morisco (Moorish/mudéjar art), emulated Gothic, naturalist and expressionist, and organic synthesis.|$|E

5|$|Van Gogh's stylistic {{developments}} are usually {{linked to the}} periods he spent living in different places across Europe. He was inclined <b>to</b> <b>immerse</b> himself in local cultures and lighting conditions, although he maintained a highly individual visual outlook throughout. His evolution as an artist was slow, and {{he was aware of}} his painterly limitations. He moved home often, perhaps to expose himself to new visual stimuli, and through exposure develop his technical skill. Art historian Melissa McQuillan believes the moves also reflect later stylistic changes, and that Van Gogh used the moves to avoid conflict, and as a coping mechanism for when the idealistic artist was faced with the realities of his then current situation.|$|E

Lionesses with cubs of their own are more likely to be tolerant of another lioness's cubs than lionesses without cubs. The tolerance of the male lions toward the cubs varies – sometimes, a male will patiently let the cubs play with his tail or his mane, whereas another may snarl and bat the cubs away.|$|E
5|$|The game's water effects {{received}} substantial upgrades {{because of}} the large role naval battles play in The Battle for Middle-earth II. The developers endeavored to make the surface of oceans and lakes look realistic by using techniques similar to those applied in films when creating computer-generated ocean water. The digital water simulates deep ocean water by reflecting its surroundings on the surface, and wave technology was used to create large waves along coastlines <b>to</b> <b>immerse</b> the player in the game experience. Lost towns, corals, and fish were added underwater to add to the effect. Water was chosen as the first graphical component of The Battle for Middle-earth II to take advantage of DirectX 9 programmable shaders. These additions were part of an overall Electronic Arts strategy to continue the Lord of the Rings experience that began with the trilogy film series.|$|E

5|$|Maxwell {{left the}} Academy in 1847 at age 16 and began {{attending}} {{classes at the}} University of Edinburgh. He {{had the opportunity to}} attend the University of Cambridge, but decided, after his first term, to complete the full course of his undergraduate studies at Edinburgh. The academic staff of Edinburgh University included some highly regarded names; his first year tutors included Sir William Hamilton, who lectured him on logic and metaphysics, Philip Kelland on mathematics, and James Forbes on natural philosophy. He did not find his classes at Edinburgh University very demanding, and was therefore able <b>to</b> <b>immerse</b> himself in private study during free time at the university and particularly when back home at Glenlair. There he would experiment with improvised chemical, electric, and magnetic apparatus, but his chief concerns regarded the properties of polarised light. He constructed shaped blocks of gelatine, subjected them to various stresses, and with a pair of polarising prisms given to him by William Nicol, viewed the coloured fringes that had developed within the jelly. Through this practice he discovered photoelasticity, which is a means of determining the stress distribution within physical structures.|$|E
5|$|Setting out {{to write}} {{something}} on an epic scale, Martin projected to write three books of 800 manuscript pages {{in the very early}} stages of the series. His original 1990s contract specified one-year deadlines for his previous literary works, but Martin only realized later that his new books were longer and hence required more writing time. In 2000, Martin planned to take 18 months to two years for each volume and projected the last of the planned six books to be released five or six years later. However, with the Ice and Fire series evolving into the biggest and most ambitious story he has ever attempted writing, he still has two more books to write as of 2016. Martin said he needed to be in his own office in Santa Fe, New Mexico <b>to</b> <b>immerse</b> himself in the fictional world and write. As of 2011, Martin was still typing his fiction on a DOS computer with WordStar 4.0 software. He begins each day at 10am with rewriting and polishing the previous day's work, and may write all day or struggle to write anything. Excised material and previous old versions are saved to be possibly re-inserted at a later time.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{examine how the}} music in the massive {{multiplayer}} online role playing game (MMORPG) World of Warcraft (Blizzard Entertainment 2004 - 2009) contributes <b>to</b> <b>immersing</b> the player in the game. In order to this I consider various aspects. I examine how the music relates to film music techniques of immersing its audience, narrating a story and depicting a world where races and landscapes are differentiated through music. In relation to this I use ethnomusicological theories of race and soundscapes. I also examine how music affects the player both emotionally and kinesthetically, and how this makes the player identify with the character on screen. By playing the game first hand I use the method of participant observation {{in order to examine}} how I as a player get affected by the music and how this contributes <b>to</b> <b>immersing</b> me in the game. Immersion has by some game scholars been seen as connected mainly with the actions of the player related to {{the rules of the game}} and thus how the player becomes immersed in the meaning of the game. Other scholars have seen that there are different types of immersion relating to games, such as that of how imagination is used by players to contribute to immersion. By examining how music affects the imagination of the player I aim to find out how music also contributes <b>to</b> both <b>immersing</b> the player and making the player want to return to the game. As the game is varied and uses different types of music for different types of situations, I also examine how affections and immersion varies depending on this...|$|R
