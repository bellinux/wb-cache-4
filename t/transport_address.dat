40|$|Abstract. The {{multihoming}} {{is regarded}} as a kind of technology to pro-vide wide-band and relaible network service. The protocol called Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) [1] can manage the multi-homed nodes to realize a highly-available data transfer capability in the Trans-port Layer. An SCTP node may keep a combination of the sets of the eligible source and destination transport addresses. The node can detect if a <b>transport</b> <b>address</b> is out of service by periodical messaging which is called HEARTBEAT in SCTP. If the HEARTBEAT is unacknowledged, the node will change to send data via another <b>transport</b> <b>address</b> which is with a HEARTBEAT ACK. The multi-homed mobility nodes, such as the cellphones implemented with both WiFi and 3 G, are widely used in the world. Mobility Support in IPv 6 (Mobile IPv 6, MIPv 6) [2] is a pro-tocol to provide a mobility function in IP layer. However the SCTP is not a protocol designed for the moving nodes, such as the nodes using the Mobile IP (MIP). Also there is an enhanced SCTP called mSCTP [3] which enables the mobility at the Transport Layer. But the mSCTP is not designed for the multihoming Mobile IP. In this paper, we suggest a new cross-layer routing method to use the SCTP with the multihoming MIPv 6. Our proposal is mobile node can use SCTP to select an optimized transport peer in real time...|$|E

However, the broader the application area, the more important become performance issues for a KBR service. In this paper, we present a novel approach to provide a generic KBR service. Its key idea {{is to use a}} predictable address assignment scheme. This scheme allows peers to calculate the overlay address of the node that is responsible for a given key and application ID. A public DHT service such as OpenDHT can then resolve this overlay address to the <b>transport</b> <b>address</b> of the respective peer. We compare our solution to alternative proposals such as ReDiR and Diminished Chord. We conclude that our solution has a better worst case complexity for some important KBR operations and the required state. In particular, unlike ReDiR, our solution can guarantee a low latency for KBR route operations. 1...|$|E

40|$|Supporting {{decentralized}} {{peer-to-peer communication}} between users {{is crucial for}} maintaining privacy and control over personal data. State-of-the-art protocols mostly rely on distributed hash tables (DHTs) in order to enable user-to-user communication. They are thus unable to provide <b>transport</b> <b>address</b> privacy and guaranteed low path stretch while ensuring sub-linear routing state together with tolerance of insider adversaries. In this paper we present U-Sphere, a novel location-independent routing protocol that is tolerant to Sybil adversaries and achieves low O (1) path stretch while maintaining View the MathML source per-node state. Departing from DHT designs, we use a landmark-based construction with node color groupings to aid flat name resolution while maintaining the stretch and state bounds. We completely remove the need for landmark-based location directories and build a name-record dissemination overlay that is able to better tolerate adversarial attacks under the assumption of social trust links established between nodes. We use large-scale emulation on both synthetic and actual network topologies {{to show that the}} protocol successfully achieves the scalability goals in addition to mitigating the impact of adversarial attacks...|$|E
40|$|Theories on the {{reciprocal}} relationship between land-use and <b>transport</b> <b>address</b> changes in locational decisions and travel behavior of private actors (households and firms) due to alternations in the transport system, respectively land-use system. Although {{the impact of}} land-use system on travel behaviour (transport system) {{has been the subject}} of much research (for reviews, see, e. g. Handy, 2002; Stead and Marshall, 2001; Crane, 2000; Wegener and F, 1999), there is still no consensus about the strength of this relationship. This may be caused by different types of variables whether or not included in the research. Initially only land-use variables were taken into account, but nowadays socio-economical variables are also incorporated. Still, within 'homogeneous groups', there may be attitudes, lifestyles, perceptions, and preferences which can have an impact on land-use and/or travel behaviour. Academic literature on the latter remains scarce and the main focus of the existing behavioural literature is the impact of residential location on travel choices, especially modal choice. However, little work has thus far been done on other dimensions of travel choices (e. g., distance, time) and other location types (e. g., commercial, industrial, recreational). Less is known about the reverse relationship, e. g. the impact of the transport system on location decisions of households and firms (land-use system). A difference in time-scale can be the reason for this. Transformations in land-use occur much slower (years) compared to transformations in travel behaviour (days, weeks, months). In this paper we explore several possibilities to fill in some of the gaps in our knowledge on the land-use/transport system. Understanding the two-way interaction between land-use and travel behaviour involves having (i) data on land-use patterns, socio-economic background of individuals and their attitudes, perceptions and preferences towards land-use and travel; and (ii) a methodology, dealing with potential multiple directions of causality. The first issue can be achieved by combining empirical, revealed and stated preference research. The second methodological question can be solved using structural equation modelling (SEM). This is a modelling technique which can handle a large number of endogenous and exogenous variables. Because of the multiple directions of causality that can be explored, SEM can help us to define the relationship between revealed preference data and stated preference data...|$|E

Our system of choice consists of quantum dots coupled to normal or superconducting leads. We present results for junctions with normal leads where the current, the density or a molecular vibration is optimized to follow a given target pattern. For junctions with two superconducting leads, where the Josephson effect triggers the current to oscillate, we show how to suppress the Josephson oscillations by suitably tailoring the bias. In a second example involving superconductivity, we consider a Y shaped junction with two quantum dots coupled to one superconducting and two normal leads. This device is used as a Cooper pair splitter to create entangled electrons on the two quantum dots. We maximize the splitting efficiency {{with the help of an}} optimized bias...|$|R
