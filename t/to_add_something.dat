5|$|Mansukhani {{conceived}} {{the film as}} a tale of three friends living together, drawing inspiration by his own experience. Wanting <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>something</b> different to the script, he later decided to introduce homosexuality (which he thought was unexplored by Bollywood) {{to shed light on}} the issue for the Indian audience. Manish Malhotra designed Chopra's costumes, and Aki Narula designed costumes {{for the rest of the}} cast. The soundtrack was composed by Vishal–Shekhar and Anvita Dutt Guptan; Kumaar and Vishal Dadlani wrote its lyrics.|$|E

In 1842 Charles Wheatstone approached Lovelace to translate a paper of Luigi Menabrea, who had taken notes of Babbage's Turin talks; and Babbage asked her <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>something</b> of her own. Fortunato Prandi who acted as interpreter in Turin was an Italian exile and follower of Giuseppe Mazzini.|$|E
500|$|The reason I {{added the}} piccolo trumpet and {{classical}} {{section in the}} middle of Let's All Chant' was mainly because I was embarrassed! I thought it was so stupid with that 'Ooh-ah' sound in it that I wanted <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>something</b> to lift the track musically. I have a classical background and went to a music conservatory, so I was really feeling embarrassed ...|$|E
5000|$|I'm {{looking forward}} <b>to</b> <b>adding</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> this already great band; I helped {{engineer}} their album 'Heroes Are Hard to Find' {{and got to}} know each member well. It came to me as a shock when Mick asked me to join but I am enjoying playing live with the band, and hopefully will start a new studio album with the band soon.|$|R

500|$|The final {{track of}} the DVD, [...] "Raining Blood", culminates with the band drenched by stage blood. Guitarist Jeff Hanneman {{came up with the}} idea of the blood two years after Reign in Bloods release, but the band lacked the funding to do so. The {{beginning}} of the film Blade (released in 1998) features a [...] "bloodbath" [...] with vampires dancing in a club with blood coming from the roof via a sprinkler system. The scene revived Jeff Hanneman and guitarist Kerry King's interest, and since the band released a DVD the previous year [...] War at the Warfield [...] they decided <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>something</b> different for the new DVD [...] raining blood. King asserted that since Lombardo was not on the previous DVD, this one was going to be important. Due to the short length of the DVD, director Dean Karr chose an additional bonus six songs from the same show as he thought certain members excelled in the performances.|$|E
500|$|Kelly was {{released}} from the military after two years, following which he worked on and off with Washington and Gillespie again. Kelly was also part of Charles Mingus' group for a tour of Washington, D.C., California, and Vancouver in late 1956 to early 1957. He left Mingus to rejoin Gillespie, who led a big band that toured Canada and the southern United States. Commenting on Kelly's ability to move from a small group to a big band setting, saxophonist Benny Golson, also from Gillespie's band, said that [...] "He kept his identity; yet he was able <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>something</b> to the band, not only melodically (which he was known for) but rhythmically. He would set up patterns – never interfering with the arrangement, but he was able to get into the cracks and he would always be adding something, giving it impetus, more energy." [...] In 1956, Kelly recorded with vocalist Billie Holiday, including for the original version of her song [...] "Lady Sings the Blues", {{as well as for the}} Blue Note debuts of saxophonists Johnny Griffin and Sonny Rollins. After leaving Gillespie again, Kelly formed his own trio.|$|E
500|$|Marlborough was ruthlessly ambitious, {{relentless}} in {{the pursuit}} of wealth, power and social advancement, earning him a reputation for avarice and miserliness. These traits may have been exaggerated for the purposes of party faction but, notes Trevelyan, nearly all other statesmen of the day were engaged in founding families and amassing estates at the public expense; Marlborough only differed in that he gave the public much more value for their money. In his quest for fame and personal interests he could be unscrupulous, as his desertion of JamesII testifies. To Macaulay this is regarded as a piece of selfish treachery against his patron; an analysis shared by the historian G. K. Chesterton: [...] "Churchill, as if <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>something</b> ideal to his imitation of Iscariot, went to James with wanton professions of love and loyalty... and then calmly handed over the army to the invader". To Trevelyan, Marlborough's behaviour during the 1688 revolution was a sign of his [...] "devotion to the liberties of England and the Protestant religion". However, his continuing correspondence with Saint-Germain was not noble. Although Marlborough did not wish for a Jacobite restoration his double-dealing ensured that WilliamIII and GeorgeI would never be fully disposed to trust him.|$|E

50|$|The particularity {{of great}} poets is <b>to</b> always <b>add</b> <b>something</b> new. By <b>adding</b> <b>something</b> new, they change their readers because by being {{completely}} baffled, the readers {{try to find}} the key to the mystery, the enigma, the big key that opens all the heavens for us. And they get there. All they need to do is love. To love is a word full of all the stars.|$|R
2500|$|He {{was again}} {{recalled}} to the squad in March 2011 for two Euro 2012 qualification games with Hungary, after injuries to strikers Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, Arjen Robben and Theo Janssen. In the away game on 25 March, he {{appeared as a}} late substitute for Dirk Kuyt while in the return game in Amsterdam four days later, he came off the bench to score his 35th international goal. adding it is [...] "wonderful to be able <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>something</b> to this Oranje team", as he told Berend Scholten.|$|E
2500|$|In The Naked Sun, Elijah Baley {{points out}} that the Laws had been {{deliberately}} misrepresented because robots could unknowingly break any of them. He restated the first law as [...] "A robot may do nothing that, to its knowledge, will harm a human being; nor, through inaction, knowingly allow a human being to come to harm." [...] This change in wording makes it clear that robots can become the tools of murder, provided they not be aware of the nature of their tasks; for instance being ordered <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>something</b> to a person's food, not knowing that it is poison. Furthermore, he {{points out that}} a clever criminal could divide a task among multiple robots so that no individual robot could recognize that its actions would lead to harming a human being. The Naked Sun complicates the issue by portraying a decentralized, planetwide communication network among Solaria's millions of robots meaning that the criminal mastermind could be located anywhere on the planet.|$|E

2500|$|On television, Lagasse {{is known}} for his light and jovial hosting style as well as several catchphrases, {{including}} [...] "Bam!". Emeril's signature catchphrase began simply as a means of keeping his studio crew awake, alert and focused. When Emeril first began at Food Network, he would tape seven shows a day, from seven in the morning until two in the afternoon. The interjection soon proved a hit with viewers. [...] "Kick it up a notch", [...] "Aw, yeah, babe" [...] and [...] "Feel the love", are usually said before or after <b>adding</b> <b>something</b> spicy <b>to</b> a dish, or after the reaction <b>to</b> <b>adding</b> <b>something.</b> When frying or making dishes like sausage, Lagasse advocated using genuine lard, boasting, [...] "Pork fat rules!" [...] This style developed fully, and Lagasse became more comfortable when a live studio audience was added in the change from Essence of Emeril to Emeril Live.|$|R

5000|$|Reception for {{the game}} has been polarized, with the Xbox version {{receiving}} the best reviews, the PS2 version mediocre, and the GameCube version receiving the worst. In 2009, GamesRadar included it among the games [...] "with untapped franchise potential", commenting: [...] "Though reviews were fairly mixed, Rogue Ops was surprisingly good, and even managed <b>to</b> <b>add</b> a little <b>something</b> <b>to</b> the Splinter Cell and Metal Gear dominated stealth genre." ...|$|R
6000|$|It might {{perhaps be}} thought proper <b>to</b> have <b>added</b> <b>something</b> {{by way of}} advice {{to those who are}} unhappily engaged in this abominable trade and sin of bearing false witness; but I am far from believing or supposing any of that {{destructive}} tribe are now my hearers. I look upon them as a sort of people that seldom frequent these holy places, where they can hardly pick up any materials to serve their turn, unless they think it worth their while to misrepresent or pervert the words of the preacher: And whoever is that way disposed, I doubt, cannot be in a very good condition to edify and reform himself by what he heareth. God in his mercy preserve us from all the guilt of this grievous sin forbidden in my text, and from the snares of those who are guilty of it! ...|$|R

[...] "As soon as she recovers from her terror she will not suffer"--then he added gravely, [...] "A minute blood vessel has ruptured in her brain, and a small clot has formed there. If this is absorbed, as I think it will be, she will recover. Nothing can be done for her. No medicine can reach her. It is {{just a question of}} rest and quiet."

60|$|Mr Whittlestaff, when he {{was left}} alone in the long walk, was {{disturbed}} by many troublesome thoughts. The knowledge that his housekeeper {{was out on the}} road, and that her drunken disreputable husband was playing the fool for the benefit of all the idlers that had sauntered out from Alresford <b>to</b> see him, <b>added</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> his grief. Why should not the stupid woman remain indoors, and allow him, her master, to send for the police? She had declared that she would go with her husband, and he could not violently prevent her. This was not much when <b>added</b> <b>to</b> the weight of his care as to Mary Lawrie, but it seemed to be the last ounce destined to break the horse's back, as is the proverbial fate of all last ounces.|$|R
60|$|DEAR FRIEND,--I fear <b>to</b> have <b>added</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> your {{troubles}} {{by telling}} {{you of the}} grief in which I find myself; but one cannot always come to meet a friend smiling, although we should try for the best cheer possible. All to-day I have been very weary, resting myself after the trouble and fatigue of yesterday. The day was warm enough, but it blew a whole gale of wind; and the noise and the purposeless rude violence of it somehow irritated and depressed me. There was good news however, though the anxiety must still be long. O peace, peace, whither are you fled and where have you carried my old quiet humour? I am so bitter and disquiet and speak even spitefully to people. And somehow, though I promise myself amendment, day after day finds me equally rough and sour to those about me. But this would pass with good health and good weather; and at bottom I am not unhappy; the soil is still good although it bears thorns; and the time will come again for flowers.|$|R
5000|$|Rowan Kaiser, {{writing for}} The A.V. Club gave a mostly {{positive}} review. While criticizing Jackie's {{role in the}} episode ("Jackie is still a problematic character, and suddenly having her {{be part of the}} crew, without any apologies, is a bit too far."), he lauded all other aspects of the episode, including the plot and character development of Weevil, Logan, and other. He also praised the technical aspects of the episode. [...] "I thought this episode had a lot of the technical verve which had been missing from the second season. … There were three scenes that seemed <b>to</b> <b>add</b> a little <b>something</b> extra with the directing and editing." [...] Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "B+".|$|R
6000|$|I {{thought he}} was going <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>something</b> more about that, but there lingered a habit of reticence in the man that held him for the moment.

60|$|He {{looked at}} me as if he meant <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>something</b> more, but turned {{instantly}} away, and left the room abruptly.

50|$|Over {{the next}} few years, the display {{continued}} to grow, as George <b>added</b> <b>something</b> new each year. In time, his children began to help out, from collecting tickets <b>to</b> <b>adding</b> their own ideas to the growing display. A gift shop was <b>added</b> <b>to</b> {{the front of the}} building, and a picnic grove was constructed {{to the west of the}} parking lot (free tickets to the grove were available to all Barn visitors).|$|R
500|$|Morris {{expressed}} a desire to make her idea a franchise. Although Olson and Dahlberg were first concerned about the idea's outlook for success, their worries disappeared after they dropped by her outlet a Saturday morning and found a line of 10 customers before Morris' store had even opened. Their strategy to captivate franchisees was <b>to</b> <b>add</b> urbanity <b>to</b> <b>something</b> they called a [...] "garage sale-looking environment" [...] but not harm the initial idea. Olson and Dahlberg quickly realized they preferred to be the owners of a company instead of be advisers. Morris sold her Play It Again Sports franchise rights to Olson and Dahlberg in 1988. She sold her stores to them in 1990. Play It Again Sports became Winmark's first division.|$|R
5000|$|Sodium is also {{something}} to watch out for. Consuming too much actually reverses the effects of eliminating all these [...] "bad foods." [...] Try using less salt when cooking, don't <b>add</b> soy sauce <b>to</b> your rice, put the bag of chips down.
