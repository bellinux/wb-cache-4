50|$|Almarian William Decker (born 1852, Ohio; d. Aug. 1893, Sierra Madre, California; interred Sierra Madre Pioneer Cemetery) was an American {{pioneer of}} {{electrical}} engineering {{involved in the}} early development of three-phase electrical power. In 1892 {{he was hired by}} H. H. Sinclair and Henry Fisher of the Redlands Electric Light and Power Company, a Californian generating company, to design a new <b>three-phase</b> <b>generator</b> for the Mill Creek No. 1 hydroelectric plant. The plant opened in 1893 and is still in operation today (2004). This was the first commercial application of three-phase electrical power in the United States and probably the world. Its success led to the widespread adoption of three-phase power, in preference to single-phase and direct current.|$|E
50|$|The {{propulsion}} system was supplied by Strömberg. A main inverter transforms the direct current supplied from the wires to alternating current for the drive motor. The motor speed is adjusted {{by changing the}} alternative currant frequency and voltage. The main inverter is also equipped with a possibility for transferring the braking energy back to the grid. The drive motor is asynchronous type and the maximum revolution speed is 4300 1/min. The alternative power source {{is located in the}} rear end of the vehicle and it consists of a 50-kW Deutz diesel engine and a 40-kW <b>three-phase</b> <b>generator.</b> The trolley poles are lowered and lifted automatically. The vehicle is also equipped with a 380-volt auxiliary inverter that supplies power for the air compressor, steering servo, ventilating fans and other systems.|$|E

The building featured its own [...] "isolated electric plant" [...] at a cost of $15,000, including a Fairbanks-Morse 75 horsepower semi-diesel oil motor driven 50 kilowatt, <b>three-phase</b> <b>generator</b> for electricity as well as two twenty-five horsepower oil engines that generated 40 kilowatts for 220-volt lighting. During the construction, plasterers set Macalite hollow tiles, causing bricklayers to walk off of the job. The day after the walkout, the contractor, the Alfred Struck Company of Louisville conceded the point and the bricklayers returned to the job site.|$|E

50|$|The main {{usage of}} {{single-phase}} hydroelectricity generation {{today is to}} supply power for traction network for railways. Many electrical transmission networks for railways especially in Germany rely on single-phase generation and transmission which are still in use today. A notable power station is Walchensee Hydroelectric Power Station in Bavaria. The station takes water from elevated Lake Walchensee to drive eight turbines that drive the generators. Four of those are <b>three-phase</b> <b>generators</b> to supply the power grid.

Ferraris demonstrated a working model of his single-phase induction motor in 1885, and Tesla built his working two-phase induction motor in 1887 and demonstrated it at the American Institute of Electrical Engineers in 1888 (although Tesla claimed that he conceived the rotating magnetic field in 1882). In 1888, Ferraris published his research to the Royal Academy of Sciences in Turin, where he detailed the foundations of motor operation; Tesla, in the same year, was granted a United States patent for his own motor. Working from Ferraris's experiments, Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky introduced the first three-phase induction motor in 1890, a much more capable design that became the prototype used in Europe and the U.S. He also invented the first <b>three-phase</b> <b>generator</b> and transformer and combined them into the first complete AC three-phase system in 1891.

50|$|In {{the very}} early days of {{electricity}} generation, the generators at power stations had been single-phase AC or direct current. The direction of the power industry were changing in 1895 when more efficient polyphase generators were successfully implemented at Adams Hydroelectric Generating Plant {{which was the first}} large-scale polyphase power station. Newer power stations started to adopt the polyphase system. In the 1900s, many railways started the electrification of their lines. During that time, the single-phase AC system had been widely used for their traction power networks beside the direct current system. The early generators for those single-phase traction networks are single-phase generators. Even with newer three-phase motors which were introduced to some modern trains, the single-phases transmission for traction networks survive their time and are still in use in many railways today. However, many traction power stations have replaced their generators over time to use <b>three-phase</b> <b>generators</b> and convert into single-phase for transmission.|$|R
