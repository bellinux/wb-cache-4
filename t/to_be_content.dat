5|$|The {{construction}} of the main line was stated to have overrun estimated costs considerably, and at a shareholders' meeting in February 1841 it was stated that as a result, the Kilmarnock branch could not be started until authority for additional capital had been obtained, {{and of course the}} money actually raised.

5|$|In {{describing}} the narrator's analysis of his surroundings, Gray employed John Locke's {{philosophy of the}} sensations, which argued that the senses were the origin of ideas. Information described {{in the beginning of}} the poem is reused by the narrator as he contemplates life near the end. The description of death and obscurity adopts Locke's political philosophy as it emphasises the inevitability and finality of death. The end of the poem is connected to Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding in that the beginning of the poem deals with the senses and the ending describes how we are limited in our ability to understand the world. The poem takes the ideas and transforms them into a discussion of blissful ignorance by adopting Locke's resolution <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>content</b> with our limited understanding. Unlike Locke, the narrator of the poem knows that he is unable to fathom the universe, but still questions the matter.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a local {{businessman}} named Louis Edwards began accruing {{shares in}} Manchester United and was eventually made chairman on Hardman's death in 1965. His son, Martin Edwards, purchased {{a percentage of}} shares from Alan Gibson – son of former owner James Gibson – and became the majority shareholder and chairman when Louis Edwards died in 1980. During Martin Edwards' time as chairman, Manchester United {{was the subject of}} several takeover bids; the first came from media tycoon Robert Maxwell, who bid £10million in February 1984, but the sale fell through before any serious talks could take place. In 1989, property magnate Michael Knighton {{was on the verge of}} completing a £20million takeover, but his financial backers pulled out at the last minute and he had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>content</b> with merely a seat on the board.|$|E
5|$|The Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles {{was founded}} in 1977 by Rabbi Marvin Hier using large {{donations}} from philanthropists Samuel Belzberg and Joseph Tennenbaum. Hier's organisation paid Wiesenthal an honorarium {{for the right to}} use his name. The center helped with the campaign to remove the statute of limitations on Nazi crimes and continues the hunt for suspected Nazi war criminals, but today its primary activities include Holocaust remembrance, education, and fighting antisemitism. The center's Holocaust museum, the largest in the United States, opened in 1993. Moriah Films, the center's media division, has won two Academy Awards, including one for the documentary Genocide (1982). Wiesenthal was not always happy with the way the center was run. He thought the museum was not dignified enough and that he should have a larger say in the overall operations. He even wrote to the Board of Directors requesting Hier's removal, but in the end had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>content</b> with being a figurehead.|$|E

5|$|By 5 December, the Australians {{had managed}} to {{stockpile}} enough supplies in forward areas to enable the 2/24th Infantry Battalion, which had been engaged in moving the stores, {{to be released from}} this task and thrown back into the fighting. In order to bypass the Japanese position, elements from the 2/23rd along with one company from the 2/24th carried out flanking manoeuvres {{to the west of the}} track were undertaken before the Australians established themselves in defensive positions short of Peak Hill. On 6 December, the remaining three companies of the 2/24th came up and as the Australians continued to advance towards Peak Hill they found considerable Japanese positions which had been abandoned. As movement was seen in Wareo, which was visible in the distance, an artillery bombardment was called in by the Australians. In the afternoon, the Australians cut the branch track that turned towards Kwatingkoo before an attack was put in on Peak Hill. The Japanese defences held and the attack beaten off, the Australians attempted to outflank to the north but they were prevented from doing so by the thick jungle and as the sun set, they had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>content</b> to dig-in on the western approach to Peak Hill.|$|E

Sirotkin said the race was not easy for him because {{he did not have the}} start he intended. He said that he was happy with his second-place result but would not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>content</b> finishing in either second or third in every event. Marciello stated that he expected some safety cars to affect the race but was unhappy with how many there were as they had prevented him building a large enough gap to his rivals. He said that his third-place finish was good for his team and revealed that he was not surprised when Sirotkin passed him on the start/finish straight on the first race's final lap as he saw him close up to him under the safety car.|$|E
