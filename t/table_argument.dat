2500|$|In 525, Dionysius {{prepared}} {{a table of}} the future dates of Easter {{and a set of}} [...] "arguments" [...] explaining their calculation (computus). This followed a request by Pope John I, possibly influenced {{by the fact that the}} then current Victorian tables gave an Easter date for 526 (19 April) which was the 22nd day of the moon. In a previous embarrassment, the tables had given Saturday, 24 April as the date of the Greek Easter in 482. Note well that only the first nine arguments are by Dionysius – arguments 10 to 16 as well as the second paragraphs of 3 and 4 and the third paragraph of 9 are later interpolations. Arguments 11 and 12 imply that these were interpolated in the year 675, shortly before Bede. Dionysius also introduced his <b>tables</b> and <b>arguments</b> via a letter to a bishop Petronius (also written in 525) and added another explanatory letter (written in 526). These works in volume 67 of the 217-volume Patrologia Latina also include a letter from Bishop Proterius of Alexandria to Pope Leo (written before 457). Though not named by Dionysius, this collection was recently called his Liber de Paschate (Book on Easter) by Audette.|$|R

40|$|Mathematics {{departments}} rarely {{require students}} to study very much logic before working with proofs. Normally, the most they will offer is contained in {{a small portion of}} a “bridge ” course designed to help students move from more procedurally-based lower-division courses (e. g., calculus and differential equations) to more proof-based upper division courses (e. g., abstract algebra and real analysis). What accounts for this seeming neglect of an essential ingredient of deductive reasoning? 1 We will suggest a partial answer by comparing the contents of traditional logic courses with the kinds of reasoning used in proof validation, our name for the process by which proofs are read and checked. First, we will discuss the style in which mathematical proofs are traditionally written and its apparent utility for reducing validation errors. We will then examine the relationship between the need for logic in validating proofs and the contents of traditional logic courses. Some topics emphasized in logic courses {{do not seem to be}} called upon very often during proof validation, whereas other kinds of reasoning, not often emphasized in such courses, are frequently used. In addition, the rather automatic way in which logic, such as modus ponens, needs to be used during proof validation does not appear to be improved by traditional teaching, which often emphasizes truth <b>tables,</b> valid <b>arguments,</b> and decontextualized exercises. Finally, we will illustrate these ideas with a proof validation, in which we explicitly point out the uses of logic. We will...|$|R
40|$|Three of the {{potential}} models for the 2 x 2 contingency table are discussed: the hyper geometric Independence Trial, the double-binomial Comparative Trial, and the multinomial Double Dichotomy Trial. Then the critical re-gions of seven statistical tests are evaluated within each of these models. The uncorrected Pearson s Chi-Square test and Upton's correction {{are found to be}} overly liberal in all three models, particularly for the hyper geometric. A continuity correction, when properly applied, is shown to be an extremely good approximation to Fisher's Exact test, which employs the hypergeo-metric distribution to evaluate outcome probabilities—but is an extremely conservative approximation to the double binomial and multinomial mod-els. Haber's test is recommended for these two cases, but the amount of work required may be prohibitive for many investigators. Despite the long, extensive literature {{on the use of the}} chi-square test of independence in 2 x 2 contingency <b>tables,</b> the <b>argument</b> as to the appropri-ateness of a continuity correction continues (e. g., Yates, 1984). Regarding 2 x 2 tables, some statistical texts recommend against using Yates's (1934) correction because it tends to be overly conservative (e. g., Conover, 1980, p. 149; Sachs, 1984, p. 351), and others argue even more emphatically that "the correction should always be used " (e. g., Fleiss, 1981, p. 27).

40|$|One of {{the major}} issues of {{cryptography}} is the cryptanalysis of cipher algorithms. Cryptanalysis {{is the study of}} methods for obtaining the meaning of encrypted information, without access to the secret information that is normally required. Some mechanisms for breaking codes include differential cryptanalysis, advanced statistics and brute-force. Recent works also attempt to use algebraic tools to reduce the cryptanalysis of a block cipher algorithm to the resolution of a system of quadratic equations describing the ciphering structure. In our study, we will also use algebraic tools but in a new way: by using Boolean functions and their properties. A Boolean function is a function from F_ 2 ^n→ F_ 2 with n> 1, characterized by its truth <b>table.</b> The <b>arguments</b> of Boolean functions are binary words of length n. Any Boolean function can be represented, uniquely, by its algebraic normal form which is an equation which only contains additions modulo 2 - the XOR function - and multiplications modulo 2 - the AND function. Our aim is to describe the AES algorithm as a set of Boolean functions then calculate their algebraic normal forms by using the Möbius transforms. After, we use a specific representation for these equations to facilitate their analysis and particularly to try a combinatorial analysis. Through this approach we obtain a new kind of equations system. This equations system is more easily implementable and could open new ways to cryptanalysis.

[...] The {{events leading up to}} the event began when Emma and Michelle were sent to Big Brother's Bedsit in secret, where they were given access to live streaming from the house. Under the impression that they had been evicted, some of the remaining housemates spoke poorly of Emma and Michelle. Upon their return to the house five nights later, the housemates were provided with party food and alcohol. Later, some of the housemates engaged in a playful food fight, leaving the communal living area in a mess. When Jason insisted that they tidy up their mess, Marco refused, prompting an argument between the pair. Nadia and Emma intervened in defence of Marco, with Nadia flipping over a <b>table.</b> The <b>argument</b> continued to escalate, and Emma began throwing a food tray at Victor, who retaliated by throwing the same tray back at Emma, hitting her {{in the back of the}} head. Emma then threw a full tray of food at him and raced toward him, at which point she stated she would kill him. Some of the other housemates intervened and broke up the fight taking Emma into the bedroom. The arguments led to Shell becoming very emotional, and she hid in the bathroom where she was comforted by Vanessa. Nadia entered the bathroom with the intent of apologizing for upseting Shell, but ended up having an argument with Vanessa, resulting in Big Brother sending security into the house.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) {{finds its}} {{theoretical}} foundation {{in the economic}} theory of comparative advantage, from which it draws the set of basic trading principles that it overtly upholds, namely, nondiscrimination, reciprocity, and transparency. In accordance with these principles, GATT sells itself as an agreement that will ensure fair trade through the rationalization of trade barriers and prevention of trade wars between its members. This paper counters such claims, showing how developing countries could suffer from the stipulations of the treaty emerging from the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations. The purported economic improvements in developing countries under the treaty are highly suspect. GATT makes developing countries vulnerable to potential exploitation by the dominators of the world market. Additionally, profit-driven transnational corporations successfully lobbied for their interests—against those of developing countries—in the GATT negotiating <b>table.</b> The <b>argument</b> against the latest GATT treaty boils down to its effect on agricultural production in developing countries, particularly the Philippines. With a government that has never provided food subsidies or any similar forms of support to its farmers, the Philippines stands to lose from GATT’s imposition against such subsidies {{in the name of}} creating a level playing field. The country is in a rush to industrialize in order to become globally competitive, hence it is reducing the portion of its lands dedicated to agriculture. This could lead to the worsening of the country’s dismal state of food security. With this subjection of lands to the terms of market efficiency comes the decreasing possibility of genuine land reform. In light of the country’s ratification of the GATT treaty, the paper insists that after consulting with the affected sectors of society, the Philippine government must prioritize the establishment of national food self-reliance through accelerated implementation of agrarian reform and the endowment of financial support to small farmers...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIn {{the process of}} international socialization, states are induced to adopt the constitutive norms and rules of the international community. This thesis examines the process of norm transfer by International Organizations (IOs), specifically the EU and NATO. Generally, international norms are diffused through IO enlargement or, as an alternative, through the partnership between the organization and non-member states. The ultimate success of the socialization process depends on the strategies, mechanisms and tools that are used by each socializing agent. The effectiveness of IOs' norms diffusion in dealing with partners is greater when the organizations apply differentiated, multi-staged socialization strategies that imply various levels of conditionality and offer powerful incentives that encourage domestic transformation. This study evaluates {{the effectiveness of the}} socialization strategies of the EU and NATO towards their East European neighbors given the fact that a prospective membership is not on the <b>table.</b> The main <b>argument</b> of this thesis is that, despite all positive achievements and results to date, the ENP as a norm diffusion mechanism is less effective than the PfP, and it could be improved by more actively applying the PfP's experience.

This paper {{is set up}} to examine the {{understanding}} of technology in curriculum documents of four countries - Australia, the UK, the USA and Russia, {{and to provide a}} basis for possible ways of expanding knowledge about technology in technology education curriculum. On the theoretical level, the understanding of technology is controversial, partly because it is developed by different disciplines. In the paper two broad categories, taken from the philosophy of technology, will be used for the analysis of curriculum documents: engineering (applied science) - humanities approaches and technological - value-driven (social) determinism. The comparison is presented in the <b>table.</b> Then the <b>argument</b> will be developed that a more critical and more balanced view on technology is needed for developing an adequate concept of knowledge about technology in technology education. A more critical view could include: reasonable doubt in technological progress; technology can escape from the peoples' control; the integration of people and society into the technical world; the relationship between power and technological knowledge; uncertainty should be treated more seriously. A more balanced view has to reflect, on one hand, that development of technology depends on human values, {{and on the other hand}} that it has its own laws of development.

50|$|In {{cultural}} industries, {{the uncertainty}} {{about the quality of}} a product {{plays a key role in}} this. The consumer does not really know how good the product is, until he or she has consumed it (think of a movie), and the producer is confronted with the typical uncertainty in a cultural industry. The consumer looks for guidance in the price, reputation, or a famous name on the cover or poster. As the producer understands this using a famous director, actor or singer affects demand, he or she is prepared to pay a lot for a name considered a sign of quality (a star). Indeed, authors like Adler and Ginsburgh have given evidence that star status is determined by chance: in a musical contest, results were highly correlated with the order of performance. This randomness has been used to explain why the labor supply in the sector remains excessive: given the extreme gains of a star, and an irrational behaviour, or particular preferences, with respect to chance, unsuccessful artists keep trying, even when they are earning their money mostly in a different trade, such as waiting <b>tables.</b> A second <b>argument</b> is the possibility of intangible returns to artists' labour in terms of social status and lifestyle. For example, even a struggling DJ spends most of her time onstage on nightclubs and raves, which for some people is a desirable outcome.|$|R
30|$|The {{four groups}} are placed into the <b>table</b> {{following}} the <b>argument</b> that while immigrants and refugees both migrated {{to a new}} country, the immigrants did this voluntarily and usually with the intention to stay, while refugees arrived in the host country by forces outside their control. This creates a difference in voluntariness of contact with natives: ‘Those who are voluntarily involved in the acculturation process (e.g. immigrants) may experience less difficulty than those with little {{choice in the matter}} (e.g. refugees and native peoples), since their attitudes towards contact and change might be more positive’ (Berry et al., 1987, p. 494). Immigrants and sojourners, such as expatriates and international students, both arrive in the host country voluntarily, but sojourners arrive with the intention to stay for only a limited period. On the other hand ethnic groups are born in the country, creating a difference in the mobility dimension. Ethnic groups and native people are both groups born in the ‘recipient’ country, and thus similar in the mobility dimension, but indigenous people differ from ethnic minorities in that the host country was involuntarily imposed upon them, for instance via colonisation, making a difference in the voluntariness of contact. The result of this, Berry et al. (1987) theorise, is that the acculturation process will be the easiest for ethnic groups and most difficult for refugees, with immigrants, sojourners and native peoples falling somewhere in-between. The impact of the mobility dimension, that is, whether the group migrated or not, should therefore be biggest when comparing migrants and native peoples.|$|R
40|$|Landau damping/growing at {{boundary}} condition of excitation of a harmonic wave in collisionless ion-electron-neutrals plasma contradicts {{to the law}} of energy conservation of a wave damping/growing in space. There is also no criterion of a choice either damping or growing solution in difference from always non-damping in the direction of propagation Vlasov waves. Variety of other incongruities as consequence of Landau damping is specified also. Absence of explicit positivity and finiteness of wave solutions for electron distribution function near singularity point leads to need of imposing additional cutting off constraints with resulting positivity and finiteness of the electron distribution function at the singularity points and finiteness of the complex dispersion integral. Landau damping as a real physical phenomenon of collisionless damping does not exist. A relation is established for the real dispersion equation with real waves (see Appendices 2, 4) between the averaged over period wave damping decrement and the collisional energy-exchange term of kinetic equation. Collisionless Vlasov-Landau damping is explained finally by the usual wrong use of nonlinearly complex wave functions leading to complex dispersion equation. All used solution of the complex dispersion equation for the simultaneously existing collisionless both exponentially damping and growing nonlinear complex waves is entirely, quantitatively and in its logical sense, different from the solution of initially real dispersion equation for real either damping or growing waves and should be discarded (see Appendices 2, 4, 5, 6). Collisionless damping is caused by unreasonable use of wave functions with complex frequency or complex wave number leading to complex dispersion relation with unphysical binomial virtual complex roots. Thus finding roots of the complex dispersion equation has only abstract mathematical interest. Comment: 36 pages, no figures, no <b>tables</b> (PDF).

40|$|Starting {{from the}} {{conventional}} theoretical formulation for modal choice and achieving the optimal balance of care, Part 1 first describes the elaborations made within that framework and presents estimates. It then discusses {{evidence about the}} costs of outcomes of importance {{in their own right}} in the evaluation of system performance. Part 2 discusses the feasibility of shifting the balance to community based care with a budget increasing little faster than the population at risk. Part 1 commences with a summary of the traditional theoretical framework for choosing care modes and achieving the optimal balance of care (Diagram 1. 1). The framework focuses on the relationships between costs and dependency. Section 1. 1 describes the elaborations of that framework and presents estimates. (i) "Dependency", a vaguely defined concept, was replaced by "functional incapacity". Estimates for British residential homes suggest that the relationships betwen costs and disability do not depart substantially from the monotonicity assumed by the original theoretical <b>argument</b> (<b>Table</b> 1. 1). However the relationships are not monotonic for recipients of community based social care having substantial informal support (Table 1. 2). (ii) Costs have been studied in greater detail: the range has widened; costs accounts compiled for interest groups; economists' opportunity cost principles applied; and more attention paid to the constituents of costs. Table 1. 3 illustrates how the opportunity costs of residential care provided by local authorities differ with the scale and targeting criteria chosen between each of twelve authorities. Section 1. 2 discusses evidence about the costs of outcomes of ultimate evaluative significance. This question has been raised by technical advances in research methods and changes in service demand and supply. Again the theoretical argument is focussed on what patterns might be expected in an equitable and efficient system (Diagram 1. 2). The comparison of actual and these ideal patterns help to pinpoint faults in the present system. Table 1. 4 compares the costs of morale and quality of care outcomes in the Thanet community care project and its comparison group. It suggests that an optimising allocation process would indeed result in patterns like those in Diagram 1. 2), but that standard services do not yield these patterns. Part 2 discusses the feasibility of meeting the increase in need adequately and equitably by the provision of more community©based rather than residential based care, assuming that the expenditure of public funds will rise no more quickly than the number of persons in the age groups most at risk.
