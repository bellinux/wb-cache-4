5|$|Jain texts make a clear {{distinction}} between the Sallekhana and suicide. Its dualistic theology differentiates between soul and matter. Soul is reborn in the Jain belief based on accumulated karma, how one dies contributes to the karma accumulation, and a pious death reduces the negative karmic attachments. The preparation for sallekhana must begin early, much before the approach of death, and when death is imminent, the vow of Sallekhana is observed by progressively slenderising the body and <b>the</b> <b>passions.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many {{classical}} {{philosophers and}} scientists, including Aristotle, considered the heart {{the seat of}} thought, reason, or emotion, often disregarding the brain as contributing to those functions.) |page=book 3, ch. 4. |nopp=y |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814220201/https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/parts/book3.html |archivedate=14 August 2016 |df=dmy-all }} The identification of the heart as the seat of emotions in particular {{is due to the}} Roman physician Galen, who also located the seat of <b>the</b> <b>passions</b> in the liver, and the seat of reason in the brain.|$|E
5|$|The Stoics {{sought to}} be free of the unruly emotions, which they {{regarded}} as being contrary to nature. <b>The</b> <b>passions</b> or emotions (pathe) are the disturbing element in right judgment. Chrysippus wrote a whole book concerning the therapy of the emotions. <b>The</b> <b>passions</b> are like diseases which depress and crush the soul, thus he sought to eradicate them (apatheia). Wrong judgements turn into passions when they gather an impetus of their own, just as, when one has started running, it is difficult to stop. One cannot hope to eradicate the emotions when one is in the heat of love or anger: this can only be done when one is calm. Therefore, one should prepare in advance, and deal with the emotions in the mind as if they were present. By applying reason to emotions such as greed, pride, or lust, one can understand the harm which they cause.|$|E
6000|$|I justify them in {{this view}} not only because I hate what is cheap and meretricious, and hold in {{peculiar}} loathing the cant of the critics who require [...] "passion" [...] as something in itself admirable and desirable in a novel, but because I prize fidelity in the historian of feeling and character. Most of these critics who demand [...] "passion" [...] {{would seem to have}} no conception of any passion but one. Yet there are several other passions: <b>the</b> <b>passion</b> of grief, <b>the</b> <b>passion</b> of avarice, <b>the</b> <b>passion</b> of pity, <b>the</b> <b>passion</b> of ambition, <b>the</b> <b>passion</b> of hate, <b>the</b> <b>passion</b> of envy, <b>the</b> <b>passion</b> of devotion, <b>the</b> <b>passion</b> of friendship; and all these have a greater part in the drama of life than <b>the</b> <b>passion</b> of love, and infinitely greater than <b>the</b> <b>passion</b> of guilty love. Wittingly or unwittingly, English fiction and American fiction have recognized this truth, not fully, not in the measure it merits, but in greater degree than most other fiction.|$|R

5|$|According to the 1993 book by Russian {{psychiatrist}} Mikhail Buyanov, {{the harm}} inflicted by Soviet punitive psychiatry {{on the image}} of domestic medicine is, of course, great, but bears no comparison to the crimes of the Nazi doctors. Now, when all <b>the</b> <b>passions</b> have cooled, one {{can say that the}} zeal of Soviet psychiatrists inflicted suffering on up to 100 or 120 people of all 280 million citizens of the former Soviet Union, Buyanov writes. He adds that among the persons were many fanatical nationalists, religious sectarians, and political paranoiacs who after escaping to freedom corrupted the masses, сrammed their heads with nonsense, carried away immature people with their ideas through the connivance of the so-called progressive intelligentsia, and a result of it is wars, blood, and reciprocal hatred.|$|E
5|$|In 444 BC, the {{conservative}} {{and the democratic}} factions confronted {{each other in a}} fierce struggle. The ambitious new leader of {{the conservative}}s, Thucydides (not {{to be confused with the}} historian of the same name), accused Pericles of profligacy, criticizing the way he spent the money for the ongoing building plan. Thucydides initially managed to incite <b>the</b> <b>passions</b> of the ecclesia regarding these charges in his favor. However, when Pericles took the floor, his resolute arguments put Thucydides and the conservatives firmly on the defensive. Finally, Pericles proposed to reimburse the city for all questionable expenses from his private property, with the proviso that he would make the inscriptions of dedication in his own name. His stance was greeted with applause, and Thucydides was soundly, if unexpectedly, defeated. In 442BC, the Athenian public voted to ostracize Thucydides from the city for 10 years and Pericles was once again the unchallenged ruler of the Athenian political arena.|$|E

5|$|In {{the case}} of Burford I {{was one of the}} members who {{constituted}} the court. I owe it to my own consistency to declare that the court were then apprized of my objections to the issuing of the writ of habeas corpus. I did not then comment at large on the reasons which influenced my opinion, and the cause was this: The gentleman who argued that cause confined himself strictly to those considerations which ought alone to influence the decisions of this court. No popular observations on the necessity of protecting the citizen from executive oppression, no animated address calculated to enlist <b>the</b> <b>passions</b> or prejudices of an audience in defence of his motion, imposed on me the necessity of vindicating my opinion. I submitted in silent deference to the decision of my brethren.|$|E
5|$|The general {{success of}} William L. Mayo and his college even {{inflamed}} <b>the</b> <b>passions</b> of their competitors, most especially T. Henry Bridges, {{the head of}} Henry College in nearby Campbell. According to William E. Sawyer, {{in the aftermath of}} Reconstruction the Southern-educated Bridges viewed the Northern-educated Mayo as a carpetbagger. After a battle of words between the two college presidents in local newspaper columns, on August 24, 1896, Bridges drove into Commerce in his buggy to confront Mayo, first asking him to sign a statement retracting his written claims. When Mayo refused, Bridges drew his revolver on Mayo, and after he missed his target twice, Bridges proceeded to strike Mayo with 15 to 20 lashes of his whip. The disturbance attracted an angry mob of ETNC students, who drove Bridges out of town. Bridges' Henry College would ultimately become defunct in 1901.|$|E

30|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{research}} was to translate the refined version of <b>the</b> <b>Passion</b> Scale (Marsh et al. 2013) in Chinese and test its validity and reliability. To do so, we first translated <b>the</b> <b>Passion</b> Scale in Chinese using back-translation procedures (Vallerand 1989). After a pilot study suggesting that <b>the</b> <b>Passion</b> Scale in Chinese was acceptable, university students completed an online questionnaire. This questionnaire contained <b>the</b> <b>Passion</b> Scale toward one’s studies, <b>the</b> <b>passion</b> criteria (for e.g. “my studies are passion for me”), as well as the level of flow and positive and negative emotions experienced when engaging in one’s studies.|$|R

25|$|Like most {{churches of}} the Anglican Communion, the ACC was beset by intense {{conflict}} over the ritualism controversies {{of the latter}} 19th century, leading in some extreme cases to schism. Throughout much of the 20th century, parishes – and, to a certain extent, dioceses or regions – {{were more or less}} divided between high church (Anglo-Catholic), low church (evangelical), and broad church (middle-of-the-road). Many of these designations have become muted with time, as <b>the</b> <b>passions</b> which fired the debate have cooled and most parishes have found a happy medium or accommodation.|$|E
25|$|Man, {{according}} to Schopenhauer, {{is driven by}} continued, unachievable desires, and the gulf between our desires {{and the possibility of}} achieving them leads to misery while the world is a representation of an unknowable reality.
