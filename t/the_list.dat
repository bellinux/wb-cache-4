40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} option listings on the common stock of 21 firms specializing in the casino and gaming industry. Our results show that, on average, {{there is a significant}} decrease in price during the five-day window which indudes the announcement of <b>the</b> <b>listing,</b> <b>the</b> <b>listing</b> day, and a two-day period following <b>the</b> <b>listing</b> during which a liquid market is created in the option. However, we also show that stock prices recover subsequent to <b>the</b> <b>listing</b> window and that {{there is no evidence of}} a permanent change in stock price resulting from <b>the</b> <b>listing.</b> We find a significant decline in trading volume beginning two days prior to <b>the</b> <b>listing,</b> suggesting that <b>the</b> option market displaces trades of a significant number of shares following <b>the</b> <b>listing.</b> Finally, we find a significant decline in firm-specific risk following <b>the</b> <b>listing,</b> but do not find a change in systematic risk. This result suggests that while the introduction of option trading does not change the relationship between these stocks 2 ̆ 7 returns and market returns, the additional outlet for speculators reduces volatility surrounding firm-specific news, lowering the total risk of these stocks...|$|R
