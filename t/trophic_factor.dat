Further, CNTF has been previously shown to affect the differentiation of glial precursor cells in vitro; however, the influence of CNTF in the in vivo setting has only recently been determined. Winter et al. used CNTF over-expressing transgenic mice as well as wildtype controls that had CNTF levels artificially elevated via injection, were subjected to neuronal damage using ZnSO4 (a known neuronal degenerative factor), which was injected intranasally in the olfactory epithelium. The olfactory bulb was then assessed for the expression of GFAP mRNA- a common marker for the glial scar. It was determined that mice with elevated levels of CNTF increased their GFAP mRNA expression two-fold. This data suggests that CNTF may mediate glial scar formation following CNS damage.|$|E

40|$|Approximately {{half of the}} motoneurons {{generated}} during normal embryonic development undergo programmed cell death. Most of {{this death}} occurs during the time when synaptic connections are being formed between motoneurons and their target, skeletal muscle. Subsequent muscle activity stemming from this connection helps determine the final number of surviving motoneurons. These observations {{have given rise to}} the idea that motoneuron survival is dependent upon access to muscle derived <b>trophic</b> <b>factors,</b> presumably through intact neuromuscular synapses. However, it is not yet understood how the muscle regulates the supply of such <b>trophic</b> <b>factors,</b> or if there are additional mechanisms operating to control the fate of the innervating motoneuron. Recent observations have highlighted target independent mechanisms that also operate to support the survival of motoneurons, such as early trophic-independent periods of motoneuron death, <b>trophic</b> <b>factors</b> derived from Schwann cells and selection of motoneurons during pathfinding. Here we review recent investigations into motoneuron cell death when the molecular signalling between motoneurons and muscle has been genetically disrupted. From these studies, we suggest that in addition to <b>trophic</b> <b>factors</b> from muscle and/or Schwann cells, specific adhesive interactions between motoneurons and muscle are needed to regulate motoneuron survival. Such interactions, along with intact synaptic basal lamina, may help to regulate the supply and presentation of <b>trophic</b> <b>factors</b> to motoneurons...|$|R
40|$|The {{involvement}} of neuronal protein synthetic machinery and extrinsic <b>trophic</b> <b>factors</b> during synapse formation is poorly understood. Here we determine {{the roles of}} these processes by reconstructing synapses between the axons severed from identified Lymnaea neurons in cell culture, either in {{the presence or absence}} of <b>trophic</b> <b>factors.</b> We demonstrate that, although synapses are maintained between isolated pre- and postsynaptic axons for several days, the presynaptic, but not the postsynaptic, cell body, however, is required for new synapse formation between soma-axon pairs. The formation of cholinergic synapses between presynaptic soma and postsynaptic axon requires gene transcription and protein synthesis solely in the presynaptic neuron. We show that this synaptogenesis is contingent on extrinsic <b>trophic</b> <b>factors</b> present in brain conditioned medium (CM). The CM-induced excitatory synapse formation is mediated through receptor tyrosine kinases. We further demonstrate that, although the postsynaptic axon does not require new protein synthesis for synapse formation, its contact with the presynaptic cell in CM, but not in defined medium (no <b>trophic</b> <b>factors),</b> differentially alters its responsiveness to exogenously applied acetylcholine at synaptic compared with extrasynaptic sites. Together, these data suggest a synergetic action of cell-cell signaling and <b>trophic</b> <b>factors</b> to bring about specific changes in both pre- and postsynaptic neurons during synapse formation...|$|R

As well, they are involved in axon guidance and synapse formation. Even in the adult spinal cord an uninterrupted trophic input is required to maintain neuronal functioning and protection from noxious stimuli. Among the <b>trophic</b> <b>factors</b> that have been demonstrated to participate in motor neuron physiology are vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF- 1).

However, how MSC therapy facilitates tissue regeneration remains incompletely characterized. Consistent with the emerging notion that secretion of multiple growth factors/cytokines (<b>trophic</b> <b>factors)</b> by MSC provides the underlying tissue regenerative mechanism, the recent study by Bai et al demonstrated a critical therapeutic role of MSC-derived hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in two animal models of multiple sclerosis (MS), which is a progressive autoimmune disorder caused by damage to the myelin sheath and loss of oligodendrocytes. Although current MS therapies are directed toward attenuation of the immune response, robust repair of myelin sheath likely requires a regenerative approach focusing on long-term replacement of the lost oligodendrocytes.

40|$|Diseases {{that cause}} {{photoreceptor}} degeneration such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and retinitis pigmentosa (RP) affect {{millions of people}} and lead to blindness. The degeneration of photoreceptor cells in AMD or cone photoreceptors in RP is caused by stress in their environment and/or lack of trophic support, not by direct genetic mutation targeting of the photoreceptor cells. Therefore, providing effective trophic support can delay or prevent photoreceptor degeneration. It {{has been known for}} more than 20 years that natural <b>trophic</b> <b>factors</b> exist in the retina that protect photoreceptor cells, but these factors have never been identified. Recent gene therapy studies have revealed that targeting genetic mutations is not sufficient and that there is an urgent need to identify <b>trophic</b> <b>factors</b> that can maintain photoreceptor survival in the treatment of photoreceptor degeneration. Identification and mechanistic study of <b>trophic</b> <b>factors</b> naturally present in the retina will lead {{to a better understanding of}} the photoreceptor protection mechanism and help to develop new therapeutic strategies. My thesis project aims to identify new natural <b>trophic</b> <b>factors</b> that protect photoreceptor cells and to test them using in vitro and in vivo models. We found that natural <b>trophic</b> <b>factors</b> in the retina strongly protect photoreceptor cells from retinal-mediated light damage or chemically induced oxidative damage. Using classic techniques combined with advanced mass spectrometry and genome-wide database searching, we identified several candidate photoreceptor protective factors. These factors effectively protect primary cone photoreceptor cells from light damage and oxidative damage in vitro. We cloned candidate genes into lentiviral vectors and delivered them to the retina and RPE (retinal pigment epithelium) in vivo by subretinal injection. Using two mouse models of retinal degeneration: a light-induced retina degeneration model and a genetic retina degeneration model, we found that one factor almost completely protect retina from light-induced damage in vivo. In summary, we have identified a novel factor that can prevent photoreceptor cell degeneration in vitro and in vivo. This factor has potential therapeutic values in treating retina degenerative diseases...|$|R
40|$|Primary sensory neurones in cranial and {{dorsal root}} ganglia (DRG) of adult animals are {{generally}} thought to be maintained through connections with their peripheral (but not central) targets by <b>trophic</b> <b>factor(s)</b> other than nerve growth factor (NGF). Damage to the peripheral process of sensory neurones results in a dramatic response or even death of the neurones, whereas axotomy (cutting) of the central process does not initiate profound reaction in these neurones. The development and maintenance of neurones are highly dependent on a supply of trophic agents produced by targets and retrogradely transported via the peripheral process to the cell body. NGF deprivation in fetal rodents produced either by exogenously administered antibodies or by those of maternal origin, results in death of DRG and of some cranial sensory neurones. However, as chronic NGF deprivation in neonatal or adult rodents produces little or no cell death, it has been assumed that some other <b>trophic</b> <b>factor(s)</b> derived from the peripheral target sustains sensory neurones in postnatal life. By inducing NGF deprivation by autoimmunizing guinea pigs with mouse NGF and/or by cutting the central root (process) of a DRG, we demonstrate here that under certain conditions DRG neurones require NGF and centrally derived trophic support. Our results indicate that sensory neurones are maintained by the trophic support provided by both peripheral and central targets. This support is mediated by NGF and other as yet unidentified <b>trophic</b> <b>factors.</b> The relative importance of the two target fields and NGF compared with other <b>trophic</b> <b>factors</b> changes during development. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
