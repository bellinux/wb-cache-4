5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Duck</b> End {{was one of}} {{the poorer}} districts of Aylesbury. Until the end of the 19thcentury it had no sewers or refuse collections. The area had a number of open ditches filled with {{stagnant}} water, and outbreaks of malaria and cholera were common. The cottages had inadequate ventilation and lighting, and no running water. Faeces from <b>the</b> <b>duck</b> ponds permeated the local soil and seeped into the cottages through cracks in the floors.|$|E
5|$|Until the mid-19thcentury {{duck rearing}} was {{concentrated}} on <b>the</b> <b>Duck</b> End, {{but by the}} 1860s it had spread to many other towns and villages in the area, particularly Weston Turville and Haddenham. Contamination of Aylesbury's soil by years of duck rearing, and new public health legislation which ended many traditional practices, caused the decline of <b>the</b> <b>duck</b> rearing industry in <b>the</b> <b>Duck</b> End, and by the 1890s the majority of Aylesbury ducks were raised in the villages rather than the town itself. Population shifts and the improved national rail network reduced the need to rear ducks near London, and large duck farms opened in Lancashire, Norfolk and Lincolnshire. Although the number of ducks raised nationwide continued to grow, between 1890 and 1900 the number of ducks raised in the Aylesbury area remained static, and from 1900 it began to drop.|$|E

5|$|Unlike most {{livestock}} farming in England at this time, <b>the</b> <b>duck</b> breeders and duck rearers of Aylesbury formed two separate groups. Stock ducks—i.e., ducks kept for breeding—were kept on {{farms in the}} countryside of the Aylesbury Vale, away from the polluted air and water of the town. This kept the ducks healthy, and meant a higher number of fertile eggs.|$|E
5|$|During the 17th century, many of {{the grand}} mansions on the Strand were {{demolished}} as the aristocracy moved to the West End. <b>The</b> <b>Duck</b> and Drake tavern on Strand was famed as a venue for the conspirators involved in the Gunpowder Plot.

Winston Churchill Hall on the site received a £370,000 grant from Hillingdon Council in March 2011 to enable its refurbishment.|$|E
5|$|Qwak! is a single-player duck hunting light gun shooter arcade game {{in which}} the player uses a rifle-shaped light gun to fire at targets on the screen. One duck at a time flies across the screen, with each duck {{appearing}} {{in a different place}} {{on the sides of the}} screen and flying in different paths. The player is allowed three shots to hit <b>the</b> <b>duck</b> as it flies across the screen. As with other light gun games, a hit is registered if the gun is pointed at <b>the</b> <b>duck</b> or similar light source when the trigger is pulled; no projectile is fired. When a shot is fired, a mark appears on the screen where the player was aiming; if the shot misses <b>the</b> <b>duck,</b> it changes direction away from the bullet. If the player hits a duck, it falls to the ground, and a hunting dog runs over and collects it. Each duck hit adds a small image of a duck to a row at the top of the screen. An screen overlay shows an image of marsh reeds and a tree branch. The gun is attached to the game cabinet by a metal cord, and is holstered in a small circular recess in the cabinet when not in use. Attempting to remove the gun sounds an alarm buzzer. Each game costs a quarter, and runs until the time limit runs out. Machines have adjustable time limits or can be set to run each game indefinitely, starting the score count over when the start button is pressed.|$|E
5|$|This species' {{preferred}} {{habitat of}} shallow water is naturally susceptible to {{problems such as}} drought or the encroachment of vegetation, but this duck's habitat might be increasingly threatened by climate change. Populations are also affected by the conversion of wetlands and grassland to arable crops, depriving <b>the</b> <b>duck</b> of feeding and nesting areas. Spring planting means that many nests of this early breeding duck are destroyed by farming activities, and a Canadian study showed {{that more than half}} of the surveyed nests were destroyed by agricultural work such as ploughing and harrowing.|$|E
50|$|Huntington {{took over}} as head coach for <b>the</b> <b>Ducks</b> in 1918. He would coach <b>the</b> <b>Ducks</b> for six seasons. He {{finished}} with a 26-12-6 record. In 1919, he coached <b>the</b> <b>Ducks</b> to a Rose Bowl berth; they lost to Harvard, 7-6, on January 1, 1920.|$|R
25|$|Another {{slow start}} would doom <b>the</b> <b>Ducks.</b> Before <b>the</b> trade deadline, <b>the</b> <b>Ducks</b> traded Giguere to the Toronto Maple Leafs for Jason Blake and Vesa Toskala after signing Hiller to a {{contract}} extension. The trade deadline saw <b>the</b> <b>Ducks</b> trade Ryan Whitney to Edmonton for offensive defenseman Lubomir Visnovsky, {{as well as the}} acquisitions of defenseman Aaron Ward from the Carolina Hurricanes and goalie Curtis McElhinney from the Calgary Flames. <b>The</b> <b>Ducks</b> played through frequent injuries and picked up play {{in the second half of}} the season, but struggled coming out of the Olympic break. For the first time since <b>the</b> lockout, <b>the</b> <b>Ducks</b> failed to make the playoffs with a 39–32–11 record. The 2010 off-season was also busy for <b>the</b> <b>Ducks,</b> as Scott Niedermayer announced his retirement in a June press conference. Niedermayer decided to stay a member of <b>the</b> <b>Ducks</b> as a team consultant. <b>The</b> <b>Ducks</b> resigned Saku Koivu for two years and signed free agent defenseman Toni Lydman to a three-year contract. In addition to Lydman, <b>the</b> <b>Ducks</b> were able to get defenseman Cam Fowler via the draft, and 35-year-old strong-willed defenseman Andy Sutton signed to a two-year deal. Restricted free agent Bobby Ryan was signed to a five-year deal.|$|R

5|$|A routine became {{established}} in which salesmen {{would provide the}} duckers with labels. The duckers would mark their ducklings with the labels of the firm to whom they wished them to be sold in London. The railway companies would collect ducklings, {{take them to the}} stations, ship them to London and deliver them to the designated firms, in return for a flat fee per bird. By avoiding the need for the duckers to travel to market, or the London salesmen to collect the ducklings, this arrangement benefited all concerned, and ducking became very profitable. By 1870 <b>the</b> <b>duck</b> industry was bringing over £20,000 per year into Aylesbury; a typical ducker would make a profit of around £80–£200 per year.|$|E
5|$|On 15June1839 the {{entrepreneur}} and former Member of Parliament for Buckingham, Sir Harry Verney, 2nd Baronet, opened the Aylesbury Railway. Built {{under the direction}} of Robert Stephenson, it connected the London and Birmingham Railway's Cheddington railway station on the West Coast Main Line to Aylesbury High Street railway station in eastern Aylesbury. On 1October1863 the Wycombe Railway also built a line to Aylesbury, from Princes Risborough railway station to a station on the western side of Aylesbury (the present-day Aylesbury railway station). The arrival of the railway had a powerful impact on <b>the</b> <b>duck</b> industry, and up to a ton of ducks in a night were being shipped from Aylesbury to Smithfield Market in London by 1850.|$|E
5|$|On Sunday 20May in {{the well-to-do}} Strand {{district}} of London, Catesby met Thomas Wintour, John Wright, Thomas Percy and Guy Fawkes, at an inn called <b>the</b> <b>Duck</b> and Drake.

Alone in a private room, all swore an oath of secrecy on a prayer book, and then in another room celebrated Mass with the Jesuit priest (and friend to Catesby) John Gerard. Robert Keyes {{was admitted to the}} group in October 1604, and was charged with looking after Catesby's Lambeth house, where the gunpowder and other supplies were to be stored. Two months later Catesby recruited his servant, Thomas Bates, into the plot, after the latter accidentally became aware of it, and by March 1605 three more were admitted: Thomas Wintour's brother Robert, John Grant and John Wright's brother Christopher.|$|E

5|$|Stock ducks {{would be}} chosen from ducklings hatched in March, with a typical breeder keeping six males and twenty laying females {{at any given}} time. The females would be kept for around a year before mating, {{typically}} to an older male. They would then generally be replaced, to reduce the problems of inbreeding. Stock ducks were allowed to roam freely during the day, and would swim in local ponds which, although privately owned, were treated as common property among <b>the</b> <b>duck</b> breeders; breeders would label their ducks with markings on the neck or head. The stock ducks would forage for greenery and insects, supplemented by greaves (the residue left after the rendering of animal fat). As ducks lay their eggs at night, the ducks would be brought indoors overnight.|$|E

5|$|The {{whistling}} ducks, Dendrocygna, are {{a distinctive}} {{group of eight}} bird species within <b>the</b> <b>duck,</b> goose and swan family Anatidae, which are characterised by a hump-backed, long-necked appearance and the whistled flight calls that give them their English name. They were an early split from the main duck lineage, and were predominant in the Late Miocene before the subsequent extensive radiation of more modern forms in the Pliocene and later. The fulvous whistling duck forms a superspecies with the wandering whistling duck. It has no recognised subspecies, although the birds in northern Mexico and the southern US {{have in the past}} been assigned to D. b. helva, described as having paler and brighter underparts and a lighter crown than D. b. bicolor.|$|E

5|$|Coppola {{originally}} intended to write the screenplay himself, but due to {{his commitment to the}} filming of Gardens of Stone (1987), engaged Arnold Schulman who scripted Capra's A Hole in the Head (1959). Schulman eventually collaborated with David Seidler on the Tucker project. Subsequently, Coppola rewrote the Schulman and Seidler scripts, but an attempt to get a co-writing credit on the film was overruled by the Writers Guild of America, as an arbitration committee determined Coppola did not contribute enough to the script to warrant an on-screen writing credit. The filmmakers devised a $24 million production budget, but Universal Pictures, Walt Disney Pictures, TriStar Pictures and Paramount Pictures wanted Coppola and Lucas to lower it to $15 million. Distributors were also dubious about working with Lucas after the 1986 commercial and critical failures of both Labyrinth and Howard <b>the</b> <b>Duck.</b> Lucas decided to cover the $24 million budget himself, and pre-production proceeded.|$|E
