25|$|Bookbinding is {{an artistic}} craft of great antiquity, {{and at the}} same time, a highly {{mechanized}} industry. The division between craft and industry is not so wide as might at first be imagined. It is interesting to observe that the main problems faced by the mass-production bookbinder are the same as those that confronted the medieval craftsman or the modern hand binder. The first problem is still how to hold together <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> book; secondly is how to cover and protect the gathering of pages once they are held together; and thirdly, how to label and decorate the protective cover.|$|E

25|$|The main {{respiratory}} {{organs of}} Eurypterus were {{what seems to}} be book gills, located in branchial chambers within the segments of the mesosoma. They may have been used for underwater respiration. They are composed of several layers of thin tissue stacked {{in such a way as}} to resemble <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> book, hence the name. In addition, they also possessed five pairs of oval-shaped areas covered with microscopic projections on the ceiling of the second branchial chambers within the mesosoma, immediately below the gill tracts. These areas are known as Kiemenplatten (or gill-tracts, though the former term is preferred). They are unique to eurypterids.|$|E
25|$|In a 1939 essay titled When Fiction Lives in Fiction, Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges {{described}} Flann O'Brien's masterpiece as follows, I have enumerated many verbal labyrinths, {{but none}} so complex {{as the recent}} book by Flann O'Brien, At Swim-Two-Birds. A student in Dublin writes a novel about the proprietor of a Dublin public house, who writes a novel about the habitués of his pub (among them, the student), who in their turn write novels in which proprietor and student figure along with other writers about other novelists. The book consists of the extremely diverse manuscripts of these real or imagined persons, copiously annotated by the student. At Swim-Two-Birds {{is not only a}} labyrinth; it is a discussion of the many ways to conceive of the Irish novel and a repertory of exercises in prose and verse which illustrate or parody all the styles of Ireland. The magisterial influence of Joyce (also an architect of labyrinths, also a literary Proteus) is undeniable, but not disproportionate in this manifold book. Arthur Schopenhauer wrote that dreaming and wakefulness are <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single book, and that to read them in order is to live, and to leaf through them at random, is to dream. Paintings within paintings and books that branch into other books help us sense this oneness.|$|E

The series would follow two brothers—Walter and Gregory—who, after signing themselves into a Faustian deal with a devil named Old Scratch, journey across the Land of the In-Between to track down <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> book of forgotten stories.|$|E

500|$|The flag {{should never}} be depicted, {{displayed}} or flown upside down. Tradition also states that when draped vertically, the flag should not merely be rotated 90degrees, but also reversed. One [...] "reads" [...] a flag like <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> book, {{from top to bottom}} and from left to right, and after rotation the results should be the same. It is considered insulting to display the flag in a frayed or dirty state, and the same rule applies to the flagpoles and halyards used to hoist the flag, which should always be in a proper state of maintenance.|$|E
500|$|The use of {{the word}} [...] "burp"—"plain little Mack did a plain little thing. He burped!"—was also an issue before publication. According to Seuss, the {{publishers}} at Random House, including the president, had to meet {{to decide whether or not}} they could use [...] "burp" [...] because [...] "nobody had ever burped before on <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> children's book". However, despite the publishers' initial worries, it eventually proved to be a hit—in 2001, Publishers Weekly reported that it was 125th on the list of best-selling hardcover children's books in the United States, at just over one million copies.|$|E

500|$|Writing for NDTV, Anupama Chopra {{gave the}} film 2 out of 5, criticising the slow {{screenplay}} and artificial characters who [...] "are {{supposed to be}} unemployed, lonely, and desperately sad, but they always look like they've stepped out of <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fashion magazine.

[...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-News18 panned the film, calling it [...] "deathly boring [...] a challenge to sit through for two reasons in particular– the film has no script to speak of, and the characters are hard to sympathize with. It lacks in terms of interesting plot and consistent characterization".|$|E
500|$|As he {{reflects}} on the past, the General often thinks and dreams about his former friend Francisco de Paula Santander. The historical Francisco de Paula Santander {{was a friend of}} Simón Bolívar, but was later accused of complicity in a plot to assassinate him and sent into exile. In the novel, the General remembers that he had once appointed Santander to govern Colombia because he believed him to be an effective and brave soldier. He formerly regarded Santander as [...] "his other self, and perhaps his better self", but {{by the time of the}} events in The General in His Labyrinth Santander has become the General's enemy and has been banished to Paris after his involvement in the assassination attempt. The General is depicted as tormented by the idea that Santander will return from his exile in France; he dreams, for example, that Santander is eating <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> book, that he is covered in cockroaches, and that he is plucking out his own eyeballs.|$|E
500|$|At Trieste {{a fellow}} MI6 agent, [...] "Captain Nash", {{introduces}} himself and Bond presumes {{he has been}} sent by M as added protection {{for the rest of}} the trip. Romanova is suspicious of Nash, but Bond reassures her that the man is from his own service. After dinner, at which Nash has drugged Romanova, they rest. Bond is woken with a weapon pointing at him and Nash reveals himself to be the killer Grant. Instead of killing Bond immediately, he describes SMERSH's plan. He is to shoot Bond through the heart and dispose of Romanova after leaving a film of their love-making in the luggage; in addition, the Spektor is booby-trapped to explode when examined. As Grant talks, Bond places his metal cigarette case between <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> book he holds in front of him, positioning it in front of his heart to stop the bullet. After Grant fires, Bond collapses to the floor and, when Grant steps over him, he attacks and kills the assassin. Bond and Romanova escape.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the main}} motivations for {{studying}} book embedding cited by [...] involves an application in VLSI design, to the organization of fault-tolerant multiprocessors. In the DIOGENES system developed by these authors, the CPUs of a multiprocessor system are arranged into a logical sequence corresponding to the spine of a book (although this sequence {{may not necessarily be}} placed along a line in the physical layout of this system). Communication links connecting these processors are grouped into [...] "bundles" [...] which correspond to <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> book and act like stacks: connecting one of the processors to {{the start of a new}} communications link pushes all the previous links upward in the bundle, and connecting another processor to the end of a communication link connects it to the one at the bottom of the bundle and pops all the other ones down. Because of this stack behavior, a single bundle can handle a set of communications links that form the edges of a single page in a book embedding. [...] By organizing the links in this way, a wide variety of different network topologies can be implemented, regardless of which processors have become faulty, as long as enough non-faulty processors remain to implement the network. [...] The network topologies that can be implemented by this system are exactly the ones that have book thickness at most equal to the number of bundles that have been made available.|$|E

2500|$|A leaf (often wrongly {{referred}} to as a folio) typically has two pages of text and/or images, front and back, in a finished book. The Latin for leaf is folium, therefore [...] "folio" [...] should be followed by a number to distinguish between recto and verso. Thus [...] "folio 5r" [...] means [...] "on the recto of the leaf numbered 5", although technically not accurate, it is normal to say [...] "on folio 5r". In everyday speech it is common to refer to [...] "turning <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> book", although it would be more accurate to say [...] "turning the leaves of a book"; this is the origin of the phrase [...] "to turn over a new leaf" [...] i.e. to start on a fresh blank page.|$|E

In episode one, Lady Cecily's first scene is an exchange with Jacquetta of Luxembourg and her daughter, Elizabeth Woodville. In this meeting, Jacquetta, as her daughter's mouthpiece, really oversteps the historical mark. The disapproving Duchess, who was known in real life as [...] "proud Cis," [...] is too easily overcome by her social inferiors when they whip out her apparent [...] "secret" [...] affair with a French archer and Elizabeth commands that she bow before her. Lost for words, she is silenced within minutes, almost cowed by them. While contemporary notions of [...] "courtesy" [...] dictated extreme forms of submission to the queen, this is a Lady Cecily straight from <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> novel rather than the actual proud aristocrat who asserted her own right to rule.|$|E
