5|$|A lemon drop is a {{cocktail}} with a lemony, {{sweet and sour}} flavor, whereby the sweet and sour ingredients serve <b>to</b> <b>contrast</b> and balance one another. It is a vodka-based cocktail that is prepared {{with the addition of}} lemon juice, triple sec and simple syrup. Plain or citrus-flavored vodka may be used in its preparation, such as citron vodka. Lemon-flavored vodka is also sometimes used. Lemon juice that has been freshly squeezed may be used, which can produce a superior drink compared to using commercially prepared lemon juice. Some versions are prepared using the juice from Meyer lemons.|$|E
5|$|Astaroth's {{gameplay}} {{was developed}} around {{the concept of}} a powerful fighter that struck at a distance, and has been noted as one of the strongest characters in the Soul series, requiring few mistakes to be made when fighting against Astaroth to defeat him. Measures were put into effect to make the character unique by allowing the player to hold attack buttons in order to strengthen attacks, <b>to</b> <b>contrast</b> against other large character fighting styles in Soulcalibur such as Nightmare's multiple fighting stances.|$|E
5|$|Birmingham {{has a long}} {{cinematic}} history; The Electric on Station Street is {{the oldest}} working cinema in the UK, and Oscar Deutsch opened his first Odeon cinema in Brierley Hill during the 1920s. The largest cinema screen in the West Midlands is located at Millennium Point in the Eastside. Birmingham has also been the location for films including Felicia's Journey of 1999, which used locations in Birmingham {{that were used in}} Take Me High of 1973 <b>to</b> <b>contrast</b> the changes in the city.|$|E

5|$|Built by J.W.Walker and Sons, {{the organ}} was {{completed}} {{only two days}} before the opening of the cathedral in 1967. Made {{as an integral part of}} the new cathedral, the architect, Frederick Gibberd, saw the casework as part of his brief and so designed the striking front to the organ. Using decorative woodwork, Gibberd was inspired by the innovative use of the pipes at Coventry Cathedral and the Royal Festival Hall and so arranged the shiny zinc pipes and brass trumpets en chamade <b>to</b> <b>contrast</b> strikingly with concrete pillars which surround the organ.|$|E
5|$|For the new {{generation}} of students, producers auditioned over six hundred school-aged children in an attempt to provide characters to which the teenaged target-audience could relate. The decision to cast age-similar actors was purposeful <b>to</b> <b>contrast</b> the series from other shows of the same period such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Dawson's Creek, which had cast actors in their twenties as teenagers.|$|E
5|$|In 1899 the {{location}} of the terminus was blocking the expansion of Waterloo station. After much negotiation, the LSWR reached agreement with the London Necropolis Company, the owners of the cemetery and the railway: in return for the existing site, the LSWR re-equipped the London Necropolis Railway and supplied it with a new station on Westminster Bridge Road. This new building was designed <b>to</b> <b>contrast</b> with other funeral directors' premises by being as attractive as possible. In 1902 the railway moved into the new building, and the earlier station was demolished.|$|E

5|$|In 1993, Sindy was {{featured}} in a £500,000 advertising campaign for the fashion company Alexon Group. Sindy was used <b>to</b> <b>contrast</b> her childish fashion with the sophistication of Alexon's fashion range. Each double page spread showed Sindy in a typical outfit superimposed on a real-life setting. The opposite page showed a real woman dressed in Alexon's clothes above the line 'Dressing up for grown ups'.|$|E
5|$|Released in July 1968, Thunderbird 6 had {{a mediocre}} {{reception}} at the box office, which ruled out the production of further sequels in the Thunderbirds film series. Critical response has remained mixed: although the special effects have been praised, commentators are divided {{on the quality of}} the plotting, which is considered either well-paced and concluding on a note of high action, or confusing and inordinately long, with little visual spectacle <b>to</b> <b>contrast</b> with the dialogue. Nevertheless, Thunderbird 6 is viewed favourably in comparison to Jonathan Frakes' 2004 film adaptation, receiving praise for the perceived agelessness of its entertainment value.|$|E
5|$|The band began {{composing}} {{new songs}} in 2011, {{and had the}} album's first recording sessions in early 2012 before the musicians {{decided to take a}} break. As all the band members got into side projects afterwards, work on Lightning Bolt only resumed in March 2013. The music for Lightning Bolt has a harder rock sound with longer songs <b>to</b> <b>contrast</b> predecessor Backspacer (2009), and the lyrics convey singer Eddie Vedder's feelings on aging and mortality.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} {{conceived}} by Watanabe {{as an extension}} of his work on the television series, which he treated as a series of miniature films. So as not to alienate fans of the series, a large amount of aesthetic material was incorporated, while also adjusting it to make it accessible to newcomers. Increased budget and production facilities enabled the use of filming styles associated with live action films and a higher animation quality than the series. Arabic thematic elements were incorporated <b>to</b> <b>contrast</b> against the series, which entailed Watanabe traveling to Morocco for research. The Arabic atmosphere was also used in Kanno's music.|$|E
5|$|The main {{method of}} Candides satire is <b>to</b> <b>contrast</b> {{ironically}} great tragedy and comedy. The story does not invent or exaggerate evils of the world—it displays real ones starkly, allowing Voltaire to simplify subtle philosophies and cultural traditions, highlighting their flaws. Thus Candide derides optimism, for instance, with a deluge of horrible, historical (or at least plausible) events {{with no apparent}} redeeming qualities.|$|E
5|$|The new {{building}} {{was designed for}} attractiveness and modernity <b>to</b> <b>contrast</b> with the traditional gloomy decor associated with the funeral industry. A narrow four-storey building on Westminster Bridge Road held the LNC's offices. Behind it was the main terminal; this held a communal third-class waiting room, mortuaries and storerooms, the LNC's workshops, and a sumptuous oak-panelled Chapelle Ardente, intended for mourners unable to make the journey to Brookwood {{to pay their respects}} to the deceased. This building led onto the two platforms, lined with waiting rooms and a ticket office.|$|E
5000|$|... "Fortis" [...] and [...] "lenis" [...] {{have also}} been used <b>to</b> refer <b>to</b> <b>contrasts</b> of {{consonant}} duration in languages like Jawoyn, Ojibwe, Dalabon, Kunwinjku, and Zurich German. The Zapotec languages are also considered <b>to</b> have <b>contrast</b> of length rather than of voicing. [...] For example, in Mixe, lenis consonants are not only pronounced shorter than their fortis counterparts, {{but they are also}} prone to voicing in voiced environments, which fortis consonants are not.|$|R

5|$|The new building, also {{designed}} by Cyril Bazett Tubbs, {{was designed for}} attractiveness and modernity <b>to</b> <b>contrast</b> with the traditional gloomy decor associated with the funeral industry. A narrow four-storey office building stood at 188 Westminster Bridge Road. The ground floor was taken up by a large arch leading to a waiting room, an office for general enquiries, and the long driveway leading to the station itself; above this were the LNC's offices and boardrooms.|$|E
5|$|The user {{interface}} and menus {{were created by}} Joe Kowalski, who had previously worked on similar game elements for Guitar Hero, Guitar Hero II, and the Rock Band series. Much of the game's interface elements used a medieval woodcut art style, and were designed <b>to</b> <b>contrast</b> well against the world's graphics. The introductory menu is presented as an interactive movie created from live action clips of Jack Black manipulating a prop gatefold vinyl record album, using Adobe After Effects to provide the on-screen text, controls handling, and stitching of separate scenes into a seamless movie.|$|E
5|$|Vaan was {{conceptualized}} {{as the main}} character for Final Fantasy XII in order <b>to</b> <b>contrast</b> the older hero from Square's previous title Vagrant Story {{as a result of}} negative feedback received by fans. Critical reception to Vaan's character has been mixed {{as a result of his}} lack of involvement with the Final Fantasy XIIs plot although various video game publications still found him likable.|$|E

5|$|Art {{director}} Jeremy Cook {{stated that}} maintaining readability and {{clarity of the}} units and combat space was highest priority of the game's art direction. He also {{wanted to make sure}} that the visual style remained consistent with the Halo universe, by ensuring that the recognisable traits of the units and structures were preserved. The Banished's art style was designed <b>to</b> <b>contrast</b> visually with the UNSC. Cook wanted the Banished to be reminiscent of the Covenant, but with a greater emphasis on the aesthetic of the Brute species. Brute vehicles and weapons featured in past Halo games helped influence the design changes and creation of new technology in the Banished's arsenal.|$|E
5|$|Bleach {{was first}} {{conceived}} from Tite Kubo's desire {{to draw a}} shinigami in a kimono, which {{formed the basis for}} the design of the Soul Reapers. Because of this, Kuchiki {{was one of the first}} characters of the series to be created. Before deciding that every Soul Reaper had swords, Kubo thought that they all should use guns, while only Rukia used a scythe. However, this was changed as he created the Soul Reaper kimono. Kubo also mentioned that Rukia did not seem like a lead character, so he created Ichigo Kurosaki to be the series protagonist. Ichigo's initial design had black hair like Rukia; Kubo had to modify Ichigo's appearance <b>to</b> <b>contrast</b> with hers, giving Ichigo orange hair and a trademark scowl.|$|E
5|$|For {{the scene}} of the Prometheus descent to the alien moon LV-223, visual effects art {{director}} Steven Messing referenced NASA imagery, including vortex cloud structures. He also used aerial photographs of locations in Iceland and Wadi Rum shot by VFX supervisor Richard Stammers and his team. Messing painted over these images and combined them with 3D set extensions to create a realistic altered landscape. Scott wanted the ship's descent scenes {{to have a sense of}} grandeur <b>to</b> <b>contrast</b> the dark and shrouded descent featured in Alien. Much of LV-223s world was based upon the world visited in Alien, but scaled back as Scott felt some elements were too unrealistic. Other influences were the Martian mountain Olympus Mons and several large mountain structures on Earth. NASA advisers provided concepts for the aesthetics of alien worlds which were incorporated into the design work. MPC developed a digital representation of Wadi Rum using the design material, modified it to locate the alien pyramid and a landing area for the Prometheus, and resized the planet's natural features relative to the alien structures.|$|E
