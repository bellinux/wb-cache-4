5|$|<b>Topiramate,</b> a {{derivative}} of the naturally occurring sugar monosaccharide D-fructose, {{has been found}} effective in helping alcoholics quit or {{cut back on the}} amount they drink. Evidence suggests that <b>topiramate</b> antagonizes excitatory glutamate receptors, inhibits dopamine release, and enhances inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid function. A 2008 review of the effectiveness of <b>topiramate</b> concluded that the results of published trials are promising, however, as of 2008, data was insufficient to support using <b>topiramate</b> in conjunction with brief weekly compliance counseling as a first-line agent for alcohol dependence. A 2010 review found that <b>topiramate</b> may be superior to existing alcohol pharmacotherapeutic options. <b>Topiramate</b> effectively reduces craving and alcohol withdrawal severity as well as improving quality-of-life-ratings.|$|E
5|$|Various analgesics (painkillers) {{may be used}} in {{controlling}} the headaches of intracranial hypertension. In addition to conventional agents such as paracetamol, a low dose of the antidepressant amitriptyline or the anticonvulsant <b>topiramate</b> have shown some additional benefit for pain relief.|$|E

25|$|No {{high quality}} {{evidence}} has shown any drug very useful as of 2013. Rufinamide, lamotrigine, <b>topiramate</b> and felbamate may be useful.|$|E
25|$|Zonisamide {{has been}} studied for and used as a {{migraine}} preventative medication, when <b>topiramate</b> is either ineffective or cannot be continued due to side effects.|$|E
25|$|Cimetidine, omeprazole, oxcarbazepine, ticlopidine, <b>topiramate,</b> ketoconazole, itraconazole, disulfiram, fluvoxamine, isoniazid, erythromycin, probenecid, propranolol, imipramine, ciprofloxacin, fluoxetine, and {{valproic acid}} prolong {{the action of}} {{diazepam}} by inhibiting its elimination.|$|E
25|$|Less than 1% of {{primidone}} {{users will}} experience a rash. Compared to carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and phenytoin, {{this is very}} low. The rate is {{comparable to that of}} felbamate, vigabatrin, and <b>topiramate.</b> Primidone also causes exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.|$|E
25|$|Zonisamide {{and other}} {{carbonic}} anhydrase inhibitors such as <b>topiramate,</b> furosemide, and hydrochlorothiazide {{have been known}} to interfere with amobarbital, which has led to inadequate anesthetization during the Wada test. Zonisamide may also interact with other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors to increase the potential for metabolic acidosis.|$|E
25|$|Antidepressants of the {{selective}} serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) class {{may have a}} modest benefit. This includes fluoxetine, which is FDA approved, {{for the treatment of}} bulimia, other antidepressants such as sertraline may also be effective against bulimia. <b>Topiramate</b> may also be useful but has greater side effects.|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} of phentermine and <b>topiramate,</b> brand name Qsymia (formerly Qnexa) {{was approved by}} the U.S. FDA on July 17, 2012, as an obesity treatment complementary to a diet and exercise regimen. The European Medicines Agency, by contrast, rejected the combination as a treatment for obesity, citing concerns about long-term effects on the heart and blood vessels, mental health and cognitive side-effects.|$|E
25|$|Primidone is not {{the only}} {{anticonvulsant}} used for essential tremor; the others include <b>topiramate</b> (Topamax) and gabapentin (Neurontin). Other pharmacological agents include alprazolam (Xanax), clonazepam (Klonopin), atenolol, sotalol, nadolol, clozapine, nimodipine, and botilinum toxin A. Many of these drugs were less effective (according to Table 1), but a few were not. Only propranolol has been compared to primidone in a clinical trial.|$|E
25|$|Acamprosate, {{disulfiram}} and <b>topiramate</b> (a novel anticonvulsant sulphonated sugar) {{are also}} used to treat alcohol addiction. Acamprosate has shown effectiveness for patients with severe dependence, helping them to maintain abstinence for several weeks or months. Disulfiram (also called Antabuse) produces a very unpleasant reaction when drinking alcohol that includes flushing, nausea and palpitations. It is more effective for patients with high motivation and some addicts use it only for high risk situations.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, Sachdeo {{and colleagues}} at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey and the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Brunswick {{reported}} that 33% of the patients {{in a group of}} patients taking <b>topiramate</b> experienced a minimum 50% reduction in seizures (specifically drop attacks and tonic–clonics), compared with 8% in the placebo group. It was also found to be effective as an adjunctive therapy in a review published by Drs. Edith Alva Moncayo and Antonio Ruiz Ruiz in March 2003.|$|E
25|$|Headache. A 2011 {{systematic}} review {{found evidence that}} suggests that chiropractic SMT might {{be as effective as}} propranolol or <b>topiramate</b> in the prevention of migraine headaches. A 2011 {{systematic review}} found evidence that does not support the use of SM for the treatment of migraine headaches. A 2006 review found no rigorous evidence supporting SM or other manual therapies for tension headache. A 2005 review found that the evidence was weak for effectiveness of chiropractic manipulation for tension headache, and that it was probably more effective for tension headache than for migraine. A 2004 Cochrane review found evidence that suggests SM may be effective for migraine, tension headache and cervicogenic headache.|$|E
25|$|Very limited {{evidence}} indicates that <b>topiramate</b> or pregabalin {{may be useful in}} the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Limited evidence supports the use of gabapentin or carbamazepine for the treatment of mild or moderate alcohol withdrawal as the sole treatment or as combination therapy with other medications; however, gabapentin {{does not appear to be}} effective for treatment of severe alcohol withdrawal and is therefore not recommended for use in this setting. A 2010 Cochrane review similarly reported that the evidence to support the role of anticonvulsants over benzodiazepines in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal is not supported. Paraldehyde combined with chloral hydrate showed superiority over chlordiazepoxide with regard to life-threatening side effects and carbamazepine may have advantages for certain symptoms.|$|E
500|$|How {{epilepsy}} develops {{after an}} insult to the brain is not fully understood, and gaining such understanding may help researchers find ways to prevent it, or make it less severe or easier to treat. [...] Researchers hope to identify biomarkers, biological indications that epileptogenesis is occurring, as a means to find drugs that can target pathways by which epilepsy develops. [...] For example, drugs could be developed to interfere with secondary brain injury (injury that does not occur at the moment of trauma but results from processes initiated by it), by blocking pathways such as free radical damage to brain tissue. [...] An increase in understanding of age differences in epilepsy development after trauma may also help researchers find biomarkers of epileptogenesis. [...] There is also interest in finding more antiepileptic drugs, with the potential to interfere with epileptogenesis. Some new antiepileptic drugs such as <b>topiramate,</b> gabapentin, and lamotrigine have already been developed and have shown promise in treatment of PTE. [...] No animal model has all the characteristics of epileptogenesis in humans, so research efforts aim to identify one. [...] Such a model may help researchers find new treatments and identify the processes involved in epileptogenesis.|$|E
500|$|Long-term {{use of the}} {{ketogenic}} diet {{in children}} {{increases the risk of}} slowed or stunted growth, bone fractures and kidney stones. The diet reduces levels of insulin-like growth factor 1, which is important for childhood growth. Like many anticonvulsant drugs, the ketogenic diet has an adverse effect on bone health. Many factors may be involved such as acidosis and suppressed growth hormone. About 1 in 20 children on the ketogenic diet will develop kidney stones (compared with one in several thousand for the general population). A class of anticonvulsants known as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (<b>topiramate,</b> zonisamide) are known to increase the risk of kidney stones, but the combination of these anticonvulsants and the ketogenic diet does not appear to elevate the risk above that of the diet alone. The stones are treatable and do not justify discontinuation of the diet. Johns Hopkins Hospital now gives oral potassium citrate supplements to all ketogenic diet patients, resulting in a sevenfold decrease in the incidence of kidney stones. However, this empiric usage has not been tested in a prospective controlled trial. Kidney stone formation (nephrolithiasis) is associated with the diet for four reasons: ...|$|E

2500|$|The most {{effective}} anti-epileptic medication for JME is valproic acid (Depakote). Women are often started on alternative medications due to [...] valproic acid's {{high incidence of}} fetal malformations. Lamotrigine, levetiracetam, <b>topiramate,</b> and zonisamide are alternative anti-epileptic medications with less frequent incidence of pregnancy related complications, and they are often used first in females of childbearing age. Carbamazepine may aggravate primary generalized seizure disorders such as JME. [...] Treatment is lifelong. Patients should be warned to avoid sleep deprivation.|$|E
2500|$|Preventative {{medicines}} include gabapentin (Neurontin), tizanidine (Zanaflex), fluoxetine (Prozac), amitriptyline (Elavil), and <b>topiramate</b> (Topamax). In testing, gabapentin {{was found}} {{to reduce the number}} of headache days a month by 9.1%. Tizanidine {{was found to}} decrease the average frequency of headaches per week, the headache intensity, and the mean headache duration. Through studies, Fluoxetine resulted in better mood ratings and [...] "significant increases in headache-free days". Despite being associated with depression, antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, have been found to effectively treat [...] "near-daily headaches" [...] and numerous chronic pain conditions as well as improving mood and sleep—two possible triggers for chronic headache sufferers. One study found that the headache frequency over a 28-day period lowered for chronic headache patients on <b>topiramate.</b> Another medication to prevent headaches is botulinum toxin type A (BoNTA or BOTOX), which is given by injection instead of being taken orally. In a clinical study of botulinum toxin type A, patients participating in the 9-month treatment period with three treatments experienced headache frequency decreases up to 50%. As with all medications, the preventative medications may have side effects. Since different people respond to drugs differently, chronic headache sufferers may have to go through a [...] "trial-and-error" [...] period to find the right medications. The previously mentioned medicines can improve headaches, but physicians recommend multiple forms of treatments.|$|E
2500|$|Two of {{the most}} {{valuable}} drug treatments for essential tremor are propranolol, a beta blocker, and primidone, an anticonvulsant. [...] Propranolol is much more effective for hand tremor than head and voice tremor. [...] Some beta-adrenergic blockers (beta blockers) are not lipid-soluble and therefore cannot cross the blood–brain barrier (propranolol being an exception), but can still act against tremors; this indicates that this drug’s mechanism of therapy may be influenced by peripheral beta-adrenergic receptors. [...] Primidone’s mechanism of tremor prevention has been shown significantly in controlled clinical studies. [...] The benzodiazepine drugs such as diazepam and barbiturates have been shown to reduce presentation of several types of tremor, including the essential variety. [...] Controlled clinical trials of gabapentin yielded mixed results in efficacy against essential tremor [...] while <b>topiramate</b> was shown to be effective in a larger double-blind controlled study, resulting in both lower Fahn-Tolosa-Marin tremor scale ratings and better function and disability as compared to placebo.|$|E
2500|$|By 1994, {{primidone}} was {{no longer}} {{one of the most}} widely used anticonvulsants. Phenytoin was still regarded as the drug of choice for partial seizures due to its long half-life and low cost; but for children, carbamazepine was seen as the best one due to phenytoin's effects on physical appearance. <b>Topiramate</b> was approved two years later. It, along with the others, was mainly used in patients refractory to carbamazepine and valproate. These new agents were often described as having [...] "innovative" [...] and [...] "selective" [...] mechanisms of action; in reality, most of them also worked similarly to older agents. On February 28, 1998, Élan Corporation, plc, bought the trademark and exclusive product distribution rights for Mysoline from Wyeth in Canada and the United States at a cost of $46 million and a royalty on future sales. The actual manufacture and distribution was done by Athena Neurosciences; their name appeared on a Mysoline package information sheet dated June 1998. On November 30, 1999, levetiracetam was approved for the adjunctive treatment of partial epilepsy in adults in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Treatment of tics {{present in}} {{conditions}} such as Tourette’s syndrome begins with patient, relative, teacher and peer education about {{the presentation of the}} tics. [...] Sometimes, pharmacological treatment is unnecessary and tics can be reduced by behavioral therapy such as habit-reversal therapy and/or counseling. [...] Often this route of treatment is difficult because it depends most heavily on patient compliance. [...] Once pharmacological treatment is deemed most appropriate, lowest effective doses should be given first with gradual increases. [...] The most effective drugs belong to the neuroleptic variety such as monoamine-depleting drugs and dopamine receptor-blocking drugs. [...] Of the monoamine-depleting drugs, tetrabenazine is most powerful against tics and results in fewest side effects. [...] A non-neuroleptic drug found to be safe and effective in treating tics is <b>topiramate.</b> Botulinum toxin injection in affected muscles can successfully treat tics; involuntary movements and vocalizations can be reduced, as well as life-threatening tics that have the potential of causing compressive myelopathy or radiculopathy. Surgical treatment for disabling Tourette’s syndrome has been proven effective in cases presenting with self-injury. [...] Deep Brain Stimulation surgery targeting the globus pallidus, thalamus and other areas of the brain may be effective in treating involuntary and possibly life-threatening tics.|$|E
2500|$|Her {{death was}} {{ultimately}} ruled an accidental drug overdose of the sedative chloral hydrate that became increasingly lethal {{when combined with}} other prescription drugs in her system, specifically four benzodiazepines: Klonopin (Clonazepam), Ativan (Lorazepam), Serax (Oxazepam), and Valium (Diazepam). Furthermore, she had taken Benadryl (Diphenhydramine) and Topamax (<b>Topiramate),</b> an anticonvulsant AMPA/Kainate antagonist, which likely contributed to the sedative effect of chloral hydrate and the benzodiazepines. Although the individual levels {{of any of the}} benzodiazepines in her system would not have been sufficient to cause death, their combination with a high dose of chloral hydrate led to her overdose. The autopsy report indicates that chloral hydrate was the [...] "toxic/lethal" [...] drug, {{but it is difficult to}} know whether chloral hydrate ingestion alone would have killed her, since Dr. Perper indicated (in the March 26 press conference) that she had built up a tolerance to the drug and took more than the average person. He indicated that she took about three tablespoons, whereas the normal dosage is between one and two teaspoons. Chloral hydrate, first synthesized in 1832, was the first depressant developed for the specific purpose of inducing sleep. The infamous [...] "Mickey Finn" [...] or [...] "knockout drops" [...] was a solution of alcohol and chloral hydrate that was popular in Victorian England and in that era's literature. When used properly, and without the introduction of alcohol or other depressants, chloral hydrate is effective in easing sleeplessness due to pain or insomnia. But according to Avis (1990), the effective dose and lethal dose of chloral hydrate are so close that the sedative should be considered dangerous. Today, the use of chloral hydrate has declined as other agents, including barbiturates and benzodiazepines, have largely replaced them. Despite rumors of methadone use due to its involvement in Smith's son's death, Dr. Perper only found methadone in her bile, indicating it could only have been ingested 2–3 days prior to her death and therefore was not a contributing factor. The autopsy report indicates that abscesses on her buttocks (presumably from prior injections of vitamin B12 in the form of cyanocobalamin, as well as human growth hormone), and viral enteritis were contributory causes of death. Tests for influenza A and B were negative.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Topiramate</b> {{itself is}} a weak {{inhibitor}} of CYP2C19 and induces CYP3A4; a decrease in plasma levels of estrogens and digoxin has been noted during <b>topiramate</b> therapy. This can reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives (birth control pills); use of alternative birth control methods is recommended.

50|$|The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has {{notified}} prescribers that <b>topiramate</b> {{can cause}} acute myopia and secondary angle closure glaucoma {{in a small}} subset of people who take <b>topiramate</b> regularly.
