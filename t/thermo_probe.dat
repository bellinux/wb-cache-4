Characterization methods include XRD, SEM, active <b>thermo</b> <b>probe,</b> pulse echo, and piezometer measurements. A special {{focus is on the}} characterization of AlN regarding the mechanical stress in the films. The stress in the films changed between − 2. 2 GPa(compressive) and 0. 2 GPa (tensile) and showed a significant dependence on film thickness. The cause of this behavior is presumed to be the different mean grain sizes at different film thicknesses, with bigger mean grain sizes at higher thicknesses. Other influences on film stress such as the sputter pressure or the pulse mode are presented. The deposition of gradient layers using those influences allowed the adjustment of film stress while retaining the piezoelectric properties...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – In {{the present}} study a <b>thermo</b> anemometric {{interference}} <b>probe</b> of a hot wire and a hot film is proposed for simultaneous measurements of velocity and concentration in a turbulent flow of an air/helium mixture. In addition to the average values, the turbulent fluctuations and their correlations represent essential quantities to understand and try to model the transfer mechanisms. A judicious choice of the instruments is critical for a well measurement of these quantities. The first selection criterion of the measuring instruments is related to a better frequency response. A second significant criterion {{is related to the}} size of the probes which must be most reduced as possible in order to limit the disturbances brought to the flow. With these two considerations a third is added, rather of a practical nature, which consists of a good choice of the overheating applied to the probe elements. In the present case, the wire, upstream element, is heated definitely more than the downstream film. For this configuration of overheating, the concentrations curves are clearly dissociated lines. This operating mode makes it possible in particular to extend the velocity range accessible to measurements for mixtures going of the air to helium pure.

30|$|ZnO and Co-doped ZnO (Zn 1 −xCoxO, x[*]=[*] 0.01, 0.05, 0.1) powder {{samples were}} {{fabricated}} by sol-gel methods [16, 17]. Zinc acetate dihydrate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and cobalt acetate tetrahydrate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), used as starting materials, were dissolved in 2 -methoxyethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and stabilized by monoethanolamine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). To exclude {{the possibility of}} external contamination, the dissolution and drying processes were performed under a pure argon gas (99.999 % purity) atmosphere, and under vacuum, each for 10  h, respectively. The organic residuals in samples were completely removed via an intermediate heat treatment at 300 °C and a subsequent final heat treatment at 800 °C under vacuum for 10  h [16]. The samples {{used in this study}} were characterized using XRD, and we found a high degree of crystallinity, which was comparable to that of commercially available high-quality powder samples (ZnO; CAS 1314 - 13 - 2, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). We also characterized the samples using synchrotron radiation, and we found high sample quality. A characterization study using synchrotron radiation will be submitted to a specialized journal soon. XRD (Empyrean Series 2, PANalytical) experiments were performed to analyze the crystal structures and electron density distributions of the powder samples. The Rietveld and MEM analyses were performed using a published technique [18]. The MEM calculation was performed using ENIGMA software [19] with 66 [*]×[*] 66 [*]×[*] 104  pixels. The electron density distribution was reconstructed using the VESTA visualization program [20]. An X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (model: Theta <b>Probe</b> (<b>Thermo</b> Electron Co., Waltham, MA, USA), Korean Basic Science Institute, Busan Center) was used for atomic composition analysis. Magnetic-field-dependent magnetization was measured using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) equipped with a physical property measurement system (PPMS; Model 6000, Quantum Design, San Diego, CA, USA).|$|R
40|$|At the Paul Scherrer Institute's Calibration Laboratory, neutron {{reference}} {{fields are}} {{provided for the}} calibration of ambient and personal dose equivalent (rate) metres and passive dosemeters. To ensure traceability {{to the standards of}} the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) in Germany, the neutron fields are characterised by means of a PTB-calibrated Berthold LB 6411 neutron probe which is used as a secondary standard. The LB 6411 detector suffers from an unstable, increasing dose rate reading in the order of up to + 5 % (according to the manufacturers, this is due to a charging effect in the 3 He proportional counter). In a calibration, this instability is usually corrected for based on the reading obtained with a test source. In this work, the instability was investigated by means of measurements under irradiation with ambient dose equivalent rates up to 24 mSv h- 1 for up to 20 h and compared with the behaviour of an LB 6419 and a <b>Thermo</b> Wendi- 2 <b>probe.</b> The reading of the instruments was found to reach a plateau, e. g. it becomes stable after ∼ 90 min during irradiation with 10 mSv h- 1 neutrons. The plateau is reached faster for higher dose rates. This supports the interpretation as a charging effect in the proportional counter. The effect could also be duplicated in an irradiation with photons from a 137 Cs source. The decay time of the accumulated charge was found to be very long, i. e. the instrument showed a stable reproducible reading for up to 6 h after the plateau was reached. From these observations, a conditioning procedure was derived which ensures a stable operation of the instrument after an irradiation of the instrument preceding its use in the reference measurement...|$|R
30|$|The as-received Zr- 4 sheets {{were cut}} into 20 [*]×[*] 25 [*]×[*] 0.7  mm 3 and cleaned by sonicating in acetone, {{isopropyl}} alcohol, and methanol without mechanical, chemical, and electrochemical polishing. Subsequently, the Zr- 4 sheets were rinsed with DI water and dried {{in an air}} stream at high pressure. The samples were anodized in EG (99.3  wt.%, extra pure; Junsei Chemical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) electrolyte containing 0.5  wt.% ammonium fluoride (NH 4 F, Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 0.2  wt.% DI water. The anodization process was carried out using a two-electrode system with platinum gauze (15 [*]×[*] 25 [*]×[*] 0.2  mm 3) as a counter electrode and Zr- 4 sheet as a working electrode. The distance between the cathode and anode was fixed at 10  mm. All the chemicals and materials were used in their as-received forms without any further purification. Anodization was conducted at a constant voltage of 40  V for 4  h at room temperature using a DC power supply. The anodization induces Zr- 4 oxide nanotube arrays {{on the surface of}} Zr- 4 sheets, and these nanotubes were washed with DI water many times and dried in air using high pressure. The as-anodized Zr- 4 oxide nanotubes were annealed in air for 2  h at 450 °C at the rate of 3 °C/min. The structural morphology of the nanotubes was examined using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Hitachi S- 4800; Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, Tecnai G 2 F 30; FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR, USA). The cross-sectional FESEM images were taken from mechanically cracked samples. Elemental analysis was done using an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyzer attached onto the HRTEM. The crystal structure and phase composition were identified with the help of glancing-angle X-ray diffractometer (GAXRD, D/MAX 2500  V, Rigaku Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) with Cu Kα radiation (k = 1.5406  Å). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out using a spectrometer (Sigma <b>Probe,</b> <b>Thermo</b> VG Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with an Al Kα excitation source operated at 15  kV and 7  mA. The binding energies of all elements were calibrated using the C 1 s peak at 284.0  eV.|$|R
30|$|For {{analysis}} of a cellulase candidate substrate specificity, a crude cell extract (CCE) containing enzyme was heated at 65  °C for 20  min followed by centrifugation at 13, 000 ×g for 5  min at 4  °C for removal of heat labile host proteins. The remaining heat-treated crude cell extract was kept at 4  °C until assayed on different cellulose substrates [carboxymethylcellulose (CMC; Sigma-Aldrich C 5678, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, Mi, USA), and microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel; Avicel® PH- 101; Sigma 11, 363)], either undiluted or 5 × diluted, and either alone or together {{with one or two}} additional commercial cellulose-acting enzymes. Enzyme reactions were carried out in 96 well plates wherein 150  µl of substrate (stock 10  g/l) were subjected to enzymatic reactions with one or several enzymes, 20  µl of each enzyme (3 x 20  µl for three enzyme reactions, 2  ×  20  µl for two enzyme reactions and 1  ×  20  µl for one enzyme reactions), with 50  mM potassium acetate buffer pH 5.5 added up to a total of 60  µl per well. The amounts of enzyme added in the volume of 20  µl were for endoglucanase (Sigma E 2164) 1.05  mg/ml (2.1  U), cellobiohydrolase (Sigma E 6412) 1.95  mg/ml (0.14  U) and beta-glucosidase (Sigma 49, 290) 0.55 mg/ml (3.3  U). Enzyme reactions were conducted in triplicate at 50  °C for 60  min, followed by heat inactivation of the enzyme(s) at 90  °C for 15  min and centrifugation (10  min at 5000 ×g). The supernatant after centrifugation was used for {{analysis of}} the enzyme reaction products. Glucose as a reaction product was quantified by the Amplex Ultra Red assay (Molecular <b>Probes,</b> <b>Thermo</b> Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) in 96 -well microtiter plate format. 50  µl hydrolysate after enzyme reaction was mixed with 50  µl pre-assembled reaction solution (0.1  mM Amplex Ultra Red, 1 U HRP, 10 U glucose oxidase in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), total volume 5  ml), and the mixture was incubated in the dark for 15  min, followed by fluorescence reading (excitation/emission at 530 / 590  nm). Amplex Ultra Red detects H 2 O 2, which is formed from free glucose by glucose oxidase (Invitrogen, Molecular Probes Amplex UltraRed protocol) in the reaction solution.|$|R
