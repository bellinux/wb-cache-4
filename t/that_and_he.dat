5|$|Kaleski's {{standard}} {{was adopted by}} breed clubs in Queensland and New South Wales and re-issued as their own, with local changes. His writings from the 1910s give an important insight into {{the early history of}} the breed. However, dog breeder and author Noreen Clark has noted that his opinions are sometimes just <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> introduces some contradictory assertions in his later writings, as well as some assumptions that are illogical in the light of modern science. Some of these have persisted; for example he saw the red colour form as having more dingo in it than the blue form, and there is a persistent belief that reds are more vicious than blues. The most enduring of Kaleski's myths relate to Dalmatian and Kelpie infusions into the early Cattle Dog breed. These infusions are not referred to in Kaleski's writings until the 1920s and it seems likely that Kaleski sought to explain the Cattle Dog's mottled colouration and tan on legs by similarity to the Dalmatian and Kelpie, respectively. The genetics of coat colour, and the current understanding of hereditary characteristics, make the infusion of Dalmatian to increase the cattle dog's tolerance of horses an extremely unlikely event. There were relatively few motor vehicles in Australia {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, so most dogs of any breed would have been accustomed to horses. The Kelpie breed was developed after the Cattle Dog type was described, so its infusion is unlikely. It is possible that there was some infusion of Bull Terrier but there is no verifiable record of this, and the Cattle Dog has not had the Bull Terrier's instinct to bite and hold, which would have been an undesirable trait. Early in the 1900s there was considerable in-fighting amongst members of the Cattle Dog Club, and a series of arguments about the origin of the breed appeared in newspapers and journals of the time. While many of these arguments were misleading, some irrational, and the majority not supported by historical facts, they continue to be circulated, resulting in a number of theories on the origins of the breed. In recent years, information technology enabling the manipulation of large databases combined with advances in the understanding of canine genetics has allowed a clearer understanding of the development of the breed.|$|E

25|$|In 1960, in a {{very weak}} Leicestershire team, Cromack played in 20 first-team matches, often, in a brittle batting line-up, coming in as high as No 6, though he {{averaged}} less than 11 runs per innings for the season. With a bowling attack geared towards seam bowling with Terry Spencer and Brian Boshier, and an established spinner in John Savage, Cromack was bowled sparingly, and took only 28 wickets all season. The match against Middlesex at Lord's was his sixth first-class game, but to that point he had taken just two first-class wickets; he took six for 48 in Middlesex's first innings, the best bowling figures of his career. But then Leicestershire had to follow on and when they batted again they squandered a first-wicket partnership of 196 by losing all 10 wickets for a further 18 runs, giving the home team an easy victory. Two weeks later, he scored 55 against Hampshire, his highest score. There was a second half-century {{at the end of}} June with 53 in the game against Nottinghamshire. But Cromack's season subsided after <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> was left out of several matches in August.|$|E

Eventually, Jack and Kenneth come down to the final hand. Jack has more chips and goes all-in. He offers to make the hand winner-take-all if Kenneth bets his page jacket. Kenneth agrees, and Jack's pair of twos beats Kenneth's king high. Liz asks why Kenneth would bet on a hand like <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> responds that he enjoys living on the edge and was also confused about the rules. Jack stops Kenneth from leaving, explains that he only made Kenneth bet his job to prove his power over him, and returns the jacket to Kenneth with the expectation that he come in early on Monday.|$|E
500|$|Mota {{never played}} a game with the Red Sox, as on January 27, 2006, he {{was traded to the}} Cleveland Indians with Andy Marte, Kelly Shoppach, a player to be named later (eventually Randy Newsom), and cash {{considerations}} for Coco Crisp, David Riske, and Josh Bard. The trade was postponed slightly because Mota failed to pass a physical, so the Indians put him on a conditioning program before spring training. However, he was still expected to be the setup man for closer Bob Wickman. He started the season well, as he did not allow an earned run in his first seven games. However, he struggled after <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> lost the setup role to Rafael Betancourt in May. Over his next 27 games, Mota had a 7.89 ERA, and opponents batted [...]314 against him. On August 11, he was designated for assignment after he had a 1–3 record with a 6.21 ERA in 34 games. On August 20, he was traded to the New York Mets with cash for a player to be named later. To date, his time with the Indians was his only stint in the American League.|$|E

The Secretary of State always is involved in a lot of controversial things, and here we had the McCarthy era, the attack on the whole concept of Foreign Service and the State Department, and a terrific controversy over what to do about China, who had [...] "lost China." [...] Fisher was always at Acheson's right hand when he was dealing with other people about these things. Wherever he went, Fisher's office was backstopping him, getting all the necessary background information so he'd be prepared for any kind of question that came up. Of course, Acheson's own approach to being Secretary of State was such that when you took an agreement to him to be signed, his chief question was [...] "By what authority do I sign this?"

It was also spread that the band's withdrawal from the tour was due to Chamberlain's rumored drug problems and time spent in rehabilitation, to which Gillespie responded, [...] "If there was something serious going on like <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> was in rehab, we'd have to tell the press. But it's just not true."

Chris was also repeatedly compared with Leon by IGN, both of them being regarded as the series' leading heroes. In 2010, GamesRadar website featured his team-up with Sheva in an article about gaming's [...] "most violent double acts" [...] for their actions in Resident Evil 5.
