5|$|In Lawrence v. Texas (2003), <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> a Texas {{law against}} {{same-sex}} sexual intercourse violated {{the right to}} privacy. In Obergefell v. Hodges (2015), the Court ruled that the fundamental right to marriage included same-sex couples being able to marry.|$|E
5|$|Though the act won easy {{passage through}} the Social Credit-dominated legislature, Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta John C. Bowen {{reserved}} royal assent until the Supreme Court of Canada evaluated the act's legality. In 1938's Reference re Alberta Statutes, <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> it was unconstitutional, and it never became law.|$|E

50|$|At {{trial and}} on appeal, <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> {{if there ever}} was {{aboriginal}} title in the land it was surely extinguished.|$|R
50|$|In 1993, Intel {{alleged that}} Cyrix had infringed several patents and {{initiated}} legal action. <b>The</b> <b>courts</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> Cyrix had indeed reverse engineered the Intel part, but had conceived their own compatible design, <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> also <b>found</b> <b>that</b> Texas Instruments, SGS-Thomson and IBM were licensed to produce Intel designs. Eventually {{the case was}} dropped and Intel paid Cyrix $12 million to drop anti-trust charges against them.|$|R
5|$|Posner also {{rejected}} {{the argument that}} the defendants were removing the painting to save Chicago from racial riots that the continued showing of the painting might have started, and in which it might have been destroyed. He found that Tillman herself threatened to burn the painting on the spot, {{and that there was no}} mob. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> because Nelson had not intended to provoke a riot, the First Amendment could still be used to protect his speech.|$|E
5|$|Abramski v. United States, , was a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> making {{arrangements}} for a straw purchase of a gun is {{in violation of the}} Gun Control Act of 1968, and is different from re-selling or gifting a previously purchased gun. In the Abramski case, a former police officer from Virginia took advantage of a local discount to buy a gun for his uncle and later transferred it to Pennsylvania—the uncle's residence—using the appropriate federal procedure. During the purchase, Abramski falsely declared that he is purchasing the gun for himself.|$|E
5|$|Judge Vanaskie instead found {{guidance}} from the Supreme Court's 1994 holding in Waters v. Churchill, {{in which it}} had upheld an Illinois public hospital's dismissal of a nurse for her comments about a supervisor to a colleague, despite an ongoing factual dispute about the substance of those comments. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the hospital administration had made a reasonable attempt to investigate what the nurse had said before firing her. In that case, the Court had said explicitly that disciplining employees for things they did not actually do did not {{rise to the level}} of a constitutional violation.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>courts</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> Atari had infringed Nintendo's {{copyright}} {{by creating}} verbatim and substantially similar {{copies of the}} protected elements of the 10NES chip.

5|$|The {{original}} §14 of Article IV forbade {{the incorporation}} of churches, though the Virginia Commission on Constitutional Revision, in its 1969 report, had recognized that the prohibition was probably invalid. The federal district court for the Western District of Virginia ruled in April 2002 that this provision of the Virginia Constitution was in fact unconstitutional, because it violates the federal constitutional right to {{the free exercise of}} religion. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> it is unconstitutional to deny a church the option to incorporate under state law when other groups can incorporate. An amendment striking the ban on church incorporation was approved by Virginia voters in November 2006.|$|E
5|$|A {{court of}} enquiry was held the {{following}} month in Liverpool by the Board of Trade, and focused particularly on {{the roles of the}} captains in the tragedy as well as the design of the Liverpool lifeboat. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> no-one was to blame for the loss of either Ellen Southard or the Liverpool lifeboat. Captain James Martin and his crew were praised for their gallantry in getting everyone off the ship, and absolved of any blame with respect to the capsizing of the lifeboat. The lifeboat was furthermore found to be of sound design and suitably adapted to her role, but debate continued for many years about the merits of the tubular design vs the self-righting one, as well as the requirement for lifeboats to be powered.|$|E
5|$|As the Director-General was {{a public}} officer {{appointed}} by statute to discharge public duties, he was subject to an order of prohibition in an appropriate case. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> on the affidavit evidence produced by the applicants, the Director-General could not reasonably {{have come to the}} conclusion he came to without hearing the applicants' witnesses. He had thus misdirected himself on the law as to the nature of the evidence that was required to be produced to prove the export of the goods. Finally, there had been an insufficient inquiry which had resulted in a failure to take into account relevant considerations, and an investigation that was unfair to the applicant. The Court therefore made an order of prohibition against the Director-General to prevent him from deducting money from the bankers' guarantees.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> District <b>Court</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> facts alleged in Iqbal's {{complaint}} were sufficient. <b>The</b> district <b>court</b> also <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> OIG Report {{suggested that}} petitioners were personally involved in “creating or implementing” {{the policies that}} led to respondent’s confinement in the ADMAX SHU.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>courts</b> <b>found</b> <b>that,</b> while [...] "the {{standard}} of care for engineers in the industry" [...] after a failed safety test was to [...] "redesign and retest," [...] and although fixes were inexpensive, [...] "Ford produced and sold the Pinto to the public without doing anything to remedy the defects." ...|$|R
500|$|Unlike in Pink and Belmont, an {{executive}} agreement on potato imports from Canada, litigated in United States v. Guy W. Capps, Inc., another oft cited case, <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> declared an agreement unenforceable.

5|$|At present, it is {{not clear}} what {{evidence}} the President may rely on to be satisfied that the Prime Minister has ceased to command the confidence of a majority of MPs, as the Singapore courts have not yet had to decide the issue. In the Sarawak case of Stephen Kalong Ningkan v. Tun Abang Haji Openg, decided on provisions similar to those in the Singapore Constitution, <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the phrase ceased to command the confidence of a majority of the Members of Parliament was a term of art which had to be signified by a formal vote of no confidence taken by the legislature. In contrast, a Sabah court held in Datuk Amir Kahar v. Tun Mohd Said bin Keruak, Yang di-Pertua Negeri Sabah that loss of confidence could be assessed on the basis of evidence other than a legislative vote. This might include, for instance, media reports or letters addressed to the President.|$|E
5|$|The Veterans Administration (VA), {{charged with}} {{implementing}} {{the provisions of}} the G.I. Bill, denied benefits to blue-discharge veterans, despite the Bill's explicit language that made only a dishonorable discharge grounds for denying benefits to a veteran. In 1945, the VA issued a directive that all blue-discharges for homosexuality would be denied benefits. On December 22, 1955, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied an appeal from Raymond W. Longernecker, who had been denied his G.I. Bill benefits by the VA because of his blue discharge. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the VA had discretion in awarding benefits and that Congress had specifically foreclosed the courts from overruling it. Nevertheless, the Court noted that the denial of benefits should only have occurred if Longernecker had been dishonorably discharged and that the VA Administrator was acting without authority in treating a blue discharge as if it were dishonorable.|$|E
5|$|Information on West Cheswalds {{early career}} is lacking, but records {{of some of}} her {{movements}} and cargo are available. On 30 September 1920, West Cheswald took on a load of white sugar at Java {{and headed for the}} United States via the Suez Canal. While she was near Bermuda, West Cheswald was diverted from her original destination of New York to Philadelphia, to deliver her cargo in fulfillment of an order. Because the cargo had not been originally headed to Philadelphia, the purchasers refused to pay for it, believing that the voyage took too long. After litigation and various appeals, the case ended up before the Supreme Court of the United States in 1928 as Lamborn v. National Bank of Commerce, 276 U.S. 469 (1928). <b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> under the contract signed, the purchasers were obligated for the sugar {{regardless of whether or not}} the ship had originally been destined for Philadelphia. West Cheswald was also reported in Hawaiian service during 1920. The report of the Governor of Hawaii in the annual report of the United States Department of the Interior for the 1920–21 fiscal year, listed West Cheswald among the four -owned ships sailed to Hawaii by the Pacific Steamship Company.|$|E
50|$|Curtis McCarty was {{released}} in 2007 after spending nearly 20 years on death row. <b>The</b> <b>courts</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> Gilchrist acted to either alter or intentionally lose evidence. McCarty sued Gilchrist for her wrongdoing, but his case was thrown out on technical terms, like those of most exonerees. He has received no compensation for the injustice he suffered.|$|R
50|$|In 1989, Green unsuccessfully {{attempted}} {{to sue the}} New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation for copyright infringement over a similar programme. The clap-o-meter {{was one of the}} distinctive features of the format by which Green sought to define it as copyrightable. <b>The</b> <b>courts</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> a loose format defined by catchphrases and accessories, such as the clap-o-meter, was not copyrightable.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "natural right" [...] {{aspect of}} the {{doctrine}} was repudiated by <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> in <b>the</b> United Kingdom (Donaldson v. Beckett, 1774) and the United States (Wheaton v. Peters, 1834). In both countries, <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> copyright is a limited right created by the legislature under statutes and subject to the conditions and terms the legislature sees fit to impose.|$|R
5|$|The first {{shipment}} of coins, $130,000 in half dollars, arrived by ship on December 9, 1883. Hawaii {{was still in}} an economic recession. A number {{of members of the}} business community, including Sanford B. Dole, objected to the issue on the grounds that so much silver would inflate the currency, and went to court to prevent the government from giving Spreckels bonds in exchange for anything except gold coin, as the law required. The government opposed the action, which was brought in the islands' supreme court, {{on the grounds that the}} silver coins were equivalent to gold. The chief justice, A. F. Judd, granted a temporary writ of mandamus against the government giving the Dole plaintiffs what they wanted, finding that the coins were not equivalent to gold, and that the coinage and loan acts had been violated. On appeal to the full court, though, Judd was reversed, as <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> Dole and his associates should have filed for an injunction. But when they did, the petition was denied. In the interim at a meeting chaired by the king, the privy council had declared the new coinage a legal tender; once the lawsuit was resolved, the government paid for a half million dollars in coins with a like amount of bonds.|$|E
25|$|In Gregg, Proffitt, and Jurek, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> {{the capital}} {{sentencing}} schemes of Georgia, Florida, and Texas, respectively, met these criteria; whereas in Woodson and Roberts, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the sentencing schemes of North Carolina and Louisiana did not.|$|E

50|$|On remand, <b>the</b> trial <b>court</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Bank had “failed {{to provide}} any {{adequate}} justification for its failure to properly respond to Bud Bailey’s garnishment interrogatory regarding the offsets.” <b>The</b> trial <b>court</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> just amount to assess against the bank for its failures is the full amount that it held for Construction Associates at the time Bud Bailey served its writ of garnishment plus his attorney fees. The bank appeals.|$|R
