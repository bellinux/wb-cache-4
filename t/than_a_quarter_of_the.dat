5|$|The GRC scheme {{came into}} effect on 1 June 1988. Prior to that date, all {{constituencies}} were Single Member Constituencies (SMCs). Now, the Parliamentary Elections Act (Cap. 218, 2008 Rev. Ed.) ("PEA") states {{that there must}} be at least eight SMCs, and the number of MPs to be returned by all GRCs cannot be less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total number of MPs. Within those parameters the total number of SMCs and GRCs in Singapore and their boundaries are not fixed but are decided by the Cabinet, taking into consideration the recommendations of the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, demand for pennies was falling in Britain, {{likely due to}} the {{popularity}} of the lighter, more convenient, brass threepence coin. which weighed less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same value in bronze coins. The immediate aftermath of the war had seen a strong demand for pennies until January 1949, when it dropped off, and in May of that year, the Royal Mint stopped the coin's production. Officials concluded that the fall in demand was permanent due to inflation; its purchasing power was minimal, and many automatic machines no longer took it. The Royal Mint redeemed surplus coppers from the banks for melting beginning in 1951, {{and by the end of}} the decade, some £1.2 million worth had been removed from circulation.|$|E
5|$|The 17 UCI WorldTeams were {{automatically}} invited and {{obliged to}} attend the race. In October 2014, five UCI Professional Continental teams were awarded wildcard places in the race by RCS Sport, the organisers of the Giro, to complete the 22-team peloton. As there were nine men in each team, the initial startlist consisted of 198 riders. However, as 's George Bennett was forced to withdraw before the race start due to a blood test that revealed {{a low level of}} cortisol, only 197 riders started the first stage. These came from 36 countries; more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peloton (59 riders) were Italian, while no other nation had more than 15 riders participating in the race.|$|E
5|$|The President, at the Cabinet's direction, {{declares}} {{the electoral}} divisions {{that are to}} be GRCs; the number of candidates (three to six) to stand for Parliament in each GRC; and whether the minority candidates in each GRC are to be from the Malay, Indian, or other minority communities. The number of GRCs in which at least one MP must be from the Malay community must be three-fifths {{of the total number of}} GRCs, and the number of MPs to be returned by all GRCs cannot be less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total number of MPs to be returned at a general election.

5|$|Both dorsal fins are {{immediately}} preceded by stout, grooved spines, {{with the second}} much longer than the first. The small first dorsal fin has a rounded apex and a nearly straight trailing margin, with its origin lying behind the pectoral fins. The second dorsal fin is rather angular and has about double {{the area of the}} first, with its origin located opposite the midpoint of the pelvic fin bases. The pectoral fins are small and rounded. The pelvic fins are about as large as the second dorsal fin, with rounded tips and nearly straight trailing margins. The caudal peduncle is short and leads to a broad caudal fin comprising less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total length; the upper lobe has a convex upper margin leading to a squared-off tip, while the lower lobe is indistinct. The skin is densely covered by tiny dermal denticles; each one is recurved and thorn-like, rising from an irregular star-shaped base. This species is a plain dark brown above, darkening to almost black below, with white dorsal fin spines. Juvenile sharks have white edges on the dorsal, pectoral, and pelvic fins. Minute, luminescent dots are scattered about the skin without a regular pattern.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} Acrocanthosaurus, {{like most other}} allosauroids, was long, low and narrow. The weight-reducing opening {{in front of the}} eye socket (antorbital fenestra) was quite large, more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> length of the skull and two-thirds of its height. The outside surface of the maxilla (upper jaw bone) and the upper surface of the nasal bone {{on the roof of the}} snout were not nearly as rough-textured as those of Giganotosaurus or Carcharodontosaurus. Long, low ridges arose from the nasal bones, running along each side of the snout from the nostril back to the eye, where they {{continued}} onto the lacrimal bones. This is a characteristic feature of all allosauroids. Unlike Allosaurus, there was no prominent crest on the lacrimal bone in front of the eye. The lacrimal and postorbital bones met to form a thick brow over the eye, as seen in carcharodontosaurids and the unrelated abelisaurids. Nineteen curved, serrated teeth lined each side of the upper jaw, but a tooth count for the lower jaw has not been published. Acrocanthosaurus teeth were wider than those of Carcharodontosaurus and did not have the wrinkled texture that characterized the carcharodontosaurids. The dentary (tooth-bearing lower jaw bone) was squared off at the front edge, as in Giganotosaurus, and shallow, while the rest of the jaw behind it became very deep. Acrocanthosaurus and Giganotosaurus shared a thick horizontal ridge on the outside surface of the surangular bone of the lower jaw, underneath the articulation with the skull.|$|E
