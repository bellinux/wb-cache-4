60|$|HOTCHKISS. <b>To</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure.</b> <b>I</b> {{beg your}} pardon. [He alters the draft].|$|E
60|$|How clever he was, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure!</b> <b>I</b> saw in {{a moment}} Jack had {{interpreted}} my whole frame of mind correctly and wonderfully.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh!' said Traddles. 'Yes, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure!</b> <b>I</b> am {{very much}} obliged to you, Copperfield; but--I am afraid I have lent him that already.' ...|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} me for several moments as though anxious <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>I</b> had spoken the truth.|$|R
60|$|CORNELIUS. <b>To</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> Barney: <b>I</b> forgot. [To Broadbent, {{introducing}} Barney] Mr Doran. He owns {{that fine}} mill you noticed from the car.|$|R
60|$|When I divined this I saw my revenge. <b>To</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> when <b>I</b> {{thought of}} it I {{had no reason to}} want revenge. She had <b>been</b> most gracious <b>to</b> me.|$|R
60|$|<b>To</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>I</b> felt badly {{enough that}} day in October when I left it. When the train left Valleyfield I just cried like a baby.|$|E
6000|$|... "The old lady! No, {{the young}} lady, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure.</b> <b>I</b> shall think {{you a great}} blockhead, Frank, if you bring the aunt without the niece." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly, my high old cock! <b>To</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> will. Don't {{worry about}} it--give your mind no more uneasiness on that subject. I'll bring the hot water." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Mr. Thwaite, {{that is what}} I mean; though I {{hope that}} in coming to me you knew me well enough <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>I</b> would not willingly offend you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{consequence}} of her behavior to your aunt, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure!</b> No: <b>I</b> have said all I wanted to say--and I {{have no time}} to spare for answering idle questions. Good-by." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Was <b>I?</b> Was <b>I?</b> <b>To</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> yes. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{saying that}} you ought not to let {{yourself}} get tired. Deuce of a thing, getting tired. Plays the dickens with the system." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, poor Topsy! <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>I</b> will. There--every {{time you}} look at that, think that I love you, and wanted {{you to be a}} good girl!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jo," [...] repeats Allan, {{looking at}} him with attention, [...] "Jo! Stay. <b>To</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure!</b> <b>I</b> {{recollect}} this lad some time ago being brought before the coroner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Off! <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> did--do {{you think}} I wanted a barber's clerk for a son-in-law? No, no, Denbigh; a soldier is bad enough, {{without having a}} preacher." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{seem very}} much in the dark," [...] I said presently; for now there was silence again, and beneath this {{extinguisher}} I felt alarmed and wished <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not left alone.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{will not}} be the worse of another bolting," [...] said the Miller; [...] "it <b>is</b> always best <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> as <b>I</b> say when I chance to take multure twice from the same meal-sack." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then let us haste," [...] said Matai Shang. [...] "But <b>to</b> <b>be</b> doubly <b>sure,</b> <b>I</b> {{will leave}} two who shall patrol this runway. Later they may follow us upon another flier--overtaking us at Kaol." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ay, Sir,' said Mr. Tripp, 'every {{one that}} come here do be crying out upon the pews; and <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>I</b> see the folk sleepin' in them as is shameful!' ...|$|E
6000|$|CHARLES. [Aloud.] <b>To</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>I</b> {{once thought}} the lady {{seemed to have}} taken a fancy--but upon my soul I never gave her the least encouragement.--Beside you know my Attachment to Maria-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>I</b> {{suppose there}} are. But while I visit at Hartfield, {{and you are}} so kind to me, Miss Woodhouse, I am not afraid of what any body can do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is a great}} deal, as men go. It {{would be}} a great deal <b>to</b> me <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>I</b> had left you in the hands of one who is, of his nature, tender and affectionate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There, that's my banker's book. You {{read off}} the figures, Haco, for <b>I</b> can't. <b>To</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> if <b>I</b> {{had wanted to}} know, Tottie could have told me, but I haven't had the heart {{to look at it}} till to-day." ...|$|R
60|$|Thereon he scooted with a subdued grin {{round the}} other side of the bush, whence as I knew well he kept his eye fixed on me <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>I</b> made no further attempt to take off the Great Medicine.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure.</b> <b>I</b> can't think why grown-up {{people always}} write on purpose for one {{not to read}} them.--'Melancholy event that has placed you in {{possession}} of {{the horrors of the}} family.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure!</b> <b>I</b> {{never thought}} for a moment you had come for pleasure, or out of civility, as it might be. Of course I didn't expect that when I saw you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Strange {{he should}} {{come back after}} all these years," [...] said Mrs. Kingdom; [...] "though, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>I</b> don't know why he shouldn't. It's his native place, and his father lives here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ("The truth <b>is</b> one ought <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> taught French. Now, I suppose, old Barfoot <b>is</b> talking <b>to</b> my mother. That's an odd affair <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure.</b> But <b>I</b> can't see Bonamy down there. Damn London!") for {{the market}} carts were lumbering down the street.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thet's it--cleaned out!" [...] ejaculated Budd, meanly. [...] "You seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> Kells. An' <b>I</b> guess I'll keep shady of thet game." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Get on {{with your}} pot-boiler, and leave me alone, Allan," [...] I said. [...] "You do not {{understand}} my difficulties in the least. It is {{simply a matter of}} selection. My brain is full of ideas--brimming over. <b>I</b> want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> choosing the best." ...|$|R
6000|$|I shan’t be {{so easily}} catched—I thank him—I want but <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>I</b> [...] should heartily torment him by banishing him, and then {{consider}} [...] whether he should depart this life or not.|$|E
6000|$|Ah, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure.</b> <b>I</b> remember. Bring him in, {{and tell}} the officer [...] to wait outside. [Servant goes out.] Trotter, will you leave us [...] for a few minutes? But be within hail.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's true, Ralph. The day {{is pretty}} far advanced, and I doubt if I can make even one bow before dark. <b>To</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>I</b> might work by firelight {{after the sun}} goes down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You were {{speaking}} about that indigo, Colonel!" [...] here Barnes interposes. [...] "Our house has done {{very little in}} that way, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> but <b>I</b> suppose that our credit is {{about as good as}} Battie's and Jolly's, and if----" [...] but the Colonel is in a brown study.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is a {{place where}} they make Roman scarfs," [...] said Rollo, [...] "and I want to get one for my cousin Lucy. She told me <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> if <b>I</b> came <b>to</b> Rome, to get her a Roman scarf. You can't get them in any other place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But it's plenty big for {{a little}} old maid like me," [...] Miss Cordelia would have told you. [...] "And it's my own--I'm queen there. There's solid comfort in having one spot for your own self. <b>To</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> if <b>I</b> had less land and more house it would be better." ...|$|R
