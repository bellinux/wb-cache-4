5|$|Realizing {{something}} is not right with <b>the</b> <b>dog,</b> Julie takes him to a dog trainer, Carruthers (Burl Ives), who tells her to kill <b>the</b> <b>dog.</b> Another dog trainer named Keys (Paul Winfield), who is black himself, undertakes re-educating <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> as a personal challenge. He dons protective gear and keeps <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> in a large enclosure, taking him out on a chain and exposing himself to <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> each day and making sure {{he is the only}} one to feed or care for <b>the</b> <b>dog.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to Bayliss, <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> {{had been}} given a {{morphine}} injection earlier in the day, then was anaesthetized during the procedure with six fluid ounces of alcohol, chloroform and ether (ACE), delivered from an ante-room to a tube in his trachea, via a pipe hidden behind the bench on which the men were working. The Swedish students disputed that <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> had been adequately anaesthetized. They said <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> had appeared conscious during the procedure, had tried to lift himself off the board, {{and that there was no}} smell of anaesthesia or the usual hissing sound of the apparatus. Other students said <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> had not struggled, but had merely twitched.|$|E
5|$|After {{a lengthy}} time, {{it seems as}} if <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> is cured, in that he is now {{friendly}} towards Keys. Julie confronts the dog's original owner, who has come to claim him, and who presumably trained him to attack black people. She angrily tells him in front of his grandchildren, who only know <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> as a loving family pet, that <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> has been cured by a black man.|$|E

5|$|Just as Julie and Keys {{celebrate}} their victory, <b>the</b> <b>dog,</b> without warning, turns {{its attention to}} Carruthers and brutally attacks him. <b>The</b> <b>dog</b> had not previously shown any aggression towards him--no explanation for this is given, but implications go that the dog's programming has somehow been reversed, though that was never Keys's intention, or that Carruthers has a similarity to the dog's original owner whom <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> hates now.

5|$|A fictionalized memoir set in {{both the}} United States and France during the 1960s American civil rights movement, White Dog focuses on the events that occur after Gary and his then-wife Jean Seberg, an actress and an activist, adopt a {{handsome}} and clearly well-trained German Shepherd dog who comes back to their home with one of their other dogs. At first, <b>the</b> <b>dog,</b> which they name Batka, is an ideal new member of the family: intelligent, devoted, and quickly befriending the couple's assortment of other animals. To their dismay, they discover that <b>the</b> <b>dog,</b> a former Alabama police dog, was trained to attack black people on sight. Although they are told <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> is {{too old to be}} retrained, they take him to a black dog trainer to try. Instead, the man trains <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> to attack white people, including Gary himself. Gary states that he changed the ending of the American version to be more optimistic.|$|E

5|$|A veterinarian, Alfred Sewell, {{said the}} system Bayliss was using was {{unlikely}} to be adequate, but other witnesses, including Frederick Hobday of the Royal Veterinary College, disagreed; {{there was even a}} claim that Bayliss had used too much anaesthesia, which is why <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> had failed to respond to the electrical stimulation. Bayliss said <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> had been suffering from chorea, a disease that causes involuntary spasm, and that any movement Lind af Hageby and Schartau had seen was not purposive.

5000|$|This {{method of}} hunting {{is also used}} for cougar and black bear. <b>The</b> <b>dogs</b> are trained to bay, not {{directly}} attack the quarry; however, it is not unheard of for the quarry to kill some of <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> or for <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> to kill <b>the</b> quarry. Usually the quarry will climb a tree to escape <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> {{after a period of}} chase and harassment. Blackmouth Cur use this method. Traditionally <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> were followed on foot by hunters listening to their barks, although some hunters now use radio direction finding equipment to follow the pack.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} if canine coronavirus (CCV) could be transmitted to pigs, two dogs were inoculated orally with virulent CCV. After 24 h, <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> were moved to an isolation room that contained three three-day-old pigs. A wire mesh fence, allowing close contact between the animals, separated <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> from <b>the</b> pigs. <b>The</b> <b>dogs</b> and pigs were observed for 14 days for clinical signs of disease. Samples of blood were obtained from dogs and pigs immediately before <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> were inoculated with virus and 14 and 28 days later. <b>The</b> <b>dogs</b> developed mild clinical signs of an infection, but the pigs remained normal throughout the observation period. <b>The</b> <b>dogs</b> shed CCV for eight days after exposure. All three pigs developed neutralizing antibodies against CCV and transmissible gastroenteritis virus by 14 days after they were exposed to <b>the</b> <b>dogs...</b>|$|R
5|$|Bayliss's counsel, Rufus Isaacs, called Starling as {{his first}} witness. Starling {{admitted}} that he had broken the law by using <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> twice, but said that he had done so to avoid sacrificing two dogs. Bayliss testified that <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> had been given one-and-a-half grains of morphia earlier in the day, then six ounces of alcohol, chloroform and ether, delivered from an ante room to a tube connected to the dog's trachea. Bayliss said the tubes were fragile, and that had <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> been struggling they would have broken.|$|E
5|$|Coat: The Labrador Retriever's coat {{should be}} short and dense, but not wiry. The coat is water-resistant, so <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> {{does not get}} cold when taking to water in the winter. That means that <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> {{naturally}} has a slightly dry, oily coat. Acceptable colours are black, yellow, and chocolate.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{pages were}} filmed per day, {{six days a}} week, with three shows {{completed}} per week. Shooting in order was not possible. Several barn segments might be filmed {{at a particular time}} with the crew then moving on to film an equal number of kitchen scenes. The shots may have then been used in four or five different episodes. Rettig was allowed to bond with <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> and often groomed <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> at the studio or spent weekends at Weatherwax's home playing with the animal. The bond translated to film, making the boy and dog scenes more believable, but, eventually <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> developed divided loyalties (looking to Rettig for direction rather than Weatherwax) and the trainer was forced to curtail the amount of time boy and dog spent together.|$|E
50|$|Carsten Borchgrevink used sled dogs in Antarctica in 1898, but it {{was much}} colder than {{expected}} at Cape Adare. <b>The</b> <b>dogs</b> were used to working on snow, not on ice, in much milder temperatures. <b>The</b> <b>dogs</b> were also inadequately fed, and eventually all of <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> died.|$|R

25|$|Another serious {{training}} {{mistake was}} revealed later; the Soviets used their own diesel-engine tanks to train <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> rather than German tanks which had gasoline engines.

5|$|Howard Peck, {{an animal}} trainer, brought the eight-month-old collie to Hollywood animal trainer Rudd Weatherwax {{in order to}} break the animal of {{uncontrolled}} barking and a habit of chasing motorcycles. After working with <b>the</b> <b>dog,</b> Weatherwax gained control of the barking {{but was unable to}} break Pal of his motorcycle-chasing habit. Peck was disappointed with the results and gave <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> to Weatherwax in exchange for the money Peck owed him. Weatherwax, in turn, gave <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> to a friend, but when he learned that Eric Knight's 1940 novel, Lassie Come-Home, was being considered as a feature film by MGM, Weatherwax sensed Pal was <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> to fill the role, and bought Pal back from his friend for $10.00 USD. Peck later tried to reclaim him after he became famous as Lassie, but Weatherwax's legal ownership was upheld. Rudd's brother Frank Weatherwax, who trained dogs for such films as The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T and The Wizard of Oz, assisted Rudd in training Pal.|$|E
5|$|In Katherine Buetow's {{guide to}} the Australian Cattle Dog, Ian Dunbar {{makes the point that}} while people think of dog {{training}} as teaching a dog to sit, speak and roll over, <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> already knows how to do these things. Training, he says, involves teaching <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> that {{it is a good idea}} to do these things when a particular word is said or signal is given. He goes on to explain his belief that training is about opening communication channels, so that <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> knows what the handler wants it to do, and knows that it will be worth its while to do it. Consequences for <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> can be rewards for doing what is required, as recommended by Dunbar, or corrections where an unwanted behaviour is performed. Like other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is intelligent and responsive; both of these traits can be an advantage in training where a structured, varied program is used, but can lead to unwanted outcomes if training is not consistent, or is repetitive and boring for <b>the</b> <b>dog.</b> Stock dog trainer Scott Lithgow recommends making training a game so the Cattle Dog learns that obedience leads to enjoyment. Many of a Cattle Dog's natural behaviours are undesirable in a pet: barking, chewing, chasing, digging, defending territory, and nipping heels. Training, therefore, involves helping <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> adopt a lifestyle that is probably very different from that of its droving ancestors. The Australian Cattle Dog is biddable, and responds well to training.|$|E
5|$|In linking these shots together, Hepworth {{attempted}} {{to avoid the}} confusion of earlier multi-shot films such as Edwin S. Porter's The Great Train Robbery (1903). Three shots are used {{to set up the}} plot, that of the baby being stolen by a beggar woman. Nearly all of the following shots show Rover tracking down the child. When <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> returns home, the shots' settings are repeated in reverse as <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> travels them; they are shown again in the original order, for a third time, when <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> brings the father. A fourth repetition is, rather radically for its time, spared by showing the kidnapper's return to her room followed by a shot of the reunited family.|$|E

5|$|Many {{carnivorous}} marine gastropods {{are known}} predators of L.canarium, including the volutes Cymbiola nobilis and Melo melo and the cone snail (Conus textile). <b>The</b> <b>dog</b> conch is also preyed upon by vertebrates.

5|$|Outside {{the lecture}} room before the {{students}} arrived, according to testimony Starling and others gave in court, Starling cut <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> open again {{to inspect the}} results of the previous surgery, which took about 45 minutes, after which he clamped the wound with forceps and handed <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> over to Bayliss. Bayliss cut a new opening in the dog's neck to expose the lingual nerves of the salivary glands, to which he attached electrodes. The aim was to stimulate the nerves with electricity to demonstrate that salivary pressure was independent of blood pressure. <b>The</b> <b>dog</b> was then carried to the lecture theatre, stretched on his back on an operating board, with his legs tied to the board, his head clamped and his mouth muzzled.|$|E
