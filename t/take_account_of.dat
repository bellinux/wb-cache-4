5|$|Tax codes were amended in July 2011 {{under the}} Finance (No. 3) Act to <b>take</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> civil partnership. The Act, in the main, is {{retrospective}} to 1 January 2011 and it creates virtual parity, in taxation matters, between civil partners {{on the one}} hand and married people on the other hand. The Social Welfare Code had already been amended in December 2010 to <b>take</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> civil partnership.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the calculation of association, {{it is common to}} take into account any variables that could potentially confound the results. Sex and age are common examples of confounding variables. Moreover, it is also known that many genetic variations are associated with the geographical and historical populations in which the mutations first arose. Because of this association, studies must <b>take</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> the geographical and ethnical background of participants by controlling for what is called population stratification.|$|E
5|$|Palmer {{begins by}} {{defending}} {{the claim that}} animals have moral standing, and then surveys three key approaches to animal ethics; utilitarian approaches, animal rights approaches, and capabilities approaches. All are lacking, she argues, as they are fundamentally capacity-oriented, and thus unable to properly <b>take</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> human relationships to animals. However, her approach leans more strongly towards a Regan-inspired rights view. She next identifies different kinds of relations humans may have with animals: affective, contractual and, most significantly, causal.|$|E

5|$|The debate, again {{including}} {{contributions from}} Justice Minister Michael McDowell, {{took place in}} February 2007. All speakers supported civil unions for same-sex couples and complimented Deputy Howlin on the bill. One expressed reservations about adoption. Minister McDowell claimed that the bill violated the constitutional provisions on marriage and the family. Government speakers said that civil unions needed to be introduced but that more time was needed to <b>take</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> the ongoing Supreme Court case and investigation work in the Department of Justice.|$|E
5|$|Evaluating Mountfort's works today, one has {{to avoid}} judging them against a {{background}} of similar designs in Europe. In the 1860s, New Zealand was a developing country, where materials and resources freely available in Europe were conspicuous by their absence. When available they were often of inferior quality, as Mountfort discovered with the unseasoned wood in his first disastrous project. His first buildings in his new homeland were often too tall, or steeply pitched, failing to <b>take</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> the non-European climate and landscape. However, he soon adapted, and developed his skill in working with crude and unrefined materials.|$|E
5|$|In England, {{tuition fee}} caps rose with the Higher Education Act 2004. Under the Act, {{universities}} in England {{could begin to}} charge variable fees of up to £3000 a year for students enrolling on courses as from the academic year of 2006-07 or later. This was also introduced in Northern Ireland in 2006-07 and introduced in Wales in 2007-08. In 2009-10 the cap rose to £3225 a year to <b>take</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> inflation. Following the Browne Review in 2010, the cap was controversially raised to £9,000 a year, sparking large student protests in London.|$|E

5|$|Packer {{estimates}} {{more than}} 200 Tanzanians are killed {{each year by}} lions, crocodiles, elephants, hippos, and snakes, and that the numbers could be double that amount, with lions thought to kill at least 70 of those. Packer has documented that between 1990 and 2004, lions attacked 815 people in Tanzania, killing 563. Packer and Ikanda are among the few conservationists who believe western conservation efforts must <b>take</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> these matters {{not just because of}} ethical concerns about human life, but also for the long term success of conservation efforts and lion preservation.|$|E
5|$|Since divers on {{the surface}} after a dive still have excess inert gas in their bodies, any {{subsequent}} dive before this excess is fully eliminated needs to modify the schedule to <b>take</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> the residual gas load from the previous dive. This {{will result in a}} shorter available time under water or an increased decompression time during the subsequent dive. The total elimination of excess gas may take many hours, and tables will indicate the time at normal pressures that is required, which may be up to 18 hours.|$|E
5|$|In the 2015 Tour of Qatar, three {{different}} jerseys were awarded. The {{first of these}} was the general classification. It was calculated by adding together the times recorded in each stage of the race, then making adjustments to <b>take</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> bonus seconds won for stage victories and intermediate sprints in the road stages (the winner of the individual time trial did not receive bonus seconds). The winner of each stage received a ten-second bonus; the rider coming second received a six-second bonus; the third rider across the line received a four-second bonus. Similarly, the winner, second-placed and third-placed riders in intermediate sprints won three-, two- and one-second bonuses respectively. If two riders were tied on the same time, the precise time (to one-hundredths of a second) recorded in the time trial would {{have been used to}} separate the riders. The leader of the general classification wore a gold jersey and the winner of the competition is considered the overall winner of the race.|$|E

5|$|It {{was clear}} from the {{beginning}} of the CryoSat programme that an extensive series of measurements would be needed, both to understand interaction of the radar waves with the surface of the ice caps and to relate the measured freeboard of floating sea ice with its thickness. This latter, in particular, would have to <b>take</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> snow loading. For sea ice, which moves as it is blown by the wind, it was also necessary to develop techniques which could give consistent results when measured from platforms travelling at different speed (scientists on the surface, helicopter-towed sounders, aircraft-borne radars and CryoSat itself). A number of campaigns were performed under a programme called CRYOVEX which aimed to address each of the identified areas of uncertainty. These campaigns continued through the development of the original CryoSat and were planned to continue after its launch.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the ship date back to 4 March 2005, in a {{proposal}} drafted by then-Minister of Justice and Ecclesiastical Affairs (which is now a nonexistent entity), Björn Bjarnason, regarding {{the purchase of a}} new vessel, in order to replace the aging ICGV Óðinn, and aircraft for the Icelandic Coast Guard. The Althing decided that this was an exigent matter, and so a high priority was placed upon the proposal. A needs analysis pertaining to the acquisition of a multi-purpose vessel and aircraft for the ICG was initiated on 31 September 2005. The main demands were that the vessel should be designed for rescue work and patrolling, pollution prevention, fuelling search and rescue helicopters in flight, and meeting civil defence requirements anywhere around the country. In addition, it was to be equipped for response to, and prevention of, terrorist threats and be suitable for operations involving the police or customs authorities, and for all types of rescue and salvage work. The bollard pull of the vessel was to <b>take</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> the greatly increased volume of passenger and cargo shipping in Iceland’s economic zone and coastal waters.|$|E
