5|$|Revanta was worshipped as {{guardian}} deity {{of warriors}} and horses, protector from {{the dangers of}} forests and the patron god of hunting. The worship of Revanta is closely associated with Saura, cult of Surya. Often, scriptures like Vishnudharmottara Purana and Kalika Purana recommend worship of Revanta alongside Surya or according to <b>the</b> <b>rituals</b> <b>of</b> Sun worship. Shabha-kalpa-druma records Revanta's worship after Surya's, in the Hindu month of Ashvin by warriors. Nakula, the fourth Pandava, {{is believed to have}} written Ashavashastram on horses. He suggests worship of Raivata to protect horses from ghosts.|$|E

5|$|The Lingbao School (Simplified Chinese: 灵宝派; Traditional Chinese: 靈寶派; pinyin: Líng Bǎo Pài), {{also known}} as the School of the Sacred Jewel or the School of Numinous Treasure, was an {{important}} Daoist school that emerged in China in between the Jin Dynasty and the Liu Song Dynasty in the early fifth century CE. It lasted for about two hundred years until it was absorbed into the Shangqing and Zhengyi currents during the Tang Dynasty. The Lingbao School is a synthesis of religious ideas based on Shangqing texts, <b>the</b> <b>rituals</b> <b>of</b> the Celestial Masters, and Buddhist practices.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} an ethnographic {{report on the}} {{childbirth}} and child-rearing rituals in Uygur Xinjiang China and also includes an analysis of that transformation from a view point of the sociology of knowlege. The childbirth and child-rearing rituals in Uygur culture usually consist <b>of</b> four rituals: <b>the</b> <b>ritual</b> <b>of</b> birth, <b>the</b> <b>ritual</b> <b>of</b> naming, <b>the</b> <b>ritual</b> <b>of</b> cradle, and <b>the</b> <b>ritual</b> <b>of</b> circumcision for boys. <b>The</b> <b>ritual</b> <b>of</b> birth has its origin in traditional folk belief and is disappearing in cities. <b>The</b> <b>ritual</b> <b>of</b> giving children a name has its origin in Islamic doctrine and is held on 7 th day after birth. <b>The</b> <b>ritual</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cradle is held on 40 th day after birth. People put the baby into a new cradle and pray his healthy developing. <b>The</b> <b>ritual</b> <b>of</b> circumcision for boys is very important Islamic ritual in which 6 or 7 years old boys have a small operation in their genital as Muslim symbol. The findings of this field-research is that {{the system of the}} recipe knowledge, i. e. what peple must know to act competently (in accord with expected standards) in routine situations of everyday life, in terms of the holding and performing <b>of</b> these <b>rituals</b> is appears to be changing under the process of modernization and developing of a market economy in China. Those observations bring us to the second point which is that those rituals are changing in its recipe knowledge but are maintained in paractice, especially in Islamic-rooted rituals...|$|R

5|$|At this point, Grant began {{describing}} {{himself as}} the O.H.O. (Outer Head of the Order) of the O.T.O., claiming that he deserved this title not by direct succession from Crowley but because he displayed the inspiration and innovation that Germer lacked. A document purportedly by Crowley naming Grant as his successor was subsequently exposed as a hoax created by Robert Taylor, a Typhonian O.T.O. member. In the early 1970s he established his own Thelemic organisation, the Typhonian O.T.O., which produced its first official announcement in 1973. Although adopting the O.T.O. degree system used by Crowley, Grant removed <b>the</b> <b>rituals</b> <b>of</b> initiation designed to allow a member to enter a higher degree; instead he personally promoted them through the degrees according to what he believed were their own personal spiritual development.|$|E
5|$|Even {{in ancient}} times these {{similarities}} were controversial. Non-Christians in the Roman Empire in the early centuries CE thought Christianity and the mystery cults resembled each other. Reacting to these claims by outsiders, early Christian apologists denied that these cults had influenced their religion. The 17th-century Protestant scholar Isaac Casaubon brought up the question again by accusing the Catholic Church of deriving its sacraments from <b>the</b> <b>rituals</b> <b>of</b> the mystery cults. Charles-François Dupuis, in the late 18th century, went further by claiming that all Christianity originated in the mystery cults. Intensified by religious disputes between Protestants, Catholics, and non-Christians, the controversy has continued to the present day.|$|E

5|$|Fearing the {{approaching}} Jin army, Song emperor Huizong planned to retreat south. The emperor deserting the capital {{would have been}} viewed {{as an act of}} capitulation, so court officials convinced him to abdicate. There were few objections. Rescuing an empire in crisis from destruction was more important than preserving <b>the</b> <b>rituals</b> <b>of</b> imperial inheritance. In January 1126, {{a few days before the}} New Year, Huizong abdicated in favor of his son and was demoted to the ceremonial role of Retired Emperor. The Jurchen forces reached the Yellow River on January 27, 1126, two days after the New Year. Huizong fled Kaifeng the next day, escaping south and leaving the newly enthroned emperor Qinzong (r. 1126–1127) in charge of the capital.|$|E
5|$|The Kwan Um School of Zen {{was founded}} in 1983 and, unlike more {{traditional}} practice in Korea, Seungsahn allowed laypersons in the lineage to wear the robes of full monastics. Celibacy was not required and <b>the</b> <b>rituals</b> <b>of</b> the school are unique. Although the Kwan Um School does utilize traditional Seon and Zen rituals, elements of their practice also closely resemble rituals found often in Pure Land Buddhism, Chan Buddhism, and the Huayan school. In 1986, along with a former student and Dharma heir Dae Gak, Seungsahn founded a retreat center and temple in Clay City, Kentucky called Furnace Mountain—the temple name being Kwan Se Um San Ji Sah (or, Perceive World Sound High Ground Temple). The center functions independently of the Kwan Um organization today.|$|E
5|$|Spotted hyenas feature {{prominently}} in <b>the</b> <b>rituals</b> <b>of</b> certain African cultures. In the Gelede {{cult of the}} Yoruba people of Benin and Southwest Nigeria, a spotted hyena mask is used at dawn to signal {{the end of the}} èfè ceremony. As the spotted hyena usually finishes the meals of other carnivores, the animal is associated with the conclusion of all things. Among the Korè cult of the Bambara people in Mali, the belief that spotted hyenas are hermaphrodites appears as an ideal in-between in the ritual domain. The role of the spotted hyena mask in their rituals is often to turn the neophyte into a complete moral being by integrating his male principles with femininity. The Beng people believe that upon finding a freshly killed hyena with its anus inverted, one must plug it back in, for fear of being struck down with perpetual laughter. They also view spotted hyena faeces as contaminating, and will evacuate a village if a hyena relieves itself within village boundaries. In Harar, Ethiopia, spotted hyenas are regularly fed by the city's inhabitants, who believe the hyenas' presence keeps devils at bay, and associate mystical properties such as fortune telling to them.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} Turkish theatre dates back {{thousands}} of years to ancient pagan rituals. The dances, music and songs performed during <b>the</b> <b>rituals</b> <b>of</b> the inhabitants of Anatolia millennia ago are the elements from which the first shows originated. These rituals later became theatrical shows. In the 10th century, a blend of traditions occurred between the Seljuk Turks {{and those of the}} inhabitants of Anatolia. The interaction between the various tribal societies paved the way for new plays. After the Tanzimat (Reformation) period, characters in Turkish theatre were modernized and plays were performed on European-style stages with the actors wearing European costumes. Following the declaration of the second Constitutional Monarchy in 1908, theatrical activities increased and social problems began to be reflected in the theatre as well as in historical plays. A theatrical conservatoire, Darülbedayi-i Osmani, was established in Istanbul in 1914. During the years of chaos and war, the Darülbedayi-i Osmani continued its activities and attracted the younger generation. Turkish playwrights emerged. Some wrote on romantic subjects, others were interested in social problems and still others dealt with nationalistic themes. There were even those who wrote musicals. In time, Turkish ladies began to appear on stage and this was indeed a revolution of the time, since female roles had only been played by actresses who were members of Turkey’s ethnic minorities. Today, theatre acts are performed by numerous private theatre companies and subsidized companies such as the Turkish State Theatres.|$|E

60|$|Now, poets in our epoch {{will tend}} towards ecclesiastical {{religion}} strictly {{because it is}} just a little more free than anything else. Take, for instance, the case of symbol and ritualism. All reasonable men believe in symbol; but some reasonable men do not believe in ritualism; by which they mean, I imagine, a symbolism too complex, elaborate, and mechanical. But whenever they talk of ritualism they always seem to mean the ritualism of the Church. Why should they not mean <b>the</b> <b>ritual</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world? It is much more ritualistic. <b>The</b> <b>ritual</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Army, <b>the</b> <b>ritual</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Navy, <b>the</b> <b>ritual</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Law Courts, <b>the</b> <b>ritual</b> <b>of</b> Parliament are much more ritualistic. <b>The</b> <b>ritual</b> <b>of</b> a dinner-party is much more ritualistic. Priests may put gold and great jewels on the chalice; but at least there is only one chalice to put them on. When you go to a dinner-party they put in front of you five different chalices, of five weird and heraldic shapes, to symbolise five different kinds of wine; an insane extension <b>of</b> <b>ritual</b> from which Mr. Percy Dearmer would fly shrieking. A bishop wears a mitre; but he is not thought more or less of a bishop according to whether you can see the very latest curves in his mitre. But a swell is thought more or less of a swell according to whether you can see the very latest curves in his hat. There is more fuss about symbols in the world than in the Church.|$|R
