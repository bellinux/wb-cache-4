The paper applies an unconditional general equilibrium trade model consistent with the Ricardian and heterogeneous firms’ models of trade to estimate a trade cost equation to obtain the <b>tariff</b> <b>equivalent</b> trade cost measure for ECOWAS countries.

We find that over the period 1980 - 2003, the cost of trading within SSA was the highest, compared to other regional groups, at an average <b>tariff</b> <b>equivalent</b> of 271. 5 percent. On average ECOWAS countries traded with their trading partners at a <b>tariff</b> <b>equivalent</b> trade cost of 268. 2 percent, higher than countries from other regional blocs within and out of SSA. With regards to trade flow involving ECOWAS countries, estimates of <b>tariff</b> <b>equivalent</b> trade costs indicates that on average ECOWAS countries traded among each other at a lower cost than with other trading partners from economic blocs out of ECOWAS.

For {{the purpose of this}} study, data on trade costs have been collected for all of China and the 12 member countries of the TPP region. And then a 10 % reduction is applied to the trade costs for goods reaching and leaving the developing countries of the TPP region. To use a CGE modeling framework, the time costs of trade which are typically measured and recorded in days have to be converted into cost units in dollars. To do this, the study uses data by Hummels et al. (2007) on ad valorem <b>tariff</b> <b>equivalents</b> for the cost of 1 day in trade for the 12 TPP countries and the China. Following Hummels et al.’s (2007) methodology, the <b>tariff</b> <b>equivalents</b> of trade delays considered in this study counted time in three stages: inland transport, customs processing and port handling. These values are then trade weighted using the bilateral trade data between the TPP countries as reported in GTAP database 9 (as updated earlier as part of the study).

40|$|The paper investigates {{one aspect}} of the {{external}} trade impact of the 1992 `Internal Market' programme, that is, VERs on third countries. The paper rejects the frequently-made claim that the proposed abolition in 1992 of Article 115 of the Treaty of Rome (which prevents free intra-EC circulation of third country goods) will have a liberalizing effect. This is a general point. In particular, the paper analyses changes over time in the restrictiveness of existing VERs on Hong Kong clothing, focusing on the VERs' impact on import <b>tariff</b> <b>equivalents,</b> rents transferred and intra-EC price dispersion. The paper reports estimates of the relationship between home-country income growth, exporting-country supply conditions and the import <b>tariff</b> <b>equivalents</b> of VERs. This estimated relationship is used to forecast the increased restrictiveness of VERs caused by the `internal market's' tendency to boost import demand.

These equivalents are used extensively to compute welfare gains and resource reallocations associated with partial liberalization of the sector; any measurement errors will strongly affect the estimated gains. Using the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) database, we rely on socalled quantity based methods to derive <b>tariff</b> <b>equivalents</b> from a gravity equation estimated at sectoral level for 9 services sectors and 65 countries. We also estimate trade equations for services using cross section data, and improve on the methodology of Park (2002).

40|$|State {{trading is}} a common feature in the {{management}} of imports and exports of agricultural products and it has been a long-standing feature of China's agricultural trade regime. While the use of state trading was modified by China's accession to the WTO, it remains a dominant feature for some commodities, even though there have been recent attempts to diminish its importance. In this article, we review the role that the state trading enterprise (STE), China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import and Export Company (COFCO), continues to play in the importing and exporting of some agricultural commodities. We then review the economic theory that has been developed to measure the <b>tariff</b> <b>equivalent</b> of importing STEs. Finally, we apply that theory through a calibration exercise to measure the <b>tariff</b> <b>equivalent</b> of COFCO in China's import market for wheat. The distortionary impact of COFCO depends on the bias in government policy toward agriculture, the competitiveness of the domestic procurement market, and also the number of firms that are allocated licenses to import alongside COFCO.

40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the impact of}} laser land leveling technology in rice-wheat (RW) systems of north-west India using data collected from household surveys in 2011. We compared crop yield and total irrigation time required per season between laser leveled (LLL) and traditionally leveled (TLL) fields. Laser leveling in rice fields reduced irrigation time by 47 – 69 h/ha/season and improved yield by approximately 7 % compared with traditionally leveled fields. In wheat, irrigation time was reduced by 10 – 12 h/ha/season and yield increased by 7 – 9 % in laser leveled fields. Our analysis showed that laser land leveling is a scale neutral technology, not biased towards large farmers. Farmers benefited by an additional USD 143. 5 /ha/year through increased yields in RW systems and reduced electricity used in laser leveled fields compared to traditionally leveled fields when estimated by using the electricity <b>tariff</b> <b>equivalent</b> to the average subsidized tariff for agricultural use. This benefit became much larger when estimated by using an electricity <b>tariff</b> <b>equivalent</b> to {{the average cost of}} its supply. Hence, assuming an average electricity <b>tariff</b> <b>equivalent</b> to the average cost of its supply in the year 2010 – 11 in the country, the net benefit of shifting from TLL to LLL in RW systems in the study area was USD 194 per ha per year. This large difference in benefits indicates the loss due to market distortions by subsidy in electricity and hence, is a matter of policy concern requiring further scrutiny. The RW system in a hectare of laser leveled field required 754 kWh less electricity for irrigation per year compared to a traditionally leveled field. Furthermore, if 50 % of the area under the RW system in Haryana and Punjab states were laser leveled, this would provide an additional production of 699 million kg of rice and 987 million kg of wheat, amounting to USD 385 million/year. Thus, laser leveling contributes to food security and economical use of water and energy resources...|$|E
