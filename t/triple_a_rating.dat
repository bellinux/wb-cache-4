25|$|In {{the final}} quarter of 2008, {{as a result of}} the Great Recession, the UK economy officially entered {{recession}} for the first time since 1991. Unemployment increased from 5.2% in May 2008 to 7.6% in May 2009 and by January 2012 the unemployment rate among 18- to 24-year-olds had risen from 11.9% to 22.5%, the highest since current records began in 1992, although it had fallen to 14.2% by November 2015. Total UK government debt rose quickly from 44.4% of GDP in 2007 to 82.9% of GDP in 2011, then increased more slowly to 87.5% of GDP in 2015. Following the likes of the United States, France and many major economies, in February 2013, the UK lost its top AAA credit rating for the first time since 1978 with Moodys and Fitch credit agency while, unlike the other major economies retained their <b>triple</b> <b>A</b> <b>rating</b> with the largest agency Standard & Poor's. However, by the end of 2014, UK growth was the fastest in both the G7 and in Europe, and by September 2015, the unemployment rate was down to a seven-year low of 5.3%.|$|E

Secondly, as Chair of the government's Budget sub-committee, Rees announced there would be a mini-budget which was delivered in November 2008. The mini-budget delayed a number of large scale capital works projects with long lead times and instead emphasised capital expenditure on smaller projects which could generate employment more quickly. Third, Rees drew industry and business leaders together to conduct a job summit. This summit was co-chaired by Roger Corbett, Steve Harkins and David Gonski. In addition to the Work Plan developed by the summit, Rees also announced the establishment of 4,000 government apprenticeships across the state and 2,000 cadetships.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Distributed RDF data {{management}} systems {{become increasingly important}} {{with the growth of}} the Semantic Web. Regardless, current methods meet performance bottlenecks either on data loading or querying when processing large amounts of data. In this work, we propose efficient methods for processing RDF using dynamic data re-partitioning to enable rapid analysis of large datasets. Our approach adopts a two-tier index architecture on each computation node: (1) a lightweight primary index, to keep loading times low, and (2) a series of dynamic, multi-level secondary indexes, calculated as a by-product of query execution, to decrease or remove inter-machine data movement for subsequent queries that contain the same graph patterns. In addition, we propose methods to replace some secondary indexes with distributed filters, so as to decrease memory consumption. Experimental results on a commodity cluster with 16 nodes show that the method presents good scale-out characteristics and can indeed vastly improve loading speeds while remaining competitive in terms of performance. Specifically, our approach can load a dataset of 1. 1 billion <b>triples</b> at <b>a</b> <b>rate</b> of 2. 48 million triples per second and provide competitive performance to RDF- 3 X and 4 store for expensive queries.

40|$|In the {{following}} we will describe systematically and formally {{the most important}} problems related to recommender systems and give some references to actual solutions. Our focus here is to describe the general recommender systems setting {{as a base for}} social recommender systems. See [11, 3] for a more general introduction to recommender systems and a more thorough overview of the state-of-the-art, respectively. 2. 1 Rating and Item Prediction The two most basic recommendation problems are rating prediction and item prediction. In rating prediction, there are users that rate items (e. g., movies, books, electronic devices, articles, resources in the terminology of social systems etc.) explicitely on some scale, say with the numbers 1 to 5, where 1 denotes the least preferred item and 5 the most preferred one. Given such ratings we would like to predict ratings of users for items they did not rate yet. In the most basic scenario, users and items are treated as entities about which nothing else is known, i. e., as IDs or nominal levels. Formally, there are given • a set U of users, • a set I of items, • a set R⊆R of ratings, e. g., R: = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }, • a set Dtrain ⊆ U × I ×Rof (user, item, <b>rating)</b> <b>triples,</b> • <b>a</b> (<b>rating)</b> loss function ℓ: R×R → R where ℓ(r, ˆr) quantifies how bad it is to predict rating ˆr if the actual <b>rating</b> is r. <b>A</b> typical choice for the loss is absolute error or squared error...|$|R
