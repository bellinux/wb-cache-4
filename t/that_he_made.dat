5|$|Although Squidward, {{annoyed with}} SpongeBob's fear at the story, manages to {{convince}} him <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> the whole story up, the two are soon alarmed by strange occurrences that parallel the omens that signify {{the arrival of the}} Hash-Slinging Slasher later that night when the restaurant is empty. Although convinced at first that these occurrences are coincidence, Squidward grows more nervous as the occurrences continue.|$|E

5|$|In a {{draft in}} which they had four first-round selections, the Colorado Avalanche made Tanguay their first pick, 12th overall, at the 1998 NHL Entry Draft. He was invited to Colorado's {{training}} camp that fall, and impressed the team such <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> the team as an 18-year-old. Tanguay and the Avalanche, however, were unable to come to terms on a contract and he was instead returned to Halifax for the 1998–99 season.|$|E
5|$|It {{was while}} Roger was Theobald's clerk <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> lasting friendships with Gilbert Foliot and Hugh de Puiset. Roger {{attended}} the Council of Reims in 1148 with Theobald, John of Salisbury, and possibly Thomas Becket. This council condemned some of Gilbert de la Porrée's teachings, and consecrated Foliot as Bishop of Hereford. While {{it was later}} recalled that Roger and Becket did not get along, {{there is no evidence}} of hatred between the two before the Becket crisis happened.|$|E
5|$|Stephen's {{relationship}} with Béla IV deteriorated {{in the early}} 1260s. Stephen's charters reveal his fear of being disinherited and expelled by his father. He also accused some unnamed barons of inciting the old monarch against him. On the other hand, Stephen's charters prove <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> land grants in Bihar, Szatmár, Ugocsa, and other counties which were situated outside Transylvania.|$|E

5|$|The breach between Antony and Octavian {{prompted}} {{a large portion}} of the Senators, as well as both of that year's consuls, to leave Rome and defect to Antony. However, Octavian received two key deserters from Antony in the autumn of 32BC: Munatius Plancus and Marcus Titius. These defectors gave Octavian the information that he needed to confirm with the Senate all the accusations <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> against Antony.|$|E
5|$|While the wrestler {{who would}} later become known as Diamante Azul has never {{revealed}} his birth name, he did unveil that he was born on December 20, 1982. Lucha libre has a long held tradition of not revealing the birth name of masked wrestlers unless they are later unmasked. Due to the secretive nature of lucha libre it is possible <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> his wrestling debut prior to 2007 under a masked or unmasked identity {{that has not been}} revealed yet.|$|E
5|$|Çakır was scrutinised by the British {{media in}} 2013 {{when he sent}} off Manchester United's Nani in a Champions League quarter-final and the English team went on to lose to Real Madrid.

5|$|After some {{discussion}} he was persuaded to disembark {{so that the}} Helmuth could continue operations. Leaving demolition parties aboard the cargo vessels, Ritchie then took the Helmuth further downriver to check for other shipping, but the small ship grounded on a sandbar. Assuming the route was blocked, {{he returned to the}} two cargo ships on one of the expedition's small launches. It was at this stage, whilst conducting a final inspection, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> the discovery {{of a large number of}} empty ammunition cases and discarded bullets in the holds of the cargo ships. Deducing that the German crew had armed themselves before they left their vessels, he suspected preparations were underway to ambush his force when it attempted to leave the harbour.|$|E
5|$|Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{are called}} to the Excelsis Dei private nursing home in Worcester, Massachusetts in order to {{investigate}} a nurse's claim that she was raped by an invisible entity. Severely bruised, Michelle Charters (Teryl Rothery) claims that she knows who was responsible and names the attacker as Hal Arden, an elderly resident of Excelsis Dei. When questioned, Arden admits <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> sexual overtures to her, but claims that it was harmless {{and that he is}} too elderly to have done anything.|$|E
5|$|Baldwin II was {{captured}} in 1123, and the burghers of Antioch sent envoys to Bohemond, urging {{him to come to}} his principality. Bohemond reached the age of majority at the age of 16. According to William of Tyre, he made an agreement with William II, Duke of Apulia, stipulating that the one who first died without issue was to will his principality to the other; however, the reliability of William's report is suspect. Alexander of Telese recorded that before leaving for Syria, Bohemond entrusted his Italian domains to the Holy See, but Romuald of Salerno said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> Alexander, Count of Conversano, the overseer of those lands. Bohemond sailed from Otranto with a fleet of twenty-four ships in September 1126.|$|E

5|$|Born to {{a working-class}} Italian American family in Dudley, Massachusetts, {{he was raised}} Roman Catholic {{although}} became interested in esotericism as a teenager. He later claimed {{that when he was}} 21, relatives initiated him into a tradition of witchcraft inherited from their Sicilian ancestors; this conflicts with other statements <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>made,</b> and there is no independent evidence to corroborate his claim. During the 1950s, he was based in New York City, where he worked as a graphologist and hypnotist. After beginning to publish books on paranormal topics in the early 1960s, he publicly began identifying as Wiccan in 1969, and stated that he was involved in a New York coven.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{considered}} Ankylosaurus so distinct <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> it {{the type}} genus {{of a new}} family, Ankylosauridae (members of which are called ankylosaurids), typified by massive, triangular skulls, short necks, stiff backs, broad bodies, and osteoderms. He also classified Palaeoscincus (only known from teeth), and Euoplocephalus (then only known from a partial skull and osteoderms) {{as part of the}} family. Due to the fragmentary remains, Brown was unable to fully distinguish between Euoplocephalus and Ankylosaurus. Only having few, incomplete members of the family to compare with, he believed the group was part of the suborder Stegosauria. In 1923, Osborn coined the name Ankylosauria (members of which are called ankylosaurs or ankylosaurians), thereby placing the ankylosaurids in their own suborder.|$|E
5|$|Chu {{made his}} debut as a {{contestant}} on the January 28, 2014, episode of Jeopardy!, winning $37,200 {{in his first}} game. On the January 29 episode, Chu made a Final Jeopardy! wager that caused him to tie fellow contestant Carolyn Collins. Chu claimed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> the decision to wager for a tie not out of kindness {{but because of the}} advice of 2003 College champion Keith Williams, who claims that game theory favors wagering for a tie over the more common practice of wagering to win by a dollar. Chu defeated Collins on the January 30 episode.|$|E

5|$|Egyptologist and {{archaeology}} pioneer Sir Flinders Petrie {{surveyed the}} Giant, probably during the First World War, and published his {{results in a}} Royal Anthropological Institute paper in 1926. Petrie says <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> 220 measurements, and records slight grooves across the neck, and from the shoulders down to the armpits. He also notes a row of pits suggesting {{the place of the}} spine. He concludes that the Giant {{is very different from the}} Long Man of Wilmington, and that minor grooves may have been added from having been repeatedly cleaned.|$|E
5|$|Ishikawa {{grew up in}} Washington State. He {{was drafted}} in the 21st round of the 2002 Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft by the San Francisco Giants out of high school. He made his Major League debut with the Giants in 2006, {{but it was not}} until 2009 <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> it to the major leagues full-time. He started 2009 as the Giants' first baseman but failed to produce offensively and was {{replaced}} part of the season by Ryan Garko. However, on defense he was third in the National League (NL) in fielding percentage. In 2010, he served as a pinch-hitter and defensive replacement for the Giants and won a World Series ring as the Giants won the 2010 World Series. Ishikawa was designated for assignment at the end of spring training in 2011 and spent the entire season in the minor leagues.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the root of the quarrel between Cnut and Malcolm lies in Cnut's pilgrimage to Rome, and the coronation of Holy Roman Emperor Conrad II, where Cnut and Rudolph III, King of Burgundy had the place of honour. If Malcolm were present, and the repeated mentions of his piety in the annals make it quite possible <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> a pilgrimage to Rome, as did Mac Bethad mac Findláich ("Macbeth") in later times, then the coronation would have allowed Malcolm to publicly snub Cnut's claims to overlordship.|$|E
