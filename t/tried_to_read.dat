25|$|Some materialists among modern {{historians have}} <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> {{a form of}} class {{struggle}} into Sverre and the Birkebeiner's fight against Erling and Magnus. However, {{the extent to which}} Sverre's men actually represented the impoverished strata of the population remains disputed. It is clear that most of the lendmenn—the nobility of the time—sided with King Magnus, but Sverre also quickly won several of them over to his side. In any event, the Birkebeiner did not try to change the social order of society; they merely wanted to place themselves at its top.|$|E
25|$|Frank Herbert {{used his}} science fiction novels to explore complex ideas {{involving}} philosophy, religion, psychology, politics and ecology. The underlying thrust {{of his work}} was a fascination {{with the question of}} human survival and evolution. Herbert has attracted a sometimes fanatical fan base, many of whom have <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> everything he wrote, fiction or non-fiction, and see Herbert as something of an authority on the subject matters of his books. Indeed, such was the devotion of some of his readers that Herbert was at times asked if he was founding a cult, something he was very much against.|$|E

500|$|Balzac's use of {{recurring}} characters provides unparalleled {{depth and}} characterization for his readers. [...] "This technique", insists critic Mary Susan McCarthy, [...] "not only furnished {{him with a}} unifying principle but also offers the reader a network of relationships through which to unite the many separate stories and novels in which the characters appear, forming the fictional universe that is La Comédie humaine." [...] Some readers, however, are intimidated by the depth created by these interdependent stories, and feel deprived of important context for the characters. Detective novelist Arthur Conan Doyle said that he never <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> Balzac, because he [...] "did not know where to begin".|$|E
500|$|Balzac {{experimented with}} this method {{throughout}} the thirty years {{he worked on}} La Comédie humaine. It enabled a depth of characterization that went beyond simple narration or dialogue. [...] "When the characters reappear", notes the critic Samuel Rogers, [...] "they do not step out of nowhere; they emerge from {{the privacy of their}} own lives which, for an interval, we have not been allowed to see." [...] Although the complexity of these characters' lives inevitably led Balzac to make errors of chronology and consistency, the mistakes are considered minor in the overall scope of the project. Readers are more often troubled by the sheer number of people in Balzac's world, and feel deprived of important context for the characters. Detective novelist Arthur Conan Doyle said that he never <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> Balzac, because he [...] "did not know where to begin".|$|E
500|$|Willkie {{formally}} {{accepted the}} nomination at Elwood on August 17 before {{a crowd of}} at least 150,000, the largest political gathering in U.S. history to that point. It was an extremely hot day, and Willkie, who <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> his speech from a typed manuscript without enlargement, failed to ignite the crowd. He remained in Rushville, where he owned farmland, over the next month, trying to become more associated with his native state than with Wall Street. He gave interviews to reporters there, and his firm support of Roosevelt's aid to the Allies led Congressman Martin and Senator McNary to support a peacetime draft despite the strident objections of many Republicans and some Democrats. [...] Roosevelt contacted Willkie through intermediaries to ensure the Republican candidate would not make a political issue out of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement; Willkie was supportive of the transfer, though he felt Congress should act, and opposed Roosevelt sending armaments to Britain by executive order.|$|E

500|$|Balzac's use of {{recurring}} characters {{has been}} identified as a unique component of his fiction. It enables a depth of characterization that goes beyond simple narration or dialogue. [...] "When the characters reappear", notes the critic Samuel Rogers, [...] "they do not step out of nowhere; they emerge from the privacy of their own lives which, for an interval, we have not been allowed to see." [...] Some readers, however, are intimidated by the depth created by these interdependent stories, and feel deprived of important context for the characters. Detective novelist Arthur Conan Doyle said that he never <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> Balzac, because he [...] "did not know where to begin". The characterization in La Cousine Bette is considered especially skillful. Anthony Pugh, in his book Balzac's Recurring Characters, says that the technique is employed [...] "for the most part without that feeling of self-indulgence that mars some of Balzac's later work. Almost every example arises quite naturally out of the situation." [...] Biographer Noel Gerson calls the characters in La Cousine Bette [...] "among the most memorable Balzac ever sketched".|$|E

It shows the band {{standing}} outside the hotel surrounded by various props, at the centre is a Rolls Royce floating in a swimming pool. Photographer Michael Spencer Johns said the original concept involved shooting each band member in various locations around the world, but when the cost proved prohibitive, the shoot was relocated to Stocks House. Spencer remarked that the shoot [...] "degenerated into chaos", adding that [...] "by 8pm, everyone was in the bar, there were schoolkids all over the set, and the lighting crew couldn't start the generator. It was Alice in Wonderland meets Apocalypse Now." [...] Critics have <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> into {{the selection of the}} cover props, Johns said Gallagher simply selected items from the BBC props store he thought would look good in the picture.

500|$|Dinklage has {{received}} widespread praise for his performance, with Matthew Gilbert from The Boston Globe saying that Dinklage [...] "gives a winning performance that is charming, morally ambiguous, and self-aware". Dan Kois of The New York Times noted that Dinklage's performance {{has made the}} character [...] "all the more popular". The Los Angeles Times wrote [...] "In many ways, Game of Thrones belongs to Dinklage". Tyrion {{has been called the}} [...] "most quotable" [...] character and [...] "one of the most beloved characters" [...] of the series. For his performance, he has gone on to win a Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2011 and 2015, as well as the 2012 Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. As a result of his performance and increased screen time, Dinklage was given top billing starting in the series' second season. In 2014, he said on The Late Show with David Letterman that he had once <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the books the show is based upon, but had found them confusing. He joked, [...] "George Martin, our author, is probably going to kill my character soon because I mentioned that." [...] In 2014, Dinklage and four of his Game of Thrones co-stars became some of the highest paid actors on television, although sources differ on the actors' per-episode salaries as of 2017. In 2015, Dinklage lent his voice for the role of Tyrion in , an episodic graphic adventure video game based on the show.|$|E

500|$|Brian Donlevy as Professor Bernard Quatermass: Donlevy reprised {{his role}} as the eponymous professor, much to the despair of Nigel Kneale, who had heavily criticised his {{interpretation}} of the role in The Quatermass Xperiment. As had been the case on The Quatermass Xperiment, Donlevy's alcoholism presented challenges for the production. Nigel Kneale recalled visiting the set one day: “He [...] was so full of whiskey he could hardly stand up. He staggered over to the set and looked dazedly around. They held up an idiot board with his lines on and he said, “What's this movie called?” and they said, “Well, it's called Quatermass 2”. He said, “I've got to say all that? There's too much talk. Cut down some of the talk”. He <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> it and he had to have go after go after go, so crippled with drink he hardly knew who he was”. Val Guest has denied Kneale's claims, saying “So many stories have been concocted since, about how he was a paralytic. It's absolute balls, because he was not paralytic. He wasn't stone cold sober either, but he was a pro and he knew his lines”. Guest also recalled, “By after lunch he would come to me and say “Give me a breakdown of the story so far. Where have I just been before this scene?” We used to feed him black coffee all morning but then we discovered he was lacing it. But he was a very professional actor and very easy to work with”.|$|E
500|$|A murderous and psychopathic {{criminal}} mastermind who portrays {{himself as}} an [...] "agent of chaos" [...] and rises to power by terrorizing Gotham and plunging it into anarchy. Before Ledger was confirmed for the role in July 2006, Paul Bettany, Lachy Hulme, Adrien Brody, Steve Carell, and Robin Williams publicly expressed interest in it. However, Nolan had {{wanted to work with}} Ledger on a number of projects in the past (including unsuccessfully approaching Ledger for the role of Batman in Batman Begins) and was agreeable to Ledger's chaotic interpretation of the character. When Ledger saw Batman Begins, he had realized a way to make the character work that was consistent with the film's tone: he described his Joker as a [...] "psychopathic, mass murdering, schizophrenic clown with zero empathy." [...] In the film, the Joker has a Glasgow smile, and his trademark chalk-white skin and red lips are makeup rather than the result of chemical bleaching, as in the traditional portrayal of the character. Throughout the film, the Joker states his desire to upset social order through crime, and comes to define himself by his conflict with Batman. To prepare for the role, Ledger lived alone in a hotel room for a month, formulating the character's posture, voice, and personality, and kept a diary, in which he recorded the Joker's thoughts and feelings. While he initially found it difficult, Ledger eventually generated a voice unlike Jack Nicholson's character in Tim Burton's 1989 Batman film. He was also given [...] and , which he [...] "really <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> and put it down." [...] Ledger also cited A Clockwork Orange and Sid Vicious as [...] "a very early starting point for Christian [...] and I. But we kind of flew far away from that pretty quickly and into another world altogether." [...] "There's a bit of everything in him. There's nothing that consistent," [...] Ledger said, and added, [...] "There are a few more surprises to him." [...] Ledger was allowed to shoot and mostly direct the videos the Joker sends out as warnings. Each take Ledger made was different from the last. Nolan was impressed enough with the first video shoot that he chose to not be present when Ledger shot the video with a kidnapped reporter (Anthony Michael Hall). On January 22, 2008, after he had completed filming The Dark Knight, Ledger died of an accidental prescription drug overdose, leading to intense press attention and memorial tributes. [...] "It was tremendously emotional, right when he passed, having to go back in and look at him every day ," [...] Nolan recalled. [...] "But the truth is, I feel very lucky to have something productive to do, to have a performance that he was very, very proud of, and that he had entrusted to me to finish." [...] All of Ledger's scenes appear as he completed them in the filming; in editing the film, Nolan added no [...] "digital effects" [...] to alter Ledger's actual performance posthumously. Nolan has dedicated the film in part to Ledger's memory.|$|E
