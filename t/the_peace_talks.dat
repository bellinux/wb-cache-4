5|$|Hanoi, {{which had}} {{continuously}} stipulated {{that it would}} not conduct negotiations while the bombing continued, finally agreed to meet with the Americans for preliminary talks in Paris. As a result, President Johnson declared that a complete bombing halt over North Vietnam would go into effect on 1 November 1968, just prior to the U.S. presidential election. Although the bombing halt was to be linked to progress in <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> <b>talks,</b> the Joint Chiefs were skeptical that the administration would reopen the bombing campaign under any circumstances. They were correct. North Vietnam was not the target of intense bombing again for another three and half years.|$|E
5|$|One year later, Hyun-jun {{returns to}} Korea to seek revenge. During this time, North and South Korea {{are set to}} reunify. However, the members of IRIS are intent on {{stopping}} the reunification. They attacked a local mall for hostages to blackmail {{both sides of the}} Korean government to threaten SK's president into announcing their political stand to not unite with NK. Hyun-jun became the negotiator for the president Cho Myung-ho (Lee Jung-gil) and for the hostages' release. Eventually, Sa-woo was killed. With all things hindering the reunification process gone, <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> <b>talks</b> resumed.|$|E
5|$|Emperor Gaozong {{supported}} settling a {{peace treaty}} with the Jurchens and sought {{to rein in the}} assertiveness of the military. The military expeditions of Yue Fei and other generals were an obstacle to peace negotiations. The government weakened the military by rewarding Yue Fei, Han Shizhong, and Zhang Jun (1086–1154) with titles that relieved them of their command over the Song armies. Han Shizhong, a critic of the treaty, retired. Yue Fei also announced his resignation as an act of protest. In 1141 Qin Hui had him imprisoned for insubordination. Charged with treason, Yue Fei was poisoned in jail on Qin's orders in early 1142. Jurchen diplomatic pressure during <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> <b>talks</b> may have played a role, but Qin Hui's alleged collusion with the Jin has never been proven.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>peace</b> <b>talks</b> that {{begun in}} 1247 {{achieved}} little, {{but a new}} truce was arranged in September 1248 and peace was made on November 24, 1248. Swantopolk had to return lands seized from his brothers, allow Teutonic Knights to pass through his domains, stop charging tolls on ships using the Vistula, and stop any aid to the Prussians. Prussians were compelled to sign the Treaty of Christburg on February 7, 1249. The treaty provided personal freedom and rights to newly converted Christians. It formally ended the uprising, but already in November 1249 the Natangians defeated the Knights at the Battle of Krücken. The skirmishes lasted until 1253 and some sources cite this year {{as the end of}} the uprising. At that point the treaty ceased its political power but remained an interesting historical document.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent {{analysis}} has indicated Overton {{may have been}} treated unfairly for these actions, becoming a scapegoat {{for the actions of}} many other pilots in the war. No new policies had been released warning about crossing the Chinese border, and no pilots before Overton had been punished for doing so. Overton himself expressed frustration at the move, as he had been the rearmost pilot in the formation that crossed the Yalu River on 24 January, and Mitchell himself had been known to cross the border and condoned the action. Fellow ace and unit member Francis Gabreski challenged the move, claiming that US pilots were outnumbered and {{it was the only way}} to maintain air superiority. It was later revealed that Swiss observers to <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> <b>talks</b> at Panmunjon were traveling through Manchuria on foot when they spotted a UN-Soviet dogfight and lodged a complaint, prompting an investigation which eventually indicted Overton.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of the Samichon River (24–26 July 1953) {{was fought}} {{during the final}} days of the Korean War between United Nations (UN) forces—primarily Australian and American—and the Chinese {{communist}} People's Volunteer Army. The fighting took place on a key position on the Jamestown Line known as The Hook and saw the defending UN troops, including the 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (2 RAR) from the 28th British Commonwealth Brigade and the US 7th Marine Regiment, fight off numerous assaults by the Chinese 137th Division during two concerted night attacks, inflicting numerous casualties on the Chinese with heavy artillery and small arms fire. The action was part of a larger, divisional-sized Chinese attack against the US 1st Marine Division, with diversionary assaults mounted against the Australians. With <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> <b>talks</b> in Panmunjom reaching a conclusion, the Chinese had been eager to gain a last-minute victory over the UN forces and the battle was the last of the war before the official signing of the Korean Armistice.|$|E
5|$|Patrolling by the Australians {{continued}} {{in order to}} prevent the Chinese from harassing their forward positions. Small clashes occurred on the nights of 15/16, 21/22, 22/23 and 23/24 July, suggesting that the Chinese were preparing for a major attack. Aerial reconnaissance subsequently detected a build up of Chinese forces and supplies west of the Samichon River. In response the Australians and US Marines stepped up their defensive preparations, {{while at the same time}} rumours from <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> <b>talks</b> started to spread of a ceasefire. Regardless, Chinese harassing artillery and mortar fire intensified, causing a constant stream of casualties among the Australians. Intense Chinese shelling struck Hill 121 and The Hook on the night of 19/20 July, with more than 300 rounds wounding four members of C Company, 2 RAR and further damaging the defences. That night the US Marines were driven off the Berlin and East Berlin features on the left flank, further exposing The Hook, which became a salient. Yet on 21 July an expected Chinese assault in the US 5th Marine Regiment sector failed to occur, while sightings of Chinese troops across the US 1st Marine Division front declined as the fighting entered a lull.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{contacts}} Sulu, who informs {{them the}} conference is being held at Camp Khitomer. Both ships head for the talks {{as fast as they}} can. As Enterprise nears the planet, Chang's cloaked Bird of Prey moves to intercept. With Enterprise unable to track his ship's position, Chang inflicts severe damage on Enterprise and then Excelsior. At the suggestion of Uhura, the Enterprise's communication officer, Spock and McCoy modify a photon torpedo to home in on the exhaust emissions of Chang's vessel, using equipment originally intended to study gaseous anomalies. The torpedo impact reveals Chang's location, and Enterprise and Excelsior destroy the Bird of Prey with a volley of torpedoes. Crew from both ships beam to the conference and halt an attempt on the Federation president's life. Kirk pleads for those present to continue the peace process. Having saved <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> <b>talks,</b> Enterprise is ordered back to Earth by Starfleet Command to be decommissioned, but the crew decide to take their time on the return voyage. As Enterprise cruises towards a nearby star, Kirk proclaims that though this mission is the final cruise of Enterprise under his command, others will continue their voyages.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{their losses}} during the {{previous}} fighting, the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong appeared to have gained the initiative. Indeed, although the Tet offensive had devastated the Viet Cong, costing them about half their strength in the south, the Defense Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam—General Vo Nguyen Giap—had moved quickly to replace these losses with reinforcements, and by early May 15,000 North Vietnamese soldiers were serving in Viet Cong units in South Vietnam. On 8 April, Westmoreland launched a series of large-scale sweeps involving over 70,000 South Vietnamese, American, Australian, New Zealand and Thai troops, code-named Operation Toan Thang I. Meanwhile, on 5 May the Viet Cong launched attacks against 119 provincial and district capitals, military installations and major cities during the May Offensive {{in an attempt to}} gain an advantage at the first session of peace negotiations scheduled to begin in Paris on the 13th. Saigon was successfully infiltrated in an event that received widespread international media coverage and resulted in considerable embarrassment for the Americans and their allies, with as many as five of the 13 attacking Viet Cong battalions penetrating the city's outer defences, plunging the capital into chaos and resulting in heavy civilian casualties. After three days of intense fighting American and South Vietnamese forces successfully repelled the assault while, as <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> <b>talks</b> neared, a fresh wave of attacks was launched on Saigon several days later. However, by 12 May the fighting was over, and the communists were forced to withdraw having suffered more than 5,500 dead in just over one week of fighting. US casualties were also heavy, amounting to 652 killed and 2,225 wounded, which made it the most costly week of the war for the Americans.|$|E
