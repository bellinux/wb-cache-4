6000|$|In general, {{for this}} reason, a shadow, or, at any rate, {{the part of}} the shadow nearest the object, is darker than {{the dark side of the}} object. I say in general, because a {{thousand}} accidents may interfere to prevent its being so. <b>Take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> glass, as a wine-glass, or the ink-bottle, and play it about a little on the side of your hand farthest from the window; you will presently find you are throwing gleams of light all over the dark side of your hand, and in some positions of the glass the reflection from it will annihilate the shadow altogether, and you will see your hand dark on the white paper. Now a stupid painter would represent, for instance, a drinking-glass beside the hand of one of his figures, and because he had been taught by rule that [...] "shadow was darker than the dark side," [...] he would never think of the reflection from the glass, but paint a dark grey under the hand, just as if no glass were there. But a great painter would be sure to think of the true effect, and paint it; and then comes the stupid critic, and wonders why the hand is so light on its dark side.|$|E
6000|$|... § 15. And now, farther, let us <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> the Turnerian tree {{in light}} and shade. I said above I would better {{the drawing of}} that pine trunk, which, though it has {{incipient}} shade, and muscular action, has no texture, nor local color. Now, I take about {{an inch and a}} half of Turner's ash trunks (one of the nearer ones) in this same drawing of Bolton Abbey (fig. 3. Plate 5.), and this I cannot better; this is perfectly finished; it is not possible to add more truth to it on that scale. Texture of bark, anatomy of muscle beneath, reflected lights in recessed hollows, stains of dark moss, and flickering shadows from the foliage above, all are there, as clearly as the human hand can mark them. I place a bit of trunk by Constable (fig. 5.),[41] from another plate in Leslie's Life of him (a dell in Helmingham Park, Suffolk), for the sake of the same comparison in shade that we have above in contour. You see Constable does not know whether he is drawing moss or shadow: those dark touches in the middle are confused in his mind between the dark stains on the trunk and its dark side; there is no anatomy, no cast shadow, nothing but idle sweeps of the brush, vaguely circular. The thing is much darker than Turner's, but it is not, therefore, finished; it is only blackened. And [...] "to blacken" [...] is indeed the proper word for all attempts at finish without knowledge. All true finish is added fact; and Turner's word for finishing a picture was always this significant one, [...] "carry forward." [...] But labor without added knowledge can only blacken or stain a picture, it cannot finish it.|$|E

The Word Alive headlined with We Came as Romans on the Dreams & Empires tour during the summer of 2009; from late July to mid-August.
