25|$|Benedict XV {{recalled}} the great Apostles of the Gospel who contributed {{much to the}} expansion of missions. He reviewed the recent history of the missions and stated so as the purpose of the apostolic letter. The encyclical first turned to the bishops and superiors in charge of the Catholic missions, noting the need to train local clergy. Catholic missionaries today continue <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>that</b> their goal is a spiritual one which must be carried out in a selfless way.|$|E
25|$|When the 1970 Roman Missal allowed laypeople {{to receive}} both species {{of bread and}} wine, it insisted that priests should use the {{occasion}} to teach the faithful the Catholic doctrine on the form of Communion, as affirmed by the Council of Trent: they were first <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>that</b> they receive the whole Christ when they participate in the sacrament even under one kind alone, and thus are not then deprived of any grace necessary for salvation. The circumstances in which this was permitted were initially very restricted, but were gradually extended. Regular distribution of Communion under both kinds requires {{the permission of the}} bishop, but bishops in some countries have given blanket permission for the administration of Communion in this way.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} half of the Victorian era, there was a more or less {{negative}} view of women's styles of the 1795–1820 period. Some people would have felt slightly uncomfortable <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>that</b> their mothers or grandmothers had once promenaded about in such styles (which could be considered indecent according to Victorian norms), and many would have found it somewhat difficult to really empathize with (or take seriously) the struggles of a heroine of art or literature if they were being constantly reminded that she was wearing such clothes. For such reasons, some Victorian history paintings of the Napoleonic wars intentionally avoided depicting accurate women's styles (see example below), Thackeray's illustrations to his book Vanity Fair depicted the women of the 1810s wearing 1840s fashions, and in Charlotte Brontë's 1849 novel Shirley (set in 1811–1812) neo-Grecian fashions are anachronistically relocated to an earlier generation.|$|E
5000|$|Regarding {{the purpose}} of art, O'Grady has observed: [...] "I think art’s first goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> us <b>that</b> we <b>are</b> human, {{whatever}} that is.

25|$|The Act {{allowed the}} commissioners to lease the tolls for periods {{of up to}} seven years, and the first lease was granted to Charles Chaplin, one of the commissioners who held ten shares, in January 1770. He agreed to pay a rent of 4 per cent per year to the other shareholders, and to {{contribute}} a maximum of £500 per year towards maintenance costs. If more than £500 was needed, the commissioners were to supply any additional amounts. Although Chaplin had an option to renew the lease after 7 years, {{he did not do}} so, and no other takers could be found. The commissioners then negotiated with Chaplin, and revised terms were agreed. In return for a 99-year lease, he would fund all repairs, pay the salaries of the officers of the canal, and pay 5 per cent interest to the subscribers. Clearly, the 99-year lease was not authorised by the enabling Act, but nobody challenged its legality for over 50 years. Chaplin was not thorough in carrying out his side of the bargain and had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>that</b> he had not been paying the interest in 1782 and again in 1788.|$|E
500|$|Music was a {{major part}} of {{everyday}} life. [...] The word itself derives from Greek μουσική (mousike), [...] "(art) of the Muses". Many private and public events were accompanied by music, ranging from nightly dining to military parades and manoeuvres. In a discussion of any ancient music, however, non-specialists and even many musicians have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>that</b> much of what makes our modern music familiar to us is the result of developments only within the last 1,000 years; thus, our ideas of melody, scales, harmony, and even the instruments we use may not have been familiar to Romans who made and listened to music many centuries earlier.|$|E
500|$|Peter Gaston of Spin {{wrote that}} the video for [...] "Hard" [...] resembles [...] "Janet Jackson's 'Rhythm Nation' meets Christina Aguilera's 'Dirrty' phase—Rihanna vamps in dimly lit outposts, dodges explosions in the desert, and, quite enticingly, takes a break from boot camp to smother herself with mud. Morale-boosting, indeed!" [...] James Dinh of MTV News showed the video, on a small player, to fans in Times Square in New York City to ask their opinions. Most said she looked [...] "sexy" [...] in the video, and {{agreed that it was}} {{different}} from previous videos and shows where she came from and where she is going in her personal life. Bill Lamb of About.com wrote, [...] "I must confess that I do fail to understand the point of Rihanna humping the gun turret of a pink tank dressed in Mickey Mouse ears. It seems pains were taken to make the setting look like Afghanistan or Iraq with the other actors looking as close to real military personnel as possible." [...] Lamb criticized the video's lack of sensitivity and respect for using an army and weapons of destruction to glamorize war, saying, [...] "Does Def Jam, Rihanna's label, need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>that</b> this comes on the heels of sadly sending off an additional 30,000 troops from our country to real war? In my mind {{this is one of the}} most tasteless, offensive moves by a major pop artist in recent memory." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{song was}} {{featured}} in a comedy skit performed by Seth MacFarlane and Alex Borstein on Seth and Alex's Almost Live Comedy Show, in which Borstein opposes MacFarlane's singing of the song, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> jokingly <b>reminded</b> <b>that,</b> {{as a result of}} the Holocaust, Borstein's only competition as a female Jewish comedian in Hollywood is Sarah Silverman. Borstein then joins MacFarlane in singing the song.|$|R
2500|$|In 2003 {{she wrote}} a novel for young adults titled Avenging Janie which {{incorporated}} cold reading and a cult into the plot. The book was well received. Writer John Marsden said of it, [...] "It's good <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>that</b> there are still new plots out there - and writers for young people brave enough to take them on." [...] Cold reading expert Ian Rowland said, [...] "it really is an amazing piece of work." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Times commented, [...] "there is another, sweeter side to her travails. [...] Miranda loves singing and, despite – {{or perhaps}} because of – the satire, becomes an {{evocation}} of something all humans love to do and have done since before we discovered language. The very act of singing, however dire the sound, makes us feel good." [...] Ballinger noted that the TV show Glee (to which Miranda submitted an [...] "audition" [...] in 2010) is causing a resurgence of interest in singing in schools: [...] "Everyone is talking about Glee and choirs and musical theatre, igniting a flame that has been dimmed for a long time. ... Live performance and musical theatre were almost a lost art ... people need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>that</b> it takes a lot more effort to sing than just watching movies or TV shows." [...] Miranda followed up on this idea, saying: [...] "Since I became so famous ... everyone is watching more music and singing more – because everyone wants to be more like me." [...] As the Miranda character matured, its popularity grew especially with younger audiences of the Glee generation, with most of those attending her concerts being teenagers or in their twenties. Ballinger says that she gets the most satisfaction from her live performances.|$|E

40|$|Objectives In {{order to}} satisfy the {{industry}} needs of reducing development costs and time to market, the new trends within the design process are driven by the integration between disciplines and by using automated design procedures. Applications Multidisciplinary analysis are mainly characterised by the design of accurate interfaces between disciplines. It has <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>remind</b> <b>that</b> {{the accuracy of the}} algorithms used in separate disciplines can not be preserved in the overall simulation process without taking care of the development of accurate coupling procedures. A classical example of multidisciplinary application is the study of fluid-structure interactions. In this case, the interaction between disciplines can be summarised as follows: the loads provided by the fluid <b>are</b> transferred <b>to</b> the structure which in turn transfers displacements and displacements velocities to the fluid. Then, not only the forces have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> preserved through the coupling procedure but above all the energy. In the case these properties are not satisfied, instabilities in the simulation can appear without being supported by any physical meaning. Both for static and dynami...|$|R
