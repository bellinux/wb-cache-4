5|$|A Fistful of Dollars {{proved a}} {{landmark}} {{in the development}} of spaghetti Westerns, with Leone depicting a more lawless and desolate world than traditional westerns, and challenging American stereotypes of a western hero with a morally ambiguous antihero. The film's success made Eastwood a major star in Italy and he was re-hired to star in For a Few Dollars More (1965), the second of the trilogy. Through the efforts of screenwriter Luciano Vincenzoni, the rights to For a Few Dollars More and the final film of the trilogy (The Good, the Bad and <b>the</b> <b>Ugly)</b> were sold to United Artists for about $900,000.|$|E

It was also incorporated in her Confessions Tour, where Madonna and her dancers jumped around the stage actively, while singing the song. The song was used in the movie The Devil Wears Prada (2005) and <b>the</b> <b>Ugly</b> Betty season 2 finale.|$|E
5|$|The {{film version}} of the novel {{has not been the}} only movie to have a {{character}} borrowing some aspects of Wintour.

Fey Sommers in <b>the</b> <b>Ugly</b> Betty television series was also likened to Wintour, from the trademark bob and sunglasses, to Wintour's last name homophonous with 'Winter', while Sommers' is homophonous with 'Summer'.|$|E

5|$|Although Attila and The Phantom of the Opera were {{important}} breaks, {{it was only}} in 2007 that Butler gained worldwide recognition for his portrayal of King Leonidas in Zack Snyder's 2007 fantasy war film 300. It earning him a MTV Movie Award for Best Fight and an Empire Award for Best Actor nomination. That same year, Butler starred in the romantic drama film P.S. I Love You with Hilary Swank. After appearing in the 2008 films Nim's Island with Jodie Foster and RocknRolla with Idris Elba, Butler took the lead in several 2009 films including the romantic comedy <b>The</b> <b>Ugly</b> Truth with Katherine Heigl and the thriller Law Abiding Citizen with Jamie Foxx.|$|E
5|$|Viv wakes to find Bond gone, {{leaving a}} note in which he {{promises}} to send her police assistance and which he concludes by telling her not to dwell too much on <b>the</b> <b>ugly</b> events through which she has just lived. As Viv finishes reading the note, a large police detachment arrives. After taking her statement, the officer {{in charge of the}} detail reiterates Bond's advice, but also warns Viv that all men involved in violent crime and espionage, regardless of which side they are on—including Bond himself—are dangerous and that Viv should avoid them. Viv reflects on this as she motors off {{at the end of the}} book, continuing her tour of America, but despite the officer's warning still devoted to the memory of the spy who loved her.|$|E
5|$|In 1209, the Jain scholar, minister, {{builder of}} temples and army {{commander}} Janna wrote, among other classics, Yashodhara Charite, a {{unique set of}} stories in 310verses dealing with sadomasochism, transmigration of the soul, passion gone awry and cautionary morals for human conduct. The writing, although inspired by Vadiraja's Sanskrit classic of the same name, is noted for its original interpretation, imagery and style. In one story, the poet tells of the infatuation of a man for his friend's wife. Having killed his friend, the man abducts the wife, who dies of grief. Overcome by repentance, he burns himself on the funeral pyre of the woman. The stories of infatuation reach a peak when Janna writes about the attraction of Amrutamati, the queen, to <b>the</b> <b>ugly</b> mahout Ashtavakra, who pleases the queen with kicks and whip lashes. This story has piqued the interest of modern researchers. In honour of this work, Janna received the title Kavichakravarthi ("Emperor among poets") from his patron, King Veera BallalaII. His other classic, Anathanatha Purana (1230), is an account {{of the life of the}} 14thtirthankar Ananthanatha.|$|E
40|$|In {{opposition}} to the usual interpretation of <b>the</b> <b>Ugliest</b> Man, this paper attempts to show the difference between this figure {{and the rest of}} the Higher Men in Also sprach Zarathustra. <b>The</b> <b>Ugliest</b> Man runs <b>the</b> way from wrath to laughter which constitutes the transit from murder for revenge to murder for the genuine conviction of the danger of a narrower faith. The Ass-Festival becomes the time when <b>the</b> <b>Ugliest</b> Man, with a mocking attitude, murders God for the second time. The laughter turns into a genealogical work that succeeds in demystifying the ritual and turning it into a playful parody capable of putting an end to any ultimate foundation. <b>The</b> <b>Ugliest</b> Man, unlike <b>the</b> other Higher Men, manages to free his spirit and to pave the way for the Übermensch...|$|R

5|$|Walt Disney Productions {{first began}} {{exploring}} a possible live action/animation biography film of author and poet Hans Christian Andersen sometime in late 1937 before the December premiere of its film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the first feature-length hand-drawn animated film ever made. In March 1940, Walt Disney suggested a co-production to film producer Samuel Goldwyn, where Goldwyn's studio would shoot the live-action sequences of Andersen's life and Disney's studio would animate Andersen's fairy tales. The animated sequences {{would be based}} on some of Andersen's best known works, such as The Little Mermaid, The Little Match Girl, The Steadfast Tin Soldier, The Snow Queen, Thumbelina, <b>The</b> <b>Ugly</b> Duckling, The Red Shoes, and The Emperor's New Clothes. However, the studio encountered difficulty with The Snow Queen, as it could not find a way to adapt and relate the Snow Queen character to modern audiences. Even {{as far back as the}} 1930s and 1940s, it was clear that the source material contained great cinematic possibilities, but the Snow Queen character proved to be too problematic. After the United States entered World War II, the studio began to focus on making wartime propaganda, which caused development on the Disney–Goldwyn project to grind to a halt in 1942. Goldwyn went on to produce his own live-action film version in 1952, entitled Hans Christian Andersen, with Danny Kaye as Andersen, Charles Vidor directing, Moss Hart writing, and Frank Loesser penning the songs. All of Andersen's fairy tales were, instead, told in song and ballet in live-action, like the rest of the film. It went on to receive six Academy Award nominations the following year. Back at Disney, The Snow Queen, along with other Andersen fairy tales (including The Little Mermaid), were shelved.|$|E

25|$|The film's working {{title was}} I due magnifici straccioni (The Two Magnificent Tramps). It was changed just before {{shooting}} began when Vincenzoni thought up Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo (The Good, <b>the</b> <b>Ugly,</b> the Bad), which Leone loved. In the United States, United Artists considered using the original Italian translation, River of Dollars, or The Man With No Name, but decided on The Good, the Bad and <b>the</b> <b>Ugly.</b>|$|E
