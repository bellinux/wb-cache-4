5|$|The partial {{pressures}} of oxygen {{and carbon dioxide}} in the arterial blood are measured by <b>the</b> <b>peripheral</b> chemoreceptors – the aortic and carotid bodies, and the central chemoreceptors of the medulla oblongata of the brainstem. <b>The</b> <b>peripheral</b> chemoreceptors are more sensitive to the arterial partial pressure of oxygen than they are to the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide. The central chemoreceptor is particularly sensitive to the pH of the cerebrospinal fluid, which is directly influenced by the partial pressure of {{carbon dioxide in the}} arterial blood.|$|E
40|$|In a {{processing}} system comprising a processor and {{a plurality of}} <b>peripherals</b> coupled to <b>the</b> processor, access privileges of a secure operating mode of the processor are delegated to at least a given one of <b>the</b> <b>peripherals.</b> <b>The</b> given <b>peripheral</b> is configured to store, in a secure portion of that peripheral, state information indicative of the processor being in a secure operating mode. <b>The</b> given <b>peripheral</b> is further configured to utilize the stored state information to allow <b>the</b> given <b>peripheral</b> to access at least one resource that is accessible to the processor in the secure operating mode but is not otherwise accessible to <b>the</b> given <b>peripheral.</b> <b>The</b> {{processing system}} may comprise, for example, a system on a chip, wherein <b>the</b> processor and <b>peripherals</b> are combined into a single integrated circuit...|$|R

5|$|Ethernet {{standards}} require {{electrical isolation}} between the networked device (computer, phone, etc.) {{and the network}} cable up to 1500VAC or 2250VDC for 60seconds. USB has no such requirement as it was designed for peripherals closely associated with a host computer, and in fact it connects <b>the</b> <b>peripheral</b> and host grounds. This gives Ethernet a significant safety advantage over USB with peripherals such as cable and DSL modems connected to external wiring that can assume hazardous voltages under certain fault conditions.|$|E
5|$|Information from <b>the</b> <b>peripheral</b> chemoreceptors is {{relayed to}} a series of {{interconnected}} nuclei which comprise the respiratory centres in the medulla oblongata and the pons of the brainstem. This information determines the average rate of ventilation of the alveoli of the lungs, to keep the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the arterial blood constant. The respiratory centre does so via motor neurons which activate the muscles of respiration (in particular the diaphragm).|$|E

5|$|The name {{multiple}} sclerosis {{refers to the}} scars (sclerae – better known as plaques or lesions) that form in the nervous system. These lesions most commonly affect the white matter in the optic nerve, brain stem, basal ganglia, and spinal cord, or white matter tracts close to the lateral ventricles. The function of white matter cells is to carry signals between grey matter areas, where the processing is done, {{and the rest of}} the body. <b>The</b> <b>peripheral</b> nervous system is rarely involved.|$|E

5|$|The {{population}} growth rate was higher {{during the decade}} of 1981–90 due to increased provision of social, economic and recreational facilities that caused the rural population to migrate to urban areas. The overall growth rate had declined {{over the last two}} decades due to poor returns in agriculture and increased migration of agricultural labourers to other urban centres. The population density of the town is high in the centre and low in <b>the</b> <b>peripheral</b> regions.|$|E
5|$|A recent threat, first {{reported}} in 1978, is forest dieback. In some areas, especially in <b>the</b> <b>peripheral</b> region, {{this has been}} severe with nearly a 50% in vegetation. Water deficiency has been attributed as {{the main cause of}} dieback as droughts are becoming more frequent. Regrowth of forest is hindered by frost which is increasingly severe. The forest dieback has affected 22 species of plants with Calophyllum walkeri being the most affected. A study has suggested that low calcium causes soil acidification and increased toxicity caused by metallic elements such as aluminium may be causing the dieback. Leaching of nutrients and the resulting imbalance in soil micronutrients may also be contributing to the dieback.|$|E
5|$|After {{expanding}} on Neuromancer {{with two}} more novels to complete the dystopic Sprawl trilogy, Gibson collaborated with Bruce Sterling on the alternate history novel The Difference Engine (1990), which became an important work of the science fiction subgenre steampunk. In the 1990s, Gibson composed the Bridge trilogy of novels, which explored the sociological developments of near-future urban environments, postindustrial society, and late capitalism. Following {{the turn of the}} century and the events of 9/11, Gibson emerged with a string of increasingly realist novels—Pattern Recognition (2003), Spook Country (2007), and Zero History (2010)—set in a roughly contemporary world. These works saw his name reach mainstream bestseller lists for the first time. His more recent novel, <b>The</b> <b>Peripheral</b> (2014), returned to a more overt engagement with technology and recognizable science fiction concerns.|$|E
40|$|Radio jamming is the {{transmission}} of radio signals that disrupt communications by decreasing the signal to noise ratio. RF Jammers are devices designed to prevent other communication devices from successfully operating. RF UP converters are integrated assemblies that convert higher frequency signals to microwave frequencies. The Project work presented here is to develop the prototype model of RF UP converter and FPGA module to disrupt the communication. RF UP converter includes LMK 04806 clock conditioner and DAC 3484 devices. The frequency data for the RF UP converter is fed from the XC 6 VLX 240 T- 1 FFG 1156 because this FPGA has an additional peripheral feature of FMC HPC. <b>The</b> <b>peripherals</b> interfaced with this FPGA on custom board are DDR 3 SDRAM, Platform Flash, System Monitor, FMC HPC and Ethernet. The use of FPGA encourages design reuse and can greatly enhance the upgradability of digital systems. To test <b>the</b> <b>peripherals</b> on custom FPGA board and to configure RF UP converter devices, Xilinx 13. 4 platform is being used. Tools like Embedded Development Kit and Software Development Kit are used to verify the functionality of <b>the</b> <b>peripherals.</b> <b>The</b> configuration of LMK 04806 and DAC 3484 are done using codeloader 4 and DAC 348 x GUI tools respectively...|$|R

5|$|After {{the virus}} enters the body {{there is a}} period of rapid viral replication, leading to an {{abundance}} of virus in <b>the</b> <b>peripheral</b> blood. During primary infection, the level of HIV may reach several million virus particles per milliliter of blood. This response is accompanied by a marked drop in the number of circulating CD4+ T cells. The acute viremia is almost invariably associated with activation of CD8+ T cells, which kill HIV-infected cells, and subsequently with antibody production, or seroconversion. The CD8+ T cell response is thought to be important in controlling virus levels, which peak and then decline, as the CD4+ T cell counts recover. A good CD8+ T cell response has been linked to slower disease progression and a better prognosis, though it does not eliminate the virus.|$|E
5|$|From 1809 to 1898, {{a period}} called Pax Russica, <b>the</b> <b>peripheral</b> {{power of the}} Finns {{gradually}} increased, and the Russian-Finnish relations were exceptionally peaceful compared with {{other parts of the}} Russian Empire. Russia's defeat in the Crimean War in the 1850s led to attempts to speed up the modernization of the country. This caused more than 50 years of economic, industrial, cultural and educational progress in the Grand Duchy of Finland, including improvement in the status of the Finnish language. All this encouraged Finnish nationalism and cultural unity through the birth of the Fennoman movement, which bound the Finns to the domestic governmental system and led to the idea that the Finnish Grand Duchy was an increasingly autonomous state of the Russian Empire.|$|E
5|$|Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} (GBS) is a rapid-onset {{muscle weakness}} {{caused by the}} immune system damaging <b>the</b> <b>peripheral</b> nervous system. The initial symptoms are typically changes in sensation or pain along with muscle weakness, beginning in the feet and hands. This often spreads to the arms and upper body with both sides being involved. The symptoms develop over hours to a few weeks. During the acute phase, the disorder can be life-threatening with about 15% developing weakness of the breathing muscles requiring mechanical ventilation. Some are affected by changes in {{the function of the}} autonomic nervous system, which can lead to dangerous abnormalities in heart rate and blood pressure.|$|E
