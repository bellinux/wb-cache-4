5|$|Crocodilian teeth {{vary from}} blunt and dull to sharp and needle-like. Broad-snouted species have teeth that vary in size, while those of slender-snouted species are more uniform. The teeth of {{crocodiles}} and gharials {{tend to be}} more visible than those of alligators and caimans when the jaws are closed. The easiest way to distinguish crocodiles from alligators is by looking at their jaw line. The teeth on the lower jaw of an alligator fit into sockets in the upper jaw, so only the upper teeth are visible when the mouth is closed. The teeth on the lower jaw of a crocodile fit into grooves {{on the outside of the}} <b>top</b> <b>jaw</b> making both the upper and lower teeth visible when the mouth is closed.|$|E
25|$|The Iriomote cat has six {{pairs of}} incisors, {{two pairs of}} canine teeth, four pairs of premolars, and two pairs of molars {{for a total of}} 28 teeth. Compared to other cats, {{including}} small wild cats, the Iriomote cat is lacking one pair of premolars on the <b>top</b> <b>jaw</b> behind the canines. In addition to this, unlike most other subtropical mammals, Iriomote cats' teeth give details about their year-to-year history. It is expected that these details will help determine the age and behavior of the cats.|$|E
25|$|The broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus) is {{the only}} extant member of the genus Notorynchus, in the family Hexanchidae. It is {{recognizable}} because of its seven gill slits, while most shark species have five gill slits, {{with the exception of}} the members of the order Hexanchiformes and the sixgill sawshark. This shark has a large, thick body, with a broad head and blunt snout. The <b>top</b> <b>jaw</b> has jagged, cusped teeth and the bottom jaw has comb-shaped teeth. Its single dorsal fin is set far back along the spine towards the caudal fin, and is behind the pelvic fins. In this shark the upper caudal fin is much longer than the lower, and is slightly notched near the tip. Like many sharks, this sevengill is counter-shaded. Its dorsal surface is silver-gray to brown in order to blend with the dark water and substrate when viewed from above. In counter to this, its ventral surface is very pale, blending with the sunlit water when viewed from below. The body and fins are covered in a scattering of small black & white spots. In juveniles, their fins often have white margins.|$|E

50|$|Horned frogs {{are well}} known for their fearless reputation. They will attempt to consume animals, {{sometimes}} even the size of themselves. If threatened by a larger animal such as a human, these frogs can deliver a painful bite as they have several odontoid projections (not teeth per se) along their bottom and <b>top</b> <b>jaws.</b> Sometimes they will even jump towards their attacker, no matter their size and power. However, in captivity this frogs' natural diet is fairly easy to recreate. When kept as a pet, the Horned frog is usually fed mainly on large adult locusts, black and brown crickets and mice; they also enjoy - depending on size - live fish. However, studies have proven primarily feeding a Horned frog mice causes fat build-up, which often results in blindness and death.|$|R

5000|$|The {{features}} most {{associated with}} the miquelet are the horizontal sears, acting through the lockplate, coupled with the external mainspring and the <b>top</b> <b>jaw</b> screw ring. Experts agree {{that the use of}} horizontally acting sears is the true defining feature because some variations of the miquelet do not have the external mainspring and/or the large <b>top</b> <b>jaw</b> screw ring.|$|E

50|$|Hemipristis has two {{distinct}} type of teeth in each section of its jaw. The {{ones on the}} upper jaw act like knives, cutting through {{the flesh of the}} prey, while the pointed ones on the bottom act like forks, spearing the prey and holding it down. Because this shark was poorly studied in the past and its <b>top</b> and bottom <b>jaw</b> teeth differ to such a great degree, its <b>top</b> and lower <b>jaw</b> teeth were assigned to a separate genus in the past.|$|R

The operculum edge has 3 flat spines; the pre-operculum is without spines. The caudal fin is rounded. The lateral line is complete, it ends at the caudal fin base and is smoothly arched. The scales are rough and relatively small." ...|$|E
50|$|Pleurodonta (from Greek lateral teeth, in {{reference}} to the position of the teeth on the jaw) is one of the two subdivisions of Iguania, the other being Acrodonta (teeth on the <b>top</b> the <b>jaw).</b> Pleurodonta includes all families previously split from Iguanidae sensu lato (Corytophanidae, Crotaphytidae, Hoplocercidae, Opluridae, Polychrotidae, etc.), whereas Acrodonta includes Agamidae and Chamaeleonidae. The name Pleurodonta was first used by paleontologist and herpetologist Edward Drinker Cope in 1864, although he used it in a different sense than it is used today. Because of this difference, the name Iguanoidea has been proposed as a replacement for Pleurodonta in phylogenetic nomenclature.|$|R
2500|$|For {{angle and}} {{posterior}} body fractures, when {{the angle of}} the fracture line is angled back (more posterior at the <b>top</b> of the <b>jaw</b> and more anterior {{at the bottom of the}} jaw) the muscles tend to bring the fracture segments together. [...] This is called favorable. [...] When {{the angle of the}} fractures is pointing to the front, it is unfavorable.|$|R
50|$|Chasmatosuchus was an archosauriform reptile {{from the}} early Triassic period of European Russia. One of the {{earliest}} described archosauriforms, it was over 2 m long and {{is thought to have}} behaved like a modern crocodile. Its mouth had two distinct features: the <b>top</b> of its <b>jaw</b> hooked downwards to aid in holding prey, and the upper palate was lined with a row of teeth—a primitive feature lost in later archosaurs.|$|R
50|$|Elastic {{bands are}} used to apply {{pressure}} to the bow or hooks which is then transferred to the patients teeth and jaw. Its purpose is to slow or stop the upper jaw from growing, thereby preventing or correcting an overjet. Other forms of headgear treat reverse overjets, in which the <b>top</b> <b>jaw</b> is not forward enough. It {{is similar to a}} facemask, also attached to braces, and encourages forward growth of the upper jaw.|$|E
5000|$|Jepson {{was born}} with a {{development}} jaw deformity - her <b>top</b> <b>jaw</b> stuck out by eight millimetres and her lower jaw hung down into her neck. This resulted in a deformed appearance which she herself described made her look [...] "like a chipmunk". She was forced to wait until her late teens before she could have reconstructive surgery, as it was necessary to wait until her facial and jaw bones had stopped growing.|$|E
50|$|Protrusion is the {{extension}} of the mouth or premaxilla towards the prey, via mechanical linkages. Protrusion is known only in modern bony fishes, which possess many forms of coupled linkages in their head. Remarkable examples are the slingjaw wrasse and the sand eel which can protrude their mouth by several centimeters. Another example of protrusion is seen in dragonfly larvae, or nymphs, which have hydraulic lower mandibles, protruding forward to catch prey and bring it to the <b>top</b> <b>jaw.</b>|$|E
50|$|Mouthpiece: (Sometimes {{known as}} gumshield, {{mouthguard}}). Used {{to protect the}} inside of the mouth and lips from getting cut by the teeth when a hard punch to the face is received. The mouthguard also helps to lock the <b>top</b> and bottom <b>jaws</b> together preventing painful damage to the jaw joint capsule when a boxer is struck by a hook. Important that it is worn in both sparring and its tough competition.|$|R
2500|$|The {{creature}} {{is covered with}} parasites, which it sheds {{as part of a}} [...] "post-birth ritual". [...] Abrams described the parasites as [...] "horrifying, dog-sized creatures that just scatter around the city and add to the nightmare of the evening". Reeves added that [...] "The parasites have a voracious, rabid, bounding nature, but they also have a crab-like crawl. They have the viciousness of a dog, but with the ability to climb walls and stick to objects." [...] The top half of the parasite's head is the mandible. The <b>top</b> and lower <b>jaws</b> end in serrated edges and have four pairs of eyes each. The rest of the parasite consists of a crustacean-like carapace, several pairs of claws, and arms. A deep blue-purple muscular membrane stretches between the <b>top</b> and lower <b>jaws.</b> When a human is bitten, the victim becomes ill and bleeds profusely, mainly from the eyes, and shortly after this, the torso expands and explodes. They are called HSPs (Human Scale Parasites) on the Blu-ray Special Investigation Mode.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{bones were}} small plastic figurines made with faces. Each bone {{had a different}} name and personality. The long line of characters included the well known <b>Jaws,</b> <b>Top</b> Hat, and Eggy. Slight variations in design with a shift to a more spooky nature, of 59-78, led to production of the Mutant set of bones. On the other hand, Things, Ghost, Aliens, Buddies, and Sports were intended as each containing brand new characters.|$|R
50|$|Trout cod are a {{small to}} medium groper-like fish with a deep, {{elongated}} body that is round in cross section. In contrast to Murray cod, trout cod have a pointed head with the <b>top</b> <b>jaw</b> overhanging the bottom jaw, and {{the slope of the}} head is straight. The eyes are slightly larger and more prominent than in Murray cod. The head tends to be free of speckling however a distinct dark stripe through the eye is usually present.|$|E
50|$|The pygmy {{killer whale}} is dark gray to black {{on the cape}} and has a sharp change to lighter gray on the sides. The flesh around their lips and {{on the end of}} their snout is white while pinkish white skin {{surrounds}} the genitals. The average length is just over two meters (6.5 ft.). Upon reaching 2 meters in length, males are considered sexually mature. They have approximately 48 teeth, with 22 teeth on the <b>top</b> <b>jaw</b> and 26 on the lower jaw.|$|E
50|$|Keeltail needlefish, {{like all}} needlefish, closely {{resemble}} North American freshwater gars (family Lepisosteidae). It is most {{recognized by the}} large, flat keel-like structures running {{on either side of}} the tail. They have 12 to 15 rays on their dorsal fins, and 17 to 20 rays on their anal fin. Keeltail needlefish have gill-rakers, their caudal peduncles have lateral keels, with a lateral line running ventral to it, and grow up to 50 cm long The keeltail needlefish's <b>top</b> <b>jaw</b> is also smaller than the lower one.|$|E
50|$|Cattle have thirty-two teeth, {{including}} six incisors or biting teeth and two canines {{in the front}} on the bottom jaw. The canine teeth are not pointed but look like incisors. The incisor teeth meet with the thick hard dental pad of the upper jaw. Cattle have six premolars and six molars on both <b>top</b> and bottom <b>jaws</b> {{for a total of}} twenty-four molars. The teeth of cattle are designed primarily for grinding, and they use their rough tongues to grasp grass and then nip it off between their incisors and the dental pad.|$|R
50|$|Phase 2 {{involves}} maxillomandibular advancement, a surgery which {{moves the}} <b>jaw</b> <b>top</b> (maxilla) and bottom (mandible) forward. The tongue muscle is {{anchored to the}} chin, and translation of the mandible forward pulls the tongue forward as well. If the procedure achieves the desired results, when the patient sleeps and the tongue relaxes, it {{will no longer be}} able to block the airway. Success is much better for Phase 2 than for Phase 1 - approximately 90 percent benefit from the second phase, and the success of the Stanford Protocol Operation therefore is due in large part to this second phase.|$|R
2500|$|Serpico {{was then}} {{shot in the}} face by the suspect, with a [...]22 LR pistol, and the bullet struck just below the eye lodging at the <b>top</b> of his <b>jaw.</b> He fired back, fell to the floor, and began to bleed profusely. His police colleagues refused to make a [...] "10-13" [...] {{dispatch}} to police headquarters indicating that an officer had been shot. An elderly man {{who lived in the}} next apartment called the emergency services reporting that a man had been shot and stayed with Serpico. When a police car arrived, aware that Serpico was a fellow officer, they transported him in the patrol car to Greenpoint Hospital.|$|R
5000|$|The fish bears some {{resemblance}} {{to members of}} Gempylidae, but has protrusible premaxillae, serrated opercles and preopercles, and a spur on the lowest principal caudal ray, {{all of which are}} characteristic of percoids. Its color varies from black to dark brown. This fish is known to grow to 30 cm in length. The body is covered in soft scales which easily slough off when handled. The eyes are large with usually a single pair of elongated teeth {{in the middle of the}} <b>top</b> <b>jaw.</b>|$|E

Adult males have long filaments on their tail fin lobes and prolonged rays posteriorly on the dorsal and anal fins. They have 17 pectoral rays. The lateral line is unbroken and smoothly arched. They have 31 large scales with pores on the lateral line. The maximum size is up to 76 cm, the common size is up to 35 cm.|$|E
40|$|Standard {{database}} is {{the essential}} requirement to compare the performance of image analysis techniques. Hence the main issue in dental image analysis {{is the lack of}} available image database which is provided in this paper. Periapical dental X-ray images which are suitable for any analysis and approved by many dental experts are collected. This type of dental radiograph imaging is common and inexpensive, which is normally used for dental disease diagnosis and abnormalities detection.

5|$|Giant mouse lemurs {{have two}} pairs of mammae, one on the chest (pectoral) {{and one on the}} abdomen (abdominal). Their fur is {{typically}} grayish-brown on the dorsal (back) side and more gray in color on the ventral (front) side. The tail is typically black-tipped. The new population found by WWF in 2010 has an overall lighter color, along with reddish or rusty patches near the hands and feet on the dorsal side of the arms and legs. This population also has a red tail, which darkens at the end. Vibrissae are found above the eyes (superciliary), above the mouth (buccal), under the lower jaw (genal), near the <b>top</b> of the <b>jaw</b> (interramal), and on the wrist (carpal). Like mouse lemurs, the ears are large and membranous.|$|R
50|$|However, E. scansoria {{is not a}} true placental mammal as {{it lacks}} some {{features}} that are specific to placentals. These include {{the presence of a}} malleolus {{at the bottom of the}} fibula, the smaller of the two shin bones, a complete mortise and tenon upper ankle joint, where the rearmost bones of the foot fit into a socket formed by the ends of the tibia and fibula, and an atypical ancestral eutherian dental formula, 5.1.5.3/4.1.5.3 (incisors, canines, premolars, molars on each side of the <b>top</b> and bottom <b>jaws</b> respectively). Eomaia had five upper and four lower incisors (much more typical for metatherians) and five premolars to three molars. Placental mammals have only up to three incisors on each top and bottom and four premolars to three molars, but the premolar/molar proportion is similar to placentals.|$|R
