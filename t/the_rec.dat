5|$|Faversham Recreation Ground (locally known {{simply as}} Faversham Rec) is {{to the east of}} the town centre. It was {{established}} in 1860 by local solicitor Henry Wreight, who bequeathed his £70,000 estate, including two almshouses housing 70 people, to the town in order that locals would have an area to enjoy. <b>The</b> <b>rec</b> has been preserved and is now run by the town's Municipal Charity. A bandstand was added {{towards the end of the}} 19th century, and sporting events began to be held on <b>the</b> <b>rec.</b> A week long party was held to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, which drew praise from Princess Andrei of Russia, then living in Faversham. A 50-year extension on the lease was signed in 2010, confirmed its continued use by the general public.|$|E
5|$|In late July 2007, South Somerset District Council {{plans were}} made public by the Western Gazette {{to build a}} £21m 'Yeovil Sports Zone' on Yeovil Recreation Ground, {{which has been a}} popular open green space used by the local {{community}} for over seventy years. Residents fought to protect <b>the</b> <b>Rec,</b> leading to rejection of the proposals in 2009, and further consultations in 2010.|$|E
5|$|HDMI 2.0 {{increases}} the maximum TMDS clock to 600MHz (18.0Gbit/s). HDMI 2.0 uses 8b/10b encoding for video transmission like previous versions, {{giving it a}} maximum video bandwidth of 14.4Gbit/s. This enables HDMI 2.0 to carry 4K video at 60Hz with 24bit/px color depth. Other features of HDMI 2.0 include support for <b>the</b> <b>Rec.</b> 2020 color space, up to 32 audio channels, up to 1536kHz audio sample frequency, dual video streams to multiple users on the same screen, up to four audio streams, 4:2:0 chroma subsampling, 25 fps 3D formats, support for the 21:9 aspect ratio, dynamic synchronization of video and audio streams, the HE-AAC and DRA audio standards, improved 3D capability, and additional CEC functions.|$|E
50|$|The {{internal}} {{capability of}} <b>the</b> <b>RECs</b> varies considerably, with ECOWAS, SADC and EAC the most developed. Moreover, though <b>the</b> <b>RECs</b> are envisaged as {{the building blocks}} of the African Union, there is no clear evidence that all existing <b>RECs</b> have <b>the</b> aim of long-term continental integration in view, nor that there is the political will within all <b>the</b> <b>RECs</b> to submit regional concerns to the overriding imperatives of the Union.|$|R
5000|$|On 31 March 1990 the AEBs {{were changed}} into {{independent}} regional electricity companies (<b>RECs)</b> and <b>the</b> CEGB was split into four, three generation {{companies and the}} National Grid Company, operator of the National Grid. The National Grid Company was placed under the ownership of <b>the</b> <b>RECs.</b> On 11 December 1990 <b>the</b> <b>RECs</b> were privatised.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, event-study {{methods are}} {{used to compare the}} stock-market returns for <b>the</b> <b>RECs</b> with general stock-market returns to test the {{hypothesis}} that the regulatory package shows symptoms of capture by special interest groups over the 1991 - 95 period. The results show that some capture by <b>the</b> <b>RECs</b> may have occurred as they have earned abnormal market returns. However, regulatory events are heterogeneous in nature and actions taken over prices by the Director General of Electricity Supply (DGES) in 1995 appear to have reduced abnormal returns. As part of the study, we examine the impact on shareholders' returns of the DGES's controversial announcement in March 1995 of plans to tighten price controls on <b>the</b> <b>RECs.</b> <b>The</b> regulatory package appears to work reasonably well on balance. ...|$|R
5|$|HDMI 1.0 was {{released}} on December 9, 2002 and is a single-cable digital audio/video connector interface. The link architecture is based on DVI, using exactly the same video transmission format but sending audio and other auxiliary data during the blanking intervals of the video stream. HDMI 1.0 allows a maximum TMDS clock of 165MHz (4.95 Gbit/s), the same as DVI. It defined two connectors called Type A and Type B, with pinouts based on the Single-Link DVI-D and Dual-Link DVI-D connectors respectively, though the Type B connector was never used in any commercial products. HDMI 1.0 uses 8b/10b encoding for video transmission, giving it 3.96Gbit/s of video bandwidth (1920×1080 or 1920×1200 at 60Hz) and 8channel LPCM/192kHz/24-bit audio. HDMI 1.0 supported only 24bit/px color depth and required support for RGB video, with optional support for YCBCR 4:4:4 and 4:2:2 (mandatory if the device had support for YCBCR on other interfaces). Only <b>the</b> <b>Rec.</b> 601 and Rec. 709 color spaces were supported. HDMI 1.0 allowed only specific pre-defined video formats to be transmitted, including all the formats defined in EIA/CEA-861-B {{as well as some}} additional formats listed in the HDMI Specification itself. All HDMI sources are also required to be capable of sending or receiving native Single-Link DVI video and be fully compliant with the DVI Specification.|$|E
5|$|HDMI 1.3 was {{released}} on June 22, 2006, and increased the maximum TMDS clock to 340MHz (10.2Gbit/s). Like previous versions, it uses 8b/10b encoding, giving it a maximum video bandwidth of 8.16Gbit/s (1920×1080 at 120Hz or 2560×1440 at 60Hz). It added support for 10bpc, 12bpc, and 16bpc color depth (30, 36, and 48bit/px), called deep color. It also added support for the xvYCC color space, in addition to <b>the</b> <b>Rec.</b> 601 and Rec. 709 color spaces supported by previous versions, and added the ability to carry metadata defining color gamut boundaries. It also optionally allows output of Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio streams for external decoding by AV receivers. It incorporates automatic audio syncing (audio video sync) capability. It defined cable Categories 1 and 2, with Category 1 cable being tested up to 74.25 MHz and Category 2 being tested up to 340 MHz. It also added the new type C Mini connector for portable devices.|$|E

50|$|Article 88 of the Abuja Treaty {{states that}} the {{foundation}} of the African Economic Community is the progressive integration of the activities of <b>the</b> <b>RECs,</b> with <b>the</b> establishment of full continental economic integration as the final objective towards which the activities of existing and future RECs must be geared. A Protocol on Relations between the AEC and <b>the</b> <b>RECs</b> entered into force on 25 February 1998.|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time, it was {{recognised}} {{that the existing}} structure of <b>the</b> <b>RECs</b> was far from ideal, with many overlaps in membership. At the Maputo Summit in 2003 the AU Commission was requested to accelerate the preparation of a new draft Protocol on Relations between the African Union and <b>the</b> <b>RECs.</b> Rationalisation of <b>the</b> <b>RECs</b> formed <b>the</b> theme of the July 2006 Banjul summit of the AU. At the July 2007 Accra summit the AU Assembly adopted a Protocol on Relations between the African Union and the Regional Economic Communities. This protocol is intended to facilitate the harmonisation of policies and ensure compliance with the Abuja Treaty and Lagos Plan of Action time frames.|$|R

3000|$|Unfortunately, this {{enhancement}} may {{get lost}} when the network equipment introduces further degradations. A {{major part of}} commonly-observed degradations stems from speech codecs which are necessary to transmit the WB speech signal in an efficient way. The ITU-T currently recommends <b>the</b> ITU-T <b>Rec.</b> G. 722 [4], <b>the</b> ITU-T <b>Rec.</b> G. 722.1 [5], <b>the</b> ITU-T <b>Rec.</b> G. 722.2 [6], <b>the</b> ITU-T <b>Rec.</b> G. 729.1 [7], <b>the</b> ITU-T <b>Rec.</b> G. 718 [8] and <b>the</b> ITU-T <b>Rec.</b> G. 711.1 [9] for this purpose. Depending on the bit-rate and the coding principle, the degradation associated with each of these codecs may reduce the 29 % quality improvement, and consequently lead to a lower quality than a direct channel. The degradations due to WB speech coding are captured by a one-dimensional parameter, called WB equipment impairment factor [...]...|$|R
