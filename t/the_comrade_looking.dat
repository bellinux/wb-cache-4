50|$|You are, say, moving house. <b>The</b> worker <b>comrades</b> {{demand a}} prodigious sum to load/unload; so {{you decide to}} do it {{yourself}} with help from friends. <b>The</b> <b>comrades</b> <b>look</b> on from a distance; when you’re done, they ask to be paid the demanded wages. If you don’t pay up, there is a bit of violence and you get hurt. The revolution in Kerala says the worker must be paid even if he doesn’t work. That is a kind of workers’ paradise even Marx did not anticipate.|$|R

60|$|The {{difficulty}} remains, however. You cannot as yet {{write on}} an envelope, Smythe Johnes, Sir, or Mary Johnes, Lady; and, {{in view of}} this fact, we find ourselves no nearer the solution of our constant reader's difficulty than we were at first. The Socialists, who wish to simplify themselves and others, would address Mr. Johnes as Comrade Smythe Johnes, but could they address Mrs. Johnes as Comradess? We fancy not; besides, Comrade suggests arms and bloodshed, which is hardly {{the meaning of the}} red flag of brotherhood, and at <b>the</b> best <b>Comrade</b> <b>looks</b> affected and sounds even more so. Friend would be better, but orally, on the lips of non-Quakers, it has an effect of patronage, though no one could rightly feel slight in a letter addressed to him as Friend Smythe Johnes.|$|R

We were {{speaking}} together in this garden as the affianced do. The Empress, who, unseen by us, was hidden behind those trees, overheard our talk, which, for reasons best known to herself, for in it there was naught of treason or any matter of the State, made her so angry that she set her servants on to kill me. Thinking them murderers or robbers, I defended myself, and there they lie, save one, who fled away wounded. Then the Empress appeared and ordered me to kill <b>the</b> lady Heliodore. <b>Comrades,</b> <b>look</b> on her whom the Empress ordered me to kill, and say whether, were she your affianced, you would kill her even to please the Empress," [...] and, stepping to one side, I showed them Heliodore in all her loveliness standing against the tree, the drawn dagger in her hand.|$|R

60|$|Lyle stood close {{beside me}} quietly resolute, but {{one or two}} of his <b>comrades</b> <b>looked</b> half-ashamed and as though they wished {{themselves}} anywhere else, while the lads who rode with Carrington were manifestly uneasy.

At length Carrington indicated me with a glance which, though I was ashamed of the fact afterward, made me wince.|$|R
