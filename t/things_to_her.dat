500|$|Alexandra's letters {{reveal that}} Maria, the middle {{child of the}} family, {{sometimes}} felt insecure and left out by her older sisters and feared she wasn't loved {{as much as the}} other children. Alexandra reassured her that she was as dearly loved as her siblings. At age eleven, Maria apparently developed a painful crush on one of the young men she had met. [...] "Try not to let your thoughts dwell too much on him, that's what our Friend said," [...] Alexandra wrote to her on December 6, 1910. Alexandra advised her third daughter to keep her feelings hidden because others might say unkind <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> about her crush. [...] "One must not let others see what one feels inside, when one knows it's considered not proper. I know he likes you as a little sister and would like to help you not to care too much, because he knows you, a little Grand Duchess, must not care for him so." ...|$|E
2500|$|Our act of consecration to the Immaculate Heart of Mary refers {{ultimately}} to the Heart of her Son, for as the Mother of Christ she is wholly united to his redemptive mission. As at the marriage feast of Cana, {{when she said}} [...] "Do whatever he tells you", Mary directs all <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> Son, who answers our prayers and forgives our sins.|$|E
2500|$|The {{writer of}} Earth 2, Tom Taylor, {{specifically}} resurrected Lois Lane on Earth 2 {{after he was}} told to kill off the character in the Injustice comic series. Taylor stated [...] "bringing Lois in was quite a personal thing, because having to do such horrible, horrible <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> in Injustice, the first thing I asked when I got on the book was if I could bring back Lois. Then {{it was just a matter}} of working out exactly how." [...] Taylor received [...] "Women in Refrigerators" [...] criticism for his Injustice comic stories. Bringing back Lois as Red Tornado was Taylor's way to [...] "unfridge" [...] Lois. As Taylor noted, in Lois' first appearance as Red Tornado, Lois literally came out of a blue refrigerator. Other reasons for bringing back Lois involve Superman, Taylor commented [...] "While evil bastard Superman is out there killing and maiming and destroying, I wanted Lois to exist as the counterpoint to this. She's the beating heart at the center. She's the good Ying to Superman's evil Yang. Where there's Lois, there's hope." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "When {{the other}} chaise came down, {{the young lady}} said the same <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> brother, whose name was Charles. She said {{she was afraid to}} ride over.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, don't say that!" [...] {{said his}} housekeeper--who was also his remote cousin. For [...] "something happening" [...] was a {{euphemism}} that meant only one <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Dillahunt took {{inspiration}} from Andrew Cunanan, {{the man who}} killed Gianni Versace, when he recalled the brutality in which Cunanan murdered a man just for his car. Dillahunt recalls how an FBI profiler noted that this type of rage is typically directed toward someone the perpetrator knows, yet Cunanan managed to pull some element from his own life and place it on this random person who attempted to stand his ground against the would-be carjacker. To Dillahunt, that was how he wanted to approach Krug. To him, Mari actually shows that she is not afraid of Krug, which causes him to go [...] "crazy". That being said, the actor felt like the scene where his character rapes Mari was {{one of the hardest things}} emotionally to film. He notes that part of him was happy that Sara Paxton was cast as Mari, because they had worked together in the past, so they knew each other. On the other hand, he felt uncomfortable acting out such a scene with a person he considered to be a friend. Paxton echoed his sentiments to Craven, who stated the actress expressed to him a greater feeling of trust that the person who would have to do these [...] "horrible" [...] <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> was someone she knew, and as a result made them at least partially more bearable to act.|$|E
6000|$|... "To be--to {{be kind to}} Clara. Don't say cruel <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> She has a high spirit, and {{she feels}} them, though she says nothing." ...|$|E
60|$|We sat in {{the room}} that was called her private dining-room, but which, in fact, was all <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> save the chamber in which she slept.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish I {{could hear}} them all," [...] said Alice, with sincerity that made Mrs. Mavering laugh as light-heartedly as Dan himself, and that seemed to suggest the nest <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|To Uncle Ab himself, as she {{had come}} to call him, she could on {{occasion}} be yielding and affectionate; but that, as Mrs. Travers took care to point out <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> was a small <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> credit.|$|R
60|$|Now Peter, {{strong as}} he was, turned faint, {{and in his}} {{agitation}} let go her hand which she lifted, the violets still between her fingers, considering it {{as though it were}} a new <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{ought to}} have {{told her he was}} engaged. He {{ought to have}} {{explained}} <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> Perhaps even now {{he might be able to}} drop her a hint.|$|E
6000|$|... "Have you {{forgotten}} {{my cousin}} so soon?" [...] Gertrude asked one day, {{as she was}} walking with the happy Captain in the park. The Captain, no doubt, had been saying soft <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
6000|$|THE CREED It is copyrighted. I do {{not know}} why, but I suppose it is to keep adventurers from some day {{claiming}} that they invented it, and not Mrs. Eddy and that [...] "strange Providence" [...] that has suggested so many clever <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|VALENTINE (with growing impetuosity). Yes: I. I {{sat next}} to her; and I never said a single <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> the whole time---couldn't think of a blessed word. And not a word did she say to me.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was a new}} <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> {{hear that}} this was a danger, but, in an {{offended}} manner, she replied, 'I can hardly be accused of that. He ceases all rational talk about his most important concerns to go to child's play with her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They went {{soon after}} Mrs. Leland got away," [...] he said. [...] "I feel that I {{ought to make}} excuses for leaving the <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> though I'm not sure that there was, {{in view of the}} circumstances, any other course open to me." ...|$|R
60|$|That {{is among}} my very {{earliest}} impressions. That, {{and a sense}} that we were both a little afraid of Peggotty, and submitted ourselves in most <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> direction, were among the first opinions--if they may be so called--that I ever derived from what I saw.|$|E
6000|$|... "How do I know if she's an artist? She won't {{open her}} mouth to me; what she wants is to make me say <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> She does make me--I don't know how--and she sits there gaping at me with her big eyes. They look like open pockets!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Following {{this with}} the final ease to which my {{encouragement}} directly ministered, he yet gave me, before he had quite arrived, a queer sidelong glance. [...] "Wouldn't it really be better {{if you were to}} tell me? I don't ask her myself, you see. I don't put <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> in that way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fasting," [...] he said, thoughtfully, [...] "clears and {{stimulates the}} brain. I fancy I shall {{be able to}} think out some rather special <b>things</b> <b>to</b> say <b>to</b> <b>her</b> this time." ...|$|R
60|$|His {{thoughts}} {{came back}} with a start to his wife. The evening was slipping by and he had momentous <b>things</b> <b>to</b> say <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> He went and just opened the door.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, dear! oh, dear!" [...] {{she sobbed}} softly into her pillows. It seemed a terrible <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{that one of}} her race and kin was to be married and she could not be present at the ceremony, she who had never seen a Gordon bride.|$|R
60|$|I lost my self-control. I forgot her sex, I forgot {{everything}} {{except that she}} was responsible for this unspeakable corruption. I said terrible <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> And she listened, white--calm--speechless. When I had finished she signed to the man to leave us. He hesitated, but with a more peremptory gesture she dismissed him.|$|E
60|$|They {{wondered}} {{would he}} never weary. He never wearied. Day after {{day he was}} saying the same <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> and the end was always as the beginning. They {{came back to her}} entreaty that she should be allowed to go home as certainly as they came back to the doctor's house.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, the tapetum. It didn't go. After I'd {{given the}} stuff to bleach {{the blood and}} done certain other <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> I gave the beast opium, and put her and the pillow she was {{sleeping}} on, on the apparatus. And after all the rest had faded and vanished, there remained two little ghosts of her eyes." ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{the prettiest}} <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> see <b>her</b> holding out her round, white arm; and John (oh deep, deep John!) pretending that the {{bracelet}} {{was very hard}} to fasten; it was the prettiest <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> see <b>her</b> girding on the precious little zone, and yet obliged to have assistance because her fingers were in such terrible perplexity; it was the prettiest <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> see <b>her</b> so confused and bashful, with the smiles and blushes playing brightly on her face, like the sparkling light upon the jewels; it was the prettiest thing that you would see, in the common experiences of a twelvemonth, rely upon it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Blanche {{is getting}} ready to go out with me. We mean to have a walk together. I have many <b>things</b> <b>to</b> say <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> Before we go, I have {{something}} to say to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Pat, erroneously supposing {{that silence}} meant consent, slipped an arm round Mary's waist. No man had ever yet dared {{to do such}} a <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> The indignant girl {{suddenly}} wheeled round and brought her pretty little palm down on the cow-boy's cheek with all her might--and that was considerable! ...|$|R
60|$|Nor {{was there}} much for Bertram to do--not at once. The story {{had already gone}} down to Hadley--had already been told there to her to whom it most belonged; and Bertram {{felt that it was}} not at present his {{province}} to say kind <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> or seek to soften the violence of the shock. No, not at present.|$|E
60|$|This {{was said}} quickly, {{and with a}} degree of feeling that {{surprised}} the major, who questioned Maud earnestly as to her meaning and its reasons. The latter told him she scarce knew herself; that she disliked the man's manner, had long thought his principles bad, and that Mike in his extraordinary way had said certain <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> to awaken distrust.|$|E
60|$|Even in the {{children}} before her {{she could see the}} inherited results of fruitless labor--and, more pitiful yet, in the bent shoulders of the older ones she could see the beginnings of deformity that would soon be permanent. And as these things came to her, she clasped the poor wondering <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> side with a convulsive wish to make life a little brighter for them.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] he said, gloomily, [...] "I didn't go to no station. I walked {{here all}} the way from Shelbyville. I thought it might seem more like the square <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> for me <b>to</b> do. I sent HIM by express ahead in the box. It's been at the stage office all day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't face her--unless {{you will}} help me by {{breaking}} the <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> first. I'll stick at no sacrifice to serve you; but--hang it!--make allowances, Geoffrey, for the difficulty you are putting me in. I am almost a stranger; I don't know how Miss Silvester may receive me, before I can open my lips." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was no use}} putting <b>things</b> prettily <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{when she}} snapped you up in this way.|$|R
