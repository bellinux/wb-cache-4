5|$|The Marshall Court (18011835) issued {{some of the}} {{earliest}} and most influential opinions by the Supreme Court of the United States on the status of aboriginal title in the United States, several of them written by Chief Justice John Marshall himself. However, without exception, <b>the</b> <b>remarks</b> of the Court on aboriginal title during this period are dicta.|$|E
5|$|He {{was chosen}} to chair a {{committee}} set up in 1951 to revise {{the rules of the}} Assembly. During a session on March 21, 1952, Dawson was pushed to name Arthur Wray, MLA for Banff-Cochrane, after Wray made remarks towards a provincial official at a committee meeting. When asked by Dawson to withdraw <b>the</b> <b>remarks,</b> Wray refused, prompting Dawson to name him and order his removal from the chamber. A unanimous motion was later passed to suspend Wray for two sitting days, or until he withdrew his remarks and delivered an apology to the chamber. Wray returned four days later, issuing an apology and retracting his remarks.|$|E
5|$|Hogarth {{exhibited}} the painting at the Society of Artists in Spring Gardens in 1761. Although press reports – perhaps placed by Hogarth {{and his supporters}} – were enthusiastic, Sigismunda mourning over the Heart of Guiscardo was attacked by critics who marked Hogarth's attempt to emulate the drama depicted in older Italian paintings as foolhardy and ridiculous. Many critics were repulsed by the shocking contrast between the melancholy beauty of Sigismunda and the grotesquely bloody organ that she delicately touched. It was said that Hogarth placed an attendant next to the painting to note <b>the</b> <b>remarks</b> made by the viewers; changes to the painting suggest {{that he may have}} responded to these criticisms by altering his work, although it is impossible to ascertain whether many of the changes were made before or after the painting was exhibited.|$|E
50|$|Whether <b>the</b> <b>remark</b> {{attributed}} to Half Yellow Face {{was made on}} the morning of June 25, 1876 through an interpreter or by sign language, two things about it are true. First, <b>the</b> <b>remark,</b> though possessing poetic power, probably made no impression on Custer who continued with his plan to divide his troops into separate units and attack the Sioux/Cheyenne encampment. Second <b>the</b> <b>remark</b> was remarkably prophetic for Custer and the five troops of cavalry who went with him.|$|R
50|$|Bush {{subsequently}} {{apologized to}} France for <b>the</b> <b>remark.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Duterte later {{apologized for}} the {{incident}} and acknowledged the comment as a [...] "bad remark" [...] saying he regretted his [...] "gutter language" [...] but would not apologize for what he said. He insists though that <b>the</b> <b>remark</b> was not a [...] "joke" [...] as reported by some media outlets, saying that he stated it in a narrative. He further {{said that he was}} not apologizing for stating <b>the</b> <b>remark</b> reasoning that he made <b>the</b> <b>remark</b> out of [...] "utter anger" [...] when he recalled the events that followed prior to that hostage taking incident.|$|R
5|$|Staszic was a keen {{observer}} of {{the proceedings of the}} Great Sejm, spending much time in Warsaw since the Sejm began its deliberations in 1788. He continued publishing new books and pamphlets. His Warnings for Poland, coming from the current European politics and natural laws, by the writer of <b>the</b> <b>remarks</b> upon the life of Jan Zamoyski (Przestrogi dla Polski z teraźniejszych politycznych Europy związków i z praw natury wypadające przez pisarza uwag nad życiem Jana Zamoyskiego, 1790), together with his previous Remarks, are considered among the most influential works of the Polish Enlightenment. In Warnings, he criticised the magnates of Poland and Lithuania, monastic orders and serfdom, and supported the enfranchisement of the townsfolk. Although he was not a participant of the Sejm, he was an influential onlooker, and through his widely read and discussed writings of the time is {{recognized as one of the}} founding fathers of the Constitution of May 3, 1791.|$|E
5|$|It {{was a brief}} stint back in {{the playing}} squad, with Barton banned for six matches, with a further {{suspended}} six-match ban, for his assault on Dabo. After serving his ban, he played 75minutes in a reserve match and {{said he wanted to}} transform his image to become a role model, before he returned to action in the Tyne–Wear derby on 25 October. He was booed by Sunderland fans and had missiles thrown at him as he warmed up, as Newcastle lost 2–1. Without him, Newcastle had not recorded a league victory since the second match of the season, but Barton scored a penalty in his second match back to lift the club out of the relegation zone. The suspended six-match ban was nearly brought into action when Barton appeared to flick Aston Villa striker Gabriel Agbonlahor in the club's next match, but the FA decided not to punish Barton. However, further allegations that Barton had made a racist remark to Agbonlahor were cause enough for the FA to reconsider this decision. <b>The</b> <b>remarks</b> remain unfounded and 'professional lip-readers' claimed he said nothing racist. In Newcastle's 2–2 draw with Wigan on 15 November 2008, Barton was injured after a tackle from Lee Cattermole. It was later confirmed that Barton would be out for two months with a medial ligament injury. Returning to the first team at the end of January, he played only twice before again breaking his metatarsal, during a 2–1 defeat to his old club Manchester City.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, using {{parliamentary}} privilege, Democratic Unionist Party MP Iris Robinson {{claimed that}} Adams {{was involved in}} the IRA's 1978 La Mon restaurant bombing. Adams denied the allegation and said <b>the</b> <b>remarks</b> were made to deflect attention away from developments in the Stevens Inquiry into collusion.|$|E

25|$|The {{magistrate}} court later {{affirmed that}} there was clear {{evidence to show that}} some officers {{who took part in the}} investigation conducted by the local police and Crime Branch wanted to refer this case as a case of suicide. <b>The</b> <b>remarks</b> were later expunged by the High Court.|$|E
