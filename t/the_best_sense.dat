British journalist Simon Rose, writing for The Daily Mirror was more critical of the film, saying that it failed to break the odd-numbered Star Trek film curse, and that it was [...] "feeble", [...] "moribund" [...] and [...] "tedious". However, Josh Spiegel writing for The Buffalo News said that Insurrection broke the odd-numbered film rule. Further criticism came from the Birmingham Evening Mail, which said that it was [...] "an adult form of entertainment equivalent to Teletubbies for babies", and that there were [...] "lots of repetition, rubbery faces, gibberish dialogue, characters leaping up and down in funny suits and some very basic effects". The reviewer gave the film two stars for fans, and none for non-fans. In Folklore/Cinema: Popular Film as Vernacular Culture, the actions of Data and the Ba'ku child Artim in Insurrection are seen as [...] "a metamorphosis motif where a child becomes computerlike and a computer/android becomes more childlike". Data specifically [...] "is a metaphor for a child who seeks to understand what being human means and then, like the velveteen rabbit, wishes to become. From confronting his father and evil brother to finding his mother, Data also represents the potential within all of us to quest for a fuller humanity".|$|E

30|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a cluster-based {{selective}} CSS scheme which utilizes an efficient selective method for <b>the</b> <b>best</b> quality <b>sensing</b> data and a parallel reporting mechanism. The selective method, {{which is usually}} adopted in cooperative communications [14, 15], is applied in each cluster to implicitly select <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>sensing</b> node during each sensing interval as the cluster header without additional collaboration among CUs. The parallel reporting mechanism based on frequency division is considered to strongly reduce the reporting time of the cluster decision. In the FC, the optimal Chair-Vashney rule (CV rule) is utilized to obtain a high sensing performance based on the available cluster’s signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this way, the proposed cooperative sensing will be performed with an extremely low cooperation resource while a certain high level of sensing performance is ensured.|$|R

Charles also helped Louis De Geer to carry through his reform of the Parliament of Sweden in 1866.

The Arabian Board he set up was expressly ‘undenominational.’ He is able to praise Popes Gregory VII and Innocent III. He longed for the day Orthodox churches would join in with Muslim evangelism. His opening editorial for The Moslem World stated that it aimed ‘to represent no faction or fraction of the Church, but to be broad in <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>sense</b> of the word.’ His slogan was: ‘In essentials it seeks unity, in non-essentials liberty, and in all things charity.’ Yet, he was clear and precise about what the essentials were.

2500|$|Nolan {{compared}} Interstellar to The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948), as a {{film about}} human nature. He also sought to emulate films like Steven Spielberg's Jaws (1975) and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). He stated: [...] "When you say you're making a family film, it has all these pejorative connotations that it'll be somehow soft. But when I was a kid, these were family films in <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>sense,</b> and they were as edgy and incisive and challenging as anything else on the blockbuster spectrum. I wanted to bring that back in some way." [...] He also cited the space drama The Right Stuff (1983) as an example to follow and screened it for the crew before production. To emulate that film, he sought to capture reflection on the Interstellar astronauts' visors. For further inspiration grounded in real-world space travel, the director also invited former astronaut Marsha Ivins to the set. Nolan and his crew studied the IMAX NASA documentaries of filmmaker Toni Myers for visual reference of spacefaring missions, and sought to emulate the look of their use of IMAX cameras in the enclosed spaces of a spacecraft interior.|$|E

For example, Nursultan Nazarbayev was categorically opposed to the dissolution of the Soviet Union and he said so openly proposing various formulas for preserving the state within the common borders.

Greg McElhatton of Read About Comics liked the manga's tense situations, but felt that the second half was slow with a weak ending, and said that Tatsumi's art is [...] "blocky and crude in places, but there's an energy about it that helps propel those early pages forward." [...] Connie C. of Comic Book Resources described it as a [...] "very straightforward crime story, [...] is well told, but doesn't get much more elaborate", but called it a [...] "beautiful example" [...] of a pulp short story. Tom Spurgeon called the manga [...] "a fun but rough work, full of character types and situations entirely too on the nose to reflect the nuances of certain moral questions brought to bear", especially disliking the ending and saying of the art: [...] "the best scenes in Black Blizzard have a physical immediacy that only arises from fundamentally solid cartooning with a corresponding attention to movement". Publishers Weekly called the story and layouts simple, and the art sometimes crude, but [...] "with a cinematic use of perspective, intensified via the characters and their circumstances, Tatsumi constructs a thrilling narrative with emotional depth." [...] Michelle Smith of Comic Book Resources said that the manga is [...] "a quick and fun hard-boiled adventure yarn", feeling that the story was [...] "silly" [...] and Shinpei's connection [...] "too convenient", but complimenting the [...] "fast-paced narrative" [...] and finding the rough art to suit the characters. The A.V. Club described the manga as a [...] "head-spinning blur of hardboiled suspense", likening the climax to Mickey Spillane's work, and calling Tatsumi's early art [...] "necessarily loose and frantic". Shawn O'Rourke of PopMatters compared the story's nervous tension to EC Comics stories and said that the art [...] "while simplistic, conveys a depth and nuance that engages the reader", adding that [...] "unwieldy exposition or narrative declarations" [...] are avoided, and that the manga [...] "is still eminently enjoyable in a way that so many of dated classics of that era are not."

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we present new {{results on the}} problem of finding <b>the</b> <b>best</b> channel <b>sensing</b> order for {{multi-channel}} Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) networks. We start with the general assumption that all Secondary Users (SUs) cooperatively sense each Primary User (PU) channel at one time. Then, the SU sensing results are reported to a DSA base station that schedules SU transmissions in order to maximize DSA network throughput. We then assume that PU traffic parameters are not perfectly known to DSA network and change over time, and propose a novel PU channel sensing order scheme based on the quality of PU traffic estimation. We adopt a maximum likelihood estimator to estimate the traffic statistics of PU channels and derive the Cramér-Rao (CR) bounds for the PU traffic estimation performance. Based on the CR bound and its Gaussian approximation, we analyze the impact of the estimation error on the DSA network throughput by computing a new metric called sensing order confidence, i. e., the probability that <b>the</b> <b>best</b> selected <b>sensing</b> order is not affected by PU traffic estimation errors. Finally, we formulate a convex optimization problem to determine the minimum number of PU channel state samples required for estimating PU traffic parameters after determining a certain constraint on the sensing order confidence metric to achieve <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>sensing</b> order. Index Terms—Dynamic spectrum access networks, channel sensing order, throughput maximization, traffic estimation, sens-ing order confidence, convex optimization. I...|$|R
