5|$|Diffusion {{may also}} have had a {{significant}} effect on the evolution of primordial cosmic magnetic fields, fields which may have been amplified over time to become galactic magnetic fields. However, these cosmic magnetic fields may have been damped by radiative diffusion: just as acoustic oscillations in the plasma were damped by <b>the</b> <b>diffusion</b> <b>of</b> photons, so were magnetosonic waves (waves of ions travelling through a magnetised plasma). This process began before the era of neutrino decoupling and ended at the time of recombination.|$|E

5|$|Chromium metal left {{standing}} in air is passivated by oxidation, forming a thin, protective, surface layer. This layer is a spinel structure {{only a few}} molecules thick. It is very dense, and prevents <b>the</b> <b>diffusion</b> <b>of</b> oxygen into the underlying metal. This {{is different from the}} oxide that forms on iron and carbon steel, through which elemental oxygen continues to migrate, reaching the underlying material to cause incessant rusting. Passivation can be enhanced by short contact with oxidizing acids like nitric acid. Passivated chromium is stable against acids. Passivation can be removed with a strong reducing agent that destroys the protective oxide layer on the metal. Chromium metal treated in this way readily dissolves in weak acids.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{regeneration}} of a solid, {{crystallized cellulose}} solution in a N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMMO) -water mixture was studied by measuring <b>the</b> <b>diffusion</b> coefficient <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> water uptake from the regenerating bath and the NMMO outflow to this bath. <b>The</b> <b>diffusion</b> coefficient <b>of</b> water {{going to the}} cellulose solution is about 10 times larger than <b>the</b> <b>diffusion</b> coefficient <b>of</b> NMMO leaving the solution. This difference expresses the strongly hygroscopic character of NMMO. None of these coefficients depends on cellulose molecular weight showing that no major rearrangement of cellulose chains occurs at the beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regeneration. <b>The</b> <b>diffusion</b> coefficient <b>of</b> water is not influenced by the cellulose concentration, whereas <b>the</b> <b>diffusion</b> coefficient <b>of</b> NMMO decreases strongly when the cellulose concentration increases.

The fact that the script was not otherwise observed by early explorers, who spent little time on the island, may reflect that it was taboo; such taboos may have lost power along with the tangata rongorongo (scribes) by the time Rapanui society collapsed following European slaving raids and the resulting epidemics, so that the tablets had become more widely distributed by Eyraud's day. Orliac points out that Tablet C would appear to predate the Spanish visit by at least a century.|$|E
