Eric Bischoff agreed with Hogan's {{side of the story}} when he wrote that Hogan winning and leaving with the belt was a work (devised by Bischoff rather than Russo), and that he and Hogan celebrated after the event over the success of the angle, but that Russo coming out to fire Hogan was an unplanned shoot which led to the lawsuit filed by Hogan. It was the last time he was seen in WCW.|$|E
25|$|Carpenter had {{intended}} Richard Dreyfuss as Andy McGee, but when The <b>Thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> financial disappointment, Universal replaced Carpenter with Mark L. Lester. Ironically, Carpenter's next film, Christine, was the 1983 {{adaptation of the}} Stephen King novel of the same name. The story concerns a high-school nerd named Arnie Cunningham (Keith Gordon) who buys a junked 1958 Plymouth Fury {{which turns out to}} have supernatural powers. As Cunningham restores and rebuilds the car, he becomes unnaturally obsessed with it, with deadly consequences. Christine did respectable business upon its release and was received well by critics; however, Carpenter has been quoted as saying he directed the film {{because it was the only}} thing offered to him at the time.|$|E

Taylor claimed to have married Lymon in Mexico in 1965 although their relationship ended several months later, purportedly because of Lymon's drug habits. Lymon, however, had been known to say that their marriage was a publicity stunt, and Taylor could produce no legal documentation of their marriage.

25|$|In Season 2, Lucas and Keith {{return to}} Tree Hill after Dan {{has a heart}} attack. Lucas tries {{to make up for}} his {{behavior}} with Peyton and Brooke and becomes friends with both of them. He also starts seeing a new girl named Anna Taggaro, but they break up amicably when Anna accepts that she is a lesbian. Lucas realizes that he has romantic feelings for Brooke and begins to focus on building on a relationship with her, even though she is seeing Anna's brother Felix. Lucas discovers that he has inherited Dan's heart condition, but does not tell anyone except Dan. After discovering that Keith's new girlfriend Jules was actually hired by Dan to break Keith's heart, Lucas agrees to move in with Dan if he leaves Keith alone and pays for Lucas's heart medication. This sets Lucas at odds with his mother, as she cannot believe that Lucas would want to live with Dan rather than her. It also causes a new rift between Lucas and Nathan, as Nathan feels that Lucas is replacing him and is bitter about Haley's departure to go on tour singing. Lucas and Karen are reconciled when she learns half of the reason he is staying with Dan, which is to protect Keith. This plan to protect his uncle fails when Jules leaves Keith at the altar and Keith leaves town after discovering that Lucas and Karen knew that she was hired by Dan. Lucas discovers Deb's painkiller addiction and decides to avenge all of Dan's victims. He finds a stash of cash and an incriminating ledger in the attic at Dan's dealership and plans to expose Dan's illegal dealings, but ultimately fails as Dan has also incriminated Deb. Dan then reveals that the whole <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> set-up to test Lucas's loyalty, which Lucas failed. As a result, he loses Dan's college fund for him (which Dan had been saving since Lucas was a baby) and even his heart medication. Nathan also ends his friendship with Lucas after discovering that Lucas had planned to bring Dan down and visited Haley behind his back in an attempt to patch up her and Nathan's marriage. Lucas does, however, kiss Brooke in the season finale and confesses that he wants to be with her, but she still leaves for California to spend the summer with her parents. Ultimately, it is just Lucas and a broken-hearted Peyton (after boyfriend Jake left her) for the summer and the last shot is {{of the two of them}} sharing a meaningful hug on the beach.|$|E
500|$|The {{hearing was}} dramatized in a 1964 play by German playwright Heinar Kipphardt, In the Matter of J. Robert Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer {{objected to the}} play, {{threatening}} suit [...] and decrying [...] "improvisations which were contrary to history and {{to the nature of}} the people involved", including its portrayal of him as viewing the bomb as a [...] "work of the devil". His letter to Kipphardt said, [...] "You may well have forgotten Guernica, Dachau, Coventry, Belsen, Warsaw, Dresden and Tokyo. I have not."

500|$|Deriving from [...] "the biting {{humor of}} Ray Davies and the {{bitterness}} of Paul Weller", Albarn's lyrics on Modern Life Is Rubbish are a social commentary and satire on contemporary suburban English life. While Rubbish celebrates modern British life, it also takes a cynical look at middle-class existence. The overt Anglo-centricism of the album was also retaliation against American popular culture; James later explained, [...] "it was f***ing scary how American everything's becoming ... so the whole <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> f***ing big two fingers up to America". NME summarised {{the theme of the}} [...] "thinly-veiled concept album" [...] as a [...] "London odyssey crammed full of strange commuters, peeping Thomases and lost dreams; of opening the windows and breathing in petrol ... It's the Village Green Preservation Society come home to find a car park in its place".|$|E

Before leaving, Elphaba regrets that she'll never see Glinda again and tell her that she and Fiyero are alive. Simultaneously, returning to the musical's starting point, Glinda reports to the people of Oz that the Wicked Witch of the West has been killed and promises to properly earn her title as Glinda the Good.

That night on Raw, Hardy attacked Edge backstage and again later during Edge's match with Kane, leaving the commentators speechless. Before being escorted out of the building by security, Hardy stated that Edge and Lita would pay for their actions and told fans that they could see him at Ring of Honor while security officials and event staff were trying to restrain him. Hardy also called out Johnny Ace as security had him in handcuffs taking him out of the arena. This caused an uproar amongst fans, who were confused and wondered if the whole <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> work or a shoot. Similar occurrences repeated during the following two weeks.|$|E
500|$|Shane Hegarty of The Irish Times {{wrote that}} it [...] "may {{not have been}} a vintage episode [...] but it had plenty of good moments, and from an Irish {{perspective}} it was a fascinating opportunity to see ourselves {{through the eyes of the}} greatest comedy series ever written." [...] He added that [...] "even as it reveled in stereotypes, it used them to continue the running joke about how Ireland doesn't conform to American's [...] views of it." [...] Pat Stacey of the Evening Herald gave the episode two stars. He wrote that he enjoyed the jokes about the Irish landmarks but called it [...] "a fairly slapdash, ramshackle half-hour" [...] and mentioned that Colm Meaney deserved a better role. Evan Fanning of the Sunday Independent wrote [...] "Yes, The Simpsons came to Ireland and all we got was some lousy rehashed jokes and a feeling that the whole <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> bit of a waste of time." ...|$|E

500|$|While writing [...] "Tabula Rasa", Damon Lindelof {{suggested}} that John Locke {{was in a}} wheelchair {{before going to the}} island, and {{while the rest of the}} writing team initially reacted with shock, they embraced the idea. Lindelof wanted to embrace how [...] "what you think these people are is actually entirely different", particularly since [...] "Tabula Rasa" [...] did not have many developments on Kate's backstory or why she was a fugitive, [...] "the Locke <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> huge, big, reveal". To enhance the plot twist, all the flashbacks were shot in a way that disguised the presence of a wheelchair. In the scene where Locke is sitting in his bed, the paralysis is alluded by the electromedical nerve stimulation machine on his nightstand. Lindelof also created a title for the episode, [...] "Lord of the Files", a pun on Lord of the Flies and Locke's off-island occupation, but the writers had already settled on [...] "Walkabout".|$|E
500|$|Rotten, meanwhile, {{suffering}} from flu and coughing up blood, felt increasingly isolated from Cook and Jones, and disgusted by Vicious. On 14 January 1978, during the tour's final date at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco, a disillusioned Rotten introduced the band's encore saying, [...] "You'll get one number and one number only 'cause I'm a lazy bastard." [...] That one number was a Stooges cover, [...] "No Fun". At {{the end of}} the song, Rotten, kneeling on the stage, chanted an unambiguous declaration, [...] "This is no fun. No fun. This is no fun—at all. No fun." [...] As the final cymbal crash died away, Rotten addressed the audience directly—"Ah-ha-ha. Ever get the feeling you've been cheated? Good night"—before throwing down his microphone and walking offstage. He later observed, [...] "I felt cheated, and I wasn't going on with it any longer; it was a ridiculous farce. Sid was completely out of his brains—just a waste of space. The whole <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> joke at that point.... wouldn't speak to me.... He would not discuss anything with me.

500|$|As {{the crowds}} outside the stadium {{continued}} to grow, local police stations were mobilised, {{but by the}} time officers arrived the crowd was too large for them to take any effective form of action. At 2:15pm, the crowds outside the stadium rushed at the barriers and forced their way in. Spectators in the lower tiers had to climb the fences to escape the crush and overflowed onto the pitch itself. Spectator Terry Hickey said later that [...] "To put it mildly, the whole <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> bloody shambles". The crowd was officially reported as 126,047, but estimates of the actual number of fans in attendance range from 150,000 to over 300,000. [...] The FA refunded 10% of the total gate money to fans who had pre-purchased tickets but were unable to reach their assigned seats. [...] The roads around the stadium were blocked and the Bolton players were forced to abandon their coach a mile from the stadium and make their way through the crowds. The Times stated that at one point it seemed impossible that the match would ever be able to start, but that when King George V arrived, the mood of the crowd changed. After enthusiastically singing [...] "God Save The King", the crowd began to assist the authorities in clearing the playing area.|$|E

500|$|The {{tour of the}} United States faced various troubles. Ament {{said that}} the band and its crew had to [...] " [...] shows from the ground up, a venue {{everywhere}} we went." [...] In June 1995, the band was scheduled to play at San Francisco, California's Golden Gate Park in front of 50,000 people. Before the concert Vedder was forced to stay at a hospital after suffering {{from the effects of}} food poisoning. Vedder left the hospital to play the show, however {{he was not able to}} finish and ended up performing just seven out of twenty-one songs with the band. Neil Young filled in for Vedder for the rest of the show that day. Vedder said, [...] "That whole [...] <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> blur based on some bad food. It was really, really bad. Looking back at it, it doesn't seem as intense as it was, but it was horrible. I just felt not human and looking back I should have got through that show somehow, and I think the fact that Neil [...] was there made me feel like I could get off the hook in some way and I did go out for a few songs." [...] Because of Vedder's health the band was forced to cancel the remaining dates of its tour of the United States. Some dates were reinstated while the rest were rescheduled for the fall. About canceling the dates, Vedder said, [...] "I think we all agreed that it had gotten insane, that it was no longer about the music." [...] Ament later said, [...] "We were so hardheaded about the 1995 tour. Had to prove we could tour on our own, and it pretty much killed us, killed our career." ...|$|E
