Around 1860, psychology was finding its scientific foundation mainly in Germany, with the rigorous research of Hermann von Helmholtz (1821-1894), who had trained as a physicist, and of Wilhelm Wundt (1832-1920). They focused their work mainly in the area of sensory psychophysiology, because it was the most rewarding for <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> <b>based</b> on the paradigms of experimental physics. Both worked at the University of Heidelberg. In 1864 Bain prompted Ferrier to spend some time in their laboratories.|$|E

50|$|Since {{early this}} century, the {{technology}} has been available to allow a company to reliably achieve next-best-action capabilities in high volumes {{as well as in}} real-time. Typically, this requires a multi-channel, centralized decisioning authority that dispenses all decisions with regard to the customer (see Enterprise decision management). This “decisioning hub” leverages “decision logic” that combines the company’s business rules with predictive and adaptive (aka self-learning) decisioning models to help determine how to approach a customer prior to as well as during an interaction. The decisioning authority takes into account each customer’s expectations, propensities and likely behavior through the use of predictive modeling. Interfaces that can leverage this intelligence must also be in place to externalize the logic and guide an agent (or the system itself) in how the customer would prefer to be treated at any given moment, continuously recalibrating <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> <b>based</b> on customer responses.

5000|$|Targowski {{found some}} {{difficulties}} in designing information systems {{for business and}} administration {{who did not know}} the meaning of information. The quantitative theory of information (formulated by Hartley and Shannon) defines information as I = -Log2 p(α). In business activities, if someone on Tuesday says that tomorrow is Wednesday, p=1 and then I=0. However, on Wednesday there may be a discount at a given store, what is very meaningful for an information user. He thinks that the traditional theory of information mostly deals with its syntax in a general sense, answering the question: how to process information?. Therefore, he developed <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> <b>based</b> upon its semantics, which means answering the question what information to process? He invented the concept of the Semantic Ladder, composed of the following units of cognition, organized as steps (levels); 1-DATA (measurement), 2-INFORMATION (change), 3-CONCEPT (direction), 4-KNOWLEDGE (principles, rules, laws), 5-WISDOM (judgment & choice). First time he published this DICKW model in his book The Architecture and Planning of Enterprise-wide Information Management Systems (1990:136), consequently he began to improving its graphic model in his following books (2003:115, 2009:223, 2011:27). In his book (2009) he defined several perspectives and images of information. This approach defines the differentiated frameworks of IS design in the scope of data processing, information processing, concept processing, knowledge processing, and wisdom processing. He also differentiated approaches to information's conceptualization {{at the level of the}} macro-information ecology. It allowed him to define four universal laws of information: ...|$|E
