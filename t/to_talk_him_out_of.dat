5|$|Lesnar's next {{opponent}} was Big Show and Heyman {{was convinced}} {{more than anyone}} that Lesnar could not win, trying <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> defending the title. Lesnar refused and defended the title against Show at Survivor Series on November 17, Lesnar performed an F-5 on Show, but Heyman pulled the referee out of the ring, voiding the pinfall. This allowed Show to chokeslam Lesnar on a steel chair to win the title. This loss was Lesnar's first pinfall loss in WWE and led Lesnar {{to turn into a}} fan favorite. Following Survivor Series, Heyman made it clear that Lesnar would not get a rematch, and had snuck a special clause saying so into his contract. In order to gain his revenge on Big Show and Heyman, Lesnar interfered in his first title defense, which came against Kurt Angle the next month at Armageddon on December 15, where Lesnar executed the F-5 on Big Show, which enabled Angle to pin him and win the title. On the following episode of SmackDown!, however, Angle introduced Heyman as his manager and, despite promising Lesnar a title shot earlier in the evening, declared that Lesnar still would not get it. Lesnar's rivalry with Heyman and Big Show resumed, which culminated in a match at the Royal Rumble in January 2003 with the winner being placed into the Royal Rumble later in the evening. On January 19, Lesnar would defeat Show and entered the Royal Rumble match as the No. 29 entry, the second to last competitor to enter the match. He eliminated Matt Hardy and The World's Greatest Tag Team, which was composed of Charlie Haas and his former OVW teammate Shelton Benjamin, who were mentored by Angle. Lesnar would then eliminate The Undertaker last and win the Royal Rumble, which guaranteed him a title match at WrestleMania XIX. After the Royal Rumble, Lesnar and Chris Benoit defeated Angle, Haas and Benjamin at No Way Out on February 23. During the match at WrestleMania XIX on March 30, Lesnar botched a shooting star press, a move he had done numerous times in developmental matches, and jammed his head and neck. This stunned Lesnar and forced Angle and Lesnar to improvise the finish of the match – a pinfall by Lesnar that allowed him to win his second WWE Championship. Lesnar was diagnosed with a concussion from the botched shooting star press.|$|E

The show's final season was placed on hiatus after the cliffhanger episode, and did not return until May 23, 1999, {{a year after the}} season finale aired.

He brings Grampa to a plane hidden in the jungle which he turned into a secret nightclub, where such nefarious types as drug lords and the founder of Ticketmaster (who is the only person everyone immediately punches in the face) are enjoying their exiles. Seeing how much fun life is there Grampa decides he wants to stay in Cuba. The Simpsons family tries <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> it.

25|$|The main feud on the SmackDown brand {{was between}} Brock Lesnar and The Big Show over the WWE Championship. Lesnar won the title three months prior at SummerSlam by {{defeating}} then-champion The Rock. Two months later at No Mercy, Lesnar defeated The Undertaker in a Hell in a Cell match {{to retain the}} title, pinning him after an F-5. On the October 24 edition of SmackDown, after claiming nobody on SmackDown could defeat him, Big Show was traded to SmackDown, immediately issuing a challenge to WWE Champion Brock Lesnar, who accepted later that night. Later that night, after Lesnar and Undertaker cut promos to one another, the Big Show threw Undertaker off the stage, thus injuring his neck. The next week on SmackDown!, Lesnar faced off against Rey Mysterio, which ended in a no contest after Big Show interfered and tossed Mysterio into the crowd. Shortly after the match ended, Big Show slammed Lesnar through the announce table. On the November 8 edition of SmackDown, after Lesnar defeated Eddie Guerrero in a non-title match, Big Show attacked Lesnar and slammed him off the stage. The following week on SmackDown, Lesnar's manager Paul Heyman was convinced more than anyone that Lesnar could not win, trying <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> defending the title.
