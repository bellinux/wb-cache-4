5000|$|The term <b>taikonaut</b> {{is used by}} some English-language {{news media}} {{organizations}} for professional space travelers from China. [...] The word has featured in the Longman and Oxford English dictionaries, the latter of which describes it as [...] "a hybrid of the Chinese term taikong (space) and the Greek naut (sailor)"; the term became more common in 2003 when China sent its first astronaut Yang Liwei into space aboard the Shenzhou 5 spacecraft. [...] This is the term used by Xinhua News Agency in the English version of the Chinese People's Daily {{since the advent of}} the Chinese space program. [...] The origin of the term is unclear; as early as May 1998, Chiew Lee Yih (...) from Malaysia, used it in newsgroups.|$|E
40|$|Various cultural-specific {{names and}} labels are {{assigned}} to someone who travels to space. Some familiar names include: astronaut, cosmonaut, <b>taikonaut,</b> yu hang yuan ("space navigating personnel"), vyomanaut, as well as citizen astronaut, civilian astronaut, space tourist and spaceflight participant. This paper addresses what is in a name? We ask, what are the philosophical and cultural values that are applied in identifying &# 039;astronaut&# 039;? More importantly, why are we identifying them accordingly by these monikers? What {{are the implications of}} these labels, on a social, moral and legal level? Moreover, how do spacefaring individuals identify themselves in comparison with popular perceptions? By identifying selected poetic, cultural and legal definitions and terminologies we seek to answer these questions and highlight relevant distinctions and connections between the contextual spheres and definitions. &# 039;Intersubjectivity&# 039; is also reviewed as an approach for formulating future categories and definitions of &# 039;astronauts&# 039;. Cumulatively, these terms and definitions serve to address pertinent legal, ethical and social implications and consequences for space-faring individuals at the advent of the Commercial Space Age...|$|E
50|$|A song 'Oberammergau' by UK {{musician}} Christopher Rye (featuring Chinese {{rock band}} <b>Taikonauts)</b> {{is based on}} a reference in the book Dark Side of the Moon by Gerard de Groot, to Oberammergau being the destination for the rocket scientists fleeing Nazi Germany {{at the end of the}} Second World War, who then helped build the US space programme.|$|R
5000|$|Wanderers {{does not}} specify {{whether any of}} the space explorers it depicts are governmentally-sponsored astronauts, cosmonauts, or <b>taikonauts,</b> if they are {{alternately}} commercial astronauts, space flight participants, or solely space tourists. Wernquist calls them simply [...] "passengers", [...] "people," [...] and [...] "hikers," [...] {{and none of the}} spacecraft transporting them carry the insignia of a space agency or a privately funded space enterprise. Regardless of their official designation, the people shown in the two Jupiter scenes and the one scene showcasing Uranus and its moon Miranda must be referred to as [...] "adventurers." ...|$|R
40|$|The People’s Republic of China {{successfully}} completed its second human spaceflight mission on October 17, 2005. China {{is only the}} third country, after Russia and the United States, able to launch people into space. Its first human spaceflight was in 2003 when a single astronaut, or “taikonaut,” made a flight lasting slightly less than a day. The 2005 flight lasted five days, and involved two <b>taikonauts.</b> As the United States embarks upon President Bush’s “Vision for Space Exploration” to return astronauts to the Moon by 2020 and someday send them to Mars, some may view China’s entrance into the human exploration of space as a competitive threat, while others may view China as a potential partner...|$|R
