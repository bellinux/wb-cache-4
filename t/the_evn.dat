50|$|There {{are several}} VLBI arrays located in Europe, Canada, the United States, Russia, Korea, Japan, Mexico and Australia. The most {{sensitive}} VLBI array {{in the world}} is the European VLBI Network (EVN). This is a part-time array which brings together the largest European radiotelescopes for typically week-long sessions, with the data being processed at the Joint Institute for VLBI in Europe (JIVE). The Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) uses ten dedicated, 25-meter telescopes spanning 5351 miles across the United States, and is the largest VLBI array that operates all year round as both an astronomical and geodesy instrument. The combination of <b>the</b> <b>EVN</b> and VLBA is known as Global VLBI. When one or both of these arrays are combined with one or more space-based VLBI antennas such as HALCA (previously) and now with RadioAstron (Spektr-R), the resolution obtained is higher than any other astronomical instrument, capable of imaging the sky with a level of detail measured in microarcseconds. VLBI generally benefits from the longer baselines afforded by international collaboration, with a notable early example in 1976, when radio telescopes in the United States, USSR and Australia were linked to observe hydroxyl-maser sources.|$|E

The 9 -GHz VLA data show an arcsecond-scale triple structure of Holmberg II X- 1 similar to that seen at lower frequencies.
