5|$|The {{majority}} of Sunni Muslims were Arab nationalists, but not Ba'athist, making <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> alienated. The party was chiefly dominated by minority {{groups such as}} Alawites, Druzes, and Isma'ilis, and people from the countryside in general; this created an urban–rural conflict based predominantly on ethnic differences. With its coming to power, the Ba'ath Party was threatened by the predominantly anti-Ba'athist sentiment in urban politics—probably the only reason why the Ba'athists managed {{to stay in power}} was the rather weakly organised and fragmented opposition it faced.|$|E
5|$|The street {{kept its}} '½' until 1906, when petitioners asked the Minneapolis City Council {{to change the}} street's name to Woodland Avenue because they said the '½' made <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> like they lived in an alley. For an unknown reason, the street's name was not changed to Woodland Avenue, but to Milwaukee Avenue. The Avenue's {{proximity}} to the Milwaukee Short Line Railroad has been suggested as a cause.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the Tour, rugby in Scotland was a game of the upper classes, and the Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) was very conservative. Their {{officials}} believed the game should remain strictly amateur, and that rugby was for the players, not the spectators. The Scottish were uncomfortable with the public interest in the All Blacks, and did not make <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> very welcome. They interpreted a letter sent to them stating that the All Blacks {{did not want to be}} entertained after their match quite literally, and the All Blacks were not invited to the after-match dinner organised by the Scottish Union. As well as this, the SRU refused to grant international caps for the game.|$|E

5|$|For grieving {{parents who}} form {{emotional}} bonds with reborn dolls, some child bereavement counselors advise against parents substituting their deceased child with the dolls. Reborn mothers contend {{that they are}} not replacing children but remembering them. Psychiatrist Sue Varma, teacher at the NYU school of medicine, says mothering reborn dolls rather than just collecting them can become a problem when it is used as prop and becomes the person's only form of socializing. Psychiatrist Gail Saltz with New York Presbyterian Hospital supports the use of reborns for people who do not want to make the commitment of having a real child, and also to comfort bereaved parents. She offers that in this case the reborn may symbolize a step in the grieving process. Concern should only come if someone who lost a baby grows too attached to their reborn because it could indicate their grief is not getting resolved. In this case, the likeness of the doll to the deceased child risks being harmful as a permanent replacement for the grieving parents. Ian James, a doctor at the Centre for the Health of the Elderly at Newcastle General Hospital in the U.K., said that holding the dolls helps calm elderly residents, helping <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> peaceful and quiet.|$|E

25|$|Elton Mayo {{found that}} the social {{contacts}} a worker has at the workplace are very important and that boredom and repetitiveness of tasks lead to reduced motivation. Mayo believed that workers could be motivated by acknowledging their social needs and making <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> important.

25|$|Because dogs often bark {{excessively}} due to stress, boredom, or frustration, changing {{aspects of}} an animal's environment {{to make them}} more content is a suitable way to quiet them down, rather than forcibly silencing a distressed animal. Spending more time with an animal, such as playing, walking, and other bonding activities, will keep them occupied and make <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> more at ease. If the animal is stressed, it is best to remove the object that is causing them discomfort.|$|E

25|$|Scottish Folds, whether with folded ears or {{with normal}} ears, are {{typically}} good-natured and placid and adjust to other animals within a household extremely well. They {{tend to become}} very attached to their human caregivers and are by nature quite affectionate. Folds also receive high marks for playfulness, grooming and intelligence. These animals like to be outdoors and enjoy outdoor games and activities very much. Loneliness is something they heavily dislike and which makes <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> depressed. It is also common for Scottish Folds to be stubborn.|$|E
25|$|Collaboration {{is a way}} to get {{everyone}} involved in the group by assigning each member special, meaningful tasks. It is a way for the group members to share the knowledge and the tasks to be fulfilled unfailingly. For example, if Sally and Paul were loafing because they were not given specific tasks, then giving Paul the note taker duty and Sally the brainstorming duty will make <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> essential to the group. Sally and Paul will be less likely to want to let the group down, because they have specific obligations to complete.|$|E

25|$|Noten's work The Pistol Saints (2003) {{is part of}} the Design Against Crime project. Whenever Noten {{asked people}} why they carried a gun they said it made <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> more secure, {{although}} most of them never actually used their gun. This inspired him to copy what he called the soul of the gun in pieces of jewellery the owner could wear instead of the gun. The Pistol Saints consists of twelve golden brooches with imprints of a gun. On the brooches the gun markings can be clearly distinguished.|$|E
25|$|Large {{schools of}} forage fish, such as {{surgeonfish}} and cardinalfish, {{move around the}} reef feeding on tiny zooplankton. The forage fish are, in turn, eaten by larger fish, such as the bigeye trevally. Fish receive many benefits from schooling behaviour, including defence against predators through better predator detection, since each fish is on the lookout. Schooling fish have developed remarkable displays of precise choreography which confuse and evade predators. For this they have evolved special pressure sensors along their sides, called lateral lines, that let <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> each other's movements and stay synchronized.|$|E
25|$|Practically the Jizya {{replaced}} poll taxes {{imposed by}} the Sassanids, which tended to be {{much higher than the}} Jizya. In addition to the Jizya the old Sassanid land tax (Known in Arabic as Kharaj) was also adopted. Caliph Umar is said to have occasionally set up a commission to survey the taxes in order to check that they wouldn't be more than the land could bear. It is narrated that Zoroastrians were subjected to humiliation and ridicule when paying the Jizya in order to make <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> inferior.|$|E
