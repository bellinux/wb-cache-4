40|$|Goal of the {{integrated}} project which included eight {{small and medium-sized}} haulage companies was to analyse qualification demands and work loads of <b>transportation</b> <b>managers,</b> to develop a modular system to qualify <b>transportation</b> <b>managers</b> and to test some moduls serving as examples, to optimize their work system and to enquire criteria for job adequate technical environment. The following advances for an integrative and participative proceeding were used: -questionnaires with <b>transportation</b> <b>managers,</b> - continuous work with <b>transportation</b> <b>managers</b> of the included haulage companies in a task force, -work with <b>transportation</b> <b>managers</b> within the operational context. The result is a concept to qualify <b>transportation</b> <b>managers</b> in small and medium-sized haulage companies and to design their occupational functions based on moduls which {{are close to the}} practical work and were developed in form of a modular system. These moduls can be used as standard packages or be tailored to each company's specific needs. (orig.)

Employing a theoretical framework underpinned by the job characteristics theory, this correlational study examined the relationships between task identity, safety climate, and job satisfaction to assist <b>transportation</b> <b>managers</b> with information for improving workers 2 ̆ 7 job satisfaction for increasing productivity and organizational performance. Three validated survey instruments (Safety Climate, Job Characteristics Inventory, and Job Satisfaction) and one demographic instrument were distributed to railroad workers in the eastern region of North Carolina (n = 80). The survey response data provided the basis for identifying the significant predictors, moderators, and mediators of workers 2 ̆ 7 job satisfaction. Structural equation modeling and partial least squares software indicated a significant (p 3 ̆c. 001) positive correlation between the indicator variables of Employees 2 ̆ 7 Task Identify, Safety Climate, and Job Tenure and the dependent variable of Job Satisfaction. Although there was a significant positive correlation between railroad employees 2 ̆ 7 job tenure and job satisfaction, job tenure did not significantly (p 3 ̆e. 05) moderate the relationship between railroad workers 2 ̆ 7 task identity and job satisfaction. The findings may be of value to railroad <b>transportation</b> <b>managers</b> developing new initiatives to improve safety climate for increasing employee job satisfaction.

40|$|This paper investigates how <b>transportation</b> sector <b>managers</b> {{perceive}} and utilize climate science, and subsequently, {{how they}} appropriate {{the climate change}} problem. The analysis focuses on which devices they qualify as useful for translating between knowledge, policy and practice concluding {{with a discussion of}} what this suggests in the development of efficient climate adaptation strategies. The paper demonstrates that although <b>transportation</b> sector <b>managers</b> accept the findings of climate science knowledge presented to them, their understanding of the climate change problem and the range of qualifying anchoring devices used in the development of climate adaption strategies are differentiated according to where they are located in the institutional context. For <b>transportation</b> sector <b>managers</b> on the regional and district level, the climate problem is largely perceived through the occurrence of extreme weather rather than through climate science. However, this knowledge basis is not considered sufficient to support ‘knowing how to act’ and has resulted in waiting for the authorities to make standards and regulations that would translate climate change knowledge into methods of practice. We argue that the development of standards and regulations might be underestimated in relation to user demands in climate adaptation work that involves reconciling scientific information...|$|R

40|$|With {{thousands}} of road crossings obstructing our river and streams in the Northeast, the impacts to {{public safety and}} habitat can be significant. Storms cause major damage to road-stream crossings, leading to public safety hazards and impacts to fisheries habitat. Many of our road-stream crossings are undersized impacting fish and wildlife access to upstream habitat. At the same time, these undersized crossings are prone to flood damage during storm events and can become public safety hazards. The goals of fisheries biologists and <b>transportation</b> <b>managers</b> may be different, but both interests benefit when road-stream crossings are improved. The solutions lie in the partnerships between the town highway departments, state resource agencies and nonprofit partners working together to achieve a balance with the natural resource and community infrastructure needs. In New England these partners have worked together to improve state and federal permits for stream crossings, develop standards and guidance documents, train road managers and implement projects to benefit habitat and public safety. This presentation will highlight the success of partnering with <b>transportation</b> planners, road <b>managers,</b> state and federal regulators, and resource managers to achieve stream habitat improvements at road-stream crossings...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 The major {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to develop a general descriptive and statistical base of information concerning agricultural cooperatives private motor vehicle operations in the Pacific Northwest states of Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington. The specific objectives of the study were: (1) to determine the number, sizes, types, and distribution of motor vehicles owned or leased by size and type of agricultural cooperative; (2) to identify and analyze the characteristics of transportation personnel responsible for managing vehicular operations; (3) to analyze vehicular maintenance practices, maintenance record keeping and control procedures; and (4) to analyze motor vehicle operating practices and characteristics, operating costs, and record keeping control procedures. A mail survey questionnaire was designed for primary data collection. The questionnaire was mailed early in June of 1976 to 403 agricultural cooperatives in Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington. There were 173 usable questionnaires returned. Frequency tables and cross-classification tables were developed in this study to interpret the questionnaire data. A computer program known as the Statistical Package for Social Sciences was used to tabulate and analyze the survey data. The predominant results of the study indicated that 82 percent of the 173 respondents reported using some form of motorized equipment. Forty-two percent of the respondents reported using some type of for-hire carrier. For-hire carriers often were used to supply specialized equipment to supplement vehicle operations on a short-term basis. Approximately 36 percent of the motor vehicles identified were straight-trucks or truck tractors. Most vehicles were owned by the respondents. Leased motor vehicles were used primarily by marketing, fruit and vegetable or purchasing cooperatives. The predominant fleet size by type of vehicle was under 10 vehicles, except {{in the case of a}} few large purchasing cooperatives that were responsible for operating in excess of 50 vehicles. The use of short or long-term lease agreements were justified by cooperative personnel for purposes of obtaining the use of specialized equipment on a seasonal basis. As to motor truck mileage, only seven percent was interstate. In most cases, interstate mileage comprised less than 25 percent of the total cooperative motor truck mileage. The average interstate trip was approximately 268 miles, but less than 11 percent had loaded backhauls. Only 19 percent of the persons responsible for cooperative transportation activities were <b>transportation</b> <b>managers.</b> The results suggest that <b>transportation</b> <b>managers</b> were only employed when sufficient activity in the transportation sector existed. It seems, however, the existence of <b>transportation</b> <b>managers</b> was not always contingent on cooperatives operating extensive motor vehicle fleets. Almost all professional drivers were bonded. However, there was considerable variation as to bond amounts. Most drivers had more transportation driving experience than years employed by a cooperative. This implied that some movement of drivers between places of employment exists. The various programs to train, monitor and evaluate professional drivers were concentrated in a few marketing and purchasing cooperatives. When the cooperatives elected to own or lease their own vehicles, the majority of the cooperatives maintained motor vehicles in their own garage. Most cooperatives only maintained those reports and records necessary to monitor current expenses. On balance, it appeared there was a general lack in reporting ability among most cooperatives concerning their transportation costs...|$|R

Load consolidation {{is a widely}} used practice in transportation. Load consolidation is grouping of several small shipments into one container while satisfying logistics system constraints. In this paper, two simple load consolidation approaches, which are known as 'quantity-based consolidation' and 'time and quantity-based consolidation' are evaluated. These approaches are 'non-recurrent', in which the logistics system has a 'target time' or 'target weight' before the accumulation of the orders. Some performance measures for these methods are investigated through a case study. The study is performed in a 3 P-logistics company operating from Gaziantep. Due {{to the complexity of}} the logistics processes, effects of the load consolidation methods are evaluated via process modelling and simulation. The performance results of load consolidation methods are compared in order to support decisions made by the management of company. load consolidation; land transport; logistics; business process modelling; simulation; Turkey; transportation management; load planning; route planning; capacity planning. ...|$|R
