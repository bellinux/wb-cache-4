2500|$|Culture {{is a set}} {{of values}} and {{practices}} that create meaning for society. [...] This includes both high culture (literature, art, and education, which appeals to elites) and popular culture (appeals to the masses). [...] This is what governments seek to show foreign audiences when engaging in cultural diplomacy. [...] It is a type of soft power, which is the [...] "ability <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want through attraction rather than coercion or payments. [...] It arises from a country's culture, political ideals and policies." [...] This indicates that the value of culture is its ability to attract foreigners to a nation. [...] Cultural diplomacy is also a component of public diplomacy. [...] Public diplomacy is enhanced by a larger society and culture, but simultaneously public diplomacy helps to [...] "amplify and advertise that society and culture to the world at large". [...] It could be argued that the information component of public diplomacy can only be fully effective where there is already a relationship that gives credibility to the information being relayed. [...] This comes from knowledge of the other's culture." [...] Cultural diplomacy has been called the [...] "linchpin of public diplomacy" [...] because cultural activities have the possibility to demonstrate the best of a nation. [...] In this way, cultural diplomacy and public diplomacy are intimately linked.|$|E

60|$|That is an {{instance}} of {{the manner in which}} things were done when a Dictatorship prevailed in the country, and that was what the Dictator did. Upon the whole, I do not think that, in general, out of common history books, you will ever get into the real history of this country, or anything particular which it would beseem you to know. You may read very ingenious and very clever books by men whom it would be the height of insolence in me to do any other thing than express my respect for. But their position is essentially sceptical. Man is unhappily in that condition that he will make only a temporary explanation of anything, and you will not be able, if you are like the man, to understand how this island came to be what it is.

The princess noticed this, and said: 'O Dil-aram! you must take my madman into your charge and give him whatever he wants.' This was the very thing Dilaram had prayed for.

6000|$|And yet, {{when one}} has said this, one {{has failed to}} express the {{national}} Geist in all its subtlety. In brief, the great American sport {{was not so much}} to win the game as to beat it; the evasion of rules challenged our ingenuity; and having won, we set about devising methods whereby it would be less and less possible for us winners to lose in the future. No better illustration of this tendency could be given than the development which had recently taken place in the field of our city politics, hitherto the battle-ground of Irish politicians who had fought one another for supremacy. Individualism had been rampant, competition the custom; you bought an alderman, or a boss who owned four or five aldermen, and then you never could be sure you were <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> wanted, or that the aldermen and the bosses would [...] "stay bought." [...] But now a genius had appeared, an American genius who had arisen swiftly and almost silently, who appealed to the imagination, and whose name was often mentioned in a whisper,--the Hon. Judd Jason, sometimes known as the Spider, who organized the City Hall and capitalized it; an ultimate and logical effect--if one had considered it--of the Manchester school of economics. Enlightened self-interest, stripped of sentiment, ends on Judd Jasons. He ran the city even as Mr. Sherrill ran his department store; you paid your price. It was very convenient. Being a genius, Mr. Jason did not wholly break with tradition, but retained those elements of the old muddled system that had their value, chartering steamboats for outings on the river, giving colossal picnics in Lowry Park. The poor and the wanderer and the criminal (of the male sex at least) were cared for. But he was not loved, as the rough-and-tumble Irishmen had been loved; he did not make himself common; he was surrounded by an aura of mystery which I confess had not failed of effect on me. Once, and only once during my legal apprenticeship, he had been pointed out to me on the street, where he rarely ventured. His appearance was not impressive....|$|E
