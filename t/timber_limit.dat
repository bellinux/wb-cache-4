50|$|A young Robert Jowsey {{who grew}} up with the story of Manion's lost silver mine, {{obtained}} a crude map from William Purcell, another lumberman who worked with Manion in the Ryan <b>Timber</b> <b>Limit.</b> In 1907, Jowsey, prompted by the stories of the rich silver strikes of Cobalt, arrived at Haileybury and quickly teamed up with two seasoned prospectors, James Wood and Charlie Keeley. The three men arrived in South Lorrain Twp where a number of prospectors were already on the scene. In October, James Wood discovered a small piece of float which contained some visible silver. An assay test was made which disclosed over 11000 oz of silver per ton. The sample also disclosed cobalt, an associated but well sought after mineral. A few months later Manion's discovery post was found by Woods.|$|E
50|$|The first {{discovery}} of {{silver in the}} area {{was made in the}} 1874 by a lumberman named Pat Manion. He blazed a stump as a witness or discovery tree and showed his sample to his fellow workers at the bunkhouse; everybody believed the sample to be common lead, and Manion agreed. A decade later while discussing his find to a young geologist, Manion quite surprised, discovered that the sample was nearly pure silver. Manion returned to the Ryan <b>Timber</b> <b>Limit</b> where he searched in vain for the location, but was unsuccessful in his attempt. The story of Manion's lost silver mine became legendary throughout the Gatineau-Ottawa region. In August 1903 silver was quickly discovered near the railway bed during the construction of the Temiskaming & Northern Ontario Railway. The discovery made at Long Lake, 103 mi north of North Bay, was spectacular. And within one year a silver rush occurred and subsequently the town of Cobalt was established to cater to the world's greatest silver region.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} the 1890s, the {{forestry}} industry was gaining momentum and importance in British Columbia and Charles began to invest in timber lands. In 1903, he founded Pretty's Timber Exchange.

This was a huge success.|$|R

50|$|About a {{year after}} the Whitney sawmill was built, Fowler and Hill sold the Minneapolis mill and {{associated}} <b>timber</b> <b>limits</b> to Frederick Weyerhaeuser of St. Paul.

5000|$|... “Some {{time ago}} I {{received}} {{instructions from the}} Department of the Interior to proceed to the Rockies and survey a park in the Cochrane Ranch Co.’s <b>timber</b> <b>limit,</b> using my own judgment as to the best location. The spot I located is about 4 miles from East Padmore and about 64 miles from Calgary in the first range of the Rockies. The scenery is grand and beautiful in the extreme, rivalling everything I have ever seen. The surface of the park, which is traversed {{from one end to}} the other by the main line of the C.P.R. is heavily timbered and contains one large lake and several smaller ones. The surface is very rocky and broken and the hills are picturesque in the extreme. As the train service does not extend past Calgary the journey west of that point has to be made by hand car. On the return journey the pumping apparatus broke, and owing to the strong wind and the track being on the downgrade we ran the car at the rate of thirteen miles per hour for seven hours by standing up and holding our coats sail fashion to catch the wind.” ...|$|E
40|$|In the 1880 s, Piikani {{land use}} was {{transformed}} by their settlement on reserve, shifting from a mobile existence to one centred on homesteads. This precipitated a significant {{social and economic}} change that had lasting consequences. My research examines the Piikani <b>Timber</b> <b>Limit</b> (IR 147 B), an isolated reserve belonging to the Piikani Blackfoot located in the Porcupine Hills. The <b>timber</b> <b>limit,</b> as an artifact of the 19 th century, is particularly conducive to chronicling landscape changes in Niitsitapi territory in the early reserve period. 147 B was set aside for timber harvest; its designation as a <b>timber</b> <b>limit</b> marks a significant change from its previous role {{as a component of}} the whole Piikani Landscape. I triangulate evidence from oral history, archival materials, and archaeological sites, to analyze the changing role of this <b>timber</b> <b>limit</b> in Piikani history. The sites discovered on 147 B include a historic eagle trapping site, logging camps and operations, and the hideout of a notorious Blackfoot outlaw. The archaeological sites on Piikani <b>timber</b> <b>limit</b> 147 B speak to the nuance of the Piikani colonial experience, and bring forward indigenous narratives about Canadian settlement on the prairies...|$|E

5000|$|During the 1830s, Aylen hired Irish labourers left {{unemployed}} {{after the}} completion of the Rideau Canal in 1832. Known as [...] "shiners", these workers encountered difficulties competing with the more experienced French-Canadians for jobs in the timber trade. Aylen {{is said to have been}} aggressive in competing with other timber owners: cutting wood illegally on their <b>timber</b> <b>limits,</b> destroying their log booms and terrorizing their employees.

50|$|The {{spread of}} {{railways}} in the Cairns region thus facilitated the timber industry. The Tablelands railway reached Mareeba from Cairns in 1893 and Atherton in 1903, enabling Tableland timber {{to be transported}} to the coast, and railway extensions {{over the next two}} decades made the Cairns region the main sawmilling district outside South East Queensland. Major sawmilling enterprises in the Far North region included Cairns <b>Timber</b> <b>Limited,</b> Lawson and Sons, and JM Johnston.|$|R

50|$|The Mi'kmaq {{family names}} most closely {{associated}} with Badger are Paul and Barrington {{and it is a}} John Paul that is thought to be the first permanent resident of the town. John Paul and John Barrington are known to have trapped in current Badger area. John Barrington also served as a guide in the 1875 survey for the Newfoundland railway. The area was all wilderness until about 1894 when the Newfoundland Railway went through. Soon after, the first railway workers settled there. Around that same time, lumbering operations commenced and was initially a source of logs for the Exploit Lumber Company who had a Sawmill at Botwood and owned the <b>timber</b> <b>limits.</b> This same Company established a mill at Badger sometime {{around the turn of the}} century. According to the Encyclopedia of Newfoundland and Labrador, there were two mills in the area in 1901. A Company known as the Newfoundland Pinelands Company owned a mill at Badger in 1905. Pinelands was a Harvey and Company subsidiary. The lumbering operations in Badger were taken over in the period 1905-1909 by Harry Judson Crowe, who would later sell the <b>timber</b> <b>limits</b> to the A.E. Reed (Newfoundland) company as a source of wood for their Bishop's Falls pulp mill.|$|R
2500|$|During {{the latter}} half of the 19th Century, he amassed timber rights {{approaching}} [...] in Central and Northern Ontario which he would harvest for his mills. He often went to his Algonquin <b>timber</b> <b>limits</b> in his own private railway car, working beside his men during the day and on business affairs most of the night, seldom sleeping for more than a few hours. He was always on the lookout for opportunities to reduce costs, and in 1894 he began investing in tugboats in order to accelerate the delivery of log booms to the Chaudière mill.|$|R
50|$|In 1911, the Reed {{company began}} a series of sales of timber rights with the Anglo-Newfoundland Development Company which led to the latter's {{acquisition}} of most of the <b>timber</b> <b>limits</b> in the area. In 1910-1911 A.N.D. established Badger Woods Division to facilitate logging operations. From that point until 1965 the AND Co would be the most important force in the local economy.
