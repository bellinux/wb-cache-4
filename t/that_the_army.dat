Davos and Tormund discuss their time serving Stannis and Mance and acknowledge that they may have served the wrong king all along. Davos discovers the pyre where Shireen and the wooden stag he carved for her were burned.|$|E
5|$|Around 03:00, Hatanaka was {{informed}} by Lieutenant Colonel Masataka Ida that the Eastern District Army {{was on its}} way to the palace to stop him, and that he should give up. Finally, seeing his plan collapsing around him, Hatanaka pleaded with Tatsuhiko Takashima, Chief of Staff of the Eastern District Army, to be given at least ten minutes on the air on NHK radio, to explain to the people of Japan what he was trying to accomplish and why. He was refused. Colonel Haga, commander of the 2ndRegiment of the First Imperial Guards, discovered <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> did not support this rebellion, and he ordered Hatanaka to leave the palace grounds.|$|E

5|$|As {{a member}} of the Joint Research and Development Committee with Spaatz, Devers took an {{interest}} in the development of helicopters, taking rides in different machines. He met with Larry Bell, the founder of Bell Aircraft. Bell's company was in a poor financial situation, and he was hoping <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> would buy fifty of his new Bell 47 helicopters. Devers was impressed with the aircraft, and agreed to do so, although for $25,000 each rather than the $35,000 Bell was asking for, and found the money from Army Ground Forces funds. The Bell H-13 Sioux would go on {{to become one of the}} world's most recognizable helicopters.|$|E

Units and formations listed in 1990 within six military sectors included the twelve divisions, four tank brigades, 45 mechanized and infantry brigades, 4 commando brigades, 1 surface-to-air missile brigade, 3 field artillery brigades, 30 field battalions, and one air defence artillery battalion.|$|E

5|$|De re militari, a {{treatise}} on Roman military affairs by Vegetius, a late 4th or early 5th-century writer, contains considerable {{information on the}} late army, although its {{focus is on the}} army of the Republic and Principate. However, Vegetius (who wholly lacked military experience) is often unreliable. For example, he stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>army</b> abandoned armour and helmets in the later 4th century (offering the absurd explanation that this equipment was too heavy), which is contradicted by sculptural and artistic evidence. In general, it is not safe to accept a statement from Vegetius unless it is corroborated by other evidence.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the state}} {{suffered}} from economic problems and internal {{opposition to the}} Khalifa, particularly from the Mahdi's family, and the Khalifa was forced to concentrate on consolidation. The British detected his weakness, and prepared an invasion motivated {{in part by a}} wish to revenge Gordon's death, in part by a desire for raw cotton for their textile industry. A methodical invasion was launched in 1896. slowly moving south supported by a railway <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>army</b> built along its route. The force reached Berber in September 1897 and Atbara in April 1898. The British and Egyptian force led by General Kitchener defeated the Kalifa at the Battle of Omdurman on 2 September 1898. The battle is known as the Battle of Karari to Mahdists.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, a 3-hour {{power outage}} caused by testing of new {{distribution}} circuits affected seven major factories producing material for World War II.

Local hospitals and Mitchel Field were able to continue operating under auxiliary power. Although sabotage was not suspected, it caused the colonel in charge of civilian protection for Nassau County to request <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> guard the power station.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>army's</b> {{influence}} was obvious. Forty {{percent of the}} delegates (24 men) had served in <b>the</b> <b>army</b> in October-December 1835.

5|$|<b>The</b> {{conclusion}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>army's</b> size {{remained constant}} between 235 and 285 appears implausible, as this period saw the Third Century Crisis, during which <b>the</b> <b>army's</b> recruitment capacity was severely diminished {{by the impact}} of the Plague of Cyprian, numerous civil wars and devastating barbarian invasions.|$|R

This {{was seen as}} an attempt by Army officials, anticipating the potential of the D-255, to acquire an interim aircraft to fill the escort role until the Army could determine the requirements for a dedicated armed helicopter. However, the Secretary of the Army disapproved the interim approach and directed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> look for a more advanced system that would dramatically improve over current helicopter designs.|$|E
5|$|In July 2010, Dannatt gave {{evidence}} to the Iraq Inquiry, focusing predominantly on his role as ACGS in 2002. He described an initial reluctance to commit the Army and stated that planning had been for a minimal land commitment {{and the provision of}} naval and air support to the United States. He also repeated his previous assertions <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>army</b> had been over-stretched by simultaneous operation in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2006 and re-stated his view that Afghanistan was the more important for British interests. Dannatt's evidence was followed by that of his predecessor as CGS, General Sir Mike Jackson.|$|E
5|$|In early 1934, Hitler {{and other}} Nazi leaders became {{concerned}} that Röhm was planning a coup d'état.

He felt that the SA—now numbering some three million men, far dwarfing the army—should become the sole arms-bearing corps of the state, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>army</b> should be absorbed into the SA under his leadership. Röhm lobbied Hitler to appoint him Minister of Defence, a position held by conservative General Werner von Blomberg.|$|E

50|$|Critics long {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Army's</b> {{officer corps}} was heavily dominated by Junker aristocrats, so that commoners were shunted into low-prestige branches, {{such as the}} heavy artillery or supply.

5|$|Initially, the American embassy {{believed}} the Ngô family's {{claims that the}} regular army {{was responsible for the}} raids. The Voice of America, which was widely listened to in South Vietnam as the only non-Diệmist news source, initially aired Nhu's version of events, much to the dismay of the generals. The American media thought otherwise and began to debunk this theory, pointing out that the Ngô family constantly sought to undermine the army, and that Madame Nhu's joy over the events suggested the family had neither ceded power nor had their hands forced by the military. Furthermore, they identified Nhu's aides at the site, his idiosyncratic style in the announcements supposedly made by the ARVN, and the fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>army</b> had little motive to attack the Buddhists.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the Ngô family claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>army</b> {{had carried}} out the raids, {{something}} their U.S. allies initially believed. However, this was later debunked, and the incident prompted the United States to turn against the regime and begin exploring alternative leadership options, eventually leading to Diệm's overthrow in a coup. In South Vietnam itself, the raids stoked widespread anger. Several high-ranking public servants resigned, and university {{and high school students}} boycotted classes and staged riotous demonstrations, resulting in further mass incarcerations. As most of the students were from middle-class public service and military families, the arrests caused further upset among the Ngô family's power base.|$|E
5|$|McNair had {{established}} Army Ground Forces headquarters at the Army War College campus, where Devers lived, but Stilwell had moved the headquarters into the Pentagon. Eisenhower, {{as the new}} Chief of Staff of the Army, decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> Ground Forces headquarters should be co-located with the Army Air Forces' Tactical Air Command, so it was moved to Fort Monroe, Virginia, not far from Langley Field. Devers opened his headquarters there on 1 October 1946. Further reorganization occurred on 10 March 1948, when Army Ground Forces was renamed Army Field Forces. Control of the armies {{was transferred to the}} Department of the Army, and Army Field Forces was reduced to a coordinating staff agency.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{concerns}} {{had been}} growing about the unsympathetic treatment of historic military buildings by the War Office; for its part, the War Office was concerned that it might find itself financially supporting these properties from its own budget. Yarmouth Castle was passed to the Commissioners of Woods and Forests in 1901, with parts of it were leased to the neighbouring hotel. The War Office concluded that Walmer and Deal had no remaining military value and agreed to transfer the castles to the Office of Works in 1904, who opened both former fortifications to visitors. Portland Castle was placed onto what {{was known as the}} Schedule C list, which meant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> would continue to use and manage the historic property, but would receive advice on the suitability of repairs from the Office of Works.|$|E

These men were discharged on November 28, 1864. Among those discharged was Lieutenant Colonel John J. Hoffman, commander of {{the regiment}}. General William H. Powell did not remain with the army much longer, as he resigned to attend to family issues. His resignation was reluctantly approved after a protest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>army</b> could not afford to lose an officer of his quality, and he gave his farewell speech on January 10, 1865.|$|E

2500|$|International {{events and}} changes in the defense policy of the United States also {{played a role in the}} {{formation}} of the board. President John F.

Feeling <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Army's</b> response to his concerns was still too cautious, he took the unusual step of directing the Secretary of <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> to form a board to review <b>the</b> <b>Army's</b> plans for aviation (especially helicopters) with a fresh approach (a [...] "new look"). This approach was to ignore past policies and restrictions, and shift from ground-based systems to airmobile systems [...] "if it would improve capabilities and effectiveness." [...] McNamara's memo also named the individuals he wished to conduct this review, giving the Secretary of <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> no room to place his own appointees. Finally, McNamara indicated <b>that</b> he wanted <b>the</b> board to use field tests and exercises to validate its recommendations.|$|R
