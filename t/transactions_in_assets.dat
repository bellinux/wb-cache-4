40|$|The {{relatively}} recent resumption of large international capital flows and the Asian crisis have revived interest in capital controls - taxes or restrictions on international <b>transactions</b> <b>in</b> <b>assets</b> like stocks or bonds.

40|$|Inflation, {{especially}} recently, has {{distorted the}} nominal historical-cost measurement of {{gains and losses}} from <b>transactions</b> <b>in</b> <b>assets.</b> This distortion has exacerbated the existing controversy over the federal taxation of such gains and losses realized by individuals. The main {{purpose of the study}} was to examine the equity of actual and proposed methods respecting such taxation in view of these inflation distortions. Particularly, the study investigated how the applicable law, as it was in the immediate past (1977 Law), as it is now (1979 Law), and as many have proposed that it should be (the Reform Plan), compared under the traditional ability-to-pay theory of equity. The Reform Plan combines two current and popular tax reform proposals, the comprehensive income tax and indexing. As it was interpreted and applied in this study, gains and losses from <b>transactions</b> <b>in</b> <b>assets</b> were fully included in income, after they were indexed for inflation. Indexing consists of multiplying the historical cost of an asset by the ratio of some price index (herein the CPI) at the time of disposition to the index at the time of acquisition. Subtracting the result from the disposition price gives a gain or loss measured in real, inflation-adjusted terms. The comparisons of the three taxing methods were based upon historical tax-return data of 224 individual taxpayers for 1970 - 1977. The non-random manner in which the taxpayers were selected precludes the results and conclusions of the study from being statistically extended to the population of U. S. taxpayers. Significantly, however, the tax characteristics of the selected taxpayers indicated that they were more sensitive to effects of inflation than their national counterparts. Provisions of 1979 Law and the Reform Plan were simulated on the historical data, resulting in recomputed incomes and tax liabilities. The historical and recomputed incomes and taxes were then averaged by taxpayer over the eight years. These averages gave better approximations of the normal financial status of the taxpayers than single-year data. Data generated in the Reform Plan simulation indicated that the selected taxpayers' historical gains and losses were substantially distorted by inflation. Moreover, the proportional effects of inflation decreased as taxpayers' income increased. These findings were fully consistent with two published studies. Various procedures measured and compared the horizontal equities and vertical equities (progressivities) of the three disparite taxing methods. None of them exhibited any clear, unambiguous superior ratings. The Reform Plan was only slightly more horizontally equitable and only slightly more progressive than 1977 Law; 1979 Law ranked last in both analyses, but by small margins. Importantly, under all three methods, progressivity was maintained at higher income levels, but only when income was defined in real terms. When income was defined in nominal terms, a marked decrease in progressivity was manifested. This finding suggests that the appearance at these levels of reduced progressivity, and hence of reduced vertical equity, may be an illusion. Given the above findings, perhaps too much historical emphasis has been placed on the equity benchmark in evaluating the taxation of individuals' gains and losses from <b>transactions</b> <b>in</b> <b>assets.</b> If so, then other judgmental criteria would seem to take on relatively greater importance. Four such criteria deemed pertinent were neutrality, simplicity, mitigation of the "lock-in effect" and stimulation of capital information. The Reform Plan appeared to be more neutral than either 1977 or 1979 Law. Whether it is simpler is questionable. Probably less unrealized gains would be locked-in under the Reform Plan. However, with respect to capital formation, considerable theoretical disagreement precluded a conclusion as to which taxing method would be more stimulative...|$|E

40|$|The {{reliability}} of EMU’s fiscal indicators {{has been questioned}} by recent episodes of large upward deficit revisions. This paper discusses the causes of such revisions {{in order to identify}} ways to improve monitoring. The computation of EMU’s deficit indicator involves the assessment of accrued revenue and expenditure and the identification of <b>transactions</b> <b>in</b> financial <b>assets.</b> Both can open margins for opportunistic accounting. However, crosschecks between deficit and changes in gross nominal debt (the other fiscal indicator used in EMU) can reduce the scope for fiscal gimmickry. Simple comparison of deficit and changes in debt can readily spotlight large inconsistencies in fiscal data. Nevertheless, consistency checks must go deeper than simple comparison, since different items in the reconciliation account between deficit and change in debt can offset each other. Econometric evidence suggests that such offset may indeed have been used to reduce the visibility of deficit-specific fiscal gimmickry. Attention to the quality of statistics has increased in recent years, also {{in the context of the}} reform of the Stability and Growth Pact. In this context, the paper argues that detailed analysis of the reconciliation account between deficit and change in debt is crucial to the effectiveness of monitoring...|$|R

The results for 1981 to 2000 are presented in Oil and gas monetary balance sheet Since observed market values for <b>transactions</b> <b>in</b> the <b>assets</b> <b>in</b> situ are not widely available, the present value method is used to put a monetary value on the physical stocks of assets.

40|$|The {{effective}} cost {{of trading}} is usually estimated from transaction-level data. This study proposes a Gibbs estimate {{that is based}} on daily closing prices. In a validation sample, the daily Gibbs estimate achieves a correlation of 0. 965 with the transactionlevel estimate. When the Gibbs estimates are incorporated into asset pricing specifications over a long historical sample (1926 to 2006), the results suggest that effective cost (as a characteristic) is positively related to stock returns. The relation is strongest in January, but it appears to be distinct from size effects. INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE ROLE of liquidity and <b>transaction</b> costs <b>in</b> <b>asset</b> pricing must generally confront the fact that while many asset pricing tests make use of U. S. equity returns from 1926 onward, the high-frequency data used to estimate trading costs are usually not available prior to 1983. Accordingly, most studies either limit the sample to the post- 1983 period of common coverage or use the longer historical sample with liquidity proxies estimated from daily data. This paper falls into the latter group. Specifically, I propose a new approach to estimating the effective cost of trading and the common variation in this cost. These estimates are then used <b>in</b> conventional <b>asset</b> pricing specifications with a view to ascertaining the role of trading costs as a characteristic in explaining expected returns. ...|$|R

40|$|In any {{economic}} environment where decisions are decentralized, agents consider {{the risk that}} others might unfairly exploit informational asymmetries to their own disadvantage.

40|$|International audienceThe {{object of}} this {{contribution}} {{is to present}} the ideas behind the thinking of the French economist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809 - 1865) {{in relation to the}} causes and effects of Stock market speculation. It is based upon the works of this author but particularly on his “Manuel du spéculateur à la Bourse” (Stock Market Speculator Manual) edited in 1857 in Paris. Compared to the markets of today, however, the stock market described by Proudhon appears embryonic. Nevertheless it represents the location for <b>transactions</b> <b>in</b> financial <b>assets,</b> commodities, precious metals and even some transactions involving options. This contribution is organised in the following manner - the first section is devoted to the development of Proudhon's thought in relation to speculation. It is divided into two parts. The first part is dedicated to Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's definitions of stock market speculation or gambling with shares that for him served no purpose either from a human or economic perspective and was therefore condemnable and to be contrasted with entrepreneurial speculation that, even though it is a highly-risky activity, involves the spirit of enterprise and provides the lifeblood of economic growth. The second part allows us to present Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's propositions in relation to restricting the speculation that he considers obnoxious. The second section has two objectives: one part places in perspective the views of Proudhon and the characteristics of stock market activity under the Second Empire whilst the other part examines current-day aspects of the characteristics evoked by Proudhon. We are interested especially in the question of the regulation and that of the relevance today of certain accounting practices...|$|R

The mortgage servicing agent is the entity that receives the mortgage payment, maintains the payment records, provides borrowers with account statements, imposes late charges when the payment is late, and pursues delinquent borrowers. A securitization is a financial <b>transaction</b> <b>in</b> which <b>assets,</b> especially debt instruments, are pooled and securities representing {{interests in the}} pool are issued. Most loans are subject to being bundled and sold, and the rights to act as servicing agent sold, {{without the consent of}} the borrower. A federal statute requires notice to the borrower of a change in servicing agent, but does not protect the borrower from being held delinquent on the note for payments made to the servicing agent who fails to forward the payments to the owner of the note, especially if that servicing agent goes bankrupt, and borrowers who have made all payments on time can find themselves being foreclosed on and becoming unsecured creditors of the servicing agent. Foreclosures can sometimes be conducted without proper notice to the borrower. In some states (see Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 746), there is no defense against eviction, forcing the borrower to move and incur the expense of hiring a lawyer and finding another place to live while litigating the claim of the [...] "new owner" [...] to own the house, especially after it is resold one or more times. When the debtor demands, under the best evidence rule, that the current claimed note owner produce the original note with the debtor's signature on it, the note owner typically is unable or unwilling to do so, and tries to establish his claim with an affidavit that it is the owner, without proving it is the [...] "holder in due course", the traditional standard for a debt claim, and the courts often allow them to do that.

40|$|In real markets, to some degree, every trade will incur a non-zero {{cost and}} will {{influence}} {{the price of}} the <b>asset</b> traded. <b>In</b> situations where a dynamic trading strategy is implemented these liquidity effects can play a significant role. In this thesis we examine two situations in which such trading strategies are inherent to the problem; that of pricing a derivative contingent on the asset and that of executing a large portfolio <b>transaction</b> <b>in</b> the <b>asset.</b> The asset's finite liquidity has been incorporated explicitly into its price dynamics using the Bakstein-Howison model [4]. Using this model we have derived the no-arbitrage price of a derivative on the asset and have found a true continuous-time equation when the bid-ask spread <b>in</b> the <b>asset</b> is neglected. Focussing on this pure liquidity case we then employ an asymptotic analysis to examine the price of a European call option near strike and expiry where the liquidity effects are shown to be most significant and closed-form expressions for the price are derived in this region. The asset price model is then extended to incorporate the empirical fact that an asset's liquidity mean reverts stochastically. In this situation the pricing equation is analyzed using the multiscale asymptotic technique developed by Fouque, Papanicolaou, and Sircar [22] and a simplified pricing and calibration framework is developed for an asset possessing liquidity risk. Finally, the derivative pricing framework (both with and without liquidity risk) is applied to a new contract termed the American forward which we present as a possible hedge against an <b>asset's</b> liquidity risk. <b>In</b> {{the second part of the}} thesis we investigate how to optimally execute a large transaction of a finitely liquid asset. Using stochastic dynamic programming and attempting only to minimize the transaction's cost, we first find that the optimal strategy is static and contains the naive strategy found in previous studies, but with an extra term to account for interest rates neglected by those studies. Including time risk into the optimization procedure we find expressions for the optimal strategy in the extreme cases when the trader's aversion to this risk is very small and very large. In the former case the optimal strategy is simply the cost-minimization strategy perturbed by a small correction proportional to the trader's level of risk aversion. In the latter case the problem is shown to be much more difficult; we analyze and derive implicit closed-form solutions to the much-simplified perfect liquidity case and show numerical results to demonstrate the agreement of the solution with our intuition.
