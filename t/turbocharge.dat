This led to a frustrating season for both Jones and Tambay as the THL2 was generally regarded to be the best handling car of the season.

We show that this subproblem is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by k and c, but it is para-NP-hard and W[1]-hard when parameterized by only k or c, respectively.

The performance of an axial turbine for the turbocharger is heavily affected by blade design due to the flow dynamics in the blade passage. Furthermore, modification and improvement of a turbine blade is a challenging task for turbomachinery engineers. Hence, this study is aimed to predict the performance of an axial turbine of automotive engine turbocharger. A cascade, having nozzle stator, {{was used for the}} performance evaluation.

My views should not be attributed {{to any of the}} organizations with which I am affiliated. No issue ignites such fierce passions as the taxation of capital gains. Columbia law professor Michael Graetz (1997) referred to the epic battle between President George H. W.

Senator Mitchell, however, was convinced that cutting capital gains tax rates would simply provide an unfair windfall to the wealthiest people in society. How should capital gains be taxed? Under an income tax the answer is that capital gains should be taxed in full as they are earned, not when realized. Capital gains are income, not really different in substance from interest, rents, and royalties: other kinds of capital income that are taxed as ordinary income.
