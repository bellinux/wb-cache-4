The sail was used only when {{the wall of the}} boilers was cleaned. However, there were still many skeptics, and in 1836, scientific writer Dionysius Lardner declared that: As the project of making the voyage directly from New York to Liverpool, it was perfectly chimerical, and they might as well talk of making the voyage from New York to the moon.|$|E
2500|$|Interestingly, {{the belief}} in the {{protective}} power of mezuzah is prevalent in the modern times as well. In the 1970s after a series of terrorist attacks in Ma'alot the representatives of Chabad-Lubavitch started the campaign for the systematic checking of mezuzahs. The more general assumption underlying the action was that adhering to the mitzvot would guarantee personal safety. [...] Similar steps have been undertaken by an organization Bi-zkhut rabbi Shimeon which collects the testimonies of those who have personally experienced the extraordinary power of the mezuzah. Some statements speak about the direct dependence between the damaged biblical text and the essence of the encountered calamity. For instance:A woman suffered from deep depression. An examination of her mezuzahs revealed that in the word “your soul” there was a letter split in two.Finally, according to various pieces of sociological research, approximately <b>three-quarter</b> <b>of</b> adults in Israel believe that the mezuzah literally guards their houses.|$|E
2500|$|Before 1837, the East India Company's dominions in India had no {{universal}} public postal service, {{one that}} was shared by all regions. [...] Although courier services did exist, connecting the more important towns with their respective seats of provincial government (i.e. the Presidency towns of Fort William (Calcutta), Fort St. George (Madras), and Bombay), private individuals were, upon payment, only sparingly allowed their use. [...] That situation changed in 1837, when, by Act XVII of that year, a public post, run by the Company's Government, {{was established in the}} Company's territory in India. [...] Post offices were established in the principal towns and postmasters appointed. [...] The postmasters of the Presidency towns oversaw a few provincial post offices in addition to being responsible for the main postal services between the provinces. [...] By contrast, the District collectors (originally, collectors of land-tax) directed the District post offices, including their local postal services. [...] Postal services required payment in cash, to be made in advance, with the amount charged usually varying with weight and distance. For example, the charge of sending a letter from Calcutta to Bombay was one rupee; however, that from Calcutta to Agra was 12 annas (or <b>three-quarter</b> <b>of</b> a rupee) for each tola (three-eighths of an ounce).|$|E
