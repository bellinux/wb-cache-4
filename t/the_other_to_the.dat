5|$|During the 20th {{century the}} long-abandoned gardens were replanted {{in a style}} {{sympathetic}} to the Tudor period. The knot garden was planted in 1972, to a design taken from Leonard Meager's Complete English Gardener, published in 1670. The intricate design of the knot {{can be seen from}} one of the two original viewing mounds, common in 16th-century formal gardening, one inside the moat and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southwest. Other features of the grounds include a yew tunnel and an orchard growing fruits that would have been familiar to the house's Tudor occupants– apples, pears, quinces and medlars.|$|E

5|$|More recently, it {{has been}} {{suspected}} that the western cicada killer represents more than one species. It co-occurs with the eastern cicada killer (S.speciosus) and Pacific cicada killer (S.convallis) at Big Bend National Park in Texas. There the three wasps hunt and nest in the same locales, and the eastern and western cicada killers hunt the same cicada species. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA showed that the western cicada killer contains two divergent clades, which may represent distinct species. The two clades appeared to be split by the Rocky Mountains, with one occurring mainly {{to the south and}} east, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west.|$|E

500|$|A 2017 {{molecular}} {{analysis by}} Alison J. McLean and colleagues {{of the various}} subspecies across Australia largely supported Schodde's hypothesis. The Great Dividing Range was a major barrier {{and there is a}} deep genetic split between subspecies lamberti to its east, and subspecies assimilis and <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west. McLean proposed resurrecting the separate species status of the purple-backed fairywren as M. assimilis and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> subspecies <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north and west as reallocated to this species. A genetic split was also found across the Eyrean barrier, suggesting splitting those east and west (as [...] M. assimilis mastersi Mathews) into separate subspecies would reflect the divergence.|$|R

5|$|The punchbowls are a 'harlequin pair', {{similar but}} not exactly matching. The bowls have been donated independently, {{one to the}} State Library of New South Wales (SLNSW) in 1926 and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Australian National Maritime Museum (ANMM) in 2006. The Library bowl is the more widely known of the pair. Its {{earliest}} provenance places it in England in the late 1840s, where {{it is said to}} originally have been commissioned for William Bligh; another source suggests Henry Colden Antill. It passed through several owners in Britain before it was presented to the State Library. The Museum bowl's first provenance is from England in 1932 and {{it has been suggested that}} it was made to the order of Arthur Phillip. Its whereabouts were unknown until it appeared in the Newark Museum, United States, in 1988, on loan from Peter Frelinghuysen Jr.. Through donations, the Maritime Museum later acquired the punchbowl from Frelinghuysen.|$|E
5|$|Wang Mang {{initiated}} {{a series of}} major reforms that were ultimately unsuccessful. These reforms included outlawing slavery, nationalizing land to equally distribute between households, and introducing new currencies, a change which debased the value of coinage. Although these reforms provoked considerable opposition, Wang's regime met its ultimate downfall with the massive floods of c. 3 AD and 11 AD. Gradual silt buildup in the Yellow River had raised its water level and overwhelmed the flood control works. The Yellow River split into two new branches: one emptying {{to the north and}} <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south of the Shandong Peninsula, though Han engineers managed to dam the southern branch by 70 AD.|$|E
5|$|Barham had seriously miscalculated the {{strength}} of the Brest fleet, which had been uninvolved in the campaign of 1805 and was therefore at full strength. He also underestimated Napoleon, who had observed that Villeneuve's brief stay in the Caribbean had acted as a major threat to British trade, delaying convoys and causing panic among the West Indian merchants. The French naval authorities were also inspired by the effect of a raiding squadron under Contre-Admiral Zacharie Allemand, which had escaped from Rochefort on 17 July 1805, caused significant disruption to British trade in the Atlantic and remained at sea off the North African coast. Seeking to repeat these effects, Napoleon sent orders to the commander at Brest, Vice Admiral Honoré Ganteaume, in November 1805 for two strong squadrons to be prepared for service in the Atlantic. These were to leave Brest under cover of darkness on 13 December, with orders to strike deep into the Atlantic and intercept any merchant convoys that they encountered. Subsequently, the squadrons were to separate, one to the South Atlantic and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Caribbean, there to cause as much disruption to British intercontinental trade as possible. The orders encouraged the admirals not to engage any Royal Navy force of equivalent size or larger and thus avoid the risk of being captured or destroyed.|$|E

5|$|The churchyard {{contains}} 51gravestones {{dating from}} the 17thcentury. The most important monument is the canopied tomb {{of a member of}} the Venables family, which dates from the late 13thcentury; crocketed pinnacles on the canopy date from the 17thcentury. Formerly inside the church, the tomb contains two figures, male and female, with their hands clasped in prayer. The only one of its kind in Cheshire, it is listed GradeII*, and is a scheduled monument. There are two further notable memorials in the churchyard, one to the north and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south of the Venables tomb. Both are in yellow sandstone, date from the medieval period, and include weathered recumbent effigies. The one to the north possibly depicts a cleric with his hands in prayer, and the one to the south is a knight in armour with a missing leg. The churchyard also contains a sundial, consisting of two octagonal steps that were originally the base of a 16th-century cross supporting an 18th-century octagonal pillar. In addition to being listed, it is also a scheduled monument. The gateway to the churchyard dates from the 17thcentury, and consists of a yellow sandstone arch with crocketed pinnacles and a battlemented parapet. All of these structures are listed as GradeII. The churchyard contains the war graves of 16British servicemen, 15of World War I, and one of World War II. A yew tree in the churchyard is believed to be over 1,000years old.|$|E
5|$|The entire Simpson {{family was}} {{designed}} {{so that they would}} be recognizable in silhouette. The family was crudely drawn, because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings. To draw Marge, the animators generally start off with a sphere, similar to the way Lisa and Maggie are drawn. The eyes are then drawn, with one roughly {{in the middle of the}} sphere, and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front side of the head. Then, the nose and lip are drawn. Her hair is then drawn on top as a long tube coming out of the sphere. An original idea the animators had for when Marge walked through doorways was that her hair would be forced down as she walked through, then once clear of the door, it would spring back and forth. This was never used. Groening's original plan for Marge's hair was that it would conceal large, Life in Hell-esque rabbit ears. The gag was intended to be revealed in the final episode of the series, but was scrapped early on due to inconsistencies, and also to the fact that rabbit ears would be too fictitious even for The Simpsons.|$|E
5|$|The genus Alcelaphus emerged about 4.4 {{million years}} ago in a clade whose other members were Damalops, Numidocapra, Rabaticeras, Megalotragus, Oreonagor, and Connochaetes. An {{analysis}} using phylogeographic patterns within hartebeest populations suggested a possible origin of Alcelaphus in eastern Africa. Alcelaphus quickly radiated across the African savannas, replacing several previous forms (such as a relative of the hirola). Flagstad and colleagues showed an early split in the hartebeest populations into two distinct lineages around 0.5 {{million years ago}} – one to the north and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south of the equator. The northern lineage further diverged into eastern and western lineages, nearly 0.4 million years ago, most probably {{as a result of the}} expanding central African rainforest belt and subsequent contraction of savannah habitats during a period of global warming. The eastern lineage gave rise to the Coke's, Swayne's, Tora and Lelwel hartebeest; and from the western lineage evolved the Bubal and western hartebeest. The southern lineage gave rise to Lichtenstein's and red hartebeest. These two taxa are phylogenetically close, having diverged only 0.2 million years ago. The study concluded that these major events throughout the hartebeest's evolution are strongly related to climatic factors, and that there had been successive bursts of radiation from a more permanent population—a refugium—in eastern Africa; this could be vital to understanding the evolutionary history of not only the hartebeest but also other mammals of the African savanna.|$|E
