When the Portuguese living there realized that Milhais was in need, the community gathered funds to send him back to Portugal with enough money to provide for his family.

25|$|At {{the same}} time, Hitler {{was worried about}} American popular support after the U.S. entry into the war {{following}} the Attack on Pearl Harbor, and a potential Anglo-American invasion on the Western Front in 1942 (which did not occur until the summer of 1944). He changed his primary goal from an immediate victory in the East, to the more long-term goal of securing the southern Soviet Union to protect oil fields vital to the long-term German war effort. While Red Army generals correctly judged the evidence that Hitler would shift his efforts south, Stalin <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> flanking move in the German attempt to take Moscow.|$|E
25|$|In {{that same}} year, {{by his own}} account, Samuel went to his {{employer}} and a More family friend, Lord Zouche, Lord President of the Council of Wales, Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports and Privy Counselor, {{to draw up a}} plan for the disposition of the children. Zouche had been {{an active member of the}} Virginia Company and in 1617 he invested £100 in an expedition to the Colony of Virginia, which is where the Mayflower was supposed to have landed. It was his actions that were instrumental in putting the More children on the Mayflower. At that time, children were routinely rounded up from the streets of London or taken from poor families receiving church relief to be used as labourers in the colonies. Any legal objections to the involuntary transportation of the children were over-ridden by the Privy Council, namely, Lord Zouche. Most people <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> death sentence and indeed, many did not survive either the voyage or the harsh climate, disease and scarcity of fresh food for which they were ill-prepared.|$|E

25|$|There {{was now a}} tumult arisen at Alexandria, {{between the}} Jewish {{inhabitants}} and the Greeks; and three ambassadors were chosen out of each party that were at variance, who came to Gaius. Now one of these ambassadors from the people of Alexandria was Apion, (29) who uttered many blasphemies against the Jews; and, among other things that he said, he charged them with neglecting the honors that belonged to Caesar; for that while all who were subject to the Roman empire built altars and temples to Gaius, and in other regards universally received him as they received the gods, these Jews alone <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> dishonorable thing for them to erect statues in honor of him, {{as well as to}} swear by his name. Many of these severe things were said by Apion, by which he hoped to provoke Gaius to anger at the Jews, as he was likely to be. But Philo, the principal of the Jewish embassage, a man eminent on all accounts, brother to Alexander the Alabarch, (30) and one not unskillful in philosophy, was ready to betake himself to make his defense against those accusations; but Gaius prohibited him, and bid him begone; he was also in such a rage, that it openly appeared he was about to do them some very great mischief. So Philo being thus affronted, went out, and said to those Jews who were about him, that they should be of good courage, since Gaius's words indeed showed anger at them, but in reality had already set God against himself.|$|E

[...] However, when Louise {{fell in love with her}} brother Leopold's tutor, the Reverend Robinson Duckworth (14 years her senior), between 1866 and 1870, the Queen reacted by dismissing Duckworth in 1870. He later became Canon of Westminster Abbey.|$|E
500|$|Opinion {{about the}} value of Florida to the Union was mixed: some <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> useless land of swamps and horrible animals, while others <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> gift from God for {{national}} prosperity. In 1838 comments in The Army and Navy Chronicle supported future development of southern Florida: [...] climate [...] most delightful; but, from want of actual observation, [...] could not speak so confidently of the soil, although, from the appearance of the surrounding vegetation, a portion of it, at least, must be rich. Whenever the aborigines shall be forced from their fastnesses, as eventually they must be, the enterprising spirit of our countrymen will very soon discover the sections best adapted to cultivation, and the now barren or unproductive everglades will be made to blossom like a garden. It is the general impression that these everglades are uninhabitable during the summer months, by reason of their being overflowed by the abundant rains of the season; but if it should prove that these inundations are caused or increased by obstructions to the natural courses of the rivers, as outlets to the numerous lakes, American industry will remove these obstructions.|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} Piłsudski's plan was {{strongly}} criticized, {{and only the}} desperate situation of the Polish forces persuaded other commanders {{to go along with}} it. Though based on reliable intelligence, including decrypted Soviet radio communications, the plan was termed [...] "amateurish" [...] by high-ranking army officers and military experts who were quick to point out Piłsudski's lack of formal military education. When a copy of the plan fell into Soviet hands, Western Front commander Mikhail Tukhachevsky <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> ruse and disregarded it. Days later, the Soviets paid dearly for this when, during the Battle of Warsaw, the overconfident Red Army suffered one of its greatest defeats ever.|$|E
500|$|The musical {{performances}} and cover versions in the episode attracted generally positive reviews, {{though a few}} reviewers noted that the program had been on for twenty-three minutes before the first song appeared.

There was a Somerset committee member, who liked and admired him, and would greet him with, 'Morning, McCool'. That committee member was seeking to be courteous.

500|$|In {{classical}} Greece, Aristotle (384 – 322 BC) {{commented on}} the colour-changing abilities of the octopus, both for camouflage and for signalling, in his Historia animalium: [...] "The octopus... seeks its prey by so changing its colour as to render it like the colour of the stones adjacent to it; it does so also when alarmed." [...] Aristotle noted that the octopus had a hectocotyl arm and suggested it might be used in sexual reproduction. This claim was widely disbelieved until the 19th century. It was described in 1829 by the French zoologist Georges Cuvier, who supposed {{it to be a}} parasitic worm, naming it as a new species, Hectocotylus octopodis. Other zoologists <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> spermatophore; the German zoologist Heinrich Müller believed it was [...] "designed" [...] to detach during copulation. In 1856 the Danish zoologist Japetus Steenstrup demonstrated that it is used to transfer sperm, and only rarely detaches.|$|E
500|$|Mughal-e-Azam was {{the first}} {{black-and-white}} Hindi film to be digitally coloured {{and the first to}} be given a theatrical re-release. The Sterling Investment Corporation, the negative rights owner [...] and an arm of the Shapoorji Pallonji Group, undertook restoration and colourisation of Mughal-e-Azam and assigned Deepesh Salgia as Project Designer and Director. They initially approached Hollywood executives for help, but found the sales quotations, ranging from $12–15 million, too high. In 2002, Umar Siddiqui, managing director of the Indian Academy of Arts and Animation (IAAA), proposed to enhance it digitally {{at a fraction of the}} cost. To convince the Shapoorji Pallonji Group, one of India's wealthiest companies, of the commercial viability of the project, the IAAA colourised a four-minute clip and showed it to them. They approved and gave the project the go-ahead. Shapoorji Mistry, grandson of producer Shapoorji Pallonji Mistry, <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> fitting tribute to complete his grandfather's unfinished dream of colourising the entire film.|$|E
500|$|Wills finally {{returned}} to Queensland in May and {{was sworn in}} as a Justice of the Peace upon arrival in Brisbane. Over the next few months at Cullin-la-ringo, he reported at least three murders of local settlers by Aborigines, among them one of his shepherds. He accosted government officials, seeking the detachment of a Native Police Force to his station for protection, and scorned [...] "Brisbane saints" [...] for sympathising with the plight of Aborigines in the Nogoa region. With the cricket season approaching, Wills agreed to captain Queensland against New South Wales, and then left the colony to lead a Victoria XXII at the MCG against George Parr's All-England Eleven. In awe of his 1,800 mile dash across the continent to play cricket, the English <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> madman's journey.

[...] David Griffiths of Record Mirror praised the album's musical and lyrical scope, which {{included}} [...] "life-enhancing philosophy", and added: [...] "George Harrison's 'Within You Without You' is a beautifully successful and adventurous statement in song of a Yoga truth." [...] The Times of Indias music critic similarly admired the Beatles for [...] "explor farther reaches in the musical firmament" [...] and described Harrison's composition as a [...] "memorable" [...] track. In one of the few unfavourable reviews for Sgt. Pepper, Richard Goldstein, writing in The New York Times, said the song was [...] "remarkable" [...] musically and a highlight of the album, yet he considered the lyrics [...] "dismal" [...] and full of [...] "the very clichés the Beatles helped bury". Allen Evans of the NME found the [...] "deep, rich rhythm" [...] of the tabla [...] "most appealing", although he bemoaned that it was difficult to decipher the lyrics [...] "because they merge with the sitar music so closely".|$|E
500|$|It {{is unclear}} when Kujau {{produced}} his first Hitler diary. Stiefel says Kujau {{gave him a}} diary on loan in 1975. Schulze puts the date as 1976, while Kujau says he began in 1978, after a month's practice writing in the old German gothic script Hitler had used. Kujau used one of a pile of notebooks he had bought cheaply in East Berlin, and attempted to put the letters [...] "AH" [...] in gold on the front—purchasing plastic, Hong Kong-made letters from a department store, he inadvertently used [...] "FH" [...] rather than [...] "AH". He took the black ribbon from a genuine SS document, and attached it to the cover using a German army wax seal. For the ink he bought two bottles of Pelikan ink—one black, one blue—and mixed them with water so it would flow more easily from the cheap modern pen he used. Finally he sprinkled tea over the pages and bashed the diaries against his desk {{to give them an}} aged look. Kujau showed the first volume to Stiefel, who was impressed and <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> genuine Hitler diary; Stiefel wanted to buy it, but when the forger refused, the pair agreed that the collector could have it on loan.|$|E
500|$|In November 1921 Joseph {{organised}} the Morley {{forces to}} perform a large-scale pageant, celebrating the bicentenary {{of the church of}} St Martin-in-the-Fields. The text was by Laurence Housman and the music, directed by Holst, was taken from the Morley repertory. In the following year Joseph's increasing recognition as a composer was confirmed when her Seven Two-Part Songs were performed at a SWM concert that included works by Ethel Smyth and other women composers. Two of Joseph's works, A Hymn for Whitsuntide and A Festival Venite were introduced during the 1922 Whitsun festival at All Saints' church, Blackheath, with Holst conducting. After the Venite premiere Joseph wrote appreciatively to Holst: [...] "Do you suppose for one moment that any other conductor takes trouble like that? If you do, you are quite wrong". The Venite was performed on 13 June 1923 at the Queen's Hall, by the Philharmonic Choir under Charles Kennedy Scott; the Spectators critic <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> [...] "very notable addition to modern British music". Amidst her compositional and other activities, Joseph found time, in 1922, to organise the first Kensington Musical Competition Festival, and to orchestrate many of the competition songs. In due course this festival became an important annual event in Kensington; Vaughan Williams was among the adjudicators. On 12 October 1922, Vaughan Williams's 50th birthday, Joseph organised a choir which gave an early-morning surprise performance in the composer's garden of a song she had written to mark the occasion.|$|E

500|$|The {{spoliation}} of Bavaria led to entreaties {{from the}} Elector's wife, Theresa Kunegunda Sobieska, {{for him to}} divest himself of the French alliance. Although the Elector wavered somewhat in his allegiance to Louis XIV, his resolve to continue fighting against Leopold I and the Grand Alliance was stiffened when news arrived that Tallard's reinforcements– some 35,000 men– would soon be in Bavaria. Marlborough now intensified the policy of devastating the Elector's territory. On 16 July the Duke wrote to his friend Heinsius, the Grand Pensionary of Holland, [...] "We are advancing {{into the heart of}} Bavaria to destroy the country and oblige the Elector {{one way or the other}} to a compliance". The policy compelled the Elector to send 8,000 troops from Augsburg to defend his own property, reserving only a fraction of his army to join the French under Marsin and Tallard. But although Marlborough <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> necessary strategy to secure success, it was of doubtful morality. The Duke himself confessed his reservations to his wife, Sarah, [...] "This is so uneasy to my nature that nothing but an absolute necessity would have obliged me to consent to it. For these poor people suffer only for their master's ambition." [...] Accounts differ as to the actual amounts of damage done. De La Colonie thought that reports of the devastation were perhaps exaggerated for propaganda purposes; yet Christian Davies serving with Hay's Dragoons wrote, [...] "The allies sent parties on every hand to ravage the country... We spared nothing, killing, burning or otherwise destroying whatever we could not carry off." [...] To Historian David Chandler, Marlborough must bear the full responsibility for the destruction, for although he undoubtedly found it hard to stomach it was taken under Baden's, and the Emperor's protests.|$|E
