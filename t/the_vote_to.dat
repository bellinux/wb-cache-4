5|$|In 1832 the Reform Act {{was passed}} by Parliament, {{widening}} the electorate across the country. The Isle of Bute's electorate rose to 300 and acquired a permanent Member of Parliament, still controlled by Bute. Cardiff saw a short-term drop in its electorate {{as a result of}} the act, and Bute benefited from the granting of <b>the</b> <b>vote</b> <b>to</b> many of his richer agricultural tenants. In the aftermath of the reforms, Bute secretly sponsored the creation of the conservative newspaper the Glamorgan Monmouth and Brecon Gazette and Merthyr Guardian, to increase support across the county, and underwrote its losses for many years.|$|E

5|$|In the 2010 general election, the Moderate Party {{increased}} {{its share of}} <b>the</b> <b>vote</b> <b>to</b> 30.06%. The Alliance got a majority of votes cast, but with 173 seats no absolute majority in parliament. With the opposition divided mainly by the Sweden Democrats, Reinfeldt could remain in government, but with a greater need to seek consensus on matters of substance with the opposition parties.|$|E
5|$|In the {{subsequent}} election campaign, {{the party was}} deeply divided and unable to organise an effective political strategy. It changed leaders five times {{in less than two}} months, and in the 2002 general election decreased its share of <b>the</b> <b>vote</b> <b>to</b> 10.2%, almost two-thirds less than its previous share. Most of its voters sided with the ÖVP, which became the largest party in Austria with 43% of the vote. Nevertheless, the coalition government of the ÖVP and FPÖ was revived after the election; however, there was increasing criticism within the FPÖ against the party's mission of winning elections at any cost.|$|E

5|$|The Republicans chose lesser-known Congressman Rick Lazio {{to replace}} him. The {{election}} included a record $90 million in campaign expenditures between Clinton, Lazio, and Giuliani and national visibility. Clinton showed strength in normally Republican upstate areas and a debate blunder by Lazio solidified Clinton's previously shaky support among women. Clinton {{won the election}} in November 2000 with 55percent of <b>the</b> <b>vote</b> <b>to</b> Lazio's 43percent.|$|E
5|$|The contest drew {{national}} attention. Lazio blundered {{during a}} September debate by seeming to invade Clinton's personal space {{trying to get}} her to sign a fundraising agreement. The campaigns of Clinton and Lazio, along with Giuliani's initial effort, spent a record combined $90 million. Clinton won the election on November 7, 2000, with 55percent of <b>the</b> <b>vote</b> <b>to</b> Lazio's 43percent. She was sworn in as U.S. Senator on January 3, 2001, making her the first (and so far only) woman to have held an elected office either while, or after, serving as first lady.|$|E
