Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti (Jon Polito) arrive at the hospital to find the doctors working frantically on Thormann; Crosetti, a close friend of Thormann, becomes very emotional. Crosetti comforts Thormann's wife Eva (Edie Falco), but is privately told by Dr. Eli Devilbiss (Sean Whitesell) that Thormann may be blind or mentally disabled, even if he survives.

500|$|In the Elizabethan era, {{toothache}} was an ailment {{associated with}} lovers, as in Massinger and Fletcher's play The False One.

In Act V, scene 1, another character remarks: [...] "For there was never yet philosopher That could endure the toothache patiently." [...] In modern parlance, this translates to the observation that philosophers are still human and feel pain, even though they claim they have transcended human suffering and misfortune.

500|$|Nirvana {{released}} its first single, {{a cover of}} Shocking Blue's [...] "Love Buzz", in November 1988 on the Seattle independent record label Sub Pop. They did their first ever interview with John Robb in Sounds [...] who also made the release single of the week. The following month, the band began recording its debut album, Bleach, with local producer Jack Endino. Bleach was highly influenced by the heavy dirge-rock of the Melvins and Mudhoney, 1980s punk rock, and the 1970s heavy metal of Black Sabbath. Novoselic said in a 2001 interview with Rolling Stone that the band had played a tape in their van while on tour that had an album by The Smithereens {{on one side and}} an album by the extreme metal band Celtic Frost on the other, and noted that the combination probably played an influence as well. The money for the recording sessions for Bleach, listed as $606.17 on the album sleeve, was supplied by Jason Everman, who was subsequently brought into the band as the second guitarist. Though Everman did not actually play on the album, he received a credit on Bleach because, according to Novoselic, they [...] "wanted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> more at home in the band". Just prior to the album's release, Nirvana insisted on signing an extended contract with Sub Pop, making the band the first to do so with the label.|$|E

5|$|Due to Tom's illness, Falcon-Price {{takes over}} the {{operation}} of the station and the team must deal with his constant presence and the pressure which they are put under. Falcon-Price's constant attempts to prove that Tom is not up to his job have also grown more intense at Tom's initial sign of weakness. We see that Alex is having trouble dealing with his new role as a father, and, on top of this, Alex is stabbed by a criminal, and this begins to look as if it is all Tom's fault. The two rivals, Kelly and Joss, enter into new romances: Joss with a pickpocket victim and Kelly with a rival lawyer. They must deal with their constant jealousy of each other and their constant drive to outdo each other, as it had been ever since they left the Academy. Joss must also deal with his growing gambling debts and the consequences of these, including his being beaten up, his being forced to get a second job and his becoming homeless. He must also deal with the people around him who, in trying <b>to</b> help <b>him,</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> worse; particularly the arrival of his mother in town. Dismissed police officer Adam Cooper also arrives back in Mount Thomas, {{for the first time since}} Tom dismissed him in 1998. This time he arrives in Mount Thomas as a photocopier technician and wants to take revenge on Tom. In an attempt to do this, he tries to frame him for a crime he did not commit. In the heat of these allegations against Mount Thomas' top cop, there is the very real possibility that the Mount Thomas police station may be closed forever, and the team are forced to find new placements and the possibility of separation from one another.|$|R

During the reading (which stars Nina as a molecule and takes place after the destruction of the earth), Spike rudely answers a text on his phone, and dismisses Vanya's suggestion of a handwritten response. Vanya reacts by launching into an impassioned rant, criticizing America's cultural regression in communication and media, while fondly and wistfully recalling the surroundings and memories of his childhood.

40|$|In {{the present}} research, we {{investigated}} helpless {{behavior and the}} responses it elicits from others. Study One used the act-frequency approach to develop a self-report measure of prototypically helpless behaviors. In a sample of college students (n = 75), this measure was validated against ratings by others. Many of the prototypically helpless behaviors we identified were interpersonal in nature, implying that they entail dependency and perhaps manipulativeness. In Study Two, we asked young adult (n = 249) Ss how they responded to people who showed varying amounts of helplessness. The most frequent response {{was trying to help}} the helpless individual feel better. As the frequency of helpless behavior increased, people were less likely <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> or her <b>feel</b> better, less likely {{to go along with the}} helpless individual, more likely to become angry and more likely to ignore or avoid this individual. Implications of these results for applications of the learned helplessness model were discussed, in particular the need to be cautious in assuming that all instances of observed passivity are good examples of learned helplessness...|$|R

When his men are forced to eat cold rations for Christmas dinner, Walker obtains turkey and cranberry sauce for them from a rear echelon supply lieutenant at gunpoint. Casualties are heavy: young replacements are quickly killed before they can learn the tricks of survival in combat (which Walker confesses <b>to</b> Ernie <b>makes</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> like a murderer), Walker is always short of lieutenants, and the veterans lose men, including Wingless Murphy. After a night patrol to capture a prisoner, Warnicki suffers a nervous breakdown when, finally hearing his son's voice on the record, his pent up frustrations at the war are released. Walker sadly directs the others to subdue the hysterical sergeant and sends him to the infirmary. Ernie returns to the correspondents' quarters to write a piece on Murphy's death and is told by his fellow reporters that he has won the Pulitzer Prize for his combat reporting. Ernie again catches up with the outfit {{on the side of the}} road to Rome after Cassino has finally been taken. He greets Mew and a few of the old hands, but the pleasant reunion is interrupted when a string of mules is led into their midst, each carrying the dead body of a G.I. to be gently placed on the ground. A final mule, led by Dondaro, bears the body of Captain Walker. One by one, the old hands reluctantly come forth to express their grief in the presence of Walker's corpse.|$|R

Pam notices the copier malfunctioning when she uses it, but still wants to replace the chairs.

5000|$|As {{mentioned}} previously, Abraham Maslow {{was a key}} {{contributor to}} the establishment of a dependency need theory. His need theory, Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, is thought to help a person achieve the unsatisfied needs of one's self. In his hierarchy, he outlined five needs crucial to human development and happiness across the lifespan; they are thought to occur in stages. The five stages include, physiological needs, safety needs, social needs, self-esteem needs, and self-actualization. Physiological needs are needs that everyone has to have in order to survive, such as air, food, water, and sleep. After a person has attained these physiological needs, he or she then focuses his or her attention to safety needs. Safety needs help an individual feel secure in order <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> or her <b>feel</b> safe, physically and emotionally. An example of this can be seen in people's choices of where they choose to live and work, and attaining medical insurance. After safety needs are met, social needs are the focus of attention. Social needs have to do with interactions with others (friends, family, romantic partners) and receiving love. After these needs have been met, one's self-esteem needs begin to arise. Esteem needs can be both internal and external. Having and achieving self-respect, receiving attention, and accomplishing achievements are examples of self-esteem needs. After one succeeds in the area of self-esteem, self-actualization needs are to be met. One's full potential as a person, his or her self-actualization, helps him or her keep developing as a person throughout the lifespan. (Maslow, 2002) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{intention}} {{of this study}} is to interview teachers in order to create a picture of how they look at their work with IUP (Plan of individual development). The main question formulated in my study is in what way IUP can become a contribution to the learner´s development. All teachers who participated in the interviews believe that the purpose of the document is to be proactive, developing and positive for the pupils. The teachers also believe that it is intended to serve as a clarification for pupils as well as teachers. It´s clear to see that the IUP generally is believed to be a supportive resource in education. The results of the interviews, however, show that the document does not in any significant way function as a support to the pupils and their learning during the term.   Most of the attention is put into the meeting between teacher, parents and pupil (“utvecklingssamtal”) held once per term, in which the individual plan also is set up. A variety of reasons contribute to the fact that the majority of the responding teachers do not enable the pupils themselves to use the document on a regular basis in everyday work. Only one of the participating teachers stated that she actively encouraged pupils to use their IUP on a continual basis during their school day. In the other cases the IUP was filed and often kept locked up while the pupil and the parents kept a copy at home. However, the pupils are involved in the establishing of the IUP and are given a good opportunity to take part in formulating its goals, based on their capacities. The pupil´s own wording is important <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> or her <b>feel</b> that the IUP is fit for them. There were different statements about how much and how often the teachers participate in discussing the work of IUP with colleagues. One conclusion is that there was, in most of the cases, a will to create a common interpretation in order to get more out of the document...|$|R
