On women he says, “You <b>think</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of women in terms of sex. Think of them as human individuals for a while, dropping out the sex qualification, and you won’t be so sure of some of your generalizations about what they should and shouldn’t do”. John Dewey’s support helped to increase the support and popularity of Jane Addams’ Hull House and other settlement houses as well. With growing support, involvement of the community grew {{as well as the}} support for the women’s suffrage movement.|$|E

[...] "I always think of editing as instinctive or impressionist. Not to <b>think</b> <b>too</b> <b>much,</b> in a way, and feel it more." [...] Nolan also avoids using temp music while cutting his films.|$|E
500|$|The final line recalls an old English saying: [...] "All his swans {{are turned}} to geese", meaning all his {{expectations}} end in nothing; all his boasting ends in smoke, {{like a person}} who fancies he sees a swan on a river but finds it {{to be only a}} goose. The phrase is sometimes reversed (as Moore has done): [...] "All his geese are swans", which was commonly applied to people who <b>think</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of the beauty and talent of their children and derived from Aesop's fable [...] "The Eagle and the Owl".|$|E

500|$|The Chicago Tribunes Sid Smith {{found the}} film to be [...] "pretty lousy, despite a wealth of {{impressive}} special effects that end with {{an image of a}} completely demolished Chicago skyline." [...] He found the plot to be overly melodramatic and [...] "hokey" [...] with an excessive amount of coincidences and ill-fortunes thrown at the characters, despite the performances of the star-studded cast. Australia's The Age gave the film a slightly more favorable review, praising the stunts and special effects, though it noted the effects suffer from poor computer editing and referred to the film as [...] "a little entertaining supertrash" [...] that does require one to not <b>think</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> about the science to enjoy.|$|E
500|$|Before Other Ms development, Sakamoto did not <b>think</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> about [...] "what kind {{of person}} Samus Aran was and how she thinks and her personality", {{particularly}} because the games tried to depict Samus as a mysterious person. Sakamoto and Team Ninja put much focus on backstory in the game to present Samus as an [...] "appealing human character", something important for future installments, as players would get further interest in Samus' adventures. Hayashi {{said that one of}} the development team's goals was to have the player [...] "connect with Samus as the story and action develops". Sakamoto also said the game would [...] "bring everyone up to the same level of understanding in the Metroid universe", and would not only introduce the series to new players but also create new challenges for fans. The chronological setting between Super Metroid and Metroid Fusion was chosen because Sakamoto considered the period [...] "so critical that without addressing it, we wouldn't be able to make new games that show Samus' adventures that take place after the events of Metroid Fusion".|$|E

You cannot think about how much {{you want to win}} without the mind automatically generating defeat as a possibility, and that creates fear.

The tension in Miller's songs—it's never resolved—between guitar-driven pop and keyboard-based New Wave is like the tension between heart and mind, between a nerdy {{identity}} never fully embraced and a fear of something more." ...|$|E

2500|$|Simon pursued solo {{projects}} after Bridge over Troubled Water, reuniting occasionally with Garfunkel {{for various}} projects, {{such as their}} 1975 Top Ten single [...] "My Little Town." [...] Simon wrote it for Garfunkel, whose solo output Simon judged as lacking [...] "bite." [...] The song was included on their respective solo albums—Paul Simon's Still Crazy After All These Years and Garfunkel's Breakaway. Contrary to popular belief, the song is not autobiographical of Simon's early life in New York City. In 1981, they reunited again for the famous concert in Central Park, followed by a world tour and an aborted reunion album, to have been entitled <b>Think</b> <b>Too</b> <b>Much,</b> which was eventually released (without Garfunkel) as Hearts and Bones. Together, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the final}} game of the month Vancouver played the Rangers and former coach Alain Vigneault. Daniel Sedin said of the game: [...] "I know our former coach is over there, but once you get into the game you're not going to <b>think</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> about it. He was with us for seven years and he meant a lot to this franchise, so it's going to be fun seeing him again but once the game gets going we want the two points, and so does he". Tortarella stated: [...] "I'm not going to lie, it's a little weird for me coming back, but once the game starts, it's about playing and {{trying to find a way}} to get a win". The Canucks lost the game 5–2, {{finishing}} the month with 31 points, four points out of the final playoff spot.|$|E

2500|$|Attorney {{and author}} Mark Lane {{said that he}} interviewed several jurors after the trial. Although these {{interviews}} have never been published, Lane said {{that some of the}} jurors believed that Garrison had in fact proven to them that there really was a conspiracy to kill President Kennedy, but that Garrison had not adequately linked the conspiracy to Shaw or provided a motive. Author and playwright James Kirkwood, who was a personal friend of Clay Shaw, said that he spoke to several jury members who denied ever speaking to Lane. Kirkwood also cast doubt on Lane's claim that the jury believed there was a conspiracy. In his book American Grotesque, Kirkwood said that jury foreman Sidney Hebert told him: [...] "I didn't <b>think</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of the Warren Report either until the trial. Now I think a lot more of it than I did before...." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{he worried}} at these {{ideas and the}} Beagle Geology his illness intensified, with stomach upsets, {{headaches}} and heart troubles, so that he became overworked and laid up for days on end.

[...] "I hope I may be able to work on right hard during the next three years, otherwise I shall never have finished, – but I find the noddle & the stomach are antagonist powers, and that it is a great deal more easy to <b>think</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> in a day, than to think too little – What thought has to do with digesting roast beef, – I cannot say, but they are brother faculties." ...|$|E
2500|$|While Evans {{considered}} himself an acoustic pianist, from the 1970 album From Left to Right on, he also released some material with Fender-Rhodes piano intermissions. However, unlike other jazz players (e.g. Herbie Hancock) he never fully embraced the new instrument, and invariably ended up {{returning to the}} acoustic sound. [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> about the electronic thing, except that it's kind of fun to have it as an alternate voice. (...) [...] merely an alternate keyboard instrument, that offers {{a certain kind of}} sound that's appropriate sometimes. I find that it's a refreshing auxiliary to the piano—but I don't need it (...) I don't enjoy {{spending a lot of time}} with the electric piano. I play it for a period of time, then I quickly tire of it, and I want to get back to the acoustic piano." [...] He commented that electronic music: [...] "just doesn't attract me. I'm of a certain period, a certain evolution. I hear music differently. For me, comparing electric bass to acoustic bass is sacrilege." ...|$|E

2500|$|Silvers {{said of the}} editors' philosophy, that [...] "there was no subject we couldn't deal with. And {{if there}} was no book , we would deal with it anyway. We tried hard to avoid books that were simply {{competent}} rehearsals of familiar subjects, and we hoped to find books that would establish something fresh, something original." [...] In particular, [...] "We felt you had to have a political analysis of the nature of power in America – who had it, who was affected". The editors also shared an [...] "intense admiration for wonderful writers". Well-known writers were willing to contribute articles for the initial issues of the Review without pay because it offered them a chance to write a new kind of book review. [...] As Mark Gevisser explained: [...] "The essays ... made the book review form not just a report on the book and a judgment of the book, but an essay in itself. And that, I think, startled everyone – that a book review could be exciting in that way, could be provocative in that way." [...] Early issues included articles by such writers as Hardwick, Lowell, Jason Epstein, Hannah Arendt, W. H. Auden, Saul Bellow, John Berryman, Truman Capote, Paul Goodman, Lillian Hellman, Irving Howe, Alfred Kazin, Dwight Macdonald, Norman Mailer, Mary McCarthy, Norman Podhoretz, Philip Rahv, Adrienne Rich, [...] Susan Sontag, William Styron, Gore Vidal, Robert Penn Warren and Edmund Wilson. [...] The Review pointedly published interviews with European political dissidents, including Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Andrei Sakharov and Václav Havel. But, Silvers noted, it is a mystery whether [...] "reviews have a calculable political and social impact" [...] or will even gain attention: [...] "You mustn't <b>think</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> about influence – if you find something interesting yourself, that should be enough." ...|$|E
