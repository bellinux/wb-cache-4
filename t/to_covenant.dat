25|$|Piper {{does not}} don {{any of the}} typical hermeneutical frameworks, but claims he is furthest from dispensationalism, and closest <b>to</b> <b>Covenant</b> Theology, or a New Covenant Theology in matters of the Law and covenants, but agrees with the dispensationalist belief {{that there will be}} a millennium. He says that the Law was meant by God to reveal sin and show man's {{inability}} to live up to God's righteous standards. Christians, living under the New Covenant, are not under the Old Covenant law but able to fulfill its intent through faith in Jesus Christ.|$|E
25|$|Anderida {{was sold}} <b>to</b> <b>Covenant</b> Shipping Inc, Monrovia, Liberia, on 30 October 1981 and was renamed Truck Trader. She {{operated}} under {{the management of}} Manta Line Inc. Her port of registry was changed to Piraeus, Greece. On 3 December 1984, Truck Trader was sold to South Pacific Navigation Ltd, Wellington, New Zealand, and was renamed Sealink. During the delivery voyage to New Zealand, she suffered an engine failure. She was reflagged to New Zealand in 1985. Sealink served on the Wellington - Picton route but was withdrawn due to competition by Tranz Rail. In 1986, she was renamed Mirela and was laid up at Piraeus on 31 October.|$|E

500|$|When Andros {{took over}} the {{administration}} of New York in August 1688, {{he met with the}} Iroquois at Albany to renew <b>to</b> <b>covenant.</b> In this meeting he annoyed the Iroquois by referring to them as [...] "children" [...] (implying subservience to the English), rather than [...] "brethren" [...] (implying equality). He returned to Boston amid further attacks on the New England frontier by Abenaki parties, who admitted that they were doing so in part because of French encouragement.|$|E
500|$|A devout Catholic, Keating {{became a}} heavy donor to charity {{when he moved}} to Phoenix, {{donating}} $100,000 to the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul, more than $1 million <b>to</b> <b>Covenant</b> House, and another more than $1 million to Mother Teresa's operations, including lending her his helicopter when she was in Arizona so that she could visit remote Indian reservations in the state. [...] Covenant House's Father Bruce Ritter said of Keating, [...] "He makes you believe in Providence." [...] In 1983, Keating and his companies made legal but unusually large campaign donations in races for the Phoenix City Council, who were responsible for approving his building projects including water usage for residential developments built around artificial ponds. The scale of donations represented a change from past practice in local Phoenix politics; some council figures opposed the trend, while others readily asked for the funds.|$|E
2500|$|Professor Walter Brueggemann, {{formerly}} of Columbia Theological Seminary, suggested a chiastic structure to the Jacob narrative (shown {{in the chart}} below), moving from conflict with Esau to reconciliation with Esau. Within that is conflict with Laban moving <b>to</b> <b>covenant</b> with Laban. And within that, at the center, is the narrative of births, in which the birth of Joseph (at [...] ) marks the {{turning point in the}} entire narrative, after which Jacob looks toward the Land of Israel and his brother Esau. In the midst of the conflicts are the two major encounters with God, which occur at crucial times in the sequence of conflicts.|$|E

2500|$|The {{effectiveness}} {{of the use of}} state reporting has been questioned and as a result, a further mechanism for review was created in 2007; the UPR. The review was introduced to [...] "complement" [...] existing older mechanisms; particularly the State Reporting System. The Reports system has been regarded as weak for the fact it its success depends on the willingness of states to cooperate. Though in theory, reports should be an honest appraisal, constructive criticism of perceived failures to adhere <b>to</b> <b>Covenant</b> principles is unlikely. Further criticisms exist towards the length of the reports required as well as the onerous requirements, duplication of subject matter between various treaty reports and the lack of resources of the committee to process reports timely.|$|E
2500|$|In 1990, further changes {{included}} {{the elimination of}} all blood oaths and penalties. These penalties, representing what the member would rather suffer than reveal the sacred signs given them in the ceremony, were symbolized by gestures for having the throat cut, the breast cut open, and the bowels torn out. Changes also {{included the}} elimination of the five points of fellowship, the role of the preacher, and all reference to Lucifer's [...] "popes and priests" [...] were dropped. The ceremony was also changed to lessen the differences in treatment between men and women. Women no longer are required <b>to</b> <b>covenant</b> to obey their husbands, but instead must covenant only to follow their husbands as their husbands follow God. Also, Eve is no longer explicitly blamed for the Fall, and several references to Adam were replaced with references to Adam and Eve. The lecture at the veil was also cut, and some repetition was eliminated.|$|E

40|$|The law {{relevant}} <b>to</b> <b>covenants</b> {{has been}} described as a 2 ̆ 2 blundering conceptualist jungle full of semantic swamps 2 ̆ 2 which this chapter will attempt as far as possible <b>to</b> avoid. <b>Covenants</b> have always occupied an uncomfortable space in Australia based upon the limited ability to register these interests under the relevant Torrens title statutes. Covenants have been accommodated in many jurisdictions by permitting the notification of covenants. This situation has most likely resulted from the fact that the Torrens system was first developed at a time when the concept of <b>covenants</b> began <b>to</b> take shape after the impetus provided by Tulk v Moxhay in 1848. This has resulted in varied responses from different jurisdictions but generally these provisions have not adequately dealt with the difficulties that arise in the application of covenants under the Torrens system. These problems have in Queensland recently been made worse by the intrusion of concepts relevant to sustainable housing in relation <b>to</b> <b>covenants</b> which has not only cast further doubt on the already doubtful role of covenants in Queensland but has raised the level of complexity applying to these interests...|$|R

"'But {{what the}} chief now seemed, did not wholly blind them {{to what the}} chief had been; so that, though in no small degree {{influenced}} by his change of bearing, they still distrusted him enough <b>to</b> <b>covenant</b> with him, among other articles on their side, that though friendly visits should be exchanged between the wigwams and the cabins, yet the five cousins should never, on any account, be expected to enter the chief's lodge together. The intention was, though they reserved it, that if ever, {{under the guise of}} amity, the chief should mean them mischief, and effect it, it should be but partially; so that some of the five might survive, not only for their families' sake, but also for retribution's. Nevertheless, Mocmohoc did, upon a time, with such fine art and pleasing carriage win their confidence, that he brought them all together to a feast of bear's meat, and there, by stratagem, ended them. Years after, over their calcined bones and those of all their families, the chief, reproached for his treachery by a proud hunter whom he had made captive, jeered out, [...] "Treachery? pale face! 'Twas they who broke their covenant first, in coming all together; they that broke it first, in trusting Mocmohoc."' ...|$|E
60|$|Christ is {{a priest}} {{according}} <b>to</b> <b>covenant,</b> {{and in all}} his acts of mediation he has regard to that covenant; so long as that covenant abides in its strength, so long Christ's intercession is of worth. Hence, when God cast the old high priest out of doors, he renders this reason for his so doing: 'Because they continued not in my covenant'; that is, neither priests nor people. Therefore were they cast out of the priesthood, and the people pulled down as to a church state. (Heb 7:6-9) Now, the covenant by which Christ acteth, as a priest, {{so far as we}} are concerned therein, he also himself acteth our part, being, indeed, the Head and Mediator of the body; wherefore, God doth not count that the covenant is broken, though we sin, if Christ Jesus our Lord is found to do by it what by law is required of us. Therefore he saith, 'If his children break my law, and keep not my commandments, I will visit their sins with a rod,' &c. But their sins shall not shake my covenant with my Beloved, nor cause that I for ever should reject them. 'My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips. His seed will I make to endure for ever, his seed shall endure for ever.' (Psa 89:30-36) Hence, {{it is clear that the}} covenant stands good to us as long as Christ stands good to God, or before his face; for he is not only our Mediator by covenant, but he himself is our conditions to God-ward; therefore he is said to be 'a covenant of the people,' or that which the holy God, by law, required of us. (Isa 42:6) Hence, again, he is said to be our justice or righteousness; to wit, which answereth to what is required of us by the law. He is made unto us of God so, and in our room and in our stead presenteth himself to God. So, then, if any ask me by what Christ's priesthood is continued, I answer, by covenant; for that the covenant by which he is made priest abideth of full force. If any ask whether the church is concerned in that covenant, I answer, yea; yet so as that all points and parts thereof, that concern life and death everlasting, is laid upon his shoulders, and he alone is the doer of it. He is the Lord our righteousness, and he is the Saviour of the body, so that my sins break not the covenant; but them15 notwithstanding, God's covenant stands fast with him, with him for evermore. And good reason, if no fault can be found with Christ, who is the person that did strike hands with his Father upon our account and for us; to wit, to do what was meet should be found upon us when we came to appear before God by him.|$|E
