5|$|Goldfaden left Romania in 1896; soon Juvilier's was {{the only}} active Yiddish theater troupe in the country, and foreign troupes had almost entirely ceased coming to the country. Although Lateiner, Horowitz, and Shumer kept writing, and {{occasionally}} managed <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> play, {{it was not a}} good time for Yiddish theater – or any theater – in Romania, and would only become worse as the economy continued to decline.|$|E

The band {{performed}} and answered questions in MuchMusic's studios in Toronto, Ontario. The session was broadcast live to HMV stores worldwide {{and on a}} webcast so that fans could watch and ask the band questions through MuchMusic's VJs. Sales of Tragic Kingdom doubled the week after the event. The event's sponsors lobbied Guinness World Records to create a category for the largest virtual in-store promotion to recognize the event.|$|E

In September 2011, Balotelli was reportedly seen using his iPad whilst on the substitutes' bench for Italy during their game with the Faroe Islands, although he denied this {{on a visit to}} a prison later that week.|$|E
5|$|As {{they return}} to the city, Olivia and Charlie discuss plans with Astrid on how to capture Milo, but realize that since he can predict their every move, any plan would be futile, and {{approach}} the hotel directly. Milo leads Olivia on a chase through a construction area including a marked zone where the air is too thin, expecting to crush her under a load of cement bricks. Olivia, unaware of the warning signs for the zone, races through it instead of stopping <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> respirator, nearly asphyxiating herself, and dodges the bricks in time to capture Milo. At the center, Dr. Levin notes that Milo's condition is too far advanced to reverse, and only a computer is {{able to keep up}} with his thoughts. Madeline sadly leaves the toy horse at Milo's side.|$|E
5|$|Conscientious objectors {{who refused}} noncombatant service during World War I were imprisoned in {{military}} facilities such as Fort Lewis (Washington), Alcatraz Island (California) and Fort Leavenworth (Kansas). The government assumed that COs could {{be converted into}} soldiers once they were exposed to life in their assigned military camps. Simultaneously the Justice Department was preparing to indict 181 Mennonite leaders for violating the espionage act because of a statement they adopted against performing military service. The draftees' refusal <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> uniform or cooperate in any way caused difficulties for both {{the government and the}} COs. The treatment received by nearly 2000 of these absolute COs included short rations, solitary confinement and physical abuse so severe as to cause the deaths of two Hutterite draftees.|$|E

Medium Alison proudly tells Joan that she has written {{a letter to}} her parents telling them that she is a lesbian, but begins to second-guess herself (beginning to wonder if she's asexual) until Joan kisses her. That night, she is excited and joyful at having had sex with Joan ("Changing My Major").|$|E
5|$|At the Sabre store opening, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{attempts}} <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> theatrical {{presentation to}} impress Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate). Dwight assigns {{the members of}} his team various tasks: Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) is to act like a hipster to make the Sabre Pyramid more appealing, Cathy (Lindsey Broad) is to flirt with the bloggers, Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) is to give a presentation to wow the critics, and Todd Packer (David Koechner) is to play the part of a sexual predator— much to Packer's chagrin. As the grand opening progresses, things begin to fall apart. Several bloggers notice Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) using his old cell phone instead of his Sabre Arrowhead phone, resulting in a reprimand from Nellie. Erin disappears with a group of seniors after Dwight drives them away, fearing their age will frighten the youth. Ryan has a panic attack and, after being consoled by Dwight and Jim— who imitate Kelly and his mother respectively in an attempt to calm him down— leaves to go to his parents' house. Jim is forced to give the presentation, which, despite a rocky start, impresses the crowd. After the opening, Dwight is named vice president by Nellie.|$|E
5|$|Brown was {{recalled}} for {{the match}} against Cambridge University, opening with Morris while Barnes rested. After putting on 64 {{for the opening}} wicket with Morris, Brown added 176 for the second wicket with Ron Hamence. He added a further 140 for the fourth wicket with Lindsay Hassett, who was captaining the team while Bradman rested himself. Brown top-scored with 200 and Hassett declared when his double-centurion was out with the score at 4/414. Australia {{went on to win}} by an innings. In the following match against Essex, Brown opened with Barnes while Morris was rested. The pair put on 145 in 97 minutesthe highest opening stand by the Australians on the tour to that pointbefore Barnes was out hit wicket. In the meantime, Brown had reached 50 in 90 minutes. Bradman came in and he and Brown accelerated <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> second-wicket partnership of 219 in 90 minutes, before the latter was out for 153 from three hours of batting with the score at 2/364. Brown had scored his last 100 runs in less than 90 minutes. Australia went on to score 721 runs on the first day, the highest number of runs amassed in one day of first-class cricket, before completing victory by an innings and 451 runs, their largest winning margin for the tour. Opening with Morris while Barnes was rested, Brown completed his third century in as many innings with 108 against Oxford University, after putting on an opening stand of 139. This meant that he had scored 461 runs in eight days of cricket, and put him atop the batting aggregates, ahead of Bradman. Australia went on to complete their fourth successive innings victory.|$|E
