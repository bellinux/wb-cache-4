2500|$|Thérèse's {{final years}} {{were marked by}} a steady decline that she bore resolutely and without complaint. Tuberculosis was the key element of Thérèse's final suffering, but she saw {{that as part of}} her spiritual journey. After observing a {{rigorous}} Lenten fast in 1896, she went to bed on the eve of Good Friday and felt a joyous sensation. She wrote: [...] "Oh! how sweet this memory really is! ... I had scarcely laid my head upon the pillow when I felt something like a bubbling stream mounting <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>lips.</b> I didn't know what it was." [...] The next morning her handkerchief was soaked in blood and she understood her fate. Coughing up of blood meant tuberculosis, and tuberculosis meant death. She wrote, [...] "I thought immediately of the joyful thing that I had to learn, so I went over to the window. I was able to see that I was not mistaken. Ah! my soul was filled with a great consolation; I was interiorly persuaded that Jesus, on the anniversary of His own death, wanted to have me hear His first call!" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{sat with}} my coffee-cup halfway <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>lips</b> {{and stared at}} Barrymore.|$|E
60|$|CHANCELLOR. I {{ask your}} pardon, Sire. It came, somehow, pat <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|E
60|$|RANDALL [having tried <b>to</b> play]. <b>My</b> <b>lips</b> are trembling. I can't get a sound.|$|R
60|$|Beatrice, {{from behind}} the old ladies, {{regarded}} me intently and without hostility. I am inclined to think the modification of my face through the damage <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>lip</b> interested her. It became dimly apparent <b>to</b> <b>my</b> confused intelligence that I must not say these two had been playing with me. That would not be after the rules of their game. I resolved in this difficult situation upon a sulky silence, and to take whatever consequences might follow.|$|R
6000|$|... "Harp and carp, Thomas," [...] she said, [...] "Harp and carp, along wi' me, And if ye dare <b>to</b> kiss <b>my</b> <b>lips,</b> Sure of your bodie I will be!" ...|$|R
60|$|I bent down, and I {{raised her}} hands <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>lips</b> and kissed them.|$|E
60|$|We were alone. She gave me her fingers, which I raised <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} repress the exclamation that rose <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>lips</b> {{when she stood}} before me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Small of faith! Small of faith!" [...] {{cried the}} sompnour. [...] "Ah, Sir Didymus yet walks upon earth! And yet no words of doubt can bring anger to mine heart, or a bitter word <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>lip,</b> for am I not a poor unworthy {{worker in the}} cause of {{gentleness}} and peace? Of all these pardons which I bear every one is stamped and signed by our holy father, the prop and centre of Christendom." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know that}} I am <b>to</b> hold <b>my</b> tongue, sir!" [...] said Mr. Bruff, impatiently. [...] "Being habitually {{silent on the}} subject of human folly, I am all the readier <b>to</b> keep <b>my</b> <b>lips</b> closed on this occasion. Does that satisfy you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe I {{can trust}} you," [...] she said. [...] "Now listen! The one {{consideration}} on which I consent <b>to</b> open <b>my</b> <b>lips,</b> is consideration for Miss Emily's tranquillity. Promise me absolute secrecy, on your word of honor." ...|$|R
60|$|I turned {{trembling}} to Jane, hardly {{daring to}} frame the question that rose first <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'What {{has risen}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>lips</b> now, would have risen <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>lips</b> then, {{if you had}} given me a moment's help. I don't reproach you, father. What you have never nurtured in me, you have never nurtured in yourself; but O! if you had only done so long ago, or if you had only {{neglected}} me, what a much better and much happier creature I should have been this day!' ...|$|E
60|$|The cup {{of coffee}} was arrested half-way <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>lips</b> as I stared in amazement at the man's serious face.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am almost afraid <b>to</b> open <b>my</b> <b>lips</b> in your presence," [...] Mrs. Luna broke in, [...] "but I {{must say}} that I think my sister was strangely communicative. She told you ever so much that I wouldn't have breathed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mahdi," [...] he said, impressively, {{as he drew}} himself up, [...] "you {{have indeed}} the power to torture and kill me, but you have not the power <b>to</b> open <b>my</b> <b>lips,</b> or cause me to bring dishonour on my country!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, he couldn't,--and wouldn't if he could. The {{bishop and}} Frank {{are the best}} friends in the world. But {{that has nothing to}} do with it. You mustn't abuse the chapel to Frank; just at this moment the subject is tabooed. My belief is that the whole edifice will have to come down, and that the {{confusion}} of Mr. Puddleham and the Marquis will be something more complete than ever was yet seen. In the meantime, I put <b>my</b> finger <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>lip,</b> and just look at Frank whenever the chapel is mentioned." ...|$|R
60|$|This I {{said because}} my {{hours in the}} boat had made me humble, also because the words came <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|E
60|$|At {{that instant}} my eye fell upon {{something}} which brought hope {{to my heart}} and a shout of joy <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|E
60|$|My mother, {{who until}} this time {{had made no}} change in her position, raised her hand up <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>lips</b> and stopped me.|$|E
6000|$|He put his {{handkerchief}} to it. 'Is it bleeding still? It is {{a trick of}} mine <b>to</b> bite <b>my</b> <b>lip</b> when I am vexed. It seems to help to keep down words. There! I have given myself a mark of this hateful outbreak.' ...|$|R
60|$|Now I {{tried to}} speak once more, but the Spaniard who had struck me, a ferocious-looking villain, drew his sword and swore that he would run me through if I dared <b>to</b> open <b>my</b> <b>lips.</b> So I thought it well to keep silent.|$|R
6000|$|... "George Lechmere came, father," [...] Martha said, with {{an angry}} toss of her head, [...] "but {{when he saw}} me talking to Captain Mallett he turned and went off; just as if I was not <b>to</b> open <b>my</b> <b>lips</b> <b>to</b> any man but himself." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{raised my}} trumpet <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>lips.</b> At first I could make no sound, but, {{controlling}} my agitation a little, I shouted: [...] "Yes!" ...|$|E
60|$|She held a glass <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>lips</b> {{from which}} I drank gratefully, then, with the submissiveness of a babe, I obeyed her and slept.|$|E
60|$|I sat up, {{opened my}} eyes, {{and carried the}} tankard <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>lips</b> with both my hands. And as I drank I looked at Pons.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, ma'am," [...] {{said the}} stout man, with animation, [...] "I've got one, and I'd like nothin' {{better than to}} tell it to you if you'll {{give me a little}} somethin' <b>to</b> wet <b>my</b> <b>lips</b> with--a little beer, or whiskey and water, or {{anything}} you have convenient." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly you may {{understand}} that," [...] replied Vernon. [...] "Unless {{my character}} is attacked {{and it becomes}} necessary for me <b>to</b> defend myself, <b>my</b> <b>lips</b> are sealed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You've helped already," [...] Hunterleys replied. [...] "I {{have been}} {{nearly three months}} without being able <b>to</b> open <b>my</b> <b>lips</b> <b>to</b> a soul. People call me secretive, but I feel very human sometimes. I know that not a word of what I have said will pass your lips." ...|$|R
60|$|I coughed {{to cover}} up the exclamation of disbelief that rose <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>lips</b> and remarked blandly that two {{thousand}} years was certainly a long time.|$|E
6000|$|She {{extended}} {{her hand and}} I, recalling the instructions of my most romantic fiction, raised it <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>lips.</b> [...] "Good-bye!" [...] I huskily said, and turned away.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I won't {{tell you}} a word until you drink," [...] {{repeated}} my friend, as he looked anxiously {{in my face and}} held the flask <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|E
6000|$|He left me, and I breathed freely again. I had no fears, no hesitation. I never {{dreamt of}} turning back; but I began <b>to</b> find <b>my</b> task more {{difficult}} even than I had imagined. It was his touch, his passionate looks and words which were so hard <b>to</b> endure. <b>My</b> <b>lips</b> could lie, {{but it was}} hard <b>to</b> govern <b>my</b> looks; and oh, how I hated him! ...|$|R
60|$|The {{matter was}} immensely serious {{for all the}} parties concerned, but there was {{in the manner of}} his answer such a cheerful effrontery that I had <b>to</b> bite <b>my</b> <b>lips</b> in order not to laugh. I {{reminded}} myself that his behaviour was abominable. I worked myself up into a state of moral indignation.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't dislike him, certainly, as you do. But how can I {{love him}} when {{he tells me he}} wants me to give up everything, all our work, our faith, our future, never to give another address, <b>to</b> open <b>my</b> <b>lips</b> in public? How can I consent to that?" [...] Verena went on, smiling strangely.|$|R
