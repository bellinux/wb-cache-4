40|$|Capturing ammonia from anaerobically digested manure could {{simultaneously}} {{decrease the}} adverse effects of ammonia inhibition on biogas production, reduce reactive nitrogen (N) loss to the environment, and produce mineral N fertilizer as a by-product. In this study, gas permeable membranes (GPM) were used to capture ammonia from dairy manure and digestate by the diffusion of gaseous ammonia across the membrane where ammonia is captured by diluted acid, forming an aqueous ammonium salt. A lab-scale prototype using tubular expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) GPM was used to (1) characterize the effect of <b>total</b> <b>ammonium</b> nitrogen (TAN) concentration, temperature, and pH on the ammonia capture rate using GPM, and (2) to evaluate {{the performance of a}} GPM system in conditions similar to a mesophilic anaerobic digester.

The ammonia capture rate could be predicted using non-linear regression based on the factors of <b>total</b> <b>ammonium</b> nitrogen concentration, temperature, and pH.

40|$|High-nitrogen {{loadings}} {{of rivers}} and aquifers systems {{are a major}} concern because of potential effects on human health and water quality impacts such as eutrophication of lakes and coastal zones. This nitrogen enrichment is commonly attributed to anthropogenic sources such as sewage and agricultural and industrial wastes. The aims {{of this study were}} to delineate spatial distribution of groundwater ammonium in the coastal aquifer system in Pearl River Delta (PRD), China and to identify the origin of the abnormally high ammonium. A total of 40 boreholes were drilled to collect core samples of the aquitard and groundwater samples in the basal aquifer. The core samples were used for extraction of pore water for centrifugation and bulk chemical analyses in laboratory. Unlike previous studies which focused mainly on the aquifer, this study treated the aquifer-aquitard system as a hydrogeochemical continuum. The results show that the aquifer-aquitard system contains an exceptionally large <b>total</b> <b>ammonium</b> mass. Ammonium occurred at concentrations up to 390 mg/L in the basal sand Pleistocene aquifer 20 - 50 m deep, the largest concentration reported for groundwater globally. This ammonium was natural, areally extensive (1600 km 2) and originated in the overlying Holocene-Pleistocene aquitard and entered the aquifer by groundwater transport and diffusion. <b>Total</b> <b>ammonium</b> in the aquifer (190 × 10 6 kg) was exceeded by <b>total</b> <b>ammonium</b> in the aquitard (8600 × 10 6 kg) by a factor of 45. Much organic nitrogen remained in the aquitard available for conversion to ammonium. This natural ammonium in the aquifer was slowly transported into the PRD river channels and the estuary of the South China Sea. The rate of this contribution will likely be greatly increased by sand dredging in the river channels and estuary. Although the ammonium in PRD groundwater occurred in the largest concentrations and mass reported globally, the literature shows no reports of other delta aquitards having been examined for ammonium occurrence and therefore abundant ammonium formed in aquitards rich in organic matter may not be uncommon and this "geologic" source of ammonium may present a large and hitherto unappreciated source of nitrogen discharging to surface waters. © 2010 American Chemical Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Summer cyanobacterial blooms {{caused an}} {{elevation}} in pH (9 to ~ 10. 5) {{that lasted for}} weeks in the shallow and tidal-fresh region of the Sassafras River, a tributary of Chesapeake Bay (USA). Elevated pH promoted desorption of sedimentary inorganic phosphorus and facilitated conversion of ammonium (NH 4 +) to ammonia (NH 3 ). In this study, we investigated pH effects on exchangeable NH 4 + desorption, nutrient pore water diffusion and flux rates of NH 4 +, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), nitrate (NO 3 &ndash;), nitrification, denitrification, and oxygen consumption. pH elevation enhanced the desorption of exchangeable NH 4 + because of NH 3 formation from both pore water and adsorbed NH 4 + pools. Progressive penetration of high pH from the overlying water into sediment promoted the release of SRP and <b>total</b> <b>ammonium</b> (NH 4 + and NH 3 ) into pore water. At elevated pH, high sediment-water effluxes of SRP and <b>total</b> <b>ammonium</b> were associated with reduction in nitrification, denitrification and oxygen consumption rates. Alkaline pH and the toxicity of NH 3 may inhibit nitrification in the thin aerobic zone, simultaneously constraining coupled nitrification-denitrification with limited NO 3 &ndash; supply and high pH penetration into the anaerobic zone.

40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} CO 2 induced seawater acidification on the concentration of inorganic nutrients, nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, soluble reactive phosphorous (SRP) and silicate at a coastal site in the Western English Channel (WEC). Samples were collected and filtered weekly during the spring to summer transition between 17 th March and 21 st July 2008. Ambient pH varied by 0. 2 units over the study period, while purging with CO 2 (380, 500, 760 and 1000 ppmv) resulted in a maximum pH decrease of 0. 4 units. Surface nitrate was depleted during the spring phytoplankton bloom and nitrogen limitation was prevalent thereafter. Acidification did not change the concentrations of nitrate, nitrite, SRP or silicate. An average increase in <b>total</b> <b>ammonium</b> of 0. 17 μmol L - 1 (20) was observed in acidified seawater during the pre-bloom period. We suggest that this increase was not a biological interaction but due to the influx of gaseous ammonia from the atmosphere; CO 2 induced acidification shifted the seawater dissolved ammonium-ammonia equilibrium towards the former and thereby decreased the sea-air concentration gradient of ammonia. Using {{the results from this}} study, a simple zero-dimensional model for the WEC was constructed which shows that this region will become a net sink for 300 mol m - 2 a - 1 for NH 3 if atmospheric CO 2 concentrations increase to 717 ppm.

In this work the impact of technological parameters on the effect of removing contaminants from {{wastewater treatment plants}} SBR was presented. The following indicators of contamination were analysed: Biochemical Oxygen Demand for 5 days (BOD 5), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), <b>total</b> nitrogen, <b>ammonium</b> nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, total suspensions. During the research, one of the reactors was converted into a hybrid reactor. Nevertheless, the operation of the reactor was unstable due to the uncontrolled use of biopreparations. Wastewater discharged into the soil from the studied small wastewater treatment plants met the requirements of the Ordinance – reduction of total suspended solids by at least 50 % and BOD 5 – 20 %. It was found that one should not unduly interfere with the operation of onsite wastewater treatment plants, but their work should be monitored...|$|R
40|$|Relationships between {{available}} nitrogen {{determined by}} two anaerobic incubation methods (30 °C for 2 weeks: 40 °C for 1 week) and seven chemical indexes (Organic C, <b>total</b> N, <b>ammonium</b> released by acid dichromate, acid permanganate, alkaline permanganate, hydrogen peroxide and dilute sulfuric acid) and nitrogen percent in rice plant, nitrogen uptake and dry-matter yield of IR 26 rice grown under submerged conditions in pots were investigated using 39 Philippine wetland rice soils differing markedly in their capacities to supply nitrogen. It {{was found that}} all the availability indexes were best correlated with nitrogen uptake of rice followed by N% in rice plants at 55 days after seeding. Dry-matter yield of rice was also significantly correlated with the available nitrogen status but the correlation coefficients were the lowest. It is concluded that for unfertilized soils, nitrogen uptake provides a better criterion for evaluating the performance of nitrogen availability indexes for wetland rice...|$|R
