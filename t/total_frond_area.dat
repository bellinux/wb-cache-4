40|$|Lemna sp. growth {{inhibition}} test standardized protocols suggest {{the use of}} compounds such as 3, 5 -dichlorophenol as reference substances for checking the test organism’s sensitivity routinely. However, this and other recommended chemicals present risks to human health and to the environment. Sodium chloride (NaCl) appears as a less toxic alternative reference substance which has been successfully used in routine ecotoxicological tests. However, the evaluation of this compound in multiple growth endpoints used in the L. minor test, which is required for recommending it as a reference substance for this test organism, {{has not yet been}} reported. In the present study, NaCl was tested with L. minor for the growth endpoints frond number, <b>total</b> <b>frond</b> <b>area</b> and fresh weight. Results showed acceptable sensitivity and reproducibility (coefficient of variance < 15. 0 %) for all three of the measured endpoints. Statistically significant differences were observed between the EC 50 values calculated based on the three endpoints (p < 0. 05). <b>Total</b> <b>frond</b> <b>area</b> was the most sensitive one, with average EC 50 value of 2742. 80 ± 245. 7 mg L- 1.

40|$|ABSTRACT. —The {{density and}} frond traits of the dimorphic fern Osmunda regalis were {{examined}} in 45 populations situated in central Italy, along a gradient of forest canopy cover and deer grazing. The survey involved 1704 ramets containing 6416 fronds, of which 5643 were sterile and 773 fertile. Within the ramets, the number of fertile fronds increased {{with the number of}} sterile fronds and with the mean height of ramets. Light seemed to promote fertility, as the number of fertile fronds decreased with increasing canopy cover. Fewer and smaller fronds were found in plots with high forest canopy cover. Our results showed that O. regalis performed best in conditions of full sunlight but can persist and recruit young sporophytes under closed canopy. As many marsh and lake environments have disappeared or been altered by human activity, more populations were located under high canopy cover in the forest than in open habitats. Deer grazing caused a significant decrease in fertile fronds, in <b>total</b> <b>frond</b> <b>area</b> and in ramet height, but the number of ramets and sterile fronds were unaffected. In conclusion, plant density and frond traits of O. regalis responded differently to the availability of light and to grazing...|$|E
40|$|Reports were scanned {{in black}} and white at a {{resolution}} of 600 dots per inch and were converted to text using Adobe Paper Capture Plug-inShade adaptation of both gametophytes and sporophytes of a Hawaiian tree-fern, (Cibotium glaucum (Sm.) H. & A.) was measured by growing plants under a range of light intensities and at 2 daylengths, at 20 or 25 °C. Three ecophysiological parameters of shade adaptation and adjustment, initial slope of the photosynthesis curve in response to increasing light intensity (α), rate of light saturated photosynthesis (PN max), and rate of photosynthesis at the intensity given during growth (PN growth), were determined by infra•red gas analysis. Both sporophytes and gametophytes showed shade adaptation by a decline in α with increasing irradiation during growth and shade adjustment by a light saturation value for shade-grown plants that was well above the level of light at which the plants were grown. Sporophytes exhibited one feature of sun plants; PN max increased with increasing irradiation during growth. Morphological adaptations to low light intensity included a narrowing of the gametophyte, higher chlorophyll contents on a fresh weight basis of both gametophytes and sporophytes, and reduced thickness of sporophyte fronds. A greater <b>total</b> <b>frond</b> <b>area</b> of shade•grown sporophytes was brought about by a greater area of individual fronds and a longer retention time of fronds. Rates of frond production and expansion were little affected by light intensity. This work was supported by funds from the U. S. International Biological Program, Island Ecosystems IRP.

In this study, growth, carbon dioxide exchange rate (CER) and evapotranspiration (ET) were measured in Azolla caroliniana, A. microphylla and A. pinnata mats grown in a greenhouse at 100, 65, and 35 % of ambient light levels. Although A. caroliniana had higher <b>frond</b> <b>area</b> index (FAI) and specific <b>frond</b> <b>area,</b> its CER per unit frond weight was significantly lower than A. microphylla and A. pinnata at a photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 300 μmol m^ s^ probably due to mutual shading; at 1300 μmol m^ s^, however, the differences in CERs among the species were not significant. At any given PPFD, CER per unit weight decreased in the order A. caroliniana>A. microphylla>A. pinnata, and with increasing biomass per unit area from 500 to 1500 g m^. ET of the azolla canopy was {{more closely related to}} FAI than to CER. The results indicate that A. caroliniana, which has a lower optimun FAI than A. microphylla, needs to be more frequently harvested to maximise biomass production.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} homeopathically potentized Arsenicum album, nosode, and gibberellic acid in a bioassay with arsenic-stressed duckweed (Lemna gibba L.). The test substances were applied in nine potency levels (17 x, 18 x, 21 x– 24 x, 28 x, 30 x, 33 x) and compared with controls (unsuccussed and succussed water) regarding their influence on the plant’s growth rate. Duckweed was stressed with arsenic(V) for 48 h. Afterwards, plants grew in either potentized substances or water controls for 6 days. Growth rates of <b>frond</b> (leaf) <b>area</b> and <b>frond</b> number were determined with a computerized image analysis system for different time intervals (days 0 – 2, 2 – 6, 0 – 6). Five independent experiments were evaluated for each test substance. Additionally, five water control experiments were analyzed to investigate {{the stability of the}} experimental setup (systematic negative control experiments). All experiments were randomized and blinded. The test system exhibited a low coefficient of variation (≈ 1 %). Unsuccussed and succussed water did not result in any significant differences in duckweed growth rate. Data from the control and treatment groups were pooled to increase statistical power. Growth rates for days 0 – 2 were not influenced by any homeopathic preparation. Growth rates for days 2 – 6 increased after application of potentized Arsenicum album regarding both <b>frond</b> <b>area</b> (p < 0. 001) and frond number (p < 0. 001), and by application of potentized nosode (<b>frond</b> <b>area</b> growth rate only, p < 0. 01). Potencies of gibberellic acid did not influence duckweed growth rate. The systematic negative control experiments did not yield any significant effects. Thus, false-positive results can be excluded with high certainty. To conclude, the test system with L. gibba impaired by arsenic(V) was stable and reliable. It yielded evidence for specific effects of homeopathic Arsenicum album preparations and it will provide a valuable tool for future experiments that aim at revealing the mode of action of homeopathic preparations. It may also be useful to investigate the influence of external factors (e. g., heat, electromagnetic radiation) on the effects of homeopathic preparations...|$|R

In a first approach, the effect of different concentrations of AsO 43 - and Pb(II) on the growth and accumulation of these metals was studied. The plants tolerated concentrations of 20 - 40 muM Pb(II) and 200 muM of AsO 43 -. Toxic effects occurred when 20 muM of Pb(II) and 100 muM AsO 43 - were used. These effects included growth inhibition (decreased yield of biomass and <b>frond</b> <b>area)</b> as well as an altered frond (leaf-like structure in ferns) appearance and tissue consistence. S. minima showed a high uptake of Pb (34 mg/g dry weight) compared to As (0. 5 mg/g dry weight). The uptake of As was inhibited by phosphate.

40|$|A new {{phytotoxicity}} {{test method}} based on root elongation of three Lemna species (Lemna gibba, L. minor, and L. paucicostata) has been developed. Tests with aquatic plants have, typically, favored measurements on fronds (e. g. <b>frond</b> number, <b>area,</b> biomass) {{rather than on}} roots, due, in part, to issues associated with handling fragile roots and the time-consuming procedures of selecting roots with identical root lengths. The present method differs in that roots were excised prior to exposure with subsequent measurements on newly developed roots. Results show that there were species-specific difference in sensitivity to the five metals tested (Ag, Cd, Cr, Cu and Hg), with Ag being the most toxic (EC 50 = 5. 3 - 37. 6 μgL(- 1)) to all three species, and Cr the least toxic for L. gibba and L. minor (1148. 3 and 341. 8 μgL(- 1), respectively) and Cu for L. paucicostata (470. 4 μgL(- 1)). Direct comparisons were made with measurements of <b>frond</b> <b>area,</b> which {{were found to be}} less sensitive. More generally, root re-growth was shown to reflect the toxic responses of all three Lemna species to these five important metals. The root growth bioassay differs from three internationally standardized methods (ISO, OCED and US EPA) in that it is completed in 48 h, the required volume of test solutions is only 3 ml and non-axenic plants are used. Our results show that the Lemna root method is a simple, rapid, cost-effective, sensitive and precise bioassay to assess the toxic risks of metals and has practical application for monitoring municipal and industrial waste waters where metals are common constituents...|$|R

D. poha occurs only in southern New Zealand and on some New Zealand islands (including the Auckland and Snares Islands), whereas D. antarctica has a wider distribution, and is found around New Zealand, Chile and the sub-Antarctic islands. In southern New Zealand, D. poha and D. antarctica can be found growing together, although D. poha normally grows higher up or further back on the rock platforms, or in more sheltered bays, where wave force is weaker.

We found that P. vittata L. had a very high tolerance to Zn and grew normally at sites with high Zn concentrations. In addition, P. vittata L. could effectively take up Zn into its fronds, with a maximum of 737 mg kg - 1 under field conditions. In pot experiments, the accumulated Zn concentration increased significantly as the Zn treatment was raised from 0 to 2000 mg kg - 1, with a maximum Zn accumulation of 0. 22 mg pot - 1. Although the concentration of As in P. vittata L. was reduced {{by the addition of}} Zn, <b>total</b> <b>frond</b> accumulation of As was elevated when the Zn treatment was increased from 0 to 1000 mg kg - 1, with a maximum As accumulation of 8. 3 mg pot - 1 in the presence of 1000 mg kg - 1 Zn.

Twenty-four microcosms were used and treatments were performed with substances alone or with herbicide–adjuvant binary mixtures, at two concentrations levels (44. 4 and 222. 2 μg/L for the herbicides, and 100 and 500 μg/L for Agral 90). Toxicity was assessed weekly for 1 month through growth measurements, as inferred from the relative frond number (RFN) and relative <b>frond</b> <b>area</b> (RFA). Concentrations of diquat and fomesafen in water and sediments were measured weekly. The herbicides showed very different behaviour in microcosms, with a rapid disappearance of diquat from the aqueous phase whereas fomesafen levels remained almost constant over time. Diquat strongly inhibited the growth of L. minor whereas fomesafen {{had no effect on}} plant growth. Presence of the adjuvant only slightly reduced the effect of the lowest concentration of diquat, probably as a result of dispersion of the herbicide at the water surface.

It was noted that in order to develop the design, an early data and information of physical and mechanical properties of palm oil frond and stem fruits is critically important. The objective of the research was to obtain the physical and mechanical properties of palm oil frond and stem in order to develop the design of pruner and harvester machinery. The result showed that tool machinery was been advantageous by the physical properties of the plant i. e. the <b>total</b> weight of <b>frond</b> and leaf which enable to support the cutting process. The average of <b>total</b> weight of <b>frond</b> and leaf was 16. 8 kg. The diagonal cutting trajectory was been more advantageous because of <b>total</b> weight and <b>frond</b> shape toward to the different of the plant tissue area. The measurement result shows that cutting curve follows the time required for cutting. The comparison among cutting curve shows differences in cutting thickness or length. In this case, the thickness is linear with cutting time. Besides, those curves show differences at the height which determine the maximum value of tested material cutting resistance. Alternative solution for machinery development design is pruner-harvester for height plant below 6 m and among 6 to 12 m. For below 6 m, pruner-harvester was designed by incorporating motor as power source and cutter-disc as the knife cutter. That condition was relied on that estate which was maintenance intensively commonly used cutter-disc. Pruner-harvester above 6 m and up to 12 m was improved based on manual egrek-designed by adding fresh fruit bunch alley supply glide in order to keep the fruits still in intact form. The consideration was based on affectivity and efficiency. It also considers homogenous ecological of palm oil plant which should be maintained to reduce global warming effect.

40|$|Mountain {{pastures}} {{dominated by}} the pasture grass Setaria sphacelata in the Andes of southern Ecuador are heavily infested by southern bracken (Pteridium arachnoideum), {{a major problem for}} pasture management. Field observations suggest that bracken might outcompete the grass due to its competitive strength with regard to the absorption of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). To understand the PAR absorption potential of both species, the aims of the current paper are to (1) parameterize a radiation scheme of a two-big-leaf model by deriving structural (LAI, leaf angle parameter) and optical (leaf albedo, transmittance) plant traits for average individuals from field surveys, (2) to initialize the properly parameterized radiation scheme with realistic global irradiation conditions of the Rio San Francisco Valley in the Andes of southern Ecuador, and (3) to compare the PAR absorption capabilities of both species under typical local weather conditions. Field data show that bracken reveals a slightly higher average leaf area index (LAI) and more horizontally oriented leaves in comparison to Setaria. Spectrometer measurements reveal that bracken and Setaria are characterized by a similar average leaf absorptance. Simulations with the average diurnal course of incoming solar radiation (1998 – 2005) and the mean leaf–sun geometry reveal that PAR absorption is fairly equal for both species. However, the comparison of typical clear and overcast days show that two parameters, (1) the relation of incoming diffuse and direct irradiance, and (2) the leaf–sun geometry play a major role for PAR absorption in the two-big-leaf approach: Under cloudy sky conditions (mainly diffuse irradiance), PAR absorption is slightly higher for Setaria while under clear sky conditions (mainly direct irradiance), the average bracken individual is characterized by a higher PAR absorption potential. (∼ 74  MJ m− 2 year− 1). The latter situation which occurs if the maximum daily irradiance exceeds 615  W m− 2 is mainly due to the nearly orthogonal incidence of the direct solar beam onto the horizontally oriented <b>frond</b> <b>area</b> which implies a high amount of direct PAR absorption during the noon maximum of direct irradiance. Such situations of solar irradiance favoring a higher PAR absorptance of bracken occur in ∼ 36 % of the observation period (1998 – 2005). By considering the annual course of PAR irradiance in the San Francisco Valley, the clear advantage of bracken on clear days (36 % of all days) is completely compensated by the slight but more frequent advantage of Setaria under overcast conditions (64 % of all days). This means that neither bracken nor Setaria show a distinct advantage in PAR absorption capability under the current climatic conditions of the study area...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to examine the ecological characteristics of two brown algae, Eisenia bicyclis and Ecklonia caba, and the marine forests formed by these species. These species are widely distributed along the Pacific coast of central Japan and are important algae both ecologically and economically. Wherever the water conditions and substratum are suitable, both species form dense, expansive marine forests, 1 - 3 m in height. Ei. bicyclis usually grows in shallow water down to 8 - 10 m in the subiittoral zone. Ec. cava, on the other hand, occupies deeper water of 4 - 25 m or more. Allometric relationships between stipe length or diameter and weight of stipe, blade, and <b>total</b> <b>frond</b> were examined to obtain useful analytic characters for measuring the population structure. The regeneration of both marine forests were studied with the methods of permanent quadrat and mapping for 6 years. The regeneration process and turnover time were revealed as compared with those of terrestrial climax forests. The three phases of gap, building and mature were distinguished by reference to the structural and dynamic features of the population in the regeneration process. The turnover time was 5 - 6 years for the Ei. bicyclis population and 3 years for the Ec. cava population. The analysis of distributional patterns and production structures of Ei. bicyclis and Ec. cava populations suggested that there was significant intraspecific competition for getting light between the canopy fronds and recruits involving the same age groups. Young fronds of these species were growing under considerably low light conditions on the population floor. Critical light conditions for young Ei. bicyclis and. Ec. cava were examined on the population floor. The daily compensation light for young Ei. bicyclis and Ec. cava was calculated with mathematical models based on photosynthesis-light equations and natural light conditions. The estimated daily light compensation point did not conflict with the observed critical light under in situ light conditions. It was clear that young Ec. cava fronds can grow under lower in situ light intensity in deeper water than young Ei. bicyclis fronds. The demography was studied mainly for the Ec. cava population. The Weibull frequency distribution was used to analyze the factors regulating mortality from the survivor curve. The average life span of Ec. cava was 16. 5 months, and the maximum life span was 5 years, as indicated in life table. 褐藻類コンプ科に属するアラメおよびカジメは本邦暖海域に分布し， 1 - 3 mの高さになる大形海藻である。一般に アラメは潮間帯直下から水深 10 m付近まで，カジメは水深 4 m付近から 25 mもしくはそれ以探にまで分布する。 本研究は，群落の構造やその変動を解析することにより，アラメおよびカジメの種の特性を生態学的な見地から解明することを目的としたものである。 両種の群落構造を解析するための基準形質を得るため, 多くの個体について茎長，茎径，年齢, 乾重量等を測定し，各形質聞の相対生長関係を検討した。その結果，相関係数，測定の難易度を考慮して茎長を基準形質として採用した。 群落の更新課程を把握するため，アラメおよぴカジメ群落内に永久コドラートを設置し，個体の発生，死亡状況および茎長の伸長状況等を 6 年間にわたり連続的に測定した。カジメ群落では 3 年周期で成体群と幼体群の交代が行われるのに対し，アラメ群落では成体群が 5 － 6 年以上にわたって林冠を形成し続ける。また，分布様式の解析から，小形群の消長は，大形群の密度によって強く支配されることも明かとなった。 群落内の光環境と立体構造を明らかにするため，層別刈取り法により生産構造を求め，解析の基準資料とした。両種とも群落床部の光環境は林冠を形成する大形群の密度に強く支配され，大形個体の少ない群落では，床部の相対光強度は比鮫的高く，多数の小形個体が生育する。また，アラメ群落はカジメ群落に比べ葉重量が 3 － 4 倍多く，光は群落上層で急激に吸収され，小形群の出現や生長が著しく制御される。 光条件がアラメおよびカジメの分布や生長に及ぼす直接的な影響を明らかにするため，両種の幼体について生育場所の光環境，光合成特性，日射の日変化等を測定し，日補償点を推定するためのモデル式を作り，両種幼体の光環境からみた生育限界を解析した。推愛された日補償光強度を海面に対する相対光強度で表すと，アラメ幼体では 1. 1 ％, カジメ幼体では 0 ． 6 ％であった。これらの値は幼体の生育する群落床部の相対光分布の実測値とよく一致した。 カジメ群落について生存曲線や生命表を作成し，若齢時の死亡要因を検討した結果, 幼体の生長に伴う個体群密度の増加が原因となる種内競争が主な死亡要因と考えられ，また，アラメは奔命が 7 － 8 年と，カジメの 5 年に比べ明かに長く，長期にわたり大形個体が優占する群落せ形成し続けることが明かとなった。 以上の結果から，カジメはアラメに比べより弱光に適応しており，両種の光に対する適応の特性や寿命の相が， 両種群落の構造やその更新課程の違いに反映しているものと結論される...|$|R

The concentrations of dissolved lead, cadmium, and thallium remaining in the residual solutions, and accumulation of lead, cadmium and thallium in fronds and roots were assessed using Inductively Couple Plasma – Mass Spectroscopy (ICP-MS). Over the exposure duration, lead, cadmium, and thallium concentrations in solution decreased rapidly and chlorosis was observed in fronds exposed to the three highest lead, cadmium, and thallium concentrations. After seven days of exposure, there were significant decreases in the relative growth rate (RGR), relative <b>frond</b> <b>area</b> (RFA), pigment content (chlorophyll a, b and total carotenoid) and activity of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) at concentrations of 0. 1, 1, 10, 100, 1000 and 10 000 µmol L- 1 Pb, 10, 100, 1000 and 10 000 µmol L- 1 cd, 0. 01, 0. 1, 1, 10, 100, 1000 and 10 000 µmol L- 1 TI. However, our results suggested that root elongation based on relative growth rate of L. minor will be an optimal and relevant endpoint in compare to other endpoints. As expected, results demonstrated that root elongation was concluded that root length was most predictive of a dose response model compared to the rest of growth endpoints and physiological and biochemical endpoints when assessing {{toxicity of}} lead, cadmium and thallium using L. minor. Toxicity testing for the floating macrophytes should include root elongation measurement which alone will be sufficient to meet sensitivity and variability requirements for toxicity testing. Cellular concentrations of lead, cadmium, and thallium were higher in roots than fronds, whereas more lead, cadmium, and thallium was adsorbed to the extracellular matrix of fronds than roots. The bio - concentration factor (BCF; i. e. lead concentration in plant tissue at day seven relative to residual lead concentration in the growth medium at day seven) indicates that L. minor is a good accumulator of lead, cadmium, and thallium particularly at lower concentration, but the physiological data shows that these metals toxic at concentrations that can be encountered in wastewater treatment facilities. The translocation factor (TF) value was found to be less than 1. Though, lead, cadmium and Thallium was mostly stored in roots, only minor amounts of lead, cadmium and thallium were trans located to fronds. KURDISTAN REGIONAL GOVERNMEN...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAgricultural {{expansion}} across tropical regions {{is causing}} declines in biodiversity and altering ecological processes. However, in some tropical agricultural systems, conserving natural habitat can simultaneously protect threatened species and support important ecosystem services. Oil palm cultivation is expanding rapidly throughout the tropics but {{the extent to}} which non-crop habitat supports biodiversity and ecosystem services in these landscapes is poorly documented. We investigated whether riparian forest fragments (riparian reserves) provide a pest control service or increase pest activity (disservice) within oil palm dominated landscapes in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. We assessed the activity of potential predators of pest herbivores using plasticine caterpillar mimics and quantified herbivory rates on oil palm <b>fronds</b> in <b>areas</b> with and without riparian reserves. We also manipulated the shape and colour of the mimics to assess {{the extent to which}} artificial pest mimics reflect a predatory response. The presence of riparian reserves increased the attack rate on mimics by arthropods, but not by birds. Our methodological study suggested attacks on artificial pest mimics provide a better indication of predatory activity for birds than for arthropod predators. Herbivory rates were also not significantly affected by the presence of a riparian reserve, but we found some evidence that herbivory rates may decrease as the size of riparian reserves increases. Overall, we conclude that riparian forest fragments of 30 – 50 m width {{on each side of the}} river are unlikely to provide a pest control service. Nevertheless, our results provide evidence that these riparian buffer strips do not increase the density of defoliating pests, which should reassure managers concerned about possible negative consequences of preserving riparian buffers...|$|R
40|$|A Chinese {{medicinal}} fern Blechnum orientale (Linn) was separately {{collected from}} polluted and unpolluted sites {{to determine whether}} it could accumulate hazardous pollutants or not. Metal concentrations (Cu, Zn, Mn, Pb, Cd, Cr, As, and Hg) both in the fronds and roots and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the fronds of this fern were quantified.

Concentrations of Pb, As, Hg, Cd, and Cu in the fronds at the polluted site were more than 2, 6, 7, 14, 5, and 13 times of those at the unpolluted site. Translocation factor and bioaccumulation factor implied that B. orientale did not have a good ability to transport heavy metals from the roots to the <b>fronds.</b> <b>Total</b> PAHs in the fronds at the polluted site were significantly higher than those at the unpolluted site, indicating the physiological PAHs absorption by B. orientale growing at polluted sites.

40|$|Heavy metals are {{bioaccumulation}} and non-degradable {{elements in}} the soil. The contamination by heavy metals in soil {{is one of the}} important issues and requires attention because heavy metals above the maximum allowable concentration will threatened to both plants and living things. I was therefore of interest to conduct a study regarding the concentration of heavy metals on peat soil at FELCRA Sri Mendapat. The soil was also analyzed for its properties such as pH and moisture. Besides that, the soil samples were collected at different operational zones such as pesticide <b>area,</b> <b>frond</b> heap, weeded circle and harvesting path. Heavy metals for which these samples were analyzed were zinc,chromium were recorded as exceeded the maximum allowable concentration (MAC) set by World Health Organization (WHO) while zinc was recorded below the MAC. The pH of all soil samples were recorded in acid condition and a range within 3 - 5. Meanwhile the soil moisture for all samples was recorded in a range within 150 - 260 mBar. The moisture of the soil is considered dry above than 230 mBar. Most of the operational zones are under normal moisture except the harvesting path zone which is above than 230 mBar. The relationship between soil pH and soil moisture have significant difference toward heavy metal concentration...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects that}} {{different}} intensities of frond harvesting have on frond regeneration and subsequent production of reproductive structures were investigated {{for the red}} intertidal alga Mazzaella cornucopiae (Postels & Ruprecht) Hommersand from British Columbia, Canada. Harvesting was done by pruning fronds in the late spring (when stand biomass is highest) of 1993 at two intensities: total and partial collection of fronds, in this second case leaving all frond biomass less than 1 cm high in place. Holdfasts were not damaged. Total percent cover of thalli, frond density, mean frond length, and stand biomass for these experimental quadrats were statistically similar to values for control quadrats {{in the spring of}} 1994. These results suggest that one <b>total</b> harvest of <b>fronds</b> per year, done in late spring without damaging holdfasts, may give the highest sustainable yield of biomass. The effects of harvesting intensity on reproduction were variable and difficult to explain. Neither the appearance nor the abundance of cystocarpic fronds were affected by frond pruning, compared with control areas, but pruning did affect the appearance and the abundance of tetrasporic fronds. Partial pruning resulted in a longer presence of tetrasporic <b>fronds,</b> whereas <b>total</b> pruning was associated with their complete absence. Results are compared with those for the few other species of the Gigartinaceae for which experimental harvesting has been done...|$|R
40|$|The {{identification}} {{and understanding of}} soil factors influencing yield variability of oil palm enable their efficient management. Soil samples were therefore collected from a fertilizer response trial on oil palm to study the spatial inorganic N distribution and some selected soil chemical properties as affected by long-term N fertilizer applications. The experiment was conducted on mature oil palms grown on Kumansi family (Typic Paleudults) soil in Tawau, Sabah, Malaysia. The soil samples were taken from 2 areas; with and without N treatments for 8 years. They were analyzed for total N, NH 4 + -N, NO 3 - -N, exchangeable K, and pH. Semivariance {{analysis was used to}} characterize the spatial variance of soil NH 4 + -N and NO 3 - -N while point kriging method was used to illustrate their spatial distributions. Results showed that application of N in the palm circle increased soil NH 4 + -N above 150 mg kg - 1 at 0 to 15 cm depth. In unmanured plot, the NH 4 + -N contents were similar in the different sites within a palm <b>area</b> although the <b>frond</b> heap <b>area</b> tended to have higher NH 4 + -N probably due to the N return from the decaying cut fronds. The coefficient of variations for both soil NH 4 + -N and NO 3 - -N exceeded 30 % even within each microsite of palm circle, interrow, frond heaps, and harvesting path. Semivariance analysis showed that the maximum range of soil NH 4 + -N could be reached at 10 m and 90 m in areas with and without N respectively, indicating that the application of N fertilizer reduced its spatial variability in mature oil palm agroecosystem. The kriged soil map showed localized spots of high NH 4 + -N content, which corresponded to the palm circles where N fertilizer was applied. Gradual changes in soil fertility were observed in area without N, moving from northern to southern portion of the field. Long-term applications of N caused significant downward movement of NH 4 + -N and NO 3 - -N to the lower soil depth. They also decreased the soil pH from 4. 2 to 3. 7, and caused leaching of K to the lower depth. Fertilizer should be broadcast in the interrow in mature oil palm agroecosystem to reduce spatial N variation and other detrimental effects...|$|R
40|$|Sea grapes is a {{collective}} {{term for the}} edible varieties of the green seaweed genus Caulerpa. Here we conduct comparative analyses of the biomass productivities and biochemical properties of C. lentillifera and C. racemosa from tropical Australia. Commercial-scale production was evaluated using 1 m 2 culture units with high stocking densities (> 5 kg m- 2). Productivity of C. lentillifera in a 6 -week period yielded, on average, 2 kg week- 1, whereas C. racemosa yielded < 0. 5 kg week- 1. Morphometric comparisons of the harvestable biomass revealed that C. lentillifera had {{a higher proportion of}} fronds (edible portions) to horizontal runners (stolons) and a higher density of <b>fronds</b> per unit <b>area.</b> C. racemosa <b>fronds,</b> however, were significantly longer. The nutritional value of C. racemosa was higher than C. lentillifera for both polyunsaturated fatty acids (10. 6 vs. 5. 3 mg g- 1 DW) and pigments (9. 4 vs. 4. 2 mg g- 1 DW). The content of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and β-carotene decreased with increasing frond size in both species. Trace element contents also varied substantially between the species, including higher levels of zinc, magnesium and strontium in C. lentillifera, and higher levels of selenium in C. racemosa. Some less desirable elements were higher in C. lentillifera, including arsenic (1 vs. 0. 1 ppm) and cadmium, whereas others were higher in C. racemosa, including lead, copper and vanadium. Overall C. lentillifera has a high biomass production potential in monoculture and distinct nutritional properties that warrant a focus on its commercialisation as a new aquaculture product in tropical Australia and in Southeast Asia more broadly. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht...|$|R
50|$|The wind pruned {{maritime}} heath, on {{the higher}} {{part of the}} site is dominated by western gorse (U gallii), heather (Calluna vulgaris) and bell heather (Erica cinerea). This heath is unique because all three Ophioglossum species found in the British Isles have been recorded within this small area. The largest and easiest to find is adder’s-tongue (O. vulgatum) which is the commonest on the mainland but the rarest in Scilly {{and has not been}} seen in the Isles (on St Agnes) since 1990, or on Wingletang Down since 1938. The second which has been recorded on all the inhabited islands is small adders’s-tongue (O. azoricum), which is nationally scarce and found along the western coast of Britain and Ireland north to Orkney and Shetland; there is only one recent Cornish (unconfirmed) record from near Porthgwarra. The third is least adder’s-tongue which, in Britain, is known only from this small area of St Agnes, where it was discovered in March 1950 by John Raven who found a colony of about one hundred <b>fronds</b> covering an <b>area</b> of one square metre. Botanists have since found other colonies all within the area of the downs. The probable reason for its late discovery is because the 2 cm fronds are found in the winter and turn yellow and disintegrate by early April which is before most botanists are in the area. Since the withdrawal of grazing by cattle and, due to Myxomatosis, the fall in the population of rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), some of the colonies are in danger of being smothered by competitive vegetation such as bracken (Pteridium aquilinum), European gorse and bramble. Outside of the Isles of Scilly the nearest colony is in Guernsey where it was discovered in 1854.|$|R
