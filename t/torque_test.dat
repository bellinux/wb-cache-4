50|$|A blocked rotor test is {{conducted}} on an induction motor. It {{is also known}} as short circuit test, locked rotor test or stalled <b>torque</b> <b>test.</b> From this test, short circuit current at normal voltage, power factor on short circuit, total leakage reactance, and starting torque of the motor can be found. The test {{is conducted}} at low voltage because if the applied voltage was normal voltage then the current through the stator windings would be high enough to overheat the windings and damage them. The blocked rotor <b>torque</b> <b>test</b> is not performed on wound-rotor motors because the starting torque can be varied as desired. However, a blocked rotor current test is conducted on squirrel cage rotor motors.|$|E
50|$|Another {{method is}} a reverse <b>torque</b> <b>test,</b> {{in which the}} implant carrier is unscrewed. If it fails to unscrew under the reverse torque {{pressure}}, the implant is stable. If the implant rotates under the pressure it is deemed a failure and removed. This method comes {{at the risk of}} fracturing bone that is mid-way in the process of osseointegration. It is also unreliable in determining the osseointegration potential of a bone region, as tests have yielded that a rotating implant can go on to be successfully integrated.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Grinding {{coolants}} {{have the}} functions of cooling, lubrication, cleaning and rust prevention in grinding process. To avoid the environment pollution, we should develop environmental protection grinding coolants. So {{it is important to}} research the performance evaluation for grinding coolants. In this paper, three different test methods for grinding performance evaluation of grinding coolants are used to investigate the influence of three coolants on grinding process. The three test methods are four balls test, tapping <b>torque</b> <b>test</b> and real grinding test. The test results showed that the mechanism of four balls test is simple, and the test results have good repeatability, but there is a large divagation with real grinding test results. The tapping <b>torque</b> <b>test</b> has a good relativity with cutting process. The real grinding test is the best test method for grinding performance evaluation...|$|E

The use of a percussion hammer tool as a surgical instrument to insert acetabular cup implants was investigated in current work. Pull-out, lever-out and <b>torque</b> <b>tests</b> were carried out on cup implants inserted into test block specimens of polyurethane (PU) using specifically designed experimental setups as a means of comparing the current mallet and cup introducer (manual impaction) technique against the percussion hammer tool (powered impaction) technique. The experimental tests were based on calculating the maximum forces or moments of forces required to remove the cup implants from a test block specimen, which was representative of the acetabulum of the pelvic bone. It was found, the cup implants inserted using the powered impaction technique required a greater applied force, moment of force and torque in order to remove the cup from the cavity of the PU block specimen in the pull-out, lever-out and <b>torque</b> <b>tests</b> respectively. In terms of stability, the percussion hammer tool has the potential to improve the seating of cup implants within the cavity using a more precise and controlled technique, thus improving the over stability of the inserted cup implant...|$|R

30|$|Nowadays, {{there is}} a clear and {{demonstrable}} need to define a non-invasive, fast, and easy-to-use diagnostic technique to clinically evaluate the stability of a dental implant and its osseointegration, before the restoration phase. It is recommended to extend this study to other clinical cases, in order to establish application magnitudes of the reverse <b>torque</b> <b>test,</b> according to bone quality and quantity.|$|E
30|$|The reverse <b>torque</b> <b>test</b> {{proposed}} by Roberts et al. in 1984, and developed by Johansson and Albrektsson in 1987 [6], is {{considered as a}} special advantage in stage 2 surgery, because it represents a definitive clinical verification of initial integration of the dental implant with the bone surface.

40|$|International {{industry}} {{standards set}} out requirements to mount ski bindings, test equipment functionality, provide guidelines {{on how to}} maintain the ski-binding-boot interface, and calculate correct release values. The standards call {{for the use of}} a <b>torque</b> <b>testing</b> device to assess functionality of the ski-binding with release values based on parameters of age, weight, height, boot-sole length, and skier type. To determine whether these standards were being applied in New Zealand a cross-sectional study was completed with a national survey of ski technicians and structured interviews with senior ski industry personnel. In setting up ski bindings, only 10 % of ski technicians used a torque-testing device, and substantial proportions did not take into account appropriate skier characteristics or check the boot–binding interface. Interviews of senior personnel indicated that there was good intent about quality of rental service; however, there were inconsistencies between operating procedures and international standards. The interviews also highlighted a need for better standardized questioning techniques for ski technicians to accurately determine skier type, and increased education for both ski technicians and skiers on correct setup to prevent injury related to non-release or inadvertent release. In conclusion, Ski-Binding-Boot (SBB) system inspection, routine <b>torque</b> <b>testing</b> to ensure safe functional ski-bindings, and consistent application of the international standards for correct setup of ski-binding-boot systems continues to be elusive in New Zealand. Assessment of the implementation of the international standards in other countries is also needed...|$|R

40|$|This in vivo study {{evaluated}} the fixation of {{two types of}} titanium implants {{with the use of}} an injectable calcium-phosphate (CaP) cement. The cement was either used to create a cement mantle (Type A implant) or as an additive to press-fit placed titanium plasma sprayed implants (Type B implant). The implants were placed in trabecular bone of the medial femoral condyle of goats and left in place for 2 and 10 weeks. Mechanical evaluation of the implant fixation was done by <b>torque</b> <b>testing.</b> This showed that for the Type A implants the calcium-phosphate cement's performance was significantly inferior (P < 0. 05) to that of polymethylmethacrylate cement fixation. For the two-week Type B implants a significant increase (P < 0. 05) in failure load was found for calcium-phosphate cemented implants compared with just press-fitted Type B implants. Histological evaluation revealed that for Type A implants, failure during <b>torque</b> <b>testing</b> occurred at the implant-cement interface. In contrast, for Type B implants, failure occurred in the bone-implant interface for press-fit-placed devices and in the cement layer for CaP-cemented devices. Further, the CaP cement was found to be overgrown with new formed bone already after 2 weeks of implantation. The cement showed resorption due to regular bone remodeling. On the basis of these observations, it was concluded that the use of injectable CaP cement might facilitate earlier loading of press-fit inserted titanium implants. Nevertheless, the results have to be confirmed in dynamical mechanical as well as loaded in vivo studies...|$|R

40|$|Tests of a 167 Kilowatt (224 Horsepower) {{split torque}} face gearbox were {{performed}} by the Boeing Company in Mesa, Arizona, while working under a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Technology Reinvestment Program (TRP). This paper provides a summary of these cooperative tests, which were jointly funded by Boeing and DARPA. Design, manufacture and testing of the scaled-power TRP proof-of-concept (POC) split torque gearbox followed preliminary evaluations of the concept performed early in the program. The split <b>torque</b> <b>tests</b> were run using 200 N-m (1767 in-lbs) torque input to {{each side of the}} transmission. During tests, two input pinions were slow rolled while in mesh with the two face gears. Two idler gears were also used in the configuration to recombine torque near the output. Resistance was applied at the output face gear to create the required loading conditions in the gear teeth. A system of weights, pulleys and cables were used in the test rig to provide both the input and output loading. Strain gages applied in the tooth root fillets provided strain indication used to determine torque splitting conditions at the input pinions. The final two pinion-two idler tests indicated 52 % to 48 % average torque split capabilities for the two pinions. During the same tests, a 57 % to 43 % average distribution of the torque being recombined to the upper face gear from the lower face gear was measured between the two idlers. The POC split <b>torque</b> <b>tests</b> demonstrated that face gears can be applied effectively in split torque rotorcraft transmissions, yielding good potential for significant weight, cost and reliability improvements over existing equipment using spiral bevel gearing...|$|R
