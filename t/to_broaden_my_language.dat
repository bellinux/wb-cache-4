40|$|About {{this work}} Applied {{mathematics}}, i. e. mathematics combined with computer sciences {{form the basis}} of this work. In order <b>to</b> <b>broaden</b> <b>my</b> studies I spent 2 semesters in Argentina at the Universidad de Buenos Aires. There, a team received me to work in the field of neural networks and machine learning. I began to specialize in reinforcement learning, a well-suited method for robot learning. Motivated by many enhanced experiments I encountered the difference between computer science and mathematics, the gap between theory and practice. Especially in the area of artificial intelligence practice goes much further than theory: many sciences such as medicine, psychology, biology and the cognitive sciences are investigating artificial inteligence, often ignoring and overlooking the underlying mathematical theory, which is difficult to understand. The discrepancy between well-performing practical experiments and mathematical models that do not completely describe the experiments is mirrored in this work. It was an extraordinary experience to have contributed in devising a theory starting with a series of experiments and to use this theory to improve the performance of the practice itself. To see the theory working- in my case the robot achieving to learn complex behavior – is among the most beautiful things I have experienced throughout my scientific career...|$|R

By my election to expand from Wood design to include Industrial design, I am not limited to a single facet of this field. Whereas wood design and Industrial design are both applied designs and deal with problem solving, their problems are of different natures. Wood design deals primarily with the material, and its application to (at most) limited production, while Industrial design encompasses a wide variety of materials, and employs techniques used to produce pieces on a large scale. Both areas do share the use of the artistic elements and disciplines of line, form, composition, proportion value, color etc ??? to arrive at their solution. They are used within predetermined limitations to achieve a certain desired result that is decided on at the outset.

Whether designing a one-of-a-kind piece or a product to be produced by the millions, the game stays the same, only the rules change.
