40|$|The melting {{behavior}} of bisphenol-A polycarbonate samples plasticized by <b>tritolyl</b> <b>phosphate</b> (TTP), pentaerythritol tetranonanoate (PETN), and trimellitic acid-tridecyloctyl ester (TMDO) {{has been investigated}} and discussed {{on the basis of}} current theories. Using the Hoffman and Weeks approach modified for finite chain length the variation of the equilibrium melting temperature has been determined {{as a function of the}} plasticizer concentration. Extrapolation of these data yields an equilibrium melting temperature of 317 degrees C for the pure polycarbonate of infinite molecular weight. The cryoscopic effect observed is much more pronounced than anticipated on the basis of the Flory-Huggins theory. Anglai...|$|E
40|$|For pt. II see ibid., vol. 14, p. 1367 (1976). Measurements of the {{spherulitic}} {{growth rates}} of bisphenol-/b A/ polycarbonate plasticized with pentaerythritol tetranonanoate (PETN), trimetallic acid tri(/b n/-octyl-/b n/-decyl) ester (TMDO), and <b>tritolyl</b> <b>phosphate</b> (TTP) are reported. The incorporation of a plasticizer enlarges the crystallization range, decreases the temperature of maximum growth rate and accelerates the kinetics to a considerable extent. The growth-rate parameters are calculated from a least-squares analysis of the experimental data according to the kinetic theory of Hoffman and Lauritzen (1973). From the growth-rate data given here and the overall crystallization kinetics reported previously, concentrations of seeds inducing the crystallization were determined. Anglai...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tritolyl</b> <b>phosphate</b> [...] a {{suitable}} immersion oil for fluid inclusion freezing-stage studies INFORMATION on the bulk composition and salinity of fluid inclusions in minerals {{can be obtained}} from the direct observation of various phase changes in frozen or cooled inclusions using a microscope freezing-stage (for example, see Roedder, I 963; Hollister and Burruss, i 976). Transient phases that develop on cooling such as ice, solid CO 2, CO 2 -hydrate, and NaCl-hydrate are, however, often very difficult o observe because of the small size of most fluid inclusions (generally less than IOO #m). To facilitate these observations and to enhance the definition of small inclusions in transparent minerals it is normal practice t...|$|E
40|$|Eight arctic species, {{including}} fish, {{birds and}} mammals, from diverse habitats (marine and terrestrial) within the Svalbard Archipelago, Norway, were screened for 14 organophosphorus flame retardant (PFR) compounds. Ten PFRs were detected: tris(2 -chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), tris(2 -chloroisopropyl) phosphate (TCIPP), tris(1, 3 -dichloro- 2 -propyl) phosphate (TDCIPP), triphenyl phosphate (TPHP); 2 -ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate (EHDPP); tris(2 -butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP); <b>tritolyl</b> <b>phosphate</b> (TCrP); triisobutyl phosphate (TIBP); tris(2 -ethylhexyl) phosphate (TEHP); and butyl diphenyl phosphate (DPhBP). The {{greatest number of}} different PFR compounds, and the highest detection frequency were measured in capelin (Mallotus villotus), and the lowest in Brünnich's guillemot (Uria lomvia). The highest concentrations of σPFR, {{as well as the}} highest concentration of a single PFR compound, TBOEP, were measured in arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus). The presence of PFR compounds in arctic biota indicates that these compounds can undergo long-range transport and are, to some degree, persistent and bioaccumulated. The potential for biomagnification from fish to higher trophic levels seems to be limited...|$|E
40|$|Triaryl {{phosphates}} were synthesized {{from white}} phosphorus and phenols in aerobic conditions {{and in the}} presence of iron catalysts and iodine. Full conversion to phosphates was achieved without the use of chlorine or chlorinated solvents, and the reactions do not produce acid waste. Triphenyl phosphate, <b>tritolyl</b> <b>phosphate</b> and tris(2, 4 -di-tert-butyl) phenyl phosphate were synthesized by this method with 100 % conversion from P₄. Various iron(III) diketonates were used to catalyse the conversion. Mechanistic studies showed the reaction to proceed via the formation of phosphorus triiodide (PI₃), then diphenyl phosphoroiodidate (O=PI(OPh) ₂) before the final formation of triphenyl phosphate (O=P(OPh) ₃). The nucleophilic substitution of O=PI(OPh) ₂ with phenol to form O=P(OPh) ₃ was found to be the rate determining step. It was found that by modifying the reaction conditions the same catalytic systems could be used to synthesize triphenyl phosphite directly from P₄. Triphenyl phosphite was synthesized in selectivities of up to 60 %. The mechanism of these transformations was also elucidated. Independent syntheses of the intermediate in the reaction mechanism, O=P(OPh) ₂I and its hydrolysis products diphenyl phosphate (O=P(OPh) ₂OH) and tetraphenyl pyrophosphate ((O) P(OPh) ₂-O-P(O) (OPh) ₂) were developed from PI₃. The 2, 4 -di-tert-butyl phenol analogues of these compounds were also prepared. Bis-(2, 4 -di-tert-butylphenyl) phosphoroiodidate was then reacted with various alcohols to produce a series of mixed triorgano phosphates.
