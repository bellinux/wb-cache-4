5|$|The Japanese {{offensive}} plans {{specified that}} <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>units</b> {{would make a}} series of coordinated, but separate, attacks on the American perimeter. The Iwasa Unit would begin the offensive by advancing southeast and capturing Hill 700 on 8March. It would then rest for two days before advancing against the Piva airfields. The Muda Unit was to launch its attack on 10March by advancing west and capturing Hills 260 and 309. On 12March it and a battalion from the Iwasa Unit would capture Hill 608. The Magata Unit would begin its attack on 11March and move south through low-lying terrain to assault the 129thInfantry Regiment. After defeating this unit, the Magata Unit would join the Iwasa Unit's advance on the airfields. Once these airfields were secured, <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>units</b> would advance to Cape Torokina, and capture it by 17March. Due to their inadequate supply of rations, the Japanese needed to achieve a rapid victory.|$|E

5|$|The {{pictures}} {{are not in}} strictly chronological order. If they are perceived as three groups, then the pictures in each of <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>units</b> inform upon each other, {{in the same way}} as was usual in Medieval paintings and stained glass. The three sections of Creation, Downfall, and Fate of Humanity appear in reverse order, when read from the entrance of the chapel. However, each individual scene is painted to be viewed when looking toward the altar. This is not easily apparent when viewing a reproduced image of the ceiling but becomes clear when the viewer looks upward at the vault. Paoletti and Radke suggest that this reversed progression symbolises a return to a state of grace. However, the three sections are generally described in the order of Biblical chronology.|$|E

When George Washington's army retreated though Elizabethtown in late 1776, the militiamen briefly joined it. From New Brunswick Washington sent the three militia regiments from Essex, Morris, and Sussex Counties to operate against the British flank from the mountains of northern New Jersey. When the militiamen reached Morristown, New Jersey, the commander of <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>units</b> resigned, as did Thomas.|$|E
25|$|Teacher {{dissatisfaction with}} {{representation}} {{by the three}} Trinidad unions had grown in the 1970s. There was the view that adversarial relations between <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>units</b> had severely hampered Industrial Relations in the Teaching Service. As early as 1966 there was a struggle {{between two of the}} three unions to be the sole representative for any class of, or classes of teachers. The Special Tribunal No. 10 of 1974, which stated that any one of the three unions could represent any class or classes of teachers decided this issue. This resulted in rapid changes of membership among teachers. However, not one of these unions emerged as the majority union.|$|E

In September 1940 both units began cutting timber in Northumberland. The Australians experienced difficulty working in the cold climate, with many falling sick over the winter of 1940/41. They also needed to adapt their methods to those used in the UK. The 3rd Forestry Company arrived the UK during early 1941. In July that year the Australian Forestry Group UK was established to command <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>units.</b> It was led by Lieutenant-Colonel C.R. Cole throughout its existence.

Designers worked on three prototypes concurrently while regarding {{each of them}} as the final product. Doing so required a constant duplication of effort, as they had to repeat the same process for all three prototypes. The prototypes, of which taking photos was forbidden, were locked in a separate laboratory, accessible only by core designers. They were transported by trusted company employees, instead of third-party couriers.
