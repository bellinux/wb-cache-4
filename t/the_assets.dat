50|$|Depreciation: The {{depreciable}} amount (cost less residual value) should be allocated on a systematic basis over <b>the</b> <b>asset's</b> useful life.

40|$|We {{develop a}} model where the {{coexistence}} {{of money and}} a higher yielding asset is endogenously obtained when no restriction {{is placed on the}} use of either object as a medium of exchange. Due to the presence of uninsurable risks, agents have, in equilibrium, di⁄erent relative valuations of <b>the</b> <b>asset</b> to money, and hence, the use of money as a means of payment is strictly preferred. This endogenous di⁄erence in the willingness of agents to use money over <b>the</b> <b>asset</b> implies that money carries a greater liquidity premium than <b>the</b> <b>asset.</b> We obtain that <b>the</b> <b>asset</b> strictly dominates money in terms of the expected rate of return, except at the Friedman rule. Since buyers are risk neutral with respect to the dividend payment of <b>the</b> <b>asset,</b> they hold both <b>the</b> <b>asset</b> and money despite the rate of return dominance of asset to money. We obtain that for low levels of ination the price of <b>the</b> <b>asset,</b> and therefore its real rate of return, is not a⁄ected by the rate of ination. This is because <b>the</b> <b>asset</b> is not used as a means of payment, only money is, and the price of <b>the</b> <b>asset</b> is given by its fundamental value. But when the ination rate becomes large enough, real balances are so low that buyers will then start using <b>the</b> <b>asset</b> as a means of payment in addition to money, and here, <b>the</b> <b>asset</b> will carry a liquidity premium as well, although it is smaller than that of money. The price of <b>the</b> <b>asset</b> is then increasing in the ination rate, and its real rate of return is therefore negatively correlated with the ination rate...|$|R
