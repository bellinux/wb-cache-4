5|$|At 9a.m. on 11 November, Whitlam, {{together}} with {{deputy prime minister}} Frank Crean and Leader of the House Fred Daly, met with the Liberal and Country party leaders. No compromise could be reached. Whitlam informed the Coalition leaders {{that he would be}} advising Kerr <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>a</b> half-Senate election on 13December, and he would not be seeking interim supply for the period before the election. Thinking it unlikely that Kerr would grant the election without supply, Fraser warned Whitlam that the Governor-General might make up his own mind about the matter. Whitlam was dismissive and after the meeting broke, telephoned Kerr to tell him that he needed an appointment to advise him <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>a</b> half-Senate election. Both men were busy in the morning, Kerr with Remembrance Day commemorations, and Whitlam with a caucus meeting and a censure motion in the House which the Opposition had submitted. The two discussed a meeting for 1:00p.m., though Kerr's office later called Whitlam's and confirmed the time as 12:45. Word of this change did not reach the Prime Minister. Whitlam announced the request for a half-Senate election to his caucus, which approved it.|$|E
5|$|At the 1910 election, Labour gained sixteen {{additional}} seats <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>a</b> {{total of}} forty-two of the seventy-five House of Representatives' seats, and all eighteen Senate seats up for election <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>a</b> total of twenty-two out of thirty-six seats.

The 113 acts passed {{in the three years}} of the second Fisher government exceeded even the output of the second Deakin government over a similar period. The 1910–13 Fisher government represented the culmination of Labour's involvement in politics, and was a period of reform unmatched in the Commonwealth until the 1940s, under John Curtin and Ben Chifley.|$|E
