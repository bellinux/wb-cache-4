5|$|After Leonard I. Schiff {{calculated}} that an initiator could theoretically improve {{the efficiency of}} a gun-type fission weapon, Oppenheimer gave approval on 15 March 1945 for initiators {{to be included in}} the Little Boy design. Testing was carried out to ensure that the initiators were rugged enough to handle being transported in an airplane and being accidentally dropped. Eventually, about forty initiators were despatched to Tinian, where four were inserted into the bomb <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> the bombing of Hiroshima.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton's {{resignation}} as Secretary of the Treasury in 1795 did {{not remove}} him from public life. With the resumption of his law practice, he remained close to Washington as an advisor and friend. Hamilton influenced Washington {{in the composition of}} his Farewell Address by writing drafts for Washington to compare with the latter's draft, although when Washington contemplated retirement in 1792, he had consulted James Madison for a draft <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> a similar manner to Hamilton's.|$|E

There is only a minor software modification {{for one of them}} that has a scientific subsystem that the other lacks.|$|E

Many sculptors and stone-cutters of the period lived at the foot of Mount Etna, making a diversity of objects, including balustrades, pillars, fountains and seats for buildings. Shades of black or grey were used to create contrasting decorative effects, accentuating the Baroque love of light and shade as demonstrated in (illustration 2).|$|E

5|$|During the game's development, Harmonix {{only used}} low-fidelity {{versions}} of the remasters, which were sufficient for programming and note charting; Apple Corps feared that the leak of any high-fidelity remastered track from Abbey Road studios {{would lead to the}} unauthorized use of samples of the Beatles' music in remixes. High-fidelity {{versions of the}} songs were not implemented until the final publishing of the game. Harmonix performed very little additional remixing upon receipt of these remasters; in some cases, three different guitar parts—lead, solo, and rhythm—were brought into a single cohesive guitar part, slightly raising the volume of the specific guitar track <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> note tracking {{to make it easier for}} the player to follow in the game. The ability for up to three players to sing vocal harmonies, a feature not present in previous Rock Band games, was designed and implemented as an optional feature so as not to be overwhelming to players.|$|E
5|$|Other {{proposals}} from Kelly and Giffords include {{limiting the}} sale of certain magazines, limiting {{the sale of}} assault weapons, and stopping gun trafficking. Mark Kelly was denied the sale of an AR-15 rifle. The shop owner denied Mr. Kelly the purchase stating his disagreement with Mr. Kelly's previous statements on gun laws. Local news reports that Mr. Kelly tried to buy the firearm using his Texas drivers license and thus could not prove Arizona residency. Mr. Kelly had stated that he was purchasing in order to turn the weapon in to the police department. In April 2013, Kelly was photographed at his mother-in-law's house in Arizona, with Giffords watching and cheering him on while he used a Glock 9 millimeter for target practice. The gun belongs to Giffords--she owned it prior to the 2011 attempt on her life. It is {{the same type of}} gun <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> the January 2011 shooting.|$|E
5|$|Padayappa {{launched}} {{production at}} the Ragavendra Kalyana Mandapam on 1 October 1998. The film's climax scene {{was one of the}} first to be shot, and was filmed in one take using two cameras. Around 2,000 extras were used for the scene. The car <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> the scene which introduced Neelambari in the film belonged to Ravikumar. Ravikumar used the newly purchased car in the film at Rajinikanth's insistence. Filming also took place in Mysore. The Vadapalani-based shop, D. V. Nehru wigs, supplied the wigs that were sported by Ganesan in the film. In an August 2016 interview with Sudhir Srinivasan of The Hindu, Ravikumar mentioned that a scene where Padayappa uses his dupatta to pull down a swing from the ceiling on which he sits after not being given a chair to sit by Neelambari, was inspired by a sequence in the Indian epic Ramayana. The sequence features the Hindu god Hanuman making a seat using his tail after Ravana, the demon king of Lanka, does not provide the former a chair to sit.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} for {{the film}} began on November 7, 2007 and culminated on March 27, 2008; however second unit filming occurred in Bakersfield, California in April 2008, which stood in for Kirk's childhood home in Iowa. Filming was also done at the City Hall of Long Beach, California; the San Rafael Swell in Utah; and the California State University, Northridge in Los Angeles (which was used for establishing shots of students at Starfleet Academy). A parking lot outside Dodger Stadium {{was used for the}} ice planet of Delta Vega and the Romulan drilling rig on Vulcan. The filmmakers expressed an interest in Iceland for scenes on Delta Vega, but decided against it: Chambliss enjoyed the challenge of filming scenes with snow in southern California. Other Vulcan exteriors were shot at Vasquez Rocks, a location <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> various episodes of the original series. A Budweiser plant in Van Nuys was used for Enterprises engine room, while a Long Beach power plant was used for Kelvins engine room.|$|E
5|$|The Asiatic dayflower plant {{serves as}} the type species for its large genus. Linnaeus picked the name Commelina in honour of the two Dutch botanists of the Commelijn family, using the two large showy petals of Commelina communis to symbolise them. Linnaeus {{described}} the species in {{the first edition of}} his landmark work, Species Plantarum, in 1753. Long before the plant was studied in Europe, however, it had been used for generations in traditional Chinese medicine. The flowers have also been used in Japan to produce a dye and a pigment <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> many world-renowned Ukiyo-e woodcuts from the 18th and early 19th centuries. In the modern era the plant has found limited use as a model organism in the field of plant physiology due to its complex pigment chemistry and the ease of viewing its stomata.|$|E

Since 2009, the current ball has been displayed atop the building year-round, while the original, smaller version of the current ball <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> 2008 is on display at Times Square's visitor center.|$|E
