5|$|In {{addition}} to <b>their</b> <b>function</b> in respiration, the lungs {{also have a}} number of other functions. They are involved in maintaining homeostasis, helping in the regulation of blood pressure as part of the renin-angiotensin system. The inner lining of the blood vessels secretes angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) an enzyme that catalyses the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. The lungs are involved in the blood's acid-base homeostasis by expelling carbon dioxide when breathing.|$|E

They have been found to often associate with discrete domains defined by dense localization of the transcription factor PTF, which promotes transcription of small nuclear RNA (snRNA).|$|E

5|$|A 2011 {{study of}} the nasal {{passages}} of Euoplocephalus supported <b>their</b> <b>function</b> as a heat and water balancing system, noting the extensive blood vessel system and an increased surface area for the mucosa membrane (used for heat and water exchange in modern animals). The researchers also supported the loops acting as a resonance chamber, comparable to the enlongated nasal passages of saiga antelope and looping trachea of cranes and swans. Reconstructions of the inner ear suggest adaptation to hearing at low frequencies, such as the low-toned resonant sounds possibly produced by the nasal passages. They disputed {{the possibility that the}} looping is related to olfaction (sense of smell) as the olfactionary region is pushed to the sides of the main airway.|$|E
5|$|Apart from <b>their</b> <b>function</b> in locomotion, {{the tube}} feet act as {{accessory}} gills. The water vascular system serves to transport oxygen from, {{and carbon dioxide}} to, the tube feet and also nutrients from the gut to the muscles involved in locomotion. Fluid movement is bidirectional and initiated by cilia. Gas exchange also takes place through other gills known as papulae, which are thin-walled bulges on the aboral surface of the disc and arms. Oxygen is transferred from these to the coelomic fluid, which acts as the transport medium for gasses. Oxygen dissolved in the water is distributed through the body mainly by the fluid in the main body cavity; the circulatory system may also play a minor role.|$|E

5|$|Certain non-inhibitory serpins {{also use}} the serpin {{conformational}} change as part of <b>their</b> <b>function.</b> For example, the native (S) form of thyroxine-binding globulin has high affinity for thyroxine, whereas the cleaved (R) form has low affinity. Similarly, transcortin has higher affinity for cortisol when in its native (S) state, than its cleaved (R) state. Thus, in these serpins, RCL cleavage and the S to R transition has been commandeered to allow for ligand release, rather than protease inhibition.|$|E
5|$|General Motors {{explained}} the modifications {{will enhance the}} vehicle structure that surround the battery and the battery coolant system to improve battery protection after a severe crash. The safety enhancements consist of strengthening an existing portion of the Volt’s vehicle safety structure to further protect the battery pack in a severe side collision; add a sensor in the reservoir of the battery coolant system to monitor coolant levels; and add a tamper-resistant bracket {{to the top of}} the battery coolant reservoir to help prevent potential coolant overfill. The additional side safety structural pieces have a total weight of , and <b>their</b> <b>function</b> is to spread the load of a severe side impact away from the battery pack, reducing the possibility of intrusion into the pack.|$|E
5|$|In Nicotiana attenuata HypSys {{is known}} to not be {{involved}} in defence against insect herbivores. Silencing and over-expression of HypSys {{does not affect the}} feeding performance of larvae compared to normal plants. Berger silenced HypSys and found that it caused changes in flower morphology which reduced the efficiency of self-pollination. The flowers had pistils that protruded beyond their anthers, a similar phenotype to CORONATINE-INSENSITIVE1-silenced plants which lack a jasmonate receptor. Measurement of jasmonate levels in the flowers revealed that they were lower than in normal plants. The authors suggested that HypSys peptides in N. attenuata have diversified from <b>their</b> <b>function</b> as defence related peptides to being involved in controlling flower morphology. The signalling processes remain similar however, being mediated through jasmonates.|$|E

5|$|In {{the earlier}} stages of its development, the wing-bud is not {{provided}} with special organs of respiration such as tracheation, as it resembles {{in this respect}} the other portions of the hypodermis {{of which it is}} still a part. It should be noted, however, that the histoblast is developed near a large trachea, a cross-section of which is shown in, which represents sections of these parts of the first, second, third and fourth instars respectively. At the same time the tracheoles uncoil, and extend in bundles in the forming vein-cavities of the wing-bud. At the molt that marks the beginning of the pupal stadium stage, they become functional. At the same time, the larval tracheoles degenerate; <b>their</b> <b>function</b> having been replaced by the wing tracheae.|$|E
5|$|Large thin flat mineralized plates {{have been}} found next to the ribs' sides. <b>Their</b> <b>function</b> is unknown; they {{may have played a}} role in respiration. However, muscle scars or other {{indications}} of attachment have not been found for the plates, which argues against a respiratory function. Recent histological study of layered plates from a probable subadult indicates that they may have started as cartilage and became bone as the animal aged. Such plates are known from several other ornithopods and their cerapodan relatives.|$|E
5|$|Nucleic acid {{design has}} similar goals to protein design. In both, the {{sequence}} of monomers is designed to favor the desired target structure and to disfavor other structures. Nucleic acid design {{has the advantage of}} being much computationally easier than protein design, because the simple base pairing rules are sufficient to predict a structure's energetic favorability, and detailed information about the overall three-dimensional folding of the structure is not required. This allows the use of simple heuristic methods that yield experimentally robust designs. Nucleic acid structures are less versatile than proteins in <b>their</b> <b>function</b> because of proteins' increased ability to fold into complex structures, and the limited chemical diversity of the four nucleotides as compared to the twenty proteinogenic amino acids.|$|E
