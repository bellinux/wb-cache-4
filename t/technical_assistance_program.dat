5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, a {{dredging}} project was proposed on Leggetts Creek {{to repair the}} damage caused by acid mine drainage and coal mining. In 1991, the Lackawanna River Corridor Association gathered data on the water chemistry and biological habitats of Leggetts Creek. In 2012, the South Abington Sewer Authority began upgrading its sewage treatment plant to prevent wastewater and nutrient pollution from entering the creek. They also installed new sewer lines, including some that run parallel to or under the creek. PA Trout Unlimited's AMD <b>Technical</b> <b>Assistance</b> <b>Program</b> conducted a survey of the fish population in the creek on November 15, 2013. The Lackawanna Valley Conservancy once received a $190,000 Growing Greener grant for the Leggetts Creek Greenway.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} aspect of the <b>Technical</b> <b>Assistance</b> <b>Program</b> was its low cost. While $19.4 billion was allocated for capital costs in the Marshall Plan, the <b>Technical</b> <b>Assistance</b> <b>Program</b> only required $300 million. Only one-third of that $300 million cost was paid by the United States.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} the <b>Technical</b> <b>Assistance</b> <b>Program</b> were not limited to {{improvements}} in productive efficiency. While the thousands of European leaders took their work/study trips to the United States, {{they were able to}} observe a number of aspects of American society as well. The Europeans could watch local, state, and federal governments work together with citizens in a pluralist society. They observed a democratic society with open universities and civic societies in addition to more advanced factories and manufacturing plants. The <b>Technical</b> <b>Assistance</b> <b>Program</b> allowed Europeans to bring home many types of American ideas.|$|E

2500|$|The US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) contributed {{heavily to}} the success of the <b>Technical</b> <b>Assistance</b> <b>Program.</b> The United States Congress passed a law on June 7, 1940 that allowed the BLS to [...] "make {{continuing}} studies of labor productivity" [...] and appropriated funds for the creation of a Productivity and Technological Development Division. The BLS could then use its expertise in the field of productive efficiency to implement a productivity drive in each Western European country receiving Marshall Plan aid.|$|E

Until the 1965 elections [...] he was a Federal Council.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} perform this analysis, the BLS {{performed}} {{two types of}} productivity calculations. First, they used existing data to calculate how much a worker produces per hour of work—the average output rate. Second, they compared the existing output rates in a particular country to output rates in other nations. By performing these calculations across all industries, the BLS was {{able to identify the}} strengths and weaknesses of each country's manufacturing and industrial production. From that, the BLS could recommend technologies (especially statistical) that each individual nation could implement. Often, these technologies came from the United States; by the time the <b>Technical</b> <b>Assistance</b> <b>Program</b> began, the United States used statistical technologies [...] "more than a generation ahead of what [...] were using".|$|E

2500|$|The BLS {{used these}} {{statistical}} technologies to create Factory Performance Reports for Western European nations. The American government sent hundreds of technical advisors to Europe {{in order to}} observe workers in the field; this on-site analysis made the Factory Performance Reports especially helpful to the manufacturers. In addition, the <b>Technical</b> <b>Assistance</b> <b>Program</b> funded 24,000 European engineers, leaders, and industrialists to visit America and tour America's factories, mines, and manufacturing plants. This way, the European visitors {{would be able to}} return to their home countries and implement the technologies used in the United States.
