40|$|This paper enquires how {{the quality}} of primary play, {{as a way of}} communication, is defined and how it can {{contribute}} to the mutual understanding within the educational system of schools, particularly for pupils with special needs. One of the main issues is to describe {{the quality of}} primary play. Furthermore it aims to investigate its possible typologies and hence devise valid suppositions for a way of communication as a pedagogic tenor. The process is focused on the development of theories and directed the questions on detailed characterizations of case studies within the daily work environment; that is a kindergarten and a school class. The data is based on field notes compiled from direct observations of play and communication and reflections on them, using a main ethnographic method. Interviews with a kindergarten teacher, a class teacher and a school leader present during the observations and with a psychologist specialized on play therapy where used as triangulation. This was developed into a Grounded Theory, stating that primary play is characterised by the quality of being-in-contact, mutuality, equality, heartiness, an existential experience during the process of play orientated on phenomena. From these key categories a corresponding way of communication is developed, that can be applied to different pedagogic contexts including the field special educational needs. <b>This</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> can be seen as an instrument for special educational needs to enable an establishment of communicative preconditions for education. In education it positions itself within the field of relationship theory and the Theory of Attachment.

The prototypes of maps appeared as a way of transmitting information around the world. People began to use <b>this</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> long before the appearance of writing. The quality of mapping images matched with the evolution of techniques and methods of mapping and publishing. The general development of cartographic sources is determined primarily by three factors: the development of science and technology, the needs of society in different cartographic works, political and economic situation of country. Given this, map is an all-sufficient phenomenon, its sources expert study is based on understanding of invariance of its perception. Modern theoretical concepts show us the invariance of maps. Specifially, map is viewed in the following aspects: 1) {{it is one of the}} universal models of land and existing natural and social processes. 2) it is one of the tools of researching and forecasting. 3) it is a specific language formation. 4) it is a method of transferring information.

40|$|Real {{deployment}} of {{wireless sensor networks}} inside buildings is a very challenging. In fact, in such networks, {{a large number of}} small sensor devices suffer from limited energy supply. These sensors have to observe and monitor their in-door environment, and then to report the data collected to a nearest information collector, referred to as the sink node. Sensor nodes which are far away from the sink relay their data via multiple hops to reach the sink. <b>This</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> makes the sensors near the sink deplete their energy much faster than distant nodes because they carry heavier traffic. So what is known as a hole appears around the sink and prevents distant nodes to send their data. Consequently the network lifetime ends prematurely. One efficient solution for this problem is to relocate sinks. In this work, we aim to find the best way to relocate sinks by determining their optimal locations and the duration of their sojourn time. So, we propose an Integer Linear Programming for multiple mobile sinks which directly maximizes the network lifetime instead of minimizing the energy consumption or maximizing the residual energy, which is what was done in previous solutions. Simulations results show that with our solution, the network lifetime is extended and the energy depletion is more balanced among the nodes. We also show that relocating mobile sinks inside a whole network is more efficient than relocating mobile sinks inside different clusters and we can achieve almost 52 % network lifetime improvement in our experiments...|$|E

40|$|Objectives With the {{emergence}} of the Internet, customers can discuss about products and services on online platforms. <b>This</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> is called electronic word of mouth (eWOM). EWOM has offered customers many benefits such as large audience, fast transmission, custom-made conversations, visual aids, etc. Significantly, the quality of being positive or negative of eWOM, known as eWOM valence, interprets contradicting opinions and experiences, showing whether particular products or services are favourable or unfavourable. Hence, eWOM valence may influence customers’ purchase intentions. In addition, during eWOM conversations, the strength of customer-firm relationships is among the potential factors in influencing the transmission of positive eWOM and the adoption of negative eWOM. Thus, the following objectives of this thesis are declared: • To analyze the influence of positive and negative eWOM on customers’ purchase intentions. • To compare the degree of influence between positive and negative eWOM on customers’ purchase intentions. • To analyze the impact of strong customer-firm relationships on the transmission of positive eWOM information. • To analyze the impact of strong customer-firm relationships on customers’ resilience of negative eWOM information. Summary The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate the influence of eWOM valence towards customers’ purchase intentions. Further, the role of customer-firm relationships is examined on positive eWOM transmission and negative eWOM adoption. Thus, four hypotheses are proposed and tested by analyzing the collected data from 185 responses gathered from online self-administered survey. Finally, the results support all four hypotheses and provide valuable insights for marketers. Conclusions While positive eWOM information is found to motivate people to make purchases, negative eWOM information discourages customers from acquiring products and services. Between the two sides of eWOM valence, negative eWOM has higher impact on customers than does positive eWOM. Based on the strength of customer-firm relationships, if customers feel emotionally connected to firms, they are more likely to generate positive eWOM and tolerate negative eWOM towards products and services related to those firms. However, if the unfavorable information is among social, ethical, or environmental issues, strong customer-firm relationships can’t prevent customers from showing disapproval...|$|E

Until now, no equine oviduct explant culture model has been characterised both morphologically and functionally. Therefore, we established a culture system for equine oviduct explants that maintained epithelial morphology during 6 days of culture, as revealed by light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. We demonstrated the presence of highly differentiated, tall columnar, pseudostratified epithelium with basal nuclei, numerous nucleoli, secretory granules and apical cilia, which is very similar to the in vivo situation. Both epithelium and stromal cells originating from the lamina propria are represented in the explants. Moreover, at least 98 % of the cells remained membrane intact and fewer than 2 % of the cells were apoptotic after 6 days of culture. Although dark-cell degeneration, which is a hypoxia-related type of cell death, was observed in the centre of the explants, quantitative real-time PCR failed to detect upregulation of the hypoxia-related marker genes HIF 1 A, VEGFA, uPA, GLUT 1 and PAI 1.

The current paper introduces for the first time an experimental paradigm which allows studying the effect of decision making in haptic collaboration. Because reciprocal haptic feedback is challenging to provide, we analyze its efficiency in human-human collaboration to understand when it is worth to invest in this additional modality. A one degree of tracking experiment with two human partners revealed that the additional physical effort accompanying reciprocal haptic feedback is directly transformed into higher performance (compared to a control condition without reciprocal haptic feedback). Thus, the presented results motivate further research {{on the nature of the}} haptic negotiation between human partners to achieve the same performance benefits in kinesthetic collaboration with robotic partners.

Online relationships have also changed which effective strategies we use to perform maintenance on our relationships, depending on the exclusivity of the internet the relationship. In the past, postal services made communication possible without the necessity of physical presence, and the invention of the telephone allowed synchronous communication between people across long distances. The internet combined the advantages of both mail and telephone, unifying the speed of the telephone with the written character of the mail service. The evolution <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> within the Internet has arguably changed the nature of individuals' relationships with one another. Some see a major negative impact resulting in an increased use <b>of</b> internet <b>communication</b> is <b>of</b> its diversion of true community because online interaction via computers is often regarded as a more impersonal communication medium than face- to- face communication.

[...] The multiple techniques that humans use to communicate, such as taking turns or nodding in agreement, are absent in these settings. Without the body language cues present in a face-to-face conversation, such as pauses or gestures, participants in instant messaging may type over one another's messages without necessarily waiting for a cue to talk.

Social media and social networks have made it possible to express WOM online, which is referred to as electronic word of mouth (e- WOM). Social media and online social networking sites generally involve a collection of user profiles/consumers where they can share information with others. Previous scientific models on WOM behavior and the social relations behind it were not constructed for e-WOM and social media. Very little is known about the dynamics within <b>this</b> new <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> and the purpose of this thesis was to investigate how e-WOM affects the customer’s purchasing decision in the mobile phone industry. One research question was proposed:• How does e-WOM affect the customer’s purchasing decision?Based on the research question, a literature review of previous, significant studies was performed, ending in a conceptual framework to guide this study’s data collection. This thesis is primarily descriptive and has a qualitative and deductive approach. The research method chosen for this study was a case study that uses Phone House with its customers as its object of study. The data was collected through focus group interviews with customers of the company. It was found that in the purchasing decision process, the tie-strength between the person spreading the e-WOM and the person receiving it is crucial regarding the degree of influence on the receiver. Moreover, the perceived knowledge of the source spreading the e-WOM is also an important factor. The data also suggests that the age and what stage in life that the source is in correlates with what kind of information the source shares with their friend network. The data also proposes that special offers, which are presented exclusively for the company’s followers on social media, are an incitement for attracting new people to join the company network online.

When the novel opens, Lawrence is stuck in a tree. He proceeds to recount those events which he thinks led to his current predicament. As he examines his memories of the three summers he has visited Lake Chewanuk, he gradually comes to realise his own weaknesses and mistakes, but at the same time he is, almost inadvertently, sketching the lives of the people near him, namely his family and a few cohabitants at the lake. Though the narrative voice often sounds like an adolescent's, the conditions of narration [...] solitary, stuck in a tree [...] allow for some divergence from a purely spoken dialect to the level of cogitation or consciousness. <b>This</b> <b>way,</b> limitations <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> do not prevent the expression of the narrator's observations and creative ideas. The novel is made up of 39 short chapters. Because of the narrator's attention to detail, each chapter resembles a snap shot of a moment that as far as the narrator is concerned contains important information. Taken together, the chapters create a textual slideshow that the narrator seems to be submitting as evidence in a sort of self-conducted trial. As the narrative comes to an end, Lawrence is on the verge of deciding whether or not he is ready to put into practice what he has recently learned. He hesitates, however, because this would introduce him to a world he may not be ready to join...|$|R

Design: A case series of five TBI patients with craniectomy undergoing late cranioplasty (median interval time: 14 months, range: 12 - 36). Methods: Longitudinal neuropsychological and brain MRI assessments 1 week before cranioplasty and 3 months later. Results: After cranioplasty, mean score of the verbal fluency test improved compared to pre-cranioplasty (p[*]=[*] 0. 02).

40|$|Introduction Optical {{free space}} {{communication}} using visible radiation, i. e. light, {{has been known}} for a very long time. Some early examples are signaling using fire, the Heliograph using sunlight, which is directed to the receiver by means of a mirror, or the Photophone invented by Graham Bell (1880). Due to the outstanding success of radio technologies and due to their intrinsic benefits, up to now optical free space communication has remained a niche technology. One of such niche applications took advantage of the immunity from interception, namely the so-called directed transmission for military aims during World War 2 and later on. Different approaches such as optical wireless communication (OWC) using fluorescent tubes are also well recorded in the patent literature but have never achieved a breakthrough. A revival <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> wireless <b>communication</b> has come about with the advent of visible light LEDs of increasingly high optical power. While their application i nitially was limited to signaling (e. g. telltale or warning light), {{at the turn of the}} millennium it became apparent that in future lighting would be dominated by LEDs. Henceforth, there has been growing interest in applications using LED-based OWC, or which combine the functions of lighting and optical wireless data transmission. At the same time, the common term Visible Light Communications (VLC) was coined for this kind <b>of</b> <b>communication.</b> The major reasons for the steadily rising interest in VLC are the lifetime and improved optical power of white light LEDs particularly, and their progressive adoption, as well as the simplicity of LED modulation via their driving current at a modulation bandwidth in the lower MHz range, see e. g. [1 â 3]. Moreover, the proliferation of mobile applications using radio frequencies has accentuated concerns about the adequate availability of radio-frequency bands and the limits of transmission capacity in current wireless networks, as well as the related data security...|$|R
40|$|The use <b>of</b> {{computer-mediated}} <b>communication</b> (CMC) is {{hypothesized to}} create a new social identity dimension. 570 participants answered a questionnaire in order to evaluate the importance they attached to 48 group memberships. Time spent with Internet and with computer-mediated communication was also assessed. A PC factorial analysis aggregated computer-using items in a new technologies information (NTI) identity factor. A set of regres-sion analyses showed that all identity patternswere best predicted by demographic variables except forNTI and community social identities thatwere best predicted by time spent inCMC and in the Internet. Although there is no ground for claiming that CMC brings some change to people’s evaluation of their group memberships, the authors can state that Internauts’ identity does not integrate self-perceptions of significant interpersonal connectedness or of orientation toward meeting different people, as most sociological and psychological litera-ture has underlined. Several speculations aremade about computers and Internet infor-mation and communication power to change our societies’ways of life. Thesemainly refer to traditional learningmethods aswell as to socialization channels that supposedly affect the way we under-stand ourselves and others (Tolhurst, Pike, Blanton, & Harris, 1994). Since the Internet became public in 1989, some contributions came fromdifferent Social Sciences to understand its effect on self-perceptions. Moreover, because the Internet has become an interac-tive communicational space, it seemed important to understand how <b>this</b> new <b>way</b> <b>of</b> non–face-to-face <b>communication</b> shapes ou...|$|R
40|$|Extremism {{occurring}} {{in this world}} and, specifically, in Indonesia recently is one form {{of the failure of}} education which does not accommodate multiculturalism. Terrorism is obviously the result of the distorted education which only focuses on mono-cultural values. Later, this will develop exclusivism {{in which there is no}} room for pluralism. <b>This</b> one-sided <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> is dangerous for multiculturalism, which is, in fact, basic for human being. Therefore, the paper will explore how literature is fruitful for the students to experience multiculturalism and freely communicating its values. Literature is one <b>of</b> the best <b>ways</b> to lead the students to experience multiculturalism. This is supported by the fact that it is multi-interpretable. Even literature itself has so many definitions though it means nothing without appropriate appreciation. When asked to read and interpret particular literary text there will be so many ideas different one another. This is in point of fact the real representation of multiculturalism in its specific and particular definition. In addition, these colorful interpretations come about as a consequence of the different milieu of the author, the work it self and the reader: be it social, cultural, and religious background. The <b>communication</b> <b>of</b> the readers’ and authors’ values through literature is what most matters in teaching literature. Additionally, the teaching-learning process must emphasize more to embed, grow, and develop the affective side of the students than the cognitive one. And since the students as the readers are from different backgrounds, those differences must be highly appreciated and it will enrich the teaching-learning process. This is possible if the student-centered approach is employed consistently and should be explicitly stated in the course syllabus and also lesson plan. To conclude, it is evident that the <b>communication</b> <b>of</b> the different and various values of life becomes the key of teaching literature in multicultural context. If this kind of teaching-learning process works well, one-sided <b>way</b> <b>of</b> communicating values, which is obviously dangerous, will no longer have a place to grow up, for the affective mission of literature is to be sensitive and to understand others. The students will be more open-minded and will not be trapped in the destructive extremism as differences are basic for human being. They will see life in this world not as black and white but as the rainbow, which is always beautiful through times. Key words: experiencing multiculturalism, student-centered approach, teaching literature, <b>communication</b> <b>of</b> value...|$|R
