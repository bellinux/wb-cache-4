Although a territory of the Russian Empire, Finland possessed its own government and constitution, so in a way it would be like being in Russia and not being at the same time. They had already been once invited to Haikko, a beautiful estate, near Borgå, a small town on the south coast of Finland, not far away from Helsinki. The Provisional Government permitted them to leave, though they were not allowed to take anything of value with them. They sewed jewels into the family's clothing, hoping it would not be discovered by the authorities. They were permitted to board a train without incident {{in the first week of}} June 1917.|$|E

500|$|Knight {{argues that}} the human {{population}} is far greater than the Earth can handle, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> for Earth's biosphere is for humans to voluntarily cease reproducing. He says that humans are [...] "incompatible with the biosphere" [...] and that human existence is causing environmental damage which will eventually bring about the extinction of humans (as well as other organisms). According to Knight, {{the vast majority of}} human societies have not lived sustainable lifestyles, and attempts to live environmentally friendly lifestyles do not change the fact that human existence has ultimately been destructive to the Earth and many of its non-human organisms. Voluntary human extinction is promoted {{on the grounds that it}} will prevent human suffering and the extinction of other species; Knight points out that many species are threatened by the increasing human population.|$|E
500|$|The film {{is presumed}} lost as no known {{surviving}} {{copies of the}} film exist. A synopsis of the film was published in The Moving Picture World. It states: [...] "Glade and Sears are next door neighbors and old friends. Glade has a daughter, while Sears has a son. The young people have never met, being away at school while the old folks have been cementing their friendship. As the two men own adjoining places, they believe <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> for the younger people {{to do is to}} get married. So they try to bring this about. Gladys Glade and Charlie Sears meet on the train while they are returning home and start a flirtation. Perhaps they would have married in the end, if the old folks hadn't 'butted in.' As it is, they lose all interest in each other. Then the fathers try another tack. They decide to be bitter enemies in public, hoping the opposition will bring the children together. The new plan works like a charm, and Gladys and Charlie, realizing their parents' shortcomings, decide to elope. They do so, much to the satisfaction of Glade and Sears." ...|$|E

Michaelangelo Matos of the Minneapolis' City Pages was also fond of the cover, calling it [...] "giddy without putting a mask on the experience that went into getting it made". CMJ New Music Monthlys Ken Scrudato claimed that their cover proved that Ivy is [...] "painfully hip". Heather Phares, an editor for AllMusic, called the track a highlight on Long Distance due to its [...] "superior songwriting", although she {{found it to be}} [...] "an ironic move". Sheffield of Rolling Stone was positive, claiming that Durand [...] "end Long Distance on an enigmatic, seductive and wildly appropriate note" [...] with [...] "Digging Your Scene". Regarding its inclusion on Guestroom, Noel Dix from Exclaim! remarked that on the album, the best tracks were ones that are already [...] "familiar to Ivy fans", alluding to the fact that their cover had been previously released; he also stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> about their rendition was the [...] "joyful infection" [...] it induces.|$|E

2500|$|The {{instrumental}} backing {{was effectively}} recorded {{live in the}} studio, while Van Vliet overdubbed most of the vocals in only partial sync with the music by hearing the slight sound leakage through the studio window.

2500|$|The game {{of chicken}} models two drivers, both {{headed for a}} single-lane bridge from {{opposite}} directions. [...] The first to swerve away yields the bridge to the other. If neither player swerves, {{the result is a}} costly deadlock {{in the middle of the}} bridge, or a potentially fatal head-on collision. [...] It is presumed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> for each driver is to stay straight while the other swerves (since the other is the [...] "chicken" [...] while a crash is avoided). [...] Additionally, a crash is presumed to be the worst outcome for both players. [...] This yields a situation where each player, in attempting to secure his best outcome, risks the worst.|$|E
2500|$|RC {{approaches}} {{the issue of}} feelings between co-counsellors by having a strict [...] "no-socialising" [...] rule. RC co-counsellors are expected not to socialise or have social or sexual relationships with other co-counsellors unless these relationships pre-dated their becoming co-counsellors. [...] RC specifically rejects the label [...] "transference" [...] for this phenomenon, as this is {{seen as part of}} a [...] "symptomatic" [...] method typical in psychology; the original theory of co-counselling (from RC) teaches <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> to do in these circumstances is repeatedly counsel on, and [...] "discharge" [...] about, such feelings. In addition, methods of [...] "getting attention out of distress" [...] are available which help with the difficulty of [...] "switching roles" [...] between counselor and client. When taught correctly, counselors are soon able to grasp the difference between counselling relationships and those from outside life. However, sometimes there is a marked pull to [...] "socialise" [...] or confuse the boundaries of the co-counselling relationship with other types of relationships. This is one reason why many consider a well-organised community of co-counsellors with clear rules to be essential in the successful practise of co-counselling.|$|E
2500|$|In 1893, after {{receiving}} a letter from Cosima Wagner telling {{him that he had}} to read Gobineau's Essai sur l'inégalité des races humaines, Chamberlain, who was fluent in French, duly complied with her request. Chamberlain accepted Gobineau's belief in an Aryan master-race, but rejected his pessimism, writing that Gobineau's philosophy was [...] "the grave of every attempt to deal practically with the race question and left only one honorable solution, that we at once put a bullet through our heads". Chamberlain's time in Vienna shaped his anti-Semitism and Pan-Germanism. Despite living in Vienna from 1889 to 1909 when he moved to Bayreuth, Chamberlain had nothing but contempt for the multi-ethnic, multi-religious Habsburg empire, taking the viewpoint <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> that could happen to the Austrian empire would be for it to be annexed by Germany to end the Völkerchaos (chaos of the peoples). Vienna had a large Jewish population (until 1938, Vienna was about [...] 10% Jewish), and Chamberlain's time in Vienna marked the only time in his life when he actually encountered Jews. Chamberlain's letters from Vienna constantly complain about how he was having to meet and deal with Jews, every one of whom he detested. In 1894 after visiting a spa, Chamberlain wrote: [...] "Unfortunately like everything else...it has fallen {{into the hands of the}} Jews, which includes two consequences: every individual is bled to the utmost and systematically, and there is neither order nor cleanliness". In 1895, he wrote: However, we shall have to move soon anyway, for our house having been sold to a Jew...it will soon be impossible for decent people to live in it...Already the house being almost quite full of Jews, we have to live in a state of continual warfare with the vermin which is a constant and invariable follower of this chosen people even in the most well-to-do classes. In another letter of 1895, Chamberlain wrote he was still influenced by French anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's critique of the Jews as mindlessly materialistic, writing that Proudhon was [...] "one of the most acute minds of the century" [...] and [...] "I find many points of contact between the Wagner-Schiller mode of thought and the anarchism of Proudhon." [...] At the same time, Chamberlain's marriage to Anna began to fall apart as his wife was frequently sick and though she assisted her husband with his writings, he did not find her very intellectually stimulating. Chamberlain started to complain more and more that his wife's frequent illnesses forced him to tend to her and were holding back his career.|$|E
