5|$|As the American and South Korean forces {{approached}} the Chinese defenses, they {{were met with}} grenades, Bangalore torpedoes, shaped charges and rocks. Unable <b>to</b> <b>safely</b> advance, American and South Korean troops were forced to rely on close-support artillery to subdue Chinese resistance, but a complex network of bunkers and tunnels allowed the Chinese to bring up reinforcements as the above-ground troops were depleted. Although the 31st Infantry Regiment was equipped with ballistic vests in the first mass military deployment of modern personal armor; its 1st and 3rd battalions nevertheless suffered 96 fatalities, with an additional 337 men wounded in the first attack – the heaviest casualties the 31st Infantry Regiment had suffered {{in a single day}} during the war.|$|E

Taylor was recommended for an award by BOAC, but following {{the publication of the}} official inquiry report in August 1969, the decision was taken at ministerial level not to recognise any member of the flight crew. Both Taylor and Hutchinson received, along with First Officer Francis Kirkland and Check Captain Geoffrey Moss, but not Flight Engineer Thomas Hicks, commendations from BOAC, and Captain Taylor was awarded the British Airline Pilots Association Gold Medal.|$|E

After traveling around the British Isles into the Bay of Biscay and the English Channel, U-47 sank a further three vessels, Navasota on 5 December, the Norwegian steamer MV Britta on 6 December and Tajandoen on 7 December. Following the sinking of Navasota, British destroyers briefly fired depth charges at the U-boat but she managed <b>to</b> <b>safely</b> evade the attack without any damage.|$|E
5|$|In August 2010, General Motors began a {{training}} program for first responders when performing rescue duties involving the Chevrolet Volt. The program began at the 2010 Fire-Rescue International in Chicago, using a pre-production Volt for a live extrication exercise. Chicago firefighters demonstrated the sequence of tasks required <b>to</b> <b>safely</b> disable the vehicle’s powertrain and its 12-volt electrical system, which controls its high-voltage components, and then proceed to extricate injured occupants. , additional training workshops {{had taken place in}} several other cities corresponding to the Volt's initial launch markets. An Emergency Response Guide for the 2011 Volt was made available at its Service Technical College for use by emergency responders. The guide also describes methods of disabling the high voltage system and identifies cut zone information.|$|E

5|$|In aikido, as in {{virtually}} all Japanese martial arts, there are both physical and mental aspects of training. The physical training in aikido is diverse, covering both general physical fitness and conditioning, as well as specific techniques. Because {{a substantial portion of}} any aikido curriculum consists of throws, beginners learn how <b>to</b> <b>safely</b> fall or roll. The specific techniques for attack include both strikes and grabs; the techniques for defense consist of throws and pins. After basic techniques are learned, students study freestyle defense against multiple opponents, and techniques with weapons.|$|E
5|$|Myxedema coma {{or severe}} decompensated {{hypothyroidism}} usually requires {{admission to the}} intensive care, close observation and treatment of abnormalities in breathing, temperature control, blood pressure, and sodium levels. Mechanical ventilation may be required, as well as fluid replacement, vasopressor agents, careful rewarming, and corticosteroids (for possible adrenal insufficiency which can occur together with hypothyroidism). Careful correction of low sodium levels may be achieved with hypertonic saline solutions or vasopressin receptor antagonists. For rapid treatment of the hypothyroidism, levothyroxine or liothyronine may be administered intravenously, particularly if the level of consciousness is too low to be able <b>to</b> <b>safely</b> swallow medication.|$|E
5|$|Shepard then {{recruits}} former squad member Tali'Zorah, Thane Krios, and Samara (later optionally {{replaced by}} Morinth), before {{being sent to}} explore a supposedly disabled Collector ship.

With EDI's help, Shepard also finds out how to bypass the Omega-4 Relay before being ambushed by the Collectors. Although Shepard's squad escape, his/her relationship with the Illusive Man is strained due to his prior knowledge of the trap. After optionally earning the loyalty of the squad, Shepard visits a derelict Reaper and acquires an IFF necessary <b>to</b> <b>safely</b> travel through the Omega-4 Relay.
