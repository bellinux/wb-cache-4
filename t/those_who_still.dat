5|$|Overall, {{the outcome}} for acute {{low back pain}} is positive. Pain and {{disability}} usually improve {{a great deal in}} the first six weeks, with complete recovery reported by 40 to 90%. In <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>still</b> have symptoms after six weeks, improvement is generally slower with only small gains up to one year. At one year, pain and disability levels are low to minimal in most people. Distress, previous low back pain, and job satisfaction are predictors of long-term outcome after an episode of acute pain. Certain psychological problems such as depression, or unhappiness due to loss of employment may prolong the episode of low back pain. Following a first episode of back pain, recurrences occur in more than half of people.|$|E

25|$|He was President of the MCC for 2010–11, a rare honour for a journalist. His time {{in office}} was a {{difficult}} one, as it coincided with the £400 million redevelopment plan for Lord's being dropped in favour of something better suited to the difficult economic situation.

25|$|Johannes Kepler {{analysed}} Tycho Brahe's famously accurate {{observations and}} afterwards constructed his three laws in 1609 and 1619, {{based on a}} heliocentric view where the planets move in elliptical paths. Using these laws, {{he was the first}} astronomer to successfully predict a transit of Venus (for the year 1631). The change from circular orbits to elliptical planetary paths dramatically improved the accuracy of celestial observations and predictions. Because the heliocentric model by Copernicus was no more accurate than Ptolemy's system, new observations were needed to persuade <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>still</b> held on to the geocentric model. However, Kepler's laws based on Brahe's data became a problem which geocentrists could not easily overcome.|$|E
25|$|Milton {{began writing}} a {{pamphlet}} during early February 1660 while the Rump Parliament was in {{session with the}} support of General George Monck. It seemed certain that Monck would put forth a republican form of government that Milton supported but various complications divided Monck from the Parliament during this time. On 21 February, Monck forced Parliament to readmit members that were purged in December 1648 and it seemed certain that the Commonwealth would stay in power. The tract was written to persuade <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>still</b> thought that a monarchy would serve as a better form of government than the one Monck was setting into motion.|$|E

25|$|The Royalists {{were now}} {{fighting}} with the courage of despair. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>still</b> fought against Charles did so with the full determination to ensure the triumph of their cause, and with {{the conviction that the}} only possible way was the annihilation of the enemy's armed forces. The majority, however, were so weary of the war that the Earl of Manchester's Presbyterian royalism, which contributed so materially to the prolongation of the struggle, would probably have been accepted by four-fifths of all England as the basis of a peace. It was, in fact, in the face of almost universal opposition, that Fairfax and Cromwell and their friends at Westminster guided the cause of their weaker comrades to complete victory.|$|E

Following his expulsion from the Writers' Society, Aderca lost his financial backbone. According to poet Virgil Carianopol, he relied on help from fellow writer Marius Mircu (known {{to him by the}} pen name G. M. Vlădescu), whose estate and revenue was distributed among a host a marginalized artists. In August 1941, the antisemitic policies endorsed by Antonescu exposed Aderca to the risk of internment in a labor camp for Jewish prisoners. He received official notice to present himself for deportation, but, owing to his World War I military record, he was eventually granted a reprieve.|$|E

25|$|The five Virginia Conventions (1774–1776) would {{guide the}} Old Dominion to {{independence}} as royal authority {{came to an}} end. Their work was advanced by many resolutions of county meetings, denying the authority of Parliament over the colonies, and calling for a boycott of imports. The first met in Williamsburg in the chamber of the Burgesses beginning on August 1; Dunmore was absent from the capital fighting the Native Americans and could not interfere. Divided between those who wanted separation from Britain and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>still</b> hoped for some accommodation, it met for a week; one major decision was the election of delegates to a Continental Congress in Philadelphia. Henry was chosen as one of seven delegates, tying for second place with George Washington, burgess for Fairfax County, with both receiving three votes less than Peyton Randolph.|$|E
25|$|As to {{the other}} {{question}} — that of singing roles that, according to self-proclaimed experts, {{we ought not to}} be singing — I have a little story to tell. When I decided to sing Otello, many people told me that I was crazy. Mario Del Monaco, they said, had had the proper kind of voice for the role, and my voice was nothing like his. Twenty years earlier, Del Monaco had been warned not to sing Otello because his voice was nothing like that of Ramon Vinay, who was then performing the opera all over the world. Vinay, of course, had heard that only a tenor with a piercing sound like Giovanni Martinelli's ought to sing the part. Some years earlier, Martinelli had had Antonin Trantoul, who had sung Otello at La Scala in the twenties, held up to him as a shining example; but at La Scala, <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>still</b> remembered the very first Otello, Francesco Tamagno, had found Trantoul completely unsatisfactory. But there exists a letter from Verdi to his publisher in which the composer makes it quite clear that Tamagno left a great deal to be desired.|$|E
500|$|Watts had {{a strong}} belief in the idea that modern society was prioritising wealth over social values, and that this attitude, which he {{described}} as [...] "the hypocritical veiling of the daily sacrifice made to this deity", was leading to the decline of society.

500|$|Watts {{himself was}} {{ambivalent}} when questioned about the religious {{significance of the}} image, saying that [...] "I made Hope blind so expecting nothing", although after his death his widow Mary Seton Watts wrote that {{the message of the}} painting was that [...] "Faith must be the companion of Hope. Faith is the substance, the assurance of things hoped for, because it is the evidence of things not seen." [...] Malcolm Warner, curator of the Yale Center for British Art, interpreted the work differently, writing in 1996 that [...] "the quiet sound of the lyre's single string is all that is left of the full music of religious faith; <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>still</b> listen are blindfolded in the sense that, even if real reasons for Hope exist, they cannot see them; Hope remains a virtue, but in the age of scientific materialism a weak and ambiguous one".|$|E
500|$|Retrospective reviews on Impossible Princess—both from European and Australasian areas—have {{been much}} more positive, with AllMusic's Chris True {{labelling}} it a [...] "pretty damn good record", and openly criticised the critical reception around the album's early release, deeming it a [...] "shame". Nevertheless, he believed that [...] "Unlike Minogue's early work, this album sounds stronger and has a more natural feel. Her songwriting abilities {{have come a long}} way, and Impossible Princess actually flows together as an album." [...] Slant Magazine editor Sal Cinquemani awarded it four stars, and was impressed with the album's [...] "starkly personal and unified cord", saying it [...] "is the work of an artist willing to take risks, not a pop queen concerned with preserving her reign." [...] Cinquemani added it to the staff choices of their Vital Pop: 50 Essential Pop Albums lists. Awarding four stars, Nick Levine from British tabloid Digital Spy commended the mixture of genres and Minogue's input. Although he noticed the material's lack of commercial appeal, he concluded, [...] "Brave, revealing and rarely less than surprising, it's a key piece in the trickier-than-you-think jigsaw puzzle that is Kylie Minogue's recording career." [...] While reviewing her tenth album X (2007), Evan Sawdey from PopMatters commented [...] "For <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>still</b> have a copy of her Manic Street Preachers-assisted Impossible Princess, then you have one of the most crazed, damn-near perfect dance-pop albums ever created." ...|$|E
500|$|At dawn, Xerxes made libations, {{pausing to}} allow the Immortals {{sufficient}} time to descend the mountain, and then began his advance. A Persian force of 10,000 men, comprising light infantry and cavalry, charged {{at the front of}} the Greek formation. The Greeks this time sallied forth from the wall to meet the Persians in the wider part of the pass, in an attempt to slaughter as many Persians as they could. They fought with spears, until every spear was shattered, and then switched to xiphē (short swords). In this struggle, Herodotus states that two of Xerxes' brothers fell: Abrocomes and Hyperanthes. Leonidas also died in the assault, shot down by Persian archers, and the two sides fought over his body; the Greeks took possession. As the Immortals approached, the Greeks withdrew and took a stand on a hill behind the wall. The Thebans [...] "moved away from their companions, and with hands upraised, advanced toward the barbarians..." [...] (Rawlinson translation), but a few were slain before their surrender was accepted. The king later had the Theban prisoners branded with the royal mark. Of the remaining defenders, Herodotus says: [...] "Here they defended themselves to the last, <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>still</b> had swords using them, and the others resisting with their hands and teeth." [...] Tearing down part of the wall, Xerxes ordered the hill surrounded, and the Persians rained down arrows until every last Greek was dead. In 1939, archaeologist Spyridon Marinatos, excavating at Thermopylae, found large numbers of Persian bronze arrowheads on Kolonos Hill, which changed the identification of the hill on which the Greeks were thought to have died from a smaller one nearer the wall.|$|E
