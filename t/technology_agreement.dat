25|$|Taiwan's {{information}} technology industry has {{played an important role}} in the worldwide IT market over the last 20 years. In 1960, the electronics industry in Taiwan was virtually nonexistent. However, with the government's focus on development of expertise with high technology, along with marketing and management knowledge to establish its own industries, companies such as TSMC and UMC were established. The industry used its industrial resources and product management experience to cooperate closely with major international suppliers to become the research and development hub of the Asia-Pacific region. The structure of the industry in Taiwan includes a handful of companies at the top along with many small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) which account for 85% of industrial output. These SMEs usually produce products on an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or original design manufacturer (ODM) basis, resulting in less resources spent on research and development. Due to the emphasis of the OEM/ODM model, companies are usually unable to make in-depth assessments for investment, production, and marketing of new products, instead relying upon importation of key components and advanced technology from the United States and Japan. Twenty of the top information and communication technology (ICT) companies have International Procurement Offices set up in Taiwan. As a signer of the Information <b>Technology</b> <b>Agreement,</b> Taiwan phased out tariffs on IT products since 1 January 2002.|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} devoted to {{research}} and <b>technology</b> <b>agreements</b> in Norway, and their {{positive impact on the}} development of relations with foreign oil and gas companies during the period of formation of the Norwegian oil and gas industry. Based on archival documents, the article considers Norway’s experience of conclusion of research and <b>technology</b> <b>agreements</b> for transferring the latest technologies of exploration and oil and gas production to national oil and gas companies {{in the process of developing}} the country’s oil and gas industry. The author concludes that Norway made significant scientific and technological progress through promoting active cooperation with foreign companies. Norway’s successful experience could be applied by Russian state authorities in order to develop relations with foreign oil companies. These companies could take part in offshore exploration in the Russian sector of the Barents Sea through concluding similar agreements between Russian state institutions, and foreign oil and gas companies, which would give an impetus to the development of the technological component of Russia’s oil and gas sector. Research and <b>technology</b> <b>agreements</b> have been used by Norwegians with the aim of diversification of the economy and prevention of excessive dependence on the energy sector, which is one of the major challenges faced by Russia. ...|$|R

Multilateral and hub-and-spoke coalitional structures are PCPNE, even in large economies, {{in the absence of}} income transfers for different values of attrition costs. Fully participated multilateral coalitional structures are not stable in the presence of income transfers; however, the size of the stable coalition increases as the economy expands...|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s Indian Railways began {{conversion}} of its mainline from steam to diesel locomotives. For this conversion General Motors Electro-Motive Division (EMD) and the American Locomotive Company (ALCo) {{were asked to}} submit designs for new diesel locomotives. Each company submitted prototypes. Indian Railways designated these prototypes the WDM-4 class and the WDM-2 class respectively. Technologically the General Motors WDM-4 was superior to ALCO's WDM-2, but Indian Railways required a transfer of <b>technology</b> <b>agreement</b> that would allow these locomotives to be manufactured in India. General Motors did not agree to the transfer of <b>technology</b> <b>agreement</b> so the ALCo prototype was selected for production. The first few prototype WDM-2 were imported. After Diesel Locomotive Works (DLW) completed construction of its factory in Varanasi, production of the locomotives began in India. The first 12 locos were built using kits imported from ALCo in the United States. After that DLW started manufacturing the WDM-2 locomotives from their own components. Since then over 2,800 locomotives have been manufactured and the WDM-2 {{has become the most}} popular locomotive in India.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} role of {{intellectual}} property rights (IPRs) in shaping the GSM industry. This industry {{is an example of}} a high-tech industry in which standards play a large role. In the process of designing the GSM standard, a lot of attention has been given to IPRs, mainly to avoid a situation in which a single IPR holder could hamper or even totally block the development of the standard. Nevertheless, the ultimate GSM standard contains a large amount of so-called ‘essential IPRs’, i. e., IPRs without which the implementation of GSM products is impossible. The paper starts with a general discussion of the development of GSM, and {{the role of}} firm strategy and IPRs in this process. Next, we present a database on the essential IPRs in the GSM standard. This database has been compiled on the basis of international patent statistics, and the data that manufacturers have supplied to ETSI, the European standardization body responsible for defining the GSM standard. We use this database to assess the dynamic IPR position of firms in the original GSM standard and its subsequent development. In a next part of our analysis, we relate the firm’s IPR position to the trends in strategic <b>technology</b> <b>agreements</b> in the mobile telecommunications field. We ask the question whether firms that are powerful in terms of IPRs are also the firms that are ‘central’ in the <b>technology</b> <b>agreements</b> network (or vice versa). We also investigate whether developments over time in the <b>technology</b> <b>agreements</b> data follow from the dynamic movements in the IPR position of a firm, and which other factors play a role in this...|$|R
