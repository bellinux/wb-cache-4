25|$|Since {{the failure}} of Cisalpino, {{a joint venture between}} the Italian Trenitalia and the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB), the Pendolinos used for transalpine {{transport}} between Switzerland and Italy were split between Trenitalia (5 ETR 470 and 7 ETR 610) and SBB (4 ETR 470 and 7 ETR 610). The low reliability of the timetable and of the ETR 470 has led SBB and Trenitalia to always have a reserve <b>train</b> <b>ready</b> at each terminus of the Milan-Zürich route.|$|E
25|$|Given the {{limitations}} of the 3ª CCE to deal with the uprising in such a large region, the Command of the 3rd Military Region in Luanda decided to organize an operation with a stronger military force to subjugate it. A provisional battalion under the command of Major Rebocho Vaz was organized by the Luanda Infantry Regiment, integrating the 3ª CCE, the 4ª CCE (stationed in Luanda) and the 5ª CCE (that was still in route from the Metropole to Angola). On 4 February, the 4ª CCE was already embarked in the <b>train</b> <b>ready</b> to be dispatched to Malanje, when an uprising at Luanda erupted, with several prisons and Police facilities being stormed. Despite the indefinite situation at Luanda and despite having few combat units available there, General Libório, commander of the 3ª Military Region decided to go forward with the sending of the 4ª CCE to Malanje, which arrived there on 5 February. The provisional battalion started gradually the operations to subdue the uprising.|$|E

50|$|During {{the initial}} {{operation}} period, the new platforms and track were only operated on weekdays except public holidays, {{during the morning}} peak hour period, from 7:00 am to 9:00 am, as there were only five new C151A <b>trains</b> <b>ready</b> for revenue service. Evening peak hour operation from 5:00 pm to 8:00 pm on weekdays started from 27 December 2011 while the morning peak hour period was extended to end an hour later at 10:00 am after the next batch of <b>trains</b> became <b>ready</b> for revenue service.|$|R
60|$|More shame for you, had Percy almost said; but he {{no longer}} opposed Arthur's homeward instinct, and, finding a <b>train</b> <b>ready</b> to start, left their luggage to its fate, and {{resolved}} not {{to lose sight of}} him till he was safely deposited at his own house. Such care was in truth needed; the journey was a dreadful one, the suffering increased every hour, and when at length, in the dusk of the evening, they arrived in Cadogan-place, he could hardly mount the stairs, even with Percy's assistance.|$|E
60|$|We {{thought of}} {{stopping}} in Kansas City, {{but when we}} got there we found a <b>train</b> <b>ready</b> and a crowd of hospitable Kansians to take us on to Lawrence, to which I proceeded. I shall not soon forget my good days in L., in company with Judge Usher and his sons, (especially John and Linton,) true westerners of the noblest type. Nor the similar days in Topeka. Nor the brotherly kindness of my RR. friends there, and the city and State officials. Lawrence and Topeka are large, bustling, half-rural, handsome cities. I took two or three long drives about the latter, drawn by a spirited team over smooth roads.|$|E
60|$|Following the {{indication}} {{which the}} man had given, Mr. George and Rollo passed out upon the platform, where they found the <b>train</b> <b>ready</b> for them. There were various attendants upon the platform, dressed in a quaint sort of uniform, the livery, as it were, of the railroad company. One of them looked at Rollo's ticket, and then {{opened the door of}} a first-class car. The cars were made like those in England, in separate compartments, each compartment being like a large coach, with one front seat, and one back, facing each other. There were four places; that is, room for four passengers on each seat. Of course, only those at the ends were near the window. Rollo and Mr. George took the two seats nearest the window on the side where they got in, as one of the seats at the opposite side was already occupied by a gentleman. The gentleman seemed to be an Englishman, for he was reading the London Times.|$|E

6000|$|At 10.20 P.M. the Central Pacific {{overland}} {{pulled out}} of the depot at Sacramento for the East--that particular item of time-table is indelibly engraved on my memory. There were about a dozen in our gang, and we strung out in the darkness ahead of the <b>train</b> <b>ready</b> to take her out. All the local road-kids that we knew came down to see us off--also, to [...] "ditch" [...] us if they could. That was their idea of a joke, and there were only about forty of them to carry it out. Their ring-leader was a crackerjack road-kid named Bob. Sacramento was his home town, but he'd hit The Road pretty well everywhere over the whole country. He took French Kid and me aside and gave us advice something like this: [...] "We're goin' to try an' ditch your bunch, see? Youse two are weak. The rest of the push can take care of itself. So, as soon as youse two nail a blind, deck her. An' stay on the decks till youse pass Roseville Junction, at which burg the constables are horstile, sloughin' in everybody on sight." ...|$|E
6000|$|Peals of {{laughter}} (once you {{are allowed to}} be non-official) could not fail, as an ovation, from the King;--so report the French Biographers. But there was, besides, strict promise that the Piece should be suppressed: [...] "Never do to send our President pirouetting through the world in this manner, with his wig on fire; promise me, on your honor!" [...] Voltaire promised. But, alas, how could Voltaire perform! Once more the Rhadamanthine fact is: Voltaire, as King's Chamberlain, was bound, without any promise, to forbear, and rigidly suppress such an AKAKIA against the King's Perpetual President. But withal let candid readers consider {{how difficult it was}} to do. The absurd blusterous Turkey-cock, who has, every now and then, been tyrannizing over you for twenty years, here you have him filled with gunpowder, so to speak, and the train laid. There wants but one spark,--(edition printed in Holland, edition done in Berlin, plenty of editions made or makable by a little surreptitious legerdemain,--and I never knew whether it was AKAKIA in print, or AKAKIA in manuscript, that King and King's Chamberlain were now reading together, nor does it matter much):--your Turkey surreptitiously stuffed with gunpowder, I say; <b>train</b> <b>ready</b> waiting; one flint-spark will shoot him aloft, scatter him as flaming ruin on all the winds: and you are, once and always, to withhold said spark.
