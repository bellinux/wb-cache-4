At present, most scholars are relatively mature on the research of diamond tool wear condition by the physical attributes of the PCD diamond tool and physical components of natural stone material.

Instruction Many factors have impacts on PCD diamond tool wear, including the physical characteristics of the tool, the physical properties of the stone, and cutting parameters in the machining process. The physical characteristics of PCD diamond tool mainly refers to the content and grade of the diamond, {{the characteristics of the}} <b>tool</b> <b>binding</b> agent. Diamond content of the tool is low, so does the power consumption. But on the lower diamond content, macro-breaker may be exacerbated, resulting in insufficient protrusion height, making power consumption actually increased; on the higher diamond content, increasing the power consumption, which led to shedding of the gold-shaped diamond, decreasing the abrasive resistance of the too...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{significant}} {{fraction of}} arthropods, {{as well as}} some worms and members of other phyla, contain extraordinary amounts of transition metals (Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn) and halogens (CI, Br, I) in their hardened tools (jaws, claws, fangs, stings, etc.). Bulk Zn EXAFS differs for different kinds of tools, whereas Br appears to occupy a common environment in different <b>tools.</b> Zn <b>binding</b> to histidine is observed for most samples but bulk Zn EXAFS is likely to sample a mixture of Zn coordination environments. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) suggests the presence of three main Zn coordination components. The similar Br EXAFS in widely different tools indicates that Br-phenyl is the dominant form, suggesting the presence of brominated aromatic amino acid-derived organic components in these biomaterials. Calculated Debye-Waller factors are used to simulate EXAFS when model compound data are unavailable...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Many {{scientific}} {{applications are}} conceptually built up from independent component tasks as a parameter study, optimization, or other search. Large batches of these tasks may be executed on high-end computing systems; however, {{the coordination of}} the independent processes, their data, and their data dependencies is a significant scalability challenge. Many problems must be addressed, including load balancing, data dis-tribution, notifications, concurrent programming, and linking to existing codes. In this work, we present Swift/T, a programming language and runtime that enables the rapid development of highly concurrent, task-parallel applications. Swift/T is composed of several enabling technologies to address scalability challenges, offers a high-level optimizing compiler for user programming and debugging, and provides <b>tools</b> for <b>binding</b> user code in C/C++/Fortran into a logical script.

40|$|AbstractMagnetic {{particles}} (MPs) {{are useful}} <b>tools</b> for analyte <b>binding</b> and concentration, {{which has been}} extensively exploited {{for the development of}} electrochemical magnetosensors. Here, after binding and washing, MPs are wrapped with carbon nanotubes (CNT) and layered onto an electrode. In this way, CNT wiring provides signal amplification in subsequent electrochemical detection. We demonstrate this approach by accomplishing dopamine detection and myeloperoxidase (MPO) enzymatic activity monitoring. For dopamine detection, dopamine is electrostatically bound using streptavidin-MPs and for MPO enzymatic activity monitoring, immunofunctionalized MPs and commercially available tetramethylbenzidine-based (TMB) enzymatic substrate are used...|$|R
