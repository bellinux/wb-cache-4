50|$|The basic {{version of}} the pistol is the SP22 M1. The M1 is {{equipped}} with a 4 in standard barrel, adjustable steel sights, and a two-stage trigger complete with adjustable <b>trigger</b> <b>stop.</b>|$|E
50|$|An {{adjustable}} trigger {{may have}} ways to adjust {{all of these}} stages, plus trigger location. For example, a first stage or takeup adjustment might include weight and travel, a second stage or sear engagement adjustment might include weight and travel, and a <b>trigger</b> <b>stop</b> adjustment would limit the overtravel.|$|E
5000|$|The Model 745, {{built from}} 1986-1990, was a single-action target {{version of the}} Model 645, with a match barrel, Novak sight (an {{adjustable}} rear sight was optional), an adjustable <b>trigger</b> <b>stop,</b> stainless frame,walnut grip panels and blued slide. It does not have ambidextrous controls, but does have a half-cock safety. The pistol is rollmarked [...] "IPSC 10th Anniversary 1976-1986".|$|E

5000|$|The USP Tactical (9mm Parabellum, [...]40 S&W, [...]45 ACP) {{incorporates}} a fully adjustable rear sight, a higher-profile front sight (as {{to be visible}} above the suppressor), an extended threaded barrel and O-ring, a match grade trigger, and an adjustable <b>trigger</b> <b>stop</b> (the 9mm model, referred to by HK as the [...] "USP9SD (tactical)" [...] {{does not have the}} match trigger with adjustable <b>trigger</b> <b>stop,</b> O-ring, and does not carry the [...] "Tactical" [...] marking on the slide that the USP40 and USP45 Tactical models do, making it essentially a full size USP9 with threaded barrel and raised & adjustable target sights, but those features were added to it in 2015). Sound suppressors designed for the USP Tactical are available from Brügger & Thomet and Knight's Armament. A unique feature of the USP Tactical is that the barrel is left-hand threaded (counter-clockwise to tighten), which makes the pistol incompatible with suppressors designed for the MK23 Mod 0.|$|E
5000|$|The Mitchell Alpha [...]45 is {{a pistol}} {{manufactured}} by the American Mitchell Arms company. It is [...]45 ACP in calibre and its magazine size is 8 rounds. The Alpha uses the Browning-type locking mechanism and weighs 39 ounces. There is no <b>trigger</b> <b>stop</b> on the pistol and its sights are fixed. Its external safety is compatible to the ambidextrous shooter, with an ambidextrous safety catch.|$|E
50|$|Like all air pistols {{designed}} for the 10 m Air Pistol event, it has fully adjustable sights, a mechanically adjustable trigger (for stroke and weight of 1st and 2nd phase and <b>trigger</b> <b>stop)</b> and an anatomically adjustable grip available in three sizes and for left and right-handed shooters. The model pictured here is fitted with a stabilising balance weight, designed to further improve stability of the pistol during firing and to minimize recoil.|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the standard P9S, a P9S Target model was also offered. This model included a taller front sight, a windage and elevation adjustable rear sight, an adjustable <b>trigger</b> over-travel <b>stop,</b> and an adjustable trigger that could be adjusted down to as low as approximately a 2.5# pull. The P9S Target model was offered in both 9mm as well as [...]45 ACP.|$|R
50|$|Through the years, {{there have}} been several {{variations}} on the Model 686. The Model 686 Classic Hunter was introduced in 1988 and has a 6-inch barrel and an unfluted cylinder; the Model 686 Black Stainless was introduced in 1989 and has either a 4- or 6-inch barrel with a black finish, with production limited to 5000; the Model 686 National Security Special was introduced in 1992 and has a 3- or 4-inch barrel; the Model 686 Target Champion was introduced in 1992 and has a 6-inch match barrel, adjustable <b>trigger</b> <b>stop,</b> and walnut grips; the Model 686 Power Port was introduced in 1994 and has a ported 6-inch barrel; the Model 686 Plus was introduced in 1996 and has a 2.5-inch, 3-inch, 4-inch, or 6-inch barrel, adjustable sights, 7-shot cylinder, and Hogue rubber grips. As with all current Smith & Wesson revolvers, the 686 Plus now has a key lock integral to the frame of the gun.|$|E

40|$|We {{studied the}} uses of {{information}} search results by regular clients of professional intermediaries. The clients in our study engaged in three different types of searches: (1) monitoring a well-known topic or set of variables over time, (2) following an information-gathering plan suggested by a typical approach to the task at hand, and (3) exploring a topic in an undirected fashion. In most cases, a single search evolved {{into a series of}} interconnected searches, usually beginning with a high-level overview. We identified a set of common <b>triggers</b> and <b>stop</b> conditions for further search steps. We also observed a set of common operations that clients used to analyze search results. In some settings, the number of search iterations was reduced by restructuring the work done by intermediaries. We discuss the implications of the interconnected search pattern, <b>triggers</b> and <b>stop</b> conditions, common analysis techniques, and intermediary roles for the design of information access systems...|$|R
30|$|Like for {{antibiotics}} (Table  1), {{the duration}} of fluid therapy must be as short as possible, and the volume must be tapered when shock is resolved. However, many clinicians use certain triggers to start, but are unaware of <b>triggers</b> to <b>stop</b> fluid resuscitation, increasing the potential for fluid overload. As with duration of antibiotics, {{although there is no}} strong evidence, there is a trend towards shorter duration of intravenous fluids [39].|$|R
40|$|Response {{inhibition}} {{is frequently}} investigated using the stop-signal paradigm, where participants perform a two-choice response time task that is occasionally {{interrupted by a}} stop signal instructing them to withhold their response. Stop-signal performance is formalized as a race between a go and a stop process. If the go process wins, the response is executed; if the stop process wins, the response is inhibited. Successful inhibition requires fast stop responses and a high probability of <b>triggering</b> the <b>stop</b> process. Existing methods allow for the estimation of the latency of the stop response, but are unable to identify deficiencies in <b>triggering</b> the <b>stop</b> process. We introduce a Bayesian model that addresses this limitation and enables researchers to simultaneously estimate the probability of trigger failures and the entire distribution of stopping latencies. We demonstrate that trigger failures are clearly present in two previous studies, and that ignoring them distorts estimates of stopping latencies. The parameter estimation routine is implemented in the BEESTS software (Matzke et al., Front. Quantitative Psych. Measurement, 4, 918; 2013 a) and is available at [URL]...|$|R

40|$|With margins {{for error}} {{of a few}} {{milliseconds}} and fractions of an inch {{it is not surprising}} that hitting a baseball is considered to be one of the most difficult acts in all of sports. We have been investigating this challenging behavior using a virtual baseball batting setup in which simulations of an approaching ball, pitcher, and field are combined with real-time recording of bat and limb movements. I will present evidence that baseball batting involves variable pre-programmed control in which the swing direction and movement time (MT) are set prior to the initiation of the action but can take different values from swing-to-swing. This programming process utilizes both advance information (pitch history and count) and optical information picked-up very early in the ball's flight (ball time to contact TTC and rotation direction). The pre-programmed value of MT is used to determine a critical value of TTC for swing initiation. Finally, because a baseball swing is an action that is occasionally interrupted online (i. e., a “check swing”), I will discuss experiments that examine when this pre-programmed action can be stopped and the sources of optical information that <b>trigger</b> <b>stopping...</b>|$|R

Diamonds that the player collected in earlier stages (which do not give him extra chances in Fun Follies) allow for more winning lines and a better chance at a big prize. The player is awarded for all winning lines, allowing the potential (with at least two diamonds) for up to 15 extra chances.|$|R
50|$|So between 1989 and 1992 {{the organ}} was reconstructed by Flentrop organ {{builders}} in Zaandam {{to its former}} mechanical action again more or less like Christiaan Vater made it in 1727. Today the 'bovenwerk' (Oberwerk, located {{in the top of}} the organ case) is still almost complete with stops by Vater. An exception is the 'baarpyp', which is made by Steenkuyl in 1896 and the 'Dulciaan' which is made by Flentrop in 1992. The front pipes were made in 1842 by Hermanus Knipscheer. In the situation after 1992, less than half of the pipes are historic and re-used in the 'hoofdwerk' (Great organ) and the 'Rugwerk' (Chaire organ). The keyboards and <b>stop</b> <b>triggers</b> beside it of this just mechanical baroque organ are located in the main case behind this 'rugwerk'. For this kind of baroque organs, it is characteristic that many of the stops, mainly the principals, are doubled in the trebles. This was set up to create more power in leading the congregation in their psalm singing. For complex organ works one or even two stop assistants are necessary for <b>triggering</b> these <b>stops.</b>|$|R

It is shown that these crises can occur even though the current account deficit is fully financed by foreign direct investment. However, equity and long-term bond financing may shield the economy from sudden stop crises. The paper also examines possible factors that could <b>trigger</b> sudden <b>stops,</b> and argues that the greater independence that countries have, as compared to regions of a given country, could help to explain why sudden stop crises are more prevalent and destructive at international than at national levels. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Novel event-triggered sensing and {{actuation}} {{strategies are}} presented for networked control systems with limited communication resources. Two architectures are considered: {{one with the}} controller co-located with the sensor and one with the control co-located with the actuator. A stochastic control problem with an optimal stopping rule is shown to capture two interesting instances of these architectures. The solution of the problem leads to a parametrization of the control alphabet as piecewise constant commands. The execution of the control commands is <b>triggered</b> by <b>stopping</b> rules for the sensor. In simple situations, {{it is possible to}} analytically derive the optimal controller. Examples illustrate how the new eventbased control and sensing strategies outperform conventional time-triggered schemes. ˙wt u...|$|R

40|$|Cortical {{spreading}} depression, a depolarization wave {{originating in}} the visual cortex and traveling towards the frontal lobe, is commonly accepted as a correlate of migraine visual aura.
