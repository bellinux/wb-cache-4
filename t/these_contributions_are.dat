2500|$|The {{contributions}} {{of women to}} the revolutions and the intentions behind <b>these</b> <b>contributions</b> <b>are</b> complex and layered. The motivations of women for {{being part of the}} revolutions were complex and varied among a plethora of religious, political and economic reasons and women participating were from various classes and backgrounds. Many Western educated upper-middle class women from secular, urban and professional families were involved as well as many women from working-class and rural backgrounds. [...] There were groups as varied as the Fida’iyan-i Khalq and the Mujahedin were functioning as guerrilla units during the revolutions in opposition to the Shah’s regime. There were also other groups of women with various agendas that sometimes converged and sometimes diverged from the Islamic Republic's political positions. For example, organized feminism which was around since the Pahlavi dynasty, joined the revolutionary movement after the Shah dropped the cabinet position on Women's Affairs to appease the Islamists. Members of the Women's Organization of Iran marched in support for the revolution and it was important that women very much linked to the government also turned against the Shah's regime. Yet, there were later some tension between feminists' dress and the revolution's stance on women's clothing and they began to feel uncomfortable at opposition events.|$|E

2500|$|Jandek's first album, Ready for the House, though {{obviously}} a solo work, was originally credited to a band called The Units. As explained {{in an interview}} in the first issue of Spin, Smith was forced to change the name [...] The Units by an identically named Californian group already in possession of a trademark on the name, after Scott Ryser from The Units wrote Smith a letter with documentation. All reissues of this first album and all subsequent Corwood releases have been credited to [...] "Jandek". In Trubee's interview, Smith claims he came up with the name Jandek while on the telephone with a person named Decker during the month of January. Smith's initial use of a plural band name (and Corwood's curious tendency to refer to [...] as [...] "a representative from Corwood Industries") has led some fans to suggest that the reclusive artist intended his oeuvre to be perceived as the work of an anonymous collective rather than that of a single man. Indeed, though roughly two-thirds of his records are solo affairs, the other third have variably featured female vocalists, different male vocalists, bass guitar, electric guitar, drums, and accordion. <b>These</b> <b>contributions</b> <b>are</b> usually credited to outside collaborators, but in the Spin interview as well as a letter to DJ Irwin Chusid the artist admitted to having overdubbed parts himself on occasion, such as on the album The Rocks Crumble. No proper credits list has ever appeared on an album, but song titles have included [...] "Nancy Sings" [...] and [...] "John Plays Drums", though those pieces are two different versions of the same song.|$|E
