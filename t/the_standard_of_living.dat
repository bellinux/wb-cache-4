5|$|Social conditions, <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> and the {{self-confidence}} of {{the workers}} gradually improved due to industrialization between 1870–1916, but while <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> rose among the common people, the rift {{between rich and poor}} deepened markedly. The commoners' rising awareness of the socioeconomic and political questions interacted with the ideas of socialism, social liberalism and nationalism (Fennomania). The workers' responses and the corresponding counteracts of the dominating upper factions steepened the social relations in Finland.|$|E

40|$|The {{liberalization}} of international trade, {{due to the}} elimination of market barriers between countries {{within the context of}} economic unions, like the European Union (EU) and the expansion of globalization have caused increased competitiveness, at both geographical and sector level. European Commission documents state competitiveness as a continuous rise in <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> <b>of</b> a nation or region, a definition which combines competitiveness with sustainability and social goals. Although, one of the EU integration objectives is the sustainable rise in <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> <b>of</b> a nation, in the case of Greece this seems to be quite problematic. In a long term basis, the Common Agricultural Policy application found country’s agriculture unprepared and weak to face the new market conditions. The Greek economic crisis can be considered as an opportunity to redefine country’s entire development strategy. As far as the agricultural sector is concerned, this re- establishment could use the principles of sustainability, showing proper respect to the economical, social and environmental characteristics of the regions...|$|R
5|$|Deep ecology is a {{movement}} founded by Arne Naess that establishes principles {{for the well-being of}} all life on Earth and the richness and diversity of life forms. The movement advocates, among other things, a substantial decrease in human population and consumption along with the reduction of human interference with the nonhuman world. To achieve this, deep ecologists advocate policies for basic economic, technological, and ideological structures that will {{improve the quality of life}} rather than <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>living.</b> Those who subscribe to these principles are obliged to make the necessary change happen. The concept of a billion-year Sustainocene has been developed to initiate policy consideration of an earth where human structures power and fuel the needs of that species (for example through artificial photosynthesis) allowing Rights of Nature.|$|E
5|$|During the {{oil boom}} of the 1970s, Nigeria joined OPEC and the huge oil {{revenues}} it was generating enriched the economy. Despite these revenues, the military government did little to improve <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> of the population, help small and medium businesses, or invest in infrastructure. As oil revenues fueled the rise of federal subsidies to states, the federal government became the centre of political struggle and the threshold {{of power in the}} country. As oil production and revenue rose, the Nigerian government became increasingly dependent on oil revenues and on international commodity markets for budgetary and economic concerns. It did not develop alternate revenue sources in the economy for economic stability. That spelled doom to federalism in Nigeria.|$|E
5|$|In May 1969, {{discontent with}} Krieger's {{economic}} policies led to riots {{in the cities}} of Corrientes, Rosario and Córdoba. Krieger was removed, but the Onganía administration was unable to agree on an alternative economic policy. By 1970, the authorities were no longer capable of maintaining wage restraints, leading to a wage-price spiral. As the economy started to languish and import substitution industrialization ran out of steam, urban migration slowed. Per capita income fell, and with it <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>living.</b> Perón’s third term of office was characterized by an expansive monetary policy, which resulted in an uncontrolled rise {{in the level of}} inflation.|$|E

5|$|The {{blockade}} of the South caused the Southern economy to collapse during the war. Shortages {{of food and}} supplies were caused by the blockade, the failure of Southern railroads, the loss of control of the main rivers, and foraging by Union and Confederate armies. <b>The</b> <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> fell even as large-scale printing of paper money caused inflation and distrust of the currency. By 1864 the internal food distribution had broken down, leaving cities without enough food and causing food riots across the Confederacy. The Union victory at the Second Battle of Fort Fisher in January 1865 closed the last useful Southern port, virtually ending blockade running and hastening {{the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|The natural {{resources}} of Devarakota are being exploited by Sashi, {{the brother of}} central minister Venkata Ratnam, whose tyranny has made many locals migrate {{to the city to}} seek a better life. Nevertheless, the village head Narayana Rao hopes that <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> will soon improve along with the general condition of the village. Meanwhile, Ratnam's son Radha uses blackmail to threaten harm to Ravikanth's family if he does not back out of a prestigious highway contract. Ravikanth's nephew Karthik, who hopes to succeed Ravikanth in the business empire, leaks to Radha details about an upcoming bid for the contract, which comes to the notice of Harsha. After subtly warning Ratnam at his residence in Delhi, Harsha secretly makes a lower bid on behalf of his father's company and wins the contract.|$|E

5|$|The {{period after}} {{the defeat of}} the Spanish Armada in 1588 brought new {{difficulties}} for Elizabeth that lasted until the end of her reign. The conflicts with Spain and in Ireland dragged on, the tax burden grew heavier, and the economy was hit by poor harvests and the cost of war. Prices rose and <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> fell. During this time, repression of Catholics intensified, and Elizabeth authorised commissions in 1591 to interrogate and monitor Catholic householders. To maintain the illusion of peace and prosperity, she increasingly relied on internal spies and propaganda. In her last years, mounting criticism reflected a decline in the public's affection for her.|$|E
5|$|Depopulation {{stemming}} from the Black Death led to increased wages, static food costs and a resulting improvement in <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> for the peasantry. However, under Henry misgovernment and harvest failures depressed the English economy to a pitiful state known as the Great Slump. The economy was in ruins by 1450, {{a consequence of the}} loss of France, piracy in the channel and poor trading relations with the Hanseatic League. The economic slowdown began in the 1430s in the north of the country, spreading south in the 1440s, with the economy not recovering until the 1480s. It was also driven by multiple harvest failures in the 1430s and disease amongst livestock, which drove up the price of food and damaged the wider economy. Certain groups were particularly badly affected: cloth exports fell by 35 per cent in just four years {{at the end of the}} 1440s, collapsing by up to 90 per cent in some parts of the South-West. The Crown's debts reached £372,000, Henry's deficit was £20,000 per annum, and tax revenues were half those of his father.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} few years, the new regime optimistically engaged in reform and {{experimentation}} {{and for the first}} time many Poles could afford to buy cars, televisions and other consumer goods. The authorities made sure that the workers received proper wages. The peasants had their compulsory deliveries abolished, were paid higher prices for their products and free health service was finally extended to rural, self-employed Poland. The intellectuals had censorship eased and Poles were able to travel to the West and maintain foreign contacts with little difficulty. Relations with the Polish emigrant communities were strengthened. There was some cultural and political relaxation and an improved freedom of speech environment, exercised for example by the respected weekly Polityka of the Polish party. Massive investments were made, expected to both improve <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> of the various segments of society and establish an internationally competitive Polish industry and agriculture, based on purchases of Western technology. The modernized manufacturing would result in a vastly expanded export of Polish-made products to the West, which in turn would generate hard currency to pay-off the debts.|$|E
50|$|In 1950, <b>the</b> UK <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> {{was higher}} than in any EEC country apart from Belgium.

In 1951, the average weekly earnings of men over the age of 21 stood at £8 6s 0d, and nearly doubled a decade later to £15 7s 0d. By 1966, average weekly earnings stood at £20 6s 0d. Between 1964 and 1968, the percentage of households with a television set rose from 80.5% to 85.5%, a washing machine from 54% to 63%, a refrigerator from 35% to 55%, a car from 38% to 49%, a telephone from 21.5% to 28%, and central heating from 13% to 23%.|$|R

5|$|Rajab {{was one of}} {{the founders}} of the first migrant workers {{protection}} committee in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, the Migrant Workers Protection Group (in 2003). On 28 April 2007, the Bahraini Parliament passed a law banning unmarried migrant workers from living in residential areas. BCHR issued a press release condemning this decision as discriminatory and promoting negative racist attitudes towards migrant workers. Rajab, then BCHR vice president, said: It is appalling that Bahrain is willing to rest on the benefits of these people’s hard work, and often their suffering, but that they refuse to live with them in equality and dignity. The solution is not to force migrant workers into ghettos, but to urge companies to improve living conditions for workers – and not to accommodate large numbers of workers in inadequate space, and to improve <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> for them.|$|E
5|$|These initial concerns, however, {{were short}} lived, {{at least in}} the {{beginning}} as the British government provided assurances that it would underwrite a large amount of the war risk insurance for shipping in order to allow trade amongst the Commonwealth to continue. Shortly thereafter the wartime direction of trade began when the British asked the Australian government to place certain restrictions upon overseas trade in order to secure resources vital to the war effort and to limit the ability of the Central Powers from obtaining these goods from Commonwealth nations via neutral third parties. To an extent these restrictions served to reduce the ability of Australian producers to find buyers for their products, at least initially, however, in many cases the British stepped in to buy these goods, thus alleviating Australian concerns about a significant reduction in <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>living.</b> This understanding proved particularly beneficial for the wool and wheat industries, where the British government undertook to buy Australian products even though the shortage of shipping meant that there was no chance that they would ever receive them.|$|E
5|$|The {{emergence}} of mining increased {{the migration of}} native African people in search of employment to the province from elsewhere in Africa. The mining industry improved <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> of those living along Northern Rhodesia's railroads, and increased the influx of white people, the Europeans from South Africa who wanted to maintain their superiority over the native African population. Native Africans were poorly treated by the whites and discouraged from working in the mines; this evolved into a racial struggle. The high rate of immigration to the region {{increased the number of}} unplanned settlements. The BSAC introduced a hut tax in 1901 in North-Eastern Rhodesia and between 1904 and 1913 in North-Western Rhodesia for all migrants. The tax was high (in some cases, six months' wages), and intended to create a system of debt bondage and generate income for investment in other mines. Unrest caused by tax increases was suppressed {{with the help of the}} British South Africa Police. The imposition of tax was a strategy adopted to create bond labour and sustain demand during the 1920s when the demand for miners was higher. The company was able to maintain low wages on account of predominance of migrant labour from rural regions. The African miners had three major issues: low wages compared to European miners, a prohibition against working in mines reserved for Europeans despite high skills, and workplace harassment and brutality.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{employs a}} number of models to examine whether the {{structural}} adjustment programmes of the World Bank have had any effect on <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> and human development indices in the treated countries.
