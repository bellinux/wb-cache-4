5|$|Harvey's {{departure}} at 294/5 {{brought the}} first of the bowlers, Johnson, to the crease. This did not deter Loxton, who was particularly severe on Laker, lifting the off spinner for four more sixes, two over the leg side followed by consecutive off drives into the gallery. On each occasion, umpire Chester walked {{to the edge of the}} playing field and tried to inspect where the ball landed amongst the crowd, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> the point of impact was beyond the original playing arena. They were ruled as sixes in any case and some thought Chester's actions to be more for theatrical than umpiring purposes. Laker refused to be deterred by the aggressive batting and continued to bowl normally by pursuing defensive off or leg theory. Johnson scored 10 before falling with the score at 329/6, hitting Laker to Cranston.|$|E
5|$|After lunch, Australia scored {{slowly as}} Loxton {{struggled}} {{to come to}} grips with the bowling. Yardley took the new ball in an attempt to trouble the batsmen, but instead, Loxton began to settle in as the ball came onto the bat more quickly. He lofted Pollard to the leg side, almost for six, and then hit three boundaries off another over from the same bowler. Harvey accelerated as well, and 80 minutes into the session, reached his century to a loud reception as Australia passed 250. On each occasion, umpire Frank Chester walked to the edge of the playing field and tried to inspect where the ball landed amongst the crowd, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> the point of impact was beyond the original playing arena. They were ruled as sixes in any case and some thought Chester’s actions to be more for theatrical than umpiring purposes. Loxton then dominated the scoring with a display of power hitting. He brought up his 50 by hitting Cranston into the pavilion for six, eliciting spontaneous applause from the English players. It also brought up a century stand, which yielded 105 in only 95 minutes. Harvey was out for 112 from 183 balls, but not before the high run rate during the partnership had helped to swing the match back from England's firm control.|$|E

Via Hiphop Wired, Joe revealed that he and Remy Ma are releasing a joint album. He said [...] "Me and Remy just wrapped up a new album. Just me and Remy. I’m super excited about that. The album is ridiculous.

2500|$|Myths {{are rated}} as [...] "Busted" [...] when the myth's results cannot be {{replicated}} under either the described parameters or reasonably exaggerated ones. Often, when a myth is declared Busted, {{the team will}} attempt {{to see what would}} be required to replicate the result of the myth through scientific means, discarding the original parameters of the myth itself. Going to absolute limits of what's physically possible to replicate the results is the origin of what is unofficially titled the Mythbusters motto, [...] "If it's worth doing, it's worth overdoing." [...] This is also commonly referred to in the series as [...] "the MythBusters way", and often reveals that the circumstances required to accurately recreate a 'Busted' myth are physically impossible or highly unlikely to occur with the scientific facts presented, or the equipment used in the myth used to gain the results is neither available to the general public, nor capable of producing the results. For example, when <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> diamonds can be made with a microwave, and the myth is busted, the team will arrange with an expert to have diamonds created with a large quantity of explosives.|$|E

He could raise fifteen thousand on his Nankeen Square house, and another fifteen on his Beacon Street lot, and this was all that a man who was worth a million by rights could do! He said a million, and he said it in defiance of Bellingham, who had subjected his figures to an analysis which wounded Lapham more than he chose to show at the time, for it proved that he was not so rich and not so wise as he had seemed. His hurt vanity forbade him to go to Bellingham now for help or advice; and if he could have brought himself to ask his brothers for money, it would have been useless; they were simply well-to-do Western people, but not capitalists on the scale he required.|$|E
