40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{seamless}} integration of high-frequency <b>test</b> <b>voltages</b> for IPMSM rotor-position estimation in the discrete-time current-controller with fixed sampling frequency of a voltage-source converter. Pulsed <b>test</b> <b>voltages</b> are used that don’t interfere with the current samples taken to control the phase currents. For this purpose, an asymmetric pulse-width modulator is applied. As {{a result of this}} strategy, the controller output influences the <b>test</b> <b>voltages</b> and consequently the current response from which the rotor position is estimated. Therefore, in this paper, a first strategy is studied in which the applied <b>test</b> <b>voltages</b> are computed taking into account the controller output. A second method is discussed as well in which the controller output is slightly delayed so that this output has no influence on the test signals. Despite the disadvantage of a small time delay, compared to the first method, no additional calculations are required to compute the <b>test</b> <b>voltages...</b>|$|R
