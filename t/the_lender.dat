5|$|Lord Wilberforce, in Quistclose, {{stated that}} the {{contract}} gives the moneylender an equitable interest in the loan. Under Wilberforce's two-stage trust, the interest in the money first goes from <b>the</b> <b>lender</b> to the borrower (the primary trust) and then, when the trust's purpose fails, reverses (the secondary trust). In Twinsectra Lord Millett also explained that a Quistclose trust is a resulting trust, but held that <b>the</b> <b>lender</b> retains the interest throughout the transaction, with no need for this interest to reverse if {{the purpose of the}} loan fails. The problem with Wilberforce's analysis, as explained by Alastair Hudson, Professor of Equity and Finance Law at the University of Exeter, is that because the resulting trust only comes into existence after the misuse of the loan, it may come too late; if the money is not available when the claim is brought, there is no remedy. The borrower may already have spent the money, or already be insolvent and the subject of claims by creditors.|$|E
5|$|Another flaw {{with both}} Wilberforce's and Millett's {{explanations}} {{is that if}} the interest is retained by <b>the</b> <b>lender</b> from the outset of the contract, it is not a resulting trust at all; the complete transfer of money should end the lender's equitable interest. It could be argued that the creation of a Quistclose trust is not based on the recovery of the original interest, but {{the creation of a new}} one. Doubts have also been raised about the Twinsectra case in general, in that the facts of the case did not create a stereotypical Quistclose trust; this causes problems with applying Millett's analysis.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} banks around the world, the Icelandic banks found it {{increasingly}} difficult or impossible to roll over their loans in the interbank market, their creditors insisting on payment while no other banks were willing to make fresh loans. In such a situation, a bank would normally {{have to ask for}} a loan from the central bank as <b>the</b> <b>lender</b> of last resort. However, in Iceland the banks were so much larger than the national economy that the Central Bank of Iceland and the Icelandic government could not guarantee the payment of the banks' debts, leading to the collapse of the banks. The official reserves of the Central Bank of Iceland stood at 374.8 billion krónur at the end of September 2008, compared with 350.3 billion krónur of short-term international debt in the Icelandic banking sector, and at least £6.5 billion (1,250 billion krónur) of retail deposits in the UK.|$|E

25|$|Like other ARMs, hybrid ARMs {{transfer}} some interest-rate {{risk from}} <b>the</b> <b>lender</b> to the borrower, thus allowing <b>the</b> <b>lender</b> {{to offer a}} lower note rate in many interest-rate environments.|$|E
25|$|Lenders {{argue that}} the real estate attorney's fee, for example, is a {{pass-through}} cost, not a cost of the lending. In effect, they are arguing that the attorney's fee is a separate transaction and {{not a part of}} the loan. Consumer advocates argue that this would be true if the customer is free to select which attorney is used. If <b>the</b> <b>lender</b> insists, however, on using a specific attorney, the cost should be looked at as a component of the total cost of doing business with that lender. This area is made more complicated by the practice of contingency fees – for example, when <b>the</b> <b>lender</b> receives money from the attorney and other agents to be the one used by <b>the</b> <b>lender.</b> Because of this, U.S. regulators require all lenders to produce an affiliated business disclosure form which shows the amounts paid between <b>the</b> <b>lender</b> and the appraisal firms, attorneys, etc.|$|E
25|$|An entity whose income exceeds its {{expenditure}} can lend or {{invest the}} excess income to help that excess income produce more {{income in the}} future. Though on the other hand, an entity whose income is less than its expenditure can raise capital by borrowing or selling equity claims, decreasing its expenses, or increasing its income. <b>The</b> <b>lender</b> can find a borrower—a financial intermediary such as a bank—or buy notes or bonds (corporate bonds, government bonds, or mutual bonds) in the bond market. <b>The</b> <b>lender</b> receives interest, the borrower pays a higher interest than <b>the</b> <b>lender</b> receives, and the financial intermediary earns the difference for arranging the loan.|$|E

25|$|Income {{tax refund}} {{anticipation}} loans are not technically payday loans (because they are repayable upon receipt of the borrower's income tax refund, not at his next payday), {{but they have}} similar credit and cost characteristics. A car title loan is secured by the borrower's car, but are available only to borrowers who hold clear title (i.e., no other loans) to a vehicle. The maximum amount of the loan is some fraction of the resale value of the car. A similar credit facility seen in the UK is a logbook loan secured against a car's logbook, which <b>the</b> <b>lender</b> retains. These loans may be available on slightly better terms than an unsecured payday loan, since they are less risky to <b>the</b> <b>lender.</b> If the borrower defaults, then <b>the</b> <b>lender</b> can attempt to recover costs by repossessing and reselling the car.|$|E
