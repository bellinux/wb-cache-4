5|$|About 6% {{of those}} with {{epilepsy}} have seizures that are often <b>triggered</b> by specific events and are known as reflex seizures. Those with reflex epilepsy have seizures that are only <b>triggered</b> by specific stimuli. Common triggers include flashing lights and sudden noises. In certain types of epilepsy, seizures happen more often during sleep, and in other types they occur almost only when sleeping.|$|E

2500|$|Double set <b>triggers</b> can {{be further}} {{classified}} by phase. [...] A double set, single phase <b>trigger</b> can only be operated by first pulling the set <b>trigger,</b> and then pulling the firing <b>trigger.</b> [...] A double set, double phase <b>trigger</b> can be operated as a standard <b>trigger</b> if the set <b>trigger</b> is not pulled, or as a set <b>trigger</b> by first pulling the set <b>trigger.</b> [...] Double set, double phase <b>triggers</b> offer the versatility of both a standard <b>trigger</b> and a set <b>trigger.</b>|$|R
50|$|If the <b>trigger</b> {{is created}} {{on a table}} or view, then the <b>triggering</b> event is {{composed}} of DML statements, and the <b>trigger</b> is called a DML <b>trigger.</b> If the <b>trigger</b> is created on a schema or the database, then the <b>triggering</b> event is composed of either DDL or database operation statements, and the <b>trigger</b> is called a system <b>trigger.</b>|$|R
2500|$|A single set <b>trigger</b> {{is usually}} one <b>trigger</b> {{that may be}} fired with a {{conventional}} amount of <b>trigger</b> pull weight or may be [...] "set" [...] – usually by pushing forward on the <b>trigger,</b> or by pushing forward on a small lever attached {{to the rear of}} the <b>trigger.</b> This takes up the <b>trigger</b> slack (or otherwise called take-up) in the <b>trigger</b> and allows for a much lighter <b>trigger</b> pull. This is colloquially known as a hair <b>trigger.</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Trigger</b> locks prevent {{motion of}} the <b>trigger.</b> However, a <b>trigger</b> lock does not {{guarantee}} that the firearm cannot be discharged (see above). Some <b>trigger</b> locks are integrated into {{the design of the}} weapon, requiring no external parts besides the key. Generally, two pieces come together from either side behind the <b>trigger</b> and are locked in place, which can be unlocked with a key or combination. This physically prevents the <b>trigger</b> from being pulled to discharge the weapon. Other types of <b>trigger</b> locks do not go behind the <b>trigger,</b> but encompass the full area behind the <b>trigger</b> guard making the <b>trigger</b> inaccessible. Identilock is a gun attachment that completely covers and prevents access to the <b>trigger,</b> which makes it different from other <b>trigger</b> locks.|$|R
50|$|IBM DB2 for {{distributed}} systems known as DB2 for LUW (LUW means Linux Unix Windows) supports three <b>trigger</b> types: Before <b>trigger,</b> After <b>trigger</b> and Instead of <b>trigger.</b> Both statement level and row level <b>triggers</b> are supported. If {{there are more}} <b>triggers</b> for same operation on table then firing order is determined by <b>trigger</b> creation data. Since version 9.7 IBM DB2 supports autonomous transactions.|$|R
50|$|An INSTEAD OF <b>trigger</b> is either: A DML <b>trigger</b> {{created on}} a view or a system <b>trigger</b> defined on a CREATE statement. The {{database}} fires the INSTEAD OF <b>trigger</b> {{instead of running}} the <b>triggering</b> statement.|$|R
5|$|The {{earthquake}} {{occurred as}} a result of normal faulting to the west of Iwaki and <b>triggered</b> numerous landslides across adjacent mountainous areas. A few fires broke out, and 220,000 households lost electricity. Officials issued localised tsunami alerts, though no significant waves were generated. The earthquake caused little structural damage, but killed four people and injured ten others. The strong ground movements <b>triggered</b> the reactivation of a nearby geological fault, prompting researchers to conduct extensive surveys in the region.|$|E

50|$|You {{create a}} <b>trigger</b> with the CREATE <b>TRIGGER</b> {{statement}}. You specify the <b>triggering</b> event {{in terms of}} <b>triggering</b> statements, and the item they act on. The <b>trigger</b> {{is said to be}} created on or defined on the item—which is either a table, a view, a schema, or the database. You also specify the timing point, which determines whether the <b>trigger</b> fires before or after the <b>triggering</b> statement runs and whether it fires for each row that the <b>triggering</b> statement affects.|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} is investigated of {{a dedicated}} <b>trigger</b> stream in the CMS <b>trigger</b> menu, with an output rate of cal O (1) ~kHz on the First Level <b>Trigger</b> and cal O (1) ~Hz on the High Level <b>Trigger.</b> By combining jet <b>trigger</b> {{information from the}} CMS calorimeter with information from the TOTEM Roman Pot detectors at 220 m distance from the interaction point, the default dijet <b>trigger</b> thresholds foreseen in the CMS <b>trigger</b> tables can be lowered substantially while respecting the CMS <b>trigger</b> bandwidth limits. The efficacy of the dedicated diffractive <b>trigger</b> stream is demonstrated for hard single-diffractive and double-Pomeron exchange events...|$|R
40|$|The {{contributions}} to the <b>trigger</b> rate of an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope and the optimization of the <b>trigger</b> conditions are discussed. Among the <b>trigger</b> options studied are cameras with <b>trigger</b> regions of different sizes, <b>triggers</b> requiring a coincidence of 2, 3 and 4 pixels as well as <b>triggers</b> imposing additional conditions on topology of the <b>trigger</b> pixels. A two-pixel <b>trigger</b> based on neighboring <b>trigger</b> pixels is shown to provide full efficiency, at considerably reduced random <b>trigger</b> rates. Numerical examples of effective areas and rates are given based on {{the parameters of the}} new HEGRA Cherenkov telescopes.

50|$|Before <b>trigger</b> is for {{checking}} {{data and}} deciding if operation should be permitted. If exception is thrown from before <b>trigger</b> then operation is aborted and no data are changed. In DB2 before <b>triggers</b> are read only — you can't modify data in before <b>triggers.</b> After <b>triggers</b> {{are designed for}} post processing after requested change was performed. After <b>triggers</b> can write data into tables and unlike some other databases you can write into any table including table on which <b>trigger</b> operates. Instead of <b>triggers</b> are for making views writeable.|$|R
50|$|<b>Triggers</b> {{are fully}} {{supported}} {{and can be}} attached to tables. <b>Triggers</b> can be per-column and conditional, in that UPDATE <b>triggers</b> can target specific columns of a table, and <b>triggers</b> can be told to execute under a set of conditions as specified in the <b>trigger's</b> WHERE clause. <b>Triggers</b> can be attached to views by using the INSTEAD OF condition. Multiple <b>triggers</b> are fired in alphabetical order. In addition to calling functions written in the native PL/pgSQL, <b>triggers</b> can also invoke functions written in other languages like PL/Python or PL/Perl.|$|R
40|$|A fast {{tracking}} <b>trigger</b> {{system based}} on a new scintillating fiber tracker is being built for the upgraded D 0 detector for the Collider Run II at Fermilab.

Particularly, PLD (Programmable Logical Device) chips are used to implement our <b>trigger</b> algorithms to achieve pattern recognition from scintillating fiber hits and to format that information for delivery to other <b>trigger</b> systems. Detector <b>trigger</b> efficiency studies will also be presented...|$|R
5|$|Because {{ovulation}} is {{not always}} <b>triggered</b> by a single mating, females may not be impregnated by the first male with which they mate. Furthermore, cats are superfecund; that is, a female may mate {{with more than one}} male when she is in heat, with the result that different kittens in a litter may have different fathers.|$|E
5|$|Beddard's Animal Coloration {{is cited}} and {{discussed}} both by historians of science, and by practising scientists {{from a number}} of different fields.

40|$|Timer-Driven <b>Triggers</b> allow {{users to}} monitor {{interesting}} tuples or interesting changes to tuples of a view. <b>Trigger</b> condition testing takes place periodically, i. e., once every few hours, days or weeks. When the timer of a <b>trigger</b> expires, a new {{copy of the}} view is retrieved and the <b>trigger</b> predicates applied to that view. <b>Trigger</b> predicates could be transition predicates referring to the attribute values of tuples of {{a view from the}} previous timer expiration.

However, many <b>triggers</b> require TP, <b>Trigger</b> Points, earned in battle. These <b>triggers</b> can cue many things, from battles, to event scenes and free items.|$|R
40|$|One of the {{obstacles}} that hinder database <b>trigger</b> systems from their wide deployment {{is the lack of}} tools that aid users in creating <b>trigger</b> rules. Similar to understanding and specifying database queries in SQL 3, it is di#cult to visualize the meaning of <b>trigger</b> rules. Furthermore, it is even more di#cult to write <b>trigger</b> rules using such text-based <b>trigger</b> rule language as SQL 3. In this paper, we propose TBE (Trigger-By-Example) to remedy such problems in writing <b>trigger</b> rules visually by using QBE (Query-By-Example) ideas. TBE is a visual <b>trigger</b> rule composition system that helps the users understand and specify active database <b>triggers.</b> TBE retains benefits of QBE while extending features to support <b>triggers.</b> Hence, TBE is a useful tool for novice users to create simple <b>triggers</b> in a visual and intuitive manner. Further, since TBE is designed to hide the details of underlying <b>trigger</b> systems from users, it {{can be used as a}} universal <b>trigger</b> interface...|$|R

50|$|A new {{development}} are digital delay generators that have gating and external <b>triggering,</b> dual or multi-trigger capabilities. The gate allows {{the user to}} enable outputs and/or <b>triggers</b> with an electronic signal. Some units have gate or <b>trigger</b> capabilities using a single or separate connectors. Dual or multi-trigger digital delay generators have several input <b>triggers.</b> These <b>triggers</b> can be selectively used to <b>trigger</b> any or all channels.|$|R
50|$|The takeup is {{the least}} {{critical}} stage of the <b>trigger</b> pull, and individual preferences vary widely. Two-stage <b>triggers,</b> for example, consist of a noticeable takeup, followed by a distinct increase in the force required to pull the <b>trigger,</b> followed by the break. A single-stage <b>trigger,</b> on the other hand, has no discernible movement before the break. Fully adjustable <b>triggers</b> will provide a two-stage pull, and the option of reducing the first stage travel to zero, essentially making the <b>trigger</b> a single-stage <b>trigger.</b>|$|R
50|$|While {{the most}} common problem {{adapting}} flash equipment to cameras is an excessive <b>trigger</b> voltage, sometimes the <b>trigger</b> circuit voltages provided by some modern flashes or radio <b>triggers</b> can also be too low {{to ensure that the}} electronic <b>triggering</b> circuits in the camera or receiver can still reliable <b>trigger</b> it. <b>Trigger</b> circuit voltages below ca. 2 to 2.5 volts may exhibit this problem, unless the <b>triggering</b> circuit is specifically designed to continue to work with such low voltages as well.|$|R
