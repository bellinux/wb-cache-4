5|$|Details {{about the}} {{religious}} life in Qatna {{are not available}} due to the rarity of written evidence from the city; in general, many cults seems to have existed and mixed in Qatna, most prominently the royal ancestor cult, <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> gods and <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> the dead.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> Saint Andrew {{may have}} come to Pictland from Northumbria, as had <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> Saint Peter which had been favoured by Nechtan, and in {{particular}} from the monastery at Hexham which was dedicated to Saint Andrew. This apparent connection with the Northumbrian church may have left a written record. Óengus, like his successors and possible kinsmen Caustantín and Eógan, is recorded prominently in the Liber Vitae Ecclesiae Dunelmensis, a list of some 3000 benefactors for whom prayers were said in religious institutions connected with Durham.|$|E
5|$|Bhattacharya {{links the}} archaeological discoveries of Indus valley civilization to present-day Shaktism of later Hindu religion.

5|$|Conspiracy theorists {{concerned}} with surveillance abuse {{believe that the}} New World Order is being implemented by <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> intelligence {{at the core of}} the surveillance-industrial complex through mass surveillance and the use of Social Security numbers, the bar-coding of retail goods with Universal Product Code markings, and, most recently, RFID tagging by microchip implants.|$|E
5|$|Hence, the Pyramid Texts of {{the pyramid}} of Unas {{incorporate}} instructions for ritual actions and words to be spoken, suggesting that they were precisely those performed and recited during <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> the king in his mortuary temple.|$|E
5|$|Iravan, {{also known}} as Iravat and Iravant, is a minor {{character}} from the Hindu epic of Mahabharata. The son of Pandava prince Arjuna (one of the main heroes of the Mahabharata) and the Naga princess Ulupi, Iravan is the central deity of <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> Kuttantavar {{which is also the}} name commonly given to him in that cult—and {{plays a major role in}} <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> Draupadi. Both these cults are of Tamil origin, from a region of the country where he is worshipped as a village deity and is known as Aravan. He is also a patron god of well-known transgender communities called ThiruNangai (also Aravani in Tamil, and Hijra throughout South Asia).|$|E

5|$|Only in tales {{associated}} with <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> Shakta (in which the Goddess {{is considered the}} Supreme Being) is the Goddess venerated as the Maker of All. In these tales, it is her body (not Shiva's) which splits into male and female halves.|$|E
5|$|The first {{hypothesis}} {{is that this is}} due to a change of ideology. The advent of the 5th dynasty marks the growing importance of <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> the sun as hinted by the Westcar Papyrus. This is also directly evidenced by the large sun temples built at Abusir throughout the dynasty, a tradition initiated by Userkaf. Finally, the Abusir Papyri demonstrate the strong connection between <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> the sun and the mortuary cult of the pharaohs of this dynasty: offerings for a deceased ruler were first consecrated in a sun temple before being dispatched to his mortuary temple. Thus, Userkaf located his mortuary temple to the south of the main pyramid so that the sun would shine directly into it all year round.|$|E
5|$|The {{persistence}} of <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> Menkauhor {{during the late}} Eighteenth to Nineteenth Dynasty possibly results from the location of his pyramid, which stood {{on the way to}} the necropolis of the Apis bulls, which later became the Serapeum.|$|E

50|$|Both anti-communists and communists {{have criticized}} <b>the</b> {{personality}} <b>cults</b> <b>of</b> many communist rulers, especially <b>the</b> <b>cults</b> <b>of</b> Stalin, Mao, Fidel Castro and Kim Il-sung. In {{the case of}} North Korea, <b>the</b> personality <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> Kim Il-sung was associated with inherited leadership, with the succession of Kim's son Kim Jong-il in 1994 and grandson Kim Jong-un in 2011. Cuban communists have also been criticized for planning an inherited leadership, with the succession of Raúl Castro following his brother's illness in mid-2006.|$|R
5|$|A libertinus was not {{entitled}} to hold public office or the highest state priesthoods, but he could play a priestly role in <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> the emperor. He could not marry a woman {{from a family of}} senatorial rank, nor achieve legitimate senatorial rank himself, but during the early Empire, freedmen held key positions in the government bureaucracy, so much so that Hadrian limited their participation by law. Any future children of a freedman would be born free, with full rights of citizenship.|$|E
5|$|Although {{certain forms}} of dance were disapproved of at times as non-Roman or unmanly, dancing was {{embedded}} in religious rituals of archaic Rome, {{such as those of}} the dancing armed Salian priests and of the Arval Brothers, priesthoods which underwent a revival during the Principate. Ecstatic dancing was a feature of the international mystery religions, particularly <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> Cybele as practised by her eunuch priests the Galli and of Isis. In the secular realm, dancing girls from Syria and Cadiz were extremely popular.|$|E
5|$|Another {{earthquake}} hit Sidon around 570 AD; Antoninus of Piacenza, an Italian Christian pilgrim, {{described the}} city as partly in ruins. For many years after the disappearance of <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> Eshmun, the sanctuary site {{was used as a}} quarry: Emir Fakhr-al-Din II, for example, used its massive blocks to build a bridge over the Awali river in the 17th century.|$|E

5|$|Back at Rome, Tiberius instituted the Sodales Augustales, a priesthood of <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> Augustus which Germanicus {{became a}} member of. When news arrived of his raid, Tiberius commemorated his {{services}} in the Senate with elaborate, but insincere praise: the proceedings gave him joy that the mutiny had been suppressed, but anxiety at the glory and popularity afforded to Germanicus. The Senate, in absence of Germanicus, voted {{that he should be}} given a triumph. Ovid's Fasti dates the Senate vote of Germanicus' triumph to 1 January AD 15.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} as {{archbishop}} there was a dispute with the monks of Christ Church Priory in Canterbury, who resented Baldwin's attempts to impose stricter control over them and disputed the legitimacy of Baldwin's election. For his part, Baldwin did not approve of the luxurious and pampered life the monks of Christ Church lived, and felt that they profited too much from <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> Thomas Becket.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{tradition}} which started with Userkaf, {{the founder of}} the Fifth Dynasty, Menkauhor built a temple to the sun god Ra. He was the last pharaoh to do so. His successors, Djedkare Isesi and Unas, abandoned this practice as <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> Ra declined at the expense of that of Osiris. Given the paucity of documents relating to Menkauhor's sun temple, it probably functioned for only a short time or was never completed.|$|E
