The most important thermal properties include thermal conductivity and resistance, as well as water vapour permeability. Sportswear often becomes wet (from sweat or due to a humid environment), which can have a signifi cant effect on thermal properties, while most testing methods only perform measurements in a dry state. This paper therefore presents our study of the thermal properties of different types of knitted fabrics in both dry and wet states. The presented research proved that wet knitwear results in a signifi cant loss of thermal comfort. This phenomenon is exacerbated when the moisture content of a material increases, and depends on the structure and filling of tested materials...|$|R

30|$|Jute fibre is {{the most}} {{important}} cash crop and the biggest foreign exchange earner of Bangladesh.

50|$|There were 217 {{cases of}} poliomyelitis, {{including}} 11 deaths, in 1945. A census in 1946 showed 4,748 inhabitants {{lived on the}} island. In 1948 there were seven deaths from whooping cough and 77 hospital admissions from acute nephritis. In 1951, mumps attacked 90% of the population. Solomon’s became a limited company the same year. Flax prices continued to rise after the war, rising to their zenith in 1951. However, this St Helena staple industry fell into decline because of competition <b>from</b> <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibres</b> and also because the delivered price of the island’s flax was substantially higher than world prices. The decision by a major buyer, the British Post Office, to use <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibres</b> for their mailbags was a major blow, all of which contributed in {{the closure of the}} island's flax mills in 1965. Many acres of land are still covered with flax plants. A census in 1956 showed the population had fallen only slightly, to 4,642. 1957 witnessed the arrival of three Bahrain princes as prisoners of Britain, who remained until released by a writ of habeas corpus in 1960. Another attempt to cooperate a fish cannery led to closure in 1957. From 1958, the Union Castle shipping line gradually reduced their service calls to the island. The same year, there were 36 cases of poliomyelitis. A census in 1966 showed a relatively unchanged population of 4,649 inhabitants.|$|R

[...] Production became difficult during the Second World War and was finally halted. However, {{within a few months}} of the end of hostilities, manufacturing restarted although full output was not attained until 1948 when the import of raw silk was again permitted. Alfred Pielenz was responsible for a major building extension programme during the post-war years.

40|$|The {{association}} between occupational exposure to airway irritants and {{the prevalence of}} chronic respiratory symptoms and level of lung function, and whether these associations were modified by airway hyperresponsiveness, smoking, {{and a history of}} allergy were studied in 668 workers <b>from</b> <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibre</b> plants. Respiratory symptoms were recorded with a self administered Dutch version of the British Medical Research Council questionnaire, with additional questions on allergy. Airway responsiveness was measured by a 30 second tidal breathing histamine challenge test.

Workers exposed to airway irritants were not simultaneously exposed to airborne dust. Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), defined as a 20 % fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) at 10 years of exposure had a lower FEV 1 (beta = - 295 and - 358 ml) and significantly lower MMEF (beta = - 1080 and - 1247 ml/s; p < 0. 05) than the reference group.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to provide {{independent}} research and evaluate manufacturers’ claims that structural polypropylene fibres provide satisfactory crack control reinforcement and compare the test results <b>from</b> macro <b>synthetic</b> polypropylene <b>fibres</b> against steel fabric reinforced concrete, extensively used as a crack control medium in concrete ground bearing floor/hardstanding slabs where tensile forces are likely to occur. Three concrete beam types were produced, plain, steel reinforced and fibre reinforced, and a comparative study was undertaken of post crack flexural toughness. The procedure used was to manufacture steel A 142 fabric and macro fibre reinforced concrete beams to provide load, deflection data, toughness indices and was compliant with, ASTM C 1018 - 97, [ASTM, 1997] using a three point loading arrangement. The data was representative of what might occur in a floor slab. The findings of the paper is that A 1 42 steel fabric reinforcement as used in slabs was more effective in producing toughness and residual strength when directly compared {{to the performance of}} structural polypropylene fibre reinforced concrete. When small post crack forces are encountered within the concrete matrix, polypropylene macro fibres are suitable for crack control.

40|$|Natural fibres {{have emerged}} as {{potential}} reinforcement materials for composite structure and have gained interests by many researchers due to their lightweight and low cost when compared to synthetics <b>fibres.</b> Substitution materials <b>from</b> <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibre</b> to natural fibre have become a trend in recent years. Kenaf fibres have {{become one of the}} best candidates to be used as reinforcing materials in polymer composite. However, the adhesion between natural fibre and polymer is weak due to different polarity of natural fibre and hydrophobic polymer. This causes low mechanical properties of the composite. Therefore, in this research the fibre is treated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in order to improve the fibre-matrix adhesion. On top of that, nanosilica particles and glass fibre were also added into the kenaf composite in order to further improve its mechanical properties. This study focuses on the effect of fibre treatment, addition of nanosilica and glass fibre hybridization on tensile properties of kenaf composites. Morphological examination and physical characterization on kenaf and its composites were also conducted. Three different concentrations of sodium hydroxide which are 3, 5 and 7 wt. % were used to soak the natural fibre {{in order to determine the}} suitable concentration of sodium hydroxide. The longitudinal and transverse tensile properties of 3, 5 and 7 wt. % NaOH treated kenaf composites were compared. The results showed that the 7 wt. % NaOH treated kenaf fibre composite has the highest longitudinal and transverse tensile strength. Therefore, 7 wt. % NaOH treated kenaf composites was selected to be impregnated with 3 different percentages of nanosilica (5, 13, 25 wt. %). Longitudinal and transverse tensile tests were conducted on the nanosilica filled kenaf composite. In addition, in order to improve the properties of kenaf composite, it was hybridized with glass fibre. The results showed that the additional of 5 wt. % of nanosilica in kenaf composite improved 29. 73 % of the longitudinal tensile modulus when compared to the pure system. However, a slight decreased in longitudinal tensile strength was recorded. The addition of 13 and 25 wt. % of nanosilica in kenaf composite showed an adverse effect of longitudinal tensile modulus. This may be due to a weak fibrematrix interfacial adhesion because of the presence of nanosilica particles hindered the wetting process of the natural fibre in the matrix. The SEM micrographs showed the evidence of weak interfacial adhesion where fibre pull out and matrix cracking were observed on the fractured specimens. This research contributes to a new knowledge on the effects of fibre treatment, nanosilica inclusion and glass hybridization on tensile properties, morphological and physical properties of kenaf composites...|$|R
