25|$|The largest truss roof by span {{covered the}} Aula Regia (throne room) built for emperor Domitian (81–96AD) on the Palatine Hill, Rome. The timber truss roof had a width of 31.67m, {{slightly}} surpassing the postulated limit of 30m for Roman roof constructions. <b>Tie-beam</b> trusses allowed for much larger spans than the older prop-and-lintel system and even concrete vaulting: Nine {{out of the}} ten largest rectangular spaces in Roman architecture were bridged this way, the only exception being the groin vaulted Basilica of Maxentius.|$|E

The door and window openings are made of Bishops Lydeard stone. The exact dates of the building are disputed, but is argued {{to be from the}} late 15th or early 16th century, and replacing an earlier 13th or 14th-century building on the site, but incorporating some of the earlier building. It was a Scheduled Ancient Monument until 1999 when it was descheduled. The building was once used as a chapel by Frenchmen, possibly prisoners during the French Revolutionary Wars or Napoleonic Wars.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the medieval}} origins are now {{obscured}} behind a modern façade, substantial {{parts of the}} timber-framed original open hall-house layout remain inside. [...] The oldest {{part of the building}} is the north–south range, parallel to the High Street. [...] This has a gigantic <b>tie-beam</b> holding up a king post ceiling. [...] The king post's structure includes purlins, chamfers and decorative mouldings. [...] This façade has three modern gable ends and a tiled upper storey. [...] Around the corner, facing Broadwalk, there is a twin-gabled modern façade, again with a tile-hung first floor and a stucco-faced ground floor. [...] This part is a modern extension. [...] At the northern end, there is another original wing running west to east: it has substantial timberwork with chamfering, visible from one of the bars.|$|E

40|$|The {{simulation}} of the behaviour of the rebar-concrete bond is of primary importance for an accurate description of cracking processes in reinforced concrete structures and an improved prediction of their durability. In this paper, the methodology {{used to identify}} the mechanical behaviour of a rebar-concrete bond {{in the case of}} a particular steel reinforcement is first mentioned. The methodology consists in simulating the probabilistic mechanical behaviour of RC <b>tie-beams</b> (170 x 10 x 10 cm), subjected to tension, using a probabilistic approach for the mechanical behaviour of the concrete and a deterministic model for the concrete/rebar bond. The <b>tie-beams</b> are reinforced by a flat steel rebar with a rectangular cross section (25 x 3. 5 mm) ...|$|R

6000|$|GIORGIO MAGGIORE, CHURCH OF ST. A {{building}} which {{owes its}} interesting [...] effect chiefly to its isolated position, being seen over a great space [...] of lagoon. The traveller should especially notice in its façade the [...] {{manner in which}} the central Renaissance architects (of whose style [...] this church is a renowned example) endeavored to fit the laws they had [...] established to the requirements of their age. Churches were required [...] with aisles and clerestories, that is to say, with a high central nave [...] and lower wings; and the question was, how to face this form with [...] pillars of one proportion. The noble Romanesque architects built story [...] above story, as at Pisa and Lucca; but the base Palladian architects [...] dared not do this. They must needs retain some image of the Greek [...] temple; but the Greek temple was all of one height, a low gable roof [...] being borne on ranges of equal pillars. So the Palladian builders [...] raised first a Greek temple with pilasters for shafts; and, through [...] the middle of its roof, or horizontal beam, that is to say, of the [...] cornice which externally represented this beam, they lifted another [...] temple on pedestals, adding these barbarous appendages to the shafts, [...] which otherwise would not have been high enough; fragments of the [...] divided cornice or <b>tie-beam</b> being left between the shafts, and the [...] great door of the church thrust in between the pedestals. It is [...] impossible to conceive a design more gross, more barbarous, more [...] childish in conception, more servile in plagiarism, more insipid in [...] result, more contemptible under every point of rational regard.|$|E

The bell openings and west doorway to the tower are moulded. Inside, nave has four-bay arcades of pointed arches chamfered in two orders. The columns have foliated capitals and are of four clustered shafts, except for the eastern bay, which is wider and is separated from the others by a round column. The nave roof trusses have <b>tie-beams,</b> king-posts rising to the ridge, and arch-braces rising from the <b>tie-beams</b> to meet the king-posts below the ridge. The chancel arch is moulded. Between the south chapel and the chancel is a three-bay arcade with round piers and foliated capitals.|$|R

The studs form the jambs of the doorway between the rooms and are jointed at the base into an upper cross-beam that provided support for the original garret floor (and by extension, the ceiling of the chamber below). At the top, the studs are jointed into the collar that links, in the usual manner, the principal rafter pair.|$|E
