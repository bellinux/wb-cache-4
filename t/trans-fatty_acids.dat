40|$|Serum lipoprotein[a] (Lp[a]) is {{a strong}} risk factor for {{coronary}} heart disease. We therefore examined the effect of dietary fatty acid composition on serum Lp[a] levels in three strictly controlled experiments with healthy normocholesterolemic men and women. In Expt. I, 58 subjects consumed a control diet high in saturated fatty acids for 17 days. For the next 36 days, 6. 5 % of total energy intake from saturated fatty acids was replaced by monounsaturates plus polyunsaturates (monounsaturated fatty acid diet; n = 29) or by polyunsaturates alone (polyunsaturated fatty acid diet; n = 29). Both diets caused a slight, nonsignificant, increase in median Lp[a] levels, with no difference between diets. In Expt. II, 10 % of energy from the cholesterol-raising saturated fatty acids (lauric, myristic, and palmitic acid) was replaced by oleic acid or by trans-monounsaturated fatty acids. Each of the 59 participants received each diet for 3 weeks in random order. The median level of Lp[a] was 26 mg/l on the saturated fatty acid diet; it increased to 32 mg/l (P less than 0. 020) on the oleic acid diet and to 45 mg/l (P less than 0. 001) on the <b>trans-fatty</b> <b>acid</b> diet.

Published in 1973 and including his critique of Keys's work, Raymond Reiser found methodological and interpretational errors in a review of forty feeding trials of the relationship between saturated fat and circulating lipoproteins, notably confounding with <b>trans-fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> Ahrens found separately with Margaret Albrink that triglycerides mattered in coronary disease more than total cholesterol, and came to think that carbohydrates cause heart disease and not fats. George V. Mann, writing in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) in 1977, dismissed Keys's 1953 Mt. Sinai address about the ecologic correlation of diet fat and coronary disease as exhibiting [...] "naïveté ... that is now a classroom demonstration." [...] (On the other hand, although he is widely misquoted to this day (for example in Breitbart), Mann did [...] say that the lipid theory is [...] "the greatest scam in the history of medicine"). Mann studied the mainly meat diet of Alaskan Eskimos, Congolese pygmies, and the Maasai of Tanzania and Kenya, and thought other factors like lack of exercise were responsible for heart disease. Yet contrary to Mann's assertion that despite wide official recommendations for dietary change “the heart disease (CHD) epidemic continues unabated, cholesteremia in the population is unchanged, and clinicians are unconvinced of efficacy”, in fact the age-specific CHD death rate in the United States had by that time been on a steady 3% annual decline since the late 1960s.|$|E

40|$|Solid fats {{are used}} in food {{manufacturing}} to provide texture and firmness to foods. Such fats are rich in either saturated or <b>trans-fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> both of which {{increase the risk of}} coronary heart disease. Epidemiological and experimental studies suggest that <b>trans-fatty</b> <b>acids</b> increase risk more than do saturates because they lower serum high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. However, there appear to be differences between saturates in their effect on HDL cholesterol. We investigated whether the consumption of a solid fat rich in lauric acid (C 12 : 0) would result in a more favorable blood lipid profile than the consumption of a solid fat rich in <b>trans-fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> We fed 32 healthy men and women two controlled diets in a 2 x 4 -wk randomized crossover design. The diets consisted of a background diet supplemented with margarines. In the trans-diet, 9. 2 ␘f energy was provided by <b>trans-fatty</b> <b>acids</b> and 12. 9 ␋y saturated fatty acids. In the Sat-diet, energy intake was 0 ␏rom <b>trans-fatty</b> <b>acids</b> and 22. 9 ␏rom saturated fatty acids. Lauric acid composed one third of all saturates in the Sat-diet. Serum HDL cholesterol was 0. 36 mmol/L lower {{at the end of the}} trans-diet than at the end of the Sat-diet (95 ␌onfidence interval, - 0. 46 to - 0. 26), whereas serum low density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations remained stable. Serum total cholesterol was 0. 31 mmol/L (95 ␌onfidence interval, - 0. 48 to - 0. 14) lower at the end of the trans-diet than at the end of the Sat-diet. Consumption of a solid fat rich in lauric acid gives a more favorable serum lipoprotein pattern than consumption of partially hydrogenated soybean oil rich in <b>trans-fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> Thus, solid fats rich in lauric acids, such as tropical fats, appear to be preferable to trans-fats in food manufacturing, where hard fats are indispensable...|$|E

Elaidic acid is readily incorporated into membrane lipids in vivo and therefore affects processes regulating membrane physical properties. In this study the membrane properties of sphingomyelin and phosphatidylcholine containing elaidic acid (N-E-SM and PEPC) were determined in bilayer membranes with special emphasis on their interaction with cholesterol and participation in ordered domain formation. In agreement with previous studies the melting temperatures {{were found to be}} about 20  °C lower for the elaidoyl than for the corresponding saturated lipids. The trans-unsaturation increased the polarity at the membrane–water interface as reported by Laurdan fluorescence. Fluorescence quenching experiments using cholestatrienol as a probe showed that both N-E-SM and PEPC were incorporated in lateral membrane domains with sterol and saturated lipids. At low temperatures the elaidoyl lipids were even able to form sterol-rich domains without any saturated lipids present in the bilayer. We conclude from this study that the ability of N-E-SM and PEPC to form ordered domains together with cholesterol and saturated phospho- and sphingolipids in model membranes indicates that they might have an influence on raft formation in biological membranes...|$|R

40|$|The National Food Agency {{carried out}} a survey in 2007 to {{determine}} the fatty acid composition {{in a range of}} cookies, biscuits, sweets and pop corn. The aim of the project was to determine the levels of fatty acids in these products and to follow the trends in fatty acid profile of selected products from 1998 - 2008. Fiftythree samples were analysed. The fatty acid profile of the products from 2007 was compared to the fatty acid profile of the same or similar products analysed 1998, 2004 and 2008. In general the levels of <b>trans-fatty</b> <b>acids</b> have decreased since 1998 and the proportion of saturated fatty acids, and in some products polyunsaturated fatty acids, have increased. The most frequent saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids are palmitic acid (16 : 0) and linoleic acid (18 : 2 n 6), respectively. Total fat content did not change over the years. Even if <b>trans-fatty</b> <b>acids</b> have decreased levels higher than two percent (of total fatty acids) were detected in six of the fiftythree analysed products. In those products the ingredients containing <b>trans-fatty</b> <b>acids</b> have been exchanged for products rich in mainly saturated fatty acids after communication with the producer...|$|E
40|$|Trans-fatty acid {{consumption}} {{has been}} reported as {{a risk factor for}} metabolic disorders and targeted organ damages. Nonetheless, {{little is known about the}} roles and mechanisms of <b>trans-fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in obesity, insulin resistance (IR) and hepatic steatosis. Adult C 57 BL/ 6 male mice were fed with four different diets for 20 weeks: normal diet (ND), high fat diet (HFD), low <b>trans-fatty</b> <b>acids</b> diet (LTD) and high trans-fatty acid diet (HTD). The diet-induced metabolic disorders were assessed by evaluating body weight, glucose tolerance test, hepatic steatosis and plasma lipid profiles post 20 -week diet. Histological (H&E, Oil-Red-O) staining and western blot analysis were employed to assess liver steatosis and potential signaling pathways. After 20 -weeks of diet, the body weights of the four groups were 29. 61 ± 1. 89 g (ND), 39. 04 ± 4. 27 g (HFD), 34. 09 ± 2. 62 g (LTD) and 43. 78 ± 4. 27 g (HTD) (p < 0. 05), respectively. HFD intake significantly impaired glucose tolerance, which was impaired further in the mice consuming the HTD diet. The effect was further exacerbated by HTD diet. Moreover, the HTD group exhibited significantly more severe liver steatosis compared with HFD group possibly through regulating adipose triglyceride lipase. The group consuming the HTD also exhibited significantly reduced levels of IRS 1, phosphor-PKC and phosphor-AKT. These results support our hypothesis that consumption of a diet high in <b>trans-fatty</b> <b>acids</b> induces higher rates of obesity, IR and hepatic steatosis in male C 57 BL/ 6 mice, possibly by suppressing the IRS 1 dependent pathway...|$|E
40|$|Non-communicable {{diseases}} (NCDs) are {{the leading}} cause of death globally. Of the 57 million global deaths in 2008, 36 million (63 %) were due to NCDs, principally cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancers, and chronic respiratory diseases. The poor dietary quality (in particular, high salt intake, high saturated and <b>trans-fatty</b> <b>acid</b> intake, and low fruit and vegetable consumption) and insufficient physical activity are key risk factors for NCD development and mortality worldwide and are considered priority areas for international action. Among the 340 study subjects who contributed for their investigations were included in this study 282 (82. 9 %) were females. The majority of 202 (52. 9 %) were from age of 30 - 49 years which are the years of social and economical productivity. Majority 228 (67. 5 %) were from socioeconomic status (SES II & III) which is a essential feature of urban life. Prevalence of tobacco use was 14. 41 % and of alcohol was 3. 8 %. Physical inactivity was reported by 61. 1 %. Only 27. 4 % and 22. 1 % of subjects were consuming adequate portions of fruits and vegetables respectively. Prevalenceof obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and hypothyroidism was 57. 64 % 4, 38 %, 2. 9 % and 20 % respectively...|$|R
40|$|Background: Low {{attention}} to dairy product consumptions and high intake of junk foods and bakery products might {{be related to}} high prevalence of chronic diseases because of their fat content and fatty acid composition. Objective: In this study we investigated the kind and amount of fatty acid content in Iranian junk foods, dairy, and bakery products Materials and Methods: Some common brands of Iranian′s junk foods, dairy, and bakery products were chosen randomly from different supermarkets in Iran. The amount of 10 g sample was considered for fatty acid analysis by gas chromatography equipment with flam ionization detector. Results: In this study stearic acid (C 18 : 0) and palmitic (C 16 : 0) acid have the highest amount among other saturated fatty acids in all groups. In junk foods and bakery products, the most common <b>trans-fatty</b> <b>acid</b> (TFA) is elaidic acid (C 18 : 1 9 t) with ranging from 2. 4 % to 18. 5 % and in dairy products vaccinic acid (C 18 : 1 11 t) has the high level of TFAs among others (2. 1 % to 11. 5 %). Conclusion: The amount of TFAs in Iranian junk foods and bakery products was in a high level...|$|R
40|$|Cancer cells invade {{surrounding}} {{tissues and}} metastasize to distant sites. Diet {{high in fat}} is a strong link to, and perhaps causes, {{a high incidence of}} tumours. <b>Trans-fatty</b> <b>acid</b> might impair the function and it could be involved in the development of cancer. Cholesterol is also strongly suspected {{to be involved in the}} development of tumours, therefore it is important for everyone to eat well, especially for people with cancer to prevent the body tissues from breaking down and helping to rebuild the normal tissue that may have been affected by the treatments. Factors secreted by adipocytes and macrophages such as TNF-alpha and other inflammatory proteins are involved in inflammation in cancer. In addition, MCSF which up-regulates adipocyte tissue is also important for the stimulation of fat cell proliferation and is expressed by human adipocytes. Many cytokines, such as IL- 1, IL- 6, IL- 8, IL- 32, IL- 33 and MCP- 1, are biomarkers for cancer and chronic diseases along with transcription factors NFkB and AP- 1; these last two factors are important bioactive substances on the molecular mechanism of the control of genes which in turn affect cellular metabolism. In this paper we revisit the interrelationship between cancer and metabolis...|$|R
