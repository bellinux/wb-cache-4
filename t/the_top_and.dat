5|$|A {{triangular}} banner {{appearing to}} depict a bird (possibly a raven) appears on a penny minted by Olaf Cuaran around 940. The coin features a roughly right isosceles triangular standard, {{with the two}} equilateral sides situated at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>and</b> staff, respectively. Along the hypotenuse {{are a series of}} five tabs or tassels. The staff is topped by {{what appears to be a}} cross; this may indicate a fusion of pagan and Christian symbolism.|$|E

5|$|At {{the base}} of the mountain, Holley and others in the {{afternoon}} saw E Company men come down from <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>and,</b> later, men from the engineer company. Each group thought it was the last of the survivors and told confused, conflicting stories. When all remaining members of D Company had been assembled, Holley found that the company had suffered 50 percent casualties; 18 men were wounded and 30 were missing in action.|$|E

Within ninety seconds, Stanley Mortensen sent a cross {{from the left}} wing to Roy Bentley, who let off a shot that was barely pushed aside by U.S. goalkeeper Frank Borghi.

Three holes on <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>and</b> {{on the bottom of}} the fragment would have once held it in place.|$|E

5|$|The {{esophagus}} {{is surrounded}} at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>and</b> bottom by two muscular rings, known respectively as the upper esophageal sphincter {{and the lower}} esophageal sphincter.

5|$|There was {{a simpler}} {{performance}} on tape {{and a more}} difficult one, with Mariah singing out more, with more licks. But we chose a happy medium.

She {{wants to do something}} that's so over <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>and</b> use her talents and the voice she has.
