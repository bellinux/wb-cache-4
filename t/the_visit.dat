The species was also drawn by the expedition's botanical artist Ferdinand Bauer.

A painting based on the drawing survives, however, at the Natural History Museum in London.|$|E

40|$|Many {{organizations}} and many home users have deployed WiFi networks permitting external users {{to connect to}} the Internet through their networks. Such WiFi sharing poses many security risks for <b>the</b> <b>visited</b> network {{as well as for}} <b>the</b> <b>visiting</b> user. In this paper, we focus on the recently introduced concept for tunneled WiFi roaming in which the infrastructure of <b>the</b> <b>visited</b> network is considered as part of the security architecture. A secure layer- 2 tunneling between the user’s device and his home network is performed by <b>the</b> <b>visited</b> network only after the successful authentication of all three parties. The authentication protocol provides the mobile device and its home network with a secret key that protects their end-to-end communication. Additionally, it provides another tunnel key, shared with <b>the</b> <b>visited</b> network, that protects the actual traffic exchanged between <b>the</b> <b>visited</b> and home networks and prevents diverse resource consumption attacks against the latter. This concept encourages users to provide roaming service in a more secure and privacyfriendly way. We show how to implement this concept using the IEEE 802. 11 i/EAP framework, based on existing infrastructures and standard tunneling protocols...|$|R

5|$|Diệm spent {{little time}} on {{detailed}} defence and policy discussions with Australian officials during the trip, {{because of his}} extensive meetings with Catholic leaders. Although Diệm had signalled his intentions to discuss defence relations during <b>the</b> <b>visit,</b> these did not materialise. At the end of <b>the</b> <b>visit,</b> Diệm and Menzies released a bilateral statement, announcing that they would increase {{the magnitude of the}} Colombo Plan, a program under which Asian students could study abroad in Western nations. However, there was little detail in the announcements relating to anti-communism, with only general expressions of Australian support. Diệm had previously stated that if North Vietnam attacked the south, he would send the Army of the Republic of Vietnam to land in the Red River Delta in the north and retaliate. This was contrary to the air attack plans of the South East Asian Treaty Organization (SEATO), which had vowed to defend the south under the provisions of the Manila Treaty. Despite the public statements of support, the Australian government never shared the details of the SEATO plans with Diệm.|$|E
