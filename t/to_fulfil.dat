5|$|Applying the {{categorical}} imperative, duties arise because failure <b>to</b> <b>fulfil</b> {{them would}} either {{result in a}} contradiction in conception or in a contradiction in the will.

An imperfect duty allows flexibility—beneficence is an imperfect duty {{because we are not}} obliged to be completely beneficent at all times, but may choose the times and places in which we are. Kant believed that perfect duties are more important than imperfect duties: if a conflict between duties arises, the perfect duty must be followed.|$|E
