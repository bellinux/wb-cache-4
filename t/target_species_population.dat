40|$|As {{part of a}} multi-collaborator {{research}} project on the potential of non-timber forest product (NTFP) trade for conservation and development the authors designed tools to assess the effects of NTFP trade on people’s livelihoods and the environment. To assess livelihood outcomes of NTFP trade they used the Sustainable Rural Livelihoods framework and identified indicators to capture changes in financial, physical, natural, human and social assets at the household and community level. They also selected indicators to assess livelihood related changes at the national level. To assess {{the environmental impacts of}} commercial NTFP production this paper identified indicators at four levels: <b>target</b> <b>species</b> <b>population,</b> land use ecosystem, landscape, and global level. The method presented in this paper is meant to provide a time and cost effective tool to measure the effects of NTFP trade, based on expert judgment.

40|$|A geostatistical {{approach}} {{to evaluate the}} side effects of insecticides on non <b>target</b> <b>species</b> using a non replicated treatments. Field research was carried out, in pear orchards in the Emilia-Romagna region (I), to study the side effects on populations of Anthocoris nemoralis F. of three different strategies to control the first generation of Cydia pomonella L. The strategies were: i) soft = application of CpGV, ii) OP = application of phosmet and chlorpyrifos and iii) reduced risk = thiacloprid and methoxyfenozide. These strategies were applied on large single block plots and the responses on Cacopsylla pyri L. and A. nemoralis F. populations were analysed by means of geostatistical approach. The A. nemoralis data was collected by means of a grid sampling plan based on referenced points while C. pyri were sampled as average of mobile instars per each plot. The population density of C. pyri and A. nemoralis were higher in OP and soft strategies than in the reduced risk strategy, but the prey/predator population ratio was similar for the three strategies. The geostatistical monitoring method could be adapted to measure the effects of different products on some target and non <b>target</b> <b>species</b> <b>populations,</b> also on non replicated large plots or wide areas...|$|R

Après vingt ans de suivi de la réhabilitation de la tourbière de Landemarais en Bretagne, quels sont les résultats sur le {{maintien}} des espèces et des habitats ? Quelles sont les améliorations à envisager dans les pratiques de gestion ? Resulting from terrestrialization of a pond {{built in}} Xth century, the telmatic wetland of Landemarais is an acidic mire, locally differentiated by local ombrotrophic bogs. Linked to peat digging, particularly in 1968, the drainage has amplified the woodland dynamics. Integrated within the ENS ("Espaces naturels sensibles") network of the Conseil Général 35 in 1989, {{the objectives of}} peatland restoration were recovering open areas after woodland clearing and peat rewetting.

40|$|A {{transnational}} {{network of}} genetic conservation units for forest trees was recently documented in Europe aiming at {{the conservation of}} evolutionary processes and the adaptive potential of natural or man-made tree populations. In this study, we quantified the vulnerability of individual conservation units and the whole network to climate change using climate favourability models and the estimated velocity of climate change. Compared to the overall climate niche of the analysed <b>target</b> <b>species</b> <b>populations</b> at the warm and dry end of the species niche are underrepresented in the network. However, by 2100, <b>target</b> <b>species</b> in 33 – 65 % of conservation units, mostly located in southern Europe, {{will be at the}} limit or outside the species' current climatic niche as demonstrated by favourabilities below required model sensitivities of 95 %. The highest average decrease in favourabilities throughout the network can be expected for coniferous trees although they are mainly occurring within units in mountainous landscapes for which we estimated lower velocities of change. Generally, the species-specific estimates of favourabilities showed only low correlations to the velocity of climate change in individual units, indicating that both vulnerability measures should be considered for climate risk analysis. The variation in favourabilities among <b>target</b> <b>species</b> within the same conservation units is expected to increase with climate change and will likely require a prioritization among co-occurring species. The present results suggest that there is a strong need to intensify monitoring efforts and to develop additional conservation measures for populations in the most vulnerable units. Also, our results call for continued transnational actions for genetic conservation of European forest trees, including the establishment of dynamic conservation populations outside the current species distribution ranges within European assisted migration schemes...|$|R
40|$|The {{freshwater}} {{pearl mussel}} Margaritifera margaritifera L. {{is one of}} the most endangered freshwater mussels in the world. Effective conservation of threatened species requires not only ecological, but also genetic information from the <b>target</b> <b>species</b> and <b>populations.</b> Since low genetic diversity can reduce the ability of a species to adapt to environmental changes, maintaining genetic diversity has been identified as one of the key elements in successful conservation programs. We examined genetic variation of the freshwater pearl mussel from the River Vuokkijoki, Karelia, Russia. We sequenced a fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (COI) from 22 individuals and compared the data to 32 previously published COI sequences available in GenBank. We identified 10 different COI haplotypes in the sequenced samples, three of which had not been previously reported. Our results show that the River Vuokkijoki has high genetic diversity and suggest that the colonization of this northern freshwater pearl mussel population might have occurred from multiple and even distant refugia. Therefore, the freshwater pearl mussel population of the River Vuokkijoki is valuable for the conservation of the whole species...|$|R
40|$|Describing {{the drivers}} of species loss and of {{community}} change are important goals in both conservation and ecology. However, {{it is difficult}} to determine whether exploited species decline due to direct effects of harvesting or due to other environmental perturbations brought about by proximity to human populations. Here we quantify differences in species richness of coral reef fish communities along a human population gradient in Papua New Guinea to understand the relative impacts of fishing and environmental perturbation. Using data from published species lists we categorize the reef fishes as either fished or non-fished based on their body size and reports from the published literature. Species diversity for both fished and non-fished groups decreases as the size of the local human population increases, and this relationship is stronger in species that are fished. Additionally, comparison of modern and museum collections show that modern reef communities have proportionally fewer fished species relative to 19 th century ones. Together these findings show that the reef fish communities of Papua New Guinea experience multiple anthropogenic stressors and that even at low human <b>population</b> levels <b>targeted</b> <b>species</b> experience <b>population</b> declines across both time and space...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of Aedes aegypti (L.) in Australia is currently restricted to northern Queensland, {{but it has}} been more extensive in the past. In this study, we evaluate the genetic structure of Ae. aegypti populations in Australia and Vietnam and consider genetic differentiation between mosquitoes from these areas and those from a population in Thailand. Six microsatellites and two exon primed intron crossing markers were used to assess isolation by distance across all populations and also within the Australian sample. Investigations of founder effects, amount of molecular variation between and within regions and comparison of FST values among Australian and Vietnamese populations were made to assess the scale of movement of Ae. aegypti. Genetic control methods are under development for mosquito vector populations including the dengue vector Ae. aegypti. The success of these control methods will depend on the population structure of the <b>target</b> <b>species</b> including <b>population</b> size and rates of movement among populations. Releases of modified mosquitoes could target local populations that show a high degree of isolation from surrounding populations, potentially allowing new variants to become established in one region with eventual dispersal to other regions...|$|R

40|$|Herbivores {{can play}} an {{important}} role as seed dispersal vectors, ungulates constituting potential seed dispersal agents of Mediterranean grasses and shrubs. We evaluated the role of domestic goats as seed dispersers of five representative Mediterranean forage shrub species (Cistus albidus L., Phillyrea angustifolia L., Calicotome villosa (Poir.) Link., Rhamnus lycioides L. and Atriplex halimus L.). Following seed ingestion by goats, total faeces were collected at 24 -h intervals for five days. The total number of seeds recovered varied among species, with R. lycioides showing the minimum recovery percentage (1. 3 %) and C. albidus (35. 8 %), the maximum. Seed recovery was significantly related to seed hardness and length. In most species, the maximum amount of seeds recovered occurred 48 - 72 h after ingestion. The passage through the goat gut significantly depressed seed germination in C. albidus, C. villosa and A. halimus; inhibited it in R. lycioides and increased it in P. angustifolia. Seedling emergence was significantly lower in intact dung pellets than in broken-down ones, and both significantly lower than in uneaten seeds (control). The results of this study show that goats can potentially favor or inhibit seed dispersal of browsed Mediterranean shrub species. Therefore, goat grazing could be a potential management tool for expanding <b>target</b> shrub <b>species</b> <b>populations</b> or preventing shrub encroachment in undesired areas...|$|R
40|$|Fishing {{is widely}} {{recognised}} {{as the largest}} anthropogenic impact on coastal marine ecosystems. Bottom trawling is both widespread and a major impacting activity with documented effects on <b>target</b> <b>species,</b> <b>populations</b> of non-target <b>species,</b> food web dynamics and habitat features. In this thesis the effects of trawling on the benthic biogeochemistry of the central west North Sea were investigated. Two areas with similar sediment properties were identified for comparative analysis of North Sea sediments from trawled and untrawled areas. A combination of field and complimentary microcosm experiments were employed to examine the impacts of commercial trawling on the assemblage of benthic macrofauna, distributions of dissolved nutrients and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CIDOM). The infauna in trawled areas consisted of species, the size of which were on average - 36 % smaller than those from untrawled areas, whereas total mean macrofaunal abundance was - 60 % greater in trawled sediments. These size and abundance differences had a profound affect on bioturbation. Natural densities of bioturbators from untrawled sediments increased benthic fluxes relative to an abiotic situation by up to 81 % NH 4 +i 197 % P 04 3 -, 96 % N 02 - and 33 % N 03 -. Fauna from trawled sediments gave flux values that lay between untrawled faunal fluxes and fluxes from controls without fauna. In addition to the long-term alteration in sediment biogeochemistry resulting from altered faunistic composition the direct impact of trawl gear produced an enhanced sediment efflux for NH 4 + (475 % greater than the background flux) and N 02 - (26 % greater than the background flux). In contrast, P 04 3 - influx, observed in systems without trawl impacts changed to a net efflux following trawl disturbance (- 15 %). In contrast, N 03 -, displayed a net efflux in the control systems, yet, a decrease of - 1. 0 % was apparent following heavy trawling. Altered flux rates persisted for > 48 hours. During the main fishing season nutrient profiles were perturbed down to - 4 cm in sediments from trawled sites. Nutrient concentrations in the top 4 cm of trawled sediments were characterised by a relatively homogenous surface sediment layer in which concentrations were significantly lower than concentrations in untrawled sediments. This thesis has demonstrated that the impacts of commercial trawl fisheries on benthic biogeochemistry in the North Sea are of a significant magnitude and scale to affect local and potentially regional nutrient dynamics.

40|$|Supplementary feeding {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{techniques}} used to alleviate threats to scavengers species related to the quality and availability of food resources. Because supplementary feeding may have undesired effects, the management of supplementary sites should be optimized from an ecological and conservation perspective. We installed high-resolution videocameras at six Spanish feeding stations recording more that 7500 h of observations at 105 feeding events. We analyzed food preferences in the four European vulture species (Eurasian griffon vulture Gyps fulvus, Egyptian vulture Neophron percnopterus, bearded vulture Gypaetus barbatus and cinereous vulture Aegypius monachus) as they relate to the characteristics of the food remains and carcasses provided at feeding sites. Our results suggest that carrion features (format, scattering, prey species, biomass and items) influence differential selection between species and age-classes. At a species level, large inputs of unscattered carrion increased the abundance of actively feeding griffon vultures. The ratio of the abundance of bearded vultures, Egyptian vultures and cinereous vultures with respect to griffon vultures was favored when less biomass was supplied and when the food provided was not presented as whole carcasses. Thus, using medium-size ungulates (i. e. sheep and goats) presented as small, abundant and scattered pieces favors the consumption of the resource by the most endangered species. Our findings can be used to optimize the supplementary provisioning of vultures in cases where this conservation tool is considered essential for managing <b>targeted</b> <b>species</b> or <b>population</b> groups...|$|R
40|$|Initiatives {{to restore}} {{characteristic}} plant species diversity to degraded habitats require <b>target</b> plant <b>species</b> <b>populations</b> {{to be established}} and maintained. In landscapes managed intensively for agriculture, species that are foci for restoration efforts may be scarce, being confined to core reserves of less-modified habitat or persisting as fragmented populations on linear landscape features. Botanical data from small and large-scale surveys across Britain was used to investigate whether grassland plants favoured by less intensive management persisted on field boundaries despite increasing productivity in the adjacent field. At low field productivity, field species richness was, on average, higher than in field boundaries. As productivity increased, boundary plots reduced in richness at a slower rate than adjacent fields thus boundaries became relatively richer in grassland species than adjacent fields. Species compositional similarity between fields and their boundaries also declined with increasing field productivity. Grassland field boundaries can function as refugia. However, the lower relative species richness of boundaries next to the least productive fields indicated that some plant species will, on average, be increasingly uncommon or absent in boundaries as field productivity increases. High residual variation in these relationships was linked to local variation in conditions between fields and their boundaries. Field boundaries next to highly productive grasslands appear to function as partial refugia for grassland plants. While highly species rich boundaries can locally occur next to species poor fields, the species richness of most boundaries falls well short of values typical of the least productive fields. ...|$|R

No significant differences in genetic diversity were observed among populations by microsatellite markers with HE ranging from 0. 597 to 0. 612 and low, but significant, genetic differentiation among populations (FST = 0. 019, P = 0. 001). By contrast, the insecticide-resistance markers display heterogeneous allelic distributions with significant differences detected between Central Ugandan (urban) populations relative to Eastern and Southwestern (rural) populations. In the central region, a frequency of 62 % for Vgsc- 1014 F, and 32 % for the Ace 1 - 119 S resistant allele were observed. Conversely, in both Eastern and Southwestern regions the Vgsc- 1014 F alleles were close to fixation, whilst Ace 1 - 119 S allele frequency was 12 % (although frequencies may be underestimated due to copy number variation at both loci). Taken together, the microsatellite and both insecticide resistance target-site markers provide evidence that in the face of intense gene flow among populations, disjunction in resistance frequencies arise due to intense local selection pressures despite an absence of insecticidal control interventions targeting Culex...|$|R

A bimodal mismatch distribution in N. brevirostris indicates that a biogeographic barrier separated N. brevirostris populations sometime during its species history. Naso unicornis, in contrast, lacked genetic structure of any kind, although it has what could represent a single surviving clade.

We show here how the effects of management in competitive communities extend far beyond the target population. A crucial role is played by the underlying stability properties of the community under management. In general, locally unstable communities are more vulnerable to perturbation through management. Furthermore, the community response is shown {{to be sensitive to the}} relative density of the <b>target</b> <b>species.</b> Of considerable interest is the result that even a small (2. 5...|$|R

Understanding {{the effects}} of lethal {{predator}} control on predator communities is of great interest for the conservation and wildlife management. We used camera traps and occupancy models to assess the influence of predator control on red fox (Vulpes vulpes, <b>target</b> <b>species)</b> and stone marten (Martes foina, non-target <b>species)</b> <b>populations</b> across 12 localities of central Spain. Results show that the intensity of fox control (IFC) {{was not associated with}} fox occupancy, but it was negatively related to fox detectability. On the contrary, the IFC was positively related to stone marten occupancy, but unrelated to its detectability. Habitat composition and prey availability were more closely associated with site occupancy of both species than predator control. We provide valuable information on the ecological consequences of fox control often employed as a management tool in many European game estates. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
