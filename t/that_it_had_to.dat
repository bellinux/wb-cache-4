5|$|Ishigami {{played a}} large role in the {{implementation}} of the Wi-Fi rescue quests, and it went smoother than anticipated, something the developers attributed to their experience with developing mobile games.

Due to programming changes between the Japanese and the English versions of the game, rescue quests from the North American and European versions are only compatible with each other, and not with the Japanese release.|$|E
5|$|Louis XVIII {{encouraged}} {{his niece}} {{to write her}} memoirs, as he wished them {{to be used as}} Bourbon propaganda. In 1796 and 1803, Louis also used the diaries of Louis XVI's final attendants in the same way. In January 1801, Tsar Paul told Louis XVIII that he could no longer live in Russia.

5|$|AT {{acquired}} TCI in 2000, inheriting its {{agreement with}} CSG. AT alleged CSG was not abiding by the contract's terms to provide favorable rates. A legal {{dispute between the}} two companies began in 2001 in arbitration court. Before the dispute was resolved, AT Broadband was acquired by Comcast, who wanted to use its own billing and customer service vendor. In October 2002, a judge ruled that CSG owed Comcast a $120 million refund and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> reduce its prices. The two companies disagreed over whether the ruling would allow Comcast to halt their agreement {{before the end of}} its term.

5|$|Also in 1900, a {{proposal}} {{was presented to}} parliament by the Islington and Euston Railway (I) for {{an extension of the}} City and South London Railway (C) from Angel to Euston. At the time, the C {{was in the process of}} constructing an extension to Angel from its recently opened terminus at Moorgate Street. The extension plan was initially permitted in 1901, but delays in the parliamentary process meant <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be re-submitted the following year. The second submission was opposed by the Metropolitan Railway, which saw the extension as competition to its service between King's Cross and Moorgate, and the plan was rejected. A third attempt, presented to parliament in November 1902 by the C itself, was successful and approved in 1903.|$|E

5|$|Channel 4 {{was also}} accused of showing too many studio {{segments}} {{during the first}} few days of the Games rather than live events, and for missing several notable events involving British athletes, including a swimming heat where Eleanor Simmonds set a new personal best and almost beat the world record, Sarah Storey winning her eleventh Paralympic medal, and Great Britain's opening wheelchair basketball game against Germany. Channel 4 noted that time was needed {{during the first few}} days to explain Paralympic events and the classification system to viewers, and that it was operating three additional channels' worth of live coverage throughout the Games. The broadcaster also stated <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> make editorial decisions on which events to air during periods where a large number of events were in progress. The amount of live coverage was also affected by Olympic Broadcasting Services, who did not send cameras or provide official television coverage for sports such as cycling, the marathon, and shooting. Channel 4's news department did send its own cameramen to film the affected events for highlights, but was unable to broadcast them live.|$|E
5|$|Coming {{just after}} New Zealand {{abandoned}} their 1967 rugby tour over South Africa's refusal {{to accommodate a}} mixed team, the cancellation of the 1968–69 MCC series over D'Oliveira marked the second such incident in two years. According to Oborne, the affair forced upon South African cricket a realisation <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> change. In 1969, the South African Cricket Board of Control (SACBOC) announced that future teams would be racially integrated and selected purely on merit; efforts duly began to allow all races to compete against each other and share facilities. This led to some disagreement among non-white sports organisations between those who supported these incremental changes and those who wanted immediate disbanding of the old system. D'Oliveira, {{a member of the}} first group, was partly drawn into this conflict. He also faced criticism from those in South Africa and England who believed that, to oppose apartheid, he should have declared himself unavailable to tour in the first place. With the tour to South Africa cancelled, the MCC hastily arranged for its team to play a Test series in Pakistan instead. D'Oliveira played and was very successful. He remained an England regular for four more years and played for Worcestershire until 1979.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to {{the common}} understanding, the {{crossing}} of the Andes {{was not the first}} time that a military expedition crossed the mountain range. The difference from previous operations was the size of the army, and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be ready for combat right after the crossing. The army was divided in six columns, each taking a different path. Colonel Francisco Zelada in La Rioja took the Come-Caballos pass towards Copiapó. Juan Manuel Cabot, in San Juan, moved to Coquimbo. Ramón Freire and José León Lemos led two columns in the south. The bulk of the armies left from Mendoza. San Martín, O'Higgins and Soler led a column across the Los Patos pass, and Juan Gregorio de Las Heras another one across the Uspallata Pass.|$|E

40|$|To {{overcome}} current {{limitations in}} capturing user-defined-semantics in a featrue-based model a descrition language is needed, which supports both an automatic and a manual generation of feature classes In this paper, {{an approach to}} a specification of a Feature Description Language (FDL) is introduced, which allows to describe features in a declarative way, rather than by a sequential composition of featrue primitives. The main elements in this approach are hierarchically classified information units specifying feature, form-related entities, parameters, and constraints. The main requriements to the FDL are <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be an intuitively understandable language and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> faciliate the manual specification of features.

5|$|Despite the {{technical}} innovations of the railway {{and the large}} passenger demand, the C was not particularly profitable and the rapid series of extensions aimed at improving profits had placed a strain on the finances. The dividends were low and declining (2​18% in 1898, 1​78% in 1899 and 1​14% in 1900) and the company {{had been accused of}} extravagance for the abandonment of King William Street station. In an attempt to work around this poor reputation and make it easier to raise funds, the next bill for an extension of the line was submitted in November 1900 by a notionally separate company, the Islington and Euston Railway (I), albeit one that shared its chairman with the C The proposed railway was to run from the as yet unfinished C station at Angel to the main-line stations at King's Cross, St Pancras and Euston. The I bill coincided with a rash of other railway bills encouraged by the successful opening of the Central London Railway (CLR) in 1900 and was considered alongside these by another Parliamentary Joint Committee in 1901. The bill was approved, but the time taken for the committee's review meant <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be resubmitted for the 1902 Parliamentary session.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} the staging of Ballo, Verdi was approached by several opera companies seeking a new work or making offers to stage one of his existing ones, but refused them all. But when, in December 1860, an approach was made from Saint Petersburg's Imperial Theatre, the offer of 60,000 francs plus all expenses was doubtless a strong incentive. Verdi {{came up with the}} idea of adapting the 1835 Spanish play Don Alvaro o la fuerza del sino by Angel Saavedra, which became La forza del destino, with Piave writing the libretto. The Verdis arrived in St. Petersburg in December 1861 for the premiere, but casting problems meant <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be postponed.|$|E
5|$|Loomis and DuBridge {{recruited}} physicists {{for the new}} {{laboratory at}} an Applied Nuclear Physics conference at MIT in October 1940. Among those who volunteered was Rabi. His assignment was to study the magnetron, which was so secret <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be kept in a safe. The Radiation Laboratory scientists set their sights on producing a microwave radar set by 6 January 1941, and having a prototype installed in a Douglas A-20 Havoc by March. This was done; the technological obstacles were gradually overcome, and a working US microwave radar set was produced. The magnetron was further developed {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic to permit a reduction in wavelength from 150cm to 10cm, and then to 3cm. The laboratory went on to develop air-to-surface radar to detect submarines, the SCR-584 radar for fire control, and LORAN, a long-range radio navigation system. At Rabi's instigation, a branch of the Radiation Laboratory was located at Columbia, with Rabi in charge.|$|E

5|$|While local {{sources of}} gold are attested during the Aksumite era, silver {{seems to have}} been rarer in Aksum. No mention of silver mines in the region exist until the 15th and 16th centuries. Though silver was {{imported}} as attested by the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, given the preponderance of silver coins, it could not have been the only source of silver in Aksum. Furthermore, a significant number of the silver coins contain gold inlays (presumably to increase the value), which would have been unnecessary if silver were so rare <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be mainly imported. Silver may have been obtained from the refinement of gold, which sometimes occurs naturally with silver in an alloy called electrum. Copper and bronze do not seem to have existed locally in the Aksumite empire, though they were noted as imports in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea.|$|E
5|$|Still {{friends with}} Martello, Buczynski {{initiated}} him up till the third degree of the Welsh Traditionalist tradition, in return receiving third degree initiation into the Strega tradition. At the same time, {{he was facing}} problems within his own tradition as one couple running their own Welsh outer coven, Claudia and Gerard Nero, had decided to abandon Buczynski's tradition and receive initiation into Gardnerianism from the Kneitals; they had ultimately decided to do so after becoming increasingly sceptical of his historical claims to Palaeolithic roots. They took their initiates, including Margot Adler, with them, much to Buczynski and Slater's annoyance, leading to {{a breakdown of the}} friendship that they had had with the Kneitals. His tradition nevertheless continued to grow and spread, and in January 1973, the tradition joined the Council of Earth Religions (COER), a pan-Pagan umbrella organisation founded the previous year to work for the common defence of the movement. His primary inner coven grew to a size <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> divide into two at Midsummer 1973. His high priestess, Kay Smith, decided to take lead of one of them, while Eddie remained in the other, being joined by a new ritual consort named Judith.
