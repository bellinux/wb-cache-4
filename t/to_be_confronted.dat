50|$|In late September 2007, Kennedy {{was part}} of a group observing Ukraine's {{parliamentary}} elections in the Mariupol electoral commission. Kennedy reported back to the Canadian media that the group he <b>was</b> a party <b>to</b> <b>was</b> <b>confronted</b> by Ukrainian police who stripped passports and observer statuses. Kennedy said that the police were interfering in the process, and the observer group felt intimidated by the police who carried weapons and followed the group around for a day. Kennedy concluded that there were major flaws in the voting process, as the group <b>was</b> also witness <b>to</b> extra ballots being distributed.|$|R

5|$|Operation Slapstick did {{not provide}} the {{diversion}} General Eisenhower had hoped for. The decision by Heidrich not to oppose the landings was made without reference to Kesselring's headquarters. Heidrich had expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>confronted</b> by an overwhelming Allied force and had withdrawn his units north, although he endeavoured to delay the Allied advance where possible by ambushes and roadblocks. The German division went on to frustrate the Allied attempt to advance on Rome during the Battle of Monte Cassino in 1944.|$|E

5|$|On 6 September, XXXVI Corps {{launched}} a frontal assault against the Soviet fortifications but made only slow progress. XXXVI Corps attempted another flanking attack similar to Kayrela, with one German regiment trying {{to circumvent the}} Soviet defenses in the south. This time it did not work as well, and the German effort bogged down against heavy resistance. After days of fighting, the Germans were finally able to push behind the Voyta River only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>confronted</b> by another even stronger Soviet defense line. The so-called VL or Verman Line stretched from Lake Verkhneye Verman to Lake Tolvand and included heavy Soviet pre-war fortifications.|$|E
5|$|The British {{government}} {{had decided that}} the RUF could not be trusted, and would have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>confronted</b> and forced to enter the UN's Disarmament, Demobilisation, and Reintegration (DDR) process. They assessed that there were three options available to achieve this—to deploy British forces against the RUF, for UNAMSIL to expand its operations and confront the RUF, or for the Sierra Leonean government to use loyal forces (the SLA, former SLA personnel, the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council, and several other militia groups) {{to take on the}} RUF. Richards estimated that a British deployment against the RUF would require at least a brigade-sized force (in excess of 5,000 troops). Nevertheless, British forces' involvement in Sierra Leone was politically unpopular in Westminster and the MoD could not assemble such a force while maintaining its commitments elsewhere, so the use of British forces to directly confront the RUF was ruled out. Also ruled out was a UNAMSIL-led confrontation. Although UNAMSIL's mandate would have allowed it to enter into combat with the RUF, the national contingents were reluctant to leave their bases and its focus remained on peacekeeping rather than the peace enforcement that the British and others believed was necessary.|$|E
5|$|On the February 3, 2016 {{episode of}} Lucha Underground, Mundo faced Killshot in a winning effort. After the match, Mundo taunted Lucha Underground Champion Mil Muertes, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>confronted</b> by Cage. Mundo {{defeated}} Cage on February 24, after interference from the debuting Taya, subsequently becoming Mundo's valet. On the May 25 episode of Lucha Underground, Taya revealed to PJ Black and Jack Evans that their partner Fénix was injured by Mundo. As Mundo revealed himself as Fénix's replacement for their match, Black and Evans {{allied with the}} two. Later {{that night in the}} main event, Mundo, Black and Evans defeated Rey Mysterio Jr., Prince Puma and Dragon Azteca Jr. to win the Lucha Underground Trios Championship, the first championship for each in Lucha Underground. The week after, Mundo, Black and Evans, now collectively billed as Worldwide Underground, retained their championships in a rematch via disqualification. During the match, Mundo delivered a low blow to Azteca Jr. while Taya distracted the referee. After seeing Mundo's actions, Puma hit a low blow to Mundo, causing a disqualification towards Puma's team. On the June 8 episode of Lucha Underground, Mundo teamed up with Taya, Ivelisse, Fénix, King Cuerno and Pentagón Jr. in a 12-man tag team match where the winning team would go on to face each other in a six-man elimination match to determine the No. 1 contender for the Lucha Underground Championship. Mundo's team won defeating Rey Mysterio Jr., Prince Puma, Sexy Star, The Mack, Son of Havoc and El Texano Jr. The week after, Mundo lost the six-man elimination match which was won by Pentagón Jr. Worldwide Underground lost their titles to Aero Star, Drago and Fénix at the third and final part Ultima Lucha Dos, which aired on July 20.|$|E

5000|$|The tournament {{involves}} four events: Breaking, Mens Weapons, Female Kata, and Freestyle fighting. Stone's team narrowly defeats Chan in the Female Kata, but Lee defeats Cellini, one of Stone's students, in Breaking. True to his word, Norris defeats Stone in Freestyle fighting. Barry -- {{aided by}} a vivid daydream -- scores well in the Mens Weapons. The result is a tie between Stone's team and Lee's team. In the tie-breaker, Lee <b>is</b> allowed <b>to</b> choose the participants, and chooses Barry and Cellini, saying Barry is the {{member of the team}} with [...] "something to prove." [...] Stone chooses the event, Breaking. Barry <b>is</b> dismayed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>confronting</b> Cellini in the latter's best event but Lee tilts the odds in Barry's favor by using a small amount of lighter fluid to set Barry's bricks on fire.

25|$|Guerrillas in wars {{against foreign}} powers may direct their attacks at civilians, {{particularly}} if foreign forces are too strong <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>confronted</b> directly {{on a long}} term basis. In Vietnam, bombings and terror attacks against civilians were fairly common, and were often effective in demoralizing local opinion that supported the ruling regime and its American backers. While attacking an American base might involve lengthy planning and casualties, smaller scale terror strikes in the civilian sphere were easier to execute. Such attacks also {{had an effect on}} the international scale, demoralizing American opinion, and hastening a withdrawal.|$|E

25|$|Bourdieu himself {{believes}} class distinction {{and preferences}} are “most marked {{in the ordinary}} choices of everyday existence, such as furniture, clothing, or cooking, which are particularly revealing of deep-rooted and long-standing dispositions because, lying {{outside the scope of}} the educational system, they have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>confronted,</b> as it were, by naked taste.” Indeed, Bourdieu believes that “the strongest and most indelible mark of infant learning” would probably be in the tastes of food. Bourdieu thinks that meals served on special occasions are “an interesting indicator of the mode of self-presentation adopted in ‘showing off’ a life-style (in which furniture also plays a part).” The idea is that their likes and dislikes should mirror those of their associated class fractions.|$|E
