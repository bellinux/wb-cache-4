5|$|During 1997, BK revamped its French fries in North America.

The fries were in research and development for over two years and already had been available in several markets when the advertising campaign began. In Europe, BK also sells potato wedges, a type of French fry that is thick-cut and wedge-shaped. In 1991, the company introduced <b>Twister</b> fries, spiral-cut fries with a spicy coating, as part of a promotional push. Part of the product's appeal was they were served in a paper drink cup as opposed to the normal fry carton. The product was designed as a short-term promotion that would be periodically reintroduced.|$|E

The nebular columns and solid areas were modeled with basic wireframe geometry, with surface shaders applied to make {{the edges of the}} nebula glow. A particle render that ILM had devised for the earlier tornado film <b>Twister</b> was used to create a turbulent look within the nebula.

5|$|After the Fort Worth tornado dissipated, another {{thunderstorm}} {{developed over}} Johnson County, tracking northeastward into Tarrant County and eventually merging with the supercell that had produced the earlier F3tornado. The new development prompted the re-issuance of the tornado warning for Tarrant County at 6:40p.m. CST (00:40UTC). At 7:05p.m. CST (01:05UTC), the Arlington tornado touched down on South Cooper Road, causing initial {{damage to a}} restaurant; the tornado's touchdown coincided {{with the appearance of}} a tornado vortex signature on radar imagery. Well-built homes within a residential area along Embercrest Drive sustained widespread damage, with some houses experiencing up to F3-rated damage; such damage occurred after garage doors failed, allowing tornadic winds to unroof homes and push out exterior walls. As a consequence, homes that faced the tornadic winds sustained more damage than homes whose attached garages were sheltered from the strong winds. After crossing Matlock Road, the tornado did additional damage to one- and two-story homes in another subdivision, producing F3damage. Many homes suffered the collapse of brick masonry walls due to poor construction as they were not properly anchored to the homes' frames. The tornado then swept across northern portions of the Arlington Municipal Airport, dealing F2damage before briefly paralleling Interstate 20. At 7:12p.m. CST (01:12UTC), the tornado crossed the interstate, overturning at least one 18-wheeler. The <b>twister</b> continued to track northeast, causing F2damage to a subdivision northeast of Grand Prairie Municipal Airport in Dallas County before dissipating at 7:20p.m. CST (01:20UTC).|$|E
