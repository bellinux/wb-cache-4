40|$|Use of inter-loop aiding for {{improving}} tracking performance {{has been widely}} researched in recent years. However, most of <b>the</b> previously proposed <b>aiding</b> schemes rely {{on the assumption that}} <b>the</b> <b>aiding</b> loop remains unaffected by received interference. This paper argues that this may not always be the case. It is likely that the performance of <b>the</b> <b>aiding</b> loop may also degrade in the case where interference is received at <b>the</b> <b>aiding</b> carrier’s frequency resulting in performance degradation of both aiding and aided loops. This paper proposes an aiding scheme that offers performance improvements in case interference corrupts both frequencies. Also, an algorithm is proposed that continuously updates <b>the</b> <b>aided</b> loop bandwidth to keep its jitter at a minimum. A relationship between the quality of <b>the</b> <b>aiding</b> signal and its effects on the performance of <b>the</b> <b>aided</b> loop is analysed. An adaptive Kalman filter-based implementation of <b>the</b> <b>aiding</b> architecture is proposed to improve <b>the</b> quality of <b>aiding</b> estimates. This implementation offers an improved margin against received interference.

40|$|We {{examine a}} two country aid model with {{performance}} intensive <b>aid.</b> <b>The</b> <b>aid</b> budget {{is determined by}} a donor country legislature, but allocated by a donor agency {{in terms of a}} performance criterion of its choice. Five sources of slippage in policy delivery are introduced: the donor agency observes the performance of <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> recipient imperfectly; <b>the</b> donor agency and <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> recipient are subject to inefficiency; <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> recipient experiences corruption; and adjustment of aid recipient performance is costly. Incentives between <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> donor and <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> recipient are intentionally aligned - to explore the best-case for the policy intervention. Immediate implications are then that optimal level of effort and governance in <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> recipient increase under performance intensity of aid. Moreover, performance intensity of aid has fundraising effects. While <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> recipient also has an incentive to increase the measurement noise in governance, this incentive is weaker than that to raise true underlying governance, is weakest for <b>the</b> poorest <b>aid</b> recipients and provided that the donor agency is sufficiently efficient, measurement error itself will serve to raise optimal effort in <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> recipient. <b>The</b> importance of <b>aid</b> agency self-monitoring is thereby identified. Three important qualifications on the anticipated success of the policy emerge, however. Despite the elimination of incentive misalignment, aid donors may come to rely on performance intensity precisely where such a reliance is likely to be least successful in aid recipients. Second, performance intensity of aid maximizes its impact under conditions where it is supplemented by technical assistance to improve the effectiveness of own effort by <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> recipient. Finally, under convex adjustment costs the general class of optimal time paths in governance in aid recipients will be non-monotone, such that governance may get worse before they get better - optimally so. Performance intensive policy may thus appear to fail - immediately after imposition. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine a}} two country aid model with {{performance}} intensive <b>aid.</b> <b>The</b> <b>aid</b> budget {{is determined by}} a donor country legislature, but allocated by a donor agency {{in terms of a}} performance criterion of its choice. Five sources of slippage in policy delivery are introduced. The donor agency observes the true performance of <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> recipient with error. The donor agency itself operates under stochastically variables e¢ciency. <b>The</b> <b>aid</b> recipient experiences rent-seeking behaviour. E¤ort in <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> recipient is subject to variable e¢ciency. Finally, adjustment of performance in <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> recipient is costly both in the level of e¤ort, and in the time rate of change in the performance measure. The three core results to emerge from the model are that allocative e¢ciency improves under performance intensity of <b>aid,</b> in <b>the</b> sense that more aid comes to be allocated to aid recipients with good governance. Second, performance intensity of aid generates incentive e¤ects, such that the optimal level of governance in <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> recipient will increase under strengthening performance intensity of aid. Thirdly, improving governance in <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> recipient in turn was shown to lead to increased budgetary allocations to <b>aid</b> in <b>the</b> legislature that allocates aid resources. Performance intensity of aid thus has fundraising e¤ects. Policy slippage also carries impacts, however. The …rst of these is that the e¤ectiveness of the performance intensity of aid appears to depend strongly on the degree of e¢ciency of own e¤ort in <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> recipient country.
