40|$|<b>The</b> Florida <b>Comprehensive</b> Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act {{is almost}} unique among {{criminal}} drug statutes in the United States. Like all states, Florida prohibits the possession, sale, {{and delivery of}} certain controlled substances. However, a recent revision of <b>the</b> Florida <b>Comprehensive</b> Drug Act removed Florida’s burden of proving one aspect of defendants’ mens rea in drug cases. Although several cases have challenged <b>the</b> Florida <b>Comprehensive</b> Drug Act for disregarding the traditional role of mens rea in criminal law and for subjecting innocent people to prosecution, the state of Florida continues to prosecute and obtain convictions under the statute. This Note addresses the constitutionality of <b>the</b> Florida <b>Comprehensive</b> Drug Act, specifically {{in light of the}} Due Process Clause of the U. S. Constitution. Part I examines the legislative history of <b>the</b> Florida <b>Comprehensive</b> Drug Act and courts’ application of the Act. Part II analyzes state and federal cases with differing views about the statute’s constitutionality. Part III argues that under existing U. S. Supreme Court precedent <b>the</b> Florida <b>Comprehensive</b> Drug Act is constitutional and does not exceed the limits of the Due Process Clause. Finally, Part IV explores the likely future of <b>the</b> Florida <b>Comprehensive</b> Drug Act and some principles that limit its perceived impact. This Note concludes by suggesting that the U. S. Supreme Court should defer to the discretion of state legislatures in eliminating the mens rea element from criminal statutes except in the most egregious cases...|$|R

The other two new secondary were West Wythenshawe Comprehensive School and Yew Tree Secondary Modern School (based on an existing building). Parents of 119 out of 120 children who had been selected for the grammar school complained to the council about the proposed scheme to have <b>comprehensive</b> schools instead. <b>The</b> council had a plan for 'grammar school type' courses to be taught instead at <b>the</b> <b>comprehensives,</b> but <b>the</b> parents said it was 'wishful thinking' that a grammar school education was possible at <b>the</b> <b>comprehensives.</b> <b>The</b> council claimed that because Wythenshawe had elected Labour councillors at recent elections meant that local people did not want a grammar school system.|$|R
