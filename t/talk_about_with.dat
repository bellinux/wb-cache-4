500|$|Rebecca Angel, {{writing for}} Wireds Geekmom column, {{described}} {{some of the}} negative feedback from fellow writers about the mostly male brony culture that included accusations of pedophilia, homosexuality, and immaturity. Angel defended the fandom's culture, describing adult fans' interest {{as a form of}} escapism, and that the show provides characters they can relate to and <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>with</b> other fans. She also acknowledged the double-standard whereas females can watch male-oriented entertainment without question, while male bronies receive criticism about their interest in the show. Angel later described the brony fandom as rebellious towards gender roles, stating that [...] "having interests that go against what men are supposed to embrace is the sneakiest kind of rebellion". In a similar vein, an [...] "Idea Channel" [...] segment from the Public Broadcasting Service said that the ridicule received by the brony community is partly because the male appreciation for the show challenges preconceived notions of gender roles in the mass media.|$|E
2500|$|Ed Brophy, {{director}} of the International Boxing Hall of Fame, noted Camacho's talents in attracting an audience. He said, [...] "Camacho {{brought a lot of}} excitement to boxing. He was bright, colorful, and always gave something to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>with</b> his walks to the ring, with his unique style of entering, and the costumes he wore." [...] Brophy also praised Camacho's boxing skills, describing him as [...] "an exciting fighter, and one of the greats. He faced the best, going up and down several divisions." [...] Alfredo R. Martínez, senior editor of ESPN Deportes, also noted Camacho's flamboyant approach, saying that [...] "if he wasn't the first, {{he was one of the}} firsts that entered the ring with extravagant costumes, feather crests, bright clothes, everything to the rhythm of some pop song".|$|E
2500|$|Heavy Rain was {{critically}} acclaimed. The UK Official PlayStation Magazine reviewer Tim Clark wrote, [...] "I'm convinced it's {{one of the}} freshest, most exciting, {{and even}} important games on PS3 so far." [...] Clark praised the effective controls of the game, {{as well as the}} pacing of the story, which the reviewer described as key, and perfectly designed to create an [...] "exhausting, exhilarating, and, crucially, involving" [...] experience. He concluded by saying that, [...] "Certainly there's nothing quite like it on PS3, or indeed any other system. Put gaming conventions aside, go in with no expectations other than this is something new and massively good-looking, and you'll be rewarded with a unique experience that lurches between genius and madness, manages to be genuinely emotional, and that you'll be bursting to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>with</b> your friends." [...] GamesMaster complimented Heavy Rain for being [...] "incredibly original and compelling", as [...] "the atmosphere is incredible – full of driving rain (which becomes central to the plot), fizzing neon lights, dark apartments and warehouses. It's a dark noir game, not a bright adventure." [...] The game was given a GamesMaster Gold Award. IGN's Chris Roper praised the game's [...] "fantastic story that's {{one of the best in}} gaming." [...] However, he pointed out that the game's beginning is very slow, and might turn off some players. GameZone's Michael Lafferty wrote, [...] "There are some flaws, but taken as a package, Heavy Rain is a remarkable achievement in gaming that creates an interactive experience that goes beyond the pages of a good novel or film noir. This is a game that needs to be experienced." [...] Winda Benedetti wrote about the maturity of Heavy Rain as well as Remedy Entertainment's psychological action thriller Alan Wake for MSNBC, praising both titles for being [...] "emotionally powerful" [...] as well as having [...] "said goodbye to the tired alien invasions and over-the-top fantasy stories so often found in video games. Instead, they peer into the dark reaches of the very real human heart to deliver stories that are thrilling, chilling and utterly absorbing." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{think we}} {{had one of the}} jolliest breakfasts I ever remember. To begin with we were both hungry since our miseries of the night before had {{prevented}} us from eating any dinner. Indeed she swore that she had scarcely tasted food since Saturday. Then we had such a lot to <b>talk</b> <b>about.</b> <b>With</b> short intervals we talked all that day, either in the house or while walking through the gardens and grounds. Passing through the latter I came to the spot on the back drive where once I had saved her from being abducted by Harût and Marût, and as I recognized it, uttered an exclamation. She asked me why and the end of it was that I told her all that story which to this moment she had never heard, for Ragnall had thought well to keep it from her.|$|E

Is it wrong to kill a grizzly or a rattlesnake, or merciful to leave them with their meanness to destroy whatever they want?

60|$|As in her spirit, so in her body, she was different; {{her limbs}} looked freer, rounder; her breath seemed {{stirring}} her more deeply; {{like a flower}} of early June she was opening before his very eyes. This, though it gave him pleasure, also added to his fear. The strange silence, in its utter naturalness--for what could he <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>with</b> her?--brought home to him more vividly than anything before, the barriers of class. All he thought of was how not to be ridiculous! She was inviting him in some strange, unconscious, subtle way to treat her as a woman, as though in spirit she had linked her round young arms about his neck, and through her half-closed lips were whispering the eternal call of sex to sex. And he, a middle-aged and cultivated man, conscious of everything, could not even speak for fear of breaking through his shell of delicacy. He hardly breathed, disturbed to his very depths by the young figure sitting by his side, and by the dread of showing that disturbance.|$|E
60|$|As soon as Edward got a {{home of his}} own, {{he began}} to make a regular {{collection}} of all the animals and plants in Banffshire. This was a difficult {{thing for him to}} do, for he knew little of books, and had access to very few, so that he couldn't even find out the names of all the creatures he caught and preserved. But, though he didn't always know what they were called, he did know their natures and habits and all about them; and such first-hand knowledge in natural history is really the rarest and the most valuable of all. He saw little of his fellow-workmen. They were usually a drunken, careless lot; Edward was sober and thoughtful, and had other things to think of than those that they cared to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>with</b> one another. But he went out much into the fields, with invincible determination, having made up his mind that he would get to know all about the plants and beasties, however much the knowledge might cost him.|$|E
6000|$|And yet, {{happy as}} she was, Netta {{could never be}} {{absolutely}} free from a pressing fear, a doubt that Cyril might not repent his choice, and feel sorry in the end for not having married a real lady. That fear pursued her through all her little triumph, and almost succeeded in making her half jealous of Cyril whenever she saw him talking at all earnestly (and he was very apt to be earnest) with other women. [...] "They know {{so much more than}} I do," [...] she thought to herself often; [...] "he must feel so much more at home with them, naturally, and {{be able to talk to}} them about so many things that he can never possibly <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>with</b> poor little me." [...] Poor girl, it never even occurred to her that from the higher standpoint of a really learned man like Cyril Milliter the petty smattering of French and strumming of the piano, wherein alone these grand girls actually differed from her, were mere useless surface accomplishments, in no way affecting the inner intelligence or culture, which were the only things that Cyril regarded in any serious light as worthy of respect or admiration. As a matter of fact, Netta had learnt infinitely more from her Bible, her English books, her own heart, and surrounding nature, than any of these well-educated girls had learnt from their parrot-trained governesses; and she was infinitely better fitted than any of them to be a life companion for such a man as Cyril Milliter.|$|E

6000|$|Olive Chancellor {{received}} this appeal with peculiar feelings. With her immense sympathy for reform, {{she found herself}} so often wishing that reformers were a little different. There was something grand about Mrs. Farrinder; it lifted one up to be with her: {{but there was a}} false note when she spoke to her young friend about the ladies in Beacon Street. Olive hated to hear that fine avenue talked about as if it were such a remarkable place, and to live there were a proof of worldly glory. All sorts of inferior people lived there, and so brilliant a woman as Mrs. Farrinder, who lived at Roxbury, ought not to mix things up. It was, of course, very wretched to be irritated by such mistakes; but {{this was not the first}} time Miss Chancellor had observed that the possession of nerves was not by itself a reason for embracing the new truths. She knew her place in the Boston hierarchy, and it was not what Mrs. Farrinder supposed; so that there was a want of perspective in talking to her as if she had been a representative of the aristocracy. Nothing could be weaker, she knew very well, than (in the United States) to apply that term too literally; nevertheless, it would represent a reality if one were to say that, by distinction, the Chancellors belonged to the bourgeoisie--the oldest and best. They might care for such a position or not (as it happened, they were very proud of it), but there they were, and it made Mrs. Farrinder seem provincial (there was something provincial, after all, in the way she did her hair too) not to understand. When Miss Birdseye spoke as if one were a [...] "leader of society," [...] Olive could forgive her even that odious expression, because, of course, one never pretended that she, poor dear, had the smallest sense of the real. She was heroic, she was sublime, the whole moral history of Boston was reflected in her displaced spectacles; but it was a part of her originality, as it were, that she was deliciously provincial. Olive Chancellor seemed to herself to have privileges enough without being affiliated to the exclusive set and having invitations to the smaller parties, which were the real test; it was a mercy for her that she had not that added immorality on her conscience. The ladies Mrs. Farrinder meant (it was to be supposed she meant some particular ones) might speak for themselves. She wished to work in another field; she had long been preoccupied with the romance of the people. She had an immense desire to know intimately some very poor girl. This might seem one of the most accessible of pleasures; but, in point of fact, she had not found it so. There were two or three pale shop-maidens whose acquaintance she had sought; but they had seemed afraid of her, and the attempt had come to nothing. She took them more tragically then they took themselves; they couldn't make out what she wanted them to do, and they always ended by being odiously mixed up with Charlie. Charlie was a young man in a white overcoat and a paper collar; it was for him, in the last analysis, that they cared much the most. They cared far more about Charlie than about the ballot. Olive Chancellor wondered how Mrs. Farrinder would treat that branch of the question. In her researches among her young townswomen she had always found this obtrusive swain planted in her path, and she grew at last to dislike him extremely. It filled her with exasperation to think that he should be necessary to the happiness of his victims (she had learned that whatever they might <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>with</b> her, it was of him and him only that they discoursed among themselves), and one of the main recommendations of the evening club for her fatigued, underpaid sisters, which it had long been her dream to establish, was that it would in some degree undermine his position--distinct as her prevision might be that he would be in waiting at the door. She hardly knew what to say to Mrs. Farrinder when this momentarily misdirected woman, still preoccupied with the Mill-dam, returned to the charge.|$|E
