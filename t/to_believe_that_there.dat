5|$|A young {{police officer}} whose {{instincts}} lead him <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is {{trouble on the}} horizon and is promoted to detective by Gordon when the elder cop saw something of himself within the younger. Blake represents the idealism that Gordon and Bruce Wayne once held, but soon lost in their battle against crime in the city. The film reveals his legal name to be Robin John Blake, a homage to Batman's sidekick in the comics, Robin.|$|E
5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) arrives late to {{the crime}} scene and John Doggett (Robert Patrick) tells her that the man's blood all drained {{abruptly}} in the hotel. A child’s bloody print is found, but Scully doesn’t believe that a child did this. Meanwhile, the beggar, somehow disguised as an ordinary-looking Caucasian man, applies for a janitorial job at a Cheverly, Maryland elementary school. In the morgue, Scully describes the massive stomach damage done to the body which leads Doggett to the idea of drugs being forcibly cut out of him. However, the man showed no sign of drugs in the blood tests and Scully tells Doggett that his time of death was 24 to 36 hours prior, long before he left India. Due to a discrepancy in weight, she begins <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a passenger in the corpse.|$|E
5|$|At the {{invitation}} of {{the director of the}} Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr, Bohr visited the Manhattan Project sites in November 1943. Groves offered Bohr substantial pay, but Bohr initially refused the offer because {{he wanted to make sure}} that the relationship between the United States and Great Britain remained a real cooperative partnership. In December 1943, after a meeting with Albert Einstein, Bohr and his son Aage committed to working on the Manhattan Project. Bohr made a substantial contribution to the atomic bomb development effort. He also attempted to prevent an atomic arms race with the Soviet Union after the war, which he believed to be a serious threat. In 1944, Bohr made several key points he believed to be essential towards international nuclear weapon control. He urged that Britain and the United States should inform the Soviet Union about the Manhattan Project in order to decrease the likelihood of it feeling threatened on the premise that the other nations were building a bomb behind their back. His beliefs stemmed from the fact that he was convinced the Russians already knew about the Manhattan Project, which therefore led him <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was no point in hiding it from them.|$|E

5|$|Construction of Buddhist temples, {{including}} Borobudur, at {{that time}} was possible because Sanjaya's immediate successor, Rakai Panangkaran, granted his permission to the Buddhist followers to build such temples. In fact, to show his respect, Panangkaran gave the village of Kalasan to the Buddhist community, as is written in the Kalasan Charter dated 778 CE. This has led some archaeologists <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was never serious conflict concerning religion in Java as it was possible for a Hindu king to patronize the establishment of a Buddhist monument; or for a Buddhist king to act likewise. However, it is likely that there were two rival royal dynasties in Java at the time—the Buddhist Sailendra and the Saivite Sanjaya—in which the latter triumphed over their rival in the 856 battle on the Ratubaka plateau. Similar confusion also exists regarding the Lara Jonggrang temple at the Prambanan complex, which was believed to have been erected by the victor Rakai Pikatan as the Sanjaya dynasty's reply to Borobudur, but others suggest that there was a climate of peaceful coexistence where Sailendra involvement exists in Lara Jonggrang.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{influential}} Positivists in Brazil was Lieutenant-colonel Benjamim Constant, a professor in the Military Academy. Although admired to the point of veneration by the young cadets, he was completely unknown to the public. Constant and other Positivist instructors inculcated students with his ideology. Gradually consigned to the background of the Academy's curriculum were military exercises and military studies of Antoine-Henri Jomini and Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz, replaced by a focus on political discussions and readings from Auguste Comte and Pierre Lafitte. The cadets soon became insubordinate political agitators. Even so, Positivists still expected to make a peaceful transition to their fantasy of a republican dictatorship and Constant, who had also taught the emperor's grandsons, met with Pedro II and tried to convince him join their cause. Unsurprisingly, given Pedro II's character, this proposal was steadfastly refused, and Constant began <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was no remaining alternative to a coup d'état.|$|E

25|$|In 1582, Friar Phillipe de Caverell visited Lisbon and {{described}} its customs; he mentions the Portuguese people’s {{love for the}} cittern and other musical instruments. In 1649 was published the catalogue of the Royal Music Library of King John IV of Portugal containing the best known books of cittern music from foreign composers of {{the sixteenth and seventeenth}} centuries, in which the complexity and technical difficulty of the pieces allow us <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> had been highly skilled players in Portugal.|$|E
25|$|According to some, {{his first}} arrest {{was not the}} result of anti-Hasidic {{agitators}} fabricating charges, or officials seeking extortion monies. An accusation was made on May 8, 1798 by Hirsh ben David of Vilna accused him of trying to assist the French Revolution, by sending money to Napoleon and the Sultan. Since this Hirsch ben David was untraceable, some were led <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was no such person as Hirsh and the authorities were attempting to stir up internecine fighting among the Jews.|$|E

Father Patrick Keegans, Lockerbie's Roman Catholic priest, was preparing to visit his neighbours Dora and Maurice Henry at approximately 7 pm that evening, after the aircraft wing destroyed their home; {{there was nothing left}} of their bodies to bury. Keegans' house at 1 Sherwood Crescent was the only one on the street that was neither destroyed by the impact nor gutted by fire.|$|E
25|$|It was in 1988 at {{a conference}} on {{randomness}} that Dembski began <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was purpose, order, and design in the universe by the intervention of God. Remaining in academia, Dembski ultimately completed an undergraduate degree in psychology (1981, University of Illinois at Chicago) and master's degrees in statistics, mathematics, and philosophy (1983, University of Illinois at Chicago; 1985, University of Chicago; 1993, University of Illinois at Chicago, respectively), two PhDs, one in mathematics and one in philosophy (1988, University of Chicago; 1996, University of Illinois at Chicago, respectively), and a Master of Divinity in theology at the Princeton Theological Seminary (1996).|$|E
25|$|The {{high level}} of {{similarities}} leads Crossan <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{must have been a}} common source. Similar to the reasoning behind the two-document hypothesis for the existence of a Q source, the percentage of common material found in Thomas and Q would suggest an earlier source shared by the authors of both documents. However, unlike Q, the Common Sayings Source is presumed to be oral, {{due to a lack of}} common order or sequence. This is not to say that a written document is an impossibility. It is clear in the Synoptic Gospels that it was common for authors to edit works for their own needs, including the slight change in the order or sequence.|$|E

25|$|This {{was also}} the belief of {{geologist}} Palmer, who convinced Steven Jones that the helium-3 occurring naturally in Earth perhaps came from fusion involving hydrogen isotopes inside catalysts like nickel and palladium. This led their team in 1986 to independently make the same experimental setup as Fleischmann and Pons (a palladium cathode submerged in heavy water, absorbing deuterium via electrolysis). Fleischmann and Pons had much the same belief, but they calculated the pressure to be of 1027 atmospheres, when cold fusion experiments only achieve a loading ratio of one to one, which only has between 10,000 and 20,000 atmospheres. John R. Huizenga says they had misinterpreted the Nernst equation, leading them <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was enough pressure to bring deuterons so {{close to each other}} that there would be spontaneous fusions.|$|E
25|$|Much {{recent work}} has been done to {{identify}} the underlying causes of conversion and related disorders and to better understand why conversion and hysteria appear more commonly in women. Current theoreticians tend <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is no single cause for these disorders. Instead, the emphasis tends to be on the individual understanding of the patient and a variety of therapeutic techniques. In some cases, the onset of conversion disorder correlates to a traumatic or stressful event. There are also certain populations that are considered at risk for conversion disorder, including people suffering from a medical illness or condition, people with personality disorder, and individuals with dissociative identity disorder. However, no biomarkers have yet been found to support the idea that conversion disorder is caused by a psychiatric condition.|$|E
25|$|There is {{significant}} controversy with the PIE and BICEPS principles. Throughout {{a number of}} wars, but notably during the Vietnam War, {{there has been a}} conflict among doctors about sending distressed soldiers back to combat. During the Vietnam War this reached a peak with much discussion about the ethics of this process. Proponents of the PIE and BICEPS principles argue that it leads to a reduction of long-term disability but opponents argue that combat stress reactions lead to long-term problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder. The use of psychiatric drugs to treat victims of CSR has also attracted criticism, as some military psychiatrists have come to question the efficacy of such drugs on the long term health of veterans. Concerns have been expressed as to the effect of pharmaceutical treatment on an already elevated substance abuse rate among former CSR sufferers. Recent research has caused an increasing number of scientists <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> may be a physical (i.e., neurocerebral damage) rather than psychological basis for blast trauma. As traumatic brain injury and combat stress reaction have very different causes yet result in similar neurologic symptoms, researchers emphasize the need for greater diagnostic care.|$|E
5000|$|For {{his next}} novel, Carr {{brought back the}} {{principals}} from The Alienist to solve another serial murder case in The Angel of Darkness, published in 1997. This sequel not only sold more copies than its predecessor, it received more critical acclaim. This time, the killer {{at the center of}} the hunt is a female murdering infants. The narrator for this adventure is Stevie Taggart, the street urchin Dr. Laszlo Kreizler saved from jail years earlier. When asked about the subject matter, Carr stated, [...] "You want <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>there’s</b> one relationship in life that’s beyond betrayal--a relationship that’s beyond that kind of hurt--and there isn’t. The simple fact is, if the mothers that we see in the press are doing this kind of stuff, then the numbers who are actually doing it are probably much higher." ...|$|R
50|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} confusion {{of the number}} of Popes John. There was only the one John XIV. However, by the 13th century, clerical authorities in the Vatican came <b>to</b> wrongly <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were two John XIVs and began to double-count John XIV accordingly. This led to a pope calling himself John XXI, instead of John XX, in 1276.|$|R

On the absence of the male lead of the show creator Shonda Rhimes in an interview said, “It was so interesting for me to discover that audiences, especially women, are so conditioned <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>there’s</b> a singular fairy tale that nobody stops to think that that might not be the definition of happiness.” Rhimes continued, “Meredith knew that already. We got to the point in the season when Meredith said, “I can live without you, but I don’t want to,” which for any woman is a very powerful statement. It means: You compliment me, but you don’t complete me.” ABC also pictured Grey’s Anatomy without [...] "McDreamy". The network’s president has said he hopes the show will continue for years after Patrick Dempsey’s alleged firing.|$|R
25|$|Trotsky led the Soviet {{delegation}} {{during the}} peace negotiations in Brest-Litovsk from 22 December 1917 to 10 February 1918. At {{that time the}} Soviet government was split on the issue. Left Communists, led by Nikolai Bukharin, continued <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> could be no peace between a Soviet republic and a capitalist country and that only a revolutionary war leading to a pan-European Soviet republic would bring a durable peace. They cited the successes of the newly formed (15 January 1918) voluntary Red Army against Polish forces of Gen. Józef Dowbor-Muśnicki in Belarus, White forces in the Don region, and newly independent Ukrainian forces as proof that the Red Army could repel German forces, especially if propaganda and asymmetrical warfare were used. They did not mind holding talks with the Germans {{as a means of}} exposing German imperial ambitions (territorial gains, reparations, etc.) in the hope of accelerating the hoped−for Soviet revolution in the West, but they were dead set against signing any peace treaty. In case of a German ultimatum, they advocated proclaiming a revolutionary war against Germany in order to inspire Russian and European workers to fight for socialism. This opinion was shared by Left Socialist Revolutionaries, who were then the Bolsheviks' junior partners in a coalition government.|$|E
25|$|Activity {{of these}} HDACs can be {{affected}} by phosphorylation. An increased amount of phosphorylation (hyperphosphorylation) leads to increased deacetylase activity, but degrades complex formation between HDACs 1 and 2 and between HDAC1 and mSin3A/YY1. A lower than normal amount of phosphorylation (hypophosphorylation) leads to {{a decrease in the}} amount of deacetylase activity, but increases the amount of complex formation. Mutation studies found that major phosphorylation happens at residues Ser421 and Ser423. Indeed, when these residues were mutated, a drastic reduction was seen in the amount of deacetylation activity. This difference in the state of phosphorylation is a way of keeping an optimal level of phosphorylation to ensure there is no over or under expression of deacetylation. HDACs 1 and 2 have been found only exclusively in the nucleus. In HDAC1 knockout (KO) mice, mice were found to die during embryogenesis and showed a drastic reduction in the production but increased expression of Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitors (CDKIs) p21 and p27. Not even upregulation of the other Class I HDACs could compensate for the loss of HDAC1. This inability to recover from HDAC1 KO leads researchers <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are both functional uniqueness to each HDAC as well as regulatory cross-talk between factors.|$|E
