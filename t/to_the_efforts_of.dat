5|$|An {{intersection}} {{named after}} Tesla, Nikola Tesla Corner, {{is at the}} intersection of Sixth Avenue and 40th Street in Manhattan, New York City. The placement of the sign was due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>of</b> the Croatian Club of New York in cooperation with New York City officials, and Dr. Ljubo Vujovic of the Tesla Memorial Society of New York.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, the Tower Building was renovated due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>of</b> the Æsthetic Club, Little Rock philanthropist Frederick W. Allsop, and the Works Progress Administration. It {{became the}} new home of the Arkansas Museum of Natural History and Antiquities, which had been located in Little Rock City Hall. The museum {{remained}} in the tower building for approximately fifty-five years. The area surrounding the Tower Building had been known as Arsenal Park when the first decommissioned and then later renamed City Park. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>of</b> Bernie Babcock, however, the city finally named it MacArthur Park in 1942 in honor of Douglas MacArthur.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, much of {{the area}} that is today's Cleland Conservation Park was {{purchased}} by the State Government, largely thanks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>of</b> Professor Sir John Cleland. Most of this land was combined in 1963 to create the park that extends eastwards up the gully to the summit of Mount Lofty and northwards to Greenhill Road. Waterfall Gully Reserve {{was added to the}} park in 1972.|$|E
50|$|Wget 1.6, {{released}} December 1999, incorporated many {{bug fixes}} for the (by then stale) 1.5.3 release, largely thanks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> <b>of</b> Dan Harkless.|$|R

30|$|Phishing refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> <b>of</b> posting {{personal}} information, usually financial {{in nature}} relating to {{bank accounts and}} credit cards, using a false pretext as bait. Phishing attempts typically send a spam email.|$|R
5|$|In 1985, {{much to the}} nation's surprise, the Hanshin Tigers {{faced the}} Seibu Lions and took their first and only victory in the Japan Series, largely due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>of</b> star slugger Randy Bass (presently State Senator from Oklahoma), an American playing for the team.|$|E
5|$|In {{another book}} of the same name, John Cooley uses the term to refer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>of</b> a state's {{monetary}} authorities to protect its currency from forgers, whether they are simple criminals or agents of foreign governments trying to devalue a currency and cause excess inflation against the home government's wishes.|$|E
5|$|In {{modern times}} saffron {{cultivation}} {{has spread to}} Afghanistan due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>of</b> the European Union and the United Kingdom. Together they promote saffron cultivation among impoverished and cash-strapped Afghan farmers as an ideal alternative to lucrativeand illicitopium production.|$|E

50|$|Hastad and Näslund proved KFB to {{be secure}} {{in terms of the}} theorems of {{complexity}} theory introduced by Blum, Micali, Levin and Goldreich, giving a quantitative relation between <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> <b>of</b> distinguishing <b>the</b> keystream from true randomness <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> <b>of</b> retrieving <b>the</b> secret key.|$|R
5|$|Nuyts was {{released}} from captivity in 1636, most likely due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>of</b> François Caron, who knew Nuyts from serving as his interpreter during the unsuccessful Japanese embassy of 1627. On returning from Japan, Nuyts was fined by the VOC, before being dishonorably dismissed from the company and {{sent back to the}} Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth of}} Syracuse University {{from a small}} liberal arts college into a major {{comprehensive}} university were due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>of</b> two men, Chancellor James Day and John Archbold. James Roscoe Day was serving the Calvary Church in New York City where he befriended Archbold. Together, the two dynamic figures would oversee {{the first of two}} great periods of campus renewal in Syracuse's history.|$|E
5|$|According to unverified reports it is {{believed}} that St. Thaddeus was buried {{at the site of the}} St. Thaddeus Monastery in the 1st century A.D., and that St. Gregory was responsible for establishing a monastery here in the 4th century. However, there is recorded proof that St. Thaddeus Monastery dates to the 7th century. It was the second Armenian church to be built, following the Etchmiadzin Cathedral and was the seat of the diocese in the 10th century. It was destroyed in an earthquake in 1319 and was rebuilt due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>of</b> Bishop Zachariah in the 1320s.|$|E
50|$|The skeletons were {{displayed}} briefly in {{public for the}} first time in September 2011 at the entrance of Mantua's Archaeological Museum, thanks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> association Lovers in Mantua which is seeking a permanent home for the ancient couple.|$|R
50|$|The Tecnopole {{was born}} in 1992 thanks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Xunta de Galicia, that {{had the support of}} the three Galician Universities, the Deputation of Ourense, the councils of Ourense and San Cibrao das Viñas and other institutions.|$|R
50|$|The fung shui forest {{still exists}} thanks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> villagers in <b>the</b> past <b>to</b> use every means to {{preserve}} it, such as {{limiting the number}} of days for fuel wood collection and imposing penalties for the damage of trees.|$|R
5|$|After Manzikert, {{a partial}} {{recovery}} {{was made possible}} due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>of</b> the Komnenian dynasty. This is {{sometimes referred to as}} the Komnenian restoration. The first emperor of this royal line was Alexios I Komnenos (whose life and policies would be described by his daughter Anna Komnene in the Alexiad). Alexios's long reign of nearly 37 years was full of struggle. At his accession in 1081, the Byzantine Empire was in chaos after a prolonged period of civil war resulting from the defeat at Manzikert.|$|E
5|$|Alexander fled Macedon {{with his}} mother, {{dropping}} her {{off with her}} brother, King Alexander I of Epirus in Dodona, capital of the Molossians. He continued to Illyria, where he sought refuge with the Illyrian king and {{was treated as a}} guest, despite having defeated them in battle a few years before. However, it appears Philip never intended to disown his politically and militarily trained son. Accordingly, Alexander returned to Macedon after six months due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>of</b> a family friend, Demaratus, who mediated between the two parties.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1928 he was {{credited}} with developing several new camera angles. Cronjager was lauded by industry magazines such as Variety for his inventive camera work in 1928's Warming Up, which added realism <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>of</b> Dix as a baseball pitcher. In September 1928 Cronjager became involved in a minor controversy. The film industry was becoming unionized, and Cronjager was resistant to joining. When Dix insisted Cronjager photograph his next film, Moran of the Marines, the union threatened to strike if the cinematographer was hired without becoming a union member. Cronjager joined the union {{at the request of}} the studio, averting the threatened union action. Throughout his career, Dix attempted to have Cronjager as the cinematographer on his films.|$|E
50|$|The IPS {{operates}} the Indian Journal of Psychiatry whose chief editor is Dr. TS Sathyanarayana Rao. It has for once discussed the widely held practice of covert medication in its July 2012 issue of its publication due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> <b>of</b> Anirudh Kala.|$|R

5|$|Early in 1969, the {{pipeline}} crossed the Laotian frontier through the Mu Gia Pass and, by 1970, {{it reached the}} approaches to the A Shau Valley in South Vietnam. The plastic pipeline, assisted by numerous small pumping stations, managed to transfer diesel fuel, gasoline, and kerosene all through the same pipe. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>of</b> the PAVN 592nd Pipelaying Regiment, the number of pipelines entering Laos increased to six that year.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, the Castillonnais {{was officially}} {{recognized}} by the French Ministry of Agriculture, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>of</b> {{a small number of}} breed enthusiasts, though by that time only 50 purebred mares remained. The breed association's name was changed to L’association Nationale du Cheval Castillonnais d'Ariège Pyrénées (ANCCAP) (National Association of Castillonnais Horses of the Ariège Pyrenees), and is headquartered in Castillon-en-Couserans. Le Conservatoire du Patrimoine Biologique Régional de Midi-Pyrénées (Conservatory of the Biological Heritage of the Midi-Pyrénées Region), an organization that has worked to protect the diversity of animal species in the region since 1980, is also committed to protecting the breed.|$|E
5|$|In {{large part}} due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>of</b> the organization, {{heritage}} turkey populations have {{increased more than}} tenfold in little over a decade, and several breeds that once stood {{on the brink of}} extinction now maintain healthy populations. The organization also sustains programs that deal with preserving and promoting endangered cattle and pig breeds, as well as breed-specific programs relating to many of its livestock categories. Breeds that the Conservancy has assisted in saving include the Carolina Marsh Tacky horse, Randall cattle, Red Wattle hogs and the American rabbit.|$|E

50|$|The women's {{section was}} closed in 2012. The club's {{president}} Luis Oliveira closed down the women's {{team and the}} men's futsal team because an alleged lack of sponsorship meant they were not self-sustaining. It was attributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> <b>of</b> holding male star player Neymar at Santos.|$|R
5|$|In {{the fourth}} phase, low-lying casemates {{were added to}} the western and southwestern {{curtains}} to provide an additional platform for al-Rahba's defenders to use. The walls, particularly on the eastern side, were reinforced in the fifth phase, which Paillet attributes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>of</b> Shirkuh II and his Ayyubid contemporaries to strengthen the fortresses of Syria. The building technique used in this phase likely necessitated significant funds, equipment and technical expertise. Several changes were made including the southeastern tower being rebuilt and the northeastern tower being reinforced by an additional wall and a vaulted story. Moreover, the northern slope of the outer wall was further strengthened with a glacis built from large conglomerate blocks. A building in the center of al-Rahba was erected during this phase, likely replacing an older structure or a courtyard.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, {{political}} {{forces in the}} Northwestern United States generally favored private development of hydroelectric dams along the Columbia. But the overwhelming victories of gubernatorial candidate George W. Joseph in the 1930 Republican primary, and later his law partner Julius Meier, were understood to demonstrate strong public support for public ownership of dams. In 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed a bill that enabled {{the construction of the}} Bonneville and Grand Coulee dams as public works projects. The legislation was attributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>of</b> Oregon Senator Charles McNary, Washington Senator Clarence Dill, and Oregon Congressman Charles Martin, among others.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1960s, jazz began {{incorporating}} {{elements of}} rock music, and began using distortion and feedback, partially due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>of</b> Jimi Hendrix, who had strong links with jazz. The proto-punk band MC5 also used feedback and loudness and {{was inspired by}} the avant-garde jazz movement. Jazz musicians who have incorporated noise elements, feedback and distortion include Bill Frisell, David Krakauer Cecil Taylor, Gábor Szabó, Garnett Brown, Grachan Moncur III, Jackie McLean, John Abercrombie, John McLaughlin, Joseph Bowie, Larry Coryell, McCo Tyner, Ornette Coleman, Pat Metheny, Phil Minton, Roswell Rudd, and Scott Henderson.|$|E

50|$|The {{construction}} of the walls dragged until 1163: in that year, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> international political situation, and particularly the relations with emperor Frederick Barbarossa led to an acceleration of work, as Caffaro vouched for, and in fifty-three days the works were completed, thanks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entire population.|$|R
