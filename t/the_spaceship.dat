25|$|Let A and B be {{the rear}} and front <b>spaceships.</b> In <b>the</b> frame of <b>the</b> <b>spaceships,</b> each <b>spaceship</b> sees <b>the</b> other <b>spaceship</b> doing <b>the</b> same thing that it is doing. A says that B has the same {{acceleration}} that he has, and B sees that A matches her every move. So <b>the</b> <b>spaceships</b> stay <b>the</b> same distance apart, and the string does not break.|$|R
40|$|Unravelling {{apparent}} paradoxes {{has proven}} to be a powerful tool for understanding the complexities of special relativity. In this paper, we focus upon one such paradox, namely Bell's <b>spaceship</b> paradox, examining <b>the</b> relative motion of two uniformly accelerating <b>spaceships.</b> We consider <b>the</b> view from either <b>spaceship,</b> with <b>the</b> exchange of photons between the two. This recovers the well known result that <b>the</b> leading <b>spaceship</b> loses sight of <b>the</b> trailing <b>spaceship</b> as it is redshifted and disappears behind what is known as the `Rindler horizon'. An immediate impact of this is that if either spaceship tries to measure the separation through `radar ranging', bouncing photons off one another, they would both eventually fail to receive any of the photon `pings' that they emit. We find that the view from this trailing spaceship is, however, starkly different, initially, seeing <b>the</b> leading <b>spaceship</b> with an increasing blueshift, followed by a decreasing blueshift. We conclude that, while <b>the</b> leading <b>spaceship</b> loses sight of <b>the</b> trailing <b>spaceship,</b> for <b>the</b> trailing <b>spaceship</b> <b>the</b> view of the separation between <b>the</b> two <b>spaceships,</b> and <b>the</b> apparent angular size of <b>the</b> leading <b>spaceship,</b> approach asymptotic values. Intriguingly, for particular parametrization of the journey of <b>the</b> two <b>spaceships,</b> these asymptotic values are identical to those properties seen before <b>the</b> <b>spaceships</b> began accelerating, and the view from <b>the</b> trailing <b>spaceship</b> becomes identical to when <b>the</b> two <b>spaceships</b> were initially at rest.

5|$|Cowboy Bebop: The Movie is set between episodes 22 and 23 of the {{original}} series. The plot centers on a mysterious terrorist planning to destroy the human population on Mars using an unknown pathogen.

5|$|In Helena, Montana, Richie Szalay is {{chasing a}} spaceship. As <b>the</b> <b>spaceship</b> stops, it dumps {{a naked woman}} and cloaks itself. The woman is later {{revealed}} to be Theresa Hoese, who was abducted {{the same time as}} Fox Mulder (David Duchovny). Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) visit Hoese in the hospital to get information about Mulder's whereabouts.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} special {{agents of the}} FBI who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the {{investigations}} of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In this episode, when rubbings from <b>the</b> <b>spaceship</b> resurface the FBI hides its investigation from the X-Files. Meanwhile, Scully is forced to take drastic measures when she discovers a threat to William.|$|E
2500|$|The {{mathematical}} {{treatment of}} this paradox {{is similar to}} the treatment of Born rigid motion. However, rather than ask about <b>the</b> separation of <b>spaceships</b> with <b>the</b> same acceleration in an inertial frame, the problem of Born rigid motion asks, [...] "What acceleration profile is required by <b>the</b> second <b>spaceship</b> so that <b>the</b> distance between <b>the</b> <b>spaceships</b> remains constant in their proper frame?" [...] In order for <b>the</b> two <b>spaceships,</b> initially at rest in an inertial frame, to maintain a constant proper distance, <b>the</b> lead <b>spaceship</b> must have a lower proper acceleration.|$|R
50|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{traveled through}} the universe for {{many thousands of}} years and absorbed some of the magic of <b>the</b> stars. <b>The</b> <b>spaceships</b> eventually landed in a new world, creating the Star Gate in the process. The night when <b>the</b> <b>spaceships</b> crashed onto <b>the</b> new planet is remembered as fire night, when fire rained down from the heavens.|$|R

5|$|Another {{proposed}} space-related {{application of}} americium is a fuel for space ships with nuclear propulsion. It {{relies on the}} very high rate of nuclear fission of 242mAm, which can be maintained even in a micrometer-thick foil. Small thickness avoids the problem of self-absorption of emitted radiation. This problem is pertinent to uranium or plutonium rods, in which only surface layers provide alpha-particles. The fission products of 242mAm can either directly propel <b>the</b> <b>spaceship</b> or they can heat up a thrusting gas; they can also transfer their energy to a fluid and generate electricity through a magnetohydrodynamic generator.|$|E
5|$|Filming for {{the episode}} {{took place between}} 12 and 27 October 2005. The scenes set in Versailles were filmed elsewhere; the first scenes filmed in which Reinette's body is taken away from city were filmed at Culverhouse Cross in Cardiff, Madame de Pompadour's sitting room and bedroom scenes were filmed at Tredegar Housea 17th-century mansion in Newport, Dyffryn Gardens in the Vale of Glamorgan {{was used as the}} set for the palace gardens, and Ragley Hall near Alcester was used for the ballroom scenes. The scenes on <b>the</b> <b>spaceship,</b> which were shot by the second unit, were also filmed in Newport.|$|E

5|$|In the episode, newly wedded companions Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) {{are trapped}} on a {{crashing}} space liner {{which has been}} caught in a strange cloud belt. They call the Doctor (Matt Smith), who lands on the planet below and meets the miserly Kazran Sardick (Michael Gambon), {{a man who can}} control the cloud layer but refuses to help. Inspired by Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol, the episode has the Doctor attempting to use time travel to alter Kazran's past and make him kinder so he will save <b>the</b> <b>spaceship.</b>|$|E
5|$|Kritschgau and Skinner put Mulder under {{additional}} tests to verify his abnormal brain activity. They again inject Mulder with phenytoin, {{but this time}} they are caught by Fowley and Mulder goes into a seizure. Meanwhile Dr. Barnes, in a bizarre type of experiment, kills his driver, but the driver soon reanimates and kills him instead. Scully flies back to the U.S. and visits Mulder at the hospital.

5|$|On 6 December 2011, a prequel to {{the episode}} was {{released}} online. The Doctor (Matt Smith) is {{seen on a}} spaceship holding a red button which, when he lets go, will cause the space ship to explode. While holding the button, he has phoned the TARDIS to speak to Amy Pond asking her to rescue him, although {{he does not have}} his co-ordinates, Amy cannot fly the TARDIS, and she is not on the TARDIS. The Doctor wishes Amy a Merry Christmas before letting go of the button, and <b>the</b> <b>spaceship</b> explodes.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor {{leaves on}} his own to locate the Cybermen at the store but Craig shortly follows, {{bringing}} Alfie along. The Doctor finds <b>the</b> <b>spaceship</b> actually sits below the store, underground, accessed by a tunnel from a changing room. The ship has been slowly siphoning energy from the store's power lines, reactivating its crew. The Doctor is captured by the Cybermen, who tell him that their ship crashed long ago but, with this new energy, will soon have enough power to convert the human race.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} had to {{move the}} filming of the beach sequences from the previous episodes due {{to changes in the}} tides at that time of year. Similar to the previous episode, <b>the</b> <b>spaceship</b> was computer-generated. The sequence where the locals are boiled by the ocean water was accomplished using underwater filming of stuntmen under various degrees of make up. Fifty thousand dead crickets were rented from a local entomologist for the scene where Scully's tent was attacked by bugs. The live insects were portrayed by blowing popcorn and packing foam at Anderson with fans and editing it into insects in post production.|$|E
2500|$|The {{problem with}} the first {{argument}} {{is that there is}} no [...] "frame of the spaceships." [...] There cannot be, because <b>the</b> two <b>spaceships</b> measure a growing distance between the two. Because there is no common frame of <b>the</b> <b>spaceships,</b> <b>the</b> length of the string is ill-defined. Nevertheless, the conclusion is correct, and the argument is mostly right. The second argument, however, completely ignores the relativity of simultaneity.|$|R

In 2552, the Chief and Spartans return to Reach, where the UNSC High Command has developed a last-ditch plan to capture a Covenant High Prophet, who they hope could be used in order to barter a truce. The Master Chief's armor is upgraded, and he first encounters the artificial intelligence (AI) Cortana during a training mission. The Covenant arrive and invade, despite the best efforts of the Spartans and other UNSC forces. Aboard <b>the</b> <b>spaceship</b> Pillar of Autumn, Cortana plots a random course of escape. Seemingly the last Spartan alive, the Master Chief enters cryonic sleep along with the Pillar of Autumns crew.|$|E

When Chef learns that Kyle's brother was abducted and sees a machine emerge from Cartman's anus, he helps the boys escape from school by pulling the fire alarm. Once outside, Cartman reiterates that his abduction was only a dream, when suddenly he is hit by a beam, causing him to begin singing and dancing to I Love to Singa. Soon afterward, a spaceship appears. Kyle throws a stone and <b>the</b> <b>spaceship</b> fires back, propelling Kenny into the road. As he gets back up, he is trampled over by a herd of cows, but survives. A police car then runs Kenny over and kills him.|$|E
5|$|Corea {{explains}} at {{his website}} {{how he was}} motivated to work on music inspired by To the Stars, commenting that he {{was inspired by a}} scene from the book in which Hubbard describes the Captain of <b>the</b> <b>spaceship</b> in the story playing a melody on a piano. He had read the book eight or nine times, and after writing down musical composition based on Hubbard's work the album was created as a tone poem piece. Previous tone poem albums by Corea include The Leprechaun (1975), My Spanish Heart (1976), and The Mad Hatter (1978). The piece is Corea's first attempt at musical interpretation from one of Hubbard's works.|$|E
