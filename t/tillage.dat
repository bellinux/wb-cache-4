5|$|Mechanical {{pest control}} {{is the use}} of {{hands-on}} techniques as well as simple equipment and devices, that provides a protective barrier between plants and insects. This is referred to as <b>tillage</b> {{and is one of the}} oldest methods of weed control as well as being useful for pest control; wireworms, the larvae of the common click beetle, are very destructive pests of newly ploughed grassland, and repeated cultivation exposes them to the birds and other predators that feed on them.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the advent}} of iron {{reinforced}} plows and other improved methods of crop cultivation, the regional environmental conditions placed limits on the practicality and extend of land <b>tillage,</b> but various grains, beans and peas were grown. The dense forest coverage {{on the other hand}} facilitated gathering and was more amenable to the raising of farm animals, which involved all of the major species, including in particular the small, forest type horses. The horses constituted an important element of the Baltic tribes' culture – men of the upper socioeconomic status were often buried with their horses and even together with their fancy horsemanship gear.|$|E
5|$|The Przeworsk culture {{people of}} the earlier Roman period lived in small, {{unprotected}} villages, populated each by a few dozen residents at most, made up of several houses, usually set partially below the ground level (semi-sunken), each covering an area of 8–22 square meters. They knew how to dig and build wells, so the settlements didn't have to be located near bodies of water. Thirteen 2nd century wells with variously constructed timber lined walls were found at a settlement in Stanisławice, Bochnia County. Fields were being used for crop cultivation {{for a while and}} then as pastures, when animal excrement helped the soil regain fertility. Once iron share plows were introduced the fields were alternated between <b>tillage</b> and grazing.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{archaeologists have}} {{unearthed}} Han iron farming tools throughout China, from Inner Mongolia {{in the north}} to Yunnan in the south. The spade, shovel, pick, and plow were used for <b>tillage,</b> the hoe for weeding, the rake for loosening the soil, and the sickle for harvesting crops. Depending on their size, Han plows were driven by either one ox or two oxen. Oxen were also used to pull the three-legged iron seed drill (invented in Han China by the 2nd century BCE), which enabled farmers to plant seeds in precise rows instead of casting them out by hand. While artwork of the Wei (220–265 CE) and Jin (265–420 CE) periods show use of the harrow for breaking up chunks of soil after plowing, it perhaps first appeared in China during the Eastern Han (25–220 CE). Irrigation works for agriculture included the use of water wells, artificial ponds and embankments, dams, canals, and sluice gates.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{damage is}} being done today to the {{semi-arid}} areas that rim deserts and about twelve million hectares of land are being turned to desert each year. Desertification is caused by such factors as drought, climatic shifts, <b>tillage</b> for agriculture, overgrazing and deforestation. Vegetation {{plays a major role}} in determining the composition of the soil. In many environments, the rate of erosion and run off increases dramatically with reduced vegetation cover. Unprotected dry surfaces tend to be blown away by the wind or be washed away by flash floods, leaving infertile soil layers that bake in the sun and become unproductive hardpan. Although overgrazing has historically been considered to be a cause of desertification, there is some evidence that wild and domesticated animals actually improve fertility and vegetation cover, and that their removal encourages erosive processes.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} seventeenth century famine was {{relatively}} common, with four periods of famine prices between 1620 and 1625. The English invasions of the 1640s {{had a profound}} impact on the Scottish economy, with the destruction of crops and the disruption of markets resulting in some of the most rapid price rises of the century. Under the Commonwealth, the country was relatively highly taxed, but gained access to English markets. After the Restoration the formal frontier with England was re-established, along with its customs duties. Economic conditions were generally favourable from 1660 to 1688, as land owners promoted better <b>tillage</b> and cattle-raising. The monopoly of royal burghs over foreign trade was partially ended by and Act of 1672, leaving them with the old luxuries of wines, silk, spices and dyes and opening up trade of increasingly significant salt, coal, corn and hides and imports from the Americas. The English Navigation Acts limited the ability of the Scots to engage in what would have been lucrative trading with England's growing colonies, but these were often circumvented, with Glasgow becoming an increasingly important commercial centre, opening up trade with the American colonies: importing sugar from the West Indies and tobacco from Virginia and Maryland. Exports across the Atlantic included linen, woollen goods, coal and grindstones. The English protective tariffs on salt and cattle were harder to disregard and probably placed greater limitations on the Scottish economy, despite attempts of the King to have them overturned. Scottish attempts to counter this with tariffs of their own were largely unsuccessful, as Scotland had relatively few vital exports to protect. Attempts by the Privy Council to build up luxury industries in cloth mills, soap works, sugar boiling houses, gunpowder and paper works, also proved largely unsuccessful. However, by the end of the century the drovers roads, on which black cattle were driven from the Highlands through south-west Scotland to north-east England, had become firmly established.|$|E

The English protective tariffs on salt and cattle were harder to disregard and probably placed greater limitations on the Scottish economy, despite attempts of the King to have it overturned.

Scottish attempts to counter this with tariffs of their own, were largely unsuccessful as Scotland had relatively few vital exports to protect. Attempts by the Privy Council to build up luxury industries in cloth mills, soap works, sugar boiling houses, gunpowder and paper works, proved largely unsuccessful. The famines of the 1690s were seen as particularly severe, partly because famine had become relatively rare in the second half of the seventeenth century, with only one year of dearth (in 1674) and the shortages of the 1690s would be the last of their kind.|$|E
25|$|Allis-Chalmers {{offered a}} {{complete}} line of agricultural machinery, from <b>tillage</b> and harvesting to tractors.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tillage</b> is the {{practice}} of plowing soil to prepare for planting or for nutrient incorporation or for pest control. <b>Tillage</b> varies in intensity from conventional to no-till. It may improve productivity by warming the soil, incorporating fertilizer and controlling weeds, but also renders soil more prone to erosion, triggers the decomposition of organic matter releasing CO2, and reduces the abundance and diversity of soil organisms.|$|E
25|$|In {{the midwestern}} United States, low-till or no-till farming {{techniques}} are usually used. In low-till, fields are covered once, maybe twice, with a <b>tillage</b> implement either ahead of crop planting {{or after the}} previous harvest. The fields are planted and fertilized. Weeds are controlled {{through the use of}} herbicides, and no cultivation <b>tillage</b> is done during the growing season. This technique reduces moisture evaporation from the soil, and thus provides more moisture for the crop.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, Hasle bei Burgdorf still {{primarily}} {{lives from}} agriculture, especially dairy and animal husbandry; {{but there is}} also <b>tillage</b> and fruit-growing.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tillage</b> {{reduces the}} {{inoculation}} {{potential of the}} soil and the efficacy of mycorrhizaes by disrupting the extraradical hyphal network (Miller et al. 1995, McGonigle & Miller 1999, Mozafar et al. 2000).|$|E
25|$|Conventional {{agriculture}} practices, such as <b>tillage,</b> heavy {{fertilizers and}} fungicides, poor crop rotations, and selection for plants that survive these conditions, hinder {{the ability of}} plants to form symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.|$|E
25|$|Natural soil {{biogeochemical}} processes {{result in}} the emission of various greenhouse gases, including nitrous oxide. Agricultural management practices can affect emission levels. For example, <b>tillage</b> levels have {{also been shown to}} affect nitrous oxide emissions.|$|E
25|$|Proper {{management}} of AMF in the agroecosystems {{can improve the}} quality of the soil and the productivity of the land. Agricultural practices such as reduced <b>tillage,</b> low phosphorus fertilizer usage, and perennialized cropping systems promote functional mycorrhizal symbiosis.|$|E
25|$|Technological advancements {{help provide}} farmers with tools and {{resources}} to make farming more sustainable. New technologies {{have given rise to}} innovations like conservation <b>tillage,</b> a farming process which helps prevent land loss to erosion, water pollution and enhances carbon sequestration.|$|E
25|$|The {{expansion}} of <b>tillage</b> {{led to an}} inevitable {{expansion of}} the potato acreage and an expansion of peasant farmers. By 1841, there were over half a million peasant farmers, with 1.75 million dependants. The principal beneficiary of this system was the English consumer.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{competitions}} {{take place}} for ploughing enthusiasts like the National Ploughing Championships in Ireland. Use of the plough has decreased in some areas, often those significantly threatened by soil damage and erosion, {{in favour of}} shallower ploughing and other less-invasive conservation <b>tillage</b> techniques.|$|E
25|$|Eurasians domesticated {{goats and}} sheep for hides, clothing, and cheese; cows for milk; {{bullocks}} for <b>tillage</b> of fields and transport; and benign {{animals such as}} pigs and chickens. Large domestic animals such as horses and camels offered the considerable military and economic advantages of mobile transport.|$|E
25|$|The Environment of County Kilkenny {{contains}} {{a great variety}} of natural heritage, including rivers, wildlife (mammals, birds, plants), woodlands, hedgerows, and diverse landscapes and geological features. The main land use is grassland, dairy farming and <b>tillage</b> farming especially around Kilkenny City and in the fertile central plain of the Nore Valley. Conifer forests are found on the upland areas.|$|E
25|$|Improved {{habitat for}} pests. If fields are not left bare for {{a portion of}} the year, rodents and insects populations may increase. Burning of the stubble of {{perennial}} rice could reduce these populations, but burning may not be permitted in some areas. Furthermore, rodents and insects living underground would survive burning, whereas <b>tillage</b> disrupts their habitat.|$|E
25|$|The farm is now run {{using some}} natural farming {{techniques}}: no chemicals, no <b>tillage</b> {{of the land}} and no use of composting. Other techniques have been changed; the pattern of irrigation is more conventional to reduce conflicts with neighbours. A do nothing philosophy has been followed on the hilltop surrounding Fukuoka's hut. Here it has become a natural, fruit-bearing forest with minimal intervention.|$|E
25|$|Pest control {{includes}} {{the management of}} weeds, insects, mites, and diseases. Chemical (pesticides), biological (biocontrol), mechanical (<b>tillage),</b> and cultural practices are used. Cultural practices include crop rotation, culling, cover crops, intercropping, composting, avoidance, and resistance. Integrated pest management attempts to use all of these methods to keep pest populations below the number which would cause economic loss, and recommends pesticides as a last resort.|$|E
25|$|Ectomycorrhizal fungi do {{not play}} {{a large role in}} {{agricultural}} and horticultural systems. Most of the economically relevant crop plants that form mycorrhizas tend to form them with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Many modern agricultural practices such as <b>tillage,</b> heavy fertilizers, and fungicides have extremely detrimental effects on crops’ associated mycorrhizas and on the surrounding ecosystem. Thus, it is possible that agriculture indirectly affects nearby ectomycorrhizal species and habitats, such as increased fertilization decreasing sporocarp production.|$|E
25|$|Partly as {{a result}} of the trade laws being liberalised, Ireland went through an {{economic}} boom in the 1780s. Canals extended from Dublin westwards and the Four Courts and Post Office were established. Dublin's granite-lined quays were built and it boasted that it was the 'second city of the empire'. Corn laws were introduced in 1784 to give a bounty on flour shipped to Dublin; this promoted the spread of mills and <b>tillage.</b>|$|E
25|$|Builds soil {{organic matter}} {{at the expense of}} plant productivity. In the absence of <b>tillage,</b> and in soils with {{depleted}} organic matter, crops with large root systems may build up organic matter to the point that nearly all of the soil nitrogen and phosphorus is immobilized. When this happens, productivity may decline until either the organic matter builds up to a level where equilibrium is reached between nutrient mineralization and nutrient immobilization or fertilizer is added to the system.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture {{is still}} {{specialized}} in milk production and cattle-breeding. It delivers {{raw materials for}} the cheese production and meat treating. Most important is Gruyère cheese. Forestry is also a factor, but <b>tillage</b> is less applied. In secondary sector, there are cabinetmaking, precision mechanics and craftworks. Services {{has a lot of}} jobs to offer in gastronomics and hotels. The villages of Epagny and Pringy have in the last years become a living place for commuters, mostly working in the town of Bulle.|$|E
25|$|Slash-and-burn {{and other}} {{unsustainable}} methods of subsistence farming are practiced in some lesser developed areas. A {{sequel to the}} deforestation is typically large scale erosion, loss of soil nutrients and sometimes total desertification. Techniques for improved soil conservation include crop rotation, cover crops, conservation <b>tillage</b> and planted windbreaks and affect both erosion and fertility. When plants, especially trees, die, they decay and {{become part of the}} soil. Code 330 defines standard methods recommended by the U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service.|$|E
25|$|The Act defines {{agriculture}} {{to include}} farming (which includes cultivation and <b>tillage</b> of soil; dairy production; cultivation, growing, and harvesting of {{agricultural or horticultural}} commodities; raising livestock, bees, furbearing animals, or poultry; and/or forestry or lumbering operations), and includes all activities incidental to or in conjunction with agriculture (such as preparation for market, transportation, or storage). Employees are defined in the Act, but the definition excludes anyone engaged in construction, painting, building repair,or land moving operations unrelated to the preparation of land for cultivation.|$|E
25|$|When {{agriculture}} {{was first}} developed, simple hand-held digging sticks and hoes {{were used in}} highly fertile areas, such as {{the banks of the}} Nile where the annual flood rejuvenates the soil, to create drills (furrows) to plant seeds in. Digging sticks, hoes, and mattocks were not invented in any one place, and hoe-cultivation must have been common everywhere agriculture was practiced. Hoe-farming is the traditional <b>tillage</b> method in tropical or sub-tropical regions, which are characterised by stony soils, steep slope gradients, predominant root crops, and coarse grains grown at wide distances apart. While hoe-agriculture is best suited to these regions, it is used in some fashion everywhere. Instead of hoeing, some cultures use pigs to trample the soil and grub the earth.|$|E
25|$|Right {{through to}} {{the first decades of}} the twentieth century, {{manufacturers}} continued to seek a solution to realise the economic benefits of direct-pull ploughing and, particularly in North America, this led to the American development of the steam tractor. British companies such as Mann's and Garrett developed potentially viable direct ploughing engines, however market conditions were against them and they failed to gain widespread popularity. These market conditions arose in the wake of the First World War when there was a glut of surplus equipment available as a result of British Government policy. Large numbers of Fowler ploughing engines had been constructed in order to increase the land under <b>tillage</b> during the war and many new light Fordson F tractors had been imported from 1917 onwards.|$|E
25|$|In the {{following}} years Wang realised a far-reaching development plan. He tried to bring more workers into the booming Manchurian economy. Most had come on a temporary basis, returning to their homes in north China in winter. The Manchurian government now encouraged them to bring women and children, and settle permanently. As an incentive, they were made eligible for reduced fares on all Chinese-owned railways in Manchuria, received funds to build a dwelling and were promised total ownership {{after five years of}} continuous occupation. Rent for the land was canceled for the first years. Most were sent to the interior of Manchuria, where they reclaimed land for agriculture, or worked in forestry or mines. Between 1924-29 the amount of land under <b>tillage</b> increased from 20 to 35 million acres (80,000 to 140,000km²).|$|E
25|$|A 2006 United States Department of Agriculture {{report found}} the {{adoption}} of genetically engineered (GE) soy, corn and cotton reduced the amount of pesticides used overall, but did result in a slightly greater amount of herbicides used for soy specifically. The use of GE soy was also associated with greater conservation <b>tillage,</b> indirectly leading to better soil conservation, as well as increased income from off-farming sources due to the greater ease with which the crops can be managed. Though the overall estimated benefits of {{the adoption of}} GE soybeans in the United States was $310million, the majority of this benefit was experienced by the companies selling the seeds (40%), followed by biotechnology firms (28%) and farmers (20%). The patent on glyphosate-tolerant soybeans expired in 2014, so benefits {{can be expected to}} shift.|$|E
25|$|The {{chisel plough}} {{is a common}} tool to get deep <b>tillage</b> (prepared land) with limited soil disruption. The main {{function}} of this plough is to loosen and aerate the soils while leaving crop residue {{at the top of}} the soil. This plough can be used to reduce the effects of compaction and to help break up ploughpan and hardpan. Unlike many other ploughs the chisel will not invert or turn the soil. This characteristic has made it a useful addition to no-till and low-till farming practices that attempt to maximise the erosion-prevention benefits of keeping organic matter and farming residues present on the soil surface through the year. Because of these attributes, the use of a chisel plough is considered by some to be more sustainable than other types of plough, such as the mouldboard plough.|$|E
25|$|Feeding {{more than}} six billion human bodies takes a heavy toll on the Earth’s resources. This begins with the {{appropriation}} of about 38% of the Earth’s land surface and about 20% of its net primary productivity. Added to this are the resource-hungry activities of industrial agribusiness – everything from the crop need for irrigation water, synthetic fertilizers and pesticides to the resource costs of food packaging, transport (now {{a major part of}} global trade) and retail. Food is essential to life. But the list of environmental costs of food production is a long one: topsoil depletion, erosion and conversion to desert from constant <b>tillage</b> of annual crops; overgrazing; salinization; sodification; waterlogging; high levels of fossil fuel use; reliance on inorganic fertilisers and synthetic organic pesticides; reductions in genetic diversity by the mass use of monocultures; water resource depletion; pollution of waterbodies by run-off and groundwater contamination; social problems including the decline of family farms and weakening of rural communities.|$|E
25|$|In the Punjab {{region of}} India and Pakistan, {{as well as}} North China, {{irrigation}} {{has been a major}} contributor to increased grain output. More widely over the last 40 years, a massive increase in fertilizer use together with the increased availability of semi-dwarf varieties in developing countries, has greatly increased yields per hectare. In developing countries, use of (mainly nitrogenous) fertilizer increased 25-fold in this period. However, farming systems rely on much more than fertilizer and breeding to improve productivity. A good illustration of this is Australian wheat growing in the southern winter cropping zone, where, despite low rainfall (300mm), wheat cropping is successful even with relatively little use of nitrogenous fertilizer. This is achieved by 'rotation cropping' (traditionally called the ley system) with leguminous pastures and, in the last decade, including a canola crop in the rotations has boosted wheat yields by a further 25%. In these low rainfall areas, better use of available soil-water (and better control of soil erosion) is achieved by retaining the stubble after harvesting and by minimizing <b>tillage.</b>|$|E
