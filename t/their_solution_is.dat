The idea of <b>their</b> <b>solution</b> <b>is</b> {{to guess the}} indexes of rows containing the leftmost and rightmost cells of the shape to be reconstructed, and then {{to set up a}} 2-satisfiability problem that tests whether there exists a shape consistent with these guesses and with the given row and column sums. They use four 2-satisfiability variables for each square that might be part of the given shape, one to indicate whether it belongs to each of four possible [...] "corner regions" [...] of the shape, and they use constraints that force these regions to be disjoint, to have the desired shapes, to form an overall shape with contiguous rows and columns, and to have the desired row and column sums. Their algorithm takes time [...] where [...] is the smaller of the two dimensions of the input shape and [...] is the larger of the two dimensions. [...] The same method was later extended to orthogonally convex shapes ...|$|E

[...] "This sort of thing" [...] being that uneasy, painful feeling, {{something}} like selfishness--one wishes almost that the thing would stop--it is getting more and more beyond what is possible--"If it goes on much longer I shan't be able to cope with it--but if some one else were seeing it at the same time--Bonamy is stuffed in his room in Lincoln's Inn--oh, I say, damn it all, I say,"--the sight of Hymettus, Pentelicus, Lycabettus on one side, and the sea on the other, as one stands in the Parthenon at sunset, the sky pink feathered, the plain all colours, the marble tawny in one's eyes, is thus oppressive. Luckily Jacob had little sense of personal association; he seldom thought of Plato or Socrates in the flesh; on the other hand his feeling for architecture was very strong; he preferred statues to pictures; and he was beginning to think {{a great deal about the}} problems of civilization, which were solved, of course, so very remarkably by the ancient Greeks, though <b>their</b> <b>solution</b> <b>is</b> no help to us.

5000|$|The hard {{problem of}} {{consciousness}} {{is the problem}} of explaining how and why we have qualia or phenomenal experiences—how sensations acquire characteristics, such as colors and tastes. The philosopher David Chalmers, who introduced the term [...] "hard problem" [...] of consciousness, contrasts this with the [...] "easy problems" [...] of explaining the ability to discriminate, integrate information, report mental states, focus attention, etc. Easy problems are easy because all that is required for <b>their</b> <b>solution</b> <b>is</b> to specify a mechanism that can perform the function. That is, their proposed solutions, regardless of how complex or poorly understood they may be, can be entirely consistent with the modern materialistic conception of natural phenomena. Chalmers claims that the problem of experience is distinct from this set, and he argues that the problem of experience will [...] "persist even when the performance of all the relevant functions is explained".|$|E

50|$|In these theories, regular {{problems}} involve convex functions defined on convex domains, {{and this}} convexity allows simplifications of techniques and economic meaningful {{interpretations of the}} results. In economics, dynamic programing was used by Martin Beckmann and Richard F. Muth for work on inventory theory and consumption theory. Robert C. Merton used dynamic programming in his 1973 article on the intertemporal capital asset pricing model. (See also Merton's portfolio problem). In Merton's model, investors chose between income today and future income or capital gains, and <b>their</b> <b>solution</b> <b>is</b> found via dynamic programming. Stokey, Lucas & Prescott use dynamic programming to solve problems in economic theory, problems involving stochastic processes. Dynamic programming {{has been used in}} optimal economic growth, resource extraction, principal-agent problems, public finance, business investment, asset pricing, factor supply, and industrial organization. Ljungqvist & Sargent apply dynamic programming to study a variety of theoretical questions in monetary policy, fiscal policy, taxation, economic growth, search theory, and labor economics. Dixit & Pindyck used dynamic programming for capital budgeting. For dynamic problems, non-convexities also are associated with market failures, just as they are for fixed-time problems.|$|E
