5|$|Aspirin is an {{important}} part of the treatment of those who have had a myocardial infarction (heart attack). One trial found that among those likely having an ST-segment elevation MI, aspirin saves the life of 1 in 42 by reducing the 30-day death rate from 11.8% to 9.4%. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> in major bleeding, but there was a small increase in minor bleeding amounting to roughly 1 in every 167 people given aspirin.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{characteristic}} tusks, the cheek teeth of derived heterodontosaurids were also unique among early ornithischians. Small ridges, or denticles, lined {{the edges of}} ornithischian cheek teeth in order to crop vegetation. These denticles extend {{only a third of}} the way down the tooth crown from the tip in all heterodontosaurids; in other ornithischians, the denticles extend further down towards the root. Basal forms like Abrictosaurus had cheek teeth in both maxilla and dentary that were generally similar to other ornithischians: widely spaced, each having a low crown and a strongly-developed ridge (cingulum) separating the crown from the root. In more derived forms like Lycorhinus and Heterodontosaurus, the teeth were chisel-shaped, with much higher crowns and no cingula, so that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> in width between the crowns and the roots.|$|E

5|$|Evaluative {{conditioning}} {{suggests that}} if the name is liked then the name letters will be liked too. This would occur through repeated visual association of the name letters with the name. Martin and Levey defined evaluative conditioning as a variation of classical conditioning in which we come to like or dislike something through an association. Given the observation that our own name stands out among others as quite an attractive stimulus, as Cherry found in the cocktail party effect, {{it could be that}} the name-letter effect results from evaluative conditioning. Feys set up a controlled study with Flemish subjects, pairing unfamiliar symbols (Japanese kanji) with subjects' own names, and with other names. He found that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> in how much subjects liked the kanji symbol representing their own name or other names. He concluded that evaluative conditioning is not the primary cause of the name-letter effect.|$|E

A 2011 systematic review found insufficient evidence for the cost-effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of chronic low back pain.

25|$|A popular {{notion is}} that people might not share {{extremely}} intense emotional events because they are simply inexpressible. Along with this idea, psychologists initially hypothesized that the extreme nature of such experiences would {{play an important role}} in determining whether an emotional event is shared or not. Additionally, they thought that people would be motivated not to deliberately revisit such events because they would reactivate the extreme negative emotions that accompanied the events. However, their studies revealed that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> in the average emotional intensity between events that were shared compared to those that were kept secret.|$|E
25|$|Few {{argued that}} <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> {{between the two}} worlds, but some were {{convinced}} that the difference itself was the primary danger. Charles Maynes worried that a military force consisting primarily of enlisted personnel from the lower socio-economic classes would ultimately refuse {{to fight for the}} goals of the upper classes. Tarr and Roman, on the other hand, were concerned that the similarities between military elites and civilian elites enabled a dangerous politicizing trend among the military. Chivers represented a small number who believed that the differences between the cultures were so small as essentially to be irrelevant.|$|E
