25|$|A {{few yards}} away from the Ordnance Survey's <b>triangulation</b> <b>point</b> on the Graig stands Lisvane's only Cold War nuclear bunker. During World War II the Royal Observer Corps (ROC) {{observation}} post stood on the Graig with its clear views over the village {{and the city of}} Cardiff. The volunteer ROC observers spotted many German Luftwaffe raids approaching across the channel and activated the air raid warnings in the Cardiff area. In early 1966 a protected nuclear fallout shelter (or bunker) was completed on the site for the ROC (OS Grid Ref: ST 1898 8508), who by the 1960s had switched from above ground aircraft spotting to underground operations with instruments to detect nuclear explosions and warn the public of approaching radioactive fallout in the event of nuclear war.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Triangulation</b> <b>points,</b> {{also known}} as trig points, are marks with a {{precisely}} established horizontal position. These points may be marked by disks similar to benchmark disks, but set horizontally, and are also sometimes used as elevation benchmarks. Prominent features on buildings such as {{the tip of a}} church spire or a chimney stack are also used as reference <b>points</b> for <b>triangulation.</b> In the United Kingdom <b>triangulation</b> <b>points</b> are often set in large concrete markers that, as well as functioning as <b>triangulation</b> <b>points,</b> have a benchmark set into the side. With the increasing use of GPS and electronic distance measuring devices, the same techniques and equipment are used to fix the horizontal and vertical position of a survey marker at the same moment, and therefore the marks are usually regarded as [...] "fixed in three dimensions".|$|R

2500|$|The Principal Triangulation of Great Britain was {{initiated}} by the Board of Ordnance in 1791 and carried out {{under the direction of}} William Mudge and Thomas Frederick Colby. The field work was completed in 1853, just as Clark joined the Board. The methods of analysis had been planned in outline by William Yolland, his predecessor {{at the head of the}} Trigonometric Section, but it fell to Clarke to finalize the methods and carry them through to completion. This he achieved in the four years from 1854 to 1858: the report was published as [...] but it is entirely Clarke's work. The basic data was the collection of angle bearings taken from each of the 289 stations towards a number of other stations, typically from three to ten in number. The multiple observations were first subjected to a least squares error analysis to extract the most likely angles and then the triangles formed by the corrected bearings were adjusted simultaneously, again by least squares methods, to find the most likely geometry for the whole mesh. This was an immense undertaking which involved the solution of 920 equations without the aid of matrix methods or digital computers. The only available computers were the living personnel of the Trigonometric Section, twenty one of them. Once the triangles had been fixed it was then possible to calculate all the sides of the mesh in terms of the length of either of the bases, one by Lough Foyle in Ireland and the other on Salisbury plain. The accuracy of the survey was such that when the length of the Lough Foyle base was calculated through the triangulation mesh from the Salisbury base the error was only 5 inches when compared with its measured length (of 41,640.887 feet or about 8 miles). The final step was to use the distances and angles to work out the latitude and longitude of each <b>triangulation</b> <b>point</b> on the Airy ellipsoid.|$|E

40|$|It is {{possible}} to measure a long distance with precision by using an electromagnetic wave. Recently {{the distance between the}} <b>triangulation</b> <b>points</b> can be directly measured with Laser Ranger. In triangulation surveying, the advantages claimed for an electromagnetic ranger are as follows : (1) In a large triangulation net, the length of the base line itself can be measured without making the short base line longer by a triangulation net of the base line. (2) It {{is possible}} to measure all angles and distances. (3) Distances alone can be measured, by which the co-ordinates of the <b>triangulation</b> <b>points</b> can be determined. The variation of ground strains can be observed by the above (2) method. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to make a comparison between the accuracy attained when each of the above three methods is applied...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} the present study are {{summarized}} as follows; (1) From the results of re-triangulation of the primary <b>triangulation</b> <b>points</b> in the central part of Taiwan, where the destructive earthquake of 1935 occurred, the horizontal strain components are calculated for each triangle having three adjoining <b>triangulation</b> <b>points</b> at their vertices. The geographical distribution of rotation, dilatation, shear, maximum shear, as well as the principal strains, are shown. (2) The mode of deformation is discussed on the basis of two different assumptions. The one that the deformation is continuous in the zone of active faults and the other that the deformation is discontinuous there. (3) In that region where the epicentres of the after-shocks were concentrated, the earth's crust was elevated in a marked manner, as it had already done in other districts. (3) A linear relation between the horizontal and the vertical disturbances was noticed, and its physical meaning considered.
