5|$|The last operatic {{music to}} be heard in <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>house</b> had been the finale of Falstaff, {{conducted}} by Solti with the singers led by Bryn Terfel, in a joint opera and ballet farewell gala in July 1997. When the house reopened in December 1999, magnificently restored, Falstaff was the opera given on the opening night, conducted by Haitink, once more with Terfel in the title role.|$|E
5|$|The new wing has six dormers (three on a side), and six dormers {{were added}} to <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>house</b> in the 1913 {{renovation}} (four on the east side, two on the west). The windows {{on the first floor}} of the new wing matched the old windows, but the windows in the second story of the addition have twelve panes in the upper sash and eight in the lower. As part of the renovation work, four new windows were placed in the 1850s house: two just west of the new wing, and two on the east wall of the lower part of the L. A small porch was added in the corner where the west wall of the new wing meets the north wall of <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>house,</b> and all the old porches were restored. In the original house two chimneys were restored and two replaced, and new fireplaces were installed in the living room, library, and dining room. The house has a total of 28 rooms.|$|E

5|$|Prior to 1821, the House of Keys had no {{official}} home, but met first at Castle Rushen, and {{later at the}} Bishop of Sodor and Man's library in Castletown. After criticism from a Royal Commission, plans were drawn up for a new meeting house for the Keys in 1813, but after concerns about the cost, they were redrawn and approved in 1819. The building, designed by Thomas Brine, was completed in 1821. It housed the House of Keys until 1874, when the Keys followed the other primary functions of the island and moved to Douglas. After their move, <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>House</b> became a branch of 's Bank, and later Parr's Bank. In 2000, Manx National Heritage acquired the building and began restoring the house to how it appeared in 1866. The building {{opened to the public}} as a museum in November 2001.|$|E
5|$|The {{remains at}} Jarlshof {{represent}} {{thousands of years}} of human occupation, and {{can be seen as a}} microcosm of Shetland history. Other than <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>House</b> of Sumburgh (see below) the site remained largely hidden until a storm in the late 19th century washed away part of the shore, and revealed evidence of these ancient buildings. Formal archaeological excavation started in 1925 and Jarlshof was one of two broch sites which were the first to be excavated using modern scientific techniques between 1949–52. Although the deposits within the broch had been badly disturbed by earlier attempts, this work revealed a complex sequence of construction from different periods. Buildings on the site include the remains of a Bronze Age smithy, an Iron Age broch and roundhouses, a complex of Pictish wheelhouses, a Viking longhouse, and a mediaeval farmhouse. No further excavations have been undertaken since the early 1950s and no radiocarbon dating has been attempted.|$|E
5|$|The Brownlow family, a dynasty of lawyers, began accumulating {{land in the}} Belton {{area from}} {{approximately}} 1598. In 1609 they acquired the reversion of the manor of Belton itself from the Pakenham family, who finally sold the manor house to Sir John Brownlow I in 1619. <b>The</b> <b>old</b> <b>house</b> was situated near {{the church in the}} garden of the present house and remained largely unoccupied, since the family preferred their other houses elsewhere. John Brownlow had married an heiress but was childless. He became attached to two of his more distant blood relations: a great-nephew, also called John Brownlow, and a great-niece, Alice Sherard. The two cousins married each other in 1676 when both were aged 16; three years later, the couple inherited the Brownlow estates from their great-uncle together with an income of £9,000 per annum (about £ in present-day terms) and £20,000 in cash (equivalent to about £ now). They immediately bought a town house in the newly fashionable Southampton Square in Bloomsbury, and decided to build a new country house at Belton.|$|E

25|$|The {{estate of}} Pockerley Old Hall is {{presented}} {{as that of a}} well off tenant farmer, in a position {{to take advantage of the}} agricultural advances of the era. The hall itself consists of <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>House,</b> which is adjoined (but not connected to) the New House, both south facing two storey sandstone built buildings, <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>House</b> also having a small north-south aligned extension. Roof timbers in the sandstone built Old House have been dated to the 1440s, but the lower storey (the undercroft) may be from even earlier. The New House dates to the late 1700s, and replaced a medieval manor house to the east of <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>House</b> as the main farm house - once replaced itself, <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>House</b> is believed to have been let to the farm manager. Visitors can access all rooms in the New and Old House, except the north-south extension which is now a toilet block. Displays include traditional cooking, such as the drying of oatcakes over a wooden rack (flake) over the fireplace in <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>House.</b>|$|E

25|$|Presented {{as having}} sparse and more old {{fashioned}} furnishings, <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>House</b> {{is presented as}} being occupied in the upper story only, consisting of a main room used as the kitchen, bedroom and for washing, with the only other rooms being an adjoining second bedroom and an overhanging toilet. The main bed is an oak box bed dating to 1712, obtained from Star House in Baldersdale in 1962. Originally a defensive house in its own right, the lower level of <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>House</b> is an undercroft, or vaulted basement chamber, with 1.5 metre thick walls - in times of attack the original tenant family would have retreated here with their valuables, although in its later use as the farm managers house, it is now presented as a storage and work room, housing a large wooden cheese press. More children would have slept in the attic of <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>House</b> (not accessible as a display).|$|E

25|$|In 1831 Hayter {{returned}} to England. His grandiose plan {{to paint the}} first sitting {{after the passage of}} the Reform Bill resulted in his painting 'Moving the Address to the Crown on the Opening of the First Reformed Parliament in <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>House</b> of Commons, 5 February 1833' (1833–43; London, N.P.G.), for which he executed nearly 400 portrait studies in oil. Hayter was an ardent supporter of the reform movement and this painting was not commissioned but to all intents and purposes a labour of love. It occupied him for ten years with no guarantee of financial reward. This {{is one of the last}} images executed of the interior of <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>House</b> of Commons before its destruction in the fire of 1834. The painting was finally purchased by the government for the nation in 1854, 20 years after it was started.|$|E

25|$|Cooper {{was elected}} to the Third Protectorate Parliament in early 1659 as member for Wiltshire.

Cooper again spoke out against the Other House (consisting of new lords), and in favour of restoring <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>House</b> of Lords.|$|E

Helen Graham, the central character, gets married for love to Arthur Huntingdon, whom she soon discovers to be lecherous, violent, and alcoholic.
