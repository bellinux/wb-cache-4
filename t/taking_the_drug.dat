25|$|Inpatient drug detox and/or {{rehabilitation}} facilities may {{be inappropriate}} {{for those who}} have become tolerant or dependent while <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> as prescribed, as opposed to recreational use. Such inpatient referrals may be traumatic for non-abusers.|$|E
50|$|Drugs contain {{side effects}} {{which is the}} reason why {{commercials}} or advertisements put many disclaimers about the unwanted symptoms after <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug(s).</b>|$|R

25|$|Harris {{wanted to}} join the United States Marine Corps, but his {{application}} was rejected shortly before the shootings because he was <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> fluvoxamine, an SSRI antidepressant, which he was required to take as part of court-ordered anger management therapy. According to the recruiting officer, Harris {{did not know about}} this rejection. Though some friends of Harris suggested that he had stopped <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> beforehand, the autopsy reports showed low therapeutic or normal (not toxic or lethal) blood-levels of Luvox (fluvoxamine) in his system, which would be around 0.0031-0.0087mg%, at the time of death. After the shootings, opponents of contemporary psychiatry like Peter Breggin claimed that the psychiatric medications prescribed to Harris after his conviction (ostensibly for obsessive-compulsive disorder) may have exacerbated his aggressiveness.|$|E
25|$|On January 30, 2006, a New Jersey {{state court}} {{dismissed}} a case brought by Edgar Lee Boyd, who blamed Vioxx for gastrointestinal bleeding that he experienced after <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug.</b> The judge said that Boyd failed {{to prove the}} drug caused his stomach pain and internal bleeding.|$|E
25|$|In 1975, Page {{began to}} use heroin, a claim {{attributed}} to Richard Cole, who stated that Page (in addition to himself) was <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> during the recording sessions of the album Presence in that year and that Page admitted to him shortly afterwards that he was addicted to the drug.|$|E
50|$|After {{a year of}} {{receiving}} psychiatric drug treatment Rufus May decided to stop being involved with psychiatric services and stop <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> <b>drugs</b> he was being prescribed, he then used exercise, creative activities, social relationships and voluntary work to regain his well being.|$|R
50|$|A {{study of}} {{pregnant}} women suggests those taking any type or amount of NSAIDs (including ibuprofen, diclofenac and naproxen) were 2.4 {{times more likely to}} miscarry than those not <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> <b>drugs.</b> However, an Israeli study found no increased risk of miscarriage in the group of mothers using NSAIDs.|$|R
50|$|One {{concern with}} the use of apixaban and the other newer {{anticoagulants}} is the absence of well-established protocol for reversal of their activity (no antidote is available). This is an important disadvantage relative to warfarin when bleeding complications occur or when people <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> <b>drugs</b> require emergency surgery.|$|R
25|$|Previously, {{doxycycline}} {{was believed}} to impair the effectiveness of many types of hormonal contraception due to CYP450 induction. Recent research has shown no significant loss of effectiveness in oral contraceptives while using most tetracycline antibiotics (including doxycycline), although many physicians still recommend the use of barrier contraception for people <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> to prevent unwanted pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} side effects are {{mucocutaneous}}: dry lips, skin and nose. Other common mucocutaneous side effects are inflammation and chapping of the lips (cheilitis), redness {{of the skin}} (erythema), rashes, peeling, eczema (dermatitis), itching (prunitis) and nose bleeds (epistaxis). Absence of dryness of the lips is considered an indication of non-compliance with treatment (not <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> as advised), as it occurs in almost all patients.|$|E
25|$|Oxazepam has the {{potential}} for misuse, defined as <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> to achieve a high, or continuing to take the drug in the long term against medical advice. Benzodiazepines, including diazepam, oxazepam, nitrazepam, and flunitrazepam, accounted for the largest volume of forged drug prescriptions in Sweden from 1982 to 1986. During this time, a total of 52% of drug forgeries were for benzodiazepines, suggesting they were a major prescription drug class of abuse.|$|E
50|$|According to Timothy Leary, {{a crisis}} {{can be a}} result of wrong set and setting. Leary advised that users of psychedelics be sure that they are {{comfortable}} before <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> <b>drugs.</b> Leary claimed that the frequency of difficult trips was highly exaggerated by anecdotes and fabrications in the popular press.|$|R

25|$|Pseudoephedrine may be quantitated in blood, plasma or urine {{to monitor}} any {{possible}} performance-enhancing use by athletes, confirm {{a diagnosis of}} poisoning or assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Many commercial immunoassay screening tests directed at the amphetamines cross-react appreciably with pseudoephedrine, but chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish pseudoephedrine from other phenethylamine derivatives. Blood or plasma pseudoephedrine concentrations are typically in the 50–300µg/l range in persons <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> therapeutically, 500–3000µg/l in abusers or poisoned patients and 10–70mg/l in cases of acute fatal overdosage.|$|E
25|$|In 1979, Sim, {{who was at}} {{the time}} a {{frequent}} marijuana user, began using LSD, <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> with such frequency that he was eventually hospitalized. It was this incident that Sim claims led to the inspiration to produce Cerebus for 300 monthly issues. The episodic adventures strayed further and further from heroic fantasy, and the twenty five-issue graphic novel High Society segued the narrative into a complex political satire and drama. With issue #65 Sim was joined by Gerhard; Gerhard's intricately rendered backgrounds became a visual hallmark of the comic.|$|E
25|$|Fluoxetine and norfluoxetine may be quantitated in blood, plasma or serum {{to monitor}} therapy, confirm a {{diagnosis}} of poisoning in hospitalized patients or assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma fluoxetine concentrations are usually {{in a range of}} 50–500μg/L in persons <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> for its antidepressant effects, 900–3000 μg/L in survivors of acute overdosage and 1000–7000μg/L in victims of fatal overdosage. Norfluoxetine concentrations are approximately equal to those of the parent drug during chronic therapy, but may be substantially less following acute overdosage, since it requires at least 1–2 weeks for the metabolite to achieve equilibrium.|$|E
50|$|In the 1950s new {{psychiatric}} <b>drugs,</b> notably <b>the</b> antipsychotic chlorpromazine, {{were designed}} in laboratories and slowly came into preferred use. Although often accepted as an advance in some ways, {{there was some}} opposition, due to serious adverse effects such as tardive dyskinesia. Patients often opposed psychiatry and refused or stopped <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> <b>drugs</b> when not subject to psychiatric control.|$|R
40|$|The {{incidence}} of accidents {{over five years}} {{in a group of}} patients who had taken benzodiazepines, phenothiazines, and antidepressants {{for more than a year}} was compared with that in control patients who had not been <b>taking</b> tranquilizers. <b>The</b> patients <b>taking</b> benzodiazepines had a statistically significantly increased risk of having an accident compared with controls, though this was not true when they were not <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> <b>drugs...</b>|$|R

25|$|Chlorpromazine {{is a very}} {{effective}} antagonist of D2 dopamine receptors and similar receptors, such as D3 and D5. Unlike most other drugs of this genre, {{it also has a}} high affinity for D1 receptors. Blocking these receptors causes diminished neurotransmitter binding in the forebrain, resulting in many different effects. Dopamine, unable to bind with a receptor, causes a feedback loop that causes dopaminergic neurons to release more dopamine. Therefore, upon first <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug,</b> patients will experience an increase in dopaminergic neural activity. Eventually, dopamine production of the neurons will drop substantially and dopamine will be removed from the synaptic cleft. At this point, neural activity decreases greatly; the continual blockade of receptors only compounds this effect.|$|E
25|$|Specific {{examples}} include levodopa (when {{used in the}} long term, as in Parkinson's disease), fluoxetine, metoclopramide, lithium, cocaine, venlafaxine, citalopram, fluvoxamine, methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), methylphenidate (used in attention deficit hyperactive disorder), and gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) and similar gamma-aminobutyric acid-inducing analogues such as phenibut. Bruxism can also be exacerbated by excessive consumption of caffeine, as in coffee, tea or chocolate. Bruxism has also been reported to occur commonly comorbid with drug addiction. Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) {{has been reported to}} be associated with bruxism, which occurs immediately after <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> and for several days afterwards. Tooth wear in people who take ecstasy is also frequently much more severe than in people with bruxism not associated with ecstasy.|$|E
25|$|When ingested, it {{is usually}} {{recommended}} that the more water-soluble, short-acting tetracyclines (plain tetracycline, chlortetracycline, Oxytetracycline, demeclocycline and methacycline) be taken with a full glass of water, either two hours after eating or two hours before eating. This is partly because most tetracyclines bind with food and also easily with magnesium, aluminium, iron and calcium, which reduces their ability to be completely absorbed by the body. Dairy products, antacids and preparations containing iron should be avoided near the time of <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug.</b> Partial exceptions to these rules occur for doxycycline and minocycline, which may be taken with food (though not iron, antacids, or calcium supplements). Minocycline can be taken with dairy products {{because it does not}} chelate calcium as readily, although dairy products do decrease absorption of minocycline slightly.|$|E
50|$|Toyia forcefully {{knocks on}} the door to Big Mama’s apartment. Crank let’s her in and Toyia says Cornbread is in jail and she needs to bail him out. She {{explains}} that Skillet is dead and there was a confrontation with Tony C. Cornbread got arrested with drugs on him. Toyia asks Crank to hold the rest of <b>the</b> <b>drugs</b> while she figures out what to do. She’s scared Tony C is going to search through her apartment or come after her and her baby. Crank refuses to <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> <b>drugs</b> but ends up holding it.|$|R
50|$|Some people <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> {{combination}} <b>drug</b> had elevated transaminases; <b>the</b> combination <b>drug</b> {{should be}} used with caution for people with advanced liver disease and liver function should be measured {{for the first three}} months for all people starting <b>the</b> combination <b>drug.</b>|$|R
50|$|In August 2009 Hunter-Galvan {{admitted}} <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> banned <b>drug</b> EPO three times, {{after failing}} {{a drug test}} on 23 March. She was banned from competition for two years from May 2009.|$|R
25|$|Current {{cannabis}} use {{was found}} to be significantly correlated in a dose-dependent manner with a decline in IQ scores, during the effect of the use. However, no such decline was seen in subjects who had formerly been heavy cannabis users and had stopped <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug.</b> The authors concluded that cannabis does not have a long-term effect on intelligence. However this is contradicted by the long term longitudinal study, carried out by Otago and Duke universities,which found that regular use of marijuana in teenage years affects IQ in adulthood even when the use stops. The drop in IQ was 8 points. Adults smoking marijuana had no lasting effect on IQ. Effects on fetal development are minimal when compared with the well-documented adverse effects of tobacco or alcohol use.|$|E
25|$|Codeine and/or {{its major}} {{metabolites}} may be quantitated in blood, plasma or urine to monitor therapy, confirm {{a diagnosis of}} poisoning or assist in a medico-legal death investigation. Drug abuse screening programs generally test urine, hair, sweat or saliva. Many commercial opiate screening tests directed at morphine cross-react appreciably with codeine and its metabolites, but chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish codeine from other opiates and opioids. It {{is important to note}} that codeine usage results in significant amounts of morphine as an excretion product. Furthermore, heroin contains codeine (or acetyl codeine) as an impurity and its use will result in excretion of small amounts of codeine. Poppy seed foods represent yet another source of low levels of codeine in one's biofluids. Blood or plasma codeine concentrations are typically in the 50–300µg/L range in persons <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> therapeutically, 700–7000µg/L in chronic users and 1000–10,000µg/L in cases of acute fatal over dosage.|$|E
25|$|The crow helps Eric locate Tin Tin; Eric kills him by {{stabbing}} him in each vital organ, {{in alphabetical}} order, {{with his own}} knives and then takes his coat. He then goes to the pawn shop where Tin Tin pawned Shelly's engagement ring the year before. Eric forces the owner, Gideon, to return the ring. Eric then tosses rings telling Gideon each {{of them is a}} life - a life Gideon helped destroy. He lets Gideon live so that he can warn the others and blows up his shop. Eric then meets up with Albrecht, explains who he is and why he is here. Eric finds Funboy getting high with Sarah's drug-addict mother, Darla. After killing Funboy with an overdose of morphine, Eric talks to Darla, <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> out of her arm seemingly by magic and making her realize that Sarah needs her to be a good mother. He later visits Albrecht, at his house. Albrecht tells him what he knows about Shelly's death and that he watched as she suffered for thirty hours before dying. Eric touches Albrecht and receives from him the pain felt by Shelly during those hours. The next day, Sarah and her mother begin to repair their strained relationship. Sarah goes to Eric's apartment and talks to him. She tells him that she misses him and Shelly. Eric explains that, even though they cannot be friends anymore, he still cares about her.|$|E
25|$|In the deposition, Cosby {{denied any}} sexual assault of any women but {{admitted}} that he had used sedatives to help gain their cooperation. He testified that he had obtained Quaaludes from gynecologist Leroy Amar, who knew that Cosby had no intention of <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> <b>drugs</b> himself.

40|$|Aims Capabilities of the cardiometric {{diagnostics}} {{based on}} the heart cycle phase analysis for identifying {{the primary cause of}} a disease are considered in this paper. Materials and methods An anti-androgenic drug was used by a patient as prescribed for prostatitis therapy. A week later upon <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> <b>drugs,</b> it becomes necessary to make an additional diagnostics of the patient to complete the basic diagnostic evaluation. The reason was that upon <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> <b>drugs</b> there were some cases of loss of consciousnes reported by the patient. During an examination by the treating physician, it was found that there was a syndrome of cold limbs in the patient. For the purpose of the additional diagnostics, the method of the heart cycle phase analysis was applied. Results The heart cycle phase analysis allowed identifying the primary cause of the patient’s health degradation and cases of loss of consciousness. Conclusion It was revealed that the primary cause was a side effect of <b>the</b> anti-androgenic <b>drug</b> that led to a decrease in the hemodynamic parameters, resulted in blood vessel failure to transport the necessary quantity of oxygen to tissues in the organism. The recommendations given upon the diagnostics were aimed at recovering the transport function of the blood vessels. By complying with the recommendations, the health status of the patient was recovered, and loss of consciousness was no longer observed. ...|$|R
