2500|$|MTV {{received}} significant {{criticism from}} Italian American organizations for Jersey Shore, which premiered in 2009. The controversy {{was due in}} large part to the manner in which MTV marketed the show, as it liberally used the word [...] "guido" [...] to describe the cast members. The word [...] "guido" [...] is generally regarded as an ethnic slur when referring to Italians and Italian Americans. One promotion stated that the show was to follow, [...] "eight of the hottest, tannest, craziest Guidos," [...] while yet another advertisement stated, [...] "Jersey Shore exposes one of the tri-state area's most misunderstood species... the GUIDO. Yes, <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> exist! Our Guidos and Guidettes will move into the ultimate beach house rental and indulge in everything the Seaside Heights, New Jersey scene has to offer." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dennis Mitchell — an importuning but lovable, freckle-faced five-and-a-half-year-old {{boy with}} a famous blond cowlick and a penchant for mischief. His long-suffering parents can only shake their heads and try to explain their son's antics to others. Despite this, <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> love him very much. Dennis's wide-eyed curiosity, his well-meaning {{attempts}} to help, his innocent, matter-of-fact bluntness, his youthful energy and enthusiastic nature always seem to lead to trouble wherever he goes (most often at Mr. Wilson's expense). He wears a blue/black striped shirt, tennis shoes, and red overalls with pockets that are sometimes filled with snakes, frogs, or his slingshot. He hates carrots and baths, loves root beer (especially with cookies), ketchup, water pistols, his teddy bear [...] "Teddy", getting into fights with other boys his age, mud puddles, and TV Westerns (especially those starring Cowboy Bob), and has occasionally been depicted wearing a cowboy costume. Dennis has a poster and an autographed picture of Cowboy Bob as well. In fact, {{he is such a}} fan that once a week he goes to the local theater to watch a Cowboy Bob western. A favorite TV show of Dennis's is [...] "Uncle Earl." [...] Among the running gags: Dennis has a soft spot for kittens and puppies, which he is always taking home to feed; Dennis loves loud instruments—such as horns and drums; Dennis ruins Christmas songs with shouts of cowboy songs or annoys adults by shouting out loud. Whenever Dennis is in the local department store trying out toys, such as tricycles, he ends up breaking them and his parents have to buy them. In fact Dennis nearly causes kindergarten teachers, Librarians [...] department store Christmas Santas, department store saleswomen, Drugstore salesmen, Hardware store salesmen, shoe salesmen, barbers, and the local post office workers to have nervous breakdowns when he comes around. Dennis also believes in the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus; another running gag is Dennis on Christmas Eve dreaming that he meets Santa Claus, and causing chaos for everyone else.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the topic}} of Sheila and Lauren's [...] "cat fights", Brown said: [...] "People like cat fights because we {{can get away with}} what you can't get away with in {{everyday}} life. You're living vicariously through me. There might be someone that [...] you just might want to put it to someday, and you can't, but you can turn on the TV and see Sheila do it, and get away with it. Being mean and evil and fighting {{and by the end of}} the day, you're spent." [...] On {{the topic of}} Sheila [...] "terrorizing" [...] both Genoa City and Los Angeles while on both soaps, Brown said: [...] "You know, I came to L.A. to start a new life. And well they just didn't make it that easy for me, did they? So I might've shot a gun once or twice again, but it wasn't my fault. You know what, people get what they deserve, <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>do.</b> I might've poisoned someone by accident, but he never should've talked to me like that. You just don't do that. Anyway, people get what they deserve, and I think a lot of them have what's coming to them, and I'm not sure I'm done yet." [...] About Sheila's personality, Brown said: [...] "Sheila's just evil. There's nothing bitchy about what she does, [...] it's very straightforward. She's manipulative but never in a bitchy way, in a way to get things accomplished, and get things done the way she wants to. When being nice and being diplomatic and when being all those things don't work any longer, she snaps." [...] On Sheila's relationship with Stephanie Forrester, Brown said: [...] "Stephanie made my life miserable. So anyway, I shot Stephanie. I did. Stephanie felt she could be a better provider for my child than I could. And you know what, you don't keep a mother like Sheila away from her child, you just don't do that. And Stephanie couldn't stop me." [...] Brown also added that, [...] "To be a good villain, you have to make the character real for you." ...|$|E

60|$|When it is said, then, {{that the}} Encyclopædists {{deliberately}} prepared {{the way for}} a political revolution, let us remember that what <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> was to shed the light of rational discussion on such practical grievances as even the most fatuous conservative in France does not now dream of bringing back.|$|R
50|$|Initially, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) {{advised the}} {{citizens}} of Iligan and Cagayan de Oro {{to prepare for the}} impact of the storm, as <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> not want a repeat of Severe Tropical Storm Washi, which had hit when people were asleep and, therefore, had caused a large number of deaths.|$|R

60|$|So far as {{any effect}} from these {{exposures}} was concerned, {{they were as}} harmless as those exposures of fraudulent spiritistic mediums which {{from time to time}} are supposed to shake the spiritistic superstition to its foundations. <b>They</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> nothing of the kind; the table-tippings, rappings, materializations, and levitations keep on as before; and I {{do not believe that the}} exposure of the novelist who has been the latest victim of the parallel column will injure him a jot in the hearts or heads of his readers.|$|E
60|$|And yet {{the men are}} in terribly wretched condition. I don't see {{how they}} can jump.

So weak are the men that they have no spirit left in them--not even the gangsters. And so afraid are they of the mate that <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> their best to jump when he drives them, and he drives them all the time. Mr. Mellaire shakes his head.|$|E

6000|$|But {{the centuries}} to come, {{of which the}} fluttering, {{chirping}} gentlemen are prone to talk largely, will {{have something to say}} in the matter.

50|$|Prick is {{the sixth}} studio album by the Melvins which was {{released}} in 1994 through Amphetamine Reptile Records under the name ƧИIV⅃ƎM.

6000|$|... "I don't know {{anything}} about it," [...] Francis said. [...] "Certainly some of the compliments I have heard paid were barefaced falsehoods, and I have wondered how men could make them, and how women could even affect to believe in them; but, on the other hand, I suppose that when people are in love, <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> think the person they are in love with is prettier and more charming, or braver and more handsome, {{than anyone else in}} the world, and that though it may be flattery, it is really true in the opinion of the person who utters it." ...|$|E
6000|$|But if the {{shepherd}} {{has no real}} claim to the title of [...] "producer," [...] who has? Are the rams and ewes the true [...] "producers"?

And yet, if strict justice is to be dispensed, even they are to be regarded rather as collectors and distributors than as [...] "producers."

If you see two women together, you may bet your bottom dollar they are discussing their own or their friends' clothes.

6000|$|... 'These {{presents}} are for {{the most}} part really good things. It is quite useless for kind friends to send presents to Melanesians as they would do to an English lad or girl. To begin with, most of our scholars are grown up, and are more like English young people of twenty or eighteen years old than like boys and girls, and not a few are older still; and secondly, no Melanesian, old or young, cares a rush about a toy. They, boys and girls, men and women, take a practical view of a present, and are the very reverse of sentimental about it, though <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> like a photograph of a friend.

It is a smaller species {{than that of the}} Atlantic, and more active and elegant in its motions. As they skim along the surface they turn on their sides, so as fully to display their beautiful fins, taking a flight of about a hundred yards, rising and falling in a most graceful manner.
