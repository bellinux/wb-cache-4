5|$|By mid-1950 {{after the}} {{successful}} landing at Inchon by the US X Corps {{and the subsequent}} destruction of <b>the</b> <b>Korean</b> People's Army, <b>the</b> <b>Korean</b> War appeared to be all but over.

50|$|The Japanese {{overwhelmed}} the defenses by scaling the walls {{under cover of}} the arquebus fire. <b>The</b> <b>Koreans</b> retreated to <b>the</b> second line of defense after the surprise attack of Sō Yoshitoshi.

After hours of fighting, <b>the</b> <b>Koreans</b> ran out of arrows. The Japanese were taking losses and regrouped to attack again.|$|R

50|$|After {{three days}} of fighting, Kim Si-min {{was hit by a}} bullet {{on the side of his}} head and fell, unable to command his forces.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Koreans</b> {{were unable}} to prevent the Japanese from {{draining}} the moat and thus having {{direct access to the}} defensive walls.

50|$|The Japanese {{charged and}} began to bring ladders to scale the wall. They also brought a siege tower to try to gain the higher ground.
