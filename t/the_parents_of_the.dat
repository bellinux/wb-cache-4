5|$|The {{most famous}} shrines {{in the city}} include Inaba Shrine, Kogane Shrine, and Kashimori Shrine.

5|$|Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{investigate}} {{the birth of}} five babies {{in the town of}} Martinsburg, West Virginia, who were born with tails. The mother of the most recent baby, Amanda Nelligan, tells the agents that the father of her baby is Luke Skywalker. By researching the baby's chromosomes it is discovered that all five share the same father. <b>The</b> <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> children blame the local fertility doctor, who had used insemination to impregnate all of the mothers but Nelligan. Mulder spots a janitor nearby with signs that he formerly had a tail. When he runs Mulder chases him and catches him.

5|$|Spanning World War II, when American comics {{provided}} {{cheap and}} disposable escapist entertainment {{that could be}} read and then discarded by the troops, the Golden Age of comic books covered the late 1930s to the late 1940s. A number of major superheroes were created during this period, including Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Captain Marvel, and Captain America. In subsequent years comics were blamed for a rise in juvenile crime statistics, although this rise was shown to be {{in direct proportion to}} population growth. When juvenile offenders admitted to reading comics, it was seized on as a common denominator; one notable critic was Fredric Wertham, author of the book Seduction of the Innocent (1954), who attempted to shift the blame for juvenile delinquency from <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> children to the comic books they read. The result was a decline in the comics industry. To address public concerns, in 1954 the Comics Code Authority was created to regulate and curb violence in comics, marking {{the start of a new}} era.|$|E
5|$|The Government's {{adherence}} to secularism {{has been criticized}} in that the unwritten principle of secularism has trumped the constitutional protection of freedom of religion. For instance, in 2002 a controversy arose upon the suspension of four Muslim girls from school when their parents insisted that they wear the tudung (Islamic headscarf) to national schools. Section 61 of the Education Act empowers the Minister for Education to regulate schools, including prohibiting students from wearing anything not forming part of an official school uniform. <b>The</b> <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> schoolgirls took {{the view that the}} Ministry of Education's school uniform policy was unconstitutional as it violated the girls' freedom of religion under Article 15(1). While the parents eventually did not pursue legal proceedings against the Ministry, the controversy showed the Singapore Government's steadfastness in insisting on secularism and the difficulties in reconciling secularism and freedom of religion in Singapore.|$|E

The possibility increases {{from less than}} 0.1% in 20-year-old mothers to 3% in those age 45. There is no known behavioral activity or environmental factor that changes the possibility. Down syndrome can be identified during pregnancy by prenatal screening followed by diagnostic testing or after birth by direct observation and genetic testing. More children are born with Down syndrome in countries where abortion is not allowed and in countries where pregnancy more commonly occurs at a later age. About 1.4 per 1000 live births in the United States and 1.1 per 1000 live births in Norway are affected. In the 1950s, in the United States, it occurred in 2 per 1000 live births with the decrease since then due to prenatal screening and abortions. The number of pregnancies with Down syndrome is more than two times greater with many spontaneously aborting. It {{is the cause of}} 8% of all congenital disorders.|$|E

25|$|Aztec {{marriage}} {{practices were}} similar to those of other Mesoamerican civilizations such as the Mayans.

Aztec marriages were initiated by <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> potential groom. After consulting with the extended kinship group, the parents would approach a professional matchmaker (ah atanzah), who would approach the potential bride's family. <b>The</b> <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> young woman would advise the matchmaker whether or not they accepted the proposal.

50|$|While {{during the}} pre-oedipal stages {{ambivalent}} feelings {{are expressed in}} a dyadic relationship between {{the mother and the}} child, during the oedipal conflict ambivalence is experienced for the first time within a triangular context which involves the child, the mother and the father. In this stage, both the boy and the girl develop negative feelings of jealousy, hostility and rivalry toward <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same sex, but with different mechanisms for the two sexes. The boy’s attachment to his mother becomes stronger, and he starts developing negative feelings of rivalry and hostility toward the father. The boy wishes to destroy the father so that he can become his mother’s unique love object. On the other hand, the girl starts a love relationship with her father. The mother is seen by the girl as a competitor for the father’s love and so the girl starts feeling hostility and jealousy towards her. The negative feelings which arise in this phase coexist with love and affection toward <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same sex and result in an ambivalence which is expressed in feelings, behavior and fantasies. The negative feelings are a source <b>of</b> anxiety for <b>the</b> child who is afraid that <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same sex would take revenge on him/her. In order to lessen the anxiety, the child activates <b>the</b> defense mechanism <b>of</b> identification, and identifies with <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same sex. This process leads to <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Super-Ego.|$|R
