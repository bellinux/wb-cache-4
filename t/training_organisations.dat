5|$|No.2 Elementary Flying Training School (No.2 EFTS) was a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) pilot {{training}} {{unit that}} operated during World WarII. It {{was one of}} twelve elementary flying training schools employed by the RAAF to provide introductory flight instruction to new pilots as part of Australia's contribution to the Empire Air Training Scheme. No.2 EFTS was established in November 1939 as No.3 Flying Training School at Archerfield, Queensland, and partially utilised aircraft and facilities of the civilian air <b>training</b> <b>organisations</b> based there. The school was renamed No.2 EFTS in January 1940. It was disbanded in March 1942, and its operations transferred to No.5 Elementary Flying School at Narromine, New South Wales, and No.11 Elementary Flying School at Benalla, Victoria.|$|E

Other equipment includes a diving mask to improve underwater vision, a protective diving suit, equipment to control buoyancy, and equipment related to the specific circumstances and purpose of the dive. Scuba divers are trained in the procedures and skills appropriate to their level of certification by instructors affiliated to the diver certification organisations which issue these diver certifications. These include standard operating procedures for using the equipment {{and dealing with the}} general hazards of the underwater environment, and emergency procedures for self-help and assistance of a similarly equipped diver experiencing problems.

25|$|A {{study by}} the UCLA Diving Safety Research Project {{suggests}} that about 20 successful repetitions of buddy breathing during training of entry level students are needed for a reasonable expectation of success without errors, and retesting after three months without reinforcing practice showed degraded performance and procedural errors.

25|$|Most {{recreational}} and professional diver <b>training</b> <b>organisations</b> would consider relying on buddy breathing {{from a single}} regulator as an unacceptable risk, {{as the use of}} a secondary demand valve (octopus) or second regulator, either from an alternative scuba cylinder, or from the primary scuba set, is a far more reliable and safe method of supplying emergency air to a diver who is part of a planned team or buddy dive, and a solo diver should carry his/her own emergency gas supply. There should never be a situation on a well planned and executed dive where two divers need to share a single demand valve, but the technique is still considered useful by some diving schools as it teaches control and hones skills under difficult circumstances.|$|E
