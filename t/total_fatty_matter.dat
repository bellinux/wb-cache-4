5000|$|Pears soap {{was made}} using a process entirely {{different}} from that for other soaps. A mixture of [...] "tallow" [...] and other fats was saponified by an alkali [...] in industrial methylated spirits. After saponification was completed, the resulting glycerol {{was left in the}} batch. Batches were made not in huge pans, but in small kettle-like vessels. As soon as the translucent amber liquid had cooled enough to solidify it was extruded into opaque oval bars that were cut into bath- or toilet-weight tablets ready for beginning their long spell in the drying rooms (ovens). The hot liquid soap fresh from the vessel had a <b>total</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>matter</b> (TFM) of 45% compared with the TFMs of 70-80% usual in soaps made by the conventional method. The TFM increased considerably as the alcohol content fell during drying.|$|E
50|$|<b>Total</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>matter</b> (TFM) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} characteristics describing the quality of soap and it is always specified in commercial transactions. It is defined as the total amount of fatty matter, mostly fatty acids, that can be separated from a sample after splitting with mineral acid, usually hydrochloric acid. The fatty acids most commonly present in soap are oleic, stearic and palmitic acids and pure, dry, sodium oleate has TFM 92.8%, while top quality soap noodles now increasingly used for making soap tablets in small and medium size factories, are typically traded with a specification TFM 78% min., moisture 14% max. But besides moisture, finished commercial soap, especially laundry soap, also contains fillers used to lower its cost or confer special properties, plus emollients, preservatives, etc. and then the TFM can be as low as 50%. Fillers, which are usually dry powders, also make the soap harder, harsher on the skin and with greater tendency to become 'mushy' in water and so low TFM is usually associated with hardness and lower quality. In older days in Europe and in some countries now, soap with TFM 75% minimum was referred to as Grade 1 and 65% minimum as Grade 2 and less 60% as Grade 3.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Emulsions, {{thermodynamically}} unstable mixtures, are dispersed {{systems in}} which one liquid is dispersed as droplets in a second immiscible phase. In most natural and processed foods, the immiscibility of water with lipids is overcomed by dispersing one phase as droplets into the other phase. The oil-in-water emulsions are highly stable. This is because some water-soluble surface-active agents and fine solid mineral particles are often adsorbed onto the oil droplets so that the emulsions are difficult to demulsify. In the present study we have determined some characteristics of oil-in-water emulsions obtained by three different types of oils: sun flower oil, olive oil and corn oil, and we have investigated the stabilization of these emulsions fortified with iron in the presence or {{in the absence of}} casein.

40|$|Microbially {{produced}} triacylglycerol (TAG) is {{a potential}} feedstock {{for the production of}} biodiesel, but its commercialization will require high yields from low-cost renewable feedstocks such as lignocellulose. The present study employs a multi-gene approach to increasing TAG biosynthesis in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. We demonstrate the redirection of carbon flux from glycogen biosynthesis towards fatty acid biosynthesis in a glycogen synthase deletion strain (Δgsy- 1). Furthermore, combining Δgsy- 1 with an enhanced TAG biosynthetic strain (acyl-Coenzyme A synthase; Δacs- 3) of N. crassa yielded a twofold increase in <b>total</b> <b>fatty</b> acid accumulation over the control strain. The cellulose degrading potential of this double deletion strain was improved by deleting of the carbon catabolite regulation transcription factor (Δcre- 1) to create the triple deletion strain Δacs- 3 Δcre- 1; Δgsy- 1. This strain exhibited early and increased cellulase expression, as well as fourfold increased <b>total</b> <b>fatty</b> acid accumulation over the control on inhibitor-free model cellulose medium.

The saturated, cis-monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acid contents were within the ranges of 16. 0 – 89. 0, 4. 9 – 41. 9 and 0. 0 – 23. 2 % of <b>total</b> <b>fatty</b> acids, respectively. Among the saturated fatty acids, palmitic acid (4. 8 – 48. 7 %) was dominant and its higher amount indicates that palm oil was the major contributor in the shortening manufacturing. The content of <b>total</b> trans <b>fatty</b> acids ranged from 0. 0 % to 48. 7 % of <b>total</b> <b>fatty</b> acids and the mean was 27. 4 %. Trans 18 : 1 isomers were the major group of TFA present in analysed samples, representing 94. 2 % of total trans isomers. The content of all 18 : 2 trans isomers ranged from 0. 0 % to 3. 6 % of <b>total</b> <b>fatty</b> acids. Among thirty-four analysed samples only six contained low level of TFA (0. 0 – 3. 1 %) while the rest contained very high amounts of TFA (10. 2 – 48. 7 %) which clearly indicate that partially hydrogenated vegetable oils are still the major raw materials used {{in the production of}} shortenings in Serbia...|$|R
40|$|Analysis of the <b>fatty</b> acids of <b>total</b> lipids of wild {{fingerlings}} (1 - 4 g) of {{sea bass}} (Dicentrarchus labrax) caught {{of the north}} coast of France shows that more than 30 % of <b>total</b> <b>fatty</b> acids consists of the two essential fatty acids eicopentaenoic (C 20 : 5 n- 3) and docosahexaenoic (C 22 : 6 n- 3) acids. One- and three-day old yolk sac larvae have even higher amounts of these two important fatty acids (about 40 %). On the other hand, laboratory-reared 60 -day old larvae had much lower concentrations of C 20 : 5 n- 3 (4 % of <b>total</b> <b>fatty</b> acids) and C 22 : 6 n- 3 (5. 5 % of <b>total</b> <b>fatty</b> acids). In larvae suffering from whirling or spinning disease the percentage of C 20 : 5 n- 3 was only 2. 8 % and only traces of C 22 : 6 n- 3 were found. These results {{emphasize the importance of}} these fatty acids for cultured sea bass larvae. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This study {{compared}} the fatty acid composition of subcutaneous biopsies of 324 weaner progeny by Angus, Belgian Blue, Hereford, South Devon, Wagyu, Jersey and Limousin sires mated to Hereford dams. The {{aim was to}} investigate sire genotype and sex differences in triacylglycerol fatty acids in a grass-fed management system. Results indicated that sire genotype and sex were significant sources of variation in individual fatty acids and summations of their proportions, while the effects of sire genotype by sex interaction and sire nested within sire genotype were not significant. Limousin crosses had the highest proportion of 18 : 0 and <b>total</b> saturated <b>fatty</b> acids, but the lowest proportion of 16 : 1 and <b>total</b> monounsaturated <b>fatty</b> acids. Jersey crosses had {{the highest percentage of}} 16 : 1 while Wagyu crosses had the highest proportions of 18 : ln- 9 and <b>total</b> monounsaturated <b>fatty</b> acids. <b>Total</b> polyunsaturated <b>fatty</b> acids did not differ between genotypes. Heifers contained higher 16 : 1, 18 : ln- 9 and <b>total</b> monounsaturated <b>fatty</b> acids but lower proportions of 18 :O and <b>total</b> saturated <b>fatty</b> acids than steers...|$|R
40|$|The {{method of}} {{experiment}} of acute pancreatic necrosis of dogs and classification of experimental cases were {{same with the}} described in Chapter I. The measurement was performed by the following methods <b>Total</b> <b>fatty</b> acid in blood and pancreatic tissue By van de Kamer's method. Total cholesterol of serum: By acetic anhydride method. Value of blood fat: by Kunkel's method. The following results were obtained: In the serious group, total cholesterol of serum and <b>total</b> <b>fatty</b> acid in blood increased markedly and on many cases, they reached the highest level before their deaths. In the medium and mild group, {{it was observed that}} both of them increased and did not reduce to the preoperation value in two or three weeks after the operation. The <b>total</b> <b>fatty</b> acid in the necrotic tissue of diseased pancreas increased as much as 200 ～ 250 %, compared with normal Pancreas tissue. In clinical cases, increase of blood fat was observed. I think the significant increase of β globulin of serum protein which described in Chapter II is due to the increase of blood fat...|$|R

40|$|Mucilage {{palm oil}} (M. P. O.) was {{obtained}} from physical refining step for crude palm oil. The components of M. P. O. were high content of free fatty acids (82. 2 %) with simple amount of neutral oil (11. 9 %), while the residual content (unsaponifiable matter and impurities) was 2. 1 % {{and in addition to}} 3. 8 % water. The results indicated that the colours of M. P. O., tallow and palm kemel oil improved after bleaching. Eight soap samples (n. os 1 - 8) were prepared from bleached fatty blends of mucilage palm oil, tallow and palm kernel oil at different ratios. The results showed that the moisture contents of soap samples n. os 2, 7 and 8 were high compared with the standard soap (sample n. os 1), subsequently their <b>total</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>matters</b> became lower than that found in the control soap (sample n. os 1). The findings marked that the unsaponifiable matter of soaps nos 2, 7 and 8 were higher compared with the other soaps. No high differences were observed in the free alkali of all soaps (range from 0. 06 to 0. 09 %). On the other hand, high differences were found in the free oil of all soap samples (n. os 2 - 8) compared with the standard soap (sample nos 1), except soap samples n. os 2, 7 and 8, which record very high. The best soap samples in the colour were in the following increasing order: n. os 1 > 3 > 4 > 5 > 6 > 7 > 8 > 2, respectively. The results showed that the better soap samples in the physical properties were in the following increasing order: soap nos 3 > soap nos 4 > soap n. os 5 > soap n. os 6 compared with the standard soap (sample nos 1), where from firm structure with high foam, while the other soap samples (n. os 2, 7 and 8) were poor quality (i. e., low lathering properties with deep colours). Therefore, it could be concluded that mucilage palm oil {{can be used as a}} new fatty material for toilet soap manufacturing at ratio of 40 % from the fatty blend. Mucilagos de aceite de palma (M. P. O.) fueron obtenidos mediante la etapa de refinación física del aceite de palma crudo. Los componentes de M. RO. tuvieron un alto contenido en ácidos grasos libres (82. 2 %) con cantidades pequeñas de aceites neutros (11. 9 %), mientras que el contenido residual (materia insaponificable e impurezas) fue del 2. 1 % además del 3. 8 % de agua. Los resultados indicaron que los colores de M. RO., sebo y aceite de almendra de palma mejoraron después de la decoloración. Ocho muestras de jabón (n. os 1 - 8) fueron preparadas a partir de mezclas grasas decoloradas de mucilagos de aceite de palma, sebo y aceite de almendra de palma en diferentes proporciones. Los resultados mostraron que los contenidos de humedad de muestras de jabones n. os 2, 7 y 8 fueron altos comparados con el jabón control (muestra n. ° 1), y por tanto su materia grasa total fueron menores que la encontrada en el jabón control (muestra n. ° 1). Los resultados señalaron que la materia insaponificable de los jabones n. os 2, 7 y 8 fueron mayores que las obtenidas de los otros jabones. No se observaron grandes diferencias en el álcali libre de todos los jabones preparados (rango de 0. 06 a 0. 09 %). Por otra parte, se encontraron grandes variaciones en el aceite libre de todas las muestras de jabones (n. os 2 - 8) comparadas con el del jabón control (muestra n. ° 1), excepto las muestras de jabones n. os 2, 7 y 8, las cuales registraron valores muy altos. Las mejores muestras de jabón en cuanto al color siguieron el siguiente orden creciente: n. os 1 > 3 > 4 > 5 > 6 > 7 > 8 > 2. Los resultados mostraron que las mejores muestras de jabón en cuanto a las propiedades físicas siguieron el siguiente orden creciente: jabón n° 3 > jabón n. ° 4 > jabón n° 5 > jabón n. ° 6 cuando fueron comparadas con el jabón control, ellos mostraron estructura firme y buena espuma, mientras que las otras muestras de jabón (n. os 2, 7 y 8) fueron de pobre calidad (esto es, bajas propiedades espumantes con colores intensos). Por consiguiente se puede concluir que los mucilagos de aceite de palma pueden ser usados como nuevo material graso para la fabricación de jabones de tocador en la proporción de un 40 % de mezcla grasa...|$|R
