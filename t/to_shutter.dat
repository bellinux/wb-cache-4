5|$|Accompanied {{in theaters}} by the Mickey Mouse {{featurette}} The Prince and the Pauper, The Rescuers Down Under (1990) was Disney's first animated feature sequel and the studio's first film {{to be fully}} colored and composited via computer using the CAPS system. However, the film did not duplicate the success of The Little Mermaid. The next Disney animated feature, Beauty and the Beast, had begun production in London but was moved back to Burbank after Disney decided <b>to</b> <b>shutter</b> the London satellite office and retool the film into a musical-comedy format similar to The Little Mermaid. Alan Menken and Howard Ashman were retained to write the song score, though Ashman died before production was completed.|$|E

25|$|By September, Sien had {{recovered}} from her difficult confinement {{and was ready}} to pose again. At the same time, van Gogh had discovered his orphan man, Adrianus Jacobus Zuyderland, who was to become his favourite and most patient model. With the winter drawing in and working outdoors increasingly difficult, van Gogh retreated to his studio and returned to drawing figures. He used the remaining canvas from his work in oils <b>to</b> <b>shutter</b> his windows and adjust the light falling on his models.|$|E
25|$|In August 1992, Maloof {{sold the}} {{franchise}} {{back to the}} league. At that time league officials asked former Green Bay Packers quarterback Bart Starr to help find a new ownership group in Alabama. On September 17, 1992, the NFL decided to place the WLAF on an indefinite hiatus. The owners stated that {{the decision was made}} <b>to</b> <b>shutter</b> the league at that time in an effort to save money to settle potential class action lawsuits brought about by players in the wake of Plan B free agency being declared illegal.

25|$|In March 2016, the St. Cloud school {{district}} reached a decision with the City of St. Cloud to relocate their district offices {{to the mall}} after a fire destroyed the school's previous headquarters. The {{school district}} had already leased space in the mall for alternative learning programs, but leased additional space to accommodate their needs. Other tenants that have taken residence within the mall include Old Country Buffet and St. Cloud's Department of Motor Vehicles offices, although the former business was forced <b>to</b> <b>shutter</b> following its bankruptcy in early 2016. Since the property's opening, their management offices have been located directly inside the mall. As of August 2016, the center contains a total of nine vacancies of the available fifty-eight tenants.|$|E

25|$|There {{was some}} {{speculation}} by financial analysts that the Dynegy-Ameren deal {{was a poor}} one. Julien Dumoulin-Smith, executive director of UBS Investment Research, said Dynegy is far more likely <b>to</b> <b>shutter</b> all five coal-powered plants rather than add pollution control devices. Dumoulin-Smith {{pointed out that the}} United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued final rules on sulfur dioxide emissions that go into effect in July 2018. Because the Edwards plant is in an area of low air quality, EPA is likely to force Dynegy to close the plant anyway. The remaining four plants are borderline cases with the exception of Duck Creek Station which spent nearly US$800m on sulfur dioxide removal, and may also be forced to close if EPA regulations tighten in the future (a highly likely possibility, he said).|$|E

500|$|Meiklejohn became Amherst College's {{president}} in 1912. Meiklejohn developed {{a legacy of}} autocratic treatment of faculty, drastic overspending, and that of a college hermetically detached from demands of the outside world. He was ousted after lying about faculty appointments, whereupon he opened the Experimental College at the University of Wisconsin, a two-year Great Books program with readings from ancient Greece and modern America. There, too, he treated the program as unaccountable to outside influence, and did not produce reports of their work or build rapport with the outside Wisconsin community. The program quickly closed for reasons attributed to Meiklejohn's obstinance and not programatic design. Meiklejohn then opened a Great Books adult education program in San Francisco where students similarly self-governed and led their own education. As funding dissipated {{at the outset of}} World War II, the students chose <b>to</b> <b>shutter</b> the school before [...] "compromising" [...] their ideals. Meiklejohn became an advocate of free speech as an absolute right differentiated from physical action. His stances on this and democracy influenced the United States Supreme Court and the aims of UNESCO.|$|E

[...] He had agreed to run on Ch√°vez's slate, but when a grassroots group of farmworkers formed their own slate to run against Ch√°vez's hand-picked board, Medina naively agreed to be on the challenger slate as well (believing that workers ran their union). He was dropped from the Ch√°vez slate, but after Manuel Ch√°vez (C√©sar's cousin) explained to Medina what his actions meant, Medina rejoined the Ch√°vez slate.

2500|$|Barboza has a {{prolific}} and {{wide range of}} both traditional and innovative works inspired by African-American thought, which have been exhibited {{in public and private}} galleries, and prestigious museums and educational institutions worldwide.

2500|$|In 2000, Morehouse's {{part-time}} soccer coach, Augustine Konneh (who had lobbied to get soccer {{elevated to}} varsity status two years earlier) signed two Nigerian-born players {{to play for}} the Maroon Tigers even though they had played professionally for the Atlanta Ruckus of the A-League two years earlier. They also played a few games for Morehouse before they actually enrolled at the school. Despite obvious red flags in their applications‚Äîthey would have been only grade-school age when they enrolled at the University of Liberia, and one of them couldn't provide a transcript of his collegiate coursework‚ÄîMorehouse admitted them. Even though the school's athletic director received word that the two players might have been ineligible, they were allowed to play in 2001 as well. Although Konneh was replaced as coach in 2001, numerous other violations‚Äîincluding a player being allowed to compete without proper paperwork‚Äîled Morehouse to cancel the 2003 season. In November 2003, the NCAA barred Morehouse from fielding a soccer team again until 2006‚Äîin effect, extending the self-imposed cancellation for an additional two seasons. It was the first multi-year shutdown of an athletic program since the NCAA adopted the [...] "repeat violator" [...] rules. It also slapped Morehouse with five years' probation‚Äîthe longest that can be imposed under the NCAA constitution, and tied for the longest probation ever. USA Today called it the harshest penalty ever handed down to a collegiate program. The Division II infractions committee came down particularly hard on Morehouse {{because of a lack of}} institutional control; for a time the athletic department did not know the soccer program even existed. While this was Morehouse's first major infractions case, the NCAA felt compelled to impose the NCAA [...] "death penalty" [...] because of what it called [...] "a complete failure" [...] to keep the program in compliance. [...] Soccer at Morehouse has since reverted to intramural status; school officials had planned <b>to</b> <b>shutter</b> varsity soccer for an indefinite period even before the NCAA acted.|$|E
