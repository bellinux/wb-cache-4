40|$|We {{report for}} the first time levels of {{persistent}} organic pollutants in marine bird eggs from an oceanic island in the Indian Ocean, the worlds third largest ocean. Ten eggs each of the Common Noddy, also known as the Brown Noddy (Anous stolidus), and Sooty Tern (Sterna fuscata) were collected from Ile Cocos off the coast of the island of Rodrigues, located 560 km east of the island of Mauritius. Sigma PCBs had the highest levels (2. 2 and 2. 6 ng/g wm, wet mass; 20 and 19 ng/g lm, lipid mass) for common Noddy and Sooty Tern, respectively (and following), then Sigma DDT (1. 9 and 3. 1 ng/g wm; 17 and 23 ng/g lm), and mirex (0. 96 and 0. 69 ng/g wm; 8. 7 and 5. 0 ng/g lm). Sigma Chlordanes (0. 094 and 0. 15 ng/g wm; 0. 48 and 0. 73 ng/g lm) and Sigma <b>toxaphenes</b> (0. 26 and 0. 61 ng/g wm; 2. 4 and 5. 9 ng/g lm) are rare data for these compounds from this ocean. Brominated flame retardants were low (0. 08 and 0. 07 ng/g wm; 0. 7 and 0. 7 ng/g lm). Multivariate analyses indicated different contamination patterns in the prey items as Sooty Terns had significantly higher levels of mean Sigma chlordanes and Sigma <b>toxaphenes,</b> as well as CB 105, - 108 and - 157. p,p-DDE had an association with thinner eggshells in the Sooty Tern. Although the contaminant levels were in all respects low, industrialisation, development on the periphery, commercial exploitation of the marine environment, and pollutants transferred over long distances by marine debris is likely to add to chemical pressure in this region. Monitoring changes in background levels of pollutants in remote regions will indicate such trends, and marine bird eggs from Rodrigues would be an excellent site.

40|$|The {{determination}} of chlorinated paraffins (CPs) {{in the environment}} is important, since CPs are persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic. However, the analysis of these complex mixtures containing thousands of isomers is also a demanding task. CP analysis and especially the quantification of CPs are far from being well established. In this work, new methodologies were developed for the {{determination of}} CPs in biota by low-resolution mass spectrometry (LRMS). The use of expensive high-resolution mass spectrometry was avoided. Therefore, existing clean-up methods were improved to enhance the selectivity {{as well as the}} unequivocal identification of CP congener groups. The developed method comprises the following steps: After cold column extraction, lipids were removed by adsorption chromatography on silica gel impregnated with sulfuric acid. Adsorption chromatography on Florisil® allowed the elimination of interfering compounds such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and <b>toxaphenes,</b> which interfere the CP analysis by high-resolution gas chromatography (HRGC) coupled to LRMS and employing electron capture negative ionisation (ECNI). The analysis of complex CP mixtures with short- (SCCPs, C 10 - 13) and medium- (MCCPs, C 14 - 17) chain lengths can be disturbed by mass overlap, if LRMS in the ECNI mode is employed. This is mainly caused by CP congeners with the same nominal mass but five carbon atoms more and two chlorine atoms less and can lead to an overestimation of the total CP concentration. Therefore, a procedure based on a precise check of isotope ratios, retention time ranges and signal shapes was developed to unequivocally identify the most important CP congener groups. Prior to this work, quantification procedures for CPs were not well established, and systematic errors could not always be avoided. Therefore, a new quantification procedure was developed to overcome the strong dependence of ECNI results on the chlorine content of the standard, and to avoid a tedious and time-consuming selection of the “most similar” reference standard. A linear correlation could be established between the total response factor of a CP mixture and its chlorine content. This allowed the compensation of errors due to differences between the degree of chlorination of CPs in the sample and standard. Quantification errors were considerably reduced and CP pattern matching procedures between standard and sample became unnecessary. Furthermore, HRGC electron ionisation tandem mass spectrometry (EI-MS/MS) was used for the fast determination of the total CP amount. This method was successfully applied to the determination of total CP concentrations in fish, human milk and eggs and provided a first insight into CP levels. ECNI-LRMS was employed for the determination of CP levels and congener group patterns in different fishes and seabirds from various regions in Europe (North and Baltic Sea, Central Europe, European Arctic). Results revealed that SCCPs and MCCPs are detectable in fish in the ng/g range. Hence, concentrations are comparable to levels of other persistent organic pollutants (e. g. polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), <b>toxaphenes</b> and polybrominated diphenylethers).

Urban agriculture is common and of economic value for low income families. In Arusha, many households sell eggs from free-ranging backyard chicken. In 2011, 159 eggs from different households in five different locations in Arusha were collected, homogenized, pooled into 28 composite samples and analyzed for a wide selection of POPs. Levels of POPs varied widely within and between the locations. The levels of dieldrin and σDDT ranged between 2 and 98, 791 and 2 and 324 ng/g lipid weight (lw), respectively. EU MRLs of 0. 02 mg/kg dieldrin for eggs were exceeded in 4 / 28 samples. PCBs, HCHs, chlordanes, <b>toxaphenes</b> and endosulfanes were found at lower frequency and levels. Brominated flame retardants (BFRs), e. g polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs), hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) and 1, 2 -bis(2, 4, 6 -tribromphenoxy) ethane (BTBPE) were present in 100 %, 60 % and 46 % of the composite samples, respectively. Octa-and deca-BDEs were the dominating PBDEs and BDE 209 levels ranged between <. LOQ (limit of quantification) - 312 ng/g lw. Dioxins were measured using the DR-LUC bio-assay and found in levels of <. LOQ - 20 pg bio-TEQs/g lw.

40|$|Samples of 150 narwhals {{obtained}} in different years from two West Greenland areas, Avanersuaq and Uummannaq, were compared for concentrations of and regional differences in heavy metals and organochlorines and stable-carbon and nitrogen isotopes. Cadmium, Hg, and Se concentrations {{increased in the}} first 3 - 4 years of the animal's life, after which no dependence on age was observed. Females had significantly higher concentrations of Cd in all tissues and of Hg and Se in liver than males. No consistent difference in metal levels between narwhals from Avanersuaq and Uummarmaq was found. Year-to-year variation in metal levels at one location was larger than the geographical variation. Metal levels were {{within the range of}} previous published results for narwhals from Arctic Canada. Organochlorine (OC) concentrations in blubber of narwhals were dependent on age and sex. Females showed decreasing OC concentration in the first 8 - 10 years, while for males increases were detected in {{the first few years of}} life, after which the concentrations became stable. Few statistical differences in mean OC concentrations among individuals were observed. However, narwhals from Avanersuaq in 1993 had the lowest levels, indicating a temporal decrease of SigmaPCBs. SigmaPCBs, DDTs, HCHs and <b>toxaphenes</b> seem to be at similar levels in West Greenland and Arctic Canada, which can be explained by the close winter distributions of populations as well as large ranges in concentrations, time span, number of analyses and the size/age composition of the data. PCB and DDT concentrations in West Greenland narwhals were half those found in East Greenland and Svalbard. Stable-carbon isotope ratios in muscle of 150 narwhals showed a decreasing trend in the first year when they gradually reduced their dependency on mother's milk, after which they became relatively stable. delta(15) N values were significantly higher in samples from Uummarmaq in 1993 compared to samples from Avanersuaq in 1984 and 1985 indicating that the diet of the narwhals in Uummannaq was at a higher trophic level. However, only a few significant correlations were found between stable isotope ratios and metal and OC concentrations. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Marine mammals {{are exposed}} to {{persistent}} organic pollutants (POPs), which may be biotransformed to metabolites {{some of which are}} highly toxic. Both POPs and their metabolites may lead to adverse health effects, which have been studied using various biomarkers. Changes in endocrine homeostasis have been suggested to be sensitive biomarkers for contaminant-related effects. The overall objective of this doctoral thesis was to investigate biotransformation capacity of POPs and their potential endocrine disruptive effects in two contrasting ringed seal populations from the low contaminated Svalbard area and from the highly contaminated Baltic Sea. Biotransformation capacity was studied by determining the relationships between congener-specific patterns and concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and their hydroxyl (OH) - and/or methylsulfonyl (MeSO 2) -metabolites, and catalytic activities of hepatic xenobiotic-metabolizing phase I and II enzymes. The results suggest that the biotransformation of PCBs, PBDEs and <b>toxaphenes</b> in ringed seals depends on the congener-specific halogen-substitution pattern. Biotransformation products detected in the seals included OH-PCBs, MeSO 2 -PCBs and –DDE, pentachlorophenol, 4 -OHheptachlorostyrene, and to a minor extent OH-PBDEs. The effects of life history state (moulting and fasting) on contaminant status and potential biomarkers for endocrine disruption, including hormone and vitamin homeostasis, were investigated in the low contaminated ringed seal population from Svalbard. Moulting/fasting status strongly affected thyroid, vitamin A and calcitriol homeostasis, body condition and concentrations of POPs and their OH-metabolites. In contrast, moulting/fasting status was not associated with variations in vitamin E levels. Endocrine disruptive effects on multiple endpoints were investigated in the two contrasting ringed seal populations. The results suggest that thyroid, vitamin A and calcitriol homeostasis may be affected by the exposure of contaminants and/or their metabolites in the Baltic ringed seals. Complex and non-linear relationships were observed between the contaminant levels and the endocrine variables. Positive relationships between circulating free and total thyroid hormone concentration ratios and OH-PCBs suggest that OH-PCBs may mediate the disruption of thyroid hormone transport in plasma. Species differences in thyroid and bone-related effects of contaminants were studied in ringed and grey seals from low contaminated references areas and from the highly contaminated Baltic Sea. The results indicate that these two species living at the same environment approximately at the same trophic level respond in a very different way to contaminant exposure. The results of this thesis suggest that the health status of the Baltic ringed seals has still improved during the last decade. PCB and DDE levels have decreased in these seals and the contaminant-related effects are different today than a decade ago. The health of the Baltic ringed seals is still suggested to be affected by the contaminant exposure. At the present level of the contaminant exposure the Baltic ringed seals seem to be at a zone where their body is able to compensate for the contaminant-mediated endocrine disruption. Based on the results of this thesis, several recommendations that could be applied on monitoring and assessing risk for contaminant effects are provided. Circulating OH-metabolites should be included in monitoring and risk assessment programs due to their high toxic potential. It should be noted that endogenous variables may have complex and highly variable responses to contaminant exposure including non-linear responses. These relationships may be further confounded by life history status. Therefore, it is highly recommended that when using variables related to endocrine homeostasis to investigate/monitor or assess the risk of contaminant effects in seals, the life history status of the animal should be carefully taken into consideration. This applies especially when using thyroid, vitamin A or calcitriolrelated parameters during moulting/fasting period. Extrapolations between species for assessing risk for contaminant effects in phocid seals should be avoided...|$|R
