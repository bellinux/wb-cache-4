50|$|The Mark 3 was trunnioned as the Mark 1 and Mark 2, but {{was built}} in three {{different}} caliber lengths, 30, 35, and 40, in eight different Mods, Mod 0 - Mod 6 and Mod's 8 and 9. Mod 0 was 30 caliber with Mod 1 being 35 caliber. All 30 and 35 caliber Mods had a liner, 10 hoops, and a jacket. Mod 2 was 40 caliber with only eight hoops. Mod 3 was again 30 caliber but introduced the use of case (semi-fixed) ammunition. The Mod 4 was experimental in that it eliminated the trunnions and used a <b>threaded</b> <b>sleeve.</b> Mod 5s were reworked Mod 1s making them capable of handling case ammunition. As with the Mod 5 the Mod 6 were Mod 2s reworked to handle case ammunition. The Mod 7 was skipped and no drawings exist for this Mod. The Mod 8 was another Mod 2 rework, this time removing the trunnions and using a <b>threaded</b> <b>sleeve.</b> The last Mod was the Mod 9, using a Mod 3 gun and giving it a full length liner.|$|E

50|$|Not all plugs are solid. Some plugs are {{bored with}} a T-junction. In these systems the plug {{extends beyond the}} <b>threaded</b> <b>sleeve</b> and is {{designed}} to form an airtight fitting with glass tubing or hosing. The shaft of the plug is bored from beyond the <b>threaded</b> <b>sleeve</b> to a T-junction just before the bevel plug contact. When the plug is fully sealed, the region beyond the bevel is separated from the plug shaft {{as well as the}} bore which leads out of its shaft. When the plug bevel contact is released, the two regions are exposed to each other. These valves have also been used as a grease-free alternative to straight bored stopcocks common to Schlenk flasks. The high symmetry and concise design of these valves has also made them popular for capping NMR tubes. Such NMR tubes can be heated without the loss of solvent thanks to the valve's gas-tight seal. NMR tubes with T-bore plugs are widely known as J. Young NMR tubes, named after the brand name of valves most commonly used for this purpose. Images of J. Young NMR tubes and a J. Young NMR tube adapter are in the gallery.|$|E
50|$|A maillon, maillon rapide or {{quick link}} is a metal link, {{similar to a}} carabiner. Maillons have a <b>threaded</b> <b>sleeve</b> which {{tightens}} over a thread, {{as opposed to a}} hinged gate like a carabiner, making them stronger, but more difficult to use. Like carabiners, maillons are available in a range of shapes and thicknesses (i.e., strengths), and often offer greater versatility over carabiners as their different shapes and lack of hinged gates allow them to be used in multi-directional load situations.|$|E
50|$|With solid plugs, a tube or area exists {{above and}} below the bevel and turning the plug {{controls}} access. In a number of cases it is convenient to fully remove a plug which can give access to the region beyond the bevel. Plugs are generally made of an inert plastic such as PTFE and are attached to a <b>threaded</b> <b>sleeve</b> {{in such a way that}} the sleeve can be turned without spinning the plug. The contact with the bevel is made by an O-ring fitted to the tip of the plug or by the plug itself. There are a few examples where the plug in made of glass. In the case of glass plugs, the joint contact is always a rubber O-ring but they are still prone to shattering.|$|E

40|$|Several electro-valves {{have failed}} {{because of the}} {{fracture}} occurred on the internal sleeve made in a typical free cutting leaded brass CW 614 N (UNS 36000). The morphology of the observed fracture surface clearly indicates that the failure phenomenon has been ruled by a stress corrosion cracking mechanism. On the other hand, all the electro-valves operate in an environment featured by potable water that does not justify an alchaline concentration able to induce the SCC phenomenon. The analysis of the observed surface and the comparison of the stress that can induce SCC clearly {{point out that the}} failure has been induced by the application of excessive torque on the <b>threaded</b> <b>sleeves</b> to grant their fixing. The performed investigation allows us to indicate the correct procedure {{in order to avoid the}} failure of the sleeves and also the change of the applied alloy or an excessive increase of the resistant thickness of such a component...|$|R

40|$|Quality {{inspection}} of gluing quality in inner <b>threads</b> of bearing <b>sleeve</b> of harddisk-drive {{is an important}} step in spindle motor assembly. This paper presents an automated inspection system based on machine vision for quality control of gluing quality. At present, the inspection process is performed by human inspectors. However, they have low throughput and cannot identify all defects. To increase the quality and productivity, an automated visual inspection system is needed. The approach is based on detecting reflected light from the defects under oblique lighting. The defects generate highlights along the threads {{in the image of the}} inner sleeve. To reduce spurious reflections from thread roofs, input image of threads is enhanced by a Gabor filtering and the threads are located by a geometric primitive fitting. By properly detecting those highlight spots within regions between adjacent thread roofs, the defect is accurately identified.

40|$|For {{my senior}} design project, I {{designed}} and built a device that will dilate the human esophagus for patients suffering {{from a variety of}} medical conditions. One current technique, Mercury bougienage, uses a tapered rubber rod filled with Mercury. The Mercury falls because of gravity, inducing an outward pressure on the esophagus. Two main problems with this procedure are the large longitudinal forces involved and the dependence upon the "feel" of the physician in applying the force. As a result, there is 'an uncertain risk of tissue perforation under this treatment. Other procedures have met with limited success and are difficult to apply to narrow or tortuous strictures. My design, developed with Carr Everbach, involves the use of a three-dimensional braid that expands radially when compressed and becomes narrow when stretched. Using a screw with left and right-handed <b>threads,</b> two <b>sleeves</b> were constructed so that they could slide up and down the screw. The sleeves are attached to each end of the braid. To test the device, an apparatus was built that applies an internal pressure to a latex tube, causing it to expand. The expansion was measured with a column of water and the pressure was recorded with a pressure transducer. Preliminary mechanical tests indicate that the device will exert forces necessary for esophageal dilation. Testing of the braid shows that the radial force varies linearly with the diameter of the braid. If the radial force is monitored by a control system, the device should allow for greater sensitivity of forces applied, resulting in more effective dilation...|$|R

It consists of six 5 -mm-long copper <b>sleeves</b> <b>threaded</b> onto a monofilament polypropylene thread (Figure 1). The proximal end of the thread contains a knot that is anchored into the myometrium of the uterine fundus, thereby securing the device in the uterine cavity. 1 A 35 -year-old woman was referred for removal of an IUD that had been inserted eight years earlier in China. Pelvic sonography showed a GyneFix IUD in the uterine cavity (Figure 2), and this was removed by pulling the IUD thread. As gynaecologists practising in North America are seeing increasing numbers of patients from Europe and Asia, they {{should be aware of}} this particular type of IUD and its char-acteristic sonographic appearance (Figure 2). Very often, a GyneFix IUD can be easily removed by applying traction on the thread. However, if the thread is retracted into the uterine cavity, removal can be difficult and may require hysteroscopic guidance. ...|$|R

This comparative analysis assesses the frequency of dislodgement and a time-sparing effect on the intervention of 3 different trocar systems, including an innovation {{in the field of}} access-providing systems. Methods: Patients who underwent laparoscopy for various gynecological indications were included and randomized consecutively into 3 groups according to the access system used in the intervention: (A) trocar fitted with a spiral <b>thread</b> on the <b>sleeve,</b> (B) trocar with plain sleeve, (C) trocar as in B together with a fixator.
