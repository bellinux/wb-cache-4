50|$|A common {{technique}} {{to reduce the}} time-to-response of a thermostat is to mill a slot into the bottom side of a griddle plate and “embed” the <b>thermostat</b> <b>bulb</b> in closer proximity to the griddle surface. This construction reduces the thermostat response time in approximate proportion to {{the distance to the}} griddle surface. Specification sheets or product literature will indicate embedded construction through use of key words like ‘embedded’ or indicate a specific probe proximity to the plate surface that is less than the plate thickness.|$|E
50|$|Snap action {{thermostats}} are {{the most}} common control used in heavy duty commercial griddles with medium-to-heavy production demands. These controls are called “snap action” because the control mechanism will turn the burner valve or electrical element fully on or completely off, with no modulation or intermediate heat source operation - effectively ‘snapping’ the heat source on or off. While not as responsive as solid state controls, snap action controls can maintain a griddle surface temperature within +/- 15°F (8°C) of set point if the <b>thermostat</b> <b>bulb</b> is embedded assuming a 1-inch (25mm) thick steel plate. This operating temperature range may be pushed to +/- 20 to 25°F (10°C to 13°C) if the probe is bottom mounted due to the additional thermal hysteresis introduced by the plate material.|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} this article is the {{measurement}} of thermal flow under laboratory conditions. We can define thermal flow as the amount of heat transmitted through the surface of rock over a certain period of time. According to the Atlas of Geothermal Energy the thermal flow ranges from 40 to 120 mW/m 2; {{it is not possible to}} measure directly on the surface of the rock. The conventional method of measurement is the use of separation bar thermic conduction measurement system or to measure the temperature of the rock in two different places at selected underground depth intervals. The method of measurement suggested by us combines these two techniques. The measurement is based on a sample of processed store from the Slovak Academy of Science. This sample represents the rock massiv:The complex model includes:- a heating system to imitate the thermal flow,- an isolation box to maintain stable conditions,- temperature stabilizing components (<b>thermostat,</b> <b>bulbs,</b> electric conductors),- a heat accumulator including a temperature sensor. A special computer program to measure the thermal flow was created using the Borland Delphi 3. 0 programming language. The role of the program is to process extensive data quickly. The results of the measured temperatures and modelled thermal flow are displayed graphically in this article. As seen from the graph, the course of measurement thermal flow is linear. In our geographical location this value is cca 120 m W. m- 2. This value proves, that at the projection physical model we are approximating to the reality in areas of sensitive elements. Another fact is that Joule heat which rose into a heater system of transformer straps under muster would thermal flow 2, 25 W. m- 2. From the present results that by follow the sensitivity measurement scanners it is needed to measure a minimum threefold during a longer time or to improve the sensitivity measurement chains. These measurements and analyses are not sufficient to make a final conclusion. It is necessary to repeat the measurements under real conditions...|$|R

40|$|Mercury {{is a type}} {{of heavy}} metal that {{naturally}} occurs in the earth’s crust, which can be found in soil, rocks and sea. Mercury is released to the environment through natural processes such as rock erosion, soil decomposition or volcanic eruptions and also released through human activities, petrochemical industrial processes and chlor-alkali industries. Mercury is widely used in the thermometer, <b>thermostat,</b> barometer, <b>bulbs,</b> dental amalgams and switches. Other than that, mercury is one of the hazardous chemical elements that exist on the earth that can attack the human central nervous system, kidney, lungs and other body systems. Portable Mercury Removal Rig (PMRR) was used in mercury removal process under room temperature with different operating pressure; 5, 10 and 23 psig, different inlet concentration; 2, 4, 6 and 8 ppm, different pH and by using different absorbent; extruded activated carbon (EAC), granular activated carbon (GAC) and ion exchange (IE) resins. Extruded Activated Carbon (EAC) was the best absorbent with pH sample range from 2 to 4 in using the PMRR. It was also found that 5 psig was the best operating pressure and concentration from 2 to 4 ppm was the most suitable concentration to be used. This study shows that EAC can be used as an efficient absorbent in removing mercury in wastewater as it give about 99. 8 % of mercury removal...|$|R

Projections for the Internet of Things (IoT) vary, depending on how it is defined and the analyst doing the prognosticating, but all agree — it’s going to be huge. Much of the conversation, however, has been around Internet-enabling households with connected refrigerators and light <b>bulbs,</b> <b>thermostats</b> and weight scales. However, there are also plenty of business applications — and many of them are more than theories, or predictions in some-one’s crystal ball. The fact is, the IoT is already here. Unattended, machine-to-machine applications have been part of the Internet fabric for more than 20 years. It has been estimated that more than a billion connected machines and devices are already in use, doing the sorts of tasks that are associated with the IoT. Whether those devices consist of a simple sensor plus a communications uplink, or are built around a fully loaded CPU with a mainstream operating system, they are all IoT. So why all the buzz — and why now? In short, the explosive growth in mobil...|$|R
40|$|Mercury occurs {{naturally}} {{in the environment}} and exists in several forms. These forms can be organized under three headings: metallic mercury (also known as elemental mercury), inorganic mercury, and organic mercury. Metallic mercury is used {{in a variety of}} household products and industrial items, including <b>thermostats,</b> fluorescent light <b>bulbs,</b> barometers, glass thermometers, and some blood pressure devices. Additionally, some religions have practices that may include the use of metallic mercury. The most common organic mercury compound that microorganisms and natural processes generate from other forms is methylmercury. Methylmercury is of particular concern because it can build up in certain edible freshwater and saltwater fish and marine mammals to levels that are many times greater than levels in the surrounding water. Because mercury occurs {{naturally in}} the environment, everyone is exposed to very low levels of mercury in air, water, and food. Some people may be exposed to higher levels of mercury in this form if they have a diet high in fish, shellfish, or marine mammals. Workers are mostly exposed from breathing air that contains mercury vapors, but may also be exposed to other inorganic mercury compounds in the workplace. Children are at risk of being exposed to metallic mercury that is not safely contained, to mercury that may be brought home on work clothes or tools, or to methylmercury- contaminated foods.
