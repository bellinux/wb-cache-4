5|$|In May 1943, the Axis {{powers of}} Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy were {{defeated}} in the North African Campaign. Two months later, the Allied powers of Great Britain and the United States successfully launched their invasion of Sicily, codenamed Operation Husky. The island being completely occupied {{by the end of}} August, the Allies next <b>turned</b> <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the invasion of Italy.|$|E
5|$|Replying to the Wrights' letters, the U.S. {{military}} expressed {{virtually no}} interest in their claims. The brothers <b>turned</b> <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> Europe, especially France, where enthusiasm for aviation ran high, and journeyed there {{for the first time}} in 1907 for face-to-face talks with government officials and businessmen. They also met with aviation representatives in Germany and Britain. Before traveling, Orville shipped a newly built Model A Flyer to France in anticipation of demonstration flights.|$|E
5|$|The deputies <b>turned</b> <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> Cripple Creek itself. They {{arrested and}} imprisoned {{hundreds}} of citizens without cause. Many {{inhabitants of the}} town were seized {{on the street or}} pulled from their homes, then clubbed, kicked or beaten. The deputies formed a gauntlet and forced townspeople to pass through it, spitting, slapping and kicking them. With Bull Hill in his possession, Gen. Brooks began detaining the deputies. By nightfall, Brooks had seized the town and corralled all of Bowers' men.|$|E

5|$|The {{trial and}} {{execution}} of Riel caused a bitter and prolonged reaction which convulsed Canadian politics for decades. The Orange Irish Protestant element in Ontario had demanded the execution as the punishment for Riel's treason and his execution of Thomas Scott in 1870. With their revenge satisfied, the Orange <b>turned</b> <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> other matters (especially the Jesuit Estates proposal). In Quebec there was no forgetting, and the politician Honoré Mercier rose to power by mobilizing the opposition in 1886.|$|E
5|$|France officially {{entered the}} war on 17 June 1778, and the French ships sent to the Western Hemisphere {{spent most of the}} year in the West Indies, and only sailed to the Thirteen Colonies from July until November. In the first Franco-American campaign, a French fleet {{commanded}} by Vice-Admiral Comte Charles Henri Hector d'Estaing attempted landings in New York and Newport, but due to a combination of poor co-ordination and bad weather, d'Estaing and Vice-Admiral Lord Richard Howe naval forces did not engage during 1778. After the French fleet departed, the British <b>turned</b> <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the south. In 1779, the French fleet returned to assist American forces attempting to recapture Savannah from British forces.|$|E
5|$|The Maratha cannonade {{intensified}} as the British redeployed. Although British artillery {{was brought}} forward to counter, it was ineffective against the mass firepower of the Maratha guns and quickly disabled through {{the weight of}} shot directed against it. British casualties mounted as the Maratha guns <b>turned</b> <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the infantry and subjected them to a barrage of canister, grape and round shot. Wellesley decided that his only option to neutralise the artillery and get his men out of the killing field was to advance directly {{into the mouth of}} the Maratha artillery. He ordered his cannon to be abandoned and gave the command for his infantry to march forward with bayonets fixed.|$|E

5|$|The Zoios' clandestine {{transaction}} with Turp initially progressed well, {{but fell}} apart in March 1966, when Turp discovered he {{would actually be}} arming Rhodesia rather than Pakistan, reacted with alarm and informed the British government. The British Board of Trade tightened its control over arms transactions, and encouraged its NATO counterparts to do the same, while the Zoios <b>turned</b> <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> Belgian, Italian and West German arms dealers. In October 1966, a huge consignment of army and air force equipment arrived in Rhodesia from the seaports of Mozambique, {{with many of the}} containers bearing metropolitan Portuguese markings. Prominent among the European weapons were FN FAL battle rifles from Belgium, which allowed an unofficial Rhodesian trade delegation to operate quietly in spite of the sanctions.|$|E
5|$|The last Texian {{group to}} remain in the open were Crockett and his men, {{defending}} the low wall in front of the church. Unable to reload, they used their rifles as clubs and fought with knives. After a volley of fire and a wave of Mexican bayonets, the few remaining Texians in this group fell back towards the church. The Mexican army now controlled all of the outer walls and the interior of the Alamo compound except for the church and rooms along the east and west walls. Mexican soldiers <b>turned</b> <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> a Texian flag waving from the roof of one building. Four Mexicans were killed before the flag of Mexico was raised in that location.|$|E
5|$|These events {{coincided with}} the {{accession}} of Nero to the imperial throne in Rome, and the young emperor decided to react vigorously. The war, which was the only major foreign campaign of his reign, began with rapid success for the Roman forces, led by the able general Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo. They overcame the forces loyal to Tiridates, installed their own candidate, Tigranes VI, on the Armenian throne, and left the country. The Romans were aided {{by the fact that}} the Parthian king Vologases was embroiled in the suppression of a series of revolts in his own country. As soon as these had been dealt with, however, the Parthians <b>turned</b> <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> Armenia, and after a couple of years of inconclusive campaigning, inflicted a heavy defeat on the Romans in the Battle of Rhandeia.|$|E

5|$|Although heavily outnumbered, the 27th Brigade {{held their}} {{positions}} into the afternoon before the Australians were finally withdrawn to {{positions in the}} rear of the brigade, with both sides having suffered heavy casualties. The Chinese then <b>turned</b> <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the Canadians on Hill 677, but during a fierce night battle they were unable to dislodge them. The fighting helped blunt the Chinese offensive and the actions of the Australians and Canadians at Kapyong were important in assisting to prevent a breakthrough on the United Nations Command central front, and ultimately the capture of Seoul. The two battalions bore the brunt of the assault and stopped an entire Chinese division during the hard fought defensive battle. The next day the Chinese withdrew back up the valley, in order to regroup. Today, the battle is regarded as one of the most famous actions fought by the Australian and Canadian armies in Korea.|$|E
5|$|Argentina, {{like many}} other countries, entered into a {{recession}} following the beginning of World War I as international flows of goods, capital and labour declined. Foreign investment in Argentina came to a complete standstill from which it never fully recovered: Great Britain had become heavily indebted to the United States {{during the war and}} would never again export capital at a comparable scale. And after the opening of the Panama canal in 1914, Argentina and the other Southern cone economies declined, as investors <b>turned</b> <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> Asia and the Caribbean. The United States, which came out of the war a political and financial superpower, especially perceived Argentina (and to a lesser extent Brazil) as a potential rival on world markets. Neither the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange nor the private domestic banks developed rapidly enough to fully replace British capital.|$|E
5|$|Sanger {{returned}} to the United States in October 1915. She planned to open a birth control clinic modeled on the world's first such clinic, which she had visited in Amsterdam. She first had to fight the charges outstanding against her.Kennedy, p. 77. Noted attorney Clarence Darrow offered to defend Sanger free of charge but, bowing to public pressure, the government dropped the charges early in 1916.Sanger, Autobiography, pp. 183–189.Engelman, p. 61–62: Sanger also gained sympathy from the public when her five-year-old daughter died immediately before the trial. No longer under the threat of jail, Sanger embarked on a successful cross-country speaking tour, which catapulted her into {{the leadership of the}} U.S. birth control movement. Other leading figures, such as William J. Robinson and Mary Dennett, chose to work in the background, or <b>turned</b> <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> other causes. Later in 1916, Sanger traveled to Boston to lend her support to the Massachusetts Birth Control League and to jailed birth control activist Van Kleeck Allison.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{before the}} action began, Persano {{decided to leave}} his {{flagship}} and transfer to Affondatore, though none of his subordinates on the other ships {{were aware of the}} change. They were thus left to fight as individuals without direction. More dangerously, by stopping Re d'Italia, he allowed a significant gap to open up between Vacca's three ships {{and the rest of the}} fleet. Tegetthoff took his fleet through the gap between Vacca's and Persano's ships, in an attempt to split the Italian line and initiate a melee. He failed to ram any Italian vessels on the first pass, so he turned back toward Persano's ships, and took Re d'Italia, San Martino, and Palestro under heavy fire. The Austrians quickly inflicted serious damage on Re d'Italia and Palestro, eventually sinking both ships. After Palestro withdrew, the Austrian ironclads <b>turned</b> <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the 3rd Division, including Re di Portogallo.|$|E
5|$|Sicilian {{raids on}} Italy continued, and {{prompted}} {{the intervention of}} the Western Emperor, Otto II in the peninsula in 982, where he was defeated at the Battle of Stilo. It was not until the 1020s that the Byzantines <b>turned</b> <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> Sicily again, after a period of consolidation of their position in southern Italy under the capable Catepan Basil Boioannes. A large force landed in Messina in 1025, but the expedition was called off when news came of the death of Emperor Basil II. A final effort was made in 1038, when the talented young general George Maniakes was dispatched to Sicily, taking advantage of internal conflicts between the Kalbids and the Zirids. Maniakes quickly recaptured the entire eastern coast, but the conquest was left incomplete when he was recalled to Constantinople by jealous rivals. The Kalbids soon recovered their losses, and Messina, the last Byzantine outpost, fell in 1042.|$|E
5|$|The Fire then <b>turned</b> <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> {{their second}} and final {{qualification}} match {{hosted by the}} San Jose Earthquakes at Buck Shaw Stadium in Santa Clara, California. Played on May 24, 2011, in front of 4,124 spectators, the hosts took a two-goal lead {{in the first half}} with Ellis McLoughlin and Justin Morrow scoring in the 14th and 43rd minutes, respectively. The Fire halved the deficit in the 61st minute with a goal from Orr Barouch. Fifteen minutes later the Fire tied the score with a strike from Yamith Cuesta. The score remained tied until the end of regulation, leading to extra time, during which Chicago's Gonzalo Segares was ejected for dissent. Despite the Earthquakes' man advantage, the two sides remained tied during overtime, prompting a penalty shootout. In the fifth round of penalties, with Chicago leading 5–4, San Jose's Scott Sealy missed his shot as it deflected off the crossbar, giving the Fire a second qualifier victory and a berth into the third round of the 2011 U.S. Open Cup tournament.|$|E

25|$|In December 2016, DigiTimes {{reported}} that Apple had reduced {{production of the}} iPhone 7 because of decreasing demand for the product after the initial surge of interest waned.

5|$|The {{background}} {{to the development}} of the Dorchester Hotel is complicated. Sir Malcolm McAlpine, a partner in the building company, Sir Robert McAlpine & Sons, and Sir Frances Towle, the managing director of Gordon Hotels Ltd., shared a vision of creating the 'perfect hotel': ultramodern and ultra-efficient, with all the conveniences modern technology could supply. The two companies purchased Hertford House in 1929 and quickly demolished it. The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) had also shown an interest in purchasing it and had almost done so prior to the McAlpine acquisition, but instead they <b>turned</b> <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> Foley House. The purchase and destruction of Hertford House was part of significant redevelopment which took place on Park Lane during this period; it followed the gutting of Grosvenor House and the building of the Grosvenor House Hotel, which was completed in 1929.|$|E
5|$|With Western Europe neutralised, the OKL and OKW <b>turned</b> <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> Britain, {{which was}} now home to the Allied base of {{operations}} in Europe. Hitler hoped Britain would negotiate for an armistice, {{for which he was}} prepared to offer generous terms. The tentative offers made by Hitler were rejected by the Churchill coalition government. Hitler now ordered the Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine to prepare for an amphibious assault of Britain, codenamed Operation Sealion. The Luftwaffe was to eliminate enemy air power and the Kriegsmarine was ordered to make all the necessary preparations for transporting the Heer (Army) across the English Channel. The Luftwaffe's task came first. Once the RAF had been rendered impotent, Göring and Hitler hoped that an invasion would be unnecessary. If this proved not to be the case, the Luftwaffe would then support the army and prevent the Royal Navy interdicting German sea traffic. Göring named the offensive against the RAF as Operation Eagle Attack (Adlerangriff).|$|E
5|$|With the {{northern}} provinces of South Vietnam under their control, North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces <b>turned</b> <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the Mekong Delta region, which formed {{part of the}} ARVN III Corps Tactical Zone. During the Offensive, {{the objective of the}} combined Communist forces in the zone was the capture of An Lộc, capital of Bình Long Province. The Viet Cong committed three infantry divisions to the mission (5th, 7th and 9th Divisions). North Vietnamese support {{came in the form of}} one artillery formation (69th Artillery Command), one armored regiment (203rd Armored Regiment), two independent regiments (205th and 101st Regiment), and one sapper unit (429th Sapper Group). The Viet Cong's 5th Division was to initiate the offensive by taking Lộc Ninh, while the 9th Division was assigned to An Lộc. The 7th Division was ordered to block National Highway 13 to prevent reinforcements from reaching An Lộc.|$|E
