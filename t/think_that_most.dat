"I {{will tell}} you now, first off, I'm Christian, and my career is {{evidence}} of God in my life, and I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> people are already thinking that Gaga and the blasphemy and they're premeditating the approach and I think they'll be very shocked {{to find out how}} huge and really groundbreaking the message is and how freeing the message is for all the right reasons.

500|$|Hayward {{categorized}} {{the writing}} team involved in Todd's redemption as [...] "an usually {{high number of}} male writers", and as an unusual situation because, historically, most soap opera writers have been women. In a June 1994 interview with TV Guide, in {{an article about the}} trend during the early 1990s of redeemed rapists on soap operas, head writer Malone commented that [...] "he bond between the woman and the violator is a great historical tradition in fiction and films," [...] and said that Rudolph Valentino, Humphrey Bogart, Kirk Douglas, and Clark Gable [...] "all began as totally irredeemable villains." [...] Although he did not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> women want to be raped or are drawn to violence, he said that viewers [...] "are responding to the intensity of passion and an actor who lets you inside the torment. Some [...] believe they can be swept up in that passion and still turn it good. They think, 'With me, he'd be different. [...] The author of the article, Michael Logan, supported Malone's statements, and commented, [...] "Let's call a spade a spade. There is a large contingent of American female soap viewers who find something very attractive about rapists". [...] Hayward reported that many female viewers were furious that Logan had described them this way, and stated that their attraction to Todd was due to the skill of the actor portraying him.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{issue in}} the debate is the fact neither Admiral Kimmel nor General Short ever faced court martial. It is alleged this was to avoid {{disclosing}} information showing the U.S. had advanced knowledge of the attack. When asked, [...] "Will historians know more later?", Kimmel replied, [...] "' ... I'll tell you what I believe. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> of the incriminating records have been destroyed. ... I doubt if the truth will ever emerge.' ..."

40|$|A large {{bipartisan}} {{majority of}} Americans oppose permanent U. S. {{military bases in}} Iraq and believe <b>that</b> <b>most</b> Iraqis are opposed as well, but a modest majority believes that the United States nonetheless plans to have permanent bases, {{according to a new}} poll by WorldPublicOpinion. org. A large majority <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> the United States should be willing to accept a new Iraqi government setting a timeline for the withdrawal of U. S. troops, and <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> Iraqis want such a timeline, but an overwhelming majority <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> the United States would refuse to agree to such a timeline. At this point, a large bipartisan majority favors reducing—though not completely withdrawing—U. S. troops...|$|R
2500|$|According to Farley, {{research}} suggests that very few prostitutes (she estimates that only 5% of women) make the choice freely. She says that most women in prostitution, including those working for escort services, have been sexually abused as children. Farley claims {{that a majority of}} prostitutes would like to leave the industry. Bob Herbert echoed a similar opinion, also in the New York Times. Herbert says [...] "Those who <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> of the women in prostitution want to be there are deluded... the world of the prostitute is typically filled with pimps, sadists, psychopaths, drug addicts, violent criminals and disease." ...|$|E

The two open-ended writing tasks included are as follows: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think it}} is likely. The townspeople have been too roughly handled to care about running any risks. They have no very large body of men-at-arms in the town.

They had better have left it alone, for they have no more chance of taking this house, with us all upon our guard, than they have of flying. There is one advantage in it,--they will get such a lesson, that I do think we shall be perfectly free from Indian attacks for the future.' ...|$|E

5000|$|There are {{economists who}} <b>think</b> <b>that</b> in <b>most</b> circumstances, {{floating}} exchange rates are preferable to fixed exchange rates. As floating exchange rates automatically adjust, they enable {{a country to}} dampen the impact of shocks and foreign business cycles, and to preempt the possibility of having a balance of payments crisis. However, they also engender unpredictability {{as the result of}} their dynamism.|$|R
60|$|Of how I descended that ladder I have no recollection, nor do I in {{the least}} know how the Mountaineers came after me, but I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the <b>most</b> of them rolled and {{scrambled}} down the thirty feet of rock.

There are other men who would, I am sure, rather join in the attack on the jail, if they could do so without putting the lives of all of us in danger.|$|E
6000|$|... "So thought {{some of us}} at first," [...] {{returned}} Dan, [...] "but when {{we found}} that the thermometer fell to somewhere between 40 and 50 degrees below zero; that walking in snow-shoes, trapping, hunting buffalo, and shooting, were not to be learned in a few days; and when we saw our women and children dependent sometimes on the charity of Indians, and reduced almost to starvation, we changed our minds as to the pleasure of the thing. However, if the school was rough, it made the scholars all the quicker, and now I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> of us are equal to the Redskins themselves at their own work.|$|E

5000|$|For Michel Ngue-Awane, {{poverty is}} a mental state and yet again, he {{suggests}} that a poor person in reality doesn't want to be poor, however, he has programmed his subconscious mind to accept poverty as a situation that cannot be overcome. Until he breaks this mental barrier, he will never defeat poverty. He <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> African people are poor because they are still mentally and psychologically bound, having been trained to accept poverty as normal, see and consider themselves as poor people. This situation is exacerbated and maintained by aid programmes. Accepting and living on aid is yet another mechanism to perpetuate poverty.that makes life easier and comfortable however, poor people’s subconscious mind accepts it. They attribute the causes of poverty to someone else but themselves. Unconsciously poor people- ...|$|R
