50|$|However, Fox Family's youth-oriented {{programming}} strategy alienated the network's core demographic {{of older}} viewers. The channel experienced {{a decline in}} viewership, falling in the Nielsen ratings from 10th <b>to</b> 17th <b>place</b> <b>in</b> overall <b>cable</b> network viewership, and a 35% drop in its prime time viewership. In 1999, Fox spun off two digital cable channels from Fox Family, the Boyz Channel and the Girlz Channel, which both contained programming content targeted at the respective genders. Both networks shut down after one year of operation {{due to a lack}} of demand by cable providers (each only had 100,000 subscribers) and News Corporation's desire to invest more heavily in the parent channel.|$|R
50|$|In July 2007 the Peak District National Park {{formally}} {{expressed concern}} at the plans <b>to</b> <b>place</b> <b>cables</b> <b>in</b> Woodhead 3, observing {{that it could}} not then be used for rail traffic. In September 2007 the Government Office for the East Midlands replied indicating that in their view it was unlikely that the route would be used for rail traffic and declined to intervene. On 4 December 2007 57 MPs signed an early day motion in the Commons brought by Manchester Blackley MP Graham Stringer expressing concern at laying <b>cables</b> <b>in</b> a viable tunnel for rail traffic. On 18 December a written answer in the Commons stated that laying <b>cables</b> <b>in</b> the tunnel would not preclude opening the route to rail traffic. On 23 January the Department for Transport 'clarified' this, saying that only the older Victorian tunnels, which were in poor condition, would be available. In December 2007 the Campaign for Better Transport (UK) began campaigning to keep the Woodhead Tunnel available for rail traffic and encouraging people to write to their MP. On 8 January the Northern Way, a collaboration between the three Northern Regional Development Agencies: Yorkshire Forward, Northwest Regional Development Agency and One NorthEast, called for the government to ensure the potential reuse of Woodhead Tunnels for rail use in the future. The Northern Way had previously published that economic benefit could be as much as £10 billion nationally with £3.5 billion of this in the North.|$|R
