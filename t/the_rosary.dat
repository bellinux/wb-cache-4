5|$|Meditation is an {{integral}} part of <b>the</b> <b>rosary.</b> This mode of meditation is the process of reflecting on the mysteries of <b>the</b> <b>rosary.</b> With practice, this may in time turn into contemplation on the mysteries. The practice of meditation during the praying of repeated Hail Marys dates back to 15th century Carthusian monks, and was soon adopted by the Dominicans at large. By the 16th century the practice of meditation during <b>the</b> <b>rosary</b> had spread across Europe, and the book Meditationi del Rosario della Gloriosa Maria Virgine (i.e. Meditations on <b>the</b> <b>Rosary</b> of the Glorious Virgin Mary) printed in 1569 for <b>the</b> <b>rosary</b> confraternity of Milan provided an individual meditation to accompany each bead or prayer.|$|E

5|$|The first Catholic chapel {{was built}} in Bedford {{on the corner of}} Mather Lane and Chapel Street in 1778 and this lasted until it was {{replaced}} in 1855 by St Joseph's Church by architect Joseph Hansom. A growing Catholic population in the area led to the building of Our Lady of <b>the</b> <b>Rosary</b> in Plank Lane in 1879, Twelve Apostles in 1879 and Sacred Heart in 1929. Other denominations catered for include Wesleyan, Independent, Primitive, Welsh and United Methodists. There are also Unitarian, Baptist and Jehovah's Witness places of worship in the town.|$|E

5|$|Devotions to Mary {{are part}} of Catholic piety but are {{distinct}} from the worship of God. Practices include prayers and Marian art, music, and architecture. Several liturgical Marian feasts are celebrated throughout the Church Year and she is honoured with many titles such as Queen of Heaven. Pope Paul VI called her Mother of the Church because, by giving birth to Christ, she {{is considered to be}} the spiritual mother to each member of the Body of Christ. Because of her influential role in the life of Jesus, prayers and devotions such as the Hail Mary, <b>the</b> <b>Rosary,</b> the Salve Regina and the Memorare are common Catholic practices. Pilgrimages to the sites of several Marian apparitions affirmed by the Church, such as Lourdes, Fátima, and Guadalupe, are also popular Catholic devotions.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí also practiced landscaping, {{often in}} urban settings. He aimed to place his {{works in the}} most {{appropriate}} natural and architectural surroundings by studying the location of his constructions thoroughly and trying to naturally integrate them into those surroundings. For this purpose, he often used the material that was most common in the nearby environment, such as the slate of Bellesguard and the grey Bierzo granite in the Episcopal Palace, Astorga. Many of his projects were gardens, such as the Güell Park and the Can Artigas Gardens, or incorporated gardens, as in the Casa Vicens or the Güell Pavilions. Gaudí's harmonious approach to landscaping is exemplified at the First Mystery of the Glory of <b>the</b> <b>Rosary</b> at Montserrat, where the architectural framework is nature itself—here the Montserrat rock—nature encircles the group of sculptures that adorned {{the path to the}} Holy Cave.|$|E
5|$|The {{school has}} one main church, St Peter's, and five chapels: the Boys' Chapel, the Chapel of the Angels, the Sodality Chapel, the St Francis Chapel and the St Ignatius Chapel. The last two are {{both within the}} towers of St Peter's Church, and are not {{normally}} used by pupils. The Sodality Chapel {{is the home of}} the relics of the 3rd-century Roman convert St Gordianus. The Jesuits brought his remains from the College of St Omer and held them beneath the altar since 1859. His bones were temporarily removed in 2006 whilst the chapel underwent restoration, but they have since been returned. The chapel is again used by the re-established Sodality. Adjacent to the Old Infirmary is <b>the</b> <b>Rosary</b> Garden, a place for spiritual contemplation, at the centre of which is a stone statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary.|$|E

5|$|Another of Gaudí's major {{projects}} and among his most admired works is the Casa Milà, {{better known as}} La Pedrera (1906–1910), commissioned by Pere Milà i Camps. Gaudí designed the house around two large, curved courtyards, with a structure of stone, brick and cast-iron columns and steel beams. The facade is built of limestone from Vilafranca del Penedès, apart from the upper level, which is covered in white tiles, evoking a snowy mountain. It has {{a total of five}} floors, plus a loft made entirely of catenary arches, as well as two large interior courtyards, one circular and one oval. Notable features are the staircases to the roof, topped with the four-armed cross, and the chimneys, covered in ceramics and with shapes that suggest mediaeval helmets. The interior decoration was carried out by Josep Maria Jujol and the painters Iu Pascual, Xavier Nogués and Aleix Clapés. The facade was to have been completed with a stone, metal and glass sculpture with Our lady of <b>the</b> <b>Rosary</b> accompanied by the archangels Michael and Gabriel, 4m in height. A sketch was made by the sculptor Carles Mani, but due to the events of the Tragic Week in 1909 the project was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|At the apartment, Father John and Lloyd find Linda {{has moved}} out, but they {{discover}} she had possessed a 12-year-old newspaper clipping about Father John's ordination. Father John offers Lloyd a job helping {{out at the}} church, which Lloyd accepts. Father John then returns to his church and cries, fearing he {{is too late to}} save Linda. Meanwhile, Linda goes to a bridge and is about to jump off when she encounters Gus, who offers her <b>the</b> <b>rosary</b> he received earlier from Father John. A grateful and emotional Linda hugs Gus. It is not revealed whether she commits suicide or not. In a confession to Father Ralph, Father John expresses guilt he did not absolve Linda before her confession abruptly ended. Father Ralph says that even if Linda is dead, her soul is immortal, and that Father John's penance is to absolve her now. Father John does so. The film ends with a childhood memory of young Linda at church, where a group of boys laugh at her old torn clothes until she is defended by a young John Buerlein, whose act seems to make a strong positive impact upon her.|$|E
25|$|In the 17th century, <b>the</b> <b>Rosary</b> {{began to}} appear as an element in key pieces of Roman Catholic Marian art. Key {{examples}} include Murrillo's Madonna with <b>the</b> <b>Rosary</b> at the Museo del Prado in Spain, and the statue of Madonna with Rosary at the church of San Nazaro Maggiore in Milan. Several Roman Catholic Marian churches {{around the world have}} also been named after <b>the</b> <b>rosary,</b> e.g. Our Lady of <b>the</b> <b>Rosary</b> Basilica, in Rosario Argentina, <b>the</b> <b>Rosary</b> Basilica in Lourdes and Nossa Senhora do Rosário in Porto Alegre, Brazil.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>rosary</b> and the {{scapular}} {{are viewed}} as devotional elements of Catholicism. Some historians suggest that the combined effect of the devotional elements and the benefits associated with them made <b>the</b> <b>rosary</b> and the scapular favored among Roman Catholics. However, {{although many of the}} faithful choose to pray <b>the</b> <b>rosary</b> and wear the scapular, the linking of <b>the</b> <b>rosary</b> and the scapular is not formally reflected in church doctrine.|$|E
25|$|According to some Catholic traditions, <b>the</b> <b>Rosary</b> {{was given}} to Saint Dominic in {{a vision of the}} Blessed Virgin Mary and it was then {{promoted}} by Blessed Allan de la Roche. However, not all Catholics agree with that tradition. Some historians see a more gradual development for <b>the</b> <b>Rosary,</b> in that the repetition of Marian prayers which form the basis of <b>the</b> <b>Rosary</b> needed counting devices, which resulted in the modern form of <b>the</b> <b>Rosary</b> prayed on beads.|$|E
25|$|By the 1500s the {{practice}} of meditation during <b>the</b> <b>rosary</b> had spread across Europe. Bartolomeo Scalvo's Meditationi del Rosario della Gloriosa Maria Virgine (i.e. Meditations on <b>the</b> <b>Rosary</b> of the Glorious Virgin Mary) printed in 1569 for <b>the</b> <b>rosary</b> confraternity of Milan provided an individual meditation to accompany each bead or prayer.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>rosary</b> was {{prominently}} {{featured in}} the apparitions of Our Lady of Fátima reported by three Portuguese children in 1917.

Reports of the Fatima apparitions helped spread rosary devotions and a Fatima prayer is now often added to the end of rosary recitations. The Basilica of Our Lady of <b>the</b> <b>Rosary,</b> Fatima, was built at that site in 1953 and has fifteen altars, each dedicated to a mystery of <b>the</b> <b>rosary.</b>|$|E
