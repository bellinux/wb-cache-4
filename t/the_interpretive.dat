25|$|The first {{homestead}} in {{the area}} was established by Francois Jean Rochas in 1885. He built his home {{at the mouth of}} Dog Canyon. He lived in a two-room rock and adobe home. Rochas planted an orchard and built retaining walls on the ridges that flank the canyon. His home is marked by a partly reconstructed cabin on <b>the</b> <b>interpretive</b> trail that is west of the park's visitor center.|$|E
25|$|Shoujo, as a tradition, {{is defined}} by this {{contrast}} against a prevailing and dominant masculine culture. Its female-ness is incalculable and omnipresent. Rather than taking comfort {{in the knowledge that}} this difference exists, Hagio uses her narratives to question its very foundation, specifically, gender. By undermining the reader's sense of gender and applying scrutiny to <b>the</b> <b>interpretive</b> structures related to it, she is calling into question the very conventions that define the work that they are reading.|$|E
25|$|In {{connection}} with Jane Jacobs Day in Toronto, two dozen free neighborhood {{walks in the}} city were offered that weekend (May 5, 2007) as an active memorial to Jacobs, and were dubbed Jane's Walks. A Jane's Walk event was later held in New York on September 29 and 30, 2007. In 2008, the event spread to eight cities and towns throughout Canada, and by 2016, Jane's Walks were taking place in 212 cities in 36 countries, on six continents. <b>The</b> <b>interpretive</b> walks typically apply ideas Jacobs identified or espoused to local areas, which are explored on foot and sometimes by bicycle. The walks normally take place in early May, on or close to her May 4 birthday. Walks are organized and led by local volunteers, coordinated by a headquarters office in Toronto. There are more than 200 walks offered in Toronto, alone, in 2016, taking place May 6, 7 and 8.|$|E

25|$|In 1991, the Joseph N. Nicollet Tower and Interpretive Center were {{constructed}} in Sisseton, South Dakota near the path Nicollet {{had taken from}} Devil's Lake back to Fort Snelling on his final expedition. A banker and Sisseton resident became fascinated with Nicollet's story and work after reading Joseph N. Nicollet on the Plains and Prairies, a translation of Nicollet's journals, and raised $335,000 from seven local donors to build the monument. The 80 feet tall tower with 96 steps was primarily built of Douglas-fir from Idaho with concrete pillars and steel bolts. From the top, six counties in three states (South Dakota, North Dakota, and Minnesota) can be seen, {{a view of the}} Laurentian Divide, the Coteau des Prairies and the ancient glacial valley that Nicollet mapped. <b>The</b> <b>Interpretive</b> Center houses 2,400 square feet of classroom space and exhibits, including Nicollet's map and a mural of Nicollet's meeting with Wanata, chief of the Yankton Dakota.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the years}} an {{increased}} emphasis {{was placed on}} wilderness conservation and commercial expansion within Riding Mountain National Park was limited. In 1965 the Tribune reported half a million visitors were entering the park annually. In 1970 Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip, Prince Charles and Princess Anne visited the park during their tour of Manitoba. In 1983 on the fiftieth anniversary of the park's opening a monument was erected south of <b>the</b> <b>interpretive</b> centre. In 1991 land removed from the Keeseekoowenin Objiway First Nation in 1930 by the Department of the Interior was returned to them after a land claim. In 2013, Riding Mountain National Park celebrated the 80th anniversary of the creation and opening of the park. It was the first National Park in Manitoba, {{and one of the first}} in western Canada. Anniversary celebrations included a re-enactment of the official park opening ceremony, along with year-long arts, culture and wildlife programs.|$|E
25|$|Craig {{argues that}} the best {{explanation}} of these three events is that God raised Jesus from the dead. He rejects alternative theories such as Lüdemann's hallucination hypothesis as lacking explanatory scope, explanatory power, and sufficient historical knowledge to support the psychoanalysis Lüdemann performs. Craig's historical case for the resurrection employ's standard historical practices for weighing historical hypotheses concluding that the resurrection is a better match to the available historical data. Specifically, Craig argues, that if one does not begin {{with the assumption that}} there is no God, there is a higher probability of the resurrection hypothesis than of its negation, so the resurrection hypothesis is improbable only if one begins with unsupported assumptions. Craig also notes that a miraculous explanation of the evidence is increased when one locates the resurrection of Jesus in the context of Jesus' ministry and personal statements. This context, Craig argues, provides <b>the</b> <b>interpretive</b> key to the meaning of Jesus' resurrection as the divine vindication of the allegedly blasphemous statements for which Jesus was tried and executed.|$|E

500|$|Thio {{has argued}} that a court convened to {{determine}} whether the right to vote exists in the Constitution would give serious weight to the Minister of Law's pronouncements on the status of the right, as to agree with it would affirm rather than challenge executive or legislative power. Also, section 9A of the Interpretation Act requires a purposive interpretation of written law, including the Constitution, to [...] "promote the purpose or object underlying the written law". Sections 9A(3)(c) and (d) identify ministerial speeches made at the second readings of bills or [...] "any relevant material in any official record of debates in Parliament" [...] as appropriate aspects of <b>the</b> <b>interpretive</b> matrix.

[...] Another track, [...] "No Me Queda Más" [...] uses the identical style of ranchera songs, with the female singer agonizing over {{the end of a}} relationship.

500|$|Morleigh Steinberg {{has been}} working {{together}} with Japanese choreographer and dancer Oguri since the early 1990s, documenting Oguri's severe, Butoh-derived style of dance in various environments, including Joshua Tree National Park and Los Angeles. She made her directorial debut in 1994 with the short subject Traveling Light, which featured <b>the</b> <b>interpretive</b> dance of Oguri and her sister Roxanne, {{who is also a}} modern dancer and choreographer and married to Oguri. A review of the film on DVD Talk said that [...] "Moreleigh Steinberg's dance-filled daydream about relationships in freefall will be difficult for some to appreciate (the mostly modern dance is very insular and odd), but the brilliant cinematic mood created by the director helps us over the slightly strange nature of it all." [...] (In 2006 the film was included in a DVD release of the Francis Ford Coppola-produced claymation film of William S. Burroughs' The Junky's Christmas.) Despite having no formal training in it, Steinberg also began working as a lighting designer, serving in that role for 1995 and 1997 productions of Oguri works. In 1999, Steinberg was selected for a ten-week National Dance/Media Project fellowship at the University of California, Los Angeles.|$|E
