40|$|Graduation date: 1989 The {{emission}} of sulfur oxides from anthropogenic sources represents {{a potential threat}} to terrestrial ecosystems. Sulfate, the most highly oxidized form of sulfur, {{is the most common}} form of inorganic sulfur in most soil environments. The sorption of sulfate may influence the alkalinity of the soil solution and as a consequence the pH of surface waters. Batch experiments were performed to determine the influence of pH, total sulfate concentration and solubility of the adsorbent on the sorption of sulfate by kaolinite. Proton surface charge density for kaolinite was determined over a solution pH range from 3. 5 to 11. 0 in the absence and presence of sulfate (10. 99 to 526. 3 μM) in 0. 1 M NaCl 0 ₄ at 298 K. Total aluminum (Al[subscript TS]) and silica (Si[subscript TS]) concentrations were measured as a function of pH after varying reaction times (2 to 60 h). The dissolution of kaolinite was incongruent (Al[subscript TS]/Si[subscript TS] ≠ 1) over the entire pH range. Proton adsorption by edge surface functional groups of kaolinite, corrected for proton consuming dissolution reactions, showed no influence of the reaction time. Titration data were modeled by the nonlinear least squares fitting routine FITEQL to obtain intrinsic proton complexation constants. Aluminol, aquo and silanol groups were found to undergo complexation reactions. Average values over all reaction times and total sulfate concentrations for log K₋ (int) and log K₊ (int) were - 9. 3 and 7. 3 for aluminol and aquo groups, and - 5. 2 and 4. 9 for silanol groups, respectively. The total concentration of surface sites was 1. 74 <b>cmol</b> <b>kg⁻¹.</b> This higher value, in comparison to the theoretically determined concentration, could be explained by differences in the particle size of kaolinite. Kinetics of sulfate sorption by kaolinite KGa- 1, determined in a stirred batch reaction in 0. 1 M NaCl 0 ₄ for a suspension density of 33. 33 g L⁻¹ at pH 4. 5 and 6. 5 were rapid. No sorption reaction could be observed after 1 min reaction time. Sulfate sorption was independent of pH and increased linearly with the free sulfate concentration. Linear regressions resulted in an overall partition coefficient for sulfate of 7. 8 L kg⁻¹ (R² - 0. 99) between solid and solution. A multiple regression model showed that pH was not a significant variable in determining the amount of sulfate sorbed. Specific adsorption by edge surface groups via ligand exchange could be excluded, mainly due to the complete lack of a pH influence on sulfate sorption. Precipitation of a sparingly soluble aluminum sulfate mineral was considered a possible mechanism controlling sulfate concentration in solution. The solubility of several aluminum and aluminum sulfate minerals was computed using the solution speciation program MICROQL. Precipitation of basaluminite, a basic aluminum sulfate mineral present in acid sulfate soils, was found to be possible within the pH range from 5. 0 to 6. 0. However, no conclusive evidence can be presented for precipitation being the mechanism of sulfate sorption in presence of kaolinite...|$|R

Regulation of the abundance of TRPV 5 at the cell surface is critical in body Ca(2 +) homeostasis. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying TRPV 5 endo- and exocytosis. Here, we show that TRPV 5 is constitutively internalized in a dynamin- and clathrin-dependent manner. Internalized TRPV 5 first appears in small vesicular structures and then localizes to perinuclear structures positive for Rab 11 a. TRPV 5 has a half-life of more than 8 h and is stable even after internalization from the cell surface for more than 3 h. Disruption of cell surface delivery of newly synthesized TRPV 5 by brefeldin A does not reduce TRPV 5 -mediated Ca(2 +) influx in cells, suggesting the presence of a stable intracellular pool of the channel capable of recycling back to the surface.

40|$|We have {{examined}} the effects of depleting lumenal Ca 2 + on the synthesis, phosphorylation and secretion of caseins in lactating mouse mammary cells by using inhibitors of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2 +) -ATPase or the ionophore ionomycin in the absence of external Ca 2 +. Treatment with these drugs resulted in a transient increase in the cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration due to Ca 2 + mobilization. Protein synthesis over a 1 h period was substantially inhibited by Ca 2 + depletion, but in a pulse-chase protocol secretion of pre-synthesized proteins was unaffected by Ca 2 + depletion. Analysis of polysome profiles showed that Ca 2 + depletion resulted in a loss of polysomes, consistent with an inhibition of initiation of protein synthesis. Neither <b>treatment</b> with <b>Ca(2</b> +) -ATPase inhibitors to deplete endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 + nor treatment with ionomycin/EGTA had any effect on an early phase of phosphorylation of alpha- or beta/gamma-caseins, but Ca 2 + depletion resulted in a decrease in a late phase of casein phosphorylation. These results indicate that lumenal Ca 2 + is required to maintain protein synthesis in lactating mammary cells but is not required for protein secretion, and that Ca 2 + accumulation in the Golgi cisternae is required for a late but not for an early phase of casein phosphorylation...|$|R

After an apparent lag phase of about 60 s, both chitin fragments and beta-glucan elicitors caused a rapid increase in cytosolic Ca concentration, which peaked within 2 - 2. 5 min of <b>treatment.</b> The <b>Ca(2</b> +) concentration then decreased and reached the basal level after about 5 min {{in the case of}} the treatment with chitin fragments, while a second rise in the Ca(2 +) concentration with a maximum occurring after about 7 - 8 min was observed in the case of beta-glucan treatment. Calibration of the signals showed that the elicitors enhanced the cytosolic Ca(2 +) concentration from resting concentrations as low as 0. 1 mu M to highest levels of about 2 mu M. Dose-response experiments showed that the concentration of elicitors giving a Ca(2 +) response at the 50 % level was 0. 4 nM for the chitin fragment and 28 mu M and 72 mu M, respectively, for a synthetic hepta-beta-glucoside and a fungal beta-glucan fraction.

40|$|Given {{the safety}} {{concerns}} expressed over negative cardiovascular outcomes {{resulting from the}} clinical use of rosiglitazone, and the view that rosiglitazone exerts PPARγ-independent effects alongside its insulin-sensitising PPARγ-dependent effects, we hypothesised that rosiglitazone may trigger Unfolded Protein Responses (UPRs) due to disruptions in [Ca(2 +) ](i) homeostasis within two cardiovascular cell types: monocytic (MM 6) and vascular smooth muscle (A 7 r 5) cells. In microsomal samples derived from both cell types, pre-incubation with rosiglitazone rapidly (30 min) brought about concentration-dependent PPARγ-independent inhibition of Ca(2 +) ATPase activity (IC(50) ∼ 2 μM). Fluo- 3 fluorimetric data demonstrated in intact cells that 1 h treatment with 1 or 10 μM rosiglitazone caused Ca(2 +) ions to leak into the cytoplasm. Gene expression analysis showed that within 4 h of rosiglitazone exposure, the UPR transcription factor XBP- 1 was activated (likely due to corresponding ER Ca(2 +) depletion), and the UPR target genes BiP and SERCA 2 b were subsequently upregulated within 24 - 72 h. After 72 h 1 or 10 μM rosiglitazone <b>treatment,</b> microsomal <b>Ca(2</b> +) ATPase activity increased to > 2 -fold of that seen in control microsomes, while [Ca(2 +) ](i) returned to basal, indicating that UPR-triggered SERCA 2 b upregulation was responsible for enhanced enzymatic Ca(2 +) sequestration within the ER. This appeared to be sufficient to replenish ER Ca(2 +) stores and restore normal cell physiology, as cell viability levels were not decreased due to rosiglitazone treatment throughout a 2 -week study. Thus, incubation with 1 - 10 μM rosiglitazone triggers the UPR, but does not prove cytotoxic, in cells of the cardiovascular system.

We identified two previously undocumented disulfide bridges in the crystal structure of properly folded S 100 A 3 : one disulfide bridge is between Cys 30 in the N-terminal pseudo-EF-hand and Cys 68 in the C-terminal EF-hand (SS 1), and another disulfide bridge attaches Cys 99 in the C-terminal coil structure to Cys 81 in helix IV (SS 2). Mutational disruption of SS 1 (C 30 A+C 68 A) abolished the Ca(2 +) binding property of S 100 A 3 and retarded the citrullination of Arg 51 by peptidylarginine deiminase type III (PAD 3), while SS 2 disruption inversely increased both Ca(2 +) affinity and PAD 3 reactivity in vitro. Similar backbone structures of wild type, R 51 A, and C 30 A+C 68 A indicated that neither Arg 51 conversion by PAD 3 nor SS 1 alters the overall dimer conformation. Comparative inspection of atomic coordinates refined to 2. 15 - 1. 40 Å resolution shows that SS 1 renders the C-terminal classical Ca(2 +) -binding loop flexible, which are essential for its Ca(2 +) binding properties, whereas SS 2 structurally shelters Arg 51 in the metal-free form.

We reveal that D-serine release is inhibited by removal of extracellular calcium and augmented by increasing extracellular calcium or after <b>treatment</b> with the <b>Ca(2</b> +) ionophore A 23187. Furthermore, release of the amino acid is considerably reduced after depletion of thapsigargin-sensitive intracellular Ca(2 +) stores or chelation of intracellular Ca(2 +) with 1, 2 -bis(2 -aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetate-acetoxymethyl ester. Interestingly, D-serine release also was markedly reduced by concanamycin A, a vacuolar-type H(+) -ATPase inhibitor, indicating a role for the vesicular proton gradient in the transmitter storage/release. In addition, agonist-evoked D-serine release was sensitive to tetanus neurotoxin. Finally, immunocytochemical and sucrose density gradient analysis revealed that a large fraction of D-serine colocalized with synaptobrevin/VAMP 2, suggesting that it is stored in VAMP 2 -bearing vesicles.

40|$|Aromatase {{converts}} androgens into estrogens and its expression within adipose stromal cells (ASCs) {{is believed}} to be the major driver of estrogen-dependent cancers in older women. Ghrelin is a gut-hormone that is involved in the regulation of appetite and known to bind to and activate the cognate ghrelin receptor, GHSR 1 a. The unacylated form of ghrelin, des-acyl ghrelin, binds weakly to GHSR 1 a but has been shown to play an important role in regulating a number of physiological processes. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of ghrelin and des-acyl ghrelin on aromatase in primary human ASCs. Primary human ASCs were isolated from adipose tissue of women undergoing cosmetic surgery. Real-time PCR and tritiated water-release assays were performed to examine the effect of treatment on aromatase transcript expression and aromatase activity, respectively. Treatments included ghrelin, des-acyl ghrelin, obestatin, and capromorelin (GHSR 1 a agonist). GHSR 1 a protein expression was assessed by Western blot and effects of <b>treatment</b> on <b>Ca(2</b> +) and cAMP second messenger systems were examined using the Flexstation assay and the Lance Ultra cAMP kit, respectively. Results demonstrate that pM concentrations of ghrelin and des-acyl ghrelin inhibit aromatase transcript expression and activity in ASCs under basal conditions and in PGE 2 -stimulated cells. Moreover, the effects of ghrelin and des-acyl ghrelin are mediated via effects on aromatase promoter PII-specific transcripts. Neither the GHSR 1 a-specific agonist capromorelin nor obestatin had any effect on aromatase transcript expression or activity. Moreover, GHSR 1 a protein was undetectable by Western blot and neither ghrelin nor capromorelin elicited a calcium response in ASCs. Finally, ghrelin caused a significant decrease in basal and forskolin-stimulated cAMP in ASC. These findings suggest that ghrelin acts at alternate receptors in ASCs by decreasing intracellular cAMP levels. Ghrelin mimetics may be useful in the treatment of estrogen-dependent breast cancer.

As oncogenesis may be associated to the capability of tumor cells to grow independently on Ca(2 +) influx, it is important to assess whether SOCE regulates EPC-dependent angiogenesis also in tumor patients. The present study employed Ca(2 +) imaging, recombinant sub-membranal and mitochondrial aequorin, real-time polymerase chain reaction, gene silencing techniques and western blot analysis to investigate the expression and the role of SOCE in EPCs isolated from peripheral blood of patients affected by renal cellular carcinoma (RCC; RCC-EPCs) as compared to control EPCs (N-EPCs). SOCE, activated by either pharmacological (i. e. cyclopiazonic acid) or physiological (i. e. ATP) stimulation, was significantly higher in RCC-EPCs and was selectively sensitive to BTP- 2, and to the trivalent cations, La(3 +) and Gd(3 +). Furthermore, 2 -APB enhanced thapsigargin-evoked SOCE at low concentrations, whereas higher doses caused SOCE inhibition. Conversely, the anti-angiogenic drug, carboxyamidotriazole (CAI), blocked both SOCE and the intracellular Ca(2 +) release. SOCE was associated to the over-expression of Orai 1, Stim 1, and transient receptor potential channel 1 (TRPC 1) at both mRNA and protein level The intracellular Ca(2 +) buffer, BAPTA, BTP- 2, and CAI inhibited RCC-EPC proliferation and tubulogenesis. The genetic suppression of Stim 1, Orai 1, and TRPC 1 blocked CPA-evoked SOCE in RCC-EPCs.

Here, the concurrent role of Ca(2 +) and eDNA in mediating bacterial aggregation and biofilm formation was studied for the first time using a variety of bacterial strains and the thermodynamics of DNA to Ca(2 +) binding. It was found that the eDNA concentrations under both planktonic and biofilm growth conditions were different among bacterial strains.

In the vertebrate retina, large Ca(2 +) -activated Cl(-) currents (ICl(Ca)) regulate synaptic transmission at photoreceptor terminals; however, the molecular identity of CaCCs that mediate ICl(Ca) remains unclear.

Despite the fact that tmem 16 a was first cloned in the retina, there is little information on its cellular localization and function in the mammalian retina. In this study, we found that ANO 1 was abundantly expressed as puncta in 2 synaptic layers. More specifically, ANO 1 immunoreactivity was observed in the presynaptic terminals of various retinal neurons, including photoreceptors.

Targeting this intracellular pathway pharmacologically using the NAADP antagonist Ned- 19 or genetically using Tpcn 2 (-/-) mice was found to inhibit angiogenic responses to VEGF in vitro and in vivo. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) Ned- 19 abolished VEGF-induced Ca(2 +) release, impairing phosphorylation of ERK 1 / 2, Akt, eNOS, JNK, cell proliferation, cell migration, and capillary-like tube formation.

So far, no information about KCa 3. 1 expression and their role in HSC exists. Aim was to quantify the KCa 3. 1 expression in HSC depending on HSC activation and investigation of antifibrotic properties of the specific KCa 3. 1 inhibitor TRAM- 34 in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: KCa 3. 1 expression and functionality were studied in TGF-β 1 -activated HSC by quantitative real time PCR, western-blot and patch-clamp analysis respectively. Effects of TRAM- 34 on HSC proliferation, cell cycle and fibrosis-related gene expression were assessed by [(3) H]-thymidine incorporation, FACS-analysis and RT-PCR respectively. In vivo, vascular resistance and KCa 3. 1 gene and protein expression were determined in bile duct ligated rats by in situ liver perfusion, Taqman PCR and immunohistochemistry respectively. RESULTS: Fibrotic tissues and TGF-β 1 -activated HSC exhibited higher KCa 3. 1 -expressions than normal tissue and untreated cells. KCa 3. 1 inhibition with TRAM- 34 reduced HSC proliferation by induction of cell cycle arrest and reduced TGF-β 1 -induced gene expression of collagen I, alpha-smooth muscle actin and TGF-β 1 itself. Furthermore, TRAM- 34 blocked TGF-β 1 -induced activation of TGF-β signalling in HSC. In vivo, TRAM- 34 reduced the thromboxane agonist-induced portal perfusion pressure.
