40|$|Prediction <b>of</b> <b>chip</b> form {{produced}} during machining process {{is an important}} work when considering workpiece surface creation and possible damage caused by chips generated during machining. The paper presents a set of new results <b>of</b> cutting <b>chip</b> formation from the latest FEM model development. Generally three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>chips,</b> namely, continuous, serrated and discontinuous chips, are generated during metal machining. The formation <b>of</b> these three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>chips</b> is investigated in relation to various influential factors, such as rake angles and depth of cuts.

40|$|Determination of {{accurate}} {{limit of}} cutting condition {{in order to}} obtain broken chips for various chip breaker geometries is essential to improve the machinability. This work presents a hybrid model based on the ratio of broken chip radius to the initial radius of chip to predict the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>chip</b> regarding the characteristics of a chip breaker geometry and cutting parameters. An analytical geometrical model was developed to calculate the initial radius of chip. After running experimental tests for four types of chip breaker geometries and calculation of their chip ratio, type of chips and tool–chip contact were selected as two criteria for classifying chip ratio into three limits representing usable, acceptable, and unacceptable chips. Finally, the normalized data were used to train a neural network model to predict the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>chip</b> which was verified by experiments carried out on a new chip breaker geometry.

50|$|Chip {{shooters}} {{are being}} used {{for as much as}} 90% of the most common components, like passives and small actives. Chip shooters are fast (20,000 to 80,000 per hour, can be as fast as 100,000 per hour) with a relatively low accuracy (generally 70 µm). As a result, chip shooters are not used for placing active components, which require better accuracy. There are three major <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>chip</b> shooters: stationary turret, overhead gentry, and revolver head.|$|R
