Morgan issued an apology and continued with his starring role. 30 Rock had previously received an award from GLAAD, commending the show on its portrayal of LGBT themes and characters. The scandal inspired the second episode of the season, in which Tracy Jordan goes on an offensive rant during a standup set, forcing the show to apologize on his behalf after he mistakenly apologizes to Glad, <b>the</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>bag</b> company, instead of GLAAD.|$|E

The majority of seeds that fall from the cone are not viable so need to be sorted to retain the plump and dark ones. These can then be sown on top of seed raising mix and watered. Once the water has drained through the mix, the pot should be placed in a plastic bag and refrigerated for two weeks. After this, the pot should be removed from <b>the</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>bag</b> and placed somewhere warm but not very sunny until the seed germinates (remembering to keep them moist but not wet).

2500|$|Examination of the tequila bottle {{found near}} the body found {{a mix of}} Nelson's blood and adipose tissue on the bottle. Forensic {{scientist}} Marie Campbell stated that this was normally {{the result of a}} wounding injury causing bleeding and body fat to become mixed, and that similar results were observed on knives examined after stabbings. In this instance, the stains on the tequila bottle [...] "did not have the distinctive pattern she would have expected" [...] if the bottle had been used directly as a weapon. When found, the body had a plastic bag partly melted over much of the face, bruising inside the lip, two black eyes and bleeding inside her skull. Pathologists said [...] "some form of throttling or suffocating was the most probable cause of death" [...] and she may have been suffocated with <b>the</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>bag</b> or there might have been pressure applied to the neck. Bell said: [...] "There were findings at post-mortem consistent with assault, with such a manner of death in keeping with the circumstances in which her body was found. As to the actual mechanism of her death, perhaps the most likely cause has been some form of asphyxia. I cannot exclude the possibility that sharp force injury has been the cause of her death, or blunt force trauma." [...] The cause of death was officially recorded as unascertained.|$|E
2500|$|Both games feature three 'levels' of execution, {{with each}} level {{progressively}} more violent and graphic than the last. Level 1 executions are quick {{and not very}} bloody, Level 2 are considerably more gory, and Level 3 are over-the-top blood-soaked murders. The player him/herself is entirely in control of which level they use; once the player has locked onto an enemy, the lock-on reticule changes color over time to indicate the level; white (level 1), yellow (level 2), and, finally, red (level 3). As an example, in the first game, if using <b>the</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>bag,</b> a level 1 kill involves the player simply using the bag to suffocate the enemy. A level 2 kill involves him placing the bag over the enemy's head and kneeing them repeatedly in the face. A level 3 kill sees him strangle the enemy and turn them around to punch them in the face, whilst the enemy struggles to free himself and gasps for air. Eventually, he snaps the enemy's neck. For the sequel, although the basic gameplay remained the same, numerous changes {{were made to the}} mechanics. For example, players were given more choices in terms of executing enemies. As well as the three levels of execution per weapon, plays could now use firearms for executions. Two further additions to the execution system were [...] "environmental executions" [...] whereby the play could use elements of the game world (such as manhole covers, telephones, fuse boxes, toilets etc) to eliminate opponents, and [...] "jump executions" [...] whereby players can attack enemies from above by leaping off a ledge.|$|E
