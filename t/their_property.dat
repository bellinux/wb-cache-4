5|$|A direct {{consequence}} of the invasion was the almost total elimination of the old English aristocracy {{and the loss of}} English control over the Catholic Church in England.

The Domesday Book meticulously documents the impact of this colossal programme of expropriation, revealing that by 1086 only about 5 per cent of land in England south of the Tees was left in English hands. Even this tiny residue was further diminished in the decades that followed, the elimination of native landholding being most complete in southern parts of the country.|$|E
