5|$|Wolves may {{encounter}} striped hyenas in Israel, Central Asia and India, usually in disputes over carcasses. Striped hyenas feed extensively on wolf-killed carcasses {{in areas where}} the two species interact. One-to-one, hyenas dominate wolves, and may prey on them, but wolf packs can drive off single or outnumbered hyenas. However, there was a case of a female striped hyena dominating 12 Arabian wolves. <b>Two</b> <b>cases</b> are known however from southern Israel, where wolves and striped hyenas associated closely with each other in an apparently amicable way.|$|E
5|$|A simple rule {{of thumb}} is that for {{high-pressure}} areas, where generally air flows from the center outward, the coriolis force given by the earth's rotation to the air circulation is in the opposite direction of earth's apparent rotation if viewed from above the hemisphere's pole. So, both the earth and winds around a low-pressure area rotate counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere, and clockwise in the southern. The opposite to these <b>two</b> <b>cases</b> occurs {{in the case of a}} high. These results derive from the Coriolis effect; that article explains in detail the physics, and provides an animation of a model to aid understanding.|$|E

The IOC conceded in the first <b>two</b> <b>cases,</b> but refused to ban New Zealand on the grounds that rugby was not an Olympic sport.
