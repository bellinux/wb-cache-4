5|$|Optical {{heterodyne}} detection {{is an essential}} technique used in high-accuracy measurements of the frequencies of optical sources, {{as well as in}} the stabilization of their frequencies. Until a relatively few years ago, lengthy frequency chains were needed to connect the microwave frequency of a cesium or other atomic <b>time</b> <b>source</b> to optical frequencies. At each step of the chain, a frequency multiplier would be used to produce a harmonic of the frequency of that step, which would be compared by {{heterodyne detection}} with the next step (the output of a microwave source, far infrared laser, infrared laser, or visible laser). Each measurement of a single spectral line required several years of effort in the construction of a custom frequency chain. Currently, optical frequency combs have provided a much simpler method of measuring optical frequencies. If a mode-locked laser is modulated to form a train of pulses, its spectrum is seen to consist of the carrier frequency surrounded by a closely spaced comb of optical sideband frequencies with a spacing equal to the pulse repetition frequency (Fig.16). The pulse repetition frequency is locked to that of the frequency standard, and the frequencies of the comb elements at the red end of the spectrum are doubled and heterodyned with the frequencies of the comb elements at the blue end of the spectrum, thus allowing the comb to serve as its own reference. In this manner, locking of the frequency comb output to an atomic standard can be performed in a single step. To measure an unknown frequency, the frequency comb output is dispersed into a spectrum. The unknown frequency is overlapped with the appropriate spectral segment of the comb and the frequency of the resultant heterodyne beats is measured.|$|E
25|$|The {{protocol}} {{is usually}} {{described in terms}} of a client-server model, but can as easily be used in peer-to-peer relationships where both peers consider the other to be a potential <b>time</b> <b>source.</b> Implementations send and receive timestamps using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) on port number 123. They can also use broadcasting or multicasting, where clients passively listen to time updates after an initial round-trip calibrating exchange. NTP supplies a warning of any impending leap second adjustment, but no information about local time zones or daylight saving time is transmitted.|$|E

5000|$|Maintaining {{accurate}} time {{is important}} in computer systems. For example, in a transaction-processing system the recovery process reconstructs the transaction data from log files. If time stamps are used for transaction-data logging, and the time stamps of two related transactions are transposed from the actual sequence, then {{the reconstruction of the}} transaction database may not match the state before the recovery process. Server Time Protocol (STP) can be used to provide a single <b>time</b> <b>source</b> between multiple servers. Based on Network Time Protocol concepts, one of the System z servers is designated by the HMC as the primary <b>time</b> <b>source</b> (Stratum 1). It then sends timing signals to the Stratum 2 servers through use of coupling links. The Stratum 2 servers in turn send timing signals to the Stratum 3 servers. To provide availability, one of the servers can be designated as a backup <b>time</b> <b>source,</b> and a third server can be designated as an “Arbiter” to assist the Backup Time Server in determining if it should take the role of the Primary during exception conditions.|$|E

50|$|PPS {{signals are}} used for precise {{timekeeping}} and time measurement. One increasingly common use is in computer timekeeping, including the NTP protocol.

This makes the PC a stratum-1 <b>time</b> <b>source.</b> Note that because the PPS signal does not specify the time, but merely {{the start of a}} second, one must combine the PPS functionality with another <b>time</b> <b>source</b> that provides the full date and time in order to ascertain the time both accurately and precisely.|$|E
