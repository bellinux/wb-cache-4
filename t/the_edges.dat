5|$|Because he was {{painting}} fresco, the plaster was laid {{in a new}} section every day, called a giornata. At {{the beginning of each}} session, <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> would be scraped away and a new area laid down. <b>The</b> <b>edges</b> between giornate remain slightly visible; thus, they give a good idea of how the work progressed. It was customary for fresco painters to use a full-sized detailed drawing, a cartoon, to transfer a design onto a plaster surface—many frescoes show little holes made with a stiletto, outlining the figures. Here Michelangelo broke with convention; once confident the intonaco had been well applied, he drew directly onto the ceiling. His energetic sweeping outlines can be seen scraped into some of the surfaces, while on others a grid is evident, indicating that he enlarged directly onto the ceiling from a small drawing.|$|E

40|$|We {{have found}} a new configurational effect in texture segmentation. In {{addition}} to collinear facilitation at <b>the</b> <b>edge,</b> this effect results from contextual modulation within the texture-region, i. e. from texels not abutting <b>the</b> segmented <b>edge.</b> <b>The</b> largest facilitation was found when two conditions were fulfilled: (i) elements along <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> were parallel to <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> and collinear, (ii) elements in the texture-region were also collinear but non-parallel to <b>the</b> <b>edge.</b> We show that this facilitation occurs when there are groups of different orientation from <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> in <b>the</b> texture-region. We suggest two possible underlying mechanisms: either a region-based process that links collinear iso-oriented elements and locates <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> when <b>the</b> orientation changes, or else second-order filters tuned to orientation differences rather than orientation per se...|$|R
