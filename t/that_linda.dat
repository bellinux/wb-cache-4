5|$|Whitney {{decides to}} give Lee another chance on the {{condition}} that he will never assault her again, therefore he should seek anger management therapy. Lee gratefully accepts for the sake of their marriage. However, on Valentine's Day, Lee leaves Whitney, leaving a handwritten note on their bed saying he no longer loves her.

Lee attempts to call Whitney but Woody tells Lee that she does not want to speak to him, so Lee sends his friend Moose (Sam Gittins) to see her, who says that Lee wants a divorce. Whitney receives a letter from Lee's solicitor, citing her unreasonable behaviour as grounds for the divorce, but Woody tells her it is not a big deal.

Among other cases, he shows Joe the case of Linda Wishkob, a white woman who had been abandoned by her family because of her birth defects. Linda was subsequently adopted into the Wishkob (Ojibwe) family and lived with them on reservation land.

40|$|This thesis investigates event-based {{behavioural}} model debugging in Linda. A {{study is}} presented of the Linda parallel programming paradigm, its amenability to debugging, {{and a model}} for debugging Linda programs using Milner's CCS. In support {{of the construction of}} expected behaviour models, a Linda program specification language is proposed. A behaviour recognition engine that is based on such specifications is also discussed. It is shown <b>that</b> <b>Linda's</b> distinctive characteristics make it amenable to debugging without the usual problems associated with paraUel debuggers. Furthermore, it is shown that a behavioural model debugger, based on the proposed specification language, effectively exploits the debugging opportunity. The ideas developed in the thesis are demonstrated in an experimental Modula- 2 Linda system. ...|$|R

Cameron and Miller meet in-person once a week to discuss the film in detail and talk via phone daily to discuss the writing process. Miller stated that the tone will be the same as the first two films. Cameron and Miller jointly acknowledged that the focus of the film is not to create more sequels or generate revenue, but to instead create the proper sequel, with the goal being to just make a good movie. However, there is a plan for a trilogy that would conclude the story should this first film prove successful.|$|E
25|$|Maggie's {{marriage}} to Mickey Horton {{is central to}} the character, with their relationship being among the most prominent and long-running relationships on the show. Mickey is depicted as a smart, tough lawyer, with Maggie being portrayed as a weak farm girl. Maggie and Mickey were generally depicted as the most stable couple on the show, even after all the torment the two had gone through. During the early years of their marriage, Maggie felt threatened by the presence of his old lover, Linda Patterson, who had pretended to be Maggie's friend but was secretly trying to win Mickey back. Linda had claimed that Mickey was her daughter Melissa's father, but Linda's estranged husband Jim Phillips revealed <b>that</b> <b>Linda</b> had lied. While Linda went on to other relationships (including Mickey's brother Tommy and the wealthy Bob Anderson whom she married), she continued to remain a thorn in Maggie's side. After Bob Anderson's death, Melissa ran away from the neglectful Linda and eventually Mickey and Maggie took her in, sending her to a private school outside of Salem.|$|E
