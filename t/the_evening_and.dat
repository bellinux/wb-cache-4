The division split, with one half marching south towards Basse-Terre and the other north. Neither met serious opposition, the militia forces deserting in large numbers and abandoning their fortifications as the British approached. Messages were sent by the approaching British ordering the surrender of towns and forts, and both forces made rapid progress over the following two days. On 30 January, Ernouf took up a position with his remaining garrison in the Beaupère–St. Louis Ridge highlands that guarded the approaches to Basse-Terre, Hislop forming his men in front of Ernouf's position. Later in the day, Harcourt's men came ashore to the north of Basse-Terre, outflanking the strongest French positions at Trois-Rivières and forcing their withdrawal to Basse-Terre itself.|$|E

We study the question of which links in the 3 -sphere can be obtained as closures of a given 1 -manifold in an unknotted solid torus in the 3 -sphere (or genus- 1 tangle) by adjoining another 1 -manifold in the complementary solid torus. We distinguish between <b>even</b> <b>and</b> odd closures, <b>and</b> define <b>even</b> <b>and</b> odd versions of the Kauffman bracket ideal. These <b>even</b> <b>and</b> odd Kauffman bracket ideals are used to obstruct <b>even</b> <b>and</b> odd tangle closures.

5|$|Barnes {{was born}} in the Small Heath area of Birmingham, in the shadow of St Andrew's, the home stadium of Birmingham City. Support for Birmingham City ran in the family; his uncle played for the club in the 1920s. In 1943, aged 14, he began work at the Post Office. He played {{football}} for the works team, and quickly received an invitation to play for Moor Green, one of the strongest amateur teams in the area. His performances for Moor Green resulted in interest from Birmingham City, and Barnes became part of their junior team, Birmingham City Colts. Barnes worked at the Post Office during the day, trained with Moor Green in <b>the</b> <b>evening,</b> <b>and</b> played for Birmingham City Colts at the weekend. However, the Colts stopped selecting Barnes after a clash of matches, in which Barnes chose to play for a local team instead of the Colts. Barnes then resumed playing for Moor Green.|$|E

The media coverage resulted in knowledge of Richard spreading world-wide, with interest in her expressed in Yugoslavia, Croatia, Australia, and Africa. Approximately a thousand people attended anniversary masses there in both 1991 and 1999, with about 400 attending in 2007, and thousands come to her grave each year, including chartered buses from New Orleans.|$|E
5|$|DST's {{potential}} {{to save energy}} comes primarily from its effects on residential lighting, which consumes about 3.5% of electricity in the United States and Canada. Delaying the nominal time of sunset and sunrise reduces the use of artificial light in <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> <b>and</b> increases it in the morning. As Franklin's 1784 satire pointed out, lighting costs are reduced if the evening reduction outweighs the morning increase, as in high-latitude summer when most people wake up well after sunrise. An early goal of DST was to reduce evening usage of incandescent lighting, once a primary use of electricity. Although energy conservation remains an important goal, energy usage patterns have greatly changed since then, and recent research is limited and reports contradictory results. Electricity use is greatly affected by geography, climate, and economics, {{making it hard to}} generalize from single studies.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A novel edge-coupled {{symmetric}} coupled-line coupler {{featuring the}} quasi- 0 -dB couplings at adjacently dual frequencies is presented {{based on the}} composite right/left-handed (CRLH) transmission lines. The fulfillment of dual-frequency quasi- 0 -dB couplings {{is derived from the}} complete backward and complete forward coupling phenomena at the higher and lower operating frequencies, respectively. To this end, the dispersion relations of <b>the</b> <b>even</b> <b>and</b> odd-mode CRLH lines have to be engineered in a particular manner so that: 1) the substantial attenuation level for each mode; 2) the 180 ° phase difference between <b>the</b> <b>even</b> <b>and</b> odd-mode reflection coefficients in the over-lapped stopband region are obtained to accomplish the complete backward coupling; 3) the enabling curve intersection for <b>the</b> <b>even</b> <b>and</b> odd-mode Bloch impedances; and 4) the considerable difference between <b>the</b> <b>even</b> <b>and</b> odd-mode propagation constants in the left-handed regions are obtained to suppress the impedance coupling and attain strong forward coupling. Based on a thorough analysis on <b>the</b> <b>even</b> <b>and</b> odd-mode dispersion characteristics and Bloch impedances of the coupled lines, the operating principle and design procedure for the proposed coupler with dual-band complete couplings can be fully explained and greatly simplified. A symmetric CRLH coupled-line coupler consisting of seven coupled unit cells was experimentally developed and a shielding (metal) box was used to prevent radiation loss in the forward coupling band. Experimental results show that the maximum coupling levels are − 1. 3 and − 0. 9 dB, corresponding to the 3 -dB fractional bandwidths of 15. 8 % and 10. 8 % at the lower and higher operating frequencies, respectively. Good agreement is obtained between the simulated and experimental results.

5|$|Kitti's hog-nosed bat has a brief {{activity}} period, leaving its roost {{for only}} 30 minutes in <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> <b>and</b> 20 minutes at dawn. These short flights are easily interrupted by heavy rain or cold temperatures. During this period, the bat forages within fields of cassava and kapok {{or around the}} tops of bamboo clumps and teak trees, within one kilometre of the roosting site. The wings seem to be shaped for hovering flight, and the gut contents of specimens include spiders and insects that are presumably gleaned off foliage. Nevertheless, most prey is probably caught in flight. Main staples of the bat's diet include small flies (Chloropidae, Agromyzidae, and Anthomyiidae), hymenopterans, and psocopterans.|$|E
5|$|On occasion, the {{convection}} of {{the system}} would flare up, {{and in the early}} morning hours of November 3, the Naval Air Station at Boca Chica, Florida reported winds of 50mph (80km/h), which would mean the depression may have attained tropical storm status. A similar report was filed at the Air Force Station at Cudjoe Key. After another reconnaissance flight was sent out to study the system, and recorded that surface area temperatures had dropped, the flight-level winds had reached 92mph (147km/h) and the surface area pressure had reached 998millibars (29.47 inHg). In <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> <b>and</b> overnight hours of November 3, the tropical depression continued to the northeast, making landfall in Florida at a location near Tampa Bay. The depression crossed Florida, weakening significantly, and becoming extratropical. After emerging from land in the Atlantic Ocean on November 5, the depression had become a low pressure area once again and was last spotted that day near the Carolina Capes.|$|E
