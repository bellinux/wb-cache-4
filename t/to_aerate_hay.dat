50|$|Many batters {{are made}} by {{combining}} dry flours with liquids such as water, milk or eggs. Batters can also be made by soaking grains in water and grinding them wet. Often a leavening agent such as baking powder is included <b>to</b> <b>aerate</b> and fluff up the batter as it cooks, or the mixture may be naturally fermented for this purpose {{as well as to}} add flavour. Carbonated water or another carbonated liquid such as beer may instead be used <b>to</b> <b>aerate</b> the batter in some recipes. The liquid mixture churned and frozen in order to produce ice cream is also referred to as batter, although it does not contain any dry flours or grains.|$|R
50|$|The pick is {{a narrow}} rod or pin {{that can be}} used to clear the shank of debris, or <b>to</b> <b>aerate</b> tightly packed tobacco. Because it is sharp it may scratch the bowl of a pipe, and so should not be used for scraping.|$|R
50|$|An {{ice cream}} maker has to {{simultaneously}} freeze the mixture while churning it so as <b>to</b> <b>aerate</b> the mixture and avoid ice crystals. As a result, most ice creams {{are ready to}} consume immediately. However, those containing alcohol must often be chilled further to attain a firm consistency.|$|R

50|$|An {{air pump}} is a device for pushing air. Examples include a bicycle pump, pumps {{that are used}} <b>to</b> <b>aerate</b> an {{aquarium}} or a pond via an airstone; a gas compressor used to power a pneumatic tool, air horn or pipe organ; a bellows used to encourage a fire; a vacuum cleaner and a vacuum pump.|$|R
5000|$|A {{swan neck}} is a curved spout. [...] This {{is often used}} in {{conjunction}} with a sparkler - a nozzle containing small holes - fitted to the spout <b>to</b> <b>aerate</b> the beer as it enters the glass, giving a frothier head; this presentation style is more popular in the North of England than in the South.|$|R
5000|$|A tedder (also called hay tedder) is {{a machine}} used in haymaking. It is used after cutting and before windrowing, and uses moving forks <b>to</b> <b>aerate</b> or [...] "wuffle" [...] the hay and thus {{speed up the}} process of hay-making. The use of a tedder allows the hay to dry ("cure") better, which results in {{improved}} aroma and color.|$|R
5000|$|One {{traditional}} {{remedy is}} {{to spread the}} grain in thin layers on a floor, where it is turned <b>to</b> <b>aerate</b> it thoroughly. Once the grain is sufficiently dry it can be transferred to a granary for storage. A modern variation on this, {{is to use a}} grain auger to move grain stored in one grainery to another.|$|R
50|$|Substrate {{may also}} be used as part of a {{biological}} filtration system. Beneficial bacteria colonize all aquarium surfaces that are exposed <b>to</b> <b>aerated</b> water, including the substrate. Because the numerous particles have a high surface area, substrates are often employed in biological filtration. Some common types of filtration involving the substrate include the undergravel filter and the deep sand bed.|$|R
50|$|The mammals {{affected}} the environment. For example, the bushpigs which feed on roots, maggots, and insects helped <b>to</b> <b>aerate</b> the trees' root systems. The female giraffes feed on leaves and dispersed plants seeds while their faeces acted as fertiliser. The dung beetles {{also played a}} role by helping bring the manure underground where it is broken down by micro-organisms creating further plant life.|$|R
50|$|Fontaines Boulevard Richard-Lenoir. (1862.) When part of {{the canal}} St. Martin was covered by the Boulevard Richard Lenoir, Davioud built {{a long series of}} fifteen small basins and {{fountain}}s <b>to</b> <b>aerate</b> the water. Each fountain had a spray of water coming from a bouquet of roses made of cast iron. The fountains were rebuilt in a more modern, less picturesque style in the 20th century.|$|R
50|$|Subsurface {{aeration}} {{seeks to}} release bubbles {{at the bottom}} of the water body and allow them to rise by the force of buoyancy. Diffused aeration systems utilize bubbles <b>to</b> <b>aerate</b> as well as mix the water. Water displacement from the expulsion of bubbles can cause a mixing action to occur, and the contact between the water and the bubble will result in an oxygen transfer.|$|R

50|$|Gravel-bottomed riffles in the East Branch Lackawanna River serve <b>to</b> <b>aerate</b> the water, while deep pools {{serve as}} resting areas for fish. A rubble dam {{upstream}} of a livestock crossing forms a swimming {{hole in the}} river. The river has stable streambanks in most reaches. However, there are areas of slight erosion at two bridge crossings and one additional area of heavy erosion near a patch of agricultural land.|$|R
50|$|Landfarming is an ex-situ waste {{treatment}} {{process that is}} performed in the upper soil zone or in biotreatment cells. Contaminated soils, sediments, or sludges are transported to the landfarming site, incorporated into the soil surface and periodically turned over (tilled) <b>to</b> <b>aerate</b> the mixture. Landfarming commonly uses a clay or composite liner to intercept leaching contaminants and prevent groundwater pollution, however, a liner is not a universal requirement.|$|R
40|$|Excess {{phosphorus}} {{in water}} body {{will lead to}} eutrophication. This study investigated the phosphate removal efficiencies of unaerated and aerated filter systems using high composition of Calcium (Ca) steel slag as the filter media at different pH values of the wastewater influents. Lab-scale filters were developed using 25 mg/L synthetic wastewater and weekly sampling was done to monitor the phosphate removal efficiencies together with the concentration of metals (Calcium (Ca) and Magnesium (Mg). The results show that both unaerated and aerated systems have excellent phosphate removal efficiency at all acidic, neutral and alkaline pH feed, though unaerated systems removed slightly better compared <b>to</b> <b>aerated</b> systems; 76 - 98 % and 69 - 97 % respectively. The dominant phosphate removal mechanism for aerated systems was adsorption, meanwhilefor unaerated systems; both adsorption and precipitation for acidic and neutral pH, whileprecipitation was more dominant at basic pH. The performance of unaerated systems are slightly better compared <b>to</b> <b>aerated</b> systems, however, aerated systems are recommended to be applied when simultaneous removal of nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen) are concerned...|$|R
30|$|Deep {{ploughing}} or over-turning (15 cm for rice paddies, 20 cm {{or greater}} for fields) {{to mix and}} bury the tephra {{and in order to}} avoid creating a sandy texture. It was suggested that this could then be followed by a rotary hoe <b>to</b> <b>aerate</b> the soil; however, this step was generally avoided due to fears of bringing tephra back to the surface. Tilling was also avoided as it did not adequately bury the tephra.|$|R
25|$|The high {{intensity}} of the Jameson Cell means that it is much shorter than conventional column flotation cells (see Figure 1), {{and it does not}} require air compressors <b>to</b> <b>aerate</b> the suspension of ground ore particles and water (known as a slurry or pulp) in the flotation cell. The lack of a requirement for compressed air and the lack of moving parts means that power consumption is less than for the equivalent mechanical or conventional column flotation cell.|$|R
5000|$|Tilling uproots all {{the plants}} in the area, turning their roots into food for {{bacteria}} and fungi. This damages their ability <b>to</b> <b>aerate</b> the soil. Living roots drill millions of tiny holes in the soil and thus provide oxygen. They also create room for beneficial insects and annelids (the phylum of worms). Some types of roots contribute directly to soil fertility by funding a mutualistic relationship with certain kinds of bacteria (most famously the rhizobium) that can fix nitrogen.|$|R
50|$|According to the Chinese {{biologists}} {{who have}} studied the wildlife of the Hoh Xil (northern part of the Tibetan Plateau), plateau pikas are the favorite food of the area's brown bears. In addition to {{its role as a}} prey base, the plateau pika is important for soil health in meadows; the burrowing of the species helps <b>to</b> <b>aerate</b> the soil. The species is currently considered threatened, mostly due to aggressive poisoning campaigns by Chinese populations, predominantly to eliminate competition for food with livestock.|$|R

The school calls the system [...] "The Green Machine" [...] and uses it for environmental education, allowing the school's Ecology Club to assist in its development and maintenance.|$|R
30|$|Each mixture was {{carefully}} homogenized, moisture was adjusted to 60  % (optimal value for composting) {{and then the}} mixtures were windrowed. Windrows were turned over by hand weekly <b>to</b> <b>aerate</b> the mixture. Homogeneous samples were taken at T 0 (first day of co-composting) and after each airing (aerating the mixture). Homogeneous samples (1  kg) were obtained by careful mixing of several sub samples taken at different points (height and length) of the windrow and quartering. The samples were kept at − 20  °C before analysis.|$|R
40|$|Vertical pump, pump sprayer, propeller-aspirator-pump, paddle wheel, and diffused-air aerators {{powered by}} {{electric}} motors or by takeoffs from farm tractors are used widely <b>to</b> <b>aerate</b> aquaculture ponds. Performance tests suggested that electric paddle wheel aerators {{are the most}} efficient in transferring oxygen and circulating pond water. A design for a highly efficient paddle wheel aerator is described. Aeration can improve dissolved oxygen concentrations, enhance the efficiency of feed utilization, and increase aquacultural production and profits. Aerator placement {{and the use of}} aerator controllers are discussed...|$|R
