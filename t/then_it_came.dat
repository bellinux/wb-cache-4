5|$|The First Test at Brisbane was {{dominated}} by Australia, a pattern {{that was to be}} a feature of the series, although Barnes contributed only 31 to the total of 645 which brought an innings victory. Barnes displayed his liking for slightly aggressive practical jokes in this match: during a break for a particularly ferocious thunderstorm, he got a huge block of ice out of the tub in which our drinks were kept, staggered {{to the side of the}} dressing-room and tossed it on to the roof over the English dressing-room. It caused a noise for a start that brought all the Englishmen running and <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> over the side of the gutter, crashed on to the lawn and slithered down the grass. Those English eyes certainly did stand out.|$|E
500|$|Since the {{foundation}} of the kingdom, the flag of Portugal was always linked to the Portuguese coat of arms. In fact, until the 19th century, the flag served as a mere support to display the Royal coat of arms, without having any separate meaning. Until the 16th century, the flag consisted in a banner of arms, with its field being totally occupied by the field of the coat of arms, <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> to include the complete coat of arms, including the crown and other external elements laid over a monochrome white field. The flag only acquired a meaning by its own in 1830, when its field was changed from the neutral white to the distinctive blue and white, which were the national colors at that time. Although representing the country since its early beginnings, the flag of Portugal had a limited use until the 19th century, essentially being used as a fortress flag and as naval ensign, with some other flags also existing to represent the nation in other contexts, namely at the sea. In the 19th century, the flag of Portugal started to have an universal use, becoming a real national flag. [...] It evolved in a way that gradually incorporated most of the symbols present on the current coat of arms.|$|E
2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous {{hydrothermal}} feature at West Thumb is a geyser on the lake shore known as Fishing Cone. Walter Trumbull of the 1870 Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition described a unique event while a man was fishing adjacent to the cone: [...] "...in swinging a trout ashore, it accidentally got off the hook and fell into the spring. For a moment it darted about with wonderful rapidity, as if seeking an outlet. <b>Then</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> to the top, dead, and literally boiled." [...] Fishing Cone erupted frequently to the height of 40 feet (12 m) in 1919 and to lesser heights in 1939. One fisherman was badly burned in Fishing Cone in 1921. Fishing at the geyser is now prohibited.|$|E

2500|$|Unruh, who has {{published}} his objections {{on the web}} pages of his university, {{is probably the most}} prominent critic of Afshar's interpretation. He, like Kastner, proceeds by setting up an arrangement that he feels is equivalent but simpler. The size of the effect is larger so that it is easier to see the flaw in the logic. In Unruh's view that flaw is, in the case that an obstacle exists at the position of the dark fringes, [...] "drawing the inference that IF the particle was detected in detector 1, THEN it must have come from path 1. Similarly, IF it were detected in detector 2, <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> from path 2." [...] In other words, he accepts the existence of an interference pattern but rejects the existence of which-way information when Afshar puts in the wire grid.|$|E
2500|$|The win {{attracted}} further {{attention on}} social media because Gun Runner ran the final half mile with a horseshoe caught in his tail: a shoe from Cautious Giant flew loose just as Gun Runner was starting his move. [...] "We watched the tape repeatedly, repeatedly," [...] said Asmussen, [...] "and if you never seen anything before, just wait around. Can you believe that? I mean if we tried to throw one and stick in one's tail as he was standing, still we'd go 0-for-1,000 – let alone at a run, let alone Gun Runner, let alone in the Whitney – and it stayed. [...] how fast he was going , it was held out from him. When he slowed down to walk, <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> into him. We were obviously unaware of it until {{he came back to}} the winner's circle, but not a nick on him. I mean, there's still nails in it." [...] The race improved Gun Runner's rating to 127 in the World's Best Racehorse Rankings August update, maintaining his third place ranking worldwide.|$|E
