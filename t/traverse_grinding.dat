40|$|Shaping of {{the surface}} {{roughness}} in <b>traverse</b> <b>grinding</b> is much more complex compared to plunge grinding. What significantly influences the roughness of the machined surfaces in <b>traverse</b> <b>grinding</b> is the dressing of the grinding wheel, grinding parameters, and {{the form of the}} grinding wheel wear in this proc-ess. The occurrence of wear steps on the active grinding wheel surface (AGWS) causes that the set-up depth of cut is split into the wheel’s different steps, which in turn is a reason of a varying roughness shaped by those steps. The surface-roughness model presented, which includes parameters of the grinding wheel dressing with the single point diamond dresser and grinding parameters, allows us to estimate the size of surface roughness in the process of <b>traverse</b> <b>grinding...</b>|$|E

40|$|Three control {{methods for}} the {{workpiece}} steady based <b>traverse</b> <b>grinding</b> process are examined {{and a new}} approach, termed the dynamic workpiece steady control method, is proposed for improved grinding efficiency and accuracy. This method requires that the motion profiles of the steadies vary dependent upon the wheel position. Mathematical models for a steady based <b>traverse</b> <b>grinding</b> system are presented together with an iterative algorithm for {{the determination of the}} position profiles of the workpiece steadies. A case study of the grinding process is considered to demonstrate the proposed control method and it is shown that a reduction in grinding error and a higher grinding efficiency involves an increase in the force applied by the steadies, which can affect workpiece surface quality. Accordingly a compromise between these parameters has to be made. © 1993...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Cylindrical {{grinding}} is {{an efficient}} and useful method of achieving good dimensional accuracy and fine finish. Very often {{one of the}} main objectives of grinding process is to obtain very good surface finish. The present investigation takes into account the effects of common grinding parameters on surface finish obtained in cylindrical grinding. The material selected is mild steel. The grinding wheel dimensions and its specification are kept in-varied. Grinding parameters like in-feed, longitudinal feed and work speed have been varied at several levels. Surface finish parameter (Ra) has been measured and noted for evaluation of surface finish, by using the instrument Talysurf. These data have been analyzed, interpreted and discussed in the context of varied conditions of cylindrical <b>traverse</b> cut <b>grinding.</b> Apart from identifying relationships between process parameters and surface finish through graphical presentations, a number of techniques (Full Factorial Design, Response Surface Methodology: RSM and MATLAB) have been applied on the experimental data to arrive at some conclusive remarks. The paper effectively shows how selection of process parameters may yield desirable surface finish...|$|R
40|$|When {{considering}} {{the mechanics of}} grinding, several physical phenomena have to be modeled, each one having effect on the resulting grinding forces, wheel and workpiece geometry. Depending on the analyzed problem, some dependencies can be neglected to privilege some aspects instead of others. Nevertheless, all models essentially start considering wheel-workpiece engagement and the corresponding material removal (both wheel and workpiece side), deriving the forces by means of energy balances and/or shear mechanics. The meta-model proposed in this paper represents a general framework conceived for providing a time-domain simulation engine based on a dexel representation of wheel and workpiece, capable to “host” all the semi-empirical models existing in literature, where the overall grinding force {{is the result of}} the integration of the force contributions associated to the local removal along wheel-workpiece engagement arc. A cascade approach is adopted to solve for forces and displacements the DAEs set describing the dynamic interactions between wheel and workpiece, whereas all the algebraic relationships pertaining to the various specific models are solved in a pre-processing phase, yielding a set of response surfaces that are queried during time integration.

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve high {{accuracy}} and surface quality during <b>traverse</b> <b>grinding</b> of long, slender workpieces, multiple workpiece steadies-with soft supporting pads should be used.

40|$|Abstract. Grinding-hardening is a thermo-mechanical process {{capable of}} {{simultaneous}} material removal and surface enhancement. However, there are difficulties {{in dealing with}} cylindrical workpieces, because of the complex 3 D-helical movement of the grinding-induced heat source. This paper investigates the effects of some key grinding parameters on the profile and microstructure variations of the hardened layer generated by a <b>traverse</b> cylindrical <b>grinding,</b> both experimentally and numerically. It {{was found that the}} ratio of the longitudinal wheel feed to the rotational speed of the workpiece R is most influential on the hardened layer profile. A larger R results in a thicker hardened layer but a more pronounced discontinuity of two adjacent hardening zones. Although a smaller R yields a relatively thinner hardened layer, the non-uniformity could be minimised by the overlapping of the grinding heating. The microstructure of the hardened layer can be altered by the tempering in subsequent grinding heating. A thermal analysis with the aid of the finite element method in conjunction with an experimental microstructural examination showed that the temperature distribution in the tempered region would lead to a variation of the precipitated carbide, and that a higher tempering temperature could result in a higher degree of the carbide precipitation and a more significant reduction of hardness...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDuring {{grinding}} processes, numerous grains {{interact with}} the workpiece material producing mechanical and thermal loads on the surface.

40|$|This {{research}} {{considers the}} temperatures {{generated in the}} workpiece during profile and cylindrical <b>traverse</b> <b>grinding</b> in the High Efficiency Deep Grinding (HEDG) regime. The HEDG regime takes large depths of cut at high wheel and workpiece speeds to create a highly efficient material removal process. This aggressive processing generates high temperatures in the contact zone between the wheel and workpiece. However, the beneficial contact angle and the rapid removal of the heated wheel – workpiece contact zone results in low temperatures in the finished surface. Temperatures in the ground surface can be predicted {{with knowledge of the}} specific grinding energy and the grinding parameters used. Specific grinding energies recorded at high specific material removal rates demonstrated a constant value of specific grinding energy dependent on cutting and contact conditions, improving accuracy of the predictive model. This was combined with a new approach to burn threshold modelling, which demonstrated an improved division of damaged and undamaged surfaces. Cutting and contact conditions in the grinding profile vary dependent on their position. This thesis shows how temperatures vary with location and estimates the partitioning of the heat flux to the regions of the grinding profile. This suggested a constant partitioning of energy to each of the three surfaces considered independently of specific material removal rates. Further a potential link was shown between the surface and the sidewall of the grinding profile, which allows temperatures in a secondary surface to be predicted given knowledge of that in the primary. Finally, the work has demonstrated the feasibility of the Superabrasive Turning process. Using small values of feed per turn and high workpiece feedrates promoted high values of removal rate with low depths of thermal penetration in the as ground surface.

40|$|Abstract. Unstable {{grinding}} {{due to the}} {{regenerative chatter}} {{is one of the}} most critical errors and a serious limitation to achieve good surface quality. The machining accuracy of CNC is greatly depending on online detecting, prediction and control ability of abnormal phenomena in machining such as chatter. Based on the mechanism of regenerative chatter, the dynamic models of cylindrical plunging are established by considering both the rotate speed of workpiece and grinding wheel. The <b>traverse</b> <b>grinding</b> can be assumed as the sum of several stepwise plunging grinding with respect to the grinding contact area.

40|$|We present recent {{advances}} in the modelling and simulation of Internal <b>Traverse</b> <b>Grinding,</b> a high performance grinding process incorporating {{a high rate of}} material removal combined with a high surface quality. Due to a special grinding wheel geometry, the latter two goals are achieved in just one pass of the tool through the axisymmetric workpiece. The simulation framework we present generally consists of three components. The first one is a parametric plane strain, h-adaptive finite element model capturing the material penetration of a single cBN grain on a meso-scale during the machining process. Secondly, a topography analysis procedure as well as a kinematic simulation have been developed to measure and analyse the surface topography of an actual grinding wheel. We then use this information to model the grinding wheel surface in the latter kinematic simulation. This enables us to perform an exact calculation of the transient penetration history of every grain intersecting with the workpiece bulk. The superposition of these results is then used in the third component of the simulation framework, namely a process scale workpiece model currently under development which captures the effects of thermo-mechanical loads on the workpiece undergoing material removal and thus, in the near future, shall enable us to predict potential unwanted phase transformations of the bulk surface as well as size and shape errors of the finished part. In this contribution, we will focus on the first two parts of the simulation framework, namely the meso-scale as well as the kinematic simulation and the coupling between the two scales...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays {{machining}} {{in manufacturing}} industry {{has become more}} competitive and demanding than ever before. Grinding {{as one of the}} last stages in the manufacturing process {{has been the focus of}} the research studies in the field of manufacturing for quite some time. Grinding process compared to the other machining operations involves in low rates of material removal. The thermal, metallurgical, and mechanical phenomena coupled with the grinding process, make the contact dynamics unpredictable and complicated; hence the grinding wheel life and cycle times cannot be determined from any available standard tables and charts. This is due to the fact that, a large number of parameters are influencing each other in a grinding process. During a grinding process there are undesirable experiences that can be included as thermal effects, chatter vibration, rapid grinding wheel wear, etc. In order to overcome these problems associated with the grinding process a correct understanding of the involving factors in the process is of great significance. This thesis work is focused on design and implementation of a bench scale plain type cylindrical grinding machine for grinding of the rolls in plunge and traverse cut in the laboratory environment. The servo controlled feed-drives and slide-way motions, which allow an efficient operation, are presented for each axis of the machine. Nonlinear friction effect as one of the major disturbances affecting the motion control systems is identified for the in-feed axis of the machine tool based on LuGre model. A novel method for grinding force estimation by monitoring of the thrust force in the infeed axis is presented based on the identified friction. The implementation of such an approach benefits the low cost compared to the common methods which use the dynamometer sensors for condition monitoring of the grinding process.
