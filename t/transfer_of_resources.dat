25|$|Because of the program, {{economic}} assistance to Latin America nearly tripled between fiscal year 1960 and fiscal year 1961. Between 1962 and 1967 the US supplied $1.4 {{billion per year}} to Latin America. If new investment is included, the amount of aid rose to $3.3 billion per year during this timespan while {{the total amount of}} aid was roughly $22.3 billion. However, the amount of aid did not equal the net <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> and development as Latin American countries still had to pay off their debt to the US and other first world countries. Additionally, profits from the investments usually returned to the US, with profits frequently exceeding new investment.|$|E
500|$|Initially, {{this did}} not appear to be a problem; Borden had long called for the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>resource</b> control to the prairie provinces, but when Sifton and Scott raised the issue with the new Prime Minister, little action resulted. [...] Borden stalled for some time, and it emerged that he did not wish to buoy the {{fortunes}} of the provincial Liberal parties by giving them the political victory that would result from the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>resource</b> control. [...] Upon the outbreak of the First World War, the issue fell out of public prominence, and it was not until 1930 that Alberta would achieve this long-time objective.|$|R
5000|$|David McMullen's {{concept of}} {{decentralized}} non-market socialism advocates social {{ownership of the}} means of production, believing it to be far more efficient than private ownership. In his proposal, property titles would be replaced by [...] "usership" [...] rights, and the exchange of capital goods would no longer be possible. Market exchange in capital goods would be replaced by internal <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources,</b> but an internal and decentralized price system would be fundamental to this systems' operation.|$|R

25|$|In {{terms of}} the theatre, some <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> was made from the subsidy of the {{national}} theatres to the support for theatre companies which did not necessarily have an institutional home. A significant investment was made in music education {{with the creation of}} 5 new music schools in the departements and the revamping of the Conservatoire National de la Musique at Lyon, while the range and capacity of performance facilities in Paris was considerably increased, with the Cite Musicale de la Villette and the Opera de la Bastille allowing for specialist performance {{in a way that was}} lacking in Paris previously, and a 2,000 seat concert hall called le Zenith, which was designed primarily for rock music concerts but adapted for all uses.|$|E
25|$|Jellicoe {{continued}} {{to take a}} pessimistic view, advising the War Policy Committee (a Cabinet Committee which discussed strategy in 1917) during planning meetings for the Third Ypres Offensive in June and July that nothing {{could be done to}} defeat the U-boats. However, removing Jellicoe in July, as Lloyd George wanted, would have been politically impossible given Conservative anger at the return of Churchill (still blamed for the Dardanelles) to office as Minister of Munitions. In August and September Lloyd George was preoccupied with Third Ypres and the possible <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> to Italy, whilst the new First Lord of the Admiralty, Sir Eric Campbell Geddes, was reforming the Naval Staff (including creating a post for Wemyss as Deputy First Sea Lord). Geddes and Lloyd George met with Balfour and Carson (both former First Lords of the Admiralty) on 26 October to discuss sacking Jellicoe after he had failed to act on “secret, but absolutely reliable” information about a German attack on a Norwegian convoy, but again nothing came of this as Lloyd George was soon preoccupied by the Battle of Caporetto and the setting up of the Supreme War Council. Geddes wanted to return to his previous job in charge of military transportation in France, and by December it was clear that Lloyd George would have to sack Jellicoe or lose Geddes.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time, at the war's end, the Soviet Union adopted a [...] "plunder policy" [...] of {{physically}} transporting and relocating east European industrial assets to the Soviet Union. Eastern Bloc states {{were required to}} provide coal, industrial equipment, technology, rolling stock and other resources to reconstruct the Soviet Union. Between 1945 and 1953, the Soviets received a net <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> {{from the rest of}} the Eastern Bloc under this policy of roughly $14 billion, an amount comparable to the net transfer from the United States to western Europe in the Marshall Plan.

2500|$|The legal {{definition}} and the economical definition of taxes differ in that economists do not regard many transfers to governments as taxes. For example, some transfers {{to the public}} sector are comparable to prices. Examples include tuition at public universities and fees for utilities provided by local governments. Governments also obtain resources by [...] "creating" [...] money and coins (for example, by printing bills and by minting coins), through voluntary gifts (for example, contributions to public universities and museums), by imposing penalties (such as traffic fines), by borrowing, and by confiscating wealth. From the view of economists, a tax is a non-penal, yet compulsory <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> from the private to the public sector levied on a basis of predetermined criteria and without reference to specific benefit received.|$|E

40|$|A {{sharp rise in}} real {{commodity}} prices has boosted Canada’s terms of trade and exchange rate {{over the past five}} years. These relative price movements, underpinned by a strong global demand for commodities, have generated substantial real income gains, reduced Canadian cost competitiveness, and changed relative factor prices in favour of capital, thereby stimulating final domestic demand, depressing real net exports, and inducing intersectoral <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources.</b> While the standard of living of Canadians has improved {{as a result of the}} terms-of-trade gains, the frictions generated in adjusting to the relative price shock have likely contribute...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} link between the excess value of a diversified firm and the value of its {{internal}} capital market. Subsidies to small financially constrained segments with good relative investment opportunities significantly increase excess value, while <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> from segments with good relative investment opportunities significantly decrease excess value. Of interest is that subsidies to small financially constrained segments with poor relative investment opportunities also significantly increase excess value.

40|$|This study {{recognizes that}} public safety organizations, {{including}} military units and fire services {{as well as}} the police, will normally be budget constrained.

The study draws on the ideas of variance analysis from accounting and peak load pricing and duality from economics to derive optimizing levels of activity for subunits within an organization in response to varying demands on the <b>resources</b> and performance <b>of</b> the organization as a whole. It also provides a critique of the standard data envelopment analysis aproach to activity analysis on the grounds not only that that approach is not cost related, but also that it does not provide for the endogenous <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> activities and <b>resources</b> between units. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} stylized model of {{economic}} growth with bubbles. In this model, changes in investor sentiment lead to the appearance and collapse of macroeconomic bubbles or pyramid schemes. We show how these bubbles mitigate the effects of financial frictions. During bubbly episodes, unproductive investors demand bubbles while productive investors supply them. These <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> improve the efficiency at which the economy operates, expanding consumption, the capital stock and output. When bubbly episodes end, these transfers stop and consumption, the capital stock and output contract. We characterize the stochastic equilibria of the model and argue that they provide a natural way of introducing bubble shocks into business cycle models. bubbles, dynamic inefficiency, economic growth, financial frictions, pyramid schemes...|$|R
