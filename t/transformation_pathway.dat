However, before reaching this stage of application, more work {{needs to be done to}} understand the complexity of the non-HPC systems. This vein of research could potentially lead to more neuropsychological assessments to evaluate their functioning, just as there are tests for HPC functioning.

In this study, five transformation products {{were found to}} be classified into three categories according to the contained characteristic functional groups: three (di-) sulfoxide products, one sulfone product and one di-ketone product. Products analyses showed that two kinds of reactions including oxidation of thioether and the cleavage of unsaturated C=C double bond occurred during transformation of cefazolin by Mn(VII). Subsequently, the plausible <b>transformation</b> <b>pathways</b> under different pH conditions were proposed based on the identified products and chemical reaction principles. More importantly, the simulation with real surface water matrix indicated that the proposed <b>transformation</b> <b>pathways</b> of cefazolin could be replayed in real water treatment practices.

It was shown to produce consistent climate projections when concentration-driven (AR 5 WG 1 Ch. 12). However, its carbon-cycle - and therefore its ability to be emission-driven - was shown to be slightly biased (AR 5 WG 1 Ch. 6). A large fraction of non-CO 2 forcings - as expected in low-carbon scenarios- also makes its projections span a narrower range than that of complex models (AR 5 WG 1 Ch. 12).

40|$|To extend {{rational}} materials {{design and}} discovery {{into the space}} of metastable polymorphs, rapid and reliable assessment of their lifetimes is essential. Motivated by the early work of Buerger (1951), here we investigate the routes to predict kinetics of polymorphic transformations using solely crystallographic arguments. As part of this investigation we developed a general algorithm to map crystal structures onto each other and construct <b>transformation</b> <b>pathways</b> between them. The developed algorithm reproduces reliably known <b>transformation</b> <b>pathways</b> and reveals the critical role that the dissociation of chemical bonds along the pathway plays in choosing the best (low-energy barrier) mapping. By utilizing our structure-mapping algorithm {{we were able to}} quantitatively demonstrate the intuitive expectation that the minimal dissociation of chemical bonds along the pathway, or in ionic systems, the condition of coordination of atoms along the pathway not decreasing below the coordination in the end compounds, represents the requirement for fast transformation kinetics. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the structure-mapping algorithm in combination with the coordination analysis in studying transformations between polymorphs for which a detailed atomic-level picture is presently elusive...|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} a novel statistical approach for identifying sequenced chemical transformation pathways {{in combination with}} reaction kinetics models. The proposed method relies on sound uncertainty propagation by considering parameter ranges and associated probability distribution obtained at any given <b>transformation</b> <b>pathway</b> levels as priors for parameter estimation at any subsequent transformation levels. The method was applied to calibrate a model predicting the transformation in untreated wastewater of six biomarkers, excreted following human metabolism of heroin and codeine. The method developed was compared to parameter estimation methods commonly encountered in literature (i. e., estimation of all parameters {{at the same time}} and parameter estimation with fix values for upstream parameters) by assessing the model prediction accuracy, parameter identifiability and uncertainty analysis. Results obtained suggest that the method developed has the potential to outperform conventional approaches in terms of prediction accuracy, <b>transformation</b> <b>pathway</b> identification and parameter identifiability. This method can be used in conjunction with optimal experimental designs to effectively identify model structures and parameters. This method can also offer a platform to promote a closer interaction between analytical chemists and modellers to identify models for biochemical transformation pathways, being a prominent example for the emerging field of wastewater-based epidemiology...|$|E

40|$|Dual isotope slopes are {{increasingly}} {{used to identify}} <b>transformation</b> <b>pathways</b> of contaminants. We investigated if reductive dechlorination of tetrachloroethene (PCE) by consortia containing bacteria with different reductive dehalogenases (rdh A) genes can lead to variable dual C−Cl isotope slopes and if different slopes also occur in the field. Two bacterial enrichments harboring Sulfurospirillum spp. but different rdh A genes yielded two distinct δ 13 C to δ 37 Cl slopes of 2. 7 ± 0. 3 and 0. 7 ± 0. 2 despite a high similarity in gene sequences. This suggests that PCE reductive dechlorination could be catalyzed according to at least two distinct reaction mechanisms or that rate-limiting steps might vary. At two field sites, two distinct dual isotope slopes of 0. 7 ± 0. 3 and 3. 5 ± 1. 6 were obtained, each of which fits one of the laboratory slopes {{within the range of}} uncertainty. This study hence provides additional insight into multiple reaction mechanisms underlying PCE reductive dechlorination.

40|$|Background {{and aims}} Amino acid {{turnover}} in soil {{is an important}} element of terrestrial carbon and nitrogen cycles. This study accounts for their driver- the micro-bial metabolism- by tracing them via the unique isoto-pic approach of position-specific labeling. Methods Three 14 C isotopomers of alanine at five concentration levels combined with selective steriliza-tion were used to distinguish sorption mechanisms, exoenzymatic and microbial utilization of amino acids in soil. Results Sorption and microbial uptake occurred imme-diately. Unspecific microbial uptake followed a linear kinetic, whereas energy-dependent uptake followed Michaelis-Menten. Less than 6 % of the initially added alanine was sorbed to soil, but after microbial transfor-mation products were bound to the soil matrix at higher proportions (5 – 25 %). The carboxyl group (C- 1) was rapidly oxidized by microorganisms, whereas C- 2 and C- 3 positions were preferentially incorporated into mi-crobial biomass. Dependency of C metabolization on amino acid concentration reflected individual alanine <b>transformation</b> <b>pathways</b> for starvation, maintenance and growth conditions. Conclusions This study demonstrates that position-specific labeling determines the mechanisms and rates of C cycling from individual functional groups. This approach reflected underlying metabolic pathways and revealed the formation of new organic matter. We therefore conclude that position-specific labeling is a unique tool for detailed insights into submolecular <b>transformation</b> <b>pathways</b> and their regulation factors...|$|R
