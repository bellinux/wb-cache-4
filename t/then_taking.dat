5|$|After {{the fall}} of Messolonghi, Western Europe decided to {{intervene}} in favour of revolutionary Greece. Their attitude toward the Ottoman Empire's Egyptian ally, Ibrahim Pasha, was especially critical; their primary objective was to elicit the evacuation of the occupied regions, the Peloponnese in particular. The intervention began when a Franco-Russo-British fleet {{was sent to the}} region, winning the Battle of Navarino in October 1827. In August 1828, a French expeditionary corps disembarked at Koroni in the southern Peloponnese. The soldiers were stationed on the peninsula until the evacuation of Egyptian troops in October, <b>then</b> <b>taking</b> control of the principal strongholds still held by Turkish troops. Although the bulk of the troops returned to France from the end of 1828, there was a French presence in the area until 1833.|$|E
5|$|Nativist {{sentiment}} {{increased in}} St. Louis {{during the late}} 1840s, leading to mob attacks and riots in 1844, 1849, and 1852. The 1844 riots derived from popular outrage and resentment toward human dissection, which was <b>then</b> <b>taking</b> place at the Saint Louis University Medical College. The discovery of human remains prompted rumors of grave robbing, and a mob of more than 3,000 residents attacked the medical college, destroying most of its interior facilities. The worst nativist riot in St. Louis took place in 1854. The local militia was used to end the fighting. 10 people were killed, 33 wounded, and 93 buildings were damaged. Regulations on elections prevented fighting in future elections in 1856 and 1858.|$|E

5|$|Romney soon {{switched}} Bain Capital's {{focus from}} startups {{to the relatively}} new business of leveraged buyouts: buying existing companies with money mostly borrowed from banking institutions using the newly bought companies' assets as collateral, <b>then</b> <b>taking</b> steps to improve the companies' value, and finally selling those companies once their value peaked, usually within a few years. Bain Capital lost money in many of its early leveraged buyouts, but then found deals that made large returns. The firm invested in or acquired Accuride Corporation, Brookstone, Domino's Pizza, Sealy Corporation, Sports Authority, and Artisan Entertainment, {{as well as some}} lesser-known companies in the industrial and medical sectors. Much of the firm's profit was earned from {{a relatively small number of}} deals; Bain Capital's overall success-to-failure ratio was about even.|$|E

5|$|Crazy Taxi and its sequels are score attack {{games that}} all employ the same {{fundamental}} rules and mechanics. The player controls {{one of several}} taxi drivers in a fictional city, looking for fares and <b>then</b> <b>taking</b> them to their destination in the fastest time possible. The player must perform this while time still remains on an overall gameplay clock. Passengers looking for rides are indicated by an overhead marker that is colored to represent the distance to their intended destination. The color marker ranges from red indicating short trips, to yellow for intermediate distances, and to green indicating long ones. When a passenger is picked up, the player is awarded additional time on the countdown time. Furthermore, a second countdown timer is started, representing how quickly the passenger needs to be at their destination. While a passenger is in the taxi, a large green arrow is shown on the player's HUD that points {{in the general direction}} of the passenger's destination to help guide the player through the map.|$|E

5|$|A {{period of}} {{reorganisation}} and training followed as the battalion {{was prepared for}} the rigours of jungle warfare. The battalion concentrated at the Nagambie Road Camp in central Victoria initially, but in late September moved to Greta in New South Wales. In October, {{after a period of}} intense training, the 2/6th was moved to Brisbane from where, on 13 October 1942, they embarked on the Dutch merchant ship Bontekoe, bound for Milne Bay for the first of their two campaigns there against the Japanese. After arriving at Milne Bay, where the 17th Brigade was held in reserve, on 19 October they remained there until January 1943, when the battalion embarked upon the MV Pulganbar and several smaller coastal vessels and moved to Port Moresby. From Moresby, they were airlifted to Wau on 14 January. During the battalion's time around Milne Bay, they had suffered heavily from malaria and over 300 men were in hospital at the time the battalion deployed to Wau; consequently, it was severely understrength by the time it went into battle. Nevertheless, throughout late January 1943, the battalion was heavily involved in the Battle of Wau, then afterwards took part in the advance on Salamaua, during which it fought several key actions, including the fighting around Lababia Ridge in late June, before supporting the landing at Nassau Bay and the Battle of Mubo in July and <b>then</b> <b>taking</b> part in the fighting around Mount Tambu and Komiatum Ridge in August. During the fighting the battalion sustained casualties of 59 dead and 133 wounded.|$|E
