Police deployed there again in 1906 for nine months during a dispute between the company, now called the Alberta Railway and Irrigation Company, and the workforce over union recognition, pay and working conditions. A team of 82 regular police were reinforced by 11 special constables recruited from within the company, with an undercover constable deployed to infiltrate the strike and send back intelligence.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> management on <b>the</b> value-relevance <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> {{and book}} value. Two different sources <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> management are investigated: short-term discretionary accruals and long-term discretionary accruals. A contribution {{of this paper}} is the development of models to estimate short-term and long-term discretionary accruals. <b>The</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> management on <b>the</b> relative value-relevance <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> and book value depends on <b>the</b> source <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> management. When examined independently, earnings management via either short-term or long-term discretionary accruals reduces <b>the</b> valuerelevance <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> but has no impact on the value relevance of book value. Examination of both measures simultaneously reveals the differential impact of short-term versus long-term discretionary accruals. Earnings management via short-term discretionary accruals has no impact, whereas earnings management via long-term discretionary accruals reduces <b>the</b> valuerelevance <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> and increases <b>the</b> value-relevance of book value. This supports <b>the</b> conclusion that <b>earnings</b> management via long-term discretionary accruals has a greater impact on <b>the</b> value-relevance <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> and book value than earnings management via short-term discretionary accruals. ...|$|R
