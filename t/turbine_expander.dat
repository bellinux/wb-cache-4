With reaction enthalpies {{as high as}} - 1 793 kJ/mol naphthalene reacted, there are many opportunities for energy recovery making these systems attractive for process integration research. The prodn. of PA from naphthalene is used to investigate two energy recovery schemes. The first is a Rankine cycle that uses steam, raised during the cooling of the reactor, to produce power. The second also includes a <b>turbine</b> <b>expander</b> at the reactor exit. It expands hot reactor product gases to deliver addnl. power and reduces {{the pressure of the}} reactor product before it enters the sepn. section. Simulation results showed that, under certain operating conditions, the steam cycle alone could not supply the feed compression power requirement.

40|$|Many {{reactions}} {{carried out}} in the chemical industry are exothermic. The heat liberated by the reaction is often transferred to another medium such as steam by heat exchange. This heat can then be used elsewhere or be used to generate power via a steam cycle. In this work the focus is on another method of reaction heat recovery. When an exothermic reaction is conducted at elevated pressures, a <b>turbine</b> <b>expander</b> can be placed directly behind the reactor. The hot, high-pressure product gas from the reactor can then be expanded in the turbine. During the expansion process the physical energy of the product gas is converted to kinetic energy (or electricity if the turbine is connected to a generator). Three chemical processes were studied to determine the feasibility of turbine integration into the processes. They are ethylene oxide production, phthalic anhydride production and the hydrodealkylation of alkylaromatic compounds. The chosen processes differ in terms of reactor operation, reactant conversion as well as {{the presence or absence of}} recycle loops. Simulation models were developed for the mentioned processes with the process simulator Aspen Plus®. Results from the simulations show that, without the turbine, the processes require power from external sources. They can however operate independently from external power sources when a turbine is present. Excess power can be exported or used for electricity generation. It is therefore feasible• to incorporate turbine expansion units in all the processes considered. The operating conditions of some unit operations have to be changed to accommodate the <b>turbine</b> <b>expander.</b> With the additional product namely power, a re-evaluation of all the operating conditions and tradeoffs in the process is necessary. Further investigation into the impact of turbine integration on the optimal operating conditions of the process is therefore recommended. Traditional definitions used to evaluate the performance of a process generating or consuming power, were found to be inadequate for use in processes where power and chemicals are produced together. New performance parameters are required for the evaluation of processes where power and chemicals are produced simultaneously. An exergy analysis was performed for one of the cases. This analysis method provides insight as to where thermodynamic losses occur in a process. The exergy analysis was useful to quantify the losses occurring in an isenthalpic expansion valve, and the savings obtained by replacing such a valve with an expansion turbine.

30|$|The {{small-scale}} CAES has {{a relatively}} lower power output, {{leading to a}} lower air flow. Therefore, the impeller is relatively smaller and the rotation rate of the turbine is higher. Meanwhile, the expansion of turbine will be greater due to the demand of increasing the energy storage capacity per gas storage volume unit, causing {{the decline in the}} specific enthalpy-drop ratio of the air. In this case, the linear velocity of wheel circumference of the impeller rises, indicating the increase in the rotation rate of the turbine. Based on the two factors mentioned above, the rotation rate of the turbine in kilowatt CAES can reach above the level of tens of thousands. Therefore, the turbine generation subsystem of traditional <b>turbine</b> <b>expander</b> needs to be equipped with speed reducers [48, 49]. For instance, TICC- 500 utilizes a speed reducer with a 20 : 1 ratio [12]. High-speed gear reducer needs to be designed due to the huge difference in rotation rate between turbines and conventional synchronous generators. However, it has limitations in stability, service life and loss in the process of high-speed rotation, vibration and noise. Besides, it also needs to be configured with complex oil supply system [50, 51, 52].|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe continual {{increases}} in global energy demand and {{greenhouse gas emissions}} call {{for more and more}} utilisation of sustainable energy sources, such as solar energy, biomass energy, and waste heat. Solar thermal energy, the heat of biomass combustion and waste heat may be used to drive a combined heat and power (CHP) system. In recent years, several micro-CHP systems with organic Rankine cycle (ORC) suitable for domestic applications (1 - 10 kW) driven by solar thermal, biomass-fired boilers and waste heat resources have been investigated. These ORC-based micro-CHP systems have lower operation pressures and temperatures compared to conventional steam-Rankine cycle CHP systems and hence safer for household applications. However, the lack of commercially available expanders applicable to ORC-based micro-CHP systems has hindered the development of these novel CHP systems. This paper summarizes the findings of the market research for the expanders and discusses the selection and choices of the expanders for ORC-based micro-CHP systems.

As the temperature difference reduces, the maximum achievable efficiency must also reduce as demonstrated by classical thermodynamics. Thus, as the temperature difference drops, {{it is a matter of}} improving component efficiencies while reducing costs to make such systems viable. Lower temperature systems frequently use an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) heat engine. As the temperatures drop, the key parameters in the design of such systems become cost and efficiency. Of prime importance is the cost of the expander, efficiency of the heat exchangers, and the precision of the control system.

40|$|The {{chemical}} conversion in a methanol reactor is restricted by equilibrium, therefore the synthesis loop is operated at high pressure and unconverted gas is recycled.

A <b>turbine</b> <b>expander</b> and compressor pair {{is placed in the}} recycle stream and utilises the reactor heat at the maximum possible temperature in a process gas power cycle. In conventional systems the reaction heat is often transferred to generate steam to drive steam turbines, but the heat is reduced in quality due to the temperature-driving forces in the heat exchange equipment. Simulation models of the new flow sheet and a conventional flow sheet are created to compare the systems based on energy consumed per kg methanol produced. In the conventional flow sheet the reaction heat is used to generate steam for use in steam turbines. In the new flow sheet a portion of the reaction heat is still transferred to a steam cycle to limit the temperature in the reactor. The remaining heat is used to drive the process gas cycle.

Such a loop represents a typical reactor-separator system with a recycle stream and cold sepn. of the product from the recycle loop.

Two new combined power and chems. prodn. flow sheets are developed for the process. The flow sheets are simulated using the flow sheet simulator AspenPlus (licensed by Aspen Technol., Inc.) and compared to a simulated conventional ammonia synthesis loop. The comparison is based on energy as well as exergy anal.

In terms of the min. work requirement per kg of product a 75 % improvement over the conventional process could be obtained. The work penalty due to refrigeration needed for sepn. was also accounted for.

40|$|When humans go to Mars, {{we should}} take {{vehicles}} such as “rovers ” or helicopters, powered by compact nuclear fission reactor engines. This would provide portable “muscle power ” for digging, e. g., in search of life or water, and for long distance mobility to explore the entire planet without having to periodically return to a fixed ground base. Reactor power would provide continuous life support, including heat to survive the frigid Martian nights. Technical requirements for Martian mobile nuclear fission engines are discussed. The fundamental design issue is minimizing mass while providing adequate power conversion and radiation shielding. Nuclear fission reactors have supplied more than 20 % of earth’s electricity {{over the last several}} years, using either natural uranium fuel or uranium slightly enriched in the fissionable isotope U 235. However, a compact reactor must use either Highly Enriched Uranium (HEU) or plutonium fuel in its core. A plutonium core would be smaller than a HEU core but would suffer from a smaller experience base. Compact nuclear fission reactors using HEU are ubiquitous in the submarines of several nations ’ navies and are even used to power some aircraft carriers. Substantial design, development and testing activity was pursued in the 1950 s and 1960 s to adapt mobile nuclear fission reactors to propel jet aircraft and nuclear thermal rockets. The aircraft and rocket applications are not in use today, in part due to radiological safety issues that could accompany a crash in a populated region. In contrast to plutonium, HEU fuel carries the safety advantage of having negligible radioactivity before it is inserted into a reactor and fissioned. If a Mars mission with an unoperated HEU-fueled reactor as cargo were to crash while being launched from earth, radiological safety issues would be insignificant.

In {{the case of the}} twin-screw machine, the methods used to match the operation of the expander to the requirements of the cycle are described.

40|$|In {{the near}} future, {{the nation will}} {{continue}} to rely on fossil fuels for electricity, transportation, and chemicals. It is necessary to improve both the process efficiency and environmental impact of fossil fuel utilization including greenhouse gas management. GE Global Research (GEGR) investigated an innovative fuel-flexible Unmixed Fuel Processor (UFP) technology with potential to produce H{sub 2 }, power, and sequestration-ready CO{sub 2 } from coal and other solid fuels. The UFP technology offers the long-term potential for reduced cost, increased process efficiency relative to conventional gasification and combustion systems, and near-zero pollutant emissions. GE was awarded a contract from U. S. DOE NETL to investigate and develop the UFP technology. Work started on the Phase I program in October 2000 and on the Phase II effort in April 2005. In the UFP technology, coal, water and air are simultaneously converted into (1) hydrogen rich stream that can be utilized in fuel cells or turbines, (2) CO{sub 2 } rich stream for sequestration, and (3) high temperature/pressure vitiated air stream to produce electricity in a gas <b>turbine</b> <b>expander.</b> The process produces near-zero emissions with an estimated efficiency higher than Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) process with conventional CO{sub 2 } separation. The Phase I R&D program established the chemical feasibility of the major reactions of the integrated UFP technology through lab-, bench- and pilot-scale testing. A risk analysis session was carried {{out at the end}} of Phase I effort to identify the major risks in the UFP technology and a plan was developed to mitigate these risks in the Phase II of the program. The Phase II effort focused on three high-risk areas: economics, lifetime of solids used in the UFP process, and product gas quality for turbines (or the impact of impurities in the coal on the overall system). The economic analysis included estimating the capital cost as well as the costs of hydrogen and electricity for a full-scale UFP plant. These costs were benchmarked with IGCC polygen plants with similar level of CO{sub 2 } capture. Based on the promising economic analysis comparison results (performed with the help from Worley Parsons), GE recommended a 'Go' decision in April 2006 to continue the experimental investigation of the UFP technology to address the remaining risks i. e. solids lifetime and the impact of impurities in the coal on overall system. Solids attrition and lifetime risk was addressed via bench-scale experiments that monitor solids performance over time and by assessing materials interactions at operating conditions. The product gas under the third reactor (high-temperature vitiated air) operating conditions was evaluated to assess the concentration of particulates, pollutants and other impurities relative to the specifications required for gas turbine feed streams. During this investigation, agglomeration of solids used in the UFP process was identified as a serious risk that impacts the lifetime of the solids and in turn feasibility of the UFP technology. The main causes of the solids agglomeration were the combination of oxygen transfer material (OTM) reduction at temperatures {approx} 1000 C and interaction between OTM and CO{sub 2 } absorbing material (CAM) at high operating temperatures (> 1200 C). At the end of phase II, in March 2008, GEGR recommended a 'No-go' decision for taking the UFP technology to the next level of development, i. e. development of a 3 - 5 MW prototype system, at this time. GEGR further recommended focused materials development research programs on improving the performance and lifetime of solids materials used in UFP or chemical looping technologies. The scale-up activities would be recommended only after mitigating the risks involved with the agglomeration and overall lifetime of the solids. This is the final report for the phase II of the DOE-funded Vision 21 program entitled 'Fuel-Flexible Gasification-Combustion Technology for Production of H{sub 2 } and Sequestration-Ready CO{sub 2 }' (DOE Award No. DE-FC 26 - 00 NT 40974).

40|$|The {{choice of}} energy {{recovery}} technology in process industries {{is still a}} matter of debate despite the two state-of-art methods, namely <b>turbine</b> <b>expanders</b> and variable speed pumps, available in the market. The paper enables a theoretical model to define different performances indices for both techniques. A heat exchanger problem operating with incompressible fluids is selected as the general process application and simplified to single and multiple processes for clearer interpretation. The investigation finds the need for the two expanders, one across the throttle (traditional) and the other across the combined throttle-process unit (novel) for enhanced recovery potential. Variable speed pumps would be better than twin expanders in single processes, but not in multiple processes that form backbone of process industries. The decisive outcome particularly for multiple process application revealed the need to innovate by combining both the technologies where the throttle expander for each elemental process is hybridized with the variable speed feed pump. The study concludes that the use of two recovery technologies would be inevitable in industrial processes and proposes a series of recommendations for its realization, which include better knowledge of load duration of processes, using throttle-expander units, carrying out cost-benefit analysis and developing favorable policies.

50|$|The working {{principle}} of the organic Rankine cycle {{is the same as}} that of the Rankine cycle: the working fluid is pumped to a boiler where it is evaporated, passed through an expansion device (<b>turbine</b> or other <b>expander),</b> and then through a condenser heat exchanger where it is finally re-condensed.|$|R
40|$|The Ukraine Steam Partnership {{program is}} {{designed}} to implement energy efficiency improvements in industrial steam systems. These improvements are to be made by the private plants and local government departments responsible for generation and delivery of energy to end-users. One of the activities planned under this program was to provide a two-day training workshop on industrial steam systems focusing on energy efficiency issues related to the generation, distribution, and consumption of steam. The workshop was geared towards plant managers, who are not only technically oriented, but are also key decision makers in their respective companies. The Agency for Rational Energy Use and Ecology (ARENA-ECO), a non-governmental, not-for-profit organization founded to promote energy efficiency and environmental protection in Ukraine, in conjunction with the Alliance staff in Kiev sent out invitations to potential participants in all the regions of Ukraine. The purpose of this report is the describe the proceedings from the workshop and provide recommendations from the workshop's roundtable discussion. The workshop was broken down into two main areas: (1) Energy efficient boiler house steam generation; and Energy efficient steam distribution and consumption. The workshop also covered the following topics: (1) Ukrainian boilers; (2) Water treatment systems; (3) A profile of UKRESCO (Ukrainian Energy Services Company); (4) <b>Turbine</b> <b>expanders</b> and electricity generation; (5) Enterprise energy audit basics; and (6) Experience of steam use in Donetsk oblast...|$|R
40|$|GE Global Research is {{developing}} an innovative energy-based technology for coal combustion with high efficiency and near-zero pollution. This Unmixed Combustion of coal (UMC-Coal) technology simultaneously converts coal, steam and air into two separate streams of high pressure CO{sub 2 }-rich gas for sequestration, and high-temperature, high-pressure vitiated air for producing electricity in gas <b>turbine</b> <b>expanders.</b> The UMC process utilizes an oxygen transfer material (OTM) and {{eliminates the need}} for an air separation unit (ASU) and a CO{sub 2 } separation unit as compared to conventional gasification based processes. This is the final report for the two-year DOE-funded program (DE-FC 26 - 03 NT 41842) on this technology that ended in September 30, 2005. The UMC technology development program encompassed lab- and pilot-scale studies to demonstrate the UMC concept. The chemical feasibility of the individual UMC steps was established via lab-scale testing. A pilot plant, designed in a related DOE funded program (DE-FC 26 - 00 FT 40974), was reconstructed and operated to demonstrate the chemistry of UMC process in a pilot-scale system. The risks associated with this promising technology including cost, lifetime and durability OTM and the impact of contaminants on turbine performance are currently being addressed in detail in a related ongoing DOE funded program (DE-FC 26 - 00 FT 40974, Phase II). Results obtained to date suggest that this technology has the potential to economically meet future efficiency and environmental performance goals...|$|R
