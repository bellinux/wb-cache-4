Four parties which had planned to form a coalition with Yudhoyono's Democratic Party (PAN, PPP, the National Awakening Party (PKB), and the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS)) had expected <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> presidential nominee would come from one of their parties. Although they threatened to form their own coalition with Gerindra and present their own candidate, PKB became the first party in the coalition to support Yudhoyono's decision. The remaining three parties eventually agreed to support the Yudhoyono–Boediono ticket and attended the nomination ceremony in Bandung on 15 May.|$|E
25|$|Section 1 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment states <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> {{president}} becomes president {{upon the}} removal from office, death, or {{resignation of the}} preceding president. The Presidential Succession Act of 1947 provides that if the offices of President and Vice President are each either vacant or are held by a disabled person, the next officer in the presidential line of succession, the Speaker of the House, becomes acting president. The line then extends to the President pro tempore of the Senate, followed by {{every member of the}} Cabinet. A person must fulfill all eligibility requirements of the office of President to be eligible to become acting president; ineligible individuals are skipped.|$|E

Julian Goodman, president of NBC, stated that Agnew had made an [...] "appeal to prejudice... it is regrettable <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> President of the United States should deny to TV freedom of the press". Frank Stanton, head of CBS, accused Agnew of trying to intimidate the news media, and his news anchor, Walter Cronkite, agreed. The speech was praised by conservatives from both parties, and gave Agnew a following among the right. Agnew deemed the Des Moines speech one of his finest moments.|$|E

500|$|To become House Speaker, Ford {{worked to}} help Republicans {{across the country}} get a {{majority}} in the chamber, often traveling on the rubber chicken circuit. After a decade of failing to do so, he promised his wife that he would try again in 1974 then retire in 1976. On October 10, 1973, Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned and then pleaded no contest to criminal charges of tax evasion and money laundering, part of a negotiated resolution to a scheme in which he accepted $29,500 in bribes while governor of Maryland. According to The New York Times, Nixon [...] "sought advice from senior Congressional leaders about a replacement. The advice was unanimous. 'We gave Nixon no choice but Ford,' House Speaker Carl Albert recalled later". Ford agreed to the nomination, telling his wife <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> Presidency would be [...] "a nice conclusion" [...] to his career.|$|E

Should the Congress resolve the issue in favor of the President, or make no decision within the 21 days allotted, then the President would [...] "resume" [...] discharging the powers and duties of his office.

500|$|In 1841, President William Henry Harrison {{became the}} first U.S. President to die in office. Representative John Williams had {{previously}} suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> President should become Acting President upon {{the death of the}} President. John Tyler asserted that he had succeeded to the presidency, as opposed to only obtaining its powers and duties. He also declined to acknowledge documents referring to him as [...] "Acting President". Although he felt his vice presidential oath negated the need for the presidential oath, Tyler was persuaded that being formally sworn-in would clear up any doubts about his right to the office. Having done so, he then moved into the White House and assumed full presidential powers. Tyler's claim was not formally challenged, and both houses of Congress adopted a resolution confirming that Tyler was the tenth President of the United States, without any qualifiers. The precedent of full succession was thus established. This became known as the [...] "Tyler Precedent".|$|E
500|$|As the {{campaign}} got underway, Humphrey tried to position {{himself as the}} conservative Democrat in the race, hoping to appeal to Southern delegates. Republicans, feeling <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> President may be the nominee, began to attack him, describing his positions as socialistic and reminding voters that Southern Democrats once considered him a [...] "wild-eyed liberal." [...] Democrats conceded this point but argued that compared to McCarthy and Kennedy, Humphrey was conservative. He immediately made {{an impact on the}} polls, rocketing to number one among Democrats in the beginning of May with 38%, ahead of both McCarthy and Kennedy. An internal struggle within {{the campaign}} between the new politics of Mondale and Harris, and the old politics of Connell, Kampelman and Maguire, sometimes disrupted the organization of staffers in different states. Humphrey ordered Connell to not circumvent Mondale and Harris on campaign decisions, but the clashing continued throughout the campaign. The older faction referred to Mondale and Harris as [...] "boy scouts".|$|E
500|$|Investigative {{reporters and}} Democratic {{operatives}} had pursued rumors that Agnew had been corrupt {{during his years}} as a Maryland official, but they {{had not been able to}} substantiate them. In February 1973, Agnew heard of the investigation and had Attorney General Richard Kleindienst contact Beall. The vice president's personal attorney, George White, visited Beall, who stated that Agnew was not under investigation, and that prosecutors would do their best to protect Agnew's name. In June, Matz's attorney disclosed to Beall that his client could show that Agnew not only had been corrupt, but that payments to him had continued into his vice presidency. These later payments would not be barred by the statute of limitations; Agnew could be prosecuted. On July 3, Beall informed the new Attorney General, Elliot Richardson, and at the end of the month Nixon, through his chief of staff, Alexander Haig, was informed. Agnew had already met with both Nixon and Haig to assert his innocence. On August 1, Beall sent a letter to Agnew's attorney, formally advising <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> president was under investigation for tax fraud and corruption. Matz was prepared to testify that he had met with Agnew at the White House and given him $10,000 in cash. Another witness, Jerome B. Wolff, head of Maryland's road commission, had extensive documentation that detailed, as Beall put it, [...] "every corrupt payment he participated in with then-Governor Agnew".|$|E

500|$|Fillmore {{had spent}} the four months between the {{election}} and swearing-in being feted by the New York Whigs and winding up affairs in the comptroller's office. Taylor had written promising influence in the new administration, but the president-elect mistakenly thought <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> president was a cabinet member, which was not true in the 19th century. Fillmore, Seward and Weed had met and come to general agreement on how to divide federal jobs in New York. Seward, once he went to Washington, made friendly contact with Taylor's cabinet nominees, advisers, and the general's brother, and an alliance between the incoming administration and the Weed machine was soon under way behind Fillmore's back. [...] In exchange for support, Seward and Weed were allowed to designate who would fill federal jobs in New York, with Fillmore given far less than had been agreed. When Fillmore, after the inauguration, discovered this, he went to Taylor, but the only result was that the warfare against Fillmore's influence became open. Fillmore supporters like Collier, who had nominated him at the convention, were passed over for candidates backed by Weed, who was triumphant even in Buffalo. This greatly increased the influence of Weed in New York politics, and diminished Fillmore's. According to Rayback, [...] "by mid-1849, Fillmore's situation had become desperate." [...] Despite his lack of influence, he was pestered by office seekers and those seeking to lease or sell a house to him, as there was then no official residence for the vice president. [...] He enjoyed one aspect of his office, due to his lifelong love of learning: he became {{deeply involved in the}} administration of the Smithsonian Institution as a member ex officio of its Board of Regents.|$|E
