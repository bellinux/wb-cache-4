40|$|In the Internet, Autonomous Systems (ASes) {{exchange}} traffic through interconnected links. As {{traffic demand}} increases, more traffic becomes concentrated on such links. The traffic concentrations depend {{heavily on the}} global structure of the Internet topology. Therefore, a topological evolution considering the global structure is necessary to continually accommodate future traffic amount. In this paper, we first develop a method to identify the hierarchical nature of traffic aggregation on the Internet topology and use this method to discuss the long-term changes in traffic flow. Our basic approach is to extract the “flow hierarchy,” which is a hierarchical structure associated with traffic aggregation. Our {{results show that the}} current connection policy will lead to a severe <b>traffic</b> <b>concentration</b> in the future. We then examine a new evolution process that attempts to reduce this <b>traffic</b> <b>concentration.</b> Our proposed evolution process increases the number of links in the deeper level in the hierarchy, thus relaxing the <b>traffic</b> <b>concentration.</b> We apply our evolution process to the Internet topology in 2000 and evolve this scenario over 13 years.

40|$|The {{classical}} derivation of {{a traffic}} stream model (e. g. speed/concentration relation) from the equilibrium solutions of the Prigogine-Herman kinetic equation invokes the nontrivial {{assumption that the}} underlying distribution of desired speeds is nonzero for vanishingly small speeds. In this paper we investigate the situation when this assumption does not hold. It is found that the Prigogine-Herman kinetic equation has a one-parameter family of equilibrium solutions, and hence an associated traffic stream model, only for <b>traffic</b> <b>concentrations</b> below some critical value; at higher concentrations there is a two-parameter family of solutions, and hence a continuum of mean velocities for each concentration. This result holds for both constant values of the passing probability and the relaxation time, and for values that depend on concentration in the manner assumed by Prigogine and Herman. It is hypothesized that this result reflects the well-known tendency toward substantial scatter in observational data of traffic flow at high concentrations. ...|$|R

40|$|With {{supplementary}} materialInternational audienceMethods for simulating {{air quality}} due to vehicles {{and the associated}} effects on stormwater runoff quality in an urban environment and their coupling are examined. To achieve this aim, the models (traffic, emission, atmospheric dispersion, and stormwater) must be carefully selected according to the special requirements {{and the level of}} details needed for the integrated system. The present study focuses on the interface between the air quality and stormwater models. The development of this interface raises questions concerning the processes treated to represent mass transfer between the atmosphere and stormwater. Moreover, other pollutant sources are added to road pollutants in an urban context: the evaluation of this new modelling chain with observations needs to distinguish between pollutants linked to traffic emissions and other pollutants. To assess the contamination of water runoff induced by <b>traffic,</b> <b>concentrations</b> of cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn) in the Grigny catchment in France were simulated using typical pollutant deposition fluxes measured at roadside. The highest simulated concentrations of Cd, Pb, and Zn at the outlet were 2. 12, 284. 61, and 1757 µg L- 1 respectively.

The two main challenges in modelling are: capturing the effect of varying size of vehicles, and the lack in lane discipline, both of which together lead to the „capacity filling‟ behavior of vehicles. The same section length of the road can be occupied by different types of vehicles at the same time, and the conventional measure of <b>traffic</b> <b>concentration,</b> density (vehicles per lane per unit length), is not a good measure for heterogeneous traffic modelling.

Bus capacity is a complex topic: it deals with the movement of both people and vehicles, depends {{on the size of the}} buses used and how often they operate, and reflects the interaction between passenger <b>traffic</b> <b>concentrations</b> and vehicle flow. It also depends on the operating policy of the service provider, which normally specifies service frequencies and allowable passenger loadings. Ultimately, the capacities of bus routes, bus lanes, and bus terminals, in terms of persons carried, are generally limited by the ability of stops or loading areas to pick up and discharge passengers, the number of vehicles operated, and the distribution of boardings and alightings along a route. In the theoretical part methods for determining bus capacities and bus speed for various traffic situations and operating types along the bus routs are taken from Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual-, 2 nd Edition. In the practical part analyses of bus public transport on studying area Slovenija avto-Kolizej in Ljubljana are shown, according to different conditions of bus operating based on Highway Capacity Manual 2000 and comparisons between them.
