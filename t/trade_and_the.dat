The campaign itself proved to be the beginning of movements for reform and women's emancipation.|$|E

Eadbald's granddaughter, Eorcengota, became a nun at Faremoutiers, and his great-granddaughter, Mildrith, was a nun at Chelles. When Edwin {{was killed in}} about 632, Æthelburg, escorted by Paulinus, fled by sea to Eadbald's court in Kent, but in a further sign of her family's ties across the channel she sent her {{children}} {{to the court of}} King Dagobert I of the Franks, to keep them safe from the intrigues of Eadbald and Oswald of Northumbria.|$|E
5|$|Decline {{in market}} demand {{combined}} with movement restrictions {{imposed by the}} Israeli military {{have led to a}} deterioration of the local economy, particularly in the <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> stone-cutting industries. In 2007, unemployment reached 30%. Consequently, many unemployed persons began looking into agriculture to earn income. The most cultivated crops are grains, especially barley, followed by lentils and chick peas. A sizable segment of the population raise livestock and 10% breed their own domestic animals. In total, there are 144 cows, 7,000 goats, 14,000 sheep, and 500 beehives. Much of the town's agricultural products are sold in Hebron.|$|E

5|$|During the 15th {{century the}} economy of Southampton {{improved}} {{as a result of}} the Italian wool <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> presence of many foreign merchants. The Medieval Merchant's House was acquired by a sequence of established Southampton merchants, but it remained intact as a detached dwelling, unlike many other properties in the neighbourhood that were combined to form the larger homes that became more fashionable in the late 15th century. In the middle of the 16th century, however, Southampton's economy collapsed once again as trade with Italy declined, taking with it the prosperity of FrenchStreet. A new parlour was installed in the house, and a floor was added halfway across the open hall to produce additional sleeping space.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 18th century, Lima was {{adversely}} affected by the Bourbon Reforms as it lost its monopoly on overseas <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> important mining region of Upper Peru was transferred to the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. This economic decline made the city's elite dependent on royal and ecclesiastical appointment and thus, reluctant to advocate independence. In the 1810s, the city became a Royalist stronghold during the South American wars of independence led by a strong viceroy, José Fernando de Abascal y Sousa.|$|E

5|$|Globalization at {{this time}} was {{hindered}} by war, diseases and population growth in certain areas. The Corn Laws were established to regulate imports and exports of grains in England, thus restricting <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> expansion of globalization. The Corn Crop Laws hindered the market economy and globalization based on tariffs and import restrictions. Eventually, the Ricardian theory of economics became prominent and allowed for improved trade regulations, specifically with Portugal.|$|E
5|$|Initially, some of {{the coal}} carried on the canal had been transported in boats owned by the canal company, but they had given up this {{practice}} in 1812. They resumed carrying coal in 1827, because they felt that coal stocks at Grantham were not adequate, but were accused of price-fixing. Although the penalty imposed by Lincoln Assizes was small, they ceased this <b>trade,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> coal merchants agreed to maintain stocks of 2,660 tons at Grantham. In 1833, J. Rofe and his son made {{a proposal for a}} canal to connect Grantham and Sleaford, but this was not pursued.|$|E
5|$|Japan's {{vulnerability}} to blockade was studied. Using information {{supplied by the}} Board of <b>Trade</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> naval attaché in Tokyo, the planners estimated that the British Empire accounted for around 27 per cent of Japan's imports. In most cases these imports could be replaced from sources in China and the United States. However, certain critical materials for which Japan relied heavily on imports were identified, including metals, machinery, chemicals, oil and rubber, {{and many of the}} best sources of these were under British control. Japan's access to neutral shipping could be restricted by refusing insurance to ships trading with Japan, and chartering ships to reduce the number available.|$|E

Gradually, it also lost its influence on the modalities of <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> price mechanisms, and its control over the outflow of precious metals and, according to some scholars, even over the minting of coins.|$|E

In 1547, Polish cochineal disappeared from the Poznań customs registry; a Volhynian clerk noted in 1566 that the dye no longer paid in Gdańsk. Perennial knawel plantations were replaced with cereal fields or pastures for raising cattle. Polish cochineal, which until then was mostly an export product, continued to be used locally by the peasants who collected it; it was employed not only for dyeing fabric {{but also as a}} vodka colorant, an ingredient in folk medicine, or even for decorative coloring of horses' tails.|$|E
