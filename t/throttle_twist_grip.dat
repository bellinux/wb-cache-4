2500|$|Despite {{having only}} a single rotor, the RE5's engine was {{mechanically}} complex and its numerous subsystems made for a heavy motorcycle. Rotary engines produce a lot of heat, and the RE5 had [...] water- and oil-cooling, and double-skinned exhaust pipes. [...] Ignition was CDI, with two sets of ignition points actuated via vacuum and rpm sensors, to light a solitary NGK spark plug. Three oil reservoirs served the sump, gearbox and total loss tank. Separate oil pumps fed (respectively) the main bearings and the inlet tracts (to lubricate tip seals). The throttle controlled both the primary carburetor butterfly and a second valve in the inlet manifold of the secondary throat (the [...] "port" [...] valve), as well as governing oil supply to the combustion chamber. Five cables in total were moved by the <b>throttle</b> <b>twist</b> <b>grip!</b> The carburetor {{was similar to that}} in a rotary-powered car, and was far more complicated than for normal motorcycles.|$|E
50|$|The Powerplus had <b>twist</b> <b>grips</b> on both handles; the {{throttle}} {{was controlled by}} the left <b>twist</b> <b>grip</b> while the right <b>twist</b> <b>grip</b> advanced or retarded the spark. Three controls were {{on the right side}} of the gas tank, a vertically-operated shifter, an exhaust valve lifter, and a hand clutch lever. The clutch lever was linked to the clutch pedal positioned on the left side of the bike.|$|R
50|$|Originally, {{machines}} {{had black}} handlebar rubbers but some later models were fitted with buff-coloured rubbers. The <b>twist</b> <b>grip</b> on early machines (as appear on factory literature) was manufactured by Amal with the cable entering {{parallel to the}} handlebars. Later bikes had the more typical Amal <b>twist</b> <b>grip</b> with the cable entering from below.|$|R

5000|$|Some late-1950s Cushmans, {{designated}} Road King and Pacemaker, had jet-age body styling. Sears sold {{a version}} of these models under the Allstate brand. Cushman scooters featured an automatic centrifugal clutch, which allowed the rider to <b>twist</b> the right <b>grip</b> to accelerate. Oddly, the <b>throttle</b> <b>twisted</b> forward during acceleration, opposite the usual pattern in most other motorcycles and scooters. Cushman claimed 75 miles per gallon, and advertised penny-a-mile operating cost. Cushman scooters usually weighed about 250 to 335 pounds and had as much as [...] In comparison to european scooters, Cushman scooters had a higher weight, larger cubic capacity (up to 0,4 l), but not more power.|$|R
50|$|Glenn Curtiss, {{unlikely}} to {{have been aware of}} the prior uses of the <b>twist</b> <b>grip,</b> used it in his 1904 motorcycle land-speed record machine, and is sometimes credited as the inventor of the device. Indian claimed in their advertisements, also for their 1904 models, to have invented the <b>twist</b> <b>grip.</b> Whether Curtiss, Gottlieb Daimler, or Roper, were the true inventors, the 1904 Indian would be the earliest use of the device on a production motorcycle.|$|R

2500|$|The {{original}} design of 1884 used a belt drive, and <b>twist</b> <b>grip</b> {{on the handlebars}} which applied the brake when turned one way and tensioned the drive belt, applying power to the wheel, when turned the other way. Roper's velocipede of the late 1860s used a similar two way twistgrip handlebar control. The plans also called for steering linkage shafts that made two right angle bends connected with gears, but the actual working model used a simple handlebar without the <b>twist</b> <b>grip</b> or gear linkage. [...] The design was patented on August 29, 1885.|$|R

50|$|The {{first use}} of the <b>twist</b> <b>grip</b> <b>throttle</b> control was on the Roper steam {{velocipede}} of 1867-69. Rather than a sleeve that rotated around the handlebar, Sylvester H. Roper's steam motorcycle's entire handlebar rotated, with a dual mode operation. When rotated forward it opened the throttle, and when rotated backwards it applied the spoon brake. Motorcycle Consumer News design columnist Glynn Kerr said that pioneering this technology was a point {{in favor of the}} Roper's precedence as the first motorcycle, in response to Cycle World Technical Editor Kevin Cameron's position that the 1885 Daimler Reitwagen was more deserving because it used the more successful technology, internal combustion rather than steam. The design drawings of the Reitwagen depicted a <b>twist</b> <b>grip</b> speed control, also applying the brake when turned one way, but when turned the other way, it would have tensioned the belt drive's idler pulley, applying power to the rear wheel {{in the manner of a}} clutch. The actual working model, however, did not have the <b>twist</b> <b>grip,</b> belt drive, or brakes.|$|R
50|$|Traditional scooters (such as the Vespa) {{still have}} manual {{gear-changing}} by a <b>twist</b> <b>grip</b> {{on the left}} hand side of the handlebar, with a co-rotated clutch lever. Modern scooters were often fitted with a throttle-controlled continuously variable transmission, thus earning the term twist-and-go.|$|R

50|$|The Mobil {{originally}} had a 150 cc single-cylinder two-stroke engine mounted between the dashboard and the rider's seat. Access panels {{on both sides}} of the Mobil could be removed to work on the engine. Power was transmitted through a three-speed transmission operated by a <b>twist</b> <b>grip.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Mechanically, {{there were}} few changes within the series. The KZP has over 95% parts {{compatibility}} across the entire production run, {{and in fact the}} <b>throttle</b> <b>twist</b> assembly, which holds the switches for the pursuit lights and siren, kept the [...] "M" [...] position used by the C-series to lock the speedometer needle. A major change was in 2002, when the chain size was changed from 630 to 530, saving weight and increasing acceleration.|$|R
50|$|The MK1 came {{in either}} Metallic Blue or Metallic Red, {{although}} the earliest Grifters were mainly blue. It {{is now known}} that the later MK1 models were more of a bronzy red rather than the original candy apple red.

50|$|The Chairiot solo {{is not a}} conversion; it was {{designed}} from inception {{to be driven by}} a disabled person using a wheelchair. The vehicle is entered through a large rear door and integrated ramp; a floor dock secures the wheelchair to the car. It is controlled by a steering wheel with a spinner knob, along with a combination <b>twist</b> <b>grip</b> <b>throttle</b> and lever for braking. All controls are operable with modest upper body strength. There are no foot pedals in the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|Helicopter rotors are {{designed}} to operate at a specific rotational speed. The throttle controls {{the power of the}} engine, which is connected to the rotor by a transmission. The throttle setting must maintain enough engine power to keep the rotor speed within the limits where the rotor produces enough lift for flight. In many helicopters, the throttle control is a single or dual motorcycle-style <b>twist</b> <b>grip</b> mounted on the collective control (rotation is opposite of a motorcycle throttle), while some multi-engine helicopters have power levers.|$|R
50|$|Helicopter rotors are {{designed}} to operate in a narrow range of RPM. The throttle controls the power produced by the engine, which {{is connected to the}} rotor by a fixed ratio transmission. The purpose of the throttle is to maintain enough engine power to keep the rotor RPM within allowable limits so that the rotor produces enough lift for flight. In single-engine helicopters, the throttle control is a motorcycle-style <b>twist</b> <b>grip</b> mounted on the collective control, while dual-engine helicopters have a power lever for each engine.|$|R
50|$|The first {{production}} model year was 1971, though the sled {{had been in}} development since 1969. There were two 1971 models, the Raider and the Roamer. The 1971 Raider featured a single cylinder JLO 2-stroke engine {{in the beginning of}} the model year, but later may have switched to CCW. The 1971 Roamer featured a 10 hp Briggs & Stratton 4 cycle engine. The production numbers are unknown, but it is believed that approximately 50 '71 Roamers and 50 '71 Raiders were produced. 1971 Raiders and Roamers featured a <b>twist</b> <b>grip</b> <b>throttle,</b> which was found to be hard to control in bumpy conditions.|$|R
5000|$|Vespa T5 Mk1 Cosmetically, the Vespa T5 Mk1 {{featured}} a rectangular head light, an updated headset console {{which included a}} fuel level indicator and a digital or analog tachometer (depending on market), a flat rear end (achieved by adding the [...] "square tail" [...] sheet to a PX body), and a redesigned seat to complete the look.

25|$|California {{inventor}} Jack McCornack {{took the}} Fledge IIB wing and designed a tubular assembly that replaced the Fledge's hang glider seat with a reclined pilot seat, wheeled landing gear and engine mount for a pusher powerplant. The aircraft used a mouth-controlled throttle, as both hands were {{used on the}} tip rudder <b>twist</b> <b>grips</b> which were retained from the Fledge. The aircraft had no canard or tail and was a true flying wing. Power was supplied by a two-stroke Xenoah engine of 16 horsepower driving a 36-inch propeller. This new design, named the Pterodactyl Fledgling, was first flown in 1977. It is also referred to variously as the Pterodactyl Fledge and Pfledge.|$|R
50|$|The Italian broke Hailwood's lap {{record on}} the first lap at a speed of 108.38 mph. Hailwood responded with a second lap at 108.77 mph but Agostini still led by 8.6 seconds. At the half-way pit stop of the 6 lap race, Hailwood had cut Agostini's lead {{to a couple of}} seconds but he then lost time {{adjusting}} the <b>twist</b> <b>grip</b> back into place. Agostini's lead was back up to 11.6 seconds. It was a battle as Hailwood, riding near to his limit, pursued the Italian rider. By the fifth lap, Hailwood had made up the difference and the riders appeared close to a dead heat, with the closest of finishes appearing likely.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Segway {{models were}} activated for three different speed settings: 6 mph, 8 mi/h km/h with faster turning and 10 mi/h km/h. Steering of early versions was controlled using a <b>twist</b> <b>grip</b> that varied the speeds {{of the two}} motors. The range of the p-Series was 6 - 10 mi on a fully charged nickel metal hydride (NiMH) battery with a recharge time of 4-6 hours. In September 2003, the Segway PT was recalled, because if users ignored repeated low battery warnings on the PTs, it could ultimately lead them to fall. With a software patch to version 12.0, the PT would automatically slow down and stop in response to detecting low battery power.|$|R
40|$|Data from {{decoupled}} flight maneuvers {{have been}} collected and analyzed for four AFTI-F- 16 pilots operating this aircraft's highly augmented fly-by-wire control system, {{in order to obtain}} spectral density, cross spectra, and Bode amplitude data, as well as coherences and phase angles for the two longitudinal axis control functions of each of 50 20 -sec epochs. The analysis of each epoch yielded five distinct plotted parameters for the left hand <b>twist</b> <b>grip</b> and right hand sidestick controller output time series. These two control devices allow the left hand to generate vertical translation, direct lift, or pitch-pointing commands that are decoupled from those of the right hand. Attention is given to the control patterns obtained for decoupled normal flight, air-to-air gun engagement decoupled maneuvering, and decoupled air-to-surface bombing run maneuvering...|$|R
2500|$|In 1905, Indian {{built its}} first V-twin factory racer, and in {{following}} years {{made a strong}} showing in racing and record-breaking. In 1907, the company introduced the first street version V-twin and a roadster styled after the factory racer.

In 1914, he rode an Indian across America, from San Diego to New York, in a record 11 days, 12 hours and ten minutes. Baker's mount in subsequent years was the Powerplus, a side-valve V-twin, which was introduced in 1916. Its 61ci (1000 cc), 42 degree V-twin engine was more powerful and quieter than previous designs, giving a top speed of 60mph (96km/h). The Powerplus was highly successful, both as a roadster and as the basis for racing bikes. It remained in production with few changes until 1924.|$|R
40|$|A {{real-time}} piloted {{simulation of}} an air-to-air combat flying task using a wings-level-turn aircraft and various novel controllers was conducted. One {{objective is to}} quantify how the pilot interacts with the controllers and control modes, including: (1) controller versus aircraft response; (2) proprioceptive cross-coupling among axes of the controllers; and (3) biodynamic cross-coupling between the aircraft motions and the controllers. In order to aid in identifying the items listed above, both the target aircraft and the large amplitude multimode aerospace research simulator (LAMARS) motion system were distributed with quasi-random sums-of-sinusoids. Since the disturbances were separated in frequency, spectral analysis techniques were used to identify the three items listed.

50|$|Controllers for {{brushless}} motors: E-bikes require high {{initial torque}} and therefore models that use brushless motors typically have Hall sensor commutation for speed and angle measurement. An electronic controller provides assistance {{as a function}} of the sensor inputs, the vehicle speed and the required force. The controllers generally allow input by means of potentiometer or Hall Effect <b>twist</b> <b>grip</b> (or thumb-operated lever throttle), closed-loop speed control for precise speed regulation, protection logic for over-voltage, over-current and thermal protection. Bikes with a pedal assist function typically have a disc on the crank shaft featuring a ring of magnets coupled with a Hall sensor giving rise to a series of pulses, the frequency of which is proportional to pedaling speed. The controller uses pulse width modulation to regulate the power to the motor. Sometimes support is provided for regenerative braking but infrequent braking and the low mass of bicycles limits recovered energy. An implementation is described in an application note for a 200 W, 24 V Brushless DC (BLDC) motor.|$|R
40|$|A {{proof-of-concept}} hand controller {{for controlling}} lateral and longitudinal cyclic pitch, collective pitch and tail rotor thrust was developed. The {{purpose of the}} work was to address problems of operator fatigue, poor proprioceptive feedback and cross-coupling of axes associated with many four-axis controller designs. The present design {{is an attempt to}} reduce cross-coupling to a level that can be controlled with breakout force, rather than to eliminate it entirely. The cascaded design placed lateral and longitudinal cyclic in their normal configuration. Tail rotor thrust was placed atop the cyclic controller. A left/right twisting motion with the wrist made the control input. The axis of rotation was canted outboard (clockwise) to minimize cross-coupling with the cyclic pitch axis. The collective control was a <b>twist</b> <b>grip,</b> like a motorcycle throttle. Measurement of the amount of cross-coupling involved in pure, single-axis inputs showed cross coupling under 10 percent of full deflection for all axes. This small amount of cross-coupling could be further reduced with better damping and force gradient control. Fatigue was not found to be a problem, and proprioceptive feedback was adequate for all flight tasks executed...|$|R
50|$|The first Tempo moped ever {{manufactured}} was the bicycle-like 1951 Tempo Handy. It {{looked like}} a bicycle, but where the pedals normally would be it carried a Sachs 49 cc, 1 hp engine with pedals and two gears, shifted with the left side <b>twist</b> <b>grip.</b> It had a three-litre gasoline tank and weighed around 28 kilograms. To start the moped, one put the engine in neutral (the start gear) and used the pedals as a kick starter. To pedal the bike, e.g. {{in the event of}} running out of petrol, the clutch lever was kept depressed by means of a small locking device and the transmission put in first or second gear. The engine was stopped by pressing a small switch that grounded the magneto. This moped sold well and was very cheap, but eventually more luxuries were needed and from 1957 Tempo made the rear suspensioned Comfort and Swing (same construction, the latter utilizing a swingarm front fork hence the name.) mopeds using the same engine before introducing the Corvette in 1960. Upgraded versions of the Sachs hand-shifted pedal engine had 1,6 hp and 3 gears.|$|R
