40|$|Reconstruction of <b>the</b> <b>shopping</b> {{center is}} very {{complicated}} and challenging process. Reasons for the reconstruction may be different. In {{this case it}} is about expansion <b>the</b> <b>shopping</b> centre and renovation the older part of <b>the</b> <b>shopping</b> centre in <b>the</b> same time. The project completion should bring a modern touch, elegance and a pleasant <b>shopping</b> atmosphere in <b>the</b> <b>shopping</b> centre Chodov. In this paper I will look at this rebuilding from the marketing view. The aim of this work is to evaluate the rebuilding of <b>the</b> <b>shopping</b> centre Chodov {{and the impact of}} the conversion to <b>the</b> <b>shopping</b> atmosphere...|$|R
5|$|The main {{structure}} of the station and <b>the</b> <b>shops</b> to each side was designed {{with the intention of}} taking upward development on its roof, though this did not come until around 1960 when three storeys of office building were added.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>shops</b> on {{the north}} side have {{cantilevered}} rear extensions. Consequently, the northern external façade of the bridge is asymmetrical, much altered and of no architectural merit, whereas the southern external side clearly shows the hand of Robert Adam.|$|E
5|$|Within 20 {{years of}} its construction, {{alterations}} were made that expanded <b>the</b> <b>shops</b> and changed the façades. By {{the end of the}} 18th century it had been damaged by floods, but it was rebuilt to a similar design. Over the next century alterations to <b>the</b> <b>shops</b> included cantilevered extensions on the bridge's north face. In the 20th century several schemes were carried out to preserve the bridge and partially return it to its original appearance, enhancing its appeal as a tourist attraction.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the strike}} was {{directed}} at <b>the</b> <b>shopping</b> centre in <b>the</b> interest of gaining more publicity and having more impact, the cleaning staff were actually not employees of <b>the</b> <b>shopping</b> centre. <b>The</b> cleaning of <b>the</b> <b>shopping</b> centre is contracted out, and the cleaning staff were actually striking against <b>the</b> <b>shopping</b> centre {{to put pressure on}} their employer, Allans Maintenance.|$|R
30|$|To {{disprove}} {{the null}} hypothesis we create a linear model. The model aims at explaining a shop’s retention rate at increasing distances. Then, we characterize <b>the</b> <b>shop’s</b> size using three different measures. The first measure is the total volume of its sales, i.e. {{the number of items}} that have been purchased in <b>the</b> <b>shop.</b> A larger shop generates high volumes of sales. The second measure is <b>the</b> <b>shop’s</b> variety or assortment, i.e. the number of different products that can be purchased in <b>the</b> <b>shop.</b> Larger shops have a larger assortment of products. The last measure is <b>the</b> <b>shop’s</b> sophistication. <b>The</b> <b>shop’s</b> sophistication can be viewed as the average sophistication of the products sold at <b>the</b> <b>shop,</b> in <b>the</b> same way as the country sophistication is the average sophistication of the products it exports [7].|$|R

5|$|The {{ground floor}} in Merchants Street was {{designed}} {{so as to}} house eight shops, {{four on each side}} of the main doorway. Each shop has another room above, reached by an individual spiral staircase, which space was intended as a home for the owners. These rooms above <b>the</b> <b>shops</b> have a window each, forming eight square windows on the façade, one above each entrance of a shop. The windows are decorated with the symbolic crescents of Pinto. At one point, the space of one of <b>the</b> <b>shops</b> was converted to become accessible from the main building to be used as offices for the Ministry for Health. On the same street, the first floor has the same number of windows however are larger and with conspicuous window frames.|$|E

In Florence, one of said cities, Chief Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi is investigating the disappearance of a library curator. Pazzi questions Lecter, who is masquerading as Dr. Fell, the assistant curator and caretaker.|$|E
5|$|Between 1859 and 1860, Frewin Hall {{housed the}} future Edward VII whilst he {{attended}} Christ Church. The chapel and old kitchen were planned to {{form part of}} a new, third, quadrangle for Brasenose. The valuable rents that <b>the</b> <b>shops</b> {{on the south side}} of Brasenose earned the college provided the most significant reason for the delay in further expansion, which only began in 1886 when work on the west side was started. It was finally completed in 1911, the last work having been done to the High Street frontage. Frewin Hall was reconstructed between 1887 and 1896, as were the chapel and antechapel. It had been in 1886 that Cradock had died and was replaced by Albert Watson.|$|E

A 2010 survey found that despite being in one of the country's most affluent areas, nearly a third of <b>the</b> <b>shops</b> in Altrincham were vacant; Trafford council attributed the high number (78) to the effects of the recession and plans to refurbish Stamford House, which left most of its shops unused.|$|E
5|$|George Mason {{began to}} build his home, Gunston Hall, likely {{beginning}} in 1755.

Mason was proud of the gardens which still surround the house. There were outbuildings, including slave quarters, a schoolhouse, and kitchens, and beyond them four large plantations, forests, and <b>the</b> <b>shops</b> and other facilities that made Gunston Hall mostly self-sufficient.|$|E
