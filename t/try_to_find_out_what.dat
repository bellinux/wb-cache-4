60|$|In conclusion, {{after having}} adopted this new idea, {{my view is}} still that the human {{association}} is the principal factor in {{the expression of the}} blue flower, or at all events in a majority of flowers that bloom more or less sparingly and are usually seen as single blooms, not as mere splashes of colour. Such are the pansy, violet, speedwell, hairbell, lungwort, blue geranium, etc. It may be that in all flowers of this kind too an element in the expression is due to the fair-weather associations with the colour; but these associations must be very much stronger {{in the case of a}} blue flower always seen in masses and sheets of colour as the wild hyacinth. Among dark-eyed races the fair-weather associations would alone give the blue flower its expression. I shouldn't wonder, if some explorer with a curious mind would <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> savages feel about flowers, that he would discover in them a special regard for the blue flower.|$|E

The next time I want three men on special duty I will give others a chance." ...|$|E
