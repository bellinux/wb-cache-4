5|$|In the laboratory, the {{strength}} of <b>this</b> <b>interaction</b> can be measured by finding the temperature necessary to break the hydrogen bonds, their melting temperature (also called Tm value). When all the base pairs in a DNA double helix melt, the strands separate and exist in solution as two entirely independent molecules. These single-stranded DNA molecules have no single common shape, but some conformations are more stable than others.|$|E
5|$|The archetypal {{example of}} this {{situation}} is antithrombin, which circulates in plasma in a partially inserted relatively inactive state. The primary specificity determining residue (the P1 arginine) points toward {{the body of the}} serpin and is unavailable to the protease. Upon binding a high-affinity pentasaccharide sequence within long-chain heparin, antithrombin undergoes a conformational change, RCL expulsion, and exposure of the P1 arginine. The heparin pentasaccharide-bound form of antithrombin is, thus, a more effective inhibitor of thrombin and factor Xa. Furthermore, both of these coagulation proteases also contain binding sites (called exosites) for heparin. Heparin, therefore, also acts as a template for binding of both protease and serpin, further dramatically accelerating the interaction between the two parties. After the initial interaction, the final serpin complex is formed and the heparin moiety is released. <b>This</b> <b>interaction</b> is physiologically important. For example, after injury to the blood vessel wall, heparin is exposed, and antithrombin is activated to control the clotting response. Understanding of the molecular basis of <b>this</b> <b>interaction</b> enabled the development of Fondaparinux, a synthetic form of Heparin pentasaccharide used as an anti-clotting drug.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} by which a polyubiquitinated protein is targeted to the proteasome is not fully understood. Ubiquitin-receptor proteins have an N-terminal ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain and one or more ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains. The UBL domains are recognized by the 19S proteasome caps and the UBA domains bind ubiquitin via three-helix bundles. These receptor proteins may escort polyubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome, though the specifics of <b>this</b> <b>interaction</b> and its regulation are unclear.|$|E

5|$|In February–March 2007 New Horizons {{spacecraft}} {{conducted a}} deep {{search for new}} small moons inside the main ring.

The clumps are {{divided into two groups}} of five and two members, respectively. The nature of the clumps is not clear, but their orbits are close to 115:116 and 114:115 resonances with Metis.

5|$|Saomai {{continued}} {{moving toward}} the northwest and passed over the Mariana Islands on August 6 while continuing to strengthen, and was upgraded to a severe tropical storm by the JMA later that day. The storm then began organizing and intensifying more rapidly, becoming a typhoon early on August 7. Saomai moved into the area of responsibility of PAGASA on August 8, and was designated Typhoon Juan. Due to Saomai's proximity to Tropical Storm Bopha, located near Taiwan, the two underwent a Fujiwhara interaction. <b>This</b> <b>interaction</b> served to shift Saomai's track slightly {{to the south and}} provided the system with in influx of moisture via southwesterly monsoonal flow on the backside of Bopha.|$|E

5|$|Except for his juvenilia, {{little of}} which has survived, Mahler {{composed}} only in the media of song and symphony, with a close and complex interrelationship between the two. Donald Mitchell writes that <b>this</b> <b>interaction</b> is the backcloth against which all Mahler's music can be considered. The initial connection between song and symphony occurs with the song-cycle Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen and the First Symphony. Although this early evidence of cross-fertilisation is important, it is during Mahler's extended Wunderhorn phase, in which his Second, Third and Fourth Symphonies were written, that the song and symphony genres are consistently intermingled. Themes from the Wunderhorn song Das himmlische Leben ("The Heavenly Life"), composed in 1892, became {{a key element in}} the Third Symphony completed in 1896; the song itself forms the finale to the Fourth (1900) and its melody is central to the whole composition. For the Second Symphony, written between 1888 and 1894, Mahler worked simultaneously on the Wunderhorn song, Des Antonius von Padua Fischpredigt ("The Sermon of St Anthony of Padua to the Fishes"), and on the Scherzo based on it which became the symphony's third movement. Another Wunderhorn setting from 1892, Urlicht ("Primal Light"), is used as the Second Symphony's fourth (penultimate) movement.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the monsoon}} surge, Abe {{returned}} to its original west-northwestward track, further intensifying to become a Category2-equivalent typhoon at 12:00UTC on August29. A weakness appeared in the subtropical ridge in association with a short-wave trough, and Typhoon Abe recurved through this weakness, taking it {{along the coast of}} China. Prior to making landfall, Abe attained a minimum atmospheric pressure of 955millibars (hPa; 28.20inHg) on August29 at 18:00UTC as determined by the JMA. It was found by the JTWC that Abe's one-minute sustained winds peaked at 165km/h (105mph) at 00:00UTC August30, and the JMA determined that its ten-minute sustained winds peaked at 140km/h (85mph) at 18:00UTC on August29. As a direct result of <b>this</b> <b>interaction</b> with land, Abe weakened to a tropical storm at 12:00UTC on August31, entering the Yellow Sea and crossing South Korea in the 30hours that followed. It was determined at 18:00UTC on September1 that the storm had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The JTWC ceased tracking the system at 06:00UTC September2, and the JMA followed suit 36hours later.|$|E
5|$|The phase {{behavior}} of lipid bilayers is determined {{largely by the}} strength of the attractive Van der Waals interactions between adjacent lipid molecules. Longer-tailed lipids have more area over which to interact, increasing the strength of <b>this</b> <b>interaction</b> and, as a consequence, decreasing the lipid mobility. Thus, at a given temperature, a short-tailed lipid will be more fluid than an otherwise identical long-tailed lipid. Transition temperature can also be affected by the degree of unsaturation of the lipid tails. An unsaturated double bond can produce a kink in the alkane chain, disrupting the lipid packing. This disruption creates extra free space within the bilayer that allows additional flexibility in the adjacent chains. An example of this effect can be noted in everyday life as butter, which has a large percentage saturated fats, is solid at room temperature while vegetable oil, which is mostly unsaturated, is liquid.|$|E
