25|$|While a fetus of ectopic {{pregnancy}} is typically not viable, very rarely, a live baby has been delivered from an abdominal pregnancy. In {{such a situation}} the placenta sits on the intraabdominal organs or the peritoneum and has found sufficient blood supply. This is generally bowel or mesentery, but other sites, such as the renal (kidney), liver or hepatic (liver) artery or even aorta have been described. Support to near viability has occasionally been described, but even in third world countries, the diagnosis is most commonly made at 16 to 20 weeks gestation. Such a fetus {{would have to be}} delivered by laparotomy. Maternal morbidity and mortality from extrauterine pregnancy are high as attempts to remove the placenta from the organs to which it is attached usually lead to uncontrollable bleeding from the attachment site. If the organ to which the placenta is attached is removable, such as a section of bowel, then the placenta should be removed together with that organ. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> a rare occurrence that true data are unavailable and reliance must be made on anecdotal reports. However, the vast majority of abdominal pregnancies require intervention well before fetal viability because of the risk of bleeding.|$|E

2500|$|... {{imagine a}} puddle waking {{up one morning}} and thinking, 'This is an {{interesting}} world I find myself in, an interesting hole I find myself in, fits me rather neatly, doesn't it? In fact, it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it!' <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> a powerful idea that as the sun rises in the sky and the air heats up and as, gradually, the puddle gets smaller and smaller, it's still frantically hanging on to the notion that everything's going to be all right, because this World was meant to have him in it, was built to have him in it; so the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise. I think this may be something we need to be on the watch out for.|$|E

2500|$|I didn't feel {{at all as}} if I'd been {{watching}} a television show. For one, {{a number of the}} adaptations are feature-length, and the eye-catching cinematography, set design, and period costuming lean more towards a feature film than a basic cable television series. … I didn't watch Nero Wolfe so much as devour it, and that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> a rewatchable series makes it especially worth owning on DVD. ... It's worth mentioning that these DVDs present the episodes as they appeared on A, and although longer versions aired overseas (several were literally twice as long), none of that additional footage is offered here. ... Expertly crafted, masterfully acted, and unlike much of anything else on television, this collection of the entire two season run of Nero Wolfe is very highly recommended.|$|E
2500|$|On December 15, 2005, a {{week after}} Smith's ruling, [...] the North Carolina chapter of the ACLU {{announced}} they would appeal the decision. Their lawyer Seth Cohen told reporters [...] "that the organization disagrees with the judge's finding" [...] {{and that he was}} [...] "confident they will win in the N.C. Court of Appeals". Cohen went on to say: [...] "It's a shame that this matter cannot be resolved sooner. All we have ever asked is that people of all faiths be able to put their hands on the holy text of their choice. It's that simple. We don't understand why <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> a big deal." [...] Cohen also said that members of Judaism have thrown their support behind the case as they {{would like to be able}} to swear on the Tanakh, and that this joining over the issue was one of the things [...] "that's gotten lost in this case".|$|E
2500|$|The BBC assesses {{that many}} members of the Afghan public are vocal in support of Abdul Rahman's execution, though it does not {{estimate}} if these are in the majority. [...] "The courts should punish him and he should be put to death," [...] said Kabul dweller Abdul Zahid Paymen. Mohammed Qadir agrees that he must be executed: [...] "According to Islamic law he should be sentenced to death because Christianity is forbidden in our land". Abdul Rahman's neighbor remarked: [...] "there is no way we are going to allow an Afghan to insult us by becoming Christian." [...] Religious intellectual Shahnawaz Farooqui, speaking on Abdul Rahman's conversion, said [...] "he will have to be executed… If somebody at one point affirms the truth and then rejects it or denies it, it would jeopardize the whole paradigm of truth. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> a big offense that the penalty can only be death. At the very most, some scholars argue that the person should be given time to rethink, and if he embraces Islam again, he will be forgiven." ...|$|E

2500|$|The album {{includes}} {{production from}} Cole himself, alongside Brian Kidd, No I.D. and L Music Cole wants his fans {{to expect a}} different sound, while he speaks about topics {{that have never been}} included in mainstream hip hop music before. The Source magazine said that Cole's [...] "evolution as a producer solely enhances the product" [...] and that [...] "Outside of co-production from No I.D., this album is all Cole at his rawest. Cole said the production on the song, called [...] "Lost Ones" [...] was influenced by New Zealand music artist Alex Gilbert. The album also features live Orchestra and Musical Sections arranged and produced by Larrance Dopson of 1500 or Nothin', with violin recorded by Ginny Luke on them songs, such as [...] "Rise and Shine", [...] "Lost Ones" [...] and [...] "Breakdown". During the final moments of working on his album, when Cole had lost hope for his dream collaboration with Jay-Z, he explained to Vibe how the collaboration came to fruition, [...] "He was in L.A. and I got [...] that day around the VMAs or whatever. He actually pushed back the mastering, we went to mastering with no Jay-Z verse. I was like 'oh okay cool, I guess he can't do it.' They were mastering the last song, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> a Jay-Z move, he called in and stopped the mastering and pushed it back like a week. Only he can do that." ...|$|E
