5|$|In <b>Taking</b> <b>Sides</b> (2001), Szabó {{returned}} to thematic territory he had explored in Mephisto. Stellan Skarsgård plays real life German conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler, and Harvey Keitel a U.S. Army investigator interrogating Furtwängler about his {{collaboration with the}} Nazis. The film won several awards at the Mar del Plata Film Festival in Argentina, including Best Director.|$|E
5|$|In February 1996, Farmiga starred as Miranda in the American Conservatory Theater's {{production}} of The Tempest. That same year, she also portrayed Anne Hartman in a {{production of}} Good at The Barrow Group. Farmiga made her Broadway debut alongside Ed Harris and Daniel Massey in October 1996, understudying the role of Emmi Straube, in Ronald Harwood's play <b>Taking</b> <b>Sides.</b> Following these stage roles she co-starred in the Hallmark Hall of Fame western television film Rose Hill, portraying Emily Elliot, which aired in April 1997.|$|E
5|$|A related {{theme is}} the moral compromises {{individuals}} make in order to succeed in immoral political systems. In an interview about <b>Taking</b> <b>Sides,</b> Szabó said, “I don't think that life is possible without making compromises. The question {{is only one of}} limits: how far to go. When one crosses the line, then the compromise starts to be a bad, even deadly, one.” This theme is dominant in the Brandauer trilogy and, as Istvan Deak points out, may be related to Szabó’s own collaboration with the Communist secret police.|$|E

5|$|In 1643, Governor Winthrop became {{embroiled in}} a {{controversy}} over the propriety of <b>taking</b> <b>sides</b> in a power struggle going on in neighbouring French Acadia. Endecott pointed out {{that he should have}} let the French fight amongst themselves without English involvement, as this would weaken them both. The 1644 governor's election became a referendum on Winthrop's policy; Endecott was elected governor, with Winthrop as his deputy. During his one-year term he oversaw the division of the colony into four counties: Suffolk, Essex, Middlesex, and Norfolk. The ascent of the Salem-based Endecott also prompted an attempt by other Salem residents to have the colonial capital relocated there; the attempt was rejected by the governor's council of assistants.|$|E
5|$|The WSGA, led by Frank Wolcott (WSGA Member {{and large}} North Platte rancher), hired gunmen with the {{intention}} of eliminating alleged rustlers in Johnson County and breaking up the NWFSGA. By that time, prominent names in Wyoming started <b>taking</b> <b>sides.</b> Acting Governor Amos W. Barber supported the cattlemen, who blamed the small ranchers and homesteaders for the criminal activity in the state, while former cowboy and sheriff of Buffalo (the county seat of Johnson County), Red Angus, supported the homesteaders, who believed that the cattle barons were stealing their land.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{perquisites}} of the Times appointment were {{a company}} {{car and a}} large and splendid office at the paper's building in Printing House Square, London. Levin accepted neither; he could not drive and he hated to be isolated. He commandeered a desk in the anteroom to the editor's office, a location that kept him closely {{in touch with the}} daily affairs of the paper. It also gave him ready access to the editor, William Rees Mogg, with whom he developed a good friendship. Levin's brief was to write two columns a week (later three) on any subject that he wished. His range was prodigious; he published nine volumes of his selected journalism of which the first, <b>Taking</b> <b>Sides,</b> covered subjects as diverse as the death watch beetle, Field Marshal Montgomery, Wagner, homophobia, censorship, Eldridge Cleaver, arachniphobia, theatrical nudity, and the North Thames Gas Board.|$|E

5|$|In July 1860, Willis {{took his}} last major trip. Along with his wife, {{he stopped in}} Chicago and Yellow Springs, Ohio, as far west as Madison, Wisconsin, and also took a {{steamboat}} down the Mississippi River to St. Louis, Missouri, and returned through Cincinnati, Ohio and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1861, Willis allowed the Home Journal to break its pledge to avoid <b>taking</b> <b>sides</b> in political discussions when the Confederate States of America was established, calling the move a purposeful act to bring on war. On May 28, 1861, Willis {{was part of a}} committee of literary figures—including William Cullen Bryant, Charles Anderson Dana, and Horace Greeley—to invite Edward Everett to speak in New York on behalf of maintaining the Union. The Home Journal lost many subscribers during the American Civil War, Morris died in 1864, and the Willis family had to take in boarders and for a time turned Idlewild into a girls' school for income.|$|E
5|$|Since {{its initial}} {{resolution}} of July 1960, the UN had issued further resolutions {{calling for the}} total withdrawal of Belgian and mercenary forces from Katanga in progressively stronger terms. By 1961, ONUC comprised nearly 20,000 men. Although their mandate prevented them from <b>taking</b> <b>sides,</b> ONUC had a mandate to arrest foreign mercenaries wherever they encountered them. In September 1961, an attempt to detain a group of Katangese mercenaries without violence during Operation Morthor went wrong {{and turned into a}} fire-fight. ONUC's claim to impartiality was undermined in mid-September when a company of Irish UN troops were captured by numerically superior Katangese forces following a six-day siege in Jadotville. Katanga proceeded to hold the Irishmen as prisoners of war, a development that deeply embarrassed the UN mission and its proponents.|$|E
5|$|Vera Farmiga is an American actress, director, and producer. She {{began her}} career on stage as an {{understudy}} in Ronald Harwood's play <b>Taking</b> <b>Sides</b> (1996) on Broadway.

25|$|In Pyritz, John Cicero {{had hoped}} for prompt {{succession}} to the then childless Bogislaw X, but when children were born to Bogislaw, he intrigued against him {{to prevent him from}} effectively gaining imperial immediacy.

25|$|Barely 300 chasidim survived, and the Rebbe's son Rabbi Shlomo Halberstam took it {{upon himself}} to rebuild Bobov.

25|$|People {{started to}} feel that the police were <b>taking</b> <b>sides</b> with the city council and Faderhuset. Tensions boiled over when a {{demonstration}} on 24 September was attacked by the police. The reason for the police attack apparently was a bottle being thrown at a police van. The police responded with a full frontal baton-charge on the demonstration. This led to several hours of street fighting between police and demonstrators. During the street fighting, three hundred people were arrested, many of which had not been involved with the fighting. A lot of these later claimed to have been brutally treated while in police custody. This sparked anger amongst the supporters of Ungdomshuset and many stated that violent resistance was now not only necessary and justified but the only right course of action that they could choose.|$|E
25|$|With the {{surrender}} of Toledo to Alfonso VI of León and Castile, the city was conquered by Christians in 1085, and it was integrated into the kingdom of Castile as a property of the Crown. Christians replaced Muslims in the occupation of {{the centre of the}} city, while Muslims and Jews settled in the suburbs. The city was thriving and was given the title of Villa, whose administrative district extended from the Jarama in the east to the river Guadarrama in the west. The government of the town was vested to the neighbouring of Madrid since 1346, when king Alfonso XI of Castile implements the regiment, for which only the local oligarchy was <b>taking</b> <b>sides</b> in city decisions. Since 1188, Madrid won the right to be a city with representation in the courts of Castile. In 1202, King Alfonso VIII of Castile gave Madrid its first charter to regulate the municipal council, which was expanded in 1222 by Ferdinand III of Castile.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the problems facing Napoleon III in obtaining potential allies, Bismarck worked feverishly to isolate France from the other European powers. Since 1863, Bismarck had made efforts to cultivate Russia, co-operating, amongst other things, in dealing with Polish insurgents. This important move gained for Bismarck the neutrality of Russia if Prussia went to war, and it also prevented Austria from <b>taking</b> <b>sides</b> with France as Austria fully supported the Poles. When Alexander II came to France on an official visit in 1867, {{he was at the}} receiving end of an unsuccessful assassination attempt by Polish-born Anton Berezovski while riding with Napoleon III and the Empress Eugenie. Tsar Alexander was very offended that not only the French courts had given Berezovski imprisonment instead of death but also the French press had sided with the Pole rather than Alexander. This experience forever shattered his views of France and saw in the reaction his visit had received why his father had despised the French.|$|E
