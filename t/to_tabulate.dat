500|$|New Jersey elected {{its first}} {{lieutenant}} governor in 2009. [...] After the primary election in June 2009, Governor Corzine {{signed into law}} A.3902, a bill from the state legislature that sought to clarify a vague passage in the state constitution concerning a gubernatorial candidate's selection of a running mate. [...] Corzine signed the bill into law on June 25, 2009. [...] The constitution provided that a gubernatorial candidate select a running mate within 30 days after the [...] "nomination." [...] The confusion that arose concerned whether the [...] "nomination" [...] was {{the date of the}} primary election or the date that the vote count of that election was confirmed as final and certified by the state's Secretary of State. [...] As defined by state law, the primary election is held on [...] "Tuesday after the first Monday in June". [...] However, the reported winner of a primary election is not official until the state's 21 county clerks are canvassed for official results after an election. [...] This allows time for the Secretary of State <b>to</b> <b>tabulate</b> stray late absentee ballots (i.e. from military voters stationed outside the state); calculate final adjustments of vote tallies; litigate legal disputes; and conduct recounts if necessary. A.3902 provided a clarification of this deadline as [...] "30 days after primary results are certified by the secretary of state, not the primary election itself." [...] The bill also reduced the number of days in which the June primary election results must be certified from 86 days (which would place the deadline in August) to the fourth Friday in June, less than 4 weeks after the election. [...] By enacting this bill, New Jersey's gubernatorial candidates had an extra three-and-a-half weeks to announce their selection of a lieutenant governor running mate. [...] The 2009 deadline for such an announcement was moved from July 2 (30 days after the primary election) to July 27 (30 days after the certification of election results).|$|E

60|$|Mr. Tegetmeier {{has been}} so kind as <b>to</b> <b>tabulate</b> for me from the 'Racing Calendar' the births of race-horses {{during a period of}} twenty-one years, viz., from 1846 to 1867; 1849 being omitted, as no returns were that year published. The total births were 25,560 (58. During eleven years a record was kept of the number of mares which proved barren or prematurely slipped their foals; and it deserves notice, as shewing how {{infertile}} these highly- nurtured and rather closely-interbred animals have become, that not far from one-third of the mares failed to produce living foals. Thus during 1866, 809 male colts and 816 female colts were born, and 743 mares failed to produce offspring. During 1867, 836 males and 902 females were born, and 794 mares failed.), consisting of 12,763 males and 12,797 females, or in the proportion of 99.7 males to 100 females. As these numbers are tolerably large, and as they are drawn from all parts of England, during several years, we may with much confidence conclude that with the domestic horse, or at least with the race-horse, the two sexes are produced in almost equal numbers. The fluctuations in the proportions during successive years are closely like those which occur with mankind, when a small and thinly-populated area is considered; thus in 1856 the male horses were as 107.1, and in 1867 as only 92.6 to 100 females. In the tabulated returns the proportions vary in cycles, for the males exceeded the females during six successive years; and the females exceeded the males during two periods each of four years; this, however, may be accidental; at least I can detect nothing of the kind with man in the decennial table in the Registrar's Report for 1866.|$|E
