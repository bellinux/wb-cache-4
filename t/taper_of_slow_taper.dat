40|$|Abstract OBJECTIVES: Withdrawal of {{antiepileptic}} drugs (AEDs) {{before and}} during video-EEG-monitoring is commonly implemented to reduce time needed to register {{a sufficient number of}} seizures during presurgical evaluation. There are, however, few guidelines regarding withdrawal rate and observation time. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed an observational study including sixty patients admitted to the national Norwegian epilepsy centre and registered <b>tapering</b> <b>of</b> AEDs and their effect on seizure rate and possible complications. RESULTS: The mean daily seizure rate before admission to the EMU was 0. 4 (range 0. 02 - 4) increasing to 1. 1 (range 0 - 8) at the EMU. 29 patients (48 %) followed a <b>slow</b> <b>tapering</b> rate whereas 31 (52 %) had an intermediate tapering rate. There {{was no significant difference between}} the patients with a daily seizure rate during LTM of more or < 0. 7 seizures per day, an increase of seizure frequency from habitual to during LTM of more or < 3. 3 or 6. 9 with regard to rate <b>of</b> <b>tapering</b> (<b>slow</b> vs intermediate) etiology or AED monotherapy vs polytherapy. Twenty-six patients (43 %) had a sufficient number of seizures registered within 3 days to conclude regarding the presurgical evaluation. Two patients received escape treatment while 25 patients did have 24 h-seizure-clusters. There was no serious event. CONCLUSIONS: Less than 50 % of the patients got a sufficient number of seizures for a conclusive result within 3 days. An increase in the registration period could increase the number of successful registrations...|$|R
40|$|Background: To date, {{there is}} no {{standard}} treatment of folliculitis decalvans (FD), a rare type of cicatricial alopecia. Objective and Methods: The records of 23 patients with FD (1998 – 2012) were retrospectively analyzed, with added data review on the course and treatment of long-standing cases. Results: Initial management consisted mostly of intralesional triamcinolone acetonide, clobetasol lotion, and either cephalexin, minocycline, doxycycline, or tetracycline. Alternatives consisted of rifampicin, clindamycin, ciprofloxacin, and isotretinoin. Remission was achieved in weeks to months {{in more than half}} of the cases, with low occurrence of relapse. The poor responders had a protracted course of temporary improvement and multiple relapses. Conclusion: The majority of patients showed improvement and subsequent remission with oral antibiotics.

50|$|Better {{results can}} be {{obtained}} using subjectively assigned factors to incorporate the <b>taper</b> <b>of</b> the trunk and characterize the basal flare. Trees with major root flare or pronounced taper skew the formula. Extreme root flare produces noticeable overestimates of volume. Conversely, a rapid trunk taper leads to an estimated volume that is too low. This can be addressed if we create multipliers for the averaged volume: one for flare and one for taper. If, by visual inspection, we see a large flare, we could use a flare multiplier of 0.90, otherwise 1.00.

40|$|The {{prognosis}} of {{myasthenia gravis}} (MG) has improved dramatically due to advances in critical-care medicine and symptomatic treatments. Its immunopathogenesis is fundamentally a T-cell-dependent autoimmune process resulting from loss of tolerance toward self-antigens in the thymus. Thymectomy {{is based on}} this immunological background. For MG patients who are inadequately controlled with sufficient symptomatic treatment or fail to achieve remission after thymectomy, remission is usually achieved through the addition of other immunotherapies. These immunotherapies can be classified into two groups: rapid induction and long-term maintenance. Rapid induction therapy includes intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and plasma exchange (PE). These produce improvement {{within a few days}} after initiation, and so are useful for acute exacerbation including myasthenic crisis or in the perioperative period. High-dose prednisone has been more universally preferred for remission induction, but it acts more slowly than IVIg and PE, commonly only after a delay <b>of</b> several weeks. <b>Slow</b> <b>tapering</b> <b>of</b> steroids after a high-dose pulse offers a method of maintaining the state of remission. However, because of significant side effects, other immunosuppressants (ISs) are frequently added as "steroid-sparing agents". The currently available ISs exert their immunosuppressive effects by three mechanisms: 1) blocking the synthesis of DNA and RNA, 2) inhibiting T-cell activation and 3) depleting the B-cell population. In addition, newer drugs including antisense molecule, tumor necrosis factor alpha receptor blocker and complement inhibitors are currently under investigation to confirm their effectiveness. Until now, the treatment of MG has been based primarily on experience rather than gold-standard evidence from randomized controlled trials. It is hoped that well-organized studies and newer experimental trials will lead to improved treatments...|$|R

We used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) at high dosage. We {{did not start}} corticosteroid: if already started, we planned a very slow tapering; 37 patients (80. 4 %) were treated with colchicines. We also assessed the frequency of ANA, anti-SSA and Rheumatoid factor. Results:With our protocol recurrences dropped from 0. 46 to 0. 03 attacks/patient/month (p 1 / 80, in 7 (15. 2 %) > 1 / 160.

The majority of the cases present with parenchymal CNS involvement characterized as a brainstem meningoencephalitis; a rarer presentation is dural sinus thrombosis.

40|$|Optic perineuritis (OPN) {{refers to}} a {{spectrum}} of conditions involving pathologic inflammation of the optic nerve sheath. The classic triad of OPN consists of unilateral optic neuropathy associated with pain and/or disc oedema, but the condition often mimics other optic neuropathies, resulting in delayed diagnosis and suboptimal treatment. We performed a database search of Medline and Ovid in January 2016 for articles published in any language with the keywords ‘optic perineuritis蒺. Sixty articles were found, published from 1956 to 2015. Two reviewers (Tai ELM and Tevaraj JMP) performed an independent screening of abstracts. Articles of interest were subsequently examined. In this review, we highlight the salient features of OPN, with particular emphasis on the clinical differences between OPN and optic neuritis. Although {{the majority of cases}} of OPN are idiopathic, investigations are required to rule out specific infectious and inflammatory causes of secondary OPN. MRI is an invaluable component of the workup, as radiographic demonstration of peri - neural inflammation is diagnostic of OPN.

40|$|SummaryHCV related {{liver disease}} {{is the most}} common {{indication}} for liver transplantation. Recurrence of HCV infection is universal and has a substantial impact on patient and graft survival. Immunosuppression is a major factor responsible for the accelerated recurrence and compressed natural history of recurrent HCV infection. Accumulating experience has provided data to support certain strategies for immunosuppressive regimens. From the available evidence, more severe recurrence results from repeated bolus corticosteroid therapy and anti-lymphocyte antibodies used to treat rejection. Low dose and <b>slow</b> <b>tapering</b> <b>of</b> steroids are better than high dose maintenance and/or rapid tapering. Recent meta-analyses favour steroid-free regimens but these are complicated to interpret as the absence of steroids may simply represent less immunopotency. There is no difference in HCV recurrence between tacrolimus and cyclosporine regimens, but tacrolimus increases graft and patient survival in HCV transplanted patients. There may be a beneficial effect of maintenance azathioprine given for 6 months or longer. There is no conclusive evidence for benefit of mycophenolate and interleukin- 2 receptor blockers. Few data are available for mTOR inhibitors. Better evidence is needed to establish the optimal immunosuppressive regimen for HCV recipients and more randomized trials should be performed...|$|R

Aims: To study the clinical and epidemiological aspects of DRESS {{and to identify}} the precipitating drugs. Methods: All patients admitted to the dermatology ward of our tertiary care hospital from 1 st October 2010 to 30 th September 2013 with probable or definite DRESS as per the RegiSCAR scoring system were included in this prospective study. The clinical manifestations observed in the study population were studied and the common offending drugs were identified. Results: During the 3 year study period, 26 patients fulfilled criteria for probable or definite DRESS. In more than 50 % of cases, the culprit drug was phenytoin.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Introduced in {{the early}} 1960 s, {{diazepam}} remains among the most frequently prescribed benzodiazepine-type sedatives and hypnotics. Patients with chronic use of short-acting benzodiazepines are frequently switched to diazepam because the accumulating, long-acting metabolite, N-desmethyl-diazepam, prevents benzodiazepine-associated withdrawal symptoms, which can occur during trough plasma levels of short-acting benzodiazepines. Although mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms are frequently observed during benzodiazepine switching to diazepam, severe medical complications associated with this treatment approach have thus far not been reported. Case presentation A 64 -year-old female Caucasian with major depression, alcohol dependence and benzodiazepine dependence was successfully treated for depression and, after lorazepam-assisted alcohol detoxification, was switched from lorazepam to diazepam to facilitate benzodiazepine discontinuation. Subsequent to the benzodiazepine switch, our patient unexpectedly developed an acute delirious state, which quickly remitted after re-administration of lorazepam. A newly diagnosed early form of mixed dementia, combining both vascular and Alzheimer-type lesions, was found as a likely contributing factor for the observed vulnerability to benzodiazepine-induced withdrawal symptoms. Conclusion Chronic use of benzodiazepines is common in the elderly and a switch to diazepam often precedes benzodiazepine discontinuation trials. However, contrary to common clinical practice, benzodiazepine switching to diazepam may require cross-titration with <b>slow</b> <b>tapering</b> <b>of</b> the first benzodiazepine {{to allow for the}} build-up of N-desmethyl-diazepam, in order to safely prevent severe withdrawal symptoms. Alternatively, long-term treatment with low doses of benzodiazepines may be considered, especially in elderly patients with chronic use of benzodiazepines and proven vulnerability to benzodiazepine-associated withdrawal symptoms. </p...|$|R
40|$|Aplastic anemia is an immune-mediated {{disorder}} in most cases. The suppression of hematopoiesis by CD 8 + T cells {{and also the}} overproduction of interferon(IFN) -γ and tumor necrosis factor(TNF) -α due to the Th 1 response were demonstrated. Aplastic anemia patients with HLA-DRB 1 * 1501 and oligoclonality of the T-cell repertoire in the peripheral blood showed immunosuppressive therapy(IST), cyclosporine A,(CyA) dependence. A minor population of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria(PNH) -type blood cells, CD 55 -CD 59 -, predicts the response to IST. In patients with aplastic anemia, CD 3 +,CD 4 + IL- 17 -producing T(Th 17) cells were increased in the peripheral blood, whereas CD 4 +,CD 25 +,Foxp 3 + regulatory T(T_reg) cells, were decreased, suggesting the regulation of hematopoiesis by these cells in aplastic anemia. The standard immunosuppressive regimen for aplastic anemia has been horse anti-thymocyte globulin (hATG) and CyA, generating a hematologic response in 60 - 70 % of patients receiving it as the first-line therapy. However, hATG was withdrawn from the market, and rabbit ATG (rATG) is the only formulation currently available in Japan. There are only limited data on rATG as the first-line herapy, and the clinical efficiency of rATG has not been established. Relapse after the initial response to IST is frequent, 30 - 50 %.

50|$|One of many {{recovery}} {{methods are}} 12-step recovery programs, with prominent examples including Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, Drug Addicts Anonymous and Pills Anonymous. They are commonly known {{and used for}} a variety of addictions for the individual addicted and the family of the individual. Substance-abuse rehabilitation (rehab) centers offer a residential treatment program for some of the more seriously addicted, in order to isolate the patient from drugs and interactions with other users and dealers. Outpatient clinics usually offer a combination of individual counseling and group counseling. Frequently, a physician or psychiatrist will prescribe medications in order to help patients cope with the side effects of their addiction. Medications can help immensely with anxiety and insomnia, can treat underlying mental disorders (cf. self-medication hypothesis, Khantzian 1997) such as depression, and can help reduce or eliminate withdrawal symptomology when withdrawing from physiologically addictive drugs. Some examples are using benzodiazepines for alcohol detoxification, which prevents delirium tremens and complications; using a <b>slow</b> <b>taper</b> <b>of</b> benzodiazepines or a <b>taper</b> <b>of</b> phenobarbital, sometimes including another antiepileptic agent such as gabapentin, pregabalin, or valproate, for withdrawal from barbiturates or benzodiazepines; using drugs such as baclofen to reduce cravings and propensity for relapse amongst addicts to any drug, especially effective in stimulant users, and alcoholics (in which it is nearly as effective as benzodiazepines in preventing complications); using clonidine, an alpha-agonist, and loperamide for opioid detoxification, for first-time users or those who wish to attempt an abstinence-based recovery (90% of opioid users relapse to active addiction within eight months or are multiple relapse patients); or replacing an opioid that is interfering with or destructive to a user's life, such as illicitly-obtained heroin, dilaudid, or oxycodone, with an opioid that can be administered legally, reduces or eliminates drug cravings, and does not produce a high, such as methadone or buprenorphine - opioid replacement therapy - which is the gold standard for treatment of opioid dependence in developed countries, reducing the risk and cost to both user and society more effectively than any other treatment modality (for opioid dependence), and shows the best short-term and long-term gains for the user, with the greatest longevity, least risk of fatality, greatest quality of life, and lowest risk of relapse and legal issues including arrest and incarceration.|$|R

Some withdrawal symptoms may respond to anticholinergics, such as atropine or benztropine mesylate.|$|R
