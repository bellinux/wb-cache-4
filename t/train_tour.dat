5|$|On January 17, 2009, Obama {{hosted a}} whistle stop <b>train</b> <b>tour</b> {{in honor of}} the 200thanniversary of the birth year of Abraham Lincoln. Obama reenacted the final part of Lincoln's 1861train tour from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Washington,D.C. to capture the mood of the 1861Springfield to Washington <b>train</b> <b>tour</b> {{traveled}} by Lincoln to his own inauguration. For his train ride to the nation's capital, Obama rode in the Georgia300, a vintage railroad car used by past presidents and the same one he used for touring Pennsylvania during his presidential primary campaign. On the tour, Obama was accompanied by his wife Michelle, their daughters Malia and Sasha, and a host of friends and guests.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to a larger than usual celebrity attendance, the Presidential Inaugural Committee increased its outreach to ordinary citizens to encourage greater participation in inaugural events compared with participation in recent past inaugurations. For the first time, the committee opened {{the entire length of}} the National Mall as the public viewing area for the swearing-in ceremony, breaking with the tradition of past inaugurations. Selected American citizens participated in the <b>train</b> <b>tour</b> and other inaugural events, and a philanthropist organized a People's Inaugural Ball for disadvantaged people who otherwise would be unable to afford to attend the inaugural festivities. Among the celebrations for the inauguration, the committee hosted a first-ever Neighborhood Inaugural Ball with free or affordable tickets for ordinary citizens.|$|E
5|$|Obama {{and others}} paid homage to Lincoln {{in the form}} of tributes and {{references}} during several of the events, starting with a commemorative <b>train</b> <b>tour</b> from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Washington,D.C. on January 17, 2009. The inaugural events held in Washington from January 18 to 21, 2009, included concerts, a national day of community service on MartinLuther King,Jr. Day, the swearing-in ceremony, luncheon and parade, inaugural balls, and the interfaith inaugural prayer service. The presidential oath as administered to Obama during his swearing-in ceremony on January 20 strayed slightly from the oath of office prescribed in the United States Constitution, which led to its re‑administration the next day.|$|E

500|$|During {{his speeches}} to the crowds, he {{emphasized}} the theme [...] "A New Birth of Freedom" [...] using phrases associated with Lincoln such as [...] "better angels" [...] and [...] "a new declaration of independence". Obama referred to patriotic forebearers {{in his speech}} when he reminded the crowds that [...] "we should never forget {{that we are the}} heirs of that first band of patriots, ordinary men and women who refused to give up when it all seemed so improbable; and who somehow believed that they had the power to make the world anew." [...] Thousands of well‑wishers gathered at various points along the train route taking pictures, cheering and waving American flags and homemade signs, with Obama reciting his trademark rejoinder [...] "Iloveyou back" [...] to the enthusiastic crowds. The one-day <b>train</b> <b>tour</b> concluded at Union Station in Washington,D.C.|$|E
500|$|DeHavilland {{became a}} {{naturalized}} {{citizen of the}} United States on November 28, 1941, ten days before the United States entered World War II militarily, alongside the Allied Forces. During the war years, she actively sought out ways to express her patriotism {{and contribute to the}} war effort. In May 1942, she joined the Hollywood Victory Caravan, a three-week <b>train</b> <b>tour</b> of the country that raised money through the sale of war bonds. Later that year she began attending events at the Hollywood Canteen, meeting and dancing with the troops. In December 1943 deHavilland joined a USO tour that traveled throughout the United States, Alaska, and the South Pacific, visiting wounded soldiers in military hospitals. She earned the respect and admiration of the troops for visiting the isolated islands and battlefronts in the Pacific. She survived flights in damaged aircraft and a bout with viral pneumonia requiring several days' stay in one of the island barrack hospitals. She later remembered, [...] "I loved doing the tours because it was a way I could serve my country and contribute to the war effort." ...|$|E
500|$|Bryan's {{plan for}} victory was to {{undertake}} a strenuous <b>train</b> <b>tour,</b> bringing his message to the people. [...] Although Hanna and other advisors urged McKinley {{to get on the}} road, the Republican candidate declined to match Bryan's gambit, deciding that not only was the Democrat a better stump speaker, but that however McKinley travelled, Bryan would upstage him by journeying in a less comfortable way. [...] McKinley's chosen strategy was a front porch campaign; he would remain at home, giving carefully scripted speeches to visiting delegations, much to the gratification of Canton's hot dog vendors and souvenir salesmen, who expanded facilities to meet the demand. [...] Meanwhile, Hanna raised millions from business men to pay for speakers on the currency question and to flood the nation with hundreds of millions of pamphlets. [...] Starved of money, the Democrats had fewer speakers and fewer publications to issue. Bryan's supporters raised at most $500,000 for the 1896 campaign; McKinley's raised at least $3.5 million. [...] Among the foremost supporters of Bryan was publisher William Randolph Hearst who both contributed to Bryan's campaign and slanted his newspapers' coverage in his favor.|$|E

500|$|When {{he heard}} of Eisenhower's posture, Nixon's {{happiness}} {{at what he}} had finally been convinced was a [...] turned to fury, and he stated that if the speech did not satisfy the general, {{nothing he could do}} would. He called in his secretary, Rose Mary Woods, and dictated a telegram to the RNC resigning from the ticket. As Woods left the room with her notes, Chotiner stopped her, took the sheet, and ripped it up. While Chotiner understood Nixon's rage, he felt that the resignation was premature. The campaign manager urged Nixon simply to allow the public wave of support to pressure Eisenhower. He suggested that instead of going to Wheeling as Eisenhower had requested, that they resume the <b>train</b> <b>tour</b> in Missoula, Montana. Nixon sent Eisenhower a curt acknowledgment of his telegram, and a suggestion that they meet the following week in Washington, D.C. Chotiner then called Summerfield, telling him that Nixon felt he had been abused enough, and would not meet with Eisenhower until Summerfield was able to promise, on his word of honor, that the senator would be confirmed as nominee at that meeting. [...] "Dick {{is not going to be}} placed in the position of a little boy going somewhere to beg for forgiveness." ...|$|E
500|$|In early October, {{commentators}} weighed Nixon's advantage, {{arguing that}} placement of {{blame for the}} Vietnam War strictly on the Johnson administration was acceptable — avoiding discussion of war with the excuse {{that he did not}} want to disrupt the peace talks in Paris. However, anti-war protesters heckled Nixon repeatedly on the campaign trail. Nixon addressed the American Conservative Union on October 9, and argued that George Wallace's American Independent Party candidacy could split the anti-Administration vote, and help the Democrats. The Union decided to back Nixon over Wallace, labeling the third party candidate's beliefs as [...] "Populist." [...] As Democratic Vice Presidential nominee Edmund Muskie criticized Nixon for his connections to Strom Thurmond, Nixon continued to oppose a possible debate with Humphrey and Wallace, as well as between running mates, on the basis {{that he did not want}} to give Wallace more exposure. It was also argued that Nixon opposed debating due to his experience during the 1960 encounter with John F. Kennedy, which many cited as a factor in his defeat. In another lesson learned from 1960, the campaign employed 100,000 workers to oversee election day polling sites to prevent a recurrence of what many Republicans viewed as 1960's stolen election. Nixon went on a whistle-stop <b>train</b> <b>tour</b> of Ohio near the end of October. From the back of the [...] "Nixon Victory Special" [...] car, he bashed Vice President Humphrey as well as the Secretary of Agriculture and Attorney General of the Johnson cabinet, for farmers' debt and rising crime. At this time, the campaign released two controversial television advertisements, juxtaposing a smiling Humphrey with images of the Vietnam War and the chaos at the 1968 Democratic National Convention; the advertisements aroused protests from the Humphrey campaign. By October's end, Nixon began to lose his edge over Humphrey; Gallup showing he led 44% to 36%, down five points from a few weeks earlier, a decline observers attributed to Nixon's refusal for a debate with Humphrey.|$|E
2500|$|On December 22, 2016, Seger {{performed}} [...] "Heartache Tonight" [...] as the Kennedy Center {{honored the}} Eagles. A few weeks later, on January 18, 2017, Seger gave away the single [...] "Glenn Song" [...] on his website {{as a tribute}} marking the one year death of Eagles founding member Glenn Frey, with whom Seger was close friends. Starting on August 24, 2017, Seger embarked on a 32-city Runaway <b>Train</b> <b>tour</b> that was originally scheduled to conclude on November 17, 2017 in Chicago. This tour included a show on September 22, 2017 at The Palace of Auburn Hills (Michigan), which was the last event {{to be held at}} that venue. The same day, Seger announced his new studio album, I Knew You When, and released [...] "Busload of Faith", a cover of the Lou Reed song from the 1989 album New York, as the first single taken from the album. I Knew You When is scheduled for release on November 17, 2017, which would have marked the last day of Seger's Runaway <b>Train</b> <b>tour.</b> However, due to [...] "an urgent medical issue with his vertebrae," [...] all concert dates starting September 30 had to be postponed.

[...] Mumford {{acknowledges}} in [...] "Big Easy Express", Emmett Malloy's [...] "moving documentary" [...] about the vintage <b>train</b> <b>tour</b> they'd invited Old Crow to join them on, that [...] "the band inspired them to pick up the banjo and start their now famous country nights in London." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1967, Joplin rose to fame {{during an}} {{appearance}} at Monterey Pop Festival, {{where she was}} the lead singer of the then little-known San Francisco psychedelic rock band Big Brother and the Holding Company. After releasing two albums with the band, she left Big Brother to continue as a solo artist with her own backing groups, first the Kozmic Blues Band and then the Full Tilt Boogie Band. She appeared at the Woodstock festival and the Festival Express <b>train</b> <b>tour.</b> Five singles by Joplin went into the Billboard Hot 100, including a cover of the song [...] "Me and Bobby McGee", which reached number 1 in March 1971.

2500|$|With the {{exception}} of 1975, when the band was on hiatus and played only four concerts together, the Grateful Dead performed many concerts every year, from their formation in April 1965, until July 9, 1995. Initially all their shows were in California, principally in the San Francisco Bay Area and in or near Los Angeles. They also performed, in 1965 and 1966, with Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters, as the house band for the Acid Tests. They toured nationally starting in June 1967 (their first foray to New York), with a few detours to Canada, Europe and three nights at the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt in 1978. They appeared at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, the Woodstock Festival in 1969 and the Festival Express <b>train</b> <b>tour</b> across Canada in 1970. They were scheduled to appear as the final act at the infamous Altamont Free Concert on December 6, 1969 after the Rolling Stones but withdrew after security concerns.
