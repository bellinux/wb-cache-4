5|$|Just days later, Yankee {{right fielder}} Gary Sheffield's cap was knocked {{off by a}} Red Sox fan while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> a fair ball in right field during the 8th inning at Fenway Park. In response, Sheffield pushed the fan. The {{conflict}} was quickly stopped by security guards. The fan was not ejected from the game, although left the park voluntarily. Fan interference was not called and Sheffield's reaction resulted in a run scoring Triple for the Red Sox' Jason Varitek. It was the game-winning RBI. Contrary to most media reports, the fan is still a season ticket holder today. The season ended with both teams, already with guaranteed playoff berths, playing {{each other for the}} division crown {{on the last day of}} the season in a game that had the Yankees come out on top. Both teams wound up losing in the 2005 ALDS, the Yankees to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim and the Red Sox to the eventual World Series champion that year, the Chicago White Sox.|$|E

She added that she had been [...] "observing people and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> nuances" [...] as a step of further preparation.

Growing up in Carmichael, California, Stone met his now-best friends Alek Skarlatos and Anthony Sadler while {{attending}} Freedom Christian School in Fair Oaks, California, continuing their friendship into adulthood. All three men are described as sharing [...] "a deeply religious background and a belief in service to their community" [...] His mom stated {{that he wanted to}} become a soldier, watching countless Navy Seal videos with him. Stone later attended Del Campo High School where he played football, lacrosse, and other contact sports. Del Campo High School teacher and basketball coach Dave Nobis, remembers Stone as he played basketball in junior year through to senior year when he was also in Nobis' psychology class. Nobis said that Stone was always looking out for family and friends, [...] ""His blue-collar attitude and how he cared about others, he would have been the one to step up rather than curl into a ball." [...] and that [...] "He was always <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> his teammates, giving them a high five. After he graduated, he sent me a link to a motivational speech to use in my psychology class," ...|$|E

2500|$|McLaren's absence was {{formally}} registered at 4:00am (local time) and sparked a massive manhunt that drew in friendly forces {{from outside of}} the UK military sphere. McLaren's disappearance coincided with a visit to Afghanistan by the then British Prime Minister David Cameron. Cameron {{was quoted as saying}} [...] "throw everything you have got at <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> this young man", rather than being taken of a tour around the district.|$|E
2500|$|This however left Scott with Fleetwood on {{the lower}} river, which {{included}} the now-booming route to Astoria. [...] The growing demand for riverine transport was fueled by the rapidly developing salmon and logging industries. [...] Fleetwood cut two hours off {{the time on the}} Astoria route, and forced the O.R.& N to run not one but four boats against Scott’s steamer. [...] Emma Hayward and Bonita, plus whatever freight they could quickly load, followed along behind Fleetwood <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> passengers from the landings, while the slower Dixie Thompson and Willamette Chief picked up whatever freight that Hayward and Bonita could not load. [...] This was very expensive for the O.R.& N, which was forced to reduce fares on the route from $5 to $2.|$|E
2500|$|The {{line had}} a good safety record: {{there was only one}} {{reported}} accident on the line. On 1 September 1897 at Tooth's Bank, 2 miles north of Heathfield, the 08:18am service from Eastbourne was running around 4 minutes late and was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> time in order to meet a connecting train at Groombridge. As the train entered the curve at around 40mph it left the tracks. Driver James McKinlay was killed and Fireman Lewis Minns seriously injured, whilst 30 passengers suffered minor injuries. At the subsequent inquiry, Lt. Col. G. W. Addison reported that the main cause of the accident was excessive speed as the driver was attempting to make up lost time {{in order to make a}} connection at [...] The track itself was in poor shape with many rotten sleepers and [...] "curves having irregular elevation" [...] which contributed to the accident. Following the inquiry, much of the track was relaid and the train scheduling was altered.|$|E

2500|$|Liz is {{generally}} portrayed {{as something of}} a [...] "geek". So, while she is an apparently skilled writer, she seems to have very few social skills (in [...] "Rosemary's Baby", Jack describes her as [...] "socially retarded"). For example, while she was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> men at a karaoke bar, a man asked her if the seat next to her was taken, leading her to ask him why she should have to move her coat just so he could sit there. Liz is often shown to be generally insecure and holds a strong concern for how she is perceived by others. Liz is sometimes dismissive of others, a personality flaw that can be connected to her lack of social skills. Assessing Liz's personality up to near the end of season 3, Jonah Weinerslav described her as [...] "an eternal 13-year-old tomboy—scared of sex, obsessed with Star Wars and meatball subs" [...] and as [...] "cling to a fantasy of presexual, junk-food-munching adolescence".|$|E
2500|$|The {{band played}} only two gigs in 1995. This allowed Duritz {{to write a}} set of songs that became the band's second album, Recovering the Satellites. [...] Released October 15, 1996, it was heavier than August and Everything After, perhaps due to the {{addition}} of second guitarist Dan Vickrey, who had joined in early 1994. A response to the sudden fame that [...] "Mr. Jones" [...] had brought, it contains lyrics such as [...] "These days I feel like I'm fading away / Like sometimes when I hear myself on the radio" [...] (from [...] "Have You Seen Me Lately?") and [...] "Gonna get back to basics / Guess I'll start it up again" [...] (from [...] "Recovering the Satellites"). Dealing with the theme of Duritz's unease with his newfound fame, the album was described as [...] "a concept album of sorts about <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> the pieces of a family, a social life and a psyche shattered by fame." [...] This album contained the hit single [...] "A Long December" [...] which received medium to heavy FM airplay.|$|E
2500|$|Cabbage Head (McCulloch) {{was born}} with cabbage leaves in place of hair. He also always smokes cigars and wears a red smoking jacket à la Hugh Hefner. He is {{extremely}} crude and sexist, and {{spends most of his}} time <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> women for sex, using his cabbage head in an attempt to garner sympathy and, hopefully, sex ("Hey– I'm the KING of the mercy fuck!" [...] he declares in his first appearance). In one episode, he is shot in the head at a bar by a feminist crusader (also played by McCulloch) and, in a near-death experience, sees God, who said he created Cabbage Head in his image, at which point God is revealed to have a cabbage for a head himself. Later we see Cabbage Head on a Christian talk show talking about his miraculous survival, although he continues to hold sexist viewpoints, as evidenced by his promotion of a [...] "sacred wet T-shirt contest– er, I mean, baptism" [...] he was conducting. Whenever anyone objects to his odd behavior, he always insists he is being persecuted for his cabbage head. [...] "Why won't you let me forget that I have a cabbage for a head!?" ...|$|E
