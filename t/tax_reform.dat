Fletcher called a special legislative session for mid-June so that the legislature could amend the plan and also authorize tax breaks designed to lure a proposed FutureGen power plant to Henderson. Republican Senate President David L. Williams asked Fletcher to include tax breaks for other businesses as well, but Fletcher insisted on a sparse legislative agenda. The session convened for five days and passed the tax breaks and amended <b>tax</b> <b>reform</b> plan unanimously in both houses. Fletcher applauded the legislature's efficiency.|$|E

He established new administrative centres in Nicomedia, Mediolanum, Antioch, and Trier, closer to the empire's frontiers than the traditional capital at Rome had been. Building on third-century trends towards absolutism, he styled himself an autocrat, elevating himself above the empire's masses with imposing forms of court ceremonies and architecture. Bureaucratic and military growth, constant campaigning, and construction projects increased the state's expenditures and necessitated a comprehensive <b>tax</b> <b>reform.</b> From at least 297 on, imperial taxation was standardized, made more equitable, and levied at generally higher rates.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the welfare effects of proportional income taxation {{in a standard}} general equilibrium model with incomplete markets (GEI). Formally, our analysis is on the allocative effects of state-contingent income <b>tax</b> <b>reforms.</b> <b>Tax</b> <b>reforms</b> are restricted to be anonymous, publicly and truthfully announced before markets open, and {{they are required to}} result in an ex-post constrained efficient allocation. Our main result is to show that there do typically exist contingent <b>tax</b> <b>reforms</b> that are Pareto improving. These reforms, acting directly on the asset span, modify private risk sharing opportunities. Thus, unlike most of the GEI literature, the type of policy transmission mechanism considered does not rely on, second order, relative spot prices effects. Yet, the key welfare effects of our <b>tax</b> <b>reforms</b> are substantially equivalent to those induced through changes in relative spot prices, as for example in Geanakoplos-Polemarchakis (1986), Geanakoplos- Magill-Quinzii-Drèze (1990), or in Citanna-Polemarchakis-Tirelli (2001). ...|$|R

Sweden's floating rate currency gives it a short-term advantage, structural reforms and constraints account for longer-term prosperity.
