25|$|During the Second Great Awakening, Protestantism {{grew and}} took root in new areas, along with new Protestant {{denominations}} such as Adventism, the Restoration Movement, and {{groups such as}} Mormonism. While the First Great Awakening was centered on reviving the spirituality of established congregations, the Second Great Awakening(18001830s), unlike the first, focused on the unchurched and sought <b>to</b> <b>instill</b> <b>in</b> them {{a deep sense of}} personal salvation as experienced in revival meetings.|$|E

25|$|Formidable {{barriers}} frustrated Albanian leaders' efforts <b>to</b> <b>instill</b> <b>in</b> {{their people}} an Albanian {{rather than an}} Ottoman identity. Divided into four vilayets, Albanians had no common geographical or political nerve center. The Albanians' religious differences forced nationalist leaders to give the national movement a purely secular character that alienated religious leaders. The most significant factor uniting the Albanians, their spoken language, lacked a standard literary form and even a standard alphabet. Each of the three available choices, the Latin, Cyrillic, and Arabic scripts, implied different political and religious orientations opposed by one or another element of the population. In 1878 there were no Albanian-language schools in the most developed of the areas claimed by the League, Gjirokastër, Berat, and Vlorë—where schools conducted classes either in Turkish or in Greek.|$|E
25|$|Yuri Sokolov, {{the head}} of the {{folklore}} section of the Union of Soviet Writers also promoted the study of folklore by arguing that folklore had originally been the oral tradition of the working people, and consequently could be used to motivate and inspire collective projects amongst the present-day proletariat. Characters throughout traditional Russian folktales often found themselves on a journey of self-discovery, a process that led them to value themselves not as individuals, but rather as a necessary part of a common whole. The attitudes of such legendary characters paralleled the mindset that the Soviet government wished <b>to</b> <b>instill</b> <b>in</b> its citizens. He also pointed out the existence of many tales that showed members of the working class outsmarting their cruel masters, again working to prove folklore's value to Soviet ideology and the nation's society at large.|$|E
500|$|Among the precepts which Itanhaém and Friar Pedro Mariana sought <b>to</b> <b>instill</b> <b>in</b> Pedro II were: {{that all}} human beings should be {{considered}} as his equals, that he should seek to be impartial and just, that public servants and ministers of state should be carefully watched, that he should not have favourites, and that his concern should always be for the public welfare. Both had as an objective [...] "to make a human, honest, constitutional, pacifist, tolerant, wise and just monarch. That is, a perfect ruler, dedicated integrally to his obligations, above political passions and private interests." [...] Later, in January 1839, Itanhaém called Cândido José de Araújo Viana (later Marquis of Sapucaí) to be instructor of Pedro II's education, and he and the emperor also got on very well.|$|E

[...] They were aware of the [...] "individual suffering and frustration" [...] of the child who was ill-prepared for the demands of school, so they sought <b>to</b> <b>instill</b> <b>in</b> their young viewers an appetite for learning. Two related goals were providing their viewers with basic educational skills, which Lesser insisted was valuable to inner-city parents, and teaching children both what and how to think. [...] The show's creators decided to only include in their curriculum the range of skills of the three to five-year-old child, and not focus on skills they already had, or on skills beyond their reach.|$|E
500|$|Loman's world {{crumbles}} {{around him}} during the play. According to Associated Press correspondent Cynthia Lowry's review of the drama, [...] "we watched an aging, defeated traveling salesman move inexorably toward self-destruction, clinging desperately to fantasies". The play begins with the 63-year-old Loman dealing with a recent paycut after 34 {{years on the job}} {{at a time when he}} is having difficulty meeting his financial responsibilities. In the second act, he deals with being fired. The firing was at the hands of the son of the person who had hired him 36 years prior. In the play, Loman reveals his past in scenes from his memory that the audience is challenged to judge for accuracy. Loman had succeeded in large part due to popularity, which is a value he attempted <b>to</b> <b>instill</b> <b>in</b> his sons.|$|E
500|$|Besides {{military}} expertise, formal military {{language and}} style {{was important to}} rebel commanders as they sought <b>to</b> <b>instill</b> <b>in</b> their soldiers the [...] "spirit, self-image and shape of an army", according to historian Nadine Méouchy. During meetings of the rebel leadership, the mujahidin of the host leader assumed military formation by lining up along the road of the host village and saluting the visiting commanders. The rebels referred to themselves as junūd al-thawra (sing. jundi), meaning [...] "soldiers of revolt", which represented a more noble image than the term iṣābā, which was associated with banditry, and the term al-askar, which referred to the military and had negative connotations due to its association with conscription and repression. Each mujahid received a salary depending on his rank, with cavalrymen (fursan) or officers receiving higher pay than foot soldiers (mushāt).|$|E

500|$|Nigro {{introduced}} Fischer {{to future}} grandmaster William Lombardy, and, starting in September 1954, Lombardy began coaching Fischer in private. [...] "We spent hours in our sessions, simply playing over quality games", said Lombardy. [...] "I tried <b>to</b> <b>instill</b> <b>in</b> Bobby {{the secret of}} my own speedy rise. Eidetic Imagery and Total Immersion." [...] Based on a 1956 game Lombardy played against Povilas Vaitonis (in which he agreed to a draw offer after only 13 moves), Lombardy told Fischer: [...] "Do not accept draw offers. For an ambitious and talented player, accepting a draw is death to a top result. Opponents fear an uncompromising opponent and thus make more mistakes. Act as I advise and do not copy my timidity." [...] Lombardy played a key part in Fischer's becoming World Champion. He was Fischer's aide at Portorož where they analyzed Fischer's games. He was Fischer's second in Reykjavik, where he analyzed with Fischer, and helped keep Fischer in the match.|$|E
