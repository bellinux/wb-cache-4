500|$|... "Nobody Sees" [...] was {{recorded}} by Powderfinger for their 2007 album Dream Days at the Hotel Existence at Sunset Sound Studio, Los Angeles, California, in early 2007 with producer Rob Schnapf. In {{an interview with}} Jay and the Doctor on Triple J in November 2007, Fanning noted that the song is a [...] "bookend" [...] to Powderfinger's early breakout single [...] "Pick You Up" [...] from Double Allergic. He goes on to note that [...] "It's 'who's going <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>you</b> up now?'. Cause I'm not doing it any more." [...] Fanning also noted that he considers the song a [...] "spacey ballad". Though the band had previously released songs featuring piano, they had decided for this album to record with session pianist Benmont Tench, who previously had played for Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, who {{were one of the}} inspirations of the album. This was in contrast to previous efforts where piano parts had been performed by Fanning or local Australian pianists. Despite Tench's performance on the song, Fanning appears in the music video as playing piano.|$|E
500|$|The {{television}} commercial for the Superstar Celebrity Microphone that Homer watches, {{was inspired by}} a popular Ronco Mr. Microphone commercial from the late 1970s, in which a boy becomes popular and [...] "scores with the girls" [...] by using his microphone to be on the radio. Both commercials feature a boy riding by in a car full of friends saying, [...] "Hey, good-looking, we'll be back <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>you</b> up later," [...] a line the staff thought was [...] "hilarious". In the Superstar Celebrity Microphone commercial, the boy sings the 1975 song [...] "Convoy" [...] by C. W. McCall into the microphone. The producers originally wanted him to sing [...] "The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald" [...] by Gordon Lightfoot, a song about the sinking of the bulk carrier [...] on Lake Superior. However, according to Vitti, Lightfoot's licensing arrangement would have required the producers to get permission from the families of the twenty-nine crewmen who died on the ship, so [...] "Convoy" [...] was used instead. Homer also sings the song on the microphone to convince Bart to like the present.|$|E
500|$|Staff from E! Online seemed {{impressed}} with the video's concept and choice of background scenery. They said [...] "what better place for some introspection than the desert, right? No sexy bikini-clad ladies or blue-haired Nicki Minajs to distract you, and when you're done, just call up the helicopter <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>you</b> up (Pro tip: Hang your leg outside of the chopper for extra cool points.)". Stephen Gottlieb from Video Static said [...] "It's a nice bookend with Diddy's – then Puff Daddy – first solo video, [...] "Can't Nobody Hold Me Down," [...] which featured him and Mase introducing an era of big budget hip-hop while driving a Rolls convertible across the desert." [...] While Ed Easton Jr. from 92.3 Now FM drew comparisons to Diddy's earlier video for his 1997 hit single [...] "Been Around the World", thus awarding the video six out of ten. However Easton was annoyed {{with the number of}} videos being released and said that fans were waiting for the actual album to be released.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he replied. [...] "I knew it {{was against}} the Law, but I wanted to save Unc Nunkie and I was afraid if I asked your consent <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> it <b>you</b> would refuse me." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "’Surely,’ ses the cap’n, ’surely you didn’t {{wish to be}} left to perish in {{that little}} craft. I had a supernatural warning to steer this course on purpose <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>you</b> up, and this is your gratitude.’ ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It's {{fortunate}} I {{knew where}} you were, and came round <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>you</b> up," [...] he said, {{and turned to}} the head of the station, who leaned upon the balustrade apparently shaken and bewildered by what had happened.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] said Mrs. Postwhistle. [...] "Well, I shouldn't 'ave felt instinctively {{it must be}} you, not if I'd 'ad <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>you</b> out of a crowd. But if {{you tell}} me so, why, I suppose you are. Come in." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, Wizard, it {{is known}} {{to you and to}} myself. Methinks it would be better were it known to me alone. I have a spoonful of snuff to share (i.e., a bone <b>to</b> <b>pick)</b> with <b>you,</b> Wizard. It would seem that you set my feet and those of the Zulu people upon a false road, yonder in the Vale of Bones, causing me to declare war upon the white men and thereby {{bringing}} us all to ruin." ...|$|R

2500|$|As Bentham's {{thinking}} gained complexity, his style, unfortunately, deteriorated. [...] "It is a barbarous philosophical jargon" [...] {{even though}} it [...] "has {{a great deal of}} acuteness and meaning in it, which you would be glad <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> out if <b>you</b> could. ...

6000|$|The clean English accent {{surprised}} me, and {{the rifle}} lay {{still in the}} hollow of my left arm as I answered him: [...] "Do you forget you are sitting on the best mare I possess? The loss of several hundred dollars is more than I can put up with; and your warning sounds rather empty when I could hardly fail <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>you</b> off with this rifle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{heard that}} you were wanted by the general, Terence," [...] the latter said, [...] "and I congratulate you on your appointment. I am sorry that you are leaving us, but, as you will be with the brigade, we shall often see you. O'Driscol is as savage as a bull {{at the loss of}} one of his subalterns.

I will go round the town, and I have no doubt I shall be able <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>you</b> up what you want cheap. There are so many men get rubbed out {{one way or the other}} that such things are pretty often for sale." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Brother Ferrier," [...] he said, {{taking a}} seat, and eyeing the farmer keenly {{from under his}} light-coloured eyelashes, [...] "the true believers have been good friends <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> We <b>picked</b> <b>you</b> up when you were {{starving}} in the desert, we shared our food with you, led you safe to the Chosen Valley, gave you a goodly share of land, and allowed you to wax rich under our protection. Is not this so?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When you {{are buying}} the seed, O'Halloran," [...] said Dr. Burke, [...] "you {{would do well}} to get a few cucumbers, and melons, and pumpkins. They will grow on the roof, splendidly. And you can plant them near the parapet, where they will grow down over the sides, so they won't take up much room; and <b>you</b> can <b>pick</b> them with a ladder. The pumpkin is a good vegetable, and the fowls will thank you for a bit <b>to</b> <b>pick,</b> when <b>you</b> can spare one.

6000|$|... "Oh, yes, I {{remember}} now," [...] {{the other}} said; [...] "I had forgotten {{that the name}} was O'Connor. I remember all about it now. He told us the story at Vigo, and you were put in general orders by Sir Arthur. I know the chief spoke very highly about your conduct in that affair. It is just like him to remember it, and <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>you</b> out to take Andrews' place. Well, you fairly won it, {{which is more than}} one can say for most staff appointments, which are in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred the result of pure favouritism or interest.|$|E

You can use all the {{arguments}} you like, but it won't matter. I was a fool ever to listen. If you try the same sort of thing again I'm just going <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>you</b> up and carry you off. I've been thinking it over since I left you. My mind has been working absolutely clearly. I've gone into the whole thing. It's perfect rot to take the attitude you did. We know we love each other, and I'm not going to listen to any talk about time making us doubt it. Time will only make us love each other all the more.' ...|$|E
60|$|The German {{officer said}} he was desolate. Steps would be taken--later in the week--the result of which would {{probably}} be to render that young hairdresser prematurely bald. But, meanwhile, beyond skating round and round them, for which they did not even feel they wanted to thank him, the German officer could do nothing for them. They tried being rude to the hairdresser: he mistook it for American chic. They tried joining hands and running away from him, {{but they were not}} good skaters, and he thought they were trying to show him the cake walk. They both fell down and hurt themselves, {{and it is difficult to}} be angry with a man, even a hairdresser, when he is doing his best <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>you</b> up and comfort you.|$|E
