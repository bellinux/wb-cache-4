5|$|The tiger {{catshark}} is {{a sluggish}} predator of a {{diverse array of}} benthic organisms. Its diet is dominated by bony fishes and crustaceans, and also includes cephalopods, polychaete worms, smaller sharks, and scavenged fish offal. It has been observed at the spawning grounds of the chokka squid (Loligo vulgaris reynaudi), feeding on squid that have descended to the bottom to mate and deposit eggs. Documented predators of this species include the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus) and <b>the</b> <b>ragged</b> tooth shark (Carcharias taurus).|$|E
5|$|By {{the evening}} of June22, {{satellite}} imagery indicated {{the formation of an}} eyewall; by this time Andres was near hurricane-status. Early the next day, the center of circulation became embedded within a central dense overcast and Andres intensified into a hurricane, the first of the season, around 0600UTC. At this time, the storm attained its peak intensity with winds of 80mph (130km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 984mbar (hPa; 29.06inHg); the storm was located roughly 80mi (130km) southwest of Lázaro Cárdenas upon attaining this intensity. Twelve hours after becoming a hurricane, most of the deep convection associated with the storm had weakened; however, Hurricane Hunters still recorded 75mph (120km/h) winds despite <b>the</b> <b>ragged</b> appearance of Andres.|$|E
5|$|He {{provided}} new fronts {{to the two}} official {{buildings of}} Rome's civic government, the Palazzo dei Conservatori, the Senatorio, and finally the Nuovo. Michelangelo designed a new façade for the dilapidated Palazzo dei Conservatori and he designed the Palazzo Nuovo to be a mirror complement, thereby providing balance and coherence to <b>the</b> <b>ragged</b> ensemble of existing structures. The construction of these two buildings were carried out after his death {{under the supervision of}} Tommaso Cavalieri. The sole arched motif in the entire Campidoglio design is the segmental pediments over their windows, which give a slight spring to the completely angular vertical-horizontal balance of the design. The three palazzi are now home to the Capitoline Museums.|$|E

5|$|Commentators {{generally}} agree that, {{to precipitate}} {{such a course}} of action as abandonment of an apparently sound and seaworthy ship, with ample provisions, some extraordinary and alarming circumstance must have arisen. In his evidence to the enquiry, Deveau ventured an explanation based on the sounding rod found on the derelict's deck. He suggested that Briggs abandoned ship after a sounding that, because of a malfunction of the pumps or other mishap, had given a false impression that the vessel was taking on water rapidly. A severe waterspout strike before the abandonment could explain the amount of water in the ship, and <b>the</b> <b>ragged</b> state of her rigging and sails. The low barometric pressure generated by the spout could have driven water from the bilges up into the pumps, leading the crew to assume the ship had taken on more water than she had, and was in danger of sinking.|$|E
5|$|The German {{casualties}} were light, {{with only a}} few Askaris and one European killed. The Portuguese, on the other hand, had suffered a massive defeat and by failing to prevent von Lettow-Vorbeck's force from crossing the Rovuma allowed him to continue his campaign {{until the end of the}} war. Estimates of Portuguese casualties vary, with some sources providing figures of over 200 Portuguese killed and wounded and nearly 700 taken prisoner; other writers state around 25 Portuguese killed along with 162 Askari, with almost 500 captured. The prisoners of war were used by the Germans as porters for the 250,000 rounds of ammunition, six machine guns and several hundred rifles that were also captured. With this equipment, the Germans managed to completely resupply their force. Von Lettow-Vorbeck abandoned and destroyed the majority of his force's German weaponry for which he had no ammunition and armed his troops with Portuguese and British weapons. Portuguese uniforms seized from the captured prisoners were used to replace <b>the</b> <b>ragged</b> old German ones that the force had previously worn.|$|E
5|$|Thus locked together, both captains ordered {{their ships}} to pour fire into the other. So closely aligned were they that many cannon on both ships {{could not be}} run out, and instead had to be fired from inside the ships. The heat from this {{sustained}} bombardment was so intense that the wood began to blacken and burn as heavy roundshot smashed gaping holes in the sides of each ship: during the combat <b>the</b> <b>ragged</b> holes torn {{in the side of}} Hercule were so extensive that the planking between the gunports was torn away, leaving wide scars along the ship's sides. Casualties were heavy on both sides: 20 minutes after the action began a musket ball struck Hood in the thigh, severing his femoral artery. Fatally wounded and bleeding profusely, Hood was carried below and command passed to Lieutenant William Butterfield. The French casualties were significantly higher than the British, a result of the much higher rate of fire achieved by Hood's well-trained crew.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Rag</b> was an {{underground}} newspaper published in Austin, Texas from 1966-1977. The weekly paper covered {{political and cultural}} topics that the conventional press ignored, such as the growing anti-war movement, the sexual revolution, gay liberation, and the drug culture. <b>The</b> <b>Rag</b> encouraged these political constituencies and countercultural communities to coalesce into a significant political force in Austin. As the sixth member of the Underground Press Syndicate and the first underground paper in <b>the</b> South, <b>The</b> <b>Rag</b> helped shape a flourishing national underground press. According to historian and publisher Paul Buhle, <b>The</b> <b>Rag</b> was [...] "one of the first, the most long-lasting and most influential" [...] of the Sixties underground papers. [...] In his 1972 book, The Paper Revolutionaries, Laurence Leamer called <b>The</b> <b>Rag</b> [...] "one of the few legendary undergrounds." ...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>RAG</b> 1 gene of Kluyveromyces lactis encodes a low-affinity glucose/fructose transporter. Its {{transcription}} is {{induced by}} glucose, fructose, {{and several other}} sugars. <b>The</b> <b>RAG</b> 4, RAG 5, and RAG 8 genes are trans-acting genes controlling the expression of <b>the</b> <b>RAG</b> 1 gene. We report here the characterization {{of one of these}} genes, <b>RAG</b> 5. <b>The</b> nucleotide sequence of <b>the</b> cloned <b>RAG</b> 5 gene indicated that it encodes a protein that is homologous to hexokinases of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. rag 5 mutants showed no detectable hexokinase or glucokinase activity, suggesting that the sugar kinase activity encoded by this gene is the only hexokinase in K. lactis. Both high- and low-affinity transport systems of glucose were affected in <b>rag</b> 5 mutants. <b>The</b> defect of the low-affinity component was found to be due to a block of transcription of <b>the</b> <b>RAG</b> 1 gene by the hexokinase mutation. In vivo complementation of <b>the</b> <b>rag</b> 5 mutation by the HXK 2 gene of S. cerevisiae and complementation of hxk 1 hxk 2 mutations of S. cerevisiae by <b>the</b> <b>RAG</b> 5 gene showed that RAG 5 and HXK 2 were equivalent for sugar-phosphorylating activity but that RAG 5 could not restore glucose repression in the S. cerevisiae hexokinase mutants...|$|R
5|$|Generally, {{the uniform}} jacket of the Confederate soldier was single breasted, made of gray or brown fabric, with a {{six to nine}} button front. The design of the garment {{featured}} several variations: a four to six piece body, {{and one or two}} piece sleeves, usually with lining, often of a cotton material. The fabric used in these jackets, ranged from the finer kerseys and broadcloths used early in the war, to the cotton/wool blends of jeans, satinette, and cassimere, to name several examples. The exact color of the fabric also ranged from the prewar bright cadet gray, similar to the fabric used by Virginia Military Institute, or West Point U.S. Military Academy dress uniforms, to the sumac and logwood dyed fabrics, that would eventually fade to <b>the</b> <b>ragged</b> butternut appearance. Epaulettes may have been used {{in the construction of the}} jacket, as was the case for the Richmond clothing bureau designed jackets, commonly called today, the Richmond Depot types I, II, and III. Belt loops were also in intermittent use, such as the Richmond and the Charleston clothing depots. Trimming on the jackets range from piped or taped collars, cuffs, and front lapel edges, to full facings on the collar and cuffs, commonly in light blue, dark blue, red, or black. Due to the difficulty in obtaining yellow dye ingredients as the war progressed, yellow was infrequently used by the Cavalry Corps throughout the conflict.|$|E
5|$|In 1859, six guns, four 12-pounders and two 12-pound carronades, were {{installed}} on the bastion, and four years later, five 32-pounders were mounted on the fortification. The earliest defences of {{the southern end of}} the city of Gibraltar included the 16th century Charles V Wall, Flat Bastion, South Bastion, Southport Gate, and Southport Ditch. The complex of defences also included Southport Ditch which was depicted in the 1627 map of Gibraltar by Spanish engineer Luis Bravo de Acuña. On that map which is held by the British Museum, the ditch is shown as a Fosso south of Southport Gate. It was a large trench which extended from the southwestern aspect of the 16th century South Bastion to the Flat Bastion at Prince Edward's Gate. The width of the ditch is now indicated by that of Ragged Staff Gates, which initially served as a water gate. By the late 19th century, the ditch was utilised as an ordnance depot, with a magazine constructed in the 1880s. However, by the early 20th century, that same magazine was used as a pump house. After World War I and reclamation of land, <b>the</b> <b>Ragged</b> Staff Gates were opened to vehicular traffic. Gibraltar's Sunken Gardens, a 19th-century market garden, were a remnant of the western portion of the Southport Ditch, and were filled in at the time of the 1967 Referendum Gate. Trafalgar Cemetery represents an eastern remnant of the ditch.|$|E
