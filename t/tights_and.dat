5|$|Adams {{went back}} to work for the WWF in 1992 and was given a new fan {{favorite}} character of an easygoing surfing Hawaiian who wore bright neon <b>tights</b> <b>and</b> utilized a new two-handed skull vice finisher called the Cranium Crunch. Crush made his televised debut in WWF under his new character on May 9, 1992 episode of Superstars, defeating Kato. Crush made his first pay-per-view appearance under the gimmick with a win over Repo Man at SummerSlam. Crush then engaged in a feud with Doink the Clown, after he was attacked with a loaded prosthetic arm while confronting the clown about his cruel pranks on children at ringside, which caused Crush to miss the 1993 Royal Rumble. The feud culminated at WrestleMania IX, where Crush lost after a second, identical Doink appeared from underneath the ring and struck Crush with the prosthetic arm. At the first King of the Ring pay-per-view, Crush challenged Shawn Michaels for the Intercontinental Championship, but lost the match after a distraction by Doink.|$|E

25|$|The sixth {{match was}} between Shane Douglas and General Rection for the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship. The match started back and forth. Rection sent Douglas into the guard rail and ringpost, but then missed a moonsault. Douglas missed a punch {{with a chain}} he hid in his <b>tights,</b> <b>and</b> Rection {{performed}} a belly to back suplex, causing Douglas to drop the chain. Chavo Guerrero, Jr. came out, distracted the referee, and threw Douglas the chain. As Douglas was about to use the chain, Guerrero notified the referee of the chain, and Douglas was disqualified. Rection won the match, and Douglas beat down Rection and Guerrero.|$|E
25|$|Between 1947 and 1979, a major uniform change {{took place}} for Victorian Police officers. The bobby helmet was {{replaced}} by a black cloth peak cap, a silver police badge was introduced along with white shirts and ties for the general police officers. In 1963, a white pith helmet with a puggaree hatband and a hand-held radio were added to the Victoria Police general duties officers. Along with a new uniform, Victoria Police also introduced the first uniform for women. The uniform for females featured a knee-length skirt, a button-up jacket, a shirt and tie, <b>tights,</b> <b>and</b> peak hats made to fit a lady's hairstyle. Starting with 1972 until 1986, female police officers also carried handbags custom-made to hold batons and firearms.|$|E

500|$|The {{three girls}} all have oval-shaped heads, {{abnormally}} large eyes (inspired by Margaret Keane's art), stubby arms and legs, and lack noses, ears, fingers, necks, and flat feet with toes (McCracken preferred {{them to look}} more symbolic of actual girls rather than going for a [...] "realistic" [...] look, meaning fewer body parts were needed). Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup wear dresses that match the colors of their eyes with black belts, as well as white <b>tights</b> <b>and</b> black Mary Janes. The closing theme to the cartoon offers a nutshell description of the two Powerpuff Girls' personalities: Blossom, commander and the leader. Bubbles, she is the joy and the laughter. Buttercup, she is the toughest fighter.|$|E
500|$|Alaina Huffman {{auditioned for}} Smallville without {{being aware of}} which role was being cast, and was offered the part of Dinah Lance/Black Canary. When the {{producers}} informed her of how major this character is to the DC mythology, Huffman used various comic books and online sources {{to learn more about}} her character. Approached by the producers, Phil Morris auditioned twice for the role of John Jones/Martian Manhunter, and then waited three weeks before receiving confirmation of the role. Morris relished the new design of the character, stepping away from the cape and <b>tights,</b> <b>and</b> going with a more contemporary look. He classified John Jones as Jor-El's [...] "tool, security force, his guardian, and his protector". The actor has stated that he would like his character to lead the future Justice League on the show, as he sees John Jones as a natural leader.|$|E

The background in the music video is a large projection of patterned geometrical figures that constantly alter to divergent colors. Gomez is then seen in a [...] "photo shoot-like" [...] set wearing a white shirt and a zebra-patterned skirt. As the video progresses Gomez {{and the rest of the}} band are seen singing, dancing, playing instruments and using props. Gomez holds a mirror and plastic roses, which she then throws away, in conjunction to the song's lines. The video ends with Gomez taking a quick bow while still holding her microphone.|$|E

500|$|The {{reasons why}} Thespis went unrevived are not known. Some {{commentators}} speculate that Sullivan used {{the music in}} his other operas. If this were true, then [...] "for this reason alone a revival would have become impossible". However, evidence that Sullivan did so has eluded discovery. Another {{possible explanation is that}} Gilbert and Sullivan came to regard Thespis, with its [...] "brazen girls in <b>tights</b> <b>and</b> short skirts", and broad burlesque-style humour, as [...] "the kind of work they wished to avoid". They later renounced travesti roles and revealing dresses on their actresses, and made publicly known their disapproval of them. In 1885, Hollingshead wrote to the Pall Mall Gazette, [...] "Mr. Gilbert is somewhat severe on a style of burlesque which he did much to popularise in the old days before he invented what I may call burlesque in long clothes. … Mr Gilbert never objected to the dresses in Robert the Devil nor to the dresses in Thespis." ...|$|E
500|$|Gaga {{promoted}} the dress by tweeting {{earlier in the}} day, [...] "At 6pm EST today we will beta test Volantis with the world.

According to Amy Phillips from Pitchfork Media, [...] " [...] roared to life and lurched forward a few feet, hovering. Then it did the same thing, backwards. Then it stopped. That was it." [...] Hampp reported that [...] "one attendee disparagingly referred to [...] as a 'Zamboni with fans'." [...] Gaga quipped that the dress was [...] "maybe a small step for Volantis... but a big-time step" [...] for her. The singer also announced plans to stage the first musical performance from space, following previous reports about her singing at Zero G Colony, a music festival scheduled to occur at Spaceport America in New Mexico in 2015. The concert was later cancelled [...] when a test flight for the project crashed.|$|E

[...] Lanford Beard of Entertainment Weekly praised the video {{saying that it}} [...] "shows Madonna looking the best she has since at least 2005's video for 'Hung Up'. Of course there is the {{requisite}} writhing, hip grinding, a rousing dance sequence, and a smoldering mantourage. It is, in a word, awesome". HitFix's Melinda Newman praised the direction by Mert and Marcus, feeling that [...] "the clip is a luscious collection of erotic images: two men biting an apple together, backlit men dancing in high heels, and Madge, looking as if she’s a dewy 25-year old." [...] A review in The Week praised the video for being self-referential with its [...] "dark, dominatrix-y" [...] visuals. Amanda Dobbins from New York magazine gave a positive review for the appearance of Kazaky and Madonna's look in the video. Caryn Ganz from Spin noticed that along with her old videos, Madonna also referenced her contemporary releases, like the videos for [...] "Give It 2 Me" [...] (2008) and [...] "Celebration", with the scenes showing her [...] "incredible" [...] dancing alone.|$|E

500|$|The {{team was}} formed in August 1995 when Scott Antol signed a WCW {{contract}} and was placed with [...] "tag team specialist" [...] Marcus Alexander Bagwell. In the process, both men changed their ring names, Antol changing his last name to [...] "Riggs" [...] and Bagwell shortening his name to simply Marcus Bagwell. Once together, they both wore short shorts and leather vests [...] (later wrestling <b>tights</b> <b>and</b> suspenders) to the ring and began clapping their hands over their head in time with their entrance music, which sang their praises between choruses of the team name being repeated over and over. They wrestled on the first episode of Nitro, defeating World Tag Team Champions Dick Slater and Bunkhouse Buck in a non-title match. [...] Their first major appearance together came at the Fall Brawl pay-per-view, where they defeated The Nasty Boys in a match that aired on Main Event. Pro Wrestling Illustrated magazine stated that the team [...] "work well as a unit and could soon challenge for the belts". Bagwell commented on the team in a scripted interview, saying that he believed that his previous tag teams had failed {{because they were in}} a rush to win the title belts and that he planned to work slowly toward a title victory with Riggs.|$|E
500|$|In live {{performances}} with Tool, Keenan {{has often been}} known to be situated on a platform towards {{the rear of the}} stage, without a spotlight, facing the backdrop rather than the audience. Breckinridge Haggerty, the band's live video director, says that the dark spaces on stage [...] "are mostly for Maynard". He explains, [...] "a lot of the songs are a personal journey for him and he has a hard time with the glare of the lights when he's trying to reproduce these emotions for the audience. He needs a bit of personal space, and he feels more comfortable in the shadows." [...] An exception, which surprised even devout Tool fans, occurred when a fan climbed on stage and attempted to hug Keenan during the band's performance of [...] "Pushit". After dropping the fan to the ground with a gentle hip toss, Keenan, continuing to sing, wrapped himself around the man's back into a rear naked choke. [...] He held the man without actually constricting his neck, allowing him to raise his fist in celebration. Keenan eventually turned the man to his stomach and sat on his back, where he stayed for [...] "an uncomfortably long period of time." [...] His appearance with Tool has included the Mohawk hairstyle, wigs, Kabuki masks, bras, <b>tights,</b> <b>and</b> his entire body in blue paint. This is contrasted with a variety of long haired wigs while performing with or promoting A Perfect Circle.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} reviews were more {{critical}} of Haggard's work. Although the reviewer of She in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine considered it better than King Solomon's Mines, he opined, [...] "Mr. Rider Haggard has not proved as yet that he has {{anything that can be}} called imagination at all... It might be wrought up into an unparalleled stage effect: but it is rather a failure in pen and ink. The more fearful and wonderful such circumstances are intended to be, the more absurd is the failure of them". Even more scathing was Augustus Moore in the May edition of Time: A Monthly Miscellany, who declared: [...] "In Mr Haggard's book I find none of the powerful imagination, the elaborate detail, the vivid English which would entitle his work to be described as a romance... it {{seems to me to be}} the method of the modern melodrama". Moore was particularly dismissive of the novel's style and prose: [...] "Mr Haggard cannot write English at all. I do not merely refer to his bad grammar, which a boy at a Boarding School would deserve to be birched for... It can only have been written by a man who not only knew nothing, but cared nothing for 'English undefiled'." [...] Haggard's English was a common source of criticisms, but Moore was even dismissive of the character of She who widely garnered universal praise. [...] "Ayesha", Moore declares, [...] "is about as impressive as the singing chambermaid who represents the naughty fairy of a pantomime in <b>tights</b> <b>and</b> a tow wig". Concluding his review, Moore wondered at the success that had greeted She: ...|$|E

500|$|The main show {{started with}} Cyrus {{descending}} {{onto the stage}} in a neon pink cube that bore a digital image of her silhouette, as pink fireworks were fired behind her. Donning a long, sequined, cheetah and black-striped tank top and cardigan, sparkling black tights, black boots, and the blonde Hannah Montana wig, she began to perform the concert's opening number, [...] "Rock Star". In continuation, Cyrus was joined by multiple backup dancers to perform dance routines for [...] "Life's What You Make It". Removing the cardigan, she concluded the segment with [...] "Just Like You". Still costumed as Hannah Montana, Cyrus reappeared {{from the back of}} the stage, wearing sparkly blue denim jeans, a white tank top, a blue denim vest, and shiny silver tie; she performed [...] "Old Blue Jeans" [...] among female backup dancers and [...] "Nobody's Perfect" [...] roaming the stage alone. The next segment began with the performance of [...] "Pumpin' Up the Party", where Cyrus dressed with a pink and purple sequined mini-dress, fuchsia ad violet <b>tights</b> <b>and</b> maroon boots and dancers wore 1960s-inspired attires while performing calisthenics. The segment continued with [...] "I Got Nerve", which required participation and elaborate routines on behalf of the dancers, and a duet with the opening act. While they served as opening act, [...] "We Got the Party" [...] was performed as a duet with the Jonas Brothers. She annexed a pink and purple trench coat to her attire and performed with the Jonas Brothers, who also played electric guitars. At one point of the performance, Cyrus disappeared to be replaced by a body double who completed the performance. While Aly & A.J. and Everlife served as opening acts, a postmodern cover of Kiss' [...] "Rock and Roll All Nite" [...] (1975) was performed by them and Cyrus wore a geometric-patterned cocktail dress. Afterwards, the opening act performed an interlude of several songs.|$|E
500|$|Casting for {{the film}} began as soon as Madonna had signed up for it. Griffin Dunne was signed to play the part of Loudon Trott, a lawyer whose job was to help Nikki get on a bus, after she was released. Initially Madonna had thought of asking Penn to play the part of Detective Bellson, but Penn was serving a 60-day jail term, having {{violated}} the probation he received in 1986, for assaulting a friend of Madonna and attacking an extra {{on the set of}} At Close Range. The part went to Robert Swan, followed by the signing of John McMartin, Haviland Morris and Bibi Besch as Trott's father-in-law, fiancée, and mother-in-law [...] respectively. Madonna herself commented that she had a lot in common with the character Nikki. [...] "She's courageous and sweet and funny and misunderstood. But she clears her name in the last, and that's always good to do. I'm continuously doing that with the public. I liked Nikki's tough side and her sweet side. The toughness is only a mask for the vulnerability she feels inside." [...] Madonna was also offered the lead role in the Blake Edwards comedy film Blind Date opposite to Bruce Willis, but she refused it in favor of Slammer. She said, [...] "The thing I had planned to do after Shanghai Surprise was Blind Date at Tri-Star. I was supposed to have the approval of the director and the leading man, but they didn't tell me they'd already hired Bruce Willis. That... just didn't work out. But I was really excited about doing a real physical, screwball comedy, so when Jamie brought this up, it was like my reward." [...] Coati Mundi, member of Kid Creole and the Coconuts, and Madonna's long-time friend joined the cast {{to play the role of}} Raoul, Nikki's enemy. Costume designer Deborah Scott was signed to create the wardrobe {{for the film}}. Madonna, who visualized the character of Nikki as a dizzy screwball blond, started watching the screwball comedies of the sixties, especially the work of actors like Cary Grant, Clark Gable, Carole Lombard and Judy Holiday. She asked Scott to create comical rah-rah and ballet tutu skirts for the character, with fishnet <b>tights</b> <b>and</b> loud make-up. Scott also designed a glamorous Monroe-esque dress for the love scene between her and Dunne.|$|E
