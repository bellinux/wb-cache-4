40|$|<b>Two</b> <b>row</b> barley (Hordeum distichum) is {{documented}} by written sources in Europe since Antiquity. On the other hand, archaeobotany keeps peculiarly silent about this cereal. This paper presents {{the discovery of}} carbonised grain concentrations on two Roman period sites : Le Villard, in Auvergne, and Bourbousson III, in the Rhône valley. It shows <b>two</b> <b>row</b> barley growing during the 2 nd and 3 rd centuries AD and allows the discussion, using archaeobotanical and written data, of its role within Gallo-roman agriculture. Of special interest is spring sowing of <b>two</b> <b>row</b> barley in Bourbousson III, complementing winter naked wheat cultivation. Identification criteria are also presented and risks of errors more peculiar to archaeobotanical studies are stressed. Up to now, these difficulties could have lead archaeobotanist to an under evaluation of <b>two</b> <b>row</b> barley growing.

5|$|Hennig and Janensch, while {{grouping}} the dermal armour elements {{into four}} distinct types, recognised an apparently continuous change of shape among them, shorter and flatter plates {{at the front}} gradually merging into longer and more pointed spikes towards the rear, suggesting an uninterrupted distribution along the entire body, in fifteen pairs. Because each type of osteoderm was found in mirrored left and right versions, it seems probable that all types of osteoderms were distributed in <b>two</b> <b>rows</b> {{along the back of}} the animal, a marked contrast to the better-known North American Stegosaurus, which had one row of plates on the neck, trunk and tail, and <b>two</b> <b>rows</b> of spikes on the tail tip. There is one type of spike that differs from all others in being strongly, and not only slightly, asymmetrical, and having a very broad base. Because of bone morphology classic reconstructions placed it on the hips, at the iliac blade, while many recent reconstructions place it on the shoulder, because a similarly shaped spike is known to have existed on the shoulder in the Chinese stegosaurs Gigantspinosaurus and Huayangosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species in}} this order have five arms and <b>two</b> <b>rows</b> of tube feet with suckers. There are {{conspicuous}} marginal plates {{on the arms}} and disc. Some species have paxillae and in some, the main pedicellariae are clamp-like and recessed into the skeletal plates. This group includes the cushion stars, the leather star and the sea daisies.|$|E
5|$|On {{the upright}} collar of full generals, {{lieutenant}} generals, major generals, and brigadier generals three stars were stitched within a wreath, all embroidered in gold coloring. The center star was {{slightly larger than}} the other stars. It {{was not possible to}} know which grade of general an officer was by his collar insignia. However, major generals and lieutenant generals wore <b>two</b> <b>rows</b> of nine buttons in groups of three down the front of the overcoat, and brigadier generals wore <b>two</b> <b>rows</b> of eight buttons in groups of two. However, Confederate Army Regulations had no distinction between the general officer grades, and had only the insignia for brigadier generals recognized. At least three general officers did not wear the prescribed uniform: Robert E. Lee, who wore the uniform of a colonel, refusing to wear a general's insignia until the Confederate victory; Joseph L. Hogg, who died of a fever; and Benjamin McCulloch.|$|E

5|$|The church, {{without an}} apse and a transept, {{maintained}} its original single-nave plan {{until at least}} 1627. In 1662 the naves had become three, separated by <b>two</b> <b>rows</b> of square brick pillars and surmounted by vaults. The church had five altars in 1627, increasing to six in 1649. In 1726 the closing of its side gate along the Borgo Vecchio made room for another altar.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>two</b> <b>rows</b> of {{this table}} are straightforward.

Similarly, the homotopy groups πi(S1) of the 1-sphere are trivial for i > 1, because the universal covering space, R, {{which has the}} same higher homotopy groups, is contractible.|$|E

Because of its habit of urohidrosis, the scaly portions of its legs are often streaked white with uric acid.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{outlines}} {{the early history}} of wampum, explaining its origin, its value to Native Americans, and its first observations by Europeans. It then considers how wampum, as it existed in the 1610 s, fits the role of wampum as described in the Tawagonshi document and fits with its manifestation in the <b>Two</b> <b>Row</b> Belt. The essay argues that key elements in the Tawagonshi document and the <b>Two</b> <b>Row</b> Belt itself are inconsistent with wampum use as recorded in archaeological, documentary, and visual sources. This finding does not discount the possibility of a Dutch-Native agreement similar to the one recorded in the Tawagonshi document that included wampum rituals {{and the creation of a}} wampum belt such as the <b>Two</b> <b>Row</b> Belt...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Two</b> <b>Row</b> Wampum {{continues}} {{to play a role}} in defining the relationship between citizens of New York State and Haudenosaunee residents of the region. In 2006, a dispute over whether Onondaga Nation students could be permitted to wear native regalia at their graduation ceremony at Lafayette High School in LaFayette, New York, was resolved in part through the school board's consideration and application of the principles of the <b>Two</b> <b>Row</b> Wampum.|$|R

5|$|<b>Two</b> <b>rows</b> of {{alternating}} plates. By {{the early}} 1960s, this had become (and remains) the prevalent idea, mainly because some S. stenops fossils {{in which the}} plates are still partially articulated show this arrangement.

5|$|Amphibians usually swallow food whole but may chew {{it lightly}} first to subdue it. They {{typically}} have small hinged pedicellate teeth, a feature unique to amphibians. The base and crown {{of these are}} composed of dentine separated by an uncalcified layer and they are replaced at intervals. Salamanders, caecilians and some frogs have one or <b>two</b> <b>rows</b> of teeth in both jaws, but some frogs (Rana spp.) lack teeth in the lower jaw, and toads (Bufo spp.) have no teeth. In many amphibians there are also vomerine teeth attached to a facial bone in {{the roof of the}} mouth.|$|E
