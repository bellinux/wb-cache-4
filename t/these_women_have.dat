Analysis of specific carbon isotope and nitrogen isotope ratios left by maize consumption in the bones and cartilage of the women as well as pathologies indicative of poor health and nutritional stress; have led researchers to also conclude they were of a lower social status than elite burials in the mound, consuming more maize and less animal protein than elite individuals.|$|E

25|$|In her book, Love's Rite, Ruth Vanita {{examines}} the phenomena of same-sex weddings, many by Hindu rites, {{which have been}} reported by the Indian press over {{the last thirty years}} and with increasing frequency. In the same period, same-sex joint suicides have also been reported. Most of these marriages and suicides are by lower middle-class female couples from small towns and rural areas across the country; <b>these</b> <b>women</b> <b>have</b> no contact with any LGBT movements. Both cross-sex and same-sex couples, when faced with family opposition, tend to resort to either elopement and marriage or to joint suicide in the hope of reunion in the next life. Vanita examines how Hindu doctrines such as rebirth and the genderlessness of the soul are often interpreted to legitimize socially disapproved relationships, including same-sex ones. In a 2004 survey, most — though not all — swamis said they opposed the concept of a Hindu-sanctified gay marriage. But several Hindu priests have performed same-sex marriages, arguing that love is the result of attachments from previous births and that marriage, as a union of spirit, is transcendental to gender.|$|E

She picked Susan's hamster burial scene {{and the scene}} in which Gabrielle eases Carlos' conscience her favorite scenes in the episode. Tran also appreciated the writers' decision not to prolong Tom and Lynette's attempts to hide their separation, opining: [...] "Last season, their fights were relentless and exhausting. I was glad that this storyline wasn’t dragged out too much, as Tom and Lynette were both able to rip off the band-aid and let their children know of their new status." [...] She also enjoyed {{the addition of the}} Ben character and hoped that the Renee character would receive her own storyline this season. John Griffiths of Us Weekly awarded the episode 3.5 out of 4 stars, writing, [...] "After last season's silly antics, the venerable dramedy pulls itself together for a clever final round." [...] He opined that Carlos and Susan's guilt helped keep the cover-up storyline compelling. The Hollywood Reporter Jethro Nededog was positive in his review of the episode, writing: [...] "It was a strong return, because it relied on the series’ strength, which is the bond <b>these</b> <b>women</b> <b>have</b> with each other." [...] Jamie Heller of The A.V. Club noted that [...] "there’s almost no other plot development" [...] in the episode apart from the cover-up and Lynette and Tom's separation.|$|E

You next see that <b>these</b> <b>women</b> <b>have</b> Mr. Middleton's (that is, Mr. Hastings's) guaranty for the allowances which are made and settled upon them, and {{for the maintenance of}} their attendants, for the security and enjoyment of their own possessions, for their having a law officer of high rank, a moulavy, of their own. In short, there is a regular establishment formed for all these women: they are not separated as a part distinct from the Begums, but they are put by this very guaranty entirely under their management; the maintenance of the children is secured; the whole order and economy of their establishment is delivered entirely to the Begum, the grandmother, and the Begum, the mother, of the Nabob.|$|E

A stew is hacked meat boiled up in a big pot. It has much fat floating on the top. After you have eaten your fill you want to sit about quiet. The men are fed usually in a large tent or barn. We have a barn. It is not a clean barn, and just to make it more like a picnic there are insufficient plates, knives and forks. (I tell you, no army people can count beyond eight or ten.) The corporals after their morning's work have to carve. When they have done carving they tell me they feel they have had enough dinner. They sit about looking pale, and wander off afterwards to the village pub. (I shall probably become a corporal soon.)

He wants that young madam over there, a young stiff-necked generation that she is. Far better sport than with the nobly-planned sort: hollow frauds that they are. Better sport too than with a Carmen, who gives herself away too much, In these women there is something shy and defiant and un-get-atable.
