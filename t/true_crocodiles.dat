5|$|The Crocodilia (or Crocodylia) is {{an order}} of mostly large, predatory, semiaquatic reptiles, known as crocodilians. They first {{appeared}} 83.5 million {{years ago in the}} Late Cretaceous period (Campanian stage) and are the closest living relatives of birds, as the two groups are the only known survivors of the Archosauria. Members of the order's total group, the clade Pseudosuchia, appeared about 250 million years ago in the Early Triassic period, and diversified during the Mesozoic era. The order Crocodilia includes the <b>true</b> <b>crocodiles</b> (family Crocodylidae), the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), and the gharial and false gharial (family Gavialidae). Although the term 'crocodiles' is sometimes used to refer to all of these, crocodilians is a less ambiguous vernacular term for members of this group.|$|E
2500|$|Crocodiles (subfamily Crocodylinae) or <b>true</b> <b>crocodiles</b> {{are large}} aquatic {{reptiles}} that live throughout the tropics in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Australia.

A broader {{sense of the term}} crocodile, Crocodylidae that includes Tomistoma, is not used in this article. The term crocodile here applies to only the species within the subfamily of Crocodylinae. The term is sometimes used even more loosely to include all extant members of the order Crocodilia, which includes [...] the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), the gharial and false gharial (family Gavialidae), and all other living and fossil Crocodylomorpha.|$|E
50|$|The two extant genera of <b>true</b> <b>crocodiles,</b> Crocodylus and Osteolaemus, {{are in the}} {{subfamily}} Crocodylinae.

50|$|Crocodylus thorbjarnarsoni is an {{extinct species}} of {{crocodile}} from the Pliocene and Pleistocene of the Turkana Basin in Kenya. It {{is closely related}} to the species Crocodylus anthropophagus, which lived during the same time in Tanzania. C. thorbjarnarsoni could be the largest known <b>true</b> <b>crocodile,</b> with the largest skull found indicating a possible total length up to 7.6 m. It may have been a predator of early hominins. Crocodylus thorbjarnarsoni was named by Christopher Brochu and Glenn Storrs in 2012 in honor of John Thorbjarnarson, a conservationist who worked to protect endangered crocodilians.|$|R

5000|$|Because it {{is known}} from fragmentary material, its {{relationships}} to modern crocodylians are unclear. It {{appears to have been}} a crocodylid, but could be closer to either the African dwarf crocodiles (Osteolaemus) or the <b>true</b> <b>crocodiles</b> (Crocodylus).|$|E
50|$|Broom {{believes}} {{with the}} evidence present in the specimens that Sphenosuchus is a Pseudosuchian which is well along the line {{that leads to the}} <b>true</b> <b>Crocodiles.</b> In a paper published by V Huene he emphasizes Sphenosuchus as a very important stage of crocodile evolution.|$|E
2500|$|Currently, most sources {{state that}} the {{saltwater}} crocodile does not have subspecies. However, based largely on morphological variability, some have claimed that not only are there subspecies but that C. porosus actually houses a species complex. In 1844, S. Müller and H. Schlegel attempted to describe crocodiles from Java and Borneo as a new species which they named C. raninus, subsequently given the informal common names of the Indonesian crocodile or Bornean crocodile. According to Ross (1992), specimens of C. raninus can reliably be distinguished both from Siamese <b>crocodiles</b> and <b>true</b> saltwater <b>crocodiles</b> {{on the basis of}} the number ventral scales and on the presence of four postoccipital scutes which are often absent in <b>true</b> saltwater <b>crocodiles.</b> Another attempt to derive a species came from Australia, Wells & Wellington (1985), and was based upon large-bodied, relatively large-headed and short-tailed crocodiles from Australia. The type specimen reported for this so-called species was a crocodile nicknamed [...] "Sweetheart" [...] that was inadvertently killed in 1979 (drowned after being overly-anesthetized in an attempt to relocate it after it had taken to attacking boats). However, this [...] "species", C. pethericki, has later been largely considered as a misinterpretation of the physiological changes undergone by very large male crocodiles. However, Wells and Wellington's assertion that the Australian saltwater crocodiles may at least be distinctive enough from northern Asian saltwater crocodiles to warrant subspecies status, as could raninus from other Asian saltwater crocodiles, has been considered to possibly bear validity.|$|R
50|$|Of special {{relevance}} {{in regard to}} its phytosaurian identity {{is the fact that}} the tracks are positioned in a way that indicates that the limbs were held directly under the body, a gait known in <b>true</b> archosaurs like <b>crocodiles</b> and dinosaurs but previously thought absent in phytosaurs. This raises the question of whereas this trait was shared by the last common ancestor between archosaurs and phytosaurs or if it evolved independently between these groups.|$|R

50|$|The Crocodylidae {{family of}} crocodylians {{includes}} the <b>true</b> <b>crocodiles</b> {{which are the}} members of the subfamily Crocodylinae and the Tomistoma genus. Currently, the family includes two subfamilies, Crocodylinae and Tomistominae, with the latter being a subject of controversy whether it is a crocodile or belongs to the family Gavialidae. Further genetic analysis has to be done to come to a final conclusion.|$|E
50|$|They were slender, {{medium-sized}} (about 1.5 meters long), long-snouted and superficially crocodile-like animals, {{although they}} lacked the armoured scutes of <b>true</b> <b>crocodiles,</b> and their skeletal features {{are much more}} primitive. The limbs are short and indicate a sprawling posture, like contemporary lizards but unlike most later archosaurs. Their most characteristic feature is a distinct down-turning of the premaxilla (the front of the upper jaw, which overhangs the lower jaw).|$|E
50|$|The Early Jurassic Epoch spans from 200 {{million years}} to 175 million years. The climate {{was much more}} humid than the Triassic, and as a result, the world was very tropical. In the oceans, plesiosaurs, ichthyosaurs and ammonites dominanted the seas. On land, dinosaurs and other {{reptiles}} dominated the land, with species such as Dilophosaurus at the apex. The first <b>true</b> <b>crocodiles</b> evolved, pushing the large amphibians to near extinction. The reptiles rose to rule the world. Meanwhile, the first true mammals evolved, but never exceeded {{the height of a}} shrew.|$|E
40|$|Internationally, water {{resources}} are facing increasing pressure due to over-exploitation and pollution. Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) {{has been accepted}} internationally as a paradigm for integrative and sustainable management of {{water resources}}. However, in practice, the implementation and success of IWRM policies has been hampered {{by the lack of}} availability of integrative decision support tools, especially within the context of limited resources and observed data. This is <b>true</b> for the <b>Crocodile</b> River Catchment (CRC), located within the Mpumalanga Province of South Africa. The catchment has been experiencing a decline in water quality {{as a result of the}} point source input of a cocktail of pollutants, which are discharged from industrial and municipal wastewater treatment plants, as well as diffuse source runoff and return flows from the extensive areas of irrigated agriculture and mining sites. The decline in water quality has profound implications for a range of stakeholders across the catchment including increased treatment costs and reduced crop yields. The combination of deteriorating water quality and the lack of understanding of the relationships between water quantity and quality for determining compliance/non-compliance in the CRC have resulted in collaboration between stakeholders, willing to work in a participatory and transparent manner to create an Integrated Water Quality Management Plan (IWQMP). This project aimed to model water quality, (combined water quality and quantity), to facilitate the IWQMP aiding in the understanding of the relationship between water quantity and quality in the CRC. A relatively simple water quality model (WQSAM) was used that receives inputs from established water quantity systems models, and was designed to be a water quality decision support tool for South African catchments. The model was applied to the CRC, achieving acceptable simulations of total dissolved solids (used as a surrogate for salinity) and nutrients (including orthophosphates, nitrates +nitrites and ammonium) for historical conditions. Validation results revealed that there is little consistency within the catchment, attributed to the non-stationary nature of water quality at many of the sites in the CRC. The analyses of the results using a number of representations including, seasonal load distributions, load duration curves and load flow plots, confirmed that the WQSAM model was able to capture the variability of relationships between water quantity and quality, provided that simulated hydrology was sufficiently accurate. The outputs produced by WQSAM was seen as useful for the CRC, with the Inkomati-Usuthu Catchment Management Agency (IUCMA) planning to operationalise the model in 2015. The ability of WQSAM to simulate water quality in data scarce catchments, with constituents that are appropriate for the needs of water resource management within South Africa, is highly beneficial...|$|R
50|$|Unlike the gharial, {{the false}} gharial's snout {{broadens}} considerably towards {{the base and}} so is considerably more {{similar to those of}} <b>true</b> <b>crocodiles</b> than the gharial, whose osteology indicates a distinct lineage from all other living crocodilians. However, preliminary nuclear genetic sequences may indicate the gharial and false gharial had a shared ancestor at some point in prehistory. Other molecular studies have similarly indicated that it is the nearest relative (the sister taxon) of the gharial. Along with close fossil relatives, such as Maroccosuchus, it is thus increasingly classed in the family Gavialidae.|$|E
50|$|Pseudhesperosuchus {{is based}} on PVL 3830. This {{specimen}} consists of a skull and lower jaws, most of the vertebral column, the shoulder girdle, {{and parts of the}} arms and legs. The genus was named by José Bonaparte in 1969. The type species is P. jachaleri. The skull, though nearly complete, is poorly preserved, and some of its bones and sutures have been misidentified over the years. A 2002 phylogenetic analysis of sphenosuchians performed by James Clark and Hans-Dieter Sues found Pseudhesperosuchus to have an unresolved position along with several other sphenosuchians, neither closer to <b>true</b> <b>crocodiles</b> or to Sphenosuchus. The genus is sometimes misspelled Pseudohesperosuchus, as in Carroll (1988).|$|E
50|$|The Crocodilia (or Crocodylia) is {{an order}} of mostly large, predatory, semiaquatic reptiles, known as crocodilians. They first {{appeared}} 83.5 million {{years ago in the}} Late Cretaceous period (Campanian stage) and are the closest living relatives of birds, as the two groups are the only known survivors of the Archosauria. Members of the order's total group, the clade Pseudosuchia, appeared about 250 million years ago in the Early Triassic period, and diversified during the Mesozoic era. The order Crocodilia includes the <b>true</b> <b>crocodiles</b> (family Crocodylidae), the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), and the gharial and false gharial (family Gavialidae). Although the term 'crocodiles' is sometimes used to refer to all of these, crocodilians is a less ambiguous vernacular term for members of this group.|$|E
50|$|Nile {{crocodiles}} {{may be able}} {{to tolerate}} an extremely broad range of habitat types, including small brackish streams, fast flowing rivers, swamps, dams and tidal lakes and estuaries. In East Africa, they are found mostly in rivers, lakes, marshes, and dams, favoring open, broad bodies of water over smaller ones. In Madagascar, the remnant population of Nile crocodiles has adapted to living within caves. Although not a regular sea-going species as is the American crocodile and, especially, the saltwater crocodile, the Nile crocodile possesses salt glands like all <b>true</b> <b>crocodiles</b> (but not alligators and caimans) and does on occasion enter coastal and even marine waters. They have been known to enter the sea in some areas, with one specimen having been recorded 11 km off St. Lucia Bay in 1917.|$|E
5000|$|Gauthier and Padian (1985) and Gauthier (1986) {{became the}} first to {{establish}} the name Pseudosuchia in a phylogenetic context, {{using it as a}} branch-based taxon for all archosaurs more closely related to crocodilians than to birds. This made the name Pseudosuchia somewhat ironic, because <b>true</b> <b>crocodiles</b> (i.e. members of Crocodylia) were now included in the group. Phylogenetic definitions of Pseudosuchia include [...] "Crocodiles and all archosaurs closer to crocodiles than to birds" [...] (Gauthier and Padian), [...] "Extant crocodiles and all extinct archosaurs that are closer to crocodiles than they are to birds" [...] (Gauthier 1986), and more recently [...] "the most inclusive clade within Archosauria that includes Crocodylia but not Aves" [...] (Senter 2005). As a branch-based clade, Pseudosuchia is the sister taxon of another branch-based clade, the Avemetatarsalia. Avemetatarsalians are bird-line archosaurs, including pterosaurs and dinosaurs (the latter including birds).|$|E
50|$|Despite {{their great}} {{similarities}} in appearance and lifestyle, {{there are still}} a number of minor differences that distinguish phytosaurs from <b>true</b> <b>crocodiles.</b> For one thing, the phytosaur ankle structure is much more primitive than that of any crocodile. Also, phytosaurs lack the bony secondary palate that enables crocodiles to breathe even when the mouth has much water. However, it is possible that phytosaurs had a fleshy palate, as many Mesozoic crocodiles are presumed to have had. Phytosaurs were even better armoured than crocodiles, protected by heavy bony scutes (often found as fossils), and the belly reinforced with a dense arrangement of gastralia (abdominal ribs). Finally, and most noticeably, phytosaurs had nostrils placed near or above the level of the eyes, in contrast to crocodiles where the nostrils are {{near the end of the}} snout. This adaptation may have developed to allow them to breathe while the rest of the body was submerged.|$|E
50|$|The Early Jurassic spans from 200 {{million years}} to 175 million years ago. The climate {{was much more}} humid than the Triassic, and as a result, the world was very tropical. In the oceans, plesiosaurs, ichthyosaurs and ammonites were abundant. On land, dinosaurs and other archosaurs stake their claim as the {{dominant}} race of the land, with species such as Dilophosaurus at the top. The first <b>true</b> <b>crocodiles</b> evolved, pushing out the large amphibians to near extinction. All-in-all, archosaurs rise to rule the world. Meanwhile, the first true mammals evolve, remaining relatively small sized but otherwise expanding ecologically; the Jurassic Castorocauda, for example, had adaptations for swimming, digging and catching fish. Fruitafossor, from the late Jurassic period about 150 million years ago, was {{about the size of}} a chipmunk and its teeth, forelimbs and back suggest that it broke open the nest of social insects to prey on them (probably termites, as ants had not yet appeared). The first multituberculates like Rugosodon evolve, while volaticotherians take to the skies.|$|E
50|$|The {{mouths of}} Nile {{crocodiles}} {{are filled with}} 64 to 68 sharply pointed, cone-shaped teeth (about a dozen less than alligators have). For most of a crocodile's life, broken teeth can be replaced. On {{each side of the}} mouth, there are five teeth {{in the front of the}} upper jaw (premaxilla), 13 or 14 in the rest of the upper jaw (maxilla), and 14 or 15 on either side of the lower jaw (mandible). The enlarged 4th lower tooth fits into the socket on the upper jaw and is visible when the jaws are closed, as is the case with all <b>true</b> <b>crocodiles.</b> Hatchlings quickly lose a hardened piece of skin on the top of their mouths called the egg tooth, which they use to break through their eggshells at birth. Among crocodilians, the Nile Crocodile possesses a relatively long snout, which is approximately 1.6 to 2 times as long as broad at the level of the front corners of the eyes. As is the saltwater crocodile, the Nile crocodile is considered a species with medium-width snout relative to other extant crocodilian species.|$|E
5000|$|Kayentasuchus {{was named}} in 2002 by Clark and Hans-Dieter Sues. The type species is K. walkeri {{in memory of}} Alick Walker, a {{well-known}} paleontologist. Most parts of the skeleton are represented, but are fragmentary, and only the skull, lower jaw, pelvis, thigh bone, and bony scutes received detailed description. Kayentasuchus had a tall, narrow snout and a flattened [...] "skull table" [...] {{at the back of}} the skull as in more derived crocodyliforms. The lower jaw was slender at the tip and curved upward. The teeth were nearly conical, but had distinct unserrated anterior and posterior edges. Each side of the tip of the upper jaw had four teeth, while the maxillae (main tooth-bearing bone of the upper jaw) and dentaries (tooth-bearing bone of the lower jaw) had twelve or thirteen each. The thigh bones were slender, and there were bony scutes on both the back and belly. The scutes on the upper surface were arranged in two rows running the length of the animal. Clark and Sues performed a phylogenetic analysis and found Kayentasuchus to have an unresolved position along with several other sphenosuchians, neither closer to <b>true</b> <b>crocodiles</b> or to Sphenosuchus.|$|E
50|$|The {{bite force}} exerted {{by an adult}} Nile {{crocodile}} has been shown by Dr. Brady Barr to measure 5000 lbf kN. However, the muscles responsible for opening the mouth are exceptionally weak, allowing a person to easily hold them shut {{with a small amount}} of force or to use duct-tape to adhere the jaws together even in large crocodiles. The broadest snouted modern crocodilians are alligators and larger caimans. For example, a 3.9 m black caiman (Melanosuchus niger) was found to have skull that was notably broader and heavier than that of a Nile crocodile measuring 4.8 m. However, despite their robust skulls, alligators and caimans appear to be proportionately equal in biting force to <b>true</b> <b>crocodiles</b> as the muscular tendons used to shut the jaws are similar in proportional size. Only the gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) (and perhaps some of the few very thin-snouted crocodilians) is likely to have noticeably diminished bite force compared to other living species due to its exceptionally narrow, fragile snout. More or less, the size of the tendons used to impart bite force increases with body size and the larger the crocodilian gets, the stronger its bite is likely to be. Therefore, a very large male saltwater crocodile, which had attained a length of approximately 4.59 m, was found to have the most powerful biting force ever tested in a lab setting for any type of animal.|$|E
