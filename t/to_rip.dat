5|$|June 12, 2001– Subtropical Depression Allison {{moves through}} Alabama and Georgia, with its outer rainbands {{producing}} up to 10.1inches (357mm) of rain at the Tallahassee Regional Airport. The rainfall destroys 10homes and damages 599others, with monetary damage totaling $20million (2001USD, $27.3million 2017USD). Eight people {{die in the}} state, five of which due <b>to</b> <b>rip</b> currents.|$|E
5|$|Constructed in Canada, a 'runway plough', {{assembled}} in Scotland, survives at Eglinton Country Park. It {{was purchased by}} the army in World War II <b>to</b> <b>rip</b> up aerodrome runways and railway lines if an invasion took place as means of causing disruption, making them useless to the occupying forces. It was used at the old Eglinton Estate, which had been commandeered by the army, to provide its army operators with the necessary experience. It was hauled by a powerful Foden Trucks tractor, possibly via a pulley and cable system.|$|E

30|$|When exfoliated {{graphite}} {{was subjected}} to ultrasonication, it induced acoustic cavitations near the expansive surface [3]. Localized erosion that leads <b>to</b> <b>ripping</b> or shearing of the platelets was then created. Graphene nanosheets appeared due <b>to</b> those <b>ripping</b> and shearing and also to the inertial cavitations caused by the violent collapse of a bubble.|$|R
5|$|Finn and Jake race to Bubblegum's {{castle and}} find her {{tied to a}} chair, with Ricardio about <b>to</b> <b>rip</b> her heart out. Finn and Jake then fight Ricardio and manage to beat him up. The Ice King crawls into the castle and places Ricardio back into his chest. Later during dinner, Bubblegum tells Finn {{that he does not}} need to be jealous anymore, but Finn denies that he was jealous in the first place.|$|E
5|$|Other highly {{specialized}} feeders include cookiecutter sharks, which feed on flesh sliced out of other larger fish and marine mammals. Cookiecutter teeth are enormous {{compared to the}} animal's size. The lower teeth are particularly sharp. Although {{they have never been}} observed feeding, they are believed to latch onto their prey and use their thick lips to make a seal, twisting their bodies <b>to</b> <b>rip</b> off flesh.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the prior}} three {{films in the}} series, the U.S. rating was PG-13 rather than R. An unrated version {{contained}} more strong profanity and violence not shown in the theatrical version, and {{was included in the}} DVD release. For the DVD release, 20th Century Fox pioneered a new kind of DRM, Digital Copy protection that tries to weaken the incentives for consumers to learn how <b>to</b> <b>rip</b> discs by offering them a downloadable version with studio-imposed restrictions. The score for the film was released on July 2, 2007. The fifth film in the series, titled A Good Day to Die Hard, was released on February 14, 2013.|$|E
5000|$|Reviewing Channel 4's launch {{night for}} the Financial Times, Chris Dunkley wrote {{that it was a}} [...] "deliciously {{accurate}} parody of Enid Blyton's mind-numbingly repetitive adventure stories", but compared it unfavourably <b>to</b> <b>Ripping</b> Yarns.|$|R

5|$|Aeron's main {{weapon is}} the Oraclos Chain, an {{artifact}} {{that can be}} used in multiple ways: it can tie up enemies, bind enemies together so they share damage taken when Aeron attacks, and swing them around Aeron to deal damage. The Chain can also be used <b>to</b> <b>rip</b> armor or materials from enemies. The Chain's attack power increases the longer it is pulled when attached to an enemy. In addition to the Oraclos Chain, Aeron has access to multiple subweapons, such as a sword. Puzzles within the Towers include activating levers and switches, manipulating platforms, triggering special mechanisms unique to each Tower environment, and climbing along walls and beams to reach other areas within the Towers. The Chain is essential to these puzzles, being used as a grappling hook and a rope from which Aeron can swing from one platform to another. Elements within the Towers, such as what enemies are active and what items may be found, vary with the time of day Aeron visits them.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the caps}} {{are covered by}} a peridium—an outer {{covering}} layer of tissue. After the fruit body matures and begins to dry out, {{the lower part of}} the peridium starts <b>to</b> <b>rip,</b> usually starting from small longitudinal slits near where the peridium attaches to the top of the stem. However, the pattern of tearing is variable; in some instances, the slits may appear higher up on the peridium, in others, the peridium rips more irregularly. The peridium may also rip in such a way that it appears as if there is a ring at the top of the stem. The torn peridium exposes the internal gleba. The gleba is divided into wavy plates or lamellae, some of which are fused together to form irregular chambers. The gleba is a drab brown to blackish-brown color, and it becomes tough and brittle as it dries out. The flesh is firm when young, white, and will stain light to bright yellow when it is bruised.|$|E
5|$|The game {{takes place}} across {{a variety of}} levels, many of which require certain {{objectives}} to be performed to progress. Sir Daniel Fortesque can use a variety of weapons, consisting of close range weapons such as swords and clubs to long range weapons such as crossbows. Many can be charged for a powerful attack and some, such as the club, can be used to access areas that are otherwise inaccessible. When not possessing any items, Dan is able <b>to</b> <b>rip</b> his arm off and use it for both melee and ranged attacks. Dan can equip a shield alongside weapons for defence; though they have limited strength before breaking. Throughout the game, Dan can visit gargoyle heads of two varieties: green ones offer Dan information while blue ones allow Dan to buy services or ammunition by using the treasures he finds.|$|E
50|$|Skeets {{recruits}} Booster's ancestor, Daniel, a {{week later}} in order to regain access <b>to</b> <b>Rip's</b> lab. Skeets leaves Daniel trapped in a repeating time loop after Daniel uncovers the scrawled notes, which indicate that Skeets {{is responsible for the}} changes in time. Skeets later stages an invasion of Metropolis in order <b>to</b> draw out <b>Rip</b> Hunter, which results in the slaughter of several civilians and amateur superheroes. When Firestorm's new Justice League try to stop him, Skeets kills the new Super-Chief and escapes. Skeets then tortures Waverider and dispatches the Time Commander in order <b>to</b> discover <b>Rip's</b> location, while implying that Waverider's metal skin was melted down in order to construct Skeets itself.|$|R

50|$|Whatipu has no surf patrol, and as {{with all}} the beaches west of Auckland, {{swimming}} may not be safe due <b>to</b> <b>rips.</b> HMS Orpheus ran aground just inside the Manukau Harbour entrance south of Whatipu in 1863 {{with the loss of}} 189 lives. It was the biggest shipping disaster in New Zealand history.|$|R
5|$|Thomas Hale Streets {{discussed}} the behaviour in 1877, doubting {{that the animal}} would climb trees {{to get at the}} coconuts. In the 1980s, Holger Rumpf was able to confirm Streets' report, observing and studying how they open coconuts in the wild. The animal has developed a special technique to do so: if the coconut is still covered with husk, it will use its claws <b>to</b> <b>rip</b> off strips, always starting from the side with the three germination pores, the group of three small circles found {{on the outside of the}} coconut. Once the pores are visible, the coconut crab will bang its pincers on one of them until they break. Afterwards, it will turn around and use the smaller pincers on its other legs to pull out the white flesh of the coconut. Using their strong claws, larger individuals can even break the hard coconut into smaller pieces for easier consumption.|$|E
5|$|At 21:00, the British {{observed}} a {{fire on the}} lower decks of the Orient, the French flagship. Identifying the danger this posed to the Orient, Captain Hallowell directed his gun crews to fire their guns directly into the blaze. Sustained British gun fire spread the flames throughout the ship's stern and prevented all efforts to extinguish them. Within minutes the fire had ascended the rigging and set the vast sails alight. The nearest British ships, Swiftsure, Alexander, and Orion, all stopped firing, closed their gunports, and began edging away from the burning ship {{in anticipation of the}} detonation of the enormous ammunition supplies stored on board. In addition, they took crews away from the guns to form fire parties and to soak the sails and decks in seawater to help contain any resulting fires. Likewise the French ships Tonnant, Heureux, and Mercure all cut their anchor cables and drifted southwards away from the burning ship. At 22:00 the fire reached the magazines, and the Orient was destroyed by a massive explosion. The concussion of the blast was powerful enough <b>to</b> <b>rip</b> open the seams of the nearest ships, and flaming wreckage landed in a huge circle, much of it flying directly over the surrounding ships into the sea beyond. Falling wreckage started fires on Swiftsure, Alexander, and Franklin, although in each case teams of sailors with water buckets succeeded in extinguishing the flames, despite a secondary explosion on Franklin.|$|E

25|$|Outfeed tables: Table saws {{are often}} used <b>to</b> <b>rip</b> long boards or sheets of plywood or other sheet materials. The use of an out feed (or outfeed) table makes this process safer and easier. Many of these are shop built, while others are commercially available.|$|E
25|$|Portables - Portable applications: Similar <b>to</b> <b>RIPs,</b> but in {{this case}} they're {{software}} applications instead of video games. The point of portable software {{is the fact that it}} can be placed on removable media (or any place on the local hard drive) and doesn't need installing; usually it is compressed into one executable file, by using software like VMware ThinApp or MoleBox.|$|R
2500|$|Cyberskin is a {{synthetic}} material that {{feels more like}} human skin. It is a porous material and cannot be sterilized. It often gets sticky after washing (which can be remedied by a dusting of cornstarch) and is more delicate and more prone <b>to</b> <b>rips</b> and tears than silicone dildos. [...] "Packing dildos", which are not designed for penetration, are often made of this material.|$|R
50|$|The beaches {{are typical}} of west coast beaches north of Taranaki {{in that they are}} all black sand beaches. They have a {{reputation}} of being dangerous for swimmers due <b>to</b> <b>rips</b> and large swells. Surf Life Saving Clubs patrol designated areas of the four most popular beaches during the summer months. Piha Surf Life Saving Club is the oldest of these, being founded in 1934.|$|R

He did not face any legal repercussions from the incident.|$|E
25|$|Butkus {{recovered}} 27 fumbles in his career, an NFL {{record at}} the time of his retirement. One of his greatest strengths was his ability <b>to</b> <b>rip</b> the ball from a ball carrier's hands. Although back then the statistic was not kept, it has been noted that Butkus would certainly be one of the all-time leaders in the forced fumbles category.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{activities}} in the market have strongly been criticized by {{a good number of}} people across the country, who have painfully experiences the loss of money and prized gadgets to the schemes of unqualified engineers and fraudsters, who use the chaotic market as a medium <b>to</b> <b>rip</b> off people or sell counterfeit products and services, such as mobile phones, software, accessories, etc.|$|E
50|$|Lace front wigs {{are more}} common and the {{remainder}} of the wig is made out of a less fragile material which is less susceptible <b>to</b> <b>ripping</b> or tearing than the lace.
