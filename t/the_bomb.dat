5|$|Although Project Alberta had no attack orders, it {{proceeded}} {{with the plan}} to have the Little Boy ready by 1 August 1945 and the first Fat Man ready for use {{as soon as possible}} after that. In the meantime, a series of twelve combat missions were flown between 20 and 29 July against targets in Japan using high-explosive Pumpkin bombs. Project Alberta's Sheldon Dike and Milo Bolstead flew on some of these missions, as did the British observer Group Captain Leonard Cheshire. One serious incident occurred when a Pumpkin bomb was released in <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> bay of the B-29 Strange Cargo while it was taxiing. <b>The</b> <b>bomb</b> fell through the closed bomb bay doors onto the taxiway. The plane came to a halt in a shower of sparks, but fire fighters doused the plane and <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> in foam, and <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> did not explode. The aircraft had to be jacked up to remove <b>the</b> <b>bomb.</b>|$|E
5|$|Behind Camp Square, <b>The</b> <b>Bomb</b> Hole {{was created}} when a World War 2 bomb was {{dropped on the}} site, {{creating}} a small crater. <b>The</b> <b>Bomb</b> Hole has been extended several times, and is now used for kayaking, raft building and pond dipping activity sessions.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>bombing</b> led to <b>the</b> {{suspension}} of evacuations for several days; they resumed on 19 April with tight {{security at the}} Rashideen checkpoint. Three days after <b>the</b> <b>bombing,</b> a United Nations spokesperson said that <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> was [...] "likely a war crime" [...] and {{a person of interest}} seen in footage prior to <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> is being investigated.|$|R
50|$|Another theory {{alleged that}} President Bill Clinton had either known about <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> in advance or had {{approved}} <b>the</b> <b>bombing.</b> It is {{also believed that}} <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> {{was done by the}} government to frame the militia movement or enact antiterrorism legislation while using McVeigh as a scapegoat. Still other theories claim that McVeigh conspired with the CIA in plotting <b>the</b> <b>bombing.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1940, {{during the}} Second World War, the Gwladys Street Stand {{suffered}} bomb damage. <b>The</b> <b>bomb</b> had landed directly in Gwladys Street and caused serious injury to nearby residents. <b>The</b> <b>bomb</b> splinter {{damage to the}} bricks on the stand is still noticeable. The cost of repair was £5,000 and was {{paid for by the}} War Damage Commission.|$|E
5|$|On July 20, 1944, Stauffenberg and his {{adjutant}} Lieutenant Haeften {{return to}} Wolf's Lair. To Stauffenberg's dismay, he discovers {{only after the}} timer has been activated that, due to the warm weather, the conference {{is being held in}} an open-window summer barrack, whereas the plotters had intended to detonate <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> within the walls of the bunker for maximum damage. While his adjutant waits with the car, Stauffenberg places the briefcase with <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> armed at the meeting as close to Hitler as possible. Stauffenberg then leaves the barrack, returning to the car. However, one of the officers at the meeting moves <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> behind a table leg, which will inadvertently protect Hitler from most of the blast. When <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> explodes, Stauffenberg is certain that Hitler is dead and flees Wolf's Lair. Before shutting down communications, Fellgiebel calls Mertz about the explosion but cannot clearly convey whether or not Hitler is dead.|$|E

50|$|There exists {{considerable}} historical {{controversy about}} {{the ethics of}} large-scale firebombing attacks against German cities {{during the last few}} months of the war, such as <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> of Dresden, <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> of Pforzheim, <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> of Heilbronn, and other German cities.|$|R

5|$|Ros and Connie {{find the}} locker with the bomber's name and location, Grosvenor Square. An FSB sniper kills Crane, and at Connie's request, <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> {{is sent to}} her, as {{she is the only}} person with the {{expertise}} to disarm it. Connie defuses <b>the</b> <b>bomb,</b> but by doing so a secondary countdown is initiated. She removes the nuclear material, but <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> will still detonate. In her last words, Connie admits that she set up Lucas in Moscow eight years ago, which resulted in his imprisonment. Lucas and Ros then run to safety as <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> detonates, killing Connie. With disaster averted, Lucas calls Harry, but receives no answer. In the end, it is revealed Sarkisiian has him locked up in the boot of his car.|$|E
5|$|The IRA {{had sent}} telephoned {{warnings}} about 90 minutes before <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> detonated. At least 75,000 people were evacuated from the area, but <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> squad {{were unable to}} defuse <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> in time. More than 200 people were injured {{but there were no}} fatalities despite the strength of <b>the</b> <b>bomb,</b> which has been largely credited to the fast response of emergency services. At the time, England was hosting the Euro '96 football championships and a Russia vs Germany match was to take place in Manchester the following day.|$|E
5|$|The first {{policeman}} {{to arrive}} on the scene noticed wires running from the van's dashboard through a hole into the back and {{reported that he had}} found <b>the</b> <b>bomb.</b> Forensic experts later estimated that <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> weighed 1,500–1,600 kg (3,300–3,500 lb) and was a mixture of semtex, a military-grade plastic explosive, and ammonium nitrate fertiliser, a cheap and easily obtainable explosive used extensively by the IRA. Components of what may have been a tremble trigger were also found later, designed to detonate <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> if it was tampered with.|$|E

50|$|The U.S. firebombed Tokyo on {{the night}} of March 9-10, 1945, and killed more than 100,000 people in <b>the</b> deadliest {{conventional}} <b>bombing</b> in history, known to the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) as Operation Meetinghouse. In a few hours, 100,000 people who were in Tokyo including civilians died either by <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> or <b>the</b> conflagration that followed <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> by 325 U.S. B-29's night attacks. The fleet included 279 bombers. <b>The</b> <b>bombing</b> was meant to burn wooden buildings and indeed <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> caused fire that created a 50 m/s wind that is comparable to tornadoes. A total of 381,300 bombs amounting to 1783 tons, were used in <b>the</b> <b>bombing.</b>|$|R
50|$|Operation Freedom Deal {{followed}} and expanded <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> of Cambodia conducted under Operation Menu in 1969 and 1970. Most of <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> {{was carried out}} by U.S. Air Force B-52 heavy bombers. The effectiveness of <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> and <b>the</b> number of civilians killed by U.S. bombing is in dispute.|$|R
5|$|While admitting {{none of the}} {{defendants}} {{were involved in the}} bombing, the prosecution made the argument that Lingg had built <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> and two prosecution witnesses (Harry Gilmer and Malvern Thompson) tried to imply <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> thrower was helped by Spies, Fischer and Schwab. The defendants claimed they had no knowledge of the bomber at all.|$|E
5|$|A timer {{ensured that}} <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> would not explode {{until at least}} fifteen seconds after release, one-quarter of the {{predicted}} fall time, to ensure safety of the aircraft. The timer was activated when the electrical pull-out plugs connecting it to the airplane pulled loose as <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> fell, switching it to internal (24V battery) power and starting the timer. At {{the end of the}} 15 seconds, the radar altimeters were powered up and responsibility was passed to the barometric stage.|$|E
5|$|At the Potsdam Conference in Germany, Truman was {{informed}} that the Trinity test had been successful. He told Stalin, {{the leader of the}} Soviet Union, that the US had a new superweapon, without giving any details. This was the first official communication to the Soviet Union about <b>the</b> <b>bomb,</b> but Stalin already knew about it from spies. With the authorization to use <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> against Japan already given, no alternatives were considered after the Japanese rejection of the Potsdam Declaration.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bombing</b> harmed Sinn Féin's electoral support. In 1989, in {{the first}} local {{elections}} held in County Fermanagh after <b>the</b> <b>bombing,</b> Sinn Féin lost four of its eight council seats and was overtaken by the SDLP as the biggest Irish nationalist party. It was not until 2001, fourteen years after <b>the</b> <b>bombing,</b> that Sinn Féin support returned to its 1985 level. In 1997, Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams apologised for <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> {{on behalf of the}} republican movement.|$|R
5000|$|The initial {{death toll}} {{directly}} due to <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> had been [...] "limited", but the fire caused by <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> trapped people in shopping centres, which lacked any emergency exits. <b>The</b> <b>bombing</b> {{killed at least}} 324 people and injured at least 223. Unconfirmed reports state that <b>the</b> car <b>bombs</b> may have passed checkpoints where Iraqi security forces still use fake bomb detectors such as the ADE 651.|$|R
2500|$|The Egyptian {{government}} {{issued a}} statement immediately following <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> blaming [...] "foreign elements" [...] for the planning and execution of <b>the</b> <b>bombing.</b>|$|R
5|$|Between {{the forward}} and rear {{bulkhead}} was <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> bay, which was constructed with a double-frame to strengthen it for carrying <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> load. The space between <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> bay and rear bulkhead was used up by Funkgerät radio equipment and contained the dorsal and flexible casemate ventral gunner positions. The rear bulkhead contained a hatch which allowed access {{into the rest}} of the fuselage which was held together by a series of stringers. The wing was a two spar design. The fuselage was formed of stringers to which the fuselage skin was riveted. Internally the frames were fixed only to the stringers, which made for simpler construction at the cost of some rigidity.|$|E
5|$|Clearly, {{some sort}} of {{flexible}} bag was required to contain an explosive gel so {{that it did not}} matter how <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> landed on the target. However, a flexible bag is hard to throw and trials had not been at all satisfactory. Discussions of the problem in Macrae's office were overheard by Gordon Norwood, a master printer who Macrae had recruited from his former magazine publishing employer, but he was not directly working on the weapon. Norwood suggested that what was needed was a frangible container and to the annoyance of the War Office store keeper he obtained a 150 W light bulb with which to demonstrate his point: a spherical glass flask inside a sock of woven wool is rigid when thrown, but on contact the glass breaks and <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> deforms to the required shape. Experiments with glass flasks filled with cold porridge confirmed that this was the way to go. The grenade needed a delay for the thrower to get clear, so the woollen sock was covered in a sticky substance ensuring that <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> stayed in place for a few seconds before detonating. Having covered <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> in glue, a non-sticky handle was required. In the handle, a delay fuse was ignited by releasing a sprung lever so that a five second time delay starts as the grenade leaves the thrower's hand (just like the levers found on a conventional Mills bomb type hand grenade).|$|E
5|$|Cochran and Nixon are {{assigned}} to accompany the crew transporting <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> to Tinian. While assembling <b>the</b> <b>bomb,</b> the scientist comes into contact with radioactive material and dies. The following day, on August 6, 1945, the Enola Gay, a Boeing B-29 Superfortress bomber, drops an atomic bomb on Hiroshima. After the mission, Nixon returns home {{to break the news}} of her husband's death to Cochran's wife.|$|E

5|$|Doug and Claire {{go to the}} ferry. Doug {{boards to}} try to find and disarm <b>the</b> <b>bomb,</b> but {{meanwhile}} Oerstadt has found Claire and bound her in <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> car. A brutal gunfight ensues which culminates with Doug attempting to negotiate with Oerstadt but finally catching him off guard and killing him. He gets into the car to try to free Claire but police surround the vehicle and threaten to open fire. To save everyone, Doug and Claire purposely drive <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> SUV off the end of the ferry before it explodes. Claire escapes but Doug, unable {{to get out of the}} vehicle, dies in the underwater explosion. As Claire mourns Doug's death, she is approached by an identical Doug Carlin, the one from her present, who consoles her.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{limitations}} of the Mark III Fat Man, a nuclear strike would have been a formidable undertaking in the post-war 1940s. The lead-acid batteries that powered the fuzing system remained charged for only 36 hours, after which they needed to be recharged. To do this meant disassembling <b>the</b> <b>bomb,</b> and recharging took 72 hours. The batteries had to be removed in any case after nine days or they corroded. The plutonium core could not be left in for much longer, because its heat damaged the high explosives. Replacing the core also required <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> to be completely disassembled and reassembled. This required about 40 to 50 men and took between 56 and 72 hours, depending on the skill of <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> assembly team, and in June 1948 the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project had only three teams. The only aircraft capable of carrying <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> were Silverplate B-29s, and the only group equipped with them was the 509th Bombardment Group at Walker Air Force Base in Roswell, New Mexico. They would first have to fly to Sandia Base to collect the bombs, and then to an overseas base from which a strike could be mounted.|$|E

50|$|Shortly after <b>the</b> <b>bombing,</b> PKK/KCK {{declared}} a ceasefire {{in order to}} ensure that a peaceful election would be held on 1 November, which was reportedly already being planned before <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> took place.
