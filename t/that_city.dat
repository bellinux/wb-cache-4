40|$|The {{fragmentation}} of urban landscapes: global {{evidence of a}} key attribute of the spatial structure of cities, 1990 − 2000 SHLOMO ANGEL, JASON PARENT AND DANIEL L CIVCO ABSTRACT The {{fragmentation of}} urban landscapes − or the inter-penetration of the built-up areas of cities and the open spaces in and around them − is a key attribute of their spatial structure. Analyzing satellite images for 1990 and 2000 for a global sample of 120 <b>cities,</b> we find <b>that</b> <b>cities</b> typically contain or disturb vast quantities of open spaces equal in area, on average, to their built-up areas. We also find that fragmentation, defined as the relative share of open space in the urban landscape, is now in decline. Using multiple regression models, we find <b>that</b> larger <b>cities</b> are less fragmented, <b>that</b> higher-income <b>cities</b> are more fragmented, <b>that</b> <b>cities</b> {{with higher levels of}} car ownership are less fragmented, and <b>that</b> <b>cities</b> <b>that</b> constrain urban development are less fragmented. We recommend that making room for urban expansion in rapidly growing cities should take into account their expected fragmentation levels...|$|R
