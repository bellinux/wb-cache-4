Power steering can also be engineered to provide some artificial feedback of forces acting on <b>the</b> <b>steered</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|E

50|$|Many modern cars use {{rack and}} pinion {{steering}} mechanisms, where the steering wheel turns the pinion gear; the pinion moves the rack, which is a linear gear that meshes with the pinion, converting circular motion into linear motion along the transverse axis of the car (side to side motion). This motion applies steering torque to the swivel pin ball joints that replaced previously used kingpins of the stub axle of <b>the</b> <b>steered</b> <b>wheels</b> via tie rods and a short lever arm called the steering arm.|$|E

50|$|In {{the most}} common {{arrangement}} of the Geneva drive, the client wheel has four slots and thus advances the drive by {{one step at a}} time (each step being 90 degrees) for each full rotation of the master <b>wheel.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>steered</b> <b>wheel</b> has n slots, it advances by 360°/n per full rotation of the propeller wheel.|$|R
50|$|Earlier HICAS {{versions}} used hydraulics to <b>steer</b> <b>the</b> rear <b>wheels.</b> The {{hydraulic system}} was {{powered by the}} power steering pump and used speed sensors {{to determine how much}} and in which direction to <b>steer</b> <b>the</b> rear <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|As <b>the</b> <b>steered</b> <b>wheels</b> {{are also}} the driven wheels, FF (front-engine, {{front-wheel-drive}} layout) cars are generally considered superior to FR (front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout) cars in conditions such as snow, mud, or wet tarmac. The weight of the engine over the driven wheels also improves grip in such conditions. However, powerful cars rarely use the FF layout because weight transference under acceleration reduces the weight on the front wheels and reduces their traction, limiting the torque which can be utilized. Electronic traction control can avoid wheelspin but largely negates the benefit of extra torque/power.|$|E
5000|$|In {{contrast}} with the front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout (RWD), the FWD layout {{eliminates the need for}} a central tunnel or a higher chassis clearance to accommodate a driveshaft providing power to the rear wheels. Like the rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout (RR) and rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout (RMR) layouts, it places the engine over the drive wheels, improving traction in many applications. As <b>the</b> <b>steered</b> <b>wheels</b> are also the driven wheels, FWD cars are generally considered superior to RWD cars in conditions where there is low traction such as snow, mud, gravel or wet tarmac. When hill climbing in low traction conditions RR is considered the best two-wheel-drive layout, primarily due to the shift of weight to the rear wheels when climbing. The cornering ability of a FWD vehicle is generally better, because the engine is placed over <b>the</b> <b>steered</b> <b>wheels.</b> However, as the driven wheels have the additional demands of steering, if a vehicle accelerates quickly, less grip is available for cornering, which can result in understeer. [...] High-performance vehicles rarely use the FWD layout because weight is transferred to the rear wheels under acceleration, while unloading the front wheels and sharply reducing their grip, effectively putting a cap on the amount of power which could realistically be utilized; in addition, the high horsepower of high-performance cars can result in the sensation of torque steer. Electronic traction control can avoid wheel-spin but largely negates the benefit of extra power. [...] This was a reason for the adoption of the four-wheel-drive quattro system in the high performance Jensen FF and Audi Quattro road cars.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>steered</b> <b>wheels</b> on a velomobile {{will hit}} the fairing if steered sharply enough. Making the fairing wider can give space to steer the wheels more sharply, but has down-sides for {{aerodynamics}} and width. Although sharp steering is not needed at speed, many aerodynamic velomobiles have a much worse turning circle than an equivalent unfaired cycle. In contrast an unfaired cycle cannot have fairing interference, and so even with the same wheel and rider configuration can steer a much tighter circle. Steering only the rear wheel(s) would avoid fairing interference, {{but it is hard}} to build a stable vehicle using only rear-wheel steering. The Velayo uses a tricycle configuration and steers only the rear wheel; but it was produced only in small numbers. The experimental Kingsbury Fortuna and Quattro velomobiles steered all wheels; this approach avoids some of the stability problems of rear-wheel steering while still reducing the steering angle of the front wheels. However, this approach has not (as of 2017) gained wider use in velomobiles.|$|E
50|$|This action puts {{strain on}} the rack and pinion, pump, tie rods, and bearings, {{especially}} causes undue wear to <b>the</b> <b>steer</b> <b>wheels,</b> and can be exceptionally difficult {{in the absence of}} power-assisted steering. Although in most modern cars the steering components are sturdy enough to handle dry steering without taking damage, it is still not recommended due to stronger tire wear. This is the reason automatic parking systems are usually designed not to dry steer, although their design would be somewhat simpler if they used dry steering.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{a control}} {{algorithm}} for improving vehicle handling {{has been proposed}} by applying correction angle to <b>the</b> <b>steered</b> <b>wheel,</b> based on <b>the</b> optimal and adaptive theory using Simulink MATLAB software. A 4 DOF model with nonlinear tire and SBW subsystem is presented using {{hardware in the loop}} method. Since some space variables cannot be measured, an estimator is used to extract the measurable variables from the simulated model and convert them to the required variables of the controller. These variables are transmitted to the controller and then it adopts itself with new conditions and applies the best modification on the steering. The results reveal that the proposed controller can significantly improve vehicle handling during severe maneuvers...|$|R

5000|$|Rather {{than the}} {{preceding}} [...] "turntable" [...] steering, where both front wheels turned around a common pivot, each wheel gained its own pivot, {{close to its}} own hub. While more complex, this arrangement enhances controllability by avoiding large inputs from road surface variations being applied {{to the end of}} a long lever arm, as well as greatly reducing the fore-and-aft travel of <b>the</b> <b>steered</b> <b>wheels.</b> A linkage between these hubs pivots the two wheels together, and by careful arrangement of the linkage dimensions the Ackermann geometry could be approximated. This was achieved by making the linkage not a simple parallelogram, but by making the length of the track rod (the moving link between the hubs) shorter than that of the axle, so that the steering arms of the hubs appeared to [...] "toe out". As the steering moved, the wheels turned according to Ackermann, with the inner wheel turning further. If the track rod is placed ahead of the axle, it should instead be longer in comparison, thus preserving this same [...] "toe out".|$|E
5000|$|The fairing on a velomobile {{sometimes}} {{makes it}} more subject to cross-winds than a similar unfaired cycle. The effect of cross-winds is complicated because {{the force of the}} wind can act as a steering force, as-if the rider had tried to steer the cycle. [...] "Wind steer" [...] can be a safety issue and may also hurt performance, as a serpentine path is longer and thus slower than a straight line. Thus, a design with inferior aerodynamics may be better overall. For example, it is common for time-trial bicycles to use a solid disk rear wheel for best aerodynamics, and a spoked front wheel that has worse aerodynamics than a disk, but is less likely to steer the bicycle in a cross-wind. Velomobile fairings have analogous concerns, leading to trade-offs in fairing design. For example, a longer [...] "tail" [...] on the fairing will increase the total side-wind profile and total side forces, but can reduce the percentage force acting on <b>the</b> <b>steered</b> <b>wheels</b> and so an improve stability in side winds. A larger fairing also hurts weight and has more skin drag), but as with time-trial bicycles, worse aerodynamics but better handling is sometimes a good trade-off.|$|E
50|$|With the DAF 600 - 55 each {{rear wheel}} was {{propelled}} individually {{by a pair}} of conical drums and drive belt with the effect of a limited slip differential: if a drive wheel on slippery road revs up, the other wheel can still transfer the full torque. This results in unusually good traction characteristics, which were also a reason for successes of the DAFs in rallies. There were several disadvantages that accompanied the lack of a true differential gear. Although each belt could settle (independent of the other) into its optimum position, thus allowing for wheel speed variation, the system was slow to operate and depended on the pulleys being turned. This led to rapid tire wear and placed stress on other transmission components. Snapped drive shafts were common. Low speed handling in icy conditions was interesting as the system tended to drive the car forward against the influence of <b>the</b> <b>steered</b> <b>wheels.</b> Later cars, the 46, 66 and Volvo variants were fitted with a differentially geared axle. A version with a differential was developed by Williams in the 1993 Williams FW15C CVT Formula One car, but it was banned before being raced. In testing there were problems with the heat production.|$|E

The technique originated in track cycling and is now used by other types of cyclists wishing to stop {{for a short time}} without putting a foot on the ground, such as bike commuters at stop signs. To perform a track stand, a cyclist holds the cranks in an approximately horizontal position with <b>the</b> front <b>wheel</b> <b>steered</b> to <b>the</b> left or right, and pedals forward, and back {{in the case of a}} fixed-gear bicycle, which <b>the</b> <b>steered</b> front <b>wheel</b> converts into a side-to-side motion.|$|R

40|$|A vehicle parking {{manoeuvre}} {{is characterized}} by low or zero speed, small turning radius and large yaw velocity of <b>the</b> <b>steered</b> <b>wheels.</b> To predict the forces and moments generated by a wheel under these conditions, the Pacejka Magic Formula model has been extended to incorporate the effect of spin (turn slip model) in the past years. The extensions have been further developed and incorporated in the MFTyre/MF-Swift 6. 2 model. This paper describes {{the development of a}} method for the identification of the turn slip parameters. Based on the operating conditions of a typical parking manoeuvre, the dominant parameters of the turn slip model are firstly defined. At an indoor test facility, the response of a tyre under the identified operating conditions is measured. An algorithm is developed to identify the dominant turn slip parameters from the measured responses. Wherever possible, the algorithm is based on direct analytical relationships between the turn slip model parameters and the measured signals, otherwise an iterative method is applied. By means of comparing vehicle simulation results to instrumented vehicle measurements, the turn slip model, including the identified parameters, is validated. The results show the effectiveness of the developed method...|$|E

40|$|Modern {{road vehicle}} {{suspension}} and steering systems may generally be classed as multi-loop spatial mechanisms, designed with links constrained and interconnected {{in such a}} manner as to attempt a preferred and prescribed motion of <b>the</b> <b>steered</b> <b>wheels</b> with regard to the inputs to the system. ' The mechanism incorporates elastic and damping elements and is terminated to the ground surface via the tyres. The complete system may be modelled as a multi-body system with spatial kinematics. This work demonstrates an analysis and simulation of the mechanics of a double wishbone/rack and pinion suspension and steering system modelled as a multi-body system. A 3 -dimensional Newton-Euler based approach employing vector and matrix notation is used in deriving the coupled set of non-linear equations of motion, and these together with the kinematic equations of constraint are cast in state space form, and numerical solutions sought using a digital computer. The kinematic equations are derived from the velocity loop equations for the model, and deal with the so-called redundant degrees-of-freedom arising in models of this type in a completely general manner. The tyre, shock absorber, main spring, and steering gear are modelled from empirical data. A feature of the work is that the complete set of equations need not be excessively manipulated manually, and that use of a set of specially written computer program routines allows a numerical formulation of the equations in the machine, enabling the main program to be written from inspection of the 'raw' equations. Large displacements and therefore changes of geometry are considered, with the provision for partial numerical linearization of the geometric aspects if required. The kinematic behaviour of the model is also described. A supporting experimental programme of work with a vehicle on a rolling drum rig has been conducted in parallel to the simulation work. And results indicate good correlation between theory and experiment at low frequencies of vibration...|$|E
40|$|By-wire" {{systems are}} {{characterized}} {{by the lack of}} mechanical link between the control device and the actuator, being it hydraulic or mechanical. The connection is replaced by a mechatronic system, equipped with redundant sensors and actuators [1]. SBW consists in two electro-mechanical actuators that steer the vehicle wheels and generate a resistance torque against the rotation of the steering wheel during cornering maneuvers. Each actuator is characterized by the presence of an electric motor, the first is connected to the pinion of the steering system, the other is connected to the steering wheel. The electric motor connected to the pinion is controlled in position and the command signal is generated by a PID controller. Reference position depends only on steering wheel angle and steering ratio. The torque control of the second electric motor is more difficult; the reference torque value has to be realistic in order to grant the proper feeling to the driver. The steering column is removed, as well as every hydraulic component {{that is part of the}} classic servo-assisted steering system. The logic that controls the system needs the information provided by two position sensors: one encoder is devoted to measure the steering wheel angular position, one linear position transducer measures the position of the rack [2]. The connection between the control units of the two sub-systems is realized through a communication bus. The aim of SBW technology is to completely remove as many mechanical components (steering shaft, column, gear reduction mechanism, etc.) as possible, thus simplifying the car interior design, increasing the driver safety in case of frontal crash. Moreover, active safety and handling are increased thanks to the variable ratio between steering wheel angle and tyres' steering angle, determined by a control logic [3]. SbW system's steering wheel has to generate a resistant torque which adds to the friction one. Such torque must be felt as natural by the average driver and carry information about vehicle dynamic condition. The paper describes the design of a SBW prototype, obtained from a classical steering system (see Fig. 13) [4] [5]. A Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) test bench is also described: it is realized in order to test feedback torque generation and steering wheel efficiency influence on vehicle behavior. Actual steering wheel angle is used as input for a ten degrees of freedom model that calculates the vehicle dynamics, defining <b>the</b> <b>steered</b> <b>wheels</b> motion and the resistance torque at the pinion (see Fig. 10). An analog signal is generated in order to control the steering wheel electric motor torque. Experimental tests are performed to optimize the feedback torque control. The reference torque is then calculated only using signals coming from vehicle on board sensors. Control logic is finally improved in order to stiffen the steering system unnaturally when lateral acceleration is about to reach adherence limit and prevent further steering action (see Fig. 14...|$|E

50|$|To {{improve the}} roll {{stability}} in transient conditions, the prototype CLEVER vehicle was fitted with an active steering system in 2012; this allowed {{the use of}} a combined Steering Direct Tilt Control (SDTC) strategy.
