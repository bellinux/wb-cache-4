Three {{minesweeping}} destroyers sailed ahead, followed by the cruisers Kenya, Manchester and two freighters. Charybdis and the destroyers Eskimo and Somali from Force Z were still some hours behind and Ashanti was steaming fast to overhaul the main body. Three destroyers remained with nine of the merchantmen and Bramham was en route after Deucalion had been sunk. The {{main part of the}} convoy was attacked at 00:40 by four boats of the German III Squadron and 13 torpedo boats of the Italian 18° MAS, 2° MS and 20° MAS, which made fifteen attacks; <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>line</b> of merchant ships and the reduced number of escort ships providing an easy target. The 18° MAS detected the convoy on radar, south-east of Pantellaria and attacked the escorts {{at the head of the}} procession, coming under fire as they fired torpedoes to no effect. The Italian boats then attacked the merchant ships.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{production}} of aircraft models continued after the war, the heyday of Dinky ships was between 1934 and 1939. The models were cast from the same unstable alloy that was used across the entire immediate pre-war Dinky range and have therefore also suffered from metal fatigue that makes survivors all the more rare. Small metal rollers were {{also included in the}} design and concealed in the underside of the hull so that the models could be moved smoothly across surfaces. Mirroring the aircraft range, both civilian and military ships were issued, and again, some were disguised. It was not until 1976 that five further models were added to <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>line</b> of maritime releases from Dinky Toys, these were in the larger scale of 1/180–1/200.

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we propose a novel twodimensional {{clocking}} and timing scheme for systems which permit a reduction in <b>the</b> <b>longest</b> <b>line</b> length in each clocking zone. The proposed clocking schemes utilize logic propagation techniques which have been developed for systolic arrays. Placement of QCA cells is modified to ensure correct signal generation and timing. The significant reduction in <b>the</b> <b>longest</b> <b>line</b> length permits a fast timing and efficient pipelining to occur, while guaranteeing kink-free behavior in switching...|$|R
25|$|Championnet assumed {{command of}} the Army of Italy from Moreau at Genoa on 22 September. The Army of the Alps was absorbed by its sister army at that time. Championnet wished to abandon Genoa in order to shorten <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>line</b> he had to defend, but the French {{government}} refused to allow it. There were 63,657 French troops available, but only 53,581 if garrisons are excluded. The right wing under Laurent Gouvion Saint-Cyr had 16,657 soldiers in the divisions of Jean Henri Dombrowski, Pierre Garnier de Laboissière, Sextius Alexandre François de Miollis and François Watrin. Championnet personally led the 15,215-strong center, consisting of the divisions of Louis Lemoine and Claude Perrin Victor at Mondovì. Grenier led the 19,615-man left wing near Cuneo, made up {{of his own and}} Duhesme's divisions plus a 2,056-strong reserve under André Calvin. Duhesme was also charged with holding the Little St Bernard and Mont Cenis passes. Opposing the French were Johann von Klenau who faced Genoa, Paul Kray in the Aosta valley and Melas who threatened Cuneo.|$|E
25|$|The {{recorded}} {{history of the}} Chera dynasty is broadly divided into two phases. The Early Cheras {{are said to have}} spanned the period between the 4th century BCE to 5th century CE. The Later Cheras, also known as the Kulasekharas, were in power between the 8th and 12th century. Little is known about the Cheras between these two prominent phases which is often called a 'historical darkness'. The age and antiquity of the Early Cheras is difficult to establish. Most of their history is reconstructed from a body of literature known as the Sangam literature written in Old Tamil around the 3rd century CE. Traveller's accounts suggest that the Cheras existed during the 4th century BCE. Sangam literature records the names of <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>line</b> of Chera kings, princes, and the court poets who extolled them. The internal chronology of this literature is still far from settled and a connected account {{of the history of the}} period is an area of active research. Uthiyan Cheralathan, Nedum Cheralathan and Senguttuvan are some of the rulers referred to in the Sangam poems. Senguttuvan, the most celebrated of the Chera kings, is famous for the legends surrounding Kannagi, the heroine of the epic Silapathikaram.|$|E
25|$|Some 200 {{yards in}} advance of our position, which we were holding at a terrible cost, was a fence built high and strong. The troops in advance had tried to scale the fence and reform under that hell of fire. They were {{actually}} torn in shreds and wedged into the fence. The cry came to us for volunteers to pull down the fence. Instantly there sprang from <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>line,</b> fast being shortened as the ranks closed up over the dead, seventy-six volunteers. We ran straight for the fence amid a hail of iron and lead, the dead falling all about us, but to reach the fence was our only thought. A part of the force reached it, and, as one would grasp a rail it would be sent flying {{out of his hands}} by rifle-shots. The fence leveled, we made the attempt to return, and it was as hot for us on the retreat, as it had been on the advance. Few escaped death or wounds. I had almost regained my regiment, when I was hit. The line then successfully pressed on, and the 'Sunken Road,' or ' Bloody Lane,' as it is now known, was within our lines.|$|E

500|$|In {{evoking the}} English countryside, the poem {{belongs to the}} picturesque {{tradition}} found in John Dyer's Grongar Hill (1726), and <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>line</b> of topographical imitations it inspired. However, it diverges from this tradition in focusing {{on the death of}} a poet. Much of the poem deals with questions that were linked to Gray's own life; during the poem's composition, he was confronted with the death of others and questioned his own mortality. Although universal in its statements on life and death, the poem was grounded in Gray's feelings about his own life, and served as an epitaph for himself. As such, it falls within an old poetic tradition of poets contemplating their legacy. The poem, as an elegy, also serves to lament the death of others, including West, though at a remove. This {{is not to say that}} Gray's poem was like others of the graveyard school of poetry; instead, Gray tried to avoid a description that would evoke the horror common to other poems in the elegiac tradition. This is compounded further by the narrator trying to avoid an emotional response to death, by relying on rhetorical questions and discussing what his surroundings lack. Nevertheless, the sense of kinship with Robert Blair's [...] "The Grave" [...] was so generally recognised that Gray's Elegy was added to several editions of Blair's poem between 1761-1808, after which other works began to be included as well.|$|E
30|$|Many documents, {{particularly}} historical documents such {{as those}} in Kunqu Opera GCN scores, rely on careful pre-processing to ensure good overall system performance and, in some cases, to significantly improve the recognition performance. In this work, we briefly touch upon the basic pre-processing operations of Kunqu Opera GCN scores, such as binarization, noise removal, skew correction, and the selection of an area of interest. Image binarization uses the algorithm of Otsu [30], noise removal is conducted using basic morphological operations [31], and image rotation has been corrected using the least squares criterion [32]. The area of interest in a Kunqu score is surrounded by a frame (wide lines) (see Figure  3). The frame is a connected component containing <b>the</b> <b>longest</b> <b>line</b> in <b>the</b> score, so we use the Hough transform [33] to locate <b>the</b> <b>longest</b> <b>line</b> then delete <b>the</b> connected component with <b>the</b> <b>longest</b> <b>line</b> from <b>the</b> score, leaving the area of interest. Because these are common image-processing operations, we do not give a detailed description here.|$|R
