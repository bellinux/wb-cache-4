5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the new Congress in 1977, Mathias was in line for several potential committee promotions to ranking member. However, Mathias' outspoken criticism of the party in the previous election cycle aroused enmity amongst his colleagues. On the Judiciary Committee, Mathias had the most seniority of any other member except Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who already held another ranking membership on <b>the</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> <b>Committee.</b> Only one ranking membership was allowed per senator, so Thurmond resigned his ranking membership on <b>the</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> <b>Committee</b> to circumvent Mathias serving as ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. Mathias was also prevented from assuming leadership positions on the Government Operations Committee following a power struggle, and on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights. On the latter subcommittee, Mathias had more seniority than any other member. However, party leaders were uneasy with the idea of allowing Mathias to team up with liberal Democrat and subcommittee chairman Birch Bayh, and voted instead for William L. Scott as ranking member.|$|E
5|$|Senator McCain {{became a}} member of <b>the</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> <b>Committee,</b> with which he had {{formerly}} done his Navy liaison work; he also joined the Commerce Committee and the Indian Affairs Committee. He continued to support the Native American agenda. As first a House member and then a senator– and as a lifelong gambler with close ties to the gambling industry– McCain {{was one of the main}} authors of the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, which codified rules regarding Native American gambling enterprises. McCain was also a strong supporter of the Gramm-Rudman legislation that enforced automatic spending cuts in the case of budget deficits.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, a few on Capitol Hill were {{determined}} to overhaul United States Special Operations Forces. They included Senators Sam Nunn (D-GA) and William Cohen (R-ME), both members of <b>the</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> <b>Committee,</b> and Representative Dan Daniel (D-VA), {{the chairman of the}} United States House Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness. Congressman Daniel had become convinced that the U.S. military establishment was not interested in special operations, that the country's capability in this area was second rate, and that SOF operational command and control was an endemic problem. Senators Nunn and Cohen also felt strongly that the Department of Defense was not preparing adequately for future threats. Senator Cohen agreed that the U.S. needed a clearer organizational focus and chain of command for special operations to deal with low-intensity conflicts.|$|E

To fulfill this responsibility Congress assigns a number of missions to <b>the</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> <b>Committees.</b> In carrying out their assigned tasks <b>the</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> <b>Committees</b> of <b>the</b> Senate and House are forced to rely on members who have been chosen, largely {{on the basis of}} seniority, by the two major political parties.

5|$|Kennedy easily {{defeated}} Republican businessman Ray Shamie to win {{re-election in}} 1982. Senate leaders granted him {{a seat on}} <b>the</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> <b>Committee,</b> while allowing {{him to keep his}} other major seats despite the traditional limit of two such seats. Kennedy became very visible in opposing aspects of the foreign policy of the Reagan administration, including U.S. intervention in the Salvadoran Civil War and U.S. support for the Contras in Nicaragua, and in opposing Reagan-supported weapons systems, including the B-1 bomber, the MX missile, and the Strategic Defense Initiative. Kennedy became the Senate's leading advocate for a nuclear freeze and was a critic of Reagan's confrontational policies toward the Soviet Union. A 1983 memorandum from KGB chairman Viktor Chebrikov to general secretary Yuri Andropov noted this stance and asserted that Kennedy, through former Senator John Tunney's discussions with Soviet contacts, had suggested that U.S.-Soviet relations might be improved if Kennedy and Andropov could meet in person to discuss arms control issues and if top Soviet officials, via Kennedy's help, were able to address the American public through the U.S. news media. Andropov was unimpressed by the idea.|$|E

Uithoven was not given a gubernatorial position. His predecessor, Michael Dayton, was named as the governor's top aide.|$|E

25|$|As Congressman, Watts was {{assigned}} to <b>the</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> <b>Committee</b> and the Financial Services Committee. Watts emphasized moral absolutes and was considered in line with Republican Speaker Newt Gingrich's agenda, the Contract with America, {{and at the time}} was the only African-American who did not join the Congressional Black Caucus. He initially supported ending affirmative action, declaring inadequate education the main obstacle for racial equality, but subsequently opposed legislation banning the practice for the federal government. Watts focused on promoting his party, attending NAACP meetings and meeting with representatives from historically black colleges. In 1995, Watts was named national co-chairman for the presidential campaign of Republican Bob Dole.|$|E
25|$|By 1985, when Aspin became {{chairman}} of <b>the</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> <b>Committee,</b> he {{was recognized as}} a leading defense authority. His chairmanship caused controversy among some House Democrats, particularly because he supported the Reagan administration's policies on the MX missile and aid to the Nicaraguan Contras. Although temporarily removed from his committee chair by his Democratic colleagues in January 1987, Aspin weathered the crisis and regained the chairmanship three weeks later. He again broke with many Democrats in January 1991 when he issued a paper supporting the Bush administration's intention {{to use military force}} to drive the Iraqis from Kuwait. The accuracy of his prediction that the United States could win a quick military victory with light casualties added to his reputation as a military expert.|$|E
25|$|Taylor was {{a member}} of the Blue Dog Coalition, and his voting record was one of the most {{conservative}} among Democrats in the House. He has become a leading Democratic Member of the House Armed Services Committee. He led committee and floor fights to improve the medical benefits of military retirees, and to extend TRICARE health insurance to members of the National Guard and Reserves. Taylor also has focused on U.S. policy in Latin America, sponsoring the successful cap on the number of U.S. troops that can be sent to Colombia without explicit Congressional authorization. Taylor also was a leading critic of the Base Realignment and Closure process, accusing the Department of Defense of smuggling in policy changes that were unrelated to excess capacity or facilities. Taylor served as the Ranking Democrat on the Projection Forces Subcommittee in the 109th Congress, and became chairman of the renamed Subcommittee on Seapower and Expeditionary Forces in the 110th Congress. He and the previous subcommittee chairman Roscoe Bartlett (R-MD), who is now the ranking member of the subcommittee, advocate for more nuclear-powered surface ships in order to reduce the Navy's dependence on imported oil. Taylor is also a member of the Readiness subcommittee of <b>the</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> <b>committee</b> in the 110th Congress.|$|E

500|$|On October 30, 2006, {{before a}} crowd of about 100 people on the Naval Base San Diego waterfront, Hunter {{announced}} {{the formation of an}} exploratory committee to begin raising campaign funds and organizing supporters for the Republican Party's 2008 presidential nomination. He reasoned, [...] "his {{is going to be a}} long road, it's a challenging road, there's going to be some rough and tumble, but I think it's the right thing to do for our country." [...] He did not seek advice from party leaders before making the decision. The New York Times described the move as a [...] "surprise." [...] Mesa College Political Science professor Carl Luna speculated that Hunter's run was an attempt to find [...] "something to do" [...] in preparation for his loss of <b>the</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> <b>Committee</b> chairmanship with Democrats heavily favored to reclaim the House. Political analysts saw little chance for the campaign's success. Claremont McKenna College government professor Jack Pitney argued that due to low name recognition and [...] "no following within the party", Hunter [...] "faces extremely long odds".|$|E
500|$|After the Iraq War began, Clinton made {{trips to}} Iraq and Afghanistan to visit American troops {{stationed}} there. On {{a visit to}} Iraq in February 2005, Clinton noted that the insurgency had failed to disrupt the democratic elections held earlier and that {{parts of the country}} were functioning well. Observing that war deployments were draining regular and reserve forces, she co-introduced legislation to increase the size of the regular U.S. Army by 80,000soldiers to ease the strain. In late 2005, Clinton said that while immediate withdrawal from Iraq would be a mistake, Bush's pledge to stay [...] "until the job is done" [...] was also misguided, as it gave Iraqis [...] "an open-ended invitation not to take care of themselves". Her stance caused frustration among those in the Democratic Party who favored quick withdrawal. Clinton supported retaining and improving health benefits for reservists and lobbied against the closure of several military bases, especially those in New York. She used her position on <b>the</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> <b>Committee</b> to forge close relationships with a number of high-ranking military officers. (By 2014 and 2015 Clinton had fully reversed herself on the Iraq War Resolution, saying that she [...] "got it wrong" [...] and the vote in support had been a [...] "mistake".) ...|$|E

During the forum, he discussed his experience as chairman of <b>the</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> <b>Committee</b> and voiced {{his support for the}} War in Iraq and the training of Iraqi battalions for security there. Hunter speculated that Iran was helping to arm the insurgency in Iraq. When asked what he would do as president if he discovered Iran was developing a nuclear weapon, Hunter stated that he [...] "would authorize the use of tactical nuclear weapons [...] if {{there was no other way}} to preempt..." [...] After discussing foreign policy, Hunter turned his attention to the issue of immigration. He again mentioned the importance of a border wall and evoked the audience's memory about the fence he helped build in his congressional district, joking [...] "if they (illegal immigrants) get across my fence , we sign them up for the Olympics immediately." [...] At the end of the debate, Hunter took the opportunity to criticize the three frontrunners: John McCain, Rudy Giuliani, and Mitt Romney. He complained that Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts exerted too much influence on the three men, describing them as the [...] "Kennedy Wing of the Republican Party." ...|$|E

500|$|As the 114th United States Congress {{assembled}} in January 2015 with Republicans {{in control of}} the Senate, McCain became chair of <b>the</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> <b>Committee,</b> a longtime goal of his. [...] In this position, he led the writing of proposed Senate legislation that sought to modify parts of the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986 in order to return responsibility for major weapons systems acquisition back to the individual armed services and their secretaries and away from the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics. [...] As chair, McCain has tried to maintain a bipartisan approach and has forged a good relationship with ranking member Jack Reed. [...] In April 2015, McCain announced that he would run for a sixth term in Arizona's 2016 Senate election. [...] While there was still conservative and Tea Party anger at him, it was unclear if they would mount an effective primary challenge against him. During 2015, McCain strongly opposed the proposed comprehensive agreement on the Iranian nuclear program, saying that Secretary of State Kerry was [...] "delusional" [...] and [...] "giv away the store" [...] in negotiations with Iran. McCain supported the Saudi Arabian-led military intervention in Yemen against the Shia Houthis and forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, saying: “I’m sure civilians die in war.
