5|$|There {{came to me}} Bowes, by whom I do {{understand}} <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> is dead and as he sayeth by a fall {{from a pair of}} stairs. Little other understanding can I have of him. The greatness and the suddenness of the misfortune doth so perplex me, until I do hear from you how the matter standeth, or how this evil should light upon me, considering what the malicious world will bruit, as I can take no rest.|$|E
25|$|Let us say <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> who {{is here in}} {{the gallery}} with us tonight, a sixth {{generation}} Oregonian, is walking by the friendly, local military base and is picked up as an unlawful enemy combatant. What is her recourse? She says, I am a U.S. citizen. That is a jurisdictional fact under this statute, and she will not have recourse to the courts? She can take it to Donald Rumsfeld, but she cannot take it across the street to an article3 court.|$|E

[...] Why is it <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> who is sitting out there in the audience is the first in her family to ever go to college? Is it because our fathers and mothers were not bright? Is it because I'm the first Biden in a thousand generations to get a college and a graduate degree that I was smarter than the rest?" ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, Howe turned down several {{requests}} that he stand for alderman in Port Arthur. He did agree to seek {{election to the}} school board in 1921, and headed the polls at his first attempt. He served two 2-year terms on the board, spending the final year as its chairman. Early in their marriage, Clarence and Alice Howe had decided to separate their roles, with Alice Howe having full responsibility for their domestic lives. Howe took no interest in his home life; as an often-absent father he had only a small role in the upbringing of his five children. In the same manner he did not involve his wife in his business (or, later public) life. [...] During his ministerial career, he replied {{in response to an}} opposition question hinting at nepotism, [...] "I don't like to discuss my family in public. Members may have noticed <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> never appears on political platforms." ...|$|E
500|$|On 30 May 1990, the new Croatian Parliament {{held its}} first session. President Tuđman {{announced}} his manifesto for a new Constitution (ratified {{at the end of}} the year) and a multitude of political, economic, and social changes, notably to what extent minority rights (mainly for Serbs) would be guaranteed. Local Serb politicians opposed the new constitution. In 1991, Croats represented 78.1% and Serbs 12.2% of the total population of Croatia, but the latter held a disproportionate number of official posts: 17.7% of appointed officials in Croatia, including police, were Serbs. An even greater proportion of those posts had been held by Serbs in Croatia earlier, which created a perception that the Serbs were guardians of the communist regime. This caused discontent among the Croats despite the fact it never actually undermined their own dominance in SR Croatia. After the HDZ came to power, many Serbs employed in the public sector, especially the police, were fired and replaced by Croats. This, combined with Tuđman's remarks, i.e. [...] "they declare <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> is Jewish or Serbian. Luckily for me, she never was either", were distorted by Milošević's media to spark fear that any form of an independent Croatia would be a new [...] "Ustashe state". In one instance, TV Belgrade showed Tuđman shaking hands with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl (who would be the first government leader in the world to recognise independent Croatia and Slovenia) accusing the two of plotting [...] "a Fourth Reich".|$|E

6000|$|... "Not that I mean you're too stout," [...] said Mr. Davis, hurriedly--"for {{people that}} like stoutness, <b>that</b> is. <b>My</b> <b>wife</b> used to 'ave {{a very good}} figger." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And can't {{you believe}} it, too, under these conditions; that I married Cytherea, gave her up because I heard <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> was alive, found <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> {{would not come}} to live with me, and then, not to let any woman I love so well as Cytherea run any risk of being {{displaced}} and ruined in reputation, should my wife ever think fit to return, induced this woman to come to me, as being better than no companion at all?' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "There {{was nothing}} tactless about it," [...] he assured her. [...] "It {{makes it much}} {{easier for me to}} tell you. I married <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> {{thirteen}} years ago because I believed that her wealth would help me in my career. She married me because she was an American with ambitions, anxious to find a definite place in English society. She has been disappointed in me. Other circumstances have now presented themselves.
