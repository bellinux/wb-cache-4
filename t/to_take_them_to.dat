5|$|During the 18th century, the island's {{location}} made it {{an ideal}} base for smuggling. It has been alleged that an old mine shaft {{on the north side}} of the island connects with a series of natural tunnels, and a concealed exit to the sea. Although Flat Holm was in full view of both the Welsh and English coasts, customs authorities were powerless to act as they had no boat <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> the island. According to tradition, a small cave in the east cliff at Flat Holm was used for the storage of contraband, mainly tea and brandy.|$|E

On 5 June 1920, the first air mail flight between the Netherlands and the United Kingdom was made. Bert Hinchcliffe departed from Schiphol in a hired Airco DH.9 with 300 letters on board. Despite the bad weather, Hinchcliffe decided not to land at Lympne and pressed on towards Croydon. He was eventually forced to land at Penshurst due {{to a combination of}} the weather and running low on fuel. A taxi was hired to take Hinchcliffe and the letters on to London. A linen windsock was installed at Penshurst in November 1920. The War Office telephone was notified as having been discontinued in January 1921.

5|$|The acting Commander, 7th Division Australian Army Service Corps (AASC), Lieutenant Colonel Gordon Richardson, assumed {{control of}} {{logistics}} {{on the track}} on 10 September. Supplies were then brought from the Base Supply Depots at Sogeri and Ilolo to Newton's Depot in 3-ton trucks by the 2/5th AASC Company.

The flying fox was used <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> {{the floor of the}} Goldie River Valley, from whence the 1st Independent Light Horse Troop carried them to Uberi. From there, they were carried on the backs of Papuan porters, known as carriers. If there were more stores than the animals could carry, they would assist with that too.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{two weeks}} after {{violence}} broke out in Benghazi, Owumi {{received a call from}} his teammate Moustapha Niang, who said that Elturki would attempt to help the two players escape the country. Elturki had arranged for a car <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> an Egyptian refugee camp in Sallum, following Al-Nasr coach Sherif Azmy. Owumi passed through several rebel checkpoints and arrived at the Egyptian border in 12 hours. Both Owumi and Niang, due to their appearance, were suspected of being foreign mercenaries fighting for Gaddafi and were subject to harsher treatment. Without proper immigration papers, Owumi was held in Sallum for three days. He was arrested and then imprisoned in solitary confinement for two hours. When he was removed, he had to sleep outside for three days. Owumi and Niang finally escaped the camp {{in the middle of the}} night. They bribed the driver of a bus, which only allowed Egyptian citizens, to help them leave. At around this time, Owumi received a call from Azmy, who wanted to meet him in his home in Alexandria. As a result, he convinced the driver, who was headed to Cairo, to lead them to another bus to Alexandria.|$|E

5|$|Born in Stockport, Greater Manchester, Crowther {{spent nine}} years at his local club Stockport County {{moving through the}} youth system, before making his first team debut for the club on 2 January 2006 in a 2–2 draw against Cheltenham Town, where aged just 17, he came on as a {{substitute}} and was made captain, making him the youngest captain in the club's history.

5|$|Father John learns the john's car {{belongs to}} an {{accountant}} named Steven Miller, who tells Father John the prostitute is Linda, an expensive call {{girl who is}} widely considered among the best at her profession. Meanwhile, Linda visits her dying, elderly stepfather Donald Dupree (Tom Carey), who repeatedly raped Linda in her childhood and ultimately set her {{on the path to}} prostitution. Linda confronts him about their past, but claims she has forgiven him his sins, even though he continues to deny any wrongdoing. A drunk Nadine goes to talk to Father John in confession about her loneliness and feelings for him. He admits to caring for her as well, but they agree to remain friends. Later, Father John hires Lloyd Montag (Bruce A. Young), an unemployed boxer at his church, to serve as his bodyguard as he talks to St. Clair.

There, Father John and Lloyd find Zeke (Tony Papenfuss), a taxi driver who knows they are looking for Linda and agrees <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> her apartment. Zeke explains he had driven her to the church when she first spoke to Father John at confession, and Zeke later visited the church to watch Father John preach.|$|E
5|$|In 1198, Pope Innocent III {{broached}} {{the subject of}} a new crusade through legates and encyclical letters. The stated intent of the crusade was to conquer Egypt, now the centre of Muslim power in the Levant. The crusader army that arrived at Venice in the summer of 1202 was somewhat smaller than had been anticipated, and there were not sufficient funds to pay the Venetians, whose fleet was hired by the crusaders <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> Egypt. Venetian policy under the ageing and blind but still ambitious Doge Enrico Dandolo was potentially at variance with that of the Pope and the crusaders, because Venice was closely related commercially with Egypt. The crusaders accepted the suggestion that in lieu of payment they assist the Venetians in the capture of the (Christian) port of Zara in Dalmatia (vassal city of Venice, which had rebelled and placed itself under Hungary's protection in 1186). The city fell in November 1202 after a brief siege. Innocent tried to forbid this political attack on a Christian city, but was ignored. Reluctant to jeopardise his own agenda for the Crusade, he gave conditional absolution to the crusaders—not, however, to the Venetians.|$|E
