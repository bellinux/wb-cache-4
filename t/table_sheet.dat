50|$|After {{some time}} on the road, they reach the town of Rithmere and started hearing about a {{competition}} called the Rithmere Games. Thinking they can win some money from it, they attempt to enter. But there is an entrance fee of one silver coin, {{and they have no}} money whatsoever. Lief, Jasmine, and Barda decide to let the operator of a game called Beat the Bird borrow Kree to spin the wheel thirty times, for a coin. In Beat the Bird, a bird would spin a wheel after a silver coin was paid. If the wheel lands on a number, the better is paid that number of silver coins. But if the wheel lands on a bird, the better only receives a worthless wooden bird figurine. After thirty turns, Kree senses something is amiss and pulls the <b>table</b> <b>sheet,</b> which reveals that the operator is controlling the wheel {{through the use of a}} pedal. The cheating operator then flees, leaving the coins that have fallen off the <b>table</b> <b>sheet</b> to the crowd. Lief, Barda, and Jasmine attempt to take some of the coins, but all that is left is a wooden bird.|$|E
50|$|After an {{encounter}} with Walter Koch, Graz, during a conference in Karlsruhe in 2010. Ms. Dahlberg started to digitize some 3,500 of the 6,500 concepts of knowledge fields with their definitions in a <b>table</b> <b>sheet</b> file and also many concepts of the so-called “general concepts” from the zero-level of ICC (still unfinished). These work could serve as starting base for a linkage e.g. with WordNet, {{as it has been}} demonstrated in a paper by Ernesto DeLuca, Potsdam at the international ISKO Congress in Kraków, in May 2014. Her recent book, published 2014, on “Knowledge Organization, Development, Task, Application, Future” (in German) also details some of the activities mentioned. It addresses particularly computer scientists, in order to convey to them a humanistic view on the content related treatment of their data, but turns also to readers wishing to access the topic principally. It also covers the theoretical basis of ICC and shows its many-fold potential for applications. She emphasizes her conception - next to subject-related aspects - of an innovating approach to science-policy issues. She strongly recommends Knowledge Organization to be anchored in universities as a discipline of its own under “Science of Science”. Already in 1974 she had provided in her ICC a position for Knowledge Organization under the subject group “81” (Science of Science). She considers indeed this field to be explored within an institute or an academy since there is such a huge amount of work to be accomplished under the fruitful auspices of the whole array of insights gained so far.|$|E

This research also analyzes the effects of language Compression and Omission on meaning equivalence. This research is a qualitative research. Therefore, the discussion is delivered in a descriptive way. To support and to strengthen the findings, number and percentage are used in this research. The data are the English expressions which contain Language Compression and Omission in Saving Private Ryan film and its subtitle in Bahasa Indonesia. The data sources are the dialogue in the movie and the subtitle. To analyze the data, the data are filled into the <b>table</b> <b>sheet</b> and classified according to the realization of Language Compression and Omission. The results of the realization of Language Compression and Omission are recorded in the table. Then, the conclusion is made. To gain the trustworthiness, the result of the data analysis is conducted several times to check whether the research result is still the same. The findings of this research show that language compression occurs 23 times. Language compression is influenced by parts of speech (modal, noun/noun phrase, verb/verb phrase, adverb, interjection, preposition, pronoun, complement, prepositional phrase). In Language Compression, noun/noun phrase occur the most, 13 times or 43...|$|E
40|$|An user {{interface}} to input parameters, run simulations, and graph the outputs from the continuous casting model CON 1 D {{was designed and}} implemented in a spreadsheet environment, {{with a focus on}} including features to expand the usability and audience of the model. CON 1 D is a very powerful and efficient 1 -D transient computational model of heat transfer in the process of continuous casting of steel slabs. This model has been validated by many plant measurements to predict mold temperatures, shell thickness, mold heat flux, slab temperatures, and many other parameters. This interface incorporates worksheets where the user can enter input data with user-friendly features and functionality. A grade-table sheet allows the user to setup the composition of commonly used steel grades, which can be used to automatically fill fields when running various simulations. A spray <b>table</b> <b>sheet</b> allows a change in casting speed to automatically update water flow rates of all of the spray zones. The {{user interface}} includes the key ability to convert the units of parameters, allowing users to utilize either British units, metric units, or a customized mixture. The interface integrates with a familiar spread-sheet post-processor, which reads in the many output files generated by CON 1 D and plots the results in readily-customized graphs. User feedback was used to make iterative improvements to the system. The interface has received positive feedback from users. The added user-friendly features of the interface will allow a wider audience of users to benefit from the CON 1 D model, including both researchers and a larger group of users in the industrial environment of continuous casting systems...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} aims to {{find the}} abuses experienced by Tess Stevens, {{the causes of the}} abuses, the effects of the abuses, and the effects of the abuses on Tess’ personality development in the autobiography of Sold. In order to answer the objectives, this research employed Erikson’s psychosocial theory and the theories of abuse by several scholars. This study is a qualitative research employing content analysis method. The data of this research are words, phrases, sentences, and paragraphs which are taken from an autobiography entitled Sold which have correlation with the objectives of the research. Since this is a qualitative research, the researcher was the primary instrument of this research, while the <b>table</b> <b>sheets</b> were the secondary instruments. The data analysis was conducted through four steps: reading and re- reading, arranging and sorting the categorized data, interpreting, and reporting the findings in the research. In order to obtain trustworthiness, the researcher conducted triangulation. The findings of the research show that there are four abuses experienced by Tess: psychological abuse, sexual abuse, neglect, and physical abuse. The second finding shows that there are four causes of the abuses: gender inequality, poverty, abuser’s past experience, and parent’s divorce. The researcher also found that there are four effects of the abuses: genophobia, juvenile delinquency and adult crime, physical wound in certain area of the body, and difficulties in socializing. Finally, there are four effects of the abuses on Tess’ personality development: inferiority, role confusion, isolation, and generativity...|$|R
