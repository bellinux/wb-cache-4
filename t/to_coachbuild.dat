50|$|The Convoy was {{available}} in 2.8 tonne, 3.1 tonne and 3.5 tonne variants (the 3.5 tonne having a dual rear wheel setup for safety and improved handling) with load volume capacities up to 12.9 cubic metres, which were highly praised by reviewers. An extra-long-wheelbase version was also available. The chassis was described as 'tough as old boots' and 'cool and sophisticated' by pundits, but was criticised for 'scary handling in the wet' when empty. The LDV 'SVO' (Specialist Vehicle Options) division boasted of its ability <b>to</b> <b>coachbuild</b> directly in the factory (located at Washwood Heath in Birmingham), making the vehicle popular with those requiring custom coachwork, such as disabled users, ice-cream sellers, tow truck operators, those carrying frozen food, and the fire brigade. The van would also come in crew-cab (up to 7-seat) pick-up and fleet based vans, and was the cheapest full-size van on the UK market at the time, providing it with many fleet-based customers such as local authorities and government agencies. Disc brakes were standard for the front, drums standard for the rear.|$|E
