5|$|A {{commission}} {{appointed by}} Governor Chiles published {{a report in}} 1995 stating that South Florida was unable to sustain its growth, and {{the deterioration of the}} environment was negatively affecting daily life for residents in South Florida. The environmental decline was predicted to harm tourism and commercial interests if no actions were taken to halt current trends. Results of an eight-year study <b>that</b> <b>evaluated</b> the C were submitted to the United States Congress in 1999. The report warned that if no action was taken the region would rapidly deteriorate. A strategy called the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was enacted to restore portions of the Everglades, Lake Okeechobee, the Caloosahatchee River, and Florida Bay to undo the damage of the past 50years. It would take 30years and cost $7.8billion to complete. Though the plan was passed into law in 2000, it has been compromised by politics and funding problems.|$|E

As one colleague put it, [...] "Okeechobee {{is the point}} to attack"; the canals were to be [...] "equal or greater than the inflow from the Kissimmee valley, which {{is the source of}} all the evil." [...] Disston sponsored the digging of a canal [...] long from Lake Okeechobee towards Miami, but it was abandoned when the rock proved denser than the engineers had expected. Though the canals lowered the groundwater, their capacity was inadequate for the wet season. A report <b>that</b> <b>evaluated</b> the failure of the project concluded: [...] "The reduction of the waters is simply a question of sufficient capacity in the canals which may be dug for their relief".|$|E

[...] The fire destroyed a large swath of the commercial district of the city, and Gaston was criticized for failing to show decisive leadership during attempts to bring the fire under control. [...] This weak showing, combined with a poor response to a smallpox epidemic in the city, contributed to his loss in a bid for a third term.|$|E

A tsunami flow depth of [...] usually resulted in complete destruction of these types of structures. A group of scientists <b>that</b> <b>evaluated</b> the damage considered the unreinforced brick construction as weak, because the performance of homes constructed in that style did not fare much better than the timber/bamboo variety.

It further noted that the combined sales targets for the three companies for the fiscal year to March 2012 were subsequently reduced by 93percent to a combined ¥6.5billion (US$85.7million). Despite the suspicions of wrongdoing, Olympus strongly denied suggestions that the transactions were [...] "something illegal or unauthorized". CFO Asia said that if there was truly no corporate malfeasance, there are [...] "uncomfortable questions about the competence of the internal and external teams <b>that</b> <b>evaluated</b> the three acquisitions, as well as the capabilities of the senior managers and board members that accepted the sky-high valuations and approved the deals."
