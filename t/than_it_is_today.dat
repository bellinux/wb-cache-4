5|$|In Predynastic and Early Dynastic times, the Egyptian climate {{was much}} less arid <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>today.</b> Large regions of Egypt were covered in treed savanna and traversed by herds of grazing ungulates. Foliage and fauna were far more {{prolific}} in all environs and the Nile region supported large populations of waterfowl. Hunting would have been common for Egyptians, and {{this is also the}} period when many animals were first domesticated.|$|E

5|$|At {{times during}} the last interglacial period (130,000–70,000 BCE) Europe had a climate warmer <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>today,</b> and early humans may have {{made their way to}} Scotland, though archaeologists have found no traces of this. Glaciers then scoured their way across most of Britain, and only after the ice retreated did Scotland again become habitable, around 9600 BCE. Mesolithic {{hunter-gatherer}} encampments formed the first known settlements, and archaeologists have dated an encampment near Biggar to around 8500 BCE. Numerous other sites found around Scotland build up a picture of highly mobile boat-using people making tools from bone, stone and antlers. The oldest house for which there is evidence in Britain is the oval structure of wooden posts found at South Queensferry near the Firth of Forth, dating from the Mesolithic period, about 8240 BCE.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{have shown}} that a cycle occurs in which {{volcanic}} activity at the summit is dominant for several hundred years, after which activity shifts to the rift zones for several more centuries, {{and then back to}} the summit again. Two cycles have been clearly identified, each lasting 1,500–2,000years. This cyclical behavior is unique to Mauna Loa among the Hawaiian volcanoes. Between about 7,000 and 6,000years ago Mauna Loa was largely inactive. The cause of this cessation in activity is not known, and no known similar hiatus has been found at other Hawaiian volcanoes except for those currently in the post-shield stage. Between 11,000 and 8,000years ago, activity was more intense <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>today.</b> However, Mauna Loa's overall rate of growth has probably begun to slow over the last 100,000years, and the volcano may in fact be nearing the end of its tholeiitic basalt shield-building phase.|$|E
5|$|Then as now, Madagascar was an island, having {{separated}} from the Indian subcontinent less than 20 million years earlier. It was drifting northwards but still 10–15° more southerly in latitude <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>today.</b> The prevailing climate of the time was semi-arid, with pronounced seasonality in temperature and rainfall. Majungasaurus inhabited a coastal flood plain cut by many sandy river channels. Strong geological evidence suggests the occurrence of periodic debris flows through these channels {{at the beginning of}} the wet season, burying the carcasses of organisms killed during the preceding dry season and providing for their exceptional preservation as fossils. Sea levels in the area were rising throughout the Maastrichtian, and would continue to do so into the Paleocene Epoch, so Majungasaurus may have roamed coastal environments like tidal flats as well. The neighboring Berivotra Formation represents the contemporaneous marine environment.|$|E

50|$|At {{the end of}} the 1700s, {{cases of}} deadly {{violence}} were considered rare in Stockholm, and the ratio of murder and manslaughter cases per citizen was just 2 per 100 000 annually.

5|$|Theoretical {{models of}} the Sun's {{development}} suggest that 3.8 to 2.5 billion years ago, during the Archean eon, the Sun was only about 75% as bright as it is today. Such a weak star {{would not have been}} able to sustain liquid water on Earth's surface, and thus life should not have been able to develop. However, the geological record demonstrates that Earth has remained at a fairly constant temperature throughout its history, and that the young Earth was somewhat warmer <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>today.</b> One theory among scientists is that the atmosphere of the young Earth contained much larger quantities of greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide, methane) than are present today, which trapped enough heat to compensate for the smaller amount of solar energy reaching it.|$|E
5|$|In November 2011, Kaye {{announced}} that particles of pure (unalloyed) titanium {{had also been}} found on the tie. He explained that titanium, which was much rarer in the 1970s <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>today,</b> {{was at that time}} found only in metal fabrication or production facilities, or at chemical companies using it (combined with aluminum) to store extremely corrosive substances. The findings suggested that Cooper may have been a chemist or a metallurgist, or possibly an engineer or manager (the only employees who wore ties in such facilities at that time) in a metal or chemical manufacturing plant, or at a company that recovered scrap metal from those types of factories. In January 2017, Kaye reported that rare earth minerals such as cerium and strontium sulfide had also been identified among particles from the tie. One of the rare applications for such elements in the 1970s was Boeing's supersonic transport development project, suggesting the possibility that Cooper was a Boeing employee. Other possible sources of the material included plants that manufactured cathode ray tubes, such as the Portland firms Teledyne and Tektronix.|$|E
5|$|The {{porbeagle}} has {{an almost}} global amphitemperate distribution, i.e. it is {{absent from the}} tropics; in the North Pacific, its niche is assumed by the salmon shark. It is found mostly within 30–70°N and 30–50°S latitudes. In the North Atlantic, the northern limit of its range extends from the Newfoundland Grand Banks off Canada, through southern Greenland, to Scandinavia and Russia; the southern limit of its range extends from New Jersey and Bermuda, through the Azores and Madeira, to Morocco. It {{is found in the}} Mediterranean Sea, but not the Black Sea. Normally, North Atlantic sharks only stray as far south as South Carolina and the Gulf of Guinea, but pregnant females from the western North Atlantic population are known to range into the Sargasso Sea, almost as far as Hispaniola, to give birth. In the Southern Hemisphere, the porbeagle apparently occupies a continuous band bound in the south by the Antarctic Convergence, and extending as far north as Chile and Brazil, the Western Cape province of South Africa, Australia to southern Western Australia and southern Queensland, and New Zealand. It is speculated that the porbeagle colonized the Southern Hemisphere during the Quaternary glaciation (beginning c. 2.6 Ma), when the tropical climate zone was much narrower <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{pitch of}} these {{traditional}} djembes was much lower <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>today</b> because the natural materials imposed {{a limit on}} the amount of tension that could be applied. Prior to playing, djembefolas heated the skin near the flames of an open fire, which drives moisture out of the skin and causes it to shrink and increase the pitch of the drum. This process had to be repeated frequently, every 15–30 minutes.|$|E

50|$|Pleurodonta (from Greek lateral teeth, in {{reference}} to the position of the teeth on the jaw) is one of the two subdivisions of Iguania, the other being Acrodonta (teeth on the top the jaw). Pleurodonta includes all families previously split from Iguanidae sensu lato (Corytophanidae, Crotaphytidae, Hoplocercidae, Opluridae, Polychrotidae, etc.), whereas Acrodonta includes Agamidae and Chamaeleonidae. The name Pleurodonta was first used by paleontologist and herpetologist Edward Drinker Cope in 1864, although he used it in a different sense <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> used <b>today.</b> Because of this difference, the name Iguanoidea has been proposed as a replacement for Pleurodonta in phylogenetic nomenclature.|$|R
