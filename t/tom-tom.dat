5|$|The F-84 was {{the first}} {{production}} fighter aircraft to utilize inflight refueling and the first fighter capable of carrying a nuclear weapon, the Mark 7 nuclear bomb. Modified F-84s were used in several unusual projects, including the FICON and <b>Tom-Tom</b> dockings to the B-29 Superfortress and B-36 bomber motherships, and the experimental XF-84H Thunderscreech turboprop.|$|E
5|$|The agung {{is usually}} {{performed}} while {{standing beside the}} instrument, holding the upper edge of its flange between the thumb and other fingers with the left hand while striking the knob with the right hand. The mallets, called balu, are made from short sticks about half a foot in length and padded with soft but tough material such as rubber at one end. Using these balus, players handle the agung {{similar to the way}} a brass <b>tom-tom</b> is played.|$|E

25|$|Snare drum stands {{have long}} been used by some drummers to support <b>tom-tom</b> drums. In this {{application}} they offer much the same advantages as the more recently available rim mounts.|$|E
25|$|Drum kits are {{traditionally}} categorised {{by the number}} of drums, ignoring cymbals and other instruments. Snare, <b>tom-tom</b> and bass drums are always counted; Other drums such as octobans {{may or may not be}} counted.|$|E
25|$|Projects TIP TOW and <b>Tom-Tom</b> {{involved}} docking F-84s to the wingtips of B-29s and B-36s. The {{hope was}} that the increased aspect ratio of the combined aircraft {{would result in a}} greater range. Project TIP TOW was canceled when an EF-84D and a specially modified test EB-29A crashed, killing everyone on both aircraft. This accident was attributed to the EF-84D flipping over onto the wing of the EB-29A. Project <b>Tom-Tom,</b> involving RF-84Fs and a GRB-36D from the FICON project (redesignated JRB-36F), continued for a few months after this crash, but was also canceled due to the violent turbulence induced by the wingtip vortices of the B-36.|$|E

25|$|<b>Tom-tom</b> drums, or toms for short, are drums without snares {{and played}} with sticks (or {{whatever}} tools the music style requires), and are the most numerous drums in most kits. They provide the bulk of most drum fills and solos.|$|E
25|$|An “old-time” Mohawk Council House of the Six Nations {{was erected}} for ceremonies and visits, {{and on one}} {{occasion}} 150 Indians camped in the forests of The Wigwam. The sound of <b>tom-tom</b> drums was frequently heard from The Wigwam.|$|E
25|$|Drum mounts are fittings, {{normally}} {{attached to}} the drum shell, that enable a drum to be attached to a supporting bracket, stand or rack. Traditionally, smaller <b>tom-tom</b> drums are supported by mounts and known as hanging toms, while snare drums rest on a stand not {{attached to the}} drum, and floor toms and bass drums rest on their own legs.|$|E

25|$|Several factors {{determine}} the sound a drum produces, including the type, shape {{and construction of}} the drum shell, the type of drum heads it has, and the tension of these drumheads. Different drum sounds have different uses in music. Take, for example, the modern <b>Tom-tom</b> drum. A jazz drummer may want drums that are high pitched, resonant and quiet whereas a rock drummer may prefer drums that are loud, dry and low-pitched. Since these drummers want different sounds, their drums are constructed and tuned differently.|$|E
25|$|The drum trophy {{originated}} in 1937 when MU's Kansas City Alumni Association {{in cooperation with}} the Kansas University Lettermen's Association decided to present an authentic Indian <b>tom-tom</b> drum each Thanksgiving to the winner of the Kansas-Missouri football game. The decision was finalized at annual Homecoming luncheon of the M Men's Club at Rothwell Gymnasium on November 13, 1937. The MU Kansas City Alumni Association made arrangements for the drum to be built by Osage Indians, because they were more representative of the two states than any other tribe. The drum remained in Missouri's possession for the first few years until the trophy was briefly forgotten during wartime. The tradition resumed on an annual basis in 1947, and the MU and KU circles of Omicron Delta Kappa served as caretakers of the drum throughout most of its history.|$|E

500|$|... "Sunshine of Your Love" [...] is a 1967 song by the British {{rock band}} Cream. With {{elements}} of hard rock, psychedelia, and pop, {{it is one}} of Cream's best-known and most popular songs. [...] Cream bassist and vocalist Jack Bruce based it on a distinctive bass riff or repeated musical phrase he developed after attending a Jimi Hendrix concert. Guitarist Eric Clapton and lyricist Pete Brown later contributed to the song. [...] Recording engineer Tom Dowd suggested the rhythm arrangement in which drummer Ginger Baker plays a distinctive <b>tom-tom</b> drum rhythm, although Baker has claimed it was his idea.|$|E

500|$|Musically, [...] "Burning Up" [...] has a starker {{arrangement}} {{brought about}} by bass, single guitar and drum machine. The guitar riffs in the songs were not characteristics of Madonna's later records. The <b>tom-tom</b> drum beats used in the song were reminiscent of the records of singer Phil Collins. It also incorporated electric guitars and the most state-of-the-art synthesizers of that time. The chorus is a repetition of the same three lines of the lyrics, while the bridge consists {{of a series of}} double entendres in regards to the lyrics of the song which describes what she is prepared to do for her lover and that she is individualistic and shameless.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Goodnight and Thank You", Madonna and Banderas trade verses, {{talking about}} ending Eva's love affairs, {{followed}} by Banderas' solo [...] "The Lady's Got Potential", musing about Eva's gradual rise on the society ladder. The gentle ballad, [...] "I'd Be Surprisingly Good for You", is about Eva meeting her husband Juan Perón; its composed of flutes, classical guitar and subdued strings. Military drum beats and a brass section start off [...] "Peron's Latest Flame", where Banderas sings loudly {{about the general}} population disapproving of Eva. In {{the middle of a}} male backing chorus, Madonna sings her lines, accompanied by stereo <b>tom-tom</b> drum and synth sounds. For [...] "A New Argentina", electric guitar and chorus form the main backbone. Composed as an [...] "uprising hymn", Rooksby noted that Madonna's vocals sounded [...] "aggressive and growling".|$|E
500|$|The second verse of {{the song}} adds accompaniment from {{acoustic}} guitar and tambourine. Tim Riley writes that, with the [...] "restrained <b>tom-tom</b> and cymbal fill" [...] that introduces the drum part, [...] "the piano shifts downward to add a flat seventh to the tonic chord, making the downbeat of the bridge the point of arrival ('And any time you feel the pain)." [...] At {{the end of each}} bridge, McCartney sings a brief phrase ("Na-na-na na …"), supported by an electric guitar fill, before playing a piano fill that leads to the next verse. According to Riley, this vocal phrase serves to [...] "reorient the harmony for the verse as the piano figure turns upside down into a vocal aside". Additional musical details, such as tambourine on the third verse and subtle harmonies accompanying the lead vocal, are added to sustain interest throughout the four-verse, two-bridge song.|$|E
