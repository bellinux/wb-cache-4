5|$|On 7 July 1961, {{the second}} prototype, XP836, {{performed}} its first <b>take</b> <b>off</b> conventionally. Continuing {{tests of the}} two prototypes proceeded {{to close the gap}} between vertical <b>take</b> <b>off</b> and flight, a feat which was achieved on 8 September 1961. During September, the feat was repeated multiple times by both prototypes, transitioning from vertical to horizontal flight and vice versa, including instances in which the auto-stabiliser was intentionally disabled.|$|E

5|$|At {{approximately}} 10:00, {{the runway}} at Khâm Đức was cleared of the wrecked helicopter. Moments later, a C-130 piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Daryl D. Cole touched {{down on the}} runway under heavy fire, which flattened one tire and caused extensive damage to the wing tanks. Almost immediately, Cole's aircraft was rushed by hysterical Vietnamese civilians from ditches along the runway, filling the aircraft so the loadmaster was prevented from unloading the aircraft's cargo. Under heavy fire, Cole decided to navigate his aircraft down the cratered and shrapnel-littered runway, in order to <b>take</b> <b>off.</b> However, the combined weight of the cargo and civilians, {{in addition to the}} damage sustained during landing, prevented the aircraft from gathering enough speed to <b>take</b> <b>off.</b> So the aircrew aborted the <b>take</b> <b>off,</b> offloaded the civilians, and proceeded to cut off the blown tire to stop it from flapping and slowing down the aircraft. They were able to cut off the rubber with the bayonet, and were able to cut through the steel beading thanks to the engineers carefully cutting the steel cords with a blowtorch. A fire extinguisher was kept handy because of fear of catching the magnesium wheel on fire. About two hours later, realizing that enemy artillery rounds were coming closer to his aircraft, Colonel Cole tried to <b>take</b> <b>off</b> for the second time, and managed to get the C-130 into the air. This time his only passengers were three members of Air Force Combat Control Team (CCT), whose radio equipment had been destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Both British bomber squadrons {{began to}} <b>take</b> <b>off</b> at 5pm local time. No. 9 Squadron {{dispatched}} 18 Lancasters from RAF Bardney and 20 No. 617 Squadron Lancasters departed from RAF Woodhall Spa.|$|E
50|$|The first {{privately owned}} airport in Samarinda, Borneo, was located at Mahakam. At the {{beginning}} of 1950, many Catalina amphibious aeroplanes successfully <b>took</b> <b>off</b> at the airport. They were the first aeroplane that <b>took</b> <b>off</b> from Samarinda. On 17 September 1950, {{the first president of}} Indonesia Soekarno, <b>took</b> <b>off</b> from the airport on his first visit to Samarinda.|$|R
50|$|The next day, the 26th of June, Gastello's regiment, the 207th flew {{multiple}} sorties targeting enemy transport columns {{along the}} Molodechno-Radoshkovichi highway. Bombers were launched in pairs, without fighter escort, with about two-hour intervals between pairs. The day's first sortie <b>took</b> <b>off</b> at 0830, led by Captain Maslov. Senior Lt Viskovsky's pair <b>took</b> <b>off</b> at 1000. Captain Gastello's zveno (flight) of DB-3F's <b>took</b> <b>off</b> at 1200. Gastello's wingman was Lt. Vorobiev.|$|R

5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{involved in}} the accident was a Boeing 707–465 registered G-ARWE (manufacturer's serial number 18373, Boeing line number 302). First flown on 27 June 1962, the aircraft was originally to have been operated by Cunard Eagle Airways, but before it entered service it was sold to BOAC-Cunard and was delivered on 7 July 1962. On 21 November 1967 the aircraft suffered an engine failure on <b>take</b> <b>off</b> from Honolulu International Airport. The <b>take</b> <b>off</b> was aborted, {{and there were no}} injuries to any of the passengers or crew. At the time of the Heathrow accident, the aircraft had flown for a total of 20,870 hours. The aircraft was insured for £2,200,000 with Lloyd's of London.|$|E

5|$|A second British raid, {{which had}} been {{scheduled}} to <b>take</b> <b>off</b> from 08:00 on 17 July, was cancelled two minutes before the aircraft were to begin launching when fog began to build up near the carriers, and the British fleet turned south to return to Scapa Flow. Swordfish and Seafire aircraft flew protective patrols over the Home Fleet throughout the morning's operations.|$|E
5|$|After a {{telephone}} discussion with a Casper weather briefer, Reid decided to <b>take</b> <b>off</b> despite the worsening {{conditions at the}} airport, {{and to try to}} escape the poor weather by turning immediately eastward. He decided to file a visual flight rules (VFR) flight plan, and depart under VFR, to be better able to cope with the heavy weather in his immediate takeoff path and the vicinity of the airport.|$|E

5|$|After {{considerable}} construction {{effort in}} the face of wet weather, the airbase was completed and proved useful. Whereas the base at Nadzab was surrounded by mountains and was therefore unsuited for missions that had to <b>take</b> <b>off</b> after dark, there was no such problem at Saidor. During March 1944, B-24 Liberator bombers staged through Saidor for night attacks on Hollandia.|$|E
5|$|By 1943, the Allies enjoyed air {{supremacy}} in North Africa. The Ju 87s ventured out in Rotte strength only, often jettisoning their bombs {{at the first}} sight of enemy aircraft. Adding to this trouble, the German fighters had only enough fuel to cover the Ju 87s on <b>take</b> <b>off,</b> their most vulnerable point. After that, the Stukas were on their own.|$|E
