5|$|Taken together, {{women are}} oftentimes seen less {{valuable}} than men. With lower {{involvement in the}} public sphere—as exemplified by the labour and political participation rates—and <b>the</b> <b>stigma</b> <b>of</b> being less valuable within a family, women face a unique form of gender discrimination.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy {{can have}} {{adverse effects on}} social and {{psychological}} well-being. These effects may include social isolation, stigmatization, or disability. They may result in lower educational achievement and worse employment outcomes. Learning disabilities are common in those with the condition, and especially among children with epilepsy. <b>The</b> <b>stigma</b> <b>of</b> epilepsy can also affect {{the families of those}} with the disorder.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, {{strong belief}} in astrology {{has led to}} {{dramatic}} changes in the fertility rate and the number of abortions in the years of Fire Horse. Adherents believe that women born in hinoeuma years are unmarriageable and bring bad luck to their father or husband. In 1966, the number of babies born in Japan dropped by over 25% as parents tried to avoid <b>the</b> <b>stigma</b> <b>of</b> having a daughter born in the hinoeuma year.|$|E
50|$|Surface {{pollination}} is more frequent, {{and appears}} to be a transitional phase between wind pollination and true hydrophily. In these the pollen floats on the surface and reaches <b>the</b> <b>stigmas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> female flowers as in Hydrilla, Callitriche, Ruppia, Zostera, Elodea. In Vallisneria the male flowers become detached and float {{on the surface of the}} water; the anthers are thus brought in contact with <b>the</b> <b>stigmas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> female flowers. Surface hydrophily has been observed in several species of Potamogeton as well as some marine species.|$|R

The author debates the definitions regarding <b>the</b> concepts <b>of</b> <b>stigma</b> and taboos and considers <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>stigma</b> on <b>the</b> stigmatised and non-stigmatised person. <b>The</b> types <b>of</b> <b>stigma</b> experienced by individuals with chronic illness are examined and <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>stigma</b> in specific gastrointestinal disorders is reviewed. The interventions {{to try to}} reduce <b>the</b> <b>stigma</b> associated with bowel function and gastrointestinal disorder are also explored. It is hoped that this article will contribute to a debate on addressing <b>the</b> issue <b>of</b> <b>stigma</b> in <b>the</b> UK...|$|R
50|$|Safranal is {{an organic}} {{compound}} isolated from saffron, the spice consisting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stigmas</b> <b>of</b> crocus flowers (Crocus sativus). It is the constituent {{primarily responsible for}} the aroma of saffron.|$|R
5|$|The ovary and {{attached}} pistil protrude {{from the top}} of the floral tube near its opening, with the receptive stigma surface toward the front. Two 1 millimeter anthers hang from recurved, 2 millimeter filaments behind the pistil. Pollinators exiting after collecting nectar from the spur brush against the anther, transferring pollen to <b>the</b> <b>stigma</b> <b>of</b> the next flower they visit. The flowers can last up to 10 days but will wilt once they are pollinated. Pollinated ovaries ripen into 5millimeter (in.) dehiscent seed capsules containing numerous 1millimeter long seeds. The chromosome count for this species is 2n=44.|$|E
5|$|A short interregnum followed, {{during which}} {{ownership}} {{was transferred to}} J.W. Skaggs. Skaggs continued to push Alexander's Democratic Party/states' rights agenda during his short five weeks at the helm. The poor economics of the weekly paper were unchanged, however, and Skaggs immediately moved to unload his newly acquired white elephant. He cut his losses and avoided <b>the</b> <b>stigma</b> <b>of</b> financial failure for himself and the conservative political movement by giving away the paper outright to two men who worked for him as printers, William Thompson and William Victor. According to Thompson's later recollection, Skaggs sweetened the transfer of ownership by tossing in two bundles of paper and two cords of firewood for the new owners.|$|E
5|$|Chad Harris-Crane is {{the main}} love {{interest}} and later husband of Whitney Russell; {{he is also the}} father of Miles Davis Harris-Crane and another child. Chad's early appearances focus on his search for his biological parents, and his love triangle with sisters Whitney and Simone. Chad is initially believed to be Eve and Julian's child, which would make his relationship with Whitney incestuous. Chad's birth certificate later proves he was conceived when Alistair Crane raped Eve's adoptive sister Liz Sanbourne. He reunites with Whitney without <b>the</b> <b>stigma</b> <b>of</b> incest. During his separation from Whitney, Chad initiates a sexual relationship with Vincent Clarkson and continues it after his marriage. He is unaware he is committing incest because he is Vincent's half-uncle, adoptive half-cousin, and half-brother-in-law. After catching Chad having sex with Vincent, Whitney files for divorce; they later begin to reconcile through helping Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald and Ethan Winthrop reunite as a couple. Their potential reconciliation is cut short when Chad is murdered by Alistair.|$|E
50|$|The artist Botticelli was an Italian who was persecuted for his “condition:” {{he was a}} homosexual, and {{maintained}} relationships with his assistants. Unfortunately, Botticelli was a victim, and suffered <b>the</b> <b>stigmas</b> <b>of</b> homosexuality.|$|R
50|$|Species exhibiting true {{submerged}} hydrophily include Najas, {{where the}} pollen grains are heavier than water, and sinking down are caught by <b>the</b> <b>stigmas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extremely simple female flowers, Posidonia australis and Zostera marina.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>stigmas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> short-styled form {{are seated}} beneath the anthers, {{and they are}} {{considerably}} shorter {{than those of the}} long-styled form. This latter difference is the most important one of any between the two forms.|$|R
5|$|Flowers change sex {{in their}} development, so the stamens release their pollen before <b>the</b> <b>stigma</b> <b>of</b> the same flower is receptive. The {{arrangement}} is centripetal, meaning the oldest flowers {{are near the}} edge and the youngest flowers are in the center. Flowers usually first open at {{the outer edge of}} the primary umbel, followed about a week later on the secondary umbels, and then in subsequent weeks in higher-order umbels. The usual flowering period of individual umbels is 7 to 10 days, so a plant can be in the process of flowering for 30–50 days. The distinctive umbels and floral nectaries attract pollinating insects. After fertilization and as seeds develop, the outer umbellets of an umbel bend inward causing the umbel shape to change from slightly convex or fairly flat to concave, and when cupped it resembles a bird's nest.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{campaign}} issue was the ongoing Black Patch Tobacco Wars. Hager carried <b>the</b> <b>stigma</b> <b>of</b> being the hand-picked candidate of Governor Beckham, who had largely ignored the violence during his administration. On the other hand, Willson had twice represented the American Tobacco Company, whose business practices were {{the reason for}} farmers' discontent and violence. Democrats made much of this issue, and Willson did little to counter accusations that he was unsympathetic {{to the plight of}} the farmers. Hager tried to appeal to both sides of the conflict, but ultimately lost the support of both. Willson's position appealed to urban voters who wanted the state's reputation for violence to end even if it meant siding with the tobacco industry against the state's farmers.|$|E
5|$|Without {{a steady}} income, his {{financial}} situation began to deteriorate. He began submitting his poems to more prominent literary magazines, including Scribner's Monthly, but {{was informed that}} although he showed promise, his work was still short of the standards required for use in their publications. Locally, he was still dealing with <b>the</b> <b>stigma</b> <b>of</b> the Poe plot. The Indianapolis Journal and other newspapers refused to accept his poetry, leaving Riley desperate for income. In January 1878 {{on the advice of}} a friend, Riley paid an entrance fee to join a traveling lecture circuit where he could give poetry readings. In exchange, he received a portion of the profit his performances earned. Such circuits were popular at the time, and Riley quickly earned a local reputation for his entertaining readings.|$|E
50|$|Protogynous: (of dichogamous plants) having female {{parts of}} flowers {{developed}} before male parts, e.g. having flowers that function first as female and then change to male or producing pollen after <b>the</b> <b>stigmas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same plant are receptive.|$|R

60|$|In {{the case}} of L. perenne, affairs are {{arranged}} more perfectly; for the stamens in the two forms stand at different heights, so that pollen from the anthers of the longer stamens will adhere to one part of an insect's body, and will afterwards be brushed off by <b>the</b> rough <b>stigmas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> longer pistils; whilst pollen from the anthers of the shorter stamens will adhere to {{a different part of}} the insect's body, and will afterwards be brushed off by <b>the</b> <b>stigmas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shorter pistils; and this is what is required for the legitimate fertilisation of both forms. The corolla of L. perenne is more expanded than that of L. grandiflorum, and <b>the</b> <b>stigmas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> long-styled form do not diverge greatly from one another; nor do the stamens of either form. Hence insects, especially rather small ones, will not insert their proboscides between <b>the</b> <b>stigmas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> long-styled form, nor between the anthers of either form (Figure 3.5), but will strike against them, at nearly right angles, with the backs of their head or thorax. Now, in the long-styled flowers, if each stigma did not rotate on its axis, insects in visiting them would strike their heads against the backs of the stigmas; as it is, they strike against that surface which is covered with papillae, with their heads already charged with pollen from the stamens of corresponding height borne by the flowers of the other form, and legitimate fertilisation is thus ensured.|$|R
5|$|After Paul Nemenyi died in 1952, Regina Fischer wrote {{a letter}} to Nemenyi's first son, Peter, asking if Paul had left money for Bobby in his will:Bobby was sick 2 days with fever and sore throat and of course a doctor or {{medicine}} was out of the question. I don't think Paul would have wanted to leave Bobby this way and would ask you most urgently to let me know if Paul left anything for Bobby. On one occasion, Regina told a social worker that the last time she had ever seen Hans-Gerhardt Fischer was in 1939, four years before Bobby was born. On another occasion, she told the same social worker she had traveled to Mexico to see Hans-Gerhardt in June 1942 and that Bobby was conceived during that meeting. According to Bobby Fischer's brother-in-law, Russell Targ, who was married to Bobby's half-sister, Joan, for 40 years, Regina concealed the fact that Nemenyi was Bobby's father because she wanted to avoid <b>the</b> <b>stigma</b> <b>of</b> an out-of-wedlock birth.|$|E
5|$|Dallas {{was born}} Constance Hopkins Snow on April 28, 1902, in Brooklyn Heights, New York, the {{daughter}} of Henry Sanger Snow and Anna LeConte Brooks. Henry Snow was a lawyer who worked as the treasurer of the New York & New Jersey Telephone Сompany. Brooks was originally from Philadelphia, {{the daughter of}} inventor David Brooks, and had {{served as president of}} the Daughters of the American Revolution. Constance was the youngest of the Snow children, born when her mother was forty-seven years old. She had three older siblings: Marion, Edward, and Anna. After Henry Snow was indicted for grand larceny concerning his former employers in 1908, he fled the city, leaving his family destitute. With some financial assistance from Andrew Carnegie, a friend of David Brooks, the family moved to Europe, where accommodations were cheaper and the family could be free of <b>the</b> <b>stigma</b> <b>of</b> Henry's crimes. While there, Constance was educated in convent schools in Belgium. When the family returned to the United States, they settled in Philadelphia and Snow attended Germantown Friends School. She later studied nursing at the University of Pennsylvania, and she served in the Cadet Nurse Corps during World War II.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Eve's vengeful adoptive sister Liz Sanbourne {{arranges}} for Eve's past {{relationship with}} Julian {{to be exposed}} to the Russell family and the rest of Harmony, resulting in Chad being erroneously identified as their son. From this point on, the apparently incestuous relationship between Chad and Whitney becomes one of the primary storylines on Passions. Whitney discovers that she is pregnant with Chad's child. She initiates a relationship with Fox Crane to be able to insinuate that he is the father and protect herself, and her child, from <b>the</b> <b>stigma</b> <b>of</b> incest. She gives birth to a son and immediately uses her then-boyfriend Fox Crane's power of attorney to put him up for adoption. Two couples—Julian and Eve, and T.C. and Liz—compete to adopt the boy, but Chad is awarded custody of the child. He attempts to use the child to reconnect with Whitney. Whitney and Chad name their baby Miles Davis Harris after jazz musician Miles Davis. During the show's 2005 summertime extravaganza, Whitney has sex with Chad {{in the middle of a}} tsunami and admits to Chad that he is Miles' biological father. Identified as the Vendetta plot, the show's 2006 summertime extravaganza centers on Alistair Crane luring Whitney, Chad, and several other residents of Harmony, to Rome. While in Rome, Chad is given his birth certificate by tabloid editor JT Cornell and discovers that he was conceived during Alistair's rape of Liz. Following the revelation of his true paternity, Chad marries Whitney and they decide to raise their son together, and rename him Miles Harris-Crane.|$|E

5|$|On July 3, Pemberton sent {{a note to}} Grant {{regarding}} the possibility of negotiations for peace. Grant, {{as he had done}} at Fort Donelson, first demanded unconditional surrender. But Grant reconsidered, not wanting to feed 30,000 hungry Confederates in Union prison camps, and offered to parole all prisoners. Considering their destitute state, dejected and starving, he never expected them to fight again; he hoped they would carry home <b>the</b> <b>stigma</b> <b>of</b> defeat {{to the rest of the}} Confederacy. In any event, it would have occupied his army and taken months to ship that many prisoners north. Pemberton officially surrendered his army on July 4. Most of the men who were paroled on July 6 were exchanged and received back into the Confederate Army on August 4, 1863, at Mobile Harbor, Alabama. They were back in Chattanooga, Tennessee, by September and some fought in the Battles for Chattanooga in November and against Sherman's invasion of Georgia in May 1864. The Confederate government protested the validity of the paroles on technical grounds and the issue was referred to Grant who, in April 1864, was general in chief of the Army. The dispute effectively ended all further prisoner exchanges during the war except for hardship cases.|$|E
