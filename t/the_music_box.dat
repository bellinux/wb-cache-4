5|$|Jill {{is later}} kidnapped by Colin, who is {{revealed}} {{to have been}} released from jail. He blackmails her into remarrying him as he alludes that he has information on <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>box</b> that Katherine once told him. However, his information ends up being a dead end. After Colin's lies are exposed, Jill locks him in the attic and refuses to let him out until he owns up to his lies, which he eventually does and they patch things up. Almost a year after Katherine's death, Jill finds her most expensive jewelry to have been hidden in a chandelier at the Chancellor Estate. Enclosed with a note, Katherine left them there for Jill to find before her death as they are worth a significant amount. However, the meaning of <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>box</b> continues to remain unknown to everyone. Afterward, all of Katherine's loved ones receive letters from her that were to be delivered on the one-year anniversary of her death. She also asks them to throw a party and celebrate, which they do. Once the party in the park is finished, Jill leaves <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>box</b> there, only {{for it to be}} stolen by an unidentified person. Jill and Colin return soon after to find the box missing, but Colin convinces her to finally let go of it.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} snuff {{boxes were}} tiny containers which could {{fit into a}} gentleman's waistcoat pocket. <b>The</b> <b>music</b> <b>boxes</b> could have any size {{from that of a}} hat box to a large piece of furniture, but most were tabletop specimens. They were usually powered by clockwork and originally produced by artisan watchmakers. For most of the 19th century, <b>the</b> bulk of <b>music</b> <b>box</b> production was concentrated in Switzerland, building upon a strong watchmaking tradition. <b>The</b> first <b>music</b> <b>box</b> factory was opened there in 1815 by Jérémie Recordon and Samuel Junod. There were also a few manufacturers in Bohemia and Germany. By the end of the 19th century, some of the European makers had opened factories in the United States.|$|R

He stands {{in silence for}} a moment and then turns to leave, but stops upon noticing a fresh red rose with a black ribbon tied around the stem lying on the ground with Christine's {{engagement}} ring attached to it; implying that the Phantom still lives and still loves Christine.|$|E
5|$|Screen {{time was}} divided up equally between the couples {{over the course}} of an episode, though {{occasionally}} some scenes would run longer; in Series 4, Episode 3, the scenes of Karen clubbing went on for ten uninterrupted minutes. These scenes were also a rarity for location filming; usually filming in public places was done on a Sunday during closing hours but the clubbing scenes in this episode were filmed during opening hours at <b>the</b> <b>Music</b> <b>Box</b> in Manchester. A hand-held camera was used to enhance the frenetic pace.|$|E
5|$|The {{aftermath}} of the blast makes Rei realize that he was human all along, and that {{everyone else in the}} town were Phiroids. After collecting some supplies, the three of them leave the town and make it to the facility where Rei originally woke up, which still has some electricity. Tipi gives Rei access to an electronic library on a tablet shortly before her battery is no longer able to function. Rei and Shiona stay in the facility for a time until Shiona eventually succumbs to the gunshot wound which had damaged her internal components. Rei puts Shiona and Tipi in cryogenic pods before leaving with <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>box</b> in an attempt to find a world where humans and Phiroids can coexist. Sometime later, Shiona wakes up in a facility with her memories wiped, but she is told that there was a music box with her when she was found. The environment has recovered and human civilization is once again prosperous and highly technological. Shiona is taken back to the town where humans and Phiroids once again coexist. She is reunited with Tipi, who also had her memories wiped. Prompted by the tune playing from <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>box,</b> Shiona sings the song which is now known worldwide.|$|E

5|$|To {{promote the}} album, Carey {{embarked}} {{on her first}} headlining concert tour, <b>the</b> <b>Music</b> <b>Box</b> Tour. Due to stage fright, Carey had not toured to promote her previous albums and did not originally plan a tour to support Music Box. However, after the continued success of the album and persuasion from Tommy Mottola, Carey agreed. Because Carey did not feel physically or emotionally ready for an extensive tour, six concerts were scheduled, each with many days in between, {{in order to give}} her voice time to rest. An extra performance at Proctor's Theatre was planned; there, Carey filmed the one-hour special Here Is Mariah Carey for release during the Christmas season.|$|E
5|$|Steiger {{made his}} stage debut in a {{production}} of Curse you, Jack Dalton! (1946) at the Civic Repertory Theatre of Newark. Subsequent to this, he received an invitation {{from one of his}} teachers, Daniel Mann, to attend the Actors Studio, established by Elia Kazan in October 1947. It was here, along with Marlon Brando, Karl Malden and Eli Wallach, that he studied method acting, which became deeply engrained in him. Lacking matinée idol looks, much like Malden and Wallach, he began pursuing a career as a character actor rather than as a leading man. Steiger's stage work continued in 1950, with a minor role as a townperson in a stage production of An Enemy of the People at <b>the</b> <b>Music</b> <b>Box</b> Theatre. His first major role on Broadway came in Clifford Odets's production of Night Music (1951), where he played A. L. Rosenberger. The play was held at the ANTA Playhouse. The following year, he played a telegraphist in the play Seagulls Over Sorrento, performed at the John Golden Theatre beginning on September 11, 1952.|$|E

25|$|The scenic {{stage was}} {{probably}} some 50’ deep and 30’ high. The proscenium arch {{may have been}} some 30’ wide and at least 25’ high to accommodate the scenery in operas such as Dioclesian, The Fairy-Queen, or The World in the Moon. Both the forestage and the scenic stage were raked. <b>The</b> <b>music</b> <b>box</b> above the proscenium arch could hold perhaps 8 to 10 musicians, to provide incidental music. A full orchestra would be sitting in the pit, {{just in front of the}} stage.|$|E
