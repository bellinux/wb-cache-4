50|$|Charles (Boss) Kettering, vice {{president}} of General Motors Research Corporation, was seeking a refrigerant replacement that would be colorless, odorless, tasteless, nontoxic, and nonflammable. He assembled a team that included Thomas Midgley, Jr., Albert Leon Henne, and Robert McNary. From 1930 to 1935, they developed dichlorodifluoromethane (CCl2F2 or R12), trichlorofluoromethane (CCl3F or R11), chlorodifluoromethane (CHClF2 or R22), <b>trichlorotrifluoroethane</b> (CCl2FCClF2 or R113), and dichlorotetrafluoroethane (CClF2CClF2 or R114), through Kinetic Chemicals which was {{a joint venture between}} DuPont and General Motors.|$|E
50|$|<b>Trichlorotrifluoroethane,</b> {{also called}} 1,1,2-Trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane or CFC-113 is a chlorofluorocarbon. It has the formula Cl2FC-CClF2. This colorless gas is a {{versatile}} solvent. It has {{attracted much attention}} for {{its role in the}} depletion of stratospheric ozone. The amount of CFC-113 in the atmosphere has remained at about 80 parts per trillion, since the early 1990s. It is isomeric with 1,1,1-Trichloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane, known as CFC-113a, which has the structural formula CF3-CCl3. The Montreal Protocol in 1987 called for the phase out of all CFCâ€™s, including CFC-113 by 2010.|$|E

40|$|Researchers at NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) {{investigated}} several {{alternatives to}} the use of <b>trichlorotrifluoroethane</b> (CFC 113) in oxygen cleaning and verification. Options included several replacement solvents, Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) and Total Organic Carbon (TOC) analysis. Among the solvents, 1, 1 -dichloro- 1 -fluoroethane (HCFC 141 b) and dichloropentafluoropropane (HCFC 225) are the most suitable alternatives for cleaning and verification. However, use of HCFC 141 b is restricted, HCFC 225 introduces toxicity hazards, and the NDE and TOC methods of verification are not suitable for processes at LaRC. Therefore, the interim recommendation is to sparingly use CFC 113 for the very difficult cleaning tasks where safety is critical and to move to an aqueous-based cleaning system for components. Meanwhile, evaluation must continue on new solvents and procedures to find one suited to LaRC's oxygen cleaning needs.

The bearings were maintained in a preloaded state in bearing cartridges during cycling and vibration tests. Bearings with electrophoretically deposited MoS{sub 2 } performed as well as bearings lubricated with Vydax and were the best performing candidate. All candidates were suitable for low preload applications. Bearings with TiC coated balls and bearings lubricated with sputtered MoS{sub 2 } on the races and retainers performed well at high preloads, though not as well as bearings lubricated with electrophoretic deposition of MoS{sub 2 }.

Hybrid duplex bearings with silicon nitride balls and molded glass-nylon-Teflon retainers, duplex bearings lubricated with sputtered MoS{sub 2 } on races and retainers, and duplex bearings lubricated with electrophoretic deposited MoS{sub 2 } were evaluated. Bearings with electrophoretic deposited MoS{sub 2 } performed as well as bearings with Freon deposition of PTFE from Freon-based Vydax. Hybrid bearings with silicon nitride balls performed worse than bearings lubricated with Vydax, but their performance would still be acceptable for most applications. Bearings lubricated with sputtered MoS{sub 2 } on the races and retainers had varying amounts of film on the bearings. This affected the performance of the bearings. Bearings with a uniform coating performed to acceptable levels, but bearings with no visible MoS{sub 2 } on the races and retainers did not perform as well as bearings with the other coatings. Unless process controls are incorporated in the sputtering process or the bearings are screened, they do not appear to be acceptable for duplex bearing applications...|$|E
40|$|The {{inception}} of bubbles during forced convection was studied experimentally by using <b>trichlorotrifluoroethane</b> (R- 113 or Freon- 113).

40|$|A {{method for}} the {{detection}} of Norwalk virus and hepatitis A virus from shellfish tissues by PCR was developed. Virus was added to the stomach and hepatopancreatic tissues of oysters or hard-shell clams, and viral nucleic acids were purified by a modification of a previously described method (R. L. Atmar, T. G. Metcalf, F. H. Neill, and M. K. Estes, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 59 : 631 - 635, 1993). The new method had the following advantages compared with the previously described method: (i) more rapid sample processing; (ii) increased test sensitivity; (iii) decreased sample-associated interference with reverse transcription-PCR; and (iv) use of chloroform-butanol in place of the chlorofluorocarbon <b>trichlorotrifluoroethane.</b> In addition, internal standards for both Norwalk virus and hepatitis A virus were made which demonstrated when inhibitors to reverse transcription-PCR were present and allowed quantitation of the viral nucleic acids present in samples.

Hexafluoroethane and an isomeric mixture of <b>trichlorotrifluoroethane</b> were obtained as by-products. The latter was recycled with unconverted C 2 Cl 2 F 4 for further fluorination. Both conversion of C 2 Cl 2 F 4 and selectivity {{to the formation of}} C 2 ClF 5 were affected by temperature, contact time and molar ratio of the reagents. The catalytic activity of chromic oxide was adversely affected by small amounts of water in the hydrogen fluoride. A difference was also observed in the reactivity of the two isomersCCl 2 Fî—¸CF 3 and CClF 2 î—¸OClF 2 The formation of C 2 Cl 3 F 3 as a by-product was due to the disproportionating activity of chromic oxide upon C 2 Cl 2 F 4...|$|E
30|$|CFC {{samples were}} {{analysed}} at the Spurenstofflabor Dr. Harald Oster (Wachenheim, Germany). The water samples were analysed for trichlorofluoromethane (CFC- 11), CFC- 12 and <b>trichlorotrifluoroethane</b> (CFC- 113) using purge and trap gas chromatography with an electron capture detector. The measurements generally are performed by direct injection of about 20 Â mL {{of water to}} the stripping chamber. A transfer gas is used to extract the CFCs from the water sample. The reconstruction {{of the age of}} the water is based on the historic data of atmospheric CFC concentrations. The concentrations in the sample are determined by atmospheric CFC concentrations and Henry's law describing the proportionality of gas dissolution to its partial pressure. An altitude of 1, 100 Â mÂ a.s.l. with an annual mean temperature of 6 Â°C was assumed according to the weather history at the study area. Furthermore, the salinity of the water samples was taken into account for the descriptions of distinct input functions for the area of recharge. These distinct input functions are integrated in a lumped parameter program using the exponential model after Malloszewski and Zuber (1992).|$|E

Bacteriol. 88 : 559 â€“ 565. 1964. â€”Through {{a series}} of chemical fractionation steps, the extracellular hemolysin of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was purified 126 -fold with a recovery of 49 %. Hemolytic activity of crude preparations was irreversibly lost upon contact with anionic exchange materials such as diethylaminoethyl Sephadex or ECTEOLA-Cellulose, but traveled with the solvent front during passage through Sephadex G- 200 and carboxymethyl Sephadex. The hemolysin was soluble in water and ethanol, and was partially extractable with ether, but not with <b>trichlorotrifluoroethane</b> (Freon). Although normal serum and serum albumin blocked hemolytic activity, it was unaffected by trypsin, deoxyribonuclease, or ribonuclease. Partially purified hemolysin was studied in vivo, but did not exert dermonecrotic activity in mice or rabbits in the concentrations tested. Although preparations were toxic to mice, lethality appeared to be more {{a reflection of the}} nonhemolytic protein content of the preparations rather than of hemolytic activity...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{solutions}} were extracted by immiscible liquid displacement with <b>trichlorotrifluoroethane</b> and by centrifuge drainage from {{surface and}} subsoil samples having {{a wide range}} of chemical and physical properties. Extractions were performed on field-moist samples and on air-dry samples which were re-wetted to different matric suctions and for different lengths of time. The composition of the soil solution obtained was the same with both methods of extraction when samples had been pre-wet to a matric suction of 0. 1 bar. Immiscible liquid displacement extracted solution from a krasnozem surface soil at suctions as great as 15 bar; in contrast, centrifuge drainage failed to extract solution from this soil at > 3 bar. The concentration of ions in solutions extracted by displacement from soils with increasing matric suction rose to a far greater extent than that anticipated if concentration was the only mechanism operating. In re-wet air-dry samples, major cations and anions were at equilibrium levels in solution after incubation for 1 day; longer incubation times resulted in an artificial elevation of ionic strength through mineralization of organic matter in some surface samples. The levels achieved after 1 day were similar to those present in solutions extracted from field-moist samples...|$|E
40|$|Wastes {{containing}} solvents {{from the}} dry cleaning industry are considered hazardous. As a result, {{the industry has}} made significant improvements in the equipment {{in order to minimize}} employee exposure and to reduce release of solvents to the environment. Changes have also been made in the type of solvent used. Because of environmental concerns, use of <b>trichlorotrifluoroethane</b> (freon) and 1, 1,l-trichloroethane (TCA) is being phased out and the use of petroleum solvents is being reduced. At present, perchloroethylene (PERC) is the predominant solvent being used. However, efforts are continuing to develop better, less hazardous solvents. Because of concerns relative to the solvents involved, modifications {{have been made in the}} design of dry cleaning equipment to reduce solvent consumption, waste production and employee exposure to solvent fumes. The reduction in solvent use with the newer equipment is apparent from the results of this survey. Unfortunately, the cost of equipment limits the ability of the smaller dry cleaning establishments to upgrade to newer equipment. This is further complicated by the fact that some equipment is solvent specific, thereby, limiting flexibility. Wastes containing solvents from the dry cleaning process should be handled as hazardous. Because of the quantities or concentrations involved, some of these wastes may be disposed o...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to experimentally determine the operating {open_quotes}window{close_quotes} for an oxygen plasma cleaning process to be used on microelectronics components just prior to wire bonding. The process was being developed to replace one that used vapor degreasing with <b>trichlorotrifluoroethane,</b> an ozone-depleting substance. A Box-Behnken experimental design was used to generate data from which the oxygen plasma cleaning process could be characterized. Auger electron spectrophotometry was used to measure the contamination thickness on the dice after cleaning. An empirical equation correlating the contamination thickness on the die surface with the operating parameters of the plasma system was developed from the collected Auger data, and optimum settings for cleaning semiconductor devices were determined. Devices were also tested for undesirable changes in electrical parameters resulting from cleaning in the plasma system. An increase in leakage current occurred for bipolar transistors and diodes after exposure to the oxygen plasma. Although an increase in leakage current occurred, each device`s parameter remained well below the acceptable specification limit. Based upon the experimental results, the optimum settings for the plasma cleaning process were determined to be 200 watts of power applied for five minutes in an enclosure maintained at 0. 7 torr. At these settings, all measurable contamination was removed without compromising the reliability of the devices...|$|E
