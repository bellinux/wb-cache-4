40|$|Spectrum {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{precious}} radio resource. With the increasing demand for wireless communication, efficiently using the spectrum resource has become an essential issue. With the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) spectrum policy reform, secondary spectrum sharing has gained increasing interest. One of the policy reforms introduces the concept of an interference temperature—the <b>total</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>interference</b> in a spectral band. This means that secondary users can use different transmit powers as long as the sum of these power is less than the interference threshold. In this paper, we study two problems in secondary spectrum access with minimum signal to interference noise ratio (quality of service (QoS)) guarantee under an interference temperature constraint. First, when all the secondary links can be supported, a non-linear optimization problem with the objective to maximize the total transmitting rate of the secondary users is formulated. The non-linear optimization is solved efficiently using geometric programming techniques. The second problem we address is when not all the secondary links can be supported with their QoS requirement, it is desirable to have the spectrum access opportunity proportional to the user priority if they belong to different priority classes. In this context, we formulate an operator problem which takes the priority issues into consideration. To solve this problem, firstly we propose a centralized reduced complexity search algorithm to find the optimal solution. Then, in order to solve this problem distributively, we define a secondary spectrum sharing potential game. The Nash equilibria of this potential game are investigated. The efficiency of the Nash equilibria solutions are characterized. It is shown that distributed sequential play and an algorithm based on stochastic learning attain the equilibrium solutions. Finally, the performances are examined through simulations...|$|E

40|$|For cyclic prefixed single-carrier (CP-SC) {{spectrum}} sharing relaying systems, a two-hop decodeand-forward (DF) relaying protocol with {{a direct link}} and selection combining are employed in the secondary user relay network. For this cooperative CP-SC {{spectrum sharing}} system, the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio (e 2 e-SNR) is first derived, and then the outage probability performance of the secondary user relaying system is investigated. Having derived an asymptotic expression for the cumulative distribution function of the e 2 e-SNR, the asymptotic outage diversity is obtained under a limited maximum transmit power at the secondary source and relay while satisfying the maximum <b>allowable</b> <b>interference</b> at the primary user. Notably, when the maximum <b>allowable</b> <b>interference</b> is independent of a limited transmission power, an outage probability floor is observed. Moreover, under an unlimited transmit power at the secondary nodes, the asymptotic outage diversity is derived {{as a function of}} the interference. It can be seen that the same outage diversity gain can be achieved as in the non-spectrum-sharing CP-SC relaying system. Analytically derived asymptotic outage diversity gains for limited and unlimited transmission power cases are verified by Monte Carlo simulations. ...|$|R

It is found that the optimal steady state fishing mortality would be one half to one third of recent levels. For the base formulation of the model the optimal plan calls for periodic fishing, with a moratorium on fishing for the first two years, and for a very substantial catch in the third year. The sensitivity of pulse fishing as an optimal strategy is tested with respect to number of solution iterations, asymmetric charges for increasing fleet capacity, quadratic adjustment costs, harvesting stock effects, the rate of discount, and the price elasticity of demand for mackerel. dynamic programming, optimal control, western mackerel, <b>total</b> <b>allowable</b> catch, periodic fishing, Environmental Economics and Policy, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R

Heterogeneous harvest values are included by incorporating time-specific harvest costs and a stock effect into fishermen’s profit functions.

The equilibrium harvest strategies of the differential games are solved numerically {{through the use of}} a genetic algorithm. I demonstrate how different harvesting sector environments lead to varying degrees of ex-vessel price increases when IFQs are implemented. The primary result shows that possible margins for competition among fishermen, beyond competition for a greater share of the <b>total</b> <b>allowable</b> catch, can still exist under IFQ management and may be substantial enough to be able to prevent sizeable rent transfers from the processing sector to the harvesting sector. individual fishing quotas, property rights, differential games, genetic algorithm...|$|R
