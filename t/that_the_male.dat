5|$|At {{the end of}} the novel, Bambi {{meets with}} twin fawns who are calling for their mother and he scolds them {{for not being able to}} stay alone. After leaving them, he thinks to himself that the girl fawn {{reminded}} him of Faline, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> was promising and that Bambi hoped to meet him again when he was grown.|$|E
5|$|In her 2002 book Cinema of Interruptions: Action Genres in Contemporary Indian Cinema, Lalitha Gopalan noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> protagonists in Indian films use {{the piano}} {{to express their}} desire with no regard to the {{consequences}} and cited Sivaji Ganesan in Puthiya Paravai as an example for the same.|$|E
5|$|The altricial, downy chicks hatch after 33days of incubation. After hatching, {{the female}} cares for and feeds the chicks {{for the first}} 8–14days of life, and also during bad weather after <b>that.</b> <b>The</b> <b>male</b> {{provides}} food, up to six kills per day {{in the first week}} increasing to eight per day in the third and 10per day in the last week in the nest, by which time the female is also hunting.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{observed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>males</b> of some species, such as {{birds of}} paradise, {{were very different}} from the females.|$|R
50|$|The {{behaviour}} of this {{stick insect}} is highly unusual for an insect species, in <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>males</b> and females form a bond.|$|R
50|$|The Ptyctodontida {{were the}} only known group of placoderms that were recognizably sexually dimorphic, in <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>males</b> had hook-like growths on their pelvic fins that were {{analogous}} to the clasping organs found in male sharks, and chimaeras. Paleontologists believe <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>males</b> of <b>the</b> ancestral placoderm had pelvic claspers, but the claspers {{were lost in the}} evolutionary development of each of the placoderm orders, save for the ptyctodontids (there are too few whole specimens of the primitive Stensioella heintzi to tell if <b>the</b> <b>males</b> of <b>that</b> species had claspers or not).|$|R
5|$|A. Newton {{requested}} further specimens, especially males, but in 1875 {{he finally}} published {{a plate of}} the female, lamenting that no male specimens could be found. Tafforet's 1726 account had been rediscovered the previous year, and A. Newton noted that it confirmed his assumption <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> would turn out be much more colourful than the female. Newton's collector, Henry H. Slater, had seen a live Newton's parakeet the year before, but was not carrying a gun at the time. On 14 August 1875, William Vandorous shot a male specimen. It {{may have been the}} same specimen Slater had observed. It was subsequently sent to E. Newton by William J. Caldwell. This is the paratype of the species, numbered UMZC 18/Psi/67/h/2 and housed in the Cambridge Museum.|$|E
5|$|In {{temperate}} areas, {{the male}} owl moults rather {{later in the}} year than the female, {{at a time when there}} is an abundance of food, the female has recommenced hunting and the demands of the chicks are lessening. Unmated males without family responsibilities often start losing feathers earlier in the year. The moult follows a similar prolonged pattern to that of the female and the first sign <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> is moulting is often when a tail feather has been dropped at the roost. A consequence of moulting is the loss of thermal insulation. This is of little importance in the tropics and barn owls here usually moult a complete complement of flight feathers annually. The hot-climate moult may still take place over a long period but is usually concentrated at a particular time of year outside the breeding season.|$|E
5|$|The History of Animals {{contains}} many accurate eye-witness observations, in particular {{of the marine}} biology around the island of Lesbos, such as that the octopus had colour-changing abilities and a sperm-transferring tentacle, that the young of a dogfish grow inside their mother's body, or <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> of a river catfish guards the eggs after the female has left. Some of these were long considered fanciful before being rediscovered in the nineteenth century. Aristotle {{has been accused of}} making errors, but some are due to misinterpretation of his text, and others may have been based on genuine observation. He did however make somewhat uncritical use of evidence from other people, such as travellers and beekeepers.|$|E
30|$|There {{exists a}} {{definite}} gender and growth {{variation in the}} PBT and PBD {{in different parts of}} the palate. Palatal bone thickness between <b>the</b> <b>males</b> and females revealed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>males</b> had significantly higher PBT than the females.|$|R
50|$|A very {{spectacular}} {{trait of}} this pigeon is also <b>the</b> fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>males</b> (<b>the</b> cocks), besides normal cooing, open up their wings in a V-shape, spread their tail feathers and swallow a little air (but {{not as much}} as cropper pigeons) in order to either impress the hens or intimidate <b>the</b> other <b>males.</b>|$|R
50|$|Upperside: {{slightly}} paler brown. Forewing: {{the cell}} and apex darker; a white spot similar to <b>that</b> in <b>the</b> <b>male</b> but larger, beyond {{the apex of}} the cell; in most specimens extended diffusely outwards and downwards. Hindwing: similar to <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> <b>male.</b> Underside: precisely as in <b>the</b> <b>male.</b>|$|R
5|$|This puffin has a black {{crown and}} back, pale grey cheek patches and white underparts. Its broad, boldly marked {{red and black}} beak and orange legs {{contrast}} with its plumage. It moults while at sea {{in the winter and}} some of the bright-coloured facial characteristics are lost. The external appearance of the adult male and female are identical except <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> is usually slightly larger. The juvenile has similar plumage but its cheek patches are dark grey. The juvenile does not have brightly coloured head ornamentation, its bill is less broad and is dark-grey with a yellowish-brown tip, and its legs and feet are also dark. Puffins from northern populations are typically larger than their counterparts in southern parts of the range. It is generally considered that these populations are different subspecies.|$|E
5|$|When Charles II was {{restored}} to the throne in 1660, Bennett was removed from his post as constable. He was initially replaced by Thomas Rosse and then, in 1661, by Philip Piper. A gaol {{was built in the}} centre of the bailey in the late-17th century; it was bought by the constable and was adopted as the county gaol. In 1690, the county complained to the King that the constable, Sir Hugh Pyper, had allowed it to fall into disrepair and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> and female prisoners were sleeping together in the same quarters. Two years later, the Crown granted the post of constable in perpetuity to Hugh and for two generations after him; in exchange, Hugh agreed to invest £120 in repairing the facility. The bailey was also used for carrying out executions.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} ways in which this biparental sex role specialization can be influenced was studied by manipulating the presence and absence of the mate as well as the presence and absence of an intruder. The former variable was considered because the specialization of parental roles only occurs when both parents are present, while the latter variable was considered because it is thought that biparental care in these cichlids was an evolutionary consequence of the protection of offspring from intruders. When both mates are present with no intruder, both parents may stay with the offspring by resembling single parents because each parent is addressing only the offspring and not its mate, or one parent may be concentrated on activities associated with the offspring while the other parent concentrates on patrolling and defending the area. Under these isolated conditions, a more equal sharing of parental behaviors tends to occur. However, when both mates are present and an intruder is introduced, the male spends more time chasing intruders while the female remains with the offspring more. When the intruder is present but a parent is by itself, the widowed male tends to leave the offspring unattended and instead attacks the intruder or predator. Therefore, the conclusive finding is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> rarely remains with the offspring when the female is absent, and the female rarely confronts the intruder when the male is absent.|$|E
50|$|The strong jaws, sharp, hooked canines and {{triangular}} molars {{that form}} a shearing edge typical of other mesonychids suggest that A. saurognathus was a hypercarnivorous apex predator. The massive molars of <b>the</b> <b>males</b> suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>males</b> were also scavengers that ate bones.|$|R
2500|$|The bats start hunting {{a little}} before sunset, and they fly {{relatively}} slowly. [...] It was measured <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>males</b> fly at approximately 9.76km/h and the females fly at about 9.14km/h.|$|R

5|$|Having {{escaped the}} {{buildings}} {{in a variety}} of ways (including through doors and out of windows), some students found themselves impeded by a river that adjoined the school. However, some were able to use rowing boats as a means of escape. Saari started fires at several other locations within the school buildings, and the fire in the exam room damaged some of the bodies so badly that they had to be identified from DNA and dental records. Nine of the victims were found in the exam room, and one in a nearby corridor. It was later ascertained that this student had fled the burning classroom and then died in the corridor. Eight of the victims were female students, one a male student, and one a male member of staff. All of the students killed were in their 20s, and the teacher was in his 50s. A 21-year-old woman was shot in the head but had two operations in the days after sustaining her injury, and was reported as being in a satisfactory condition. A further ten students were treated for minor injuries including sprains and cuts from broken glass. All the victims were classmates of Saari's. Saari was originally from Pohjois-Pohjanmaa, but lived in Kauhajoki where he was enrolled on his catering course at the college. It was later revealed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> student was probably a close friend of Saari's. The pair had spent an evening out together in February 2008 when they were threatened with a starter pistol. A photo of them together had been circulating on the Internet, in which Saari jokingly points at his friend's head with his forefinger. The names of the other victims were withheld by police.|$|E
25|$|Typically, {{even his}} first {{research}} paper, was to describe something unusually interesting, namely <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> of the echiuroid worm exhibits {{a greater degree}} of degeneration than other species, the tissues fusing with those of its female partner and the host.|$|E
25|$|The Parnassius {{butterflies}} {{also have}} a peculiar reproductive strategy in <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> has special accessory glands that produce a mating plug that seals the female genitalia after mating. This is believed to ensure {{the success of the}} male and to prevent other males from mating and avoids sperm competition.|$|E
50|$|Evidence {{of sexual}} {{dimorphism}} comes from <b>the</b> fact <b>that</b> some jawbones were larger, {{and had more}} massive molar teeth better suited to crushing bones than other jawbones, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>males</b> crushed bones.|$|R
5000|$|The bats start hunting {{a little}} before sunset, and they fly {{relatively}} slowly. [...] It was measured <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>males</b> fly at approximately 9.76 km/h and the females fly at about 9.14 km/h.|$|R
50|$|Although {{when the}} females are fertile is unknown, {{it is known}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>males</b> are usually in {{breeding}} condition from July to September. It is likely that {{both males and females}} incubate the eggs.|$|R
25|$|Unlike other pintails, {{the males}} {{are similar in}} {{appearance}} to the females, though larger. The ducks are 45 to 65cm in length, the males weighing 610 to 660 g, the females 460 to 610 g. Minor differences are <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> has uniformly brownish-grey upperwing coverts and a glossy greenish-black speculum, while the female has mottled upperwing coverts and a dull brown speculum.|$|E
25|$|The {{ancient world}} {{had no idea}} that male semen and female ovum were both needed to form a fetus; instead they thought <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> {{contribution}} in reproduction consisted of some sort of formative or generative principle. According {{to the understanding of the}} time, Mary's bodily fluids would provide all the matter that was needed for Jesus' bodily form, including his male sex.|$|E
25|$|The bill is straight, bluish grey, {{and lined}} with red. The final third along the bill length is dark maroon. The iris is lemon-yellow or cream {{white and the}} legs are purplish red. The skin of the throat and the pebbly-textured lores are orangey red, {{becoming}} deeper red during courtship. The sexes are largely indistinguishable externally, except <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> is slightly larger with a slightly upward curved bill. Individuals usually weigh 4200-3800g, with males being heavier.|$|E
50|$|B. J. Kaston distinguishes R. rabida from R. punctulata {{by observing}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>males</b> of <b>the</b> former have front legs that are mostly black, whereas the latter have all {{legs of the}} same color.|$|R
50|$|One notable feature about Baculites is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>males</b> {{may have}} been a third to a half the size of the females and may have had much lighter ribbing {{on the surface of the}} shell.|$|R
5000|$|This Australian {{species is}} easily {{recognized}} by the characteristic 5-8 cm long orange-red beak, slender pink legs and black and white plumage. [...] With the wings extended, a white wing-stripe is also visible. <b>The</b> <b>male</b> and female show little differentiation, except <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>males</b> generally sport a shorter, wider beak.|$|R
25|$|Gender {{disparity}} is also {{visible in}} the education of children with disabilities, a study in the 1990s revealed that only 37% of disabled females are literate compared to 57% for males. A reason for this situation is the cultural notion <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> will carry the family name while the female will marry. Also the option of street begging by young disabled girls in order to earn income can inhibit their attendance of classes.|$|E
25|$|While Hatshepsut was {{depicted}} in official art wearing regalia of a pharaoh, {{such as the}} false beard that male pharaohs also wore, it is most unlikely that she ever wore such ceremonial decorations, {{just as it is}} unlikely <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> pharaohs did. Statues such as those at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, depicting her seated wearing a tight-fitting dress and the nemes crown, are thought to be a more accurate representation of how she would have presented herself at court.|$|E
25|$|Parasitism {{has been}} {{suggested}} {{as part of the}} explanation of the evolution of secondary sex characteristics in breeding male animals, such as the plumage of peacocks and the manes of male lions. The argument is that female hosts select males for breeding based on such characteristics because they act as honest signals of costly handicaps. A possible mechanism for this, suggested by Ivar Folstad and Andrew Karter, is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> hormone testosterone encourages the growth of secondary sex characteristics such as manes, but at the price of reducing an animal's immune defences.|$|E
50|$|Stibadocera is a genus of crane fly in {{the family}} Tipulidae. Stibadocera are unusual for crane flies in <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>males</b> have very long antenna, {{sometimes}} {{as long as the}} body. Most species are very small (6-10 mm).|$|R
50|$|Female upperside: {{similar to}} <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> <b>male,</b> but <b>the</b> violaceous area on both {{forewings}} and hindwings of much greater extent. Underside: also similar to <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> <b>male,</b> but <b>the</b> ground colour brighter with {{a tinge of}} yellow; the markings more ochraceous than brown, more conspicuous and prominent. Antenna, head, thorax and abdomen as in <b>the</b> <b>male</b> but paler.|$|R
25|$|Both sexes are brightly {{coloured}} with black, green, yellow, and red markings. The females {{tend to be}} less brightly coloured. One {{major difference}} between <b>the</b> sexes is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>male's</b> chest is purple, while the female's is a lighter mauve.|$|R
