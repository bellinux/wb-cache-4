5|$|Given {{that the}} Parliament does not form <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{traditional}} {{sense of a}} Parliamentary system, its politics have developed along more consensual lines rather than majority rule of competing parties and coalitions. Indeed, for much of its life it {{has been dominated by}} a grand coalition of the European People's Party and the Party of European Socialists. The two major parties tend to co-operate to find a compromise between their two groups leading to proposals endorsed by huge majorities. However, this does not always produce agreement, and each may instead try to build other alliances, the EPP normally with other centre-right or right wing Groups and the PES with centre-left or left wing Groups. Sometimes, the Liberal Group is then in the pivotal position. There are also occasions where very sharp party political divisions have emerged, for example over the resignation of the Santer Commission.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, the United States Bureau of Reclamation chief design engineer, John L. Savage, {{surveyed}} {{the area and}} drew up a dam proposal for the 'Yangtze River Project'. Some 54 Chinese engineers went to the U.S. for training. The original plans called for the dam to employ a unique method for moving ships; the ships would move into locks located at the lower and upper ends of the dam and then cranes with cables would move the ships from one lock to the next. In the case of smaller water craft, groups of craft would be lifted together for efficiency. It is not known whether this solution was considered for its water-saving performance or because the engineers thought the difference in height between the river {{above and below the}} dam too great for alternative methods. Some exploration, survey, economic study, and design work was done, but <b>the</b> <b>government,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> midst of the Chinese Civil War, halted work in 1947.|$|E

The National Orthodox Romanian Women's Society, {{supported}} by the church and the state, played an important part in enabling regular pilgrimages to important Romanian sites up until 1939. In Germany and Italy, the Fascist governments took a keen interest in organising such journeys. In Italy, these involved large, state-influenced organisations, and the government steadily discouraged private visits or unofficial groups from taking part in alternative ceremonies at these sites.

To combat the NLF and to shore up <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south, the U.S. initially delivered monetary aid, military advisors, and supplies.
