5|$|The {{capture of}} the island was a {{significant}} blow <b>to</b> <b>French</b> power in the region, eliminating an important naval base and denying safe harbours <b>to</b> <b>French</b> shipping in the region. The consequences of losing Martinique were so severe, that the French Navy sent a battle squadron to reinforce the garrison during the invasion. Arriving much too late to affect the outcome, these reinforcements were intercepted off the islands and scattered during the Action of 14–17 April 1809: half the force failed to return to France. With Martinique defeated, British attention in the region turned against Guadeloupe, which was captured the following year.|$|E
5|$|The {{casualties}} {{of the battle}} were staggering: according <b>to</b> <b>French</b> General Staff Inspector P.

But according <b>to</b> <b>French</b> historian Aristid Martinien, at least 460 French officers (known by name) were killed in battle. In total, the Grande Armée lost 1,928officers dead and wounded, including 49generals. The list of slain included French Generals of Division Auguste-Jean-Gabriel de Caulaincourt, Louis-Pierre Montbrun, Jean Victor Tharreau and Generals of Brigade Claude Antoine Compère, François Auguste Damas, Léonard Jean Aubry Huard de Saint-Aubin, Jean Pierre Lanabère, Charles Stanislas Marion, Louis Auguste Marchand Plauzonne, and Jean Louis Romeuf.|$|E

5|$|As president, Quwatli {{continued}} {{to press for}} Syrian independence from France. In a bid to garner American and British support for his government, he declared war against the Axis Powers, aligning Syria with the Allies. Growing countrywide unrest in response <b>to</b> <b>French</b> Mandatory rule led <b>to</b> <b>French</b> military assaults against Damascus and other Syrian cities in May 1945. More French troops were scheduled to land in Syria to aid the authorities, but at Quwatli's request for intervention, British troops invaded Syria from Transjordan, entering Damascus on 1 June. The French military campaign came to an immediate halt as a consequence; the UK and the US had viewed the French military action in Syria as a potential catalyst for further unrest throughout the Middle East and a detriment to British and American lines of communication in the region.|$|E

After years of neglect, his works began to be performed more frequently in the 20th century.
