25|$|On March 7, 1940, the Smith Committee {{proposed}} legislation {{which would have}} abolished the NLRB, reconstituted it, and radically amended the NLRA.

25|$|Deer {{stones are}} usually {{constructed}} from granite or greenstone, {{depending on which}} is the most abundant in the surrounding area.

Leidtke speculates that the ideas of purity and fidelity symbolized in the painting were connected to Vermeer's marriage, and <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> work was created in tribute to his new wife.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the Dalai Lama {{continues}} resisting Chinese domination over Tibetan {{culture and}} religion despite China's attempts {{to ensure that}} after leaving this lifetime Avalokiteshvara reincarnates only with China's approval. One way China has done this is by declaring that the next Dalai Lama must be born in China, thereby excluding anyone born outside their political control. The Dalai Lama has refused to be reborn in China and has suggested <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> bodhisattva of compassion will simply choose not to return to earth after this lifetime.|$|E
25|$|This step {{had been}} {{followed}} by one even more significant. Without consulting his ordinary advisers, Alexander ordered the Minister of the Interior to send a circular to the provincial governors of European Russia (serfdom was rare in other parts), containing {{a copy of the}} instructions forwarded to the Governor-General of Lithuania, praising the supposed generous, patriotic intentions of the Lithuanian landed proprietors, and suggesting <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> landed proprietors of other provinces might express a similar desire. The hint was taken: in all provinces where serfdom existed, emancipation committees were formed.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in the Middle Ages, manuals of {{confession}} {{emerged as}} a literary genre. These manuals were guidebooks on how to obtain the maximum benefits from the sacrament. There were two kinds of manuals: those addressed to the faithful, {{so that they could}} prepare a good confession, and those addressed to the priests, who had to make sure that no sins were left unmentioned and the confession was as thorough as possible. The priest had to ask questions, while being careful not to suggest sins <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> faithful had not thought of and give them ideas. Manuals were written in Latin and in the vernacular.|$|E
25|$|Greenspan entered {{government}} in the 70s, and became Chairman of the Federal Reserve. In 1992, he visited the newly elected Bill Clinton. He persuaded him to let the markets grow, cut taxes, and to let the markets stabilise themselves {{with the help of}} computer technology, to create the New economy. This involved using computer models to predict risks and hedge against them, in accordance with the Californian Ideology. However, by 1996, the production figures had failed to increase, but profits were nevertheless rising, and Greenspan suggested that it wasn't working. After political attacks from all sides, Greenspan changed his mind and decided <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> New Economy was real after all, but that it couldn't be measured using normal economic measures, and so the apparent boom continued.|$|E
25|$|Another notable false {{lead was}} that of Sidney Sherman, a {{recently}} discharged Marine who had served in World War II. Police had found blonde hairs {{in the back of}} the Degnan apartment building, and nearby was a wire that authorities suspected could have been used as a garrote to strangle Suzanne Degnan. Near that was a handkerchief the police suspected might have been used as a gag to keep Suzanne quiet. On the handkerchief was a laundry mark name: S. Sherman. The police hoped <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> killer had erred in leaving it behind. They searched military records and discovered that a Sidney Sherman lived at the Hyde Park YMCA. The police went to question Sherman but discovered that he had vacated the residence without checking out and quit his job without picking up his last paycheck.|$|E

25|$|Synthetic ikaite was {{discovered}} {{in the nineteenth century}} in a study by Pelouze.

Cold water is certainly required for formation, and nucleation inhibitors like phosphate ions for the growth of anhydrous calcium carbonate phases, such as calcite, aragonite, and vaterite probably aid its formation and preservation. It is thought <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> structure of calcium carbonate in a concentrated aqueous solution also consists of an ion pair, and that this is why ikaite readily nucleates at low temperatures, outside of its thermodynamic stability range. When removed from its natural cold water environment, ikaite rapidly disintegrates into monohydrocalcite or anhydrous calcium carbonate phases and water, earning the nickname of the melting mineral.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the war, Belgium {{had been}} {{regarded}} as the foremost European country for the manufacture of armaments. Its Sillon industriel, or industrial valley, {{was one of the}} first fully industrialized and mechanized regions in Europe. The Poudreries Réunies de Belgique was among the oldest armament manufacturers on the Continent, known for its manufacture of mortars, artillery shells, and land mines. Graham Spicer, an official in the Ministry of Munitions who had worked in Belgium before the war and knew its armaments manufacturing capabilities, suggested <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> Belgians might be able to help. An approach was made, and the result was that 1000 skilled Belgian armaments workers volunteered help train other volunteers. As the result of another suggestion (possibly from Spicer as well) most of these volunteers were drawn from the pool of soldiers who had been badly wounded at the front and declared unfit to return there; they were not so unfit they could not do a job of work, but were not capable of resuming life at the Front.|$|E
25|$|Long poem authors {{sometimes}} find {{great difficulty}} {{in making the}} entire poem coherent and/or deciding on a way to end it or wrap it up. Fear of failure is also a common concern, <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> poem will not have as great an impact as intended. Since many long poems take the author's lifetime to complete, this concern is especially troubling to anyone who attempts the long poem. Ezra Pound {{is an example of}} this dilemma, with his poem The Cantos. As the long poem's roots lie in the epic, authors of the long poem often feel an intense pressure to make their long poems the defining literature of the national identity or the shared identity of a large group of people. The American long poem is under pressure from its European predecessors, revealing a special variety of this anxiety. Walt Whitman tried to achieve this idea of characterizing the American identity in Song of Myself. Thus, when the author feels that their work fails to reach such a caliber or catalyze a change within the intended audience, they might consider the poem a failure as a whole.|$|E
