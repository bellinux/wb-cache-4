5|$|The 76ers {{opted not}} to make a {{qualifying}} offer to Robinson before the July 1, 2015 signing period, <b>thus</b> <b>making</b> him a free agent. He later joined the Atlanta Hawks for the 2015 NBA Summer League on July 9.|$|E
5|$|The {{total cost}} of {{production}} was approximately two million Reichsmarks, a rather high figure for German feature films of that era. However, between 1940 and 1943, it grossed over 6.2 million Reichsmarks <b>thus</b> <b>making</b> it a blockbuster {{in contrast to the}} commercial failure of Der Ewige Jude.|$|E

5|$|Then in 1968, despite {{academic}} protests worldwide, Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev {{ordered the}} destruction of Königsberg Castle, <b>thus</b> <b>making</b> any onsite research of the last known resting place of the Amber Room all but impossible.

5|$|After three early round losses, Lee {{bounced back}} {{to win the}} French Open, {{followed}} by his first ever China Open title, <b>thus</b> <b>making</b> him the first ever men's singles shuttler to have won all Super Series titles. The following week, Lee won the Hong Kong Open. However Lee did not qualify for the Super Series Finals, ending the year with three back-to-back titles.|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam, {{like other}} benzodiazepines, binds to {{specific}} {{sites on the}} GABAA (gamma-amino-butyric acid) receptor. When bound to these sites, which {{are referred to as}} benzodiazepine receptors, it modulates the effect of GABAA receptors and, thus, of GABAergic neurons. Long-term use causes adaptive changes in the benzodiazepine receptors, making them less sensitive to stimulation and <b>thus</b> <b>making</b> the drugs less potent.|$|E

5|$|Although Battleship Division Nine's {{service was}} limited mainly to convoy duty and the {{maintenance}} of the blockade of the German coast, its presence greatly augmented the strength of the Grand Fleet, <b>thus</b> <b>making</b> major combat between the British and German fleets even more unlikely in 1918. By helping to keep the High Seas Fleet effectively blockaded in port, Battleship Division Nine played a role in ensuring Allied control of the oceans.|$|E
5|$|Although Watership Down is a {{peaceful}} habitat, Hazel realizes {{there are no}} does (female rabbits), <b>thus</b> <b>making</b> {{the future of the}} warren certain to end with the inevitable death of the rabbits present. With the help of their useful new friend, a black-headed gull named Kehaar, they locate a nearby warren called Efrafa, which is overcrowded and has many does. Hazel sends a small embassy, led by Holly, to Efrafa to present their request for does.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the season, the Rangers again placed Brashear on waivers, {{making him}} {{eligible}} for a contract buyout. Instead of buying-out his contract, however, the Rangers traded Brashear on August 2, 2010, along with Patrick Rissmiller, to the Atlanta Thrashers in exchange for centre Todd White. Atlanta then placed Brashear on waivers and bought-out the remaining year of his contract, <b>thus</b> <b>making</b> him an unrestricted free agent. At {{the end of the}} 2009–10 season, Brashear ranked 15th all-time in NHL history for penalty minutes.|$|E

5|$|Duyệt's death {{opened the}} way for Minh Mạng to apply his {{policies}} in the south, as the viceroy's subordinates lacked the influence to defy the court. The emperor also tried to reduce Duyệt's followers’ political power by abolishing the post of viceroy and putting the south under his direct rule, <b>thus</b> <b>making</b> Duyệt the last holder of the post. Soon after Duyệt's death, Minh Mạng's new appointees arrived and took over the local administration. The new officials then launched an investigation and reported that Duyệt and his aides had engaged in corrupt and abusive practices.|$|E
5|$|Elements {{that show}} tripositive ions with {{electronic}} configuration of a noble gas (scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, actinium) show a clear trend in their physical properties, such as hardness. At the same time, if group 3 is continued with lutetium and lawrencium, several trends are broken. For example, scandium and yttrium are both soft metals. Lanthanum is soft as well; all these elements have their outermost electrons quite {{far from the}} nucleus compared to the nuclei charges. Due to the lanthanide contraction, lutetium, the last in the lanthanide series, has a significantly smaller atomic radius and a higher nucleus charge, <b>thus</b> <b>making</b> the extraction of the electrons from the atom to form metallic bonding more difficult, and <b>thus</b> <b>making</b> the metal harder. However, lutetium suits the previous elements better in several other properties, such as melting and boiling points. Very {{little is known about}} lawrencium, and none of its physical properties have been confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Halos arsenal {{consists}} of weapons from science fiction. The game has been praised for giving each weapon a unique purpose, <b>thus</b> <b>making</b> each useful in different scenarios. For example, plasma weapons {{need time to}} cool if fired too rapidly, but cannot be reloaded and must be discarded upon depletion of their batteries, whereas conventional firearms cannot overheat, but require reloading and ammunition. In contrast to the large weapon inventories of contemporary FPS games, Halo players may carry only two weapons at once, calling for strategy when managing firearms.|$|E

5|$|However, on 22 June 2017, {{after more}} than a decade of playing top-class {{international}} cricket, full ICC membership was granted to Ireland (along with Afghanistan) at an ICC meeting in London, <b>thus</b> <b>making</b> them the twelfth Test cricket team. In October 2017, the ICC announced that Ireland's first Test match would be at home against Pakistan in May 2018. Ireland are holding talks with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) about playing a Test match against England at Lord's in 2019.|$|E
5|$|In 1578, Portuguese Christian missionaries {{published}} a Tamil prayer book in old Tamil script named 'Thambiraan Vanakkam,' <b>thus</b> <b>making</b> Tamil the first Indian language to be printed and published.

According to a 2001 survey, there were 1,863 newspapers published in Tamil, of which 353 were dailies.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, four {{predicted}} {{elements were}} still {{missing from the}} periodic table: 43 (technetium) and 61 (promethium) are radioactive elements and are only present in trace amounts in the environment, <b>thus</b> <b>making</b> elements 75 (rhenium) and 72 (hafnium) the last two unknown non-radioactive elements. Since rhenium was discovered in 1908, hafnium was the last element with stable isotopes to be discovered.|$|E
50|$|The {{province}} of Vojvodina, a northern {{province of}} Serbia, had decriminalized homosexuality in 1978, <b>thus</b> effectively <b>making</b> an equal age of consent for any sexual practice regardless of sex or gender. This lasted until Vojvodina lost its law-making power in 1990.|$|R

5|$|In May 1868, the daimyō of Nagaoka inflicted high {{losses on}} the Imperial {{troops in the}} Battle of Hokuetsu, but his castle {{ultimately}} fell on May 19. Imperial troops continued to progress north, defeating the Shinsengumi at the Battle of Bonari Pass, which {{opened the way for}} their attack on the castle of Aizuwakamatsu in the Battle of Aizu in October 1868, <b>thus</b> <b>making</b> the position in Sendai untenable.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} {{to the needs of}} smaller libraries who were finding the expanded classification schedules difficult to use, in 1894, the first abridged edition of the Dewey Decimal system was produced. The abridged edition generally parallels the full edition, and has been developed for most full editions since that date. By popular request, in 1930, the Library of Congress began to print Dewey Classification numbers on nearly all of its cards, <b>thus</b> <b>making</b> the system immediately available to all libraries making use of the Library of Congress card sets.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, a modern village (al-Mishrifeh) was built within the ancient site.
