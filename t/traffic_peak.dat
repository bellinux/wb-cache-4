500|$|The {{airport is}} located at Høybuktmoen in Sør-Varanger, about [...] west of Kirkenes. The {{terminal}} has room for six category C aircraft (Airbus A320/Boeing 737). During summer the airport experiences a very high <b>traffic</b> <b>peak</b> with both scheduled and charter aircraft arriving at the same time, as both intend to correspond with Hurtigruten; this causes patronage to rise beyond the airport's capacity. Kirkenes Airport had a revenue of NOK26.4 million in 2009, of which commercial income made up fifteen percent, and an operating deficit of NOK45.4 million. The deficit is cross subsidized by profits at Avinor's largest airports. In 2013, the airport had 297,149 passengers, 8,643 aircraft movements and 367 tonnes of cargo.|$|E

In service level agree ments, we bound average response times and throughputs for all service classes. Each request is sorted into a class, where each class is assigned a weight representing the in come for the web site owner. Then a linear optimization algorithm is applied so that the total revenue for the web site during overload is maximized...|$|R

The facility demanded a large quantity of electricity for the freezers and conveyor belts, thus a much stronger transmission tower cable system was run to the airport. This also improved the living conditions of the village of Kurumoch nearby, which the cable ran through. In 1990, Kuybyshev Airport reached its passenger <b>traffic</b> <b>peak</b> of 3,700,000.|$|E

A higher baseline fare will put some people off travelling; less drastically, a spatial adjustment in the fares for different links allows the operator to direct flows by influencing their origin-destination structure on its network.

The stakes are high for an urban public transport network, which experiences high <b>traffic</b> <b>peaks</b> during morning and evening rush hours.|$|R

40|$|Cost-benefit {{analysis}} plays {{a central}} role in planning and investment decisions related to transportation. Yet, this process is often rather obscure and difficult to control and check by an outsider.

MOLINO performs cost-benefit analysis for different transport modes and types of freight and/or passenger <b>traffic,</b> <b>peak</b> and off-peak time periods, diverse market structures (private or public monopoly or duopoly, regulated or unregulated) and various financing schemes. Congestion levels are computed endogenously. MOLINO computes costs and benefits over multiple periods and the length of the time horizon is flexible.
