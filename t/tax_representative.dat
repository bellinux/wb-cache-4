Both approaches sometimes use the language of “intent,” so it becomes important for the state-local tax practitioner to understand, and to accommodate his or her arguments to the kind of intent that actually controls in the particular jurisdiction.

The second part describes a middle position that some courts have embraced between the two pure poles of subjective and objectified intent.

40|$|In {{the context}} of Value Added Tax (VAT) on consumption, the {{importance}} of VAT deduction is increasing particularly by cross-border trade with goods and services. That is to say, the mechanism of deduction may prevent the foreign trade from VAT caused trade barriers. In this work, the conventional concept of trade barriers is initially clarified as governmental discrimination of economic sales from abroad. For VAT purposes, this concept takes a supplementation. The discrimination in terms of VAT can be proven {{on the basis of}} the so-called destination principle. According to this principle, it is solely admitted taxes to be imposed in that country in which supplied goods or services are consumed. Therefore, this principle is also called country of consumption principle. If goods or service have arrived at the country of destination and are burdened by the country of origin with VAT, this country should provide for deduction or refund of the levied VAT. Thus, the concept of trade barriers is to be supplemented by discrimination of economic sales to foreign countries. Hence, the country of origin has to award the unlimited right to deduct input VAT and the performance of this right in order to prevent trade barriers. Additionally, it is generally not allowed to levy higher taxes on the “imported” sale in the country of destination for the reason that the sale is originated from abroad. Subsequently, it is discovered certain restrictions of the VAT deduction concerning cross-border transactions of goods and services between EU member states and Turkey from the viewpoint of VAT law in the EU. Residents in Turkey as supplier or receiver of taxable sales can claim VAT deduction only in accordance to Directive 86 / 560 /EEC. This Directive concedes essential (political) scope for limitations of VAT deduction (refund), e. g. “of reciprocity” or the appointment of a <b>tax</b> <b>representative,</b> to the member states. Furthermore, the VAT refund is unavoidable excluded by the Directive, if the taxable person from Turkey supplies particular sales of insurances and financial products or incur some expenditures determined by the respective EU member state. Pursuant to Turkish VAT law, it can be stated that there are shortcomings of VAT deduction detrimental to EU residents with regard to the cross-border trade. If EU taxable persons receive goods or services from Turkey, which are subject to VAT, a VAT deduction, on a regular basis, is not permitted. Moreover, taxable persons from EU, who imports goods to Turkey, are basically obliged to pay import VAT. The deduction of this tax requires that the taxable person owes VAT due to other taxable sales in Turkey. The import VAT could be deducted from this VAT debt. But it is rarely the case that there is that kind of VAT debt. Finally, EU taxable persons supplying taxable cross-border sales in Turkey are not eligible to VAT deduction, to the extent that the input VAT on purchases exceeds the VAT debt on the cross-border sales...|$|E

5000|$|A {{limiting}} {{factor in determining}} the government budget is the capacity to tax. Per capita income (PCI) is the most often used measure of relative fiscal capacity.

40|$|Some {{measure of}} fiscal {{capacity}} {{should be an}} important component of the system of equalization transfers for the regions of the Russian Federation. In order to enhance the understanding of the concepts and measurement issues involved, ISP Working Paper 97 - 3 discusses the concept of fiscal capacity as well as some general measurement issues. In that note, six measures are presented that can be used to measure the fiscal capacity of subnational regions. These six measures are (1) current or lagged revenue collections, (2) per capita personal income, (3) gross regional product, (4) total taxable resources, (5) the <b>representative</b> <b>tax</b> system and (6) the <b>representative</b> <b>tax</b> system using regression analysis. The purpose of the current note is to actually compute various measures of fiscal capacity for the subjects of the Russian Federation, and to demonstrate how these measures are computed.
