The fuel gas requirement of power station was about 230 MMSCFD; this left a gas surplus of about 70 MMSCFD. The quality of this gas, although adequate {{for use in the}} power station, was not suitable for delivery to the National Transmission System (NTS).

A gas treatment plant with a capacity of 200 MMSCFD (for times when the power station operated at reduced capacity) was constructed at Connah's Quay to treat the gas to a quality suitable for delivery to the NTS.The plant was owned and operated by PowerGen (now E.ON UK) and started up in November 1997, the plant was built by Costain's, the capital cost of the project was £40 million.|$|E
50|$|The {{origin of}} the organic matter is mainly algae and plants. The major {{inorganic}} constituents in the organic rich zones are calcite, dolomite, silica and considerable amounts of pyrite. Economic Grade Oil Shale (EGOS) over an oil shale deposit was defined by 5 m minimum seam thickness, 750 kcal/kg minimum upper calorific value and 4% minimum oil content. The average calorific value of the EGOS zone is around 4900 kcal/kg. The in-place oil content of Himmetoğlu oil shale is 43% by weight or approximately 482 l/ton shale. However, the average <b>total</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>content</b> is high (2.5%) due to considerable amount of pyrite. Himmetoğlu oil shale is the highest quality oil shale deposit in Turkey. Himmetoğlu oil shale zone is being excavated to exploit an underlying high quality lignite seam, utilized for domestic heating. On accounts of its high thermal quality, Himmetoğlu oil shale is an attractive alternative for thermal power generation in Turkey, which relies mostly on poor quality lignites.|$|E

The method can aiso {{be used for the}} analysis of the volatile sulphur content in aqueous solutions. INTRODUCFION During a study of catalytic hydrodesulphurization of gas oils ’ a method was needed not only for the determination of the distribution of sulphur compounds, but also, more importantly, for the determination of total suIphur content. Methods have been published for the determination of the distribution of sulpbur compounds in gas oils using gas chromatography (GC) with a coulometric detector’> 3. The flame photometric detector (FPD) has proved its usefulness for the analysis of sulphur compounds. The response of the FPD for nanogram amounts of sulphur is com-parabIe with that of the microcoulometric detector”. The dual-flame concept was introduced to improve the FPD performano 9. The work of Rupprecht and Phillips 6 is of particular interest, since the system was used not only as a GC detector but also for the continuous monitoring of the odorant suiphur content in hydrocarbon gases and the determination of sulphur content in volatile liquids. Difficult operation and somewhat poor reproducibility apparently prohibited a more widespread use. These problems seem to be greatly reduced in a more’recent design’. In this paper a simple method is described for the quantitative determination of the <b>total</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>content</b> in oil fractions, using a gas chromatograph with an empty glass column and a dual-flame FPD. The method was extended to the determination of the total (volatile) sulphur content of aqueous solutions. This was applied to a scrubber for gasifier effluents...|$|E
30|$|The data {{available}} shows {{that during the}} desulphurization of lignite the <b>total</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>content</b> can be reduced, on average, only by 3.0  wt% (Table  7). Accordingly, the degrees of total sulphur removal are 29.4 %– 31.8 % (Table  8). This {{is due to the}} abnormally high content of organic sulphur in feed coal, which remained virtually unchanged throughout the process. Furthermore, the low yield of desulphurized coal was caused by the high moisture content in the feedstock and high reactivity typical of lignite organic matter. However, if assuming that all the hydrogen sulphide contained in desulphurized gases will be removed or converted to sulphur, the degree of conversion of total sulphur will be equal to the level of reducing environmental pollution. We can, therefore, assert that the method proposed allows emissions of sulphur compounds to the atmosphere during combustion of lignite be reduced, on average, by 53.5 %– 56.0 %.|$|E

This study presents the results from the analyses of 140 soil samples taken at two soil layers (0 – 10 and 10 – 20 cm) in the cultivation areas. At the end of the study, it was established that there were significant differences between the cultivation areas in terms of soil physical properties such as total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN), <b>total</b> <b>sulphur</b> (TS) <b>contents</b> and pH, while only the TN content was significantly different between the two soil layers. Moreover, significant differences were identified between the cultivation areas in terms of soil physical properties including clay and sand contents, aggregate stability, and organic matter content, whereas the only significant difference found among the soil layers was that of their silt content. Since safflower contains higher amounts of biomass than wheat, we found higher amounts of organic matter content and, therefore, higher amounts of TN and TS content in the soils of the SCA. In addition, due to the fact that wheat contains more cellulose – which takes longer to decompose – the TC content of the soil in the WCA was found to be higher than that in the SCA. The results also revealed that the WCA had a higher carbon storage capacity...|$|R

40|$|The new highway E 18 Grimstad-Kristiansand, {{constructed}} in the period 2006 - 2009, crosses through sulphide-bearing rock. Oxidation after blasting results in formation of sulphuric acid, which may enter the runoff. Blasted sulphide rock material was therefore deposited. Deposit M 17 consisted of about 700. 000 tonnes of rock material and covered 50. 000 m 2 of terrain. Although a total of 11. 000 tonnes of shell sand and limestone gravel was used, runoff from deposit M 17 became acid and aluminium-rich during the construction phase. pH at the outlet of the downstream situated Lake Lomtjenn was reduced to pH 4. 0 - 4. 6, and aluminium concentrations increased to very high levels (10 - 20 mg/l) in 2008 / 2009. Countermeasures in 2009 increased pH, and the Al-concentration decreased to below 5 mg/l. The water quality stayed toxic to fish, however, and the lake did not recover. It was estimated that the initial annual sulphur transport probably was {{in the order of}} 0. 5 % of the <b>total</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>content</b> in deposit M 17. This weathering rate will result in ongoing consolidation of the rock pile. A plan for new measures at the deposit, launched by CJV in May 2011, is described, and a procedure for approaching good ecological status is proposed.

40|$|Post-exploitation {{opencast}} pits {{constitute a}} {{final stage of}} mining activities and turning them into public utility facilities is taking place now by their water reclamation. They constitute basins without outflows with the depth of 15 to 69 m and areas ranging from 2. 5 to 692 ha. The bottoms of these basins are situated in pyrite-containing Miocene formations. Products of Fe 2 S weathering comprise sulphuric acid and iron compounds – sulphate II and sulphate III. This study presents the basic parameters of the reservoirs constructed in the final opencast pits of the “Konin” and “Adamów” brown coal mine,s {{as well as the}} properties of the formations making up the bottoms of two water reservoirs under construction: Lubstów and Władysławów. It is evident from the performed investigations that these formations are characterised by very acid reaction and very high exchangeable acidity. The <b>total</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>content</b> ranges from 446 to 962 mg·kg - 1 of the ground and that of sulphate sulphur – from 71 to 187 mg·kg - 1 of the ground. The chemism of these grounds will exert influence on the quality of water accumulating in the opencast pits during the initial period of their spontaneous flooding. Together with the increase of the capacity of these reservoirs, the contact of waters with boulder clays of the Warta River glaciation abounding in calcium compounds will increase and concentrations of calcium ions in the waters of the reservoirs will also grow...|$|E
40|$|The {{reduction}} of adenosine 5 '-phosphosulphate (APS) by APS reductase (APR) {{is considered to}} be one of the rate-limiting steps in the assimilation of sulphur in plants. In order to identify the mechanisms of regulation of this enzyme, the impact of atmospheric H 2 S exposure on mRNA expression, protein level, and activity of APR was studied in two species (Allium cepa L. and Brassica oleracea L.) with different physiological responses to H 2 S exposure. As expected, H 2 S exposure resulted in a rapid increase in thiol compounds in the shoot of both species. There was a substantial increase in <b>total</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>content</b> in shoots of A. cepa, whereas it was hardly affected or even slightly decreased in B. oleracea. Sulphate uptake was only marginally affected in A. cepa, whereas it was strongly decreased in B. oleracea upon H 2 S exposure. Furthermore, H 2 S exposure resulted in a down-reguiation of APR activity in shoot and roots of both species, which was probably mediated by a transcriptional mechanism of regulation by thiols, since mRNA levels also decreased. However, in contrast to B. oleracea, APR protein level was not affected by H 2 S exposure in A. cepa. The reduction in APR activity in onion was therefore achieved by an additional as yet unknown post-translational regulation. These results demonstrate that not only the physiological response to H 2 S, but also the molecular mechanisms of regulation of APR differ in the two species...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the concentration of the nutritionally essential sulphur amino acids in seed protein, a transgene encoding a methionine- and cysteine-rich protein, sunflower seed albumin (SSA), was transferred to chickpeas (Cicer arietinum L). Transgenic seeds that accumulated SSA contained more methionine and less oxidized sulphur than the controls, suggesting that additional demand for sulphur amino acids from {{the expression of the}} transgene stimulated sulphur assimilation. In addition, the activity of trypsin inhibitors, a known family of endogenous, sulphur-rich chickpea seed proteins, was diminished in transgenic, SSA-containing seeds compared with the nontransgenic controls. Together, these results indicate that the reduced sulphur sequestered into SSA was supplied partly by additional sulphur assimilation in the developing transgenic seeds, and partly by some diversion of sulphur amino acids from endogenous seed proteins. Growth of chickpeas on nutrient with a high sulphur-to-nitrogen ratio increased the <b>total</b> seed <b>sulphur</b> <b>content</b> and the accumulation of sulphur amino acids in the seeds, and partly mitigated the effect of SSA accumulation on the trypsin inhibitor amount. The results suggest that free methionine and O-acetylserine (OAS) acted as signals that modulated chickpea seed protein composition in response to the variation in sulphur demand, as well as in response to variation in the nitrogen and sulphur status of the plant...|$|R
40|$|Flotation of {{coal and}} sulphur from a typical South African {{ultrafine}} colliery waste {{has been achieved}} in laboratory-scale batch flotation tests, using dodecane, kerosene, and oleic acid as coal collectors, and xanthates to float the sulphide minerals (with the aid of dextrin as a coal depressant). The use of oleic acid as collector, in conjunction with MIBC frother, produced a coal yield of 56 per cent (much more than was obtained with dodecane or kerosene) at an ash content of 18 per cent, from a feed ash of 34. 4 per cent; and a low- sulphur tailings. Sulphide flotation using potassium xanthate (PAX) recovered 26. 3 per cent of the <b>total</b> <b>sulphur</b> in the concentrate. Staged addition of xanthate increased the <b>total</b> <b>sulphur</b> recovery to 42. 1 per cent and reduced the <b>sulphur</b> <b>content</b> of the tailing further...|$|R

Therefore, there is growing interest in fast and accurate methods for analyzing <b>sulphur</b> <b>content</b> in fuels. The objective of this work was to compare four different methods of <b>total</b> <b>sulphur</b> determination in solid fuels. The methods used in this work were Eschka, Infrared, Thermal Conductivity Detection (TCD) and Ultraviolet Fluorescence Detection (UV).
