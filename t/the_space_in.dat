5|$|Another legend narrated in the Arakanese chronicle {{relates to}} the nine {{phenomena}} that occurred when the image was consecrated in the temple and continued to occur after the Buddha had departed. These nine phenomena were: holy water used for washing the image would not overflow the collecting vessels; {{the water from the}} tank that was used for washing the Buddha's head would retain its quality throughout the year; six coloured rays appeared when the devotees worshipped the image in the evenings; the rays faded in the presence of non-believers; <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>in</b> the temple would automatically accommodate any number of devotees; the leaves of trees would tilt {{in the direction of the}} Buddha image; birds would not fly over the temple; and the stone guardians at the entrance would sense the presence of evil doers and prevent them from entering the temple.|$|E
5|$|In the B-model of topological string theory, the D-branes {{are complex}} submanifolds of a Calabi–Yau {{together}} with additional data that arise physically from having charges at the endpoints of strings. Intuitively, one {{can think of}} a submanifold as a surface embedded inside the Calabi–Yau, although submanifolds can also exist in dimensions different from two. In mathematical language, the category having these branes as its objects is known as the derived category of coherent sheaves on the Calabi–Yau. In the A-model, the D-branes can again be viewed as submanifolds of a Calabi–Yau manifold. Roughly speaking, they are what mathematicians call special Lagrangian submanifolds. This means among other things that they have half the dimension of <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>in</b> which they sit, and they are length-, area-, or volume-minimizing. The category having these branes as its objects is called the Fukaya category.|$|E
5|$|Looking {{beyond the}} manned lunar landings, NASA {{investigated}} several post-lunar applications for Apollo hardware. The Apollo Extension Series (Apollo X,) proposed up to 30 flights to Earth orbit, using <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>in</b> the Spacecraft Lunar Module Adapter (SLA) to house a small orbital laboratory (workshop). Astronauts {{would continue to}} use the CSM as a ferry to the station. This study was followed by design of a larger orbital workshop {{to be built in}} orbit from an empty S-IVB Saturn upper stage, and grew into the Apollo Applications Program (AAP). The workshop was to be supplemented by the Apollo Telescope Mount, which could be attached to the ascent stage of the lunar module via a rack. The most ambitious plan called for using an empty S-IVB as an interplanetary spacecraft for a Venus fly-by mission.|$|E

5|$|Von der Tanns armor {{consisted}} of Krupp cemented and nickel steel. The main belt armor was 80–120mm (3.1–4.7in) thick forward, 250mm(9.8in) thick over the ship's citadel, and was 100mm(3.9in) thick aft. The forward conning tower {{was protected by}} 250mm(9.8in), while the aft conning tower by 200mm(7.9in). The four turrets had 230mm(9.1in) faces, 180mm(7.1in) sides, and 90mm(3.5in) on the roofs. The horizontal armor measured 25mm(0.98in) thick, and the sloping deck armor was 50mm(2.0in) thick. Like the armored cruiser Blücher before her, she was protected by a torpedo bulkhead, 25mm(0.98in) thick. It was set back a distance of 4meters(13ft) from the outer hull skin, <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>in</b> between being used to store coal.|$|E
5|$|World of Motion was an {{attraction}} that {{was located in}} the current building of Test Track and was sponsored by General Motors. When the sponsorship expired, GM {{was in the process}} of conducting lay-offs and cutbacks forcing the company to question whether or not to sign another sponsorship agreement. Upon deciding to sign another agreement, GM wanted Disney to construct a new ride (in the location of World of Motion) that focused specifically around their automobiles, rather than the fanciful history of transportation from the pre-historic (animal transportation) to modern age (automobiles, planes, etc.) previously housed in <b>the</b> <b>space.</b> <b>In</b> 1976, Disney Imagineers had visited the Milford Proving Ground (owned by General Motors) and later made a second trip to the facility and worked with GM to create Test Track. After numerous problems encountered during the construction of the ride, Test Track soft-opened on December 19, 1998 but didn't officially open until March 17, 1999, nearly 2 years after the original scheduled opening date.|$|E

25|$|In mathematics, the {{dimension}} of an object is an intrinsic property independent of <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>in</b> which the object is embedded.
