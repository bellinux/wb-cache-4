When everyone arrives on the roof, Ciara meets up with Chamillionaire for his verse, and thereafter Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan, the stars of Step Up, make appearances in dance sequences. <b>The</b> <b>lights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cityscape begin to pulse to the music, and rain falls on the crowd.
