5|$|Barbara and Adam Maitland {{decide to}} spend their {{vacation}} decorating their idyllic Connecticut country home. As the two are driving home {{from a trip to}} town, Barbara swerves to avoid a dog and the car plunges into a river. After they return home, Adam decides to retrace their steps as they can't recall how they got home. Upon stepping outside he's taken to a desert world with monstrous sandworms before being pulled back in by Barbara. Even though he had been gone for less than a minute Barbara claims he had been gone for over an hour. She and Adam notice <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>now</b> lack reflections and they discover a Handbook for the Recently Deceased and realize they did not survive the crash.|$|E
5|$|Blakeney Point has a mixed {{colony of}} about 500 harbour and grey seals. The harbour seals have their young between June and August, and the pups, which can swim almost immediately, {{may be seen}} on the mud flats. Grey seals breed in winter, between November and January; their young cannot swim until they have lost their first white coat, so they are {{restricted}} to dry land for their first three or four weeks, and can be viewed on the beach during this period. Grey seals colonised a site in east Norfolk in 1993, and started breeding regularly at Blakeney in 2001. It is possible <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>now</b> outnumber harbour seals off the Norfolk coast. Seal-watching boat trips run from Blakeney and Morston harbours, giving good views without disturbing the seals. The corpses of 24 female or juvenile harbour seals were found in the Blakeney area between March 2009 and August 2010, each with spirally cut wounds consistent with the animal having been drawn through a ducted propeller.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to reach a ceasefire, peacekeepers escorted Tshombe {{to the front lines}} where he was forced to agree that his own forces were attacking UN {{positions}} without provocation. He ordered his troops to cease firing but was ignored. Radio intercepts revealed to the UN that General Norbert Moke, the commander of the Katangese Gendarmerie, had ordered the Katangese Air Force to bomb the Élisabethville airport on the night of 29 December. With the failure to enact a ceasefire, Lieutenant General Dewan Prem Chand of India convinced Thant to authorise a strong, decisive offensive to pre-emptively eliminate Katangese forces. This brought relief to some of the UN peacekeepers, mindful <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>now</b> had justification to act forcefully against Katanga. Determined to avoid civilian casualties and widespread destruction, the secretary-general sent a wire to the UN Force Commander in the Congo to explain that napalm was to be prohibited from use in combat. Early on 28 December for unknown reasons, Tshombe quietly departed Élisabethville.|$|E

5|$|The RAF had {{initially}} planned on a buy of 150 trainers; however, {{with both the}} BAC TSR-2 tactical strike aircraft and Hawker Siddeley P.1154 supersonic V/STOL fighter cancelled, the RAF were looking increasingly hard at their future light strike needs and realizing <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>now</b> needed more than just advanced trainers with some secondary counter insurgency capability. The RAF's strike line-up {{was at this point}} intended to consist of American General Dynamics F-111s plus the AFVG for lighter strike purposes. There was concern that both F-111 and AFVG were high risk projects and with the French already planning on a strike role for the Jaguar, there was an opportunity to introduce a serious backup plan for the RAF's future strike needs – the Jaguar. As a result, by October1970, the RAF's requirements had changed to 165 single-seat strike aircraft and 35 trainers.|$|E
5|$|Themistocles {{first went}} to live in exile in Argos. However, perceiving <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>now</b> had a prime {{opportunity}} to bring Themistocles down for good, the Spartans again levelled accusations of Themistocles's complicity in Pausanias's treason. They demanded that he be tried by the 'Congress of Greeks', rather than in Athens, although it seems {{that in the end}} he was actually summoned to Athens to stand trial. Perhaps realising he had little hope of surviving this trial, Themistocles fled, first to Kerkyra, and thence to Admetus, king of Molossia. Themistocles's flight probably only served to convince his accusers of his guilt, and he was declared a traitor in Athens, his property to be confiscated. It should be noted that both Diodorus and Plutarch considered that the charges were false, and made solely for the purposes of destroying Themistocles. The Spartans sent ambassadors to Admetus, threatening that the whole of Greece would go to war with the Molossians unless they surrendered Themistocles. Admetus, however, allowed Themistocles to escape, giving him a large sum of gold to aid him on his way. Themistocles then fled from Greece, apparently never to return, thus effectively bringing his political career to an end.|$|E
5|$|The androids {{threaten}} to decapitate Reinette, but the Doctor on Arthur crashes through {{the mirror to}} save her. The androids give up and shut down when the Doctor tells them <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>now</b> cannot return to their ship to finish the repairs. Reinette tells the Doctor that she had her fireplace moved to Versailles {{in the hope that}} he would return. The Doctor finds that the fireplace is still an operating time window and uses it to return to the spaceship. He tells Reinette to pack a bag and prepare to leave. The Doctor returns to the fireplace seconds later but discovers that seven years have passed in Reinette's time. King Louis XV finds the Doctor, tells him that Reinette has died and gives him a letter in which Reinette expresses her hopes for the Doctor's quick return and confesses her love for him. The Doctor returns to the TARDIS and watches the time windows close before leaving the ship. The TARDIS crew muse about the reasons the androids wanted Madame de Pompadour's brain to complete their repairs, and the Doctor conjectures that the ship's memory banks were damaged by the ion storm. When the TARDIS dematerializes, a portrait can be seen stating the birth and death date of Madame de Pompadour. As the episode ends, the lifeless ship drifts through space; its name is SS Madame de Pompadour.|$|E

5|$|While {{waiting in}} the church, Jackie sees Pete talking to Rose and thinks he is having an affair. Pete and Rose talk alone, and he comes to realise that she is his daughter. When Rose is unable to answer {{questions}} about how good of a father he was, Pete realises he was meant to die in the accident. Jackie thinks Rose is Pete's daughter with another woman, and in a fit of frustration Pete hands the baby Rose to adult Rose. The paradox worsens, and a Reaper is able to enter the church. The Doctor declares himself the oldest thing in the church and offers himself to the Reaper, who consumes him and disappears. The TARDIS key goes cold and drops to the ground. Pete realises <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>now</b> have no other choice and that he must die in order to restore the timeline. He bids Rose and Jackie an emotional farewell, races out of the church and throws himself under the car that was originally meant to kill him; it has continued to appear near the church. The timeline is repaired, and the Reapers' victims reappear. The Doctor sends Rose to be with her father, and she holds his hand until he dies. Rose and the Doctor walk hand-in-hand back to the restored TARDIS.|$|E
5|$|William, Duke of Normandy, invaded England in 1066 {{and one of}} {{his first}} actions after landing was to build Hastings Castle to protect his supply routes. Following their victory at the battle of Hastings the Normans began three phases of castle building. The first of these was the establishment, by the new king, of a number of royal castles in key {{strategic}} locations. This royal castle programme focused on controlling the towns and cities of England and the associated lines of communication, including Cambridge, Huntingdon, Lincoln, Norwich, Nottingham, Warwick and York. Of the castles built by William the Conqueror two-thirds were built in towns and cities, often those with the former Anglo-Saxon mints. These urban castles could make use of the existing town's walls and fortifications, but typically required the demolition of local houses to make space for them. This could cause extensive damage, and records suggest that in Lincoln 166 houses were destroyed, with 113 in Norwich and 27 in Cambridge. Some of these castles were deliberately built on top of important local buildings, such as the burhs or halls of local nobles, and might be constructed so as to imitate aspects of the previous buildings– such as the gatehouse at Rougemont Castle in Exeter, which closely resembled the previous Anglo-Saxon burh tower– this was probably done to demonstrate to the local population <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>now</b> answered to their new Norman rulers.|$|E
