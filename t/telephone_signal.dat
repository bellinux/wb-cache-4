50|$|The first {{focus was}} on anti-induction {{telephone}}s. In the 1930s, the telephone infrastructure in Japan was primarily used by the railroad industry, the police, the utility industry and the mining industry. The telecommunications infrastructure was so poor {{that it had to}} rely on power lines and railway cables—upon which <b>telephone</b> <b>signals</b> were superimposed. Because the <b>telephone</b> <b>signals</b> were susceptible to inductive interference and noise and the defective wiring in the long lines caused too much <b>signal</b> loss, normal <b>telephone</b> conversations were difficult. Iwasaki Kogyo set out to develop an anti-induction telephone to solve this problem, whilst running the cable manufacturing operations. Similarly, Iwasaki Kogyo focused on secure, anti-tapping telephones.|$|R
50|$|Because {{the same}} twisted pair carries <b>telephone</b> <b>signals</b> in both directions,echo {{is often a}} problem on these circuits. Echo is avoided by {{ensuring}} matchingimpedance {{at both ends of}} the circuit. Different countries have differentstandards for telephone impedance.|$|R

50|$|The first {{telephone}} patent {{was issued}} to Alexander Graham Bell in March 1876. The {{first use of}} telecommunication in the Union of South Africa was a single line telegraph connecting Cape Town and Simonstown. After Bell Labs' development of undersea <b>telephone</b> <b>signal</b> repeaters, the first undersea links were introduced connecting Durban and Europe, and soon after {{to the rest of}} the world. The network continued in a heavily regulated market as international technology developed. Until 1991 telephone services were operated by the South African Postal Service.|$|E

5000|$|AT&T was {{incorporated}} in 1885 as a wholly owned subsidiary of American Bell. On December 30, 1899, AT&T acquired {{the assets of}} American Bell and became {{the parent company of}} the Bell System. [...] In order to extend service nationwide, some inventions had to be developed to propagate the <b>telephone</b> <b>signal,</b> since the signals weaken as they travel through the telephone wires. Until Bell's second patent expired in 1894, Bell Telephone was the only company that could legally operate telephone systems in the USA. Between 1894 and 1904, after Bell's patents expired, over six thousand independent telephone companies arose in the US.|$|E
50|$|Soldiers {{with the}} 187th Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), oversaw the {{installation}} of a satellite in Sinjar, allowing locals to communicate with U.S. soldiers {{for the first time}} ever. The satellite was installed on a communications tower in the city in northwest Iraq 1 October 2003. The <b>telephone</b> <b>signal</b> covers most of northern Iraq and south to Mosul. The ability to stay in contact with soldiers benefits both Iraqis and soldiers. Not only can Iraqis call in case of emergencies, they can offer tips such as the whereabouts of terrorists or report other suspicious acts.|$|E
5000|$|On 7 January 1927, AT&T {{initiated}} the first transatlantic commercial telephone service, linking New York and London. The AT&T Transoceanic Receiver Station was {{located at the}} end of Hand Lane, , two miles west of the town center. The massive receiving antenna, over three miles long and two miles wide, straddled what is now Interstate 95 in Maine four miles west of the center of Houlton. The receiver station worked with the large long-wave transmitting facility of AT&T located at RCA [...] in Rocky Point, New York. The receiver station received the longwave <b>telephone</b> <b>signal</b> from the British General Post Office Rugby transmitting station near Rugby, England.|$|E
50|$|The {{international}} standard for <b>telephone</b> <b>signaling</b> utilizes dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signaling, more {{commonly known as}} touch-tone dialing. It replaced the older and slower pulse dial system. The push-button format is also used for all cell phones, but with out-of-band signaling of the dialed number.|$|R
50|$|Cables are {{arranged}} on poles {{with the most}} dangerous cables, that is, those carrying power, strung highest. Overhead cable systems also include {{a number of different}} components for managing signal cables. These include splicing systems that allow multi-conductor cables for distributing <b>telephone</b> <b>signals</b> and snowshoe-shaped devices for reversing the direction of cables.|$|R
5000|$|The Signaling System No. 5 (SS5) is a {{multi-frequency}} (MF) <b>telephone</b> <b>signaling</b> {{system that}} was in use from the 1970s for International Direct Distance Dialing (IDDD). Internationally it became known as CCITT5 or CC5. [...] It was also nicknamed Atlantic Code because it {{was used for the}} first IDDD connections between Europe and North America.|$|R
50|$|Telephone systems {{also use}} matched {{impedances}} to minimise echo on long-distance lines. This {{is related to}} transmission-line theory. Matching also enables the telephone hybrid coil (2- to 4-wire conversion) to operate correctly. As the signals are sent and received on the same two-wire circuit to the central office (or exchange), cancellation is necessary at the telephone earpiece so excessive sidetone is not heard. All devices used in <b>telephone</b> <b>signal</b> paths are generally dependent on matched cable, source and load impedances. In the local loop, the impedance chosen is 600 ohms (nominal). Terminating networks are installed at the exchange to offer the best match to their subscriber lines. Each country has its own standard for these networks, but they are all designed to approximate about 600 ohms over the voice frequency band.|$|E

Just when they realise he went outside because of the lack of <b>telephone</b> <b>signal</b> inside, the empty chalet explodes.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the sequel}} Batman: Arkham City, Batman must {{track him down}} and foil his murders in a side mission, with Zsasz calling him on various payphones and instructing Batman to find another phone within a time limit before Victor Zsasz starts killing hostages. He {{explains}} his backstory {{over the course of}} the mission via phoning the player, including him losing his money gambling against Penguin (who cheats) in the Iceberg Lounge, eventually revealing he feels his only purpose in life is killing. Batman eventually tracks him down to his hideout by tracking the series of communication towers he uses to bounce his <b>telephone</b> <b>signal,</b> and stops him before he kills two hostages. However, Detective Mode—a visual mode that highlights elements of interest on-screen—reveals a body in the water, suggesting a hostage tried escaping or committed suicide. Batman then puts Zsasz in a cage where he kept his prisoners. It is mentioned by Penguin that Victor Zsasz has murdered over 100 men, women, and children. It's also made apparent that he was captured by Penguin and put on display before escaping.|$|E
