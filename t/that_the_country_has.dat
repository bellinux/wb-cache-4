5|$|A second {{important}} {{factor is the}} success of the IMF Stand-By-Arrangement in the country since November 2008. The SBA includes three pillars. The first pillar is a program of medium term fiscal consolidation, involving painful austerity measures and significant tax hikes. The result has been that central government debts have been stabilised at around 80–90 percent of GDP. A second pillar is the resurrection of a viable but sharply downsized domestic banking system on the ruins of its gargantuan international banking system which the government was unable to bail out. A third pillar is the enactment of capital controls and the work to gradually lift these to restore normal financial linkages with the outside world. An important result of the emergency legislation and the SBA is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>has</b> not been seriously affected by the European sovereign debt crisis from 2010. Despite a contentious debate with Britain and the Netherlands over the question of a state guarantee on the Icesave deposits of Landsbanki in these countries, credit default swaps on Icelandic sovereign debt have steadily declined from over 1000 points prior to the crash in 2008 to around 200 points in June 2011. The fact that the assets of the failed Landsbanki branches are now estimated to cover most of the depositor claims has had an influence to ease concerns over the situation.|$|E

50|$|In 1991, after {{international}} pressure {{and when a}} change of government was imminent, South African Ambassador to the United States Harry Schwarz signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. In 1993, the then president Frederik Willem de Klerk openly admitted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>had</b> developed a limited nuclear weapon capability. These weapons were subsequently dismantled before South Africa acceded to the NPT and opened itself up to IAEA inspection. In 1994, the IAEA completed its work and declared <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>had</b> fully dismantled its nuclear weapons program.|$|R
25|$|The {{output of}} China's {{services}} in 2010 ranks third worldwide—after the United States and Japan—and high power and telecom density has ensured <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>has</b> remained on a high-growth trajectory {{over the long}} term. In 2010 the services sector produced 43% of China's annual GDP, second only to manufacturing. However, its proportion of GDP is still low compared to the ratio in more developed countries, and the agricultural sector still employs a larger workforce.|$|E
25|$|Per {{a defense}} {{ministry}} report written by General Guillermo Galván Galván, the Army has 259,770 active duty soldiers, about 0.16 per {{cent of the}} population. Its 1989 budget was 0.7 per cent of the country's Gross National Product (GNP). In 1999, Mexico's military budget increased to 0.9 per cent of its GDP, to US$4.0 billion. Since the year 2000, however, with the economic boost <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>has</b> experienced, the defense budget was decreased to 0.5 per cent of the GDP, and in 2007 had an annual expenditure of US$4 billion. Since President Calderón assumed office in December 2006, he has submitted legislation increasing the budget, in order to fight the drug war against the narcotics cartels, and narcotic drug trafficking in general, that have extended their violent business to each corner of the country. In 2012, Mexico spent US$7.1 billion on its military, amounting to 0.6 per cent of GDP.|$|E
25|$|In late August 1998, he {{proposed}} a law to establish a legal system based on the Islamic principles. His proposal came {{a week after the}} 10-year commemorations of the late president Zia ul-Haq. The Cabinet removed some of its controversial aspects. The National Assembly approved and passed the bill on 10 October 1998 by 151 votes to 16. With majority in Parliament, Sharif drove Pakistan's political system more onto parliamentary system, reverting the previous semi-presidential system and laws fondly enjoyed by president. With passing these amendments, Sharif became the strongest prime minister <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>has</b> ever seen since its independence. However, these amendments failed to achieve a two-thirds majority in the Senate, which was still under control of the Pakistan Peoples Party. Weeks afterward, Sharif's government would suffer a military coup, therefore these amendments went to cold storage after Pervez Musharraf replaced them with his 2002 LFO, putting back the country to semi-presidential system. However, in 2010, Pakistan's Parliament unanimously passed the 18th Amendment, which was passed by both in National Assembly and Senate, putting back the country to the road to parliamentary system.|$|E

25|$|The major {{reform of}} UK road signage to better reflect European {{practice}} happened in two stages. The first {{was associated with}} the first motorway construction project {{and the development of a}} signage system for it by the Anderson Committee of 1957. Although it was additional to the existing signage, it set a number of benchmarks that were developed under the Worboys Committee of 1963 that was largely responsible for the road signage system effected from 1964, which is still current. Until Worboys, the most notable differences between European signs and those in the UK was their reliance on symbols without text wherever possible, thereby increasing the internationalism of their 'language', together with their combined nature, for instance the warning signs having the symbol inside the triangle instead of on a separate information plate. The Worboys Committee recommended that such practices were adopted in the UK and the 'New Traffic Signs' of 1964 were part of the most comprehensive reformation of the UK streetscape <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>has</b> experienced. Unlike previous government efforts to regulate signage, which tended to be cumulative, Worboys argued a modernist position of starting from zero, with all previous signs being deemed obsolete, illegal even, therefore subject to total and systematic replacement. As a result, local authorities were charged with massive resignage programmes. Order and Prohibition signs were almost all replaced within a couple of years, with the warning and direction signs taking somewhat longer. Few pre-1964 warning signs survived more than about ten years, and, while direction signs were similarly replaced, more have survived as they were not deemed as essential as the others in regulatory terms.|$|E
500|$|Wollstonecraft spends {{several large}} {{sections}} of Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark speculating about the possibilities {{of social and political}} revolution and outlining a trajectory for the progress of civilization. In comparing Norway with Britain and France, for example, she argues that the Norwegians are more progressive because they have a free press, embrace religious toleration, distribute their land fairly, and have a politically active populace. However, her description of Norway's [...] "golden age" [...] becomes less rhapsodic after she discovers <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>has</b> no universities or scientists.|$|E
500|$|Fantala was {{the first}} {{tropical}} cyclone to threaten the Farquhar Group since Cyclone Bondo in 2006. Most of the 34residents on Farquhar Atoll evacuated ahead of the storm, and those that remained behind were uninjured. While moving through the Seychelles near peak intensity, Fantala had estimated 10-minute sustained winds of 250km/h (155mph), and days later it moved through the region again with 10-minute sustained winds estimated at 130km/h (80mph). Based on satellite imagery, {{it was estimated that}} of the 50structures on Farquhar Atoll, 19 were destroyed and 27 sustained severe damage. Only four buildings, which were constructed to be cyclone-proof after Bondo, withstood the estimated 350km/h (220mph) gusts, even then suffering moderate damage. In addition, many of the island's trees were knocked down. Due to the storm's prolonged passage through the island group, the Seychelles government declared the Farquhar islands as a disaster area on 20 April. In a visit to the Seychelles, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>has</b> become [...] "highly vulnerable to storm surges, as we are reminded by the recent devastating effects of Cyclone Fantala." [...] A World Bank survey team found $4.5 million in damage. The lodge on the island was not expected to be rebuilt until March 2017, about 11 months after the storm. In April 2017, the development of two new islands in the lagoon of Farquhar's lagoon was attributed to the cyclone.|$|E
