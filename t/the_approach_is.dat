5|$|Guthy-Renker sells Proactiv {{as part of}} a {{continuity}} program, {{also known}} as a negative-option offer, whereby customers are sent repeat orders until they cancel. When purchasing directly from the company, customers automatically become members of a Proactiv club. A month after ordering, and every three months thereafter, they are sent a three-month supply costing $60 (in the US as of 2011), plus shipping and handling. They are billed monthly until they cancel the subscription. <b>The</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> based on the customer lifetime value model.|$|E

A uniform description of <b>the</b> two <b>approaches</b> <b>is</b> given for this purpose. <b>The</b> two <b>approaches</b> {{turn out to}} be able to handle similar classes of theories in principle. However, theories are typically handled efficiently by one of <b>the</b> <b>approaches</b> and inefficiently by the other. In this sense, <b>the</b> <b>approaches</b> <b>are</b> complementary.

25|$|Generally, <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> {{to focus}} on the present problem, rather than the abuse itself. Treatment is highly varied and depends on the personâ€™s {{specific}} issues.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> {{sometimes}} referred to as megavitamin therapy because its practice evolved out of, and in some cases still uses, doses of vitamins and minerals many times higher than the recommended dietary intake.

25|$|The MOF {{encapsulation}} approach invites {{comparison to}} earlier studies of oxidative catalysis by zeolite-encapsulated Fe(porphyrin) {{as well as}} Mn(porphyrin) systems. The zeolite studies generally employed iodosylbenzene (PhIO), rather than TPHP as oxidant. The difference is likely mechanistically significant, thus complicating comparisons. Briefly, PhIO is a single oxygen atom donor, while TBHP is capable of more complex behavior. In addition, for the MOF-based system, {{it is conceivable that}} oxidation proceeds via both oxygen transfer from a manganese oxo intermediate as well as a manganese-initiated radical chain reaction pathway. Regardless of mechanism, <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> a promising one for isolating and thereby stabilizing the porphyrins against both oxo-bridged dimer formation and oxidative degradation.|$|E
