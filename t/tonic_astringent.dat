Although some ethnobotanical uses have been supported in in vitro experiments, further studies of the individual compounds or chemical classes of compounds responsible for the pharmacological effects and the mechanisms of action are necessary. In addition, the toxicity and the side effects from the use of A. chilensis, as well as clinical trials, require attention...|$|R
40|$|Terminalia chebula (fam. Combretaceae) is {{a staple}} ayurvedic remedy and {{different}} drugs are prepared from its leaves, roots and bark; {{alone or in}} combination with other herbal drugs it represents an esteemed ayurvedic rasayana. The prolonged oral administration of its decoction is considered as a generic detoxifying agent at intestinal and hepatic level and is reputed as a way to “restore normal function” also under the perspective of a reduced risk of cancer, metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. This includes well-being maintenance and the prevention {{of a wide range of}} degenerative diseases involving inflammation, carcinogenesis and oxidative stress. Besides that, traditional uses of T. chebula decoction encompasses digestive, <b>tonic,</b> antipyretic, spasmolytic, <b>astringent,</b> expectorant, antiasthmatic, antiviral and hypoglycemic purposes and such bioactivities are related to the presence of polyphenolic compounds. However, no reports are available on the phytochemical profile of the traditional pharmaceutical form actually employed in the ayurvedic medicine and on its chemopreventive properties. In this study, a metabolite profiling of the polyphenol compounds of a T. chebula decoction was performed using HPLC-UV/DAD, HPLC-ESI-MS and MS 2 with an ion trap mass analyzer. The analysis were carried out on an Ascentis C 18 column (250 × 4. 6 mm, 5 µm), with a mobile phase consisting of H 2 O and acetonitrile, both containing 0. 1 % HCOOH. The most relevant constituents were isolated by means of preparative chromatographic techniques from the aqueous and organic fractions obtained from the crude extract; the isolated compounds were characterized by relevant MS and MS 2 data. In particular, chebulic acid, chebulanin, punicalagin, 1, 6 -di-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose and corilagin were isolated from the aqueous phase; gallic acid, 3, 4, 6 -tri-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose, chebulagic acid, chebulinic acid, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 -penta-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose were isolated from the organic phase. The crude decoction, enriched fractions and purified compounds were also tested for their antimutagenic properties against direct and indirect mutagens and for their ability to modulate the EphA 2 -ephrinA 1 system...|$|R
40|$|In an {{irritable}} bowel syndrome (IBS) rat model, S. chinensis {{reversed the}} exaggerated visceral nocicptive responses (judged by abdominal withdrawal reflex and electromyographic measurement) to colorectal distension induced by neonatal maternal separation. Relief of visceral hypersensitivity by S. chinensis {{could be related to}} the decrease of elevated 5 -HT level and the reduction in 5 -HT 3 receptor expression in colon. In summary, given the modulatory effects on intestinal motility and visceral sensation, Schisandra chinensis would be potentially useful for the treatment of relieving diarrhea and visceral pain symptoms in IBS patients. Schisandra lignans, the major absorbable components, can be regarded as the active ingredients in S. chinensis for the potential treatment of IBS. Schisandra chinensis, which is named "Wu-Wei-Zi" in Chinese Pin Yin, is widely used in Chinese medicine as an <b>astringent,</b> <b>tonic</b> and sedative agent. Dibenzo[a,c]-cyclooctadiene lignans are the major components of this herb. In the present study, the chemical constituents of S. chinensis were first characterized. A HPLC-DAD method was developed and validated for quantitative analysis of four major Schisandra lignans, namely, schisandrin (SCH- 1), gomisin A (SCH- 2), deoxyschisandrin (SCH- 3) and gamma-schisandrin (SCH- 4), in the aqueous and ethanolic extracts of S. chinensis. The ethanolic extract contains higher amount of lignan components than aqueous extract. The HPLC method has also been employed to obtain chromatographic fingerprintings to distinguish S. chinensis from a related species, S. sphenanthera. The modulatory effects of both S. chinensis extracts and four major lignans on intestinal motility were evaluated using in vitro intestinal motility assays. The tested compounds induced relaxation on guinea pig ileum contracted by acetylcholine, serotonin and electrical field stimulation, as well as on rat colon with spontaneous contractility. While SCH- 3 was most potent in inhibiting sensorimotor response in guinea pig ileum, SCH- 1 displayed the highest potency of inhibition on spontaneous contraction of rat colon. The relaxant effect on rat colon induced by SCH- 1 has been demonstrated to involve two or more non-adrenergic non-cholinergic mediators. Nitric oxide was likely {{to be one of the}} inhibitory transmitters that involved cGMP-dependent pathways, whereas the non-nitrergic component was apamin-sensitive, but probably excluded vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and adenosine. With the aid of HPLC-DAD-MS for qualitative and quantitative analyses, the absorption of S. chinensis in the rat everted gut sac and human Caco- 2 monolayer in vitro models have been profiled. Fifteen Schisandra lignans were identified as the major absorbable components of S. chinensis in these models. Transport study on SCH- 1 has shown a passive diffusion pathway with high permeability. In an in vivo study, metabolites of Schisandra lignans could be found in rat plasma after a single oral administration of S. chinensis extract. The plasma pharmacokinetics of S. chinensis in rats was further evaluated using simultaneous quantification of four representative Schisandra lignans (SCH- 1, SCH- 2, SCH- 3 and SCH- 4).
