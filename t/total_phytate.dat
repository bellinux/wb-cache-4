40|$|Measurements of <b>total</b> <b>phytate</b> {{phosphorus}} content of diets may be deceptive {{as they do}} not indicate substrate availability for phytase; {{it may be that}} measurements of phytate susceptible to phytase effects are a more accurate measure of phosphorus (P) availability to the bird. To verify this hypothesis, an experiment was conducted to compare diets formulated to contain either high or low susceptible phytate, supplemented with either 0 or 500  FTU/kg phytase. Susceptible phytate was determined by exposing the feed samples to conditions that mimicked the average pH of the proximal gastrointestinal tract (pH 4. 5) and the optimum temperature for phytase activity (37 °C) and then measuring phytate dissolved. Ross 308 birds (n =  240) were fed one of 4 dietary treatments in a 2  ×  2 factorial design; 2 diets with high (8. 54  g/kg, 57. 90 % of <b>total</b> <b>phytate)</b> or low (5. 77  g/kg, 46. 33 % of <b>total</b> <b>phytate)</b> susceptible phytate, containing 0 or 500  FTU/kg phytase. Diets were fed to broilers (12 replicate pens of 5 birds per pen) from d 0 to 28 post hatch. Birds fed diets high in susceptible phytate had greater phytate hydrolysis in the gizzard (P <  0. 001), jejunum (P <  0. 001) and ileum (P <  0. 001) and resulting greater body weight gain (BWG) (P =  0. 015) and lower FCR (P =  0. 003) than birds fed the low susceptible phytate diets, irrespective of phytase presence. Birds fed the high susceptible diets also had greater P solubility in the gizzard and Ca and P solubility in the jejunum and ileum (P <  0. 05) and resulting greater tibia and femur Ca and P (P <  0. 05) content than those fed the low susceptible diets. All the susceptible phytate was fully degraded in the tract in the absence of added phytase, suggesting the assay used in this study was able to successfully estimate the amount of total dietary phytate that was susceptible to the effects of phytase when used at standard levels. No interactions were observed between susceptible phytate and phytase on phytate hydrolysis. Hydrolysis of phytate was greater (P <  0. 05) in the gizzard of birds fed the diets supplemented with phytase, regardless of the concentration of susceptible phytate in the diet. Phytase supplementation resulted in improved BWG (P <  0. 001) and FCR (P =  0. 001), increased P solubility (P <  0. 001) in the gizzard, Ca and P solubility (P <  0. 001) in the jejunum and ileum and Ca and P concentration (P <  0. 001) and strength (P <  0. 001) in the tibia and femur. Pepsin activity was higher in birds fed the diets supplemented with phytase (P <  0. 001) and was greater (P =  0. 031) in birds fed the high susceptible phytate diets compared with the low susceptible phytate diets.

Oat bran was baked under moisture and heat conditions simulating dough preparation and bread-making. BOB had higher insoluble fiber (mainly beta-glucans and Klason lignin), lower <b>total</b> <b>phytate,</b> and diminished levels of highly phosphorylated inositols. NHOB feeding reduced Ca availability and impaired absorption of mineral Ca. Magnesium absorption and retention (percent of intake) were lower in the NHOB groups; due to compensation of Mg output by NHOB intake, daily Mg absorption and retention increased. Fe, Zn, and P showed higher daily absorption and retention in the NHOB groups.

Three Sudanese lentil cultivars (Rubatab, Nadi and Selaim) were germinated for 3 and 6 days. The germinated seeds were dried and milled. Proximate composition, phytic acid content, phytase activity and hydrochloric acid (HCl) extractability of minerals were determined. During germination crude fat and fiber increased, whereas nitrogen free extract (NFE) and food energy decreased. Phytic acid content decreased significantly (p≤ 0. 05) with an increase in germination time.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Microbial phytases (EC 3. 1. 3) {{are widely}} used in diets for {{monogastric}} animals to hydrolyse phytate present in the feed and thereby increase phosphorus and mineral availability. Previous work has shown that phytate solubility is strongly affected by calcium in the feed and by pH in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which may {{have an effect on}} phytase efficacy. An in vitro model simulating the GI tract of pigs was used to study the survival of Peniophora lycii phytase and the effect of the phytase on phytate degradation, inositol phosphate formation and mineral solubilisation during in vitro digestion of a 30 : 70 soybean meal/maize meal blend with different calcium levels. RESULTS: The phytase retained 76 and 80 % of its initial activity throughout the gastric in vitro digestion. <b>Total</b> <b>phytate</b> hydrolysis by P. lycii phytase was in the same range at total calcium levels of 1. 2 and 6. 2 mg g(- 1) dry matter (DM), despite very large differences in phytate solubility at these calcium levels. However, at 11. 2 and 21. 2 mg Ca g(- 1) DM, phytate hydrolysis was significantly lower. The amount of soluble mineral was generally increased by P. lycii phytase. CONCLUSION: Stability of P. lycii phytase during gastric digestion was not found to be critical for phytate hydrolysis. Furthermore, original phytate solubility was not an absolute requirement for phytate degradation; phytate solubility seemed to be in a steady state, allowing insoluble phytate to solubilise as soluble phytate was degraded. This is new and interesting knowledge that adds to the current understanding of phytate-phytase interaction...|$|E
40|$|There {{is little}} {{consensus}} {{as to the}} capability of poultry to utilize dietary phytate without supplemental phytase. Therefore, an experiment was conducted to examine {{the extent to which}} endogenous phytase of intestinal and cereal origin contributes to phytate degradation in birds aged 0 to 14 d posthatch. Ross 308 broilers (n = 720) were fed one of 4 experimental diets with differing dietary ingredient combinations and approximate <b>total</b> <b>phytate</b> levels of 10 g/kg, dietary phytase activity analyzed at 460 U/kg, dietary calcium (Ca) levels of 11 g/kg, and nonphytate-phosphorus (P) levels of 4 g/kg. Broiler performance, gizzard, duodenum, jejunum and ileum pH, Ca and P digestibility and solubility, amount of dietary phytate hydrolyzed in the gizzard, jejunum, and ileal digesta phytase activity were analyzed at d 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 posthatch. Intestinal endogenous phytase activity increased significantly (P < 0. 001) between d 4 and 6, resulting in increased phytate hydrolysis in the gizzard (P = 0. 003), jejunum (P < 0. 001), and ileum (P < 0. 001). Phytase activity and phytate hydrolysis continued to increase with age, with a greater phytase activity and associated increase in phytate hydrolysis and mineral utilization between d 10 and 12. Gizzard and jejunum Ca and P solubility and ileal Ca and P digestibility increased significantly (P < 0. 001), and gastrointestinal pH decreased significantly (P < 0. 001) between d 4 and 6.

Currently, global statistics indicate a widespread increase in iron, zinc, vitamin A deficiencies among vulnerable populations(Sharma, 2003) Also, {{it is important to consider}} the bioavailability of micronutrients from the diet (Frontela et al., 2011) as cereal based staple diets consumed in SA countries contain high amount of phytates, which are known for inhibiting micronutrient absorption. Considering this, the purpose of the present study was to assess dietary diversity among SA women in northwest UK (NW UK) and northwest Pakistan (NW PK), along with investigating the amount of micronutrients (iron, zinc) and inhibitory phytates present in the flour used to make dietary staples from both the study locations. In addition, the micronutrient status (iron and zinc) of women in NW PK was assessed. Dietary data from 40 female participants (18 - 30 years) from NW PK and 15 participants (18 - 30 years) was obtained using three 24 hour dietary recalls. These were used to calculate the dietary diversity score for the women (WDDS). Wheat flour samples obtained from both the geographical regions and these were analysed for their iron and zinc content by atomic absorption spectrophotometry and for <b>total</b> <b>phytate</b> content by a spectrophotometric method. Finally to explore micronutrient status of women, blood samples were obtained for the participants in NW PKand analysed for haemoglobin and plasma zinc concentration. The results revealed that the WDDS for participants across two study regions were significantly different (p< 0. 05), with those in the UK having a significantly higher WDDS (range: 4. 33 - 5. 06 in the UK vs 2. 55 - 3. 02 in PK). Analysis of flour samples revealed that thephytate content of the flour used in the PK community ranged from 230 – 565 mg/ 100 g. This is comparable in terms of phytate content to flour obtained from SA shops in NW UK, which ranged from 273 mg/ 100 g for white flour to 584 mg/ 100 g for wholemeal flour. The average iron and zinc content of the PK flour was also similar to that of wholemeal flour purchased in the UK. Biochemical measures of zinc and iron status of the NW PK women revealed they are likely to be deficient in both of these trace minerals. In conclusion, the study highlighted the paucity of the diet consumed by SA women living in NW PK compared with that of SA women living in NW UK. The low dietary diversity, particularly the infrequent consumption of meat or fish, is likely to have contributed to the poor micronutrient status of the PK women. Strategies to improve this could include demonstration kitchens to provide basic nutritional information on how to make best use of available, affordable foods in order to improve dietary diversity in this community...|$|E

Pigs were blocked by initial BW (18. 5 to 22. 5 kg) into four pens per treatment (trt) of eight crossbred pigs per pen. Two trts were fed; trt 1 contained DC and trt 2 contained NDLP. Three phases were fed; each was four wks in length. Dietary calcium and non-phytate Pw ere computed to provide 0. 75 and 0. 36, 0. 63 and 0. 30, or 0. 55 and 0. 28 % in phases I, II, and III, respectively. Total Pw as computed to provide 0. 57, 0. 50, or 0. 47 % for trt 1; and 0. 47, 0. 40, or 0. 36 % for trt 2, in phases I, II, and III, respectively. Dicalcium phosphate concentration was decreased by 0. 73, 0. 78, and 0. 85 % units in trt 2, for phases I, II, and III, respectively. One gilt per pen was chosen, based on average pen BW (92 to 106 kg), for slaughter at 91 d. All third and fourth metacarpals (MC) and metatarsals (MT) were used to analyze bone-breaking strength. Blood was collected from two pigs per pen at 90 d for serum osteocalcin (OC) analysis (an indicator of bone turnover). Gain/feed (trt 1 = 316, trt 2 = 350, P > 0. 09), BW (trt 1 = 97. 3 kg, trt 2 = 98. 7 kg, P > 0. 71), and ADG (trt 1 = 840 g/d, trt 2 = 860 g, P > 0. 57) were not affected.

Study Design: The study {{was carried out in}} a screen house condition with 104 pots for each genotype (4 treatments x 5 levels x 3 replicates) in a complete randomized design using phytohormones to evaluate their effect on the nutritional values of okra fruits. Place and Duration of Study: The study was carried out at the National Horticultural Research Institute (NIHORT), Ibadan, Oyo state, Nigeria for a period of 60 days. Methodology: Okra seeds were pretreated with IAA (0. 4, 0. 5 and 0. 6 mM) and SA (10 - 2, 10 - 4 and 10 - 6 Mm), and distilled water. The treated (experimental) and untreated (control) seeds were germinated and grown to maturity in polythene bags containing 10 kg of clay soil. Results: Treatment with IAA and SA did not affect proximate composition of okra fruit. Calcium levels were higher in 0. 6 mM IAA 47 - 4 (1. 03 ± 0. 01) and 10 - 4 mM SA (1. 83 ± 0. 04), but in LD 8810 - 4 mM SA (1. 07 ± 0. 03) when compared to control group respectively. Whereas, higher zinc level was observed in 47 - 4 10 - 6 mM SA (3. 93 ± 0. 84) and higher phosphorous level in 47 - 4 10 - 2 mM SA (1. 78 ± 0. 06). Sodium and potassium levels were higher in 0. 6 mM IAA (47 - 4) as 3. 15 ± 0. 01 and 1. 83 ± 0. 02 when compared to the control group.

40|$|The {{phosphorus}} (P) {{requirements of}} meat-type poultry cannot {{be met by}} plant-based diets because approximately two thirds of total phosphorus in cereals and leguminous feed materials is in the unavailable form of phytate (inositol hexaphosphate or phytic acid). Phosphorus supplements are expensive and over supplementation can increase excretion of P, with negative implications on the environment. For some time, research has focussed {{on the development of}} exogenous phytase enzymes capable of releasing phytate phosphorus for absorption, thus reducing the environmental impact of poultry production and requirements for costly dietary inorganic P supplementation. The absolute adoption of this strategy has, however, been stalled by apparent variability in rate of release of phytate by phytase enzyme. The aim of this project was to examine the availability and reactivity of phytate in diets and raw materials fed to broilers in a range of physiological environments, and to develop strategies for combating their effects. A series of in vitro studies and bird trials were conducted to investigate phytate reactivity by observing the relationship between pH, protein phytate interactions and phytate susceptibility to the effects of phytase. A bird trial was undertaken comparing the current commercial level of 500 FTU/kg phytase and a superdose of 5000 FTU/kg phytase in soyabean meal and rapeseed meal based broiler diets. Feeding phytase doses above the commercial recommendation resulted in increased bird performance through phytate destruction, leading to heightened alleviation of the anti-nutritional effects of phytate. This suggests that superdosing broiler diets can improve profitability by both increasing availability of phosphorus and removing restrictions of using cheaper feed ingredients which are viewed as undesirable due to their high phytate content. There is a common misconception that poultry lack any endogenous phytase, but a study sequentially sampling broilers from age d 4 to d 14 illustrated that phytase activity from intestinal mucosa and bacteria and diet is quantifiable in regulating phytate-P digestion. Endogenous phytase contributes significantly towards degradation of phytate at bird age d 4. By d 14, ileal phytase activity levels were approximately 45 U/kg and the amount of <b>total</b> dietary <b>phytate</b> hydrolysed ranged from 21...|$|R

The content and activity {{of water in}} the kernels before and after the pre-germination treatments were measured by oven drying and dew point water analysis, respectively. The total phenolic and phytic acid contents of the kernels were quantified by using Folin-Ciocalteu and a published spectrophotometric assay, respectively.

The total antioxidant capacity of the kernels were measured by 2, 2 ’-diphenyl- 1 - picrylhydrazyl assay. Treatment with water, PBS pH 5 and PBS pH 7 significantly increased the water, total phenolic, (±) -catechin contents and total antioxidant capacity of the almond kernels regardless of the treatment temperatures (25 or 40 °C). The phytic acid and quercetin contents were significantly elevated after the  three treatments at 40 °C. The total phenolic, (±) -catechin, quercetin and phytate contents in the almond kernels contributed significantly to its antioxidant property.

40|$|OBJECTIVES : The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the mineral nutritive value of different traditional African green leafy vegetable (GLV) dishes and their composite meals with fortified and unfortified maize porridge. METHODS : The mineral (iron, zinc, and calcium) and antinutrient (<b>phytate,</b> <b>total</b> phenolics, and tannins) contents and in vitro bioaccessibility of iron and zinc were analyzed. The iron and zinc contents and bioaccessibilities were used to calculate contribution these dishes and meals could make toward the recommended daily requirements and absolute requirements of vulnerable populations. RESULTS : It was found that the GLV dishes contained average amounts of zinc (2. 8 – 3. 2 mg/ 100 g, dry base [db]), but were high in both iron (12. 5 – 23. 4 mg/ 100 g, db) and antinutrients (phytate 1420 – 2089 mg/ 100 g, db; condensed tannins 105 – 203 mg/ 100 g, db). The iron bioaccessibility and amount of bioaccessible iron ranged between 6. 7 % and 45. 2 % and 0. 9 and 5. 11 mg/ 100 g, db, respectively. The zinc bioaccessibility and amount of bioaccessible zinc ranged between 6. 4 % and 12. 7 % and 0. 63 and 1. 63 mg/ 100 g, db, respectively. CONCLUSION : Importantly, although compositing the GLV dishes with fortified maize porridges decreases the iron and zinc contents, because of the low antinutrient content of the maize meal,the amount of bioaccessible iron and zinc in the meal increases.

The diets contained 97. 15 % corn, wheat, high fat-low lignin oat, normal barley or low phytate barley with the cereal grain supplying the sole source of dietary phosphorus. The diets were fed for a 7 day acclimation period followed by a three-day fecal collection. Total tract digestibility coefficients were determined for dry matter, phosphorus and phytate using the indicator method. Fecal phosphorus was characterized using solution state Phosphorus Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (P-NMR). Water Soluble Phosphorus (WSP) and the ratio of WSP to total phosphorus 31 (WSP:TP) were determined in the feces. Digestibility coefficients for phosphorus and phytate ranged from 0. 11 (corn) to 0. 46 (wheat) and 0. 94 (oat) to 1. 00 (corn and low-phytate barley), respectively. There was very little phytate phosphorus excreted in the feces regardless of the type of cereal grain fed (< 6 % of <b>total</b> phosphorus) and <b>phytate</b> degradation was not related to the level of endogenous phytase in the diet. There was a negative relationship between the fecal WSP:TP ratio and the concentration of phosphate monoesters in the feces. In summary, our results indicate that the majority of the phosphorus in the feces of pigs fed cereal grains is present in the form of inorganic phosphate and only trace amounts of phytate are excreted intact. The amount of phytate in the excreta was not related to the amount of phytate or endogenous phytase in the grain. Furthe...|$|R

ABSTRACT: Micronutrients deficiencies are of great concern in the far north Region of Cameroon and can be fought through the promotion of local food resources. Among them are Moringa oleifera leaves which are rich in proteins of good quality, vitamin A, vitamin C, iron and zinc. Our study aims to determine the nutrient composition of local traditional sauces involving Moringa leaves. This was done through {{the identification of the}} various recipes, their implementation and the processing of samples prior to biochemical analyses. The contents in moisture, ash, proteins, lipids were determined by standard AOAC methods. Iron and zinc contents were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry and vitamin C, phenols and phytate by spectrophotometric methods. The results show pH levels ranging from 7. 25 to 8. 63, lipid contents varying from 39. 00 to 58. 30 g/ 100 g DM and proteins content varying from 13. 25 to 29. 48 g/ 100 g DM. Iron and zinc levels were also important, ranging respectively from 5. 86 to 25. 47 mg/ 100 g of DM and 0. 37 to 3. 30 mg/ 100 g of DM.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Seed {{phosphorus}} (P) is {{a fundamental}} energy source that acts on germination and seedling development. In addition to the inorganic P (Pi), the seed also accumulates as phytate salts {{and other forms of}} phosphate compounds denominated organic P (Po). Although necessary for the seed development, an excess of Po may interfere with the accumulation of calcium, iron and zinc nutrients, which are easily complexed with P and become unavailable for human diet and animal feed (RABOY, 2009). The availability of P in the soil or nutrient solution may influence the storage forms of this mineral in the seed. Therefore, the study aimed to evaluate the partition of the absorbed P in common bean genotypes grown in different levels of P in hydroponic solution. MATERIAL AND METHODS The experiment was carried out in the greenhouse at Agronomic Institute of Paraná (IAPAR), Londrina, Paraná, Brazil, in September to December 2015. The experimental design was a randomized block with six replicates and treatments arranged in a factorial design with two genotypes (BRS Estilo and IPR Tangará) and five P levels (2, 4, 6, 8 e 10 mg L- 1). The seedlings with uniform shoot and roots were transplanted into polyethylene pots with capacity 3. 35 L containing nutrient solution Hoagland and Arnon (1950), modified by Pavan and Bingham (1982). The redox potential (pH) and electrical conductivity (EC) of the nutritive solution were monitored daily. The solution was aerated continuously and when the electric conductivity reached 0. 14 dS cm- 2 the nutrient solution was exchanged. To determine total P content the seeds were ground in Perten 3100 mill and submitted to nitroperchloric digestion according to the methodology of Miyazawa et al. (1999). Pi content was extracted according to the method proposed by Raboy and Dickson (1984) and it was quantified by the method described by Chen et al. (1956). Po content was obtained by subtracting the Pi from the <b>total</b> P. The <b>phytate</b> content was determined according to the methodology of Oomah et al. (2008). The data have been subjected to analysis of variance and test Tukey (p ≤ 0. 05) for mean comparison.

40|$|The {{effect of}} heat {{treatment}} of bran {{on the true}} zinc absorption was measured using an isotope-dilution technique. A bran-based breakfast cereal (heated to 204 degrees for 40 min during manufacture) was incorporated into a semi-synthetic diet {{at a level of}} 180 g/kg. A parallel diet was formulated containing an identical weight of untreated bran from the same source plus other ingredients used to make the cereal. 2. Young male Wistar rats (mean weight 80 g) were injected intramuscularly with 65 Zn to label body Zn. They were given the heat-treated- and untreated-bran diets for 9 d. During the last 6 d of this period Zn intakes and faecal and urinary Zn were measured in order to calculate apparent Zn retention. True Zn retention was measured by taking into account losses of Zn of endogenous origin (labelled with 65 Zn), by measuring faecal and urinary radioactivity of endogenous origin. 3. Heat treatment of bran removed approximately one-third of the phytate, but this was not enough to improve Zn absorption from the diet. True Zn retention measured by isotope dilution was significantly higher (P less than 0. 02) than apparent Zn retention measured by the conventional balance technique. 4. The hypothesis that a reduction in particle size of bran would improve mineral availability was tested by feeding coarse and milled bran (100 mg/kg diet) in a semi-synthetic diet to rats and measuring true Fe and apparent Zn absorptions. The importance of phytate was also investigated by feeding a diet containing dephytinized bran. 5. Male Wistar rats (mean weight 172 g) were given diets containing coarse, milled or dephytinized bran for 9 d. Fe and Zn intakes were measured and faeces and urine collected for Fe and Zn analysis. 6. Rhe mean (+/- SE) particle size of the bran was reduced on milling from 3. 5 (+/- 1. 8) to 0. 2 - 0. 5 mm. There were no differences in the fraction of Fe retained between the three groups. Particle size had a small effect on Zn retention which was marginally higher in rats on the milled-bran diet (0. 126 (+/- 0. 023)) than in those on the coarse-bran diet (0. 087 (+/- 0. 012)). <b>Total</b> removal of <b>phytate</b> had a greater effect and apparent Zn retention from the dephytinized-bran diet was significantly higher (0. 182 (+/- 0. 027), P less than 0. 001) ...|$|R

Pigs were fed in a duplicated 5 × 4 incomplete Latin square design (5 diets with 4 periods). Each period consisted of a 5 -d adjustment period followed by a 3 -d total collection of feces and urine and then a 2 -d collection of ileal digesta. The 5 diets included a P-deficient basal diet (0. 43 % Ca and 0. 38 % total P) that was supplemented with 0 (negative control [NC]), 500, 1, 000, or 20, 000 phytase units (FTU) /kg phytase and a positive control (PC) diet that was P adequate (0. 64 % Ca and 0. 52 % total P). The addition of phytase to the NC diet improved (P < 0. 05) AID of phytate from 11. 1 to 62. 8, 70. 6, and 90. 5 % at the inclusion rates of 500, 1, 000, and 20, 000 FTU/kg, respectively. In general, phytase supplementation at a dose of 20, 000 FTU/kg further increased (P < 0. 05) AID of Ca, <b>total</b> P, and <b>phytate</b> and reduced (P < 0. 05) the ileal phytate concentration compared with diets with 500 or 1, 000 FTU/kg phytase. Pigs fed the diet with 20, 000 FTU/kg phytase but not diets with 500 and 1, 000 FTU/kg phytase showed improved (P < 0. 05) ATTD of CP and AID of DM, GE, CP, Leu, Lys, Thr, Val, Asp, and Ser compared with pigs fed the PC or NC diet. However, hindgut disappearance of crude fiber and NDF (P < 0. 05) were reduced in pigs fed the diet with 20, 000 FTU/kg phytase compared with pigs fed the PC or NC diet. Pigs fed diets with 500 or 1, 000 FTU/ kg phytase had greater ATTD and retention of Ca and P than pigs fed the NC diet but less compared with pigs fed the diet with 20, 000 FTU/kg phytase. Supplementation of 20, 000 FTU/kg phytase to the NC diet improved (P < 0. 05) digestibility of Na, Mn, and Zn as well as retention (%) of Zn. Increasing phytase supplementation doses from 0 to 1, 000 FTU/kg linearly improved (P < 0. 05) retention of Mg; meanwhile, digestibility of Mg and Mn and AID of Thr showed a linear increase trend (P = 0. 084).

40|$|Phosphorus (P) {{loss from}} {{agricultural}} fields to freshwater ecosystems is of increasing concern due to elevated soil P levels {{brought on by}} long term and excessive application rates of manure and commercial fertilizers. Both Bray P 1 and Mehlich- 3 P (PM 3) soil tests are used in Indiana to make fertilizer recommendations and to limit manure application rates. The Mehlich- 3 P Saturation Ratio (PSRM 3) has been proposed {{as an alternative to}} PM 3 and the ammonium oxalate degree of P saturation (DPSOX) for assessing the risk of soluble P loss from soils. We assessed the correlations among agronomic soil test methods (PM 3 and Bray P 1), environmental soil test methods (soluble P: deionized water, DW; artificial rainwater, ARW; dilute salt extractable P, DSEP), ammonium oxalate P (POX), total P (TP), and P saturation methods from 565 Indiana surface soil samples. Significant correlations were found among the various STP methods evaluated, and Bray P 1 and PM 3 displayed the strongest coefficient of correlation (r = 0. 93, p 3 ̆c 0. 0001). Mehlich- 3 P had stronger correlations with TP and POX compared to correlations between Bray P 1 and TP and POX, and their correlations were all highly significant (p 3 ̆c 0. 0001). Additionally, all soluble P forms were significantly correlated with Bray P 1, PM 3, and POX, and the correlations between Bray P 1 and all three soluble P measures were consistently greater than those between other soil test methods and the soluble measures. Significant correlations were found between PM 3 and PSRM 3 (r = 0. 93, p 3 ̆c 0. 0001) and between PSRM 3 and DPSOX (r = 0. 92, p 3 ̆c 0. 0001), suggesting that PSRM 3 can be as effective as DPSOX to identify soils with a greater potential to contribute bioavailable (not just soluble) P to surface and ground water. We conclude that both PM 3 and PSRM 3 can be integrated into more comprehensive P loss risk algorithms to mitigate elevated P concentration in surface and ground water. The PSRM 3 can be used as an alternative to PM 3 as it does account for extractable Al and Fe, the primary P sorbents in most soils. Although Bray P 1 is an appropriate soil test based on the data generated in this study, it would not be the most practical soil test as it is not considered a multi-element extraction in most states. Since PM 3 was strongly correlated with Bray P 1 and the benefit of using PM 3 as a multi-element extractant from which the PSRM 3 can be calculated, it is probably the most practical test to use for both agronomic and environmental soil P assessment.

40|$|Phosphorus (P) is a main {{limiting}} factor for agricultural production, but overusing P fertilizer has brought serious environmental damages in China. Improving P acquisition efficiency of agricultural crops is an urgent topic. It {{has been proven}} repeatedly that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and genetic diversity within one crop plant can play important roles in P uptake by crops. The main objective of this thesis {{was to understand the}} role of the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in P acquisition efficiency of different maize varieties. The specific objectives were to test: 1) how P uptake by maize varieties responds to colonization by the native AMF community in the field; and 2) whether AMF hyphae take up P for plants from phytate which is the most abundant organic P form in soil; 3) whether mixing maize cultivars can improve maize productivity and whether AMF can play a role in this system; and 4) how AMF species (or community) legacy affects successional maize growth. In this thesis, I combined field experiments and greenhouse experiments and made use of maize genetic diversity and (native) AMF to improve P (including inorganic and organic P) acquisition. The effects of one single AMF species on maize growth and nutrient uptake have been well studied, but how maize varieties respond to the native AMF community has been insufficiently studied. In Chapter 2, I focused on how maize varieties responded to the native AMF community by using rotated cores in the field, to compare mycorrhizal responsiveness among 20 maize varieties and the difference of the AMF native community of four maize varieties (two old landraces and two modern hybrids). The results indicated that, 1) increased P fertilizer significantly reduced mycorrhizal responsiveness in the field; 2) a complicated relationship exists between mycorrhizal responsiveness in the field and pot experiment; 3) {{there was no significant difference}} between old and modern maize varieties in terms of mycorrhizal responsiveness and colonization; 4) there were only small differences in AMF community composition among the four maize varieties. By comparing mycorrhizal responsiveness of maize varieties between in the pot experiment and in the field experiment (with in-growth cores), I found mycorrhizal responsiveness of maize varieties in the pot experiment was significantly larger than that in the field experiment. Thus, mycorrhizal responsiveness of varieties within one cereal plant species tested classically in pots may not present their realistically mycorrhizal responsiveness in field. Phytate is the most abundant form of organic P in soil. To explore the potential of phytate utilization by plants is agriculturally and environmentally essential. Increased P nutrition of mycorrhizal plants derived from phytate has been reported, indicating that phytate can be a potential P source. However, earlier studies assessed phytate use by using acid phosphatase rather than phytase, and did not consider that phytate adsorption could lead to phosphate release. Thus, I investigated the effect of mycorrhizal hyphae-mediated phytase activity on P uptake by maize in Chapter 3. I conducted a rhizobox experiment to explore phytate use by mycorrhizal hyphae for two maize varieties. The results showed that: 1) phytate addition increased phytase and acid phosphatase activity, and resulted in increased P uptake and plant biomass; 2) the increase in P uptake and biomass were correlated with the increase of phytase activity but not with the increase of acid phosphatase activity; 3) lower phytate addition rate increased, but higher addition rates decreased hyphal length density. I conclude that P from phytate can be used by mycorrhizal plants, but that the phytate contribution to plant nutrition is likely limited. Phytase activity is a more relevant indicator to assess phytate use. In addition, there was a significant interaction between maize varieties and AMF species in taking up P from phytate, which implies there is a possibility to combine different maize varieties to increase <b>total</b> yield using <b>phytate.</b> Besides, I used an empirical relationship to assess phosphate release due to phytate addition. My calculation implies that phosphate desorption cannot be ignored when assessing phytate use, particularly when a large amount of phytate is applied as a P source. In multispecies natural ecosystems, AMF can play a key role in enhancing plant productivity. However, their role in enhancing crop productivity in mixed cropping systems is still poorly understood. In Chapter 4, I conducted both greenhouse and field experiments to investigate whether mixing maize varieties with different P acquisition strategies could lead to overyielding, and what roles AMF play in this system with two maize varieties. The results showed that mixing maize varieties resulted in overyielding, both in P uptake and shoot biomass, but only when plants were mycorrhizal. At the same time, I found higher hyphal length density and higher AMF diversity in mixtures compared to the monocultures in the field experiment, and higher colonization rate and higher hyphal length density in mixtures in the pot experiment. Thus, I propose that overyielding by mixing maize varieties might be due to increased mycorrhizal performance leading to more P uptake. I also used the partitioning formula to calculate the contribution through the selection effect and complementarity effect to overyielding. I found that the increase of the total yield and P uptake in mixtures was largely due to complementarity effect, implying that relative overyielding and enhanced P uptake were not due to enhanced competitive ability by the larger variety. The results of Chapter 4 suggest that mixing mycorrhizal maize varieties might be beneficial for enhancing productivity and P uptake efficiency. Plant - soil feedback experiments have shown that AMF can play a crucial role in determining the direction and magnitude of that feedback. Most studies investigated plant - soil feedback dynamics between different plant species. However, it is unknown to what extent one variety of an agricultural crop can affect the performance of another variety of that same crop through plant - soil feedback. In Chapter 5, I carried out a two-phase experiment in a greenhouse, including conditioning phase and test phase to determine plant - soil feedbacks in the absence and presence of AMF species or community, to test the effects of AMF on feedback dynamics. The results in Chapter 5 showed that: 1) in the conditioning phase, both maize varieties were differentially influenced by different AMF species compared to non-mycorrhizal control; 2) in the feedback phase, non-mycorrhizal maize exhibited negative feedback dynamics for biomass and P-uptake; 3) on the feedback phase, mycorrhizal maize generally exhibited positive feedback dynamics for biomass and P-uptake. The interaction coefficient was largest with the mixture of three different AMF species. The interaction coefficient for shoot and P uptake were significantly correlated with the coefficient for mycorrhizal colonization. These results imply that different maize varieties are affected differently by different AMF species, thereby influencing the productivity of the subsequent maize variety. The results also raise questions how AMF influence rhizosphere biota and how maize varieties may select more beneficial AMF. In Chapter 6, I integrate the results from previous chapters. I discuss possible relationships between (negative) plant - soil feedback effect (due to pathogen) and the mycorrhizal effect on overyielding and improved P uptake due to mixing maize varieties (compared to the monoculture). I also discuss the linkage between phosphorus acquisition efficiency and mycorrhizal responsiveness within one crop species, and the relationship between plant genetic diversity and plant - soil feedback effects, and try to come up with a conceptual model how mixing maize varieties in the presence of AMF could be beneficial...|$|R
