Phage-derived sequences {{are more}} common in pathogenic than nonpathogenic taxa and are associated with changes in pathogen virulence. High abundance and mobilization of <b>temperate</b> <b>phages</b> within hosts suggests that <b>temperate</b> <b>phages</b> could promote within-host evolution of bacterial pathogens. However, their role in pathogen evolution has not been experimentally tested. We experimentally evolved replicate populations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{with or without a}} community of three <b>temperate</b> <b>phages</b> active in cystic fibrosis (CF) lung infections, including the transposable phage, ɸ 4, which is closely related to phage D 3112. Populations grew as free-floating biofilms in artificial sputum medium, mimicking sputum of CF lungs where P. aeruginosa is an important pathogen and undergoes evolutionary adaptation and diversification during chronic infection. Although bacterial populations adapted to the biofilm environment in both treatments, population genomic analysis revealed that phages altered both the trajectory and mode of evolution. Populations evolving with phages exhibited a greater degree of parallel evolution and faster selective sweeps than populations without phages. Phage ɸ 4 integrated randomly into the bacterial chromosome, but integrations into motility-associated genes and regulators of quorum sensing systems essential for virulence were selected in parallel, strongly suggesting that these insertional inactivation mutations were adaptive. <b>Temperate</b> <b>phages,</b> and in particular transposable phages, are therefore likely to facilitate adaptive evolution of bacterial pathogens within hosts...|$|R

40|$|Bacteria and phages have {{traditionally}} been viewed as 'antagonists'. However, <b>temperate</b> <b>phages</b> can transfer genes, which can broaden their bacterial hosts' metabolic repertoire, confer or enhance virulence, or eliminate competing organisms, and so enhance bacterial fitness. Recent evidence shows that phages can also promote biofilm formation leading to population-level benefits for their bacterial hosts. Here, we provide a perspective on the ecological and evolutionary consequences for the bacteria interacting with phages, when phage and host interests are aligned. Furthermore, we examine the question whether bacterial hosts can lower immune barriers to phage infection, thereby facilitating infection by beneficial phages. Taking recent evidence together, we suggest {{that in many cases}} <b>temperate</b> <b>phages</b> are to be considered as being mutualistic as well as parasitic, at the same time. <b>Temperate</b> <b>phages</b> can provide a plethora of benefits to bacterial hosts, including the ability to respond rapidly to changes in the environment. Bacterial biofilms can benefit from lysogeny. When phages are induced in a few cells, the lysing cells release nutrients and extracellular DNA locally, which may strengthen biofilm structure. Further, lysis breaks biofilm bonds, allowing for enhanced cell dispersal. In bacterial competition, phages can facilitate bacteriocin release or act as 'weapons' against competitors themselves. Recent evidence indicates that bacterial populations may modulate phage infections, as individual cells may lose immunity or selectively allow infections to occur.

Further analysis of genetic structure in all known groups of phages active on other bacterial hosts such as Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Mycobacterium and Streptococcus thermophilus confirmed the existence of two types of genetic structure related to the phage way of life. This might reflect different intensities of horizontal DNA exchange: low among purely virulent phages and high among <b>temperate</b> <b>phages</b> and their lytic homologues.

40|$|Bacteriophages are {{the most}} {{abundant}} organisms on the planet and both lytic and <b>temperate</b> <b>phages</b> play key roles as shapers of ecosystems and drivers of bacterial evolution. <b>Temperate</b> <b>phages</b> can choose between (i) lysis: exploiting their bacterial hosts by producing multiple phage particles and releasing them by lysing the host cell, and (ii) lysogeny: establishing a potentially mutually beneficial relationship with the host by integrating their chromosome into the host cell's genome. <b>Temperate</b> <b>phages</b> exhibit lysogeny propensities in the curiously narrow range of 5 – 15 %. For some <b>temperate</b> <b>phages,</b> the propensity is further regulated by the multiplicity of infection, such that single infections go predominantly lytic while multiple infections go predominantly lysogenic. We ask whether these observations {{can be explained by}} selection pressures in environments where multiple phage variants compete for the same host. Our models of pairwise competition, between phage variants that differ only in their propensity to lysogenize, predict the optimal lysogeny propensity to fall within the experimentally observed range. This prediction is robust to large variation in parameters such as the phage infection rate, burst size, decision rate, as well as bacterial growth rate, and initial phage to bacteria ratio. When we compete phage variants whose lysogeny strategies are allowed to depend upon multiplicity of infection, we find that the optimal strategy is one which switches from full lysis for single infections to full lysogeny for multiple infections. Previous attempts to explain lysogeny propensity have argued for bet-hedging that optimizes the response to fluctuating environmental conditions. Our results suggest that there is an additional selection pressure for lysogeny propensity within phage populations infecting a bacterial host, independent of environmental conditions...|$|R
50|$|Cyanophage {{replication}} has two dominant cycles: the lytic {{cycle and}} the lysogenic cycle. Viral nucleic-acid replication and immediate synthesis of virus-encoded protein {{is considered to}} be the lytic cycle. Phages are considered lytic if they only have the capacity to enter the lytic cycle; whereas, <b>temperate</b> <b>phage</b> can either enter the lytic cycle or become stabely integrated with the host genome and enter the lysogenic cycle. To meet the metabolic demand of replication, viruses recruit a multitude of strategies to sequester nutrients from their host. One such technique is to starve their host cell. This is done by inhibiting the host cells CO2 fixation, which enables the cyanophage to recruit photosynthetically formed redox and ATP from the host cell to meet their nucleotide and metabolic response. Many cyanophages contain genes known as viral-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs), which encode critical, rate-limiting steps of the host organism. AMGs encode genes for the pentose phosphate pathway, phosphate acquisition, sulfur metabolism, and DNA/RNA processing; these genes interfere with the metabolism of the host cell. Metagenomic analysis highly supports the notion that these genes promote viral replication through the degradation of host DNA and RNA, as well as a shift in host-cell metabolism to nucleotide biosynthesis. Cyanophages also use these genes to maintain host photosynthesis through the progression of the infection, shuttling the energy away from carbon fixation to anabolism, which the virus takes advantage of. AMGs also code for proteins, which aid in the repair of the host photosystem, which is susceptible to photodegradation. One such example is the D1 proteins which replace the host cells D1 protein when it becomes damaged. The virus up-regulates photosynthesis, which leads to an increased rate of D1 protein degradation, the host cell alone can not efficiently replace these proteins so the cyanophage replaces them for the host cell, allowing it to continue providing energy for the cyanophage replication cycle.|$|E

40|$|Background: Phages are {{viruses that}} infect bacteria. Following {{infection}} of a bacterial cell, <b>temperate</b> <b>phages</b> may replicate via {{one of two}} distinct pathways, known as lysis and lysogeny. Lysis involves the synthesis {{of a large number}} of phage particles, which are then released when the host cell is lysed (i. e. burst open). In lysogenic reproduction, the infecting phage genome is inserted into the genome of the host cell (forming a lysogen cell), and is then replicated via normal bacterial cell division. Lysogens may also undergo lysis in a process known as induction. Questions: How does the virulence of <b>temperate</b> <b>phages</b> evolve over time? How do environmental conditions influence this evolution? Mathematical methods: The methods of adaptive dynamics are used to determine the location and nature of evolutionary singularities. These singularities determine the direction in which evolution proceeds. Key assumptions: Over long periods of time, the probability of lysogeny (p) and the induction rate (i) within a population of <b>temperate</b> <b>phages</b> may evolve via small mutations. There is a trade-off relationship between the parameters p and i. Predictions: The evolutionary singularities may be either attractors or repellors, depending on whether the trade-off cost is accelerating or decelerating. Marginally ESS attractors, which are convergent stable and borderline evolutionarily stable, may also occur. Branching point singularities, which are associated with speciation, do not occur in this framework. A decrease in the level of resources in the environment per susceptible bacterium cell results in a shift towards greater phage virulence...|$|R
