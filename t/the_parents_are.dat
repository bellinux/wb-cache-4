5|$|Anthozoan larvae {{either have}} large yolks or {{are capable of}} feeding on plankton, and some already have endosymbiotic algae that help to feed them. Since <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> <b>are</b> immobile, these feeding {{capabilities}} extend the larvae's range and avoid overcrowding of sites. Scyphozoan and hydrozoan larvae have little yolk and most lack endosymbiotic algae, and therefore have to settle quickly and metamorphose into polyps. Instead, these species rely on their medusae to extend their ranges.|$|E
5|$|The {{back story}} in the {{published}} synopsis differs from the actual production in a few aspects. When the organ grinder takes the children back to his hovel, the inter-title states {{they are forced to}} dance. In the synopsis, it states the children are instructed to dance to the hurdy-gurdy. The organ grinder does not play a hurdy-gurdy. In the published synopsis <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> <b>are</b> named Eugenie Freeman and Paul Temple. However, the letter the father receives is addressed to Paul Tilden. The letter informs him of Joseph Tilden's death and of the $100,000 inheritance.|$|E
5|$|The nest {{is usually}} a {{depression}} in the ground, {{which may or may}} not be lined with bits of grass or similar materials. The eggs are mottled and camouflaged. Both sexes share incubation duties. The young hatch after 22–27 days and fledge after 21–24 days. If <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> <b>are</b> disturbed and flush from the nest frequently the incubation period could be extended to as long as 34 days.|$|E
50|$|To {{apply the}} law of concern to {{concerns}} involving German limited liability companies, the German courts have created the qualified de facto concern, beginning in the 1970s. This form of concern applies only in parent subsidiary relationships. If <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> <b>is</b> shown to have a long-standing and pervasive control over {{the affairs of the}} subsidiary, then there is a presumption that <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> <b>was</b> not acting {{in the best interests of}} the subsidiary.

5|$|The {{production}} is postponed and <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> <b>are</b> {{out looking for}} work when a prospective tenant appears. Mrs. O'Brien shows him the room and he is interested, but {{does not know what}} to do with the children. Mrs. O'Brien puts the children out onto the street where they dance to the music played by an organ grinder. The organ grinder earns more money from their dancing and he entices the children to return to his hovel and teaches them to dance. The organ grinder instructs them to dance for money. The children are rescued by a theater manager and finds them a place in the theater program.|$|E
5|$|Convict {{cichlids}} {{may show}} extended biparental care and adopt unrelated young {{of the same}} species of similar or smaller body size compared to their own biological offspring. The parents may benefit by adopting smaller young by taking advantage of the dilution effect, which is when the risk of predation for an individual is reduced because the group size is larger. Another reason that has been considered is that foreign young that are larger than the biological offspring may be a direct predatory threat to them. However, {{it has been shown that}} as the biological offspring develop and become stronger swimmers, <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> <b>are</b> less active about rejecting larger foreign young, but when they do reject, often foreign young are rejected before they are large enough to be perceived as a direct threat to the biological offspring. Thus, it can be concluded that the brood adoption and rejection rely more heavily on the protection of the biological offspring from differential predator instead of from larger adopted cichlids.|$|E
5|$|Mockingbird nests {{are also}} often parasitized by cowbirds. <b>The</b> <b>parents</b> <b>are</b> found to reject {{parasitic}} eggs at an intermediate rate. A recent study {{has shown that}} foreign eggs {{are more likely to}} be rejected from a nest later in the breeding season than from earlier in a breeding season. Early nesting hosts may not have learned the pattern and coloration of their first clutch yet, so are less likely to reject foreign eggs. There is also a seasonal threshold in terms of the overlap between the breeding seasons of the northern mockingbirds and their parasites. If the breeding season of the parasites starts later, there is less likelihood of parasitism. Hence, it pays the hosts to have relatively lower sensitivity to parasitic eggs.|$|E

25|$|There {{appears to}} be no {{particular}} season for breeding. However, females with a large young in the pouch and a young on the back have been seen in March, July, August and September. Although the gestation period information is not available for the species, it is known that close relatives have gestation periods from 16 to 30 days. The new offspring spends its first five weeks in the female's large pouch which has two teats. The parents usually carry the new offspring on their back after they have left the mother's pouch. Caring for the young is divided nearly equally among the parents. <b>The</b> <b>parents</b> <b>are</b> assisted in raising the offspring by the previous offspring who commonly stay with the family unit. The parents practice protective behaviours such as spend time watching for predators, tail beating, and vocalizing and marshaling the young to keep them relatively close.|$|E
