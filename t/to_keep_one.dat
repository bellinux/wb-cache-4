Fox was supported on his run by Doug Alward, who drove the van and cooked meals.|$|E
5|$|Her cell was 6 × 12ft (1.8 x 3.6m) with no window, {{containing}} a bed, toilet and sink. The jail had 30 cells {{built in a}} U shape, and although detainees could talk to one another, {{they were unable to}} see each other. Her lawyer said the guards behaved professionally, and had not tried to harass or embarrass Manning. She was allowed to walk for up to one hour a day, meals were taken in the cell, and she was shackled during visits. There was access to television when it was placed in the corridor, and she was allowed <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>one</b> magazine and one book. Because she was in pretrial detention, she received full pay.|$|E

5|$|The Checkers {{speech or}} Fund speech was an address made on September 23, 1952, by the Republican {{candidate}} {{for vice president}} of the United States, California Senator Richard Nixon. Nixon had been accused of improprieties relating to a fund established by his backers to reimburse him for his political expenses. With his place on the Republican ticket in doubt, he flew to Los Angeles and delivered a half-hour television address in which he defended himself, attacked his opponents, and urged the audience to contact the Republican National Committee (RNC) to tell it whether he should remain on the ticket. During the speech, he stated that regardless of what anyone said, he intended <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>one</b> gift: a black-and-white dog who had been named Checkers by the Nixon children, thus giving the address its popular name.|$|E

A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a point challenge system, which allows a player to contest the line call of a point, a system known as Hawk-Eye.|$|E

25|$|The {{traditional}} {{means of}} transport for the cowboy, even in the modern era, is by horseback. Horses can travel over terrain that vehicles cannot access. Horses, along with mules and burros, also serve as pack animals. The most important horse on the ranch is the everyday working ranch horse that can perform {{a wide variety of}} tasks; horses trained to specialize exclusively in one set of skills such as roping or cutting are very rarely used on ranches. Because the rider often needs <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>one</b> hand free while working cattle, the horse must neck rein and have good cow sense—it must instinctively know how to anticipate and react to cattle.|$|E

25|$|In 1976, Deborah Gardner {{was found}} murdered {{in her home}} in Tonga, where she was serving in the Peace Corps. Dennis Priven, a fellow Peace Corps worker, was later charged with the murder by the Tonga government. He {{was found not guilty}} by reason of insanity, and was sentenced to serve time in a mental {{institution}} in Washington D.C. Privan was never admitted to any institution, and the handling of the case has been heavily criticized. The main criticism has been that the Peace Corps seemingly worked <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>one</b> of its volunteers from being found guilty of murder, due to the reflection it would have on the organization.|$|E
25|$|Fresh air {{for both}} the crew and engine was drawn into the tank via an 18m long rubber hose to which a float was {{attached}} <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>one</b> end above the water’s surface. A radio antenna was also attached to the float to provide communication between the tank crew and the transport barge. The tank's engine was converted to be cooled with seawater, and the exhaust pipes were fitted with overpressure valves. Any water seeping into the tank's hull could be expelled by an internal bilge pump. Navigation underwater was accomplished using a directional gyrocompass or by following instructions radioed from the transport barge.|$|E
25|$|In the new {{iteration}} of Rulebook 10, mandatory handicaps for the snitch runner go {{into effect}} if the snitch has not been caught within a certain time. These handicaps are cumulative and remain in effect {{until the end of}} the game. Once the seekers are released, the runner must remain between the two keeper zones. If the snitch has not been caught at the 23-minute mark, the first handicap is issued, requiring the runner to stay within 1.5 yards of mid-pitch. The second handicap, at 28 minutes, constrains the runner <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>one</b> arm behind their back; the third and final one, at 33 minutes, restricts him/her to within 1.5 yards of the intersection of mid-pitch and the sideline opposite the scorekeeper and benches.|$|E

25|$|Aegina {{had always}} {{been exposed to the}} raids of corsairs and had oppressive {{governors}} during these last 30years of Venetian rule. Venetian nobles were not willing to go to this island. In 1533, three rectors of Aegina were punished for their acts of injustice and there is a graphic account of the reception given by the Aeginetans to the captain of Nauplia, who came to command an enquiry into the administration of these delinquents (vid. inscription over the entrance of St. George the Catholic in Paliachora). The rectors had spurned their ancient right to elect an islander <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>one</b> key of the money-chest. They had also threatened to leave the island en masse with the commissioner, unless the captain avenged their wrongs. To spare the economy of the community, it was ordered that appeals from the governor's decision should be made on Crete, instead of in Venice. The republic was to pay a bakshish to the Turkish governor of the Morea and to the voivode who was stationed at the frontier of Thermisi (opposite Hydra). The fortifications too, were allowed to become decrepit and were inadequately guarded.|$|E
25|$|During the Forever Evil storyline, Scarecrow {{learns that}} Bane {{may be the}} cause of the Blackgate {{uprising}} and will be their leader in the impending war, and that Talons were stored at Blackgate on ice. Bane, having escaped Peña Dura Prison in Santa Prisca, ships his Venom to Gotham City to be there for when he arrives. As he is traveling to Gotham, he orchestrates the release of Blackgate's prisoners during the Crime Syndicate's broadcast to the world. Later, on board his ship, he prepares his men for the impending war with Scarecrow, and with Gotham in the distant, claims it will be his. Bane enters Blackgate through the sewers to join the prisoners there. While there, he comes across where the Talons are stored hoping to make them in to his weapons. While the attack on Gotham City begins between Bane's men and the GCPD, Bane also approaches Professor Pyg, forcing him to join his cause, and spread word that everything in Gotham is now controlled by Bane. Bane arrives at Blackgate as Man-Bat and his fellow bats are attempting to transport the Talons to Mr. Freeze and is able <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>one</b> from leaving. Bane retrieves Emperor Penguin for the Penguin as part of their agreement.|$|E
25|$|On November 15, 1960, {{with the}} arrival of the R27s, service on the Brighton Line was as follows: Express was {{designated}} as Q, local via tunnel as QT, and local via bridge as QB. Single letters were used to refer to express lines and double letters for local lines, a practice that began thirty years earlier with the Independent Subway System (IND). However, these designations were not as yet in common usage, and the R27 signs continued to display the old route names. For the above reasons and for the sake of continuity and consistency, these services were referred to by the old route names until the time of the opening of the Chrystie Street Connection. Moreover, it was deemed more important and informative to indicate how the trains actually operated rather than how the letters were manipulated. Starting January 1, 1961, weekday Brighton Express service terminated at 57th Street–Seventh Avenue all day. On Saturdays, these trains provided local service between Franklin Avenue and Brighton Beach. This service was merged into the Franklin Avenue Shuttle service on October 14, 1961, and was discontinued altogether in February 1963. (The Sunday service to Brighton Beach had been discontinued on January 1, 1961.) Brighton Local service ran to Astoria – Ditmars Boulevard at all times. On Saturdays, they provided express service on the Brighton Line, and ran local all other times. This service change was essentially a swap between the north terminals of the Brighton Local and Fourth Avenue Local, and between the Brighton Express and West End Express. Prior to this time, both Brighton services operated via the 60th Street Tunnel to Queens. This change served <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>one</b> Brighton service available in the event of a massive delay in the 60th Street Tunnel.|$|E

500|$|Beginning on 4 December, four {{infantry}} divisions—one British, one Canadian, one Indian and one New Zealand (which {{included an}} armoured brigade)—and two armoured brigades (one British and one Canadian) of V Corps and XIII Corps attacked heavily defended German positions along the Moro River, achieving several exploitable bridgeheads by 8 December. Throughout the next week, nearly continuous combat operations by both sides—designed <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>one</b> another pinned down—created stagnated defensive positions near Orsogna and a narrow pit known as [...] "The Gully". After {{being held at}} the Gully for 10 days, the Canadians succeeded in outflanking German defences, and forcing a German withdrawal to the Ortona–Orsogna Line. On 20 December, the line was attacked by both corps.|$|E
500|$|Thomas was {{described}} by her doctor George Henry Rudd as [...] "a small, well-dressed lady" [...] who was about fifty-four years old. Elliot O'Donnell, summing up contemporary accounts {{in his introduction to}} a transcript of Webster's trial, said that Thomas had an [...] "excitable temperament" [...] and was regarded by her neighbours as eccentric. She frequently travelled, leaving her friends and relatives unaware of her whereabouts for weeks or months at a time. She {{was a member of the}} lower middle class and as such was not wealthy, but she habitually dressed up and wore jewellery to give the impression of prosperity. Her desire to employ a live-in domestic servant probably had as much to do with status as with practicality. However, she had a reputation for being a harsh employer and her irregular habits meant that she had difficulty finding and retaining servants.
