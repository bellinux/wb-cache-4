40|$|This paper examines, in {{the context}} of {{distributed}} execution, the meaning of Ada constructs involving time. In the process, unresolved questions of interpretation and problems with the implementation of a consistent notion of time across a network are uncovered. It is observed that there are two Ada mechanisms that can involve a distributed sense of time: the conditional entry call, and the <b>timed</b> <b>entry</b> call. It is shown that a recent interpretation by the Language Maintenance Committee resolves the questions for the conditional entry calls but results in an anomaly for <b>timed</b> <b>entry</b> calls. A detailed discussion of alternative implementations for the <b>timed</b> <b>entry</b> call is made, and it is aruged that: (1) <b>timed</b> <b>entry</b> calls imply a common sense of time between the machines holding the calling and called tasks; and (2) the measurement of time for the expiration of the delay and the decision of whether or not to perform the rendezvous should be made on the machine holding the called task. The need to distinguish the unreadiness of the called task from timeouts caused by network failure is pointed out. Finally, techniques for realizing a single sense of time across the distributed system (at least to within an acceptable degree of uncertainty) are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|Generic {{medicine}} availability {{is crucial}} for maintaining the Malaysian heavily subsidised public healthcare system, and for reducing rising national pharmaceutical expenditure. This paper analyses the <b>time</b> to <b>entry</b> of generic medicines following patent expiration on innovator drug products in Malaysia. This study utilised a robustly constructed dataset of 12 best-selling single-entity prescription drug products that experienced loss of patent protection and subsequent generic entry between January 2001 and December 2009. <b>Time</b> to <b>entry</b> was measured as the time lag between expiration dates of basic patent of the innovator active drug substances and marketing approval dates of the first generic equivalents. Patent data of the drug substances were sourced from Malaysian and international patent databases. Marketing approval data of both the innovator and generic drug products were sourced from the product registration databases of the Malaysian drug regulatory authority. A total of 154 (mean (M) =[*] 12. 83, standard deviation (SD) =[*] 9. 61) generic entries occurred during the data period for the entire 12 active drug substances. The mean <b>time</b> to <b>entry</b> (in days) following basic patent expiration was 396. 92 (SD[*]=[*] 507. 49). A {{significant difference was found}} between the hypothesised <b>time</b> to <b>entry</b> and the study mean <b>time</b> to <b>entry.</b> <b>Time</b> to generic <b>entry</b> in Malaysia is significantly delayed beyond the day following basic patent expiration of innovator product, thereby delaying the onset of generic competition with potential negative implications on pharmaceutical expenditure.
