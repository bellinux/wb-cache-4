5|$|In {{contrast}} to the novella, in which the physical transformation of Jekyll into Hyde is revealed near the end, most dramatic adaptations show it early in the play, because <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>is</b> familiar with the story. As one of its first adapters, Sullivan worked {{in an environment where}} the transformation would still shock the audience, and he held the reveal until the third act.|$|E
5|$|Bart and his catchphrase {{continue}} to be popular, while Krusty creates {{a wide array of}} merchandise featuring Bart's likeness. Bart becomes sick of his fame and begins to fear that the fad will wear off, so he tries to expand his act and personality during an interview on Conan O'Brien's late-night talk show, to no avail. Bart decides to stop performing, but Marge convinces him that he should continue because he makes people happy. Bart arrives at Krusty's show and enthusiastically delivers his line, but <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>is</b> bored with the line and does not react. With fans no longer interested in Bart, Krusty ditches him.|$|E

5|$|Eddard's party {{arrives at}} King's Landing. Eddard is {{immediately}} summoned {{to a meeting}} of the king's Small Council. On his way through the throne room, Eddard encounters Jaime Lannister, and <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>is</b> told that Jaime killed the Mad King Aerys Targaryen, the father of Daenerys and Viserys Targaryen. Jaime reminds Eddard that Aerys had murdered Eddard's father and brother; however, Eddard does not consider this grounds for Jaime to break his oath as a knight of the Kingsguard.|$|E
5|$|The Thanhouser {{adaption}} notably foregoes {{the famous}} Shakespearean stage directions: Exit, pursued by a bear. and allows Antigonus a peaceful exit. Another {{difference in the}} production is that following the collapse and reported death of Hermione. In the play, <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>is</b> aligns with Leontes' view and gives {{no reason to doubt}} Hermione's death, but the Thanhouser adaptation shows the mechanism and conspiracy formed by showing Hermione's revival and departure. Instead of using the Shakespeare character of Time to frame the passage of time, the role is performed by an inter-title. The final scene is missing from the surviving print.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>audience</b> <b>is</b> {{seated in}} front of the stage, to {{the left side of the}} stage, and in the corner front-left of stage; these are in order of {{decreasing}} desirability. While the metsuke-bashira pillar obstructs the view of the stage, the actors are primarily at the corners, not the center, and thus the two aisles are located where the views of the two main actors would be obscured, ensuring a generally clear view regardless of seating.|$|E

5|$|The severed ear that Jeffrey discovers {{is also a}} key {{symbolic}} element, leading Jeffrey into danger. Indeed, just as Jeffrey's troubles begin, <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>is</b> {{treated to}} a nightmarish sequence in which the camera zooms into the canal of the severed, decomposing ear. Notably, the camera does not reemerge from the ear canal {{until the end of}} the film. When Jeffrey finally comes through his hellish ordeal unscathed, the ear canal shot is replayed, only in reverse, zooming out through Jeffrey's own ear as he relaxes in his yard on a summer day.|$|E
5|$|Dances can be {{performed}} solo (1, 4); in pairs, (2, 3); in groups, (5, 6, 7); or by massed performers (10). They might be improvised (4, 8) or highly choreographed (1, 2, 5, 10); spontaneous for personal entertainment, (such as when children begin dancing for themselves); a private audience, (4); a paying audience (2); a world audience (10); or an audience interested in a particular dance genre (3, 5). They might {{be a part of}} a celebration, such as a wedding or New Year (6, 8); or a cultural ritual with a specific purpose, such as a dance by warriors like a haka (7). Some dances, such as traditional dance in 1 and ballet in 2, need a very high level of skill and training; others, such as the can-can, require a very high level of energy and physical fitness. Entertaining <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>is</b> a normal part of dance but its physicality often also produces joy for the dancers themselves (9).|$|E
5|$|Finally {{revealed}} to be a ghost story inspired by nineteenth-century French fantasy literature, the film uses the conventions of the genre —that people who die in emotional distress or with an unfinished task may become ghosts— and openly details these conventions. Marie and Adrienne's 'lives' as revenants are reduced to a single purpose, each with only {{the memory of her}} suicide and her last emotions remaining. Julien, like <b>the</b> <b>audience,</b> <b>is</b> eventually confronted with Marie's nightmare of repetition. Elements of the horror genre are used, not to scare but to explore memory and loss. To stay with Marie, Julien first has to forget about her, and at the end they have the promise of a new beginning. Marie becomes a living person again rather than an object of fantasy. Marie's tears and blood are a miracle overcoming her death, and may reflect a fantasy of turning back the menopause. The credits are accompanied by an upbeat jazz song performed by Blossom Dearie, Our Day Will Come, that represents love as a pledge, the only music used in the film.|$|E

5|$|Kiarostami's {{style is}} notable {{for the use}} of long shots, such as in the closing {{sequences}} of Life, and Nothing More... and Through the Olive Trees, where <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>is</b> intentionally distanced physically from the characters to invite reflection on their fate. Taste of Cherry is punctuated throughout by shots of this kind, including distant overhead shots of the suicidal Badii's car moving across the hills, usually while he is in conversation with a passenger. The physical distancing techniques stand in juxtaposition to the dialogue, which always remains in the foreground. Like the coexistence of private and public space, or the frequent framing of landscapes through car windows, this fusion of distance with proximity has been seen as a way of generating suspense in the most mundane of moments.|$|E
5|$|Shaw is {{the only}} {{religious}} believer in the crew and openly displays her religious belief with a necklace of a Christian cross. Lindelof said that with her scientific knowledge, her beliefs felt outdated in 2093. Shaw is excited when she learns that she {{was created by the}} Engineers and not a supernatural deity, but rather than cause her to lose her faith, it reinforces it. Lindelof said that asking questions and searching for meaning is the point of being alive, and so <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>is</b> left to question whether Shaw was protected by God because of her faith. Scott wanted the film to end with Shaw's declaration that she is still searching for definitive answers. In addition to the religious themes, Lindelof said that Prometheus is pro-science and explores whether scientific knowledge and faith in God can co-exist.|$|E

SpongeBob then gets nervous and almost reconsiders applying for {{a job at the}} restaurant until his best friend, a starfish named Patrick Star, convinces him otherwise. Humored with SpongeBob's vulnerability, gullibility, and impenetrable enthusiasm and innocence, both Squidward and the restaurant's proprietor, Mr. Eugene Krabs, decide to manipulate SpongeBob, whom they secretly consider unqualified for the position, by sending him on an impossible errand to purchase a seemingly non-existent high-caliber spatula.|$|E
5|$|The story {{takes place}} in Kolkata. As the credits roll, scenes from {{erstwhile}} Calcutta are displayed along with the narrator's (Amitabh Bachchan) introduction of the era. The narration focuses {{on the night of}} the marriage of Shekhar and Gayatri Tantiya, a rich industrialist's daughter. <b>The</b> <b>audience</b> <b>is</b> introduced to Naveen Roy as Shekhar's father while we see Shekhar grooming himself for the occasion. While he is doing so, images of Lalita calling him by his name flash through his mind. Downstairs, musical celebrations begin as Shekhar meets Vasundhara, a widow from his neighbourhood, who is thankful to her son-in-law, Girish (Sanjay Dutt), for supporting their family after the death of her husband, Gurcharan. Lalita, who is present there, playfully confronts Shekhar as to why he is being indifferent to her. Shekhar admonishes her for speaking so in spite of being married.|$|E
5|$|While {{the song}} is playing, the {{background}} visuals feature the players' chosen avatar, {{along with the rest}} of the band performing in one of several real and fictional venues.

Guitar Hero II added special lighting and other stage effects that were synchronized to the music to provide a more complete concert experience. The games developed by Neversoft feature a simple storyline, usually about a band's quest for fame, which is told through animations played throughout the game. These animations were created by Chris Prynoski and his studio, Titmouse, Inc., who have also done animations for the animated show Metalocalypse.|$|E
