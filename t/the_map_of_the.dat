5|$|Presented in {{traditional}} 2-D animation sprites, the game {{consists of three}} modes to help navigate, <b>the</b> <b>map</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dragon World, the area maps, and the battle mode. The world map will be available from the start, and will allow players easy access {{to each of the}} areas throughout the game. On area maps the player will navigate through various places such fields, forests, caves, and towns on the top screen. The touch screen will display available equipment that can be used while in fields. These items are available courtesy of Capsule Corporation Dyno-Caps which can be bought, given, or found in various spots and or treasure chests. Many of these areas have obstacles such as rocks and brush which the player will have overcome with ki blasts. However, some of these obstacles require stronger levels of ki blasts. The battle screen will take place at the screen with the party facing off with a monster or a boss, their stats and the command select icon presented via the touch screen. The game makes little to no use of the stylus, forcing players to rely on the control pad.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{levels are}} {{available}} in each of eight worlds, which are shown in the Nintendo DS' bottom touchscreen while viewing the world map. <b>The</b> <b>map</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> currently selected world appears in the top screen, {{which is used to}} navigate between the world's levels. The goal of each level is to reach a black flag {{at the end of the}} level. At the end of each world, a boss must be defeated before proceeding to the next world. There are six power-ups available in New Super Mario Bros.; the game allows the player to store an extra power-up when he is already using one, a feature carried over from Super Mario World. Three power-ups from Super Mario Bros. return: the Super Mushroom makes Mario grow in size, the Fire Flower lets Mario throw fireballs, and the Starman makes Mario temporarily invincible. Three more power-ups are introduced in New Super Mario Bros.: the Blue Koopa Shell lets Mario withdraw into a shell to protect himself, the Mega Mushroom grows Mario to an incredible size, and the Mini-Mushroom makes Mario very small.|$|E

5|$|The IND Second System {{proposal}} from 1929 {{estimated that the}} cost of the southern tunnel route from Fort Wadsworth, Staten Island, to Fort Hamilton would cost upward of $75,000,000, though the tunnel was not officially part of the subway plans and was illustrated as a vehicular tunnel on <b>the</b> <b>map</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plans. Many of the proposals were part of this ambitious expansion plan, which would have connected the tunnel to the IND South Brooklyn Line (today's IND Culver Line). An updated proposal in 1931 had the connection to the IND at the current Smith-Ninth Streets station, with the tunnel traveling north from Staten Island through Red Hook and Gowanus. Yet another update, from 1933, was projected to cost $45,000,000, running the original route between Saint George and 67th Street in Bay Ridge. The line would then run on Second Avenue north through the Bay Ridge Flats on Brooklyn's western shore, meeting up with the Culver Line near Hamilton Avenue (the current Gowanus Expressway) between the Smith-Ninth Streets and Fourth Avenue stations; it was suggested that the Hylan tunnel shafts be used. An application for a $47 million loan for this extension was approved by the Board of Estimate in 1937.|$|E

25|$|In mathematics, {{the four}} color theorem, or the four color map theorem, states that, given any {{separation}} {{of a plane}} into contiguous regions, producing a figure called a map, {{no more than four}} colors are required to color the regions of the map so that no two adjacent regions have the same color. Two regions are called adjacent if they share a common boundary that is not a corner, where corners are the points shared by three or more regions.

Bridges simply copied one of Randel's previously published maps, which were in the public domain, without access to the supporting material Randel had accumulated, introducing errors as he did so, some of them possibly intentional, since he was legally bound not to copy the map exactly. Bridges published and copyrighted the resulting map as a private venture, leaving Randel out in the cold: his name did not appear anywhere on Bridges' map.|$|E

25|$|The {{detailed}} analysis of CMBR data to produce maps, an angular power spectrum, and ultimately cosmological parameters is a complicated, computationally difficult problem. Although computing a power spectrum from a map is in principle a simple Fourier transform, decomposing <b>the</b> <b>map</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sky into spherical harmonics, in practice {{it is hard to}} take the effects of noise and foreground sources into account. In particular, these foregrounds are dominated by galactic emissions such as Bremsstrahlung, synchrotron, and dust that emit in the microwave band; in practice, the galaxy has to be removed, resulting in a CMB map that is not a full-sky map. In addition, point sources like galaxies and clusters represent another source of foreground which must be removed so as not to distort the short scale structure of the CMB power spectrum.|$|E
25|$|In September 2005, a {{petition}} was {{submitted to the}} towns of Queensbury and Fort Ann, citing taxes, unfair assessments, and callous indifference from officials of both towns as reasons for village incorporation. <b>The</b> <b>map</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed village was deemed invalid, halting the incorporation process. In 2007, a second petition was submitted but ruled legally insufficient because certain petition signatures were not dated. In March 2009, a third petition was submitted and subsequently rejected because there weren't enough signatures from Fort Ann residents. Additionally, the town supervisors stated {{that a number of}} signatures appeared more than once or were improperly witnessed. It was noted that the petition did meet all of the requirements of the New York State Village Law, however, with respect to Queensbury's section of the proposed village. According to the Village Incorporation Committee spokesperson, a lawsuit was filed against the towns for the supervisors' refusal to approve the petition based on their interpretation of what constitutes a 'resident'.|$|E

After a chapter describing the kingdom of Champa there follows a chapter describing Java (which he did not visit himself). The narrative then resumes, describing the route southward from Champa toward Sumatra, but by a {{slip of the pen}} the name “Java” was substituted for “Champa” as the point of departure, locating Sumatra 1,300 miles to the south of Java instead of Champa. Locach, located between Champa and Sumatra, was likewise misplaced far to the south of Java, by some geographers on or near an extension of the Terra Australis.|$|E

The size of the balloon was originally proposed to be 100ft, but was reduced to 60ft when it was made. The idents {{featured a}} soundtrack of ambient music, with more lively versions being used for more industrial or recreational settings. This made them the first regular BBC One idents to actually use music. The new BBC logo, along with the channel name 'ONE' immediately to the right of it, was overlaid {{at the bottom of the}} screen. The new logo design was an attempt to unify all of the BBC's services and brands under a single logo design, with personality expressed through the idents themselves. The idents were, from October 1998, shown in Widescreen, and the bbc.co.uk URL was added above the logo soon after.|$|E
25|$|In 1860, Aguadilla {{was officially}} {{declared}} a village. Several years later, when {{the island was}} territorially organized into seven departments, Aguadilla became {{the head of the}} third department that included the municipalities of Aguada, Isabela, Lares, Moca, Rincon, and San Sebastián. In January 1841 a Royal Order transferred the judicial party from Aguada to Aguadilla. In 1878, according to Don Manuel Ebeda y Delgado, the territorial organization of Aguadilla had varied a little. At this time Plainela, Higüey, and Mangual wards are not mentioned. The Dos Palmas ward appears as Palmar. Also at this time, three new wards are mentioned: Guerrero, Caimital Alto, and Caimital Bajo. In 1898, even with the change of sovereignty in the island, the territorial organization of Aguadilla is the same to that of 1878. Nevertheless, in the Census of 1899, downtown Aguadilla appears constituted by Higüey, Iglesia, Nueva, Santa Barbara, and Tamarindo wards. Malezas ward appears subdivided into Maleza Alta and Maleza Baja. From that time, the territorial organization of Aguadilla did not change, until 1948, when the Puerto Rico Department of Planning prepared <b>the</b> <b>map</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city and its wards, and following instructions of city authorities, Higüey and parts of Caimital Alto wards are annexed to Downtown Aguadilla.|$|E

The construction of this building was completed on 29 May 1938. B M Srikantaiah was the Vice President of the Parishat from 1938 till 1942. In 1938, the name of Karnataka Sahitya Parishat was changed to Kannada Sahitya Parishat. Under the guidance of B M Srikantaiah, the logo of the Parishat containing <b>the</b> <b>map</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mysore province with the phrase Sirigannadam gelge, Kannada Sahitya Parishat written inside it was created. Over the period of time; a women's wing, a publishing house, a Kannada journal and literature exams were also added to the repertoire of the Parishat. Kannada Sahitya Parishat branches at the district and taluk levels were also created. A new building is being constructed to replace the existing building of the Parishat at a cost of Rupees five crores. During its existence, the Parishat has contributed to the growth of Kannada language by organising conferences and debates, publication and release of books, organising talks by eminent writers and also by holding the annual Kannada Sahitya Sammelana.|$|E
