5|$|The {{plan was}} successful. Many of the Allied officers, {{including}} the Tsar's aides and the Austrian Chief of Staff Franz von Weyrother, strongly supported an immediate attack and appeared <b>to</b> <b>sway</b> Tsar Alexander. Kutuzov's plan to retreat {{further to the}} Carpathian region was rejected, and the Allied forces soon fell into Napoleon's trap.|$|E
5|$|Truthiness is {{the belief}} or {{assertion}} that a particular statement is true based on the intuition or perceptions of some individual or individuals, without regard to evidence, logic, intellectual examination, or facts. Truthiness can range from ignorant assertions of falsehoods to deliberate duplicity or propaganda intended <b>to</b> <b>sway</b> opinions.|$|E

5|$|Acarya Ananda Jha, {{the author}} of the Chinnamasta Tattva, prescribes her worship by {{soldiers}} as she embodies self-control of lust, heroic self-sacrifice for the benefit of others, and fearlessness in the face of death. In a collective prayer to the Mahavidyas in the Shakta Maha-bhagavata Purana, the devotee prays to emulate Chhinnamasta in her generosity to others. Other goals common to worship of all Mahavidyas are: poetic speech, well-being, control of one's foes, removal of obstacles, ability <b>to</b> <b>sway</b> kings, ability to attract others, conquest over other kings, and, finally, moksha (salvation).|$|E
5|$|Claiborne and Haw {{promoted}} Jesus for President {{by going}} on a U.S. speaking tour of 30 cities. The tour {{led up to the}} 2008 United States presidential election, and the book tour was suggestive of a third party candidate campaign for Jesus. The authors' speeches did not attempt <b>to</b> <b>sway</b> their audiences towards or away from any particular candidates, but rather encouraged them to endorse whichever candidates supported Christian values.|$|E
5|$|Madison {{warned the}} Pennsylvania {{congress}} members {{that he would}} attack the bill as unconstitutional in the House, and followed up on his threat. Madison argued his case of where {{the power of a}} bank could be established within the Constitution, but he failed <b>to</b> <b>sway</b> members of the House, and his authority on the constitution was questioned by a few members. The bill eventually passed in an overwhelming fashion 39 to 20, on February 8, 1791.|$|E

5|$|Rhodes' initial {{response}} to the declaration of war was diplomatic; they asked the Roman Republic for help against Philip. The Romans, however, were wary of another war, the Second Punic War having just ended. The Roman Senate attempted to persuade the populace to enter the war, even after Pergamum, Cyzicus and Byzantium had joined the war on the Rhodians side, but was unable <b>to</b> <b>sway</b> the city's war-weary population.|$|E
5|$|The commune {{leadership}} {{planned to}} sicken and incapacitate voters in The Dalles, {{where most of}} the voters resided, <b>to</b> <b>sway</b> the election. Approximately twelve people were involved in the plots to employ biological agents, and at least eleven were involved in the planning process. No more than four appear to have been involved in development at the Rajneeshpuram medical laboratory; not all of those were necessarily aware of the objectives their work served. At least eight individuals were involved with the distribution of the bacteria.|$|E
5|$|The longer 7.5cm {{guns were}} a mixed blessing. In {{spite of the}} designers' efforts to {{conserve}} weight, the new weapon made the vehicle nose-heavy {{to such an extent}} that the forward suspension springs were under constant compression. This resulted in the tank tending <b>to</b> <b>sway</b> even when no steering was being applied, an effect compounded by the introduction of the Ausführung H in March 1943.|$|E

5|$|Although Sestak was {{initially}} urged to {{run by the}} Democratic establishment, Specter gained wide support from Democrats after he switched parties. Major political figures like President Barack Obama and Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell later tried <b>to</b> <b>sway</b> Sestak from continuing the race, fearing he would damage Specter's chances in the general election. Former President Bill Clinton offered Sestak {{a position in the}} Obama administration if he withdrew his candidacy, an offer Republicans would later criticize. Sestak refused to drop out and criticized Specter's party switch as an opportunistic move aimed solely at self-preservation. Nevertheless, Sestak struggled to overcome problems stemming from low name recognition and Specter's support from such individuals as Joe Biden and Harry Reid, and organizations like the AFL-CIO and Pennsylvania Democratic Committee.|$|E
5|$|Behind {{the coup}} were almost {{certainly}} the Byzantines, who had every interest in removing a dangerous enemy and replacing him with somebody, if {{not from a}} pro-Byzantine faction, at least less actively aggressive. Gian Piero Bognetti advances a few hypotheses about Helmichis' motivation for his coup: his reason could have involved a family link to the Lethings, the Lombard royal dynasty that had been dispossessed by Alboin's father Audoin; or {{he may have been}} related through Amalafrid to the Amali, the leading dynasty of the Goths. Helmichis easily obtained the support of the Lombards in Verona, and he probably hoped <b>to</b> <b>sway</b> all the warriors and Lombard dukes to his side by having Alboin's only child, Albsuinda, under his control. He may also have hoped for Byzantine help in buying the dukes' loyalty economically.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Alfonsín {{supported}} a {{faction of the}} UCR that favoured the idea of carrying an independent candidate for the 2007 presidential elections. The UCR, instead of fielding its own candidate, endorsed Roberto Lavagna, a center-left economist {{who presided over the}} dramatic recovery in the Argentine economy from 2002 until he parted ways with President Néstor Kirchner in December 2005. Unable <b>to</b> <b>sway</b> enough disaffected Kirchner supporters, Lavagna garnered third place. Alfonsín was honoured by President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner with a bust of his likeness at the Casa Rosada on October 1, 2008. This was his last public appearance.|$|E

5|$|Plutarch's {{account of}} the revolt {{suggests}} that the slaves simply wished to escape to freedom, and leave Roman territory by way of Cisalpine Gaul. Appian and Florus describe the revolt as a civil war, in which the slaves intended to capture the city of Rome itself. The Third Servile War had significant and far-reaching effects on Rome's broader history. Pompey and Crassus exploited their successes to further their political careers, using their public acclaim and the implied threat of their legions <b>to</b> <b>sway</b> the consular elections of 70 BC in their favor. Their subsequent actions as Consuls greatly furthered the subversion of Roman political institutions {{and contributed to the}} eventual transition of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire.|$|E
5|$|Sterling {{agrees to}} this, {{which results in}} a hectic car chase that frightens Sterling some, despite Burt's expert driving {{that allows him to}} achieve many Hollywood driving stunts. During this, Burt tells Sterling that he needs to stop {{thinking}} of Malory as just his mother and rather think of her as a person with emotional (and sexual) needs and that he should think about her happiness and not his. This seems <b>to</b> <b>sway</b> Sterling and at that point, Burt has been able to catch up to the ISIS agents and the Cubans and saves the ISIS agents. The then group drives back to a heartbroken Malory. Sterling apologizes for writing the phony letter and Burt takes Malory on their date to the movie premiere.|$|E
5|$|Swaying {{behaviour}} is practised by highly cryptic {{animals such as}} {{the leafy}} sea dragon and the stick insect Extatosoma tiaratum. These animals resemble vegetation with their coloration, strikingly disruptive body outlines with leaflike appendages, and the ability <b>to</b> <b>sway</b> effectively like the plants that they mimic. E. tiaratum actively sways back and forth or side to side when disturbed or {{when there is a}} gust of wind, with a frequency distribution like foliage rustling in the wind. This behaviour may represent motion crypsis, preventing detection by predators, or motion masquerade, promoting misclassification (as something other than prey), or a combination of the two, and has accordingly also been described as a form of motion camouflage.|$|E

5|$|The {{build-up}} {{towards a}} war involving Lombards, Gepids, and Byzantines started possibly in 548 or 549, with Audoin and Thurisind each sending an embassy to Justinian's court at Constantinople, {{in attempts to}} obtain military support from Justinian or at least, {{in the case of}} Thurisind, to get a pledge of neutrality. <b>To</b> <b>sway</b> Justinian, Thurisind's envoys reminded him of their long tradition of alliance and promised to fight against Byzantium's enemies. However, the emperor sided with the Lombards; he made them formal allies and promised to provide troops against the Gepids. From Justinian's perspective, this war was of major importance in the larger context of the Gothic War, because possession of Pannonia was strategically necessary to keep open land communications between Italy and the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|After {{students}} {{passed the}} often difficult, bureaucratic, and heavily demanding Imperial Exams, as they became officials, {{they did not}} always {{see eye to eye}} with others that had passed the same examination. Even though they were fully-fledged graduates ready for government service, there was always the factor of competition with other officials. Promotion to a higher post, higher salary, additional honors, and selection for choice assignment responsibilities were often uncertain, as young new officials often needed higher-ranking officials to recommend them for service. Once an official would rise to the upper echelons of central administration based in the capital, they would often compete with others over influence of the emperor's official adoption of state policies. Officials with different opinions on how to approach administrative affairs often sought out other officials for support, leading to pacts of rivaling officials lining up political allies at court <b>to</b> <b>sway</b> the emperor against the faction they disagreed with.|$|E
5|$|After the Khmer Rouge {{regime was}} overthrown, a new Cambodian {{government}} supported by Vietnam, the People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK), was established. The Chinese leader, Deng Xiaoping, {{was unhappy with}} Vietnam's influence over the PRK government. Deng proposed to Sihanouk that he co-operate with the Khmer Rouge to overthrow the PRK government, but rejected it, as he opposed the genocidal policies pursued by the Khmer Rouge {{while they were in}} power. In March 1981 Sihanouk established a resistance movement, FUNCINPEC which was complemented by a small resistance army known as Armée Nationale Sihanoukiste (ANS). He appointed In Tam, who had briefly served as Prime Minister in the Khmer Republic, as the commander-in-chief of ANS. The ANS needed military aid from China, and Deng seized the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>sway</b> Sihanouk into collaborating with the Khmer Rouge. Sihanouk reluctantly agreed, and started talks in March 1981 with the Khmer Rouge and the Son Sann-led Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF) on a unified anti-PRK resistance movement.|$|E
