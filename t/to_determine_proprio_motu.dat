40|$|This Comment {{examines}} the <b>proprio</b> <b>motu</b> {{power of the}} International Criminal Court’s Prosecutor {{through the lens of}} a recent decision to permit the court’s Prosecutor to investigate potential crimes against humanity in the Republic of Kenya. After a deeply contested election in 2007, violence exploded across the country leaving many civilians hurt or dead. The Prosecutor asked the court to permit him to open an investigation, a first in the ICC’s history, where most investigations are initiated through a request from either a State Party or the Security Council. While the use of the <b>proprio</b> <b>motu</b> initiative is deeply controversial, this Comment proposes that this prosecutorial power is essential in achieving the goals of the ICC: to end impunity for crimes against humanity...|$|R

40|$|Magister Legum - LLMKenya’s December 2007 Presidential {{elections}} {{sparked a}} wave of violent clashes over allegations of election rigging. The protests broke out along ethnic lines, causing greater civil unrest. There have been allegations that during these outbreaks of violence crimes against humanity were committed. This violence attracted world-wide concern and was universally condemned. Kenya is loathe to prosecute the perpetrators or those who bear the highest responsibility for the alleged commission of crimes against humanity. It has instead established a national investigatory mechanism, the Kenyan Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission (hereafter TJRC). This approach adopted by Kenya {{has been criticized for}} the fact that it fosters a culture of impunity. However, the Prosecutor of International Criminal Court (hereafter ICC) has used his <b>proprio</b> <b>motu</b> powers to initiate an investigation of alleged commission of crimes that fall within the jurisdiction of the Court. This research paper has analysed the reasons for the <b>proprio</b> <b>motu</b> intervention of the ICC in Kenyan situation. It also examined whether Kenya was unwilling or genuinely unable to prosecute the perpetrators of the post-election violence of 2007. Furthermore, the paper evaluated the provisions of the Kenyan TJRC, the major shortcomings of the Commission and the challenges it is facing in fulfilling its mandate. In conclusion the paper analysed the relationship between TJRC and ICC and re-evaluate any role that the two bodies could play in dispensing justice in Kenya. But before that, the paper laid down the factual background that led to the <b>proprio</b> <b>motu</b> interevention of the ICC in Kenya where a truth commission had alreday been established.
