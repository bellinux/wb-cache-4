40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} causes of the {{positive}} correlation between happiness and <b>the</b> <b>sex</b> gap in happiness between women and men observed in Europe. Departing from a variety of hypotheses that are based on <b>the</b> <b>sex</b> differences at <b>the</b> individual level, this paper tests whether the positive correlation can be explained by <b>the</b> <b>sex</b> difference in life expectancy. The mechanisms working behind are as follows. First, national average happiness affects <b>the</b> <b>sex</b> gap in life expectancy negatively because men are more fragile to stress (unhappiness). Second, <b>the</b> <b>sex</b> difference in life expectancy influences <b>the</b> <b>sex</b> gap in happiness negatively because it affects the chance of being a widow for women. Using a 3 SLS approach, it found that both effects are significant and that the direct effects between happiness and the happiness gap are insignificant. These results indicate that the positive correlation between happiness and the happiness gap is an artifact of the demographic compositional effect resulted from <b>the</b> <b>sex</b> gap in life expectancy.

40|$|Introduction: The {{number of}} {{adolescents}} referred to specialized gender identity clinics for gender dysphoria {{appears to be}} increasing and there {{also appears to be}} a corresponding shift in <b>the</b> <b>sex</b> ratio, from one favoring natal males to one favoring natal females. Aim: We conducted two quantitative studies to ascertain whether there has been a recent inversion of <b>the</b> <b>sex</b> ratio of adolescents referred for gender dysphoria. Methods: <b>The</b> <b>sex</b> ratio of adolescents from two specialized gender identity clinics was examined as a function of two cohort periods (2006 - 2013 vs. prior years). Study 1 was conducted on patients from a clinic in Toronto, and Study 2 was conducted on patients from a clinic in Amsterdam. Results: Across both clinics, the total sample size was 748. In both clinics, there was a significant change in <b>the</b> <b>sex</b> ratio of referred adolescents between the two cohort periods: between 2006 and 2013, <b>the</b> <b>sex</b> ratio favored natal females, but in the prior years, <b>the</b> <b>sex</b> ratio favored natal males. In Study 1 from Toronto, there was no corresponding change in <b>the</b> <b>sex</b> ratio of 6, 592 adolescents referred for other clinical problems. Conclusions: Sociological and sociocultural explanations are offered to account for this recent inversion in <b>the</b> <b>sex</b> ratio of adolescents with gender dysphoria...|$|R

5|$|In 1995, Sampson {{noted that}} earlier studies {{had found that}} the horns and frills of ceratopsians most likely had a {{function}} in intraspecific display and combat, and that these features would therefore have resulted from sexual selection for successful mating. Likewise, in 1997 Horner concluded that such ornamentation was used by males to establish dominance and that females would have preferred well-equipped males as their offspring would then inherit these traits, conferring a reproduction benefit. Dodson thought that in the Centrosaurinae in general the display value of the frill had been reduced compared to the nasal and supraorbital ornamentation. Sampson in 1995 rejected {{the possibility that the}} difference in skull ornamentation between Einiosaurus and Achelousaurus represented sexual dimorphism, for three reasons. Firstly, the extensive Einiosaurus bone beds did not contain any specimens with bosses, as would have been expected if one of <b>the</b> <b>sexes</b> had them. Secondly, Einiosaurus and Achelousaurus are found in strata of a different age. Thirdly, in a situation of sexual dimorphism usually only one of <b>the</b> <b>sexes</b> shows exaggerated secondary sexual characters. Einiosaurus and Achelousaurus however, each have developed a disctinct set of such traits.|$|E
5|$|In most species, <b>the</b> <b>sexes</b> are {{separate}} {{and there is}} little sexual dimorphism, but a few species are hermaphroditic and some parasitic forms show large differences between <b>the</b> <b>sexes.</b> Some Cymothoidans are protandrous hermaphrodites, starting life as males and later changing sex, and some Anthuroideans are the reverse, being protogynous hermaphrodites that are born female. Some Gnathiidans males are sessile and live with a group of females. Males have a pair of penises, which may be fused in some species. The sperm is transferred to the female by the modified second pleopod which receives it from the penis and which is then inserted into a female gonopore. The sperm is stored in a special receptacle, a swelling on the oviduct close to the gonopore. Fertilisation only takes place when the eggs are shed soon after a moult, at which time a connection is established between the semen receptacle and the oviduct.|$|E

50|$|They {{go on to}} {{identify}} three main feminist views {{on the issue of}} prostitution. <b>The</b> <b>sex</b> work perspective, <b>the</b> abolitionist perspective and the outlaw perspective. <b>The</b> <b>sex</b> work perspective maintains that prostitution is a legitimate form of work for women faced with the option of other bad jobs, therefore women ought {{to have the right to}} work in <b>the</b> <b>sex</b> trade free of prosecution or the fear of it. <b>The</b> <b>sex</b> work perspective also argues that governments should eliminate laws that criminalize voluntary prostitution. This, <b>the</b> <b>sex</b> work perspective asserts, will allow prostitution to be regulated by governments and business codes, protect sex trade workers, and improve the ability to prosecute people who hurt them. The Abolitionist perspective holds that governments should work towards the elimination of prostitution. The Outlaw Perspective views work in <b>the</b> <b>sex</b> trade as a “stepping stone to a better career or an expression of sexual freedom”.|$|R

5|$|The gray {{mouse lemur}} is {{considered}} overall sexually monomorphic, but seasonally fluctuating sexual dimorphism {{in terms of}} body mass has been recorded.
