Through a glass door in the column {{you can see the}} driving clock that keeps the telescope turning westward just as fast as the stars go, so that a star remains in view as long as the astronomer wishes to observe it. The telescope turns on two axes {{at the top of the}} column. One axis slants upwards toward the north pole of the heavens; the other at right angles to it, and it is to this one that the tube of the telescope is attached. Two large circles provide graduated scales for locating objects by their coordinates. The instrument can be turned on <b>these</b> <b>axes</b> toward any part of the sky. It is a heavy instrument, but so perfectly balanced that the astronomer moves it easily with one hand.|$|E

Along one axis lie the galleries and along the other axis lie the administrative buildings. Meier emphasized the two competing grids by constructing strong view lines through the campus. The main north-south axis starts with the helipad, then includes a narrow walkway between the auditorium and north buildings, continues past the elevator kiosk to the tram station, through the rotunda, past the walls and support columns of the exhibitions pavilion, and finally the ramp besides the west pavilion and the central garden. Its corresponding east-west visual axis starts with the edge of the scholar's wing of the Getty Research Institute (GRI), the walkway between the central garden and the GRI, the overlook to the azalea pool in the central garden, the walkway between the central garden and the west pavilion, and finally the north wall of the west pavilion and the courtyard between the south and east pavilions.|$|E

The edge wear, coupled with the immense amount of handaxes, many more than necessary, contributes to this idea. However, since Mithen proposed this theory, there has been little to no support for it.|$|E

First, we classified the constructive styles of before-modern architecture into 6 items and one of modem architecture into 7 items on the composition, the materials and the form. 53 scenes (exterior) of all types in the classifications of the constructive styles were evaluated by 20 students with 50 rating scales. The process of verbal expression of the image includes some steps and lead from perception to valuation through sensation. 50 rating scales were selected as all types in that. Image factor analysis was applied the data and yielded 4 main factors, which are interpreted as hard-soft axis, friendly-indefferent axis, gorgeous-simple axis and excellent-inferior axis. 2 axes of hard-soft and friendly-indifferent have much relation to the elements of the materials and the composition, gorgeous-simple axis has much relation to the element of the form, and <b>these</b> 3 <b>axes</b> are leaded from the step of perception to the step of sensation of the image. Excellent-inferior axis values <b>these</b> 3 <b>axes</b> together. As mentioned above, the constructive styles can be interpreted as <b>these</b> 4 <b>axes...</b>|$|R

6000|$|But {{this very}} {{extension}} of the current chronology, if we may rely upon the archaeologists, removes the difficulty by opening up a longer vista. So does the discovery in Europe of remains and implements of prehistoric races of men, to whom the use of metals was unknown--men of the stone age, as the Scandinavian archaeologists designate them. And now, [...] "axes and knives of flint, evidently wrought by human skill, are found in beds of the drift at Amiens (also in other places, both in France and England), associated with the bones of extinct species of animals." [...] These implements, indeed, were noticed twenty years ago; at a place in Suffolk they have been exhumed {{from time to time}} for more than a century; but the full confirmation, the recognition of the age of the deposit in which the implements occur, their abundance, and the appreciation of their bearings upon most interesting questions, belong to the present time. To complete the connection of these primitive people with the fossil ages, the French geologists, we are told, have now [...] "found <b>these</b> <b>axes</b> in Picardy associated with remains of Elephas primigenius, Rhinoceros tichorhinus, Equus fossilis, and an extinct species of Bos."[III-2] In plain language, these workers in flint lived in the time of the mammoth, of a rhinoceros now extinct, and along with horses and cattle unlike any now existing--specifically different, as naturalists say, from those with which man is now associated. Their connection with existing human races may perhaps be traced through the intervening people of the stone age, who were succeeded by the people of the bronze age, and these by workers in iron.[III-3] Now, various evidence carries back the existence of many of the present lower species of animals, and probably of a larger number of plants, to the same drift period. All agree that this was very many thousand years ago. Agassiz tells us that the same species of polyps which are now building coral walls around the present peninsula of Florida actually made that peninsula, and have been building there for many thousand centuries.|$|E
