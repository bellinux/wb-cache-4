5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ear</b> may be {{affected}} by disease, including infection and traumatic damage. Diseases of <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> may lead to hearing loss, tinnitus and balance disorders such as vertigo, although many of these conditions may also {{be affected}} by damage to the brain or neural pathways leading from <b>the</b> <b>ear.</b>|$|E
5|$|The pinna {{consists}} of the curving outer rim called the helix, the inner curved rim called the antihelix, and opens into <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> canal. The tragus protrudes and partially obscures <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> canal, as does the facing antitragus. The hollow region in front of <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> canal is called the concha. <b>The</b> <b>ear</b> canal stretches for about 1inch (2.5cm). The {{first part of the}} canal is surrounded by cartilage, while the second part near the eardrum is surrounded by bone. This bony part is known as the auditory bulla and is formed by the tympanic part of the temporal bone. The skin surrounding <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> canal contains ceruminous and sebaceous glands that produce protective ear wax. <b>The</b> <b>ear</b> canal ends at the external surface of the eardrum.|$|E

50|$|Temporal masking {{should not}} be {{confused}} with <b>the</b> <b>ear's</b> acoustic reflex, an involuntary response in <b>the</b> middle <b>ear</b> that is activated to protect <b>the</b> <b>ear's</b> delicate structures from loud sounds.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>ears</b> {{are less}} {{prominent}} in L. tardigradus tardigradus compared to Loris lydekkerianus. <b>The</b> <b>ears</b> of L. tardigradus nycticeboides are almost invisible.|$|R
5|$|Anomalies and malformations of the pinna are common. These {{anomalies}} include chromosome syndromes such as ring 18. Children {{may also}} present cases of abnormal ear canals and low ear implantation. In rare cases no pinna is formed (atresia), or is extremely small (microtia). Small pinnae can develop when the auricular hillocks do not develop properly. <b>The</b> <b>ear</b> canal can fail to develop {{if it does}} not channelise properly or if there is an obstruction. Reconstructive surgery to treat hearing loss is considered as an option for children older than five, with a cosmetic surgical procedure to reduce the size or change the shape of <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> is called an otoplasty. The initial medical intervention is aimed at assessing the baby's hearing and the condition of <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> canal, as well as the middle and inner ear. Depending on the results of tests, reconstruction of the outer ear is done in stages, with planning for any possible repairs of the rest of <b>the</b> <b>ear.</b>|$|E
5|$|Providing balance, {{when moving}} or stationary, {{is also a}} central {{function}} of <b>the</b> <b>ear.</b> <b>The</b> <b>ear</b> facilitates two types of balance: static balance, which allows a person to feel the effects of gravity, and dynamic balance, which allows a person to sense acceleration.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ear</b> drum {{may become}} {{perforated}} {{in the event}} of a large sound or explosion, when diving or flying (called barotrauma), or by objects inserted into <b>the</b> <b>ear.</b> Another common cause of injury is due to an infection such as otitis media. These may cause a discharge from <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> called otorrhea, and are often investigated by otoscopy and audiometry. Treatment may include watchful waiting, antibiotics and possibly surgery, if the injury is prolonged or the position of the ossicles is affected. Skull fractures that go through the part of the skull containing <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> structures (the temporal bone) can also cause damage to the middle ear. A cholesteatoma is a cyst of squamous skin cells that may develop from birth or secondary to other causes such as chronic ear infections. It may impair hearing or cause dizziness or vertigo, and is usually investigated by otoscopy and may require a CT scan. The treatment for cholesteatoma is surgery.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> {{application}} of <b>ears</b> {{is one of}} the voicing techniques for flue organ pipes. <b>The</b> <b>ears</b> are <b>the</b> projections {{on both sides of the}} pipe mouth and have been used since the Renaissance period. They are frequently used to narrow scaled and low pitched pipes. By the structure around the mouth not only the radiation characteristics of the pipe but also the jet, the source of the pipe sound, will be influenced. Since <b>the</b> <b>ears</b> are attached to the mouth, their effect must be seen both in the sound and the jet. The aim of this research is to find out in details what kind of effect <b>the</b> <b>ears</b> have on <b>the</b> pipe sound and on the jet. According to the opinion of organ builders, the pipe sound will be lower and darker, and the build-up of the sound smoother and faster by attaching <b>the</b> <b>ears.</b> By our measurements, these recognitions were approved. The sound becomes more fundamental and the number of the harmonics is increased by adding <b>the</b> <b>ears.</b> Looking <b>the</b> growth of the harmonics in the attack transient, the attack time tends to be shorter and the attack becomes stable with <b>the</b> <b>ears.</b> In addition <b>the</b> previous investigations indicated an increase in the inharmonicity of the eigenmodes of the resonator due to <b>the</b> <b>ears,</b> and <b>the</b> existence of a proper value for the height of <b>the</b> <b>ears</b> was confirmed...|$|R
5|$|The {{outer ear}} is the {{external}} portion of <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> and includes the fleshy visible pinna (also called the auricle), <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> canal, {{and the outer}} layer of the eardrum (also called the tympanic membrane).|$|E
5|$|After the altercation with Gauguin, Van Gogh {{returned}} to his room, where he was assaulted by voices and severed his left ear with a razor (either wholly or in part; accounts differ), causing severe bleeding. He bandaged the wound, wrapped <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> in paper, and delivered the package to a woman at a brothel Van Gogh and Gauguin both frequented. Van Gogh was found unconscious the next morning by a policeman and taken to hospital, where FÃ©lix Rey, a young doctor still in training, treated him. <b>The</b> <b>ear</b> was delivered to the hospital, but Rey {{did not attempt to}} reattach it as too much time had passed.|$|E
5|$|Cocker Spaniels {{and other}} dogs that have long, {{pendulous}} ears are more predisposed to ear problems {{than some other}} breeds. The fold of <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> can prevent air from entering, and it also creates a warm, moist environment where organisms can grow. Otitis externa is an inflammation of <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> canal which {{can be caused by}} a variety of factors including parasites, microorganisms, foreign bodies, tumors, and underlying dermatological disease. Ear mites can cause otitis externa; ticks and fleas can also live in dogs' ear canals.|$|E

5|$|Jeffrey Beaumont {{returns to}} his logging home town of Lumberton, North Carolina, from Oak Lake College after his father suffers a near-fatal stroke. While walking home from the hospital, he cuts through a vacant lot and discovers a severed ear. Jeffrey takes <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> to police detective John Williams and becomes reacquainted with the detective's daughter, Sandy. She tells him details about <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> case and a {{suspicious}} woman, Dorothy Vallens, who may {{be connected to the}} case. Increasingly curious, Jeffrey enters Dorothy's apartment by posing as an exterminator, and while Dorothy is distracted by a man dressed in a yellow suit at her door (whom Jeffrey later refers to as the Yellow Man), Jeffrey steals her spare key.|$|E
5|$|Temnospondyls {{and other}} early {{tetrapods}} have rounded otic notches {{in the back}} of the skull that project into the cheek region. In life, the otic notch would have been covered by a membrane called the tympanum, which is seen as a disk-like area in living frogs. The tympanum is involved in hearing, and is similar to <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> drum of more advanced tetrapods. It was traditionally thought that the tympanum developed very early in tetrapod evolution as a hearing organ and progressed to form <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> drum of amniotes. Thus, temnospondyls possessed a hearing system supposedly ancestral to that of living amphibians and reptiles.|$|E

5000|$|When {{sound is}} applied to one <b>ear</b> <b>the</b> {{contralateral}} cochlea can also be stimulated to varying degrees, via vibrations through the bone of the skull. When the stimuli presented to <b>the</b> test <b>ear</b> stimulates <b>the</b> cochlea of <b>the</b> non-test <b>ear,</b> {{this is known as}} cross hearing. Whenever it is suspected that cross hearing has occurred it is best to use masking. This is done by temporarily elevating the threshold of <b>the</b> non-test <b>ear,</b> by presenting a masking noise at a predetermined level. This prevents <b>the</b> non-test <b>ear</b> from detecting <b>the</b> test signal presented to <b>the</b> test <b>ear.</b> <b>The</b> threshold of <b>the</b> test <b>ear</b> is measured {{at the same time as}} presenting the masking noise to <b>the</b> non-test <b>ear.</b> Thus, thresholds obtained when masking has been applied, provide an accurate representation of the true hearing threshold level of <b>the</b> test <b>ear.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{elevated}} {{sound levels}} cause trauma to cochlear structure in <b>the</b> inner <b>ear,</b> which {{gives rise to}} irreversible hearing loss. A very loud sound in a particular frequency range can damage the cochlea's hair cells that respond to that range, thereby reducing <b>the</b> <b>ear's</b> ability to hear those frequencies in the future, however, loud noise in any frequency range has deleterious effects across {{the entire range of}} human hearing. <b>The</b> outer <b>ear</b> (visible portion of <b>the</b> human <b>ear)</b> combined with <b>the</b> middle <b>ear</b> amplifies sound levels by a factor of 20 when sound reaches <b>the</b> inner <b>ear.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{face and}} the upper lips are reddish to pink, not dark brown to black as in M.mystacinus. Although most of the face is hairy, {{the area around the}} eyes is bare. The {{nostrils}} are heart-shaped, and their back end is broad, as in M.brandtii, not narrow as in M.mystacinus. Several glands are present on the muzzle, most prominently in reproductively active males. The ears are brown and are lighter on the inside than the outside. There is a notch at the edge of <b>the</b> <b>ear,</b> and the pointed tragus (a projection inside <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> that is present in some bats) extends up to this notch; the tragus is longer, extending beyond the notch, in both M.brandtii and M.mystacinus. The base of the inner side of <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> is white; it is much darker in M.mystacinus. The feet and the thumbs are very small. The small size of <b>the</b> <b>ear,</b> tragus, feet, and thumb distinguishes M.alcathoe from the slightly larger M.mystacinus and M.brandtii, but the feet are relatively larger than in M.mystacinus.|$|E
