30|$|Our data is correlational, so {{we cannot}} {{determine}} the extent <b>to</b> which <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of science identity motivates dropping out of STEM {{and the extent to}} which those who drop out then feel <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of identity. However, among the leavers, women were more likely <b>to</b> report <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of science identity than men, and students of color were more likely <b>to</b> report <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of science identity than white students. No white male (major or leaver) reported <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of science identity; all reports describing <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of science identity were from students in marginalized groups. This relationship indicates that science identity is strongly connected to both race and gender and, given that students of color and women leave STEM at higher rates, it is likely that science identity plays a role in persistence.|$|R

5|$|About an {{hour after}} {{fragment}} K entered Jupiter, observers recorded auroral emission near the impact region, {{as well as at}} the antipode of the impact site with respect to Jupiter's strong magnetic field. The cause of these emissions was difficult to establish due <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of knowledge of Jupiter's internal magnetic field and of the geometry of the impact sites. One possible explanation was that upwardly accelerating shock waves from the impact accelerated charged particles enough to cause auroral emission, a phenomenon more typically associated with fast-moving solar wind particles striking a planetary atmosphere near a magnetic pole.|$|E

Treatment with liothyronine alone has not received enough study to make a recommendation as to its use; due to its shorter half-life it needs to be taken more often.|$|E
