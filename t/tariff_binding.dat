40|$|Proposals {{for special}} {{products}} in the Doha negotiations on agricultural tariffs seek to achieve vitally important goals of food security, livelihood security and rural development. They use an instrument—exceptions to <b>tariff</b> <b>binding</b> reductions on staple foods—that can only have an effect if it allows applied tariff rates on imported goods {{to be higher than}} their level in the absence of this exception, and if this causes prices for producers and/or consumers to be higher than they would otherwise be. A key concern with this approach is that staple foods are frequently important cost items to poor consumers, and the marketable surplus of producers in poor countries is frequently small or negative, resulting in small benefits (or even costs) to poor producers. Results using household data for four poor countries show that—if these flexibilities were used — the impacts of higher-than-otherwise staple food prices on poverty differ substantially by commodity and by country, but that poverty increases would be more frequent, and larger, than poverty reductions. The results highlight the need for caution in using the flexibility provided by this instrument and the need for other measures, such as improvements in technology, rural infrastructure and education, if poverty is to be successfully reduced.

This study also focuses on Spain, whilst developing the literature in two ways. Firstly, a more realistic representation of the agriculture sector is undertaken through modelling improvements to agricultural factor-, input- and product markets. Secondly, the policy scenarios now account for tariff «binding overhangs», thereby better reflecting the true level of market access from a potential agreement, whilst the trade led impacts are examined from the inclusion of «sensitive » product lines within the harmonised tariff formula. Through careful scenario design, protection and support reforms are implemented in three «Doha » experiments to reflect the current negotiations, each with different levels of tariff reductions (i. e., market access). Spain experiences equivalent variation (EV) losses in all scenarios reflecting shallower tariff reductions from the <b>tariff</b> <b>binding</b> overhangs, whilst EV losses are minimised when agro-food market access is increased due to allocative efficiency improvements. The size of the predicted EV losses are «broadly » in line with the literature, although specified modelling changes to the agricultural sectors result in a different set of conclusions with respect to price, output and trade balance trends.

In this private-information setting, we find conditions under which an optimal trade agreement for governments {{takes the form of a}} tariff cap: a tariff function that specifies the maximum permissible tariff and grants the importing government flexibility to apply any tariff at or below the cap. This characterization offers an interpretation of WTO rules, under which member governments negotiate <b>tariff</b> <b>bindings</b> (i. e., caps).

40|$|It {{has been}} argued that {{antidumping}} (AD) facilitates trade liberalization by serving as a release valve for protectionist pressure. We focus on a group of prominent ADusing developing countries and examine the validity of the pressure release hypothesis.

Yet, if pressure exists to reverse liberalization, it is not because products that were subject to AD scrutiny were treated poorly in the liberalization programme. For nearly all major new users products subject to AD investigations do not have unusually low tariffs nor have they experienced unusually large tariff reductions. Our main point is that that AD is not the only policy option.

The proposed special agricultural safeguard expands by arithmetic formula the bounds within which a Member may impose a new import restriction. Analysis reported here suggests that the formulas provide a poor guide for policy, indicating that they would frequently prescribe action that is not needed and fail to prescribe action when it would be appropriate. Analysis of the existing agricultural safeguard, to which the special agricultural safeguard is similar, indicates that it has functioned not as an allowance for occasional response to unusual situations but as an expansion of the limits Members have accepted through <b>tariff</b> <b>bindings.</b> To be useful, the special agricultural safeguard should do more than provide formulas for import restrictions.

40|$|MANY governments {{think they}} could not secure the support of {{domestic}} producer interests for the trade-liberalizing agreements they negotiate with other countries without provisions in them that permit a degree of flexibility in implementing the core obligations they undertake {{in the event of}} unforeseeable or even foreseeable problems. 1 Thus in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) there are "escape clauses" that, as exceptio ns to the rules, allow members to exceed their <b>tariff</b> <b>bindings</b> and impose import restrictions that would otherwise violate GATT articles. 2 The result is a constant tension between the rules drawn to permit limited exceptions to general GATT obligations and constant pressures in member countries of the World Trade Organization (WTO) to expand the escape clauses to provide protection to politically powerful constituencies - often without much regard for the limits within the GATT - in the other direction. General GATT obligations include Articles I, II, II and XI. Politics dictate the pressures that predominate, but, to ensure that protectionist pressures do not gain excessively, the different escape clauses in the WTO must be narrowly defined. They are justified in various ways.

40|$|Although the WTO Agreement {{contained}} many {{provisions for}} 2 ̆ 018 special and differential 2 ̆ 019 treatment, {{it is now}} generally accepted that developing countries have yet received rather few real benefits from the Uruguay Round. The hunt is on {{to find ways to}} better address the needs of these countries in the new Round; some suggest the credibility and viability of the WTO itself is at stake. Several suggestions already exist about what further might be done. This paper proposes an additional step which might be taken in the agricultural field. Developing and transitional country governments have a need to protect their farmers (and, often, consumers) against external shocks, particular arising from world market price swings. Typically lacking fiscal resources, their only feasible approach to do this may be through the use of border measures to moderate price transmission to the domestic market. With non-tariff barriers and export subsidies now effectively removed from the choice set for most, what remains are variable tariffs, variable import subsidies and variable export taxes (and, to a limited extent, controls on export quantities). Many developing countries emerged from the Uruguay Round with bound tariffs quite high relative to applied tariffs. This gives them considerable 2 ̆ 018 room 2 ̆ 019 to vary the applied tariff as a domestic price stabilising measure. Some have formal policies in place to do so systematically. Others have done it on a more ad hoc basis. However, questions have been raised about the WTO-legality of such practices because the Agreement on Agriculture explicitly bans some types of variable tariffs (2 ̆ 018 variable import levies 2 ̆ 019 and 2 ̆ 018 minimum import prices 2 ̆ 019). The reality is that such 2 ̆ 018 banned 2 ̆ 019 schemes are still in operation in the EU and Japan, and some other existing forms of variable tariffs (e. g., 2 ̆ 018 seasonal 2 ̆ 019 tariffs) have not been challenged, and appear to be widely acceptable. It is concluded that clarification is needed about which types of variable tariff practices are to be allowed and which are not. Rather than opposing developing countries 2 ̆ 019 use of 2 ̆ 018 sliding scale 2 ̆ 019 tariff schemes and lamenting their high levels of <b>tariff</b> <b>bindings,</b> the OECD group could recognise these countries needs, not exaggerate the costs to themselves, and endorse the practice of varying the applied tariff as a stabilising measure for importcompeting agricultural producers and for consumers of the same commodities. As a 2 ̆ 018 special and differential 2 ̆ 019 concession, developing and transition countries could be allowed to retain <b>tariff</b> <b>bindings</b> at a level high enough to provide a capacity for using variable tariffs as a safety net measure. Conditions and incentives could be attached to ensure transparency, predictability, and a principally stabilising (not permanently protective) tariff use. Any new disciplines on export taxes or controls should take into consideration the logical linkage and be made consistent with such a concession...|$|R
40|$|The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) is a {{coordination}} compact. <b>Tariff</b> <b>bindings</b> {{illustrate a}} mechanism for making commitments credible. Reciprocity illustrates a means for redistributing cooperative gains. The Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) principle illustrates an attempt to keep coordination "virtuous" (cooperative) rather than "vicious" (collusive). Yet international trade policy coordination has clearly become more difficult. The postwar hegemonic environment {{has evolved into a}} more general strategic environment with several influential governments and blocs. Such coalitions are a natural evolutionary development, yet one that inexorably undermines MFN. Economic developments make a country's comparative advantage increasingly sensitive to sectoral predation by others, especially through subsidies and performance requirements aimed at mobile multinational firms, which are themselves internationally coordinated. Immobile workers and others correspondingly bear the burdens of sharper adjustments, and look to government to turn its trade policy narrowly inward in order to ease their load. Such "domestication" of trade policy is the antithesis of international coordination, and runs the risk of creating a strategic paralysis of recurring unproductivity. What changes might restore the liberalizing impetus of trade policy coordination? Several are considered in the paper. One is extension of the "Codes" approach to multilateral negotiations under the GATT, especially to Subsidies and Safeguards. Many reflections in the paper are framed in categories from recent economic thinking about policy coordination in "strategic" environments [...] those with small numbers of self-consciously interdependent agents. The paper argues that these are the appropriate environments in which to analyze international coordination of trade policy. ...|$|R
40|$|In the Uruguay Round negotiations, trade {{distorting}} agricultural {{policies were}} taken up substantively {{for the first}} time in any round of multi-lateral trade negotiations. Voluntary export restraints outside the Multifibre Arrangement (MFA) were in fact eliminated. Developing countries became equal partners with developed countries. Their tariff cuts covered as large a share of imports as those of the developed countries and were deeper. Because developing country tariffs were higher to start with, their cuts will save importers more (perdollar of imports covered) than will cuts by developed countries. <b>Tariff</b> <b>bindings</b> for most developing countries, although often above applied rates, were extended to 90 percent or more of imports. Few countries agreed to give foreigners unlimited market access in services, or full national treatment in more than a few service activities. But developed countries agreed to some liberalization of cross-border provision for 70 percent of service activities (compared with 25 percent in developing countries). Less positively, although trade restrictions on agricultural products were converted to tariffs, border protection was reduced less on agricultural than on industrial products, and there was little agreement on reducing trade-affecting subsidies. The textiles and clothing agreement binds developed countries to eliminate all MFA-sanctioned restriction but allows them to largely put off doing so until 2005. Concessions to which developing countries agreed are due now. Reciprocal concessions of particular interest are due in the future (elimination of the MFA) or yet to be negotiated (liberalization of agricultural trade).

In a dynamic, heterogeneous firms model, trade policy uncertainty will delay the entry of exporters into new markets and make them less responsive to applied tariff reductions. Policy instruments that reduce or eliminate uncertainty, such as binding trade policy commitments at the WTO, increase entry. The predictions are tested on disaggregated, product-level Australian imports with model-consistent measures of uncertainty. The estimates show that growth of exporter-product varieties would have been 7 % lower between 1993 and 2001 without the binding commitments implemented after the WTO was formed in 1996.

40|$|Chapter 2, titled "Hotelling Tax Competition" {{shows how}} {{competition}} among governments for mobile firms {{can bring about}} excessive differentiation in levels of taxation and public good provision. Hotelling's Principle of Minimum Differentiation is applied {{in the context of}} tax competition and shown to be invalid. Instead, when an equilibrium exists, differentiation of public good provision is maximized. Non-existence of equilibrium, which is possible, is a metaphor for intense tax competition. The chapter also shows that, to some extent, perfect tax discrimination presents a solution to the existence problem created by Hotelling tax competition, but that the efficiency problem of Hotelling tax competition is exacerbated. Chapter 3 shows how the institutional rules imposed on its signatories by the GATT created a strategic incentive for countries to liberalize gradually. Ree trade can never be achieved when punishment for deviation from a trade agreement is limited to a 'withdrawal of equivalent concessions', the most severe form of punishment allowed (Article XXVIII). Retaliation is not allowed to entail higher tariffs than those set by the initial deviant. If, in addition, <b>tariff</b> <b>bindings</b> (Article 11) limit an initial deviation from an agreement in a similar way, then efficient self-enforcing tariff reductions must proceed in a series of steps or 'rounds'. Chapter 4 provides an answer to the question "Why are trade agreements regional? " It argues that free trade agreements (FTAs) are regional because, in their absence, optimal tariffs are higher against (close) regional partners than (distant) countries outside the region. Optimal tariffs shift rents from foreign firms to domestic citizens. Lower transport costs imply higher rents and therefore higher tariffs. So regional FTAs have a higher payoff than non-regional FTAs. Therefore, only regional FTAs may yield positive gains when sponsoring an FTA is costly. To analyze equilibrium, standard theory of non-cooperative networks is extended to allow for asymmetric players. Naive best response dynamics show that 'trade blocks can be stepping blocks' for free trade. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceUniversity of Warwick.
