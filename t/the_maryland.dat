5|$|The {{origins of}} <b>the</b> <b>Maryland</b> Senate {{lie in the}} {{creation}} of an assembly during the early days of <b>the</b> <b>Maryland</b> colony. This assembly first met in 1637, making it the longest continuously operating legislative body in the United States. Originally, the assembly was unicameral, but in 1650, the Governor and his appointed council began serving as the upper house of a now bicameral legislature. These appointees had close political and economic ties to the proprietors of <b>the</b> <b>Maryland</b> colony, Cecilius Calvert and his descendants. Thus, the upper house in colonial times often disagreed with the lower house, which was elected, tended to be more populist, and pushed for greater legislative power in the colony.|$|E
5|$|When <b>the</b> <b>Maryland</b> & Virginia {{collapsed}} in late 1839, <b>the</b> <b>Maryland</b> legislature convened to grant a charter to the Baltimore Steam Packet Company, organized in Baltimore to provide overnight steamship {{service on the}} Chesapeake Bay.

McKim, Samuel McDonald, Gen. William McDonald, Robert A. Taylor, and Joel Vickers, all of Baltimore.|$|E
