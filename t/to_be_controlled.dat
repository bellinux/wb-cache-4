5|$|After leaving Apogee, Jackson {{entered into}} {{a joint venture with}} Clair Brothers to design a digital {{loudspeaker}} controller for control of complex concert sound systems. Jackson estimated that the project would cost $800,000 in U.S. dollars, but it ended up costing Clair Brothers more than $2M. From the same garage in which he started Apogee, Jackson developed the proprietary Clair iO: a two-input, six-output digital audio matrix with opto-isolated output circuits. An essential element of the system was its ability <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>controlled</b> by wireless tablet computer by an audio engineer walking around to various seating sections in a concert venue, to tailor the system's response more precisely.|$|E
5|$|During normal {{passenger}} {{operation on}} revenue tracks, trains are designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>controlled</b> by an integrated Automatic Train Operation (ATO) and Automatic Train Control (ATC) system that accelerates and brakes trains automatically without operator intervention. All trains are still manned with train operators who {{open and close}} the doors, make station announcements, and supervise their trains. The system was designed so that an operator could manually operate a train when necessary.|$|E

5|$|Miles {{subsequently}} {{supported the}} Empress, and in 1146, Ranulf, the Earl of Chester and temporarily {{on the side}} of the king, attacked and took the town of Bedford, but was unable to take the castle, which continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>controlled</b> by Miles until his death several years later. Towards the end of the war, Bedford Castle may have been attacked again; Henry II, during the final year of the conflict in 1153, marched through Bedford and documentary evidence shows damage to the town at this time. Historians are divided as to whether the castle was besieged at the same time.|$|E

5|$|The same {{development}} {{team that}} worked on Four Swords Adventures also worked {{on what would}} become Phantom Hourglass. In the game's first prototype, the action {{took place in the}} upper screen while the touchscreen was a flat map that allowed Link <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>controlled.</b> However, the developers believed that this interface caused the player to be too disconnected from the game's action, thereby prompting them to switch the two screens. They felt that this interface would appeal to Japanese players, who they said prefer simple interfaces. The developers added a battle mode that was played over Wi-Fi to appeal to American players.|$|E
5|$|A bowl {{of living}} larvae is {{served at the}} meal, to Picard's disgust. He {{attempts}} to leave, only to find Riker blocking his way. The commander appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>controlled</b> by the parasite Quinn brought to the Enterprise. When the others see a prosthetic protrusion {{on the back of}} Riker's neck, he is accepted as one of them and allowed to dine. They reveal that the parasites are seeking to take over Starfleet, using humanoids as hosts. When he is about to put a handful of the larvae in his mouth, Riker suddenly produces a phaser and fires on one of the Admirals. Picard picks up a fallen weapon and the two Enterprise officers subdue the infected, causing parasites to leave the hosts and flee. One of the parasites scurries under a closed door and Picard and Riker follow it. They find Remmick ingesting the parasite to join several others inside him. Picard and Riker fire upon Remmick, destroying his body but freeing a giant parasite; the two continue to fire until it is destroyed.|$|E
5|$|During {{the days}} leading up to the {{scheduled}} start of practice at 3pm, Thursday, July 2, 1998, concerns rose on account of the massive wildfire outbreak that was underway in central Florida; thousands of people were forced to evacuate the area, and Interstate 95, the primary north–south thoroughfare through the region, was closed. At 10am on July 2, NASCAR announced that the race was being postponed; while July 25 was an open date, the decision was made to reschedule the race for October 17, to allow additional time for the wildfires <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>controlled.</b> At the time of the postponement, the race was sold out; this was the first time the summer race at Daytona International Speedway had achieved sellout status.|$|E

5|$|For all {{the claims}} about the {{potential}} for violence, election day, November 7, remained mostly calm across the state. Fewer than a dozen people were arrested statewide. Voting returns were slow, and on election night, the race was still too close to call. When the official tally was announced, Taylor had won by a vote of 193,714 to 191,331. Former governor John Y. Brown, nominated by a dissident group of Democrats, had garnered 12,040 votes, and Populist candidate John G. Blair had captured 2,936. Though the Board of Elections was thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>controlled</b> by Goebel, it rendered a surprise 2–1 decision to certify the election results. The board's majority opinion claimed {{that they did not have}} any judicial power and were thus unable to hear proof or swear witnesses, leaving them without grounds to invalidate any votes. Taylor was inaugurated on December 12, 1899.|$|E
5|$|In giving {{attention}} to national affairs, McKinley neglected his home front in Ohio, {{and when the}} Republican state convention met in Zanesville in May 1895, it proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>controlled</b> by the resurgent Foraker, who sought the Senate seat to be filled by the Ohio General Assembly in January 1896. That convention endorsed McKinley for president and Foraker for Senate, and nominated Foraker supporters for state and party offices, including Asa Bushnell to succeed McKinley as governor. McKinley realized {{that it would be}} risky to have a faction hostile to the presidential candidate within his home state, and sought an alliance, campaigning for Bushnell and for a Republican legislature that would send Foraker to Washington. The voters chose Bushnell and gave the state Republicans a large majority in the legislature. In January 1896, Foraker was overwhelmingly elected (to take office in March 1897), and McKinley gained Foraker's agreement to support him for president, assuring party political peace at home.|$|E

The following day, Spanish commander Antonio Zuazola, who was known for having mutilated hundreds of prisoners in the east of the country, was imprisoned. Simón Bolívar, leader of the patriots, offered Domingo de Monteverde, leader of the royalists, the exchange of Zuazola with Domingo Jalón. After the proposal was rejected by the royalists, Bolívar ordered the death of Zuazola, who was hanged from a flagpole outside the walls of the fort.|$|E

5|$|Sometimes, {{a single}} rank of pipes {{may be able}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>controlled</b> by several stops, {{allowing}} the rank to be played at multiple pitches or on multiple manuals. Such a rank {{is said to be}} unified or borrowed. For example, an 8 Diapason rank may also be made available as a 4 Octave. When both of these stops are selected and a key (for example, c) is pressed, two pipes of the same rank will sound: the pipe normally corresponding to the key played (c), and the pipe one octave above that (c). Because the 8 rank does not have enough pipes to sound the top octave of the keyboard at 4 pitch, it is common for an extra octave of pipes used only for the borrowed 4 stop to be added. In this case, the full rank of pipes (now an extended rank) is one octave longer than the keyboard.|$|E
5|$|The RAAF's {{area command}} {{structure}} was revised in 1942, following {{the outbreak of}} the Pacific War: Northern Area was split into North-Eastern Area and North-Western Area, and a new command covering New South Wales and southern Queensland, Eastern Area, was created, making a total of five commands. In October 1943, the Air Board proposed carving a new Central Area Command out of Eastern Area, which by then was considered too large <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>controlled</b> by one headquarters and therefore ripe for subdivision. This Central Area Command would have been responsible for training and operational units in southern Queensland. The War Cabinet deferred its decision on the proposal. The concept was raised again in August 1944, and this time the new Central Area Command was to control maintenance units, as well as training and operations, in southern Queensland. Once again, nothing came of the proposal.|$|E
5|$|The United States Clean Air Act, {{passed in}} 1990, put mercury {{on a list}} of toxic {{pollutants}} that need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>controlled</b> to the greatest possible extent. Thus, industries that release high concentrations of mercury into the environment agreed to install maximum achievable control technologies (MACT). In March 2005, the EPA promulgated a regulation that added power plants to the list of sources that should be controlled and instituted a national cap and trade system. States were given until November 2006 to impose stricter controls, but after a legal challenge from several states, the regulations were struck down by a federal appeals court on 8 February 2008. The rule was deemed not sufficient to protect the health of persons living near coal-fired power plants, given the negative effects documented in the EPA Study Report to Congress of 1998. However newer data published in 2015 showed that after introduction of the stricter controls mercury declined sharply, indicating that the Clean Air Act had its intended impact.|$|E
