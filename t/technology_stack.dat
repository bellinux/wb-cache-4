2500|$|Author Phillip Evans said in 2013 that {{networks}} are challenging traditional hierarchies. Value chains {{may also be}} breaking up ("deconstructing") where information aspects can be separated from functional activity. Data that is readily available for free or very low cost {{makes it harder for}} information-based, vertically integrated businesses to remain intact. Evans said: [...] "The basic story here is that what used to be vertically integrated, oligopolistic competition among essentially similar kinds of competitors is evolving, by one means or another, from a vertical structure to a horizontal one. Why is that happening? It's happening because transaction costs are plummeting and because scale is polarizing. The plummeting of transaction costs weakens the glue that holds value chains together, and allows them to separate." [...] He used Wikipedia {{as an example of a}} network that has challenged the traditional encyclopedia business model. Evans predicts the emergence of a new form of industrial organization called a [...] "stack", analogous to a <b>technology</b> <b>stack,</b> in which competitors rely on a common platform of inputs (services or information), essentially layering the remaining competing parts of their value chains on top of this common platform.|$|E

50|$|Che {{itself is}} a {{workspace}} server running on an application server. Che provides an integrated IDE {{which can be used}} via a browser. After the initial load the IDE provides a dynamic user interface including known components like wizards, editors, toolbars and many more. The user has the opportunity to create workspaces, projects, environments, machines and many other modules that are needed to build a project from scratch. The communication between the user interface and the server is done using RESTful APIs that interact with the so-called Workspace Master. One workspace may include zero or more projects and must at least include one environment, which itself contains at least one machine. A machine is a runtime that has the necessary software installed. If the user adds for example a project which uses Apache Maven the Workspace Master installs Maven on any machine in the workspace to ensure the project can be executed on each machine. Che comes with some predefined <b>technology</b> <b>stacks</b> to quickly set up a new machine. To ensure high flexibility and extensibility the user may also define custom <b>technology</b> <b>stacks</b> which can be used to set up new machines.|$|R

In this paper, we propose a novel process for bottom-up develop-ment of domain-specific IDEs based on agile principles. It aims to en-able a fine-grained co-evolution of domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs) and their model editors and code generators. We illustrate our approach by iteratively developing an IDE for model-driven development of mobile applications. As a key success factor for continuous DSML de-velopment, we determine the automated deduction of migration scripts for all dependent artifacts of a DSML evolution step. ...|$|R

40|$|The formation, {{evolution}} {{and management of}} groups within modern social networks pose significant challenges and opportunities. Challenges arise {{from a combination of}} ubiquitous connectivity coupled with innovative and inexpensive cloud infrastructure, yielding new usage patterns which push existing service architectures, management infrastructure and <b>technology</b> <b>stacks</b> to their limits. Opportunities for remedying this situation arise from re-thinking the formation and management of social media groups and introducing innovative models, notations, algorithms and implementation strategies. To this end, this work analyses emerging group formation and interaction patterns, applies new approaches to current prominent protocols and evaluates resultant behavior and performance characteristics. This analysis is applied to more sophisticated usage patterns; models, notations and algorithms are devised to exibly support emerging scenarios, and specific implementations are discussed and analysed. Applying Policy Based Network Management principles to manage the formation of, and interaction within, groups is demonstrated to be viable, particularly if coupled with emerging <b>technology</b> <b>stacks.</b> An innovative architecture model is evolved, which can exibly match the performance and scalability requirements likely to emerge in next generation social network platforms. In addition, an approach to policy language development is proposed and demonstrated, capitalising on recent innovations in scripting language design and implementation. This is shown to deliver a considerably simplified, more exible and more expressive alternative to current policy languages, and offers significant scope for further research and innovation...|$|R
