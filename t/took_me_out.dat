2500|$|In 1965 Alice Wainwright, who was {{the first}} woman to serve on the Miami City Commission, decided to not seek re-election. Athalie Range became a {{candidate}} for the vacant seat, the first African-American to run for the City Commission. She won a plurality in the primary election, although not a majority. In the runoff election, Range's opponent, a white man named Irwin Christie, sent a sound truck through white neighborhoods the day before the election broadcasting the message that if the white people did not get out and vote, they would have a black woman making laws for them. Athalie Range would later say, [...] "His campaign decided to play the race card, which <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> of contention." [...] Many black voters had been allowed to take time off from work to vote in the primary, but were not allowed to do so for the runoff. Range lost the runoff, receiving about 17,000 votes, while Christie received about 18,000. Christie later apologized to Range for the way he had run his campaign, and she accepted the apology.Dunn.
