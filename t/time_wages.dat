25|$|In 1832, the Reform Act {{extended}} {{the vote in}} Britain but did not grant universal suffrage. That year six men from Tolpuddle in Dorset founded the Friendly Society of Agricultural Labourers to protest against the gradual lowering of wages in the 1830s. They refused to work for less than ten shillings a week, although by this <b>time</b> <b>wages</b> {{had been reduced to}} seven shillings a week and were due to be further reduced to six. In 1834 James Frampton, a local landowner, wrote to the Prime Minister, Lord Melbourne, to complain about the union, invoking an obscure law from 1797 prohibiting people from swearing oaths to each other, which the members of the Friendly Society had done. James Brine, James Hammett, George Loveless, George's brother James Loveless, George's brother in-law Thomas Standfield, and Thomas's son John Standfield were arrested, found guilty, and transported to Australia. They became known as the Tolpuddle Martyrs. In the 1830s and 1840s, the Chartist movement was the first large-scale organised working class political movement which campaigned for political equality and social justice. Its Charter of reforms received over three million signatures but was rejected by Parliament without consideration.|$|E

60|$|For a long <b>time</b> <b>wages</b> {{had been}} {{two hundred and fifty}} dollars a month; but curiously enough, as steamboats multiplied and {{business}} increased, the wages began to fall little by little. It was easy to discover the reason of this. Too many pilots were being 'made.' It was nice to have a 'cub,' a steersman, to do all the hard work for a couple of years, gratis, while his master sat on a high bench and smoked; all pilots and captains had sons or nephews who wanted to be pilots. By and by it came to pass that nearly every pilot on the river had a steersman. When a steersman had made an amount of progress that was satisfactory to any two pilots in the trade, they could get a pilot's license for him by signing an application directed to the United States Inspector. Nothing further was needed; usually no questions were asked, no proofs of capacity required.|$|E
6000|$|To {{return to}} the argument. Let us {{consider}} next what wages the monopolist in the cases described above will have to pay. We take for granted that he will only {{pay as much as}} he has to. How much will this be? Clearly enough it will depend altogether on the number of available working men capable of doing the work in question and the situation in which they find themselves. It is again a case of relative [...] "economic strength." [...] The situation may be altogether in favor of the employer or altogether in favor of the men, or may occupy a middle ground. If the men are so numerous that there are more of them than are needed for the work, and if there is no other occupation for them they must accept a starvation wage. If they are so few in number that they can all be employed, and if they are so well organized as to act together, they can in their turn exact any wage up to the point that leaves no profit for the employer himself at all. Indeed for a short <b>time</b> <b>wages</b> might even pass this point, the monopolist employer being willing (for various reasons, all quite obvious) actually to pay more as wages than he gets as return and to carry on business at a loss for the sake of carrying it on at all. Clearly, then, wages, as Adam Smith said, [...] "are the result of a dispute" [...] in which either party must be pushed to the wall. The employer may have to pay so much that there is nothing or practically nothing left for himself, or so little that his workmen can just exist and no more. These are the upward and downward limits of the wages in the cases described.|$|E
6000|$|Against {{this comes}} the protest of the Sunday School theorists [...] "Why not {{distribute}} according to merit?" [...] Here one imagines Jesus, whose smile has been broadening down the ages as attempt after {{attempt to escape}} from his teaching has led to deeper and deeper disaster, laughing outright. Was ever so idiotic a project mooted as the estimation of virtue in money? The London School of Economics is, we must suppose, to set examination papers with such questions as, [...] "Taking the money value of the virtues of Jesus as 100, and of Judas Iscariot as zero, give the correct figures for, respectively, Pontius Pilate, the proprietor of the Gadarene swine, the widow who put her mite in the poor-box, Mr. Horatio Bottomley, Shakespear, Mr. Jack Johnson, Sir Isaac Newton, Palestrina, Offenbach, Sir Thomas Lipton, Mr. Paul Cinquevalli, your family doctor, Florence Nightingale, Mrs. Siddons, your charwoman, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the common hangman." [...] Or [...] "The late Mr. Barney Barnato received as his lawful income three thousand times {{as much money as}} an English agricultural laborer of good general character. Name the principal virtues in which Mr. Barnato exceeded the laborer three thousandfold; and give in figures the loss sustained by civilization when Mr. Barnato was driven to despair and suicide by the reduction of his multiple to one thousand." [...] The Sunday School idea, with its principle [...] "to each the income he deserves" [...] is really too silly for discussion. Hamlet disposed of it three hundred years ago. [...] "Use every man after his deserts, and who shall scape whipping?" [...] Jesus remains unshaken as the practical man; and we stand exposed as the fools, the blunderers, the unpractical visionaries. The moment you try to reduce the Sunday School idea to figures you find that it brings you back to the hopeless plan of paying for a man's time; and your examination paper will read [...] "The time of Jesus was worth nothing (he complained that the foxes had holes and the birds of the air nests whilst he had not a place to lay his head). Dr. Crippen's time was worth, say, three hundred and fifty pounds a year. Criticize this arrangement; and, if you dispute its justice, state in pounds, dollars, francs and marks, what their relative <b>time</b> <b>wages</b> ought to have been."

40|$|In this study, Swedish stated {{preference}} data is used {{to derive}} estimated values of commuting time (VOCT). Both spouses in two-earner households are individually making trade-offs between commuting time and wage; both {{with regard to their}} own commuting <b>time</b> and <b>wage</b> only, as well as when both their own commuting <b>time</b> and <b>wage</b> and their spouse's commuting <b>time</b> and <b>wage</b> are simultaneously changed. Thus, we are able to compare how male spouses and female spouses value each other's commuting time. When only ones own commuting <b>time</b> and <b>wage</b> are attributes, the empirical results show that the estimated VOCT is plausible with a tendency towards high values compared to other studies, and that VOCT does not differ significantly between men and women. When decisions affecting commuting <b>time</b> and <b>wage</b> of both spouses are analyzed, both spouses tend to value the commuting time of the wife highest. For policy implications, this study provides additional support for the practice of valuing commuting time higher than other private travel time. In addition, if VOCT were to be gender specific, the value might be higher for women than for men in two-earner households.

40|$|The Coalition is {{committed}} to helping Australian families to get ahead. Middle income Australians are bearing a growing tax burden. Without action, the average full <b>time</b> <b>wage</b> earner would face the second highest marginal tax rate this year and {{nearly half of all}} taxpayers would be in the top two brackets in ten years’ time. The Turnbull Government is giving hard working Australians greater incentive to earn more without being taxed more.

5000|$|The 5th Duke of Portland {{undertook}} {{the most}} substantial building works at Welbeck. The kitchen gardens covered 22 acre and {{were surrounded by}} high walls with recesses in which braziers could be placed to hasten the ripening of fruit. One of the walls, a peach wall, measured over 1000 ft in length. An immense riding house was built which was 396' long, 108' wide and 50' high,'At {{the time it was}} the second largest riding house in the world, exceeded only by the huge Manege adjacent to the Kremlin in Moscow'. Nearby was a tan gallops of 422 yd. It was lit by 4,000 gas jets and was heated to enable training at night and in winter. The 'Tan Gallops' is named after the spongy oak chips that covered its floor. They were a by-product from leather tanning and a good surface for the horses to run on. A tunnel, more than one thousand yards in length, led from the house to the riding school. It was wide enough for several people to walk side by side. Parallel to it was another, more roughly constructed and used by workmen. A longer, more elaborate tunnel, one and a half miles long, intended as a carriage drive broad enough for two carriages to pass, led towards Worksop. This tunnel was abandoned in the late 19th century when a section forming part of the lake dam failed. Remaining stretches of tunnel survive {{on either side of the}} lake. The tunnel's skylights can be seen from the Robin Hood Way footpath which follows its course and a masonry entrance can be seen between two lodges at the northeastern limit of the park. The 5th Duke excavated to create a number of extensions to the mansion. Although cited as being [...] "underground rooms", these apartments are strictly [...] "below ground", as they are not covered by earth or lawn; their flat roofs and skylights are visible in aerial photographs, although at ground level they are concealed from most directions by shrubbery. The largest is a great hall, 160 ft long and 63 ft wide intended as a chapel but used as a picture gallery and occasionally as a ballroom. There is a suite of five adjacent rooms constructed to house the duke's library. [...] The duke made many alterations to the house above ground. Elaborate bathrooms were added. New lodges were built at the park entrances. The work cost prodigious sums and employed thousands of men - masons, bricklayers, joiners, plumbers. While there were disputes from time to <b>time</b> (<b>wages,</b> hours) the duke got on well with his employees and earned the nickname 'the workman's friend'. He created employment for skilled and unskilled workers.|$|E
40|$|Efficiency wage {{considerations}} {{should be}} less important for piece-rate pay than for <b>time</b> <b>wages.</b> Therefore, if industry wage differentials reflect efficiency wage factors, then these pay differences {{should be less}} sizable and have less explanatory power for piecework than for timework. We test this proposition using wage data for male production workers employed in the Swedish metalworking industries in 1985. The data are partitioned into two groups of workers. In our preferred sub-sample of workers who received pay under both piece rates and <b>time</b> <b>wages,</b> our results are uniformly consistent with efficiency wage implications for industry wage differentials. For the subsample of workers who received pay under either piece rates or <b>time</b> <b>wages,</b> industry wage differentials are of equal importance under either pay scheme.
