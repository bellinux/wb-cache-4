5000|$|Europeans and Americans did {{not have}} {{sustained}} encounters with the Alaska Natives until {{the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth centuries, when many were attracted to the region in gold rushes. The Alaska Natives were not allotted individual title <b>in</b> <b>severalty</b> to land under the Dawes Act of 1887 but were instead treated under the Alaska Native Allotment Act of 1906.|$|R
50|$|A {{usufruct}} {{is either}} granted <b>in</b> <b>severalty</b> or held <b>in</b> common ownership, {{as long as}} the property is not damaged or destroyed. The third civilian property interest is abusus (literally abuse), the right to alienate the thing possessed, either by consuming or destroying it (e.g. for profit), or by transferring it to someone else (e.g. sale, exchange, gift). Someone enjoying all three rights has full ownership.|$|R
50|$|In the {{interest}} of encouraging trade, movable property could not be mortgaged and was not considered separate property (biens propres), that is, property <b>in</b> <b>severalty</b> external to the marital community unless specified in the marriage contract. Immovables such as land, offices, and rentcharges (rentes constituées) were considered separate property if acquired {{by one of the}} spouses prior to the marriage or inherited directly by either spouse.|$|R
50|$|Elizabeth Zane and Andrew Conley {{married in}} 1860 at Logan County, Ohio. They raised their daughters on a 64 acre-farm in present-day Wyandotte County. Elizabeth had {{received}} the land at age 17 in 1855, when Wyandot tribal land was allocated <b>in</b> <b>severalty.</b> (Later the property collapsed into the Missouri River and the grown sisters moved into Kansas City.) With their variety of heritage, the Conley daughters were one-sixteenth Wyandot, and some parts Scots-Irish and English.|$|R
5000|$|Burke Act (1906), {{also known}} as the Forced Fee Patenting Act, amended the Dawes Act of 1887 (formally known as the General Allotment Act ("GAA"), under which the {{communal}} land held by tribes on the Indian reservations was broken up and distributed <b>in</b> <b>severalty</b> to individual households of tribal members. It required the government to assess whether individuals were [...] "competent and capable" [...] before giving them free simple patents to their allotted land.|$|R
60|$|He {{exaggerated the}} {{importance}} of the fact with the sensitiveness of a man to whom æsthetic cultivation was all-important. It appeared to him a far greater evil than it was; it was odious to him, like a vice; it was almost a crime. He spent a very miserable time in the Fine Arts Department of the Pymantoning County Agricultural Fair; and in a kind of horrible fascination he began to review the collection in detail, to guess its causes <b>in</b> <b>severalty</b> and to philosophize its lamentable consequences.|$|R
50|$|Welsh {{became known}} as an earnest {{advocate}} {{for the rights of}} Native Americans, a calling triggered by a visit to the Sioux Reservation in 1882. In 1883, his actions resulted in the founding of the Indian Rights Association in Philadelphia, and he served as its corresponding secretary for 34 years and its president for 11 years. Over the next 30 plus years, he urged the public and the United States Congress to provide education for Indian children, holding of lands <b>in</b> <b>severalty</b> by the Indians, and to extend civil law to their reservations.|$|R
50|$|A {{document}} dated 30 Jan 1747 records six men aged over 16 {{who lived}} in the village of Kilmuir (Kilmuire), in the parish of Kilmuir-Easter, Ross-shire who did not take part in the Jacobite rising of 1745, even though they lived on the Jacobite Lord Cromartie's estate. They were: James Munro, <b>tenant</b> <b>in</b> Kilmuire; Andrew Roy, <b>tenant</b> <b>in</b> Kilmuire; John Mackenzie, <b>tenant</b> <b>in</b> Kilmuire; Walter?Mailevin, <b>tenant</b> <b>in</b> Kilmuire; Alexander Munro, Wright in Kilmuire; David Munro, his brother.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tenants</b> <b>in</b> common have {{no right}} of survivorship, meaning that if one <b>tenant</b> <b>in</b> common dies, that <b>tenant's</b> {{interest}} <b>in</b> the property {{will be part of}} his or her estate and pass by inheritance to that owner's devisees or heirs, either by will, or by intestate succession. Also, as each <b>tenant</b> <b>in</b> common has an interest in the property, they may, {{in the absence of any}} restriction agreed to between all the <b>tenants</b> <b>in</b> common, sell or otherwise deal with the interest in the property (e.g. mortgage it) during their lifetime, like any other property interest.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} the Act passed, it was United States policy to {{eliminate}} Indian reservations, dividing the communal territory and allotting 160-acre plots to individual heads of households, to be owned <b>in</b> <b>severalty.</b> Before allotment, reservation territory was not owned in the usual European-American sense, but was reserved {{for the benefit of}} entire Indian tribes. The communal benefits were apportioned to tribe members according to tribal law and custom. Generally, Indians held the land in a communal fashion. Non-Indians were not allowed to own land on reservations, a fact which limited the value of the land to the Indians. (It reduced the market for it).|$|R

50|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} in examining the free peasants of this era {{is that no one}} single definition can be attached to them.

5000|$|Since {{the land}} belonged {{exclusively}} to the Otoe prior to the exchange, the government worked to secure agreement by the Omaha, Iowa, and Yankton and Santee bands of Sioux to pay the Otoe $3000 {{for the rights of}} their [...] "half-breeds" [...] to live on the reservation. Original plans were for land ownership to be held in common, as other American Indian land titles were held. However, legislation included a provision allowing the US President to assign individual tracts to individual owners. In 1860, thirty years after the creation of the Reservation, the government moved to allot tracts to individual households, in an effort to force assimilation to European-American practices. This {{was the first time in}} the history of American acts and treaties that American Indians were allotted land <b>in</b> <b>severalty.</b>|$|R

40|$|The term 2 ̆ 2 {{partnership}} estates 2 ̆ 2 is used {{to designate}} a certain class of resulting trusts. These particular resulting trusts are classed with joint estates because, as a usual thing, the legal title is held by {{all the members of}} a partnership as <b>tenants</b> <b>in</b> common, and in equity, the partners are considered as joint tenants for the purpose of administering the trust. But the legal title is not necessarily held by all the members as <b>tenants</b> <b>in</b> common; for it may be vested in one of the partners as <b>tenant</b> <b>in</b> severalty; in which case there is not only the resulting partnership trust, but an additional subordinate resulting trust to the partners as equitable <b>tenants</b> <b>in</b> common. The legal title may be in one or in several. As will be shown, the partners bear a two-fold relation to the beneficial interest in the property; for each has a separate and distinct lien on the property for any balance which may be found to be due him on an accounting; and as to this lien, his interest is purely potential: the balance on an accounting having been paid, the partners now own the residue of the beneficial interest as <b>tenants</b> <b>in</b> common...|$|R
