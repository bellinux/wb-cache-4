The next day Scrimgeour arrives at the Burrow with Albus Dumbledore's will and distributes three items to Ron, Hermione, and Harry. Ron receives Dumbledore's Deluminator, Hermione receives a copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, and Harry receives the first Golden Snitch that he ever caught in a Quidditch match. Scrimgeour reveals that Harry was also bequeathed the Sword of Godric Gryffindor. The minister tells Harry that the sword was not Dumbledore's to bequeath, and in any case is missing.|$|E

5|$|Three group 3 {{elements}} occur naturally, scandium, yttrium, {{and either}} lanthanum or lutetium. Lanthanum continues the trend started by two lighter members in general chemical behavior, while lutetium behaves more similarly to yttrium. While {{the choice of}} lutetium would be {{in accordance with the}} trend for period 6 transition metals to behave more similarly to their upper periodic table neighbors, the choice of lanthanum is in accordance with the trends in the s-block, which the group 3 elements are chemically more similar to. <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>are</b> silvery-white metals under standard conditions. The fourth element, either actinium or lawrencium, has only radioactive isotopes. Actinium, which occurs only in trace amounts, continues the trend in chemical behavior for metals that form tripositive ions with a noble gas configuration; synthetic lawrencium is calculated and partially shown to be more similar to lutetium and yttrium. So far, no experiments have been conducted to synthesize any element that could be the next group 3 element. Unbiunium (Ubu), which could be considered a group 3 element if preceded by lanthanum and actinium, might be synthesized in the near future, it being only three spaces away from the current heaviest element known, oganesson.|$|E

25|$|Springtails (Collembola) {{form the}} largest of the three {{lineages}} of modern hexapods that are no longer considered insects (the other two are the Protura and Diplura). Although the three orders are sometimes grouped together in a class called Entognatha because they have internal mouthparts, they {{do not appear to be}} any more closely related to one another than <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>are</b> to insects, which have external mouthparts.|$|E
25|$|The {{refractory}} metals show {{a wide variety}} of chemical properties because they are members of three distinct groups in the periodic table. They are easily oxidized, but this reaction is slowed down in the bulk metal by the formation of stable oxide layers on the surface. Especially the oxide of rhenium is more volatile than the metal, and therefore at high temperature the stabilization against the attack of oxygen is lost, because the oxide layer evaporates. <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>are</b> relatively stable against acids.|$|E

Jack breaks out of jail and takes Jen with him to evade police. <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>are</b> on the run for a while, until they join up with a circus. Jack becomes a laborer and Jen the {{assistant}} with Abby, their daughter. Abby strikes up a good friendship with the ringmaster's son. Eventually, Jack and Jennifer flee for Africa. While in Africa, Jennifer and Jack experience some problems with their relationship, especially when Jennifer falls for a young man named Colin Murphy...whom she does not realize is Shawn Brady's nephew! She flees to Ireland with Abby, where she ends up getting herself in trouble, and then has to come back to Salem with Bo. Jack soon follows her, and the two move in together so they can look after Abigail. Jennifer initially pushes Jack away and concentrates on relationships, first with Brandon then Colin, but she and Jack can't resist that certain something that has always been between them. They are remarried, much to the delight of their daughter Abby.|$|E

500|$|Writing for the Gulf News Hasan Tariq Al Hasan {{argued that}} Tamarod protests on 14 August {{had failed to}} live up to the expectations. He said that one of the main reasons was {{conflicting}} instructions between Bahrain Rebellion Movement and February 14 Youth Coalition, which launched its own Tamarod protest under the title [...] "Tamarod Storm". Ala'a Shehabi said the security measures had made it [...] "physically impossible" [...] for big numbers to gather in one place. In an opinion column in Al-Wasat, Jameel al-Mahari said it was not appropriate to speak about failure or success of the protests, instead he argued that Bahrain's real success was when the unrest ended, [...] "when everyone listens to the voice of reason, when we reach compatible solutions, when the national cohesion is restored and when people feel they are equal before law and that <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>are</b> first class citizens." ...|$|E
500|$|Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Downs {{music is}} rooted in Americana and draws {{on a number of}} styles, {{including}} blues, folk, ragtime, norteño, rock, and country music. For the songs, Cooder adapted musical language from historical sources and incorporated styles from both North and South American traditions. In his interview on Marketplace, he explained his stylistic approach for Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down, stating [...] "to me, these musical styles and sounds are narratives as well. I mean everything about them — if it's an accordion, horns, the banda horns for the immigrant tunes — <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>are</b> part of the story. And you can see it then, you can imagine the Arizona border that's hot, 120 degrees in the shade, dusty. The banda horns are coming from some truck over there." [...] According to him, musical settings for certain songs were decided based on their respective compositions, such as when [...] "the words would come to me in ¾ time, that meant corrido, that means accordion; banda horns because they’re exciting." ...|$|E

[...] Adult characters played by Matthew Morrison and Jane Lynch would remain to provide continuity to the series, though according to Falchuk, some students—Rachel, Finn and Kurt in particular—would likely remain on the show after they graduate. In May 2012, Murphy said that just because a character on the show graduates high school does not mean that they are leaving, [...] "A lot of people have been writing Dianna's off the show, Amber's off the show — they're not off the show. I think Amber was talking about that bittersweet feeling of, 'I'll never be in the choir room with that exact group of people.' At least that's what she told me ... When I read that [...] I said, 'I think people will misconstrue that.' She's excited about where her character is going. <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>are.</b> I wanted to do the right thing by all of them." [...] He then continued: [...] "They're all coming back.

2500|$|Marine Conservation Activism {{refers to}} the efforts of {{non-governmental}} organizations and individuals to bring about social and political change in the area of marine conservation. Marine conservation is properly conceived as a set of management strategies for the protection and preservation of ecosystems in oceans and seas.

[...] There are many different kinds of organizations and agencies that work toward these common goals. <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>are</b> a part of the growing movement that is ocean conservation.

Bang here gives a group of 34 spells, mostly recorded in the 18th–19th century though two are assigned to the 17th (c. 1668 and 1670), and 31 of the charms are for treating horses with an injured leg. The name for the horse's trauma, which occurs in the titles, is [...] in most of the rhymes, with smatterings of raina and bridge (sic.), but <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>are</b> essentially synonymous with brigde, glossed as the [...] "dislocation of the limb" [...] in Aasen's dictionary.|$|E
