25|$|Anti-Yugoslav {{members of}} the Albanian Communist Party had begun to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a plot by Tito who {{intended}} to destabilize the Party. Koçi Xoxe, Sejfulla Malëshova and others who supported Yugoslavia were looked upon with deep suspicion. Tito's position on Albania {{was that it was}} too weak to stand on its own and that it would do better as a part of Yugoslavia. Hoxha alleged that Tito had made it his goal to get Albania into Yugoslavia, firstly by creating the Treaty of Friendship, Co-operation and Mutual Aid in 1946. In time, Albania began to feel that the treaty was heavily slanted towards Yugoslav interests, much like the Italian agreements with Albania under Zog that made the nation dependent upon Italy.|$|E

When Hergé read the English version of the book, he found it to be [...] "absolutely delirious" [...] and even suggested to the book's translator, [...] "You really would <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> originally written in English." [...] In the original French version, Calculus explains about his invention and ignores Haddock's attempt to refer to the latest developments in the United States. This is not seen in the English edition.|$|E
500|$|The inquest in August 1971 was {{not able}} to {{establish}} the exact sequence of events. [...] It was established that all three were shot at very close range, probably in a line. All had been drinking, and Joseph was found to be severely intoxicated. The jury was told that the three were probably shot whilst relieving themselves beside the road. The coroner commented: [...] "You may <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> not only murder, but one of the vilest crimes ever heard of in living memory". The bodies were heaped {{on top of each other}} with two beer glasses lying near to them. After failing to return to their barracks by 18:30 the three were listed as AWOL. Their bodies were found by children at 21:30.|$|E

500|$|South Park animators {{created the}} episode using PowerAnimator, the Alias Systems Corporation {{animation}} program most {{commonly known as}} [...] "Alias". It was particularly challenging for animators to design the complex scheme of lights during the episode's disco club scene. Eric Stough, director of animation for the series, said it {{took one of the}} technical directors [...] "about half a day" [...] to set up the brief scene. Parker said he was particularly happy with the animation in [...] "Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride", and said he believed the series was starting to settle into the defined look it has retained throughout the years. Parker said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> where we finally felt like we got it right, we got the look of it right". However, the animation includes some perspective errors, particularly during the football scenes, where Chef stands about as wide as a 10-yard marking on the field. Parker said the animators worked for a long time on the snow in the outdoor scenes, but ultimately decided they did not like how it came out.|$|E
500|$|Fearnet's Alyse Wax wrote, [...] "I {{definitely}} <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> {{the best}} [...] "over there" [...] episode {{they have had}} so far. They had an actual case, rather than still setting up who these doppelgangers are." [...] HitFix writer Ryan McGee thought the initial twist over the brothers' identities [...] "was fun", though it [...] "grew old quickly". He praised the series for not [...] "dragging out" [...] Olivia discovering her true identity, explaining [...] "While episodes set Over There are delicious fun, having Olivia unaware for a long stretch would have strained credibility and perhaps damaged audience opinion of her character’s integrity." [...] Writing for Den of Geek, Billy Grifter commented, [...] "I have three words for the latest Fringe episode, and they're all 'brilliant'. Season three has moved gracefully, like a big cat stalking its prey, from the outset, playing a flipside game where we cleverly alternate between our universe and an alternate one where Olivia is currently resident." [...] Grifter praised the Ashmore brothers' acting {{as well as their}} characters' storylines, calling their switch [...] "a nice twist that's cleverly played".|$|E
500|$|Two {{plans for}} modernizing the ship were put forward before World War I. In 1907 the Naval General Staff {{proposed}} a major reconstruction {{aimed at reducing}} her draft and raising her armor belt higher out of the water. Her above-water torpedo tubes, torpedo nets, auxiliary boilers and 47-millimeter guns would have been removed, her superstructure cut down and her rigging reduced to a single pole mast. These changes would have reduced her displacement by , but the plan was rejected due to a shortage of money. Her above-water torpedo tubes, however, were removed about this time. In 1912 {{the staff of the}} Black Sea Fleet proposed to replace all of her 47mm guns with four [...] guns and to remove the auxiliary boilers and the submerged torpedo tubes to offset the additional weight. The Naval General Staff did not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> worth the cost and rejected the plan. Even though these plans did not come to fruition, other alterations were made to Rostislav before the war. A dozen of her 37mm guns were removed in 1906, and she was fitted with [...] rangefinders, probably made by Barr and Stroud, in 1907 and 1908.|$|E

Many Chinese people <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> his most important achievement. He was also in favor of a pragmatic policy in Tibet after realising the mistakes of previous policies. He ordered the withdrawal of thousands of Chinese Han cadres from the Tibet Autonomous Region following a May 1980 visit to the region, believing that Tibetans should be empowered to administer their own affairs. Han Chinese who remained were required to learn Tibetan. He set out six requirements to improve 'existing conditions', including the increase of state funds to the Autonomous Region, improvements in education, and [...] "efforts to revive Tibetan culture". At the same time, Hu stated that [...] "anything that is not suited to Tibet's conditions should be rejected or modified". Hu made a point of explicitly apologizing to Tibetans for China's misrule of the region during this trip.|$|E

To be given the freedom to {{represent}} a moment in our cultural and social zeitgeist—she has left a great imprint on me. I will miss her. May we meet again." [...] While at Paleyfest 2016 promoting Fear the Walking Dead, she addressed Lexa's death publicly for the first time. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, {{she said she was}} [...] "surprised by the intensity and the fury" [...] that came from fans and she did not think [...] "anyone on the show expected such social outcry." [...] To Debnam-Carey, [...] "any attention we can draw to a movement like that is an amazing thing, and is a great thing to pursue and keep working towards." [...] She emphasized Lexa's death never came from a place of hate or negativity from the writers or Rothenberg, or anyone in the crew, and the death was purely a creative decision made due to her obligations to Fear the Walking Dead. [...] "I know obviously that it's hard when there are social issues going on and maybe they were dealt with in an insensitive way for some people," [...] stated Debnam-Carey. [...] "And I hate that people feel like that. That's really awful if people feel ostracized or targeted." [...] At her second Q panel weekend at Copenhagen Comic-Con, she said, [...] "It saddens me to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> an event that tarnished the show." ...|$|E
