5|$|Marwan's 737 {{expedition}} was {{the climax}} of the Arab–Khazar wars, but its actual results were meagre. Although the Arab campaigns after Ardabil may indeed have discouraged the Khazars from further warfare, any recognition of Islam or of Arab supremacy by the khagan was evidently conditional upon the presence of Arab troops deep in Khazar territory, and such presence could not be sustained for long. Furthermore, the credibility of <b>the</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> khagan to Islam is disputed: al-Baladhuri's account, which probably reflects closer the original sources, suggests that it was not the khagan but a minor lord who converted to Islam and was placed in charge of the Khazars at al-Lakz. <b>The</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> khagan is also apparently contradicted by the fact that c. 740 the Khazar court embraced Judaism as its official faith, a decision which clearly owed a great deal to the determination of the Khazars to avoid assimilation by and emphasize their independence from the Christian Byzantine and the Muslim Arab empires.|$|E

By 1978, 162 cars had been delivered to Oslo Sporveier. These were manufactured in four series, named T1 through T4, with varying specifications. T1 was manufactured in 90 units from 1964 to 1966 {{for the opening}} of the Grorud Line and <b>the</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lambertseter Line. The first 30 have driver's cabs in both directions (designated T1-2), while the latter 60 have it in only one end (designated T1-1).

From 1969 to 1972, 30 T3s were built for the Furuset Line. Further expansions of the lines resulted in 37 T4s being built from 1976 to 1978. The T1000s are numbered 1001–1162.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWhen the Spanish Monarchs {{decided on}} <b>the</b> {{expulsion}} <b>of</b> Muslims from their territories of Castile (1502) and Valencia-Catalonia-Aragon (1525), they hoped most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Muslims {{would remain in}} Spain, accept baptism, and rapidly become “good Christians. ” But if <b>the</b> decrees <b>of</b> expulsion were followed by massive <b>conversion,</b> <b>the</b> elimination <b>of</b> Islam was far from achieved among the Moriscos (the converts and their descendants). This situation aroused much discussion among theologians, prelates, and royal counselors about <b>the</b> validity <b>of</b> forced <b>conversion</b> and <b>the</b> best means to ensure <b>the</b> effective <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moriscos.
