500|$|The film {{score for}} Obsessed {{was written by}} James Dooley. The {{beginning}} of Obsessed, where the Charles are seen in their home, plays adult contemporary music in the background. The remainder of the film's first act is supported by light piano instrumentation, and occasional [...] "low-register whoosh-thump noises, of <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>you</b> might hear in a stalker movie", according to Sady Doyle of The Guardian.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is a [...] "melancholic and mature farewell" [...] to a failed {{relationship}}. Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone wrote Rihanna [...] "slow-boiling" [...] interprets the line [...] "What you did to me was a crime". According to Jude Rogers of BBC Music the lyrics of the song hint towards her failed relationship with Brown. A reviewer of Plugged In wrote that the lyrics that allude to this are [...] "And I let you reach me one more time/But that’s enough." [...] According to the reviewer, she later admits that the she was blind by her emotional confusion, [...] "your love ain’t <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>you</b> can keep." [...] Jon Pareless of The New York Times wrote that Rihanna compares her love to a crime scene in the [...] "elegiac" [...] "Cold Case Love" [...] which features the couplet [...] "Prints, pictures and white outlines / Are all that's left {{at the scene of}} a cold case love".|$|E
500|$|Rob Leane, for Den of Geek, {{stated that}} [...] "this week we {{continue}} to see the fallout of ’s revelations playing out in gleefully entertaining fashion ... we were treated to a twisty espionage-heavy thriller of an episode". Leane added that [...] "by pitting May against her other self in a well-shot, thumpingly-scored fight sequence, new-to-S.H.I.E.L.D. director Kevin Tancharoen used his experience from Mortal Kombat: Legacy to highlight how far the action elements of the show have come since the early days." [...] and also noted the development of multiple characters as positive. Kevin Fitzpatrick of Screen Crush said [...] "I had my trepidations about [...] "Face My Enemy"'s cutesy-looking callbacks to more camp episodes and spy tropes, <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>you</b> might expect from Chuck, back in the day. The hour certainly danced over that line here and there, what with May and Coulson’s only means to recover an important artifact lying in a lavish party, the stock laser grid security alarm, May's mirror image fight, and other such throwback fare, but I’d say [...] "Face My Enemy" [...] ended up more of a celebratory self-aware subversion, rather than {{a sign of the}} season running out on empty just yet." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Stay (Faraway, So Close!)" [...] was {{critically}} acclaimed. Music journalist Sam Richards {{rated the}} song four stars out of five, calling it [...] "a twinkling '90s alt. rock ballad- {{a cousin of}} Radiohead's [...] "High and Dry" [...] and Smashing Pumpkins' [...] "1979"- that just about manages to {{keep a lid on}} its impulse to seek out the nearest clifftop." [...] Hot Press editor Niall Stokes said [...] "the performance is full of languorous beauty, a gentle understated kind of emotion that seems at odds with the disorientation in the lyrics." [...] Billboard contributor Fred Bronson joked that it was an example of how songs named [...] "Stay" [...] reach the Hot 100, following similarly named hits by Big Mountain, The Four Seasons, Shakespears Sister, and Jodeci. Robert Levine of Spin called it one of their best songs, saying [...] "They're still obsessed with transcendence, whether it's <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>you</b> find on a Joshua Tree bluff or a [...] "Miami" [...] dance floor. And [...] framed that search in the most intimate of terms, even when they were too jaded to crawl out from under their lemon and look us in the eye." ...|$|E
2500|$|Buemi and Davidson were {{disappointed}} {{to achieve a}} third-place podium finish with Davidson saying Toyota had to learn from their mistake and make progress. Both drivers added that their focus {{would be on the}} championship. Lapierre accepted that his early race crash affected his team's ambitions of winning the race, stating he was unable to see anything because of low visibility, and did not expect to get the car back to the pit lane with the heavy damage it sustained: [...] "We crossed our fingers that the car would hold together to the end, and after this we can be pleased with what we accomplished." [...] Wolfgang Ullrich, the head of Audi Motorsport, expressed his respect for Porsche, saying the German company and Toyota were strong competitors and Ullrich held a belief that Audi would succeed despite of strenuous prerequisites for the season. He stated the event was [...] "of <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>you</b> can only experience at Le Mans" [...] with the deciding factors being that the Audi R18 e-tron quattro drove consistently fast for the entire duration of the race and said the victory was placed among one of the German company's greatest wins because of the constant changing factors for all the competing teams.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the dawn}} of the Open Era in 1968, {{professional}} players were once again allowed to compete in Grand Slam events. Laver became Wimbledon's first Open Era champion in 1968, beating the best amateur, American Arthur Ashe, in a semifinal and fellow-Australian Tony Roche in the final, both in straight sets. Laver was also the runner-up to Ken Rosewall in the first French Open. In this first [...] "open" [...] year, there were only eight open events besides Wimbledon and the French Open, where professionals, registered players, and amateurs could compete against each other. The professionals mainly played their own circuit, with two groups – National Tennis League (NTL) and World Championships Tennis (WCT)– operating. Laver was ranked No. 1 universally, winning the US Professional Championships on grass and the French Pro Championship on clay (both over John Newcombe). [...] Laver also won the last big open event of the year, the Pacific Southwest in Los Angeles on hard courts. Ashe regarded Laver's 4–6, 6–0, 6–0 final win over Ken Rosewall as one of his finest performances. Laver's post-match comment was, [...] "This is the kind of match you always dream about. <b>The</b> <b>kind</b> <b>you</b> play at night in your sleep." ...|$|E

I am like a dog. <b>The</b> <b>kinder</b> <b>you</b> are to me the more I love you.... How dreadful to go away to war--to {{violence}} and blood and death--to all that's brutalizing--with my heart and mind full of love for a noble girl like you!--If I come to love you any more I'll not be a man." ...|$|R
2500|$|The Minnesota Orchestra {{was founded}} in 1903 as the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra. Although it {{was among the first}} to perform on the radio and to record, it {{initially}} was not known as one of the country's great orchestras. In the 1930s, Eugene Ormandy transformed it into an excellent ensemble and expanded its repertory, making it the most-recorded orchestra in the United States, and giving it an international reputation. Other illustrious conductors included Dimitri Mitropoulos and Antal Dorati. Osmo Vänskä, a Finnish conductor, music director since 2003, took the orchestra into its second century. Its live performances and recordings in a program of the complete works of Ludwig van Beethoven have been received with enthusiasm, the group has been called [...] "brilliant", and a critic has stated the musicians are enjoying [...] "their first golden age" [...] since the days of Ormandy and Mitropoulos. Another critic wrote for The New Yorker of a concert in 2010 and its [...] "uncanny, wrenching power, <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>you</b> hear once or twice a decade" [...] and thought that that day the Minnesota Orchestra was [...] "the greatest orchestra in the world". [...] The Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra is the only full-time professional chamber orchestra in the country, [...] and also tours and records. [...] Professional orchestral ensembles outside the Twin Cities include the Duluth Superior Symphony Orchestra and the Rochester Symphony Orchestra and Chorale.|$|E
