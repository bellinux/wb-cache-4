500|$|Criticism {{was mainly}} {{targeted}} towards its repetitiveness and {{the controls of}} the mobile version. Tom Christiansen of Gamezebo was mixed on the game, saying that there was [...] "nothing <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> attention" [...] {{and that it was}} [...] "highly repetitive, overall." [...] Pocket Gamer, reviewing the mobile version, described its controls as [...] "floaty." ...|$|E
500|$|Oxford cox Acer Nethercott said [...] "Our bowman {{came off}} {{his seat and}} could not {{continue}} properly – it was race over after that." [...] Regarding the rejected appeal, he claimed that the umpire [...] "had laid down to both coxes before the race {{that there was a}} way he wanted to conduct the race. [...] And then he did something completely different in the race." [...] Kennelly, the bowman, claimed he was [...] "100 per cent confident that if what happened didn't happen we would have won" [...] while Cambridge cox Kenelm Richardson stated [...] "The umpire was very good and told me <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> line, so I knew I was exactly where I needed to be".|$|E
500|$|According to Moss, Peggy [...] "has the {{capability}} of being a Don Draper, and there can't be {{two of them in}} the office." [...] The goodbye scene between Don and Peggy was a difficult one to shoot. Moss said, [...] "That scene was a really, really tough scene to do. They didn't tell me {{they were going to do}} this, but they told Jon <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> hand and not let it go. Then he did, and I lost it. Every single one of those tears were absolutely real. She wants to stay with all of her heart. She does not want to leave, but she knows she has to." [...] Hamm said there was [...] "respect, understanding, and admiration between those two characters. This is the exact right time for her to leave." ...|$|E

500|$|Gaga was {{the most}} {{nominated}} artist at 2010's Video Music Awards with a record thirteen nominations, including two nods for Video of the Year (the first female artist to achieve this feat). She arrived in an Alexander McQueen dress and changed into a Giorgio Armani number before donning her third and final outfit of the evening: a dress, hat, boots, and purse made of raw meat. Gaga wore the meat dress to accept her Video of the Year trophy for [...] "Bad Romance"; as she accepted the award from presenter Cher, she joked, [...] "I never thought I'd be asking Cher <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> meat purse." [...] Gaga continued to wear the dress after the awards show for press photos and an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. Gaga explained her interpretation of the dress to DeGeneres, stating, [...] "If we don’t {{stand up for what}} we believe in and if we don’t fight for our rights pretty soon we’re going to have as much rights as the meat on our bones." [...] "Now, I love Lady Gaga, but as someone who also loves animals, it was really difficult for me to sit next to Lady Gaga while she was wearing that outfit," [...] DeGeneres, who is vegan, later wrote. [...] "But it did make me ask myself, what's the difference between her outfit and an outfit made of leather?" ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} contemporary music critics. Digital Spy's Robert Copsey noted [...] "Inside Out" [...] {{is one of}} the [...] "ten remaining tracks [...] continue the trend [...] ", considering the song's lyrics as [...] "blatantly slutty" [...] and praising [...] "the much-welcomed piano breakdown". David Buchanan of Consequence of Sound also agreed that [...] "the [...] singles are extraordinarily infectious, as is [...] "Inside Out", which slows the tempo, simultaneously sending Spears back to basics vocally, and into 2011 sonically." [...] On her review of Femme Fatale, Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club commented that [...] "songs like the dark, slinky [...] "Inside Out", the hyper-Euro chant-along [...] "Till The World Ends", and the strange, flute-assisted digression [...] "Criminal" [...] add texture to the wall-to-wall synth waves and booty bass." [...] The Guardians Alexis Petridis commented that the song [...] "lurches along on 's patent half-speed rhythm." [...] While Keith Caufield of Billboard considered [...] "Inside Out" [...] "easily a natural pick for 'Femme's' third single", Hannah Rishel of The Daily Collegian said that [...] "in general the song failed <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> attention. If I heard it on the radio, I probably would change the station." [...] Thomas Conner of the Chicago Sun-Times also gave the song a negative review, considering it a [...] "weak mid-tempo fare", along with [...] "Criminal". Following the release of Femme Fatale, [...] "Inside Out" [...] reached number fifty-nine on South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart, after selling 7,222 digital units of the song alone.|$|E
