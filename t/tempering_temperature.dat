50|$|By using a {{sufficiently}} cold temperature, both water and dopant are frozen in solution together forming an ice sheet. This impure ice sheet is inherently softer than pure-water ice {{but may be}} much harder than the scale strength desired. Once a desired thickness is achieved, the air temperature is raised to a <b>tempering</b> <b>temperature.</b> As {{the temperature of the}} ice rises the dopants come out of frozen solution and form liquid brine pockets. These brine pockets slowly drain out of the ice sheet thus weakening it. Provided the ice-sheet isn't allowed to refreeze, the strength of the ice continues to decrease approaching an asymptotic value. Choosing a correct ice scale then becomes a question of when to conduct the test. This softening {{is often referred to as}} tempering.|$|E
50|$|Tempering is {{most often}} {{performed}} on steel that has been heated above its upper critical (A3) temperature and then quickly cooled, in a process called quenching, using methods such as immersing the red-hot steel in water, oil, or forced-air. The quenched-steel, being placed in, or very near, its hardest possible state, is then tempered to incrementally decrease the hardness to a point more suitable for the desired application. The hardness of the quenched-steel depends on both cooling speed and on {{the composition of the}} alloy. Steel with a high carbon-content will reach a much harder state than steel with a low carbon-content. Likewise, tempering high-carbon steel to a certain temperature will produce steel that is considerably harder than low-carbon steel that is tempered at the same temperature. The amount of time held at the <b>tempering</b> <b>temperature</b> also has an effect. Tempering at a slightly elevated temperature for a shorter time may produce the same effect as tempering at a lower temperature for a longer time. Tempering times vary, depending on the carbon content, size, and desired application of the steel, but typically range from a few minutes to a few hours.|$|E
50|$|Precise {{control of}} time and <b>temperature</b> during the <b>tempering</b> process is crucial to achieve the desired balance of {{physical}} properties. Low <b>tempering</b> <b>temperatures</b> may only relieve the internal stresses, decreasing brittleness while maintaining {{a majority of the}} hardness. Higher <b>tempering</b> <b>temperatures</b> tend to produce a greater reduction in the hardness, sacrificing some yield strength and tensile strength for an increase in elasticity and plasticity. However, in some low alloy steels, containing other elements like chromium and molybdenum, <b>tempering</b> at low <b>temperatures</b> may produce an increase in hardness, while at higher temperatures the hardness will decrease. Many steels with high concentrations of these alloying elements behave like precipitation hardening alloys, which produces the opposite effects under the conditions found in quenching and tempering, and are referred to as maraging steels.|$|R

This observation implies the Formation of bainitic ferrite and cementite from the parent austenite phase without redistribution of the alloying elements, since the solubility of copper in cementite is negligible and very low in bainitic ferrite. By carefully designing suitable tempering treatments, it is possible to produce copper precipitation not only within tempered bainitic ferrite in both types of steel using low <b>tempering</b> <b>temperatures,</b> but also within the tempered bainitic cementite of the copper steel at higher <b>tempering</b> <b>temperatures.</b> The interpretation of these experimental data strongly supports the theory that bainite formation is promoted through a shear controlled type of mechanism.

40|$|A medium carbon {{low alloy}} steel, {{electroslag}} refined, modified AFNOR 15 CDV 6, {{has been developed}} for satellite launch vehicle and related applications. Conventionally processed (without electroslag refining) mostly bainitic AFNOR 15 CDV 6 (with 0. 15 wt-% carbon and similar to 3. 5 wt-% other alloying elements) has a yield strength of similar to 800 MPa. Electroslag refining, coupled with increased carbon (0. 29 wt-% carbon, but no change in percentage of other alloying elements), increased the yield strength to about 1300 - 1400 Wa, without sacrificing ductility. The microstructure of the modified grade was martensitic. Martensite in the as hardened state was mostly {{in the form of}} laths, although similar to 20 % plate martensite was also observed. Until 150 degreesC tempering, no noticeable loss of tetragonality was observed, while the unit cell parameter cla ratio dropped to almost 1 after 300 degreesC tempering. The interesting observation at 150 degreesC tempering was the predominant presence of fine rodlike. carbide, which may also explain the increased yield strength.

The corrosion rate measurement proved that Vanax tempered at lower ranges (200 °C, 400 °Cand 450 °C) showed the best corrosion resistance while higher <b>tempering</b> <b>temperatures</b> such as 500 °C, Elmax and AISI O 1 tempered at 200 °Csuffered a great deal of general corrosion attack. Thermo-Calc calculations showed the formation of a hard phase, VN as primary nitrides instead of primary chromium carbides at austenizing temperature for the Vanax group. Higher amount of chromium is dissolved in solid solution in Vanax at austenizing temperature hence the martensite matrix has, after quenching, a higher chromium content that helps passivation.

When the <b>tempering</b> <b>temperature</b> increased, yield and tensile strengths decreased, whereas the ductility properties improved. In addition, yield and tensile strengths were not affected by cooling rate from <b>tempering</b> <b>temperature,</b> whereas the ductility properties were slightly affected. The increase in <b>tempering</b> <b>temperature</b> significantly led to improvement in the toughness to fracture of the alloy. The effect of cooling rate on impact energy for the samples tempered at 450 degrees C and 550 degrees C was negligible. By the contrast, impact energy for the samples tempered at 650 degrees C was markedly affected by cooling rate, in which the highest value was achieved for a cooling rate of 50 degrees C/s...|$|E
40|$|Abrasive Water Jet (AWJ) {{is a well}} {{established}} manufacturing technique, able to achieve high machining accuracy. AWJ kerf properties are mainly {{described in terms of}} width, taper (conicity) and roughness. The aim of the present work is to evaluate the above mentioned accuracy indexes as a function of both process parameters and cut material properties. In particular, specimens of C 45 EN 1083 - 2 carbon steel were tested under different metallurgical conditions. Normalized or quenched and tempered specimens were taken into account: different <b>tempering</b> <b>temperatures</b> were tested. Jet pressure, feed rate and abrasive mass flow rate were investigated as well. A factorial plan was designed to allow the evaluation of the interaction between material properties and process parameters...|$|R
40|$|The article {{describes}} {{basic principles of}} induction bending and the change of mechanical properties from as received (straight) pipe made from HSLA steel to induction bend. The main {{purpose of this article}} is to experiment with <b>tempering</b> <b>temperatures</b> below 540 °C. After tempering at 540 °C which is the lowest recommended temperature for post bend heat treatment (PBHT) according to CSA specifications (Canadian Standards Association) the induction bend area in many cases does not achieve the minimum required mechanical properties and therefore it is not accepted for usage. In this article mechanical properties such as tensile, toughness, hardness are evaluated. Also the article contains microstructural analyses and comparison of bended and heat treated samples...|$|R
