5|$|Horses, {{particularly}} colts, {{sometimes are}} physically capable of reproduction at about 18months, but domesticated horses are rarely allowed to breed {{before the age}} of three, especially females. Horses four years old are considered mature, although the skeleton normally continues to develop until the age of six; maturation also depends on the horse's size, breed, sex, and quality of care. Larger horses have larger bones; therefore, not only do the bones <b>take</b> <b>longer</b> to form bone tissue, but the epiphyseal plates are larger and <b>take</b> <b>longer</b> to convert from cartilage to bone. These plates convert after the other parts of the bones, and are crucial to development.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, {{the first}} year of pipelaying, Alyeska set a goal of {{completing}} 45 percent of the 800-mile route. This would not be laid in a straight line, since it was expected that river crossings would <b>take</b> <b>longer</b> to complete than portions of the pipeline on dry land. Work on the pumping stations and the Valdez Marine Terminal, which had begun in the fall of 1974, also was expected to <b>take</b> <b>longer</b> than laying pipe. Conversely, work on those two projects could proceed during the winter, when pipelaying could not take place due to the frozen ground.|$|E

5|$|The iPhone 5 is shipped with iOS 6, {{which was}} {{released}} on September 19, 2012. Many of the 's features that work specifically with the included iOS 6.0 operating system only worked in certain territories on release.

5|$|Closely {{related to}} light {{deflection}} is the gravitational time delay (or Shapiro delay), the phenomenon that light signals <b>take</b> <b>longer</b> {{to move through}} a gravitational field than they would {{in the absence of}} that field. There have been numerous successful tests of this prediction. In the parameterized post-Newtonian formalism (PPN), measurements of both the deflection of light and the gravitational time delay determine a parameter called γ, which encodes the influence of gravity on the geometry of space.|$|E

50|$|The results {{revealed}} that participants preferred 12 Lines over Big Abstract when they thought 12 Lines <b>took</b> <b>longer</b> to paint, but the opposite tended to be true when they thought that Big Abstract <b>took</b> <b>longer</b> to paint. The effort manipulation had a similar effect on participants estimates of how much the paintings were worth. Participants who thought 12 Lines <b>took</b> <b>longer</b> to produce {{thought that it was}} worth more money than Big Abstract, whereas the opposite tended to be true when participants thought that Big Abstract <b>took</b> <b>longer</b> to paint. The data also indicated that the effect of perceived effort on perceived quality was independent of whether participants had self-professed expertise in the domain. Self-identified art experts did not appear to rely on effort any less than novices, {{despite the fact that the}} self-identified experts were presumably more practiced at evaluating art. This points to the generality and intuitive appeal of effort as a heuristic for quality.|$|R

5|$|In COPD, it may <b>take</b> <b>longer</b> {{to breathe}} out than to breathe in. Chest {{tightness}} may occur {{but is not}} common and {{may be caused by}} another problem. Those with obstructed airflow may have wheezing or decreased sounds with air entry on examination of the chest with a stethoscope. A barrel chest is a characteristic sign of COPD, but is relatively uncommon. Tripod positioning may occur as the disease worsens.|$|E
5|$|Most bovids {{alternately}} {{feed and}} ruminate throughout the day. While those that feed on concentrates feed and digest in short intervals, the roughage feeders <b>take</b> <b>longer</b> intervals. Only small {{species such as}} the duiker browse {{for a few hours}} during day or night. Feeding habits are related to body size; while small bovids forage in dense and closed habitat, larger species feed upon high-fiber vegetation in open grasslands.|$|E
5|$|Since camels have a {{slow growth}} rate; they reach sexual {{maturity}} only in advanced years. The age of sexual maturity varies geographically and {{depends on the}} individual, as does the reproductive period. Both sexes might mature by {{three to five years}} of age, though successful breeding could <b>take</b> <b>longer.</b> Mating occurs once a year, and peaks in the rainy season. The mating season lasts three to five months, but may last a year for older animals.|$|E

5|$|The {{pipeline}} is surveyed {{several times}} per day, mostly by air. Foot and road patrols also {{take place to}} check for problems such as leaks or pipe settling or shifting. The pipeline can be surveyed {{in as little as}} two hours, but most surveys <b>take</b> <b>longer</b> to ensure thoroughness. These external inspections are only part of standard maintenance, however. The majority of pipeline maintenance is done by pipeline pigs—mechanical devices sent through the pipeline to perform a variety of functions.|$|E
5|$|Between October 1942 and November 1943, Groves paid monthly {{visits to}} the Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley. Reports {{indicated}} that compared to the alternatives of a gaseous diffusion plant or a plutonium-producing nuclear reactor, an electromagnetic plant would <b>take</b> <b>longer</b> and require more scarce materials to build, and need more manpower and more electricity to operate. The cost of a kilogram of fissile material would therefore be much greater. On the other hand, while the alternative processes still faced considerable technical obstacles, the electromagnetic process was proven to work, and could be built in stages that would immediately start producing fissile material. Groves cancelled the pilot plant on 14 November, in favor of proceeding immediately with the production plant.|$|E
5|$|Eggs {{are laid}} {{in a series}} of slits usually cut by the mother's {{ovipositor}} in live branches or twigs of their food plants. On average about sixteen eggs, among a total batch of a few hundred, are laid in each slit. The batch all hatch around 70 days later – usually within a day or two of one another – but <b>take</b> <b>longer</b> in cold or dry conditions. Oviposition has been observed {{on a wide range of}} native and introduced plant species and can weaken the branches of young orchard trees such that they cannot sustain the load of their fruit.|$|E

5|$|Guitarist Chris Poland {{and drummer}} Gar Samuelson had been {{expelled}} from the band following {{the conclusion of the}} Peace Sells tour for disruptive behavior, including Poland's habit of pawning band equipment to pay for drugs. Samuelson was immediately replaced by his drum technician, Chuck Behler. However, a new guitarist would <b>take</b> <b>longer</b> to emerge. At first, the band hired guitarist Jay Reynolds from the band Malice, but Reynolds was not up to the task of recording, and was subsequently replaced by his guitar teacher, Jeff Young. Dave Mustaine has since stated his regret for the way he handled Reynolds's firing.|$|E
5|$|In December 1986, the Public Road Administration {{recommended}} a bridge solution. SBT {{changed its name}} to Sunnhordland Bru- og Tunnelselskap, and a majority of the board shifted towards being in favor of a fixed link. The Norwegian Coastal Administration stated that they would not allow a pontoon bridge. On 26 June 1987, SBT decided to work towards permission to collect advanced tolls on the ferry services. The board unanimously supported the triangular proposal on 16 September, which was estimated to cost NOK660 million. This was criticized by Hordaland Public Roads Administration, who stated that it would <b>take</b> <b>longer</b> time to plan, and thus complete, the Triangle Link.|$|E
5|$|Like other newts, Triturus species {{develop in}} the water as larvae, and return to it each year for breeding. Adults spend one half to three {{quarters}} of the year on land, depending on the species, and thus depend on both suitable aquatic breeding sites and terrestrial habitats. After larval development in the first year, juveniles pass another year or two before reaching maturity; in the north and at higher elevations, this can <b>take</b> <b>longer.</b> The larval and juvenile stages are the riskiest for the newts, while survival is higher in adults. Once the risky stages passed, adult newts usually attain an age of seven to nine years, although individuals of the northern crested newts have reached 17 years in the wild.|$|E

5|$|Quantitative {{chemicals}} {{are those that}} are present in high concentration in plants (5 – 40% dry weight) and are equally effective against all specialists and generalist herbivores. Most quantitative metabolites are digestibility reducers that make plant cell walls indigestible to animals. The effects of quantitative metabolites are dosage dependent and the higher these chemicals’ proportion in the herbivore’s diet, the less nutrition the herbivore can gain from ingesting plant tissues. Because they are typically large molecules, these defenses are energetically expensive to produce and maintain, and often <b>take</b> <b>longer</b> to synthesize and transport.|$|E

A poll from January 1988 showed that 78.6 {{percent of the population of}} Bømlo wanted the Triangle Link, while 8.6 percent wanted the pontoon bridge. On 6 January, SBT started negotiating loans with various banks to receive financial guarantees for the Triangle Link, and by February sufficient funding had been secured.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} time it {{typically}} takes a piercing to heal varies widely according to the placement of the piercing. Genital piercings can be among the quicker to heal, with piercings of the clitoral hood and Prince Albert piercings healing in as little as a month, though some may <b>take</b> <b>longer.</b> Navel piercings can be the slowest to heal, with one source reporting a range of six months to two full years. The prolonged healing of navel piercings may be connected to clothing friction.|$|E
