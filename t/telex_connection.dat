5000|$|The {{alphabet}} {{used in the}} ARQ-M protocol {{is based}} on the CCITT Telegraph Alphabet No. 2 more commonly known as Baudot. [...] This alphabet has five bits, and therefore has 25 or 32 different possible symbols. It uses letters shift and figures shifts to select different sets of characters similar to a typewriter. The ARQ-M alphabet being synchronous always has to send data and does not have gaps between characters. It does not include start and stop bits that would be used in asynchronous transmissions and so saves on those two bits per character. In asynchronous transmissions a steady stop signal indicates that there is nothing to send. A prolonged start signal can be used for signalling, for example to select a destination for a <b>telex</b> <b>connection.</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{situations}} of crisis politicians {{are expected to}} keep calm and to de-escalate the state of affairs. In this paper I will discuss two devices for crisis communication with regard to form and behaviour: First, the legendary “Red Phone” as a direct communication link between Washington and Moscow, which allows the president to present himself as a capable leader with a cool mind, who {{can pick up the}} “Red Phone” and convince a political opponent in a crisis. Second, the “Hotline” as a highly formalised <b>telex</b> <b>connection</b> between both capitals, which enables the political leaders of the US and the USSR to communicate quickly and reliably but without capitalising on the abilities of the president as a cool-headed negotiator. The aim of this analysis is to discuss how both devices were presented to the public and used by the politicians and how this may impact on national and international politics...|$|E
5000|$|Additionally, ROTOR re-arranged the {{existing}} RAF Fighter Command structure into six [...] "Sector Operational Commands" [...] (SOC) {{with their own}} command bunkers (three level 'R4' protected accommodation). Only four of these were built. Additional [...] "Anti-Aircraft Operations Rooms" [...] were built to coordinate the British Army's AA defences in the same overall system. The entire network of bunkers, radars, fighter control and command centres used up 350,000 tons of concrete, 20,000 tons of steel and {{thousands of miles of}} telephone and <b>telex</b> <b>connections.</b>|$|R
50|$|Telex service spread within Europe and (particularly after 1945) {{around the}} world.By 1978, West Germany, {{including}} West Berlin, had 123,298 <b>telex</b> <b>connections.</b> Long before automatic telephony became available, most countries, even in central Africa and Asia, {{had at least}} a few high-frequency (shortwave) telex links. Often, government postal and telegraph services (PTTs) initiated these radio links. The most common radio standard, CCITT R.44 had error-corrected retransmitting time-division multiplexing of radio channels. Most impoverished PTTs operated their telex-on-radio (TOR) channels non-stop, to get the maximum value from them.|$|R
50|$|The Tent City (also Golden City) {{was planned}} by the Parisian interior-design firm of Maison Jansen on 160 acre and took its {{inspiration}} from the meeting between Francis I of France and Henry VIII of England at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520. Fifty 'tents' (actually prefabricated luxury apartments with traditional Persian tent-cloth surrounds) were arranged in a star pattern around a central fountain, and vast numbers of trees were planted around them in the desert, recreating something of how the ancient Persepolis would have looked. Each tent had direct telephone and <b>telex</b> <b>connections</b> back to its respective country and the whole celebration was televised to the world {{by way of a}} satellite connection from the site.|$|R
5000|$|In August 1968, Sayle {{was sent}} to Prague to cover the Warsaw Pact {{invasion}} of Czechoslovakia. Fellow journalist Harold Jackson has written of Sayle's ingenuity in getting their stories out of the country. International telephone calls were blocked, and the Russians had seized the Prague telex exchange. Sayle and Jackson discovered {{that not all of}} the <b>telex</b> <b>connections</b> were blocked and spent 13 hours dialling [...] "the 10,000 possibilities" [...] to find a working telex code. After discovering several working exchanges, Jackson recalled that the enterprising Sayle sold the numbers to other journalists at [...] "$100 a pop." [...] Another obstacle facing the foreign press in Prague was a shortage of Czech crowns. Sayle took Jackson with him {{to the office of the}} Czech firm responsible for distribution of The Times in Czechoslovakia. Sayle claimed to be the publisher's personal representative and demanded that the man turn over funds that had not been remitted due to exchange restrictions. Jackson recalled, [...] "We left the building with huge packs of Czech crowns stashed in a linen bag rustled up from some cupboard. They kept the foreign press corps functioning for weeks, no doubt at a suitable rate of exchange." ...|$|R
