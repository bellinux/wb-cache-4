The best known are Description of the Kingdom of Georgia (completed in 1745), The Geographic Description of Georgia (completed in 1750) and two geographic atlases of the Caucasus region accompanied by the images of several historic coats of arms (1745-46). His famous Description of the Kingdom of Georgia is essentially an adorned synopsis of the initial texts of the corpus of medieval Georgian annals, Kartlis Tskhovreba. Vakhushti was critical of the re-edition of <b>the</b> <b>corpus</b> <b>assembled</b> by a scholarly commission chaired by his father Vakhtang VI. So as to rectify perceived oversights of Vakhtang's version, Vakhushti compiled his own comprehensive history and geographical description of the Georgian people and lands. One of the chief goals of his corrective was to underscore all-Georgian political and cultural unity {{despite the fact that}} Georgia was politically divided among competing kings and princes during Vakhushti’s lifetime. The popularity of Vakhushti’s tome is evidenced by the many copies made of it, and his narrative significantly shaped the way in which subsequent generations have conceived of an all-Georgian past. It is also a major source on the Georgian history of the 16th and 17th centuries.|$|E

The majority of Vi-En and Vi-Cs bitexts are subtitles from movies and television series. The nature of the bitexts are paraphrasing of each other's meaning, rather than translations. - TED talks, {{a collection of short}} talks on various topics, given primarily in English, transcribed and with transcripts translated to other languages. In our corpus, we use 1198 talks which had English and Vietnamese transcripts available and 784 talks which had Czech and Vietnamese transcripts available in January 2015. The size of <b>the</b> original <b>corpora</b> collected from OPUS and TED talks is as follows: 	CS/VI 	EN/VI Sentence 	 1337199 / 1337199 	 2035624 / 2035624 Word 	 9128897 / 12073975 	 16638364 / 17565580 		 Unique word	 224416 / 68237 	 91905 / 78333 We improve the quality of <b>the</b> <b>corpora</b> in two steps: normalizing and filtering. In the normalizing step, <b>the</b> <b>corpora</b> are cleaned based on the general format of subtitles and transcripts. For instance, sequences of dots indicate explicit continuation of subtitles across multiple time frames. The sequences of dots are distributed differently in the source and the target side. Removing the sequence of dots, along with a number of other normalization rules, improves the quality of the alignment significantly. In the filtering step, we adapt the CzEng filtering tool [1] to filter out bad sentence pairs. The size of cleaned corpora as published is as follows: 	CS/VI 	EN/VI Sentence 	 1091058 / 1091058 	 1113177 / 1091058 Word 	 6718184 / 7646701 	 8518711 / 8140876 Unique word	 195446 / 59737 	 69513 / 58286 <b>The</b> <b>corpora</b> are used as training data in [2].

40|$|This project {{presents}} and analyses {{all of the}} signet rings and intaglios so far unearthed in Roman Britain to reinterpret how they were used and their role within provincial society. These small artefacts have traditionally been regarded as attractive but relatively insignificant minor objets d’art, with little relevance to the wider discourses of Romanists. This thesis attempts a more critical examination of how they were used and their role within provincial Roman society. I argue that signet rings were an essential element in provincial society that should no longer be overlooked. This project builds on <b>the</b> pioneering <b>Corpus</b> <b>assembled</b> by Martin Henig in the 1970 s, including more recent discoveries and more than doubling the material available to him. This combined body of evidence includes 2, 012 signet rings and intaglios, {{making it one of}} the largest contextualised assemblages of these objects ever studied. It also benefits from the results of developer funded archaeology and the advent of recording by the Portable Antiquities Scheme, enabling us to create a richer and more detailed picture how they were used. My approach has been to resituate these objects in terms of the archaeological context in which they were found, but also to consider them as functional as well as decorative objects. When studied in this way signet rings provide a unique perspective on the identity of their wearers, and how they wanted to present themselves to others. I have found growing evidence for the use of signet rings amongst local elites before the Roman invasion of Britain, and it is clear that they had a role to play in negotiating identity after the conquest. I have also been able to identify trends in the way that different communities used signet rings, both as regards their imagery and materiality. It is also apparent that in some parts of Britain these objects remained a feature of a type of dress and the hallmark of a society that remained alien to their inhabitants throughout the Roman period. However, for those who chose to wear them, signet rings could be more than just objects but reflections of themselves...|$|R

40|$|Corpus {{linguistics}} {{approaches are}} more and more often exploited in the study of specialised languages (Bowker and Pearson 2002) and corpora have proven to be invaluable tools in the identification and analysis of specific genres, domains and discourses. Keywords, collocates and clusters have become key concepts in both language research and teaching, particularly so in the teaching of LSP (Gavioli 2005). The present study aims at contributing to the debate on the criteria used in corpus planning, gathering and assembling by focusing on the comparison between a set of existing large specialised <b>corpora,</b> <b>assembled</b> for various research projects: <b>the</b> CorDis <b>corpus</b> (conceived as representative of the 2003 conflict in Iraq, Morley and Bayley 2009), <b>the</b> IntUne <b>corpus</b> (Williams and Bayley forhcoming) and <b>the</b> WHoB <b>corpus</b> (Venuti et al 2009).

40|$|My {{research}} is centred around Silent Era films adapted from {{nineteenth and early}} twentieth century Gothic literature with a special emphasis on the figure of the monster and its translation from literary to cinematic form. <b>The</b> <b>corpus</b> I have <b>assembled</b> {{for the purposes of this}} analysis comprises sixty-six films made in ten different countries between 1897 and 1929. Many of these films are considered lost and I have endeavored to reconstruct them as much as possible using materials located in film archives. The Introduction lays out the ground covered in the thesis and provides a working definition of ‘monstrosity’ in this context. The first chapter deals with the historical, economic, cultural, social and technological contexts of the films under discussion. The second chapter approaches the eight literary monster figures who form the core of this thesis through the lens of Adaptation Theory. The third chapter examines the elements of cinematic language that were particularly relevant to translating monster characters and Gothic literary narratives into silent film, placing this <b>corpus</b> into <b>the</b> context of silent film history and theory. The fourth chapter reviews a cross-section of intermedial systems of classification that have been applied to monster figures, and proposes a new system that would reflect the multifarious nature of the silent film Gothic literary monster. Chapters Five through Nine offer a theoretical framework for classifying the principal characteristics of the silent film Gothic monster by applying various philosophical and aesthetic concepts. The final chapter summarises the material presented in earlier chapters and offers relevant conclusions demonstrating how these films employ the unique characteristics, conventions, and limitations of the silent film medium in their representations of the Gothic literary monster...|$|R
