40|$|RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extension for a <b>Third-Party</b> <b>Loss</b> Report In a large RTP session {{using the}} RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) {{feedback}} mechanism defined in RFC 4585, a feedback target may experience transient overload if some event causes {{a large number}} of receivers to send feedback at once. This overload is usually avoided by ensuring that feedback reports are forwarded to all receivers, allowing them to avoid sending duplicate feedback reports. However, there are cases where it is not recommended to forward feedback reports, and this may allow feedback implosion. This memo discusses these cases and defines a new RTCP <b>Third-Party</b> <b>Loss</b> Report {{that can be used to}} inform receivers that the feedback target is aware of some loss event, allowing them to suppress feedback. Associated Session Description Protocol (SDP) signaling is also defined. Status of This Memo This is an Internet Standards Track document. This document is a product of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). It represents the consensus of the IETF community. It has received public review and has been approved for publication by th...|$|E
40|$|This report {{provides}} {{an answer to}} the question of whether negative or positive financial consequences which were intended to stimulate drivers to be involved in fewer accidents really cause fewer accidents. The research question was worded as follows: what are the effects of financial stimuli on reported damages? Two groups of insured motorists were compared: one group insured according to a no-claim bonus system, and one group who was not insured according to a no-claim bonus system. From the claims data made available by the Association of Dutch Insurers, a selection was made in order to create the two groups. Injury accidents were excluded from the analysis. The analysis was conducted in three steps: (1) An analysis of the claim amounts made to investigate the similarity of the groups showed no marked differences between the two; (2) A paired comparison was based on groups differing only in insurance policy; and (3) a comparison was made based on individual policies by applying a generalised linear model. The most important conclusion from this analysis was that it is not true that a no-claim bonus arrangement generally causes fewer reported claims and/or less <b>third-party</b> <b>loss.</b> (A...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The Law and Economics {{perspective}} on injunctive relief {{has been developed}} primarily from the Calabresi and Melamed (1972) distinction between property rules and liability rules, two different judicial means of enforcing legal rights. Their analysis is predicated on the assumption that, if the prevention of the unlawful activity by an injunction does not reach the efficient solution between the relevant parties, then the latter can modify {{the terms of the}} injunction by means of bilateral negotiation, drawing on Coase’s social basic analysis. The approach is particularly important once it is appreciated that legal entitlements are imperfectly formulated and that, in appropriate circumstances, legal wrongdoing can increase social welfare. For example, in areas where intellectual property rights are particularly difficult to formulate because of the high technology involved, too rigid an enforcement of those imperfectly targeted rights generates welfare losses. The task for economic analysis is then to determine whether injunctive relief or damages is preferable in the particular circumstances governing the parties’ activities. This largely involves comparing on the one hand the welfare losses which arise from imperfect damages award which arise predominantly where the court has high information costs in assessing the plaintiff’s losses (particularly where those losses are subjective and therefore cannot be determined by reference to market evaluation) or include irrecoverable <b>third-party</b> <b>losses</b> with, on the other hand, the transaction costs of negotiating a compromise solution or the welfare losses arising from a holdout (both conditions are likely where more than two parties are involved). One branch of the literature has added a new dimension to this analysis. It is concerned to explore how the choice of remedy ex post affects behaviour ex ante, in particular the propensity to invest. In addition, literature on optimal enforcement provides insights regarding the optimal timing of sanctions, which is relevant for the choice between injunctions (the first possible stage of legal intervention) and damages (the last possible stage) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} nexus between product markets and the legal system. We examine a model wherein oligopolists produce {{differentiated}} products that also have a safety attribute. Consumption of these products may lead to harm (to consumers and/or third parties), lawsuits, and compensation, either via settlement or trial. Firm-level costs reflect both R&D and production activities, as well as liability-related costs. Compensation is incomplete, both because of inefficiencies in the bargaining process and (possibly) because of statutorily-established limits on awards. We compare the market equilibrium safety effort and output levels to what a planner would choose. We consider two planners, {{one of whom is}} able to set safety standards, but takes the market equilibrium output as given, and one of whom can control both safety effort and output. We argue that the former type of planner is the better representative of what the tort system might do if faced with deciding upon a safety effort standard. We examine two measures of competitiveness: the number of firms, and the degree of substitutability of the products. Holding substitutability constant, {{an increase in the number}} of firms always reduces equilibrium safety effort. On the other hand, holding the number of firms constant, increasing substitutability first decreases, but ultimately increases, the equilibrium safety effort. Non-cooperative firms under-provide safety effort (relative to the restricted social planner¼s preferred level) when the products are relatively poor substitutes. However, when the products are sufficiently good substitutes, the non-cooperative firms over-provide safety effort. Moreover, the more firms there are in the industry, the less substitutable their products need to be in order for the equilibrium to result in over-provision of safety effort. Under-provision of safety becomes more typical as the rate of third-party exposure increases or as the amount of <b>third-party</b> uncompensated <b>losses</b> increases. Finally, we use the settlement subgame to examine the effects of alternative tort reform policies on the equilibrium provision of safety and welfare. In the presence of third-party victims, welfare can be increased even though changes in such policies may increase expected trial costs. Liability, oligopoly, safety, social optimality, torts...|$|R
40|$|In {{determining}} premiums in {{non-life insurance}} {{there is no}} universal method. In this paper is applied Bühlmann-Straub model for determining credible premium in <b>third-party</b> vehicle insurance. <b>Loss</b> ratio is the ratio of total losses incurred in claims divided by the total premiums earned. This is an indicator of how well an insurance company is doing. This ratio reflects if companies are collecting premiums higher than the amount paid in claims {{or if it is}} not collecting enough premiums to cover claims. Loss ratios for vehicle insurance usually range from 40 % to 60 %. Companies that have high loss claims may be experiencing financial trouble. The overall loss ratio in the Slovak market of third-party vehicle insurance in 2011 increased slightly to 57. 13 %. High loss ratio showed AXA – 83. 21 %, Generali – 69. 41 % and KOOPERATIVA VIG – 65. 69 %. These three together have insurance in 2011, a significant proportion of insurance in the Slovak Republic, to 45. 06 %. These facts are the reason why we decided to assess the adequacy of the insurance premium in seven companies which in 2011 had a market share of 94. 35 % in the Slovak insurance market. Credible premium is determined as a linear combination of premiums, determined from the data on their own risk and premium determined on the basis of information from similar risks. Credible premium is a compromise between the individual premium, i. e. premium determined solely from its own data on the risk premium and the collective, determined from data on collective risk. The credibility factor takes the value from 0 to 1 and expresses credibility of own experience. The highest credibility factor is in Allianz-SP and KOOPERATIVA VIG, which had the highest market share vehicle insurance and thus most of their own data on claims...|$|R
