When Rose attempts <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> Jackie she is rebuked for overstepping her bounds. Suddenly the party is interrupted by the Cybermen, who smash {{into the house and}} surround the guests. Lumic calls the President, who is in attendance, telling him that he is moving forward with his plans and that all of humanity will be upgraded. Lumic tells everyone that upgrading is compulsory and that anyone who refuses will be deleted. The President refuses to be upgraded and is killed by a Cyberman. The partygoers panic, try to flee and the Cybermen begin killing them. The Doctor, Rose, and Pete escape the house and encounter Mickey and the Preachers outside. They try firing upon the advancing Cybermen with automatic rifles, but their bullets do no damage and soon they are surrounded. The Doctor tells everyone to surrender and tells the Cybermen that they are volunteering for the upgrade. The Cybermen tell them that they are incompatible and will be deleted. The episode ends with the Cybermen advancing on them.|$|E
25|$|Allegations of {{cheating}} reignited at the French Grand Prix, when, starting from {{third on the}} grid Schumacher overtook both of the Williams drivers, Damon Hill and Nigel Mansell, leading into the first corner of the race. This raised suspicions, once again, that Benetton were using traction control. There were also incidents involving other teams, notably Ferrari and McLaren. While commentating on the race for Eurosport with John Watson and Allard Kalff, Williams driver David Coulthard, who was replaced by Mansell for the race, stated that Schumacher's start {{reminded him of the}} type of starts from the 1993 season when traction control was legal. Hill was on pole position for the British Grand Prix after qualifying fastest. During the parade lap {{on the way to the}} starting grid, Schumacher, starting second, illegally overtook Hill. As a result of his illegal maneuver, Schumacher was given a five-second penalty at 14:27 local time, 27minutes after the original incident. Schumacher never came into the pit lane to serve the penalty when originally given the penalty, and on lap21, Schumacher was given the black flag. Schumacher stayed out on the circuit while Benetton team boss Briatore, along with Benetton technical director Tom Walkinshaw went <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> Race Director Roland Bruynseraede, arguing that they had not been properly informed of the punishment given. Schumacher eventually served the time penalty on lap27, finishing the race in second position behind Hill.|$|E

500|$|According to {{sculptor}} Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, {{who later}} recounted the story, Laboulaye's comment {{was not intended}} as a proposal, but it inspired Bartholdi.

Bartholdi was in any event busy with other possible projects; in the late 1860s, he approached Isma'il Pasha, Khedive of Egypt, a plan to build Progress or Egypt Carrying the Light to Asia, a huge lighthouse {{in the form of}} an ancient Egyptian female fellah or peasant, robed and holding a torch aloft, at the northern entrance to the Suez Canal in Port Said. Sketches and models were made of the proposed work, though it was never erected.

Pegg was upset, and refused <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> journalists. After her departure, the single [...] "Whale" [...] was published on the Rough Trade Records label. The band had rushed to record it, having only been given a month's notice by the label that they would release on their songs in September 1994. Unlike Hooked, [...] "Whale" [...] was named the NME single of the week akin to For Tinkerbell. The band appeared in the mainstream press for two incidents, the first was when they were thrown off a train at Swindon as they were travelling to London after arguing with a train guard about punk rock, and the other when they swore at the bouncers in Welsh at the Underworld club in Camden and were banned. A further single, [...] "Bleed" [...] was recorded the following November, and was released in February 1995 on Nursery Records.

500|$|A {{day prior}} to his {{resignation}} from Congress, The Detroit News reported that after ending his presidential campaign, McCotter took to writing a television pilot he titled, [...] "Bumper Sticker: Made On Motown". It centered on McCotter as {{the host of a}} variety show with characters based on his congressional staffers, who made fun of his presidential campaign and discussed such risqué topics as sex, race, and bodily functions. In one scene in the script, S.E. Cupp guest stars; McCotter tries to conduct a serious interview with her, but the other characters make sexually explicit comments, leading Cupp to describe the show as a [...] "train wreck." [...] A former staffer released the work to the media to show what McCotter did while in office. In response, McCotter denied any wrongdoing, saying it had been largely composed in his garage {{as a way to get}} over his failed presidential campaign. He said the script was unfinished and had not authorized it for release, but decided <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> The News. He cited comedian Martin Mull's short-lived 1977 show Fernwood 2 Night as an inspiration, and revealed that he had planned to leave Congress in 2014 and was preparing for a future career.|$|E
500|$|It {{was when}} the Tenkaichi Budōkai martial arts tournament began that Dragon Ball truly became popular, having {{recalled}} the races and tournaments in Dr. Slump. Anticipating that readers would expect Goku to win the tournaments, Toriyama had him lose the first two while planning an eventual victory. He said that Muscle Tower in the Red Ribbon Army storyline {{was inspired by the}} video game Spartan X, in which enemies tended to appear very fast. He then created Piccolo Daimao as a truly evil villain, and as a result called that arc the most interesting to draw. Once Goku and company had become the strongest on Earth, they turned to extraterrestrial opponents including the Saiyans. Freeza, who forcibly took over planets to resell them, was created {{around the time of the}} Japanese economic bubble and was inspired by real estate speculators, whom Toriyama called the [...] "worst kind of people." [...] Finding the escalating enemies difficult, he created the Ginyu Force to add more balance to the series. He added time travel next, but said he had a hard time with it, only thinking of what to do that week and having <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> his second editor Yu Kondo. After Cell's death, Toriyama intended for Gohan to replace Goku as the series' protagonist, but felt the character was not suited for the role and changed his mind.|$|E

500|$|According to Davis, Sesame Streets second decade {{was spent}} [...] "turning inward, {{expanding}} its young viewers' world". [...] The show's curriculum grew {{to include more}} [...] "affective" [...] teaching—relationships, ethics, and positive and negative emotions. [...] Many of the show's storylines {{were taken from the}} experiences of its writing staff, cast, and crew. [...] In 1982, Will Lee, who had played Mr. Hooper since the show's premiere, died. [...] For the 1983 season, the show's producers and research staff decided they would explain Mr. Hooper's death to their preschool audience, instead of recasting the role: the writer of that episode, Norman Stiles, said, [...] "We felt we owed something to a man we respected and loved". [...] They convened a group of psychologists, religious leaders, and other experts in the field of grief, loss, and separation. [...] The research team conducted a series of studies before the episode to ascertain if children were able to understand the messages they wanted to convey about Mr. Hooper's death; the research showed most children did understand. [...] Parents' reactions to the episode were, according to the CTW's own reports, [...] "overwhelmingly positive". [...] The episode, which won an Emmy, aired on Thanksgiving Day in 1983 so parents could be home <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> their children. [...] Author David Borgenicht called the episode [...] "poignant"; Davis called it [...] "a landmark broadcast" [...] and [...] "a truly memorable episode, one of the show's best".

2500|$|Also in 1936, Crosby {{exercised}} an option from Paramount {{to make a film}} out-of-house. Quickly signed to a one-picture agreement with Columbia, Crosby dreamt of having his icon and friend Louis Armstrong, an African-American, who largely influenced his singing style, in a screen adaptation of The Peacock Feather called Pennies from Heaven.

Graduation relates to the strength of attitude (Martin and White 2005). Attitudinal feelings are expressed with the aim to be shared and with the expectation that the hearers/readers may sympathize or empathize with the speakers/writers (Martin 2002).
