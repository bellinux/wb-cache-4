5|$|In {{her first}} {{address to the}} legislature, Collins asked for an {{additional}} $324million from the Kentucky General Assembly, most of it allocated for education. The additional revenue was {{to be derived from}} Collins' proposed <b>tax</b> <b>package,</b> which included increasing the income tax on individuals making more than $15,000 annually, extending the sales tax to cover services such as auto repair and dry cleaning, and increasing the corporate licensing tax. After opposition to her proposal developed among legislators during the 1984 biennial legislative session, Collins revised the <b>tax</b> <b>package.</b> She retained the corporate licensing tax increase, but replaced the sales tax and income tax modifications with a flat five percent personal income tax and phasing out the deductions for depreciation which corporations could claim on their state taxes.|$|E
25|$|The <b>tax</b> <b>package</b> was {{met with}} mixed reviews. While she was praised widely by Democratic and Republican leaders of the House and Senate for her {{leadership}} skills regarding passing this deal, several state legislators disagreed with {{the merits of the}} tax because of the already high price of gas.

25|$|In 2004, Warner {{worked with}} Democratic and {{moderate}} Republican legislators {{and the business}} community to reform the tax code, lowering food and some income taxes while increasing the sales and cigarette taxes. His <b>tax</b> <b>package</b> effected a net tax increase of approximately $1.5 billion annually. Warner credited the additional revenues with saving the state's AAA bond rating, held at the time by only five other states, and allowing the single largest investment in K-12 education in Virginia history. Warner also entered into an agreement with Democrats and moderate Republicans in the Virginia Senate to cap state car tax reimbursements to local governments.|$|E

500|$|Biden campaigned heavily for Democrats in the 2010 midterm elections, {{maintaining}} {{an attitude of}} optimism {{in the face of}} general predictions of large-scale losses for the party. [...] Following large-scale Republican gains in the elections and the departure of White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, Biden's past relationships with Republicans in Congress became more important. [...] He led the successful administration effort to gain Senate approval for the New START treaty. [...] In December 2010, Biden's advocacy within the White House for a middle ground, followed by his direct negotiations with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, were instrumental in producing the administration's compromise <b>tax</b> <b>package</b> that revolved around a temporary extension of the Bush tax cuts.

This paper evaluates, by using a general equilibrium model, alternative instruments of indirect taxation in middle-income developing countries. It uses data for Thailand as an illustration and examines the effects of these instruments on revenue, efficiency, equity, and international competitiveness. The paper shows that the interaction between taxes and the distortions caused by various policies can be important for revenue and efficiency. It also reveals significant backward shifting and a link between outward-looking supply-side tax policies and trade policies in industrial countries. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze a <b>tax</b> reform <b>package</b> {{recently}} proposed in Cavaco Silva (1999). We {{do so in}} the context of a dynamic general-equilibrium model of the Portuguese economy and we focus on the efficiency, welfare, and tax revenue effects of this package. Simulation results suggest that the <b>tax</b> reform <b>package</b> would induce, over the next twenty-five years, a GDP gain of between 0. 36 % and 0. 89 %, depending on the design of the compensatory changes necessary to achieve deficit neutrality. The proposed compensatory hike in the VAT rates is, in itself, insufficient to ensure deficit neutrality. Nevertheless, the reduction in private consumption it would induce, would lead to a net welfare loss over the same time span. In this case, the <b>tax</b> reform <b>package</b> would improve efficiency at the cost of reducing welfare. If the whole package were financed exclusively through increased non-distortionary taxation or through reductions in public consumption, the welfare losses would be avoided and welfare gains of up to 0. 66 % could be generated. It could be argued, however, that under the current institutional constraints associated with the Stability and Growth Pact it is difficult to realistically design the financing mechanisms in a way that would avoid the efficiency-welfare trade-off. ...|$|R
