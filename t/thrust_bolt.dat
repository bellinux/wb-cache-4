50|$|<b>Bolt</b> <b>thrust</b> is an {{important}} factor in weapons design. The greater the <b>bolt</b> <b>thrust,</b> the stronger the locking mechanism has to be to withstand it. Assuming equal engineering solutions and material adding strength to a locking mechanism causes an increase in weight and size of locking mechanism components.|$|R

50|$|<b>Bolt</b> <b>thrust</b> is not {{a measure}} to {{determine}} the amount of recoil/free recoil.|$|R
50|$|With a basic {{calculation}} the <b>bolt</b> <b>thrust</b> {{produced by}} a particular firearms cartridge can be calculated fairly accurately.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>bolt</b> <b>thrust</b> of the [...]303 British is {{relatively}} {{low compared to}} many other service rounds used in the early 20th century.|$|R
50|$|By oiling proof rounds during NATO EPVAT testing procedures, NATO test centers {{intentionally}} {{lower case}} friction to promote high <b>bolt</b> <b>thrust</b> levels.|$|R
60|$|Two hours sawing {{across the}} grating of the window, ridded {{him of his}} {{handcuffs}}. Next came the door, secured luckily with only a hasp and padlock. <b>Thrusting</b> the <b>bolt</b> of his handcuffs through a small window in the door, he succeeded in forcing the hasp and regaining his liberty about {{three o'clock in the}} morning.|$|R
50|$|Instead {{of using}} the {{internal}} case head diameter, the external case head base diameter can also be measured with a caliper or micrometer or taken from the appropriate C.I.P. or SAAMI cartridge or chamber data tables and used for <b>bolt</b> <b>thrust</b> estimation calculations.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} PK was {{a development}} of Kalashnikov's AKM assault rifle {{and the accompanying}} RPK light machine gun design that featured stamped receivers. The PK uses the 7.62×54mmR Eastern Bloc standard cartridge that produces significantly more <b>bolt</b> <b>thrust</b> {{when compared to the}} Eastern Bloc 7.62×39mm and 5.45×39mm intermediate cartridges.|$|R
5000|$|A complicating matter {{regarding}} <b>bolt</b> <b>thrust</b> {{is that a}} {{cartridge case}} expands and deforms under high pressure and starts to [...] "stick" [...] to the chamber. This [...] "friction-effect" [...] can be accounted for with finite elements calculations on a computer, {{but it is a}} lot of specialized work and generally not worth the trouble.|$|R
5000|$|During {{a service}} life of over 70 {{years with the}} British Commonwealth armed forces the [...]303-inch {{cartridge}} in its ball pattern progressed through ten marks which eventually extended {{to a total of}} about 26 variations.The <b>bolt</b> <b>thrust</b> of the [...]303 British is relatively low compared to many other service rounds used in the early 20th century.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bolt</b> <b>thrust</b> or breech {{pressure}} {{is a term}} used in internal ballistics and firearms (whether small arms or artillery) that describes the amount of rearward force exerted by the propellant gases on the bolt or breech of a firearm action or breech when a projectile is fired. The applied force has both magnitude and direction, making it a vector quantity.|$|R
5000|$|Besides {{enhanced}} penetration capabilities, these overpressure variants offer a flatter trajectory and lessened recoil. The {{increase in}} service pressure causes {{a rise in}} <b>bolt</b> <b>thrust,</b> so {{the use of this}} overpressure ammunition induces more stress on critical weapon parts during firing. After initial research, conducted since the late 1980s under the codename [...] "Grach", the Russian armed forces adopted two specialized 9×19mm variants.|$|R
2500|$|The large boltface {{combined}} with the maximum pressure means that the [...]338 Lapua Magnum should only be chambered in rifles {{that are capable of}} handling such large high pressure cartridges and thus high <b>bolt</b> <b>thrust</b> safely. Chambering such powerful super magnum cartridges in rifles intended for normal magnum rifle cartridges and using high pressure loads can cause serious or fatal injury to the shooter and bystanders.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{semi-automatic}} rifles firing [...]22 LR cartridges {{will often}} only work properly when firing standard or high velocity rimfire ammunition, as the low recoil of subsonic rounds {{is insufficient to}} cycle the weapon's action. Rifles with manual actions do not have this problem. Due to the low <b>bolt</b> <b>thrust</b> of the [...]22 LR cartridge, most self-loading firearms chambered for the cartridge use the direct blowback operation system.|$|R
30|$|The process {{capability}} studies on <b>thrust</b> face thickness, <b>bolt</b> hole center distance and crank pin bore diameter critical-to-quality characteristics of connecting rod were performed. After making the process capable through DMAIC approach, the end {{results of these}} {{process capability}} studies {{in the form of}} process capability values and tolerances obtained from tolerance charting of connecting rod machining process are compared with a tolerance capability expert software (Tec-ease.com 2014) and the results are documented.|$|R
50|$|This {{method is}} fine for {{getting a good}} {{estimate}} regarding <b>bolt</b> <b>thrust</b> and assumes an overly large area that the gas pressure acts against yielding pessimistic estimations, generating a safety margin in the process for worse case scenarios which can result in increased maximum (peak) chamber pressure of the firearms cartridge, like a round that is chambered in an already very warm chamber that can result in cooking off (i.e. a thermally induced unintended firing).|$|R
5000|$|It {{operates}} {{at a relatively}} low maximum chamber pressure rating of 21,000 psi (145 MPa) (compared to 35,000 psi/241 MPa for 9mm Parabellum and [...]40 S&W, 37,500 psi/259 MPa for 10mm Auto, 40,000 psi/276 MPa for [...]357 SIG), which due to a low <b>bolt</b> <b>thrust</b> helps extend service life of weapons {{in which it is}} used. Some makers of pistols chambered in [...]45 ACP do not certify them to use Plus P ammunition.|$|R
5000|$|The 5.45×39mm is {{an example}} of an {{international}} tendency towards relatively small-sized, lightweight, high-velocity military service cartridges. Cartridges like the 5.45×39mm, 5.56×45mm NATO and Chinese 5.8×42mm allow a soldier to carry more ammunition for the same weight compared to their larger and heavier predecessor cartridges, have favourable maximum point-blank range or [...] "battle zero" [...] characteristics and produce relatively low <b>bolt</b> <b>thrust</b> and free recoil impulse, favouring lightweight arms design and automatic fire accuracy.|$|R
25|$|The {{addition}} of a bolt accelerator to the Lahti pistol was to ensure {{the performance of the}} pistol in arctic conditions in Finland. Bolt accelerators are more commonly found in machine guns to increase the rate of fire. The bolt accelerator in the Lahti works by having a crank lever strike the bolt of the pistol as it unlocks from firing. This <b>thrusts</b> the <b>bolt</b> mechanically instead of relying on the momentum of firing alone to move the bolt back. The value of the {{addition of}} the bolt accelerator was put into question with a batch of guns made without an accelerator being produced. The immediate recall of the pistols without bolt accelerators is thought to indicate the accelerator is not essential but useful in the operation of the gun.|$|R
60|$|Having {{delivered}} {{this home}} <b>thrust</b> Hans <b>bolted</b> round {{a corner and}} disappeared, while I waited trembling {{to see what happened}} to his adversary. To my relief nearly a minute later he crept out of the sluit covered with mud and dripping with water and hobbled off slowly down the street, his head so near his feet that he looked as though he had been folded in two, and his hands pressed upon what I believe is medically known as the diaphragm. Then I also went upon my way roaring with laughter. Often I have heard Hottentots called the lowest of mankind, but, reflected I, they can at any rate be good friends to those who treat them well--a fact of which I was to have further proof ere long.|$|R
5000|$|The 5.8×42mm is {{an example}} of an {{international}} tendency towards relatively small sized, light weight, high velocity military service cartridges. Cartridges like the American 5.56×45mm NATO, Soviet 5.45×39mm and 5.8×42mm allow a soldier to carry more ammunition for the same weight compared to their larger and heavier predecessor cartridges, have favourable maximum point-blank range or [...] "battle zero" [...] characteristics and produce relatively low <b>bolt</b> <b>thrust</b> and free recoil impulse, favouring light weight arms design and automatic fire accuracy.|$|R
5000|$|The {{advantage}} to this round is the ballistics are {{nearly identical to}} the [...]300 Winchester Magnum, but in a lighter rifle with a shorter action. A disadvantage of cartridge case designs with relatively large case head diameters lies in relatively high <b>bolt</b> <b>thrust</b> levels exerted on the locking mechanism of the employed firearm. Also in small ring actions the larger chamber diameter removes more steel from the barrel tenon making it weaker in a radial direction [...]|$|R
50|$|In German {{military}} service the Patrone 88 was replaced in 1904 and 1905 by the S Patrone. As the <b>bolt</b> <b>thrust</b> of the 7.92×57mm Mauser is relatively {{low compared to}} many other service rounds used in the early 20th century, many arms originally chambered for the Patrone 88 could and were adapted for chambering the S Patrone by reaming out metal from the chamber as it required a wider chamber throat to take the differently shaped and thicker brass of the new S Patrone.|$|R
5000|$|Relatively small sized, light weight, high {{velocity}} military service cartridges like the 5.45×39mm allow a soldier to carry more ammunition {{for the same}} weight compared to their larger and heavier predecessor cartridges, have favourable maximum point-blank range or [...] "battle zero" [...] characteristics and produce relatively low <b>bolt</b> <b>thrust</b> and free recoil impulse, favouring light weight arms design and automatic fire accuracy. Tests measured the free recoil energy delivered by the 5.45×39mm AK-74 rifle at , compared to [...] delivered by the 7.62×39mm in the AKM.|$|R
50|$|The 9×18mm Makarov round was {{designed}} by B.V. Semin in 1946, and {{was intended to be}} a relatively powerful round with modest <b>bolt</b> <b>thrust</b> that could function safely in a simple or direct blowback pistol. It was based on the 9×18mm Ultra cartridge which was developed in 1936 by Gustav Genschow & Co. for the German Luftwaffe, as a more powerful alternative to the 9×17mm used in the Walther PP, also a simple blowback design pistol. Nikolay Fyodorovich Makarov went on to design the Makarov PM pistol around the 9×18mm Makarov round in 1948.|$|R
5000|$|The [...]223 Remington {{cartridge}} inspired {{an international}} tendency towards relatively small-sized, lightweight, high-velocity military service cartridges that allow a soldier to carry more ammunition {{for the same}} weight compared to their larger and heavier predecessor cartridges, have favourable maximum point-blank range or [...] "battle zero" [...] characteristics and produce relatively low <b>bolt</b> <b>thrust</b> and free recoil impulse, favouring lightweight arms design and automatic fire accuracy. Similar intermediate cartridges were developed and adopted by the Soviet Union in 1974 (5.45×39mm) and by the People's Republic of China in 1987 (5.8×42mm).|$|R
5000|$|Since the 1960s NATO, the (former) Warsaw Pact, the People's Republic of China, {{and other}} {{countries}} adapted relatively small sized, light weight, high velocity military intermediate service cartridges {{in the form of}} the 5.56×45mm NATO, Soviet 5.45×39mm, and Chinese 5.8×42mm.

50|$|By {{returning}} alive from Soissons, {{and reporting}} the treachery of the English knight Sir Roger Pallaire, who conspired with the French and sacrificed his own archers, Hook earns good stead {{with his new}} lord, Sir John Cornewaille, and with King Henry V. Hook returns to France serving under Cornewaille with the royal army to win Henry the crown of France. The campaign starts horrendously with the siege of the port of Harfleur. The town's capture takes too many weeks, and disease decimates Henry's army. During a failed attack, Hook kills Robert Perrill by <b>thrusting</b> a crossbow <b>bolt</b> through the man's eye.|$|R
2500|$|This for rifles {{very high}} maximum allowed chamber {{pressure}} level {{indicates that the}} cases of the [...]300 and [...]338 Lapua Magnum are built extremely sturdy {{to cope with this}} for rifles very high operating pressure. The large boltface combined with the high 470 MPa (68,000 PSI) maximum pressure makes that the [...]300 Lapua Magnum should only be chambered in rifles that are capable of handling such large and fierce cartridges and thus high <b>bolt</b> <b>thrust</b> safely. Chambering such powerful super magnum cartridges in rifles intended for normal magnum rifle cartridges and using 470 MPa (68,000 PSI) loads can cause serious or fatal injury to the shooter and bystanders.|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} orthopedic (orthotic) {{arm joint}} {{that can be}} used in various joint of mechanical arms is described. The arm joints includes a worm, which is coupled to an electric motor for rotating a worm gear carried within a rotatable housing. The worm gear is supported on a thrust bearing and the rotatable housing is supported on a radial <b>thrust</b> bearing. A <b>bolt</b> extends through the housing, bearings, and worm gear for securing the device together.

5000|$|Most [...]40 S&W pistols can be {{converted}} to [...]357 SIG by replacing the barrel, but sometimes the recoil spring must be changed as well. Pistols with especially strong recoil springs can accept either cartridge with a barrel change. Magazines will freely interchange between the two cartridges in most pistols[...]357 SIG barrel kits have allowed this cartridge to gain in popularity among handgun owners. However, the [...]357 SIG is loaded to higher pressures than the [...]40 S&W (the C.I.P. and the SAAMI pressure limits for [...]40 S&W are 225 MPa and 35,000 psi), and may not be suitable for use in all [...]40 S&W-chambered pistols due to the increase in <b>bolt</b> <b>thrust.</b>|$|R
5000|$|This for rifles {{very high}} maximum allowed chamber {{pressure}} level {{indicates that the}} cases of the [...]300 and [...]338 Lapua Magnum and 7.62mm UKM are built extremely sturdy {{to cope with this}} for rifles very high operating pressure.

2500|$|Due to the {{relatively}} low <b>bolt</b> <b>thrust</b> of the [...]380 ACP cartridge, the locked-breech design of the Glock 19 and Glock 26 was minimally modified for the Glock 25 and Glock 28 to implement unlocked breech operation. [...] It operates via straight blowback of the slide. This required modification of the locking surfaces on the barrel, {{as well as a}} redesign of the former locking block. [...] Unusual for a blowback design, the barrel is not fixed to the frame. [...] It moves rearward in recoil until it is tilted below the slide, similar to the standard locked-breech system. [...] The reduced size and mass of the Glock 42 required return to the Glock-standard locked-breech design.|$|R
2500|$|In 1998, {{the frame}} was further {{modified}} with an accessory rail (called the [...] "Universal Glock rail") {{to allow the}} mounting of laser sights, tactical lights, and other accessories. Thumb rests {{on both sides of}} the frame and finger grooves on the front strap were added. Glock pistols with these upgrades are informally referred to as (early) [...] "third-generation" [...] models. Later third-generation models additionally featured a modified extractor that serves as a loaded chamber indicator, and the locking block was enlarged, along with the addition of an extra cross pin to aid the distribution of <b>bolt</b> <b>thrust</b> forces exerted by the locking block. This cross pin is known as the locking block pin and is located above the trigger pin.|$|R
