5|$|An {{indication}} of the army's high esteem for barbarian-born troops is that <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been preferentially recruited to the elite units of the late imperial era's armies. In the auxilia palatina infantry regiments, the proportion of barbarians in the ranks appears to have numbered anywhere between a third {{and a half of}} effectives (compared to a quarter in the army as a whole). From the late 3rd century onwards, barbarian recruitment became crucial to the army's continued existence, by providing a much-needed source of first-rate recruits.|$|E
5|$|From about 700 BCE iron working reached north Britain. There is {{evidence}} for about 1,000 Iron Age hillforts in Scotland, most located below the Clyde-Forth line. The majority are circular, {{with a single}} palisade around an enclosure. <b>They</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been largely abandoned in the Roman period, both in the occupied region and further north in the regions beyond Roman control. This may have been because of {{the threat posed by}} Roman incursions, which meant that concentrations of military and political force were vulnerable to incursions and siege. Archaeological evidence indicates that some were reoccupied after their departure.|$|E

5|$|Hymenoptera in {{the form}} of Symphyta (Xyelidae) first {{appeared}} in the fossil record in the Lower Triassic. Apocrita, wasps in the broad sense, appeared in the Jurassic, and had diversified into many of the extant superfamilies by the Cretaceous; <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> evolved from the Symphyta. Fig wasps with modern anatomical features first appeared in the Lower Cretaceous of the Crato Formation in Brazil, some 65 million years before the first fig trees.|$|E
5|$|Through {{observation}} of the light curves of many Type Ia supernovae, {{it was discovered that}} <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a common peak luminosity. By measuring the luminosity of these events, the distance to their host galaxy can be estimated with good accuracy. Thus this category of supernovae has become highly useful as a standard candle for measuring cosmic distances. In 1998, the High-Z Supernova Search and the Supernova Cosmology Project discovered that the most distant Type Ia supernovae appeared dimmer than expected. This has provided evidence that {{the expansion of the universe}} may be accelerating.|$|E
5|$|An early-war Army {{anti-aircraft}} company (Flugabwehr-Kompanie) {{was organized}} in three platoons {{with a total}} of eighteen Sd.Kfz. 10/4s, twelve with guns and six carrying ammunition. When the four-barrel 2 cm Flakvierling 38 was fielded in 1941 each platoon had four Sd.Kfz. 10/4s towing the guns and another for ammunition. Later these companies were reorganized {{with a total of}} eight Sd.Kfz. 10/4s carrying guns, two towing Flakvierlings and three carrying ammunition. These are just examples of some of the Army organizations which differed depending on the unit and the period. Sd.Kfz. 10/5s were substituted for 10/4s on a one for one basis. Detailed records do not survive for the Luftwaffe light anti-aircraft units, but <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been organized into batteries of nine or twelve guns.|$|E

5000|$|Their phylogenetic {{position}} was originally unclear, because <b>they</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> both prokaryote-like traits, such as binary fission, and eukaryote-like traits, such as intracellular membranes. However, molecular phylogenetics showed {{that they are}} actually bacteria from the phylum Verrucomicrobia.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{its large}} size, the overall {{appearance}} of Deinosuchus was not considerably {{different from that}} of modern crocodilians. Deinosuchus had an alligator-like, broad snout, with a slightly bulbous tip. Each premaxilla contained four teeth, with the pair nearest to the tip of the snout being significantly smaller than the other two. Each maxilla (the main tooth-bearing bone in the upper jaw) contained 21 or 22teeth. The tooth count for each dentary (tooth-bearing bone in the lower jaw) was at least 22. All the teeth were very thick and robust; those close {{to the rear of the}} jaws were short, rounded, and blunt. <b>They</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been adapted for crushing, rather than piercing. When the mouth was closed, only the fourth tooth of the lower jaw would have been visible.|$|E
5|$|Elephants have a fissionâ€“fusion {{society in}} which {{multiple}} family groups come together to socialise. Males ("bulls") leave their family groups when they reach puberty and may live alone or with other males. Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate and enter a state of increased testosterone and aggression known as musth, which helps them gain dominance and reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers {{for as long as}} three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight, smell, and sound; elephants use infrasound, and seismic communication over long distances. Elephant intelligence has been compared with that of primates and cetaceans. <b>They</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> self-awareness and show empathy for dying or dead individuals of their kind.|$|E
5|$|Human {{activities}} have had {{positive effects on}} some species of cockatoo and negative effects on others. Many species of open country have benefited greatly from anthropogenic changes to the landscape, with the great increase in reliable seed food sources, available water and have also adapted well to a diet including foreign foodstuffs. This benefit appears to be restricted to Australian species, as cockatoos favouring open country outside Australia have not become more abundant. Predominantly forest-dwelling species have suffered greatly from habitat destruction; in the main, <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a more specialised diet and {{have not been able}} to incorporate exotic food into their diet. A notable exception is the yellow-tailed black cockatoo in eastern Australia.|$|E

2500|$|The {{volatile}} {{situation was}} attributed {{to the lack of}} consultation with the family and community combined with the premature public release of the autopsy report. <b>They</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> jumped <b>to</b> a conclusion given their description of the death as [...] "cold blooded murder".|$|R
60|$|The {{people were}} very jovial, and rather industrious for so {{indolent}} a country. The land was their own, the men tended the cattle, of which <b>they</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a large number, while the women made cheeses, rising before daylight to milk the cows.|$|R
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the significant lack of genetic diversity in cheetahs is a cause of poor quality and production of sperm, and birth defects such as cramped teeth, kinked tails, and bent limbs. Cheetahs do have low fertility rates, but <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> flourished for thousands of years with these low levels of genetic variance. Cheetah expert Laurie Marker points out that the high level of genetic uniformity would mean that if an infectious disease surfaced in a population, all of them have (or lack) the same level of immunity. In 1982, 60% of the cheetah population in the Wildlife Safari (Oregon, United States) died due to a peritonitis epidemic.|$|E
5|$|Little {{literary}} evidence survives of {{the activities}} of the gladiatorial training and fighting (ludi). <b>They</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> followed the standard format of the Roman games: animal entertainments in the morning session, followed by the executions of criminals around midday, with the afternoon session reserved for gladiatorial combats and recreations of famous battles. The animal entertainments, which featured creatures from throughout the Roman Empire, included extravagant hunts and fights between different species. Animals also played a role in some executions which were staged as recreations of myths and historical events. Naval battles formed part of the spectacles but whether these took place in the amphitheatre or on a lake that had been specially constructed by Augustus is a topic of debate among historians.|$|E
5|$|Some of the Kentish crowds now dispersed, {{but others}} continued. From this point, <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been led by Wat Tyler, whom the Anonimalle Chronicle {{suggests}} was elected their leader {{at a large}} gathering at Maidstone on 7 June. Relatively {{little is known about}} Tyler's former life; chroniclers suggest that he was from Essex, had served in France as an archer and was a charismatic and capable leader. Several chroniclers believe that he was responsible for shaping the political aims of the revolt. Some also mention a Jack Straw as a leader among the Kentish rebels during this phase in the revolt, but it is uncertain if this was a real person, or a pseudonym for Wat Tyler or John Wrawe.|$|E
30|$|Then, we have {{performed}} correlation analysis on various subsets of features {{which had the}} highest correlation with the obtained class, regardless of their interrelation. Also other subsets were used, which were highly correlated with the class and <b>they</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> high cross-correlation (correlation attribute evaluation) [55].|$|R
60|$|The black apes were hairless {{and built}} {{thatched}} huts in their arboreal retreats; they kept domesticated dogs and ruminants, in which respect they were farther advanced than the human beings of Pellucidar; but <b>they</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> only a meager language, and sported long, apelike tails.|$|R
25|$|Deckard had no {{experience}} with Nexus 6 replicants {{at the beginning of}} the film; he and Captain Bryant are puzzled as <b>to</b> why they <b>have</b> risked coming back to Earth and Deckard is unsure how effective the Voight-Kampff test would be on them, as <b>they</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> developed human emotion.|$|R
5|$|The Tempest {{presents}} {{relatively few}} textual problems {{in comparison with}} many of Shakespeare's other plays. First published in the First Folio in December 1623, the play is first in the volume, leading the section of comedies. The play has more stage directions than any of Shakespeare's other plays, though <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been written for readers instead of actors. Scholars infer from this that {{the editors of the}} volume, John Heminges and Henry Condell, included the directions to aid readers, and they were not necessarily Shakespeare's. Scholars have also wondered about the masque in Act 4, which some think was an interpolated afterthought, possibly added for the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Frederick V in 1613. However, other scholars see this as unlikely, arguing that taking the masque out of the play creates more problems than it solves.|$|E
5|$|The {{function}} of Stegosaurus plates {{has been much}} debated. Initially thought of as some form of armor, <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been too fragile and ill-placed for defensive purposes, leaving the animal's sides unprotected. The plates' large size suggests {{that they may have}} served to increase the apparent height of the animal, either to intimidate enemies or to impress other members of the same species, in some form of sexual display, although both male and female specimens seemed to have had the same plates. More recently, researchers have proposed that they may have helped to control the body temperature of the animal, in a similar way to the sails of the pelycosaurs Dimetrodon and Edaphosaurus (and modern elephant and rabbit ears). The plates had blood vessels running through grooves and air flowing around the plates would have cooled the blood.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Syria's {{population in the}} 12th century consisted of Sunni Muslims, typically from Arab or Kurdish backgrounds. There were also sizable Muslim communities of Twelver Shias, Druzes, and Alawites. The Ismaili presence was small and most were of Persian origin, having migrated from Alamut. They mostly resided in the mountainous area near the northern Syrian coastline. Large Christian communities existed in northern Syria, Palestine, Transjordan and Upper Mesopotamia. They were Aramaic-speaking and indigenous to the area, mostly belonging to the Syriac Orthodox Church. They lived in villages of Christian or mixed Christian and Muslim population, monasteries, and in small towns where <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been on friendly terms with their Muslim neighbors. Ideologically, they were led by the Patriarch of Antioch.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the death}} of Anne Chambers, Hodsock was {{inherited}} by William Leigh Mellish. In 1873, his widow employed architect George Devey to alter and enlarge the house, {{at a cost of}} Â£10,044 (...)

50|$|The Caribs {{produced}} the silver products which Ponce de Leon found in TaÃ­no communities. None of the insular Amerindians mined for gold but obtained it by trade from the mainland. The Caribs were skilled boat builders and sailors. <b>They</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> owed their {{dominance in the}} Caribbean basin to their mastery of warfare.|$|R
50|$|Another {{meeting was}} held at Hirwaun Common where it was {{reported}} that several of the coal-owners had brought in workers from elsewhere to replace those on strike. Coal trimmers from Cardiff were said to be engaged at mountain Ash while thirty colliers from Pembrokeshire were reported to be at Cwmpennar, although <b>they</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> refused <b>to</b> work after realising the circumstances.|$|R
5|$|A royal hunting park {{close to}} Melbourne was {{probably}} created by King John around 1200, and the King {{is known to}} have stayed at the manor house on at least five occasions. John gave the manor and its lands to Hugh Beauchamp, although <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> soon reverted to the crown, being gifted by Henry III to Bishop Walter Mauclerk of Carlisle in about 1230. The estate returned to the crown on the bishop's death in 1248, and Henry granted the land to his son, Edmund Crouchback, 1st Earl of Lancaster, in 1265. At some later date, the manor appears to have been granted to a Philip Marc, before passing to Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, the King's son. This was in 1298 when he came of age, his father having died two years earlier. Early references to the house itself are rare, but there are records of repairs to the gutters in 1246 and to the roof of the King's Chamber in 1248.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologists {{since the}} 1960s have {{distinguished}} brochs from smaller structures of similar construction, usually called duns. The heaviest {{evidence of the}} occupation of crannogs was in this era, but they {{would continue to be}} used until the Middle Ages. This period also saw the beginnings of wheelhouses, a roundhouse with a characteristic outer wall, within which was a circle of stone piers (bearing a resemblance to the spokes of a wheel), but these would flourish most in the era of Roman occupation. There is evidence for about 1,000 Iron Age hillforts in Scotland, most located below the Clyde-Forth line. The majority are circular, with a single palisade around an enclosure. Most are relatively small, covering one or two acres, but some are much larger as at Castle O'er, Birrenwark, Cadimuir, Cadroner and White Meldon. <b>They</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been largely abandoned in the Roman period, but some seem to have been reoccupied after their departure.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria do {{not have}} a membrane-bound nucleus, and their genetic {{material}} is typically a single circular bacterial chromosome of DNA located in the cytoplasm in an irregularly shaped body called the nucleoid. The nucleoid contains the chromosome with its associated proteins and RNA. The phylum Planctomycetes and candidate phylum Poribacteria may be exceptions to the general absence of internal membranes in bacteria, because <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a double membrane around their nucleoids and contain other membrane-bound cellular structures. Like all living organisms, bacteria contain ribosomes, often grouped in chains called polyribosomes, for the production of proteins, but the structure of the bacterial ribosome is different from that of eukaryotes and Archaea. Bacterial ribosomes have a sedimentation rate of 70S (measured in Svedberg units): their subunits have rates of 30S and 50S. Some antibiotics bind specifically to 70S ribosomes and inhibit bacterial protein synthesis. Those antibiotics kill bacteria without affecting the larger 80S ribosomes of eukaryotic cells and without harming the host.|$|E
50|$|The {{island has}} always been a popular place for angling and Isaak Walton used to fish from here. The island {{separates}} the weir stream from the navigation channel to the lock.
