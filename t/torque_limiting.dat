50|$|The D2's {{main rotor}} had {{constant}} chord blades of laminated wood, covered with geodesic glass fibre fabric.

40|$|Background: Mechanical <b>torque</b> <b>limiting</b> devices (MTLDs) are {{necessary}} tools {{to control a}} peak torque and achieving target values of screw component of dental implants. Due to probable effect of autoclaving and number of use on the accuracy of these devices, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of sterilization and number of use on the accuracy of friction-style mechanical <b>torque</b> <b>limiting</b> devices (F-S MTLDs) in achieving their target torque values. Materials and Methods: Peak torque measurements of 15 new F-S MTLDs from three different manufacturers (Astra Tech, BioHorizons, Dr. Idhe) were measured ten times before and after 100 steam sterilization using a digital torque gauge. To simulate the clinical situation of aging (number of use) target torque application process was repeated 10 times after each sterilization cycle and the peak torque values were registered. Comparison of the mean differences with target torque in each cycle was performed using one sample t test. Considering the type of MTLDs as inter subject comparison, One-way repeated measure ANOVA {{was used to evaluate}} the absolute values of differences between devices of each manufacturer in each group (α = 0. 05). Results: The results of this study in Dr. Idhe group showed that, mean of difference values significantly differed from the target torque (P = 0. 002) until 75 cycles. In Astra Tech group, also mean of difference values with under estimation trend, showed a significant difference with the target torque (P < 0. 001). Mean of difference values significantly differed from the target torque with under estimation trend during all the 100 cycles in BioHorizons group (P < 0. 05). Conclusion: The torque output of each individual device stayed in 10 % difference from target torque values before 100 sterilization cycles, but more than 10 % difference from the target torque was seen in varying degrees during these consequent cycles...|$|E

40|$|Objective: High {{variability}} in delivering the target torque is reported for friction-style mechanical <b>torque</b> <b>limiting</b> devices (F-S MTLDs). The effect of aging (num-ber of use) on {{the accuracy of}} these devices is not clear. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the effect of aging on the accuracy (+ 10 % of the target torque) of F-S MTLDs. Materials and Methods: Fifteen new F-S MTLDs and their appropriate drivers from three different implant manufacturers (Astra Tech, Biohorizon and Dr Idhe), five for each type, were selected. The procedure of peak torque measurement was performed in ten sequences before and after aging. In each sequence, ten repeti-tions of peak torque values were registered for the aging procedure. To measure the output of each device, a Tohnichi torque gauge was used. Results: Before aging, peak torque measurements of all the devices tested in this study falled within 10 % of their preset target values. After aging, a significant dif-ference was seen between raw error values of three groups of MTLDs (P< 0. 05) ...|$|E

40|$|Motivated by {{the need}} for formal {{guarantees}} on the stability and safety of controllers for challenging robot control tasks, we present a control design procedure that explicitly seeks to maximize {{the size of an}} invariant "funnel" that leads to a predefined goal set. Our certificates of invariance are given in terms of sums of squares proofs of a set of appropriately defined Lyapunov inequalities. These certificates, together with our proposed polynomial controllers, can be efficiently obtained via semidefinite optimization. Our approach can handle time-varying dynamics resulting from tracking a given trajectory, input saturations (e. g. <b>torque</b> <b>limits),</b> and can be extended to deal with uncertainty in the dynamics and state. The resulting controllers can be used by space-filling feedback motion planning algorithms to fill up the space with significantly fewer trajectories. We demonstrate our approach on a severely <b>torque</b> <b>limited</b> underactuated double pendulum (Acrobot) and provide extensive simulation and hardware validation...|$|R
40|$|When the minimum-time {{trajectory}} of a manipulator along a geometrically prescribed path is planned {{taking into consideration}} the manipulator's dynamics and actuator's <b>torque</b> <b>limits,</b> {{at least one of}} the joints should be at the <b>torque</b> <b>limit.</b> The execution of such a trajectory by a conventional feedback control scheme results in torque saturation. Consequently, the tracking error cannot be suppressed and the manipulator may deviate from the desired path. In this paper, we propose a feedback control method for path tracking which takes the torque saturation into account. Based on the desired path, a coordinate system calledpath coordinates is defined. The path coordinates are composed of the component along the path and the components normal to the path. The equation of motion is described in terms of the path coordinates. Control of the components normal to the path is given priority in order to keep the motion of the manipulator on the path. Simulations of a two-degree-of-freedom manipulator show the effectiveness of this method...|$|R
