50|$|Tunneling {{insects that}} attack the boles of black oak and cause serious lumber degrade include the {{carpenter}} worm (Prionoxystus robiniae), red oak borer (Enaphalodes rufulus), the <b>twolined</b> <b>chestnut</b> <b>borer</b> (Agrilus bilineatus), the oak timber worm (Arrhenodes minutus), and the Columbian timber beetle (Corthylus columbianus).|$|E
5000|$|The young larvae eat the buds {{and either}} destroy {{developing}} leaves, or cause leaves to develop with many holes in them. This can severely stress the tree's food reserves, {{and the older}} larvae can eat nearly all the remaining leaves, defoliating them. When trees are defoliated two or more years in a row, [...] "extensive tree mortality" [...] can result. Dead wood in affected trees is attacked by fungi such as the shoestring root fungus and wood borers like the <b>twolined</b> <b>chestnut</b> <b>borer.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{most serious}} defoliating insects that attack Chinkapin oak are the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar), the orangestriped oakworm (Anisota senatoria), and the {{variable}} oakleaf caterpillar (Heterocampa manteo). Insects that bore into the bole and seriously degrade the products cut from infested trees include the carpenterworm (Prionoyxstus robiniae), little carpenterworm (P. macmurtrei), white oak borer (Goes tigrinus), Columbian timber beetle (Corthylus columbianus), oak timberworm (Arrhenodes minutus), and <b>twolined</b> <b>chestnut</b> <b>borer</b> (Agrilus bilineatus). The acorn weevils (Curculio spp.), larvae of moths (Valentinia glandulella and Melissopus latiferreanus), and gall forming cynipids (Callirhytis spp.) {{feed on the}} acorns.|$|E
50|$|Pest {{that can}} attack the tree {{includes}} aphids, borers (flat-headed apple tree <b>borer,</b> two-lined <b>chestnut</b> <b>borer),</b> certain caterpillars, and fungal disease.|$|R
50|$|Trees {{use their}} energy {{reserves}} during re-foliation and may become weakened and exhibit {{symptoms such as}} the death of twigs and branches in the upper crown and sprouting of old buds on the trunk and larger branches. Weakened trees experience radial growth reduction of approximately 30 to 50 percent. Weakened trees are vulnerable to attack by disease organisms and other insects, or example, the Armillaria fungus may attack the roots, and the two-lined <b>chestnut</b> <b>borer</b> may attack the trunk and branches. Affected trees will eventually die {{two or three years}} after they are attacked by these pests.|$|R
5000|$|The {{number of}} species invasions {{has been on the}} rise at least since the {{beginning}} of the 1900s. Species are increasingly being moved by humans (on purpose and accidentally). In some cases the invaders are causing drastic changes and damage to their new habitats (e.g.: zebra mussels and the emerald ash borer in the Great Lakes region and the lion fish along the North American Atlantic coast). Some evidence suggests that invasive species are competitive in their new habitats because they are subject to less pathogen disturbance. Others report confounding evidence that occasionally suggest that species-rich communities harbor many native and exotic species simultaneously while some say that diverse ecosystems are more resilient and resist invasive plants and animals. An important question is, [...] "do invasive species cause extinctions?" [...] Many studies cite effects of invasive species on natives, but not extinctions. Invasive species seem to increase local (i.e.: alpha diversity) diversity, which decreases turnover of diversity (i.e.: beta diversity). Overall gamma diversity may be lowered because species are going extinct because of other causes, but even some of the most insidious invaders (e.g.: Dutch elm disease, emerald ash <b>borer,</b> <b>chestnut</b> blight in North America) have not caused their host species to become extinct. Extirpation, population decline and homogenization of regional biodiversity are much more common. Human activities have frequently been the cause of invasive species circumventing their barriers, [...] by introducing them for food and other purposes. Human activities therefore allow species to migrate to new areas (and thus become invasive) occurred on time scales much shorter than historically have been required for a species to extend its range.|$|R

This can severely stress the tree's food reserves, {{and the older}} larvae can eat nearly all the remaining leaves, defoliating them. When trees are defoliated two or more years in a row, this leads to [...] "branch dieback, loss of diameter growth, and tree decline". The oak leaftier has caused [...] "considerable tree mortality", especially in the Appalachian region. Dead wood in affected trees is attacked by fungi such as the shoestring root fungus and wood borers like the <b>twolined</b> <b>chestnut</b> <b>borer.</b> A major outbreak occurred in the 1960s and 1970s in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia. Tiadaghton State Forest in north central Pennsylvania was especially hard hit. Natural methods of pest control usually are sufficient to keep Croesia semipurpurana populations in check, but chemical pesticides are sometimes needed.|$|E
