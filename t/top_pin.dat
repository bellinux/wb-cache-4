50|$|To rekey a lock {{you have}} to first remove the lock {{cylinder}} from any housing it rests in. The lock cylinder must be disassembled, and the plug removed. Use a plug follower to avoid dropping master-wafers, <b>top</b> <b>pins</b> and springs. The plug has cylindrical chambers spaced according to manufacturer specifications. Pins are contained in these chambers where they are pushed down by springs or raised by a key. Each cut sits under a chamber of its own, each pin sits on a cut of its own. Place the correct pins in each chamber, bringing {{the top of each}} new pin flush with the shear-line. Check the upper chambers using a master-follower for old unused master wafers and remove any. If any springs are noticeably weak or the lock was especially dirty replace the springs. If the old pins are rounded from use or otherwise show excessive wear replace springs. Reinsert the plug taking care not to drop <b>top</b> <b>pins</b> into any unused chamber. Test key, make slight adjustments if needed and reassemble.|$|R

40|$|Deformation {{behavior}} in {{three-point bending test}} of Mo-Si-B alloy specimens with pre-crack was investigated byrecourse to finite element analysis (FEA) with heterogeneous microstructures incorporated. The loading configuration wascarried out by moving the <b>top</b> <b>pin</b> down, while the bottom pin remained fixed. The Mo-Si-B alloy consists of hard, brittle T 2 (Mo 5 SiB 2) phase embedded in a soft matrix of Mo solid solution. The sample contains pre-crack configuration at the middlein order to study {{the effect of the}} second phase (T 2 particles) onto a crack tip during the bending test. Real optical micrographswere scanned, digitized, and meshed into a two dimensional model with constitutive relations of both phases. It was found that the plastic strain localization was not only caused by the hard T 2 particles ahead of the crack tip, but also caused by the top pushing pin. This interaction between two strain fields was also observed if the microstructure were homogeneous. Two methodologies were explored in order to minimize this interaction in order to solely separate the effect of hard T 2 particles ahead of the crack tip. The first one was to increase the distance between the <b>top</b> <b>pin</b> and the crack tip, while the second one was to approximate the pushing pin loading by end moment application.

50|$|A {{pin tumbler}} lock {{normally}} contains {{a set of}} bottom pins {{and a set of}} driver pins. The bottom pins move within pin channels inside the cylinder assembly and are cut at different lengths corresponding to the lock keying. The driver pins are installed in the lock housing and spring pressure forces them to penetrate the lock cylinder and prevent it from turning. If the wrong key is inserted, it will variously push the bottom pins either too high or not high enough, and the lock cylinder can not turn. When the bottom pins are correctly aligned by the key, the <b>top</b> <b>pins</b> are exactly aligned with the barrel of the cylinder, and it may freely turn.|$|R

50|$|In {{order for}} the lock to operate, the key must be fully inserted, {{allowing}} the dual sidebars to enter the pins, provided the pins were raised to the correct height, thereby freeing the cylinder core for rotation. The cylinder does not use the traditional top- and bottom-pin combination, relying instead only on {{the holes in the}} side of the pins and pressure applied by the 12 springs above. Many pins have a dummy hole which will trap the sidebar pin if any turning pressure is applied to the lock with the pin in the incorrect position, preventing the lock from opening. Due to the lack of <b>top</b> <b>pins,</b> lock bumping is theoretically impossible; because bumping requires a moment in time when the two pins separate, and when this occurs and turning pressure is applied, the cylinder will rotate, thereby causing the lock to open. This bumping technique uses the principles of Newton's cradle.|$|R

50|$|A {{traditional}} lock pick uses trial-and-error {{methods to}} find the correct alignment of the locking pins. The snap gun uses a primary law of physics, the transfer of energy, to momentarily burst all of the driver pins out of the lock cylinder without sending the bottom pins up into it. The snap gun strikes all of the bottom pins at once with a strong impact, and then withdraws again. The bottom pins transfer their kinetic energy to the <b>top</b> <b>pins</b> and come to a complete stop without penetrating the lock housing. The driver pins are {{thrown out of the}} cylinder body entirely up into the lock housing. Until the springs force the driver pins back into the cylinder, the lock cylinder is momentarily unobstructed. The physical effect of the impact is similar to the game of billiards, where the cue stick first strikes the cue ball, transferring kinetic energy into the cue ball. The cue ball then strikes a target ball. Since the two balls are very elastic, and since the target ball is free to move, the cue ball (representing a bottom pin) comes to a complete stop at the point of impact and the target ball (representing a driver pin) continues moving with most of the kinetic energy that was formerly in the cue ball.|$|R
