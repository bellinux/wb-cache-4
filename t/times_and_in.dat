5|$|Drafted by the Baltimore Colts in {{the twentieth}} round as the 203rd overall pick of the 1954 NFL Draft, Berry was {{considered}} a long-shot {{to make the team}} roster. After being used sparingly as a rookie, catching only 13 passes, he became a permanent starter on the team by his second NFL season when the Colts acquired quarterback Johnny Unitas. Over the next 12 seasons together, the two {{became one of the most}} dominant passing and catching duos in NFL history. Berry, who did not miss a single game until his eighth year in the league, led the NFL in receptions and receiving yards three <b>times</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> receiving touchdowns twice.|$|E

Methods: Screen <b>time</b> <b>and</b> breaks <b>in</b> screen <b>time</b> were assessed with questionnaires in a sample of 445 children (10 - 12 years) in Belgium, Greece, Hungary and Norway. Parents’ screen time, breaks in screen <b>time,</b> parents’ PA <b>and</b> demographics were also assessed with questionnaires. Accelerometers measured sedentary <b>time</b> per day <b>and</b> breaks <b>in</b> sedentary <b>time</b> per day <b>and</b> MVPA (children only). Bivariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were applied to assess the associations between the independent variables and the dependent variables. Interaction terms were added in the final model to examine whether the associations between self-reported screen <b>time</b> <b>and</b> breaks <b>in</b> screen <b>time</b> <b>and</b> accelerometer assessed sedentary <b>time</b> <b>and</b> breaks <b>in</b> sedentary <b>time</b> were moderated by the significant independent variables. Results: No statistical significant interactions were found between the significant independent variables. Country specific significant associations were found between self-reported screen <b>time</b> <b>and</b> gender, parents’ screen time, parents’ educational level and accelerometer assessed sedentary time. Country specific associations were found between self-reported breaks during one hour of screen <b>time</b> <b>and</b> parents’ educational level and ethnicity. Conclusion: The associations between self-reported screen <b>time</b> <b>and</b> breaks <b>in</b> screen <b>time</b> <b>and</b> accelerometer assessed sedentary <b>time</b> <b>and</b> breaks were not moderated by gender, ethnicity, MVPA, parents’ educational level, parents’ self-reported screen <b>time</b> <b>and</b> breaks <b>in</b> screen <b>time</b> <b>and</b> parents’ PA.

5|$|The 1999–2000 season saw Wallwork make further {{progress}} at Manchester United {{as he made}} seven appearances for the first-team, mostly as a defensive midfielder. Then, in 2000–01, he amassed enough league appearances {{to qualify for a}} Premier League winner's medal. However, his spell in the United first-team was short-lived, as the signings of centre-back Laurent Blanc and central midfielder Juan Sebastián Verón made Wallwork surplus to requirements. He made his final appearance for United on 26 January 2002, playing 61 minutes of the FA Cup Fourth Round match against Middlesbrough before being replaced by Ryan Giggs. In his seven years at United, Wallwork played just 28 <b>times,</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> the summer of 2002 his contract was not renewed.|$|E
5|$|The Silver Jubilee Bridge was widened in {{the mid-1970s}} by bolting a new {{pedestrian}} way {{to the side of}} the original structure and widening the roadways over the old footpaths. It is a bottleneck and becomes congested at peak travel <b>times,</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> the event of a breakdown or accident on the bridge, traffic in the area comes to a standstill. To resolve this problem, a second crossing of the Mersey is planned, to be known as the Mersey Gateway.|$|E
5|$|The {{fountain}} looks unfinished, like concrete {{that has}} not been completely mixed. Up close, it is very rough and textured. There are several square pillars or cubed tubes that form a semi circle inside a pentagon shaped pool. The natural colored pillars jut out and crisscross from the corner of the plaza “like the tentacles of some immense geometrical octopus….breaking open.” There are two bridges, or walk ways (with stairs), that allow the public to stand in-between the tubes and have a view overlooking the plaza and city. A series of platforms at pool level permit pedestrian entry into the fountain and behind the falling water. The fountain and plaza are easily accessible to the public at all <b>times</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> all conditions, rain or shine. The fountain's budget was US$310,000, and it was dedicated on April 22, 1971. The Los Angeles Times reported that its actual cost was US$607,800.|$|E

5|$|There were {{numerous}} coal workings {{in the area}} from Gurney Slade east to Mells around the villages of Holcombe, Coleford and Stratton-on-the-Fosse. These included at least 52 bell pits, some with deeper shafts and 16 adits. Some coal may have been mined during Roman <b>times</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> the 13th century, making them the earliest coal mines in Somerset, but most development occurred in the 17th century.

In the 2005 MLB Draft, the Padres selected Venable in the seventh round. He made his major league debut on August 29, 2008, against the Colorado Rockies, collecting his first hit.

Venable has frequently batted lead off and has on several occasions come within one hit of the cycle. , he has finished among the top ten in the National League in triples four <b>times</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> stolen bases twice.

5|$|Three {{days after}} Japan's formal {{surrender}} in Tokyo Bay, Hashimoto {{was promoted to}} his final rank of commander. On 20 November, he was given command of the destroyer Yukikaze, among the few Imperial Navy ships to survive the war, and assigned to repatriation duties, returning troops to Japan from overseas. Before Hashimoto could begin his new duties, however, he was summoned by the United States military to be a {{witness for the prosecution}} in the court-martial against Indianapolis commander Captain Charles B. McVay III, who was on trial on charges of negligence leading to the ship's sinking. On 9 December 1945 he was transported from Tokyo to Oakland, California aboard an aircraft of the Naval Air Transport Service. Hashimoto was assured he would be treated as a naval officer instead of a prisoner of war or war criminal, but he remained under guard during his time in the United States and was not allowed to leave his hotel, as his appearance had been front page news that day in the New York <b>Times</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> other newspapers. The next day he arrived in Washington, D.C. where hearings were taking place. For the duration of his time in the United States, he spoke through translator Francis Earl Eastlake from the Office of Naval Intelligence.|$|E
