5|$|Captained by Commander Geoffrey Layton, her post-completion trials {{lasted for}} five months as {{she was used to}} {{evaluate}} steam power for submarine use. Much was learned about the operation of steam submarines, which helped the subsequent design of the steam-powered K-class fleet submarines. She proved to be very unstable while surfacing, presumably because she could not pump the water out of her controlled free-flooding spaces quickly enough in the upper part of her double hull. These problems, coupled with the fact <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> too slow to work with the fleet as originally envisioned, meant <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> impossible to make into an effective warship, and she was laid up after her trials.|$|E
