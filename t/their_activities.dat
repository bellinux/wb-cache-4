5|$|Approximately {{two-thirds of}} human serpins perform {{extracellular}} roles, inhibiting proteases {{in the bloodstream}} in order to modulate <b>their</b> <b>activities.</b> For example, extracellular serpins regulate the proteolytic cascades central to blood clotting (antithrombin), the inflammatory and immune responses (antitrypsin, antichymotrypsin, and C1-inhibitor) and tissue remodelling (PAI-1). By inhibiting signalling cascade proteases, they can also affect development. The table of human serpins (below) provides examples {{of the range of}} functions performed by human serpin, {{as well as some of}} the diseases that result from serpin deficiency.|$|E

5|$|Brolgas are gregarious creatures; {{the basic}} social unit {{is a pair}} or small family group of {{about three or four}} birds, usually parents {{together}} with juvenile offspring, though some of such groups are unrelated. In the non-breeding season, they gather into large flocks, which appear to be many self-contained individual groups rather than a single social unit. Within the flock, families tend to remain separate and to coordinate <b>their</b> <b>activities</b> with one another rather than with the flock as a whole.|$|E
5|$|By early 1944, Allied {{submarines}} were sinking {{large numbers}} of Japanese ships. <b>Their</b> <b>activities</b> were frequently guided by 'Ultra' intelligence relating to ship movements which was collected by intercepting and decrypting encoded radio transmissions. The IJN routinely broadcast the location and intended route of convoys under its protection, and decrypting these messages allowed Allied naval commanders to alert submarines {{in the vicinity of}} convoys. The submarine commanders were free to plan their interception and attack where conditions were most favorable.|$|E
5|$|Dung beetles form spherical {{balls of}} animal excrement, which they roll with their bodies, {{generally}} by walking backwards and pushing {{the ball with}} their rear legs. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that this rolling behavior evolved independently several times. The behavior of these beetles was noted in ancient Egyptian culture, which imparted sacred significance to <b>their</b> <b>activities.</b> Although it is the dung ball that rolls rather than the beetle itself, the beetles face {{many of the same}} mechanical difficulties that rolling organisms contend with.|$|E

40|$|Increased HIV risk creates {{incentives}} {{for people with}} low sexual <b>activity</b> to reduce <b>their</b> <b>activity</b> but may make high-activity people fatalistic, leading them to reduce <b>their</b> <b>activity</b> only slightly or actually increase it. If high-activity people reduce <b>their</b> <b>activity</b> by a smaller proportion than low-activity people, {{the composition of the}} pool of available partners will worsen, creating positive feedbacks and possibly multiple steady states. Early public health efforts may allow societies to reach more favorable steady states.

During {{the same time period}} the Apaches, who had been stockpiling guns received from the Karankawas, returned to raiding settlements in Texas, violating their peace treaty.

The navy made plans to replace Goeben with her sister , but the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo, Bosnia, on 28 June 1914 and the subsequent rise in tensions between the Great Powers made this impossible.|$|E

In some rural areas, such as the greater Tzaneen area, there are Troops with over 100 Scouts. Rural Troops are often limited in <b>their</b> <b>activities</b> by funding and lack of equipment. Their programme focuses on educating the Scouts in becoming good citizens and in the dangers of HIV. Educating Scouts in HIV and AIDS is vitally important due to the large number of infections in both rural and urban areas of South Africa.|$|E

He gathered several men, including Almaron Dickinson, also a former US Army field artilleryman, together to form the first artillery company of Texians. A local Methodist minister, W. P.

The theoretical part of this bachelor thesis deals with ways of creating words and motivations of nomination of persons by <b>their</b> <b>activity</b> in the Russian language and the Czech language. It also analyses word-formation in both the languages. The practical part of this bachelor thesis deals with already specific comparisons of typology of nomination in terms of word-formation categories of nomination of persons by <b>their</b> <b>activity</b> in the Czech language and the Russian language e. g. productive ways of word-formation, productive formants in both the languages (prefixes, suffixes etc.) and their differences. There is also a question of gender inflection of nomination of persons by <b>their</b> <b>activity</b> between the Russian language and the Czech language that this bachelor thesis deals with.
