5|$|Another {{variation}} on the theme was produced later in the season. Like the BT46B, the BT46C removed the radiators from the front wing assembly leaving a clean aerodynamic wing and moving the centre of gravity further back again. The standard radiators were replaced by units from a Volkswagen Golf mounted behind <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> out of the airstream in a region of positive pressure.|$|E
5|$|Tauranac signed double world {{champion}} Graham Hill and young Australian Tim Schenken to drive for the 1971 season. Tauranac designed the unusual 'lobster claw' BT34, featuring twin radiators mounted ahead of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheels,</b> a single example {{of which was}} built for Hill. Although Hill, no longer a front-runner since his 1969 accident, took his final Formula One win in the non-championship BRDC International Trophy at Silverstone, the team scored only sevenchampionship points.|$|E
5|$|The mid-engine {{complicated}} {{the design of}} the four-wheel drive system, and an innovative solution was needed to get drive {{from the rear of the}} engine to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheels.</b> The chosen design took the front-wheel drive from the central differential on the rear transaxle and sent it through the V in the centre of the engine using a quill drive, before joining an inverted differential. The clutch was a twin-plate unit designed by AP Racing.|$|E
5000|$|... a {{main frame}} hinge in {{the centre of}} the bicycle allows <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> to be swung around and placed against the rear <b>wheel.</b> As <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> also rotates freely for {{steering}} purposes, <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> remains pointing forwards even when folded; ...|$|R
500|$|When braking is {{increasing}} {{the center of}} mass m may move forward relative to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel,</b> as <b>the</b> rider moves forward relative to the bike, and, if the bike has suspension on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel,</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> forks compress under load, changing the bike geometry. This all puts extra load on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Vélosolex has a [...] motor mounted above <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel.</b> Power is {{delivered}} via a small ceramic roller that rotates directly on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> by friction to the tire.|$|R
5|$|Both {{tracks and}} wheels {{were used for}} {{steering}}. The steering system was set up so that shallow turns used only the wheels, but brakes would {{be applied to the}} tracks the farther the steering wheel was turned. The drive sprocket had rollers rather than the more common teeth. The rear suspension consisted of six double roadwheels, overlapping and interleaved in the usual Schachtellaufwerk system used for German half-track vehicles, mounted on swing arms sprung by torsion bars. An idler wheel, mounted {{at the rear of the}} vehicle, was used to control track tension. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> had leaf springs and shock absorbers.|$|E
5|$|Some early T-26 {{tanks were}} {{repaired}} in tank units or factories {{with the use}} of later production parts. This meant replacing the all-rubber road wheels (except <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheels)</b> and track idlers with new strengthened ones. Armour was added for the headlight, the armour thickness of the driver's hatch lower door of the twin-turreted tanks was increased from 6 to 10mm and armoured PT-1 or PTK observation devices were installed. A common hatch above the engine, oil tank, and fuel tank was mounted starting in May 1940. In 1940, 255 T-26s were modernised in this way and {{in the first half of}} 1941 another 85 tanks were improved. A central factory responsible for the T-26's repair and modernisation was the Factory of Carrying-and-Conveying Machines named after S. Kirov in Leningrad, and the Factory No. 105 named after L. Kaganovich in Khabarovsk from the beginning of the Great Patriotic War until 1945.|$|E
5|$|The guide-wheel, which {{protrudes}} {{just ahead of}} <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheels,</b> {{is the most important}} part of the bus when travelling on the O-Bahn. It is connected directly to the steering mechanism, and steers the bus by running along the raised edge of the track. While it is not strictly necessary for drivers to hold the steering wheel when travelling on the O-Bahn because of the guide-wheel, safety procedures require the driver to be alert to their circumstances at all times. A rumble strip before stations is a reminder that they need to resume control. The guide-wheel is the most delicate part of the system and is designed to snap off upon sharp impact; before the O-Bahn was in place, a number of buses were fitted with guide-wheels for their ordinary routes to test their durability. Drivers were forced to be more cautious on their normal trips after numerous guide-wheel-to-kerb impacts.|$|E
25|$|One {{effect of}} turning <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> is a roll moment caused by {{gyroscopic}} precession. The {{magnitude of this}} moment {{is proportional to the}} moment of inertia of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel,</b> its spin rate (forward motion), the rate that the rider turns <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> by applying a torque to the handlebars, and the cosine of the angle between the steering axis and the vertical.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> special <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> {{contains}} a rotating flywheel {{driven by a}} rechargeable-battery-powered motor that spins at high RPMs like a gyroscope. This flywheel spins significantly faster than <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> rolls and acts as a gyroscope, even when the bike is moving slowly, such as when the rider is starting. The flywheel causes <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> {{to respond to a}} lean by precessing, that is <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> turns toward <b>the</b> direction of the lean, which can help provide stability at low speeds, whether riding straight or turning.|$|R

25|$|Some hybrid {{vehicles}} {{such as the}} Lexus RX400h provide {{power to}} an AWD system through a pair of electric motors, one to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> and one to the rear. In {{the case of the}} AWD model version of the Lexus RX400h (and its Toyota-branded counterpart, the Harrier hybrid), <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> can also receive drive power directly from the vehicle's gasoline engine as well as via the electric motors, whereas the rear wheels derive power only from the second electric motor. Transfer of power is managed automatically by internal electronics based on traction conditions and need, making this an all-wheel-drive system.|$|E
25|$|It is {{also common}} {{to use a}} larger {{diameter}} rotor on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> and a smaller rotor on the rear <b>wheel</b> since <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> does <b>the</b> most braking (up to 90% of the total).|$|R

[...] Landing on a stopped <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> with <b>the</b> brakes still applied is likely to cause <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> to skid and may flip the rider over the handlebar.|$|R
5|$|As {{mentioned}} above {{in the section}} on balance, one effect of turning <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> is a roll moment caused by gyroscopic precession. The magnitude of this moment {{is proportional to the}} moment of inertia of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel,</b> its spin rate (forward motion), the rate that the rider turns <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> by applying a torque to the handlebars, and the cosine of the angle between the steering axis and the vertical.|$|R
25|$|In 2008, Nissan {{introduced}} the GT-R featuring a rear-mounted transaxle. The AWD system requires two drive shafts, one main shaft {{from the engine}} to the transaxle and differential and a second drive shaft from the transaxle to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|E
25|$|Related to {{the steam}} {{traction}} engine, the steam roller {{was used for}} road building and flattening ground. Typically designed with a single heavy roller (in practice, usually a pair of adjacent rollers) replacing <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> and axle, and smooth rear wheels without strakes.|$|E
25|$|The {{piston rods}} {{connected}} {{to a pair of}} grasshopper beams (one for each cylinder) mounted above the boiler. A connecting rod near the piston end of the walking beams drove the rear axle's wheels, where it also {{connected to a}} coupling rod to drive <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{longitudinally}} stable when stationary, bikes {{often have}} a high enough center of mass and a short enough wheelbase to lift a wheel off the ground under sufficient acceleration or deceleration. When braking, depending on {{the location of the}} combined center of mass of the bike and rider with respect to the point where <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> contacts <b>the</b> ground, bikes can either skid <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> or flip <b>the</b> bike and rider over <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel.</b> A similar situation is possible while accelerating, but with respect to the rear wheel.|$|R

25|$|The AWD {{model of}} the G35 sedan is called the G35x. Although the {{automatic}} transmission for the G35x is manufactured by Aisin-Warner, the AWD technology uses Nissan's proprietary ATTESA E-TS AWD system. The system will make the car 100% rear wheel drive when driving at a steady speed. When the driver uses the throttle to accelerate from a stop or constant speed, the AWD system can send up to 50% of torque to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheels.</b> When the car's speed becomes steady again, the drivetrain will return torque to the rear wheels. The AWD system will also transfer torque to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> if the system detects loss of traction. This technology was first used in the 1989 Nissan Skyline GT-R, and has since been used in subsequent Skylines, and other vehicles in Japan and overseas, including the Nissan Bluebird, and Nissan Stagea.|$|E
25|$|The DIRAVI {{steering}} is self-centering {{and fully}} powered (as opposed to hydraulically assisted). This feature allows <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> to run near-zero caster, and {{means that there}} is no camber change as lock is applied, and also ensures that the maximum amount of tyre area is in contact with the road at all times.|$|E
25|$|It {{was at the}} MCG in 1869 that Australia’s first bicycle {{race was}} held. The event was for velocipedes, crude wooden {{machines}} with pedals on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheels.</b> In 1898 the Austral Wheel Race {{was held at the}} MCG attracting a crowd of 30,000 to see cyclists race for a total of £200 in prize money.|$|E

25|$|These provide {{improved}} lighting for cornering. Some automobiles {{have their}} headlamps {{connected to the}} steering mechanism so the lights will follow the movement of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheels.</b> Czechoslovak Tatra was an early implementer of such a technique, producing in the 1930s a vehicle with a central directional headlamp. The American 1948 Tucker Sedan was likewise equipped with a third central headlamp connected mechanically to the steering system.|$|E
25|$|The AC-35 had {{side-by-side}} seating {{with a small}} baggage compartment. The fuselage was {{a combination}} of steel tube in front, and wood construction in the tail with fabric covering overall. The engine was rear mounted with a shaft driven forward propeller. The vehicle had three equal size wheels (two in front, one in the rear). The rear wheel was shaft driven from the engine and <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> provided steering.|$|E
25|$|In 1937, the Japanese company Tokyu Kurogane Kogyo built {{approximately}} 4,700 four-wheel-drive roadsters, {{called the}} Type 95 {{used by the}} Imperial Japanese Army from 1937 until 1944, used during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Three different bodystyles were manufactured; a 2-door roadster, a 2-door pickup truck and a 4-door phaeton, all equipped with a transfer case that engaged <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheels,</b> powered by a 1.3 litre, 2-cylinder, air-cooled OHV V-twin engine.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of a front suspension, {{especially}} telescoping fork tubes, the increase in downward force on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> during braking may cause the suspension to compress and <b>the</b> <b>front</b> end to lower.
