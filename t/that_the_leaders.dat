5|$|In {{the first}} days of the blockade, someone managed to smuggle a letter out of the Jewish quarter to the Jewish {{leadership}} in Constantinople. It was not until March 27 <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> of the Jewish community in the Ottoman capital forwarded it to the Rothschild family, together with a similar call for help from the Jews of Damascus. To these documents, the Jewish leaders attached their own statement in which they cast doubt on their ability to influence the sultan.|$|E
5|$|A storm {{causes the}} ship to crash, and the group awakens to {{discover}} that a glacier blocks the reinforcements' path. While investigating the glacier, the group finds Sherincal, a half-dragon, guarding the entrance to an Aurilite temple. They learn that Sherincal leads the Legion of the Chimera's western forces, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> of the Legion of the Chimera, cambion twins named Isair and Madae, reside in the Severed Hand. Inside the Aurilite temple, the group finds a prisoner from Kuldahar, who asks them to warn Kuldahar of {{the threat posed by}} the Legion of the Chimera. After this, the group creates a passage through the glacier, and meets with the reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|Voting is {{regarded}} as key to representative democracy, which requires <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> of a country are elected by the people. The basis of this concept is that everyone should be treated equally and everyone has equal rights. Every person, therefore, {{has a right to}} one vote, and no more, in the choice of representatives. The right to vote is a primary right, a right of fundamental importance by which other rights are protected. It is one of the important bulwarks of a representative democracy and in this regard, the ballot box is the people's ultimate mechanism to control the shaping of government policies. However, it must be recognized that voting is not an infallible litmus test for democracy; rather, it functions as a procedural device that is normally regarded as the best instrument for securing the ideal of self-governance.|$|E

No assumption can be made about the confidence of other peers. Receiving a Gradecast with confidence 0 indicates <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>leader</b> behaved incorrectly and, crucially, that all other correct peers know <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>leader</b> behaved incorrectly.|$|R

Written rights are also passed on to employees, which means <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> of an organization tend to fall into the background and merely have a passive position.|$|E
25|$|The infighting in Los Zetas {{referred}} to confrontations between two factions in that criminal organization, Mexico's most violent, one led by Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano, alias El Lazca {{and the other}} led by Miguel Treviño Morales, alias Z-40. The rumors of the split appeared in mid-2012, when public banners and music videos on the web alleged betrayals between the two leaders. After the death of Lazcano it was confirmed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> were not confronting each other, but rather that some men within Morales' faction did not want him as leader.|$|E

Geoffrey received Kalamata and Messenia as a fief from the new prince. However, the Republic of Venice proceeded to make good her claims <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> of the Fourth Crusade had guaranteed it by the partition treaty of 1204 to the important way stations along the sea route to Constantinople. Thus the Venetians armed a fleet which took Modon and Coron (Koroni) in 1206, but William of Champlitte compensated Geoffrey by assigning Arcadia to him.|$|E

The worldwide U.S. Forces DEFCON 3 status was returned to DEFCON 4 on November 20, 1962. U-2 pilot Anderson's body was returned to the US and was buried with full military honors in South Carolina. He was the first recipient of the newly created Air Force Cross, which was awarded posthumously.|$|E

The court felt that the fraud {{was the result of a}} planned work, and had been ongoing for several years. The court did not believe that the organisation did not have financial motives for the fraud. The court also stated that an organisation culture was not mitigating circumstances. It also stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> and treasurers had a personal responsibility. The court also felt that not following a requirement from the city issued in 1992, requiring AUF to clean up its membership register system, was in the disfavour of the indicted.|$|E
25|$|The south Indian {{coastal areas}} around Kanyakumari were known for pearl {{fisheries}} ruled by Paravars. From 1527 the Paravars were being threatened by Arab fleets offshore, {{headed by the}} Muslim supporting Zamorin of Calicut,. The Paravars sought the protection of Portuguese who had moved into the area. The protection was granted on the condition <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> were immediately baptised as Christians {{and that they would}} encourage their people also to convert to Christianity; the Portuguese would also gain a strategic foothold and control of the pearl fisheries. The deal was agreed and some months later 20,000 Paravars were baptised en masse, and by 1537 the entire community had declared itself to be Christian. The Portuguese navy destroyed the Arab fleet at Vedalai on 27 June 1538.|$|E
25|$|WIFLP leader Sir Grantley Adams of Barbados became Prime Minister. The {{selection}} of Adams as the Prime Minister was {{indicative of the}} problems the Federation would face. The expected leader of the WIFLP was Norman Manley, Premier of Jamaica, and the next logical choice was Dr. Eric Williams, Premier of Trinidad and Tobago. However, neither had contested the Federal elections, preferring to remain {{in control of their}} respective island power bases. This suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> of the two most important provinces did not see the Federation as viable. Similarly, Alexander Bustamante, the Jamaican founder of the DLP, also declined to contest the Federal election, leaving the party leadership to the Trinidadian Ashford Sinanan. The absence of the leading Jamaican politicians from any role at the federal level was to undermine the Federation's unity.|$|E

50|$|One of <b>the</b> Ansar {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Ansar {{should choose}} a leader {{for themselves and}} the Meccans should choose another for themselves. Abu Bakar mentioned the sayings of Muhammad and convinced {{a large number of}} Ansar <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>leader</b> can be from Quraysh only. But some Ansar still insisted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>leader</b> should be chosen from them. The meeting became loud and unruly. Umar is reported to have said that he feared <b>that</b> <b>the</b> unity of the Muslim community would dissolve then and there. So he seized Abu Bakr's hand and swore the bay'ah to him as <b>the</b> <b>leader</b> of <b>the</b> Muslims. The Muhajirun followed his lead and then the Ansar. Ultimately all the people present over there rendered allegiance to him without any fight.|$|R

25|$|Prior to an International Labour Day celebration, {{government}} officials concoct a false flag assassination plot to foment {{public support for}} legislation of the National Security Law. They hire two petty gangsters to execute the plot: Hairy (Zerisawa Courtney Wu), a middle-aged low-level triad member, and Peter (Peter Chan), an immigrant from India. While the two argue over who should fire the gun, {{the director of the}} Liaison Office decides <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> of both the TMD and the Fortune Parties are to get shot with real bullets, so as to instigate greater panic in the territory. Misbelieving they will get paid and flee to India afterwards, both Hairy and Peter attempt the assassination but are killed instantly on scene by the police. Later, the government identifies the perpetrators as terrorists and restates the significance of the upcoming legislation.|$|E
25|$|If {{it should}} be {{declared}} that contraception is not evil in itself, then we should have to concede frankly that the Holy Spirit {{had been on the}} side of the Protestant churches in 1930 (when the encyclical Casti Connubii was promulgated), in 1951 (Pius XII's address to the midwives), and in 1958 (the address delivered before the Society of Hematologists in the year the pope died). It should likewise have to be admitted that for a half century the Spirit failed to protect Pius XI, Pius XII, and a large part of the Catholic hierarchy from a very serious error. This would mean <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> of the Church, acting with extreme imprudence, had condemned thousands of innocent human acts, forbidding, under pain of eternal damnation, a practice which would now be sanctioned. The fact can neither be denied nor ignored that these same acts would now be declared licit on the grounds of principles cited by the Protestants, which popes and bishops have either condemned or at least not approved.|$|E
25|$|The unusual {{lifestyle}} and growth pattern of Kiryas Joel {{has led to}} litigation {{on a number of}} fronts. In 1994, the Supreme Court ruled in the case of Board of Education of Kiryas Joel Village School District v. Grumet that the Kiryas Joel school district, which covered only the village, was designed in violation of the Establishment Clause of the 1st Amendment, because the design accommodated one group on the basis of religious affiliation. Subsequently, the New York State Legislature established a similar school district in the village that has passed legal muster. Further litigation has resulted over what entity should pay for the education of children with disabilities in Kiryas Joel, and over whether the community's boys must ride buses driven by women. A case against the village is currently pending in federal district court; plaintiffs, who are asking for the village to be dissolved, say that Kiryas Joel is a theocracy whose existence violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, where local government leaders abuse the laws, such as those for tax-exempt status, zoning, and sanitation, to favor members of their own sect and persecute other Orthodox Jews. They also say <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> commit vote fraud by intimidating dissident voters and busing in non-residents.|$|E
