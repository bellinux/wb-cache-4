The book would pick up the story immediately after the third book, and Martin scrapped the idea of a five-year gap.

They typically have estrogen and/or progesterone receptors. The prognosis for low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma is good, with 60–90% five-year survival. High-grade undifferentiated endometrial sarcoma (HGUS) has a worse prognosis, with high rates of recurrence and 25% five-year survival. HGUS prognosis is dictated by {{whether or not the}} cancer has invaded the arteries and veins.
