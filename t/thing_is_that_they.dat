6000|$|... "The {{remarkable}} <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are {{an exact}} fit," [...] {{the man said}} about the slippers, and Miss Ailie nodded, {{but she did not}} think it remarkable.|$|E
6000|$|... "Almost dangerously so," [...] said Jane Mohun; [...] "and the odd <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{are just}} alike enough for first cousins, {{as they are}} here, though Shakespeare was not guilty of making them such." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh no." [...] He {{continued}} thoughtfully {{silent for}} a little while before he resumed. [...] "The amazing <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> got lost again, and that when they tried going back to the Canucks they couldn't find the way." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Man is {{the measure}} of all <b>things,</b> of <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are,</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are; and of <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not, <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not". -- Protagoras ...|$|R
60|$|The strange <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> paid not the {{slightest}} attention to me, and pulling up my pony I sat staring in astonishment at them, particularly at one, a very big one and nearest to me, engaged in leisurely pecking at the clover plants growing among the big prickly thistle leaves, and as it seemed carefully selecting the best sprays.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first man}} to call himself a sophist, {{according}} to Plato, was Protagoras, whom he presents as teaching <b>that</b> all virtue <b>is</b> conventional. It was Protagoras who claimed <b>that</b> [...] "man <b>is</b> the measure of all things, of the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are,</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> and of the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not, <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not," [...] which Plato interprets as a radical perspectivism, where some <b>things</b> seem to <b>be</b> one way for one person (and so actually <b>are</b> <b>that</b> way) and another way for another person (and so actually <b>are</b> <b>that</b> way as well); the conclusion being that one cannot look to nature for guidance regarding how to live one's life.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{suppose they}} do," [...] he said. [...] "And when the {{aboriginal}} ice-house, {{or whatever the}} ridiculous <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have discovered, gives out, I suppose that they can come to a reasonable man and ask him for a little money to buy bread and butter." ...|$|E
6000|$|Sir James {{looked at}} him keenly. [...] "You had worked that out, had you? Not bad--not at all bad. The curious <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{certainly}} did not know anything about you when they first held you prisoner. You are sure {{that you did not}} in any way disclose your identity?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{the most}} curious thing,' said Freeman to Trueman, as they {{established}} themselves under a pine tree, with an ample portion of roast meat, and armed with their traveling knives and forks, 'and the most curious <b>thing</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> say {{these people are}} Christians! Who ever heard of Christians wearing turbans?' ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{great man}} nodded. [...] "Disgraceful! I {{heard of it}} from Fletcher this morning. Captain What's-his-name had just {{reported}} himself under arrest, I understand, and Fletcher had received a note from you giving the grounds for this. The deplorable part of these <b>things</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> always happen in the most troublesome manner conceivable. In Berkeley's case the victim was a nephew of the Patriarch's. Samoval, now, was a person of even greater consequence, {{a close friend of}} several members of the Council. His death will be deeply resented, and may set up fresh difficulties. It is monstrous vexatious." [...] And abruptly he asked [...] "What did they quarrel about?" ...|$|R
60|$|The first <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{thought the}} boat was not clean. We dusted all the seats for them, and then assured them <b>that</b> it <b>was,</b> but <b>they</b> didnâ€™t believe us. One of them rubbed the cushion with the {{forefinger}} of her glove, and showed the result to the other, and they both sighed, and sat down, with the air of early Christian martyrs trying to make themselves comfortable up against the stake. You are liable to occasionally splash a little when sculling, and it appeared that {{a drop of water}} ruined those costumes. The mark never came out, and a stain was left on the dress for ever.|$|R
6000|$|... "Eh?" [...] said Pantaloon, {{and looked}} at his companions, some of the {{assurance}} beaten out of his big red face. Although the <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> one <b>that</b> <b>they</b> did habitually, to hear it called by its proper name was disconcerting.|$|R
6000|$|... "Another <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> prefer daylight, as {{they can}} then see whether any other vessel is approaching. Were one of our cruisers to hear a cannonade in the night, she would come down and take them unaware. No, I {{think you will see}} that at daylight, if the coast is clear, they will begin." ...|$|E
60|$|These {{certainly}} are imperfections; yet the astonishing <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> pass almost unnoticed in Shakespeare. He reflected his age, the evil {{and the good}} of it, just as it appeared to him; and the splendor of his representation is such that even his faults have their proper place, like shadows in a sunlit landscape.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's too {{kind of you}} to let me off that! And then I'm a {{tremendous}} fellow for reasons; that's my strong point, don't you know? I've a lot more besides those I've mentioned, done up and ready for delivery. The odd <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> don't always govern my behaviour. I rather think I do want to stand." ...|$|E
60|$|I. For the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> now, <b>they</b> are either, 1. More general: Or, 2. More particular.|$|R
5000|$|Sophists are {{considered}} the founding fathers of relativism in the Western World. Elements of relativism emerged among the Sophists in the 5th century BC. Notably, it was Protagoras who coined the phrase, [...] "Man is the measure of all things: of <b>things</b> which <b>are,</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> and of <b>things</b> which <b>are</b> not, <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not." [...] The thinking of the Sophists is mainly known through their opponents, Plato and Socrates. In a well known paraphrased dialogue with Socrates, Protagoras said: [...] "What is true for you is true for you, and what is true for me is true for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The only <b>thing,</b> sir, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{may find}} the villages empty, as they come along. The women and {{children}} will, no doubt, take to the woods. The men will, perhaps, offer some resistance; but when they find how strong the Blues are, will probably hurry to join you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, {{the creatures}} begin to stir. [...] ." [...] He watched them raise themselves, look about them, and settle down again. [...] "What I abhor most of all," [...] he concluded, [...] "is the female breast. Imagine being Venning {{and having to}} get into bed with Susan! But the really repulsive <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> feel nothing at all--about what I do when I have a hot bath. They're gross, they're absurd, they're utterly intolerable!" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{primary school}} and the {{university}} are the alpha and omega of education. Whether institutions intermediate between these (so-called secondary schools) should exist, appears {{to me to be}} a question of practical convenience. If such schools are established, the important <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> should be true intermediaries between the primary {{school and the}} university, keeping on the wide track of general culture, and not sacrificing one branch of knowledge for another.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, it on'y wants hosses an' clowns {{to make it}} all complete," [...] said Slagg. [...] "Now, that tank is 58 feet 6 {{inches in}} diameter, and 20 feet 6 inches deep, an' holds close upon 900 miles of cable. There are two other tanks not much smaller, all choke-full. An' the queer <b>thing</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> can {{telegraph}} through all its length now, at this moment as it lies there,--an' they are doing so continually to make sure that all's right." ...|$|E
50|$|One of {{the things}} that makes Hamilton Bradshaw quite unique <b>is</b> <b>that</b> unlike a lot of private equity firms...my company only invests my own money. So the good <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> when <b>they</b> work, all the return is mine. The sad <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> when they don't work, unfortunately, I lose all my money.|$|R
6000|$|... "Surely you sailormen do see strange things," [...] {{now said}} the widow, [...] "and the strangest <b>thing</b> about them <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> true." ...|$|R
500|$|On arrival, Navarre {{was shocked}} by what he found. There had been no {{long-range}} plan since de Lattre's departure. Everything was conducted on a day-to-day, reactive basis. Combat operations were undertaken only in response to enemy moves or threats. There was no comprehensive plan to develop the organization and build up the equipment of the Expeditionary force. Finally, Navarre, the intellectual, the cold and professional soldier, {{was shocked by}} the [...] "school's out" [...] attitude of Salan and his senior commanders and staff officers. They were going home, not as victors or heroes, but then, not as clear losers either. To them the important <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> getting out of Indochina with their reputations frayed, but intact. They gave little thought to, or concern for, the problems of their successors.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have heard}} of this," [...] the {{governor}} said, [...] "and regret that we shall again have the Feringhees upon us. As for the Mahrattis or the Nizam, I heed them not--they are dust, whom the sultan could sweep from his path; but these English are terrible soldiers. I have fought against them under Hyder, {{and in the last}} war they again showed their valour; and the strangest <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> make the natives under them fight as bravely as they do themselves.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{not quite}} adulatory to make a young woman the {{involuntary}} keeper of the secrets of two unreflecting young men; that is all, my good Nanny. We cannot well betray them, and we are consequently their confidants par force. The most amusing part of the <b>thing</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are masters of each other's secrets, in part at least, and feel a delightful awkwardness in a hundred instances. For my own part I pity neither, but think each is fairly enough punished. They will be fortunate if their servants do not betray them before we reach New York." ...|$|E
60|$|MY DEAR HOLMES,--My {{previous}} {{letters and}} telegrams have kept you pretty well {{up to date}} as to all that has occurred in this most God-forsaken corner of the world. The longer one stays here the more does {{the spirit of the}} moor sink into one's soul, its vastness, and also its grim charm. When you are once out upon its bosom you have left all traces of modern England behind you, {{but on the other hand}} you are conscious everywhere of the homes and the work of the prehistoric people. On all sides of you as you walk are the houses of these forgotten folk, with their graves and the huge monoliths which are supposed to have marked their temples. As you look at their gray stone huts against the scarred hill-sides you leave your own age behind you, and if you were to see a skin-clad, hairy man crawl out from the low door fitting a flint-tipped arrow on to the string of his bow, you would feel that his presence there was more natural than your own. The strange <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> should have lived so thickly on what must always have been most unfruitful soil. I am no antiquarian, but I could imagine that they were some unwarlike and harried race who were forced to accept that which none other would occupy.|$|E
5000|$|Personal {{subjective}} perceptions or judgments {{can only}} {{be said to be}} true {{at the same time in}} the same respect, in which case, the law of non-contradiction must be applicable to personal judgments.The most famous saying of Protagoras is: [...] "Man is the measure of all things: of <b>things</b> which <b>are,</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> and of <b>things</b> which <b>are</b> not, <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not". However, Protagoras <b>was</b> referring to <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> used by or in some way related to humans. This makes a great difference in the meaning of his aphorism. Properties, social entities, ideas, feelings, judgements, etc. originate in the human mind. However, Protagoras has never suggested <b>that</b> man must <b>be</b> the measure of stars, or the motion of the stars.|$|R
2500|$|Protagoras is {{credited}} with the philosophy of relativism, which he discusses in his work, Truth (also known as Refutations). Although knowledge of his work is limited, discussion of Protagoras' relativism is based {{on one of his}} most famous statements: [...] "Man is the measure of all things: of the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are,</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> of the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not, <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not." [...] By this, Protagoras meant <b>that</b> each individual <b>is</b> the measure of how <b>things</b> <b>are</b> perceived by <b>that</b> individual. Therefore, <b>things</b> <b>are,</b> or are not, true according to how the individual perceives them. For example, Person X may believe <b>that</b> the weather <b>is</b> cold, whereas Person Y may believe <b>that</b> the weather <b>is</b> hot. According to the philosophy of Protagoras, there is no absolute evaluation of the nature of a temperature because the evaluation will be relative to who is perceiving it. Therefore, to Person X, the weather is cold, whereas to Person Y, the weather is hot. This philosophy implies <b>that</b> there <b>are</b> no absolute [...] "truths". The truth, according to Protagoras, is relative, and differs according to each individual.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mary. [...] "The {{reason why}} <b>things</b> fall <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> attracted, or drawn down, by the earth. Now the earth draws the pebble. It would go {{straight}} towards it, if it could; but the string confines it, {{and so it}} can only {{go down in the}} same way that it came up; <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> by the curved line." ...|$|R
60|$|My great recent interruptions have (as you know) {{come from}} politics; not much in my line, you will say. But it is {{impossible}} to live here and not feel very sorely the consequences of the horrid white mismanagement. I tried standing by and looking on, and it became too much for me. They are such illogical fools; a logical fool in an office, with a lot of red tape, is conceivable. Furthermore, he is as much as we have any reason to expect of officials--a thoroughly common-place, unintellectual lot. But these people are wholly on wires; laying their ears down, skimming away, pausing as though shot, and presto! full spread on the other tack. I observe in the official class mostly an insane jealousy of the smallest kind, as compared to which the artist's is of a grave, modest character--the actor's, even; a desire to extend his little authority, and to relish it like a glass of wine, that is impayable. Sometimes, when I see one of these little kings strutting over one of his victories--wholly illegal, perhaps, and certain to be reversed to his shame if his superiors ever heard of it--I could weep. The strange <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have nothing else. I auscultate them in vain; no real sense of duty, no real comprehension, no real attempt to comprehend, no wish for information--you cannot offend one of them more bitterly than by offering information, though it is certain that you have more, and obvious that you have other, information than they have; and talking of policy, they could not play a better stroke than by listening to you, and it need by no means influence their action. Tenez, you know what a French post office or railway official is? That is the diplomatic card to the life. Dickens is not in it; caricature fails.|$|E

6000|$|... "That's true enough, Larry. No; {{if there}} is a suspicion, it must be from some spy in the house of one of the gentlemen I have visited. We know that the leading Catholics are all suspected, and some of the {{servants}} may have been bribed to report everything which takes place in the house. We must be very careful; and let us arrange this, Larry, that {{if there is}} trouble and we get separated, we will neither of us come back to our lodging, but will meet at that burned-out village three miles along the western road. If anything happens to me, go to the first house I went to, and see Mr. O'Brian, and tell him that I have been taken. If there is anything to be done he will do it. If not, make your way straight back to Limerick. I have told you exactly what has been arranged with people I have seen, and you can tell my father, who will report to the general. But whatever you do, don't stop here with any idea of getting me out of their hands. The most important <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> should know, at Limerick, exactly what has been arranged. If you remain here, you would almost certainly be caught also, for, as the man who has followed us will be aware that we are together, a search will at once be made for you. So mind, my orders are, that if you see I am in trouble you are at once to set out for Limerick. If you think that I may manage to get away, you are also to leave at once, but are to wait for me, for twelve hours, at the village three miles out. If I do not come {{by the end of that}} time, it will be that I have been taken, and you are to go straight on." ...|$|E

5000|$|The lyrics {{took on a}} more {{prominent}} and personal role, with Ashcroft explaining: [...] "Each song is a northern soul going through different emotions. I hear this character {{all the way through}} the record; pretty pained, then elated, then arrogant. All facets of <b>that</b> personality <b>are</b> a northern soul. That's what I am." [...] It has <b>been</b> claimed <b>that</b> many of the album's lyrics (particularly those of [...] "History") were connected to Ashcroft's split with his girlfriend, with Ashcroft himself stating: [...] "We were all working on the record and then I went off to London for about three months to sort some things out with my girlfriend at the time. Things didn't go so well, and I got really fucked up for about two of those months, both physically and mentally.
