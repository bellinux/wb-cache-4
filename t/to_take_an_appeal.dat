60|$|Your Petitioner, Joshua Gipson, respectfully {{represents}} that on {{or about}} the 21st day of December, 1850, a judgment was rendered against your Petitioner for costs, by J. C. Spugg, one of the Justices of the Peace in and for said County of Sangamon, in a suit wherein your Petitioner was plaintiff and James L. and C. B. Gerard were defendants; that said judgment was {{not the result of}} negligence on the part of your Petitioner; that said judgment, in his opinion, is unjust and erroneous in this, that the defendants were at that time and are indebted to this Petitioner in the full amount of the principal and interest of the note sued on, the principal being, as affiant remembers and believes, thirty-one dollars and eighty two cents; and that, as affiant is informed and believes, the defendants succeeded in the trial of said cause by proving old claims against your petitioner, in set-off against said note, which claims had been settled, adjusted and paid before said note was executed. Your Petitioner further states that the reasons of his not being present at said trial, as he was not, and of its not being in his power <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> <b>appeal</b> in the ordinary way, as it was not, were that your Petitioner then resided in Edgar County about one hundred and twenty miles from where defendants resided; that a very short time before the suit was commenced your Petitioner was in Sangamon County for the purpose of collecting debts due him, and with the rest, the note in question, which note had then been given more than a year, that your Petitioner then saw the defendant J. L. Gerard who is the principal in said note, and solicited payment of the same; that said defendant then made no pretense that he did not owe the same, but on the contrary expressly promised that he would come into Springfield, in a very few days and either pay the money, or give a new note, payable by the then next Christmas; that your Petitioner accordingly left said note with said J. C. Spugg, with directions to give defendant full time to pay the money or give the new note as above, and if he did neither to sue; and then affiant came home to Edgar County, not having the slightest suspicion that if suit should be brought, the defendants would make any defense whatever; and your Petitioner never did in any way learn that said suit had been commenced until more than twenty days after it had been decided against him. He therefore prays for a writ of Certiorari.|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, Vallandigham's lawyers {{appealed the}} {{military}} tribunal's decision to the Supreme Court. The Court issued a unanimous ruling in February 1864, refusing to address Vallandigham's main {{argument that the}} military tribunal lacked jurisdiction to try him. Instead, they said the Court was only authorized to take appeals as regulated by Congress - and Congress had never authorized them <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> <b>appeal</b> from a military tribunal. Accordingly, they denied Vallandigham's appeal for lack of jurisdiction.|$|E

However, Napoleon knew all too well how <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> direct <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> the people, while domesticating them, and the long period that followed discredited the process.|$|R

5000|$|Alfano {{subsequently}} {{appealed to}} the Council of State, Italy's highest administrative court. In October 2015, the Court reversed the judgement; ruling that is within the role of prefectures to ensure all public acts are legal. Thus all registrations of same-sex marriages made abroad can not be recognised in Italy and must be cancelled. Gay rights activists complained that Carlo Deodato, the Council of State judge who drafted the sentence, defines himself as [...] "Catholic, married and father of two" [...] and had already expressed his disapproval of same-sex marriage via Twitter and therefore could not be considered impartial. They promised <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> <b>appeal</b> to the European Court of Human Rights if necessary for violating the Italian Constitution.|$|E
50|$|In {{the vast}} {{majority}} of states, original jurisdiction over workers' compensation disputes has been transferred by statute from the trial courts to special administrative agencies. Within such agencies, disputes are usually handled informally by administrative law judges. <b>Appeals</b> may be <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>appeals</b> board and from there into the state court system. However, such appeals are difficult and are regarded skeptically by most state appellate courts, because the point of workers' compensation was to reduce litigation. A few states still allow the employee to initiate a lawsuit in a trial court against the employer. For example, Ohio allows appeals to go before a jury.|$|R
2500|$|On 18 May 2011, {{following}} a cold case review, {{it was announced}} that two of the original suspects, Gary Dobson and David Norris, were to stand trial for the murder in the light of [...] "new and substantial evidence" [...] becoming available. At the same time it was disclosed that Dobson's original acquittal had been quashed by the Court of <b>Appeal,</b> allowing <b>a</b> retrial <b>to</b> <b>take</b> place. Such <b>an</b> <b>appeal</b> had only become possible following the 2005 change in the law, although Dobson was not the first person to be retried for murder as a result. On 3 January 2012, Dobson and Norris were found guilty of Lawrence's murder; the pair were juveniles {{at the time of the}} crime and were sentenced to detention at Her Majesty's pleasure, equivalent to a life sentence for an adult, with minimum terms of 15 years 2 months and 14 years 3 months respectively for what the judge described as a [...] "terrible and evil crime".|$|R
5000|$|The theatre was {{acquired}} by the Wexford Festival Trust in the 1950s and gradual restoration began <b>to</b> <b>take</b> place with <b>an</b> <b>appeal</b> being launched and help provided by the Irish Tourist Board. In 1973, work was undertaken in the foyers, but another major overhaul of the Theatre was undertaken in 1987, {{although there was no}} need to miss a season as happened in 1960. A new foyer provided a more attractive entrance, extra rows of seats were cantilevered out over the back of the balcony, and many back-stage improvements were undertaken. The theatre re-opened on 5 September 1987, in time for the Festival. This reconstruction allowed the Festival's duration to be extended, and this was further helped by substantial foyer developments in 1993. Thus, the effect was a 28% increase in capacity per performance and a near doubling of seat capacity for the entire festival by the early 1990s, with sold out houses being typical.|$|R
40|$|When the Ninth Circuit {{handed down}} Witt v. Department of the Air Force, President Obama and then-Solicitor General Kagan {{declined}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> <b>appeal</b> to the Supreme Court. At the time, {{it seemed that}} most advocates of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” believed that the administration made that decision because it was afraid the Supreme Court would reverse the Ninth Circuit. If that fear was perhaps well-founded in 2009, it is certainly less so now. In the wake of SmithKline Beecham Corp. v. Abbott Laboratories, as well as recent District Court decisions, opponents of federal constitutional protection for gay people and same-sex couples must feel much less confident in their position. Circuit courts are now deeply split on the issue, and the prevailing winds are blowing west. The Ninth Circuit has not only made explicit what every reasonable observer already knew—that Romer, Lawrence, and Windsor each applied something more searching than traditional rational basis review—but it has also provided a standard with which to analyze sexual-orientation cases moving forward. To paraphrase the court, to justify intrusions into sexual privacy or disparate treatment of gay people, the state must demonstrate (1) that its actions are necessary to significantly further an important governmental interest; and (2) that no less burdensome approach is likely {{to achieve the same}} results. This seems like an eminently sensible test, and it is one that the justices would do well to adopt when this question inevitably makes its way back onto their docket...|$|E
40|$|Alternatives to {{litigation}} have blossomed {{over the}} past quarter century and include a wide variety of practices. Among those alternatives is private arbitration where the parties submit their disputes to a neutral for binding resolution in a nonjudicial setting. Among the hallmarks of the arbitration process are its flexibility, privacy and expediency. Another cornerstone of arbitration is that it offers finality, which generally translates into less time and money spent on the dispute resolution process. Even though there are clear benefits associated with arbitration, it is not the preferred method for resolving civil disputes. To the contrary, there is a perception that attorneys prefer and will recommend litigation as the dispute resolution mechanism to be employed by their clients, and that one of the leading reasons for this preference is the availability of the right <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> <b>appeal</b> should they be unsatisfied with the outcome after trial. In November 2005, approximately 400 business litigators in Southern California were surveyed to test the perception that attorneys generally prefer litigation over arbitration for the resolution of general civil disputes. The survey showed that approximately 87 percent of the responding attorneys do prefer litigation over arbitration and {{that one of the reasons}} for this preference is the availability of appellate review. The survey also asked attorneys to state any other reasons they might have for preferring litigation over arbitration. This question elicited a broad assortment of responses, which revealed bad experiences in arbitration; lack of confidence in arbitrators as decision makers; a higher level of comfort and confidence in the court system based on training and experience; and frustration with arbitrators deciding matters by “splitting the baby” and not following legal precedent. This project concludes the there are misperceptions about both the perceived shortcomings associated with arbitration and the perceived attributes associated with the litigation process and seeks to demystify the arbitration process in an effort to present the arbitral forum as a more attractive alternative to litigation...|$|E
50|$|During 1851, the Nadars {{tried to}} conduct a {{marriage}} procession {{in one of the}} four car streets, which was blocked by other castes. The Zamindar ruled that the Nadars can go up to the Pillaiyar temple in East Giri Street. There was another attempt made by the Nadars in 1866 when he District Collector negotiated a compromise by allowing Nadars to go in palanquins up to the Pillayar temple. There were further attempts in 1885, when the Zamindar sought legal action. He argued that the streets belonged to the temple and the temple reserved the right to allow religious processions to maintain the purity of the streets. The Nadars contended that the streets were public places where everyone had equal rights. The witnesses claimed that the Nadar procession never went beyond the north eastern altar in the past. There was also a contention about a Nadar owning a shop in one of the streets. During 1899, the Munisif ruled that the streets belonged to the temple. The case was <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>appeal</b> judge by the Nadars. By around this time, the Zamindar died and his juvenile heir was helped by his manager. The appeal judge ruled that the trader, Kalimuthu, who was having a house in East Car Street, recognised the rights of the temple and hence discharged the appeal. With further appeal, the Chief Justice ruled on 7 August 1899 that the temple had not dedicated the streets as public. With all legal proceedings going against them, the Nadars resorted to religious conversions to Catholics.|$|R
