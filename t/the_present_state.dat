5|$|The {{objective}} of <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>state</b> and regional {{policy is to}} carefully combine tourism development in the area with the preservation of its natural and cultural heritage. Ecotourism poses an ideal solution, since {{it has the potential}} of bringing about the desired balance between socio-economic development and environmental protection. Specific objectives of ecotourism development include reviving traditional activities such as small-scale farming and stock-raising, as well as establishing a network of communities of chamois biotopes.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{drawings}} {{described in this}} letter as showing drafts of the two new patterns, together with any royal response to the complaint which may have accompanied them, having been lost, (possibly in the 1834 Burning of Parliament), other evidence exists, at least on paper, of a Scottish variant whereby the Scottish cross appears uppermost. Whilst, {{in the absence of}} evidence to the contrary, this design is considered by most vexillologists to have been unofficial, {{there is reason to believe}} that such flags were employed during the 17th century for use on Scottish vessels at sea. This flag's design is also described in the 1704 edition of <b>The</b> <b>Present</b> <b>State</b> of the Universe by John Beaumont, Junior, which contains as an appendix The Ensigns, Colours or Flags of the Ships at Sea: Belonging to The several Princes and States in the World.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{statistical}} test to detect that a <b>presented</b> <b>state</b> of a reversible Markov chain was not chosen from a stationary distribution. In particular, given a value function {{for the states}} of the Markov chain, we would like to demonstrate rigorously that <b>the</b> <b>presented</b> <b>state</b> is an outlier with respect to the values, by establishing a $p$-value for observations we make about the state under the null hypothesis that it was chosen uniformly at random. A simple heuristic used in practice is to sample ranks of states from long random trajectories on the Markov chain, and compare these to the rank of <b>the</b> <b>presented</b> state; if <b>the</b> <b>presented</b> <b>state</b> is a $ 0. 1 \%$-outlier compared to the sampled ranks (i. e., its rank is in the bottom $ 0. 1 \%$ of sampled ranks) then this should correspond to a $p$-value of $ 0. 001 $. This test is not rigorous, however, without good bounds on the mixing time of the Markov chain, as one must argue that the observed states on the trajectory approximate the stationary distribution. Our test is the following: given <b>the</b> <b>presented</b> <b>state</b> in <b>the</b> Markov chain, take a random walk from <b>the</b> <b>presented</b> <b>state</b> for any number of steps. We prove that observing that <b>the</b> <b>presented</b> <b>state</b> is an $\varepsilon$-outlier on the walk is significant at $p=\sqrt { 2 \varepsilon}$, under the null hypothesis that the state was chosen from a stationary distribution. Our result assumes nothing about the structure of the Markov chain beyond reversibility, and we construct examples to show that significance at $p\approx\sqrt \varepsilon$ is essentially best possible in general. We illustrate the use of our test with a potential application to the rigorous detection of gerrymandering in Congressional districtings. Comment: 15 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

5|$|Owing to <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>state</b> of {{continental}} drift, the Northern Hemisphere is now fairly equally {{divided between}} {{land and sea}} (a ratio of about 2:3) but the South is overwhelmingly oceanic (1:4.7). Salinity in the open ocean is generally in a narrow band around 3.5% by mass, although this can vary in more landlocked waters, near the mouths of large rivers, or at great depths. About 85% of the solids in the open sea are sodium chloride. Deep-sea currents are produced by differences in salinity and temperature. Surface currents are formed by the friction of waves produced by the wind and by tides, the changes in local sea level produced by {{the gravity of the}} Moon and Sun. The direction of all of these is governed by surface and submarine land masses and by the rotation of the Earth (the Coriolis effect).|$|E
5|$|State Route 174 {{begins at}} exit 135 of I-80 in Colfax. Immediately after {{crossing}} I-80, the route turns right on Auburn Street and right again on Central Street, which bypasses downtown; a business route follows Auburn Street, Grass Valley Street, and Main Street through downtown. SR 174 follows the old Lincoln Highway (US 40) north out of downtown to Rollins Lake Road, where <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>state</b> highway turns northwest along the Colfax Highway. It then crosses the Bear River from Placer County into Nevada County on a 1987 bridge, {{with the old}} 1924 bridge preserved for non-motorized traffic. The land flattens out as SR 174 curves north and west through the Empire Mine State Historic Park into Grass Valley. Turning west on Colfax Avenue, the state highway passes under the SR 20/SR 49 freeway before ending just beyond at Auburn Street, the former surface routing of SR 49.|$|E
5|$|The Bayshore Freeway {{is a part}} of U.S. Route 101 (US 101) in the San Francisco Bay Area of the U.S. {{state of}} California. It runs along the west shore of the San Francisco Bay, {{connecting}} San Jose with San Francisco. Within the city of San Francisco, the freeway is also known as James Lick Freeway, named after the California philanthropist. The road was originally built as a surface road, the Bayshore Highway, and later upgraded to freeway standards. Before 1964, it was mostly marked as U.S. Route 101 Bypass, with US 101 using <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>State</b> Route 82 (El Camino Real).|$|E

5|$|The Beckwourth Trail was the {{earliest}} predecessor of SR 70, {{which was a}} spur of the California Trail. This {{was followed by the}} railroad, mostly built on the route of the trail; a dirt road was needed for construction that was later converted into part of <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>state</b> highway. Construction on the highway began in 1928, which involved the boring of three tunnels. Previously, the road was signed as U.S. Route 40 Alternate, crossing the Sierra Nevada at a lower elevation than Donner Pass on US 40, now Interstate 80 (I-80). The road was renumbered SR 70 in the 1964 state highway renumbering. Today, portions of SR 70 have been upgraded to a four-lane expressway, and even a freeway in a few locations.|$|E
5|$|UNESCO {{identified}} three {{specific areas of}} concern under <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>state</b> of conservation: (i) vandalism by visitors; (ii) soil erosion in the south-eastern part of the site; and (iii) analysis and restoration of missing elements. The soft soil, the numerous earthquakes and heavy rains lead to the destabilization of the structure. Earthquakes {{are by far the}} most important contributing factors, since not only do stones fall down and arches crumble, but the earth itself can move in waves, further destroying the structure. The increasing popularity of the stupa brings in many visitors, most of whom are from Indonesia. Despite warning signs on all levels not to touch anything, the regular transmission of warnings over loudspeakers and the presence of guards, vandalism on reliefs and statues is a common occurrence and problem, leading to further deterioration. As of 2009, there is no system in place {{to limit the number of}} visitors allowed per day or to introduce mandatory guided tours only.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. {{state of}} Alabama has 67 counties. Each county {{serves as the}} local level of {{government}} within its borders. The land enclosed by <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>state</b> borders was joined to the United States of America gradually. Following the American Revolutionary War, West Florida was ceded to Spain by treaty while the remainder was organized primarily as the Mississippi Territory, and later the Alabama Territory. The territorial assembly established {{some of the earliest}} county divisions that have survived to the present, including the earliest county formation, that of Washington County, created on June 4, 1800. In 1814, the Treaty of Fort Jackson opened the territory to American settlers, which in turn led to a more rapid rate of county creation. Alabama was admitted to the Union as the 22nd state in 1819. The Alabama state legislature formed additional counties from former native lands as the Indian Removal Act took effect and settlers populated different areas of Alabama. In 1820, Alabama had 29 counties. By 1830 there were 36 and Native Americans still occupied large areas of land in northeast and far western Alabama. By 1840, 49 counties had been created; 52 by 1850; 65 by 1870; and the present 67 counties by 1903. Houston County was the last county created in the state, on February 9, 1903.|$|E
