40|$|Nonequilibrium {{condensate}} {{systems such}} as exciton-polariton condensates are capable of supporting a spontaneous vortex nucleation. The spatial inhomogeneity of pumping field or/and disordered potential creates velocity flow fields that may become unstable to vortex formation. This letter considers ways in which turbulent states of interacting vortices can be created. It is shown that by combining just two pumping intensities {{it is possible to}} create a superfluid <b>turbulence</b> <b>state</b> of well-separated vortices, a strong <b>turbulence</b> <b>state</b> of de-structured vortices, or a weak <b>turbulence</b> <b>state</b> in which all coherence of the field is lost and motion is driven by weakly interacting dispersive waves. The decay of turbulence can be obtained by replacing an inhomogeneous pumping by a uniform one. We show that both in quasi-equilibrium and during the turbulence decay there exists an inertial range dominated by four-wave interactions of acoustic waves. Comment: 4. 3 pages, 4 figure...|$|E

40|$|Free space optical {{communication}} {{through the atmosphere}} {{has the potential to}} provide secure, low-cost, rapidly deployable, dynamic, data transmission at very high rates. However, the deleterious e ects of turbulence can severely limit the utility of such a system, causing outages of up to 100 ms. For this thesis, we investigate an architecture that uses multiple transmitters and multiple coherent receivers to overcome these turbulence-induced outages. By controlling the amplitude and phase of the optical eld at each transmitter, based on <b>turbulence</b> <b>state</b> information fed back from the receiver, we show that the system performance is greatly increased by exploiting the instantaneous structure of the turbulence. This architecture provides a robust highcapacity free-space {{optical communication}} link over multiple spectral bands, from visible to infrared. We aim to answer questions germane to the design and implementation of the diversity optical communication architecture in a turbulent environment. We analyze several di erent optical eld spatial modulation techniques, each of which is based on a di erent assumption about the quality of <b>turbulence</b> <b>state</b> information at the transmitter. For example, we explore a diversity optical system with perfect <b>turbulence</b> <b>state</b> information at the transmitter and receiver that allocates transmit power into the spatial modes with the smallest propagation losses in order to decrease bit errors and mitigate turbulence-induced outages. Another example of a diversity optical system that we examine is a diversity optical system with only a subset of the <b>turbulence</b> <b>state</b> information: this system could allocate all power to the transmitter with the smallest attenuation. We characterize the system performance for the various spatial modulation techniques in terms of average bit error rate (BER), outage probability, and power gain due to diversity. We rst characterize the performance of these techniques in the idealized case, where the instantaneous channel state is perfectly known at both the receiver and transmitter. The time evolution of the atmosphere, as wind moves tur- 3 bules across the propagation path, can limit the ability to have perfect <b>turbulence</b> <b>state</b> knowledge at the transmitter and, thus can limit any improvement realized by optical eld spatial modulation techniques. The improvement is especially limited if the latency is large or the feedback rate is short compared to the time it takes for turbules to move across the link. As a result, we make successive generalizations, until we describe the optimal system design and communication techniques for sparse aperture systems for the most general realistic case, one with inhomogeneous turbulence and imperfect (delayed, noisy, and distorted) knowledge of the atmospheric state.

40|$|We {{consider}} phase turbulent regimes with nonzero winding {{number in}} the one-dimensional complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. We find that phase turbulent states with winding number larger than a critical one are only transients and decay to states within a range of allowed winding numbers. The analogy with the Eckhaus instability for nonturbulent waves is stressed. The transition from phase to defect turbulence is interpreted as an ergodicity breaking transition that occurs when the range of allowed winding numbers vanishes. We explain the states reached at long times in terms of three basic states, namely, quasiperiodic <b>states,</b> frozen <b>turbulence</b> <b>states,</b> and riding <b>turbulence</b> <b>states.</b> Justification and some insight into them are obtained from an analysis of a phase equation for nonzero winding number: Rigidly moving solutions of this equation, which correspond to quasiperiodic and frozen <b>turbulence</b> <b>states,</b> are {{understood in terms of}} periodic and chaotic solutions of an associated system of ordinary differential equations.

Our single-cell study shows that (1) the myocyte-fibroblast (MF) coupling G(j) and (2) the number N-f of fibroblasts in an MF unit lower the steepness of the APDR slope and eliminate the EAD behaviors of myocytes; we explore the pacing dependence of such EAD suppression. In our 2 D simulations, we observe that a spiral-turbulence (ST) state evolves into a state with a single, rotating spiral (RS) if either (a) G(j) is large or (b) the maximum possible number of fibroblasts per myocyte N-f(max) is large. We also observe that the minimum value of G(j), for {{the transition from the}} ST to the RS state, decreases as N-f(max) increases. We find that, for the steep-APDR-induced ST state, once the MF coupling suppresses ST, the rotation period of a spiral in the RS state increases as (1) G(j) increases, with fixed N-f(max), and (2) N-f(max) increases, with fixed G(j). We obtain the boundary between ST and RS stability regions in the N-f(max) -G(j) plane. In particular, for low values of N-f(max), the value of G(j), at the ST-RS boundary, depends on the realization of the randomly distributed fibroblasts; this dependence decreases as N-f(max) increases. Our 3 D studies show a similar transition from scroll-wave turbulence to a single, rotating, scroll-wave state because of the MF coupling.

40|$|Abstract—Turbulence of the {{incoming}} wind field {{is of paramount importance}} to the dynamic response of civil engineering structures. Hence reliable stochastic models of the turbulence should be available from which time series can be generated for dynamic response and structural safety analysis. In the paper an empirical cross spectral density function for the along-wind turbulence component over the wind field area is taken as the starting point. The spectrum is spatially discretized in terms of a Hermitian cross-spectral density matrix for the <b>turbulence</b> <b>state</b> vector which turns out not to be positive definite. Since the succeeding state space and ARMA modelling of the turbulence rely on the positive definiteness of the cross-spectral density matrix, the problem with the non-positive definiteness of such matrices is at first addressed and suitable treatments regarding it are proposed. From the adjusted positive definite cross-spectral density matrix a frequency response matrix is constructed which determines the turbulence vector as a linear filtration of Gaussian white noise. Finally, an accurate state space modelling method is proposed which allows selection of an appropriate model order, and estimation of a state space model for the vector turbulence process incorporating its phase spectrum in one stage, and its results are compared with a conventional ARMA modelling method.

40|$|Magnetic {{reconnection}} is {{a process}} of magnetic field topology change, {{which is one of the}} most fundamental processes in magnetized plasmas. In most astrophysical environments the Reynolds numbers are large and therefore the transition to turbulence is inevitable. This turbulence must be taken into account for any theory of magnetic reconnection, since the initially laminar configurations can transit to the <b>turbulence</b> <b>state,</b> what is demonstrated by 3 D high resolution numerical simulations. We discuss ideas of how turbulence can modify reconnection with the focus on the Lazarian & Vishniac (1999) reconnection model and present numerical evidence supporting the model and demonstrate that it is closely connected to the concept of Richardson diffusion and compatible with the Lagrangian dynamics of magnetized fluids. We point out that the Generalized Ohm's Law, that accounts for turbulent motion, predicts the subdominance of the microphysical plasma effects for a realistically turbulent media. We show that on of the most dramatic consequences of turbulence is the violation of the generally accepted notion of magnetic flux freezing. This notion is a corner stone of most theories dealing with magnetized plasmas and therefore its change induces fundamental shifts in accepted paradigms like turbulent reconnection entailing the diffusion process that is essential for understanding star formation. We argue, that at sufficiently high Reynolds numbers the process of tearing reconnection should transfer to turbulent reconnection. We discuss flares predicted by turbulent reconnection and relate them to solar flares and gamma ray bursts. We analyze solar observations, measurements in the solar wind or heliospheric current sheet, and show their correspondence with turbulent reconnection predictions.

The robustness of this result suggests why some predictions of WKB theory are apparently correct in solar wind conditions where the theory is not expected to be valid...|$|R
40|$|The first spherical {{accretion}} {{model was}} developed 55 years ago, but {{the theory is}} yet far from being complete. The real accretion flow {{was found to be}} time-dependent and turbulent. This paper presents the minimal MHD spherical accretion model that separately deals with turbulence. Treatment of turbulence is based on simulations of several regimes of collisional MHD. The effects of freezing-in amplification, dissipation, dynamo action, isotropization, and constant magnetic helicity are self-consistently included. The assumptions of equipartition and magnetic field isotropy are released. Correct dynamics of magnetized flow is calculated. Diffusion, convection, and radiation are not accounted for. Two different types of Radiatively Inefficient accretion flows are found: a transonic non-rotating flow (I), a flow with effective transport of angular momentum outward (II). Non-rotating flow has an accretion rate several times smaller than Bondi rate, because turbulence inhibits accretion. Flow with angular momentum transport has accretion rate about 10 - 100 times smaller than Bondi rate. The effects of highly helical <b>turbulence,</b> <b>states</b> of outer magnetization, and different equations of state are discussed. The flows were found to be convectively stable on average, despite gas entropy increases inward. The proposed model has a small number of free parameters and the following attractive property. Inner density in the non-rotating magnetized flow was found to be several times lower than density in a non-magnetized accretion. Still several times lower density is required to explain the observed low IR luminosity and low Faraday rotation measure of accretion onto Sgr A*.
