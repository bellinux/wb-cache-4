40|$|It {{is known}} that the {{commonly}} used performance indicator for vibration isolation - force transmissibility - over-simplifies the vibration problem. Therefore, Mak and Su propose a power transmissibility approach that includes the effect of floor dynamics and the interactions of the mounting points between machine and floor. However, their model does not consider <b>transient</b> <b>vibration</b> excitation. The question motivating {{this study is the}} occasional problem which arises due to the sudden or frequent starting and stopping of vibratory machines. In this paper, a transient power transmissibility approach is proposed to assess the performance of isolators in a <b>transient</b> <b>vibration</b> excitation. A spring-mass-movable floor system is considered in the simulation, and the spring isolator is first selected using the steady-state power transmissibility approach of Mak and Su. A system disturbed by two transient excitations as typically experienced by building services equipment is then analyzed. The results indicate the necessity of using transient power transmissibility in the selection of isolators for a <b>transient</b> <b>vibration.</b> Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|E

The study used steering wheel tangential direction acceleration time histories which had been measured in a mid-sized European automobile that was driven over three different types of road surface.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{presents}} {{a new type}} of a MR damper designed for an integrated isolation mount for an ultraprecision manufacturing system. The vibration sources of the ultraprecision system can be classified as two: one is environmental vibration from the floor, and the other is <b>transient</b> <b>vibration</b> occurred from the stage movement. The <b>transient</b> <b>vibration</b> occurred from the stage movement has adverse effect to the manufacturing process because the vibration scale is quite larger than other vibrations. It is also known that the moving stage needs to be isolated from tiny vibrations to be occurred from the floor. Therefore, in this research in order to attenuate both the transient and tiny vibrations, {{a new type of}} MR damper is proposed and its performance is evaluated. The proposed MR damper can eliminate a dry friction of the damper to remove the tiny vibration as well as can produce enough damping force to attenuate the <b>transient</b> <b>vibration.</b> The MR damper is designed on the basis of Bingham model of a MR fluid and manufactured. Subsequently, the field-dependent damping force characteristics of the MR damper are evaluated through simulation and experiment. In addition, vibration control performance of the proposed MR damper is evaluated by integrating the damper with a 2 degree of freedom (DOF) stage model. In this evaluation, both transient and sinusoidal vibrations are controlled by adopting both a skyhook controller and a sliding mode controller.

40|$|Abstract In this paper, {{within the}} {{displacement}} {{field of the}} first-order shear-thickness deformation theory (FSDT), transient vibrations of rectangular cross-ply composite plates are studied and dynamic interlaminar stresses are obtained. In the theoretical formulations the effects of all the rotational inertia terms are considered. Also {{the change in the}} plate thickness is taken into account due to its important role in the edge effects. The equations of motion are derived by using Hamilton’s principle. It is assumed that the plates have two simply supported opposite edges and the remaining boundary conditions are arbitrary. The obtained equations are solved analytically using Levy’s formulations, the orthogonality relation, and Laplace transform. The function of time is obtained using the results of free vibration and convolution integral. First, time responses are obtained for the case of <b>transient</b> <b>vibration</b> and then the interlaminar stresses are determined by integrating the three-dimensional local equations of motion and utilizing given boundary conditions.

40|$|Abstract. Many {{balancing}} {{devices have}} been created to reduce machinery vibration especially in a high-speed rotor system which is very sensitive to the rotating mass unbalance. The best solution is that this device can self-perceive vibration changes and then respond these changes in an optimized way according to the different situations, which means it is a self-recovery system. According to this consideration, an electromagnetic driven bi-disc compensator for rotor auto-balancing is proposed here. In this system, rotor unbalance is online identified and calculated, after that the balancing discs will be driven to the best compensating positions, so that the unbalance can be suppressed or eliminated. Long transition time and <b>transient</b> <b>vibration</b> enhancement are terrible roadblocks which limit the industry applications of such auto-balancing system. To solve these deficiencies, a freely rotation bi-disc strategy was established and the solutions of two special cases were also discussed. A rotor auto-balancing test rig was build up.

Additionally, the relation between the subjective responses and the dynamic responses has also been studied. Twelve subjects were exposed to sinusoidal continuous vibrations at five frequencies (3. 15 – 8. 0 Hz) and at three magnitudes (0. 5 – 2. 0 m s? 2 rms). They were also exposed to <b>transient</b> <b>vibrations</b> that were modulated one-and-half cycle sinusoidal waveforms at the same frequencies as the continuous vibrations and at three magnitudes corresponding to the magnitudes used for the continuous vibrations. Discomfort was measured by the method of magnitude estimation with reference stimuli having frequency components {{in the middle of the}} frequency range used in this study. The driving-point dynamic responses (the ratio between the force and the motion, i. e., acceleration and velocity, at the driving point) were also measured and divided by the responses to the reference stimuli used in the measurement of discomfort so as to allow the comparison of the dynamic responses with the discomfort responses. Both the discomfort estimates and the normalised driving-point dynamic responses were influenced by the stimuli magnitudes, especially with the continuous vibration. At 3. 15 and 4. 0 Hz, the discomfort estimates and the normalised mechanical impedance and apparent mass increased significantly with increases in vibration magnitude from 0. 5 – 2. 0 m s? 2 rms. Magnitude estimates for discomfort were correlated with the normalised mechanical impedance and apparent mass in the frequency range investigated. For the <b>transient</b> <b>vibrations,</b> the discomfort estimates and the driving-point dynamic responses were interpreted as responses in frequency bands around the fundamental frequency of the input motion. The results indicate similar nonlinearities in discomfort and driving-point dynamic responses associated with the principal body response within the range 3. 15 – 8 Hz. The nonlinearity in discomfort at these frequencies may be partially caused by the nonlinear dynamic response of the body and is sufficient to require consideration in methods of predicting discomfort caused by vertical whole-body vibration...|$|R
