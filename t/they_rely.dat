5|$|A {{strategy}} {{for dealing with}} seasonal plenty is to eat {{as much as possible}} and store the surplus nutrients as fat. Marmots do this, and may be 50% heavier in the autumn than in the spring. <b>They</b> <b>rely</b> on their fat reserves during their long winter hibernation. Beavers feed on the leaves, buds, and inner bark of growing trees, as well as aquatic plants. They store food for winter use by felling small trees and leafy branches in the autumn and immersing them in their pond, sticking the ends into the mud to anchor them. Here, they can access their food supply underwater even when their pond is frozen over.|$|E
5|$|Assessments of {{the mating}} system {{of this species}} have found that outcrossing rates vary between populations, with populations in {{disturbed}} environments tending to be more inbred than populations in relatively intact bushland. This {{has been attributed to}} a range of causes. Firstly, the higher density of disturbed populations leads to greater rates of mating between neighbouring plants, resulting in more genetic structure and thus more effective selfing. Secondly, disturbed populations usually lack an understorey, and so cannot support a resident population of honeyeaters; instead, <b>they</b> <b>rely</b> upon sporadic visits for pollination. The greatly reduced pollination rates means fewer outcrossing fertilisations on average, leading to less selection against inbred fertilisations.|$|E
5|$|Insects {{and other}} {{invertebrates}} {{are a major}} portion of the nuthatch diet, especially during the breeding season, when <b>they</b> <b>rely</b> almost exclusively on live prey, but most species also eat seeds during the winter, when invertebrates are less readily available. Larger food items, such as big insects, snails, acorns or seeds may be wedged into cracks and pounded with the bird's strong bill. Unusually for a bird, the brown-headed nuthatch uses a piece of tree bark as a lever to pry up other bark flakes to look for food; the bark tool may then be carried from tree to tree or used to cover a seed cache.|$|E

5|$|The {{nature of}} the work carried out by {{accountants}} and auditors requires a high level of ethics. Shareholders, potential shareholders, and other users of the financial statements rely heavily on the yearly financial statements of a company as they can use this information to make an informed decision about investment. <b>They</b> <b>rely</b> on the opinion of the accountants who prepared the statements, as well as the auditors that verified it, to present a true and fair view of the company. Knowledge of ethics can help accountants and auditors to overcome ethical dilemmas, allowing for the right choice that, although it may not benefit the company, will benefit the public who relies on the accountant/auditor's reporting.|$|E
5|$|There {{are eight}} {{distinct}} call types made by Sunda slow loris adults, {{which can be}} divided into two categories: contact and contact-seeking calls such as whistles and short keckers (a social play and attention-seeking call), and aggressive and defensive calls such as long keckers, screams, snarls and grunts. Because <b>they</b> <b>rely</b> on crypsis to avoid predators, they do not make alarm calls. Infants emits clicks and squeaks when disturbed. During estrus, females make whistle calls when in visual contact with a male. When exploring new environments and during handling, it makes ultrasonic vocalisations out of the human hearing range.|$|E
5|$|Assessments of {{the mating}} system {{of this species}} have found that outcrossing rates vary between populations. Populations in {{relatively}} intact bushland have high outcrossing rates, but those in more disturbed environments are both more inbred on average, and more variable. This {{has been attributed to}} a range of causes. Firstly, the higher density of disturbed populations leads to greater rates of mating between neighbouring plants, resulting in more genetic structure and thus more effective selfing. Secondly, disturbed populations usually lack an understorey, and so cannot support a resident population of honeyeaters; instead, <b>they</b> <b>rely</b> upon occasional visitors for pollination. The greatly reduced pollination rates means fewer outcrossing fertilisations on average, leading to less selection against inbred fertilisations; and the sporadic presence of pollinators leads to outcrossing variability.|$|E

40|$|Objective. American {{parents were}} {{surveyed}} to isolate demographic factors that predict reliance on a pediatrician, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), or both for media guidance. We then investigated whether reliance on these resources resulted in different media practices with children. Methods. A nationally representative {{survey was conducted}} (n = 1454). Parents were asked what medical professionals <b>they</b> <b>relied</b> on for advice and reported relevant home media practices related to their child. Results. In all, 29 % reported relying on their pediatrician, 24. 9 % said that <b>they</b> <b>relied</b> on the AAP, and 14. 9 % of all parents said <b>they</b> <b>relied</b> on both. Those following the AAP’s media guidelines {{were more likely to}} prohibit bedroom television and to follow all guidelines. Conclusions. The relatively low reliance on the AAP and pediatricians for media guidance suggest that more outreach is necessary. However, parents who report relying on the AAP for advice are more likely to enact these recommendations...|$|R
5|$|Dead reckoning, {{navigating}} from a known position {{using only}} information about one's own speed and direction, was suggested by Charles Darwin in 1873 {{as a possible}} mechanism. In the 20th century, Karl von Frisch showed that honey bees can navigate by the sun, by the polarization pattern of the blue sky, and by the earth's magnetic field; of these, <b>they</b> <b>rely</b> on the sun when possible. William Tinsley Keeton showed that homing pigeons could similarly make use {{of a range of}} navigational cues, including the sun, earth's magnetic field, olfaction and vision. Ronald Lockley demonstrated that a species of small seabird, the Manx shearwater, could orient themselves and fly home at full speed, when released far from home, provided either the sun or the stars were visible.|$|E
5|$|Inoculation, {{treatment}} of smallpox: Joseph Needham states that {{a case of}} inoculation for smallpox may have existed in the late 10th century during the Song Dynasty (960–1279), yet <b>they</b> <b>rely</b> on a book Zhongdou xinfa (種痘心法) written in 1808 by Zhu Yiliang for this evidence. Wan Quan (1499–1582) wrote the first clear reference to smallpox inoculation in his Douzhen xinfa (痘疹心法) of 1549. The process of inoculation was also vividly described by Yu Chang in his Yuyi cao (寓意草), or Notes on My Judgment published in 1643, and Zhang Yan in his Zhongdou xinshu (種痘新書), or New book on smallpox inoculation in 1741. As written by Yu Tianchi in his Shadou jijie (痧痘集解) of 1727, {{which was based on}} Wang Zhangren's Douzhen jinjing lu (痘疹金鏡錄) of 1579, the technique of inoculation to avoid smallpox was not widespread in China until the reign of the Longqing Emperor (r. 1567– 1572) during the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644).|$|E
5|$|The eyes of terns cannot {{accommodate}} under water, so <b>they</b> <b>rely</b> on accurate sighting {{from the}} air before they plunge-dive. Like other seabirds that feed at the surface or dive for food, terns have red oil droplets in the cones of their retinas; birds that have to look through an air/water interface have more deeply coloured carotenoid pigments in the oil drops than other species. The pigment also improves visual contrast and sharpens distance vision, especially in hazy conditions, and helps terns to locate shoals of fish, although it is uncertain whether they are sighting the phytoplankton on which the fish feed, or other feeding birds. The red colouring reduces ultraviolet sensitivity, which in any case is an adaptation more suited to terrestrial feeders like the gulls, and this protects the eye from UV damage.|$|E

5|$|The top 10% paid 51.8% {{of total}} federal taxes in 2009, {{and the top}} 1%, with 13.4% of pre-tax {{national}} income, paid 22.3% of federal taxes. In 2013 the Tax Policy Center projected total federal effective tax rates of 35.5% for the top 1%, 27.2% for the top quintile, 13.8% for the middle quintile, and −2.7% for the bottom quintile. The incidence of corporate income tax has {{been a matter of}} considerable ongoing controversy for decades. State and local taxes vary widely, but are generally less progressive than federal taxes as <b>they</b> <b>rely</b> heavily on broadly borne regressive sales and property taxes that yield less volatile revenue streams, though their consideration does not eliminate the progressive nature of overall taxation.|$|E
5|$|Foraging {{behaviour}} {{depends on}} the type of termite. For example, certain species feed on the wood structures they inhabit, and others harvest food that is near the nest. Most workers are rarely found out in the open, and do not forage unprotected; <b>they</b> <b>rely</b> on sheeting and runways to protect them from predators. Subterranean termites construct tunnels and galleries to look for food, and workers who manage to find food sources recruit additional nestmates by depositing a phagostimulant pheromone that attracts workers. Foraging workers use semiochemicals to communicate with each other, and workers who begin to forage outside of their nest release trail pheromones from their sternal glands. In one species, Nasutitermes costalis, there are three phases in a foraging expedition: first, soldiers scout an area. When they find a food source, they communicate to other soldiers and a small force of workers starts to emerge. In the second phase, workers appear in large numbers at the site. The third phase is marked by a {{decrease in the number of}} soldiers present and an increase in the number of workers. Isolated termite workers may engage in Lévy flight behaviour as an optimised strategy for finding their nestmates or foraging for food.|$|E
5|$|Termites are detritivores, {{consuming}} dead {{plants at}} any level of decomposition. They also {{play a vital role}} in the ecosystem by recycling waste material such as dead wood, faeces and plants. Many species eat cellulose, having a specialised midgut that breaks down the fibre. Termites are considered to be a major source (11%) of atmospheric methane, one of the prime greenhouse gases, produced from the breakdown of cellulose. Termites rely primarily upon symbiotic protozoa (metamonads) and other microbes such as flagellate protists in their guts to digest the cellulose for them, allowing them to absorb the end products for their own use. Gut protozoa, such as Trichonympha, in turn, rely on symbiotic bacteria embedded on their surfaces to produce some of the necessary digestive enzymes. Most higher termites, especially in the family Termitidae, can produce their own cellulase enzymes, but <b>they</b> <b>rely</b> primarily upon the bacteria. The flagellates have been lost in Termitidae. Scientists' understanding of the relationship between the termite digestive tract and the microbial endosymbionts is still rudimentary; what is true in all termite species, however, is that the workers feed the other members of the colony with substances derived from the digestion of plant material, either from the mouth or anus. Judging from closely related bacterial species, it is strongly presumed that the termites' and cockroach's gut microbiota derives from their dictyopteran ancestors.|$|E

5|$|The green-head ant is a diurnal {{species that}} is active {{throughout}} the day, quickly foraging {{on either the}} ground or vegetation. They are scavengers, predators and seed-eaters, generally having a broad diet of animal material, insects, small arthropods, honeydew from sap-sucking insects and seeds. The workers usually prey on beetles, moths and termites, using their stingers to kill them by injecting venom. The removal of the capitula (structure similar to an elaiosome) from Eurycnema goliath eggs reduces the chances of them being collected by green-head ants that carry them back into their nests. In areas where the meat ant (Iridomyrmex purpureus) is dominant, the green-head ant is not affected by its presence and is still successful in finding food sources. As green-head ants are primitive general predators, {{in contrast to the}} more advanced species (which forage in groups and always communicate via trail pheromones), they are unable to defend food sources from dominant ants. <b>They</b> <b>rely</b> heavily on any food source, and the impossibility of successfully defending it from other ants may have led to their peaceful coexistence with dominant species, including meat ants.|$|E
5|$|The {{pharyngeal}} jaws of teleosts, {{a second}} set of jaws contained within the throat, are composed of five branchial arches, loops of bone which support the gills. The first three arches include a single basibranchial surrounded by two hypobranchials, ceratobranchials, epibranchials and pharyngobranchials. The median basibranchial is covered by a toothplate. The fourth arch is composed of pairs of ceratobranchials and epibranchials, and sometimes additionally, some pharyngobranchials and a basibranchial. The base of the lower pharyngeal jaws is formed by the fifth ceratobranchials while the second, third and fourth pharyngobranchials create the base of the upper. In the more basal teleosts the pharyngeal jaws consist of well-separated thin parts that attach to the neurocranium, pectoral girdle, and hyoid bar. Their function is limited to merely transporting food, and <b>they</b> <b>rely</b> mostly on lower pharyngeal jaw activity. In more derived teleosts the jaws are more powerful, with left and right ceratobranchials fusing to become one lower jaw; the pharyngobranchials fuse to create a large upper jaw that articulates with the neurocranium. They have also developed a muscle that allows the pharyngeal jaws to have a role in grinding food in addition to transporting it.|$|E
