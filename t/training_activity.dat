For graduates of the ARM Secondary Schools who volunteered for submarine service, there was advanced maintenance training in radar, sonar, and other electronic equipment at the Submarine School, Submarine Base, New London, Connecticut. The New London school also had courses for Officers; this <b>training</b> <b>activity</b> was initially started by Lieutenant William C. Eddy in the early 1930s. For upgrading technicians already in fleet service, there were radar schools at the Naval Air Station, San Diego, California, and the Naval Operating Base, Norfolk, Virginia. The San Diego school was the Airborne Radar School, Fleet Air West Coast. Two schools were at Norfolk: the Radar Materiel School on the Main Base, and the Fleet Service School at nearby Virginia Beach, Virginia. At Pearl Harbor Naval Base, there was a Fleet Service School that gave a three-month radar maintenance course.|$|E

The types and breadth of protocols and <b>training</b> <b>activities</b> varied by campus and included emergency medical care, hospitalizations, students 2 ̆ 7 return to the residence halls, mandated evaluations, withdrawals, {{and the use of the}} student discipline system. ^ This study further revealed that the state colleges reported that the elements of federal and state laws, as well as court opinions, were included in response protocols and <b>training</b> <b>activities.</b> ^ This study found that <b>training</b> <b>activities</b> were offered in varying degrees at the state colleges that participated in the study. Significant training was offered to student resident assistants, but faculty and staff did not participate in training programs to the same extent as students. ^ This study found that communication among individuals involved in developing, approving, implementing, and evaluating protocols was key to successful interventions. ^ From the study, the researcher recommended three topics for further study. They included a study of best practice collaborations between hospitals and colleges, a study of the emerging pattern of high school violence and school responses and <b>training</b> <b>activities,</b> and a study of legal issues surrounding the disruptive behavior of students with psychological problems. ...|$|R
500|$|In a {{year after}} opening the new campus, the {{university}} had about 2,500 students. [...] As World War II approached, enrollment decreased due to the draft and enlistments. The university proposed {{to be in a}} new, highly unusual <b>training</b> <b>activity</b> of the United States Navy, and was one of six institutions selected to give the Primary School in the Electronics Training Program. [...] By the fall of 1943, there were only about 1,100 regular students at UH; thus, the 300 or so servicemen contributed in sustaining the faculty and facilities of the Engineering College. This training at UH continued until March 1945, with a total of 4,178 students.|$|E
500|$|Flying {{schools are}} {{commercial}} businesses {{engaged in the}} training of pilots, both for recreational purposes and for those intending to fly professionally. They make widespread use of fixed-wing light aircraft associated with traditional GA, not only for flying lessons but also as club aircraft rented out to qualified pilots for recreational flights. School-owned aircraft account for {{a significant amount of}} GA activity, both in terms of hours flown and aircraft movements. The pilot training element is regarded by the GA community as a key benefit that is critical to the supply of pilots for the airline industry. It is claimed by the General Aviation Awareness Council that 60–70 per cent of professional pilots have self-financed their flight training at GA schools, and one UK airline operator has stated that the industry must rely on 70–80 per cent of new pilots coming from the GA sector. The CAA estimates that between 1996 and 2006 the number of new professional pilots following the unsponsored training route rose from 48 per cent to 59 per cent. The counter argument to this claim is that pilots can be trained outside of the UK, and that the airline industry is not therefore dependent on a healthy GA sector in the UK for its supply of pilots. The CAA concludes that a severe reduction in GA would give [...] "some merit to the argument that pilot recruitment would be threatened", but that the data on flying hours [...] "does not support such a gloomy outlook." [...] Of course, reliance on other countries for pilot training means that the UK foregoes the economic benefit of the <b>training</b> <b>activity.</b>|$|E

40|$|Many {{empirical}} studies consider either <b>training</b> <b>activities</b> of the unemployed or <b>training</b> <b>activities</b> {{of the employees}} in Germany. However, a comprehensive comparison of both groups is missing. The paper closes this gap. Using data of the latest time use survey (Zeitbudgeterhebung) of the Federal Statistical Office, the amount of training is compared for both groups. Furthermore, it is described which types of activities are made use of in particular. Heterogeneity due to different relevant socioeconomic characteristics {{in the two groups}} is eliminated by the appliance of a matching procedure. Findings demonstrate that only 49 % of the unemployed persons participate in any kind of <b>training</b> <b>activities</b> off the job. In case of the full-time employment 59 % would take part. Concerning the average expenditure of time per week the difference turns around, i. e. the expenditure of time is higher during unemployment. However, a high proportion of the <b>training</b> <b>activities</b> of the unemployed falls upon general training, e. g. by reading books or watching TV. Furthermore, the result is driven by a different potential of time {{that can be used for}} <b>training</b> <b>activities</b> off the job.

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of [...] World War II, Oklahoma A was one of six schools selected by the United States Navy to give the Primary School in the Electronics Training Program (ETP), also known as Naval Training School Elementary Electricity and Radio Materiel (NTS EE). Starting in March 1942, each month {{a new group of}} 100 Navy students arrived for three months of 14-hour days in concentrated electrical engineering study. Cordell Hall, the newest dormitory, was used for housing and meals; lectures and lab sessions were held in the Engineering Building. Professor Emory B. Phillips was the Director of Instruction. ETP admission required passing the Eddy Test, one of the most selective qualifying exams given during the war years. At a given time, some 500 Navy students were on the campus, a significant fraction of the war-years enrollment. The <b>training</b> <b>activity</b> continued until June 1945, and served a total of about 7,000 students; among these was Robert B. Kamm, a future professor and president of Oklahoma State University. During some of the war years, the Navy also had a Yeoman <b>training</b> <b>activity</b> for WAVES and SPARS on the campus.|$|E

The [...] rollout began at 02:07 EDT, and ended with the launch {{platform}} secured in place at about 13:50 EDT. The move took longer than expected due to adverse weather conditions, which included lightning warnings. The crawler also had to pause occasionally so mud could be removed from its treads and bearings. Technicians then quickly prepared the shuttle to host the crew’s countdown dress rehearsal known as the Terminal Countdown Demonstration Test (TCDT). Discovery’s seven astronauts flew to Kennedy on 5 August 2009 for the <b>training</b> <b>activity</b> which concludes later in the week with a complete practice countdown, minus liftoff, involving the crew and the launch team. Meanwhile, in an unprecedented operation, modifications were made to the left Solid rocket booster on the pad. The modifications involved replacement of a check valve filter assembly in the booster which was found to have broken. In a potentially delaying factor, in depth testing of the external tank with X-ray revealed voids in the foam which might have formed during the injection molding of the foam. This has also been decided as a suspect factor in the foam shedding during STS-127. The air in the voids could have expanded due to the high temperatures generated during ascent thus breaking the foam. The reviews considered a rollback as an option since the defect could not be set right in the pad. Later, the tank was cleared for launch as is without any additional inspections.|$|E
