5|$|Rusty, a house cat, {{runs into}} a ThunderClan apprentice, Graypaw, {{in the forest}} in his backyard. Rusty, however, does not run away, but fights back. Bluestar and Lionheart, Graypaw's mentor, having watched the confrontation, invite Rusty to join ThunderClan. Rusty asks to <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>over,</b> and after talking it over with his best friend and {{neighbor}} Smudge, decides {{to go with the}} Clan cats. Lionheart and Whitestorm meet him the next day and lead him to the camp. Due to his house cat past, some members of the Clan are hostile towards Rusty. This hostility eventually leads Rusty to attack Longtail, losing his collar in the ensuing fight. Bluestar then ends the fight and announces that Rusty has earned his Clan name, Firepaw. He forms a strong bond with Graypaw, and with Ravenpaw, an apprentice to the ambitious warrior Tigerclaw.|$|E
25|$|While {{both were}} important, Sasun Eff was {{absolutely}} essential. His refusal would damn the Cabinet as a Talib ministry and doom it to failure from the outset. I left my {{cup of tea}} undrunk and rushed {{back to the office}} to tell Mr Philby. He wasn't there, but there was a light in Sir Percy's room. I went in and told him. He bade me go at once to Sasun Eff and charged me to make him change his mind. I set off feeling as if I carried the future of the 'Iraq in my hands, but when I got to Sasun's house to my immense relief I found Mr Philby and Capt Clayton already there. The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. I arrived, however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision. I think my immense anxiety must have inspired me for after an hour of concentrated argument he was visibly shaken, {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother Sha'al (whom I also admire and respect) came in and did his best against us. Finally however we persuaded him that Sir Percy had no desire to thrust Talib or anyone else upon Mesopotamia, but that Talib like everyone else must be given his chance. If he proved valuable he would take his part in the foundation of national institutions, if not he was politically a dead man. We got Sasun Eff to consent to <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> and to come and see Sir Percy next day. I had an inner conviction that the game was won—partly, thank heaven, to the relations of trust and confidence which I personally had already established with Sasun—but we none of us could feel sure. You will readily understand that I didn't sleep much that night. I turned and turned in my mind the arguments I had used and wondered if I could not have done better.|$|E
500|$|Before {{reporting}} {{to spring training}} for the Blues in early 1910 at Excelsior Springs, Missouri, Stengel was approached by his neighbor, Kid Nichols, a former star pitcher, who advised him {{to listen to his}} manager and to the older players, and if he was minded to reject their advice, at least <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> for a month or so first. Stengel failed to make the ball club, which was part of the American Association, considered one of the top minor leagues. Kansas City optioned Stengel to the Kankakee Kays of the Class D Northern Association, a lower-level minor league, to gain experience as an outfielder. He had a [...]251 batting average with Kankakee when the league folded in July. He found a place with the Shelbyville Grays, who moved mid-season and became the Maysville Rivermen, of the Class D Blue Grass League, batting [...]221. He returned to the Blues for the final week of the season, with his combined batting average for 1910 at [...]237.|$|E

2500|$|Difficulties {{continued}} with Lloyd George, {{who had been}} chairman of the Liberal MPs since 1924, over the party leadership and over party funds. In the autumn of 1925 Hobhouse, Runciman and the industrialist Sir Alfred Mond protested to Asquith at Lloyd George organising his own campaign for reform of land ownership. Asquith was [...] "not enthusiastic" [...] but Lloyd George ignored him and arranged for Asquith to be sent reports and calculations ("Lord Oxford likes sums" [...] he wrote). At a meeting on 25 November 1925 Grey, Maclean, Simon, Gladstone and Runciman urged Asquith to have a showdown with Lloyd George over money. Asquith wanted to <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>over,</b> and at the December 1925 Federation executive he left the meeting before the topic came up. To the horror of his followers Asquith reached an agreement in principle with Lloyd George over land reform on 2 December, then together they presented plans to the National Liberal Federation on 26 February 1926. But, wrote Maclean, [...] "in private Asquith's language about Lloyd George was lurid." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Browns {{opened the}} third quarter with a 57-yard drive capped by a Kellen Winslow {{touchdown}} reception for 30 yards. [...] Later in the quarter, a Leon Washington fumble led to another field goal for the Browns. [...] Justin Miller would answer back, however, by taking the ensuing kickoff 99 yards for a touchdown. [...] After a Browns punt, the Jets moved down the field and got a 47-yard field goal from Nugent. [...] The Browns offense stalled out in the fourth quarter, but the defense played well. [...] Sean Jones got another interception midway through the fourth quarter, and a late drive by the Jets failed as Chad Pennington's final throw to the endzone was caught by Chris Baker; however, the officials ruled {{that he would have}} landed out of bounds even if the Browns' Brodney Pool hadn't pushed him. [...] The play was not reviewed even after the Jets called a time-out for the booth official to <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>over,</b> and the Browns hung on to win.|$|E

2500|$|After George Balanchine {{was hired}} by the Ballet Russe, he was {{attracted}} to Tallchief professionally and personally. She, however, was unaware of his attraction: [...] "It {{never occurred to me that}} there was anything more than dancing on his mind... It would have been preposterous to think there was anything personal." [...] Although their relationship became more personal, it was a shock to Tallchief when Balanchine asked her to marry him. During the summer of 1945, he asked her to meet him after a Los Angeles performance. Balanchine opened the car door for her; when she got in he sat in silence for a moment before saying, [...] "Maria, I would like you to become my wife". [...] "I almost fell out of my seat and was unable to respond", she recalled. [...] She eventually replied, [...] "But, George, I'm not sure I love you. I feel that I hardly know you." [...] He answered that it did not matter, and if the marriage only lasted a few years that was all right with him. After a day to <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>over,</b> Tallchief accepted his proposal.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{historical}} accounts mention {{the crowd that}} gathered outside {{what is now the}} Palace of Iturbide in Mexico City to shout [...] "Viva Iturbide!" [...] and insist that he take the throne of Mexico in May 1822. [...] This crowd included Iturbide's old regiment from Celaya. Some detractors of Iturbide insist that this demonstration was staged by Iturbide himself or his loyalists. From a balcony of the palace Iturbide repeatedly denied his desire for the throne. One interesting twist to this story is reported by Mexico City daily La Jornada which states that Iturbide held the first popular referendum in Mexico. According to this article, Iturbide sent out a questionnaire to military and civilian leaders as to whether the people preferred a republic or a monarchy. The answer came back in favor of a monarchy. Iturbide asked the demonstrators that night to give him the night to <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>over,</b> and to respect the wishes of the government. The congress convened the next day to discuss the matter of Iturbide's election as Emperor. Iturbide's supporters filled the balconies overlooking the chamber. The congress confirmed him and his title of Agustín I, Constitutional Emperor of Mexico, by a vast majority. After Iturbide's abdication, Congress would state that it had elected Iturbide out of fear for their lives, as the common folk were present during the vote and loudly proclaimed Iturbide, despite the fact that no congressman voted against his crowning as Emperor. However, three days after Iturbide had been elected Emperor, Congress held a private session, in which only the congress was present, in which they ratified their decision, created titles for the royal family and declared Iturbide's title to be lifelong and hereditary.|$|E
