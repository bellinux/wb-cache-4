500|$|... is a {{supporting}} character in Final Fantasy XIII, a Sanctum Air Force Brigadier {{and leader of}} the Sanctum's Calvary branch. Like Rosch, Cid has doubts about the Sanctum in its current state, and believes that Cocoon should be run by its people.

However, it later turns out that Cid is actually a Cocoon l'Cie, aiding the group under orders from Dysley before acting on his own to kill them for the safety of Cocoon's people. Defeated, Cid returns to Dysley to replace him as Primarch under orders to create chaos in Eden, Cocoon's capital city.

2500|$|One {{of the big}} storylines in EastEnders in 1992 was Arthur's {{infidelity}} {{with the}} lonely divorcée Christine Hewitt (Elizabeth Power).
