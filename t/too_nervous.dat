5|$|Of {{the famous}} Modernist writers who {{spent time in}} Paris, Ernest Hemingway never made an {{appearance}} at the salon. James Joyce came once or twice but didn't care for it. Marcel Proust never attended a Friday, though he did come to 20, Rue Jacob once to talk with Barney about lesbian culture whilst doing research for In Search of Lost Time. His visit was delayed repeatedly owing to his poor health, and when the meeting finally did happen he was <b>too</b> <b>nervous</b> {{to bring up the}} subject he had come to talk about.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the more}} surreal short films in the show, {{containing}} minimal dialogue and apparently set in a dystopian future society. It features a man (McCulloch) {{who works at a}} draconian sausage factory and {{falls in love with a}} woman who works there kissing the boxes so they have the company's lipstick logo. <b>Too</b> <b>nervous</b> to talk to her, the man, who had stolen some sausages for his deranged, sausage-obsessed father (Thompson), leaves them on her doorstep anonymously. Knowing he can never lead a normal life while caring for his gibbering idiot father, he resigns himself to loneliness.|$|E
25|$|Crosby had an {{interest}} in sports. In the 1930s, his friend and former college classmate, Gonzaga head coach Mike Pecarovich appointed Crosby as an assistant football coach. From 1946 until the end of his life, he was part-owner of baseball's Pittsburgh Pirates. Although he was passionate about his team, he was <b>too</b> <b>nervous</b> to watch the deciding Game 7 of the 1960 World Series, choosing to go to Paris with Kathryn and listen to the game on the radio. Crosby had the NBC telecast of the game recorded on kinescope. The game {{was one of the most}} famous in baseball history, capped off by Bill Mazeroski's walk-off home run. He apparently viewed the complete film just once, and then stored it in his wine cellar, where it remained undisturbed until it was discovered in December 2009. The restored broadcast was shown on MLB Network in December 2010.|$|E

25|$|After {{leaving his}} job, Vanunu started {{attended}} Israeli Communist Party meetings, but was unimpressed {{with the level}} of discussion and soon stopped going. He also tried modeling nude for art students, but was not booked again for being <b>too</b> <b>nervous</b> and jumpy. In November 1985, he moved in with Judy Zimmet, an American woman who was working as a midwife at Soroka Medical Center. After accompanying Zimmet and her sister on a tour around Israel, he embarked on a backpacking trip throughout the Far East, and planned to meet her in the United States afterwards, though he later became uncertain about continuing the relationship. On January 19, 1986, he left Israel for Greece via a boat from Haifa to Athens. After spending a few days in Athens, he flew to Thailand on an Aeroflot flight to Bangkok. He transited through Moscow, spending a night at a transit hotel there. During his time in Thailand, he visited the Golden Triangle, where he tried opium and hash cocktails. He then flew to Burma, where he met and befriended Fiona Gall, daughter of British journalist Sandy Gall. After touring Mandalay together, Vanunu flew on his own to Nepal.|$|E
25|$|Richter {{parachute}}d into Britain on {{the early}} morning of 12 May 1941, landing near London Colney north of London. Richter quickly hid his parachute and equipment {{and spent the next}} few days and nights hiding in the forest, <b>too</b> <b>nervous</b> to travel to London. When Richter eventually came out of hiding, he was approached by a lorry driver who asked Richter for directions. Unable to give directions, Richter aroused the suspicions of the lorry driver who drove a short distance and reported the strange foreigner to a police officer. The police officer found Richter and, after examining his papers and asking him a few questions, decided to take Richter to the local police station. Richter's identity papers, in the name of Fred Snyder, were clearly forged and did not match the expired Czechoslovak passport in his possession (which was in his own name). Richter was sent to Camp 020 where he was interrogated by officers of MI5. Richter was a difficult agent to break and it was only when he was confronted with fellow spy Josef Jakobs that Richter began to crack. Richter revealed the true purpose of his mission, to check up on agent Wulf Schmidt.|$|E

60|$|Eve for {{a moment}} sat quite still; she, <b>too,</b> seemed <b>nervous.</b> I was looking away again at the {{retreating}} figures of Mr. Parker and Mr. Moss. Suddenly my heart sank.

500|$|After the 1956 Olympics, Leech {{retired from}} {{competitive}} swimming {{at the age}} of 15. She was the first person from Bendigo to win an Olympic medal and was [...] upon returning to her hometown. She regarded the experience of living in the Olympic Village as an unusual one; in addition to the large crowds and the pressure of an Olympics, {{it was the first time}} that she had been away from the family home. Physicians endorsed her decision to retire, feeling that she became <b>too</b> <b>nervous</b> prior to races. Leech briefly worked in Melbourne as a model, before returning to Bendigo to help run the family jewellery business. She took a leading role in the business after the death of her father in the 1970s, before handing control of the firm to her son.|$|E
500|$|Almost {{from the}} first, Yiddish theater drew {{a level of}} theater {{criticism}} comparable to any other European theater of its time. For example, Bercovici cites a [...] "brochure" [...] by one G. Abramski, published in 1877, that described and gave critiques of all of Goldfaden's plays of that year. Abramski speculated that the present day might be for Yiddish theater a moment comparable to the Elizabethan era for English theater. He discussed what a Yiddish theater ought to be, noted its many sources (ranging from Purim plays to circus pantomime), and praised its incorporation of strong female roles. He also criticized where he saw weaknesses, noting how unconvincingly a male actor played the mother in Shmendrik, or remarking of the play Di shtume kale (The Mute Bride) — a work that Goldfaden apparently wrote to accommodate a pretty, young actress who in the performance was <b>too</b> <b>nervous</b> to deliver her lines — that the only evidence of Goldfaden's authorship was his name.|$|E
500|$|Britten, {{though a}} {{reluctant}} conductor and a nervous pianist, was greatly sought after in both capacities. The piano accompanist Gerald Moore {{wrote in his}} memoirs about playing at all the main music festivals except for Aldeburgh, because [...] "as the presiding genius there is the greatest accompanist in the world, my services are not needed". Britten's recital partnership with Pears was his best-known collaboration, but he also accompanied Kathleen Ferrier, Rostropovich, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, James Bowman and John Shirley-Quirk, among others. Though usually <b>too</b> <b>nervous</b> to play piano solos, Britten often performed piano duets with Clifford Curzon or Richter, and chamber music with the Amadeus Quartet. The composers whose works, other than his own, he most often played were Mozart and Schubert; the latter, in Murray Perahia's view, was Britten's greatest idol. As a boy and young man, Britten had intensely admired Brahms, but his admiration waned to nothing, and Brahms seldom featured in his repertory.|$|E
50|$|Suryakamal is {{the male}} {{lead of the}} show and plays Preeti’s (the female protagonist’s) husband. He is a very innocent, humble and down to earth man. Along with being a very hard working, he lives his life with very strong values. He is not {{visually}} appealing but has a heart of Gold. Due to a severe sinus problem he sneezes continuously (and for all you know wears a wig <b>too!).</b> When <b>nervous</b> he starts to speak in monosyllables.|$|R
60|$|But Mary Louise couldn't help worrying. They lingered {{over the}} breakfast, but Alora {{did not join}} them.

Finally Colonel Hathaway, <b>too,</b> became <b>nervous.</b> He telephoned the central police station to inquire if a young girl of Alora's description had met with an accident. There was no record of such an accident, but {{in half an hour}} a detective came to the hotel and asked for the Colonel.|$|R

500|$|Manchester United manager Ferguson was {{critical}} {{of the performance of}} referee D'Urso: [...] "I felt sorry for the referee today, it doesn't matter how much training you have in any job. It's about temperament, and I just think the lad was <b>too</b> <b>nervous</b> for that today." [...] Despite losing their fourth consecutive Charity Shield match, Ferguson did not believe it would affect his team heading into the start of the season: [...] "We certainly hope we can go on to win the title again like we have in previous years. We just need to keep the standards up and show the desire we did in the second half." [...] He was also unsure whether Liverpool would be able to challenge for the Premier League: [...] "It's difficult to assess Liverpool at the moment. They started with confidence, but then you would expect that from a team that won three trophies a few months ago. You would also expect us to be sluggish at the start, because we are bloody good at it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} recorded by Roberts and Tikovoi. However, the pair struggled to finish its production, with Roberts describing {{the process as}} something that [...] "just wouldn't work". The incompletion of the song led to stress and illness for Roberts, and she decided to contact producer Diplo {{to work on the}} record. Discussing her choice in an interview for The Guardian, Roberts said that she only had one chance to get him to work with her and asked for his assistance. After Diplo reassured the singer that he would help, Roberts revealed that the situation was no longer in her hands and that she would wait for him to contact her with some progress. Despite her worries, she felt that [...] "he just got it straight away". Communications were limited between the pair, but when Roberts received Diplo's finished production, she was <b>too</b> <b>nervous</b> to listen to it immediately. Instead, she burnt the track to a CD, and drove to a deserted field with her younger brother and sister, where she played the song loudly. After positive responses from her siblings, Roberts declared Diplo a [...] "genius".|$|E
500|$|Leslie sees Jeanine Restrepo (Loretta Fox), an {{influential}} zoning board member {{who could help}} Leslie with her plans to turn the Sullivan Street pit into a park. Leslie is <b>too</b> <b>nervous</b> to approach her, so she practices with Mark (Paul Schneider), who teasingly pinches her nose because he says as Jeanine, [...] "I can do whatever I want"; Ann pinches Mark's nose and Leslie pinches Ann's, and Mark summarizes, [...] "It's fun {{to pretend to be}} zoning board members." [...] Marlene suggests Leslie try sucking up to Jeanine in her speech, but it comes across awkwardly when Leslie claims to [...] "love" [...] Jeanine. When Leslie tries to approach her later, Jeanine suggests Leslie make an appointment with her secretary. Marlene says this means Jeanine is blowing them off, and tells Leslie to blackmail Jeanine with the knowledge that her husband has a DUI offense in Illinois. Leslie shares the advice with Ann, who says she believes it is unethical and wrong; offended, Leslie accuses Ann of pampering Andy. ("He's got three crutches, {{and one of them is}} you. And the other two are crutches.") Ann storms off.|$|E

Spears flew to Cheiron Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, where {{half of the}} album was recorded from March to April 1998, with producers Max Martin, Denniz Pop and Rami Yacoub, among others. Martin showed Spears and her management a track titled [...] "Hit Me Baby One More Time", which was originally written for American R group TLC; however, they rejected it. Spears later claimed that she felt excited when she heard it and {{knew it was going}} to be a hit. [...] "We at Jive said, 'This is a fuckin' smash'," [...] revealed the label's A executive, Steven Lunt; however, other executives were concerned that the line [...] "Hit Me" [...] would condone domestic violence, and later revised it to [...] "...Baby One More Time". The singer revealed that she [...] "didn't do well at all the first day in the studio , I was just <b>too</b> <b>nervous.</b> So I went out that night and had some fun. The next day I was completely relaxed and nailed it. You gotta be relaxed singing '... Baby One More Time'." [...] By June 1998, the album was done, and Spears embarked on a promotional tour sponsored by L'Oreal. ...Baby One More Time was released as Spears' debut album on January 12, 1999.|$|E

Their performance is mostly successful, although Baby is <b>too</b> <b>nervous</b> to accomplish the dance's climactic lift. Johnny and Baby return to Kellerman's and find Penny in agony. Billy explains that the [...] "doctor" [...] {{turned out to be}} a back-alley hack who caused severe damage to Penny. Baby brings her father to help Penny, but when Jake asks point blank, [...] "Who's responsible for this girl?", Johnny replies [...] "I am", claiming responsibility out of fear that Penny will be fired if it gets out that she slept with Robbie. Jake treats Penny, but is angry that Baby used his money to pay for the procedure, and forbids Baby to associate with Johnny or his friends. Baby goes to Johnny to apologize for her father's behavior. They dance, and afterwards have sex. Jake tells his family they'll be leaving early over breakfast. Marjorie says they are paid up til Sunday and Lisa protests, because she wants to sing at the end-of-season talent show. Jake gives in, and Baby continues to see Johnny despite her father's warning. She pulls Johnny off the footpath when her father is nearby, and Johnny is hurt that she won't stand up for him to her father. Robbie sees them during their argument and makes a derisive remark about [...] "going slumming" [...] with the staff. Johnny assaults him.|$|E

(Don’t get <b>too</b> <b>nervous,</b> Brooke, but the future of TV's once highest-rated drama may be in your hands.)" [...] Discussing the character in terms of her relationship with Callie Torres, AfterEllen.com were also largely positive, assessing that: [...] "The story line offered both the drama Grey's is known for and— despite some marginally exploitative threesome talk— a truthfulness network television has rarely achieved when it comes to lesbian relationships." [...] Trish Doolan and Nikki Weiss, invited by GLAAD to consult with Grey's Anatomy producers on the storyline, praised the effort put into researching the issue by the writers and actors involved, though were more negative on the scene which saw Hahn kiss Callie in an elevator in front of Mark Sloan. Weiss commented: [...] "I just felt like, if they really cared about each other, I don't think they would do that as a stunt. That seemed a little, I don't know, forced. [...] was more like a conquest, like he could have [...] too or something." [...] AfterEllen.com agreed with this view, criticizing the way the scene was edited so as to keep cutting to Mark's point of view, as though [...] "privileging the male gaze." [...] Smith, however, has refuted this interpretation, stating that; [...] "Frankly, when I played that scene, I played it as, [...] "You think that if you walked in the room and we were together, we would just be on you, but we wouldn't." [...] So that's why I kissed her. In that moment, I swear to God, when I was playing it, that's what I was thinking.
