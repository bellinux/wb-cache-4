25|$|At {{the time}} Steven Wilson {{was going to}} sign to the Delerium label, he owned a lot of {{material}} recorded during the mid- and later '80s that he had recorded subsequently on three demo tapes - Tarquin's Seaweed Farm, Love, Death & Mussolini and The Nostalgia Factory. He sent copies of <b>those</b> <b>tapes</b> to people he felt would be interested in the recordings, asking them to spread the word. Delerium originally intended to release all of that material in a double debut album, but Wilson decided to just pick the songs he considered the best ones. These songs were mastered to make Porcupine Tree's first studio album, On the Sunday of Life... (1991); all of the leftover tracks would be later released on a compilation album called Yellow Hedgerow Dreamscape (1994).|$|E
25|$|Dr. David R. Williams (NASA {{archivist}} at Goddard Space Flight Center) and Apollo 11 {{flight director}} Eugene F. Kranz both {{acknowledged that the}} Apollo 11 telemetry data tapes are missing. Conspiracists see this as evidence that they never existed. The Apollo 11 telemetry tapes were different from the telemetry tapes of the other Moon landings because they contained the raw television broadcast. For technical reasons, the Apollo 11 lander carried a slow-scan television (SSTV) camera (see Apollo TV camera). To broadcast the pictures to regular television, a scan conversion had to be done. The radio telescope at Parkes Observatory in Australia was able to receive the telemetry from the Moon {{at the time of}} the Apollo 11 moonwalk. Parkes had a bigger antenna than NASA's antenna in Australia at the Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station, so it received a better picture. It also received a better picture than NASA's antenna at Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex. This direct TV signal, along with telemetry data, was recorded onto one-inch fourteen-track analog tape at Parkes. The original SSTV transmission had better detail and contrast than the scan-converted pictures, and it is this tape that is missing. A crude, real-time scan conversion of the SSTV signal was done in Australia before it was broadcast worldwide. However, still photos of the original SSTV image are available (see photos). About fifteen minutes of it were filmed by an amateur 8 mm film camera and these are also available. Later Apollo missions did not use SSTV. At least some of the telemetry tapes from the ALSEP scientific experiments left on the Moon (which ran until 1977) still exist, according to Dr. Williams. Copies of <b>those</b> <b>tapes</b> have been found.|$|E

500|$|After losing out on {{the role}} of Lois Lane in two {{previous}} films about Superman, Adams secured the part in Zack Snyder's 2013 reboot, Man of Steel, starring Henry Cavill as the titular superhero. She played Lane with a mixture of toughness and vulnerability, but Peter Bradshaw thought that the character was [...] "sketchily conceived" [...] and criticized her lack of chemistry with Cavill. Even so, the film earned over $660 million to become one of her biggest box-office hits. Adams next featured in Her, a drama from the writer-director Spike Jonze about a lonely man (Joaquin Phoenix) who falls in love with an operating system (voiced by Scarlett Johansson); Adams played his close friend. She had unsuccessfully auditioned for Jonze's 2009 film Where the Wild Things Are and was hired for Her after Jonze looked back at <b>those</b> <b>tapes.</b> Adams was drawn to the idea of portraying a platonic male-female friendship, which she believed was rare in film.|$|E

2500|$|The Apples {{changed their}} {{name to the}} Wallflowers and began playing clubs around Los Angeles, {{specifically}} the Sunset Strip, such as the Whisky a Go Go, Gazzarri's and the Viper Room. While they were playing clubs the band was also sending their demo tape to record companies and figures within the music industry. One of <b>those</b> <b>tapes</b> {{caught the attention of}} Andrew Slater, who would eventually become the Wallflowers' manager. [...] Slater brought the Wallflowers to Virgin Records, who signed the band to a record contract. The Wallflowers then set out to make their first album. [...] However, finding a producer who was willing to work with them proved to be difficult. The band was intent on recording live and few producers were willing to produce that way. Paul Fox eventually stepped in and agreed to produce the album. By the time the Wallflowers got into the studio in 1991, they had a small catalog of songs they had been performing live which they wanted to record for their debut album. All of the songs were written by Dylan {{with the rest of the}} band members contributing input on the music. When in the studio, the band were intent on using as little recording equipment as possible. [...] Dylan explained: [...] "If I could have had it my way I would not have seen a microphone or a cable anywhere." [...] When it came to recording, the songs were drawn out past the 3 to 4 minute norm; many songs were close to 5 minutes in length with two exceeding 7 minutes. The Wallflowers finished recording and released their debut album on August 25, 1992. After the release they began touring nationwide as an opening act for bands such as the Spin Doctors and 10,000 Maniacs.|$|E

40|$|We have {{fabricated}} prototype Bi,Pb(2223) /Ag superconduting multifilamentary wires with {{a square}} cross-section. The AC losses of these wires were measured, compared with <b>those</b> of <b>tapes</b> and also {{compared with the}} theory. Wires show largely reduced AC magnetic field losses at 47 Hz, compared to <b>those</b> of <b>tapes</b> in a perpendicular magnetic field. The effects of the twist pitch and {{of the use of}} the high resisitive barriers were also investigated. The results show that the use of a twist pitch of about 10 mm is sufficient for decoupling the filaments, and that the use of very short twist pitches does not further reduce the absolute value of the AC losses. The losses in the wires are still higher than <b>those</b> of <b>tapes</b> in a parallel magnetic field, but the results show that the square or round configurations are interesting for applications where a perpendicular component of the magnetic field cannot be avoided, or for applications in rotating magnetic fields.

Night Heat, a production of Canada's CTV network, also aired on CBS Late Night. Adderly, Hot Shots and Diamonds, other Canadian-filmed shows, later appeared. In 1987, CBS aired an Americanized version of the BBC's long running pop music show, Top of the Pops, hosted by Nia Peeples and featuring some performances from the BBC version of the program, alongside <b>those</b> <b>taped</b> in Hollywood.

5000|$|If {{one goes}} to the Madacy site to view their 101 Strings collection, exactly the same {{description}} that was used on the Bel Canto's ST- 76 two track stereo release about the 101 Strings sound is reprinted. The 50 Hz hum heard on many of <b>those</b> <b>tape</b> recordings {{was due to the}} Ampex 350's filtering which was not well suited for European 50 Hz power. The [...] "My Fair Lady" [...] and [...] "King and I" [...] releases have {{what appears to be the}} sound of dirty mixing pots used on the fly during those sessions. There were a number of tape releases that sounded like tape copies of pristine Stereo Fidelity vinyl which actually, were not all that pristine. Stereo recordings were made with a triangular cutting stylus. This resulted at times in pinch distortion which early conical styli did not handle well. Inner grooves especially, due to the increased density of the recorded information due to the slower relative movement of the track under the stylus, were more susceptible to distortion with conical styli in use at the time this record was released. The later development of elliptical styli allowed more precise tracking of the track and greatly reduced inner-track distortion.|$|R
