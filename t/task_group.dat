5|$|As of January 1945, the Third Fleet {{was built}} around the Fast Carrier Task Force, which was the main US Navy strike force in the Pacific. Control of this force alternated at regular {{intervals}} between the Third and Fifth Fleets (commanded by Halsey and Admiral Raymond A. Spruance respectively), with its designation also changing from Task Force 38 to Task Force 58. As Task Force 38 it was commanded by Vice Admiral John S. McCain Sr. In January 1945 Task Force 38 was organized into three fast carrier task groups and a night carrier group. The fast carrier groups were <b>Task</b> <b>Group</b> 38.1 with four aircraft carriers, two battleships, six cruisers and 25 destroyers, <b>Task</b> <b>Group</b> 38.2 with four carriers, three battleships, five cruisers and 24 destroyers and <b>Task</b> <b>Group</b> 38.3 which comprised four carriers, three battleships, five cruisers and 17 destroyers. The night carrier group, <b>Task</b> <b>Group</b> 38.5, had two carriers and six destroyers, and operated with <b>Task</b> <b>Group</b> 38.2 during the day. These carrier groups embarked around 900 aircraft in total. The other major element of the fleet was a logistics element designated <b>Task</b> <b>Group</b> 30.8 which comprised a varying number of tankers and ammunition ships, several escort carriers which transported replacement aircraft for Task Force 38 {{and a large number}} of escorting destroyers. In addition, the fleet was assigned an anti-submarine hunter-killer force designated <b>Task</b> <b>Group</b> 30.7 which was equipped with an escort carrier and three destroyer escorts and typically operated in support of <b>Task</b> <b>Group</b> 30.8.|$|E
5|$|A Special Forces <b>Task</b> <b>Group</b> (SFTG) was {{deployed}} to Afghanistan in August or September 2005, {{operating in the}} southern province of Uruzgan. The SFTG consisted of elements from the SASR, 4 RAR (Commando), the Incident Response Regiment (IRR) and logistic support personnel. Two CH-47 Chinook helicopters from the 5th Aviation Regiment were {{deployed to}} Afghanistan in March 2006 to support the SFTG. A forward operating base was subsequently established at Tarin Kowt. This <b>task</b> <b>group</b> was withdrawn in September 2006, {{after a year of}} operations working closely with special forces from the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. During this period the <b>task</b> <b>group</b> was on patrol for 306 days, involved in 139 contacts, and sustained 11 soldiers wounded. The SFTG was replaced by a Reconstruction Taskforce made up of engineers and conventional infantry.|$|E
5|$|In late 2008 {{a company}} from the 1st Commando Regiment {{became the first}} formed Army Reserve unit to see combat since World War II when it was {{deployed}} to Afghanistan {{as part of the}} Australian Special Operations <b>Task</b> <b>Group.</b> The initial deployment proved problematic however, with a subsequent inquiry finding that the company had received less support for its pre-deployment preparations than was typical for regular units and that its training was inadequate. The 1st Commando Regiment contributed forces to several other Special Operations <b>Task</b> <b>Group</b> rotations.|$|E

5|$|Since 2000, the ADF's {{expanded}} {{force structure}} and deployment capabilities {{have been put}} to the test on several occasions. Following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, Australia committed a special forces <b>task</b> <b>group</b> and an air-to-air refuelling aircraft to operations in Afghanistan, and naval warships to the Persian Gulf as Operation Slipper. In 2003, approximately 2,000 ADF personnel, including a special forces <b>task</b> <b>group,</b> three warships and 14 F/A-18 Hornet aircraft, took part in the invasion of Iraq.|$|E
5|$|<b>Task</b> <b>Group</b> 111.2 sailed from Manus Island on 12 June. While {{en route}} to Truk, its orders were broadened to also include a cruiser {{bombardment}} of Japanese positions at Truk. This change was made as the cruisers {{were expected to be}} used against shore targets during future operations. In preparation for these bombardments, the <b>Task</b> <b>Group</b> conducted gunnery exercises during its voyage north. Ahead of the attacks on Truk, a US Navy submarine took up position near the atoll to rescue any British airmen who crashed into the sea.|$|E

5|$|While it {{was planned}} to refuel the fleet's destroyers on 10 January, this was {{frustrated}} by bad weather. Instead, the destroyers were refueled during 11 January as the fleet proceeded south-west. Once the destroyers were refueled, the Third Fleet was reorganized for combat. Two heavy cruisers and five destroyers were transferred from <b>Task</b> <b>Group</b> 38.1 to <b>Task</b> <b>Group</b> 38.2. The later <b>task</b> <b>group,</b> {{under the command}} of Rear Admiral Gerald F. Bogan, was intended to launch air attacks against Cam Ranh Bay from its three large carriers and single light carrier on the morning of 12 January. The Task Group's two battleships, accompanied by destroyers and cruisers, would then bombard the area and finish off ships which were damaged in the air attacks. The fleet remained undetected by Japanese forces on 10 and 11 January.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the night strike <b>Task</b> <b>Group</b> 111.2 departed for Manus Island. On 16 June a Japanese aircraft was detected by radar. One of the Seafires was detached from the combat air patrol to intercept it, but the fighter's pilot had to abandon the attempt due to a mechanical problem. The <b>Task</b> <b>Group</b> arrived at Manus Island on 17 June, and continued training exercises there until the remainder of the BPF arrived on 4 July en route to further operations off Japan. All of the warships at Manus sailed on 6 July to join the Fast Carrier Task Force in attacks on the Japanese home islands. Implacable and the other ships of the BPF operated against Japan from 17 July to 12 August, during which time the Fleet conducted air attacks and participated in several bombardments of coastal Japanese cities. On 12 August most of the BPF's ships, including Implacable, departed for a period of maintenance and rest at Sydney.|$|E

On the night of 2728 March, Guam {{and the rest of}} Cruiser Division 16 bombarded the airfield on Minamidaitō. After concluding the bombardment, Guam returned to the carrier screen while they conducted operations off Nansei Shoto until 11 May. The ship then steamed to Ulithi for periodic maintenance and to replenish ammunition and supplies. She {{then returned}} to Okinawa, assigned to <b>Task</b> <b>Group</b> 38.4 of William Halsey's Third Fleet. She continued to provide anti-aircraft defense for the carriers while they launched fighter sweeps of Kyushu. Guam and Alaska bombarded Oki Daitō {{for an hour and a}} half on 9 June, after which they steamed to San Pedro Bay in the Leyte Gulf, arriving on 13 June.|$|E
5|$|In June 2014 a {{small number}} of SASR {{personnel}} were deployed to Iraq to protect the Australian embassy when the security of Baghdad was threatened by the 2014 Northern Iraq offensive. Later, in August and September a number of RAAF C-17 and C-130J transport aircraft based in the Middle East were used to conduct airdrops of humanitarian aid to trapped civilians and to airlift arms and munitions to forces in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq. In late September 2014 an Air <b>Task</b> <b>Group</b> (ATG) and Special Operations <b>Task</b> <b>Group</b> (SOTG) were deployed to Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates as part of the coalition to combat Islamic State forces in Iraq. Equipped with F/A-18F Super Hornet strike aircraft, a KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transport, and an E-7A Wedgetail Airborne Early Warning & Control aircraft, the ATG began operations on 1 October. The SOTG is tasked with operations to advise and assist Iraqi Security Forces, and was deployed to Iraq after a legal framework covering their presence in the country was agreed between the Australian and Iraqi Governments. It began moving into Iraq in early November. In April 2015 a 300-strong unit known as <b>Task</b> <b>Group</b> Taji was deployed to Iraq to train the regular Iraqi Security Forces. Airstrikes were extended to Syria in September 2015.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, in August 2005 an Australian Special Forces <b>Task</b> <b>Group</b> (SFTG) was {{deployed}} to Afghanistan {{as part of}} Operation Slipper, operating in the southern province of Uruzgan. The SFTG, based on similar structure deployed during Operation Falconer, {{was made up of}} elements from the SASR, a commando company and a troop from the Incident Response Regiment. Two CH-47 Chinook helicopters from the 5th Aviation Regiment were {{deployed to}} Afghanistan in March 2006 to support the SFTG. A forward operating base was subsequently established at Tarin Kowt. During this deployment the Commandos were involved in Operation Perth which resulted in the death of over 150 Taliban and al-Qaeda fighters in nine days of fierce fighting in the Chora district of Uruzgan Province. The SFTG was withdrawn from Afghanistan in September 2006 and replaced by a Reconstruction Taskforce made up of engineers and conventional infantry. During this period the <b>task</b> <b>group</b> was on patrol for 306 days and involved in 139 contacts and sustained 11 soldiers wounded.|$|E
5|$|On 14September 2014, the Federal {{government}} {{committed to}} deploying {{up to eight}} Super Hornets of No.1 Squadron to Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates, {{as part of the}} Australian Air <b>Task</b> <b>Group</b> joining the coalition against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) forces in Iraq. Aircraft from the squadron conducted their first mission over Iraq on 5October, and their first strike four days later. According to the Department of Defence, as of 20December 2014 the Super Hornets had flown over 180 sorties, dropped 113 weapons, and destroyed 36 ISIL targets, damaging another six. In March 2015, having flown almost 3,000 hours in over 400 missions, the detachment was replaced by six F/A-18As from No.75 Squadron. A detachment of No.1 Squadron was again to deployed to Al Minhad as part of the Australian Air <b>Task</b> <b>Group</b> in May 2017, replacing the six legacy Hornets deployed prior.|$|E

5|$|On 29 December 1944, Radford was {{unexpectedly}} {{ordered to}} take command of <b>Task</b> <b>Group</b> 38.1 after its commander, Rear Admiral Alfred E. Montgomery, was injured. The {{next day the}} fleet sortied from Ulithi and headed for scheduled air strikes on Luzon and Formosa (Taiwan). Throughout January 1945, Radford's fleet operated in the South China Sea striking Japanese targets in French Indochina and Hong Kong. In February, the U.S. Third Fleet was re-designated the U.S. Fifth Fleet, and {{as a part of}} this reorganization Radford's force was redesignated <b>Task</b> <b>Group</b> 58.4. He continued striking Japanese targets in the Inland Sea during March. On 1 April, the force was moved to support the Battle of Okinawa. Over {{the course of the next}} two months, his force continued its use of night raids, which by this point were effective in repelling Japanese attacks on U.S. Navy ships. After two months supporting ground forces on Okinawa, Radford's fleet was detached from that operation.|$|E
