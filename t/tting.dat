5000|$|Every {{year at the}} end of {{the yearly}} harvest, which occurs in November or early December, young men use the large open space to play a game of Genna. Genna is a game which is played during the months of December to February. The game looks like a hybrid between cricket and soccer, except Genna {{requires}} a rather large area. This game is one of the most popular games played in and around Amde Werq. Nearly every young male plays the game. The game requires a butting stick and a Ting or Enqur. Ting is a leather ball sligntly smaller than a Cricket ball and little larger than a Table-tennis ball. Kids who cannot make a leather ball use a small piece of timber known as enqoor. Enqoor or enqur is approximately three inches long by one and half inches thick. Players residing east of the Goodgooda plain hit <b>Tting</b> towards the western end of the field. Players who reside or come from west of the plying field hit the Ting towards the eastern end of the field. Points are scored when the ball reaches either ends of the playing field. as there could be hundreds of people participating in the game, it could take several hours before the Ting or Enqur reaches the finish line. This type of competition is similar to the Australian NRL State of Origin. While the winner group talks and basks in glory, the losing team eagerly awaits the next year to restore its pride. In Amdeworq the game is played towards the end of January (Tir Charqos) The Amharic phrase [...] "Alemane Beshro Belane" [...] - Ahaha etc. is the song of the winning team.|$|E

Whether {{or not they}} include explicit statistical tests, all induction algorithms make statistical decisions and thus are prone to over <b>tting.</b> Most modeling algorithms calculate a score for each ofseveral components, then test whether the best score {{is good enough to}} warrant adding the corresponding component to the model. We show that if the scores are independent, the reference distribution for any one score underestimates the reference distribution for the maximum score; thus scores will appear signi cant when they are not and model components will be added when they should not be. We demonstrate that the incidence of over <b>tting</b> decreases as the dependence among scores increases, although this e ect is generally quite small and cannot be exploited to prevent over <b>tting.</b> We demonstrate an equivalence between our explanation of over <b>tting</b> and the well-known statistical theory of multiple comparisons or simultaneous inference, which suggests a simple, e ective method to control over <b>tting.</b> Finally, we argue that overtting is a fundamentally statistical pathology {{and the only way to}} get precise control of over <b>tting</b> is to introduce appropriate statistical tests into modeling algorithms...|$|E

We demonstrate that under the null models the newly proposed generalized likelihood ratio statistics follow asymptotically rescaled -distributions, with the scale constants and the degrees of freedom being independent of the nuisance parameters.

Overall the total energy consumption due to building sector is about 40 % of all the energy while up to 75 % of heating energy is consumed by residential buildings. The major part of the energy is lost in heating the old non-renovated buildings, which consume up to 4 times as much energy as new buildings. This provides an opportunity for large energy savings and has caused rising interest in building retrofi <b>tting.</b> However the retrofi <b>tting</b> process must be done correctly and understanding that these buildings after retrofi <b>tting</b> must serve for next 30 years. As the existing examples show a particular attention must be paid to proper installation of ventilation systems, the correct choice of insulation material and its thickness, as well as proper balancing of heating systems. This handbook will serve as a general guide and inspiration for designers, architects and city planners in choosing the most appropriate retrofi <b>tting</b> solution. The handbook consists of four main chapters and ten annexes. The fi rst chapter explains the terminology used in the handbook. The second chapter introduces the {{existing building}} stock situation, climatic conditions and give a general overview of energy supply systems for each of the participating countries. Chapter number three presents the results and describes the retrofi <b>tting</b> processes of case studies as well as familiarizes with applied renewable energy sources. The last chapter gives examples and compares some of the most commonly used simulation programs and calculation tools for building energy performance evaluation in the participating countries. Each participating country in the handbook presents case studies of separate building or building group retrofi <b>tting</b> examples. The chosen cases of Latvia include two kindergartens and one multi-story residential building. Estonia showcases one multi-story residential building in Mustamäe district, one elementary school and one high school. Meanwhile Finland and Sweden present several examples of large-scale renovation of residential areas. Cases of Finland are located in the Helsinki region: one rental housing estate, a residential suburb in the city of Riihimäki, and a mixed residential area in northern Helsinki. The Swedish cases describe the retrofi <b>tting</b> process of three energy effi ciency projects of multidwelling buildings located in Stockholm, Malmö and Umeå. The fi rst case presents a retrofi <b>tting</b> project conducted in 2011 as part of Sustainable Järva, the other two examples include renovation of the residential area Ålidhem in Umeå and Rosengård in Malmö...|$|E
