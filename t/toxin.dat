5|$|Toxin-antitoxin {{systems are}} {{typically}} classified {{according to how}} the antitoxin neutralises the <b>toxin.</b> In a Type I toxin-antitoxin system, the translation of messenger RNA (mRNA) that encodes the <b>toxin</b> is inhibited by the binding of a small non-coding RNA antitoxin to the mRNA. The protein <b>toxin</b> in a type II system is inhibited post-translationally by the binding of another protein antitoxin. A single example of Type III toxin-antitoxin system has been described whereby a protein <b>toxin</b> is bound directly by an RNA molecule. Toxin-antitoxin genes are often transferred through horizontal gene transfer and are associated with pathogenic bacteria, having been found on plasmids conferring antibiotic resistance and virulence.|$|E
5|$|Type I systems {{sometimes}} {{include a}} third component. In {{the case of}} the well-characterised hok/sok system, in addition to the hok <b>toxin</b> and sok antitoxin, there is a third gene, called mok. This open reading frame almost entirely overlaps that of the <b>toxin,</b> and the translation of the <b>toxin</b> is dependent on the translation of this third component. Thus the binding of antitoxin to <b>toxin</b> is sometimes a simplification, and the antitoxin in fact binds a third RNA, which then affects <b>toxin</b> translation.|$|E
50|$|Homology α-PMTX has no {{structural}} homology {{with other}} <b>toxins.</b> It lacks disulfide bonds which {{are known to}} be present in other <b>toxins</b> acting on sodium channels, such as sea anemone <b>toxins</b> or scorpion <b>toxins.</b>|$|R
40|$|Pectenotoxin (PTX) -group <b>toxins</b> are a {{group of}} polyether-lactone <b>toxins.</b> They have been {{detected}} in microalgae and bivalve molluscs in Australia, Japan and New Zealand and {{in a number of}} European countries. Their presence in shellfish was discovered due to their acute toxicity in the mouse bioassay after intraperitoneal (i. p.) injections of lipophilic extracts of shellfish. PTX-group <b>toxins</b> are exclusively produced by Dinophysis species. They can be found in filter-feeding bivalve molluscs such as oysters and mussels. To date 15 different analogues have been isolated and characterised. PTX-group <b>toxins</b> are heat stable, but they are easily destroyed under strong basic conditions such as used for hydrolysis of acyl esters of the okadaic acid (OA) -group <b>toxins.</b> PTX-group <b>toxins</b> are also labile under acidic conditions. PTX-group <b>toxins</b> in shellfish are always accompanied by <b>toxins</b> from the OA-group. This appears to be the basis for grouping PTX-group <b>toxins</b> and OA-group <b>toxins</b> in the European regulation. The Scientific Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM Panel) concluded that because PTX-group <b>toxins</b> do not share the same mechanism of action as OA-group <b>toxins</b> they should not be included in the regulatory limit for OA-group <b>toxins.</b> The toxicological database for PTX-group <b>toxins</b> is limited and comprises mostly studies o...|$|R

40|$|Non-conventional <b>toxins</b> {{constitute}} a poorly characterized class of three-finger <b>toxins</b> isolated exclusively from Elapidae venoms. These <b>toxins</b> are monomers of 62 - 68 amino acid residues and contain five disulfide bridges. However, unlike a/?-neurotoxins and ?-neurotoxins {{which have the}} fifth disulfide bridge in their middle loop (loop II), the fifth disulfide bridge in non-conventional <b>toxins</b> is located in loop I (N-terminus loop). Overall, non-conventional <b>toxins</b> share ~ 28 - 42 % identity with other three-finger <b>toxins</b> including a-neurotoxins, a/?-neurotoxins and ?-neurotoxins. Recent structural studies have revealed that non-conventional <b>toxins</b> also display the typical three-finger motif. Non-conventional <b>toxins</b> are typically characterized by a lower order of toxicity (LD 50 ~ 5 - 80 mg/kg) in contrast to prototype a-neurotoxins (LD 50 ~ 0. 04 - 0. 3 mg/kg) and hence they are {{also referred to as}} 'weak toxins'. Further, it is generally assumed that non-conventional <b>toxins</b> target muscle (a 2 ߿d) receptors with low affinities several orders of magnitude lower than a-neurotoxins and a/?-neurotoxins. However, it is now known that some non-conventional <b>toxins</b> also antagonize neuronal a 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Hence, non-conventional <b>toxins</b> are not a functionally homogeneous group and other, yet unknown, molecular targets for this class of snake venom <b>toxins</b> may exist. Non-conventional <b>toxins</b> may therefore be a useful source of ligands with novel biological activity targeting the plethora of neuronal nicotinic receptors as well as other physiological processes.

40|$|The Cnidaria phylum {{includes}} {{organisms that}} {{are among the}} most venomous animals. The Anthozoa class includes sea anemones, hard corals, soft corals and sea pens. The composition of cnidarian venoms is not known in detail, but they appear to contain a variety of compounds. Currently around 250 of those compounds have been identified (peptides, proteins, enzymes and proteinase inhibitors) and non-proteinaceous substances (purines, quaternary ammonium compounds, biogenic amines and betaines), but very few genes encoding <b>toxins</b> were described and only a few related protein three-dimensional structures are available. <b>Toxins</b> are used for prey acquisition, but also to deter potential predators (with neurotoxicity and cardiotoxicity effects) and even to fight territorial disputes. Cnidaria <b>toxins</b> have been identified on the nematocysts located on the tentacles, acrorhagi and acontia, and in the mucous coat that covers the animal body. Sea anemone <b>toxins</b> comprise mainly proteins and peptides that are cytolytic or neurotoxic with its potency varying with the structure and site of action and are efficient in targeting different animals, such as insects, crustaceans and vertebrates. Sea anemones <b>toxins</b> include voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels <b>toxins,</b> acid-sensing ion channel <b>toxins,</b> Cytolysins, <b>toxins</b> with Kunitz-type protease inhibitors activity and <b>toxins</b> with Phospholipase A 2 activity. In this review we assessed the phylogentic relationships of sea anemone <b>toxins,</b> characterized such <b>toxins,</b> the genes encoding them and the <b>toxins</b> three-dimensional structures, further providing a state-of-the-art description of the procedures involved in the isolation and purification of bioactive <b>toxins...</b>|$|R

5|$|It {{has also}} been {{proposed}} that chromosomal copies of plasmid toxin-antitoxin systems may serve as anti-addiction modules– a method of omitting a plasmid from progeny without suffering {{the effects of the}} <b>toxin.</b> An example of this is an antitoxin on the Erwinia chrysanthemi genome that counteracts the toxic activity of an F plasmid <b>toxin</b> counterpart.|$|E
5|$|One {{possible}} source {{has been}} identified in the forests of New Guinea: beetles of the genus Choresine (family Melyridae), which contain the <b>toxin</b> and {{have been found in}} the stomachs of hooded pitohui. An alternative explanation, that the birds and beetles both get the <b>toxin</b> from a third source, is considered unlikely as the blue-capped ifrit is almost exclusively insectivorous.|$|E
5|$|Populations of Gyromitra esculenta {{appear to}} vary {{geographically}} in their toxicity. A French study {{has shown that}} mushrooms collected at higher altitudes have lower concentrations of <b>toxin</b> than those from lower elevations, {{and there is some}} evidence that fungi west of the Rocky Mountains in North America contain less <b>toxin</b> than those to the east.

50|$|BotIT6 {{belongs to}} the Buthidae neurotoxin family. The <b>toxins</b> {{can be divided into}} groups based on their target animal. BotIT6 is {{targeted}} at insects. <b>Toxins</b> directed against insects, the main target being the sodium channels, can be divided into four groups, namely excitatory <b>toxins,</b> depressant <b>toxins,</b> α-type <b>toxins</b> and a group affecting both mammals and insects. Each group causes paralysis, albeit via different mechanisms. The BotIT6 has characteristics of depressant, excitatory and α subgroups.|$|R

50|$|A {{classification}} of sea anemone polypeptide neurotoxins {{has been proposed}} based on their amino acid sequence, dividing the group into three classes of sodium channel <b>toxins.</b> Halcurin is structurally homologous with type 2 <b>toxins,</b> but also has sequence homology to type 1 <b>toxins.</b> Type 1 and 2 <b>toxins</b> are composed of 46 to 49 amino acid residues, and cross-linked by three disulfide bridges. Ten residues including six Cysteine (Cys) residues are completely conserved between type 1 and 2 <b>toxins.</b> Therefore, {{it is possible that}} type 1 and 2 <b>toxins</b> have evolved from Halcurin as a common ancestor.|$|R
5|$|Slow lorises {{can produce}} a {{secretion}} on their brachial gland (a gland on their arm) which when mixed with their saliva creates a volatile, noxious <b>toxin</b> that can be, if necessary, delivered in a bite to an aggressor. A bite causes a painful swelling and is slow to heal; the <b>toxin</b> is mild and not typically fatal, although an anaphylactic reaction is possible.|$|E
5|$|Type III toxin-antitoxin systems rely {{on direct}} {{interaction}} between a toxic protein and an RNA antitoxin. The toxic {{effects of the}} protein are neutralised by the RNA gene. One example is the <b>ToxIN</b> system from the bacterial plant pathogen Erwinia carotovora. The toxic ToxN protein is approximately 170 amino acids long and {{has been shown to}} be toxic to E. coli. The toxic activity of ToxN is inhibited by ToxI RNA, an RNA with 5.5 direct repeats of a 36 nucleotide motif (AGGTGATTTGCTACCTTTAAGTGCAGCTAGAAATTC). Crystallographic analysis of <b>ToxIN</b> has found that ToxN inhibition requires the formation of a trimeric <b>ToxIN</b> complex, whereby three ToxI monomers bind three ToxN monomers; the complex is held together by extensive protein-RNA interactions.|$|E
5|$|A third protein can {{sometimes}} be involved in type II toxin-antitoxin systems. In {{the case of the}} aforementioned MazEF addiction module, in addition to the <b>toxin</b> and antitoxin there is a regulatory protein involved called MazG. MazG protein interacts with E. colis Era GTPase and is described as a 'nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase,' which hydrolyses nucleoside triphosphates to monophosphates. Later research showed that MazG is transcribed in the same polycistronic mRNA as MazE and MazF, and that MazG bound the MazF <b>toxin</b> to further inhibit its activity.|$|E

50|$|Humans can inhale aerosolized brevetoxins. Brevetoxins become aerosolized by bubble-mediated {{transport}} of extracellular <b>toxins.</b> Through this process, bubbles transport the <b>toxins</b> to the water's surface, as the bubbles rupture they release the <b>toxins</b> into the air. The wind can then sweep these <b>toxins</b> toward shore, onto the beaches {{and into the}} communities {{where they can be}} inhaled by humans.|$|R
5|$|Although many natural toxins are {{secondary}} metabolites, these poisons {{also include}} peptides and proteins. An {{example of a}} toxic peptide is alpha-amanitin, which is found in relatives of the death cap mushroom. This is a potent enzyme inhibitor, in this case preventing the RNA polymerase II enzyme from transcribing DNA. The algal <b>toxin</b> microcystin is also a peptide and is an inhibitor of protein phosphatases. This <b>toxin</b> can contaminate water supplies after algal blooms and is a known carcinogen that can also cause acute liver hemorrhage and death at higher doses.|$|E

40|$|RTX <b>toxins</b> are {{bacterial}} pore-forming <b>toxins</b> {{that are}} particularly abundant among pathogenic species of Pasteurellaceae, {{in which they}} {{play a major role}} in virulence. RTX <b>toxins</b> of several primary pathogens of the family of Pasteurellaceae are directly involved in causing necrotic lesions in the target organs. Many RTX <b>toxins</b> are known as haemolysins because they lyse erythrocytes in vitro, an effect that is non-specific, but which serves as a useful marker in bacteriological identification and as an easily measurable signal in vitro in experimental studies. More recent studies have shown that the specific targets of most RTX <b>toxins</b> are leukocytes, with RTX <b>toxins</b> binding to the corresponding beta-subunit (CD 18) of beta 2 integrins and then exerting cytotoxic activity. After uptake by the target cell, at sub-lytic concentrations, some RTX <b>toxins</b> are transported to mitochondria and induce apoptosis. For several RTX <b>toxins</b> the binding to CD 18 has been shown to be host specific and this seems to be the basis for the host range specificity of these RTX <b>toxins.</b> Observations on two very closely related species of the Pasteurellaceae family, Actinobacillus suis, a porcine pathogen particularly affecting suckling pigs, and Actinobacillus equuli subsp. haemolytica, which causes pyosepticaemia in new-born foals (sleepy foal disease), have revealed that they express different RTX <b>toxins,</b> named ApxI/II and Aqx, respectively. These RTX <b>toxins</b> are specifically cytotoxic for porcine and equine leukocytes, respectively. Furthermore, the ApxI and Aqx <b>toxins</b> of these species, when expressed in an isogenetic background in Escherichia coli, are specifically cytotoxic for leukocytes of their respective hosts. These data indicate the determinative role of RTX <b>toxins</b> in host specificity of pathogenic species of Pasteurellaceae...|$|R
50|$|Many {{neurotoxins}} {{directly affect}} SNARE complexes. Such <b>toxins</b> as the botulinum and tetanus <b>toxins</b> work by targeting the SNARE components. These <b>toxins</b> prevent proper vesicle recycling {{and result in}} poor muscle control, spasms, paralysis, and even death.|$|R
50|$|BgK is {{composed}} of 37 amino acid residues, and three disulfide bonds. The neurotoxin belongs to a family of <b>toxins</b> found within 3 different sea anemones. The two other anemone/toxin combinations are: Stichodactyla helianthus and ShK; Anemonia viridis and AsKs. All three of these <b>toxins</b> have an affinity to dendrotoxin sensitive potassium channels that are found within rat brain membranes. BgK and ShK attenuate K+ channels in the neurons of rat dorsal ganglia, in vitro. AsKs stops potassium channel currents that are present in Xenopus oocytes. These <b>toxins</b> potentially represent a new structural type of potassium channel inhibitor. Compared to the short and well-studied scorpion <b>toxins,</b> these anemone <b>toxins</b> have comparable amino acid content (35-37 residues) and {{the same number of}} disulfide bridges (three). However, these anemone <b>toxins</b> do not share any sequential similarity.

5|$|Interactions between organisms {{can produce}} both {{conflict}} and cooperation. When the interaction is between pairs of species, {{such as a}} pathogen and a host, or a predator and its prey, these species can develop matched sets of adaptations. Here, the evolution of one species causes adaptations in a second species. These changes in the second species then, in turn, cause new adaptations in the first species. This cycle of selection and response is called coevolution. An example is the production of tetrodotoxin in the rough-skinned newt {{and the evolution of}} tetrodotoxin resistance in its predator, the common garter snake. In this predator-prey pair, an evolutionary arms race has produced high levels of <b>toxin</b> in the newt and correspondingly high levels of <b>toxin</b> resistance in the snake.|$|E
