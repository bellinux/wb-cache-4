500|$|The song's lyrics, {{written by}} Cyrus, Antonina Armato, Tim James and Devrim Karaoglu, have been mistakenly {{interpreted}} {{in a variety}} of ways. The song's protagonist sings in first person perspective while condemning an unspecified subject for wanting to invade her privacy. The majority of reviewers thought the protagonist was referring to a [...] "controlling boyfriend". Ben Ratliff of The New York Times sided with the boyfriend, and believed the song's protagonist was [...] "bullying some poor boy for the sin of wanting <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> talks about with her friends." [...] Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe believed the song could have described a number of subjects, such as [...] "a former boyfriend, the media, and even her fans." [...] However, in an interview with Jocelyn Vena of MTV News, Cyrus said the song was about [...] "the media" [...] and [...] "how they think they know everything about , when they don't. They want to be a fly on my wall and watch [...] 24/7." [...] Cyrus elaborated on the concept in an interview with Nancy O'Dell of Access Hollywood. She stated, ...|$|E

2500|$|The Glenwood Springs Ute Chief of November 12, 1887, {{wrote in}} his {{obituary}} that Holliday had been baptized in the Catholic Church. This was based on correspondence written between Holliday and his cousin, Sister Mary Melanie, a Catholic nun. No baptismal record {{has been found in}} either St. Stephen's Catholic Church in Glenwood Springs or at the Annunciation Catholic Church in nearby Leadville. Holliday's mother had been raised a Methodist and later joined a Presbyterian church (her husband's faith), but objected to the Presbyterian doctrine of predestination and reconverted to Methodism publicly before she died, saying that she wanted her son John <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> believed. Holliday himself was later to say that he had joined a Methodist church in Dallas. At the end of his life, Holliday had struck up friendships with both a Catholic priest, Father E.T. Downey, and a Presbyterian minister, Rev. W.S. Randolph, in Glenwood Springs. When he died, Father Downey was out of town, and so Rev. Randolph presided over the burial at 4pm {{on the same day that}} Holliday died. The services were reportedly attended by [...] "many friends".|$|E

"She's {{a mighty}} fine woman, an' {{all that kind}} of thing; but I'd like <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> hintin' at by leavin' them towels on the table; they was both there jest the same's last night, even though she must have known that we was washed up in great shape." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never {{you mind}} what I've heard. Who is she? IS IT MRS. M. THAT YOU GAVE THAT MONEY TO? I want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> who she is!

6000|$|Evidently anxious <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{would do}} in {{aforesaid}} case, Mr. Fletcher decided to put one before her as speedily as possible, so he said, in a pensive tone, and with a wistful glance: ...|$|E

Betty pretends not <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> talking about but then the noise comes again. She {{explains}} that it's just her son, Matthew, but then he walks up behind them, having just gotten home. Betty says a quick goodbye, leaving Susan more suspicious than ever. Betty complains to her psychiatrist that she can't sleep, telling him how her husband used to beat her and how she still has nightmares because she wasn't able to prevent him from killing their son. The doctor prescribes a sleeping pill, which she grinds up and puts in the food she brings to the chain-rattling captive in her basement.|$|R

6000|$|He {{had only}} to examine his own heart, and <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> meant. [...] "Say no more," [...] he {{answered}} sadly. [...] "We will keep as much {{away from each other}} as we can." ...|$|E

60|$|On {{their way}} home Mrs. Churton made a few weak {{attempts}} to draw her daughter into conversation, and was evidently curious <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{had been talking about}} so confidentially with the curate; but her efforts met with little success and were soon given up.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Ezra, no," [...] said Mirah, with low-toned intensity, [...] "that was not it.

500|$|Regarding the {{criticism}} that Balan's character might evoke, Luthria clarified, [...] "I wanted Vidya <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> doing is not crass or crude but can be shown aesthetically in a sensual manner {{with a touch of}} class. What her character does, is not cheap." [...] As a reference point, he also asked Balan to study 'similar themed' films such as Burlesque and Chicago. Balan also underwent salsa training to fine-tune herself with Smitha's languid body language.|$|R
5000|$|The 2010 film {{adaptation}} shows Susan {{in a few}} brief scenes newly {{added for}} the film. She is seen {{at the beginning of}} the film writing a letter to Edmund and Lucy. Later in the film, Lucy steals the page with the beauty spell from Coriakin's book and at night recites the spell. Looking in the cabin's full-length mirror, she sees herself, grown-up and beautiful, in effect becoming Susan. The mirror swings aside to reveal a society lawn party back in Lucy's world, and she steps through into the party to be joined by both Peter and Edmund, both of whom address her as [...] "Susan". When she tries to remind them about Narnia, to her growing horror, neither of them seem <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> talking about or <b>to</b> <b>know</b> anything about a younger sister named Lucy. Lucy then wakes up in the ship's cabin and is confronted by Aslan about <b>what</b> <b>she</b> has done. Aslan tells her not to judge herself by the standards of others, and reminds her that it was only through her actions that her siblings became aware of Narnia in the first place.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Whitefoot said nothing, but led the {{way down}} the tree with Whitefoot meekly following. Then began a patient search all about. Mrs. Whitefoot {{appeared}} <b>to</b> <b>know</b> just <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wanted and turned up her nose at several places Whitefoot thought would make fine homes. She hardly glanced at a fine hollow log Whitefoot found. She merely poked her nose in at a splendid hole beneath the roots of an old stump. Whitefoot began to grow tired from running about and climbing stumps and trees and bushes.|$|R
