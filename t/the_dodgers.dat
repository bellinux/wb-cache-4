5000|$|It {{is played}} {{with a minimum of}} three players. Two players stand about fifty feet apart facing each other and are {{considered}} the throwers. They are partners working together against the third player who is <b>the</b> <b>dodger.</b> <b>The</b> third player (<b>dodger),</b> runs back and forth in between the two throwers, whose job is to try to hit <b>the</b> <b>dodger</b> with a ball. The goal of <b>the</b> <b>dodger</b> is to dodge as many throws while running {{back and forth between the}} two throwers. The strategy is to stay as far as possible from the thrower that has the ball. For every attempt that <b>the</b> <b>dodger</b> dodges successfully they receive a point. A Thrower may strategically throw the ball to the opposite thrower in a manner where the ball is easy to catch and is of no threat to <b>the</b> <b>dodger</b> in an attempt to set up a play for the opposite thrower to get a good chance of hitting <b>the</b> <b>dodger.</b>|$|R
