50|$|Money in {{the sense}} of M1 is {{dominated}} as a store of value by interest-bearing assets. However, money is necessary to carry out transactions; in other words, it provides liquidity. This creates a trade-off between the liquidity advantage of holding money and the interest advantage of holding other assets. The demand for money is a result of this trade-off regarding the form in which a person's wealth should be held. In macroeconomics motivations for holding one's wealth in the form of money can roughly be divided into the <b>transaction</b> <b>motive</b> and the asset motive. These can be further subdivided into more microeconomically founded motivations for holding money.|$|E

If agents expect the future nominal interest rate (the return on bonds) to be lower than the current rate they will then reduce their holdings of money and increase their holdings of bonds.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse the role of trade credit in the {{financing}} of French small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) using specific data collected in a recent survey on small firms. We provide direct evidence that inter-firm credit offered by SMEs is sensitive to the strategic importance of firm size and position. Using existing theories, we also test a supply function and a model of demand for trade credit. On the one hand, results validate supply-side theories relative to a reduction of asymmetric information between the buyer and the seller. On the other hand, econometric exercises show that both a <b>transaction</b> <b>motive,</b> linked to efficient cash management, and a financing motive are significant determinant of trade credit demand.

40|$|Trade credit [...] credit {{extended}} by a seller {{who does not}} require immediate payment for delivery of a product [...] is {{an important source of}} funds for business customers. In 1987, such credit accounted for about 15 percent of the liabilities of nonfarm nonfinancial businesses in the United States, approximately the same percentage of liabilities as these firms' nonmortgage loans from banks. Trade credit apparently is especially important for small businesses: In the same year, it accounted for about 20 percent of small firms' liabilities.; Businesses that choose to finance their purchases through trade credit have several options for payment: They may pay the supplier promptly and in so doing receive a cash discount; wait until the bill's due date and consequently pay the interest cost implicit in forgoing the cash discount, at a rate frequently higher than the rate on credit from institutional lenders; or pay late, after the bill's due date, and thereby risk incurring additional costs in the form of explicit interest charges or penalties, or both. Although trade credit is an important source of funds for small businesses, little has been known about the reasons business customers use it.; Theoreticians have linked the use of trade credit to a <b>transaction</b> <b>motive</b> [...] a desire to realize economies in cash management [...] and to a financing motive [...] use of trade credit because credit from other sources, particularly from financial institutions, is limited. These theories are not mutually exclusive, yet no earlier study has integrated the two in a single theoretical or empirical model. Previous studies have focused on {{one or the other of}} the motives, and available empirical evidence on trade credit use, especially by small businesses, is limited.; This paper presents a model of trade credit demand that incorporates both the transaction and financing theories of trade credit use. The model relates characteristics of the firm to trade credit use associated with either the transaction or the financing motive. One important feature of the model is a link between trade credit use and credit rationing. This link permits an empirical test for the presence of rationing in markets for business credit.; The model of trade credit demand was used to analyze small businesses' decisions about using trade credit at all, about making late payments, and about the amount of trade credit to use. The data came from the National Survey of Small Business Finances, a one-time survey of a nationally representative sample of about 3, 400 businesses having 500 or fewer employees that were operating at the end of December 1987. (The survey was conducted in 1988 - 89 for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the U. S. Small Business Administration.); The results suggest that both the transaction and financing motives explain small businesses' use of trade credit. Characteristics of firms associated with the <b>transaction</b> <b>motive</b> [...] notably, a relatively large volume of purchases and relatively great variability in the timing of delivery of the purchases [...] were significantly related to a greater probability of using trade credit and a greater dollar amount of trade credit outstanding. Similarly, firm characteristics associated with a financing motive [...] relatively higher business and financial risk, among others [...] were significantly related not only to a greater probability of using trade credit and a greater dollar amount of trade credit outstanding, but also to a greater probability that the firm made some percentage of its payments on trade credit after the due date. These results are consistent with the predictions of theoretical models of transaction and financing motives for trade credit use.; The results suggest that the financing motive does not stem from the substitutability of trade credit and institutional credit. Instead, firms having relatively large amounts of short-term institutional credit were also the largest users of trade credit. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that small businesses are subject to credit rationing by financial institutions: Firms with already-high levels of debt from financial institutions, facing limitations on additional institutional credit, turn to trade credit as a source of additional credit despite the high implicit interest cost.; Also investigated using the model of trade credit demand was the relative importance of the transaction and financing motives. The size of the financing component of trade credit demand ranged from about two-fifths to one-half the estimated size of the transaction component. Clearly, each motive accounts for a sizable portion of total trade credit demand. Thus, both the <b>transaction</b> <b>motive</b> and the financing motive appear to be economically significant determinants of trade credit use. Credit; Trade; Small business...|$|E

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this essay are threefold: first, to provide a microtheoretic framework that incorporates the <b>transaction</b> <b>motive</b> for holding money in a multicurrency world; second, {{to show how the}} recent "currency substitution theory" can be embedded in the micro choice model we develop; third, to derive some comparative static results from a macro model that allows agents to hold different currencies. Recently, Cuddington noted in a paper discussing the issue of currency substitution that we still lack an explicit microtheoretic framework clarifying the transaction roles of different currencies in a multicurrency world. Tobin also seems to call for an analysis of the service yields of different currencies. The next section discusses what properties a transaction technology describing the transaction roles of currencies should satisfy. Section 3. 1 then formalizes the individual choice problem that determines the demand for the various currencies. The second part of section 3 describes how the currency substitution literature is related to our model. Several results on currency substitution are shown to be nested hypotheses of our general model. A short-run general equilibrium model for two open economies is developed in the fourth section in order to derive some implications in the presence of currency substitution. The way in which expectations are introduced into the model can be described as a form of bounded rationality. The exchange rate in the model has the feature that it is an element of the price to holders of one currency of every asset and commodity denominated in the other currency. In the last section we investigate the issue of currency substitution on a macro level. By comparing comparative static results for economies with and without currency substitution present, we are able to analyze the qualitative and quantitative aspects of currency substitution.

40|$|Economists {{have argued}} that a {{long-term}} inflation target near 2 % is optimal (Summers, 1991; Fischer, 1996; Goodfriend, 2002; Coenen et al., 2003; Bernanke, 2003). However, these arguments are really about why a low positive inflation rate is ideal to avoid a deflationary trap, not explaining why the specific value of 2 % (or a value near it) {{happens to be the}} optimal long-run inflation rate. In line with the <b>transaction</b> <b>motive</b> literature (Baumol, 1952 and Tobin, 1956), I postulate that new forms of money and technological progress generate cost savings in the transaction technology by comparison to barter. I derive the optimal velocity of money, which depends on real GDP/capita and the net return on depository institutions’ assets. As long as progress is on average biased towards new forms of money, the velocity of money will grow at a pace slower than long-term real GDP/capita growth; i. e. less than 2 %. The empirical tests using Johansen’s (1995) VECM approach for the U. S. over the period 1959 - 2007 confirm that this is indeed the case. Along with a parameter representing the type of bias in the technical progress affecting transactions, the depository institutions’ overall mean leverage ratio also appears as a key parameter in the long-run equilibrium equation describing the behavior of the velocity of narrow money (M 1, M 1 RS and M 1 S). I show that a ‘naïve’ Friedman k-percent monetary rule that aims at growing the money supply {{at the same rate as}} real GDP naturally leads to a rate of inflation equal to the rate of velocity growth. Hence, setting an inflation target near but below 2 % makes economic sense. In spite of previously held beliefs, a money growth objective is compatible with an interest-targeting objective; i. e. a derived Taylor (1993) type rule. A Taylor rule that embeds the optimal inflation target defined here is more flexible to account for possible changes in velocity vs. a pure money growth rule. ...|$|E

This paper starts off with analyzing the inherent logic of liquidity preference theory and presents a new interpretation of the theory in a more logical and clear manner. The reinterpretation clearly indicates the necessity of introducing liquidity preference analysis into determination of interest rate, arguing that it is the liquidity preference analysis based on finance motive, rather than on <b>transactions</b> <b>motive,</b> that plays a more fundamental role in determining interest rate. The paper then points out a crucial and unsolved mistake in Keynes’s liquidity preference theory, i. e. interest rate is indeterminate, which is revealed by introducing finance motive into the theory.

This study is an analysis of the velocity of circulation and its recent behavior. The demand for real balances relative to real income depends upon transactions requirements and on the factors which affect the size of transactions balances. Both goods transactions and asset transactions are shown {{to play a role in}} the determination of the velocity of circulation. The expected rate of inflation is shown to play a role in the pattern of velocity over time. The impact of financial and goods market volatility play a role as risk factors in the determination of the demand for real balances relative to real income. The goal of this study is to present a model of the velocity of circulation which makes use of changes in financial markets and swings in inflationary expectations to explain the apparent breakdown in the relationship between money and income. The major difference between the theory developed here and the theory which formed the basis for most of the previous studies is the emphasis placed on the <b>transactions</b> <b>motive</b> for holding money and the de-emphasis of the role of money as an asset serving some liquidity preference motive or speculative motive. The major conclusions of the study are that including measures for financial transactions, inflationary expectations, intermediate goods transactions, and risk factors in a velocity of circulation analysis helps to explain much of the movement of velocity over time.
