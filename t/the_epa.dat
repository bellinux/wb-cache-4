40|$|This {{project will}} focus on the Economic Partnership Agreement (<b>EPA)</b> between <b>the</b> European union and the African, Caribbean and Pacific group of states (ACP), and the {{difficulties}} surrounding the EPA-negotiations. The project aims to determine the cause of the problematic implementations of <b>the</b> <b>EPAs.</b> To do so, we will be looking at the background and context of <b>the</b> <b>EPAs,</b> and explain <b>the</b> ground principles of the agreement, as well as the negotiation process, with a special focus on the Sub-Saharan countries. This report will then analyse the theoretical foundation of <b>the</b> <b>EPAs,</b> {{in order to determine the}} theoretical approach to the goals and means of the agreement. Furthermore, we will analyse the criticism of <b>the</b> <b>EPAs</b> raised by a number of internal sources, in the form of a number of ministers from the Sub-Saharan ACP countries, and external sources, in the form of International NGO’s, in order to determine the reasons behind this criticism. This will lead to a brief assessment of the coherence between the criticisms, made respectively by the internal and external sources connected to the EPA-negotiations. This study will conclude that the differences between <b>the</b> <b>EPAs</b> and its supporters on one side, and the critics of <b>the</b> <b>EPAs</b> on <b>the</b> other, can be explained by fundamentally different theoretical views on how to best secure the development of the ACP-countries. Furthermore, a lack of resources and assistance of the ACP-countries has hindered the implementation of <b>the</b> <b>EPAs.</b> This leads to the conclusion, that it is not a reluctance to engage in a trade agreement between the EU and ACP that has made the implementations of <b>the</b> <b>EPA’s</b> so difficult, but instead it is the different theoretical views on how to best secure the development of the ACP-countries, as well as the technical difficulties surrounding corporation between two unequal partners, that has hampered the implementation of <b>the</b> <b>EPAs...</b>|$|R

40|$|This study {{tries to}} {{quantify}} the concerns {{that have been raised}} often on adjustment costs likely to be faced by African countries and makes recommendations of how <b>the</b> <b>EPAs</b> could be made to work in Africa’s favour. The study addresses the following questions. First, how are African countries likely to gain or lose from a bilateral trade liberalisation between Africa and the EU as governed by <b>the</b> <b>EPAs</b> reciprocity principle? Second, what sectors in Africa are most likely to lose and what sectors gain from <b>the</b> <b>EPAs?</b> Third, what are the welfare implications for the African countries from <b>the</b> <b>EPAs?</b> Fourth, how will <b>the</b> formation of <b>EPAs</b> affect trade expansion through trade creation and trade diversion effects? Fifth, what are the potential fiscal implications of <b>the</b> <b>EPAs?</b> Lastly, {{what are the implications of}} <b>the</b> <b>EPAs</b> on regional integration? A key finding of the study is that full reciprocity will be very costly for Africa in terms of revenue losses, adjustment costs associated with de-industrialisation and its undermining effect of regional integration. Of major concern was this finding that even though the full reciprocity principle appears to be trade expanding globally (singularly in favour of EU), it will pose serious implications for deepening of regional integration in Africa...|$|R

5|$|The United States Clean Air Act, {{passed in}} 1990, put mercury {{on a list}} of toxic {{pollutants}} that need to be controlled to the greatest possible extent. Thus, industries that release high concentrations of mercury into the environment agreed to install maximum achievable control technologies (MACT). In March 2005, <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> promulgated a regulation that added power plants to the list of sources that should be controlled and instituted a national cap and trade system. States were given until November 2006 to impose stricter controls, but after a legal challenge from several states, the regulations were struck down by a federal appeals court on 8 February 2008. The rule was deemed not sufficient to protect the health of persons living near coal-fired power plants, given the negative effects documented in <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> Study Report to Congress of 1998. However newer data published in 2015 showed that after introduction of the stricter controls mercury declined sharply, indicating that the Clean Air Act had its intended impact.|$|E

50|$|Supporters of the bill, {{including}} Rep.

Supporters also argued that communities would be stuck with millions of dollars' worth of non-compliant fire hydrants they could not use if <b>the</b> <b>EPA's</b> rule took effect. Adding additional urgency to the situation, winter is when more hydrants are replaced due to damage from freezing or being hit by cars driving on slippery roads.|$|R

5|$|By {{the time}} the action is fully implemented, <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> {{estimates}} that 2.6million tons of smog-causing nitrogen oxide emissions will be eliminated each year. Soot or particulate matter will be reduced by an estimated 110,000tons a year. The reduction in sulfur will also prevent an estimated 8,300premature deaths, 5,500cases of chronic bronchitis and 17,600cases of acute bronchitis in children. In addition, an estimated 360,000asthma attacks and 386,000cases of respiratory symptoms in asthmatic children will also be avoided every year.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} 10,000 years, <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> would retain the 2001 final rule’s dose limit of 15millirem per year. This is {{protection}} {{at the level}} of the most stringent radiation regulations in the U.S. today. From 10,000 to one million years, EPA established a dose limit of 100millirem per year. EPA's rule requires the Department of Energy to show that Yucca Mountain can safely contain wastes, considering the effects of earthquakes, volcanic activity, climate change, and container corrosion, over one million years. The current analysis indicates that the repository will cause less than 1mrem/year public dose through 1,000,000 years.|$|E

The lawsuit follows a dramatic die off of bees in the United States, with some beekeepers losing 50% of their hives. <b>The</b> <b>EPA</b> responded to the suit by issuing a report blaming the Varroa mite for the decline in bees and claiming the role of neonicotinoids in bee extinction has been overstated.|$|E
5|$|In November 2008, Hershey Creamery Company {{became the}} first company {{in the nation to}} be prosecuted and fined for failing to {{implement}} a Risk Management Program (RMP) as required by the Clean Air Act. The charges were brought by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which stated that the company failed to develop the required plans with regard to its storage and use of anhydrous ammonia, which is a regulated substance. In the charges, <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> noted that the creamery twice certified that it had developed the RMP plan, once in 1999 and again in 2004. Later inspection showed that the certifications were false and on December 7, 2006, <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> issued a civil compliance order against the company, ordering the company to come into compliance. Hershey Creamery complied and in April 2007 submitted the appropriate RMPs, which were confirmed to be in-place through subsequent inspection. The case was heard at the Federal Middle District court of Pennsylvania, with Hershey Creamery pleading guilty to the charges; it was subsequently fined $100,000 and given a year probation.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency {{is charged}} with {{regulating}} and managing mercury contamination.

Additionally, the Mercury-Containing and Rechargeable Battery Management Act, passed in 1996, phases out the use of mercury in batteries, and provides for the efficient and cost-effective disposal of many types of used batteries.
