40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a {{measurement of the}} resonance integral and <b>thermal</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> – which together represent the total neutron absorption cross section – of the naturally occurring isotopes of platinum that emit gamma radiation upon neutron absorption. The measurements were made via neutron activation analysis. Platinum samples were bombarded by neutrons produced in Oregon State University’s TRIGA nuclear reactor. Afterwards, the decay of the excited samples was measured to determine the activity of each isotope, yielding measurements of the cross sections for each. This experiment was repeated multiple times in different reactor locations to improve accuracy. Previous measurements of these values have been flawed by poor photon detector resolution, and evolving branching ratios, half-lives, natural abundances. A search of the literature reveals poor agreement and large error estimations. The results from this thesis are consistent, with one exception: {{there appears to be}} a systematic disagreement between the resonance integral measurements of samples bombarded in two different reactor locations. This discrepancy has now been seen in several experiments, which indicates inconsistent epithermal flux throughout OSU’s reactor...|$|E
40|$|We derive {{constraints}} on parameters of generic dark matter candidates by comparing the-oretical predictions with the gamma-ray emission observed by the Fermi-LAT {{from the region}} around the Galactic Center. Our analysis is conservative since it simply requires that the ex-pected dark matter signal does not exceed the observed emission. The constraints obtained in the likely case that the collapse of baryons to the Galactic Center is accompanied by the con-traction of the dark matter are strong. In particular, we find that for bb ̄ and τ+τ − or W+W− dark matter annihilation channels, the upper limits on the annihilation cross section imply that the <b>thermal</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> is excluded for a Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) mass smaller than about 700 and 500 GeV, respectively. For the µ+µ − channel, where {{the effect of the}} inverse Compton scattering is important, depending on models of the Galactic magnetic field the exclusion of the thermal cross-section is for a WIMP mass smaller than about 150 to 400 GeV.

40|$|Any form of {{dark matter}} which was in thermal {{equilibrium}} with the Standard Model in the early Universe must have some annihilation mechanism {{in order to avoid}} overclosure. In general, such models are now constrained by the negative experimental results from colliders, direct detection, and indirect detection, all of which are capable of probing interactions at the approximate strength suggested by a <b>thermal</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section.</b> It is timely to consider what scenarios of thermal dark matter which are still viable. In this paper we consider a class {{of dark matter}} models which is designed to avoid many of the current constraints: Majorana dark matter coupling to the Standard Model through leptophilic singlet scalars and pseudoscalars. We show that requiring realistic electroweak symmetry breaking generically forces the mediators to couple with quarks, allowing these models to be constrained by the current experimental data. We find that [...] barring fine-tuning [...] this type of thermal dark matter is excluded by a combination of direct and indirect detection for masses below ∼ 100 GeV.
