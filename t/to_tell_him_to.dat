5|$|The three {{families}} travel to a dude ranch in Wyoming. In the Pritchett family storyline, Gloria (Sofía Vergara) experiences hearing difficulty following the plane ride while a cowboy, Hank (Tim Blake Nelson), flirts with her. Gloria's husband, Jay (Ed O'Neill), takes notice, but Gloria is oblivious to his behavior. Later, Hank grabs Gloria's butt causing Jay <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> back off, which he does. He said {{if it were}} not for him being the bad guy Jay would not have been a hero, but Gloria fights back and says Jay is always a hero.|$|E

25|$|A disciple named Vakkali, {{who later}} became an arahant, was so obsessed by the Buddha's {{physical}} presence that the Buddha {{is said to have}} felt impelled <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> desist, and to have reminded him that he should know the Buddha through the Dhamma and not through physical appearances.|$|E
6000|$|<b>To</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> seemed disloyalty <b>to</b> her sex; not <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him,</b> disloyalty <b>to</b> her husband.

50|$|Tyler Robuck is introduced, {{explaining}} that he grew up just like everyone else, except gay and in the closet. He came out but struggled with feelings of depression. One day while out for a run, he felt like God spoke <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>telling</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> open a gay bar, so he moved to West Hollywood.|$|R
25|$|God's {{word came}} to Jeremiah <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> go and cry in {{the ears of}} Jerusalem that God remembered the affection of her youth, her love as a bride, how she {{followed}} God in the wilderness. Israel was God's hallowed portion and God's first-fruits, and all that devoured Israel would be held guilty and evil would come upon them.|$|E
25|$|When Tom Riddle {{opened the}} Chamber, Myrtle was sulking in a stall after being teased by student Olive Hornby. She opened the door, {{intending}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> leave, but died immediately upon meeting the Basilisk's gaze {{and decided to}} become a ghost to revenge on Hornby. Her bathroom remains operational, but is rarely used by students because of Myrtle's disagreeable presence and her habit of flooding it when she is distraught.|$|E
25|$|When Elisha heard, {{he invited}} the king to send Naaman to him, and so Naaman came to Elisha's {{house with his}} horses and his chariots. Elisha sent a {{messenger}} to Naaman <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> wash seven times in the Jordan River and be healed, but that angered Naaman, who expected Elisha to come out, call on the name of God, and wave his hands over Naaman. Naaman asked whether the Amanah and Pharpar rivers of Damascus were not better than any river in Israel, {{so that he might}} wash in them and be clean.|$|E

25|$|In response, Bone {{decided to}} speed up the relay and {{authorized}} additional drivers for Seppala's leg of the relay, so they could travel without rest. Seppala was still scheduled to cover the most dangerous leg, the shortcut across Norton Sound, but the telephone and telegraph systems bypassed the small villages he was passing through, {{and there was no way}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> wait at Shaktoolik. The plan relied on the driver from the north catching Seppala on the trail. Summers arranged for drivers along the last leg, including Seppala's colleague Gunnar Kaasen.|$|E
25|$|Thaxton's men did nothing. Hunter {{contacted}} the adjutant general himself and {{convinced him to}} mobilize troops. Lester, who had left the area several days earlier, was reached by phone in Chicago. Realizing {{the gravity of the}} situation, he agreed to close the mine {{for the remainder of the}} nationwide UMWA strike. Hunter and a citizens' group laid out a plan to get a truce in place — telephoning McDowell <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> raise a white flag, and asking the UMWA sub-district vice president, Fox Hughes, to go to the mine and do the same. The method of getting the strikebreakers safely out of the mine was to be worked out later.|$|E
25|$|Alfie {{tries to}} start a {{football}} team for the pub, and Kat takes it over. She flirts {{in order to get}} people to sign up, and continues flirting at a party, with Ray Dixon (Chucky Venn), Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), Derek, Max Branning (Jake Wood) and Michael, sharing a close moment with each of them. While in the kitchen alone, an unseen man enters and he and Kat have a sexual encounter. She feels guilty the next day and attempts to neglect calls and texts from the mystery man, who has bought her a new phone. Kat eventually responds and talks with the man <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> leave her alone, but changes her mind and they begin a frequent affair, and he supplies them with a flat to use. Kat endeavours several times to end it, but she continuously succumbs. He falls in love with her, with Kat reciprocating, and when he sends Kat flowers, Alfie becomes suspicious. Kat lies they are from Charlie, but Alfie does not believe her and asks her to be totally honest, to which Kat reveals her three-month affair, telling him he does not know the other man. Alfie is furious and throws her out. After a heart-to-heart with Michael, Kat returns to The Queen Victoria to ask for Alfie's forgiveness and suggests going away for a while.|$|E

25|$|Swanson was {{angered by}} the response, as she felt those very studios had {{produced}} questionable films themselves, and were jealous at not having the chance to produce Rain. After another threatening telegram, she decided to first appeal to the MPAA, and then the newspapers. She only heard back from Marcus Loew, who promised to appeal on her behalf, and since he owned a chain of theatres this eased some of her concerns. Figuring the silence meant the matter had been dropped, Swanson began filming on Sadie Thompson which already had $250,000 invested in it. Before casting began, the young Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. wanted to audition {{for the role of}} Handsome O'Hara. However, Swanson felt he was too young and not right for the role. Lionel Barrymore had been first picked to play Davidson but was thought to be too ill at the time, though he eventually won the role. Barrymore wore the same outfit for an entire week, aggravating Swanson. She asked some of the crew <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> change and wash, which he did. Aside from this, Swanson was happy with his performance. Walsh had not appeared {{in front of a camera}} in eight years, and feared he would not be able to direct and act at the same time. However, two days into filming, his fears had disappeared.|$|E
25|$|The special {{subcommittee}} met for {{the first}} time on March 3, 1888, and heard testimony in the matter its first day. PHC director L.H. Schneider testified about the organization's 1860 charter, the 1886 amendments to the charter, and Section 3's bar against the construction of roads in the cemetery. Schneider also testified that the city commissioners were well aware of Section 3's prohibition on new roads. City Commissioner Webb reviewed for the subcommittee the city's initial attempt to extend North Capitol Street in late 1886. He noted that the commissioners did not approve construction at that time, as federal law appeared to bar it. Webb claimed that the GESPHC approached the city with news of the subdivision and their willingness to allow the city to cut the road. The city commissioners told the GESPHC that the organization had no authority to subdivide the cemetery or donate any burial ground, and that the city commissioners had never approved the street's extension. Webb claimed that Colonel Ludlow had illegally issued orders sending work crews into the cemetery. Superintendent of Roads Beale testified that Colonel Ludlow verbally ordered him to begin work on December 14, that no countermanding order was ever received, and that work began on the cemetery grounds on December 23. The work ceased at the end of that day when Ludlow phoned <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> stop. Beale also told the subcommittee that it was not until December 29 that Commissioner Wheatley issued a written order to stop work.|$|E
500|$|Shilts accused Ronald Reagan of {{neglecting}} {{to address}} AIDS to the American people until 1987—calling his behavior [...] "ritualistic silence"—even after Reagan called friend Rock Hudson <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> get well. After Hudson's death {{and in the}} face of increasing public anxiety, Reagan directed Surgeon General C. Everett Koop to provide a report on the epidemic. Though Koop was a political conservative, his report was nevertheless clear about what causes AIDS and what people and the U.S. government should do to stop it, including sex and AIDS education provided for all people.|$|E

5000|$|During {{a two-week}} period, Wilson {{consumed}} peyote for spiritual reasons {{and says he}} was shown essential astronomical symbols representing the life of Jesus Christ. These messages became part of his own teaching, which nevertheless remained reliant purely on peyote.

500|$|By {{the end of}} the evening, Khánh was in Da Lat {{when his}} plane ran out of fuel, and no pumps were open at the time, so he was marooned there for the night. He phoned Saigon asking for re-supply, but his rivals denied his wish. Fearing a Khánh comeback, the Armed Force Council met again and {{unanimously}} resolved to make contingency plans to repel any counter-insurrection by Khánh. Westmoreland sent Colonel Jasper Wilson, Khánh's former confidant and adviser at corps level, to go to Da Lat to convince the Vietnamese general to resign and allow a new military leadership to take the reins. A year earlier, Wilson had helped Khánh depose Minh. Khánh initially refused to depart, calling the coup an American initiative and saying if he capitulated now, it would simply prove that the Americans were involved, as Wilson had been sent <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> leave.|$|E
500|$|JJ visits his psychiatrist, Dr Felly (Paul Ridley), {{seeking help}} for his recent bouts {{of rage and}} his {{confusion}} about his life and friends. Dr Felly has poor advice for JJ and prescribes him more drugs to calm him down. As he is leaving, he meets Emily, {{who came to the}} clinic to receive counselling in being more honest, but was simply prescribed the same drugs as JJ. She comes out to him and he shares with her his longing to be [...] "normal" [...] for a day so that he could lose his virginity and reunite Freddie and Cook. She advises him to just ask for the things he wants, so they visit Freddie <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> make up with Cook. At Freddie's house, though, they walk in on Freddie having sex with Emily's twin sister, Katie (Megan Prescott), and JJ accidentally outs Emily as a lesbian, leaving Katie looking visibly shaken. JJ asks Freddie to make up with Cook, but Freddie refuses and tells JJ to choose between him and Cook.|$|E
500|$|Tom Dowd {{produced}} At Fillmore East; he {{had previously}} worked on their second studio album, Idlewild South. He had recently returned from Africa from working on the film Soul to Soul, and stayed in New York several days to oversee the live recording. [...] "It was a good truck, with a 16-track machine and a great, tough-as-nails staff {{who took care of}} business," [...] recalled Dowd. He gave the staff suggestions and noted the band had two lead guitarists and two drummers, [...] "which was unusual, and it took some foresight to properly capture the dynamics." [...] Things went smoothly until the band unexpectedly brought out saxophonist Rudolph [...] "Juicy" [...] Carter, an unknown horn player, and longstanding [...] "unofficial" [...] band member Thom Doucette on harmonica. [...] "I was just hoping we could isolate them, so we could wipe them and use the songs, but they started playing and the horns were leaking all over everything, rendering the songs unusable," [...] said Dowd. He rushed to Duane during the break <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> cut the horn players; while Duane loved the players, he put up no fight with Dowd. The final show was delayed because of a bomb scare, and did not end until 6 am.|$|E

500|$|Weiss {{additionally}} {{spoke about}} the introduction of Lyanna Mormont in the series, with Weiss saying, [...] "We were excited {{about the prospect of}} the character because she's mentioned in passing in the previous season," [...] referring to her letter to Stannis denying him men, and swearing fealty to House Stark. Weiss added, [...] "The more we thought about it, Jon is going to come up against so many old guys with beards in the North that like 'What if she was a tougher audience?' It seemed like an inherently fun scene to watch, it also is terrifying because it's putting a lot of dramatic weight on the shoulders of somebody who needs to be very young." [...] David Benioff concluded the featurette speaking about the Ironborn story, noting [...] "Yara's not a therapist, in our kind of sense of the word, she's not there <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> 'buck up' and 'everything's going to be okay,' it's a pretty brutal kind of therapy, but that's who they are, I mean they're essentially a Viking people. There's not {{a lot of room for}} sort of soft, and gentle psychology. I think it's the kind of tough love Theon needed at this point, and when he finally raises his eyes, and looks into her eyes, we see a glimpse of the old Theon that had been lost for so long." ...|$|E
500|$|MacGregor bombastically {{announced}} {{his intention to}} liberate New Granada, but then hesitated. The lack of action, rations or pay for weeks prompted most of the British volunteers to go home. MacGregor's force, which had comprised 900 men at its peak (including officers), had dwindled {{to no more than}} 250 by the time he directed the Amelia and two other vessels to Rio de la Hacha on 29 September 1819. His remaining officers included Lieutenant-Colonel Michael Rafter, who had bought a commission with the hope of rescuing his brother William. After being driven away from Rio de la Hacha harbour by cannon on 4 October, MacGregor ordered a night landing west of the town and said that he would take personal command once the troops were ashore. Lieutenant-Colonel William Norcott led the men onto the beach and waited there two hours for MacGregor to arrive, but the general failed to appear. Attacked by a larger Spanish force, Norcott countered and captured the town. MacGregor still refused to leave the ships, convinced that the flag flying over the fort must be a trick; even when Norcott rowed out <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> come into port, MacGregor would not step ashore for over a day. When he did appear, many of his soldiers swore and spat at him. He issued another lofty proclamation, recalled by Rafter as an [...] "aberration of human intellect", at the foot of which MacGregor identified himself as [...] "His Majesty the Inca of New Granada".|$|E
