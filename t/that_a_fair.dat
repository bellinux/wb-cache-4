5|$|The court {{decided that}} it would be {{reasonably}} possible for a jury to convict Thomas based on the available evidence, so it then considered whether there were factors which would make a retrial unjust. Thomas' lawyer Lex Lasry argued that the delay in Thomas' prosecution (he was not arrested until seventeen months after he returned to Australia) and the extensive media coverage of the case meant it was unlikely Thomas would get a fair trial, and that a retrial would be an undue hardship on Thomas given that he has spent long periods in custody, mostly in solitary confinement, without conviction, which has led to him being diagnosed with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. The court was of the opinion <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> trial was not impossible in these circumstances, and although the other factors were considered, the court ultimately decided that the circumstances did not preclude a retrial.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the {{reasonable}} suspicion test asks whether a reasonable and fair-minded person sitting {{in court and}} knowing all the relevant facts would have a reasonable suspicion <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> trial for the litigant is not possible. Although not currently adopted in the UK, this test has been endorsed by the Singapore courts.|$|E

25|$|The DMK {{government}} {{lost power}} to the Jayalalithaa-led AIADMK government in 2001. In 2003, the party requested that the court proceedings take place outside Tamil Nadu because it doubted <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> trial would happen under her governance. The case {{was transferred to the}} neighbouring state of Karnataka. During May 2010, Jayalalithaa's counsel argued that those in charge of the proceedings were not competent to run the case. The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal.|$|E
25|$|The SCJA {{does not}} contain any {{provisions}} {{similar to the ones}} referred to above that apply to Supreme Court judges. Nonetheless, at common law a judge can be disqualified from hearing or deciding a case {{if he or she is}} actually biased against a party, or appears to biased. The test for apparent bias is whether a reasonable and fair-minded person sitting in court and knowing all the relevant facts would have a reasonable suspicion <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> trial for the litigant is not possible.|$|E

25|$|An Act of Parliament (the Central Criminal Court Act 1856) {{was passed}} {{to allow the}} trial {{to be held at}} The Old Bailey in London, as it was felt <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> jury could not be found in Staffordshire, where {{detailed}} accounts of the case and the deaths of his children were printed by local newspapers.

25|$|Naturally, in an {{organisation}} {{of critical}} thinkers that has endured for a century, {{the existence of}} some disagreement is inevitable. Indeed, it would be true to say <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> number of internal debates and disagreements have arisen in the Socialist Party concerning issues {{not covered by the}} Declaration of Principles and not addressed in the initial membership test – in other words, issues which are somewhat peripheral or incidental rather than core and fundamental. These issues have included the Party's exact attitude to trade unionism, its view of capitalist economic crises, and – in more recent years – whether something akin to law will exist in socialist society.|$|E
25|$|The {{view has}} been taken by {{scholars}} {{that there is no}} practical difference between the reasonable suspicion and real likelihood tests. In a 2008 paper, Lionel Leo and Chen Siyuan concede that there is a slight difference in the meaning of the terms real likelihood and reasonable suspicion, but are of the view that this difference is hardly material. The gap between the two tests is considerably narrow and, in practice, the two tests are unlikely to yield different results in most cases. It was stated in Cook International Inc. v. B.V. Handelmaatschappij Jean Delvaux (1985) that the contrast between the tests was between reasonable suspicion of bias on the one hand, and the appearance of a real likelihood of bias on the other. Hence what must be established is the appearance of a real possibility of bias and this is not very different from establishing that a fair-minded member of the public could have a reasonable suspicion <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> trial for the litigant was not possible.|$|E

Noting {{that there is a}} {{difference}} between [...] "rock critics" [...] and the [...] "rock press", he lists the [...] "establishment" [...] members as himself, Jon Landau, Dave Marsh, Paul Nelson, and John Rockwell. Christgau also concedes that [...] "Because we are all self-taught (of necessity, since our academy is as yet informal), even the best of our work has the faults of autodidacticism: eccentricity, incompleteness, self-indulgence. The worst of our work, meanwhile, has the faults of drivel. ... Yet I read on, as much from inclination as from duty, and find <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> portion of what is bad, like some strains of 'bad' rock and roll, has the sloppy appeal of all open, democratic phenomena." [...] Christgau later accused Rolling Stone of promoting a [...] "boring rock-as-idealism myth" [...] and [...] "claiming suzerainty over the music ever since" [...] the magazine was founded in 1967.|$|E
500|$|On 6 October 1955, Diệm {{announced}} the referendum {{would be held}} on 23 October. The election was open {{to men and women}} aged 18 or over, and the government arranged to have a polling station set up for every 1,000 registered voters. The poll was contested by Bảo Đại, who had spent much of his time in France and advocated a monarchy, and Diệm, who ran on a republican platform. According to historian Jessica Chapman, it was a choice between [...] "the country's obsolete emperor and its far-from-popular prime minister, Ngo Dinh Diem". In announcing the referendum, Diệm portrayed his decision as being motivated by a love of democracy and popular discontent with the rule of Bảo Đại. The prime minister cited a plethora of petitions from various social, religious, and political groups calling on him to stage a plebiscite to remove Bảo Đại, claiming he was motivated by these [...] "legitimate and democratic" [...] sentiments. Lansdale cautioned Diệm against electoral fraud, confident that Diệm would win a free election: [...] "While I'm away I don't want to suddenly read that you have won by 99.99%. I would know that it's rigged then." [...] U.S. officials thought <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> election would have seen Diệm poll between 60% and 70% of the vote.|$|E

[...] "How can we be satisfied <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> and impartial jury was picked when the judge doesn't follow up when the juror said, 'I'm a victim of this crime, Sotomayor asked.

The Court of Appeal had established in Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v. Lee Kuan Yew (1992) that the applicable test in Singapore for apparent bias was the reasonable suspicion test. The judges held that the question to be asked under the test was: [...] "Would a reasonable and fair-minded person sitting in court and knowing all the relevant facts have a reasonable suspicion <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> trial for the applicant was not possible?" ...|$|E
