5|$|Most {{information}} about the carucage comes from the financial records associated with its collection, {{but there is no}} detailed description of the way it was collected or assessed, unlike the account of the workings of the Exchequer given in the Dialogue Concerning the Exchequer, written in about 1180. Government records such as the Pipe Rolls, the Memoranda Rolls, and other financial records, some of which are specific to the carucage, have survived, and include records of assessments and receipts for the sums collected. There are also occasional references <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> in medieval chronicles, supplementing the information found in the financial records.|$|E
5|$|Issues {{surrounding}} {{the planning and}} construction of L'Enfant Plaza (immediately {{to the west of}} the site) delayed construction of any buildings on the block until the late 1960s. In 1963, the RLA purchased the land from the Westminster Memorial Church, Fifth Baptist Church, and homeowners. The United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare wished to purchase the site for its new headquarters, but the RLA declined to sell the property. (The federal government does not pay taxes on land and structures it owns, and the RLA wanted a private owner who would add <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> base.) The RLA attempted to sell the land on January 29, 1965, but there were no buyers.|$|E
5|$|Many {{residents}} of the western frontier petitioned against passage of the whiskey excise. When that failed, some western Pennsylvanians organized extralegal conventions to advocate repeal of the law. Opposition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> was particularly prevalent in four southwestern counties: Allegheny, Fayette, Washington, and Westmoreland. A preliminary meeting held on July 27, 1791 at Redstone Old Fort in Fayette County called for the selection of delegates to a more formal assembly, which convened in Pittsburgh in early September 1791. The Pittsburgh convention was dominated by moderates such as Hugh Henry Brackenridge, who hoped to prevent the outbreak of violence. The convention sent a petition for redress of grievances to the Pennsylvania Assembly and the U.S House of Representatives, both located in Philadelphia. As {{a result of this}} and other petitions, the excise law was modified in May 1792. Changes included a 1-cent reduction in the tax that was advocated by William Findley, a congressman from western Pennsylvania, but the new excise law was still unsatisfactory to many westerners.|$|E

5|$|At Matthias Corvinus' instance, the Diet of Hungary {{abolished}} {{all previous}} exemptions relating <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> {{known as the}} chamber's profit. The leaders of the Three Nations of Transylvania who regarded the reform as an infringement of their privileges declared on 18 August 1467 that {{they were ready to}} fight to defend their liberties. Stephen promised support to them, but they yielded to Corvinus without resistance after the king marched to Transylvania. Corvinus invaded Moldavia and captured Baia, Bacău, Roman and Târgu Neamț. Stephen assembled his army and launched a crushing defeat on the invaders in the Battle of Baia on 15 December. This episode was presented in contemporary Hungarian chronicles as a defeat of Stephen's armies. However, Corvinus, who received wounds in the battle, could only escape from the battlefield with the help of Moldavian boyars who had joined him. A group of boyars rose up against Stephen in the Lower Country, but he had 20 boyars and 40 other landowners captured and executed {{before the end of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|Other {{accounts}} {{describe the}} indictment of 24 men for high treason. Most of the accused had eluded capture, so only ten men stood trial for treason in federal court. Of these, only Philip Wigle and John Mitchell were convicted. Wigle had beaten up a tax collector and burned his house; Mitchell was a simpleton who had been convinced by David Bradford to rob the U.S. mail. Both men were sentenced to death by hanging, but they were pardoned by President Washington. Pennsylvania state courts were more successful in prosecuting lawbreakers, securing numerous convictions for assault and rioting. While violent opposition to the whiskey tax ended, political opposition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> continued. Opponents of internal taxes rallied around the candidacy of Thomas Jefferson and helped him defeat President John Adams in the election of 1800. By 1802, Congress repealed the distilled spirits excise tax and all other internal Federal taxes. Until the War of 1812, the Federal government would rely solely on import tariffs for revenue, which quickly grew with the Nation's expanding foreign trade.|$|E
5|$|The Norwegian Competition Authority {{announced}} {{that since the}} new company would have all domestic scheduled services between primary airports, {{it was unlikely that}} the take-over would receive permission from them. However, it was stated that one solution could be that the companies discontinue their frequent flyer programs. On 20 August, the Competition Authority declared that SAS was not allowed to purchase Braathens; the ruling was appealed by SAS and Braathens. Analysts stated that Braathens could be bankrupt by the time the appeal was processed. The Competition Authority stated that their denial of the take-over was that the reduction of capacity would remove the airline's incentive to provide discounted tickets, because they would not have to use them to capture travelers with lower willingness to pay from the competitor, and that they would not need low-paying customers to fill up the vacant seats. Instead, the authority wanted the politicians to reduce the taxes on flights. While Braathens also was opposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax,</b> they felt that removing it then was too late to save the company.|$|E

40|$|The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has {{undertaken}} research on accounting for income <b>taxes.</b> <b>The</b> IASB {{research suggests that}} a fundamental change from International Accounting Standard 12 : Income <b>Taxes</b> (IAS 12), <b>the</b> balance sheet method, to another method may be considered. Other methods for accounting for deferred <b>tax</b> include <b>the</b> <b>taxes</b> payable method, <b>the</b> comprehensive basis under the income statement method, and the partial basis under the income statement method. This thesis provides evidence on this issue by using non-United States data to examine these deferred tax methods. This thesis examines the research question “are deferred <b>tax</b> methods, relative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>taxes</b> payable method, information relevant?” Information that is ‘information relevant’ has two components: predictability and value relevance (Ohlson, 1995). The predictability of deferred tax methods is measured by its ability to predict future <b>tax</b> payments relative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>taxes</b> payable method. <b>The</b> value relevance of deferred tax methods is measured by its association with share price relative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>taxes</b> payable method. Literature examining deferred taxes predominately uses United States US data and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP), and only partially examines deferred tax methods. This thesis contributes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> literature by examining all three deferred tax line items: deferred tax liabilities, deferred tax assets and deferred <b>tax</b> expense. <b>The</b> data is collected from the financial information for firms listed on the NZ Stock Exchange. Two samples of firms are examined: from 2000 to 2004 (pre IFRS) and 2008 to 2012 (post IFRS). The {{results show that the}} comprehensive basis under the income statement method is a better predictor of future tax payments and is value relevant relative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>taxes</b> payable method. This indicates that it is information relevant. The partial basis under the income statement method is a better predictor of future <b>tax</b> payments relative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>taxes</b> payable method however it is only value relevant for firms in the highest three deciles of mean increases in <b>tax</b> paid over <b>the</b> period. The balance sheet method is not a better predictor of future <b>tax</b> payments relative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>taxes</b> payable method. <b>The</b> balance sheet method is, however, value relevant. The balance sheet method using disaggregated deferred tax is also value relevant relative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> balance sheet method...|$|R
