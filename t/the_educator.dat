40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to look into educators’ view on dance in preschools based on their interpretations of the {{curriculum}} for the preschool and their experiences of the field. The questions asked in this study were how does <b>the</b> <b>educators</b> interpret a specific goal of ambition in the curriculum for the preschool where dance is mentioned as one of many forms of expressions, how does <b>the</b> <b>educators</b> work with dance in the preschools and which are <b>the</b> <b>educators</b> opinions about dance in relation to learning and development. To collect material for this study qualitative interviews were performed with educators who work with dance in the preschool. The results were analysed with a socio-cultural perspective on learning and the theory of multiple intelligences. The results showed that <b>the</b> <b>educators</b> mean that dance is very useful in the preschool. Dance stimulate children’s need of movement and the joy of movement, but it’s also a way of expressing thoughts, feelings and experiences. According to <b>the</b> <b>educators</b> <b>the</b> focus in their work with dance in preschools is to use the body for exploration, create their own way of dancing and develop the sensation and perception of the movement rather than how it looks. The specific goal of ambition in the curriculum for the preschool where dance is being mentioned as one of many forms of expressions <b>the</b> <b>educators</b> interpret as that the preschool should give opportunities for children to explore many ways of expressions, where dance can be one of them. In the preschools dance occur as dance lessons as well as a part of gatherings or just spontaneously, indoors and outdoors. <b>The</b> <b>educators</b> declare that dance supports development in many ways.

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study is to find out how <b>educators</b> think about <b>the</b> design of play {{environment}} and its significance for the development and learning of the children. This study is based on qualitative interviews with five active <b>educators.</b> <b>The</b> results of the study show that <b>the</b> <b>educators</b> are looking out for the interest of the children to the largest extent possible when the play environments are designed. The theoretical outset of this study is based on a socio-cultural perspective. The result of the study also shows that <b>the</b> <b>educators</b> try to have as much materials available and visible for the children as possible. <b>The</b> <b>educators</b> pointed out that usage of recycled material is really important. Recycled materials leave plenty of opportunities for the children to use their imagination and creativity. For <b>the</b> <b>educators</b> to be able to provide motivational activity zones there has to be a wide variety of inspiring materials at preschools. This leads to development and learning for the children. Furthermore the result showed that <b>the</b> <b>educators</b> regarded large children’s groups as obstacles. The facilities of preschools are too small for these large groups. It affects sound levels, indoor temperatures and humidity inside the facilities. In addition the results showed that the ability to design good play environments is dependent on preschools having educated staff. Also evidence was found supporting the fact that there are staff shortages, which according to <b>the</b> <b>educators,</b> mean that it is difficult to create optimal play environments...|$|R

25|$|Implementing {{appropriate}} proxemic cues {{has been}} shown to improve success in monitored behavioral situations like psychotherapy by increasing patient trust for the therapist (see active listening).

Studies have shown that proxemic behavior is also affected when dealing with stigmatized minorities within a population.

Others may judge that the disabled person needs to have an increase of touch, volume, or proximity.|$|E

Only 3 % of the general faculty in comparison to 19 % of <b>the</b> <b>educators</b> and 24 % of the students thought that evolution and creationism are in harmony. Although 93 % of <b>the</b> general faculty, <b>educators,</b> and students knew that evolution relies on common ancestry, 26 % of the general faculty, 45 % of <b>the</b> <b>educators,</b> and 35 % of the students did not know that humans are apes. Remarkably, 15 % of the general faculty, 32 % of <b>the</b> <b>educators,</b> and 35 % of the students believed, incorrectly, that the origin of the human mind cannot be explained by evolution; and 30 % of the general faculty, 59 % of <b>the</b> <b>educators,</b> and 75 % of the students were Lamarckian (=believed in inheritance of acquired traits). For science education: 96 % of the general faculty, 86 % of <b>the</b> <b>educators,</b> and 71 % of the students supported the exclusive teaching of evolution, while 4 % of the general faculty, 14 % of <b>the</b> <b>educators,</b> and 29 % of the students favored equal time to evolution, creationism and ID; note that 92 % of the general faculty, 82 % of <b>the</b> <b>educators,</b> and 50 % of the students perceived ID as either not scientific and proposed to counter evolution based on false claims or as religious doctrine consistent with creationism. The general faculty was the most knowledgeable about science/evolution and the least religious (science index, SI[*]=[*] 2. 49; evolution index, EI[*]=[*] 2. 49; and religiosity index, RI[*]=[*] 0. 49); <b>the</b> <b>educators</b> reached lower science/evolution but higher religiosity indexes than the general faculty (SI[*]=[*] 1. 96, EI[*]=[*] 1. 96, and RI[*]=[*] 0. 83); and the students were the least knowledgeable about science/evolution and the most religious (SI[*]=[*] 1. 80, EI[*]=[*] 1. 60, and RI[*]=[*] 0. 89). Understanding of science and evolution were inversely correlated with level of religiosity, and understanding of evolution increased with increasing science literacy.
