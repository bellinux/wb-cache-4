50|$|Some older house styles specify {{that front}} matter (title page, abstract, <b>table</b> <b>of</b> <b>content,</b> etc.) uses a {{separate}} page number sequence {{from the main}} text, using Roman numerals. The relevant international standard and many newer style guides recognize that this book design practice can cause confusion where electronic document viewers number all pages of a document continuously from the first page, independent of any printed page numbers. They, therefore, avoid the traditional separate number sequence for front matter and require a single sequence of Arabic numerals starting with 1 for the first printed page (the recto of the title page).|$|E

40|$|A lot of {{e-learning}} {{courses are}} structured linearly like books. To give an orientation over the learning content a classical <b>table</b> <b>of</b> <b>content</b> is sufficient. But if in contrast {{the order of}} working through the learning units of an e-learning course is not absolutely defined, and the learner {{has a lot of}} different possibilities of working through the learning content, a classical textual <b>table</b> <b>of</b> <b>content</b> is not sufficient anymore. Therefore the idea came up to use a graphical <b>table</b> <b>of</b> <b>content</b> to visualise the learning content of such networked e-learning courses. Within the scope of a diploma thesis (Schröck, 2010) at the Fraunhofer IOSB in Karlsruhe a concept was developed, how e-learning courses with networked content can be visualised. For this the metaphor map is used since the e-learning contents and maps have a networked character in common. The thesis also transfers cartographic methods to the visualisation of non spatial information. In doing so, relatively new ground of cartography is broken...|$|E

The {{aim is to}} clarify why this choice should be discussed, when one technology should be selected instead of an other and how the selected technology should be used. Four levels (Data model, Specification, Project, Product) are analyzed to show {{the impact of this}} choice on different scopes. Follow a discussion on the best choice depending on the context.
