5|$|Curves {{that have}} self-crossings may reach {{singularities}} before contracting to a point. For instance, if a lemniscate (any smooth immersed curve {{with a single}} crossing, resembling a figure 8 or infinity symbol) has unequal areas in its two lobes, then eventually the smaller lobe will collapse to a point. However, if the two lobes have equal areas, then they will remain equal throughout <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> curve, and the isoperimetric ratio will diverge as the curve collapses to a singularity.|$|E

5|$|General {{relativity}} is {{the geometric}} theory of gravitation published by Albert Einstein in 1915 {{and the current}} description of gravitation in modern physics. It {{is the basis of}} current cosmological models of the Universe. General relativity generalizes special relativity and Newton's law of universal gravitation, providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time, or spacetime. In particular, the curvature of spacetime {{is directly related to the}} energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present. The relation is specified by the Einstein field equations, a system of partial differential equations. In general relativity, the distribution of matter and energy determines the geometry of spacetime, which in turn describes the acceleration of matter. Therefore, solutions of the Einstein field equations describe <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Universe. Combined with measurements of the amount, type, and distribution of matter in the Universe, the equations of general relativity describe <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Universe over time.|$|E
