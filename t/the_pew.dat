50|$|In some churches, pews were {{installed}} {{at the expense of}} the congregants, and were their personal property; there was no general public seating in the church itself. In these churches, pew deeds recorded title to <b>the</b> <b>pews,</b> and were used to convey them. Pews were originally purchased from the church by their owners under this system, and the purchase price of <b>the</b> <b>pews</b> went to <b>the</b> costs of building the church. When <b>the</b> <b>pews</b> were privately owned, their owners sometimes enclosed them in lockable <b>pew</b> boxes, and <b>the</b> ownership of <b>pews</b> was sometimes controversial, as in the case of B. T. Roberts: a notice that <b>the</b> <b>pews</b> were to be free in perpetuity was sometimes erected as a condition of building grants.|$|R
500|$|Several of <b>the</b> church's <b>pews</b> {{date from}} 1857 {{and remain in}} use. <b>The</b> <b>pews,</b> quite simple in form, have a [...] "minimalist appearance". Each pew {{consists}} of a long wooden plank {{that serves as the}} seat, with a thin rail supported by three spindles as <b>the</b> backrest. <b>The</b> <b>pews</b> are supported by three arched supports joined to the seat by a mortise and tenon joint and reinforced with nails. <b>The</b> newer <b>pews</b> exhibit identical design elements but are constructed with modern nails and timber. Though most of <b>the</b> <b>pews</b> are arranged against the church's west elevation with a center aisle, two are along the north elevation and four are along the south elevation. The pulpit is situated at the east elevation. There is an upright piano in the northeastern corner of the church.|$|R

5|$|St James' {{suffered}} from a major scandal in the late 1820s ("a period of personal quarrels and violent newspaper controversies") when Commissioner Bigge's secretary and brother-in-law, Thomas Hobbes Scott, who had been made Archdeacon of New South Wales in 1825, came into conflict with a parishioner, Edward Smith Hall. Archdeacon Scott ordered that Hall should vacate <b>the</b> <b>pew</b> he rented at St James' {{for himself and his}} six daughters. As Hall continued to occupy <b>the</b> <b>pew,</b> constables attended Sunday services to prevent his occupation of <b>the</b> <b>pew</b> by boarding it up and making it secure with iron bands. Hall, critical of both the archdeacon and Governor Ralph Darling, was also a partner with Arthur Hill in the ownership of newspaper The Monitor. He published an attack on the archdeacon, for which he was sued for libel. The courts fined him only £1 and placed him on a bond. Hall appealed to Reginald Heber, Bishop of Calcutta (who was the relevant ecclesiastical authority at the time) and to the law where he was awarded £25 damages. The archdeacon, who was extremely unpopular, returned to London in 1828.|$|E

5|$|In {{a survey}} {{released}} by <b>the</b> <b>Pew</b> Research Center in April 2007, viewers who watch both The Colbert Report and The Daily Show {{tend to be}} more knowledgeable about news than audiences of other news sources. Approximately 54% of The Colbert Report and The Daily Show viewers scored in the high knowledge range, followed by Jim Lehrer's program at 53% and Bill O'Reilly's program at 51%, significantly higher than the 34% of network morning show viewers. The survey shows that changing news formats have not made much difference on how much the public knows about national and international affairs, but adds that there is no clear connection between news formats and what audiences know. The Project for Excellence in Journalism released a content analysis report suggesting that The Daily Show comes close to providing the complete daily news.|$|E
