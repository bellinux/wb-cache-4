5|$|Before the 2009 season, Fredrikstad told Tegström {{that he was}} {{not part}} of the club's {{long-term}} plans and that he was welcome <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>another</b> club. Fredrikstad turned down an offer from Stabæk to buy the striker. He did not start a single match in the pre-season, but he came on as a substitute and scored a goal against Strømsgodset in the second match of the 2009 season. Tegström spent most of the 2009 season on the bench, but in the 2009 Norwegian Football Cup tie against Ranheim, he came on as a substitute and scored two goals in the extra time.|$|E

5|$|Males {{initiate}} copulation by mounting {{the female}} and tilting her hear back 90 degrees. The male then secures his position by biting and pulling {{back on the}} hairs {{at the base of}} the female’s skull. The male then uses his thumbs to further stabilize his position and enters the female under her interfemoral membrane. Both individuals have been noted to be very quiet during the copulation process. Once the process is over the male dismounts the female and flies away <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>another</b> mate.|$|E

They awoke {{on the morning of}} 27 November <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>another</b> glacier (later known as the Ninnis Glacier) far larger than the first. As with the first glacier, they had to unhitch the dogs from the sledges and slowly make the treacherous descent. Once {{at the bottom of the}} glacier they spent four days {{crossing}} fields of crevasses, battling strong winds and poor light that made navigation difficult.|$|E

5|$|The basic {{ingredients}} for lifewhat we call 'pre-biotic chemistry'are abundant in many solar system objects, such as comets, asteroids and icy moons. Biologists believe liquid {{water and energy}} are then needed to actually support life, so it's exciting <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>another</b> place where we might have liquid water. But, energy is another matter, and currently, Callisto's ocean is only being heated by radioactive elements, whereas Europa has tidal energy as well, from its greater proximity to Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|The frontrunner for {{the post}} was the wartime {{commander}} of the Manhattan District, Brigadier General Kenneth Nichols. Indeed, Nichols was the War Department's only nominee. However, the AEC commissioners had different ideas. Nichols was seen as too closely identified with the wartime Manhattan Project; he had opinions at variance with the commissioners on whether the Director of Military Applications was a staff or a line position; {{and he had a}} strong disagreement with the commissioners over the vexing issue of which agency should hold custody of the nuclear weapons stockpile. Accordingly, the AEC commissioners decided <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>another</b> candidate.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the series, {{there have}} been three filming {{locations}} for Sun Hill police station. From the first series, the police station consisted of a set of buildings in Artichoke Hill, Wapping, East London. However, these buildings were next to the News International plant and during the winter of 1985–86 there was much industrial action which resulted in some altercations between the strikers and what they thought were the real police but were actually actors working on The Bill. Working conditions got so dire, that the production team realised they needed <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>another</b> base to set Sun Hill police station.|$|E

At his new school, Chris is shunned by the wealthy students at the academy, being both verbally and physically assaulted, including being hit with socks full of paper money.

5|$|Cominco's president, Selwyn G. Blaylock, was cautious. There {{might be}} no post-war demand for heavy water, and the patent {{on the process}} was held by Albert Edgar Knowles, so a {{profit-sharing}} agreement would be required. In response, Taylor offered $20,000 for plant modifications. There the matter rested until 6 December, when Blaylock {{had a meeting with}} the British physicist G. I. Higson, who informed him that Taylor had become discouraged with Cominco, and had decided <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>another</b> source of heavy water. Blaylock invited Taylor to visit Trail, which he did from 5 to 8 January 1942. The two soon found common ground. Blaylock agreed to produce heavy water at Trail, and quickly secured approval from the Chairman of the Board, Sir Edward Beatty. A contract was signed on 1 August 1942. The heavy water project became known as the P-9 Project in October 1942.|$|E
5|$|Common {{blackbirds}} {{spend much}} of their time looking for food on the ground where they can become infested with ticks, which are external parasites that most commonly attach to the head of a blackbird. In France, 74% of rural blackbirds were found to be infested with Ixodes ticks, whereas, only 2% of blackbirds living in urban habitats were infested. This is partly because it is more difficult for ticks <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>another</b> host on lawns and gardens in urban areas than in uncultivated rural areas, and partly because ticks are likely to be commoner in rural areas, where a variety of tick hosts, such as foxes, deer and boar, are more numerous. Although ixodid ticks can transmit pathogenic viruses and bacteria, and are known to transmit Borrelia bacteria to birds, {{there is no evidence that}} this affects the fitness of blackbirds except when they are exhausted and run down after migration.|$|E

The two doubt his credentials, and Qureshi phones the police station and calls for help. The two men then get into a fight, and during the struggle the woman gets a hold of Qureshi's gun, and asks them to sit quietly. It is then revealed that the man claiming to be Inspector Qureshi {{is in fact a}} thief. The woman telephones her mother and asks her to contact the police.|$|R

Sean shows up on a break from work and proposes to Ashley; she accepts and they {{go out for a}} drive. David shows up next to give Mary Margret her Valentine, but mistakenly gives her Kathryn's. Mary Margaret says she thought if two people were meant to be together they would find a way, but maybe she and David need another way. She tells him he should probably go home.|$|E
5|$|Foster {{returned}} to Lincoln in December, {{and a month}} later {{was told by the}} club that he was free <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>another</b> club after being deemed surplus to requirements at Sincil Bank. Shortly after, in January 2007, he mutually agreed to cancel his contract with Lincoln, enabling him to join Conference North side Stalybridge Celtic. He made his debut for Stalybridge in the FA Trophy, starting in a 1–1 draw against Kettering Town, scoring an own goal just before half-time. He scored his first goal for the club against one of his former employers, Alfreton, netting the winner in a 2–1 victory. He made six appearances for the club in all competitions, scoring once.|$|E
5|$|Ganino and Stillwell {{completed}} their new combined story {{in about a}} week. The writers spent hours each day at Stillwell's apartment working over every detail; they felt pressured {{to write a story}} Piller would find acceptable, as they wanted {{to have the opportunity to}} write the teleplay. The story treatment was turned in on October 10. Piller immediately decided to purchase the story and distributed the treatment to the writing staff while he discussed changes. Piller felt that Data's romantic feelings for TashaYar were over the top, and that an alien probe which served as a central part of the story was a cheat in terms of resolving Picard's dilemma. The writer wanted Ganino and Stillwell to enhance Guinan's role and <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>another</b> character arc for TashaYar. A revised treatment was submitted on October 29, incorporating Piller's changes. The writers were not involved in development of the teleplay. They were each paid the Writers Guild minimum of $2400.|$|E

Jesse doubts this, believing {{it will be too}} much trouble for Gus <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>another</b> drug manufacturer, and that both they and Gus understand the situation: neither can kill the other, so Gus might as well make them wish they were dead.

At the May 1971 Cannes Film Festival, THX was chosen for the Directors' Fortnight competition. There, Lucas met David Picker, then president of United Artists, who was intrigued by American Graffiti and Lucas's space opera. Picker decided to give Lucas $10,000 to develop Graffiti as a screenplay.|$|E
