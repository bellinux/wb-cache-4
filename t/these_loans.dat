5|$|In the mid-1820s, when Manuel José García was Minister of Finance, the {{government}} borrowed heavily to finance new projects {{and to pay}} off war debts. <b>These</b> <b>loans</b> were tendered at usurious rates: in one notorious loan, {{the government}} received credit for £570,000 from the Baring Brothers {{in exchange for a}} debt of £1,000,000. In the 1820s, the peso papel began to lose value rapidly with respect to the peso fuerte, which was linked to the price of gold. In 1827 the peso papel was devalued by 33%, and was devalued again by 68% in 1829.|$|E
25|$|Below is a table {{displaying}} {{a number of}} <b>these</b> <b>loans.</b> Currently some of the etymologies are being referenced to an Urdu dictionary, so {{it should be noted}} that Gujarati's singular masculine o corresponds to Urdu ā, neuter ũ groups into ā as Urdu has no neuter gender, and Urdu's Persian z is not upheld in Gujarati and corresponds to j or jh. In contrast to modern Persian, the pronunciation of <b>these</b> <b>loans</b> into Gujarati and other Indo-Aryan languages, as well as that of Indian-recited Persian, seems to be in line with Persian spoken in Afghanistan and Central Asia, perhaps 500years ago.|$|E

25|$|Some have blamed lenders for inappropriately {{approving}} {{loans for}} subprime applicants, despite signs {{that people with}} poor scores were {{at high risk for}} not repaying the loan.

40|$|The {{presence}} of loan {{words in a}} language shows the long-standing interactions between that particular language as a recepient and its donors.

Very often the speakers no longer realize that these words originally came from another language.

When the cooperative is created, it takes the major part of the loan needed to buy the property. <b>These</b> <b>loans</b> will then be paid off during a fixed periods of years (typically 20-30), and once this is done, the cooperative is dispersed and the flats are transformed into condominiums.|$|E
25|$|To prevent usury (unreasonable and {{excessive}} rates of interest), some jurisdictions limit the annual percentage rate (APR) that any lender, including payday lenders, can charge. Some jurisdictions outlaw payday lending entirely, {{and some have}} very few restrictions on payday lenders. In the United States, the rates of <b>these</b> <b>loans</b> used to be restricted in most states by the Uniform Small Loan Laws (USLL), with 36–40% APR generally the norm.|$|E
25|$|By making <b>these</b> <b>loans,</b> the Fed {{serves as}} a buffer against {{unexpected}} day-to-day fluctuations in reserve demand and supply. This contributes to the effective functioning of the banking system, alleviates pressure in the reserves market and reduces the extent of unexpected movements in the interest rates.

25|$|During the Crash of 1929 {{preceding}} the Great Depression, margin requirements were only 10%. Brokerage firms, in other words, would lend $9 for every $1 an investor had deposited. When the market fell, brokers called in <b>these</b> <b>loans,</b> {{which could not}} be paid back. Banks began to fail as debtors defaulted on debt and depositors attempted to withdraw their deposits en masse, triggering multiple bank runs. Government guarantees and Federal Reserve banking regulations to prevent such panics were ineffective or not used. Bank failures led to the loss {{of billions of dollars in}} assets.|$|E

Under that compromise, the money was invested and the profits sent as reparations to Britain and France, which used the funds to repay their own war loans from the U.S. In the 1920s Dulles was involved in setting up a billion dollars' worth of <b>these</b> <b>loans.</b>|$|E

Among the new mortgage loan types created and gaining in {{popularity in the}} early 1980s were adjustable-rate, option adjustable-rate, balloon-payment and interest-only mortgages. <b>These</b> new <b>loan</b> types are credited with replacing the long-standing practice of banks making conventional fixed-rate, amortizing mortgages. Among the criticisms of banking industry deregulation {{that contributed to the}} savings and loan crisis was that Congress failed to enact regulations that would have prevented exploitations by <b>these</b> <b>loan</b> types.

25|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, Mongolia was impoverished. Repercussions from the Taiping Rebellion (1850–1864) were {{primarily}} responsible for this economic deterioration. Loss of tax revenue from South China during the rebellion and expenses for its suppression had depleted the Qing treasury. Silver, rather than livestock as was the custom, became the primary medium for paying taxes. The major source of silver for Mongolians was from loans borrowed from Chinese merchants. <b>These</b> <b>loans,</b> transacted at crippling interest rates, were repaid in livestock, which was then exported to China. The result was a catastrophic decline {{in the size of}} the herds upon which the livelihood of Mongolians depended.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 1776, the Congress {{sought to}} raise money by loans from wealthy individuals, {{promising}} to redeem the bonds after the war. The bonds were in fact redeemed in 1791 at face value, but the scheme raised little money because Americans had little specie, {{and many of the}} rich merchants were supporters of the Crown. Starting in 1776, the French secretly supplied the Americans with money, gunpowder and munitions in order to weaken its arch enemy, Great Britain. When France officially entered the war in 1778, the subsidies continued, and the French government, as well as bankers in Paris and Amsterdam loaned large sums to the American war effort. <b>These</b> <b>loans</b> were repaid in full in the 1790s.|$|E

Much of Ebbers' personal holdings were purchased with loans that had been backed by his WorldCom stock holdings. As the stock price declined he received a number of margin calls to provide additional collateral for <b>these</b> <b>loans.</b> In an effort to prevent Ebbers from having to sell his shares, the WorldCom board of directors authorized a series of loans and loan guarantees between September 2000 and April 2002.|$|E

25|$|Market {{interest}} rates apply to village bank loans, usually matching what local commercial banks charge their customers but usually {{only a tiny}} fraction of the usurious rates charged by local moneylenders.

25|$|Russia's {{war effort}} was funded {{primarily}} by France, {{in a series}} of loans totalling 800 million francs (30.4 million pounds); another loan in the amount of 600 million francs was agreed upon, but later cancelled. <b>These</b> <b>loans</b> were extended within a climate of mass bribing of the French press (made necessary by Russia's precarious economic and social situation and poor military performance). Although initially reluctant to participate in the war, the French government and major banks were co-operative since it became clear that Russian and French economic interests were tied. In addition to French money, Russia secured a loan in the amount of 500 million marks (24.5 million pounds) from Germany, who also financed Japan's war effort.|$|E
