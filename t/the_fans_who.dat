Green recounted that he had an alcohol problem at the time and had since made an effort to deal with that. He also said that Ron Artest had apologized to him several months earlier, and wished to work together in some type of community service in Detroit.|$|E
5|$|Tickets for {{the match}} had been selling for £500 {{in the lead}} up to the game. UEFA and the Spanish police had warned Celtic fans to avoid buying the 700 {{estimated}} fake tickets that were circulating before the game.

5|$|Despite this auspicious {{start to}} his career, Shearer was only eased {{into the first}} team {{gradually}} and made just ten goalless appearances for the club the following season. Throughout his career Shearer was recognised for his strength, which, during his time at Southampton, enabled him to retain the ball and provide opportunities for teammates. Playing as a lone striker between wide men, Rod Wallace and Matt Le Tissier, Shearer scored three goals in 26 appearances in the 1989–90 season, and in the next, four goals in 36 games. His performances in {{the centre of the}} Saints attack were soon recognised by <b>the</b> <b>fans,</b> <b>who</b> voted him their Player of the Year for 1991.|$|E
50|$|Even more {{remarkable}} than the game's length, perhaps, {{is the fact}} that <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> <b>who</b> caught Chris Burke's walk-off homer in the eighteenth was <b>the</b> same <b>fan</b> <b>who</b> had caught Lance Berkman's grand slam in the eighth (Section 102, Row 2, Seat 15); <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> later donated both balls to the Baseball Hall of Fame.|$|R

The events included a screening of the film at the Renaissance Theatre, where it originally premiered, tours of some of the filming locations, and a cocktail at the Ohio State Reformatory which served as Shawshank State Penitentiary for the film. The cocktail party was attended by Gunton, Scott Mann and James Kisicki, who signed autographs and shared stories with the fans.

5|$|Liverpool {{is one of}} {{the best}} {{supported}} clubs in Europe. The club states that its worldwide fan base includes more than 200officially recognised Club of the LFC Official Supporters Clubs in at least 50 countries. Notable groups include Spirit of Shankly and Reclaim The Kop. The club takes advantage of this support through its worldwide summer tours. Liverpool fans often refer to themselves as Kopites, a reference to <b>the</b> <b>fans</b> <b>who</b> once stood, and now sit, on the Kop at Anfield. In 2008 a group of fans decided to form a splinter club, A.F.C. Liverpool, to play matches for fans who had been priced out of watching Premier League football.|$|E
5|$|McDonald {{also felt}} the {{pressure}} of having to replace two popular ex-Flames in MacMillan and Lever while also working to overcome a separated shoulder he suffered {{earlier in the year}} with the Rockies. He made his debut with the Flames the following night, a 7–1 victory over the Los Angeles Kings, after which McDonald remarked that it was the most fun he had playing the game in a long time. He was given a loud ovation by <b>the</b> <b>fans</b> <b>who</b> immediately embraced him as a local hero, even though it took him seven games before he scored his first goal {{as a member of the}} Flames. He scored 34goals in Calgary, and combined with the 6 scored in Colorado, finished with his fifth 40-goal campaign in six years.|$|E

5|$|Blythe, who is nearsighted, {{took off}} his glasses before {{entering}} the stage, which together with the smoke and light effects allegedly left him half-blind. Blythe said that people could easily reach the band members or climb up to the stage. One of <b>the</b> <b>fans,</b> <b>who</b> was identified as Milan Pořádek by Czech newspapers, and who was scheduled to testify later during the proceedings, managed to climb the stage twice without being stopped by security. Blythe testified that during the first attempt, Pořádek rushed the stage and started waving his arms before stage diving. The second time, he tried to {{put his arms around}} Blythe in an attempt to hug him. Blythe, who according to his own words perceived this as a danger, caught Pořádek's collar, pushed him on the ground, knelt on him and repeatedly told him to stop. He then led the fan by his hair {{to the edge of the}} stage, where the fan jumped off. It was only after watching a video of the incident that Blythe found out that a security officer was actually pushing the fan from back. Blythe further said that he saw Pořádek trying to reach the stage yet again before finally being stopped by security.|$|E
5|$|The {{season is}} the worst in Benfica history {{since the start of}} the Primeira Liga during 1934–35. The club {{switched}} managers two times. Jupp Heynckes was replaced by José Mourinho in September. Toni, who previously guided the club to a league title, took the reins in December. In the transfer market, young players like Marchena and Fernando Meira were brought in, and mixed with the experience of 31 year-old, Pierre van Hooijdonk, who arrived to replace Nuno Gomes, were meant to improve the team competitiveness. However, the biggest event of the pre-season was the release of João Pinto, the longest-serving player on the club, and the incumbent captain. This decision was poorly received by <b>the</b> <b>fans,</b> <b>who</b> criticized Heynckes and the president for the move. Both would leave the club in the following months. In the league campaign, the team lacked balance year-round and only briefly entered the league race, spending all but three weeks out the top three. Even the successful partnership of Pierre van Hooijdonk and João Tomás, with 36 goals between them, did not prevent the club from finishing in sixth place, 23 points behind winner Boavista. Consequently, Benfica missed out on UEFA competitions for the first time in 51 years (since the 1959–60 season).|$|E

60|$|The round was {{one which}} might fill with delight {{the soul of}} <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> <b>who</b> knows <b>the</b> finer points of the game. And when it was over, while little damage had been done on either side, it left no {{shadow of a doubt}} in the minds of those who knew that the unknown fighter was the more skilful boxer.|$|R
50|$|Today, {{several dozen}} baseballs {{are used in}} a typical {{professional}} game, due to scratches, discoloration, and undesirable texture that can occur during the game. Balls hit {{out of the park}} for momentous occasions (record setting, or for personal reasons) are often requested to be returned by <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> <b>who</b> catches it, or donated freely by <b>the</b> <b>fan.</b> Usually, <b>the</b> player will give <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> an autographed bat and/or other autographed items in exchange for the special ball.|$|R

25|$|By {{the time}} Toolson filed his suit, {{baseball}} had grown greatly in popularity {{and as such}} had changed. Improved roads and public transportation meant that fans in some areas crossed state lines to attend games, and radio and television broadcasts, from which the teams derived substantial revenue, brought those games to <b>the</b> <b>fans</b> <b>who</b> did not leave home. The interstate aspects of the professional game had greatly increased.|$|E

50|$|During a {{game against}} the Red Sox on June 26, 2016, Sandy León hit a foul ball which landed in the first row in the stands, just out of Beltré's reach.

25|$|However, these aims {{have been}} {{somewhat}} scuppered by the trust's failure to properly control the club and failure to deal with spiralling debt; as the trust now has no ownership of the club, or any say in how it is run, the Co - operative now simply aims to rebuild its own reputation with <b>the</b> <b>fans,</b> <b>who</b> have become somewhat alienated by the Trust's actions in recent years.|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} washed out. Heavy rain poured {{in the day}} before, and the ground could not be dried {{sufficient}} enough for the game to start. Finally the game was called off by the Umpires' decisions without a ball being bowled due to a soggy outfield, an outcome that angered <b>the</b> <b>fans</b> <b>who</b> {{had been waiting for}} the game to start for five hours and they eventually started showing their frustration by hurling stones and setting fire to objects in the stands.|$|E

He died on 28 September 2012, following {{a long period of}} illness. Among those to pay tribute were U.S. country singer Robert Mizzell who said: “I am so saddened to hear of the passing of country legend Larry. I admired his talent and quick humour.

Spurred by the fan's recognition of him and with nothing left, Randy decides to return to wrestling and reschedules the rematch with The Ayatollah. He reconciles with Cassidy, though she begs him not to wrestle because of his heart condition.

25|$|The women's final was {{scheduled}} to be played on the Saturday, with two of the biggest stars on the WTA Tour in Maria Sharapova and Serena Williams set to face each other. <b>The</b> <b>fans</b> <b>who</b> expected a tough battle were eventually disappointed though, as Williams dominated the top-seeded Russian from start to finish. Her game was completely on form throughout the match, with Sharapova only managing to hold service once in the first set as Williams hit winner after winner. The second set was no different, although Sharapova managed to hold twice in the last set but Williams was too good and prevailed 6–1, 6–2 to win her eighth Grand Slam title and her third Australian Open title. At the trophy presentation, Williams dedicated her win to Yetunde Price, her elder half-sister who was shot in September 2003. Williams became the third-lowest-ranked major titlist since 1975, after Evonne Goolagong and Chris O'Neil who won here in 1977 and 1978 respectively.|$|E
25|$|The 1979–80 Hoosiers, led by Mike Woodson and Isiah Thomas, won the Big Ten {{championship}} and {{advanced to the}} 1980 Sweet Sixteen. The following season, in 1980–81, Thomas and the Hoosiers once again won a conference title and won the 1981 NCAA tournament, Knight's second national title. In 1982–1983, with the strong play of Uwe Blab and All-Americans Ted Kitchel and Randy Wittman, the No. 1 ranked Hoosiers were favorites to win another national championship. However, with an injury to All-American Ted Kitchel mid-season, the Hoosiers' prospects were grim. Knight asked for fan support to rally around the team and, when the team ultimately won the Big Ten title, he ordered that a banner be hung for the team in Assembly Hall {{as a tribute to}} <b>the</b> <b>fans,</b> <b>who</b> he credited with inspiring the team to win its final three home games. Nevertheless, in the tournament Kitchel's absence was felt and the team lost to Kentucky in the 1983 Sweet Sixteen.|$|E
