40|$|Main {{objectives}} of the present work are characterisation of the chip formation mechanisms and <b>tribological</b> <b>process</b> behaviour in grinding at low speeds. The technological area of interest was marked off by cutting speeds of some few meters per second and depths of cut in the magnitude of a micron typical machining parameters {{in a number of}} abrasive gear finishing processes, e. g. gear honing. The chip formation mechanisms have been investigated by single grain scratching tests. It has been shown, that low cutting speeds in combination with small chip thickness enhance micro-ploughing and make the chip formation less efficient. Higher values for cutting speed and larger chip thickness result in increasing micro-cutting. For the most efficient chip formation, the values for cutting speed and chip thickness have to be chosen as high as possible. Investigations of the <b>tribological</b> <b>process</b> behaviour have been carried out in grinding experiments. They were aimed at quantifying the influence of friction and tool specification on the effective material removal. Experimental findings allow to differentiate the friction influence dependent on the chosen cutting speed and (equivalent) chip thickness by application of the Stribeck diagram. The most efficient material removal was achieved at a boundary lubrication condition, when the cutting speed and chip thickness were set at their highest values. This result confirms the single grain tests findings. Applying an abrasive wear map, process behaviour of different tool specifications at constant grinding conditions was found out to correlate with the effective single grain chip thickness. The higher it is, the higher are the process friction, effective material removal and tool wear. At low chip thickness values, due to dominating micro-ploughing, high compressive residual stresses in the workpiece subsurface are induced. A principle transferability of the experimental results to the technology of gear honing has been shown...|$|E

It is found that sliding speed, load supported by asperities, the number of asperity contact and surface topographic characteristics influence the energy of AE signal. With the help of this model it is possible to estimate the contact load supported by asperities from AE measurement, which is a critical parameter to evaluate lubrication conditions in engineering applications.

40|$|Wastage as {{a result}} of the {{combined}} effects of wear and corrosion occurs in many environments, ranging from offshore to the healthcare industries. In such cases, the degradation is dependent on a wide range of parameters relating to the materials in contact and the nature of the corrosive environments. Defining conditions in which the wastage is minimised is critically important for engineers charged with monitoring such processes. The nature of the tribological contact plays a critical role in determining the effect of corrosion on the wastage rate. In some cases, as in sliding wear, frictional heating may arise at high velocities and applied loads, leading to oxide film formation, even at room temperatures. In other cases, as in solid particle erosion, frictional heating may play a significant role only at very high fluxes of particle impact.

40|$|Preface : The {{problem of}} contact {{materials}} subject to relative movement {{is becoming increasingly}} important for lifetime of the equipment, pollution and cost in energy. One of the aims of tribology is to understand how friction occurs and wear in dynamical contacts. This can vary considerably depending on {{the choice of the}} pair of materials and the experimental device. Few milligrams of material lost in a mechanism is sufficient to make it unusable and cause replacement with significant costs. There is still no specific and general formalism {{to solve the problem of}} tribology, that is to say, friction, tearing, wear and lubrication of solid and liquid. Friction behavior or wear depends on complex conditions of stress, environment and physicochemical properties of surfaces, themselves dependent on tribological mechanisms. The intrinsic mechanical properties of materials are complementary and play a direct role in the <b>tribological</b> <b>process.</b> The work presented at the ACMAâ€™ 14 conferences are multidisciplinary, by interacting mechanics, physical chemistry and materials science on a different scale ranging, the goal is to explain, even if the reactions of the contact surfaces are very complex, the basics of tribology, the process of friction and wear, to apply the test methods on the materials in contact and get material coatings on other surfaces by different methods and processes mechanical, physical and chemical.

40|$|Nitrogen {{implantation}} in Interstitial-Free steel {{was evaluated}} for {{its impact on}} metal transfer and 1100 Al rider wear. It was determined that nitrogen implantation reduced metal transfer in a trend that increased with dose; the Archard wear coefficient reductions of two orders of magnitude were achieved using a dose of 2 e 17 [*]ions/cm 2, 100 [*]kV. Cold-rolling the steel and making volumetric wear measurements of the Al-rider determined that the hardness of the harder material had little impact on volumetric wear or friction. Nitrogen implantation had chemically affected the <b>tribological</b> <b>process</b> studied in two ways: directly reducing the rider wear and reducing the fraction of rider wear that ended up sticking to the ISF steel surface. The structure of the nitrogen in the ISF steel {{did not affect the}} tribological behavior because no differences in friction/wear measurements were detected after postimplantation heat treating to decompose the as-implanted Îµ-Fe 3 N to Î³-Fe 4 N. The fraction of rider-wear sticking to the steel depended primarily on the near-surface nitrogen content. Covariance analysis of the debris oxygen and nitrogen contents indicated that nitrogen implantation enhanced the tribo-oxidation process with reference to the unimplanted material. As a result, the reduction in metal transfer was likely related to the observed tribo-oxidation in addition to the introduction of nitride wear elements into the debris. The primary Al rider wear mechanism was stick-slip, and implantation reduced the friction and friction noise associated with that wear mechanism. Calculations based on the Tabor junction growth formula indicate that the mitigation of the stick-slip mechanism resulted from a reduced adhesive strength at the interface during the sticking phase...|$|E
