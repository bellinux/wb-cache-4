40|$|Ensuring the {{development}} and availability of drugs <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>medically</b> <b>important</b> but commercially unprofitable poses a significant problem in our free market economy. Recent attempts {{by the federal government}} to develop a policy regarding these "orphan " drugs provides an important first step. The federal Interagency Task Force on Drugs of Limited Commercial Value recommendations propose initiation of a wide spectrum of administrative and legislative changes; these are designed to create incentives for industry to cooperate with government in developing and making orphan drugs available to those who need them. But before the proposed recommendations are accepted or rejected, a clearer understanding is needed of the nature of interrelated problems of orphan drugs. Thereafter, the wide spectrum of "stakeholders " involved in and affected by orphan drug policies or programs should seek means for interactive planning to determine desired ends and to devise means for achieving them...|$|R
50|$|In 2003, the Food and Drug Administration {{released}} Guidance #152, {{which makes}} recommendations {{on how to}} best develop new animal drugs {{with regard to the}} potential impacts on human health. In the summer of 2010, the FDA released Guidance #209, which suggests limited livestock use of antibiotics <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>medically</b> <b>important</b> to humans. In 2009, Rep. Louise Slaughter introduced HR 1549, otherwise known as The Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act (PAMTA). Under this bill, <b>medically</b> <b>important</b> antibiotics would <b>be</b> phased out in livestock and other restrictions would be placed on antibiotic use in food-producing animals. Some scientists argue that withdrawing antibiotic use will result in more diseased animals, which can result in an increased bacterial load on meat and an increased risk of food-borne illness. Opponents of such a ban argue that the economic implications would be devastating in terms of higher food prices. One study found that the price of pork would increase five cents a pound.|$|R

5000|$|In 2015, the FDA {{approved}} a new Veterinary Feed Directive (VFD), {{which is an}} updated rule that give instructions to pharmaceutical companies, veterinarians, and producers about how to administer necessary drugs through the animal's feed and water. This new rule followed through on the FDA's commitment to phase out the use of antibiotics for growth promotion and increased feed conversion. [...] It is now illegal to use any antimicrobial <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>medically</b> <b>important</b> to humans for anything other than treatment, control, and prevention of disease. Furthermore, even then, producers now {{have to have a}} licensed veterinarian sign a legal form - much like a prescription - for producers to purchase, store, or administer these products. This document gives specific instructions about the animals to be fed, the dates when they will be fed, and the concentration. Violating a VFD is now a violation of federal law. This is a major step toward reducing antibiotic resistance in both animals and humans. The new VFD took effect on January 1, 2017.|$|R

40|$|The direct {{estimate}} of 46, 000 snakebite deaths in India in 2005 (1 for every 2 HIV/AIDS deaths), based on verbal autopsies, renders unrealistic {{the total of}} only 47, 000 snakebite deaths {{in the whole world}} in 2010, obtained indirectly as part of the "Global Burden of Disease 2010 " study. Persistent underestimation of its true morbidity and mortality has made snakebite the most neglected of all the WHOâ€²s "neglected tropical diseases", downgrading its public health importance. Strategies to address this neglect should include the improvement of antivenom, the only specific antidote to envenoming. To accommodate increased understanding of geographical intraspecific variation in venom composition and the range of snake species <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>medically</b> <b>important</b> in India, the design of antivenoms (choice of venom sources and species coverage) should be reconsidered. Methods of preclinical and clinical testing should be improved. The relatively new science of venomics involves techniques and strategies for assessing the toxin composition of snake venoms directly through proteomics-centred approaches or indirectly via high-throughput venom gland transcriptomics and bioinformatic analysis. Antivenomics is translational venomics: a proteomics-based protocol to quantify the extent of cross-reactivity of antivenoms against homologous and heterologous venoms. These approaches could revolutionize the preclinical assessment of antivenom efficacy, leading to a new generation of antivenoms <b>that</b> <b>are</b> clinically more effective...|$|R

40|$|A {{qualitative}} analysis of supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) of the medically useful compound, sage (Salvia officinalis) {{is presented in}} this study. Carbon dioxide {{was used as a}} supercritical solvent. Effects of operating conditions such as temperature, pressure, and extraction time were investigated. The effect of addition of cosolvents was also studied. The extracted useful compounds were identified and analyzed using GC-MS chromatography. The analysis of the extract obtained by SFE showed certain significant major compounds <b>that</b> <b>are</b> considered <b>medically</b> <b>important.</b> These major compounds are 1 R-. alpha. -Pinene, D-Limonene, l-Camphene, and b-Pinene, and Eucalyptol. Although, there was no consistent trend with respect to the effect of the studied parameters on the composition of the extract, the selectivity of these major compounds are dependant on the operating conditions, manily the operating pressure. An increase in the pressure resulted in an increase in herb extraction yield; this is true for certain group of extracts, while the inverse is also true for other group of compounds. The effect of certain cosolvents on the extractability of sage showed a significant improvement of the yield of some particular constituents of sage...|$|R
