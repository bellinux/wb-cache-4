He {{was one of the}} non-playing members of the party who had {{witnessed}} no cheating, understood little about gambling and, as a non-soldier, knew nothing of Article 41 of the Queen's Regulations. When cross-examined by Clarke, Coventry confirmed <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> he was aware, the witnesses had all decided to watch Gordon-Cumming's play on the second night, despite their claims to the contrary.|$|E

25|$|The Sasanians {{established}} an empire within the frontiers {{achieved by the}} Achaemenids, with their capital at Ctesiphon.

25|$|After {{the impact}} of Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, however, Matisse was never again mistaken for an avant-garde incendiary. With the bizarre {{painting}} that appalled and electrified the cognoscenti, which understood the Les Demoiselles was at once a response to Matisse's Le bonheur de vivre (1905–1906) and an assault upon the tradition from which it derived, Picasso effectively appropriated the role of avant-garde wild beast—a role <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> public opinion was concerned, he was never to relinquish.|$|E

25|$|Born in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, Romney's {{first-class}} debut came against Leicestershire: he made 4 and 10 not out. In {{his next}} game against Oxford University he hit what {{proved to be}} his highest score, 20 not out (the second top score in the innings) as Worcestershire were dismissed for 121 (they went on to lose by three wickets). Poor displays against Gloucestershire and MCC followed, and that was <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> his first-class career was concerned.|$|E
25|$|During the Atlantic slave trade, many Christians began {{teaching}} that black Africans were descendants of Canaan {{and used the}} Curse of Ham to justify enslaving black Africans. This belief was especially strong in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who canonized the Book of Abraham, which teaches that Canaan was a descendant of Cain, that his descendants settled Africa, {{and that they were}} cursed. Joseph Smith and Brigham Young both used the Curse of Ham to justify slavery in Mormonism. This was also their rationale in denying Africans access to their priesthood until June 1978, at which point their prophet at the time, President Spencer W. Kimball, announced <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> priesthood was concerned, the curse was lifted.|$|E
25|$|Hart {{was furious}} over the {{official}} decision and argued with the officials {{claiming that he}} should be declared the winner and not Austin. On the following night's Raw, Hart came to the ring unannounced {{at the beginning of the}} show and began venting his frustrations toward Vince McMahon over how he believed that the finish to the Royal Rumble was just another in a long string of screwings and broken promises that had been dogging Hart since he returned to the company. He demanded that he receive the title shot that the winner of the Royal Rumble is entitled to, saying <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> he was concerned he won the match. McMahon simply ignored him and walked to his broadcast position, and an incensed Hart finally decided he had had enough and declared he was quitting the WWF.|$|E

25|$|How Xenocrates {{tried to}} {{establish}} and connect scientifically these assumptions, which appear to be taken chiefly from his books {{on the nature of}} the gods, we do not learn, and can only discover the one fundamental idea at the basis of them, that all grades of existence are penetrated by divine power, and that this grows less and less energetic in proportion as it descends to the perishable and individual. Hence he also appears to have maintained <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> consciousness extends, so far also extends an intuition of that all-ruling divine power, of which he represented even irrational animals as partaking. But neither the thick nor the thin, to the different combinations of which he appears to have tried to refer the various grades of material existence, were regarded by him as in themselves partaking of soul; doubtless because he referred them immediately to the divine activity, and was far from attempting to reconcile the duality of the principia, or to resolve them into an original unity. Hence too he was for proving the incorporeality of the soul by the fact that it is not nourished as the body is.|$|E
25|$|It {{is clear}} to Lizaveta Prokofyevna and General Yepanchin that their {{daughter}} {{is in love with}} the Prince, but Aglaya denies this and angrily dismisses talk of marriage. She continues to mock and reproach him, often in front of others, and lets slip <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> she is concerned, the problem of Nastassya Filippovna is yet to be resolved. Myshkin himself merely experiences an uncomplicated joy in her presence and is mortified when she appears to be angry with him. Lizaveta Prokofyevna feels it is time to introduce the Prince to their aristocratic circle and a dinner party is arranged for this purpose, to be attended by a number of eminent and influential persons. Aglaya, who does not share her parents' respect for these people and is afraid that Myshkin's eccentricity will not meet with their approval, tries to tell him how to behave, but ends by sarcastically telling him to be as eccentric as he likes, and to be sure to wave his arms about when he is pontificating on some high-minded subject and break her mother's priceless Chinese vase. Feeling her anxiety, Myshkin too becomes extremely anxious, but he tells her that it is nothing compared to the joy he feels in her company. He tries to approach the subject of Nastasya Filippovna again, but she silences him and hurriedly leaves.|$|E

The New York Post reported that according to sources the split was not about [...] "irresolvable personality conflicts" [...] but about the money; a friend of Cornell said, [...] "Chris was unhappy with the financial arrangement within the group—he wrote all the music, yet the other three bandmates took an equal share in the multimillion-dollar publishing rights." ...|$|E

Co-writer Teddy Riley, who was quoted to have said so {{in an interview with}} the Los Angeles Times in 1996, denied in a 2011 reply to a fan on Twitter that the song was about Rowe. Others have noted that when the single was originally released in 1992, Jackson dedicated the song to Diana Ross, including Jermaine Jackson, who in his book You Are Not Alone: [...] Michael: [...] Through a Brother's Eyes wrote, [...] "...that song was, as Michael told me, written with Diana Ross in mind; the one great love <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> he was concerned, escaped him." ...|$|E

As he departs Detroit on a bus, he angrily remarks to Homer that he {{would have been better off}} if he never met him and <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> he is concerned, he has no brother. While Marge tries to console Homer, Lisa agrees with Herb and laments on his life before he discovered he was a [...] "Simpson". Grampa soon arrives and asks about Herb.

At 15:00, Company D commander Captain Charles McAuliffe—with nine of his men—unexpectedly marched into the Binu base camp. McAuliffe reported to Carlson that soon after he had made contact with the Japanese forces, he {{and one of his}} squads had become cut {{off from the rest of}} his company. After extricating themselves with difficulty, McAuliffe and the men with him had decided to retreat back to the base camp. McAuliffe reported <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> he knew, the rest of his company had been annihilated. A short time later, however, the rest of D Company arrived at the base camp, led by Gunnery Sergeant George Schrier, after successfully disengaging from the firefight. Carlson summarily relieved McAuliffe for what he later described as [...] "total ineptitude for leadership in battle" [...] and placed Captain Joe Griffith in command of Company D.|$|E

It's a triangle that's developed, but to try and give a rational explanation to it is next to impossible." [...] Smith thought Daphne was ideal for Shane and that she {{had a great deal of}} love for him. On the other hand, Daphne also loved Des, who she trusted and had become good friends with. O'Brien stated <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> Shane was concerned, Daphne was the only woman he ever loved and thought that he was more suited to her than Des. Keane commented that despite being engaged five times and stood up once by Daphne, Des had always loved her. He added [...] "It was love at first sight for Des." ...|$|E

[...] He gave a positive review of the main show, praising the sound system, the performances of [...] "Gypsy" [...] and [...] "Do What U Want", and deduced that: [...] "Perhaps this kind of ambition is music's future, at least for a certain breed of artist.
