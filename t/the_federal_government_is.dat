5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, many East Germans cut the coat of arms out of their flags, as Hungarians had done in 1956 and as Romanians would soon do during {{the fall of}} Ceau»ôescu. The {{widespread}} act of removing the coat of arms from the East German flag implied the plain black-red-gold tricolour as symbol for a united and democratic Germany. Finally, on 3 October 1990, as the area of the German Democratic Republic was absorbed into the Federal Republic of Germany, the black-red-gold tricolour became the flag of a reunified Germany. In 1998, the Foundation for the Reappraisal of the SED Dictatorship was formed. The duty of this organisation, directly responsible to <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government,</b> <b>is</b> to examine the consequences of the former East German regime. As its logo, the foundation used an East German flag with the Communist coat of arms cut out.|$|E

5|$|Districts {{established}} under U.S. {{federal guidelines}} generally {{begin the process}} of designation through a nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. The National Register is the official recognition by the U.S. government of cultural resources worthy of preservation. While designation through the National Register does offer a district or property some protections, it is only in cases where the threatening action involves the federal government. If <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>is</b> not involved, then the listing on the National Register provides the site, property or district no protections. For example, if company A wants to tear down the hypothetical Smith House and company A is under contract with the state government of Illinois, then the federal designation would offer no protections. If, however, company A was under federal contract the Smith House would be protected. A federal designation is little more than recognition by the government that the resource is worthy of preservation.|$|E
