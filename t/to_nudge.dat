5|$|Metroid Prime Pinball {{uses the}} basic {{mechanics}} of pinball, complete {{with an assortment}} of typical pinball items including flippers, spinners, bumpers, and ramps. In addition, new mechanics are introduced, such as enemies that wander around the table, wall jumping, and the ability to fire weapons. The Nintendo DS's touchscreen can be used <b>to</b> <b>nudge</b> the pinball table and alter the ball's trajectory. The game consists of six pinball tables, each inspired by a different area of Metroid Prime. Each table is shown across both screens of the Nintendo DS. Only two tables are initially available for play: Pirate Frigate and Tallon Overworld. After playing either of the first two tables, the player unlocks two more tables: Phendrana Drifts and Phazon Mines. In either table, the player must battle a boss to complete it.|$|E

25|$|Confederate Privateering {{was not as}} minor as many {{retrospective}} analyses have claimed. It {{posed the}} first {{threat to national security}} because it had the potential to have instantly put more hostile ships at sea than the U.S. Navy could effectively suppress while also striving to enforce a blockade. Furthermore, it resulted in Lincoln's first proclamation of a blockade, the first internationally recognized act of belligerence on his part, which helped <b>to</b> <b>nudge</b> the war into international waters; and it produced the first Union strategy for the conduct of war. President Lincoln's Secretary of the Navy, Gideon Welles, ordered the Blockading Squadron to secure the primary privateering ports of the South, which was accomplished quickly by joint Army/Navy actions against Forts Hattaras and Clark at the inlet to the NC Sounds, Forts Beauregard and Walker at Port Royal Sound, and Ship Island near New Orleans—all by the end of 1861, while other military efforts, that is, purely Army efforts, stalled.|$|E

25|$|Rocket League {{gameplay}} {{is largely}} {{the same as}} that of its predecessor Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars. Players control a rocket-powered car and use it to hit a ball that is much larger than the cars towards the other team's goal area to score goals, in a way that resembles a soccer game, with elements reminiscent of a demolition derby. Players' cars have the ability to jump to hit the ball while in mid-air. The players can also pick up a speed boost by passing their cars over marked spaces on the field, enabling them to quickly cross the field, use the added momentum to hit the ball, or ram into another player's car to destroy it; in the latter case, the destroyed car respawns moments later. A player may also utilize boost when in the air to propel themselves forward in flight, allowing players to hit the ball in the air. Players can also perform quick dodges, causing their car to do a short jump and spin in a given direction, which can be used <b>to</b> <b>nudge</b> the ball or gain positioning advantage over the other team.|$|E
25|$|The Wilds of Africa Adventure Safari is a 20-minute, one-mile, narrated {{monorail}} ride, which travels {{around the}} watering hole (hippopotamus) rain forest (okapi), mountain (Nubian ibex), woodlands (Grévy's zebra), river (waterbuck, greate white pallicans, Goliath herons, blue cranes), arid desert (scimitar-horned oryx, addra gazelle), semi-arid desert (addax, gemsbok, ostrich) and bush (gerenuk, red-crowned cranes, greater kudu, Thomson's gazelle, marabou storks) exhibits. The monorail features aerial {{views of the}} Simmons Hippo Outpost, Chimpanzee Forest, Nile crocodile, and Penguin Cove exhibits, which are also accessible via the Nature Trail. The monorail originally opened in 1990 but {{after two decades of}} use and over a million passengers, the attraction began to show its age with aging infrastructure and several electrical outages that left passengers stranded on the tour. The final incident in August 2014 prompted zoo officials to shut down the attraction for evaluation. Following the evaluation the DZS decided a $3 million renovation was in order. On March 25, 2016, the Monorail Safari reopened as the Wilds of Africa Adventure Safari featuring a new sound system, an upgraded station, air-conditioning, upgraded mechanical and electrical components and new graphics on the individual cars.

500|$|Nintendo DS {{games that}} use the device's top and bottom screens as one {{continuous}} screen are harder to control because of {{a gap in the}} middle, sometimes called a visual [...] "dead zone"; objects in this area are not visible. The developers of Metroid Prime Pinball, a game which takes advantage of both screens, resolved this problem by placing a second set of pinball flippers {{at the bottom of the}} upper screen to give players a reference to work with. The tabletops in the game use pre-rendered artwork for graphical effects, including Samus's Morph Ball, which uses renderings of images at several different angles to provide a smooth animation. To simulate the appearance of a real pinball game from a player's point of view, the tabletop in Metroid Prime Pinball was tipped back. The game offers players the ability <b>to</b> <b>nudge</b> the table, a technique used in pinball games to influence the ball's movement. This is achieved by touching the Nintendo DS's bottom touchscreen with a finger and pushing it in the direction that the player wants <b>to</b> <b>nudge</b> the tabletop. The game's soundtrack was composed by Kenji Yamamoto and Masaru Tajima, with audio effects from the Metroid Prime series are borrowed by the game to provide a [...] "CD-like" [...] music experience. The voice of the Power Suit was provided by Lorelei King.|$|E

In seasonal simulations, intermittent SN is applied for only 7 % of the total time steps; however, this results in not only maintaining the large-scale features of monsoon circulation and precipitation corresponding to observations but also improving the intensification of mesoscale features by reducing the suppression. open 1...|$|R

500|$|DJ Hero has {{received}} positive reviews from the gaming press, who consider the title as a fresh restart {{of the music}} genre given {{the large number of}} titles based on guitar play. The turntable peripheral was considered to be well designed {{to meet the needs of}} the game. The unit's weight, size, and shape, and ability to cater to both left- and right-handed players was commended. Many reviewers noted a need to alter the action of the crossfader, either by having better physical feedback to the player to indicate the center of the knob's track, or by reducing the width of the track to better handle the rapid crossfade maneuvers. Reviewers also noted that there was a certain weight to the turntable portion of the controller which made scratching imprecise, particularly with the inner blue button where only minimal torque can be applied. The learning curve of the game across the various mixes was highly commended by reviewers for helping players to get used to the new controller. When progressing from [...] "Medium" [...] to [...] "Hard" [...] and [...] "Expert" [...] levels and encountering more complex mixes, reviewers thought the game felt transformed, bringing a difficult but more rewarding experience to the player as they begin emulating every part of a real DJ's motions. Johnny Minkley of Eurogamer considered that while the learning curve is steep, with the [...] "Easy" [...] difficulty being [...] "less thrilling and engaging" [...] compared to Guitar Hero, the game was [...] "structured fabulously <b>to</b> <b>nudge</b> you gradually closer to the summit" [...] with each successive career set and difficulty mode. Cam Shae of IGN Australia felt that the changes in [...] "Hard" [...] mode over [...] "Medium" [...] were somewhat excessive, introducing both more crossfade effects and button-pressing, and felt these could have been introduced separately in [...] "Hard" [...] and [...] "Expert" [...] modes. [...] Richard Li of 1UP.com noted that the inability to fail a song is both [...] "a bane and a boon"; newer players would not feel frustration at trying to get used to the controller and would be able to quickly unlock all the sets in the game's career mode, but without knowing where they failed, they would not have an idea of where they need to hone their skills to improve their performance at the game. The omission of a practice mode was noted by Daemon Hatfield of IGN, believing it would help in some of the more complex mixes by the DJ celebrities. Reviewers believed that the small faults in DJ Hero can be easily fixed for potential sequels.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} project investigates {{the use of}} nudging as a strategy for changing citizens’ behavior, primarily in relation <b>to</b> the environment. <b>Nudging</b> attempts <b>to</b> prevent the public's tendency in making unhealthy decisions, for both themselves and their surroundings, decisions that are an inevitable result of our psychological patterns.

Next <b>to</b> <b>nudging,</b> two other behavioral strategies are investigated, liberalism and paternalism. In this regard the project discusses whether we should give people free reigns over their lives, limit their autonomy, or gently direct them in a better direction. The method of argumentation analysis is used to investigate experts’ attitudes towards these three strategies and to trigger a speculation of whether they could prove useful in regards to climate change. The project found that although nudging is a perfectly sound method in assisting peoples’ everyday choices, it would not be effective on its own. The conclusion is thus, that all three strategies would have to be taken into effect, to be able to cover all aspects of the vast issues surrounding global warming, both socially, politically and personally...|$|R
