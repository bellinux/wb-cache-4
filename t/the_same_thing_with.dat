25|$|In 1971, Drs. Takezaki and Hanaoka {{first used}} {{carbamazepine}} to control mania in patients refractory to antipsychotics (lithium {{was not available}} in Japan at that time). Dr. Okuma, working independently, did <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> success. As they were also epileptologists, they had some familiarity with the antiaggression effects of this drug. Carbamazepine was studied for bipolar disorder throughout the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Staff {{training}} was uneven and neglected. Systematic training of formation leaders was not begun until after 1943. It created {{a lack of}} trained and experienced flight leaders in 1943–1945. This was far too late {{to help in the}} Defence of the Reich campaign. The trained and experienced leaders that did exist were replaced in 1940 by younger and less experienced leaders too quickly (owing to Göring's frustration with them during the Battle of Britain). Later, Göring did <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> Fighter Division, the Jafu Jagdfliegerführer and Jagddivision commanders. The high turnover in the division made gaining experience impossible. Making matters worse, there were no fighter command organisations {{at the start of the}} war and there were never enough good officers to staff those that were set up. The Luftwaffe had very few General Staff Officers.|$|E
25|$|As {{that year}} began, Another World was {{expanded}} to 60 minutes, {{with their first}} hour-long episode airing on January 6, 1975. Although this did not directly affect As the World Turns, as the two shows were not in competition for {{anything other than the}} overall ratings win, CBS' afternoon lineup suffered some ratings damage as the popular soap put a dent in the ratings of both of CBS' popular afternoon game shows, The Price Is Right and Match Game. NBC, pleased by the success that the expansion of Another World had brought to the network, elected to do <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> Days of Our Lives beginning on April 21, 1975; this put Days of Our Lives and As the World Turns in direct competition for ratings. Incidentally, the expansions were occurring seven years after the last two 15-minute serials, Search for Tomorrow and The Guiding Light, expanded to 30 minutes.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} secure his power, Díaz engaged in various forms of {{co-optation}} and coercion. He played his people like a board game – catering to the private desires of different interest groups and playing off one interest against another. In order to satisfy any competing forces, such as the Mestizos and wealthier indigenous people, he gave them political positions of power {{that they could not}} refuse. He did <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> the elite Creole society by not interfering with their wealth and haciendas. Covering both pro and anti-clerical elements, Díaz was both the head of the Freemasons in Mexico and an important advisor to the Catholic bishops. Díaz proved to be a different kind of liberal than those of the past. He neither assaulted the Church (like most liberals) nor protected the Church. As for the Native American population, who were historically repressed, they were almost completely depoliticized; neither put on a pedestal as the core of Mexican society nor suppressed, and were largely left to advance by their own means. In giving different groups with potential power a taste of what they wanted, Díaz created the illusion of democracy and quelled almost all competing forces.|$|E

500|$|The single [...] "The Wire" [...] was {{released}} on July 29 and the album followed on September 30. The album reached {{number one in the}} UK and has since sold 200,000 copies there. To promote the album, the group performed [...] "The Wire" [...] on the BBC's The Andrew Marr Show, with Este dedicating the song to the British Prime Minister David Cameron, also a guest on the show. The move was criticised as being ill-judged by Johnny Marr, who stated that “It’s really simple: they made themselves look like idiots. It’s ridiculous. No-one put a gun to their head. The Conservatives tried to do <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> The Smiths, to re-appropriate us in a false way, to be cool by association.” Haim did not respond.|$|E
500|$|A {{review in}} the Times Literary Supplement dated 4 September 1941 stated {{that there was a}} [...] "note of quiescence, even of bleak resignation" [...] in the poem and that it [...] "lost that spice of wit which was woven into the logic of the earlier poems". Later, Bernard Bergonzi claimed that [...] "The Dry Salvages is the least {{satisfactory}} of the sequence, though {{at the same time it}} contains some of its best lines. The opening lines are poor, in a weakly sub-Whitmanesque fashion. Yet the writing suddenly picks up at the words, 'The river is within us,' and from there to the end of the section we have a magnificently sustained sequence". F. B. Pinion believed that [...] "'The Dry Salvages' is a complicated, uneven, and rather prosy poem, in which Eliot continues to say <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>with</b> some progression, mainly in maritime imagery".|$|E

500|$|Before the 1966 season began, Koufax and Drysdale met {{separately}} with Dodger GM Buzzie Bavasi {{to negotiate}} their contracts {{for the upcoming}} year. After Koufax's meeting, he met Drysdale for dinner and complained that Bavasi was using Drysdale against him in the negotiations, asking, [...] "How come you want that much when Drysdale only wants this much?" [...] Drysdale responded that Bavasi did <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> him, using Koufax against him. Drysdale's first wife, Ginger Drysdale, suggested that they negotiate together {{to get what they}} wanted. They demanded $1 million ($ today), divided equally over the next three years, or $167,000 ($ today) each for each of the next three seasons. Both players were represented by an entertainment lawyer, J. William Hayes, which was unusual during an era when players were not represented by agents. At the time, Willie Mays was Major League Baseball's highest paid player at $125,000 ($ today) per year and multi-year contracts were very unusual.|$|E
500|$|Caryn Ganz from Rolling Stone {{said that}} Hard Candy {{is the work}} of [...] "a songwriting team of American chart royalty" [...] that helps Madonna [...] "revisit her roots as an urban-disco queen. [...] For Hard Candy, she lets top-shelf {{producers}} make her their plaything." [...] Ben Thompson from The Guardian commented on the music by saying that [...] "Hard Candy is a tough, nuggety confection offering plenty for listeners to get their teeth into. [...] Whenever [...] threatens to get boring, something always happens to recapture your interest." [...] Sarah Hajibegari from The Times felt that while [...] "Hard Candy is no disaster", the album's producers have [...] "already done <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> Nelly Furtado, Britney Spears and Gwen Stefani." [...] Andy Gill from The Independent said that the album portrayed Madonna as [...] "how a once diverse talent has ossified into simply satisfying the sweet tooth of functional dance-pop." [...] Thomas Hausner from PopMatters wrote that the album [...] "is overpopulated with recycled pop that is indistinguishable and artificial, something Madonna's soothing arpeggiating vocals cannot alleviate".|$|E
500|$|Six {{companies}} {{working on}} different scenes and elements created 500shots of visual {{effects in the}} film. These were at times altered weekly due to the reactions of test audiences in screenings. CIS Visual Effects Group assisted with the Scorcher VI faux trailer and twenty additional shots for the home media release. To expand on the comedy in the film, some of the explosions and crashes were embellished to look more destructive. The visual effects supervisor Michael Fink reflected on the exaggerated explosions: [...] "We worked really {{hard to make the}} CG crashing helicopter in the hot landing sequence look real. Ben was adamant about that, {{but at the same time}} he wanted the explosion to be huge. When you see it hit the ground, it was like it was filled with gasoline! It was <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> Ben's sergeant character, who almost intercepts a hand grenade... Now, I was in the Army for three years and no hand grenade would make an explosion like that... But it was a big dramatic moment and it looks really cool... and feels kind of real." ...|$|E

60|$|The President of the Council was Niccolo Tornielli, and {{he opened}} the sitting by {{reminding}} his hearers of their object, and calling for their opinions. At first no one would speak. They {{did not know what}} was in Checco's mind, and they had no wish to say anything that might be offensive to him. The Forlivesi are a cautious race! After a while an old man got up and timidly expressed the thanks of the citizens for the freedom which Checco had bestowed upon them, suggesting also that he should speak first.

500|$|Hunt played several instruments, {{including}} guitar, keyboards, drums, bass synthesizer, and {{the electronic}} drum. When he finished writing and recording the demos, Hunt began the album's primary recording sessions at Santa Fe Tracking Station in Los Angeles. With What Were You Hoping For?, Hunt pursued a [...] "harder edge" [...] and rawer aesthetic than featured on his previous work. He {{also wanted to}} explore a self-described [...] "gnarly" [...] guitar sound inspired {{by the work of}} Muddy Waters and The Stooges' 1973 album Raw Power. Hunt attempted the sound in the past, but encountered discouragement from management. He discussed his direction for the album in an interview for The Boombox, stating [...] "t wasn't necessarily punk music. It was more about trying to capture the growl of a cello. That to me is as nasty as it can get. That's a beautiful sound to me. When people talk about the distortion on the guitar, I hear <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> that growl of a cello." [...] Hunt wanted to take advantage of his newfound feeling of artistic freedom and lack of concern over marketability.|$|E
500|$|Evan {{decides to}} build the ark alone, gaining media {{attention}} and public ridicule as hundreds of animals assemble in pairs. Meanwhile, God appears to Joan as a waiter at a diner, where he listens {{to her as she}} expresses concern that Evan is losing his sanity and allowing himself to become a laughing stock, though claiming that [...] "God told him to do it." [...] Sympathetic toward Evan, God tells Joan that perhaps it is only opportunity for them, and explains that he does not give things but only the opportunity by which to obtain things, citing togetherness of families as one of these things. Seeing God's meaning, Joan finally returns to Evan with new-found faith and continues helping him finish the ark together in order to prepare for the flood. On September 22, the day of the flood, Evan's staffers arrive in support as well and Eugene shows him research he performed on Long. It is revealed that, many years ago, Long conquered Prestige Crest and later commissioned a dam, then destroyed the remaining land to have many of the lots and houses built. Long cut corners in building the dam, and will most likely do <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> his Public Land Act bill.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "enhanced" [...] video {{states that}} there are 724 {{references}} to Twin Peaks in the episode's closing scene. Among them, Jack Smith wears an eye patch and a red suit and dances funny, referencing not only the aforementioned [...] "One Eyes Jacks" [...] brothel and Nadine Hurley, but a dream sequence in Peaks, where a character known as the Man from Another Place wore a similar suit and danced in a bizarre fashion. In the final scene Carlton is seen holding his hand up and stating [...] "that is a damn fine cup of cider". In the Twin Peaks pilot Agent Cooper holds his hand {{the same way and}} states [...] "that is a damn fine cup of coffee." [...] Additionally, Carlton is later holding a cup of coffee on its side, displaying that the coffee is now solid in a fashion mimicking the same action by Agent Cooper in the final episode. A seven-foot tall man (John DeSantis) wearing a bow tie looks much like the giant from Agent Cooper's dream. Randy is seen at the end barking out the window like Bobby Briggs did to James Hurley in the holding cells. Bob Barker is seen dancing with a picture just as Leland Palmer did in Twin Peaks. The episode's end credits are accompanied by soap opera-type music and a shot of Paula's prom picture; Twin Peaks credits did exactly <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> Laura's photo.|$|E

500|$|Producer Ron Hauge came up {{with the}} idea of someone {{shooting}} a bird and feeling guilty about it. Hauge told the staff a few weeks before Cohen started writing the episode that when he was 13 or 14 years old, he accidentally killed a bird after he got a Wrist Rocket slingshot, and took a shot at a bird that he thought was [...] "far, far away". Hauge said his friends were excited about it, but he was [...] "dying inside". For the scene in which the bird is killed, Cohen received further inspiration from an episode of The Andy Griffith Show entitled [...] "Opie the Birdman". The writers were trying to figure out a way to have Bart kill the bird without actually wanting to kill it, and decided to give the gun a crooked sight that Bart would be unaware of, so when Bart intentionally takes a shot at the right of the bird to avoid it, the bullet still hits the bird. After Bart kills the mother bird, he imagines himself before a bird court with a vulture, an eagle, and a toucan as judges. This sequence was added to [...] "liven up the visuals", because the writers thought the episode tended too heavily towards extreme realism and because most of the scenes in the episode were taking place in and around the Simpsons' house. Then-show runner Mike Scully had done <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> an episode he wrote for season seven called [...] "Marge Be Not Proud". In that episode, Bart gets caught shoplifting, and writer Bill Oakley suggested the addition of a fantasy sequence to get away from the realism in the episode.|$|E
500|$|As a visibly distraught Rick hesitates {{to shoot}} Dale, Daryl takes {{the gun and}} inevitably shoots Dale in the head. Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter {{suggested}} that producers were subtly building up prior to the moment. Kirkman felt this marked Daryl's place in the group and was closure for the deceased Sophia Peletier, whose death caused Daryl {{to pull away from}} interacting with the group. Kirkman iterated that such actions were the testaments of his [...] "putting everything on the line and opening himself up in a way he had never done before because his childhood was so messed up."; [...] "So when he found out she was dead and in the barn all the time, that's why he retreated and separated himself from the group. It was because he allowed himself to care and it just backfired on him in a big way. He didn't {{want to be a part}} of the group and have those emotions and care about these people. So he's been distancing himself from them up until this point, and now he's seeing that these people need him and that he can fill a role and in being that harsh distant guy, you can do the things that no one else wants to do. He wants to step in and take that burden away from Rick for a moment. Rick is the one who stepped up and shot Sophia. Daryl saw that and because of his pain over the loss of Sophia he couldn't do that. But when he sees Rick hesitate to do <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> Dale he knows: this is my moment, this is where I can prove my worth, and he steps in and does what he needs to do." ...|$|E
500|$|In the video, Janet Jackson {{takes on}} a darker persona, {{previously}} unseen in her own music videos. Jim Farber of the New York Daily News described her as [...] "Sporting a thick thatch of wig hair, and eyes darkened by coal-black makeup... sullen and arty... Janet, however, never looked tougher, or more in control." [...] In the video, a sign appears with the logo of the song's title. The scene then changes a spacecraft traveling past Earth before the camera zooms in inside. Then, the lights came on and reveal Michael and Janet inside a small hole. Suddenly, the spacecraft zooms out through the outer part of the galaxy, sending them screaming. In the first verse, Michael {{is seen in the}} room where he is floating on gravity. Then, Michael is shown in a room with thousands of guitars where he breaks one while Janet sings the next verse. Then, it shows Michael dancing on the wall while Janet looks at her nail before playing a game of tag. Then, it shows Michael and Janet in a room where they are using a remote control by changing pictures of Gregory Peck, art painting, statues, etc. Next, it shows both Michael and Janet in the media room where they are playing a video game which Michael wins. Then, Janet sports a skimpy bikini in some scenes while {{at the core of the}} craft, grabs at her breasts, gives the camera a middle finger and simulates male urination where Michael is shown taking controls into some kind of Observation. (In the out-takes, there is a still color photograph of Michael also giving the camera a middle finger.) Meanwhile, Michael is seen in a white room while wearing a black robe where he is meditating before screaming which breaks the glass above him. Then, Michael and Janet perform a dance breakdown. Then, it cuts back to the media room where Janet is dancing with Michael being seen on the television screen while Janet does <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> Michael. Then, Michael is seen playing a tennis game where he is using a robotic orb to break jars. The video has influences of Japanese sci-fi Anime - several clips of the Zillion anime series, Vampire Hunter D 1985 movie, and the movie Akira can be seen in the background screens. The version of the video included on Michael Jackson's Vision is uncut and contains the [...] "Stop fucking with me" [...] lyric, which was censored in HIStory on Film, Volume II.|$|E
