40|$|A stalk and <b>top</b> <b>rot</b> {{disease of}} sorghum was {{observed}} at Pantnagar, India. The disease was severe {{on a number of}} genotypes. Infected plants showed signs of wilting of apical leaves and yellowing of lower leaves. Stalks turned brown, were full of bacterial exudate, and collapsed from rotten internodes. Rotting was fast and plants were killed within 2 - 3 days after symptom appearance. A bacterium consistently associated with disease symptoms was identified as Erwinia chrysanthemi pv. zeae. This is the first report of this bacterium as a cause of stalk and <b>top</b> <b>rot</b> of sorghum under natural conditions in India...|$|E

40|$|AbstractRecently, a new {{bacterial}} <b>top</b> <b>rot</b> {{disease of}} maize has frequently appeared {{in many areas}} of Yunnan Province, China. The pathogen of the disease was identified as Klebsiella pneumoniae (KpC 4), which is well known to cause pulmonary and urinary diseases in humans and animals and occasionally exists as a harmless endophyte in plants. To evaluate the virulence of the maize pathogen to maize and mice, we inoculated maize and mice with routine inoculation and intraperitoneal injection respectively according to Koch's postulates. The results showed that KpC 4 and the clinical strain K. pneumoniae 138 (Kp 138) were all highly pathogenic to maize and mice and the strain re-isolated from diseased mice also caused typical <b>top</b> <b>rot</b> symptoms on maize by artificial inoculation. It is highlighting that a seemingly dedicated human/animal pathogen could cause plant disease. This is the first report of K. pneumoniae, an opportunistic pathogen of human/animal, could infect maize and mice. The findings serve as an alert to plant, medical and veterinarian scientists regarding a potentially dangerous bacterial pathogen infecting both plants and animals/humans. The maize plants in the field could serve as a reservoir for K. pneumoniae which might infect animals and probably humans when conditions are favorable. The new findings not only are significant in the developing control strategy for the new disease in Yunnan, but also serve {{as a starting point for}} further studies on the mechanism of pathogenesis and epidemiology of K. pneumoniae...|$|E

40|$|Late blight rot due to {{the fungus}} Phythopthora infestans {{is one of the}} most {{destructive}} diseases of potatoes. Losses occur in the field and in storage. An important feature of the disease is that it is frequently followed by secondary decay organisms which rot the tubers much more rapidly than does P. infestans. Tuber infections arise in several ways. It is a well established fact that spores produced on blighted vines fall to the ground through which they are washed to the surface of the young growing tubers where they germinate and initiate tuber infections. According to Link and Ramsey, 1932, the fungus may gain entrance into the stem end of a tuber by growing along the stolon of a diseased plant but this method of infection seems to occur only rarely. According to Link and Ramsey, 1932, Crosier and Reddick, 1935, and Barrus et al, 1940, the fungus may grow and fruit in and on heavy wet soils during wet seasons and thus spread underground from tuber to tuber. Tubers are almost certain to become infected during harvesting operations if they are dug while the fungus is fruiting on the vines or if the tubers are covered in the field by blighted <b>tops.</b> <b>Rotted</b> tubers in storage are usually due to infections which took place before or during harvesting but if moist air and temperatures above 41 °F prevail in the storage room, the fungus may grow out of infected tubers and produce spores which may spread to nearly sound tubers.

5|$|Recorded dietary {{items include}} sago shoots and insects, {{and it also}} {{swallows}} small stones to help break up its food. It is apparently monogamous, but little else is known of its courtship behaviour. The only known nest was a shallow bowl in the <b>top</b> of a <b>rotting</b> tree stump that was lined with wood chips and dry leaves. The two young chicks were entirely covered in black down typical of precocial newly hatched rails. The estimated population of 3,500–15,000 birds and the restricted range mean that the invisible rail is classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Habitat loss has occurred through the harvesting of sago and conversion of the wetlands to rice cultivation, and the rail is eaten by local people. The described nest was in an area frequented by local villagers, so the rail may be more adaptable to habitat changes than had been thought.|$|R

American conservationists like Dr. Joseph Rothrock became concerned that the forests would not regrow if they were not managed properly. Lumber and Iron companies had harvested the old-growth forests for various reasons. They clear cut the forests and left behind nothing but dried tree <b>tops</b> and <b>rotting</b> stumps. The situation was exacerbated as often sparks of passing steam locomotives ignited wildfires that prevented the formation of second growth forests. The conservationists feared that the forest would never regrow if there was not a change in the philosophy of forest management - such as those measures which had been for some years making news in Europe and India. Knowledge of Forest management practices among the well informed, then being long in place in France and Germany added impetus to pay attention to the changes signaled by Great Britain's legislative actions. The American leaders across many states began calling for their state to purchase land from the lumber and iron companies. In the day in Pennsylvania, the lumber and iron companies were more than willing to sell their land since they had depleted the natural resources of the forests, more commercially valuable iron mines were providing ores, and selling the lands eliminated the annual need to pay property taxes. These demands of this movement were later recognized by sociologists and historians as one earmark of the Progressive Era in United States politics and social reorganization. The changes began to take place in 1895 when Dr. Rothrock was appointed the first commissioner of the Pennsylvania Department of Forests and Waters, the forerunner of today's Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources.

40|$|The {{classification}} of round wood {{depends on the}} defects and other morphological features of a tree trunk. Various tree species growing on different forest sites and in different conditions eventually present a wood quality influenced by said factors. The objective {{of this paper was}} to find out: 1) the distribution of round wood qua-lity classes of beech in three different site conditions and 2) the frequency of the defects influencing timber grading. The research was carried out on 15 different sample plots of three site quality classes, on which 1389 beech logs were classified according to the existing grading scheme. The most common timber quality (by vo-lume) was WC 0 and then in decreasing order: WD, WB 0 and WA 0, in proportions of: 15 : 10 : 4 : 1. This order was the same for the assortments obtained from the trees in all the analysed site quality classes. The most frequent defects influencing wood quality were knots, among which sound knots were in the majority. The proportion of the appearance of knots was 7 : 3 : 2 for sound knots, unsound and dead knots, as well as covered knots, respectively. Sweep, red heart and scars were of a similar frequency to sound knots, approx. 20 %. Double pith, shakes, <b>rot,</b> <b>top</b> diameter an...|$|R
5000|$|The {{wood of the}} European beech {{is used in the}} {{manufacture}} of numerous objects and implements. Its fine and short grain makes it an easy wood to work with, easy to soak, dye, varnish and glue. Steaming makes the wood even easier to machine. It has an excellent finish and is resistant to compression and splitting and it is stiff when flexed. Milling is sometimes difficult due to cracking. The density of the wood is 720 kg per cubic meter. It is particularly well suited for minor carpentry, particularly furniture. From chairs to parquetry (flooring) and staircases, the European beech can do almost anything other than heavy structural support, so long as it is not left outdoors. Its hardness make it ideal for making wooden mallets and workbench <b>tops.</b> The wood <b>rots</b> easily if it is not protected by a tar based on a distillate of its own bark (as used in railway sleepers). [...] It is better for paper pulp than many other broadleaved trees though is only sometimes used for this, the high cellulose content can also be spun into modal, which is used as a textile akin to cotton. The code for its use in Europe is [...] (from FAgus SYlvatica). Common beech is also considered one of the best firewoods for fireplaces.|$|R
