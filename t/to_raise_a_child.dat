2500|$|The Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) {{believes}} that mental disability {{is not a}} reason to deny sterilization. [...] The opinion of ACOG is that [...] "the physician must consult with the patient’s family, agents, and other caregivers" [...] if sterilization is desired for a mentally limited patient. [...] In 2003, Douglas Diekema wrote in Volume 9 of the journal Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities Research Reviews that [...] "involuntary sterilization ought not be performed on mentally retarded persons who retain the capacity for reproductive decision-making, the ability <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> or the capacity to provide valid consent to marriage." [...] The Journal of Medical Ethics claimed, in a 1999 article, that doctors are regularly confronted with request to sterilize mentally limited people who cannot give consent for themselves. The article recommend that sterilization should only occur {{when there is a}} [...] "situation of necessity" [...] and the [...] "benefits of sterilization outweigh the drawbacks." [...] The American Journal of Bioethics published an article, in 2010, that concluded the interventions used in the Ashley treatment may benefit future patients. [...] These interventions, {{at the request of the}} parents and guidance from the physicians, included a hysterectomy and surgical removal of the breast buds of the mentally and physically disabled child.|$|E
2500|$|Journalist Robert Slatzer (who later {{claimed to}} have been {{secretly}} married to Marilyn Monroe) claimed that a few weeks before Vélez's death, he interviewed her at her home and she confided in him that she was pregnant with Gary Cooper's child (by that time, Cooper was married to socialite Veronica [...] "Rocky" [...] Balfe). [...] According to Slatzer, Vélez said that Cooper refused to acknowledge the child, believing that Harald Ramond was the father. After Vélez died, Slatzer said he asked Cooper about the situation and Cooper confirmed that it was possible he might have been the father. Slatzer further claimed that he also interviewed Clara Bow (who had also dated Cooper in the 1920s), who revealed that shortly before Vélez's death, Cooper called her and screamed {{that he was going to}} kill Harald Ramond for impregnating Vélez. Slazter claimed that Bow told him that she never believed Vélez's baby was fathered by Ramond, and that she was convinced that Vélez had attempted to get Ramond to marry her to protect Cooper's reputation. Biographer Michelle Vogel speculated that if Cooper was the father, his rejection of Vélez and their child coupled with the idea of having <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> alone may have sent Vélez [...] "over the edge".|$|E

Mothers were interviewed on issues related <b>to</b> <b>raising</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> with disabilities.

A qualitative analysis of the transcripts revealed clear evidence of discrimination as a result of culture, disability, and a combination of cul-ture and disability. Professionals and strangers were responsible for the majority of the discrimination. Experiences were related to the higher number of interactions with ser-vice providers, lack of English language proficiency, being the solitary caregiver for their <b>child</b> with <b>a</b> disability, their status of “other, ” and the internalization of that status...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Mothers <b>raising</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> with ADHD can {{experience}} high parenting stress. We evaluated if mothers’ personality traits and own ADHD symptoms could also affect parenting stress. Method: 430 biological mothers from the Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with ADHD (MTA mothers) and 237 {{of a local}} normative comparison group (LNCG mothers) were evaluated at baseline. Interactions were tested between mothers’ group and maternal personality/ADHD symptoms related to parenting stress. Results: Compared to LNCG, MTA mothers had higher parenting stress, self-reported ADHD, neuroticism, and lower conscientiousness and agreeableness. When personality and ADHD were evaluated together, ADHD symptoms interacted with mothers’ group: high maternal ADHD was positively associated with parenting stress for LNCG but not MTA mothers. Conclusion: Personality traits or ADHD characteristics do not appear operative for the high parenting stress of mothers of <b>a</b> <b>child</b> with ADHD. However, high maternal ADHD or low conscientiousness are associated with stress levels similar <b>to</b> <b>raising</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> with ADHD...|$|R

50|$|Women's {{commitment}} skepticism {{arises from}} {{the high costs of}} falsely inferring a mate's commitment to a relationship. It hypothesizes that women have adapted to be cognitively biased towards under perceiving male interest and commitment. This is due to the high cost of a false positive - a man not being committed and a woman accepting him - that could lead <b>to</b> <b>raising</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> without <b>an</b> investing mate, reputational damage and risk reducing chances of future courtship. The cost of a false positive - a man that is committed and a woman rejecting him - is far less costly to the female. Women are limited to how many children they can have in a lifetime however, men are not limited and can reproduce multiple times therefore, overperception costs are higher for females. This hypothesis is mentioned briefly by Buss (2012).|$|R
