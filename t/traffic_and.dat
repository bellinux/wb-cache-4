40|$|Dominant anti-trafficking policy discourses {{represent}} trafficking as {{an issue}} of crime, “illegal” migration, victimhood and humanitarianism.

We argue for a shift from policy discourses with a very limited focus on crime and victimisation to more systemic understandings of <b>trafficking</b> <b>and</b> more robust micro-analyses of <b>trafficking</b> <b>and</b> everyday life. The article calls for an agnotological understanding of policy responses to <b>trafficking</b> <b>and</b> technology: these depend upon the production of ignorance. We critique limitations in policy understandings of trafficking-related aspects of online spaces, and argue for better engagement with online networks.

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} how arrestin regulates <b>trafficking</b> <b>and</b> {{signaling}} of the N-formyl peptide receptor (FPR), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). GPCRs {{are involved in}} almost all physiologic processes and numerous pathologic processes. There is an intimate relationship between GPCR <b>trafficking</b> <b>and</b> signaling that controls many cellular processes. However, the protein-protein interactions that control post-endocytic <b>trafficking</b> <b>and</b> signaling of GPCRs are poorly understood. Our previous reports demonstrated that three events take place upon FPR activation {{in the absence of}} arrestins: accumulation of FPR in the perinuclear recycling endosome, lack of FPR recycling and apoptosis. All of these phenotypes were rescued by reintroduction of arrestin- 2 cDNA. We therefore hypothesized that 1) FPR <b>trafficking</b> <b>and</b> signaling defects were linked and causal and 2) specific regions of arrestin- 2 regulate normal FPR <b>trafficking</b> <b>and</b> signaling. To address these hypotheses, we generated mutants of arrestin- 2 that were previously described or changed regions of similar amino acids to alanine. We then screened these mutants for the ability to rescue FPR-mediated apoptosis. Subsequently, we examined the role of these arrestin mutants in FPR trafficking. We found that two arrestin- 2 mutants demonstrated altered binding to adaptor protein (AP) - 2. Furthermore, FPR recycling was inhibited in the presence of either arrestin- 2 mutant or the absence of AP- 2. We also examined the role of Src kinase in FPR <b>trafficking</b> <b>and</b> signaling and determined that Src kinase has two independent roles in FPR-arrestin- 2 regulation: one that controls FPR <b>trafficking</b> <b>and</b> one that mediated FPR signaling. Finally, we found that different SH 3 -binding domains of arrestin- 2 regulate FPR <b>trafficking</b> <b>and</b> signaling independently. An arrestin- 2 mutant did not rescue FPR-mediated apoptosis, but did mediate normal FPR trafficking. These results indicate that FPR <b>trafficking</b> <b>and</b> signaling are coordinated processes, but may also be regulated independently. These studies have revealed novel aspects of arrestin- 2 that regulate FPR signaling <b>and</b> <b>trafficking.</b> We hope they will {{serve as a model for}} the regulation of other GPCRs. Furthermore, we hope these data are used to create small molecule inhibitors to serve as experimental tools and chemotherapeutics to better understand and treat diseases caused by defects in GPCR <b>trafficking</b> <b>and</b> signaling.
