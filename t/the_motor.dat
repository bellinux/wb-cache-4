5|$|The C5 {{is powered}} by a 12-volt {{lead-acid}} electric battery driving a motor with a continuous rating of 250 watts and a maximum speed of 4,100 revolutions per minute. It is coupled with a two-stage gear-drive that increases torque by a factor of 13, without which <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> {{would not be able to}} move the vehicle when a person is on board. However, <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> is vulnerable to overheating. The torque increases as the load on the vehicle increases, for instance by going up too steep a gradient. Sinclair's tests showed that it could cope under power with a maximum slope of 1 in 12 (8%) and could manage a 1 in 7 (14%) slope using the pedals. As the speed of <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> reduces, the current flow through its windings increases, drawing up to 140 amps at stall speed. This would very quickly burn <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> out if sustained, so the motor's load is constantly monitored by the C5's electronics. If it stalls under full load the electronics disable <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> after 4 seconds, while if it is under heavy load (around 80 or 90 amps) it trips after two or three minutes. A heat-sensitive resistor inside <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> warns the driver if the vehicle is beginning to overheat and disconnects <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> after a short time, and a third line of defence is provided by a metallic strip mounted on <b>the</b> <b>motor.</b> If an excessive temperature is reached the strip distorts and the power is disconnected.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with getting}} <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> patented, Peck and Brown {{arranged}} to get <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> publicized, starting with independent testing to verify {{it was a}} functional improvement, followed by press releases sent to technical publications for articles to run concurrent {{with the issue of}} the patent. Physicist William Arnold Anthony (who tested <b>the</b> <b>motor)</b> and Electrical World magazine editor Thomas Commerford Martin arranged for Tesla to demonstrate his alternating current motor on 16 May 1888 at the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. Engineers working for the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company reported to George Westinghouse that Tesla had a viable AC motor and related power system — something Westinghouse needed for the alternating current system he was already marketing. Westinghouse looked into getting a patent on a similar commutator-less, rotating magnetic field-based induction motor developed in 1885 and presented in a paper in March 1888 by Italian physicist Galileo Ferraris, but decided that Tesla's patent would probably control the market.|$|E

50|$|The only {{flight control}} {{surfaces}} used on the Helios Prototype are 72 trailing-edge elevators that provide pitch control. Spanning the entire wing, they are operated by tiny servomotors linked to the aircraft's flight control computer. To turn the aircraft in flight, yaw control is applied by applying differential power on <b>the</b> <b>motors</b> — speeding up <b>the</b> <b>motors</b> on one outer wing panel while slowing down <b>motors</b> on <b>the</b> other outer panel. A major test during the initial flight series was the evaluation of differential motor power {{as a means of}} pitch control. During normal cruise the outer wing panels of Helios are arched upward and give the aircraft the shape of a shallow crescent when viewed from the front or rear. This configuration places <b>the</b> <b>motors</b> on <b>the</b> outer wing panels higher than <b>the</b> <b>motors</b> on <b>the</b> center panels. Speeding up <b>the</b> outer-panel <b>motors</b> caused <b>the</b> aircraft to pitch down and begin a descent.

5|$|In 1887, Tesla {{developed}} an induction motor that ran on alternating current, a power system format that was rapidly expanding in Europe and the United States {{because of its}} advantages in long-distance, high-voltage transmission. <b>The</b> <b>motor</b> used polyphase current, which generated a rotating magnetic field to turn <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> (a principle that Tesla claimed to have conceived in 1882). This innovative electric motor, patented in May 1888, was a simple self-starting design that did not need a commutator, thus avoiding sparking and the high maintenance of constantly servicing and replacing mechanical brushes.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>motor</b> {{symptoms}} of PD {{are the result}} of reduced dopamine production in the brain's basal ganglia. Dopamine does not cross the blood-brain barrier, so it cannot be taken as a medicine to boost the brain's depleted levels of dopamine. However a precursor of dopamine, levodopa, can pass through to the brain where it is readily converted to dopamine, and administration of levodopa temporarily diminishes <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> {{symptoms of}} PD.

5|$|Torque {{generated}} by the drive causes the induction motor to run at synchronous speed less the slip. If the load drives <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> faster than synchronous speed, <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> acts as a generator, converting mechanical power back to electrical power. This power is returned to the drive's DC link element (capacitor or reactor). A DC-link-connected electronic power switch or braking DC chopper controls dissipation of this power as heat {{in a set of}} resistors. Cooling fans may be used to prevent resistor overheating.|$|E
5|$|With a VFD, the {{stopping}} {{sequence is}} just the opposite as the starting sequence. The frequency and voltage applied to <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> are ramped down at a controlled rate.

A small amount of braking torque is available to help decelerate the load a little faster than it would stop if <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> were simply switched off and allowed to coast.

With a four-quadrant rectifier (active front-end), the VFD is able to brake the load by applying a reverse torque and injecting the energy back to the AC line.|$|E
