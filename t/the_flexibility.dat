5|$|At {{the back}} of the skull there is a protrusion, called the nuchal crest, arising from the fused parietal bones, a feature shared with all tyrannosaurids. In Alioramus, the nuchal crest is greatly thickened, {{similarly}} to Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus. Like the rest of the skull, the lower jaw of Alioramus was long and slender, another possible juvenile characteristic. As in Tarbosaurus, a ridge on the outer surface of the angular bone of the lower jaw articulated with the rear of the dentary bone, locking the two bones together and removing much of <b>the</b> <b>flexibility</b> seen in other tyrannosaurids. Other tyrannosaurids had four premaxillary teeth, D-shaped in cross section, on each side. Including 16 or 17 in each maxilla, and 18 in each dentary, Alioramus had 76 or 78 teeth, more than any other tyrannosaurid.

In this study, the conformational entropy is used {{as an indicator of}} <b>the</b> protein <b>flexibility.</b> We first explore whether the conformational change can capture <b>the</b> protein <b>flexibility.</b> <b>The</b> well-defined decoy structures are converted into one-dimensional series of letters from a structural alphabet. Four different structure alphabets, including the secondary structure in 3 -class and 8 -class, the PB structure alphabet (16 -letter), and the DW structure alphabet (28 -letter), are investigated. The conformational entropy is then calculated from the structure alphabet letters. Some of the proteins show high correlation between the conformation entropy and <b>the</b> protein <b>flexibility.</b> We then predict <b>the</b> protein <b>flexibility</b> from basic amino acid sequence. The local structures are predicted by the dual-layer model and the conformational entropy of the predicted class distribution is then calculated. The results show that the conformational entropy is a good indicator of <b>the</b> protein <b>flexibility,</b> but false positives remain a problem. The DW structure alphabet performs the best, which means that more subtle local structures can be captured by large number of structure alphabet letters. Overall this study provides a simple and efficient method for the characterization and prediction of <b>the</b> protein <b>flexibility...</b>|$|R

The style allows an author to vary discourse between the narrator's voice and values and those of the characters.|$|E

As ethanol fuel economy is lower than gasoline because of ethanol's energy content is close to 34% less per unit volume than gasoline, flex cars running on ethanol get a lower mileage than when running on pure gasoline. However, this effect is partially offset by the usually lower price per liter of ethanol fuel.

40|$|This paper aims at {{clarifying}} {{the concept of}} strategic flexibility, starting from that much more common of manufacturing flexibility (or operational one). After characterizing {{the dimensions of the}} latter, a classification of strategic flexibility is presented which distinguishes four categories. The measures of strategic flexibility are also investigated. Then two analogies are pointed out with <b>the</b> operational <b>flexibility.</b> <b>The</b> first, of the cause-effect type, is on two levels: at the business level, <b>the</b> operational <b>flexibility</b> estimates <b>the</b> variation of practices, while <b>the</b> strategic <b>flexibility</b> measures <b>the</b> effect obtained on performances; at the corporate level, <b>the</b> operational <b>flexibility</b> estimates <b>the</b> variation of competences, while <b>the</b> strategic <b>flexibility</b> evaluates <b>the</b> change in business. The second analogy, related to the classification variables, permits the main types of operational and strategic flexibilities to be placed in a single framework. So this study seeks to provide a framework [...] which has not been proposed in prior literature [...] for analyzing and evaluating the correlated concepts of operational and strategic flexibilities, to create a theoretical foundation for future research and empirical testing.
