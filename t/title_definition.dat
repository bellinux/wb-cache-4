40|$|Abstract Objective: to {{validate}} {{the content of the}} new nursing diagnosis, termed risk for pressure ulcer. Method: the content validation with a sample made up of 24 nurses who were specialists in skin care from six different hospitals in the South and Southeast of Brazil. Data collection took place electronically, through an instrument constructed using the SurveyMonkey program, containing a <b>title,</b> <b>definition,</b> and 19 risk factors for the nursing diagnosis. The data were analyzed using Fehring's method and descriptive statistics. The project was approved by a Research Ethics Committee. Results: <b>title,</b> <b>definition</b> and seven risk factors were validated as "very important": physical immobilization, pressure, surface friction, shearing forces, skin moisture, alteration in sensation and malnutrition. Among the other risk factors, 11 were validated as "important": dehydration, obesity, anemia, decrease in serum albumin level, prematurity, aging, smoking, edema, impaired circulation, and decrease in oxygenation and in tissue perfusion. The risk factor of hyperthermia was discarded. Conclusion: the content validation of these components of the nursing diagnosis corroborated the importance of the same, being able to facilitate the nurse's clinical reasoning and guiding clinical practice in the preventive care for pressure ulcers...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{validate}} the nursing diagnosis Spiritual anguish. Methods: Using the methodological framework proposed by Fehring was utilized a semi-structured questionnaire answered by {{a sample of}} 72 nurses, to evaluate the <b>title,</b> <b>definition</b> and defining characteristics of the diagnosis Spiritual anguish, {{as well as the}} classification in the Taxonomy II North American Nursing Diagnosis Association. Results: The best area to classify the studied diagnosis according to the expert nurses was the Domain 10; however the Domain classes need to be reviewed. Spirituality impaired proved to be a fitting title for the investigated concept. The validation identified seven defining characteristics as important indicators of clinical diagnosis; the feature- is not interested in nature- was considered little relevant. The total score of diagnosis was 0. 72, therefore was considered validated. Conclusion: The new proposal submitted to explaining the phenomenon under study was considered relevant. This study may provide insight to validate clinically, diagnostics investigated...|$|E

Coaching has been advocated as an approach to meet the conditions of quality {{professional development}}, and it has demonstrated {{a positive impact on}} student mathematics achievement scores when implemented over multiple years. Ambiguity of <b>title,</b> <b>definition,</b> and role surround coaching, presenting challenges to its execution in schools. This study proposed a definition of Enacted Math Coaching to help address this ambiguity. As schools throughout Metropolitan Detroit adopt coaching as a component of school reform initiatives, {{the purpose of this study}} was to document and describe the professional experience and daily work of mathematics coaches in schools in Metropolitan Detroit. This included an exploration of the qualifications coaches bring to the role and their on-going professional development opportunities, as well as an analysis of their intended and enacted goals and activities. Data was gathered using a questionnaire, interviews, observations, and existing documents. This study found clarity and consensus on the audience and purpose for math coaching. A review of the activities which coaches valued, and those on which they spent their time, highlighted a disconnect between priorities and implementation. Coaches reported spending only one fourth of their time on coaching activities of any type. Coaches had received training in curriculum materials, analyzing tasks and lessons in terms of the underlying mathematics, and strategies for supporting teachers and students. They sought more development in working with adult learners and strategies for supporting low-achieving students...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 The present {{status of}} {{plastics}} {{is one of}} constant change, but this thesis attempts {{to focus attention on}} the state of the industry as of 1967. Beginning with a brief <b>title</b> <b>definition</b> and history of plastics, the writer proceeds to a discussion on the structural characteristics of plastics. Under this heading, a brief molecular description of plastic is given followed by a discussion on strength characteristics such as stress-strain diagrams, creep, stress relaxation, and the effects of environment. It is noted, however, that such strength characteristics can be markedly altered by proper selection of additives. Such additives are broken into three classes: reinforcements, fillers, and others. These additives greatly complicate design, however, increasing the need for accurate property data; mention is made of the difficulty of obtaining such design data. Design of plastics, as of 1967, is usually done with standard engineering formulas. For plastics, this is a very inaccurate method of design and requires a large factor of safety. However, design advancements are being made, such as the development of the time dependent modulus, Boltzmann modulus, and percentage of ultimate concept. Structural plastics today find a wide range of application: they are being used in aircraft; they are being used for wood-plastic alloys; automobile bodies have been constructed of them for many years; and marine applications vary from production of nine foot boats to 160 foot long ships. Yet, the future is even more promising. The writer concludes by mentioning some of the promising areas of current research; the most promising of which is improved resin reinforcement...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the large-time behavior of solutions to the Cauchy problem on the two-fluid Euler-Maxwell system with collisions when initial data are around a constant equilibrium state. The main goal is the rigorous justification of diffusion phenomena in fluid plasma at the linear level. Precisely, motivated by the classical Darcy's law for the nonconductive fluid, we first give a heuristic derivation of the asymptotic equations of the Euler-Maxwell system in large time. It turns out that both the density and the magnetic field tend time-asymptotically to the diffusion equations with diffusive coefficients explicitly determined by given physical parameters. Then, in terms of the Fourier energy method, we analyze the linear dissipative structure of the system, which implies the almost exponential time-decay property of solutions over the high-frequency domain. The key part of the paper is the spectral analysis of the linearized system, exactly capturing the diffusive feature of solutions over the low-frequency domain. Finally, under some conditions on initial data, we show the convergence of the densities and the magnetic field to the corresponding linear diffusion waves with the rate $(1 +t) ^{- 5 / 4 }$ in $L^ 2 $ norm and also the convergence of the velocities and the electric field to the corresponding asymptotic profiles given {{in the sense of the}} geneneralized Darcy's law with the faster rate $(1 +t) ^{- 7 / 4 }$ in $L^ 2 $ norm. Thus, this work can be also regarded as the mathematical proof of the Darcy's law in the context of collisional fluid plasma. Comment: 46 pages. The paper was modified according to referees' reports. Main modifications: <b>Title,</b> <b>definition</b> of the asymptotic profile (1. 5) -(1. 8), the statement of Theorem 1. 1 where the assumption that |x| B_ 0 is L^ 1 _x etc was removed, and some other corrected typos or minor mistakes pointed out in the report.

40|$|Many {{applications}} in navigation, land surveying, land <b>title</b> <b>definitions</b> and mapping have been simplified and more precise due to accessibility of Global Positioning System (GPS) signals. Therefore {{the demand for}} using advanced GPS techniques in different surveying applications becomes essential. Differential positioning was {{the only source of}} accurate positioning for years despite its cost. The Precise Point Positioning (PPP) technique is viable alternative to differential positioning method where the user with single receiver can attain positioning accuracy in centimeter or decimeter level. In recent years, many organizations introduced online (GPS-PPP) processing services capable of determining accurate geocentric positions using GPS observations. These services provide GPS estimates to the user in free and unlimited access formats from the internet. This paper investigates the accuracy of Canadian Spatial Reference System (CSRS) Precise Point Positioning (PPP) (CSRS-PPP) service supervised by the Geodetic Survey Division (GSD), Canada. Single frequency static GPS observations have been collected over three points from three baselines with different lengths 1. 6, 7 and 10 km in various elapsed time 60, 90 and 120 minutes. The discrepancies between the CSRS-PPP estimates and the traditional differential GPS solutions were computed. The obtained results illustrate that the PPP produces a horizontal error of 22. 5 cm which is accurate enough or many mapping {{applications in}} developing countries with saving in cost and experience.

40|$|Workforce {{planning}} {{has become}} an increasing concern within the DOE community as the Office of Environmental Restoration and Waste Management (ER/WM or EM) seeks to consolidate and refocus its activities and the Office of Defense Programs (DP) closes production sites. Attempts to manage the growth and skills mix of the EM workforce while retaining the critical skills of the DP workforce have been difficult {{due to the lack}} of a consistent set of occupational <b>titles</b> and <b>definitions</b> across the complex. Two reasons for this difficulty may be cited. First, classification systems commonly used in industry often fail to cover in sufficient depth the unique demands of DOE`s nuclear energy and research community. Second, the government practice of contracting the operation of government facilities to the private sector has introduced numerous contractor-specific classification schemes to the DOE complex. As a result, sites/contractors report their workforce needs using unique classification systems. It becomes difficult, therefore, to roll these data up to the national level necessary to support strategic planning and analysis. The Common Occupational Classification System (COCS) is designed to overcome these workforce planning barriers. The COCS is based on earlier workforce planning activities and the input of technical, workforce planning, and human resource managers from across the DOE complex. It provides a set of mutually-exclusive occupation <b>titles</b> and <b>definitions</b> that cover the broad range of activities present in the DOE complex. The COCS is not a required record-keeping or data management guide. Neither is it intended to replace contractor/DOE-specific classification systems. Instead, the system provides a consistent, high- level, functional structure of occupations to which contractors can crosswalk (map) their job titles...|$|R
