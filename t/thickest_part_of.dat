The middle armour belt had a maximum thickness of 7inches (178mm) over the same length as the <b>thickest</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the waterline armour and thinned to five inches abreast 'A' barbette.

500|$|Like other mammals, {{the skin}} of baleen whales has an epidermis, a dermis, a hypodermis, and {{connective}} tissue. The epidermis, the pigmented layer, is [...] thick, along with connective tissue. The epidermis itself is only [...] thick. The dermis, the layer underneath the epidermis, is also thin. The hypodermis, containing blubber, is the <b>thickest</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the skin and functions {{as a means to}} conserve heat. Right whales have the thickest hypodermis of any cetacean, averaging , though, as in all whales, it is thinner around openings (such as the blowhole) and limbs. Blubber may also be used to store energy during times of fasting. The connective tissue between the hypodermis and muscles allows only limited movement to occur between them. Unlike in toothed whales, baleen whales have small hairs on the top of their head, stretching from the tip of the rostrum to the blowhole, and, in right whales, on the chin. Like other marine mammals, they lack sebaceous and sweat glands.|$|E
