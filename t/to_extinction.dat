5|$|The three extant manatee species (family Trichechidae) and the Dugong (family Dugongidae) {{are rated}} as {{vulnerable}} on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. All four are vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>extinction</b> from habitat loss and other negative impacts related to human {{population growth and}} coastal development. Steller's sea cow, extinct since 1786, was hunted <b>to</b> <b>extinction</b> by humans.|$|E
5|$|Other threats include habitat alteration, {{damage and}} loss from coastal development, {{pollution}} {{and the impact}} of fisheries on the seabed and prey species. The 2007 documentary, Sharkwater exposed how sharks are being hunted <b>to</b> <b>extinction.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{mourning}} dove is a related species {{to the passenger}} pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius), which was hunted <b>to</b> <b>extinction</b> in the early 1900s. For this reason, {{the possibility of using}} {{mourning dove}}s for cloning the passenger pigeon has been discussed.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was <b>to</b> compare the <b>extinctions</b> {{calculated}} from data obtained with the Ames Wire Impactor <b>to</b> <b>extinctions</b> measured with the SAGE 11 satellite system. The comparison was intended to serve as a validation of the extinctions obtained using the wire impactor data. It was felt that if the extinctions obtained by the two diverse methods agreed well, it would be an indication that the number densities measured on the wires were correct. Tables and charts are presented <b>to</b> show the <b>extinction</b> values from the two different methods...|$|R

5|$|After {{the lineup}} stabilized, the band {{released}} {{a number of}} platinum-selling albums, including Rust in Peace (1990) and Countdown <b>to</b> <b>Extinction</b> (1992). These albums, along with touring worldwide, helped bring public recognition to Megadeth. The band temporarily disbanded in 2002 when Mustaine suffered an arm injury and re-established in 2004 without bassist Ellefson, who had taken legal action against Mustaine. Ellefson settled with Mustaine out of court and rejoined the group in 2010. Megadeth has hosted its own music festival, Gigantour, several times since mid-2005.|$|E
5|$|Bighorn sheep, {{which were}} driven locally extinct through hunting and disease, have been reintroduced {{in the east}} of the park. The Park Service and the Yosemite Fund have also helped {{peregrine}} falcons and great gray owls to re-establish themselves. Tule elk, which had been hunted almost <b>to</b> <b>extinction,</b> were housed in a pen in Yosemite before being moved to the Owens Valley in eastern California.|$|E
5|$|Countdown <b>to</b> <b>Extinction</b> {{received}} {{positive reaction}} from music critics, who noted its politically oriented lyrics and simplified sound {{in comparison to}} their previous record. The album entered the Billboard 200 at number two, the band's highest position ever. It eventually achieved double platinum status and became their most commercially successful album. The record was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 1993 Grammy Awards, while the album's title track won the Humane Society's Genesis Award for raising awareness for animal rights issues.|$|E
50|$|Background {{extinction}} rate, {{also known}} as the normal <b>extinction</b> rate, refers <b>to</b> the standard rate of extinction in earth's geological and biological history before humans became a primary contributor <b>to</b> <b>extinctions.</b> This is primarily the pre-human extinction rates during periods in between major extinction events.|$|R

5|$|In Britain and elsewhere, {{commercial}} forestry has created new habitat which has increased numbers, but these gains {{are likely to}} be temporary as the woodland develops and becomes unsuitable for nightjars. In the United Kingdom, it is red-listed as a cause for concern, and in Ireland it is close <b>to</b> <b>extinction.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, thrash {{achieved}} breakout success, challenging and redefining the metal mainstream. Metallica's self-titled 1991 album topped the Billboard chart, {{as the band}} established international following. Megadeth's Countdown <b>to</b> <b>Extinction</b> (1992) debuted at number two, Anthrax and Slayer cracked the top 10, and albums by regional bands such as Testament and Sepultura entered the top 100.|$|E
5|$|Megadeth's {{previous}} studio release, Countdown <b>to</b> <b>Extinction,</b> {{became the}} band's biggest commercial accomplishment, entering the Billboard 200 at number two and eventually becoming double platinum. As a result, they continually sold out arenas across North America, {{in addition to}} developing a strong following overseas. With the next album, Youthanasia, the band moved towards a more mainstream sound.|$|E
40|$|Many open-access resources, such as elephants, {{are used}} to produce {{storable}} goods. Anticipated future scarcity of these resources will increase current prices and poaching. This implies that, for given initial conditions, there may be rational expectations equilibria leading <b>to</b> both <b>extinction</b> and survival. The cheapest way for governments <b>to</b> eliminate <b>extinction</b> equilibria may be to commit to tough antipoaching measures if the population falls below a threshold. For governments without credibility, the cheapest way <b>to</b> eliminate <b>extinction</b> equilibria may be to accumulate a sufficient stockpile of the storable good and threaten to sell it should the population fall. ...|$|R

5|$|Mountain birds around Helvellyn {{include the}} raven (Corvus corax), {{which has now}} become common. Peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus), buzzards (Buteo buteo) and ring ouzels (Turdus torquatus) have all bred in the {{immediate}} area. Skylarks (Alauda arvensis) and wheatears (Oenanthe oenanthe) are frequently encountered. At one time eagles (probably Aquila chrysaetos) soared over the mountain and bred on the steep cliffs above Red Tarn, but even in Wordsworth's day they had gone, having been persecuted <b>to</b> <b>extinction.</b>|$|E
5|$|Of 19 {{species of}} native nestmaking {{bumblebees}} and six species of cuckoo bumblebees formerly widespread in Britain, three have been extirpated, eight are in serious decline, and only six remain widespread. Similar declines {{have been reported}} in Ireland, with four species designated endangered, and another two considered vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>extinction.</b> A decline in bumblebee numbers could cause large-scale changes to the countryside, resulting from inadequate pollination of certain plants.|$|E
5|$|On islands, birds can {{contribute}} {{as much as}} 60% of a cat's diet. In nearly all cases, however, the cat cannot be identified as the sole cause for reducing the numbers of island birds, and in some instances, eradication of cats has caused a 'mesopredator release' effect; where the suppression of top carnivores creates an abundance of smaller predators that cause a severe decline in their shared prey. Domestic cats are, however, {{known to be a}} contributing factor to the decline of many species, a factor that has ultimately led, in some cases, <b>to</b> <b>extinction.</b> The South Island piopio, Chatham rail, the New Zealand merganser, and the common diving petrel are a few from a long list, with the most extreme case being the flightless Lyall's wren, which was driven <b>to</b> <b>extinction</b> only a few years after its discovery.|$|E

5|$|Once safely {{established}} on Madagascar, with its limited mammalian population, the lemurs were {{protected from the}} increasing competition from evolving arboreal mammalian groups. Monkeys had evolved by the Oligocene, and their intelligence, aggression, and deceptiveness may have given them the advantage in exploiting the environment over the diurnal adapiform primates in Africa and Asia, ultimately driving them <b>to</b> <b>extinction</b> and leaving only the nocturnal lorisoids.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys peninsulae, {{also known}} as the Lower California rice rat, is a species of rodent from western Mexico. Restricted to the {{southern}} tip of the Baja California peninsula, it {{is a member of the}} genus Oryzomys of family Cricetidae. Only about twenty individuals, collected around 1900, are known, and subsequent destruction of its riverine habitat may have driven the species <b>to</b> <b>extinction.</b>|$|E
5|$|Scotland's {{wildlife}} {{is typical}} of the north-west of Europe, although several of the larger mammals such as the lynx, brown bear, wolf, elk and walrus were hunted <b>to</b> <b>extinction</b> in historic times.

5|$|Storm petrels {{face the}} same threats as other seabirds; in {{particular}} they are threatened by introduced species. The Guadalupe storm petrel was driven <b>to</b> <b>extinction</b> by feral cats, and introduced predators have also been responsible for declines in other species. Habitat degradation which limits nesting opportunities caused by introduced goats and pigs is also a problem, especially if it increases competition from more aggressive burrowing petrels.|$|E
5|$|The Falkland Islands are a biogeographical part of {{the mild}} Antarctic zone, with strong {{connections}} to {{the flora and fauna}} of Patagonia in mainland South America. Land birds make up most of the Falklands' avifauna; 63 species breed on the islands, including 16 endemic species. There is also abundant arthropod diversity on the islands. The Falklands' flora consists of 163 native vascular species. The islands' only native terrestrial mammal, the warrah, was hunted <b>to</b> <b>extinction</b> by European settlers.|$|E
5|$|The {{authors of}} the 2015 study which {{resolved}} the phylogenetic placement of the Mascarene island parakeets suggested that the echo parakeet of Mauritius would be a suitable ecological replacement for the Réunion parakeet and Newton's parakeet, due to their close evolutionary relationship.
