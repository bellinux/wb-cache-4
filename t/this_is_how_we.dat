2500|$|During Minnesota's 2006 DFL primary for Minnesota's 5th District {{seat in the}} United States House of Representatives the Twin Cities-based {{publication}} American Jewish World endorsed Keith Ellison citing {{his work}} during the ethics complaint {{as one of their}} reasons. [...] They wrote [...] "Ellison acted as the lawyer for the House DFL caucus in an ethics proceeding against former representative Arlon Lindner, who contended that gays were not victims of Nazi oppression in the Holocaust. [...] Ellison understands the importance of guarding against Holocaust denial and revisionism, and links the lessons of the Shoah to more recent cases of genocide in Rwanda and Darfur." [...] The Ellison campaign called this an [...] "extremely valued and valuable endorsement", and Ellison said [...] "I am humbled, and just plain thrilled, by the confidence the American Jewish World has placed in my vision of a just future where there are no throw-away people and peace is our guiding principle. ...<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>we</b> will win – by creating a powerful force of real people unified behind a passion for justice."

2500|$|Two months later, {{criticism}} of the perp walk resumed when Strauss-Kahn's bail terms were reduced from house arrest to his own recognizance after the office of Manhattan district attorney Cyrus Vance, Jr. found the housekeeper had been dishonest with them about other aspects of her story than the attack. Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who had earlier defended the perp walk, criticized it as [...] "outrageous". City Councilman David G. Greenfield introduced legislation that would ban perp walks. [...] "I honestly believe it's unconstitutional," [...] he said. [...] "If we banned it here we could {{send a message to}} the country." [...] Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said the media was to blame, not his department. [...] "If they make a decision to stake out a location when someone is walked out of the front of a precinct ... it's not a decision that the Police Department makes", he said. [...] "We have been walking prisoners out of the front doors of stationhouses for 150 years in the Police Department ... <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>we</b> transport people to court ... I don't think the genie's ever gonna be put back inside the bottle. That's the way it is." [...] The legislation was seen as unlikely to pass.|$|E

An oaken stick, sufficiently long to reach {{from one side of}} the fireplace to the other, and trimmed with knives until it was no larger around than the ramrod of a matchlock, forms our spit, and this we thrust through the body of the bird from end to end. A pile of rocks on either side of the fireplace, at a proper distance from the burning wood, serves as rests for the ends of the wooden spit, and when thus placed the bird will be cooked in front of the fire, if whosoever is attending to the labor turns the carcass from time to time, so that each portion may receive an equal amount of heat.|$|E

These issues seem to be significant because when the consumptionist and neo-liberal discourse is reconstructed, the aspect of commodification of a human being through cyborgization is omitted or marginalized. Yet such a context of commodification seems to be especially important as it constitutes the idea of radical questioning of a biological body as a commodity of a high market value. Thus, it constitutes the paradox of the commodification of body, i. e. a situation when a body that is the most attractive from the consumer’s viewpoint is a body that is disembodied to the maximum...|$|R
