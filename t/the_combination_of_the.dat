5|$|According to Walter Breen, Snowden {{most likely}} chose <b>the</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Indian Head and the laurel wreath {{as it was}} the lowest relief of any of the options, and could be {{expected}} to strike well. On November 4, 1858, Snowden wrote to Treasury Secretary Howell Cobb about the Indian Head design, and two days later wrote to Longacre, informing him that it was approved. Longacre was to prepare the necessary dies for production, which was to begin on January 1, 1859.|$|E
5|$|After renovations were {{finished}} in 2005, {{the number of}} two- and three-bedroom units was increased dramatically, due to <b>the</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building's original studio apartments. The larger layouts attracted more families to the cooperative community.

40|$|We {{consider}} two nonlinear {{methods for}} generating uniform pseudo-random numbers in [0, 1), namely quadratic congruential generator and inversive congruential generator. <b>The</b> <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Van der Corput sequence with the considered nonlinear generators are proposed. We simplify the mixed sequences by a restriction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> b-adic representation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> points. We study numerically <b>the</b> b-adic diaphony <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nets obtained through quadratic congruential generator, inversive congruential generator, their <b>combinations</b> with <b>the</b> Van der Corput sequence, and <b>the</b> simplification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mixed sequences. <b>The</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> b-adic diaphony decreases with <b>the</b> increase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> points <b>of</b> <b>the</b> simplified sequences which proves that <b>the</b> points <b>of</b> <b>the</b> simplified sequences are pseudo-random numbers. <b>The</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> results shows that <b>the</b> <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Van der Corput sequence with these nonlinear generators have good pseudo-random properties {{as well as}} the generators...|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to the above theoretical applications, many practical applications of groups exist. Cryptography relies on <b>the</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> abstract group theory approach together with algorithmical knowledge obtained in computational group theory, in particular when implemented for finite groups. Applications of group theory are not restricted to mathematics; sciences such as physics, chemistry and computer science benefit from the concept.|$|E
5|$|Multi-platform {{releases}} {{were common}} {{in the early days}} of RPGs, but there was a period during the 1990s when this was not generally the case. The sixth generation of home gaming consoles led many game developers to resume the practice, and some opted to develop primarily or exclusively for consoles. <b>The</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Xbox and DirectX technologies proved especially popular due to the two systems' architectural similarities, as well as their common set of programming tools. Multimedia and art assets, which account for a greater proportion of the development budget than in the past, are easily transferable between multiple platforms.|$|E

5|$|Once other {{investigations}} have indicated Wilson's disease, the ideal test is {{the removal of}} {{a small amount of}} liver tissue through a liver biopsy. This is assessed microscopically for the degree of steatosis and cirrhosis, and histochemistry and quantification of copper are used to measure the severity of the copper accumulation. A level of 250 μg of copper per gram of dried liver tissue confirms Wilson's disease. Occasionally, lower levels of copper are found; in that case, <b>the</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> biopsy findings with all other tests could still lead to a formal diagnosis of Wilson's.|$|E
5|$|The Programmer {{accessory}} {{had been}} {{mentioned in the}} earliest advertisement {{but it was not}} featured until March 1974. This was the same size as a desktop calculator and could hold 256 programming steps. (It could be expanded to 512 steps.) It was limited to emulating calculator key presses and simple sequence branching. The programming was done by entering hexadecimal key codes. <b>The</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> MITS 7440 calculator and the programmer was not nearly as sophisticated as the HP 9830 calculator but $400 for both kits was a fraction of the HP price.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{distance}} and proper motion {{of this system}} {{can be used to}} compute the transverse velocity of IK Pegasi as 16.9 km/s. The third component, the heliocentric radial velocity, can be measured by the average red-shift (or blue-shift) of the stellar spectrum. The General Catalogue of Stellar Radial Velocities lists a radial velocity of -11.4 km/s for this system. The combination of these two motions gives a space velocity of 20.4 km/s relative to the Sun.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{compressed}} domain {{is appealing}} for the image retrieval because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> direct efficient feature extraction; moreover, currently {{almost all the}} images are available in a compressed format using the Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT). In this paper, the quantized histogram statistical texture features are extracted from the DCT blocks using <b>the</b> significant energy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> DC and the first three AC coefficients <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blocks and are used for <b>the</b> retrieval <b>of</b> <b>the</b> similar images. <b>The</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> image retrieval is analyzed by performing an experimental comparison <b>of</b> <b>the</b> different <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> texture features to get an optimum <b>combination</b> and <b>the</b> comparison <b>of</b> <b>the</b> different quantization bins by using <b>the</b> optimum <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> features. The proposed approach is tested by using the Corel image database and the experimental {{results show that the}} proposed approach has a robust image retrieval using <b>the</b> <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> features with the different histogram quantization bins in the frequency domain...|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{humiliation of}} Casey, {{the deaths of}} the topmen, and the severe {{punishment}} {{of the rest of the}} sailors appears to have driven the crew to mutiny. These factors, however, were arguably the final events in a series of harsh and brutal punishments by the captain. Dudley Pope, in his book The Black Ship, argues that it was not Pigot's cruelty that drove the men to mutiny but the general injustice that he showed in his favouritism to some and overly harsh punishment of others. Had Pigot remained more even-handed in his leadership, the mutiny might have been avoided.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> radius and {{the mass}} of a star determines its surface gravity.

5|$|The {{powerful}} {{winds of}} Typhoon Ioke caused extensive {{damage to the}} island's power grid, leaving most power lines to buildings and backup generators damaged. <b>The</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> winds and storm surge flooding damaged 70% of the buildings in the territory, many of which with moderate roof damage. All low-lying areas were described as being covered with sea water or sand, and the territory was left without running water. Communications were downed on the island, with satellite dishes and cables destroyed. Damage to the infrastructure was extensive, though repairable and less than expected. Damage on the island was estimated at $88million (2006USD).|$|E
5|$|After {{the storm}} {{moved into the}} western Atlantic, the Miami U.S. Weather Bureau issued storm {{warnings}} for the North Carolina coastline from Wilmington to Cape Hatteras; the region was warned to prepare for strong winds. The agency also issued a small craft advisory southward through Charleston, South Carolina. Offshore, the storm produced winds of up to 85mph (140km/h), as well as waves up to 35feet (10m) in height. <b>The</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> winds and rough waves drove a freighter ashore along Portsmouth Island in the Outer Banks, after the engine was damaged when water entered the fuel line. The 26person crew initially planned to evacuate, but they later decided {{to stay on the}} freighter as the U.S. Coast Guard were deployed to assist. The seas damaged a portion of the ship, but the entire crew was rescued without any injuries. The storm later brushed New England, bringing rain, fog, warmer temperatures, and gusty winds. The combination resulted in downed power poles and tree limbs, leaving 10,000houses without electricity.|$|E
