40|$|Identifying the {{properties}} of on-going events by the sound they produce is crucial for our interaction with the environment when visual information is not available. Here, we investigated the ability of listeners to esti- mate {{the size of an}} object (a ball) dropped on a plate with ecological listening conditions (balls were dropped in real time) and response methods (listeners estimate ball-size by drawing a disk). Previous studies had shown that listeners can veridically estimate the size of objects by the sound they produce, but it is yet unclear which acoustical index listeners use to produce their estimates. In particular, it is unclear whether lis- <b>teners</b> listen to amplitude (related to loudness) or frequency (related to the sound's brightness) domain cue to produce their estimates. In the current study, in order to understand which cue is used by the listener to recover the size of the object, we manipulated the sound source event {{in such a way that}} frequency and am- plitude cues provided contrasting size-information (balls were dropped from various heights). Results showed that listeners' estimations were accurate regardless of the experimental manipulations performed in the experiments. In addition, results suggest that listeners were likely integrating frequency and amplitude acoustical cues in order to produce their estimate and although these cues were often providing contrasting size-information...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{statistics}} {{are known to}} be important factors shaping our perceptual system. The visual and auditory systems have evolved to be effcient for processing natural images or speech. The com- mon characteristics between natural images and speech are that they are both highly structured, therefore having much redundancy. Our perceptual system may use redundancy reduction and sparse coding strategies to deal with complex stimuli every day. Both redundancy reduction and sparse coding theory emphasise the importance of high order statistics signals. This thesis includes psycho-acoustical experiments designed to inves- tigate how higher order statistics affect our speech perception. Sparse- ness can be defined by the fourth order statistics, kurtosis, and it is hypothesised that greater kurtosis should be reflected by better speech recognition performance in noise. Based on a corpus of speech mate- rial, kurtosis was found to be significantly correlated to the glimps- ing area of noisy speech, an established measure that predicts speech recognition. Kurtosis was also found to be a good predictor of speech recognition and an algorithm based on increasing kurtosis was also found to improve speech recognition score in noise. The listening experiment for the first time showed that higher order {{statistics are}} important for speech perception in noise. It is known the hearing impaired listeners have diffculty understand- ing speech in noise. Increasing kurtosis of noisy speech may be par- ticularly helpful for them to achieve better performance. Currently, neither hearing aids nor cochlear implants help hearing impaired users greatly in adverse listening enviroments, partly due to having a re- duced dynamic range of hearing. Thus there is an information bot- tleneck, whereby these devices must transform acoustical sounds with a large dynamic range into the smaller range of hearing impaired lis- <b>teners.</b> The limited dynamic range problem {{can be thought of as}} a communication channel with limited capacity. Information could be more effciently encoded for such a communication channel if redun- dant information could be reduced. For cochlear implant users, un- wanted channel interaction could also contribute lower speech recog- nition scores in noisy conditions. This thesis proposes a solution to these problems for cochlear im- plant users by reducing signal redundancy and making signals more sparse. A novel speech processing algorithm, SPARSE, was devel- oped and implemented. This algorithm aims to reduce redundant information and transform signals input into more sparse stimulation sequences. It is hypothesised that sparse firing patterns of neurons will be achieved, which should be more biological efficient based on sparse coding theory. Listening experiments were conducted with ten cochlear implant users who listened to speech signals in modulated and speech babble noises, either using the conventional coding strat- egy or the new SPARSE algorithm. Results showed that the SPARSE algorithm can help them to improve speech understanding in noise, particularly for those with low baseline performance. It is concluded that signal processing algorithms for cochlear implants, and possibly also for hearing aids, that increase signal sparseness may deliver ben- efits for speech recognition in noise. A patent based on the algorithm has been applied for. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

2500|$|Coral snakes in North America {{are most}} notable for their red, yellow/white, and black colored banding.

Before Cimabue, no beautiful rendering of human form was possible; and the rude or formal types of the Lombard and Byzantine, though they would serve in the tumult of the chase, or as the recognized symbols of creed, could not represent personal and domestic character. Faces with goggling eyes and rigid lips might be endured with ready help of imagination, for gods, angels, saints, or hunters--or for anybody else in scenes of recognized legend, but would not serve for pleasant portraiture of one's own self --or of the incidents of gentle, actual life. And even Cimabue did not venture to leave the sphere of conventionally reverenced dignity. He still painted--though beautifully--only the Madonna, and the St. Joseph, and the Christ. These he made living,--Florence asked no more: and [...] "Credette Cimabue nella pintura <b>tener</b> lo campo." ...|$|E

But it constantly happens (so constantly, {{that it may be}} stated as a political law having few exceptions), that what is unreasonably gathered is also unreasonably spent by the persons into whose hands it finally falls. Very frequently it is spent in war, or else in stupefying luxury, twice hurtful, both in being indulged by the rich and witnessed by the poor. So that the mal <b>tener</b> and mal dare are as correlative as complementary colours; and the circulation of wealth, which ought to be soft, steady, strong, far-sweeping, and full of warmth, like the Gulf Stream, being narrowed into an eddy, and concentrated on a point, changes into the alternate suction and surrender of Charybdis.

But {{there is}} one feeling that is always distinct; however jaded and languid we may be in all other pleasures, we are never languid in vanity, and we would still paint and carve for fame.

But at this instant the two noblest {{pictures}} in Venice are lying rolled up in outhouses, and the noblest portrait of Titian in existence is hung forty feet from the ground. We have absolutely no motive but vanity and the love of money--no others, as nations, than these, whatever we may have as individuals. And as the thirst of vanity thus increases, so the temptation to it. There was no fame of artists in these archaic days. Every year, every hour, saw someone rise to surpass what had been done before. And there was always better work to be done, but never any credit to be got by it. The artist lived in an atmosphere of perpetual, wholesome, inevitable eclipse. Do as well as you choose to-day,--make the whole Borgo dance with delight, they would dance to a better man's pipe to-morrow.

They could only hope to be remembered as links in an endless chain. For the weaker men it was no use even to put their name on their works. They did not. If they could not work for joy and for love, and take their part simply in the choir of human toil, they might throw up their tools. But now it is far otherwise--now, the best having been done--and for a couple of hundred years, the best of us being confessed to have come short of it, everybody thinks that he may be the great man once again, and this is certain, that whatever in art is done for display, is invariably wrong.|$|E
