5|$|Being There is {{the second}} studio album by the American {{alternative}} rock band Wilco, released on October 29, 1996 by Reprise Records. Despite its release as a double album, Being There was sold at a single album price {{as a result of}} a deal between lead singer Jeff Tweedy and the band's label Reprise Records. The album was an improvement for the band in both sales and critical reception, in contrast to their debut album A.M. (1995). Taking its name from the 1979 film of the same name, the self-produced album featured more surrealistic and introspective writing than on A.M.. This was due in part to several significant changes in Tweedy's life, including <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> first child. Musically, it juxtaposed the alternative country styles songs reminiscent of Uncle Tupelo with psychedelic, surreal songs. It was the only Wilco album with steel guitarist Bob Egan, and their last with multi-instrumentalist Max Johnston.|$|E

5|$|Crittenden's {{support of}} a new {{election}} was both popular and politically expedient. When the U.S. Senate term of Martin D.

Though he was {{the youngest member of}} the body, he served as the second-ever chairman of the newly created Committee on the Judiciary. He was {{also a member of the}} Committee on Naval Affairs. During his term, he introduced legislation to reimburse and indemnify persons who were fined under the 1798 Sedition Act. He found state politics more interesting, however, and this fact, coupled with increased financial responsibilities incurred by <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> third and fourth children, prompted his decision to resign his seat on March 3, 1819.|$|E
5|$|Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace is {{the sixth}} studio album by rock band Foo Fighters, {{released}} on September 25, 2007 by RCA Records.

It also marks the second time the band worked with producer Gil Norton, whom frontman Dave Grohl brought to fully explore the potential of his compositions and have a record that sounded different from their previous work.

5|$|Henry Hare (1635–1708) {{settled at}} the Lordship House, {{renaming}} it Bruce Castle {{in honour of}} the area's historic connection with the House of Bruce.

He also traveled back to the South, spending time in South Carolina and {{in his hometown of}} Richmond, Virginia, while reconnecting himself with the African-American musical history that had originally inspired him. Shortly after his son's birth and the release of his first live album Live at the Jazz Cafe (1998) through EMI Records, he began preparation for the recording of songs for Voodoo. In several interviews after its release, he cited his son's birth as an inspirational source and creative muse for him. A dedication to his son Michael and daughter Imani was included in the album's liner notes, which were co-written by D'Angelo and writer/musician Saul Williams. In a press video accompanying the release of Voodoo, D'Angelo suggested that he was attempting to create a new sound for him that was in transition.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not quite}} clear where Gaveston spent his time abroad; the {{conditions}} of his exile banned him from staying {{in any of the}} lands of the English king. This precluded both Aquitaine and Ireland, where he had spent his previous exiles. There is some evidence that he might have gone to France initially, but considering the French king's hostile attitude towards him, he is not likely to have stayed there long. Flanders is a much more likely candidate for Gaveston's third and final exile. This time his absence was even shorter than the second time, lasting no more than two months. Returning around Christmas 1311, he was reunited with the King early in 1312, probably at Knaresborough on 13 January. The reason for his quick return might have been <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> child, a daughter named Joan, around this time. On 18 January, Edward declared the judgement against Gaveston unlawful, and restored all lands to him.|$|E
5|$|Jesé {{has three}} sons, Jesé Jr. (born 2012), Neizan (born 2016), and Nyan (born 2017).

50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1904 he once again went to Switzerland, trying twice to commit suicide there, once by {{drowning}} himself and by jumping off a bridge, though both attempts failed, because he was, according to his own words, too weak.
