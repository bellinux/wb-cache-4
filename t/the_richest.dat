The VAT reform with consumption tax being endogenous increases capital accumulation and the utility of both <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> and <b>the</b> poor. The VAT reform with the labor income tax rate being endogenous increases capital accumulation; and it decreases the utility of <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> and increases <b>the</b> utility of the poor (increases the utility of both <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> and <b>the</b> poor) if <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> has a higher rate or the same rate of time preference (if <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> has a lower rate of time preference). The VAT reform, accompanied by a cut in transfers to the poor, has no effect on capital accumulation if <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> and <b>the</b> poor have the same rate of time preference; it decreases (increases) capital accumulation if <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> has a higher (lower) rate of time preference; and it increases the utility of <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> and decreases <b>the</b> utility of the poor. ...|$|R
