The published article is copyrighted by Society of American Foresters and can be found at: [URL] stand of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) severely affected by Armillaria root disease was treated with five different levels of sanitation by root removal to reduce root disease losses in the regenerating stand. Treatments included the following: (1) all trees pushed over <b>by</b> <b>machine,</b> maximum removal of roots <b>by</b> <b>machine</b> ripping, and visible remaining roots removed by hand; (2) all trees pushed over <b>by</b> <b>machine</b> and maximum removal of roots <b>by</b> <b>machine</b> ripping; (3) all trees pushed over <b>by</b> <b>machine</b> with no further removal of roots; (4) smaller trees pushed over <b>by</b> <b>machine</b> but large stumps left, otherwise maximum removal of roots <b>by</b> <b>machine</b> ripping; and (5) all trees felled and removed by skidding, area cleared of slash, sod scalped, and no removal of roots. After 35 years, we found that the more intense and thorough root-removal treatments were generally more effective in reducing the occurrence of Armillaria root disease. However, even the most intensive treatment (treatment 1), which experienced significantly less disease than most other treatments, had 23...|$|R

Plots were laid out in middle and south Sweden in 1983, some being observed annually until 1989.
