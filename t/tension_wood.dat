30|$|This study {{examined}} how boiling and drying treatments influenced various physical {{properties of the}} <b>tension</b> <b>wood</b> with gelatinous fibers (G-fibers) of a 29 -yearold Zelkova branch. By boiling treatment, <b>tension</b> <b>wood</b> with numerous G-fibers contracted considerably in the longitudinal direction and the longitudinal Young’s modulus decreased {{in spite of the}} water-saturated condition. The drying treatment caused green <b>tension</b> <b>wood</b> and boiled <b>tension</b> <b>wood</b> with numerous G-fibers to shrink longitudinally and increased their longitudinal Young’s moduli. These specific behaviors in <b>tension</b> <b>wood</b> were highly correlated with the proportion of G-fibers in a specimen and were probably caused by the microscopic behavior of cellulose microfibril (CMF) in the gelatinous layers (G-layers). The longitudinal shrinkage of <b>tension</b> <b>wood</b> due to drying suggests the existence of a hygro-sensible, noncrystalline region in the CMF, which is abundant in the G-layer. Furthermore, the noncrystalline region in the CMF softens during boiling treatment, resulting in the reduction of the longitudinal Young’s modulus in <b>tension</b> <b>wood.</b> The longitudinal contraction of <b>tension</b> <b>wood</b> with G-fibers by boiling might be caused by the tensile growth stress remaining in green G-layers. However, no changes were detected in the 004 d-spacing of cellulose crystal in <b>tension</b> <b>wood</b> from the boiling and drying treatments, regardless of the proportion of G-fibers.|$|E

30|$|Seedlings ofEucalyptus viminalis {{were grown}} for 50 days with their stems bent so <b>tension</b> <b>wood</b> would form. Every 10 days the lignin content, monomeric composition, and {{peroxidase}} {{activity in the}} <b>tension</b> <b>wood</b> were compared {{with those in the}} lower side (opposite wood) and in vertically grown controls. The lignin content in the developing <b>tension</b> <b>wood</b> started to decrease after 10 days of bending and kept decreasing for 50 days, whereas those in control plants and opposite wood remained almost unchanged. The yields of syringaldehyde from <b>tension</b> <b>wood</b> by nitrobenzene oxidation increased, and consequently the syringyl/ guaiacyl ratio of the lignin was higher in <b>tension</b> <b>wood</b> than in opposite wood and control plants. The peroxidase ionically bound to the cell walls (IPO) catalyzed oxidation of guaiacol and syringaldazine. The syringaldazineoxidizing activity of IPO from <b>tension</b> <b>wood</b> increased, whereas the activities of IPO from opposite wood and control plants did not show any marked change. In <b>tension</b> <b>wood</b> the increase in syringaldazine-oxidizing activity of IPO was consistent with an increase in the syringaldehyde yield. This suggests that IPO contributes to syringyl lignin deposition as other enzymes involved in the monolignol biosynthesis do in <b>tension</b> <b>wood</b> formation.|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out to measure the cutting force and the {{resultant}} machined surface quality for <b>tension</b> <b>wood</b> and normal wood of Rubberwood using a single saw tooth experimental set-up. Three different saw tooth geometries {{were used in the}} experiment, to establish the optimum saw tooth design for the sawing of <b>tension</b> <b>wood.</b> The results showed that the specific principal cutting force was lower for <b>tension</b> <b>wood</b> compared to normal wood, due to the less lignified cell walls of the <b>tension</b> <b>wood.</b> It appears that the lignin component in the cell wall provides the stiffness to the cell wall, which was lacking in the cell walls of <b>tension</b> <b>wood,</b> hence reducing the cutting forces significantly. Nevertheless, the overall power consumption during the machining of <b>tension</b> <b>wood</b> was markedly higher due to the presence of fuzzy grains on the machined surface of <b>tension</b> <b>wood,</b> which increased the frictional force acting on the cutting edges during the machining process. Further, it was found that saw tooth design No. 2 produced the optimal result, both from the economic and quality perspectives for the sawing of <b>tension</b> <b>wood.</b> Therefore, in order to optimize the sawing of <b>tension</b> <b>wood,</b> saw tooth with the highest rake and clearance angles is recommended as it required the least cutting force, while producing the best surface quality.

Many trees produced high longitudinal tensile stress all around their circumference. High longitudinal tensile stress was not systematically associated with the presence of gelatinous layer. The average magnitude of released longitudinal maturation strain was found negatively correlated to the growth rate. A methodology is proposed to ensure reliable evaluation of released maturation strain in both longitudinal and tangential directions. Tangential strain evaluated with this method was lower than previously reported. * Conclusion: The stress was always tensile along longitudinal direction and compressive along tangential direction, and their respective magnitude was positively correlated.

30|$|Mechanical bending {{treatment}} {{was employed to}} cause <b>tension</b> <b>wood</b> formation in the stem of the fast-growing yellow poplar. The <b>tension</b> <b>wood</b> induced by mechanical bending had many characteristic features of <b>tension</b> <b>wood,</b> i.e., eccentric growth toward <b>tension</b> <b>wood,</b> increased frequency of fiber cell types, vessels with reduced size, and reduced lignin content in the developed xylem. The significant reduction of the guaiacyl (G) and p-hydroxyphenyl (H) units of lignin in the <b>tension</b> <b>wood</b> was clearly visualized in samples that had been subjected to bending for 7 and 14 days when analyzed by lignin histochemical analysis using phloroglucinol-HCl. The syringyl (S) unit in the <b>tension</b> <b>wood</b> lignin was also significantly decreased in the developed xylem of the 14 -day bending treatment sample, as indicated by Mäule’s staining. Expression analysis of several representative genes in the lignin biosynthetic pathway clearly demonstrated that the overall phenylpropanoid pathway toward biosynthesis for both the lignin monomers and the flavonoids was greatly downregulated on bending treatment. In addition, the genes encoding laccases, which {{have been reported to}} be involved in the polymerization of monolignols to produce lignin macromolecules, were significantly downregulated in the <b>tension</b> <b>wood.</b> Despite the very limited sequence information for the genes/enzymes in the phenylpropanoid pathway in yellow poplar, histochemical staining and expression analysis using quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) successfully demonstrated the anatomical and chemical characteristics associated with mechanical bending-induced <b>tension</b> <b>wood</b> formation in the yellow poplar.|$|E
40|$|Genetic {{engineering}} {{of superior}} wood properties and exploiting natural genetic variation found within commercially important trees, such as Eucalyptus spp., promise to increase cellulose biomass production. It is therefore essential {{to understand the}} molecular genetics of wood formation. Digital Gene Expression (DGE) profiling is adept in not only assessing the expression level of genes transcriptome-wide, but also in characterising alternative splice forms of transcripts and identifying novel transcripts. <b>Tension</b> <b>wood</b> is a specialised type of wood which functions in the response to mechanical stress in trees and is formed on the upper side of a branch or a bent stem. The characteristics of <b>tension</b> <b>wood</b> differ from normal wood by increased cellulose and xyloglucan content and decreased lignin and xylan content. During <b>tension</b> <b>wood</b> formation, transcriptome-wide changes in the expression of genes involved in secondary cell wall formation underlie changes in cell wall composition. Most notably {{is an increase in}} fasciclin-like arabinogalactan protein (FLA) and xyloglucan endotransglucosylase (XTH) and a decrease in lignin biosynthesis gene expression. Differential expression patterns are shown by cellulose synthase (CesA) genes, which {{have been found to be}} either up- or down-regulated during <b>tension</b> <b>wood</b> formation. No previous study has profiled gene expression during early as well as late <b>tension</b> <b>wood</b> formation. The aim of this M. Sc study was to identify genes that are differentially expressed during early <b>tension</b> <b>wood</b> induction and late <b>tension</b> <b>wood</b> formation in the immature xylem tissues of Eucalyptus grandis x Eucalyptus urophylla hybrid trees. DGE profiling is a transcriptome-wide expression profiling technique based on ultra-high throughput second generation DNA sequencing technology. The processing, analysis and interpretation of DGE data has not yet been standardised. To address this problem, a case study was performed of DGE data mapping to seven well characterised Eucalyptus grandis CesA (EgCesA) genes. The DGE data processing guidelines developed based on this case study produced EgCesA expression profiles in normal wood that were comparable to the profiles of these genes determined with other technologies. A possible alternative splice variant occurring during <b>tension</b> <b>wood</b> formation was identified for the secondary cell wall gene EgCesA 3. However future work is needed for the validation of this observation. Early <b>tension</b> <b>wood</b> induction and late <b>tension</b> <b>wood</b> formation was investigated by sampling differentiating xylem from ramets of a Eucalyptus grandis x Eucalyptus urophylla clone induced to form <b>tension</b> <b>wood</b> for 6 hours, 24 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks and 6 months. Up to 2, 654 transcripts were found to be significantly differentially expressed during <b>tension</b> <b>wood</b> formation. FLA transcripts were the highest expressed transcripts and were, along with XTH genes, highly up-regulated in early and late <b>tension</b> <b>wood</b> formation. Genes differentially regulated during early <b>tension</b> <b>wood</b> formation reflected a general stress response and hormone signalling pathways. Late <b>tension</b> <b>wood</b> formation was marked by the differential regulation of secondary cell wall biosynthetic genes, which reflected the chemical composition of <b>tension</b> <b>wood.</b> Two secondary cell wall CesA genes were significantly up-regulated, while genes involved in lignin and xylan biosynthesis were significantly down-regulated. Observations suggest that the eucalypt trees used in this study formed <b>tension</b> <b>wood</b> to stabilise the bent stem, while apical dominance was transferred to new side branches which showed signs of extra secondary growth.

Soils were dominantly clayey with pH in the acidic range, low organic carbon content, and steady infiltration rates ranging between 2 and 36 mm/h.

We therefore investigated water fluxes induced by ice formation during freeze-thaw cycles in angiosperm tree stems using four complementary approaches: Microdendrometer, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), X-ray microtomography and Ultrasonic acoustic Emissions (UEs) analysis. When temperature dropped, ice nucleation occurred likely in cambial area inducing water redistribution within the stem toward the ice front.

At least five bands (19, 22, 37, 41, and 55 kDa) were specific in the differentiating tissue of <b>tension</b> <b>wood.</b> These proteins were bound to the cell wall, plasma membrane, or both by their electric charge; they were undetectable until 14 days after inclination. Mature <b>tension</b> <b>wood</b> was observed in the tissue at 14 days. Thus, all differentiating tissue at 14 days was produced after inclination. On the other hand, the differentiating zone at 7 days contained the same tissue, as in <b>tension</b> <b>wood</b> estimated by the vessel number and diameter during the early phase; and the tissue was indistinguishable from normal wood during the late phase. The proteins found here were related to the phenomenon occurring in the late stage of xylem differentiation.|$|E

The {{very low}} water potential at the ice–liquid interface is crucial {{as it may}} cause lysis of living cells as well as water fluxes and embolism in sap conduits, which impacts whole tree–water relations. We investigated water fluxes induced by ice formation during freeze–thaw cycles in Juglans regia L. stems using four non-invasive and complementary approaches: a microdendrometer, magnetic resonance imaging, X-ray microtomography, and ultrasonic acoustic emissions analysis. When the temperature dropped, ice nucleation occurred, probably in the cambium or pith areas, inducing high water potential gradients within the stem. The water was therefore redistributed within the stem toward the ice front. We could thus observe dehydration of the bark’s living cells leading to drastic shrinkage of this tissue, as well as high <b>tension</b> within <b>wood</b> conduits reaching the cavitation threshold in sap vessels. Ultrasonic emissions, which were strictly emitted only during freezing, indicated cavitation events (i. e. bubble formation) following ice formation in the xylem sap. However, embolism formation (i. e. bubble expansion) in stems was observed only on thawing via X-ray microtomography {{for the first time}} on the same sample. Ultrasonic emissions were detected during freezing and were not directly related to embolism formation. These results provide new insights into the complex process and dynamics of water movements and ice formation during freeze–thaw cycles in tree stems...|$|R
40|$|The paper shows {{results of}} {{analysis}} of influences of oscillating parameters of drying on measuring wood moisture {{content in the}} kiln, rate and quality of drying. For this analysis, we used a conventional drying cycle, a cycle with oscillating equilibrium moisture content (EMC), and a cycle with oscillating temperatures. A special software tool was created for managing the oscillations. It was shown that oscillations of EMC and temperatures result in cyclic changes in wood MC, {{but also in the}} additional inaccuracies of MC measurements in the kiln. The drying process of the cycle with oscillating EMC lasted somewhat shorter than the other two cycles. Drying quality was the same or better in the cycles with oscillations as compared to the conventionally dried cycle, and the smaller <b>tensions</b> in the <b>wood</b> confirmed the activation of the additional mechano-sorptive effect during cyclic changes of MC in surface layers.

40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia de Materiais Lenhocelulósicos - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaWettability {{phenomena}} {{is related}} to macroscopic manifestations of molecular interaction between liquids and solids interfaces. A better knowledge of these phenomena in wood is important to improve the capacity of interaction between wood and adhesives in applications involving gluing, because a good wettabilty is crucial for a good adhesion. The main objective of this work was to study the wettability of pine (Pinus Pinaster) and eucalypt (Eucalyptus Globulus), subjected to different treatments using urea-formaldehyde resins of different composition {{with the aim of}} improving bonding in the production of particleboard. Pine and eucalypt logs were collected at the wood-yard of a particleboard plant, including burned wood from forest fires, representing the major wood supply used in Portugal. Several wood samples were subjected to different treatments (over-drying, extraction with water and ageing under sunlight), {{similar to those of the}} industrial process. In a first approach, the surface <b>tension</b> of <b>wood</b> was determined using the acid-base theory and the influence of wood species and treatments on the total surface tension and Lifshitz-van der Waals (LW) and acid-base components was evaluated. Then, in order to compare the ability of three resin formulations for bonding wood of these species, measurements of contact angle of these resins and mechanical tests were carried out in fresh wood samples and in samples subjected to the treatments. The influence of several factors and levels on wettability and bond strength, were analysed using ANOVA: two species, sapwood/heartwood, burned/normal wood, three treatments and three commercial resins...|$|R
