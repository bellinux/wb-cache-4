5|$|John Barry, who {{had worked}} on <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>five</b> films, was {{unavailable}} during production. Broccoli and Saltzman instead asked Paul McCartney to write the theme song.

Chris Brown had an additional 19carries for 74yards and two touchdowns as Patrick's backup.

5|$|Manchester City's {{fortunes}} declined {{during the}} 1980s and 1990s. For a single season, 1998–99, the club fell {{as far as}} English football's third tier. The club did not qualify for European competition in this period. In ordinary circumstances, the club's fifth-placed finish in 1991 and 1992 would have granted a UEFA Cup place. However, English clubs had recently returned from a ban issued after the Heysel Stadium disaster. As the UEFA coefficient that determines the number of places per country is based upon performances in European competition over <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>five</b> years, England had a reduced allocation until 1995.|$|E

A major part of Hong Kong's Cantonese-speaking majority originated from the neighbouring Guangdong province, from where many fled during the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Chinese Civil War, and the communist rule in China.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the first}} bowl of the 2012-13 College Football Bowl season. Prior to 2012, the teams had not met since 1941 despite their close proximity. In 1941, Arizona beat Nevada 26–7.

Arizona, who had {{appeared}} in a bowl game in four of <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>five</b> seasons, made the Pac-12's first appearance in the New Mexico Bowl.

5|$|United States {{officials}} had only estimates of its enemy's capabilities; intelligence collection agencies often conflicted with each other. Thanks to {{improvements to the}} trail system (including opening new routes that would connect to the Sihanouk Trail in Cambodia), the amount of supplies transported during 1965 almost equaled the combined total for <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>five</b> years. During the year interdiction of the system {{had become one of}} the top American priorities, but operations against it were complicated by the limited forces available at the time and Laos's ostensible neutrality.|$|E
5|$|VHEMT {{promotes}} a more extreme ideology than Population Action International, {{a group that}} argues humanity should reduce—but not eliminate—its population {{to care for the}} Earth. However, the VHEMT platform is more moderate and serious than the Church of Euthanasia, which advocates population reduction by suicide and cannibalism. The 1995 survey found that 36% considered themselves members of Earth First! or had donated to the group in <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>five</b> years.|$|E
5|$|Capital to {{fund the}} scheme had been raised {{separately}} by the Wakefield and Leeds committees. A complicated restructuring of the finances in 1721 fixed the nominal capital at £26,700. Regular dividends at 7 per cent were paid to the shareholders from 1718, and the navigation was leased to various groups, who {{would be responsible for}} collection of tolls and repairs. The lease rose from £800 in 1704 to £2,600 in 1729, when receipts from each of <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>five</b> years had averaged £6,016. The early trade consisted mainly of woollen goods from Leeds, Wakefield, Halifax and Bradford, with wool and corn from Lincolnshire and East Anglia travelling in the opposite direction. By the 1720s there were also significant quantities of coal.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the release}} of the {{previous}} Bond film, Licence to Kill, in July 1989, pre-production work for the third James Bond film starring Timothy Dalton, fulfilling his three-film contract, began in May 1990. A poster for the then-upcoming movie was even featured on the Carlton Hotel during the 1990 Cannes Film Festival. In August, The Sunday Times reported that producer Albert R. Broccoli had parted company with writer Richard Maibaum, who had worked on the scripts of all but three Bond films so far, and director John Glen, responsible for <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>five</b> instalments of the series. Broccoli listed among the possible directors John Landis, Ted Kotcheff, and John Byrum. Broccoli's stepson Michael G. Wilson contributed a script, and Wiseguy co-producer Alfonse Ruggiero Jr. was hired to rewrite. Production was set to start in 1990 in Hong Kong for a release in late 1991.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{win over}} Leicester City, Burnley were drawn against Queens Park Rangers at Turf Moor in the Second Round. Despite a good {{performance}} by their opponents, Burnley progressed to the Third Round with a 4–2 win, in which Bob Kelly struck twice {{in the first half}} and Joe Anderson scored either side of half time. In the Third Round, Burnley were handed an away tie at Hull City, who at the time were struggling in the Football League Second Division and had won only two matches in <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>five</b> months. Despite being without first-team regulars George Halley and Joe Anderson through injury, Burnley were expected to win comfortably, not having lost since 4September 1920. Hull City played above all expectations and Burnley suffered a 0–3 defeat after being 0–1 behind at half time.|$|E
5|$|R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. Records in 1996 for a {{reported}} $80million (a figure the band constantly asserted originated with the media), {{rumored to be}} the largest recording contract in history at that point. The group's 1996 album New Adventures in Hi-Fi debuted at number two in the US and number one in the UK. The five million copies of the album sold were a reversal of the group's commercial fortunes of <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>five</b> years. Time writer Christopher John Farley argued that the lesser sales of the album were due to the declining commercial power of alternative rock as a whole. That same year, R.E.M. parted ways with manager Jefferson Holt, allegedly due to sexual harassment charges levied against him {{by a member of the}} band's home office in Athens. The group's lawyer Bertis Downs assumed managerial duties.|$|E

The Providence roster featured three former Hershey forwards: Chris Bourque, Christian Hanson and Graham Mink. Defenseman Patrick McNeill did not play for Hershey during the playoff series due to veteran roster limit issues.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} Marie {{appeared in}} the original Rocky; she was portrayed by Jodi Letizia. For the final film, Marie is portrayed by Geraldine Hughes. (Although Letizia did reprise the role for Rocky V, the sole scene in which she appeared was deleted. In it, Marie was homeless {{on the streets of}} Philadelphia.) Another recognizable character who appeared in <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>five</b> films, sportscaster Stu Nahan, provided the commentary for the computer-generated fight between Dixon and Balboa. Nahan was part of the ringside commentary team during all the bouts in the first three films and the Apollo Creed/Ivan Drago fight in Rocky IV. He was diagnosed with lymphoma during the Rocky Balboa filming, though, and died on December 26, 2007. Finally, Pedro Lovell, who portrayed Spider Rico in the original film, returns to the role in Rocky Balboa as a guest and later employee at Rocky's restaurant.|$|E
5|$|Great spotted kiwis are monogamous, with pairings {{sometimes}} lasting twenty years. Nests {{are made}} in burrows. The breeding season begins in June and ends in March, as this is when food is plentiful. Males reach sexual maturity at 18months in captivity, while females are able to lay eggs after three years. In the wild, sexual maturity for both sexes is between ages three and five. Great spotted kiwi males chase females around until the females either run off or mate. The pair mates about {{two to three times}} during peak activity. The gestation period is about a month. Females do not eat during this period, as the eggs will take up a fourth of a kiwi's body mass. The yolk takes up 65% of the egg. In most bird eggs, the yolk takes up about 35 to 40% of the egg. This makes the kiwi egg the largest in proportion to the body. Females must rely on fat stored from <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>five</b> months to survive. Because of the large size of the egg, gestation is uncomfortable for the female, and they do not move much. To relieve the pain, females soak themselves in water when they come out of the burrows by dipping their abdomens into puddles. The egg-laying season is between August and January.|$|E
