40|$|The {{way that}} we build the {{foundations}} of our intellectual capital in management has changed. One example is the steady move in management research {{from the use of}} traditional paper-based <b>survey</b> <b>questionnaires</b> to online technology-based formats. This paper considers this shift, particularly focusing {{on the question of whether}} the advantages of online <b>survey</b> <b>questionnaires</b> outweigh their potential problems. The historical use of paper-based <b>survey</b> <b>questionnaires</b> has produced a large body of literature on both the advantages and disadvantages in their use, which are reviewed here alongside those of online <b>survey</b> <b>questionnaires.</b> In addition, welI-tested methods are available for increasing survey response rates in paper format, and these should not be thrown out in the quest to utilise online survey methodology. Rather, researchers should aim to exploit the potential benefits of online technologies and increase response rate by thoughtfully combining traditional and new methods. This paper argues for further discussion and research attention on electronic methods of data collection to ensure potential cost savings are not outweighed by either financial or participation costs involved in online <b>survey</b> <b>questionnaire</b> design. <br /...|$|R
