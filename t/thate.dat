In the 20th century notable {{practitioners}} included Ajahn <b>Thate,</b> Ajahn Maha Bua and Ajahn Chah. It was later spread globally by Ajahn Mun's students including Ajahn <b>Thate,</b> Ajahn Maha Bua and Ajahn Chah and several Western disciples, among whom {{the most senior}} is Luang Por Ajahn Sumedho.|$|E
25|$|With {{the passing}} of Ajaan <b>Thate</b> in 1994, Ajaan Maha Bua was {{designated}} the new Ajaan Yai.|$|E
25|$|The Ajahn <b>Thate</b> became widely {{renowned for}} his humility and the {{development}} of his consciousness through Buddhist meditation not just through all sections of society in Thailand but internationally, particularly as a result of international speaking and meditation practise tours to Singapore, Indonesia and Australia. In addition to his large following of disciples in Thailand, Ajaan <b>Thate</b> trained many western disciples in meditation. He wrote a profound short book on the practise of meditation.|$|E

Como prática social, destaca-se, nas cartas, sua natureza comunicativa. Quem escreve? Para quem ? O quê? Em que época? Como? O {{material}} analisado é o conjunto de duzentas e vinte e duas cartas escritas, trocadas entre duas adolescentes, entre 1990 e 1996. Na leitura do material destacam-se: o objeto – carta - nas suas cores, tons, nuances, nas cerimônias e rituais epistolares (Dauphin, 1995); os procedimentos a que as correspondentes recorriam, as maneiras como se enlaçavam enquanto autora-locutora e destinatária leitora; os assuntos tratados quando puseram em evidência a vivência escolar; e os modos como compunham sua comunicação estreitando laços pela interlocução. O estudo do enunciado (Bakhtin, 1997), como unidade real da comunicação, trouxe alguma luz para compreender esse enlaçamento pela linguagem e nela uma relação (de amizade) que se constrói. Definir como objeto de estudo, o ato de escrever, possibilitou uma aproximação do sujeito da escrita, de cartas. Abstract: Conceiving {{writing as}} an object to be learned and apprehended and in this process forwarding to a subject condition, or non-subject (Certeau, 1990) insert ting it in a language conception that it is production, supposing interlocutors, this research proposes a reflexion on writhing letters as a social and cultural practice and, in it, the predominant role of the interlocutors. As a social-cultural practice is detached, in the letters, its communicative nature. Who does it write? To whom? What? When? How? The material analised {{is a set of}} two hundred and twenty two letters written, exchanged between two teenagers from 1990 to 1996. By reading the material, it may be detached the letter-object in its colors, chromas, hues, in the ceremonies and epistolaries rituals (Dauphin et al, 1995); the procedures that they used to run over; the manners they interlaced as authoe-speaker and addresser-reader; the subjects <b>thated</b> when placed in evidence the lining at school; and the maner they arrange their communication tighing chains throughout the dialogue. The study of the announcement (Bakhtin, 1992) as a real entity of communication brought sonce light to understand this enlacement through language, and a relationship (friendship) in it that is self constructed. Defining the act of writing as a study object, made it possible an approximation of the subject to the writing, of letters...|$|R

He was a first generation student of the Thai Forest Tradition and a disciple of Ajahn Mun, {{one of the founding}} teachers of the lineage. Following the death of Ajahn Mun in 1949, he was considered to be the Ajahn Yai, or the head of the Thai Forest Tradition lineage until his death in 1994.|$|E

25|$|Maja e <b>Thatë</b> has a well-distinguished {{peak and}} {{represents}} {{a tourist attraction}} for nature and mountain lovers, mountaineers and hikers in general. Apart for the mountain’s aesthetic values, three natural monuments are located in its southern vicinity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thate</b> was {{a disciple}} {{of the very}} {{respected}} Forest Monk teachers Ajahn Sao and Ajahn Mun Bhuridatta. One of his fellow disciples {{at that time was}} the Ajahn Chah. Another fellow disciple who remained a lifelong friend was Ajahn Maha Bua.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thate</b> came {{to dwell}} and meditate {{in the forest}} near what is now Wat Hin Makpeng in 1964. There, as well as {{constructing}} kutirs (or sleeping quarters) and temples for the monks, he assisted with funding local schools, hospitals and sewerage treatment works.|$|E
25|$|The actual {{cremation}} {{took place}} {{later that night}} with a full moon shining down on the crematorium (with traditional Thai tiered-roofs), lake and fountain, specially built for the occasion. These remain as a landmark and memorial to Venerable Ajahn <b>Thate</b> when devotees come to practice Dhamma and remember his example.|$|E
25|$|When all was ready, HM the King flew in by {{helicopter}} officially {{to lead the}} making of offerings and light the cremation fire.

Her father was a European-American man named Felker, who {{abandoned}} the family while Zitkala-Ša was very young.|$|E
25|$|The next morning, {{when the}} fire was cooled, the bones and ashes of Venerable Ajahn <b>Thate</b> were reverently removed and safeguarded as relics.

25|$|In {{the late}} 1930s Tisso Uan {{formally}} recognized the Kammatthana monks as a faction. However, even after Ajaan Mun died in 1949, Tisso Uan continued {{to insist that}} Ajaan Mun had never been qualified to teach because he hadn't graduated from the government's formal Pali studies courses. With the passing of Ajaan Mun, Ajaan <b>Thate</b> Desaransi was designated the de-facto head of the Forest Tradition (Thai: Ajaan Yai).|$|E
25|$|Anglo-Saxon barrow burials {{started in}} the late 6th century and {{continued}} into the early 8th century. Prehistoric barrows, in particular, {{have been seen as}} physical expressions of land claims and links to the ancestors, and John Shephard has extended this interpretation to Anglo-Saxon tumuli. Eva <b>Thäte</b> has emphasised the continental origins of monument reuse in post-Roman England, Howard Williams has suggested that the main purpose of this custom was to give sense to a landscape that the immigrants did not find empty.|$|E
25|$|On 3 July 1798 Vsevolod was at Arkhangel’sk, {{serving as}} {{flagship}} for Vice-Adm. <b>Thate,</b> who commanded the 2nd Division of the Imperial Russian Navy.

She then served in the Baltic before undergoing repairs in 1804. In September 1805 she transported troops to Pomerania.|$|E
25|$|The {{influence}} of Ajahn <b>Thate</b> {{can be seen}} in Buddhist centres outside Thailand that revere the Thai Forest Tradition such as those in the United States (Thanissaro Bhikkhu, the community of Abhayagiri), Australia (Ajahn Brahm, Bodhinyana Monastery, Bodhivana Monastery), United Kingdom Amaravati Buddhist Monastery and Chithurst Buddhist Monastery) and Italy with the monastery of Santacittarama. These contemplative study centres, based on models such as Ajahn Thate's Wat Hin Maak Peng, are part of a Buddhist tradition that stretches back to the meditative university of Nalanda and Vikramashila in Northern India.|$|E
25|$|The {{cremation}} of Venerable Ajahn <b>Thate</b> {{took place}} on 8 January 1996, a day of bright sunshine. People from all over Thailand — led by HM the King Bhumibol Adulyadej and the royal family — came to pay their final respects. Each region where the Venerable Ajahn had stayed was represented — even from overseas. It is estimated that there were ten thousand monks present and many {{hundreds of thousands of}} lay people. The temporary car park was filled with up to thirty thousand vehicles, including many small and large buses from all parts of Thailand. There were free food stalls and refreshments. A half a million memorial books of the Venerable Ajahn Thate's teachings were distributed free to those present.|$|E
