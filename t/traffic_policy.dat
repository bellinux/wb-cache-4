Why is this? Using ordinary least squares regression and standard deviation, I demonstrate that Estonia has a poor anti-human <b>trafficking</b> <b>policy</b> compliance record in part because of discrimination against its sizeable Russian minority population. This has implications for security in the region, and the effect of discrimination based on ethnic background on anti-human <b>trafficking</b> <b>policy</b> compliance with international norms should be further researched on a universal basis...|$|R

State-level longitudinal data from 1990 to 2005 are analyzed to determine how various alcohol and <b>traffic</b> <b>policies</b> impact motorcycle safety and whether there are differential effects by type of injury. The results consistently show that universal helmet laws have the most significant effect on both non-fatal and fatal injuries.

40|$|Human {{trafficking}} is {{a complex}} global crime that exploits women, men and children. Due to {{the seriousness of the}} crime, Malaysia enacted the Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Smuggling of Migrants Act in 2007. Despite considering human trafficking to be a priority area for action through the enactment of the 2007 Act, Malaysia is still struggling in translating the intent of the policy into actual implementation. Hence, the study attempts to provide an understanding of human trafficking in Malaysia through the policy implementation lens. It analyses how human <b>trafficking</b> <b>policy</b> is being translated by bureaucratic implementers into action. The study adopts a combination of qualitative research methods – semi-structured individual and focus group interviews, field observations and written documents – to illustrate human <b>trafficking</b> <b>policy</b> implementation in Malaysia. The target population of the study is government bureaucrats who are involved in implementing human <b>trafficking</b> <b>policy</b> in Malaysia. For the study, 15 government bureaucrats were interviewed regarding their experience on human <b>trafficking</b> <b>policy</b> implementation. To provide multiple perspectives to the study, it also incorporates non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and trafficked victims as participants. Six NGO representatives and five male trafficked victims were interviewed. Three focus group interviews based on different categories of victims were also conducted, which consist of 49 female trafficked victims at selected shelter homes. There is a dearth of knowledge on human trafficking in Malaysia particularly on policy implementation. Hence, this study contributes to the body of knowledge on human trafficking and the body of work on implementation research. Using the policy implementation lens, the study explores human trafficking phenomenon in Malaysia through four theoretical underpinnings: theory of bureaucracy, implementation study, iv inter-organisational coordination and street-level bureaucracy. The 2007 Act becomes the country‟s primary policy that provides for the offence of trafficking in persons, the victims‟ protection and support, and the establishment of Council for Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Smuggling of Migrants (MAPO). To ensure effective implementation of the legal mechanisms outlined in the 2007 Act, the government formulated the National Action Plan against Trafficking in Persons (2010 - 2015) as a guideline to the national initiative in combating human trafficking. The empirical study identifies seven emerging themes that influence the implementation process of translating the policy intent into actual practice: incomprehensive coordination; incompatible resources; criminal approach; critical information flows; hierarchical control; low discretion; and paradigm shift imperative. These themes emerge through the analysis of research findings {{against the backdrop of the}} theoretical underpinnings and past studies. This study indicates the need to address these factors that critically influence human <b>trafficking</b> <b>policy</b> implementation in Malaysia. Understanding the complexity of human <b>trafficking</b> <b>policy</b> implementation entails the development of pragmatic recommendations towards abating the crime...|$|R

50|$|The {{issue of}} passive {{solicitation}} caused particular concern since {{it could mean}} that any woman could be arrested for the way she dressed, and it was particularly hard to define. The judiciary were equally unhappy with evidence that solely consisted of police testimony and were reluctant to convict.It was suggested that concern for victims for trafficking was hardly consistent with punishing them, and that prostitution had become conflated with <b>trafficking.</b> The <b>trafficking</b> <b>policy</b> seemed more aimed at the porousness of borders than at actual criminals, while migrant sex workers appeared to be particularly discriminated against, since they were simultaneously 'rescued' and deported without in any way addressing their vulnerability. Calls for aiming <b>trafficking</b> <b>policy</b> at traffickers rather than sex workers came from the Senate Law Commission, the Delegations for Women's Rights in the Senate and National Assembly, {{as well as from}} the opposition.|$|R

40|$|Child {{trafficking}} is a {{term used}} to define situations where children are forced, coerced or tricked to migrate {{for the purpose of}} their future exploitation. The issue of child trafficking is a well established UK policy concern initially emerging in the seventeenth century. The issue re-appeared {{in the late nineteenth century}} influenced by the social purity movement. This generated an infamous media exposé which led to parliamentary debates and legislative changes. Child trafficking resurfaced as a UK policy concern periodically in the twentieth century as children were once again forced to migrate. At the start of the twenty-first century child trafficking is back on the UK national policy agenda following pressure exerted by international anti-trafficking networks and Non Government Organisations. This study examines the social construction of risk in current and historical child <b>trafficking</b> UK <b>policy</b> discourses. Interviews with key informants in the ports safeguarding sector are discussed, together with an analysis of policy documents and primary historical sources. The construction of risk in these child trafficking discourses appear in a specific format which is explained by drawing on the conceptual lens of melodramatic tactics. This analysis reveals how narratives of child trafficking tend to have a stereotypical tragic child victim, who is forcibly separated from their family, and in need of protection from dangerous criminals who aim to deceive and exploit them. The employment of these melodramatic tactics is a central feature of current UK child <b>trafficking</b> <b>policy</b> discourses. Research studies which situate migrant children as competent social actors illuminate accounts of triumph, and these contrast with the outrage-driven protest drama which has current and enduring appeal in UK child <b>trafficking</b> <b>policy</b> discourses. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of current UK child <b>trafficking</b> <b>policy</b> and recommendations about future research with children on the move are also proposed...|$|R

The discussion focused on <b>traffic</b> <b>policy</b> and environmental questions rather than on safety.
