30|$|The {{mechanism}} of splitting of timber loaded parallel to grain {{is not clear}} {{and it is difficult}} <b>to</b> evaluate the <b>splitting</b> strength. In this research, splitting tests on Japanese cedar and Douglas fir were conducted <b>to</b> clarify <b>splitting</b> strength. A monotonic tensile force was applied to a drift-pinned joint with steel side plates and splitting failure originated from the pin hole. In order <b>to</b> evaluate the <b>splitting</b> strength, specimens with various parameters, i.e., diameter of drift pin, end margin, edge margin and thickness were used. All parameters affected the splitting strength, but particularly, end margin and thickness also affected the failure mode. As the end margin lengthened, the failure mode was transferred from shear <b>to</b> <b>splitting.</b> On the other hand, as thickness increased, the drift pin bent more at splitting. This bending of the drift pin caused a lag of bearing stress to timber, and the failure mode was transferred from full width <b>splitting</b> <b>to</b> partial width <b>splitting.</b> The splitting strength under various conditions could be evaluated by consideration of the difference in failure modes.|$|R
