5|$|Sirenia, {{commonly}} sirenians, {{are also}} referred to by the common name sirens, deriving from the sirens of Greek mythology. <b>This</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> a legend about their discovery, involving lonely sailors mistaking them for mermaids. Seekoei (sea cow) is also the name for a hippopotamus in Afrikaans.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria {{affecting}} {{the water quality}} mainly consist {{of different types of}} fecal coliforms, {{with a high level of}} E. coli bacteria. <b>This</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> pet waste, fertilizer, manure, and other organic pollutants that are washed into the creek, raising the average bacteria level 34percent higher than levels declared safe under California law. This in turn affects recreation at popular Aliso Creek Beach at the creek's mouth, violating state swimming standards 99percent of the time, especially during storm events, as beachgoers are warned to avoid the creek for 72hours (3days) after a major storm event.|$|E
5|$|Food waste puts a large {{burden on}} the {{finances}} of each household and local councils in the UK; wasted food is estimated to cost each British household £250–£400 per year, accumulating to £15,000–£24,000 over a lifetime. <b>This</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> the total purchasing cost of the food against what is thrown away uneaten. Additionally, households pay for the collection and disposal of food waste by their local council {{in the form of}} council tax. For councils, the cost of food waste comes from its collection and disposal {{as a part of the}} waste stream; this is especially an issue for councils that run separate food waste collections.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{his absence}} from Constantinople {{at the time}} of Phocas's takeover, and because he {{retained}} a large measure of support within the soldiery, Priscus {{was the only one of}} Maurice's senior generals who was retained by the new regime, whereas Comentiolus and Peter were executed and Philippicus was banished to a monastery. A possible explanation for <b>this</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> the later historian Paul the Deacon, who records, possibly based on early 7th-century sources, that Phocas had once served as an equerry under Priscus. At any rate, Priscus was soon counted among the main supporters of the new regime. In the winter of 602/603, he was made comes excubitorum, commander of the imperial bodyguard. In 606 or 607, he also married Phocas's daughter, Domentzia, becoming the effective heir-apparent to the sonless ruler. In the games celebrated at the Hippodrome to honor the event, however, Phocas reacted violently when he saw portraits of Priscus and Domentzia carried alongside his by the citizens. From this moment on, the chroniclers report, Priscus turned against Phocas.|$|E
5|$|The poem also {{contains}} many of Southey's {{views on the}} Catholic Church and how it influenced his political views. Part of <b>this</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> Southey's trip to Lisbon and Madrid in 1795 where he was exposed to what he believed as Catholic superstition. He believed that {{the church and the}} Catholic leaders kept the people ignorant, and he believed that the Muslims that were cast out of Spain were more tolerant. Many of these ideas are repeated in a speech within the work by Henry V, and the character attributes ignorance and vice to oppression. Southey believed {{that the only way to}} escape from these problems was for people to believe they were part of one universal family. His enemies later described Southey's as holding Jacobin belief and claimed he supported the extremism of Robbespierre, when his sympathies laid to a larger extent with the Girondins that were replaced by the Jacobins. However, the poem is still subversive since it described a French patriot fighting against the English that parallels the strife during Southey's time.|$|E
5|$|This {{model has}} Siletzia forming on the {{continental}} margin along {{what is now}} the Olympic-Wallowa Lineament (OWL; a zone of topographical features of unknown age and tectonic significance), with the southern end of Siletzia and the Klamath Mountains (joined to Siletzia) near the Idaho Batholith in central Idaho. Further evidence for <b>this</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> the sand of the Tyee Formation that overlie the Roseburg Formation. Not only does this sand have the same isotopic composition of rock in the Idaho Batholith (and of sand now coursing down the Snake and Columbia Rivers), but it appears to have not been transported very far from its source. This implies that the Tyee Formation was much closer to the Idaho Batholith when it was deposited, and subsequently rotated away. Geodetic surveys show that the region continues to rotate, likely as a result of extension of the Basin and Range Province and asthenospheric flow around the southern edge of the subducting Juan de Fuca plate.|$|E

25|$|In modern {{regional}} English dialects {{that use}} thou or some variant, {{such as in}} Yorkshire, it often takes the third person form of the verb -s. <b>This</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> a merging of Early Modern English second person singular ending -st and third person singular ending -s into -s (the latter a southern variation of -þ (-th)).|$|E
25|$|Sometimes a {{representation}} like Un*x, *NIX, or *N?X {{is used to}} indicate all operating systems similar to Unix. <b>This</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> {{the use of the}} asterisk (*) and the question mark characters as wildcard indicators in many utilities. This notation is also used to describe other Unix-like systems that have not met the requirements for UNIX branding from the Open Group.|$|E
25|$|Disturbance of the dopaminergic {{system in}} {{the central nervous system}} has also been {{suggested}} {{to be involved in the}} etiology of bruxism. Evidence for <b>this</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> observations of the modifying effect of medications which alter dopamine release on bruxing activity, such as levodopa, amphetamines or nicotine. Nicotine stimulates release of dopamine, which is postulated to explain why bruxism is twice as common in smokers compared to non-smokers.|$|E

It is facilitated by a Board of Trustees which appropriates funds for various programs and scholarships administered by the Grand Council. The money for <b>this</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> member dues, pledges, and donations. The Foundation is immensely important to the growth and maintenance of the Fraternity. Some of the programs it funds are the Leadership School, Undergraduate Scholarships, the Grand Chapter website, and Regional Conclaves.|$|E
25|$|In December 2012 the Corporation of the City of London acquiesed {{to one of}} the Occupy London demands, {{releasing}} {{information about}} a previously secret bank account called City's Cash. This fund had existed for hundreds of years and proved to contain more than £1.319bn. With an income of £145m per annum, 29% of <b>this</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> school fees, with a further eight per cent coming from rents and nine per cent coming from grants, reimbursements and contributions. However the largest source of revenue was 52 per cent from investments.|$|E
25|$|In the {{dopamine}} {{hypothesis of}} schizophrenia, schizophrenia was hypothesised {{to be caused}} by disturbed dopamine neurotransmission. Dopamine is a monoamine neurotransmitter which is involved in other diseases, such as Parkinson's disease. There is evidence for increased activity of the mesolimbic pathway, a dopaminergic pathway, in schizophrenia patients. <b>This</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> the discovery of increased L-DOPA decarboxylase levels in the brains of these patients. L-DOPA decarboxylase is an enzyme which converts L-DOPA to dopamine by removing a carboxyl group. Animal models were first produced for schizophrenia by altering the dopaminergic system using drugs.|$|E

25|$|Costa Rica {{is divided}} into three major {{drainage}} basins encompassing 34 watersheds with numerous rivers and tributaries, one major lake used for hydroelectric generation, and two major aquifers that serve to store 90% of the municipal, industrial, and agricultural water supply needs of Costa Rica. Agriculture is the largest water user demanding around 53% of total supplies while the sector contributes 6.5% to the Costa Rica GDP. About a fifth of land under cultivation is being irrigated by surface water. Hydroelectric power generation makes up a significant portion of electricity usage in Costa Rica and much of <b>this</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> the Arenal dam.|$|E
25|$|Tohru {{describes}} herself as an excellent artist who loves cooking and cleaning. In the original Japanese, Tohru habitually speaks formally (see Honorific speech in Japanese), but not always correctly. She picked up this habit from her dead father, Katsuya, after he {{died when she was}} three, as a way of replacing him in her mother's eyes and from her father's family's statements that she was probably the daughter of a man her mother had an affair with. Tohru tends to be especially concerned for people with minor illnesses. <b>This</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> the circumstances of her father's death, when Katsuya was originally diagnosed with a fever but eventually died of pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|A $400 million {{brand new}} KrisWorld {{entertainment}} system was unveiled in 2012. <b>This</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> a major deal with Panasonic Avionics, who {{will provide the}} latest Panasonic eX3 systems.
