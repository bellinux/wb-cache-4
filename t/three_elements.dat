5|$|As {{tetravalent}} transition metals, all <b>three</b> <b>elements</b> form various inorganic compounds, {{generally in}} the oxidation state of +4. For {{the first three}} metals, {{it has been shown}} that they are resistant to concentrated alkalis, but halogens react with them to form tetrahalides. At higher temperatures, all three metals react with oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, boron, sulfur, and silicon. Because of the lanthanide contraction of the elements in the fifth period, zirconium and hafnium have nearly identical ionic radii. The ionic radius of Zr4+ is 79picometers and that of Hf4+ is 78pm.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 27 November, three regiments from the 80th Division {{attacked}} the northern hills and the inlets, completely surprising the defenders.

5|$|Protactinium is an {{actinide}} {{which is}} positioned in {{the periodic table}} {{to the left of}} uranium and to the right of thorium, and many of its physical properties are intermediate between those two actinides. So, protactinium is more dense and rigid than thorium but is lighter than uranium, and its melting point is lower than that of thorium and higher than that of uranium. The thermal expansion, electrical and thermal conductivities of these <b>three</b> <b>elements</b> are comparable and are typical of post-transition metals. The estimated shear modulus of protactinium {{is similar to that of}} titanium. Protactinium is a metal with silvery-gray luster that is preserved for some time in air. Protactinium easily reacts with oxygen, water vapor and acids, but not with alkalis.|$|E

5|$|Unbiunium has not {{yet been}} synthesised. Nevertheless, because it is only <b>three</b> <b>elements</b> away from the {{heaviest}} known element, oganesson (element 118), its synthesis may come in the near future; it is expected {{to be one of the}} last few reachable elements with current technology, and the limit may be anywhere between element 120 and 124. It will also likely be far more difficult to synthesise than the elements known so far up to 118, and still more difficult than elements 119 and 120. The team at RIKEN in Japan has plans to attempt the synthesis of element 121 in the future after its attempts on elements 119 and 120.|$|E
5|$|After hydrogen, helium is {{the second}} lightest and second most {{abundant}} element in the observable universe, being present at about 24% of the total elemental mass, {{which is more than}} 12 times the mass of all the heavier elements combined. Its abundance is similar to this figure in the Sun and in Jupiter. This is due to the very high nuclear binding energy (per nucleon) of helium-4 with respect to the next <b>three</b> <b>elements</b> after helium. This helium-4 binding energy also accounts for why it is a product of both nuclear fusion and radioactive decay. Most helium in the universe is helium-4, the vast majority of which was formed during the Big Bang. Large amounts of new helium are being created by nuclear fusion of hydrogen in stars.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the defeat}} in America, the 64th {{remained}} in Jamaica for two years, returning to England in 1783. Four {{years later the}} regiment was stationed in Ireland, before sailing once more for the West Indies in 1793 at {{the outbreak of the}} Napoleonic Wars. At the end of the Seven Years' War both Martinique and Guadeloupe had been returned to France {{under the terms of the}} Treaty of Paris. From Barbados the 64th Foot took part in the invasion of Martinique in early 1794. As before the flank companies were detached from the rest of the regiment but all <b>three</b> <b>elements</b> were involved in the actions in Martinique. This short but successful campaign earned the regiment its second battle honour, Martinique 1794—although as with the earlier Guadeloupe honour, it was not actually awarded until 1909.|$|E
5|$|Nonmetals have {{structures}} {{in which each}} atom usually forms (8−N) bonds with (8−N) nearest neighbours, where N {{is the number of}} valence electrons. Each atom is thereby able to complete its valence shell and attain a stable noble gas configuration. Exceptions to the (8−N) rule occur with hydrogen (which only needs one bond to complete its valence shell), carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. Atoms of the latter <b>three</b> <b>elements</b> are sufficiently small such that they are able to form alternative (more stable) bonding structures, with fewer nearest neighbours. Thus, carbon is able to form its layered graphite structure, and nitrogen and oxygen are able to form diatomic molecules having triple and double bonds, respectively. The larger size of the remaining non-noble nonmetals weakens their capacity to form multiple bonds and they instead form two or more single bonds to two or more different atoms. Sulfur, for example, forms an eight-membered molecule in which the atoms are arranged in a ring, with each atom forming two single bonds to different atoms.|$|E

Section 21 identifies that review and liability occurs when the trustees appoints agents, nominees and custodians under the Act or under similar provisions in the trust instrument.

Secondly, they are required to consider whether or not to intervene in the appointment if circumstances demand it. Thirdly, trustees are required to intervene after appointment if the circumstances demand it.

5|$|The Oddo–Harkins rule {{holds that}} {{elements}} with even atomic numbers {{are more common}} that those with odd atomic numbers, {{with the exception of}} hydrogen. This rule argues that elements with odd atomic numbers have one unpaired proton {{and are more likely to}} capture another, thus increasing their atomic number. In elements with even atomic numbers, protons are paired, with each member of the pair offsetting the spin of the other, enhancing stability. All the alkali metals have odd atomic numbers and they are not as common as the elements with even atomic numbers adjacent to them (the noble gases and the alkaline earth metals) in the Solar System. The heavier alkali metals are also less abundant than the lighter ones as the alkali metals from rubidium onward can only be synthesised in supernovae and not in stellar nucleosynthesis. Lithium is also much less abundant than sodium and potassium as it is poorly synthesised in both Big Bang nucleosynthesis and in stars: the Big Bang could only produce trace quantities of lithium, beryllium and boron due to the absence of a stable nucleus with 5 or 8 nucleons, and stellar nucleosynthesis could only pass this bottleneck by the triple-alpha process, fusing three helium nuclei to form carbon, and skipping over those <b>three</b> <b>elements.</b>|$|E
5|$|The head of Scelidosaurus was small, {{about twenty}} {{centimetres}} long, and elongated. The skull was low {{in side view}} and triangular in top view, longer than it was wide, {{similar to that of}} earlier ornithischians. The snout, largely formed by the nasal bones, was flat on top. Scelidosaurus still had the five pairs of fenestrae (skull openings) seen in basal ornithischians: apart from the nostrils and eye sockets which are present in all basal dinosaurs, the fenestra antorbitalis and the upper and lower temporal fenestrae were not closed or overgrown, as with many later armoured forms. In fact, the upper temporal fenestrae were very large, forming conspicuous round openings {{in the top of the}} rear skull, serving as attachment areas for the powerful muscles that closed the lower jaws. The eye socket was slightly overshadowed in its front part by the prefrontal bone. Behind it, the upper rim of the eye socket was formed by the supraorbital bone. A study by Susannah Maidment e.a. concluded that juvenile specimens show that this bone was a fusion of <b>three</b> <b>elements,</b> one in front, the next in rear, and the third at the inner side.|$|E

5|$|Yugoslavia's socialist {{government}} suppressed or discouraged public religious celebrations {{until the}} early 1990s. Since then, the Serbian Orthodox Church has, together with local communities, organized public celebrations on Christmas Eve. There are typically <b>three</b> <b>elements</b> to such celebrations: the preparation, the ritual, and the festivity. The preparation consists of cutting down the oak sapling {{to be used as}} the badnjak, taking it to the church yard, and preparing drink and food for the assembled parishioners. The ritual includes Vespers, placing the badnjak on the open fire built in the church yard, blessing or consecrating the badnjak, and an appropriate program with songs and recitals. In some parishes they build the fire on which to burn the badnjak not in the church yard but at some other suitable location in their town or village. The festivity consists of gathering around the fire and socializing. Each particular celebration has its own specific traits however, reflecting the traditions of the local community.|$|E
5|$|Depending on the {{interest}} that the applicant seeks to represent, standing {{can be categorized}} as either private or public standing. Applicants must establish they have private standing if they seek to represent personal interests. In contrast, an applicant who seeks to represent {{the interest}}s of a larger group or {{the public at large}} must establish he or she has public or representative standing. Where private standing is concerned, the Singapore courts have not yet directly addressed the issue of the standing required to obtain a declaration in an administrative law case, but where constitutional claims are concerned the Court of Appeal held that <b>three</b> <b>elements</b> must exist: (1) the applicant must have a real interest in bringing the case, (2) there must be a real controversy between the parties to the case, and (3) a personal right possessed by the applicant must have been violated. The Court also suggested that the same test applied to applications for prerogative orders. The legal position on public standing in administrative law cases is indeterminate as, to date, no applicant has sought to rely on public standing to obtain leave for judicial review. In constitutional law cases, the Court has drawn a distinction between public and private rights, and held that people will not have standing to vindicate public rights unless they have suffered special damage and have genuine private interests to protect or further.|$|E
