2500|$|Management {{must also}} choose {{the form of}} the {{dividend}} distribution, generally as cash dividends or via a share buyback. Various factors may be taken into consideration: where shareholders must pay tax on dividends, firms may elect to retain earnings or to perform a stock buyback, in both cases increasing the value of shares outstanding. Alternatively, some companies will pay [...] "dividends" [...] from stock rather than in cash; see Corporate action. [...] Financial theory suggests that the dividend policy should be set based upon the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>company</b> and what management determines is the best use of those dividend resources for the firm to its shareholders. [...] As a general rule, shareholders of growth companies would prefer managers to retain earnings and pay no dividends (use excess cash to reinvest into the company's operations), whereas shareholders of value or secondary stocks would prefer the management of these companies to payout surplus earnings in the form of cash dividends when a positive return cannot be earned through the reinvestment of undistributed earnings. [...] A share buyback program may be accepted when the value of the stock is greater than the returns to be realized from the reinvestment of undistributed profits. [...] In all instances, the appropriate dividend policy is usually directed by that which maximizes long-term shareholder value.|$|E

2500|$|Once the {{decision}} has been made about the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>company,</b> formation occurs through a series of procedures with the registrar at Companies House. Before registration, anybody promoting the company to attract investment falls under strict fiduciary duties to disclose all material facts about the venture and its finances. Moreover, anybody purporting to contract in a company's name before its registration will generally be personally liable on those obligations. In the registration process, those who invest money in a company will sign a memorandum of association stating what shares they will initially take, and pledge their compliance with the Companies Act 2006. A standard company constitution, known as the Model Articles, is deemed to apply, or the corporators may register their own individualised articles of association. Directors must be appointed - one in a private company and at least two in a public company - and a public company must have a secretary, but there needs to be no more than a single member. The company will be refused registration if it is set up for an unlawful purpose, and a name must be chosen that is not inappropriate or already in use. This information is filled out in the [...] "IN01" [...] form available on the Companies House website, and a Â£18 fee is paid for online registration via Business Link in 8 to 10 days, or a Â£40 [...] fee if using the paper IN01 form (the fee is Â£100 for same day registration using the paper form).
