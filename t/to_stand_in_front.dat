25|$|In July 1924, Matthews {{left for}} the USA to market his invention. When he was offered $25,000 to {{demonstrate}} his beam to the Radio World Fair at Madison Square Garden, he again refused and claimed, without foundation, {{that he was not}} permitted to demonstrate it outside England. US scientists were not impressed. One Professor Woods offered <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the death ray device to demonstrate his disbelief. Regardless, when Matthews returned to Britain, he claimed that the USA had bought his ray but refused to say who had done it and for how much. Matthews moved to the USA and began to work for Warner Bros.|$|E
25|$|Actor Andrew Buchan said {{cast members}} were told {{little about the}} plot, except on a {{need-to-know}} basis as they prepared for their performances in each episode. The actors also received only parts of scripts and only two scripts {{at a time to}} ensure {{that they did not know}} story details too far in advance. Cinematographer John Conroy said the cast and crew did not know how series two ended until three weeks before shooting began on the final two scripts. Two former Coldstream Guards were hired <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of news reporters when they visited the set, to block possible photographs of the filming. Several different endings for series two were filmed, the cast was not permitted to see completed episodes of the series, and Chibnall said that cast members will remain in the dark about the programme's outcome until the final episode airs.|$|E

500|$|Willow's dream {{opens with}} Willow {{painting}} Sappho's love poem, , in Greek onto Tara's back. She then finds {{herself on the}} Sunnydale High school stage, about to perform in a radically changed Death of a Salesman, with Riley playing a cowboy, Buffy as a flapper and Harmony (a popular girl in high school who snubbed Willow, and who became a vampire {{at the end of}} Season 3) goofily trying to bite Giles' neck. Willow realizes with increasing uneasiness that she knows neither her lines nor her role. Buffy then takes Willow <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of a classroom in the same nerdy clothes she wore in [...] "Welcome to the Hellmouth" [...] and [...] "The Harvest" [...] {{at the beginning of the}} series. Xander mocks her as she nervously begins to read her book report. Oz and Tara—Willow's ex-boyfriend and current girlfriend—flirt with each other while watching Willow recite. Suddenly, Willow is attacked and has the life sucked out of her by the First Slayer.|$|E
500|$|Director Ardolino {{encouraged}} the actors to improvise and often kept the cameras rolling, even if actors went [...] "off script". One {{example of this}} was the scene where Grey was <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of Swayze {{with her back to}} him and put her arm up behind his head while he trailed his fingers down her arm (similar to the pose seen in the movie poster). Though it was written as a serious and tender moment, Grey was exhausted, found the move ticklish, and could not stop giggling each time Swayze tried it, no matter how many takes Ardolino asked for. Swayze was impatient to finish the scene and found Grey's behavior annoying. However, the producers decided the scene worked as it was and put it into the film, complete with Grey's giggling and Swayze's annoyed expression. It {{became one of the most}} famous scenes in the movie, turning out, as choreographer Kenny Ortega put it, [...] "as one of the most delicate and honest moments in the film." ...|$|E

500|$|Cliff Fletcher, who drafted {{him into}} the NHL, {{described}} Nieuwendyk as being a [...] "pre-eminent two-way guy who had 50-goal seasons", adding that [...] "{{he had a great}} stick around the net, he had a great shot, he saw the ice well, he could skate, he had the size – he had everything you needed to have. History has indicated that wherever he went, the team was competitive. The more that was on the line in big games, the better Joe played." [...] He was an offensive centre in Calgary and power play specialist, able to withstand the physical punishment required <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the net and battle defencemen for the puck. He led the NHL in power play goals in 1987–88 with 31 and finished in the top ten on four other occasions. [...] Wayne Gretzky, who also played box lacrosse in his youth, argued that the skills Nieuwendyk learned dodging opposing players in that sport aided his development as a hockey player. Nieuwendyk was regarded as a top faceoff man, a skill that Team Canada relied on during the Olympics. He was a checking-line centre at the 2002 Olympics, relied on for his defensive and faceoff abilities.|$|E
500|$|Rubano had a bassline that, {{within an}} hour of playing it, became the track [...] "New Again." [...] After writing it, Fazzi said it was a [...] "no-brainer for an opener". O'Connell called it [...] "powerful" [...] and said it [...] "sets the mood" [...] for the album. One day during rehearsals, Fazzi played a guitar riff, then O'Connell played along, {{resulting}} in [...] "Sink into Me." [...] The song begins with cheerleader-esque [...] "hey!"s that Fazzi came up with. Lazzara referred to it as a [...] "freight train. ... if you were <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of it, you would get pummeled". Lazzara also mentioned that the music to it was [...] "unlike anything we've ever done before. It's real upbeat." [...] For [...] "Lonely, Lonely," [...] Lazzara said it was the [...] "first time that we just turned it up to ten and went with it". With this song, Fazzi said the group wanted something [...] "short, to the point and just punishing from start to finish". The song's bridge had been suggested by Fazzi during his audition for the band. Rubano said the track was [...] "a freight train of rock & roll" [...] and was inspired by Queens of the Stone Age. [...] "Summer, Man" [...] {{was one of the first}} songs written for New Again. It was composed during the Projekt Revolution tour, and consisted originally of a bridge guitar riff by Reyes. Rubano said it was the band's take on a Beach Boys-esque song.|$|E

2500|$|In 2006, Jang {{appeared}} in the film Between Love and Hate, the directorial debut of actor and screenwriter Kim Hae-gon. She {{played the role of}} Yeon-ah, a carefree bargirl who embarks on a tumultuous love-hate relationship with slacker Young-woon (played by Kim Seung-woo), despite him being engaged to another woman. In order to give a realistic portrayal of a bargirl, Jang spent time touring underground bars and room salons, but had difficulty identifying with her character, saying, [...] "I couldn’t easily understand why she had to act that way... I was embarrassed at times <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the camera and act like that." [...] Her performance won Best Leading Actress at the Korean Film Awards, and she also received nominations at the Blue Dragon Film Awards and Baeksang Arts Awards.|$|E
2500|$|Three stone cottages and a forge used <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the church; {{these were}} {{demolished}} in 1970 {{and the stone}} was re-used to build the church's present car-park wall. The gateposts leading from the car-park to the churchyard were once reputedly the posts for the original village stocks, which have been replaced with a replica. The churchyard was enlarged by half an acre {{on the south side}} with land given by Eliza Bentley in 1868. Near the south entrance there is an old sundial-base, which once said, [...] "PB 1675, Redime Tempus", referring to St Paul in Ephesians V.16: [...] "redeeming the time, because the days are evil".

2500|$|On August 7, 2009 Palin {{released}} a statement on her Facebook page in which she said, [...] "The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of Obama's 'death panel' so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their 'level of productivity in society,' whether they are worthy of health care." [...] The Associated Press reported: [...] "Palin and other critics are wrong." [...] The provision {{of the health care}} bill to which Palin referred (on page 425) merely authorizes Medicare reimbursement for physicians who provide voluntary counseling about such subjects as living wills. Howard Dean, the former Chair of the Democratic National Committee, said that Palin [...] "just made that up. Just like the 'Bridge to Nowhere' that she supposedly didn't support." [...] Republicans were divided. Former Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Newt Gingrich agreed with Palin, saying that [...] "there are clearly people in America who believe in establishing euthanasia, including selective standards." [...] Palin's [...] "death panels" [...] comment was selected as the [...] "Lie of the Year" [...] by PolitiFact.com, the fact-checking website of the St. Petersburg Times. Palin was also criticized for having invoked her infant for political purposes.|$|E
2500|$|To {{maintain}} a philosophical balance, {{the argument for}} [...] "raw feels" [...] needs to be set {{side by side with}} the claim above. Viewing sensations as [...] "raw feels" [...] implies that initially they have not yet—to carry on the metaphor—been [...] "cooked", that is, unified into [...] "things" [...] and [...] "persons", which is something the mind does after the sensation has responded to the blank input, that response driven by motivation, that is, initially by pain and pleasure, and subsequently, when memories have been implanted, by desire and fear. Such a [...] "raw-feel" [...] state has been more formally identified as [...] "non-epistemic". In support of this view, the theorists cite a range of empirical facts. The following can be taken as representative. There are brain-damaged persons, known as [...] "agnosics" [...] (literally [...] "not-knowing") who still have vivid visual sensations but are quite unable to identify any entity before them, including parts of their own body. There is also the similar predicament of persons, formerly blind, who are given sight for the first time—and consider what it is a newborn baby must experience. A German psychologist of the 19th century, Hermann von Helmholtz, proposed a simple experiment to demonstrate the non-epistemic nature of qualia: his instructions were <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of a familiar landscape, turn your back on it, bend down and look at the landscape between your legs—you will find it difficult in the upside-down view to recognize what you found familiar before.|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} begins with Scherzinger {{sitting in the}} back of a London hackney carriage. As the rain pours outside and raindrops cover the windows, she sings the first verse while {{changing}} her smart clothes for more casual ones. She stares longingly out of the carriage's window, watching the rain outside. During the chorus, there are two main scenes. In the first she is seen wrapped in blanket while in the second she walks across the room of an old house, in need of renovation. The lighting is cold and dim, and most of the furniture is covered in plastic wrap. Scherzinger stares resentfully at her surroundings while crossing the room. In the second verse, Scherzinger stands in front of a mirror in the bathroom of the house where she has a moment of realisation. After turning the taps on for a while, the sink overflows as she scornfully looks in the mirror, relating to the lyrics of the song. She is then scene walking towards the camera, through a hallway of the house. It is a confident independent walk towards the audience with lights flashing rhythmically behind her. The bridge sees Scherzinger sitting in one the house's empty rooms, in an old armchair and intersects some of the earlier carriage and bathroom scenes. As she sings the lyric [...] "The screen fades to black", the blanket seen earlier on falls in front of the camera, revealing a close up shot of Scherzinger's face. Her hair flows in the wind and she finally gets up from the armchair <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the room's open windows. In the final scene, she stands confidently in front of the window as wind and light flood the room. She sings the final verse of the song, looking directly at the camera and smiling for the first time in the video.|$|E

50|$|Some {{automated}} teller machines have {{a sophisticated}} display that discourages shoulder surfers from obtaining displayed information.
