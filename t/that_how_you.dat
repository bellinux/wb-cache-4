6000|$|Dolly and Walter Brydges strolled off by {{themselves}} toward the rocky shore. There Walter showed her where a brook bubbled {{clear from the}} fountain-head; by its brink, blue veronicas grew, and tall yellow loosestrife, and tasselled purple heads of great English eupatory. Bending down to the stream he picked a little bunch of forget-me-nots, {{and handed them to}} her.

He said, [...] "I believe I'm a cut above the rest. As a mafioso, you have to be an elitist.

6000|$|The {{interior}} of the bungalow was divided by two passages crossing {{each other in the}} middle. At that point Heemskirk, by turning his head slightly to the left as he passed, secured the evidence of [...] "carrying on" [...] so irreconcilable with old Nelson's assurances that it made him stagger, with a rush of blood to his head. Two white figures, distinct against the light, stood in an unmistakable attitude. Freya's arms were round Jasper's neck. Their faces were characteristically superimposed on each other, and Heemskirk went on, his throat choked with a sudden rising of curses, till on the west verandah he stumbled blindly against a chair and then dropped into another as though his legs had been swept from under him. He had indulged too long in the habit of appropriating Freya to himself in his thoughts. [...] "Is <b>that</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> entertain your visitors- -you [...] " [...] he thought, so outraged that he could not find a sufficiently degrading epithet.|$|E

She has expressed <b>that</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> get money {{to be able to be}} a filmmaker in Kenya is through making films about whatever NGOs are funding - films that are about AIDs or female genital mutilation.

50|$|Born in Greenfield, Iowa, in 1927, he {{attended}} Iowa State College and {{graduated with a}} B.S. in journalism. After graduation he worked for local newspapers in Council Bluffs and Omaha. While in Omaha, he taught undergraduate journalism classes at Creighton University where he was exposed to frequent, lengthy political debates between conservatives and liberals alike. He learned the lasting lesson that it was paramount to have all your facts straight and <b>that</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> said something was sometimes {{more important than what}} you said. An old Jesuit at Creighton recommended him to some former students in New York and Sidey landed a job with Life magazine where he made an immediate impact.|$|E

5000|$|Steven Sloman {{produced}} another interpretation on dual processing in 1996. He {{believed that}} associative reasoning takes stimuli and divides it into logical clusters of information based on statistical regularity. He proposed <b>that</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> associate is {{directly proportional to}} the similarity of past experiences, relying on temporal and similarity relations to determine reasoning rather than an underlying mechanical structure. The other reasoning process in Sloman's opinion was of the Rule-based system. The system functioned on logical structure and variables based upon rule systems to come to conclusions {{different from that of}} the associative system. He also believed that the Rule-based system had control over the associative system, though it could only suppress it. [...] This interpretation corresponds well to earlier work on computational models of dual processes of reasoning.|$|E
50|$|The film {{took two}} and a half years to make and was shot on {{location}} in Afghanistan. According to director John Frankenheimer:It represents for me the first time I've been able to put together the two sides of my work - the spectacle like Grand Prix or The Train and the intimate kind of picture like Birdman of Alcatraz or Seven Days in May. For me it has a very contemporary meaning, which is why I did it. It's a man looking for himself, a theme that I've done over and over on TV and in movies. I do think that Dalton Trumbo is the best screenwriter we've got... Most of my films are about putting people under extreme pressure. Because my contention in life is <b>that</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> know people is how they respond to a crisis.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Weinstein {{conducted}} research into Soviet intelligence files with former KGB operative Alexander Vassiliev. This research was {{primarily for the}} 1999 book The Haunted Wood, but the material Vassiliev and Weinstein found that related to the Hiss case {{was added to the}} 1997 edition of Perjury. It was later revealed that some scholarly friction existed between the two coauthors. Vassiliev stated, [...] "I never saw a document where Hiss would be called ALES or ALES may be called Hiss. I made a point of that to Allen." [...] Weinstein was [...] "sloppy almost every time he quoted documents relating to Alger Hiss."However, in a 2002 episode of PBS's NOVA, Vassiliev said, [...] "The Rosenbergs, Theodore Hall and Alger Hiss did spy for the Soviets, and I saw their real names in the documents, their code names, a lot of documents about <b>that.</b> <b>How</b> <b>you</b> judge them is up to you. To me, they're heroes." ...|$|E
