Work began immediately on the airfield at Tacloban, and commenced on airfields in central Leyte soon after they were captured. Heavy seasonal rains thwarted attempts to develop the airbases in central Leyte and {{it was decided to}} abandon their development and construct a new airbase on the coast at a site occupied by Sixth Army headquarters. <b>The</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> aircraft based on Leyte to stop the Japanese from reinforcing the island was so pressing that Lieutenant General Walter Krueger agreed to move his headquarters.|$|E

The London Fire Brigade told Newsnight the first attendance procedure for tower fires has now been changed from four engines to five engines plus a high ladder unit.

25|$|Associated {{with the}} formula is an {{extremely}} comprehensive set of rules. The rules can be classified into two main areas: rules concerning safety and rules to ensure competitive racing. For example, the maximum total area of all cockpits is specified to minimise {{the chance of a}} boat being swamped in rougher seas. Structural requirements are specified to ensure that strength is not sacrificed by <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> weight low down in the keel. Materials are specified plus numerous other details concerning all aspects of the boat. The intention is to challenge designers but ensure competitive racing.|$|E
500|$|Church had {{previously}} led expeditions against Acadia during King William's War, and Governor Dudley issued him a colonel's commission for the effort, giving him specific orders to obtain Acadian prisoners {{that could be}} exchanged for the English prisoners taken in the Deerfield raid. [...] The expedition was also {{to be one of}} punishment: [...] "Use all possible methods for the burning and destroying of the enemies houses and breaking the dams of their corn grounds, and make what other spoil you can upon them". [...] Dudley, however, specifically denied Church permission to attack Port Royal, the Acadian capital, citing <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> permission from London before taking such a step.|$|E

500|$|Charlie's {{sexuality}} was sidelined and {{she began}} a relationship with Angelo Rosetta (Luke Jacobz). Throughout their romance Charlie played out various family oriented plots and was described as having strong feelings for him. Their romance was portrayed to be wayward and unstable. In 2011, their relationship ended after producers felt {{there were no more}} storylines to give to the pair. Charlie later develops feelings for Darryl Braxton (Steve Peacocke). Another notable storyline for Charlie saw her reveal that her supposed sister, Ruby, was in fact her daughter. Anderson said the filming process was challenging as they felt <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the story right. Viewers sympathised with Charlie and saw a [...] "beautiful element" [...] in the portrayal. The revelation ruined the on-screen relationship between Charlie and Ruby, and was never repaired.|$|E

2500|$|Spurrier {{had been}} {{considered}} for the starting quarterback position leading up to his sophomore year of 1964, but a serious knee injury suffered during spring drills caused him to lose practice time and allowed returning senior starter Tommy Shannon to keep the job. Coach Ray Graves still felt <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the future star on the field, {{so he decided to}} alternate his two quarterbacks as the flow of the game dictated. Spurrier entered the season opening game against SMU [...] in the second quarter. After two unsuccessful running plays called from the sidelines left the Gators in a third down and long situation, Coach Graves told Spurrier to call the next play himself. The young quarterback responded by completing a fifty-six yard screen pass on his first collegiate attempt and a touchdown on his second pass. Spurrier would add another touchdown pass {{during the second half of}} his varsity debut. The following week on the road at Mississippi State, Spurrier entered a tied game late in the fourth quarter and led the Gators down the field for a game-winning field goal.|$|E

Inayat Khan's [...] "childlike" [...] qualities, particularly her gentle manner and [...] "lack of ruse", had greatly worried her instructors at SOE's training schools. One instructor wrote that [...] "she confesses {{that she would}} not like to have to do anything 'two faced'", while another said she was [...] "very feminine in character, very eager to please, very ready to adapt herself to the mood of the company, the one of the conversation, capable of strong attachments, kind hearted, emotional, imaginative." [...] A further observer said: [...] "Tends to give far too much information. Came here without the foggiest idea what she was being trained for." [...] Later, others commented that she was also physically unsuited, claiming {{that she would not}} easily disappear into a crowd. Physically tiny, Inayat Khan also received poor athletic reports from her instructors: [...] "Can run very well but otherwise clumsy. Unsuitable for jumping" [...] "Pretty scared of weapons but tries hard to get over it." ...|$|E

Although hired in August to set up a southern bureau for CBS in New Orleans, Rather had only recently moved from Dallas to New Orleans in November [...] and would not have been in Dallas except for <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> film to Dallas CBS affiliate KRLD-TV (now KDFW) to feed to New York. Although he had no assigned reporting role in Dallas, Rather says he happened to be [...] "on {{the other side of the}} railroad tracks, beyond the triple underpass, thirty yards from a grassy knoll that would later figure in so many conspiracy theories." [...] His job was to fetch a film drop from a camera truck at that location and take it to the station for editing. He did not witness or hear the shooting, he said. He heard nothing of what may have caused the commotion until he reached KRLD, running all the way through Dealey Plaza, [...] "The moment I cleared the railroad tracks I saw a scene I will never forget. Some people were lying on the grass, some screaming, some running, some pointing. Policemen swarmed everywhere and distinctly above the din, I heard one shout, 'DON'T ANYBODY PANIC.' And of course, there was nothing but panic wherever you looked." ...|$|E

60|$|This is a {{nightmare}} hypothesis, but the difficulties of the practical problem seem to warrant its entertainment. The {{number of people in}} Russia who can even read and write is extremely small, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> them employed industrially as rapidly as possible is very great, hence the system of education which develops out of this situation cannot be very ambitious or enlightened. Further it will have to continue over a sufficiently long period of time to allow of the risk of its becoming stable and traditional. In adult education already the pupil comes for a short period, learns Communism, reading and writing--there is hardly time to give him much more--and returns to leaven the army or his native village. In achieving this the Bolsheviks are already doing a very important and valuable work, but they cannot hope for a long while to become the model of public instruction which they have hitherto been represented to be. And the conditions of their becoming so ultimately are adherence to their ideals through a very long period of stress, and a lessening of fanaticism in their Communist teaching, conditions which, unhappily, seem to be mutually incompatible.|$|E
