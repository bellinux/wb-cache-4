5|$|Before 1951, several {{different}} flags {{had been in}} use since the Revolution. The earliest flag was plain red, and was used in 1919 during {{the existence of the}} Lithuanian-Byelorussian SSR. After the formation of the Byelorussian SSR, the lettering ССРБ (SSRB) was added in gold to the top hoist. This design was established {{with the passage of the}} first Constitution of the Byelorussian SSR. It was later modified in the 1927 Constitution where <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> were changed to БССР (BSSR) but kept the overall design the same. This design was changed in 1937, when a hammer and sickle and red star were placed above <b>the</b> <b>letters.</b> The flag dimensions were also formally established as 1:2 for the first time. This flag remained in use until the adoption of the 1951 flag, which did away with <b>the</b> <b>letters.</b>|$|E

5|$|However, because Eusebius nowhere categorically {{asserts that}} he has read <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> (he only says {{that he has}} {{compiled}} them) and as moderns are disinclined to take him at his word, some, like Pohlsander, posit that Eusebius did not get the tale from <b>the</b> <b>letters,</b> and drew it instead from oral rumors. Whatever the case, the wording of the passage shows that Eusebius is unenthusiastic about his subject and skeptical of its significance. Jerome and the Latin Christian authors following him do not share his caution.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, 25 {{years after}} the end of their relationship, Joyce Maynard {{auctioned}} a series of letters Salinger had written her. Maynard's memoir of her life and her relationship with Salinger, At Home in the World: A Memoir, was published the same year. Among other topics, the book described how Maynard's mother had consulted with her on how to appeal to the aging author (who was dressing like a child), and described Joyce's relationship with him at length. In the ensuing controversy over both the memoir and <b>the</b> <b>letters,</b> Maynard claimed that she was forced to auction <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> for financial reasons; she would have preferred to donate them to the Beinecke Library. Software developer Peter Norton bought <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> for US$156,500 and announced his intention to return them to Salinger.|$|E
5|$|In early 1996, former FBI hostage {{negotiator}} {{and criminal}} profiler Clinton R. Van Zandt was contacted by an investigator working with Bisceglie.

Van Zandt's initial analysis determined that there was better than a 60 percent chance that the same person had written <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> {{as well as the}} manifesto, which had been in public circulation for half a year. Van Zandt's second analytical team determined an even higher likelihood that <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> and the manifesto were the product of the same author.

5|$|In {{the first}} trial, 38 Dutch-speaking local {{elementary}} school girls circled <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> they preferred in two yoked lists of letter pairs. A significant preference for <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> of one's own name over {{those of the}} other person was found. The second experiment used 98 Dutch-speaking local university students, to see if more years of reading made a difference. Four other factors were varied: 1) either pairs or triads of letters; 2) encircling the preferred letter or crossing out the less preferred one(s); 3) <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> QXYZ, infrequent in Dutch, included or excluded; 4) own-name letters presented first or last. All conditions gave a name-letter effect, with a stronger effect when QXYZ were included and the less preferred letter was crossed out. No significant difference was found using family name rather than first name or both names. While the effect was strongest for initials, subsequent data analysis revealed a significant effect even without the first and last initial.|$|E

Guy points out that <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> are disjointed, and that the French language and grammar employed in the sonnets are too poor for a writer with Mary's education.
