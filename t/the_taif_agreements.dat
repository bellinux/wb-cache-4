5000|$|<b>The</b> 1989 <b>Taif</b> <b>Agreement,</b> {{which ended}} <b>the</b> country's 15-year civil war, reaffirmed this {{arrangement}} but, significantly, mandated increased Muslim representation in Parliament {{so that it}} would be equal to that of the Christian community and reduced the power of the Christian Maronite presidency. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>Taif</b> <b>Agreement,</b> which concluded <b>the</b> country's 15-year civil war, endorsed the constitutional provision of appointing most senior government officials according to religious affiliation. This practice is operative in all three branches of government. <b>The</b> <b>Taif</b> <b>Agreement</b> also stipulated a cabinet with power equally allocated between Muslims and Christians. The political establishment has been reluctant to change this [...] "confessional" [...] system, because citizens perceive it as critical to the country's stability.|$|R
25|$|The {{geography}} and ruling imams of North Yemen kept the country isolated from foreign influence before 1962. The country's relations with Saudi Arabia were defined by <b>the</b> <b>Taif</b> <b>Agreement</b> of 1934, which delineated the northernmost {{part of the}} border between the two kingdoms and set the framework for commercial and other intercourse. <b>The</b> <b>Taif</b> <b>Agreement</b> has been renewed periodically in 20-year increments, and its validity was reaffirmed in 1995. Relations with the British colonial authorities in Aden and the south were usually tense.|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Taif</b> <b>Agreement</b> of 1989 {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of the end of the fighting. In January of that year, a committee appointed by the Arab League, chaired by Kuwait and including Saudi Arabia, Algeria, and Morocco, began to formulate solutions to the conflict. This led to a meeting of Lebanese parliamentarians in Ta'if, Saudi Arabia, where they agreed to the national reconciliation accord in October. The agreement provided a large role for Syria in Lebanese affairs. Returning to Lebanon, they ratified the agreement on 4 November and elected Rene Mouawad as President the following day. Military leader Michel Aoun in East Beirut refused to accept Mouawad, and denounced <b>the</b> <b>Taif</b> <b>Agreement.</b>|$|R
25|$|In {{the same}} month, the Lebanese Parliament agreed to <b>the</b> <b>Taif</b> <b>Agreement,</b> which {{included}} an outline timetable for Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon and {{a formula for}} the de-confessionalisation of the Lebanese political system. The war ended {{at the end of}} 1990 after sixteen years, resulting in massive loss of human life and property, while devastating the country's economy. It is estimated that 150,000 people were killed and another 200,000 wounded. Nearly a million civilians were displaced by the war, and some never returned. Parts of Lebanon were left in ruins. <b>The</b> <b>Taif</b> <b>Agreement</b> has still not been implemented in full and Lebanon's political system continues to be divided along sectarian lines.|$|R

25|$|Gemayel's term expired on 23 September 1988 {{without the}} {{election}} of a successor. Chamoun declared his strong support for Michel Aoun, who had been appointed by the outgoing president to lead an interim administration and went on to lead one of two rival governments that contended for power over the next two years. He strongly opposed <b>the</b> <b>Taif</b> <b>Agreement,</b> which not only gave a greater share of power to the Muslim community than they had enjoyed previously, but more seriously, in Chamoun's opinion, formalized what he saw as the master-servant relationship between Syria and Lebanon, and refused to recognize the new government of the President Elias Hrawi, who was elected under <b>the</b> <b>Taif</b> <b>Agreement.</b>|$|R
5000|$|After 16 years, {{the civil}} war halted {{following}} successful negotiation of <b>the</b> <b>Taif</b> <b>Agreement,</b> which required <b>the</b> [...] "disbanding of all Lebanese and non-Lebanese militias" [...] and required the government to [...] "deploy the Lebanese army in the border area adjacent to Israel." ...|$|R
50|$|Lebanon's {{national}} {{legislature is}} called the Assembly of Representatives (Majlis An-Nouwab). Since the elections of 1992 (the first since the reforms of <b>the</b> <b>Taif</b> <b>Agreement</b> of 1989) removed the built-in majority previously enjoyed by Christians, the Parliament has had 128 seats and the term is four years.|$|R
50|$|Suleiman Franjieh's {{military}} career {{began when he}} was 17 years old. In 1982, he became leader of the Marada Brigades. The party disbanded its militia to become a political group following the disbanding of armed militias after <b>the</b> <b>Taif</b> <b>Agreement.</b> Marada began to participate in social, cultural, educational, health and political affairs.|$|R
50|$|He was the {{key player}} of the Intifada of 6 February 1984 with his ally Walid Jumblatt leader of the Progressive Socialist Party against the Lebanese sectarian {{government}} of Amin Gemayel, where officers and soldiers were called to defect from the Lebanese Army and made ground for <b>the</b> <b>Taif</b> <b>agreement</b> that ended <b>the</b> civil war.|$|R
50|$|War {{continued}} until the Fall of 1989 when remaining {{members of the}} Lebanese parliament met in Saudi Arabia to draft the National Reconciliation Charter, commonly known as <b>the</b> <b>Taif</b> <b>Agreement.</b> Power was now equally split amongst Christians and Muslims. However another rebellion was launched in 1990 but was suppressed by Syria, thus ending the 15-year civil war.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Taif</b> <b>Agreement</b> of 1989 {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of the end of the war, and was ratified on November 4.

[...] He was succeeded by Elias Hrawi, who remained in office until 1998.|$|R
50|$|In 1991, The Hezbollah {{had entered}} a new era {{with the end of}} both the Iran-Iraq War and Lebanese Civil War, <b>the</b> <b>Taif</b> <b>Agreement</b> and <b>the</b> release of the Kuwait 17 bombers. A new leader was thought to be needed to {{facilitate}} the release of the Western hostages held by Hezbollah and more importantly to shift Hezbollah's focus to resistance activity against Israel.|$|R
50|$|Lebanon's {{religious}} {{divisions are}} extremely complicated, {{and the country}} is made up by a multitude of religious groupings. Sectarianism in Lebanon was caused because of the political sharing of power. The 1943 National Pact gave the Maronite Christians, the then majority, more power than the other groups. Although <b>the</b> <b>Taif</b> <b>agreement</b> ended <b>the</b> civil war, power is still divided along sects.|$|R
50|$|Phoenicianism is an {{identity}} {{on the part}} of Lebanese Christians that has developed into an integrated ideology led by key thinkers, {{but there are a few}} who have stood out more than others: Charles Corm, Michel Chiha, and Said Aql in their promotion of Phoenicianism. In post civil-war Lebanon since <b>the</b> <b>Taif</b> <b>agreement,</b> politically Phoenicianism is restricted to a small group.|$|R

5000|$|Leaders of the Rite have {{considered}} Maronite Christianity as the [...] "foundation of the Lebanese nation". The Maronites have been {{closely associated with}} the political system of independent Lebanon; it was estimated that in pre-Civil War Lebanon members of this Rite held {{a large portion of the}} leading posts. However roles were shifted due to <b>the</b> <b>Taif</b> <b>Agreement's</b> theoretical balancing of power.|$|R
5000|$|The Lebanese Forces {{initially}} supported Aoun's [...] "Liberation War" [...] {{against the}} Syrian army, but then agreed to <b>the</b> <b>Taif</b> <b>Agreement,</b> which {{was signed by}} the Lebanese deputies on 24 October 1989 in Saudi Arabia and demanded an immediate ceasefire. Aoun's main objection to <b>the</b> <b>Taif</b> <b>Agreement</b> was its vagueness as to Syrian withdrawal from the country. He rejected it vowing that he [...] "would not sign over the country". Fierce fighting in East Beirut broke out between the Lebanese Forces and the Lebanese Army under Michel Aoun after the Lebanese Army, under orders of Michel Aoun, began stopping and arresting members of the Lebanese Forces. These events led to the [...] "Elimination War" [...] on 31 January 1990. The war continued until the defeat and exile of Aoun to France in August 1990. During the war, the Lebanese Forces made major strides and victories including the capture {{of many of the}} army's encampments, barracks, and units.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Taif</b> <b>Agreement</b> helped {{establish}} a power sharing system between the Christian and Muslim Lebanese political parties. The {{political and economic}} situation in Lebanon had improved greatly. Lebanon had rebuilt its infrastructure. Historical and contemporary conflicts between Hezbollah and Israel have threatened to deteriorate Lebanon's political and economic situation, growing tension between 8 March and 14 March alliances and threatening Lebanon with renewed strife. The Christian community is currently divided, with some aligned with the Kataeb party, Michel Aoun's Free Patriotic Movement, the El Marada Party headed by Suleiman Frangieh, Jr., the Lebanese Forces Movement Samir Geagea, and others within the collection of various 14 March Christian leaders. Although <b>the</b> <b>Taif</b> <b>agreement</b> was widely considered by Christians to degrade their role in Lebanon, by removing much of the President's role (which is allocated to the Maronites), and bolstering {{the roles of the}} Prime Minister (a Sunni) and the Speaker of Parliament (Shia), the Lebanese President nevertheless still wields considerable power. The constitutional remit of the president includes the role of Commander in Chief of the armed forces, as well as the sole ability to form and dissolve governments. Many Lebanese leaders, as well as global powers, continue to lobby to roll back features of <b>the</b> <b>Taif</b> <b>Agreement</b> that eroded <b>the</b> constitutional powers {{of the president of the}} republic. The role of president of the Lebanese Central bank is also a position reserved for Lebanese Christians. This is owed to the historical and contemporary influence of Lebanese Christians among the key bankers of the Middle East region.|$|R
50|$|In Lebanon, {{the concept}} of confessionalism holds an {{important}} political meaning, since political power and governmental bureaucracy are organized according to religious confessions (as it happened in Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands and other countries before). For example, the National Pact (an unwritten covenant) and later <b>the</b> <b>Taif</b> <b>Agreement</b> provide for a Maronite Christian president, a Sunni Muslim prime minister, and a Shia Muslim speaker of parliament.|$|R
50|$|Lebanon's {{national}} {{legislature is}} called the Assembly of Representatives (Majlis al-Nuwab in Arabic). Since the elections of 1992 (the first since the reforms of <b>the</b> <b>Taif</b> <b>Agreement</b> of 1989 removed the built-in majority previously enjoyed by Christians and distributed the seats equally between Christians and Muslims), the Parliament has had 128 seats. The term was four years, but has recently been extended to five.|$|R
50|$|The ADP/ARK {{also joined}} the LNRF (Jammoul) guerrilla {{alliance}} in September 1982 {{to fight the}} Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon and later its successor, the wider Syrian-sponsored Lebanese National Salvation Front (LNSF) in July 1983 against the American-backed government of President Amin Gemayel. In 1988-1990 they accepted <b>the</b> <b>Taif</b> <b>Agreement</b> and supported <b>the</b> parliament-based provisional government of Selim al-Hoss against General Michel Aoun's military interim government.|$|R
50|$|Hrawi {{was elected}} at the Park Hotel in Chtoura by 47 out of 53 member of parliaments on 24 November 1989 {{two days after}} the murder of Lebanon's President René Mouawad. Five of PMs cast blank ballots in the election. As President, Hrawi signed into law {{amendments}} to the Constitution that formalized <b>the</b> <b>Taif</b> <b>Agreement</b> reforms, giving a greater measure of power and influence to Lebanon's Muslim community than before.|$|R
