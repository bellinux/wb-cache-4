25|$|Electron {{diffraction}} is {{most frequently}} used in solid state physics and chemistry to study the crystal structure of solids. Experiments are usually performed in a <b>transmission</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> (TEM), or a scanning electron microscope (SEM) as electron backscatter diffraction. In these instruments, electrons are accelerated by an electrostatic potential {{in order to gain}} the desired energy and determine their wavelength before they interact with the sample to be studied.|$|E
25|$|Since Steno’s Law can {{be further}} {{generalized}} for a single crystal of any material to include the angles between either all identically indexed net planes (i.e. vectors of the reciprocal lattice, also known as 'potential reflections in diffraction experiments') or all identically indexed lattice directions (i.e. vectors of the direct lattice, also known as zone axes), opportunities exist for morphological fingerprinting of nanocrystals in the <b>transmission</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> (TEM) by means of transmission electron goniometry.|$|E
25|$|Other {{completely}} {{different approach to}} microscopy is electron microscope (EM), which gives a beam of electrons {{in order to be}} focused onto the desired specimen with a design capable of giving a magnifying power up to 100,000 times.6 Electron microscopes are also used but very little when compared to light microscopes.

25|$|An {{electron}} microscope is a microscope {{that uses a}} beam of accelerated electrons {{as a source of}} illumination. As the wavelength of an electron can be up to 100,000 times shorter than that of visible light photons, {{electron microscope}}s have a higher resolving power than light microscopes and can reveal the structure of smaller objects. A scanning <b>transmission</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> has achieved better than 50pm resolution in annular dark-field imaging mode and magnifications of up to about 10,000,000x whereas most light microscopes are limited by diffraction to about 200nm resolution and useful magnifications below 2000x.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, there was {{evidence}} that in the radial direction they are rather soft. The first <b>transmission</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> observation of radial elasticity suggested that even the van der Waals forces can deform two adjacent nanotubes. Later, nanoindentations with atomic force microscope were performed by several groups to quantitatively measure radial elasticity of multiwalled carbon nanotubes and tapping/contact mode atomic force microscopy was also performed on single-walled carbon nanotubes. Young's modulus of {{on the order of}} several GPa showed that CNTs are in fact very soft in the radial direction.|$|E
25|$|One major {{disadvantage}} of the <b>transmission</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> {{is the need}} for extremely thin sections of the specimens, typically about 100 nanometers. Creating these thin sections for biological and materials specimens is technically very challenging. Semiconductor thin sections can be made using a focused ion beam. Biological tissue specimens are chemically fixed, dehydrated and embedded in a polymer resin to stabilize them sufficiently to allow ultrathin sectioning. Sections of biological specimens, organic polymers and similar materials may require staining with heavy atom labels in order to achieve the required image contrast.|$|E
50|$|High {{resolution}} scanning <b>transmission</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes</b> require exceptionally stable room environments.

40|$|Proliferation of <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes</b> with field {{emission}} guns, imaging filters and hardware spherical aberration correctors (giving higher spatial and energy resolution) {{has resulted in}} the need to construct special laboratories. As resolutions improve, <b>transmission</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes</b> (TEMs) and scanning <b>transmission</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes</b> (STEMs) become more sensitive to ambient conditions. State-of-the-art <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes</b> require state-of-the-art environments, and this means careful design and implementation of microscope sites, from the microscope room to the building that surrounds it. Laboratories have been constructed to house high-sensitive instruments with resolutions ranging down to sub-Angstrom levels; we present the various design philosophies used for some of these laboratories and our experiences with them. Four facilities are described: the National Center for Electron Microscopy OAM Laboratory at LBNL; the FEGTEM Facility at the University of Sheffield; the Center for Integrative Molecular Biosciences at TSRI; and the Advanced Microscopy Laboratory at ORNL...|$|R
25|$|Embedding, {{biological}} specimens – after dehydration, tissue for {{observation in}} the <b>transmission</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> is embedded {{so it can}} be sectioned ready for viewing. To do this the tissue is passed through a 'transition solvent' such as propylene oxide (epoxypropane) or acetone and then infiltrated with an epoxy resin such as Araldite, Epon, or Durcupan; tissues may also be embedded directly in water-miscible acrylic resin. After the resin has been polymerized (hardened) the sample is thin sectioned (ultrathin sections) and stained – it is then ready for viewing.|$|E
25|$|In 1932, Ernst Lubcke of Siemens & Halske {{built and}} {{obtained}} images from a prototype electron microscope, applying concepts {{described in the}} Rudenberg patent applications. Five years later (1937), the firm financed the work of Ernst Ruska and Bodo von Borries, and employed Helmut Ruska (Ernst’s brother) to develop applications for the microscope, especially with biological specimens. Also in 1937, Manfred von Ardenne pioneered the scanning electron microscope. The first commercial electron microscope was produced in 1938 by Siemens. The first North American electron microscope was constructed in 1938, at the University of Toronto, by Eli Franklin Burton and students Cecil Hall, James Hillier, and Albert Prebus; and Siemens produced a <b>transmission</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> (TEM) in 1939. Although contemporary transmission electron microscopes are capable of two million-power magnification, as scientific instruments, they remain based upon Ruska’s prototype.|$|E
25|$|SEM is not {{a camera}} and the {{detector}} is not continuously image-forming like a CCD array or film. Unlike in an optical system, the resolution is not limited by the diffraction limit, fineness of lenses or mirrors or detector array resolution. The focusing optics can be large and coarse, and the SE detector is fist-sized and simply detects current. Instead, the spatial resolution of the SEM depends {{on the size of}} the electron spot, which in turn depends on both the wavelength of the electrons and the electron-optical system that produces the scanning beam. The resolution is also limited by the size of the interaction volume, the volume of specimen material that interacts with the electron beam. The spot size and the interaction volume are both large compared to the distances between atoms, so the resolution of the SEM is not high enough to image individual atoms, as is possible with <b>transmission</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> (TEM). The SEM has compensating advantages, though, including the ability to image a comparatively large area of the specimen; the ability to image bulk materials (not just thin films or foils); and the variety of analytical modes available for measuring the composition and properties of the specimen. Depending on the instrument, the resolution can fall somewhere between less than 1nbsp&nm and 20nbsp&nm. As of 2009, The world's highest resolution conventional (<30 kV) SEM can reach a point resolution of 0.4nbsp&nm using a secondary electron detector.|$|E

40|$|The phase-contrast imaging {{of atomic}} lattices {{has now become}} commonplace for both <b>Transmission</b> <b>Electron</b> <b>Microscopes</b> (TEM) and Scanning <b>Transmission</b> <b>Electron</b> <b>Microscopes</b> (STEMs) [1].
