5|$|Beginning in 1934, {{the price}} of silver in the United States was {{effectively}} set by the government as it would support <b>that</b> <b>price</b> through purchases and sales of the metal; in 1934 it was $.45 per troy ounce. In 1958, {{with the return of}} lend-lease bullion, the Treasury's stock of silver reached 2.1 billion troy ounces; it began to vend the metal at $.91 per ounce to the public, despite the warnings of the Conference of Western Governors that there was not enough silver to make these sales and maintain coinage operations.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, Eric Dingwall, K. M. Goldney and Trevor H. Hall, {{three members}} of the Society for Psychical Research (SPR), two of whom had been Price's most loyal associates, {{investigated}} his claims about Borley. Their findings were published in a 1956 book, The Haunting of Borley Rectory, which concluded <b>that</b> <b>Price</b> had fraudulently produced some of the phenomena.|$|E
5|$|In the 1940s and 1950s, several {{companies}} started a competing bus service. There were accusations that the route was cross-subsidized and <b>that</b> <b>price</b> dumping was occurring {{along the route}} from Sandnes to Ålgård. In the early 1950s, discussion started about closing the line, and on 1 November 1955, all passenger transport was terminated, after a decision in parliament on 26 May 1955. This is the line with the most frequent passenger traffic in Norway to have been closed.|$|E

The semi-strong form of the EMH claims both <b>that</b> <b>prices</b> reflect all publicly available information and <b>that</b> <b>prices</b> instantly change to reflect new public information.

50|$|Maurice Dobb argued <b>that</b> <b>prices</b> derived through {{marginalism}} {{depend on}} the distribution of income.

Tubb announced in issue 85, which turned out to be the last issue, that he had dropped all interior artwork.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Nolan Bushnell saw Spacewar {{running on a}} {{mainframe}} at the University of Utah {{where he was a}} student. Bushnell worked during the summer at Lagoon Amusement Park in Utah as a manager of the games department overseeing the arcade games, and when he saw Spacewar he believed that an arcade game version of the game would be very popular. The high price of computers capable of running the game, however, meant that any such arcade game would not be economically feasible. After graduating from college Bushnell worked as an engineer in California for Ampex, an electronics company that worked in audio and video recording technology. He also met researcher Jim Stein, who worked for Stanford University's Stanford Artificial Intelligence Project; he learned from him that Spacewar was running on the laboratory's PDP-6, and played the game against him there when visiting. Soon after, he saw an ad for the Data General Nova computer, which cost only US$4,000, and thought again about his Spacewar arcade game idea; he believed that at <b>that</b> <b>price,</b> if he were able to connect four monitors and coin slots to allow multiple games to run simultaneously, the game would be economically viable. He showed his office mate and fellow Ampex engineer Ted Dabney Spacewar at the Stanford laboratory, and the two agreed to work together to try and design a prototype of the game; Bushnell was more experienced with computers and digital engineering, while Dabney was more experienced with analog and hardware engineering, as he had been working on designing video processing and control circuits and power supplies.|$|E
5|$|Melish {{had been}} fielding {{inquiries}} from collectors since Roosevelt signed the legislation, but from mid-May, those who wrote received back only postcards stating the new issue was oversubscribed. The summer of 1936 was {{the peak of}} the commemorative coin boom, and Melish announced the new pieces would be sold in sets of three by mint mark for $7.75 (a high price at that time). Order blanks were sent to those who had written early, and soon these blanks were selling for $10. Yet few collectors were successful in having their orders filled, with most having their payment returned as the coins had supposedly sold out. The sets quickly jumped in price to $40. At this high level, many coins proved available. Numismatist Q. David Bowers stated that these were most likely surreptitiously sold by Melish and other insiders. Melish also allowed the issuers of the York County, Maine Tercentenary half dollar to purchase, at the original issue price, several sets—members of the public could order at most one set at <b>that</b> <b>price.</b> In return, he sought to purchase that and other commemorative coins in quantities beyond the usual order limit. Nevertheless, when the Oregon Trail Memorial Association, issuer of the long-lived half dollar honoring the trail, tried to purchase a set, Melish replied that they were sold out.|$|E

5|$|There {{had been}} coin {{shortages}} beginning in 1959, and the United States Bureau of the Mint expanded production {{to try to}} meet demand. The early 1960s {{was a time of}} increased use of silver both in the coinage and in industry, putting pressure on the price of silver, which was capped at just over $1.29 per ounce by government sales at <b>that</b> <b>price.</b> The silver in a dollar's worth of quarters would be worth more as bullion than as money if the price of the metal rose past $1.38 per ounce, and there was widespread hoarding of silver coins. Demand for the Kennedy half dollar as a collectable drove it from circulation after its debut in 1964. The Bureau of the Mint increased production, helping reduce the coin shortages by May 1965, but government stocks of silver were being rapidly reduced, and threatened to run out by 1968. After extensive study by the Treasury Department, President Lyndon B. Johnson in June 1965 recommended that Congress pass legislation to allow for silverless dimes and quarters, and debased silver half dollars. Although there was some opposition, mainly from legislators representing Western mining states, the bill progressed rapidly through Congress, and was enacted with Johnson's signature on July 23, 1965.|$|E

25|$|Scottsboro: A Tragedy of the American South (1969) by Dan T. Carter {{was widely}} {{thought to be}} authoritative, but it wrongly {{asserted}} <b>that</b> <b>Price</b> and Bates were dead. An NBC TV movie, Judge Horton and the Scottsboro Boys (1976), asserted that the defense had proven <b>that</b> <b>Price</b> and Bates were prostitutes; both sued NBC over their portrayals. Bates died in 1976 in Washington state, where she lived with her carpenter husband, and her case was not heard. Price's case was initially dismissed but she appealed. When the US Supreme Court agreed {{to hear the case}} in 1977, Price disregarded the advice of her lawyer and accepted a settlement from NBC. She used the money to buy a house. Price died in 1983, in Lincoln County, Tennessee.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Theory {{indicates}} <b>that</b> <b>prices</b> {{may serve}} as signals of unknown product quality. The relevant implication is <b>that</b> <b>prices</b> remain above marginal cost. Price signaling may also occur when buyers have a return option or money-back guarantee. Intuitively, sellers that deviate from a <b>price</b> <b>that</b> conveys full information by setting a higher price will have their products returned and suffer losses. Absent in the literature are any empirical studies to support the theoretical findings. This paper provides empirical results from an online used computer exchange to offer support for the theory of price signaling.

40|$|Pay {{what you}} want (PWYW) is a new {{participative}} pricing mechanism in which consumers have maximum control over the price they pay.
