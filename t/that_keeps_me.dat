She stated that [...] "the tune rides a {{grinding}} R beat" [...] as Jackson sings in a [...] "plaintive falsetto": [...] "My life has taken me beyond the planets and the stars/ And you're the only one that could take me this far/ I'll be forever searching for your love." [...] Kaufman noted that Jackson became more forceful during the chorus, when he sang, [...] "You're the one that makes me strong / I can't make it another day / You're the fire <b>that</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>me</b> warm / I can't make it another day." [...] The journalist also noted the lyrical and melodical similarities between [...] "Another Day" [...] and [...] "Storm", which features Kravitz singing, [...] "I walked away but I was wrong / You're the one <b>that</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>me</b> strong / You're the fire <b>that</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>me</b> warm / How will I get through this storm?" ...|$|E

[...] I eat three hearty meals a day and my {{favorite}} diversion now is playing pinocle. I play it every night. It's great sport for us old-timers." [...] Gore died in Utica, New York {{at the age of}} 79, after having lived in Nutley, New Jersey the previous 13 years.|$|E

[...] However, according to This Is The Noise <b>That</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>Me</b> Awake, an autobiography of the band, Vig wrote in his 1993 studio journal about the creative process; of working for long periods of time, [...] "without coming up with anything cool... and when you least expect it, it all falls into place." [...] The name derives from the last line of this entry: [...] "I hope that all this garbage will become something beautiful!".|$|E

[...] On the album's sound, Conley revealed that the group purposefully [...] "kept it simple," [...] relying solely on two guitars, bass and drums, attempting to create [...] "a raw album" [...] in the process. After finishing recording the material, Conley referred to it as [...] "quite different" [...] compared to In Reverie. The album's sound has been described as emo, pop, pop punk and power pop.|$|E
