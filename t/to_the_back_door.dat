25|$|Charmaine's {{body was}} {{initially}} stowed {{in the coal}} cellar of Midland Road until Fred was released from prison. He would later bury her naked body in the yard close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> of the flat, and although he remained adamant he had not dismembered this particular victim, a subsequent autopsy suggested the body had been severed at the hip (although this damage may {{have been caused by}} building work Fred conducted at the property in 1976). In addition, several bones—particularly patellae, finger, wrist, toe and ankle bones—were missing from her skeleton, leading to the speculation the missing parts had been retained as keepsakes (this would prove to be a distinctive discovery in all the autopsies of the victims exhumed in 1994).|$|E
2500|$|Shinwell, {{intent on}} the {{destruction}} of the Fitzwilliams and [...] "the privileged rich", decreed that the mining would continue <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> of Wentworth, the family's East Front. What followed saw the mining of [...] of lawns and woods, the renowned formal gardens and the show-piece pink shale driveway (a by-product of the family's collieries). Ancient trees were uprooted and the debris of earth and rubble was piled [...] high in front of the family's living quarters.|$|E
2500|$|A gifted salesman, Montague founded Gatehill Beco in 1958 aged 26 on an {{investment}} of £100, selling electric wire and later making cheap electric boiling rings: [...] "I {{used to make the}} goods, sell them, deliver them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door,</b> and then go round to the front to collect the money." [...] After he received a large order he could not fulfil himself, Montague sought out a large corporate, and eventually sold out to Valor in 1962, of which he then became a Director and then managing director.|$|E

She takes the hands of her boys and slowly walks out into Neverland. The living room and back garden transform into Neverland and Sylvia continues to walk on her own.|$|R

2500|$|There are {{two rooms}} in the {{northwest}} corner of the building. Both are approximately 12 feet by 12 feet. [...] The rooms have 13-foot ceilings and the same lath and plaster walls and wainscoting as the sanctuary. [...] The rooms have hanging glass-globe lights that are original to the building. [...] A hallway runs from the sanctuary along the northeast corner of the building <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door.</b> [...] It also provides access to a restroom and an office area that was once the church organ's mechanical room.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{hearings}} held on September 10, 1943, FCC Chairman James L. Fly roundly denounced {{the policy of}} the Blue Network in refusing to sell airtime, but granting air time for free, to proponents of controversial broadcasts. [...] He colorfully described the policy as chasing would-be purchasers {{from the front of the}} shop, but [...] "directing them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> for a handout." [...] Mark Woods, the head of the Blue Network, defended the policy, stating that it was in compliance with the NAB code. [...] When Edward J. Noble testified at {{the hearings}} held on September 20, 1943, he was questioned closely by Chairman Fly as to the policies regarding the refusal to sell air time to labor organizations, cooperatives and other special interest groups. [...] Noble was directed by Chairman Fly at this hearing to submit a statement as to what the policy would be of the Blue Network in terms of [...] "the expansion of the mechanisms of free speech." [...] On October 3, 1943, Noble released a letter to the FCC in which it was stated that the Blue Network would meet [...] "with an open mind" [...] all requests for broadcasting time, [...] "considering each on the merits", and excluding none on the basis of ideas or personality. Certainly, not all were pleased by Chairman Fly's stance. [...] Columnist David Lawrence, in his October 7, 1943 column, thought that the FCC had overstepped its authority in attempting to force the Blue Network to change its policies regarding the sale of airtime.|$|E
