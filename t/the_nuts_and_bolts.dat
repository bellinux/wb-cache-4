King {{initially}} approached series co-star David Duchovny and {{informed him that}} he loved the show and desired to write an episode. Eventually, he called series creator Chris Carter and expressed his desire to write an episode of Millennium instead. Carter agreed, but once more, King {{changed his mind and}} it was decided that he would write an episode of The X-Files. King sent various drafts to Carter from his home in Maine; the two individuals never actually met one another. King's original story had some issues that Carter rewrote. Carter explained, [...] "Stephen wasn't used to writing for Mulder and Scully [...] the Mulder-and-Scully story in his original draft didn't quite work". Carter separated Mulder and Scully in the finalized draft and helped to finalize the script, hence their dual writing credit on the episode. Kim Manners, the director for the episode, later said, [...] "I was very excited to be able to direct a Stephen King piece, and when it was all said and done, there was very little Stephen King left in it. <b>The</b> <b>nuts</b> <b>and</b> <b>bolts</b> were his, but that was really one of Chris' scripts." [...] Unbeknownst to either Carter or King, the word [...] "Chinga" [...] can be considered a vulgar Spanish colloquialism.|$|E

Whereas Gilchrist acknowledged that the show gives the impression of it being only for women, he stated that he can attest to its universal, equal-opportunity appeal, assessing that the show [...] "explores the medical world with both a sense of testosterone-fueled intensity and estrogen-laced sensitivity" [...] and deserved to have viewers from both genders, championing its merits. In response to the bomb story arc, he called the two episodes [...] "juicy", while assessing that they [...] "followed a story line that not only explained the series up to that point, but featured all of the characters in their more or less purest from". Gilchrist provided an outlook on each character, describing Grey as a [...] "prodigiously talented but insecure surgeon, waylaid by her love for attending Derek Shepherd", while stating that Yang, [...] "an aggressively ambitious intern" [...] lacks knowledge on any topic, except medicine, comparing her to boyfriend Burke, described as her opposite. In response to George O'Malley's story line, he noted how his sensitive personality constantly results in difficulty in his path to becoming a proper surgeon.

The {{majority}} of the structural failures of mechanical structures and systems are found in joints rather than continuous material. Joints have historically consisted of assemblies involving <b>nuts,</b> <b>bolts,</b> screws, etc. <b>and</b> <b>the</b> design and analysis of these joints can be quite challenging. This work provides two baselines on the finite element modeling (PEM) methods and analysis of a <b>nut</b> <b>and</b> <b>bolt</b> joint. <b>The</b> first baseline involves a basic modeling method using linear calculation of 2 D plates and bar elements, and the second baseline involves {{one of the more}} complex methods using non-linear calculation of 3 D solids. The two methods are described for modeling of a joint for two test conditions, namely the double shear joint in tension with two different <b>bolt</b> sizes <b>and</b> two plate thicknesses. First, the simplified method of rigid elements and equivalent strength beam elements is considered. This technique lacks the simulation of bearing stresses, stress concentration at the <b>bolt</b> hole location, <b>and</b> bending stiffness of the bolt.

2500|$|The line of General Purpose (GP) Acme threads (ASME/ANSI B1.5-1997) are not {{designed}} to sustain external radial loads <b>and</b> both <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> <b>and</b> <b>bolt</b> are, ideally, independently supported, <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> by a linear guide and the screw by shaft bearings. This {{is due to the}} need to avoid [...] "wedging" [...] of the thread flanks when subjected to radial loads, which would contribute substantially to friction forces and thread wear. However, there is a centralizing Acme-thread standard (also specified in ASME/ANSI B1.5-1997) which caters to applications where the threads are not radially supported, where the roots and crests of opposing threads are designed to come into contact before the flanks do, under radial loads. This adds the requirement that the sum of the allowances and tolerances on the major diameters of <b>nut</b> <b>and</b> <b>bolt</b> be less than the sum of the allowances on the pitch diameters (PD); the drawback is that, for a given amount of end play (axial clearance, due solely to PD deviations), closer tolerances and cleaner work environment are necessitated in the application of a centralizing Acme thread.|$|R
