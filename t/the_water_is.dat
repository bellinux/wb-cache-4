50|$|In 1877 <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>was</b> {{brought to}} town by the {{fountain}} near the palace Jannoni. <b>The</b> <b>water</b> <b>was</b> channeled from <b>the</b> town Niforio.|$|R
50|$|Within this period, {{chemical}} properties of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>were</b> scientifically developed and <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>was</b> stated to have bicarbonate calcium-sodium composition {{as well as}} carbon dioxide.|$|R
5000|$|Traditionally, mineral <b>waters</b> <b>were</b> used or {{consumed}} {{at their}} spring sources, {{often referred to}} as [...] "taking the waters" [...] or [...] "taking the cure," [...] at places such as spas, baths, or wells. The term spa was used for a place where <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>was</b> consumed and bathed in; bath where <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>was</b> used primarily for bathing, therapeutics, or recreation; and well where <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>was</b> to be consumed.|$|R
5|$|Pichilemu {{has several}} {{expansive}} dark sand beaches. <b>The</b> <b>water</b> <b>is</b> cool all year-round, and many tourists choose to swim {{at the shore}} break during the summer months. Common activities include bodyboarding, surfing, windsurfing, and kitesurfing.|$|E
5|$|The bulk of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>is</b> {{supplied}} by the summer monsoon rains, which fall from July to September.|$|E
5|$|The flooded Monte Ne {{has become}} a site of {{interest}} for scuba divers who dive by the amphitheater {{to get a look}} at the submerged structure. <b>The</b> <b>water</b> <b>is</b> moderately clear and temperatures comfortable.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was lucky}} the boat went over where <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>was</b> shallow," [...] said Giant. [...] "Had <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>been</b> deep perhaps we shouldn't have gotten back a thing." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Water</b> inside <b>the</b> aqueducts {{depended}} {{entirely on}} gravity. The raised stone channels in which <b>the</b> <b>water</b> travelled <b>were</b> slightly slanted. <b>The</b> <b>water</b> <b>was</b> carried directly from mountain springs. After {{it had gone}} through <b>the</b> aqueduct, <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>was</b> collected in tanks and fed through pipes to fountains, toilets, etc.|$|R
60|$|At {{this point}} the {{difference}} in <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>was</b> very marked, <b>the</b> line of oil, as it oozed out from a little bank, showing clearly, while above <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>was</b> pure.|$|R
5|$|They form {{over large}} lakes and oceans during cold air {{outbreaks}} while <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>is</b> still relatively warm, {{and can be}} an important mechanism in vertically transporting moisture. They are a component of sea smoke.|$|E
5|$|Water is {{essential}} to a thermal power station, heated to create steam to turn the steam turbines. Water used in the boilers is taken from two licensed boreholes on site. Once this water has been through the turbines it is cooled by condensers using water taken from the nearby River Ouse. Water is pumped from the river by a pumphouse on the river, north of the station. Once it has been through the condenser, <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>is</b> cooled {{by one of the}} natural draft cooling towers, with two towers serving each generating set. Once cooled, <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>is</b> discharged back into the river.|$|E
5|$|An {{independent}} study revealed {{the water to}} be radioactive and potentially dangerous to drink, initially surrounding the project with controversy. Jordan's Ministry of Water and Irrigation has stated that the radioactivity {{is not a problem}} because <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>is</b> to be diluted with an equal amount of water from other sources, although it remains disputed if this would be enough to bring the water up to standards. The Ministry said the {{independent study}} was inaccurate, as it did not test water from any of the wells that will be used in the project. The President of the Jordanian Geologists Association Bahjat Al Adwan stated that the radiation is present in the water in the form of Radon, and thus dissipates harmlessly when <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>is</b> exposed to air on the surface.|$|E
25|$|An {{analysis}} of <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>was</b> conducted in Porto, {{which found that}} <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>were</b> alkaline and gaseous in nature. Starting in 1885, these <b>waters</b> began to <b>be</b> bottled in a wood shed beside the pipes.|$|R
30|$|The {{results suggest}} that <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>are</b> {{supersaturated}} with carbonate minerals as the dissolved CO 2 gas pressure of <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>was</b> higher. A similar observation was made by Drever (1997) related to the present findings.|$|R
50|$|In 2008, a {{study of}} <b>the</b> <b>water</b> quality of <b>the</b> Niemica was carried out at its mouth by the Provincial Inspectorate of Environmental Protection (WIOŚ) of Szczecin. The {{physical}} and chemical properties of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>were</b> not deemed good and the ecological state of the river was deemed moderate; however, the amount of particularly dangerous substances in <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>was</b> good biological properties of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>were</b> described as first-class. In the overall two-stage score, <b>the</b> <b>water</b> quality of <b>the</b> Niemica was deemed to be poor.|$|R
5|$|Crossing <b>the</b> <b>Water</b> <b>is</b> full of {{perfectly}} realised works. Its most striking impression is of a front-rank {{artist in the}} process of discovering her true power. Such is Plath's control that the book possesses a singularity and certainty which should make it as celebrated as The Colossus or Ariel.|$|E
5|$|Enhanced {{geothermal}} systems (EGS) actively inject {{water into}} wells {{to be heated}} and pumped back out. <b>The</b> <b>water</b> <b>is</b> injected under high pressure to expand existing rock fissures to enable the water to freely flow in and out. The technique was adapted from oil and gas extraction techniques. However, the geologic formations are deeper and no toxic chemicals are used, reducing the possibility of environmental damage. Drillers can employ directional drilling to expand {{the size of the}} reservoir.|$|E
5|$|In 1544 {{products}} of Roman lead {{working in the}} area were discovered. The lead mines across the Mendips have produced contamination of the water emerging from the underground caverns at Wookey Hole. The lead in <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>is</b> believed to have affected {{the quality of the}} paper produced.|$|E
50|$|However, {{the source}} soon proved {{unsatisfactory}} for domestic use, because <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>was</b> high in silt, salt and gypsum. Drilled wells also proved unsuitable, because <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>was</b> either hard and salty or ran dry after {{a relatively short}} time.|$|R
5000|$|The word 'Narayana' means [...] "The one who {{rests on}} <b>water's</b> of creation". <b>The</b> Manusmriti states, <b>The</b> <b>waters</b> <b>are</b> called [...] "narah", for <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>are,</b> indeed, {{produced}} by Nara-Narayana (the first Being); {{as they were}} his first residence [...] "ayana", he is called Narayana.|$|R
60|$|When we returned, {{we found}} that <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>was</b> pouring through his partition, making the room a lake of mud. And, as <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>was</b> rising rapidly below, and the boat was keeling over more and more, {{we thought it was}} time to leave, and we left.|$|R

5|$|Males become {{sexually mature}} at 18 years. Upon {{reaching}} sexual maturity, males move to higher latitudes, where <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>is</b> colder and feeding is more productive. Females remain at lower latitudes. Males reach their full size at about age 50.|$|E
5|$|The city draws {{its water}} supply from the Kiskatinaw River, 18km (11mi) west of town. Before {{reaching}} the city, <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>is</b> pumped through a settling pond, two storage ponds, and a treatment plant {{where it is}} flocculated, filtered, and chlorinated. The city also provides drinking water for Pouce Coupe and rural residents. Sewage is processed by a lagoon system east of town and released into the Pouce Coupe River.|$|E

5|$|The heat {{needed for}} geyser {{formation}} comes from magma {{that needs to}} be near the surface of the earth. The fact that geysers need heat much higher than normally found near the earth's surface is the reason they are associated with volcanoes or volcanic areas. The pressures encountered at the areas where <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>is</b> heated make the boiling point of the water much higher than at normal atmospheric pressures.|$|E
