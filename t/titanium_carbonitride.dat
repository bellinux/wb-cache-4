The paper {{presents}} {{the characteristics of}} intermetallic phases occurring in heat-resistant cast austenitic 0. 3 % C- 30 % Ni- 18 % Cr steel with additions of niobium and titanium.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Austenitic {{stainless}} steels are used extensively throughout power stations in high temperature {{applications such as}} superheater tubes and fuel rod guides. For these applications, welding is often required to join sections of components or pipes/tubes due to their large sizes and lengths. In this paper, samples of a cast niobium stabilised stainless steel welded to a wrought 321 stainless steel were investigated. The sections were joined together using an autogenous Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) weld. The effects of long term ageing at 750 °C for up to 4000 hours have been studied. The ageing treatments were conducted in an inert atmosphere. Compositional changes and precipitates have been investigated using SEM with EDX and EBSD analysis. Niobium dissolved completely into the weld melt however it is observed to precipitate back out during long term ageing. <b>Titanium</b> <b>carbonitrides</b> however remained intact during the welding process, creating agglomerated particles throughout the weld bead.

They {{are widely used}} in cutting tools and {{in the preparation of}} advanced engineering ceramic-based composites. It has been found that TiC 0. 3 N 0. 7 is a precursor of carbon nitride (C 3 N 4) which has a structure similar to that of Si 3 N 4 and a hardness comparable to diamond. Due to the exciting potential of C 3 N 4, a large effort has been put into synthesizing it. However to date, the synthesis of C 3 N 4 as a crystalline material has not been achieved. This thesis work aims to crystallize C 3 N 4 on SiC and Si 3 N 4 substrates. Four different mixtures were studied in this project: TiC 0. 3 N 0. 7 /Si 3 N 4 and TiC 0. 7 N 0. 3 /SiC with different molar ratios (2 : 1) and (1 : 1). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Thermogravimetry (TG) were first used in both nitrogen and argon gas in order to study the thermal behaviour of the mixtures and X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used afterwards to determine the composition of the new phases. DSC/TG results show that in argon atmosphere, the mixtures TiC 0. 3 N 0. 7 : Si 3 N 4 (2 : 1) and TiC 0. 7 N 0. 3 : SiC (2 : 1) decompose at 1300 °C. While they decompose at 1450 °C in nitrogen atmosphere. XRD results indicate that at 1450 °C, TiC 0. 3 N 0. 7 : Si 3 N 4 with molar ratios (2 : 1) and (1 : 1) decompose to SiC and TiN. Besides that, TiC 0. 7 N 0. 3 : SiC with molar ratio (2 : 1) decomposes to Si 3 N 4 and Ti 2 N.

40|$|Laser {{surfacing}} in {{the form}} of cladding, alloying, and modifications are gaining widespread use because of its ability to provide high deposition rates, low thermal distortion, and refined microstructure due to high solidification rates. Because of these advantages, laser surface alloying is considered a prime candidate for producing ultra-hard coatings through the establishment or in situ formation of composite structures. Therefore, a program was conducted by the Applied Research Laboratory, Pennsylvania State University and Oak Ridge National Laboratory to develop the scientific and engineering basis for performing laser-based surface modifications involving the addition of hard particles, such as carbides, borides, and nitrides, within a metallic matrix for improved wear, fatigue, creep, and corrosion resistance. This has involved the development of advanced laser processing and simulation techniques, along with the refinement and application of these techniques for predicting and selecting materials and processing parameters for the creation of new surfaces having improved properties over current coating technologies. This program has also resulted {{in the form}}ulation of process and material simulation tools capable of examining the potential for the formation and retention of composite coatings and deposits produced using laser processing techniques, as well as positive laboratory demonstrations in producing these coatings. In conjunction with the process simulation techniques, the application of computational thermodynamic and kinetic models to design laser surface alloying materials was demonstrated and resulted in a vast improvement in the formulation of materials used for producing composite coatings. The methodology was used to identify materials and to selectively modify microstructures for increasing hardness of deposits produced by the laser surface alloying process. Computational thermodynamic calculations indicated {{that it was possible to}} induce the precipitation of <b>titanium</b> <b>carbonitrides</b> during laser surface alloying provided there was sufficient amount of dissolved titanium, carbon, and nitrogen in the liquid steel. This was confirmed experimentally by using a powder mixture of 431 -martensitic steel, titanium carbide powder, and nitrogen shielding, during laser deposition to produce deposits exhibiting relatively high hardness (average surface hardness of 724 HV). The same approach was extended to direct diode laser processing and similar microstructures were attained. The above analysis was extended to develop an in-situ precipitation of Ti(CN) during laser deposition. The Ti addition was achieving by mixing the 431 martensitic steel powders with ferro-titanium. The dissolution of nitrogen was achieved by using 100 % nitrogen shielding gas, which was indicated by thermodynamic analysis. Demonstrations were also conducted utilizing the tools developed during the program and resulted in several viable composite coating systems being identified. This included the use of TiC and ferro-titanium in martensitic-grade stainless steel matrix material with and without the use of active N 2 shielding gas, WC hard particles in a martensitic-grade stainless steel matrix material, WC and BN in a nickel-based matrix material, and WC in highly alloyed iron-based matrix. Although these demonstrations indicated the potential of forming composite coatings, in certain instances, the intended industrial applications involved unique requirements, such as coating of internal surfaces, which hindered the full development of the improved coating technology. However, it is believed that the addition of common hard particles, such as WC or TiC, to matrix material representing martensitic grades of stainless steel offer opportunities for improved performance at relatively low material cost...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{main purpose}} of this paper was to develop hybrid PVD {{technology}} of deposition wear resistant, multilayer coatings onto diffusion-hardened Ti 6 Al 4 V titanium alloy. Titanium and its alloys are desirable materials in modern constructions and vehicles. They have a high specific strength and very good corrosion resistance and biocompatibility. On the other hand, they have a low load-bearing capacity and poor tribological properties, as, for example, high friction coefficient, low resistance to adhesive and abrasive wear and tendency to galling. Development of multiplex coatings depositions techniques is vital for expanding of areas of titanium alloys usage. Design/methodology/approach: In the present work a new approach to coatings deposition onto diffusion hardened in glow discharge plasma (in Ar+O 2 atmosphere) Ti 6 Al 4 V titanium alloy was proposed by means of a hybrid PVD method including three coatings deposition methods: Reactive Magnetron Sputtering (RMS), Filtered Cathodic Arc Evaporation (FCAE) and Pulsed Cathodic Arc Deposition (PCAD). The main aim of the work was to develop multilayer coatings combined of sublayers of <b>titanium</b> or chromium <b>carbonitrides</b> or of pure, hard carbon ones. Findings: It was concluded from the results of investigations that not every proposed multilayer structure ensure good frictional properties of Ti 6 Al 4 V alloy even when the coating posses very high hardness.

The wear rate of the coated carbide tools for the wood-chip cement board increased more rapidly than that of the hardboard with increasing densities.

40|$|Basic aim of {{the present}} {{doctorate}} thesis is the production of alloyed coatings {{on the surface of}} different types of steel, using the plasma - transferred arc (PTA) welding technique. In particular, while trying to nitride these coatings, we found the best welding parameters for the PTA technique. Additionally, the already nitrided coatings were reinforced with hard TiB 2 particles, so as to increase both their anti-friction and anti-corrosive behavior. Firstly, the production of four different coatings on the surface of carbon steel is achieved by using TiB 2 and B powder. According to the microstructure study, the coatings’ microstructure consists of proeutectic titanium borides, which are uniformly spread all over the eutectic matrix of ferrite and eutectic borides. The addition of boron to the coating leads to increased hardness, due to the simultaneous existence of FeB and TiB 2. Finally, by using a pin-on-disk apparatus with a ball of tool steel or Al 2 O 3 revealed that the %wt of free B in the coatings affected their tribological behaviour. Especially, an increase of B led to a decrease of the wear rate. Next, following the microstructure study of the Fe - Cr - N coatings, their anti-corrosive properties are described and studied extensively. The basic aim was to be found if it was possible for a carbon steel to absorb nitrogen, since it is known that the solubility of nitrogen in this type of steel is very low. The experiments showed that an increase of the %wt of chromium on the surface of a carbon steel led to an easier and smoother absorption of the nitrogen contained in the shielding gas. The percentage of austenite increased proportionally with the increase in chromium and nitrogen percentage. The existence of chromium nitrides or sigma - phase deteriorated the anti-corrosive behavior of the produced coatings, since chromium did not spread uniformly through the whole matrix. In a next step, the production of coatings with 100 % austenitic microstructure and with low nickel content is described. Especially, the nitrogen of the shielding gas substituted the nickel in the crystal lattice. The examination of these coatings using X - Ray Diffraction technique proved that their microstructure was indeed 100 % austenitic. Moreover, the nitrides existed only in the coatings with the highest chromium content and with other alloying elements (Mn, Mo). Once again, the produced nitrides and sigma - phase deteriorated the anti-corrosive behaviour of the produced coatings. Moreover, the production of a coating with super-austenitic microstructure on the surface of an austenitic stainless steel AISI 316 L is thoroughly studied. The chemical composition of this coating was the following: 24 % Cr, 18 % Ni, 5 % Mo and 0, 4 % N (the rest was the %wt Fe). The electrochemical and chemical corrosion experiments proved that this coating has a better anti-corrosive behavior compared to that of the AISI 316 L substrate and slightly worse comparing to that of a super-austenitic material used as reference. In the final Chapter, there is a description of the production of a coating using pure TiB 2 powder and nitrogen from the shielding gas, in order to study its microstructure and its anti-corrosive behaviour. As it is widely known, the existence of <b>titanium</b> nitrides or <b>carbonitrides</b> in a metal matrix leads to increased anti-corrosive and anti-friction behaviour. Following this study, there is a comparison between the produced coating and the coating with pure TiB 2, regarding their anti-corrosive and anti-friction behaviour. ...|$|R

Properties such as thickness, roughness, and hardness were characterized {{using a variety of}} techniques, including glow-discharge optical emission spectrometry (GD-OES) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A crossed-cylinders wear-testing machine was used to investigate the performances of both coatings under lubrication. The effect of coatings on the performance of lubricants under a range of wear-test conditions was also examined. Degradation of lubricants during tribological testing was explored by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. <br /...|$|E
40|$|<b>Titanium</b> <b>carbonitride</b> top-layers were {{prepared}} by selectively implanting 80 keV C+ ions into a physical-vapour-deposited TiN coating 2. 8 -mu-m thick. Rutherford-backscattering {{analysis showed that}} the implanted carbon depth distribution was the one predicted by the TRIM 87 calculation and {{that part of the}} implanted carbon had diffused out from the gaussian-like distribution towards the surface, where an ion-beam-assisted deposition of an ultrathin carbon overlayer had grown. For doses going from 2. 8 x 10 (16) to 7. 8 x 10 (16) ions cm- 2 the effect of the carbon implantation on the fretting wear behaviour was investigated. Friction and wear measurements demonstrated a well-defined difference between as-plated TiN and carbon-implanted TiN. Related to the carbon implantation, it was observed that a low friction coefficient during break-in corresponds to a lower fretting wear damage. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{microstructure}} and {{properties of}} austempered ductile iron (ADI) strengthened with nanosized addtives of titanium nitride + <b>titanium</b> <b>carbonitride</b> (TiN + TiCN), titanium nitride TiN and cubic boron nitride cBN are investigated. The TiN, TiCN and cBN, nanosized particles are coated by electroless nickel coating EFTTOM-NICKEL {{prior to the}} edition to the melt. The spheroidal graphite iron samples are undergoing an austempering, including heating at 900 оС for an hour, after that isothermal retention at 280 оС, 2 h and 380 оС, 2 h. The metallographic analysis by optical metallographic microscope GX 41 OLIMPUS and hardness measurements by Vickers Method are performed. The structure of the austempered ductile iron consists of lower bainite and upper bainite. Experimental investigation of the wear by fixed abrasive are also carried out. The influence of the nanosized additives on the microstructure, mechanical and tribological properties of the austempered ductile irons (ADI) is studied...|$|E
40|$|A {{mechanically}} induced self-sustaining reaction (MSR) {{has been}} successfully employed for manufacturing powdered cermets based on Ti, Ti–Ta and Ti–Nb carbonitrides using Co as the binder phase and Mo 2 C as the sintering additive. The powders were sintered by hot-pressing, and complete chemical, microstructural and mechanical characterizations were performed on the densified cermets. When elemental Ta, Nb and/or Mo 2 C {{were added to the}} initial raw mixture submitted to the MSR process, smaller ceramic grains were observed after sintering, which suggested that ceramic particle growth was hindered by the presence of Ta, Nb and/or Mo in the host <b>titanium</b> <b>carbonitride</b> structure. Nanoindentation measurements enabled the determination of the hardness of the ceramic and binder phases, and values in the range of 26 – 29 GPa and 14 – 16 GPa were found, respectively. The high hardness values of the binder were related to the formation of intermetallic phases. Peer reviewe...|$|E
