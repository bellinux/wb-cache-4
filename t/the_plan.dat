5|$|Also {{included}} in <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> is an outline for raising awareness about human trafficking across Canada. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> specifically mentions TruckSTOP, {{a campaign of}} Persons Against the Crime of Trafficking in Humans Ottawa, as being integral to <b>the</b> <b>plan.</b> According to <b>the</b> <b>plan,</b> the CBSA is responsible for informing foreigners about human trafficking because of their increased vulnerability. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> includes a provision {{for the government to}} partner with NGOs that oppose human trafficking. Although Smith said that human trafficking would be more effectively combatted if Canada's prostitution laws were reformed to align with those of Sweden, criminalizing the purchasing rather than the selling of sex, the NAP-CHT does not make such legislative recommendations. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> enables immigration officers to issue temporary residence permits to foreigners victimized by human trafficking in Canada, thereby providing these victims with opportunities to receive aid.|$|E
5|$|Although no HV attack {{occurred}} in the area during the UNPROFOR mandate, elements of <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> were used by the 3rd Battalion of the PPCLI as the HV clashed with the Army of the Republic of Serb Krajina (ARSK) in the January 1993 Operation Maslenica. The 2nd Battalion of the PPCLI implemented <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> in March 1993 to demonstrate UNPROFOR resolve. The UNPROFOR Sector West deputy commander considered <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> impractical except for deterrence, due to security concerns.|$|E

50|$|Three further Acts {{related to}} {{planning}} {{are associated with}} this primary act: <b>The</b> <b>Planning</b> (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, <b>the</b> <b>Planning</b> (Hazardous Substances) Act 1990, and <b>the</b> <b>Planning</b> (Consequential Provisions) Act 1990. These four Acts {{are referred to as}} <b>the</b> <b>Planning</b> Acts.

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>plans,</b> however, {{have two}} problems, {{explained}} as follows. The first problem concerns the inherent characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>plans</b> {{of child care}} and education. They are not absolute but hypothetic <b>plans.</b> <b>The</b> <b>plans</b> are devised not by a specific individual but {{by a group of}} nursery teachers who are equally involved in the formation, revision, and evaluation of <b>the</b> <b>plans.</b> This process allows child care and education practices to develop more creatively. On the other hand, self-evaluation is personal and subjective, and it is not powerful enough to start massive changes desired in <b>the</b> <b>plans</b> of child care and education. Furthermore, self-evaluation stifles creativity of the practices of child care and education by exaggerating <b>the</b> <b>plans</b> of child care and education as faultless, and prevents <b>the</b> <b>plans</b> from becoming scientifically valid through the practices of child care and education.|$|R
5|$|In 1994, the United States, Russia, the European Union (EU) and the UN {{sought to}} replace the Vance plan, which brought in the UNPROFOR. They {{formulated}} the Z-4 Plan giving Serb-majority areas in Croatia substantial autonomy. After numerous and frequently uncoordinated changes to the proposed plan, including leaking of its draft elements to the press in October, the Z-4 Plan was presented on 30 January 1995. Neither Croatia nor the RSK liked <b>the</b> <b>plan.</b> Croatia was concerned that the RSK might accept it, but Tuđman realised that Milošević, who would ultimately make the decision for the RSK, would not accept <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> for fear that it would set a precedent for a political settlement in Kosovoallowing Croatia to accept <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> with little possibility {{for it to be}} implemented. The RSK refused to receive, let alone accept, <b>the</b> <b>plan.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 1 October, Galbraith {{informed}} Croatian President Franjo Tuđman of <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> {{without providing}} any details. Similarly, Ahrens and Eide informed RSK president Milan Martić. Although early Z-4 Plan negotiations were planned without actually disclosing <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> to Croatia and the RSK, elements of <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> were leaked to Belgrade and Zagreb newspapers in mid-October. According to Florence Hartmann, in October representatives of Tuđman {{and those of}} Serbian president Slobodan Milošević met in Graz, Austria to discuss the proposed reintegration of the RSK into Croatia and {{their opposition to the}} Z-4 Plan. Tuđman disliked <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> because it envisaged a Serb state in Croatia, while Milošević saw it as a dangerous precedent that could be applied to majority non-Serb or ethnically-mixed regions of rump Yugoslavia, such as Kosovo, Vojvodina and the Sandžak.|$|E
5|$|On March 24, Zahorchak's {{proposal}} for district wide reform {{will be put}} before the Allentown School Board. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> for reform is based primarily on financial expectations within the district.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>plan</b> {{was first}} {{presented}} to the President of Serbia, Slobodan Milošević. Milošević found <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> wholly acceptable and promised he would ensure {{the leadership of the}} RSK eventually supported it. He endorsed <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> because it ensured the preservation of Serbian territorial gains of 1991, retained Croatian Serb administration of the areas where the peacekeepers would be deployed and allowed the JNA to shift its focus to Bosnia and Herzegovina. Vance then met Yugoslav defence minister JNA General Veljko Kadijević, who also endorsed <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> and was apparently urged by Milošević to do so. After <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> was accepted by Croatian President Franjo Tuđman, the Geneva Accord was signed by Tuđman, Milošević and Kadijević in Geneva, Switzerland, on 23 November 1991. The Accord was a precondition for the deployment of the UN peacekeeping force. It comprised four provisions; the end of the Croatian blockade of JNA barracks, the withdrawal of JNA personnel and equipment from Croatia, the implementation of a ceasefire and the facilitation of the delivery of humanitarian aid.|$|E
5|$|A {{few weeks}} after the conference, Mihailović sent Ostojić to {{establish}} a forward headquarters in Kalinovik in south-eastern Bosnia. Ostojić was to command an operation aimed at encircling and destroying Partisan forces in Bosnia, which was to use Chetnik units serving as Italian auxiliaries in Herzegovina and Montenegro, as well as other Chetnik units in the Lika region, northern Bosnia and northern Dalmatia. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> was predicated on an Allied landing on the Dalmatian coast, which Mihailović believed was imminent. The outline concept was that the Chetniks would set up a corridor through the Italian occupied zone of the NDH as far as the Partisan liberated area in western Bosnia and Lika, neutralising the Italians through a combination of vague promises, encouraging them to surrender, and disarming them if necessary. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> was finalised by early December 1942 at Mihailović's headquarters in Montenegro, and operations were planned to commence on 5 January 1943. However, <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> assumed that Mihailović's forces were unified, which they were not, and also that his authority extended to many more Chetniks than it did in reality.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{reindeer}} husbandry’s district plans, and are industry’s own official document. They provide information about the reindeer husbandry practiced in the reindeer grazing district. <b>The</b> <b>plans</b> should provide information necessary for <b>the</b> public <b>planning</b> and should function {{as a tool to}} reduce conflicts and enhance cooperation among reindeer herders and other users. I have examined the reasons why <b>the</b> district <b>plans</b> have not functioned as intended by looking at the experiences and expectations with <b>the</b> <b>plans.</b> Methods used are depth-interviews, document analysis and participating in meetings. <b>The</b> <b>plans</b> have not so far prevented conflicts, nor enhanced the cooperation and communication between the reindeer herders and the municipalities {{because of the lack of}} awareness of <b>the</b> <b>plans.</b> In addition to unawareness about <b>the</b> <b>plans,</b> I argue that the challenges related to <b>the</b> <b>plans</b> can be explained by insufficient knowledge about reindeer husbandry and different “glances” on the tension between flexibility and rigidity. In particular, the issue of classification of land illustrate this tension...|$|R
5|$|Although the {{administration}} of Harry Truman had become convinced that the Guatemalan government had been penetrated by communists, it relied on purely diplomatic and economic means to try and reduce the communist influence, {{at least until the}} end of its term. The United States had refused to sell arms to the Guatemalan government after 1944; in 1951 it began to block weapons purchases by Guatemala from other countries. In 1952 Truman became sufficiently convinced of the threat posed by Árbenz to start planning a covert overthrow, titled Operation PBFORTUNE. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> had originally been suggested by the US supported dictator of Nicaragua, Anastasio Somoza García, who said that if he were given weapons, he could overthrow the Guatemalan government. Truman gave the CIA permission to go ahead with <b>the</b> <b>plan,</b> without informing the state department. The CIA placed a shipment of weapons on a vessel owned by the United Fruit Company, and the operation was paid for by Rafael Trujillo and Marcos Pérez Jiménez, the right-wing anti-communist dictators of the Dominican Republic and Venezuela, respectively. The operation was to be led by Carlos Castillo Armas. However, the US state department discovered the conspiracy, and secretary of state Dean Acheson persuaded Truman to abort <b>the</b> <b>plan.</b>|$|E
