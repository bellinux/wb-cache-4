50|$|The {{publicly}} released specifications {{included a}} passenger capacity of 1,500, with 450 seated, in a fully air-conditioned train {{no longer than}} 205 m with {{a top speed of}} 145 km/h, and an energy efficiency as good as 24 kW·h per <b>train-kilometre.</b> Integration with platform screen doors is also expected. The capital value of the contract, which included construction of a depot at Old Oak Common, was estimated at around £1bn, the total value may be greater due to the winning bidder expected to undertake maintenance of the trains for three decades, the estimated lifespan of the fleet.|$|E
30|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} forms of light rail system in operation; however, this paper looks at the one operated by Nexus throughout Newcastle and the surrounding area. The Tyne and Wear Metro fleet, despite having been in operation since {{the opening of the}} network in the 1980 s, is in the top third in terms of overall energy efficiency per <b>train-kilometre</b> during operation [37]. There is an initiative in place to generate much of the electricity used by the Metro using renewable sources such as wind turbines and solar panels, with an aim to become a “ 100  % green energy transport network” in the future. It is estimated that 10 – 15  % of this energy could be generated at Metro stations [37]. There are no data available in the public domain regarding the actual value of Metro energy efficiency, and for a fair comparison with other modes such data would need to be analysed. The same can be said when looking at emissions of nitrous oxides and other harmful pollutants; the potential benefits cannot be properly evaluated without access to emissions data.|$|E

40|$|To scrutinise the {{plausible}} {{sources of}} poor performance for non-storable transport services, {{it is necessary}} to distinguish technical inefficiency from service ineffectiveness. This paper attempts to measure the performance of railways that produce passenger and freight services by two stochastic distance function approaches. A stochastic input distance function with an inefficiency effect is defined to evaluate technical efficiency; whereas a stochastic consumption distance function with an ineffectiveness effect is introduced to assess service effectiveness. The empirical analysis examines 39 worldwide railway systems over eight years (1995 - 2002) where inputs contain number of passenger cars, number of freight cars, and number of employees, while outputs contain passenger <b>train-kilometres</b> and freight <b>train-kilometres,</b> and consumptions contain passenger-kilometres and ton-kilometres. The findings show that railways' technical inefficiency and service ineffectiveness are negatively influenced by gross national income per capita, percentage of electrified lines, and line density. Overall, the railways in West Europe perform more efficiently and effectively than those in East Europe and Non-European regions. Strategies for ameliorating the operation of less-efficient and/or less-effective railways are proposed. © 2006 LSE and the University of Bath...|$|R
50|$|Cantus Verkehrsgesellschaft mbH (which {{translates}} roughly as Cantus Transport Company Ltd), {{based in}} Kassel {{is a joint}} subsidiary of Hessische Landesbahn (HLB) and Hamburger Hochbahn (HHA). The word cantus refers to a steel rail-wheel tyre and is written in all lower case in the company's style. The company took over local rail passenger services on four routes in December 2006 for ten years. After the re-tendering of the unchanged Northeast Hesse network on 15 June 2013 for 15 years from 11 December 2016, cantus was again awarded the contract on 24 March 2014. Since then, annual traffic of 3.9 million <b>train-kilometres</b> with 21 Stadler FLIRT electric multiple units has been operated.|$|R
40|$|The {{article focuses}} on the {{influences}} that a railway infrastructure has {{on the life of}} a given country. The role of railway transportation is viewed especially from the point of employment, quality of railway infrastructure and using a railways by passengers. It is comparing the length of the railway network to the numbers of railway employees which contains employees in the railway sector including the service related to transport operation, transport management, operability and modernization. It is also used an indicator which suitably adds the conversion of railway employees per <b>train-kilometres</b> (tkm), passenger-kilometres (pkm) and gross-ton-kilometres (gtkm). The research is concerned selected European countries. Keywords: Railway infrastructure, investment, the European Union, employment, the use of a railway syste...|$|R
50|$|The {{core network}} of Vogtlandbahn in the Vogtlandkreis, west Saxony and east Thuringia was re-tendered by the {{transport}} {{authority in the}} spring of 2010. The tendered Vogtland network includes the Hof-Falkenstein-Adorf, Mariánské Lázne-Plauen ob Bf-Zwickau Zentrum, Weischlitz-Gera and Zwickau Zentrum-Kraslice lines with an annual 3.16 million <b>train-kilometres.</b> Vogtlandbahn won the contract in September 2010, so the traffic in the Vogtland will continue to be operated by this company from December 2012 to December 2027. Regio-Shuttles, Desiros and RegioSprinters are used for these operations. The brand name in the core network is vogtlandbahn (in lower case), despite the renaming of the company as Die Länderbahn. At the timetable change on 8 December 2012, scheduled services ended between Zwotental and Adorf, which had recently only operated on weekends.|$|R
50|$|The Zweckverband Nahverkehr Westfalen-Lippe (local {{transport}} association of Westphalia-Lippe, NWL) published {{a call for}} tenders for the operation of passenger services on the Sauerland Network from December 2016 in the Official Journal of the European Union on 9 October 2012. As a result, Regional-Express services RE 17 and 57 and Regionalbahn services RB 52, 53 and 54 {{might have had a}} new operator. Some improvements are to be made on trains for the carriage of the disabled and there will be more space for bicycles, more guards, ticket machines on the trains rather than on the platforms, as well as improved connections in Menden (to Dortmund) and Schwerte (to Münster). It will involve about 5.6 million <b>train-kilometres</b> a year, at a cost of €9-10 per train-km, a total cost of about €50 to 55 million. Because the operation of the network is to be contracted for a period of 12 years, it will be worth more than €600 million.|$|R
