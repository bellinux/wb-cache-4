5|$|In January 1957, Diefenbaker {{took his}} place as Leader of the Official Opposition. In February, St. Laurent {{informed}} him that Parliament would be dissolved in April for an election on June 10. The Liberals submitted a budget in March; Diefenbaker attacked it for overly high taxes, failure to assist pensioners, {{and a lack of}} aid for the poorer provinces. Parliament was dissolved on April 12. St. Laurent was so confident of victory that he did not even bother <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>recommendations</b> to the Governor General to fill the 16 vacancies in the Senate.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Garfield {{administration}} assumed office in 1881, the Navy's condition had deteriorated still further. A review conducted {{on behalf of the}} new Secretary of the Navy, William H. Hunt, found that of 140 vessels on the Navy's active list, only 52 were in an operational state, of which a mere 17 were iron-hulled ships, including 14 aging Civil War era ironclads. Hunt recognized the necessity of modernizing the Navy, and set up an informal advisory board <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>recommendations.</b> Also to be expected, morale was considerably down; officers and sailors in foreign ports were all too aware that their old wooden ships would not survive long in the event of war. The limitations of the monitor type effectively prevented the United States from projecting power overseas, and until the 1890s the United States would have come off badly in a conflict with even Spain or the Latin American powers.|$|E
5|$|During his {{campaign}} and presidency, President George W. Bush endorsed {{the idea of}} background checks at gun shows. Bush's position was that the gun show loophole should be closed by federal legislation since the gun show loophole was created by previous federal legislation.

On January 8, 2008 he signed the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 (NIAA) into law. Goals and objectives that the NIAA sought to address included: The gap in information available to NICS about such prohibiting mental health adjudications and commitments. Filling these information gaps will better enable the system to operate as intended, to keep guns out of the hands of persons prohibited by federal or state law from receiving or possessing firearms.|$|E

5|$|For the 2009 {{legislative}} session, Kefalas {{was named}} to seats on the House Appropriations Committee, the House Finance Committee, and the House Health and Human Services Committee. Kefalas has named health care reform as his top priority and plans on introducing legislation to create a single-payer universal {{health care system in}} Colorado during the 2009 session. The bill was introduced as a proposal to create a 23-member commission <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>recommendations</b> as to how to implement a single-payer system, and was reported favorably out of a House committee. However, Kefalas was one vote short of the 33 necessary to pass the legislation out of the house, and in April, asked that the legislation be killed.|$|E
5|$|During {{his service}} as {{lieutenant}} governor, Beshear formed and chaired the Kentucky Tomorrow Commission, a privately financed group assembled <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>recommendations</b> for the state's future growth and development. The 30-person commission {{was formed in}} July 1984 and presented its report – containing more than 100 recommendations – in September 1986. Among the recommendations in the commission's report were several changes to the state constitution, adopted in 1891. The recommended changes included eliminating the offices of state treasurer, {{secretary of state and}} superintendent of public instruction, holding elections only in odd-numbered years instead of every year, and raising the term limit for the state's constitutional officers from one term to two consecutive terms. The state legislature showed little interest in calling a constitutional convention, however, and the commission's recommendations were not immediately adopted, though several have since been implemented. Other recommendations in the commission's report included the creation of lifelong learning programs, implementation of criminal justice reforms, and improvements in worker training. The commission was hailed by some as the most substantial undertaking by a lieutenant governor to date, but was panned by others as a move by Beshear to better position himself for a run for governor in 1987.|$|E
5|$|White ran unsuccessfully as a Nationalist for the House of Representatives seat of Maribyrnong in the 1925 elections. In 1927, {{he failed}} to win the Victorian Legislative Assembly seat of Prahran. Denied {{pre-selection}} as a Nationalist for the Senate the following year, he won the seat of Balaclava at a by-election held on 3August 1929. He succeeded retiring member William Watt. The United Australia Party (UAP) {{came to power in}} the 1931 elections and in March 1933 he was appointed Minister for Trade and Customs in the first Lyons Ministry, replacing Henry Gullett, who had stood down due to ill-health. White had given up the directorship of C.J. White & Sons the previous year. His portfolio was responsible for reducing tariffs and attempting to increase trade with Britain as opposed to the United States and Japan, and also with book and film censorship; for the latter he established an advisory board, chaired by Robert Garran, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>recommendations</b> to him. In 1934, White became Australian chairman of the Royal Life Saving Society, serving until 1951; he was also an active supporter of such organisations as Legacy and the Royal Flying Doctor Service.|$|E

25|$|Two {{competing}} {{proposals for}} an international body emerged during the Commission's meetings.

Philosophically opposed to the concept of an international parliament and convinced that international standards would lower the few protections achieved in the United States, Gompers proposed that the international labour body be authorized only <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>recommendations,</b> and that enforcement be left up to the League of Nations.
