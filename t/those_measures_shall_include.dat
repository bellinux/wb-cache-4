The State {{recognizes that}} the fight against {{terrorism}} requires a comprehensive approach, comprising political, economic, diplomatic, military, and legal means duly taking into account the root causes of terrorism without acknowledging these as justification for terrorist and/or criminal activities. Such <b>measures</b> <b>shall</b> <b>include</b> conflict management and post-conflict peace-building, addressing the roots of conflict by building state capacity and promoting equitable economic development. This statement elucidates that the Philippines government has realized that a strict military approach cannot be adequate solution when dealing with terrorist groups. In this sense, the Philippines government has decided to adopt a broader and more comprehensive approach rather than only applicating a military approach.|$|R

One of these regulatory measures concernes the Application Ratio, a coefficient defining what portion of the Maximum Matching Adjustment an insurance company can apply to the risk-free rates for discounting her obligations, given the matching properties of the assigned asset portfolio. In this paper we propose an optimization algorithm providing a reliable assessment of the Application Ratio.

60|$|But if it be {{proper to}} require {{as a test}} of {{admission}} to the political body an oath of allegiance to the Constitution of the United States and to the Union under it, why also to the laws and proclamations in regard to slavery? Those laws and proclamations were enacted and put forth for the purpose of aiding in the suppression of the rebellion. To give them their fullest effect {{there had to be a}} pledge for their maintenance. In my judgment, they have aided and will further aid the cause for which they were intended. To now abandon them would be not only to relinquish a lever of power, but would also be a cruel and an astounding breach of faith. I may add at this point that while I remain in my present position I shall not attempt to retract or modify the emancipation proclamation, nor shall I return to slavery any person who is free by the terms of that proclamation or by any of the acts of Congress. For these and other reasons it is thought best that support of these <b>measures</b> <b>shall</b> be <b>included</b> in the oath, and it is believed the Executive may lawfully claim it in return for pardon and restoration of forfeited rights, which he has clear constitutional power to withhold altogether or grant upon the terms which he shall deem wisest for the public interest. It should be observed also that this part of the oath is subject to the modifying and abrogating power of legislation and supreme judicial decision.|$|R
