500|$|Perry {{described}} [...] "Love Me" [...] as a song [...] "about loving yourself <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to be loved". Gundersen {{called it}} [...] "irresistibly catchy and energetic". The song {{was produced by}} Bloodshy. Sarkesian called it [...] "an interesting mix – the lyrics are dark, but the music is very dance-centric. At the very least, it'll do well in clubs". Montgomery stated that [...] "Love Me" [...] and [...] "International Smile" [...] both [...] "seem destined for the dance floors". The latter was inspired by Perry's friend Mia Moretti, and was compared to the songs on Perry's previous album. Lipshutz called it a [...] "straightforward pop-rock offering" [...] and described its guitar hook as [...] "kicky", adding that the song also includes a [...] "Melting Daft Punk-esque vocoder breakdown". Halperin stated that in the song, Perry sings the [...] "hooky" [...] line: [...] "Please fasten your seat belts and make sure your champagne glasses are empty".|$|E
500|$|Most {{or all of}} {{the episode}} was shot from September 11 to 23, 2007 and filming {{overlapped}} with the following episode. [...] The Tunisian desert scene was filmed on location in Oahu, Hawaii, {{like the rest of the}} episode, at a stone quarry with industrial fans blowing fake sand. [...] A typical Lost episode contains fifty visual effects shots. [...] Among scenes created entirely or partially with effects are the opening scene of [...] "Confirmed Dead", which shows what appears to be the wreckage of 815 underwater and the scene from Daniel's perspective as he parachutes from the helicopter to the ground. [...] In Frank's flashback, he drops a toy plane, which spirals into a small aquarium. [...] This shot was not intended to use effects; however, [...] "it's impossible to get a toy plane to spiral <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> it to", according to supervisor Mitch Suskin. [...] A tank with still water and rocks on the bottom was filmed and the plane was added in editing. [...] Suskin said that creating effects for [...] "Confirmed Dead" [...] "was slightly too leisurely" [...] because the episode aired over four months after post-production began.|$|E

Kirk was replaced as Prime Minister by Bill Rowling shortly afterwards. In the 1975 election, National ran {{on a platform of}} [...] "New Zealand – <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> It", a slogan Muldoon came up with himself, promising a generous national superannuation scheme to replace Kirk and Rowling's employer-contribution superannuation scheme (which the famous [...] "Dancing Cossack" [...] television advertisement implied would turn New Zealand into a communist state), and undertaking to fix New Zealand's [...] "shattered economy". Labour responded with a campaign called Citizens for Rowling, described by Muldoon as [...] "not even a thinly disguised" [...] attack on himself. Muldoon overwhelmed Rowling, reversing the 32–55 Labour majority into a 55–32 National majority.|$|E

2500|$|During CBS' {{coverage}} of the World Series, umpires were upset with the overhead replays being televised by CBS. Dave Phillips, the crew chief, said just prior to Game 2 that the umpires want [...] "CBS to be fair with their approach." [...] Rick Gentile, {{senior vice president for}} production for CBS Sports, said that Richie Phillips, the lawyer for the Major League Umpires Association, tried to call the broadcast booth during Saturday's game, but the call was not put through. Richie Phillips apparently was upset when Dave Phillips called the Philadelphia Phillies' Ricky Jordan out on strikes in the fourth inning, and a replay showed the pitch to be about 6inches outside. National League President Bill White, while using a CBS headset in the broadcast booth during Game 1, was overheard telling Gentile and the producer Bob Dekas, [...] "You guys keep using that camera <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>want.</b> Don't let Phillips intimidate you." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Impossible" [...] is a midtempo R ballad {{written by}} Arnthor Birgisson and Ina Wroldsen, {{in the musical}} key of A♭ major with a time {{signature}} in common time and a tempo of 92 beats per minute. The melody is to be played in a moderate tone and tempo. The song's backing track consists of a simple chord progression of A♭E♭D♭Fm7. It was conceived after Shontelle stated that she felt that radio was currently missing a [...] "heartbreak ballad". In an interview with J-14 magazine she said [...] "I {{knew that there was}} no song out there for heartbroken people. I just wanted to put a song out that gave people hope - things may not work out <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> them to, but you can move past it and everything is gonna be okay... draw the strength to carry on past a break up where you're the one in the embarrassing position." [...] Shontelle uses a vocal range from E♭3 to D♭5 in the song. Billboards Michael Menachem described her vocal precision as similar to that of Beyoncé's in [...] "Irreplaceable". Meanwhile, the production, helmed by Birgisson, was compared to Norwegian production team, StarGate who are, coincidentally, the team responsible for producing [...] "Irreplaceable".|$|E

5000|$|The trio knew {{director}} John Landis, {{who encouraged}} them to write a film based on their theatre sketches. They managed to put the film, called The Kentucky Fried Movie, in production in the late 1970s, and entered a movie set for the first time. David Zucker explains: [...] "It {{was the first time}} we had ever been on a movie set. We learned a lot. We learned that if <b>you</b> really <b>wanted</b> a movie to come out <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> it to, <b>you</b> had to direct. So on the next movie, Airplane!, we insisted on directing." [...] Filming took 34 days, mostly during August 1979. Jerry Zucker stood beside the camera during shooting, while David Zucker and Jim Abrahams would be watching the video feed to see how the film would look; they would confer after each take.|$|R

5000|$|As {{with many}} other Durutti Column LPs, Reilly dislikes the album, once telling a writer for The Quietus that he jokingly calls it [...] "Without Merit," [...] and reflecting: [...] "Without Mercy is a joke. ... It was all Tony Wilson's idea {{to make it more}} classical. He had {{aspirations}} that I should be taken more seriously. That never interested me. Everyone's obsessed with form. 'Is it avant-garde? Is it jazz?' It's just tunes." [...] He elaborated: [...] "That album was Tony Wilson saying to me, ‘You've done so many albums <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> to do them, and when <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> to do them, so just this once make this my record and do it my way.' He's one of my best friends, so of course I said yeah. And that's Without Mercy. There were all these studio classical musicians involved. For me it doesn't actually work. It was more of a learning process really." ...|$|R

Hip-hop purists have long sucked on the decade like a warm thumb, afraid of the cold, mean world that lay ahead. But CZARFACE, also the name for Deck and co.’s group, keeps matters as fresh. The album’s marquee—with names like Roc Marciano, Action Bronson, and Mr. Muthafuckin' eXquire—assures just that. “Cement 3’s,” “It’s Raw,” and “Poisonous Thoughts”―listed {{in the order of}} appearance of the guests mentioned―come off as love letters rather than industry rub-offs. If the above trio were operating in the late ‘90s, they’d be dropping similar heat."
