Returns were fed into systems that automatically extracted {{the range and}} velocity, and if the return was deemed interesting, the system automatically began a track for threat verification. During the threat verification phase, the radar spent more time examining the returns {{in an effort to}} accurately determine the trajectory and then ignored any objects that would fall outside its area.|$|E
5|$|The Batmobile has <b>two</b> <b>modes,</b> {{which can}} be {{switched}} at any time: Pursuit and Battle. Pursuit is for moving from area to area and completing specific driving challenges. In Battle mode, the Batmobile becomes more tank than car, allowing a full 360-degree range of movement, including strafing in any direction, while revealing the multiple weapon systems on board, including a Vulcan chain gun for quick damage, a 60mm hypervelocity cannon for fire support, anti-tank guided missiles for wide-ranging damage against multiple targets, and a non-lethal riot suppressor.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, <b>two</b> <b>mode</b> Q-learning, an {{extension}} of Q-learning, is used to stabilize the Zero Moment Point (ZMP) of a biped robot in the standing posture. In <b>two</b> <b>mode</b> Q-learning, the experiences of both success and failure of an agent are used for fast convergence. To demonstrate the effectiveness of <b>two</b> <b>mode</b> Q-learning against conventional Q-learning, the property of convergence is investigated through simulation in a grid world. This paper also presents the experimental results of the ZMP compensation in the standing posture of a biped robot. The external force generated from sagittal plane impacts to biped robot and the ZMP compensation scheme, based on <b>two</b> <b>mode</b> Q-learning, is employed. The effectiveness of <b>two</b> <b>mode</b> Q-learning is veri£ed {{by the use of}} real experiment...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} a possible scheme for entangling <b>two</b> <b>mode</b> thermal fields through the quantum erasing process, {{in which an}} atom is coupled with <b>two</b> <b>mode</b> fields via the interaction governed by the two-mode two-photon Jaynes-Cummings model. The influence of phase decoherence on the entanglement of <b>two</b> <b>mode</b> fields is discussed. It is found that quantum erasing process can transfer part of entanglement between the atom and fields to <b>two</b> <b>mode</b> fields initially in the thermal states. The entanglement achieved by fields heavily depends on their initial temperature and the detuning. The entanglement of stationary state is also investigated.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{feedback}} scheme {{for the production}} of <b>two</b> <b>mode</b> spin squeezing. We determine a general expression for the optimal feedback, which is also applicable to the case of single mode spin squeezing. The <b>two</b> <b>mode</b> spin squeezed states obtained via this feedback are optimal for j= 1 / 2, and are very close to optimal for j> 1 / 2. In addition, the master equation suggests a Hamiltonian that would produce <b>two</b> <b>mode</b> spin squeezing without feedback, and is analogous to the two-axis countertwisting Hamiltonian in the single mode case...|$|R
5|$|Because {{there is}} a {{temperature}} difference between the core and the surface, or photosphere, energy is transported outward. The <b>two</b> <b>modes</b> for transporting this energy are radiation and convection. A radiation zone, where energy is transported by radiation, is stable against convection and {{there is very little}} mixing of the plasma. By contrast, in a convection zone the energy is transported by bulk movement of plasma, with hotter material rising and cooler material descending. Convection is a more efficient mode for carrying energy than radiation, but it will only occur under conditions that create a steep temperature gradient.|$|E
5|$|Blaster Master has <b>two</b> <b>modes</b> of {{gameplay}} {{that depends}} on the situation and location of the player. The first mode is where the player controls SOPHIA in a two–dimensional platform mode; the second mode is where the player controls Jason while outside SOPHIA in either the same 2D platform mode or in a top-down perspective. Gameplay in the top-down perspective consists of a series of labyrinths in which players navigate and defeat enemies along the way. Gameplay is non-linear, and players must return to earlier levels in order to advance to later levels in the game. The objective is to complete all eight levels and destroy the mutants and their bosses with various weaponry such as guns, grenades, and special weapons.|$|E
5|$|Chocolatier is {{a casual}} {{strategy}} video game with action game elements, developed by Big Splash Games {{and published by}} PlayFirst. The game was released as a download on May 1, 2007 and was followed by CD-ROM release on September 27, 2007. Players {{assume the role of}} a young Chocolatier, who must navigate 14 cities around the globe while buying ingredients, manufacturing chocolates, and selling them to chocolate shops. <b>Two</b> <b>modes</b> of play are available: in story mode the player must rebuild an almost bankrupt chocolate empire and acquire 64 chocolate recipes from around the world; in free mode players start out with scant resources and must become successful chocolatiers.|$|E

5|$|Early on, {{the player}} {{is given the}} choice between three {{different}} game modes, each with unique cutscenes, puzzles to solve and locations to visit: the Team Path, the Wits Path, and the Fists Path. In the Team Path, protagonist Indiana Jones is joined by his partner Sophia Hapgood who will provide support throughout the game. The Wits Path features an abundance of complex puzzles, while the Fists Path focuses heavily on action sequences and fist fighting, the latter of which is completely optional in the other <b>two</b> <b>modes.</b> Atypical for LucasArts titles, {{it is possible for}} the player character to die at certain points in the game, though dangerous situations were designed to be easily recognizable. A score system, the Indy Quotient Points, keeps track of the puzzles solved, the obstacles overcome and the important objects found.|$|E
5|$|Soma Bringer is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game where players {{take control of}} members of a military unit dubbed Pharzuph Division 7. The three-dimensional environments are explored from a top-down perspective, and the overhead camera can be zoomed in and out on the playable character. Seven characters {{are available at the}} start of the game, with an eighth being unlocked later on. The game uses <b>two</b> <b>modes</b> of play. In single-player, the player controls the party leader while the two assigned companions are controlled using the game's artificial intelligence. In addition to the single-player mode, the game features cooperative (co-op) multiplayer. Activated through wireless connection, up to three players can freely explore environments and team up for dungeons.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} <b>two</b> <b>modes,</b> a single player story mode and a multi-player versus mode. The story mode follows the boxing careers {{of the main}} {{characters}} from the original series. All characters available to the player are from the Kamogawa Boxing Gym. Cut scenes are added in before and after matches as the main story telling device, and utilize the same character models as the fights. The game has six story arcs and begins with Makunouchi Ippo, the protagonist from the manga series. Story mode also unlocks more options in the versus mode as a player progresses through the story. Once a character has been played or a special technique learned, they become available in the versus mode. Likewise, once an opponent has been beaten, they are playable in the versus mode.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to give an {{overview}} of recent progress and development in humanoid robot, HanSaRam series. HanSaRam is a humanoid robot undergoing continual design and development in the Robot Intelligence Technology (RIT) Laboratory at KAIST. This paper also presents the experimental re-sults of the ZMP compensation in the walking and standing posture of HSR-IV. During walking motion, proportional ZMP compensation scheme is employed. A novel <b>two</b> <b>mode</b> Q-learning, which extends standard Q-learning, is used to compensate ZMP in the stand-ing posture. In the proposed <b>two</b> <b>mode</b> Q-learning, both the success and failure experiences of an agent is used for fast convergence.

5|$|Players {{navigate}} the witch protagonist through the 2D game world from a side-view perspective. Cauldron {{is divided into}} <b>two</b> <b>modes</b> of play: shooting while flying and jumping along platforms. Areas of the game world set on the surface feature the witch flying on a broom stick, while underground segments require the witch to run and jump in caverns. In the flying segments, players must search for four randomly scattered coloured keys to access underground areas that contain six ingredients. The objective is to collect the ingredients and return them to the witch's cottage to complete a spell that can defeat the Pumpking. While traversing the game world, the witch encounters Halloween-themed enemies such as pumpkins, ghosts, skulls, and bats, {{as well as other}} creatures like sharks and seagulls. A collision with an enemy causes the witch's magic meter (which is also used to fire offensive projectiles at enemies) to decrease. The character dies once the meter is depleted. After dying, the character reappears on the screen and the meter is refilled. Players are given limited opportunities for this to occur, and the game ends once the number of lives reaches zero.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{has three}} autopilot modes. The standard mode for en-route navigation is LNAV, which navigates along a {{great circle route}} between waypoints, adjusting the aircraft's heading to compensate for wind. Other modes will maintain the aircraft's heading—direction the nose is pointed (flight path {{will be affected by}} winds)—or the aircraft's track—direction the aircraft travels (flight path in a straight direction). The latter <b>two</b> <b>modes</b> are further affected by whether the aircraft used magnetic (normal reference) or true north (typically only used at high latitudes) as the reference for the autopilot. Since Flight 370 flew near waypoints VAMPI, MEKAR, NILAM, and possibly IGOGU—all along air route N571—while traversing the Malacca Strait, investigators considered whether Flight 370 followed any air routes or intersected any waypoints in the Southern Indian Ocean. Waypoints MUTMI and RUNUT were considered possible points that Flight 370 may have traversed, but tracks through these waypoints did not correlate well with paths generated from the BTO and BFO analysis.|$|E
5|$|The game's central {{location}} is the Mos Eisley Cantina, a spaceport {{bar on the}} planet Tatooine. At the counter, the player may use their Lego studs to purchase characters, vehicles, gameplay hints and extras, or activate cheat codes. In a small area outside the cantina, players may view collected vehicles. The game is broken into levels, which are accessed from the cantina; each film is represented by six levels, representing key locations and scenes in that film. The locations include Hoth, Bespin, Dagobah, Tatooine, the Death Star, and Endor. The game also features bonus levels. During levels, the player defeats enemies, builds objects out of Lego bricks and drives vehicles, Certain levels are played entirely while piloting vehicles, including a TIE fighter, a Snowspeeder, and the Millennium Falcon. Levels must first be played in Story Mode. This unlocks the next level {{as well as a}} Free Play mode for the recently completed level. Gameplay is identical in the <b>two</b> <b>modes.</b> However, Story Mode restricts playable characters to those followed in the film scenes the levels are based on, while Free Play offers all those unlocked. Levels can be replayed in either mode to collect studs and secret items.|$|E

With this extra condition assumed, we plot the flux of probability vector on <b>two</b> <b>mode's</b> plane.

Each of the <b>two</b> monophonic <b>modes</b> arranged the oscillators into a single note stack of slightly detuned oscillators. Use of these <b>two</b> monophonic <b>modes</b> changes the character of any given patch quite considerably, generally imbuing it with what could best be described as a powerful or [...] "fat" [...] sound.|$|R
5|$|The player {{assumes the}} role of a young chocolatier in 1880, during the Victorian era. The game has <b>two</b> <b>modes</b> of play: story and free play. Story mode {{involves}} a number of quests, including delivering specific chocolates and restoring the fictional Baumeister chocolate empire to its former glory. The player is enlisted by Evangeline Baumeister to rebuild the Baumeister chocolate empire which has been ruined by Evangeline's younger sister who scattered chocolate recipes around the world. The player must locate the 64 lost recipes, visit 14 different cities around the globe, purchase 6 closed Baumeister factories, establish business relationships with outlets and suppliers, and manufacture chocolates to keep in business. Free play mode allows the player to travel, manufacture, and trade without undertaking quests. This mode starts the player {{with a small amount of}} cash and all chocolate recipes unlocked for use. In story mode, players begin with a single factory and a recipe for simple chocolate bars, the player must visit the market to purchase ingredients and begin the manufacturing process.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{system remains}} unchanged from Ridge Racer, the checkpoint and time limit system remain the same; {{running out of}} time ends the race and passing through checkpoints grants additional time, although the car drifting is more like Ridge Racer 2. The player drives using automatic transmission or manual transmission. Ridge Racer Revolution supports Namco's NeGcon controller, and adds a rear-view mirror when using the in-car view. The game consists of three courses: 'Novice', 'Intermediate' (also called 'Advanced'), and 'Expert', each having different sections opened, and incorporates modes from the original game; Race, against eleven opponents, and Time Trial, against one. Ridge Racer Revolution adds a mode: Free Run, in which there are no other cars and the player practises driving. There is no lap limit. How fast the cars run depends on which speed grade is used, selectable in Free Run, and can be unlocked for Race. It is not available in Time Trial. A new feature is the option to select the time of day in which the race takes place, although this is not available {{at the start of the}} game. Ridge Racer Revolution features a two-player link-up mode which allows the players access to the original Ridge Racers courses known as 'Special 1' and 'Special 2'. There are <b>two</b> <b>modes</b> in two-player link-up: Race, identical to its single-player counterpart, and Versus, where only the players race against each other. Versus features a handicap option, increasing the speed of the trailing car.|$|E
