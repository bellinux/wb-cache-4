Within learning from demonstration, robots learn new tasks by recognizing a set of preprogrammed behaviors or skills as building blocks for new, potentially more complex tasks. One important aspect in this approach is the recognition of <b>the</b> set of <b>behaviors</b> that comprises <b>the</b> entire task. The ability to recognize a complex task as a sequence of simple <b>behaviors</b> enables <b>the</b> robot to generalize better on more complex tasks. In this article, we propose that primitive behaviors can be taught to a robot via learning from demonstration. In our experiment, we teach <b>the</b> robot new <b>behaviors</b> by demonstrating <b>the</b> <b>behaviors</b> to <b>the</b> robot several times. Following that, a long short-term memory recurrent neural network is trained to recognize <b>the</b> <b>behaviors.</b> In this study, we managed to teach at least six behaviors on a NAO humanoid robot and trained a long short-term memory recurrent neural network to recognize <b>the</b> <b>behaviors</b> using <b>the</b> supervised learning scheme.

We also show that the long short-term memory is advantageous compared to other neural network frameworks in recognizing <b>the</b> <b>behaviors</b> in <b>the</b> presence of noise in <b>the</b> <b>behaviors...</b>|$|R
