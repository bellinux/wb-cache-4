5|$|As a child, Tarrare {{had a huge}} {{appetite}} and by his teens could eat {{a quarter of a}} bullock, weighing as much as Tarrare himself, in a single day. By this time, his parents could not provide for him and had forced him to leave home. For some years after this, he toured <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> roaming band of thieves and prostitutes, begging and stealing for food, before gaining employment as a warm-up act to a travelling charlatan. Tarrare would draw a crowd by eating corks, stones and live animals, and by swallowing an entire basketful of apples one after the other. He would eat ravenously and was particularly fond of snake meat.|$|E

5|$|By 1880 {{the railway}} had six {{locomotives}} at its disposal. No. 1–2 were Class 14 that were intended as helping {{power to get}} trains up the steep climb from Gudå to Storlien. No. 3–6 were Class 9 locomotives that would do the main haulage from Gudå into Trondheim. In 1883, NSB's other two Class 14 locomotives were transferred from the Smaalenene Line. The initial fleet consisted of 24 passenger and nine breaking cars, all from Skabo. The line featured the first bogie cars in <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> single entrance {{at the end of}} each car, instead of individual doors for each compartment. There were also 37 closed freight cars, 40 lumber cars, 20 boxcars, 100 flatcars and three milk cars. At first all trains were mixed freight and passenger.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the {{shortening}} of {{the main}} Bergen Line railway with the Ulriken Tunnel, the Bergen–Nesttun Line was an important commuter rail service, feeding suburban residents from Fana into the city center.

There were up to 27 trains per day, of which five continued to Garnes. In 1918, the line was proposed for doubling and electrification: the latter was completed in 1954.

5|$|In late November, Typhoon Durian brought {{even greater}} devastation to the Philippines and {{prompted}} greater need for international assistance. On December11, President Arroyo declared a national state of calamity and released 1billion PHP (US$25.6million) in relief and rehabilitation funds. Throughout 2006 as a whole, the Philippines was devastated by multiple natural disasters that collectively killed well over 1,000people and left more than US$1.6billion in damage. Consequently, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs appealed for emergency {{assistance to the}} nation, {{in the form of}} US$46million in funds for the most severely affected areas. The European Commission Humanitarian Aid department also provided €2million (US$1.9million) in emergency funds in relation to the four major typhoons that struck <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> focus on areas affected by Typhoon Durian.

5|$|Like Dewoitine, German {{designer}} Kurt Tank, {{the former}} technical {{director of the}} Focke-Wulf Flugzeugbau AG, had been similarly hired in 1947 {{to work on a}} jet fighter project for Argentina. Tank, along with 62 of his compatriots at Focke-Wulf, had emigrated to Latin America to restart his career in aerospace ventures. Surreptitiously entering <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> passport identifying him as Pedro Matthies, he found a warm welcome and did not maintain the subterfuge of a secret identity. Along with his former employees, he was instrumental {{in the evolution of the}} Instituto Aerotécnico into Argentina's military aircraft factory, the Fábrica Militar de Aviones at Córdoba. Tank was both an engineer as well as a test pilot, who had designed the Fw 190 fighter, but his design team had also been responsible for the Focke-Wulf Ta 183, an unbuilt project that had been declared the winner of the 1945 Emergency Fighter Competition. The diminutive, swept-wing, jet-powered Ta 183, designed by Focke-Wulf engineer/designer Hans Multhopp, had only reached the stage of wind tunnel studies before the end of hostilities.|$|E
5|$|Wellsway School is an 11–18, mixed {{comprehensive}} school {{which was established}} in 1971, by amalgamating Keynsham Grammar School and Wellsway County Secondary School both of which opened on a shared site in the mid-1950s. Most students that attend the school live in Keynsham and Saltford or the nearby villages. As of 2007, approximately 1350 students attend the school, ranging in age of 11–18, with 64% achieving 5 or more A-C grades at GCSE. Wellsway's bid for specialist school status was accepted in September 2007. Meaning that Wellsway School now specialises as a Sports and Science College. This means the School has joined the national network of specialist schools, resulting in every school in Bath and North East Somerset now having a specialism. A joint bid is unusual as there are only six schools in <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> combined Sports and Science specialism.|$|E
5|$|Opposition {{from the}} laity took longer to surface. This {{resistance}} focused on two things: the King's right to demand military service, {{and his right}} to levy taxes. At the Salisbury parliament of February 1297, Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, {{in his capacity as}} Marshal of England, objected to a royal summons of military service. Bigod argued that the military obligation only extended to service alongside the King; if the King intended to sail to Flanders, he could not send his subjects to Gascony. In July, Bigod and Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford and Constable of England, drew up a series of complaints known as the Remonstrances, in which objections to the extortionate level of taxation were voiced. Undeterred, Edward requested another lay subsidy. This one was particularly provocative, because the King had sought consent only from a small group of magnates, rather than from representatives from the communities in parliament. While Edward was in Winchelsea, preparing for the campaign in Flanders, Bigod and Bohun turned up at the Exchequer to prevent the collection of the tax. As the King left <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> greatly reduced force, the kingdom seemed {{to be on the verge}} of civil war. What resolved the situation was the English defeat by the Scots at the Battle of Stirling Bridge. The renewed threat to the homeland gave king and magnates common cause. Edward signed the Confirmatio cartaruma confirmation of Magna Carta and its accompanying Charter of the Forestand the nobility agreed to serve with the King on a campaign in Scotland.|$|E
