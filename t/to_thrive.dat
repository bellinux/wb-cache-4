5|$|Small {{numbers of}} Dall's {{porpoises}} {{have been kept}} in captivity in both the United States and Japan. However, these animals consistently failed <b>to</b> <b>thrive.</b> Captive P. dalli repeatedly ran into the walls of their enclosures, refused food, and exhibited skin sloughing. All Dall's porpoises introduced to aquaria died shortly thereafter.|$|E

5|$|Changing {{technologies}} {{have affected the}} recording, distribution, and varying profitability of the underground industry. The copyrights for the song {{and the right to}} authorise recordings often reside with the artist, according to several international copyright treaties. The recording, trading and sale of bootlegs continues <b>to</b> <b>thrive,</b> however, even as artists and record companies attempt to provide officially-released alternatives to satisfy the demand.|$|E
5|$|Other archaea {{exist in}} very acidic or {{alkaline}} conditions. For example, {{one of the}} most extreme archaean acidophiles is Picrophilus torridus, which grows at pH0, which is equivalent <b>to</b> <b>thriving</b> in 1.2molar sulfuric acid.|$|R

5|$|Dromedaries {{are mainly}} active during {{daylight}} hours. They form herds of about 20 individuals, which {{are led by}} a dominant male. This camel feeds on foliage and desert vegetation; several adaptations, {{such as the ability}} to tolerate losing more than 30% of its total water content, allow it <b>to</b> <b>thrive</b> in its desert habitat. Mating occurs annually and peaks in the rainy season; females bear a single calf after a gestation of 15 months.|$|E
5|$|Edinburgh Zoo is a zoological park in Edinburgh, Scotland {{which opened}} on 22 July 1913. Edinburgh had {{previously}} been home to a zoological garden which failed <b>to</b> <b>thrive.</b> The new zoo is owned and run by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland and initially opened as the Scottish National Zoological Park. Modern zoological methods allowed animals to survive in Edinburgh's cold climate.|$|E

5|$|Leicestershire and Rutland are {{landlocked}} lowland {{counties and}} most of the birds are typical of English farmland habitat. Many coastal, oceanic and highland birds are absent or rare, and there are few rare vagrants compared to coastal areas. The construction of two large reservoirs, Eyebrook Reservoir in 1940 and Rutland Water (England's largest reservoir) in 1976, has provided freshwater environments enabling many aquatic birds <b>to</b> <b>thrive.</b>|$|E
5|$|Neoclassicism or {{increasingly}} Nordic Classicism continued <b>to</b> <b>thrive</b> at {{the beginning}} of the century until about 1930 as can be seen in Kay Fisker's Hornbækhus apartment buildings (1923) and Hack Kampmann's police headquarters (1924). Its development was no isolated phenomenon, drawing on existing classical traditions in the Nordic countries, and from new ideas being pursued in German-speaking cultures. It can thus be characterised as a combination of direct and indirect influences from vernacular architecture (Nordic, Italian and German) and Neoclassicism.|$|E

5|$|Pediatricians {{are often}} the first health {{professionals}} to assess and raise suspicions of RAD in children with the disorder. The initial presentation varies according to the child's developmental and chronological age, although it always involves a disturbance in social interaction. Infants up to about 18–24 months may present with non-organic failure <b>to</b> <b>thrive</b> and display abnormal responsiveness to stimuli. Laboratory investigations will be unremarkable barring possible findings consistent with malnutrition or dehydration, while serum growth hormone levels will be normal or elevated.|$|E
5|$|Radishes can {{be useful}} as {{companion}} plants for many other crops, probably because their pungent odour deters such insect pests as aphids, cucumber beetles, tomato hornworms, squash bugs, and ants. They can function as a trap crop, luring insect pests away from the main crop. Cucumbers and radishes seem <b>to</b> <b>thrive</b> when grown in close association with each other, and radishes also grow well with chervil, lettuce, peas, and nasturtiums. However, they react adversely to growing in close association with hyssop.|$|E
5|$|Some trees {{such as the}} alders (Alnus species) have a {{symbiotic}} relationship with Frankia species, a filamentous bacterium that can fix nitrogen from the air, converting it into ammonia. They have actinorhizal root nodules on their roots in which the bacteria live. This process enables the tree to live in low nitrogen habitats where they would otherwise be unable <b>to</b> <b>thrive.</b> The plant hormones called cytokinins initiate root nodule formation, in a process closely related to mycorrhizal association.|$|E

5|$|The Oubangui {{people of}} west Africa plant a tree {{when a child}} is born. As the tree flourishes, so does the child but if the tree fails <b>to</b> <b>thrive,</b> the health of the child is {{considered}} at risk. When it flowers it is time for marriage. Gifts are left at the tree periodically and when the individual dies, their spirit is believed to live on in the tree.|$|E
5|$|There was {{considerable}} local {{opposition to the}} Yellowstone National Park during its early years. Some of the locals feared that the regional economy would be unable <b>to</b> <b>thrive</b> if there remained strict federal prohibitions against resource development or settlement within park boundaries and local entrepreneurs advocated reducing {{the size of the}} park so that mining, hunting, and logging activities could be developed. To this end, numerous bills were introduced into Congress by Montana representatives who sought to remove the federal land-use restrictions.|$|E
5|$|Breeding densities {{have been}} {{recorded}} as between 0.1–6.6pairs/10ha (0.04–2.7pairs/10acres), with the greatest densities in mature forest growing on alluvium. Numbers have increased in Europe due to the planting of forests, which provides breeding habitat, and more available dead wood, and this species has profited from its flexibility with regard to types of woodland and its ability <b>to</b> <b>thrive</b> in proximity to humans. Harsh winters are a problem, and fragmentation of woodland can cause local difficulties. The Canary Islands populations of D. m. canariensis on Tenerife and D. m. thanneri on Gran Canaria face a potential threat from exploitation of the local pine forests.|$|E
