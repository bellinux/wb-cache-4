5|$|In plant cells, vacuoles cover {{anywhere}} from 30% to 90% {{of the total}} cell volume. Most mature plant cells contain one large central vacuole encompassed by a membrane called the <b>tonoplast.</b> Vacuoles of plant cells act as storage compartments for the nutrients and waste of a cell. The solution that these molecules are stored in is called the cell sap. Pigments that color the cell are sometime located in the cell sap. Vacuoles can also {{increase the size of}} the cell, which elongates as water is added, and they control the turgor pressure (the osmotic pressure that keeps the cell wall from caving in). Like lysosomes of animal cells, vacuoles have an acidic pH and contain hydrolytic enzymes. The pH of vacuoles enables them to perform homeostatic procedures in the cell. For example, when the pH in the cells environment drops, the H+ ions surging into the cytosol can be transferred to a vacuole {{in order to keep the}} cytosol's pH constant.|$|E

50|$|The MIP {{family is}} large and diverse, {{possessing}} thousands of members that form transmembrane channels. These channel proteins function in transporting water, small carbohydrates (e.g., glycerol), urea, NH3, CO2, H2O2 and ions by energy-independent mechanisms. For example, the glycerol channel, FPS1p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mediates uptake of arsenite and antimonite. Ion permeability appears to occur through a pathway different than that used for water/glycerol transport and may involve a channel at the 4 subunit interface rather than the channels through the subunits. MIP family members are found ubiquitously in bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. Phylogenetic clustering of the proteins is primarily based according to phylum of the organisms of origin, but one or more clusters are observed for each phylogenetic kingdom (plants, animals, yeast, bacteria and archaea). MIPs are classified into five subfamilies in higher plants, including plasma membrane (PIPs), <b>tonoplast</b> (TIPs), NOD26-like (NIPs), small basic (SIPs) and unclassified X (XIPs) intrinsic proteins.

Plasma membranes were purified by both phase partitioning and free-flow electrophoresis from microsomal fractions and identified on the basis of biochemical and in some cases morphological and cytochemical markers. Electron micrographs revealed that membrane vesicles from Pinus sylvestris exhibited a very clear dark-light-dark pattern and measurements of membrane thickness showed that it ranged from 6 to 10 nm. Most membranes were 8 nm thick and stained with phosphotungstic acid at low pH, both typical characteristics of the plasma membrane. Enzymatic identification of plasma membranes consisted in the determination of the vanadate-sensitive ATPase (EC 3. 6. 1. 3) activity. The specific activity in the upper phase (U 2) fraction was 10 – 25 times higher than those in the lower phase and microsomal fractions, depending on plant species. 1, 3 -β-glucan synthase II (EC 2. 4. 1. 3), another putative plasma membrane marker, was not detected in the plasma membrane-enriched fractions of conifer needles and showed a very low specific activity in membranes of deciduous trees. Contamination by membranes of other origin was determined by analysis of membrane markers: cytochrome c oxidase (EC 1. 9. 3. 1) for mitochondria, inosine diphosphatase (EC 3. 6. 1. 6) for Golgi apparatus, cytochrome c reductase (EC 1. 6. 2. 4) for endoplasmic reticulum, and pyrophosphatase (EC 3. 6. 1. 1) for <b>tonoplasts.</b> The main, but relatively low contamination, was due to <b>tonoplasts,</b> as determined by the activity of pyrophosphatase.

Moreover, radiation inactivation analysis of ER-enriched vesicles and purified ER-PPase yielded functional masses of 178. 6 +/- 9. 2 and 143. 4 +/- 4. 7 kDa for inorganic pyrophosphate hydrolysis activity, respectively, indicating that ER-PPase was functionally homoditneric.

40|$|Very limited {{information}} {{is available on the}} role of phosphatidylinositol 3 -phosphate (PI[3]P) in vesicle trafficking in plant cells. To investigate the role of PI(3) P during the vesicle trafficking in plant cells, we exploited the PI(3) P-specific binding property of the endosome binding domain (EBD) (amino acids 1257 to 1411) of human early endosome antigen 1, which is involved in endosome fusion. When expressed transiently in Arabidopsis protoplasts, a green fluorescent protein (GFP) :EBD fusion protein exhibited PI(3) P-dependent localization to various compartments—such as the trans-Golgi network, the prevacuolar compartment, the <b>tonoplasts,</b> and the vesicles in the vacuolar lumen—that varied with time. The internalized GFP:EBD eventually disappeared from the lumen. Deletion experiments revealed that the PI(3) P-dependent localization required the Rab 5 binding motif in addition to the zinc finger motif. Overexpression of GFP:EBD inhibited vacuolar trafficking of sporamin but not trafficking of H+-ATPase to the plasma membrane. On the basis of these results, we propose that the trafficking of GFP:EBD reflects that of PI(3) P and that PI(3) P synthesized at the trans-Golgi network is transported to the vacuole through the prevacuolar compartment for degradation in plant cells...|$|R
50|$|Osmosis {{is a vital}} {{process in}} {{biological}} systems, as biological membranes are semipermeable. In general, these membranes are impermeable to large and polar molecules, such as ions, proteins, and polysaccharides, while being permeable to non-polar and/or hydrophobic molecules like lipids {{as well as to}} small molecules like oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and nitric oxide. Permeability depends on solubility, charge, or chemistry, as well as solute size. Water molecules travel through the plasma membrane, <b>tonoplast</b> membrane (vacuole) or protoplast by diffusing across the phospholipid bilayer via aquaporins (small transmembrane proteins similar to those responsible for facilitated diffusion and ion channels). Osmosis provides the primary means by which water is transported into and out of cells. The turgor pressure of a cell is largely maintained by osmosis across the cell membrane between the cell interior and its relatively hypotonic environment.|$|E

50|$|Aside from storage, {{the main}} {{role of the}} central vacuole is to {{maintain}} turgor pressure against the cell wall. Proteins found in the <b>tonoplast</b> (aquaporins) control {{the flow of water}} {{into and out of the}} vacuole through active transport, pumping potassium (K+) ions into and out of the vacuolar interior. Due to osmosis, water will diffuse into the vacuole, placing pressure on the cell wall. If water loss leads to a significant decline in turgor pressure, the cell will plasmolyze. Turgor pressure exerted by vacuoles is also required for cellular elongation: as the cell wall is partially degraded by the action of expansins, the less rigid wall is expanded by the pressure coming from within the vacuole. Turgor pressure exerted by the vacuole is also essential in supporting plants in an upright position. Another function of a central vacuole is that it pushes all contents of the cell's cytoplasm against the cellular membrane, and thus keeps the chloroplasts closer to light.Most plants store chemicals in the vacuole that react with chemicals in the cytosol. If the cell is broken, for example by a herbivore, then the two chemicals can react forming toxic chemicals. In garlic, alliin and the enzyme alliinase are normally separated but form allicin if the vacuole is broken. A similar reaction is responsible for the production of syn-propanethial-S-oxide when onions are cut.|$|E
40|$|Rab {{proteins}} {{are members}} of the Ras superfamily of small GTP binding proteins and play important roles in various intracellular trafficking steps. We investigated the role of Rha 1, an Arabidopsis Rab 5 homolog, in intracellular trafficking in Arabidopsis protoplasts. In the presence of a dominant-negative mutant of Rha 1, soluble vacuolar cargo proteins such as sporamin:green fluorescent protein (Spo:GFP) and Arabidopsis aleurain like protein:GFP are not delivered to the central vacuole; instead, they accumulate as a diffuse or punctate staining pattern within the cell. Spo:GFP at the punctate stains observed in the presence of hemagglutinin:Rha 1 [S 24 N] is colocalized with endogenous vacuolar sorting receptor (VSRAt- 1), which is known to localize primarily to the prevacuolar compartment, whereas Spo:GFP in the diffuse pattern is associated with <b>tonoplasts.</b> Furthermore, expression of Rha 1 [S 24 N] causes the secretion of a portion of the vacuolar proteins into medium. However, the inhibitory effect of Rha 1 [S 24 N] on vacuolar trafficking is relieved partially by coexpressed wild-type Rha 1. Based on these results, we propose that Rha 1 plays a critical role in the trafficking of soluble cargoes from the prevacuolar compartment to the central vacuole...|$|R

He was both a very original thinker and a very versatile, thorough and careful experimentalist. He initiated a revolution in our understanding of ion transport in plant cells. His demonstration (in 1972) that the most important transport system in the plasmalemma of Characean cells is a proton-pumping ATPase, generating membrane potentials well negative of the potassium equilibrium potential, was a major advance… Previously plant physiologists had assumed that plant cells were like animal cells, with an ATP-dependent sodium-potassium exchange pump as the major process of active ion transport. There was opposition to this new view, but by the time of his review in the 1981 Annual Reviews of Plant Physiology further experimental work {{made it clear that he}} was right. In the period of the 1970s and 1980s he continued to make major contributions to the new thinking. He showed that two distinct proton pumping ATPases were present in plasmalemma and <b>tonoplast,</b> with different inhibitor characteristics. He also showed that the gradients of pH and membrane potential generated by the primary proton pump in the plasmalemma could be used to drive secondary active transport of other solutes, sugars, amino acids and other ions. Thus his original idea led to a very large volume of experimental work, in which he also had a major input, and the consequence was a revolution in the field. He later went on to work successfully on more applied problems over a wide range of topics, but it is important to recognize the lasting legacy of his work in the field of basic ion transport.|$|E

The digestive vacuole {{is the site}} of hemoglobin degradation, the storage site for hemozoin (an inert biocrystal of toxic heme), the site of action of many antimalarial drugs, and the site of proteins known to be involved in antimalarial drug resistance. The acidic pH of this organelle is thought to {{play a critical role in}} its various functions; however, the mechanisms by which the pH within the vacuole is maintained are not well understood. In this study, we have used a combination of techniques to demonstrate the presence on the P. falciparum digestive vacuole membrane of two discrete H+ pumping mechanisms, both capable of acidifying the vacuole interior. One is a V-type H+-ATPase, sensitive to concanamycin A and bafilomycin A, The other is a H+-pyrophosphatase, which was inhibited by NaF and showed a partial dependence on K+. The operation of the H+-pyrophosphatase was dependent on the presence of a Mg 2 +-pyrophosphate complex, and kinetic experiments gave results consistent with free pyrophosphate acting as an inhibitor of the protein. The presence of the combination of a H+-ATPase and a H+-pyrophosphatase on the P. falciparum digestive vacuole is similar to the situation in the acidic <b>tonoplasts</b> (vacuoles) of plant cells...|$|R
40|$|Lipodepsi{{peptides}} (LPDs) are a {{group of}} cyclic, acylated peptides produced by several Pseudomonas species. They are usually divided in two groups, mycins and peptins, {{on the basis of}} the size of the amino acidic part of the molecule. Mycins have a ring of 9 amino acids closed between the first and the last residue, peptins contain a more complex peptide moiety of up to 25 amino acids, partially cyclized. Both mycins and peptins attack the plasma membrane, but may have different target organisms. Comparing the mode of action of these two classes of LDPs on natural and model membranes we observed that all peptides induced red blood cell haemolysis and leakage of <b>tonoplasts</b> and liposornes by the formation of pores. The haemolytic activity of the smaller mycins was higher than that of the bigger peptins and proportional to the amphipathic index of the molecule. The extent of permeabilization was dependent also on the composition of the lipid membrane. In particular, mycins show a preference for sterols, whereas peptins are more active on phospholipids, especially sphingomyelin. These differences may have physiological implications. The formation of discrete ion channels, with anionic selectivity, was directly demonstrated by electrophysiological experiments performed on planar lipid bilayers or sugar beet vacuoles.

In the early developing stages (15 - 20 OAF) most of the cells were occupied by large, centrally located vacuoles while the cytoplasm was restricted to a thin layer against the cell wall and contained numerous ribosomes, mitochondria, plastids, small amounts of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and minute lipid bodies. At about 25 OAF, spherical organelles which contained protein, lipid and sugar (PLS bodies), appeared and then increased in number and in size. Vacuoles had protein deposits lining the inner surfaces of the <b>tonoplasts.</b> At 30 - 35 OAF, the PLS bodies lost their characteristic ciccular shape because of invaginations containing cytoplasmic materials and small vacuoles. Such transformed PLS bodies, fragmented vacuoles and protein bodies became difficult to distinguish from each other. At this stage, the cytoplasm contained abundant rough ER with cisternae, dictyosomes, lipid bodies and plastids. At 35 - 40 OAF, protein bodies which varied in size and shape were observed in ce lls a long with lipid bodies and rough ER. At about 40 OAF the plastids reached maximum size and number and then most disappeared. In the final stage (55 - 60 OAF), protein bodies became homogeneous in electron density with completion of protein accumulation...|$|R
