5|$|Assembly – Following the structure-mediated {{self-assembly}} of {{the virus}} particles, some modification of the proteins often occurs. In viruses such as HIV, this modification (sometimes called maturation) occurs after <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>has</b> been released from the host cell.|$|E
5|$|An {{outbreak}} of a gastrointestinal illness in Spain which was causing mortalities in humans {{has been linked}} to western jackdaws. During a post-mortem on an affected bird, a polyomavirus was isolated from the spleen. The illness appeared to be a co-infection of this with Salmonella and <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>has</b> been provisionally named the crow polyomavirus (CPyV). Segmented filamentous bacteria have been isolated from the small intestine of a western jackdaw, although their pathogenicity or role is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Dengue {{is spread}} by {{several species of}} {{mosquito}} of the Aedes type, principally A. aegypti. <b>The</b> <b>virus</b> <b>has</b> five different types; infection with one type usually gives lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term immunity to the others. Subsequent infection with a different type {{increases the risk of}} severe complications. A number of tests are available to confirm the diagnosis including detecting antibodies to the virus or its RNA.|$|E
50|$|Only the {{signature}} of <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>had</b> been inserted into <b>the</b> blockchain; <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> itself was not there, and if it were, {{it would not be}} able to function.|$|R
50|$|By December 30, 2009 {{the state}} had 824 laboratory-confirmed cases since September 1, and <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>had</b> contributed to <b>the</b> deaths of 20 people.|$|R
5000|$|Spain On 25 September it was {{announced}} that Brother Manuel García Viejo, the second Spanish citizen infected with <b>the</b> <b>virus,</b> <b>had</b> died at Madrid's Hospital Carlos III.|$|R
5|$|The natural {{hosts of}} {{influenza}} viruses are pigs and birds, {{although it has}} probably infected humans since antiquity. The virus can cause mild to severe epizootics in wild and domesticated animals. Many species of wild birds migrate and this has spread influenza across the continents throughout the ages. <b>The</b> <b>virus</b> <b>has</b> evolved into numerous strains and continues to do so, posing an ever-present threat.|$|E
5|$|The poxviruses are large, complex {{viruses that}} have an unusual morphology. The viral genome is {{associated}} with proteins within a central disc structure known as a nucleoid. The nucleoid {{is surrounded by a}} membrane and two lateral bodies of unknown function. <b>The</b> <b>virus</b> <b>has</b> an outer envelope with a thick layer of protein studded over its surface. The whole virion is slightly pleiomorphic, ranging from ovoid to brick shape. Mimivirus {{is one of the largest}} characterised viruses, with a capsid diameter of 400nm. Protein filaments measuring 100nm project from the surface. The capsid appears hexagonal under an electron microscope, therefore the capsid is probably icosahedral. In 2011, researchers discovered the largest then known virus in samples of water collected from the ocean floor off the coast of Las Cruces, Chile. Provisionally named Megavirus chilensis, it can be seen with a basic optical microscope. In 2013, the Pandoravirus genus was discovered in Chile and Australia, and has genomes about twice as large as Megavirus and Mimivirus.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>virus</b> <b>has</b> been {{identified}} in the pulmonary nodules of African elephants {{as far back as}} the 1970s. The first recognised fatal case of EEHV in an Asian elephant was identified at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., in 1995; testing on stored tissue samples was able to identify a number of earlier deaths as being due to the same virus. These cases have so far {{been identified}} as early as 1983. Since this date, there have been a total of 54 more cases in North America and Europe, nine of which were successfully treated. The May 2009 deaths of two calves at Whipsnade Zoo were not included in this calculation. This gives a fatality rate of over 80% among known symptomatic disease cases. In cases where antiviral medication was applied, treatment was effective in about one in three cases. As of 2005, there were twelve cases where famciclovir had been used, eight of which were fatal. As a fraction of the overall population, it has been calculated that of the 78 Asian elephants born in captivity in North America between 1978 and 2007, 19 are known to have died of EEHV, and five more were successfully treated with antiviral medication.|$|E
25|$|As of 18 August 2009, 4 deaths due to <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>have</b> been {{reported}} in the country. This is not the case, as only one fatality was reported positive to <b>the</b> <b>virus.</b> <b>The</b> other three were signaled negative.|$|R
50|$|The {{evidence}} {{available to}} date suggests that <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> <b>have</b> been present in bats {{for some time}} and had spread to camels by the mid 1990s. <b>The</b> <b>viruses</b> appear to <b>have</b> spread from camels to humans in the early 2010s. The original bat host species and the time of initial infection in this species has yet to be determined.|$|R
2500|$|In October 2010, the FAO {{announced}} it was confident the disease has been eradicated. The agency said that [...] "s of mid 2010, FAO is confident that <b>the</b> rinderpest <b>virus</b> <b>has</b> been eliminated from Europe, Asia, Middle East, Arabian Peninsula, and Africa," [...] which were the locations in which <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>had</b> been last reported. Eradication was confirmed by the World Organization for Animal Health on 25 May 2011.|$|R
5|$|Epidemiology is used {{to break}} the chain of {{infection}} in populations during outbreaks of viral diseases. Control measures are used {{that are based on}} knowledge of how the virus is transmitted. It is important to find the source, or sources, of the outbreak and to identify the virus. Once <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>has</b> been identified, the chain of transmission can sometimes be broken by vaccines. When vaccines are not available, sanitation and disinfection can be effective. Often, infected people are isolated {{from the rest of the}} community, and those that have been exposed to the virus are placed in quarantine. To control the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in cattle in Britain in 2001, thousands of cattle were slaughtered. Most viral infections of humans and other animals have incubation periods during which the infection causes no signs or symptoms. Incubation periods for viral diseases range from a few days to weeks, but are known for most infections. Somewhat overlapping, but mainly following the incubation period, there is a period of communicability — a time when an infected individual or animal is contagious and can infect another person or animal. This, too, is known for many viral infections, and knowledge of the length of both periods is important in the control of outbreaks. When outbreaks cause an unusually high proportion of cases in a population, community, or region, they are called epidemics. If outbreaks spread worldwide, they are called pandemics.|$|E
25|$|These orthoreoviruses {{were first}} {{isolated}} in 1987 from a moribund python (Python regius) {{and was found}} to cause high levels of syncytium formation but did not cause hemagglutination in human red blood cells (RBCs). In reptiles <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>has</b> been found widely but is not necessarily associated with any specific disease. <b>The</b> <b>virus</b> <b>has</b> {{been found to have}} 2 ORFs encoding for p14, a cell fusion protein and σC. RRVs belong to the fusogenic subgroup and has only recently been classified as a distinct subgroup of orthoreoviruses.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, Zeng Yi, an {{academician}} {{with the}} Chinese Academy of Sciences, starts HIV serum testing and confirms that <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>has</b> entered the Chinese mainland in 1982 and infected the first Chinese in 1983.|$|E
50|$|Two {{cases of}} <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>have</b> been {{detected}} in Northern Ireland amongst wild geese. As a response, the Department of Agriculture has extended restrictions on poultry flocks {{until at least}} 16 March.|$|R
50|$|The {{pathogenicity}} of HPIVs is mutually {{dependent on}} <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> <b>having</b> <b>the</b> correct accessory proteins which {{are able to}} elicit anti-interferon properties. This {{is a major factor}} in the clinical significance of disease.|$|R
5000|$|In 1953, farmers {{discovered}} rabbits at Stonehaven {{which had}} become immune to myxomatosis. These so-called [...] "super rabbits" [...] had appeared only three years after <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>had</b> been released to control rabbit numbers.|$|R
25|$|Bats {{are known}} to be {{carriers}} of at least 90 different viruses that can make transition to a human host. However, <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>has</b> different symptoms in humans. It takes one to ten viruses to infect a human but there can be millions in a drop of blood from someone very sick from the disease.|$|E
25|$|On 27 March 2009, Felix Leder and Tillmann Werner {{from the}} Honeynet Project {{discovered}} that Conficker-infected hosts have a detectable signature when scanned remotely. The peer-to-peer command protocol used by variants D and E of <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>has</b> since been partially reverse-engineered, allowing researchers {{to imitate the}} virus network's command packets and positively identify infected computers en-masse.|$|E
25|$|Control {{of swine}} {{influenza}} by vaccination {{has become more}} difficult in recent decades, as the evolution of <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>has</b> resulted in inconsistent responses to traditional vaccines. Standard commercial swine flu vaccines are effective in controlling the infection when the virus strains match enough to have significant cross-protection, and custom (autogenous) vaccines made from the specific viruses isolated are created and used in the more difficult cases.|$|E
40|$|The virion polypeptides {{of eight}} group B arboviruses were {{compared}} by polyacrylamide gel coelectrophoresis. All contained three polypeptides, V- 1, V- 2, and V- 3. <b>The</b> mosquito-borne <b>viruses</b> <b>had</b> electrophoretically similar small membrane polypeptides (V- 1); <b>the</b> tick-borne <b>viruses</b> <b>had</b> a V- 1 of significantly decreased mobility...|$|R
50|$|The Duck circovirus (DuCV) {{is a type}} {{of virus}} found in ducks. Strains of <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>have</b> {{predominantly}} been found in China, though strains have also been isolated from ducks in Germany and the United States.|$|R
40|$|Further {{electron}} microscope observations of tissues from Swiss and DBA/ 2 mice with leukemia transmissible by ceil-free filtrates to the adult animals are presented. The cytological {{characteristics of the}} leukemic cells, the fine structure of <b>the</b> <b>viruses,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> host-cell relationships <b>have</b> been examined. <b>The</b> leukemia <b>virus</b> <b>has</b> an external diameter averaging 870 A, {{and appears to be}} formed at the level of cell membranes by a budding process. <b>The</b> <b>viruses</b> are observed most frequently in intercellular spaces, but are also often found within cytoplasmic vacuoles of megakaryocytes. Lead hydroxide staining was applied {{to the study of the}} leukemic material. <b>The</b> <b>viruses</b> <b>have</b> been found to have a considerable affinity for this lead salt, only comparable in intensity to the affinity shown by RNP granules for the same chemical...|$|R
25|$|Hepatitis A is {{distinguished}} from other viral causes by its prolonged (2–6 week) incubation period {{and its ability}} to spread beyond the stomach and intestines into the liver. It often results in jaundice, or yellowing of the skin, but rarely leads to chronic liver dysfunction. <b>The</b> <b>virus</b> <b>has</b> been found to cause infection due to the consumption of fresh-cut produce which has fecal contamination.|$|E
25|$|Antibodies {{have been}} found to THOV in rats and many {{domestic}} animals, including goats, sheep, donkeys, camels, cattle and buffaloes, and <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>has</b> been isolated from the wild banded mongoose (Mongos mungo). It causes significant livestock disease, including a febrile illness and abortion in sheep. In artificial laboratory infections, it is highly pathogenic in hamsters and also infects mice. The virus is known to infect humans in natural settings.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} it was discovered, it was thought that Ebola virus is not endemic to Sierra Leone or to the West Africa region and this {{epidemic}} represents the first time <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>has</b> been discovered there. However, some samples taken for Lassa fever testing turned out to be Ebola virus disease when re-tested for Ebola in 2014, showing that Ebola had been in Sierra Leone as early as 2006.|$|E
5000|$|Bovine Adenovirus, {{also known}} as BAdV, {{is a member of}} the Adenoviridae family that causes disease in cattle. There are 10 serotypes {{recognised}} and <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>had</b> a worldwide distribution—being particularly common in Africa and Central America.|$|R
50|$|The {{ultimate}} {{source of}} <b>the</b> global <b>virus</b> in <b>the</b> novel is unknown; however, it is {{implied that the}} source of <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> was involved {{in one way or another}} in the inflamed war on terrorism. Though it is left ambiguous, it is possible that the ultimate source of <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> may <b>have</b> even been the United States government: this hypothesis is supported by an early epicenter of <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> being in <b>the</b> Middle East, which when considered with the virus' distribution method is suspicious; this is further supported by the inordinate knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>had</b> by officials from the US government.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{study by}} Kanta Subbaro {{involved}} a serial passage experiment by infecting mice with SARS. [...] SARS usually {{does not make}} mice particularly sick, however, after <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>had</b> undergone serial passage in the mice, it had become lethal.|$|R
25|$|Hepatovirus A is a picornavirus; {{it is not}} enveloped and {{contains}} a single-stranded RNA packaged in a protein shell. Only one serotype of <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>has</b> been found, but multiple genotypes exist. Codon use within the genome is biased and unusually distinct from its host. It also has a poor internal ribosome entry site. In the region that codes for the HAV capsid, highly conserved clusters of rare codons restrict antigenic variability.|$|E
25|$|In Phase 3, {{an animal}} or human-animal {{influenza}} reassortant virus has caused sporadic cases or small clusters of disease in people, {{but has not}} resulted in human-to-human transmission sufficient to sustain community-level outbreaks. Limited human-to-human transmission may occur under some circumstances, for example, when there is close contact between an infected person and an unprotected caregiver. However, limited transmission under such restricted circumstances does not indicate that <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>has</b> gained the level of transmissibility among humans necessary to cause a pandemic.|$|E
25|$|Officials in {{the southwestern}} {{province}} of Yunnan announced in 2006 that, starting on January 1, 2007, Yunnan residents will be {{required by law to}} take an HIV test before marriage. There would be no charge for the test, the results of which are to be shared with prospective spouses. Yunnan, home to 25% of the country's HIV cases, borders the opium-rich Golden Triangle of Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar. <b>The</b> <b>virus</b> <b>has</b> been found in 128 of its 129 counties, the provincial government has said.|$|E
50|$|The {{consensus}} {{today is}} that <b>the</b> FMD <b>virus</b> came from infected or contaminated meat {{that was part of}} the swill being fed to pigs at Burnside Farm in Heddon-on-the-wall.
