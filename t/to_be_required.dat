5|$|By December 1943 the {{division}} {{had returned to}} England and begun training for operations in North-West Europe {{under the supervision of}} I Airborne Corps. Although the 1st Airborne Division was not scheduled {{to take part in the}} Normandy landings, a contingency plan, Operation Wasteage, was drawn up whereby {{the division}} would be parachuted in to support any of the five invasion beaches if serious delays were experienced. This plan turned out not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>required.</b>|$|E

5|$|After DNA damage, {{cell cycle}} checkpoints are activated. Checkpoint {{activation}} pauses the cell cycle {{and gives the}} cell time {{to repair the damage}} before continuing to divide. DNA damage checkpoints occur at the G1/S and G2/M boundaries. An intra-S checkpoint also exists. Checkpoint activation is controlled by two master kinases, ATM and ATR. ATM responds to DNA double-strand breaks and disruptions in chromatin structure, whereas ATR primarily responds to stalled replication forks. These kinases phosphorylate downstream targets in a signal transduction cascade, eventually leading to cell cycle arrest. A class of checkpoint mediator proteins including BRCA1, MDC1, and 53BP1 has also been identified. These proteins seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> for transmitting the checkpoint activation signal to downstream proteins.|$|E
5|$|Ependymal cells {{actively}} regulate neuronal fate {{specification of}} adult neural precursors through release of Noggin. Beating of the cilia of ependymal cells appears {{to set up}} concentration gradients of guidance molecules, such as cytokines TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor) and IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor), to direct migration of neuroblasts, {{such as in the}} RMS. Microglia also actively regulate adult neurogenesis. Under basal conditions, apoptotic corpses of newly generated neurons are rapidly phagocytosed from the niche by unactivated microglia in the adult SGZ. Under inflammatory conditions, reactivated microglia can have both beneficial and detrimental effects on different aspects of adult neurogenesis, depending on the balance between secreted molecules with pro- and anti-inflammatory action. In one study, the activation of microglia and recruitment of T cells were suggested <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> for enriched environment-induced SGZ neurogenesis, suggesting a possible role in the RMS.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Chief Justice Marshall's tenure, the Supreme Court {{had heard}} only two {{criminal}} casesboth by prerogative writ. First, in United States v. Hamilton (1795), the Court granted bail to a capital defendant charged with treasonas it was authorized {{to do by}} § 33 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 and § 4 of the Judiciary Act of 1793on an original writ of habeas corpus. The greater portion of the decision was dedicated to the Court's refusal to order the case tried by a special circuit court, as was provided for by § 3 of the Judiciary Act of 1793. Second, in United States v. Lawrence (1795), the Court declined to issue a writ of mandamus to compel a district judge to order the arrest of a deserter of the French navy, as the French government argued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> by the consular convention between the United States and France.|$|E

5|$|The {{disposal}} of military {{equipment and materials}} was also a key priority {{after the end of}} the war. Equipment with civilian uses such as motor vehicles, clothing and housing were urgently needed to counter shortages in the civilian economy. The timing of equipment release had to be carefully planned, however, to avoid harming employment by creating surpluses of manufactured goods. Planning for the {{disposal of}} equipment began in 1943 and the Commonwealth Disposals Commission was established to oversee the sale or destruction of equipment on September 1944. Before the commission was established the Government decided that ex-military equipment would be offered to other government agencies before being made available to the public, that sales to the public were to be made on a 'as is, where is' basis and be processed through existing trade channels or public auction at 'fair market prices' and that payment was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> in cash. Some special priorities were also established; farmers were to be given priority for motor vehicles, machine tools were to be allocated to ex-servicemen and training colleges and special consideration was to be given to the needs of the Red Cross and other overseas and domestic charitable associations.|$|E

25|$|The Inverted Terminal Repeat (ITR) {{sequences}} comprise 145 bases each. They {{were named}} {{so because of}} their symmetry, which was shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> for efficient multiplication of the AAV genome. The feature of these sequences that gives them this property is their ability to form a hairpin, which contributes to so-called self-priming that allows primase-independent synthesis of the second DNA strand. The ITRs were also shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> for both integration of the AAV DNA into the host cell genome (19th chromosome in humans) and rescue from it, {{as well as for}} efficient encapsidation of the AAV DNA combined with generation of a fully assembled, deoxyribonuclease-resistant AAV particles.|$|E
