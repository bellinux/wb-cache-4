Partizan just scored a goal to go up 1-0 and certain members of their fans Grobari fired a series of ship signaling rockets from the south stand where they traditionally gather as a way of celebrating the goal. Most of those rockets landed on the stadium's north stand where Red Star's fans Delije always gather, and one of them hit the unfortunate teenager right in the chest near his <b>throat,</b> <b>cutting</b> his aorta. He died almost instantly as he was being moved from the stands onto the stadium's athletic track and into the ambulance car.|$|E
50|$|The {{manner in}} which an animal is {{slaughtered}} in Islamic rituals is considered cruel and barbaric by Hindus, as Hindus consume Jhatka meat. Jhatka is meat from an animal that has been killed instantly, such as by a single strike of a sword or axe to sever the head, as opposed to ritualistically slow slaughter (kutha) in the halal method (dhabihah). Jhatka is the method of meat production demanded by most Hindus who eat meat, as this provides a quick and painless death to the animal. Both methods use sharp knives. In the Jhatka method, a swift uninterrupted cut severs the trachea, esophagus, carotid arteries, jugular veins, vagus nerves and the spine. In the Halal method, the slaughter is done with a swift deep incision {{with a sharp knife}} on the <b>throat,</b> <b>cutting</b> the jugular veins and carotid arteries of both sides but leaving the spinal cord and nervous tissue intact, followed by a period where the blood of the animal is drained out. A prayer to God is not required in the Jhatka method with each animal commercially slaughtered, but a prayer to God (Allah) is required at the start or if there is any interruption during Halal meat production.|$|E
50|$|In the United Kingdom, {{the film}} has {{had a history of}} {{problems}} with the BBFC over the years. The original cinema version was heavily cut with edits to the poker murder and the slashing of Ann's throat, and this print was later released on video prior to the UK's Video Recordings Act 1984 and subsequently banned as a video nasty. The film was made officially available in 1988, though the print had been pre-edited by 34 seconds (removing the cinema cuts) and then additionally cut by 4 minutes 11 seconds with further cuts to the opening stabbing, the bat attack, Norman's throat being torn out by Freudstein and tracking shots of mutilated bodies in the basement. The film was again released in 1992 with this version heavily pre-cut by the distributors, removing 7 minutes 27 seconds of footage and rendering much of the film unintelligible. The 2001 Vipco DVD issue restored nearly all of the film's prior edits but was cut by 33 secs by the BBFC with lesser edits made to the poker murder and a <b>throat</b> <b>cutting.</b> Although willing to release the movie uncut, the film had recently been prosecuted under the Obscene Publications Act following the discovery of bootleg copies of the uncut version, leaving the BBFC no choice but to cut the film. All the cuts were finally waived for the 2009 Arrow DVD.|$|E

50|$|Later, Batman {{brings in}} {{the killer of}} Dick's parents, a man called Jocko-boy Vanzetti. Batman tells him that even though Vanzetti killed his parents, someone else hired him to do so. Batman gives Grayson, {{who at the time}} had an axe, the choice of whether to kill Jocko-boy or not. Grayson cuts the tape over Vanzetti's mouth and asks him who hired him to kill his parents. The answer, much to Batman's disgust, is the Joker. Batman orders Grayson to make himself a costume. He does so using Robin Hood as an inspiration. He becomes an archer and wears a cape with a hood thus calling himself Hood. Batman, upon seeing this, pulls his hood down, telling him that anyone could do simply that. Batman tells him to lose the hood and calls him Robin. With his new alter-ego confirmed, he accompanies Batman to confront Green Lantern, as Batman and Green Lantern talk in one of Batman's safe houses which Robin had painted yellow in order to keep Hal Jordan from using his power ring. After a lengthy {{discussion}} in which Jordan loses his composure and strikes Batman, Jordan accuses Batman of kidnapping Grayson and dressing him up as his sidekick. Batman tells Jordan that Robin is not Grayson, but in fact a boy he met six years ago on a trip to Istanbul. He eventually retracts the lie and merely assures Jordan that Grayson is not Robin. Robin then reveals he took Jordan's power ring and after a short fight, Robin accidentally hits Jordan in the <b>throat,</b> <b>cutting</b> his air supply. Batman then hits Grayson to make him 'stay down', unmasks and performs a tracheotomy to save Jordan's life. After this, Batman reflects on the event, saying that he did not {{do a very good job}} of teaching Robin and then takes Robin to his parent's grave to grieve, claiming that is where it started. Dick cries and punches the headstone, after which Batman consoles his grieving and mournful young ward.|$|E
5000|$|British {{archaeologist}} Leonard Woolley {{discovered the}} tomb of Puabi, which was excavated by his team along with some 1800 other graves at the [...] "Royal Cemetery of Ur" [...] between 1922 and 1934. Puabi's tomb was clearly unique among the other excavations; {{not only because of}} the large amount of high quality and well-preserved grave goods, but also because her tomb had been untouched by looters through the millennia. The amount of grave goods that Woolley uncovered in Puabi's tomb was staggering: a magnificent, heavy, golden headdress made of golden leaves, rings, and plates; a superb lyre (see Lyres of Ur), complete with the golden and lapis-lazuli encrusted bearded bulls head; a profusion of gold tableware; golden, carnelian, and lapis lazuli cylindrical beads for extravagant necklaces and belts; a chariot adorned with lioness' heads in silver, and an abundance of silver, lapis lazuli, and golden rings and bracelets.She was also buried with 52 attendants [...] - [...] retainers who had been suspected by excavator Leonard Woolley to have poisoned themselves (or had been poisoned by others) to serve their mistress in the next world. Recent evidence derived from CAT scans through the University of Pennsylvania Museum suggests that some of the sacrifices were likely violent and caused by blunt force trauma. A pointed, weighted tool could explain the shatter patterns on the skulls that resulted in death, while a small hammer-like tool has also been found retrieved and catalogued by Woolley during his original excavation. The size and weight fit the damage sustained by the two bodies examined by Aubrey Baadsgaard, PhD candidate at the University of Pennsylvania. Cinnabar, or mercury vapour residue was observed as well, and it would have been utilized to prevent or slow the decomposition of the bodies for the necessary funerary rites.Italian archaeologist Massimo Vidale contends that although the blunt force trauma hypothesis is plausible, the causes of death may have also been <b>throat</b> <b>cutting</b> or, as previously thought, poisoning. Unfortunately the age and state of the remains complicates the process of examining them. Almost all of the remains are flattened and shattered by the layers of dirt in which they had been buried. Woolley's practice of pouring plaster to encompass skeletal remains has provided skeletons frozen in dried plaster, and modern imaging technology provides the opportunity to reconstruct and visualize the skulls as they would have been post-mortem prior to the damage caused by millennia of decay. Although there is still some debate on the precise causes and mechanisms of death, as well as the social implications of such practices, post-mortem dressing and arrangement of the corpses has been noted by several scholars. The bodies had been contorted into unnatural positions to imitate lying on each other's laps peacefully, sometimes oriented to hide parts of the skulls that could show damage or trauma. In addition, helmets and intricate headdresses had been placed on the heads, suggesting that the victims may have been killed outside the tombs, dressed, laid out, and after intricate ceremonies for Puabi, finally buried.|$|E

These manufacturers offer integrated solutions of both products and services called product service systems (PSS).

Through the alignment of incentives PSSs are a market compatible vehicle to reshape the manufacturing strategy towards more sustainability. The fundamental task for success in PSSs is to create a service gain.
