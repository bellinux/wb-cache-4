The semantic content of syntactic structures is established via the contrastive study of the English and Russian language systems and parallel <b>texts</b> <b>analysis.</b> The notion of cognitive transfer is employed which means that a language unit or structure can be singled out for transfer when there exists at least one language unit or structure with a similar meaning in the target language The approach taken is aimed at providing computational tractability and portability of linguistic presentation solutions for various language engineering purposes...|$|R

Each of the presented approaches is tested on a standard corpus of clinical texts. The obtained {{results show that the}} hybrid approach based on both machine learning and domain knowledge obtains the best performance. ...|$|R
