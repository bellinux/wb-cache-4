Dobro upravljanje z obratnim kapitalom pomeni premišljeno odločanje o obsegu zalog, terjatvah do kupcev in dolgovih. V nalogi se prepletata teoretični in empirični del. V empiričnem delu smo prikazali podatke za Skupino Gorenje, ki je eden izmed vodilnih evropskih izdelovalcev aparatov za dom. Na začetku naloge smo opredelili osnovne pojme, ki so povezani z obratnim kapitalom, v naslednjem poglavju smo opisali komponente obratnega kapitala, na koncu pa opredelili še politiko obratnega kapitala. Komponente obratnega kapitala so zaloge, terjatve do kupcev, denar in obveznosti do dobaviteljev, katerim smo v nalogi namenili največ pozornosti. Prikazali smo gibanje zalog, terjatev do kupcev in obveznosti do dobaviteljev za Skupino Gorenje, in sicer smo izračunali povprečne vrednosti le-teh, dneve vezav ter koeficiente obračanja. Ker mora podjetje obratna sredstva tudi financirati, smo poskušali preko krogotoka obratnega kapitala ugotoviti, kako hitrost obračanja obratnih sredstev vpliva na financiranje obratnega kapitala. Prišli smo do ugotovitve, da se s hitrejšim obračanjem obratnih sredstev znižujejo potrebe po virih financiranja. Za podjetje je dobro, da ima čim krajši cikel vezav zalog in terjatev do kupcev ter čim krajše dneve vezav obveznosti. Idealno bi bilo, če bi lahko podjetje zaloge in terjatve do kupcev financiralo z obveznostmi do dobaviteljev, vendar morajo podjetja v praksi običajno uporabljati še druge vire financiranja. V zadnjem poglavju smo se osredotočili na politiko obratnega kapitala, ki govori o višini obratnega kapitala v podjetju ter virih njihovega financiranja. Z ustrezno oblikovano politiko obratnega kapitala podjetje zniža potrebni obseg financiranja in poveča donosnost kapitala. The {{following}} master 2 ̆ 7 s dissertation {{is based}} on the working capital which companies should pay more attention to. Good working capital management means a well-informed decision-making when it comes to inventories, trade accounts receivables and debts. In the dissertation theoretical and empirical parts are intertwined with each other. The empirical part includes the data for Gorenje Group, one of the leading European manufacturers of household appliances. At the beginning of the dissertation there are definitions of basic concepts connected with the working capital, whereas the next chapter deals with the components of the working capital, finally followed by the working capital policy. Components of the working capital are inventories, trade accounts receivables, cash and <b>trade</b> accounts <b>payables</b> on which we have concentrated the most. The movements of inventories, trade accounts receivables and <b>trade</b> accounts <b>payables</b> have been shown for Gorenje Group and furthermore, the average values of these, the turnover ratio in days and the turnover ratio have been calculated. Since the company needs to finance the working capital, we have tried to determine how the rate of turning affects the working capital financing by means of the working capital conversion cycle. We {{have come to the conclusion}} that the high turnover of the working capital reduces the need for financing the resources. It is better for the company to have shorter days of inventories turnover, trade accounts receivables and <b>trade</b> accounts <b>payables</b> turnover. The perfect situation would be if the company could finance its inventories and trade accounts receivables with the <b>trade</b> accounts <b>payables.</b> However, in reality companies need to search for other resources of financing. In the last chapter we are focused on the working capital policy, which talks about the amount of the working capital in the company and resources for their financing. With appropriately formed working capital policy the company reduces the necessary range of financing and increases the return of capital...|$|R

40|$|Project (M. B. A., Business Administration (Finance)) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2009. It {{has often}} been said that "Cash is the lifeblood of any organization. " This {{statement}} {{is especially true for}} the Construction industry when subcontractor payments often do not follow general <b>trade</b> <b>payable</b> schedules. Because of this, more cash on hand is necessary for successfully performing the contracted work. A. Teichert & Son is a very conservative, cash rich company. It {{has come up with a}} system to reward a healthy and positive cash flow and aggressive collection and billing efforts by Construction and Materials. When inventory and retention are held and the accounts receivable balance ages, money and other resources are tied up. A company with limited cash reserves would have to borrow money to cover expenses. Companies that are cash healthy may instead choose to assess a "charge" to revenue producing business units. This charge is calculated at the administrative or corporate (non-revenue producing) level and is allocated to revenue producing business units or companies based on their changes in A/R, changes in inventory, changes in retention, and change in work in progress. This charge is meant to encourage revenue producing business units to collect aging accounts receivable, bill clients aggressively, reduce inventory, and release retention on jobs (when appropriate). Problems with this carry charge include quantifying the opportunity cost (or the return on investment that could be achieved had the cash been available), making this charge relevant to a service organization (such as a construction division) as well as a manufacturing division where inventory is more easily quantified, and gaining employee buy-in for a "pretend" charge that ends up being eliminated at year end. Sources of data used in this analysis include Construction trade journals, academic journals, newspapers, magazines, internet sources, and several interviews conducted with employees working in the Construction and Materials Manufacturing industries. While one size does not fit all when calculating a cost of carry, the basic factors that should be considered if doing so are the opportunity cost or the cost of capital, the company's overall cash position, extra work that is required in calculating this charge, and the challenge of rolling out a new process to an organization.

40|$|According to {{previous}} studies, a bank can set a higher interest rate for small firms {{by establishing a}} lending relationship since information asymmetry limits competition between banks. Therefore, the bank can acquire monopoly rent from small firms. However, if small firms can use trade credit which is another financial source, the bank cannot extract monopoly rent. In this article, we examine whether small firms can use trade credit if the bank sets a higher interest rate. Using panel data of small firms in Japan, our analysis shows that when the interest rate the bank sets is too severe or worsened for the borrower, the ratio of <b>trade</b> <b>payables</b> increases and the bank loses its amount of loans.

In Peter Raich, a cash method taxpayer transferred all of the assets and liabilities of his sole proprietorship to a controlled corporation.

40|$|This paper explores a {{financial}} role of Japanese general trading companies (GTCs), which {{act as a}} central point in a distribution network among group firms. I examine Meltzer’s conjecture, which holds that financially strong companies like GTCs increase trade receivables and reduce <b>trade</b> <b>payables</b> to shield their trading partners from a monetary squeeze. First, I investigate the trade credit granted to each other by GTCs and all its trade partners. The panel estimation demonstrates that both trade receivables and <b>trade</b> <b>payables</b> decrease during periods of monetary tightness and increase during those of monetary ease. In response {{to a change in}} a bank-lending indicator, there is little difference between trade receivables and payables. Thus GTCs become neither net-credit providers nor net-credit takers from this behavior. In other words, interfirm financing passing through a GTC’s balance sheet positively correlates with banking financing. Therefore, the Meltzer hypothesis does not hold for transactions between GTCs and all their trade partners. Instead, gross trade credit functions as a complement to macroeconomic bank lending. Second, I examine trade credit by dividing GTCs’ trading partners into related companies (i. e., subsidiaries and associate firms) and non-related companies. In terms of the reactions of trade credit to market financial indicators, I did not find statistically significant evidence that the Meltzer hypothesis works in either case. No matter with whom a GTC trades, interfirm financing passing through the GTC’s balance sheet moves positively in concert with banking financing. A major difference between related and non-related companies lies {{in the way in which}} trade receivables react to a GTC’s individual financial situation (that is, a firm’s individual interest expense rate minus a market’s interest rate). An increase in the interest gap induces a GTC to incur extra expenses over the market rate. In this situation, a GTC reduces trade receivables to non-related firms, but not those to related firms. This behavior eventually works as a shield, protecting their related companies from sharing the parent company’s interest costs. ...|$|E

40|$|Driven by the {{increasingly}} {{important role of}} supply chains in global production, this paper studies empirical association between global credit-market shocks and firm behavior towards liquidity needs across countries and industries. Focusing on the adjustment of working-capital financing, we find two pieces of supporting evidence from international firm-level panel data covering the period 2002 :I - 2012 :IV. First, for industries where specific investment in the input supplier-customer relationship is large, firms are more exposed to credit-market shocks. We find that measures of global credit-market shocks are negatively associated with trade receivables, <b>trade</b> <b>payables,</b> and inventories, conditional {{on the level of}} contract intensity in the industries where firms operate. Second, firms in emerging markets are more vulnerable to credit-market shocks than are firms in developed countries.

40|$|We {{propose a}} simple theory of trade credit and prepayment. A {{downstream}} firm trades off inventory holding costs against lost sales. Lost final sales impose a negative externality on the upstream firm. We show that allowing the downstream firm to pay with a delay, an arrangement known as “trade credit,” {{is precisely the}} solution to the problem. Solving a reverse externality accounts for the use of prepayment for inputs, {{even in the absence of}} any risk of default by the downstream firm. We clarify previously unexplained facts including the universal presence of a zerointerest component in trade credit terms, and the non-responsiveness of interest charges to fluctuations in the bank rate as well as market demand. We explain why trade credit is short term credit and why the level of provision is negatively related to sales and profit and inventory, but positively related to the profit margin. Finally, we show that under trade credit, inventory investment is invariant to the real interest rate for a wide range of parameters, explaining the puzzle posed by Blinder and Maccini (1991).

In countries where the trade credit channel is more present, the marginal impact is lower, but the total impact is still bigger. Further, firms that are more vulnerable to shocks in the financial market and firms that are more likely to be financially constrained rely more on the trade credit chan-nel to finance growth.

This paper shows that, {{for the purposes}} of profitability analysis and equity valuation, two types of leverage are relevant, one indeed from financing activities but another from operating activities. Financial statement analysis that distinguishes the two types of leverage explains differences in shareholder profitability and the prices at which firms trade over their book values.

However, while some debt [...] like bank loans and bonds issued [...] is due to financing, other debt [...] like <b>trade</b> <b>payables,</b> deferred revenues, and pension liabilities [...] results from transactions with customers and suppliers in conducting operations.

In contrast, firms are viewed as being able to add value in operations because operations involve trading in (input and output) product markets that are less perfect than capital markets. So there are a priori reasons to view debt arising in operations differently from debt that arises in financing...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the role of}} trade finance in the trade collapse of 2008 - 09 {{from the perspective of}} the Korean economy. We use two approaches. Firstly, as background to a more formal analysis, we make a casual observation on the behavior of aggregate data on trade finance, on which Korea has relatively abundant data. Aggregate data do not convincingly support the view that trade finance played an active role in causing the trade collapse. The measures of trade finance and the value of trade both dropped sharply, but the ratio of trade finance over trade was stable and in some cases increased during the crisis period. Secondly, using quarterly data on listed firms in Korea, we conduct panel estimations to test whether firms that are more dependent on external finance experienced greater export contraction during the crisis. Our regression analysis suggests that the financial vulnerability of firms, measured by various financial ratios, did not contribute to export contraction during the financial crisis. This observation largely applies even to smaller firms, who are usually thought of as being more vulnerable financially. However, we find that small exporters that relied heavily on cross-border <b>trade</b> <b>payables</b> or receivables suffered larger drops in export growth during the crisis...|$|E
40|$|The company {{ability to}} collect {{accounts}} and pay debt was one {{measurement of the}} company performance so that the company could survive in the market to {{serve the needs of}} consumers. This study aimed to reveal the effect of the company ability to collect accounts receivable to the company ability to pay short-term <b>trade</b> <b>payables.</b> This study used a descriptive research method with empirical studies approach. The population was 33 goods production companies listed in the Indonesia Stock Exchange while the study samples were all study population. The analysis techniques used in this study were the accounts receivable turnover ratio, account receivables collection period, current ratio, and multiple regression analysis. The results showed that: First, there was no partial effect of trade receivables turnover ratio to the current ratio at large trading company production of goods listed in the Indonesia Stock Exchange. Second, there was a partial effect of accounts receivable collection period to the current ratio at large trading company production of goods listed in the Indonesia Stock Exchange. Third, the accounts receivable turnover ratio and accounts receivable collection period had a simultaneous effect to the current ratio at large trading company production of goods listed in Indonesia Stock Exchange...|$|E
30|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the existing literature {{on the impact of}} corporate taxation on firms’ capital structure, further developing the contributions of previous literature in different ways. Firstly, we provide additional empirical evidence on the relationship between taxes and debt financing. In contrast with other papers, our measure of leverage includes only financial debt and directly excludes other liabilities such as <b>trade</b> <b>payables,</b> which mainly depend on business transactions and not on the effect of corporate taxation. Secondly, our findings shed some light on this issue in the European Union, which has received little attention to date in the literature. Moreover, International Financial Reporting Standards were adopted in Spain on January 1 st 2007, which allows meaningful comparison between our results and those from other economies that have also implemented these international standards. Thirdly, we take into account the Spanish corporate tax reform in 2012, as an exogenous shock, which enacted a new thin-capitalization rule limiting the tax deductibility of financing expenses. Besides, and as similar tax reforms have been conducted in many OECD countries, we believe that our conclusions might be portable to other settings. Applying a difference in differences approach, we analyse the potential impact of the abovementioned reform. Finally, we study a special period partially characterized by a severe economic and financial crisis that has dramatically affected European Mediterranean countries such as Spain.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{efficient}} use of working capital at PT. Semen Gresik (Persero) Tbk, PT. Indocement Tunggal Prakarsa Tbk and PT. Holcim Indonesia Tbk. To compare the efficiency of working capital at PT. Semen Gresik (Persero) Tbk, PT. Indocement Tunggal Prakarsa Tbk and PT. Holcim Indonesia Tbk. The analytical tool used to assess the efficiency of working capital and liquidity ratio is the ratio of the activity. After calculating the level of efficiency and interpret ratio analysis to assess the comparative efficiency of working capital at PT. Semen Gresik (Persero) Tbk, PT. Indocement Tbk and PT. Holcim Indonesia Tbk with a standard measurement of efficiency in the use of working capital. From the results of this study concluded that of the three cement companies that have gone public with the most efficient value for rotation of working capital is PT. Holcim Indonesia Tbk this is because the PT. Holcim Indonesia Tbk is the only cement company that pioneered the development of business and has not been so great that the company's <b>trade</b> <b>payables</b> have not so big. While the PT. Semen Gresik (Persero) Tbk and PT. Indocement Tunggal Prakarsa Tbk is the first cement company stands and larger when compared to PT. Holcim Indonesia Tbk and have debts greater effort when compared with PT. Holcim Indonesia Tbk. That's why the working capital turnover to PT. Semen Gresik (Persero) Tbk and PT.
