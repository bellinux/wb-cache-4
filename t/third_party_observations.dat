40|$|The {{attachment}} of a {{child and}} his or her caregiver is a bond that helps tie them together emotionally. The most important principle of attachment theory is the need {{of a child}} to develop a relationship with at least one primary caregiver for healthy emotional and social development to occur. The majority of attachment research has focused primarily on mother-child attachment, minimizing fathers 2 ̆ 7 contributions to attachment. The current study examined attachment of both mothers and fathers in two-parent families. Research questions focused on the relationship between mother-child attachment and father-child attachment, the relationship between child temperament and father-child attachment security, and whether the amount of time each parent is away from his/her child predicts attachment security. The participants in this study consisted of 50 sets of parents (100 participants) who had at least one child between the ages of 3 - 5. The relationship between father-child and mother-child attachment was not significant. Likewise, the relationship between child temperament and parent-child attachment was not significant. Also, parents 2 ̆ 7 time away from their child was not a significant predictor of attachment. Further research is needed with more ethnicities and cultures represented; a more balanced sample of economic classes; mothers who work more hours outside of the home; and the use of more impartial, <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>observation</b> measures to assess attachment and child temperament...|$|R

The answers to these {{questions}} are generated, and then lost, in thousands of law offices daily. There is thus a treasure of information, but it is mostly hidden from our view by legal barriers that protect privacy and confidentiality and by other barriers, economic, psychological, and logistical, that inhibit or preclude <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>observation</b> of lawyer-client contact. This Article reports an exploratory journey in search of that treasure, a journey into six law offices in the metropolitan areas of two states. In these offices I observed the initial consultation between consumer bankruptcy lawyers and individuals seeking legal assistance in connection with personal financial distress. The report of my observations introduces Lawyers A through F, each of whom devotes a significant portion of their time to consumer bankruptcy counseling. It describes the general structural characteristics and pertinent details of the consumer bankruptcy law practice of each lawyer. The report also identifies the differing attitudes of these lawyers about the alternative solutions to the financial distress of their consumer bankruptcy clients and reveals significant differences in the structure, content, and style of their interviewing and counseling behavior. This prosaic description is complemented by samples of dialogues between the lawyers and clients whom I observed. The dialogues are reproduced in Appendix, A. I have strived to observe carefully and to report faithfully. To the extent of my success in that effort, the descriptions of lawyer-client contact that follow offer a meaningful picture of interviewing and counseling behavior in the metropolitan consumer bankruptcy law office...|$|R

40|$|This article {{systematically}} {{examines the}} varying effectiveness of African and non-African <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> in mediating civil wars in Africa. Drawing {{on data from}} the Uppsala Conflict Data Program, supplemented with unique data on mediation efforts, which together cover all mediation efforts in civil wars in Africa between 1960 and 2012, this article presents quantitative evidence supporting the effectiveness of African <b>third</b> <b>parties.</b> Compared to non-African <b>third</b> <b>parties,</b> African <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> {{are far more likely}} to conclude peace agreements and these peace agreements are more likely to be durable. Most effective, however, are mixed mediation efforts in which there is coordination between African and non-African <b>third</b> <b>parties,</b> but in which African <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> take the lead. The phrase, ‘African solutions to African challenges’ should thus be understood as a division of labour and responsibilities, rather than an excuse for non-African <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> to ignore Africa’s problems or African <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> acting on their own. Indeed, whilst African <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> should take the lead in mediation processes in African civil wars, non-African <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> should support these processes by lending additional strength. Through supplementing each other’s comparative advantages, African and non-African <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> can more effectively resolve civil wars in Africa...|$|R

Taking network theory as our theoretical perspective we explore if and how <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> {{play a role in the}} funding process.

40|$|How is two-party electoral {{competition}} {{influenced by}} <b>third</b> <b>parties,</b> even under normal political conditions? I {{argue that the}} mere threat of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> entry into the election induces anticipatory electoral strategies by the major parties. This effect, which is a normal aspect of the two-party system, is how <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> play a consistent role in U. S. elections. The ability for <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> to influence the major parties is moderated by electoral institutions. The ballot access requirement, {{in the form of}} a signature requirement, varies widely across House elections and is a significant predictor of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> electoral success. Consistent with conventional wisdom, I find that it has a negative effect on the likelihood of entry. Notably, the requirement also has a positive effect on <b>third</b> <b>party</b> vote shares, conditional on successful petitioning, due to a screening and quality effect. I explore the effects of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> threat in unidimensional and multidimensional settings. A formal model of elections predicts that the threat of entry induces major party divergence in a unidimensional ideological space. The major parties diverge in anticipation of potential <b>third</b> <b>party</b> entry. An empirical analysis of candidate positioning in the 1996 U. S. House elections finds support of this hypothesis. Data on major party campaign advertising in the 2000 to 2004 U. S. House elections are used to assess <b>third</b> <b>party</b> effects in a multidimensional framework. I show that <b>third</b> <b>party</b> threat influences the scope and content of campaign advertising. Major party candidates, particularly incumbents, discuss a broader range of issues when <b>third</b> <b>party</b> threat is higher. I use the case of environmental issues and the Green party to assess the influence of <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> on issue-specific content. I find that Green party threat leads to predictable differences between Democratic and Republican advertising on environmental issues. In sum, <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> play a consistent role in U. S. House elections by inducing anticipatory strategies by the major parties. This strategic framework for understanding <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> stresses two things. First, one should focus on the major parties in order to gauge the influence of <b>third</b> <b>parties.</b> Second, one should not conclude that <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> are irrelevant because of their minimal electoral success. <b>Third</b> <b>party</b> effects are in fact present even in elections where a <b>third</b> <b>party</b> does not enter.
