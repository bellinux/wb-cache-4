5|$|An {{aspect of}} Murder on the Orient Express which many reviewers praised was the game's audio. The voice acting in {{particular}} gained widespread positive reviews. GameSpot called the voice acting excellent, {{with the voice}} actors bringing the characters to life, thanks largely to David Suchet as Poirot. IGN also called the voice acting well done, despite a few characters sounding artificial. Music in the game was positively reviewed by 2404, who {{said that it was}} tense at moments, but probably could have been played more frequently throughout the game. 2404 also praised <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>for</b> providing realistic sound effects, such as noises coming from the Orient Express itself, and other environmental noises such as howling wind. IGN, in contrast, heavily criticized <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>for</b> a lack of background music, and simplistic and monotonous sound effects.|$|E
5|$|Gimmick! {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} {{and a lack}} of interest at release. Distributors were more interested in games for the new 16-bit systems, so Sakai found difficulty in getting the game localized outside Japan.

Ultimately, the only distributor that imported the game was Swedish distributor Bergsala, which released it in 1993 in small quantities across the Scandinavian market. Critics both praised and criticized <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>for</b> its challenging difficulty, and some thought the game was designed exclusively for children due to its character design. In retrospective reviews, Gimmick! has received more praise, even seeing a re-release in Japan in 2002 for the PlayStation.|$|E

One of the crackers said that while most 1980s games could be cracked by automation, Gumball protections, coded by Roland Gustafsson, were exceptional.|$|E

Ultimately, the team settled on a minimum set of requirements, even though that left nearly 30 types of Android phones unable to run the game, including some newly released phones. It was released on October 15, 2010. One month after the initial release on Android, Rovio Mobile began designing a lite version of <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>for</b> these other devices.|$|E
