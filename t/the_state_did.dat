5|$|Indiana put further {{restrictions}} on African Americans, prohibiting them from testifying {{in court in}} a case against a white man. The new constitution of 1851 expanded suffrage for white males, but excluded blacks from suffrage. While <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>did</b> not have legal segregation, it excluded black children from public schools {{as a matter of}} custom.|$|E
5|$|East Germany's {{communities}} had a {{much harder}} time, because the country was poorer and their government imposed severe restrictions on them. The border region was progressively depopulated through the clearance of numerous villages and the forced relocation of their inhabitants. Border towns suffered draconian building restrictions: inhabitants were forbidden from building new houses and even repairing existing buildings, causing infrastructure to fall into severe decay. <b>The</b> <b>state</b> <b>did</b> little but to provide a 15% income supplement to those living in the Sperrzone and Schutzstreifen; but this did not halt the shrinkage of the border population, as younger people moved elsewhere to find employment and better living conditions.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{adoption}} of the current state flag of West Virginia, the state had been represented by a number of flags since attaining statehood in 1863, all of which proved impractical. The first West Virginia Legislature commissioned Joseph H. Diss Debar of Doddridge County to design the Great Seal of West Virginia in 1863. On September 26, 1863, the West Virginia Legislature officially adopted the seal designed by Diss Debar, a stylized version of which was also designated the state's coat of arms. Despite {{the adoption}} of an official seal, <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>did</b> not decide upon an official state flag until 1905.|$|E

5|$|After Mindaugas' death, <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>did</b> not {{disintegrate}} and Treniota {{took over}} the title of Grand Duke. However, his power was fragile; he was challenged by Tautvilas, who had not forgotten his own claims to power. Tautvilas was also assassinated by Treniota. However, just a year later, in 1264, Treniota was killed by Mindaugas' former servants. His son Vaišvilkas and his brother-in-law Shvarn from Volhynia {{took over the}} control in Lithuania. Daumantas was forced to flee to Pskov, was baptized Timofei, ruled successfully from 1266 to 1299 and even became a saint. In 1265 Vaišvilkas, as a Christian, reconciled with the Livonian Order and, without support from Lithuania, the rebellions among the Balts that had been fueled by Treniota began to subside. In 1267 he returned to a monastic life and transferred the Grand Duchy to Shvarn.|$|E
5|$|Romney {{sought to}} bring near-universal health {{insurance}} coverage to the state. This came after Staples founder Tom Stemberg told him {{at the start of}} his term that doing so would be the best way he could help people. Another factor was that the federal government, owing to the rules of Medicaid funding, threatened to cut $385million in those payments to Massachusetts if <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>did</b> not reduce the number of uninsured recipients of health care services. Although the idea of universal health insurance had not come to the fore during the campaign, Romney decided that because people without insurance still received expensive health care, the money spent by the state for such care could be better used to subsidize insurance for the poor.|$|E

5|$|The Delmar Bypass {{was opened}} in December 1963, {{connecting}} Elm Avenue {{in the west}} to U.S. Route9W in the east. <b>The</b> <b>state</b> <b>did</b> not add traffic lights to any of the four intersections on the bypass as a late 1963 study indicated that the signals were unnecessary. In mid-January 1964, the Bethlehem Town Board pushed the state to add traffic lights to every intersection in the wake of several accidents and near-misses at the crossings. This request was eventually granted. The Delmar Bypass did not have a signed route number until the 1970s when NY32 was realigned to follow the highway. As a result, NY335 no longer connected to a signed route at its south end.|$|E
5|$|The case arose when a Minnesota county taxed an Indian's {{mobile home}} {{located on the}} reservation. The Court ruled that <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>did</b> not have the {{authority}} to impose such a tax or, more generally, to regulate behavior on the reservation. Bryan has become a landmark case that has led to Indian gaming on reservations and altered the economic status of almost every Indian tribe. Later decisions, citing Bryan, ruled that Public Law 280 allows states to enact prohibitions, or crimes, that would apply on reservations, but could not impose regulations on conduct that was otherwise allowed. The case has also called into question the ability of the states to impose any sort of regulations on tribal reservations, such as labor standards and certain traffic regulations.|$|E
5|$|The final {{piece of}} the Relief Route {{associated}} with US 113 was the Puncheon Run Connector, which would provide a direct connection between US 13 and DE 1 and US 113. The connector and its partial interchange with US 113 were built between 1998 and 2000. In 2003, the same year the last portion of the Relief Route was completed, DelDOT requested US 113 be eliminated from Milford to Dover {{in favor of the}} sole designation of DE 1 from Milford to Dover. AASHTO denied DelDOT's application at their spring 2003 meeting because <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>did</b> not address the status of US 113 Alternate. The organization approved DelDOT's application to also eliminate US 113 Alternate in addition to the MilfordDover portion of US 113 at their annual meeting later in 2003. Bay Road became an unnumbered highway between Exit 95 at Dover Air Force Base and the old northern terminus of US113 at US13 in Dover.|$|E

5|$|In 1918, when Wisconsin {{initially}} numbered its highway system, {{the route}} of what later became US141 followed two separate state highways: WIS17 from downtown Milwaukee to Manitowoc and WIS16 from Manitowoc north to Green Bay. Segments that later became US141 in Wisconsin were numbered WIS15 between Green Bay and Abrams, and WIS38 between Abrams and Wausaukee. North of Wausaukee, the future US Highway was an unnumbered secondary highway. In 1919, Michigan signed its highway system, but <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>did</b> not have a highway running south from Quinnesec to the state line. The highway from Quinnesec into Iron Mountain was part of M-12. The segment through Florence County, Wisconsin, was WIS69, and from the Crystal Falls area north to Covington, the M-69 moniker was used. In 1919, the WIS38 designation was extended northward to Niagara and the state line. The highway was straightened to eliminate a series of sharp curves between Crivitz and Beaver in 1921. The same year, WIS17 was realigned between Sheboygan and Cedar Grove to run via Oostburg. WIS17 was also realigned in 1922 to follow a separate routing south of Port Washington; previously it was routed concurrently with WIS57 in the area. By 1924, maps showed an unnumbered roadway running south from Quinnesec to connect with WIS57 at the state line.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, {{plans were}} made for US 140 to be decommissioned, with PA 97 to replace the section in Pennsylvania. This {{proposal}} was made in order to eliminate short routes from the United States Numbered Highways system. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials approved {{the removal of the}} US 140 designation on October 28, 1977. In December 1978, the borough of Littlestown protested the renumbering of US 140 to PA 97. When the US 140 designation was retired on January 1, 1979, it was replaced by MD 140 from Baltimore to Westminster, and Maryland and Pennsylvania coordinated to have matching routes 97 {{on both sides of the}} state line between Westminster and Gettysburg. The northern terminus of PA 97 was located at the US 15 interchange, while the stretch of the former US 140 north into Gettysburg became unnumbered Baltimore Pike. With this change, the US 140 signs were removed from the square in downtown Gettysburg, and no signs directing motorists to PA 97 were put in their place. This move hurt businesses in the Littlestown area as motorists were unable to get to them without a marked route. <b>The</b> <b>state</b> <b>did</b> put signs directing motorists to PA 97 at the US 15 interchange and at the intersection of US 15 Business and Baltimore Street; however, signs for PA 97 were not placed in the square due to opposition from local officials in Gettysburg who did not want sign clutter in the square. The stretch of Baltimore Pike from the bypass to US 15 Business became State Route 2035 by 1989. PA 97 and the adjacent portion of Baltimore Pike were widened through the US 15 interchange in 2000.|$|E
