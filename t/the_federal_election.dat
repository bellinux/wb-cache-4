5|$|Riel's {{execution}} and Macdonald's refusal to commute his sentence caused lasting discord in Quebec, {{and led to}} a fundamental alteration in the Canadian political order.

This led to the victory of the Liberal party under Sir Wilfrid Laurier in <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>election</b> of 1896, which in turn set the stage for the domination of Canadian federal politics by the Liberal party in the 20th century.|$|E

Although not naturally suited to life in the federal parliament, he made significant contributions, and was outspoken in his efforts to assist returned servicemen, particularly those with whom he had served. This outspokenness often took the form of arguing in the Senate in relation to the new legislation being brought before it, when such legislation involved the defence forces. At other times, he would personally champion the cause of those men who had been in his battalion.|$|E
