5|$|The {{remaining}} 38, all small except one, are irregular satellites, whose orbits {{are much}} farther from Saturn, have high inclinations, and are mixed between prograde and retrograde. These moons are probably captured minor planets, or {{debris from the}} breakup of such bodies after they were captured, creating collisional families. <b>The</b> <b>irregular</b> satellites have been classified by their orbital characteristics into the Inuit, Norse, and Gallic groups, and their names are chosen from the corresponding mythologies. The largest of <b>the</b> <b>irregular</b> moons is Phoebe, the ninth moon of Saturn, discovered {{at the end of}} the 19th century.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Irregular</b> at Magic High School, {{known in}} Japanese as , is a Japanese web novel series by Tsutomu Satō. It was {{published}} on Shōsetsuka ni Narō, an internet web novel website, between October 2008 and March 2011. Satō reached {{a deal with}} Dengeki Bunko and began releasing his work in a light novel format beginning July 2011. In 2013, each story arc received a manga adaptation with varying manga artists and publishers. That same year, an anime adaptation by Madhouse was announced and was broadcast between April and September 2014. <b>The</b> <b>Irregular</b> at Magic High School franchise had been localized for English by two companies: The light novels {{and one of the}} manga adaptations are licensed by Yen Press while Aniplex of America licensed the anime series. The anime series was simulcasted on four networks, and was later made available on Netflix.|$|E

5|$|As of 2005 Uranus {{is known}} to have nine {{irregular}} moons, which orbit it at a distance much greater than that of Oberon, the furthest of the large moons. All <b>the</b> <b>irregular</b> moons are probably captured objects that were trapped by Uranus soon after its formation. The diagram illustrates the orbits of those irregular moons discovered so far. The moons above the X axis are prograde, those beneath are retrograde. The radius of the Uranian Hill sphere is approximately 73million km.|$|E
5|$|Both commanders were {{a product}} of the {{environment}} of European warfare, which generally took place in open fields with relatively easy mobility, and were thus uncomfortable with woodland warfare. Neither liked <b>the</b> <b>irregular</b> warfare practiced by the Indians and British counterparts like Rogers' Rangers, but saw them as a necessary evil, given the operating environment. Although the French depended on Indian support to increase their comparatively small numbers throughout the war, Indian forces were quite low in this battle, and Montcalm generally disliked them and their practices.|$|E
5|$|Chord {{inversion}} {{is especially}} simple in major-thirds tuning. Chords are inverted simply by raising {{one or two}} notes three strings. The raised notes are played with the same finger as the original notes. Thus, major and minor chords are played on two frets in M3tuning {{even when they are}} inverted. In contrast, inversions of chords in standard tuning require three fingers on a span of four frets, in standard tuning, the shape of inversions depends on the involvement of <b>the</b> <b>irregular</b> major-third.|$|E

She is often picked on by Oona, as she is the {{youngest}} and smallest of <b>the</b> <b>Irregulars.</b> She is first really introduced at the age eleven, but first appears in the series a seven-year-old. Iris is first mentioned in the series in the first book, as she encounters <b>the</b> <b>Irregulars</b> as they are escaping from the Shadow City. In later books, she becomes an official member. She often assisted DeeDee during experiments and has developed a perfume that makes other people trust the wearer. Her parents travel a lot, and they once brought back a very strong smelling perfume that turns out to keep the rats of the shadow city at bay.|$|R

40|$|After {{discussing}} {{the role of}} prior information in statistical inference, historically and in current problems, we analyze the problem of seasonal adjustment in economics. Litterman (1980) has shown how informative priors for autoregressive coefficients can improve economic forecasts. We find that in seasonal adjustment informative priors can have amuch greater effect on our conclusions. In our model, even the dimensionality of the joint posterior distribution of <b>the</b> <b>irregulars</b> depends on prior information about the seasonal component; and some functions of <b>the</b> <b>irregulars</b> can be determined more accurately than in sampling theory...|$|R
5|$|From {{the figure}} of the artist, the viewer's eye leaps again diagonally into the {{pictorial}} space. Another man stands, echoing and opposing the form of the artist, outside rather than inside, made clearly defined and yet barely identifiable by the light and shade. The positioning of such an area of strong tonal contrast right {{at the rear of the}} pictorial space is a daring compositional tactic. The shapes of bright light are similar to <b>the</b> <b>irregular</b> light shapes of the foreground Maid of Honour, but the sharply defined door-frame repeats the border of the mirror.|$|E
5|$|In 858, Bardas deposed patriarch Ignatios and {{appointed}} Photios, well-educated but a layman, in his stead. Later chronicles report that Ignatios had excluded Bardas from communion because he maintained an incestuous relationship {{with one of}} his daughters-in-law, but the real reason for Ignatios's deposition was probably the patriarch's staunch refusal to tonsure Empress Theodora against her will, as demanded by Bardas. <b>The</b> <b>irregular</b> elevation of Photios, however, riled with Pope Nicholas I, who refused to recognize it. Coupled with competition between Rome and Constantinople over their missionary activities in and jurisdiction over Moravia and Bulgaria, relations with the papacy remained tense.|$|E
5|$|Irregular moons {{are small}} {{satellites}} with large-radii, inclined, and frequently retrograde orbits, {{believed to have}} been acquired by the parent planet through a capture process. They often occur as collisional families or groups. The precise size as well as albedo of <b>the</b> <b>irregular</b> moons are not known for sure because the moons are very small to be resolved by a telescope, although the latter is usually assumed to be quite low—around 6% (albedo of Phoebe) or less. The irregulars generally have featureless visible and near infrared spectra dominated by water absorption bands. They are neutral or moderately red in color—similar to C-type, P-type, or D-type asteroids, though they are much less red than Kuiper belt objects.|$|E

5|$|It is {{estimated}} that between 1493 and 1793 sejms were held 240 times. Jędruch gives a higher number of 245, and notes that 192 of those were successfully completed, passing legislation. 32 sejms were vetoed with the infamous liberum veto, particularly {{in the first half}} of the 18th century. The last two sejms of the Commonwealth were <b>the</b> <b>irregular</b> four-year Great Sejm (1788–92), which passed the Constitution of the 3 May, and the infamous Grodno Sejm (1793) where deputies, bribed or coerced by the Russian Empire following the Commonwealth defeat in the War in Defense of the Constitution, annulled the short-lived Constitution and passed the act of Second Partition of Poland.|$|E
5|$|Movements of grey-headed {{flying foxes}} are {{influenced}} by the availability of food. Their population is very fluid, as they move in response to <b>the</b> <b>irregular</b> blossoming of certain plant species. They are keystone pollinators and seed disperses over 100 species of native trees and plants. The grey-headed flying fox is a partial migrant that uses winds to facilitate long-distance movement. It does not migrate in a specific direction, but rather in the direction that will be the most beneficial at the time.|$|E
5|$|On August 25, 2016, {{a similar}} {{phenomenon}} was reported for another stellar object: EPIC 204278916, a young M-type pre-main-sequence star with a resolved disk. Dimmings {{of up to}} 65% for 25 consecutive days (out of 79 total observation) were observed. The variability is highly periodic and attributed to stellar rotation. The researchers hypothesize that <b>the</b> <b>irregular</b> dimmings are caused by either a warped inner-disk edge or transiting cometary-like objects in either circular or eccentric orbits.|$|E
