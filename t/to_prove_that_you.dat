He actually told the American government that I'm {{going to do this}} deal to try and prove to those within Pakistan, and in Pakistan's state apparatus, who think that these guys can be negotiated with — I will negotiate with them only <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can't negotiate with them, because they will break the deal. And as soon as they broke the deal, the army is back in, the fighting is going on, {{and you can see the}} results." ...|$|E
60|$|It is hopeless <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{are not a}} hero {{when your}} disclaimers are {{themselves}} taken as a proof of heroism. Frank shrugged his shoulders.|$|E
6000|$|... "If you {{are able}} <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are better," [...] said the Prince to the little man, [...] "I will make you the Chief Wizard of this domain. Otherwise--" ...|$|E
60|$|Pand. But <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> Helen loves him, she comes, {{and puts}} me her white {{hand to his}} cloven chin.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I didn’t believe it, Jem," [...] {{said his}} wife. [...] "I’m trying <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> {{the bird was}} not truthful, but you’re so hard to persuade." ...|$|R
60|$|Therefore, my {{discourse}} at {{this time}} shall be directed <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> <b>that</b> there is no solid, firm foundation for virtue, but on a conscience which is guided by religion.|$|R
6000|$|... "I see {{the point}} {{you are trying to}} make, Rover. You are trying <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were placed under arrest, so to speak, before you were under our {{authority}} here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He doesn’t {{like to be}} put in the wrong," [...] said Miss Ward. [...] "He wants <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> haven’t got any courage. He’d be {{disappointed}} if he found you had." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “On {{a charge}} of {{breaking}} up my former company and running off with some of my things,” replied Nathan Wampole, triumphantly. “I’ve got witnesses <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> two fellows are thieves.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Well, you see, {{this paper}} <b>proves</b> <b>that</b> some Mr. Ramornie paid seventy guineas for a chaise,’ said the fellow. ‘That’s {{all well and}} good; but who’s <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> me <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are Mr. Ramornie?’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But are {{you sure}} of that?" [...] She did not answer, for in this {{masquerade}} banter she had somehow been growing unhappy. [...] "Shall I <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have seen me before? You dare not let me unmask." ...|$|R
60|$|And now for {{the story}} which is <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> we have traditions {{on this side of}} the ocean that are {{becoming}} older at a much rapider rate than those of England are--thanks to our git-up and enterprise.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{deserved}} to be exposed!" [...] cried Ruth. [...] "The idea of their shooting two of Mr. Lacy's valuable cows and then trying <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> did it! It was shameful!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I'll {{stick to}} it that I bought the turn-out," [...] {{returned}} the corn salve doctor, trying {{to put on a}} bold front. [...] "You'll have <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> didn't make the sale. I won't be bulldozed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{wife has}} chosen us her guardians, and I {{think you will}} {{scarcely}} venture to use force again with two such witnesses as these <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have forfeited your right to her obedience and justify the step she has taken." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mademoiselle," [...] he said, gravely, [...] "I {{am about}} <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> I feel {{honored by the}} {{confidence}} you place in me. I cannot break my word, but I will confess to <b>you</b> <b>that</b> Casimer does not bear his own name." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you saw a}} man {{fallen into}} the water, {{what do you think}} would be the {{shortest}} way <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> him <b>that</b> <b>you</b> had authority from heaven to pull him out? Do you give it up? Pulling him out would it not be, without more ado?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here, Redford," [...] {{continued}} the pirate captain. [...] "I want <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> {{the distance from}} this spot to the boat is about five hundred yards. <b>You</b> see <b>that</b> gull on the water? It {{is about the same}} distance off as the boat--well--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, mother; I'd rather not. Then you'd {{have come}} out with the whole thing, <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were right. It's better to let it go," [...] said Florida with a fierce laugh, half sob. [...] "But it's strange that you can't {{remember}} how such things torment me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know, Winchester; {{there are}} two sides to that question, too. Suppose the King of Naples should seize you, here, ashore, and call on you <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are not one of his subjects? How would you go to work to make it out--no parish {{register}} being at hand?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You shall hear. I {{admit that}} {{the mark of the}} name proves the nightgown to be yours. I {{admit that the}} mark of the paint proves the nightgown to have made the smear on Rachel's door. But what {{evidence}} is there <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are the person who wore it, on the night when the Diamond was lost?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>To</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> I had not {{forgotten}} you before your letter came, {{here is the}} fragment of an unfinished one which I send you, to begin with--an imperfect fossil letter, which no comparative anatomy will bring much sense out of--except the plain fact <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were {{not forgotten}}....|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> I am as {{amicably}} disposed as yourself, I {{will say}} no more on the subject. With your permission, I will now examine your papers; and to show <b>you</b> <b>that</b> I feel myself among friends, I will first send my own boat back to the Speedy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have you, Julian," [...] he said. [...] "That very belief {{which you}} have just {{expressed}} is our justification, {{because it is the}} common belief throughout the country. I can <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are mistaken--can <b>prove</b> it, with the help of that very packet which is responsible for your incarceration here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A young woman," [...] she answered, [...] "would {{shrink from}} saying--what I, {{as an old}} woman, mean to say now. I refuse to leave you to your fate. I ask you <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> respect me, admire me, and thank me with your whole heart. Take one day to think--and let me hear the result. You promise me this?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{that case}} {{he would have}} <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were guilty. Besides that, {{if it came to}} a matter of law, he would have to prove actual damages, and I do not see how he could claim fifty dollars if he was not hurt more than you say. If you wish, you can leave the whole matter in my hands and I will have it investigated." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I hope so,--with all my heart. You are on {{the same}} side with us, you know. I only want to make you {{understand}} how much ground there may be for doubt. It is not easy to upset a verdict. And, I fear, many righteous verdicts would be upset if the testimony of one man could do it. Perhaps you will be able <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> only arrived at Liverpool on Saturday night.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{great and}} good friend, I hear <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{are going to}} show us your navy, in order to impress us with a sense of your power. How needless the expense! <b>To</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> we already know all about it, I inclose {{herewith}} a list and description of all the ships you have." ...|$|R
6000|$|Ingleby laughed almost light-heartedly. [...] "I think I {{have enough}} to take us all out at the {{cheapest}} rates, and you must let me lend it to <b>you,</b> if only <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> what <b>you</b> believe in isn't an impracticable fancy." ...|$|R
60|$|You've got <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that,</b> Hubbard. If <b>you</b> {{have made}} any mistake {{it will go}} hard with you.|$|R
6000|$|... "You have learned, Mr. Powis, {{that small}} attentions {{are as much}} remembered as {{important}} services, and after having saved our lives, wish <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can discharge les petits devoirs socials, as well as perform great deeds. I trust you will persuade Sir George Templemore to be of our party, and at four we shall be ready to accompany you; until then I am contracted to a gossip with Mrs. Bloomfield in her dressing-room." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think, John, if {{you don't}} mind, I {{should like to}} tell my father. I am quite sure he would not object, and, in case you should happen to get caught, you could refer at once to him <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were not a spy. They make very short work of spies. But {{if you were to}} demand to be brought to Captain Davenant, and say you were acting in {{accordance}} with his knowledge, no doubt they would bring you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, my dear. I don't {{mean that}} myself, {{but that is}} {{certainly}} what anyone {{who did not know}} you would say. There, don't cry so, child,' for Dorothy was sobbing hysterically now; 'do not let us talk any more until we get home. We have got the day and hour at which you were supposed to have been at Gilliat's. Perhaps we may be able <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were engaged somewhere else, and that it was impossible you could have been at Gilliat's about that time.' ...|$|E
60|$|Having thus shewn you the {{weakness}} and uncertainty of those principles which some men {{set up in}} the place of conscience to direct them in their actions, I shall now endeavour <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> there is no solid, firm foundation of virtue, but in a conscience directed by the principles of religion.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Your highness,’ said I, ‘I have {{conceived}} {{a sincere}} admiration for your character; {{but on the}} subject of house property, I cannot allow the interference of my feelings. I will, however, <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> there is nothing personal in my request, here solemnly engage my word that I will never put another tenant in this house.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] he said desperately, [...] "I {{only wanted}} <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> I'll bring your pan back safe. Now look! If you don't {{like to take}} money, I'll leave this ring with you until I come back. There!" [...] He slipped a small {{specimen}} ring, made out of his first gold findings, from his little finger.|$|R
