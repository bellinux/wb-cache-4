40|$|Abstract. There are two {{elements}} in road <b>traffic</b> <b>accident</b> scene graph, base map {{and other elements}} in the site of <b>traffic</b> <b>accident.</b> The base map mainly includes traffic sings and traffic markings. Drawing <b>traffic</b> <b>accident</b> scene graph is a necessary link during disposing road <b>traffic</b> <b>accident,</b> while drawing the base map costs {{most of the time}} of drawing <b>traffic</b> <b>accident</b> scene. In order to save processing time of dealing with the <b>traffic</b> <b>accident,</b> the concept of road base map is proposed. The symbol design and data organization of the base map are analyzed. All this provides a new way to make the <b>traffic</b> <b>accident</b> scene graph...|$|R

40|$|Key words: {{road traffic}} accident; grey model(1, 1); {{forecast}}. Abstract. Road <b>traffic</b> <b>accident</b> forecast {{is a complex}} stochastic process. Based on the statistics of road <b>traffic</b> <b>accident,</b> Grey Model (1, 1) (short for GM(1, 1)) was applied to forecast the future number of road <b>traffic</b> <b>accident</b> in this paper. GM(1, 1) was established according to the time-series. GM(1, 1) is usually applied for such stochastic unconfirmed problem as road <b>traffic</b> <b>accident</b> forecast. Base on MATLAB software, the forecast value of road <b>traffic</b> <b>accident</b> was given. The precision of the test {{results show that the}} model is accurate and the forecast results are reliable...|$|R
5|$|Off {{the coast}} of Atlantic Canada, the storm {{produced}} very high waves, flooding a ship near Sable Island and stranding another ship. Along the coast, the waves wrecked three small boats near Tiverton, Nova Scotia, as well as nine boats in Torbay, Newfoundland and Labrador. In Nova Scotia, where the storm made landfall, precipitation reached 1.18 in (30mm), and 20,000 people in Pictou County were left without power. The storm also caused widespread power outages in Newfoundland from its high winds, which reached 68mph (110km/h) near St. Lawrence. There were at least 35 <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents,</b> one fatal, in Grand Falls-Windsor due to slick roads. Prior to the storm's formation, there was a record 4.4 in (116mm) of snowfall across Newfoundland. The storm caused no significant damage in Canada, other than these <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents.</b>|$|E

5|$|The term minimal {{encephalopathy}} (MHE) {{is defined}} as encephalopathy that {{does not lead to}} clinically overt cognitive dysfunction, but can be demonstrated with neuropsychological studies.

40|$|In {{this study}} {{business}} process simulation (BPS) {{is used to}} evaluate the effect of redesigning police road <b>traffic</b> <b>accident</b> (RTA) reporting system. It is claimed that by integrating information systems to road <b>traffic</b> <b>accident</b> (RTA) reporting system, duration of this process will be shorten and it will lead to more effective utilization of traffic police personnel. A case is studied in this project is road <b>traffic</b> <b>accident</b> (RTA) reporting system in sample of Iran’s road. In this case the simulation was run ten times in a simulated 30 days for the current road <b>traffic</b> <b>accident</b> system and in presence of new police road <b>traffic</b> <b>accident</b> (RTA) reporting systems...|$|R

5|$|A {{pulmonary}} contusion {{is usually}} caused directly by blunt trauma {{but can also}} result from explosion injuries or a shock wave associated with penetrating trauma. With the use of explosives during World Wars I and II, pulmonary contusion resulting from blasts gained recognition. In the 1960s its occurrence in civilians began to receive wider recognition, in which cases it is usually caused by <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents.</b> The use of seat belts and airbags reduces the risk to vehicle occupants.|$|E
5|$|As the {{precursor}} to Sandra traversed Central America, it produced unseasonably heavy rainfall that triggered flooding and landslides. Four {{people died in}} various incidents related to the system: three in El Salvador and one in Honduras. Initially expecting a landfalling storm, officials in Northwestern Mexico prepared equipment for power outages, closed schools, and evacuated 180residents. Sandra's effects largely consisted of light to moderate rainfall; some <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> and landslides resulted from this, though the overall impacts were limited.|$|E
5|$|In Mexico, Isis {{destroyed}} over 700houses {{and killed}} 14people; this is {{primarily due to}} its heavy rainfall which peaked at over 20inches (500mm) in southern Baja California Sur. The rainfall caused widespread damage to roads and railways, stranding thousands of people. Moisture from the remnants of Isis extended into the southwestern United States, resulting in light rainfall, dozens of <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents,</b> and power outages to thousands of residents in San Diego County, California.|$|E

5|$|Cordon area {{congestion}} pricing is a fee or tax paid by users {{to enter a}} restricted area, usually within a city center, {{as part of a}} demand management strategy to relieve traffic congestion within that area. The economic rationale for this pricing scheme is based on the externalities or social costs of road transport, such as air pollution, noise, <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents,</b> environmental and urban deterioration, and the extra costs and delays imposed by traffic congestion upon other drivers when additional users enter a congested road.|$|E

Across Luzon, Linfa damaged 198houses and destroyed another seven, causing ₱214.6 million ($4.8 million USD) in damage. The storm briefly threatened Taiwan, prompting warnings and restricted ferry travel. Over China, Linfa produced heavy rainfall and gusty winds that wrecked 288homes. Damage in the country totaled ¥1.7billion ($284million USD), and there was one death.|$|E
5|$|The open {{nature of}} the New Forest means that ponies are able to wander onto roads. The ponies {{actually}} have right of way over vehicles and many wear reflective collars {{in an effort to}} reduce traffic fatalities, but despite this, many ponies, along with commoners' cattle, pigs, and donkeys are killed or injured in road <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> every year. Human interaction with ponies is also a problem; well meaning but misguided visitors to the forest frequently feed them, which can create dietary problems and sickness (eg colic) and cause the ponies to adopt an aggressive attitude in order to obtain human food.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{affected}} a large {{region of}} the northeastern United States from West Virginia to Massachusetts with heavy snowfall, sleet, rain, and high winds. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention attributed four deaths to the nor'easter, but only included those directly related; the agency did not include storm-induced <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> or heart attacks. The National Climatic Data Center reported 19deaths related to the nor'easter, although news reports shortly after the storm reported 20deaths. Overall damage was estimated between $12billion (1992USD), mostly in New England.|$|E

5|$|Barry dropped {{moderate}} to heavy rainfall across Florida, peaking at 6.99inches (178mm) at Palm Beach International Airport; several other locations reported over 3inches (75mm). The rainfall alleviated persistent drought conditions and assisted in combating severe wildfires across the state. In Brevard County, the rainfall closed {{a portion of}} Eau Gallie Boulevard after a large sinkhole developed. Several other roads across the area were flooded, and on Interstate 95 near Lake Worth, a sinkhole closed two lanes of traffic. Wet roads caused several <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents</b> across the state; in both Brevard and Volusia counties, a motorist was killed from an accident. On Interstate 4, a tractor trailer led to disruptions near Orlando after it crashed into a guardrail.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Carol {{produced}} hurricane and gale force winds across New England. Strong winds from Hurricane Carol destroyed nearly 40% of the apple, corn, peach, {{and tomato}} crops from eastern Connecticut to Cape Cod. Overall crop damage {{was estimated at}} $22.25million. The hurricane destroyed several thousand homes in New England, {{many of which were}} destroyed from the waters or the powerful winds. Overall, 11,785families were directly impacted by the hurricane, including 9,720houses that were damaged and 1,545that were destroyed. High winds left over 150,000people without power in New England, potentially as many as one-third of all of New England, and many residents also lost phone service. The hurricane also destroyed 3,500cars and 3,000boats in the region. Heavy rainfall from the storm caused <b>traffic</b> <b>accidents,</b> but only minor flooding.|$|E
