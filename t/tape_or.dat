25|$|Other {{alternatives}} include regular nail trimming; directing scratching {{behavior to}} inexpensive cardboard scratchers or scratching posts, or emery scratching pads that dull the claws; rotary sanding devices (Dremel, Pedi-Paws); covering furniture or using double-sided sticky <b>tape</b> <b>or</b> sheets such as Sticky Paws; remote aversive {{devices such as}} Scat Mats; or acceptance of cats' scratching behavior.|$|E
25|$|For {{the entire}} run, musical numbers were divided fairly evenly between {{prerecorded}} lip- and finger-sync performances and those recorded live on film or tape. Generally, the big production numbers featuring dancing and singing performances were recorded {{earlier in the}} day or the day before, often at famous recording studios in and around nearby Hollywood, while the more intimate numbers were recorded live on <b>tape</b> <b>or</b> film.|$|E

25|$|As {{hard drive}} prices have fallen, storage farms {{have tended to}} {{increase}} in capacity to make more data available online. This includes archival and backup data that would formerly have been saved on <b>tape</b> <b>or</b> other offline storage. The increase in online storage has increased power consumption. Reducing the power consumed by large storage arrays, while still providing the benefits of online storage, is a subject of ongoing research.|$|E
25|$|Computers {{manufactured}} {{until the}} 1970s had front-panel switches for programming. The computer program {{was written on}} paper for reference. An instruction was represented by a configuration of on/off settings. After setting the configuration, an execute button was pressed. This process was then repeated. Computer programs also were manually input via paper <b>tape</b> <b>or</b> punched cards. After the medium was loaded, the starting address was set via switches and the execute button pressed.|$|E
25|$|A {{lavalier}} microphone {{is made for}} hands-free operation. These small microphones are worn on the body. Originally, they were held in place with a lanyard worn around the neck, but more often they are fastened to clothing with a clip, pin, <b>tape</b> <b>or</b> magnet. The lavalier cord may be hidden by clothes and either run to an RF transmitter in a pocket or clipped to a belt (for mobile use), or run directly to the mixer (for stationary applications).|$|E
50|$|The {{technology}} of DAT is closely {{based on that}} of video recorders, using a rotating head and helical scan to record data. This prevents DATs from being physically edited in the cut-and-splice manner of analog <b>tapes,</b> <b>or</b> open-reel digital <b>tapes</b> like ProDigi <b>or</b> DASH.|$|R
50|$|Many {{performances}} {{have been}} bootlegged {{from the original}} <b>tapes</b> <b>or</b> from public television/radio broadcasts. All references to availability on DVD here refers to legally produced and sold articles.|$|R
50|$|Of the 14 episodes, two are {{currently}} {{missing from the}} BBC archives; they were either wiped to reuse the <b>tapes</b> <b>or</b> possibly lost at one stage after their first broadcast.|$|R
25|$|Filament <b>tape</b> <b>or</b> {{strapping}} tape is a {{pressure-sensitive tape}} used for several packaging {{functions such as}} closing corrugated fiberboard boxes, reinforcing packages, bundling items, pallet utilizing, etc. It consists of a pressure-sensitive adhesive coated onto a backing material which is usually a polypropylene or polyester film and fiberglass filaments embedded to add high tensile strength. Filament tape was invented in 1946 by Cyrus Woodrow Bemmels. In 1949, it {{was placed on the}} market and was an immediate success.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{reason for}} the use of one-pass assemblers was speed of assembly – often a second pass would require rewinding and rereading the program source on <b>tape</b> <b>or</b> rereading a deck of cards or punched paper tape. Later computers with much larger memories (especially disc storage), had the space to perform all necessary processing without such re-reading. The advantage of the multi-pass assembler is that the absence of errata makes the linking process (or the program load if the assembler directly produces executable code) faster.|$|E
25|$|Ultimately bundled {{with the}} Nintendo 64 Mouse, {{it is one}} of the two 64DD launch titles on December 11, 1999. Utilizing the Nintendo 64 Capture Cassette cartridge, the user can import images and movies from any NTSC video source such as video <b>tape</b> <b>or</b> a video camera. The Japanese version of the Game Boy Camera can be {{utilized}} via the Transfer Pak. The studio features a unique four player drawing mode. Minigames include a fly swatting game reminiscent of that in Mario Paint, and a game reminiscent of Pokémon Snap.|$|E
5000|$|Sometimes it isn't {{possible}} to locate {{all the data}} in the old format, for example, because some of it only exists on backup <b>tapes</b> <b>or</b> saved on users' memory cards.|$|R
50|$|Operation Alphabet {{was also}} {{syndicated}} by WFIL-TV to commercial and educational television stations nationwide—stations received <b>tapes</b> <b>or</b> {{films of the}} program free of charge, provided that they were returned after broadcast.|$|R
50|$|The {{directory}} system was called AND - Alpha Numeric Directory. Teleprocessing users could store programs on disks, <b>tapes,</b> <b>or</b> the RCA RACE mass storage unit interfaced through an RCA 301 computer. Users could retrieve and edit programs through AND. The 1-inch magnetic tapes were block addressable, allowing AND {{to manage a}} directory file system interchangeably on any available magnetic storage (<b>tape,</b> disk, <b>or</b> RACE cards).|$|R
25|$|The Tauchpanzer or deep-wading tank (also {{referred}} to as the U-Panzer or Unterwasser Panzer) was a standard Panzer III or Panzer IV medium tank with its hull made completely waterproof by sealing all sighting ports, hatches and air intakes with <b>tape</b> <b>or</b> caulk. The gap between the turret and hull was sealed with an inflatable hose while the main gun mantlet, commander’s cupola and radio operator’s machine gun were given special rubber coverings. Once the tank reached the shore, all covers and seals could be blown off via explosive cables, enabling normal combat operation.|$|E
25|$|The word {{processor}} was a stand-alone office {{machine in the}} 1960s, combining the keyboard text-entry and printing functions of an electric typewriter with a recording unit, either <b>tape</b> <b>or</b> floppy disk (as used by the Wang machine) with a simple dedicated computer processor for the editing of text. Although features and designs varied among manufacturers and models, and new features were added as technology advanced, {{word processor}}s typically featured a monochrome display {{and the ability to}} save documents on memory cards or diskettes. Later models introduced innovations such as spell-checking programs, and improved formatting options.|$|E
25|$|This IPL {{concept is}} device independent. It {{is capable of}} IPL-ing from a card deck, from a {{magnetic}} <b>tape,</b> <b>or</b> from a hard disk. For this purpose, the normal X'02' command, which is simulated by the CPU, is taken to be a standard sequential read command on card and tape media (which are inherently sequential access in nature), but a special Read-IPL command on hard disks (which are inherently random access in nature; hard disks use a related, but different, read-type command, X'06', and others, for sequential, non-IPL reads).|$|E

25|$|As power {{dissipation}} of components increases and component package size decreases, thermal engineers must innovate to ensure components won't overheat. Devices that run cooler last longer. A heat sink design must fulfill both its thermal {{as well as}} its mechanical requirements. Concerning the latter, the component must remain in thermal contact with its heat sink with reasonable shock and vibration. The heat sink could be the copper foil of a circuit board, or a separate heat sink mounted onto the component or circuit board. Attachment methods include thermally conductive <b>tape</b> <b>or</b> epoxy, wire-form z clips, flat spring clips, standoff spacers, and push pins with ends that expand after installing.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the late}} 2000s, the {{emergence}} of video technology in DSLR photography cameras, such as the Canon EOS 550D, {{has resulted in a}} tremendous surge of both feature and short films shot with most, if not all, of the rules pertaining to the Dogme 95 manifesto. However, because of advancements in technology and quality, the aesthetic of these productions typically appears drastically {{different from that of the}} Dogme films shot on <b>Tape</b> <b>or</b> DVD-R Camcorders. Largely erasing the primitive and problematic features of past technologies, newer technologies have helped Dogme 95 filmmakers achieve an aesthetic of higher resolution, as well as of lower contrast, film grain, and saturation.|$|E
25|$|Employees {{were given}} 14 minutes between each shift to punch the time clock, walk to their {{respective}} workbench and prepare for work. It took a minimum of eight minutes for all the employees to get by the time clock. The estimated walking time for employees ranged from 30 seconds to three minutes, but some workers needed {{as many as eight}} minutes to reach their workbenches. Upon arriving at their workbench, employees were required to put on aprons or overalls, removed shirts, <b>tape</b> <b>or</b> grease arms, put on finger cots, prepare equipment, turn on switches, open windows, and/or assemble or sharpen tools. Such preparatory activities consumed three to four minutes.|$|E
50|$|On October 6, 1991, {{another former}} player, Vincent Harris, alleged in the Birmingham News {{that he had}} {{received}} payments from assistant coaches. However, Harris made no claims to possessing audio <b>tapes</b> <b>or</b> any other evidence.|$|R
30|$|Autonomous {{navigation}} methods using artificial landmarks (e.g. magnetic <b>tapes</b> <b>or</b> makers) {{have been}} proposed [1]. In some factories, automated guided vehicles traveling on magnetic tapes are practically used. However, using such a system requires environmental arrangement.|$|R
50|$|The {{machines}} were built around an HP-proprietary CPU code-named “Capricorn” running at 625 kHz (0.6 MHz, sic) {{and had a}} BASIC interpreter in ROM (32 kB). Programs could be stored on DC-100 cartridge <b>tapes</b> <b>or</b> on external disk/tape units.|$|R
