5|$|Polygon is an American {{video game}} website that publishes news, culture, reviews, and videos. At its October 2012 launch as Vox Media's third property, Polygon sought to {{distinguish}} itself from competitors {{by focusing on}} the stories of the people behind the games instead of the games themselves. They also produced long-form magazine-style feature articles, invested in video content, and chose <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>their</b> review scores be updated as the game changed.|$|E
5|$|After Mary's death, Paul and Michael {{were sent}} to live with Jim's brother Joe, and his wife Joan, for two months, so as <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>their</b> father grieve in private. Jim {{depended}} heavily on his sisters, Jin and Millie, to help around the house. Jim later {{took part in the}} running of the household, as Cynthia Lennon remembered that when she and John Lennon used to visit Forthlin Road, Jim would often answer the door with his sleeves rolled up, a tea towel in his hand and an apron tied around his waist. When Paul later played at The Cavern during lunchtimes, Jim would drop off food there that Paul would later put in the oven at Forthlin Road. Ruth remembered that Jim was funny and musical with her, but also strict when she was young, and was insistent that she learned good table manners and etiquette when speaking to people.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} imagined Darcy to be dark despite no such {{references in}} the novel and asked Firth to dye black his light-brown hair, eyebrows and lashes; they instructed all male actors <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>their</b> hair grow before filming and shave off their moustaches. Three brunette wigs were made to cover Ehle's short, blonde hair and one wig for Alison Steadman (Mrs. Bennet) because of her thick, heavy hair. Susannah Harker's (Jane) hair was slightly lightened to contrast with Elizabeth's and was arranged in a classic Greek style to highlight the character's beauty. Mary's plainness was achieved by painting spots on Lucy Briers's face; her hair was greased to suggest an unwashed appearance and was arranged to emphasise the actress's protruding ears. As Kitty and Lydia were too young and wild to have their hair done by the maids, the actresses' hair was not changed much. Makeup artist Caroline Noble had always considered Mr. Collins a sweaty character with a moist upper lip; she also greased David Bamber's hair {{and gave him a}} low parting to suggest baldness.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{development}} processes of Ultimate Play the Game, which was known for its avoidance of media spotlight. Its founders, brothers Tim and Chris Stamper, were infamously taciturn both to preserve their time and <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>their</b> games speak for themselves. Though as the Sabreman series became popular, their silence contributed to the series' mystique. The main criticism of Underwurlde predecessor and the first game in the Sabreman series, Sabre Wulf, was its similarity to an earlier game by the Stamper brothers, as both were depicted in a top-down view as action-adventure games. While Retro Gamer wrote that the sequel, Underwurlde, resolved this criticism by instead using a side view as a platform game, Ultimate Play the Game also had a reputation for releasing games outside the order in which they were developed. Indeed, the Stamper brothers claimed to have finished their third Sabreman title, the epochal Knight Lore, in advance of both of its predecessors. The Stampers primarily developed for the ZX Spectrum home computer and outsourced the work of converting their games to work on other types of computers to external developers more familiar with the hardware architecture of other platforms. For instance, Firebird created the Commodore 64 releases of Sabre Wulf and Underwurlde. The game released alongside Knight Lore for the ZX Spectrum near the 1984 holiday season, and the Commodore 64 version released a year later.|$|E
25|$|That same year, Benny {{was playing}} in the same theater as the young Marx Brothers. Minnie, their mother, enjoyed Benny's violin playing and invited him to {{accompany}} her boys in their act. Benny's parents refused <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>their</b> son {{go on the road}} at 17, but {{it was the beginning of}} his long friendship with the Marx Brothers, especially Zeppo Marx.|$|E
25|$|ESPN then {{contacted}} Oklahoma State, without success. Texas Athletics eventually {{announced that}} the Kansas Jayhawks had agreed <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>their</b> game against the Longhorns on October 29 be shown on the network (KU's third tier media rights are also managed by LHN co-owner IMG College). The agreement allowed the Longhorn Network to be the national carrier of the game except in Kansas markets, where the game was shown on local network affiliates.|$|E

5000|$|Judges are {{not immune}} <b>to</b> <b>letting</b> <b>their</b> own prejudices affect their {{judgment}} either. In 1988, Texas Judge Jack Hampton gave a man 30 years for killing two gay men, instead of the life sentence requested by the prosecutor. After handing down his judgment, he said: [...] "I don't much care for queers cruising the streets picking up teenage boys ...I put prostitutes and gays {{at about the same}} level ... and I'd be hard put to give somebody life for killing a prostitute." ...|$|R
25|$|Assemblies, secret societies, {{and other}} groups play an {{important}} role in keeping the Duala unified, helping them set goals, and giving them a venue to find solutions to common problems. Chief among these is the Ngondo, an assembly of important chiefs. Another of these is the muemba (plural: miemba), a grouping of all Duala of a certain age range or tribal clan. The miemba serve <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>their</b> members network and socialise. Other secret societies include the Ekongolo, Jengu, Losango, and Munji.|$|E
25|$|Trademark erosion, or genericization, is {{a special}} case of antonomasia related to {{trademark}}s. It happens when a trademark becomes so common that it starts {{being used as a}} common name and the original company has failed to prevent such use. Once it has become an appellative, the word cannot be registered any more; this is why companies try hard not <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>their</b> trademark become too common, a phenomenon that could otherwise be considered a successful move since it would mean that the company gained an exceptional recognition.|$|E
25|$|Chinese porters {{pushed the}} train through the river as American troops swam to the {{opposite}} shore, where Filipino trenches were located. Other troops were promptly repairing the bridge <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>their</b> supply wagons cross over the river. By the time Luna had returned from Guagua, only Filipinos in the barrio of Sta. Lucia were holding out against the Americans in the Bagbag sector. Luna tried to fight and repulse the Americans, but he was eventually forced to retreat, destroying bridges as his troops fell back to slow the American advance.|$|E

25|$|A {{few days}} later, the activist announces that the kulaks will be exterminated as a class, {{and then their}} bodies will be sent down the river on a {{makeshift}} raft. Many peasants were expecting this to happen and stopped taking care of themselves long ago. One woman, for instance, is alive only to the pain she feels when stray dogs chew on her feet. Others rip their plants {{out of the ground}} by the roots, refusing <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>their</b> property be taken into collectivization. The rest of the peasants spend the night involuntarily vomiting.|$|E
25|$|Television {{shows have}} and {{continue}} to aid the success and public opinion of the Body Farm. Before programs like , {{there was a great}} deal of protest and controversy that surrounded the Body Farm mainly because people thought it was grotesque, barbaric and an insult to the deceased, <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>their</b> bodies decompose for unnecessary scientific reasons. CSI, accompanied by scientific advances, has helped the public come to terms with this research. As a result, an increased number of citizens are willing to donate their bodies after passing to aid this research.|$|E
25|$|The Conservatives ran former {{party leader}} Richard Bennett who had {{previously}} contested the district in 1905 and Thomas Blow {{who was also a}} medical doctor rounded out the slate. Bennett was unanimously acclaimed at the party nominating convention held on March 1, 1909 despite not attending. The second spot on the slate was contested between Blow and J.A. Carson. The two candidates were left over from ten nominees who either had their nomination withdrawn for various reasons or the candidates themselves or refused <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>their</b> name stand.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{decision}} to retire Digger Crown was official, {{it was reported that}} he would move to a stud farm in Italy. The owner also decided <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>their</b> own broodmares get covered by Digger Crown. Among those mares are Nealy Lobell, five times participant of Elitloppet. The stud farm that Digger Crown was installed in was Allevamento Folli near Bologna. When Swedish king Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia visited Italy in late March 2009, they received framed photographs from Vasco Errani, president of the region Emilia-Romagna, where Bologna is situated. One of the photos showed Digger Crown driven by Stig H. Johansson.|$|E
25|$|In 1833, the English {{economist}} William Forster Lloyd {{published a}} pamphlet {{which included a}} hypothetical example of over-use of a common resource. This was the situation of cattle herders sharing a common parcel of land on which they are each entitled <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>their</b> cows graze, as was the custom in English villages. He postulated that if a herder put more than his allotted number of cattle on the common, overgrazing could result. For each additional animal, a herder could receive additional benefits, but the whole group shared damage to the commons. If all herders made this individually rational economic decision, the common could be depleted or even destroyed, {{to the detriment of}} all.|$|E
25|$|Ren goes {{before the}} city council and reads several Bible verses {{given to him by}} Ariel, that {{describe}} how in ancient times people would dance to rejoice, exercise, celebrate, and/or worship. Ren also teaches Willard how to dance. The city council votes against him. Undaunted, Ren convinces the cotton mill owner to let them have a prom there; the mill is just outside city limits. Ren goes to see Moore, knowing that Moore still has enough influence to pressure the parents not <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>their</b> teenagers come. Ren tells Moore that even though they denied the motion to dismiss the law, they cannot stop the dance. He then asks him respectfully if he can take Ariel.|$|E

25|$|Bodega {{was pleased}} to receive Ingraham and Gray's account. Once Vancouver arrived, Bodega used the report, along with other tactics, to force Vancouver into a {{diplomatic}} deadlock once negotiations had begun. Were it not for Ingraham and Gray's letter, along with Vancouver's late arrival, and several other factors, Bodega likely would have turned the entire Spanish establishment at Nootka over to the British. Instead, Bodega offered only {{to turn over the}} small cove where Meares had built his hut in 1789. Vancouver could not accept this. In the end, the two agreed <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>their</b> governments work it out. As a result, the settlement at Nootka remained Spanish for several years, until under the third Nootka Convention both nations agreed to abandon the port.|$|E
25|$|Once the Federal fleet {{had passed}} out of range, Louisiana had no further part in the action. Her fate was {{henceforth}} tied {{to that of the}} forts, which prepared for an expected attack by the Union army accompanying the fleet, led by Major General Benjamin Butler. However, on the night of 28 April, the enlisted men in Fort Jackson mutinied and forced the surrender of both forts to Commander Porter. The naval officers on Louisiana were not consulted {{at any time during the}} negotiations between Porter and General Duncan, so they considered themselves not bound to respect the truce declared by the two sides. While discussions of terms were going on, they decided not <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>their</b> ship fall into enemy hands. Louisiana was set afire, and her crew went ashore. The flames soon parted the lines that held her to the bank, and she drifted down the river. When she was nearly abreast of Fort St. Philip, the fire reached her magazine, and she blew up with a blast that killed a soldier there.|$|E
25|$|Netball {{rules do}} not permit players <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>their</b> landing foot touch the ground again if it is lifted at all while in {{possession}} of the ball, so players can take 1.5 steps while holding the ball. Pivoting does not count as a step. Players are entitled to balance {{on the other foot}} if the landing foot is lifted. An infraction of this rule is usually called stepping or travelling , as in the similar rule in basketball. Consequently, the only way to move the ball towards the goal is to throw the ball to a teammate. The ball can be held by a player for less than three seconds at any time. A player may tap or deflect the ball, let it bounce and then take possession and throw it. The player cannot catch the ball with both hands, drop it and pick it up again; this is called a replayed ball. The duration before it is called a drop is determined by the umpire. These rules, combined with the restrictions on where one player of a particular position can move, ensure that everyone on the team is regularly involved in play.|$|E
