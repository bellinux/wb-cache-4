5|$|Operation Dragoon (initially Operation Anvil) was {{the code}} {{name for the}} Allied {{invasion}} of Southern France on 15August 1944. The operation was initially planned <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>executed</b> in conjunction with Operation Overlord, the Allied landing in the Normandy, {{but the lack of}} available resources led to a cancellation of the second landing. By July 1944 the landing was reconsidered, as the clogged-up ports in Normandy did not have the capacity to adequately supply the Allied forces. Concurrently, the French High Command pushed for a revival of the operation that would include large numbers of French troops. As a result, the operation was finally approved in July <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>executed</b> in August.|$|E
5|$|A {{young girl}} was found raped and murdered, and Max Stuart, an Aborigine, {{was convicted and}} sentenced <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>executed.</b> Stuart's lawyer claimed that the {{confession}} was forced, and appeals to the Supreme and High Courts were dismissed. Amid objections against {{the fairness of the}} trial among an increasing number of legal academics and judges, The News brought much attention to Stuart's plight with an aggressive, tabloid-style campaign.|$|E

5|$|During closing arguments, {{defense counsel}} John Pope {{attempted}} to discredit Darby; the latter reacted by assaulting one of Pope's co-counselors with a cane.

Beauchamp was sentenced <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>executed</b> by hanging on June 16, 1826.|$|E

However, this also failed. Labor then tried to introduce legislation to stall the hanging.|$|E

The program terminates when the instruction pointer moves past the last command.|$|R

5|$|A {{petition}} {{was presented}} to UK Home Secretary Jack Straw in 1998 asking for the witches to be pardoned, but {{it was decided that}} their convictions should stand. Ten years later another petition was organised in an attempt to obtain pardons for Chattox and Demdike.

5|$|Aquino was {{succeeded by}} Fidel V. Ramos, {{who won the}} Philippine presidential {{election}} held in May 1992. During this period the country's economic performance remained modest, with a 5–7 percent GDP growth rate. However, the political stability and economic improvements, such as the peace agreement with the Moro National Liberation Front in 1996, were overshadowed by {{the onset of the}} 1997 Asian financial crisis. On his Presidency the death penalty was revived {{in the light of the}} Rape-slay case of Eileen Sarmienta and Allan Gomez in 1993 and the first person <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>executed</b> was Leo Echegaray in 1999.|$|E

5|$|Each 32-bit word of RAM could contain {{either a}} program {{instruction}} or data.

The SSEM's single operand architecture meant that the second operand of any operation was implicit: the accumulator or the program counter (instruction address); program instructions specified only {{the address of the}} data in memory.|$|E

The plan was endorsed by the delegation <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>executed</b> at the next national convention in 1943. However, due to World War II, the 1943 and 1945 national conventions were not held, and so the first National Intercollegiate Band was formed and gave a concert {{on the evening of}} Friday, March 7, 1947. Today, participation in the National Intercollegiate Band is open to any college band member who auditions—membership in Kappa Kappa Psi or Tau Beta Sigma is not required.|$|E

The edict was in use in Thessalonica (Thessaloniki, Greece) in April 304, and in Palestine soon after. This last edict was not enforced {{at all in the}} domains of Maximian and Constantius. In the East, it remained applicable until the issue of the Edict of Milan by Constantine and Licinius in 313.|$|E
