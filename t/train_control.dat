After review, the FRA waiver was granted in May 2010, marking the first time lighter-weight EMUs were allowed to share rails with freight in the United States. The grant was {{conditioned}} on meeting nine additional requirements, including demonstrating minimum crashworthiness, seating, improving grade crossing, meeting FRA positive <b>train</b> <b>control</b> standards in Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations, part 236 with CBOSS, formalizing the temporal separation plan, and issuing a safety system program.|$|E

5|$|During normal {{passenger}} {{operation on}} revenue tracks, trains {{are designed to}} be controlled by an integrated Automatic Train Operation (ATO) and Automatic <b>Train</b> <b>Control</b> (ATC) system that accelerates and brakes trains automatically without operator intervention. All trains are still manned with train operators who open and close the doors, make station announcements, and supervise their trains. The system was designed so that an operator could manually operate a train when necessary.|$|E
5|$|Since 1999, the R142, R142A, R143, R160, and R188 {{cars have}} been placed into service. These cars are collectively known as New Technology Trains (NTTs) due to modern {{innovations}} such as LED and LCD route signs and information screens, as well as recorded train announcements {{and the ability to}} facilitate Communication-Based <b>Train</b> <b>Control</b> (CBTC). Live conductor announcements can still be made on older rolling stock equipment.|$|E

5|$|The entire metro {{system and}} the trains are run by a fully {{automated}} computer system, located at the Control and Maintenance Center south of Vestamager Station. The automatic <b>train</b> <b>control</b> (ATC) consists of three subsystems: automatic train protection (ATP), automatic train operation (ATO) and automatic train supervisory (ATS). The ATP is responsible for keeping the trains' speed, ensuring that doors are closed before departure and switches are correctly set. The system uses fixed block signaling, except around stations, where moving block signaling is used.|$|E
5|$|The {{expected}} daily ridership of {{the whole}} network of all phases, ater the compleiton of Phase-II, is 4 million passengers. The communication based <b>train</b> <b>control</b> (CBTC) is being used which enables trains to run at a short headway of 90 seconds. Keeping this in mind and other constraints, DMRC changed its decision to build 9-car-long stations for new lines and instead opting for shorter stations which can accommodate 6-car trains.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, {{the company}} ordered seven new trams from Skabo, with {{electric}} equipment from Norsk Elektrisk & Brown Boveri (NEBB). These {{were the first}} in the country to have Norwegian-built electrical equipment, and also allowed for multiple-unit <b>train</b> <b>control.</b> They were delivered in 1920 and 1921. In addition, six trailers were built from Hannoversche Waggonfabrik (HaWA) The delivery of new rolling stock required a new depot building at Holtet, two new electric arc transformers and a ticket price increase. The HaWa trailers were delivered in 1925. However, the two-axled trailers did not give as smooth a ride, and in 1927 the company ordered bogie trailers from Atelier Métallurgique de Nivelles, which were put into service in 1928 and 1929.|$|E

5|$|In September 2015, the {{president}} of SBASE highlighted plans for 2015–2019 on the Underground at a conference with other South American mass transit operators in Brazil. One of the largest changes to be made during this period is the upgrading of signalling systems on all lines, {{with the exception of}} Line E. Lines A and B are to receive Automatic Train Operation systems, replacing their ATS and ATP systems respectively, whilst lines C, D and H are to receive Communications Based <b>Train</b> <b>Control</b> systems. The implementation of these systems was already under way on Lines C and H as of September 2015, and is due to be completed on other lines before 2019. Line D is also te receive platform screen doors along with the CBTC system.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s and early 2000s, the MTA began {{automating}} the subway by Communication-Based <b>Train</b> <b>Control</b> (CBTC). CBTC supplements, rather than replaces, the fixed-block signal system; it allows trains to operate closer together. The BMT Canarsie Line, {{on which the}} L train runs, was chosen for pilot testing {{because it is a}} self-contained line that does not operate in conjunction with other lines. CBTC became operational in February 2009. Due to an unexpected ridership increase, the MTA ordered additional cars, and increased service from 15 trains to 26 trains per hour, an achievement beyond the capability of the block system. The total cost of the project was $340 million.|$|E
5|$|Installation of {{centralized}} {{traffic control}} is scheduled to take place as part of nationwide implementation of European <b>Train</b> <b>Control</b> System, {{which is scheduled to}} be completed within 2023. Capacity and efficiency on the line require more passing capacity, especially for longer freight trains. Thus the passing loop at Gudå Station has been proposed lengthened. To allow trains to run from the Meråker Line directly northward on the Nordland Line, a triangular line has been proposed at Hell Station. All regular freight trains on the line come from the north.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{release of}} alanine and {{glutamine}} from perfused muscle of <b>trained</b> and <b>control</b> animals was investigated. Release rates {{did not differ}} between <b>trained</b> and <b>control</b> muscle at rest. During contractions in trained muscle, alanine release was higher than at rest, while glutamine release was transiently increased. Phenylalanine release did not differ between <b>trained</b> and <b>control</b> muscle, implying that protein degradation was not increased in trained muscle. The muscle cellular adaptations to training include a selective modification of amino acid output, which could potentially influence gluconeogenic flux and alter muscle ammonia levels during contractions...|$|R
5|$|Prior to 2007, the Staten Island Railway used Baltimore & Ohio Railroad style color {{position}} light signals that dated {{back to when}} it was a B line. In 2007, a $72 million project to replace the old signal system was completed. The system was replaced with an FRA-compliant 100Hz, track circuit based, Automatic <b>Train</b> <b>Control</b> (ATC) signal system. As part of the project, forty R44 subway cars and four locomotives were modified with on board cab signaling equipment for ATC bi-directional movement. A new rail control center and back-up control center was constructed as part of this contract.|$|E
5|$|The Caltrain Modernization Program (CalMod) is a $1.9billion {{project that}} will add a {{positive}} <b>train</b> <b>control</b> (PTC) system and electrify {{the main line}} of the U.S. commuter railroad Caltrain, which serves cities in the San Francisco Peninsula and Silicon Valley, as well as transition from its current diesel-electric locomotive powered trains to electric multiple units (EMU). According to Caltrain, electrification of the tracks will allow it to improve service times via faster acceleration and shorter headways, reduce air pollution and noise, and facilitate a future railway tunnel (the Downtown Rail Extension) into downtown San Francisco's Transbay Transit Center (as diesel trains cannot serve underground stations).|$|E

5|$|The NTSB {{investigation}} found {{that after a}} June 17 replacement of a track circuit component at what became {{the site of the}} June 22 collision, the track circuit had been suffering from parasitic oscillations which left it unable to reliably report when that stretch of track was occupied by a train. The struck train came to a stop because of traffic ahead. Because the entire train was within the faulty circuit, it became invisible to the Automatic <b>Train</b> <b>Control</b> (ATC) system. The train behind it was therefore commanded to proceed at 55mph. The operator of the striking train applied the emergency brake after the stopped train came into full view but there was not enough time to prevent the collision, which occurred at approximately 44mph.|$|E
5|$|Together {{with the}} {{introduction}} of S Stock trains, the track, electrical supply and signalling systems are being upgraded in a programme planned to increase peak-hour capacity on the Circle and Hammersmith & City lines by 65 per cent by the end of 2018. A single control room for the sub-surface railway is to be established in Hammersmith and an automatic <b>train</b> <b>control</b> (ATC) system will replace signalling equipment installed from the 1940s. The cross-London Crossrail line, planned to open in 2018, is expected to reduce crowding between Paddington and Whitechapel.|$|E
