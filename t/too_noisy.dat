5|$|Linnaeus felt Uppsala was <b>too</b> <b>noisy</b> and unhealthy, so {{he bought}} two farms in 1758: Hammarby and Sävja. The next year, {{he bought a}} {{neighbouring}} farm, Edeby. He spent the summers with his family at Hammarby; initially it only had a small one-storey house, but in 1762 a new, larger main building was added. In Hammarby, Linnaeus made a garden where he could grow plants {{that could not be}} grown in the Botanical Garden in Uppsala. He began constructing a museum on a hill behind Hammarby in 1766, where he moved his library and collection of plants. A fire that destroyed about one third of Uppsala and had threatened his residence there necessitated the move.|$|E

25|$|The {{shipbuilding}} firm of Smith's Dock Co., Middlesbrough {{were commissioned}} to construct two steel 92ft. diesel-powered whale catchers {{as well as}} fit a diesel auxiliary in the Sound of Jura. However, the diesel engine proved to be unreliable and felt to be <b>too</b> <b>noisy</b> in scaring off the whales, so {{was replaced by a}} steam engine.|$|E
50|$|The {{third floor}} {{contained}} a 400-seat hall, {{and the first}} two floors, 12 classrooms. From the beginning, the school was thought unsuitable being <b>too</b> dark, <b>noisy</b> (from the constant stream of electrically powered street cars) and too far from West Newton Street. The remaining fifth and sixth classes walked the two mile (3 km) round trip twice each month to attend school assemblies.|$|R
60|$|But the bus-mate now feels at {{home with}} us. He clambers back into the coupé, {{and when it is}} <b>too</b> painfully <b>noisy</b> to talk, he simply sits and looks at us with brown, {{pleading}} eyes. Miles and miles and miles goes this coast road, and never a village. Once or twice a sort of lonely watch-house and soldiers lying about by the road. But never a halt. Everywhere moorland and desert, uninhabited.|$|R
5000|$|The {{standard}} I-4 [...] "Iron Duke" [...] engine {{also was}} criticized as being <b>too</b> underpowered and <b>noisy,</b> even for an entry-level personal luxury car. All V6 models required the optional 3-speed automatic; the standard 5-speed manual was for 4-cylinder models only.|$|R
25|$|CADET used 324 {{point-contact}} transistors {{provided by}} the UK company Standard Telephones and Cables; 76 junction transistors {{were used for the}} first stage amplifiers for data read from the drum, since point-contact transistors were <b>too</b> <b>noisy.</b> From August 1956 CADET was offering a regular computing service, during which it often executed continuous computing runs of 80 hours or more. Problems with the reliability of early batches of point contact and alloyed junction transistors meant that the machine's mean time between failures was about 90minutes, but this improved once the more reliable bipolar junction transistors became available.|$|E
25|$|In the 1940s and 1950s, the Hellmuth Walter KG-conceived turbine used {{hydrogen}} peroxide {{for use in}} submarines while submerged; it {{was found to be}} <b>too</b> <b>noisy</b> and require too much maintenance compared to diesel-electric power systems. Some torpedoes used {{hydrogen peroxide}} as oxidizer or propellant. Operator error in the use of hydrogen-peroxide torpedoes was named as possible causes for the sinkings of HMS Sidon and the Russian submarine Kursk. SAAB Underwater Systems is manufacturing the Torpedo 2000. This torpedo, used by the Swedish Navy, is powered by a piston engine propelled by HTP as an oxidizer and kerosene as a fuel in a bipropellant system.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Old Ebbitt Grill was busiest on {{weekends}} in the spring, when {{high school student}} tourist business was at its highest in the city. The restaurant was praised by the Washington Post {{for being able to}} accommodate large groups, offering a variety of plain and upscale food, providing friendly service, and having the best raw bar in the city. The restaurant was also criticized by the newspaper for being <b>too</b> <b>noisy</b> for conversation, and providing bland hamburgers, salads, and breakfast. By 2008, however, Old Ebbitt Grill had improved. Post food critic Tom Sietsema continued to laud the friendly service. He also praised the Breakfast Club, a deep-fried ham, French toast, and bacon breakfast sandwich; he appreciated small touches such as coat hooks near booths and pepper mills on tables; and found the staff's honesty about menu choices refreshing.|$|E
5000|$|... "The Other Side" [...] {{received}} mixed reviews. Simon Reynolds, of Digital Spy, said in {{his review}} that the song [...] "continues their switch to a more mainstream, 'chartable' sound", and that it [...] "seems far <b>too</b> cluttered, <b>noisy</b> and confused to become a chart hit". He {{went on to say}} it [...] "is percussive and clearly designed to get dance floors moving, but outside of that context it's little more than a boisterous, unwanted assault on the ear drums".|$|R
25|$|Most older {{units have}} been retired from service in Buenos Aires, {{as they are}} {{considered}} <b>too</b> dangerous and <b>noisy</b> {{for use in the}} fast-paced city. They were disposed of, or sent to smaller cities all over the country. Colectivos are usually retired only when they are too damaged to be repaired; some of them have “resuscitated” as fine motorhomes.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{was quite}} right about them being surprised, <b>Noisy,</b> <b>too,</b> they was, an' {{the things they}} said about the man they'd just been wanting to give granite tombstones to was simply astonishing. It {{would have taken a}} whole {{cemetery}} o' tombstones to put down all they said about him, and then they'd ha' had to cut the letters small.|$|R
500|$|After its release, [...] "New Guy" [...] {{received}} a mixed response from music critics. Some {{argued that the}} artists' rapping abilities were impressive, while others found its production to be <b>too</b> <b>noisy.</b> An accompanying music video for the track was released on 14 June {{of the same year}} and directed by Justin Campos. The clip displays the duo performing the track in various rooms with dark scenery and ends with them approaching the outside world.|$|E
2500|$|For {{relatively}} low frequency forcing, servohydraulic (electrohydraulic) shakers are used. [...] For higher frequencies, electrodynamic shakers are used. [...] Generally, {{one or more}} [...] "input" [...] or [...] "control" [...] points located on the DUT-side of a fixture is kept at a specified acceleration. Other [...] "response" [...] points experience maximum vibration level (resonance) or minimum vibration level (anti-resonance). It is often desirable to achieve anti-resonance to keep a system from becoming <b>too</b> <b>noisy,</b> or to reduce strain on certain parts due to vibration modes caused by specific vibration frequencies [...]|$|E
2500|$|The {{building}} {{featured a}} central circular block (officially {{known as the}} Main Block, but often referred to by staff as the [...] "doughnut") around which were studios, offices, engineering areas and the News Centre. In {{the centre of the}} main block was a statue designed by T.B. Huxley-Jones of Helios, the Greek god of the sun, to symbolise the radiation of television around the world. At the foot of the statue were two reclining figures, symbolising sound and vision, the components of television. It was originally a fountain, but owing to the building's unique shape it was <b>too</b> <b>noisy</b> for the staff in the overlooking offices, and there were problems with water leakage into the videotape area directly beneath. Even though there was a foundation stone marked 'BBC 1956' {{in the basement of the}} main building, construction began in 1951. Various extensions have been added.|$|E
40|$|The WiQA pilot task explores how {{to select}} new and useful {{information}} that could be included in Wikipedia articles. Our system explores how the combination of NE and cosine similarity allow to detect new and repeated information. We have submitted two runs for the Spanish subtask wich differ {{in the way they}} select candidate sentences using the link structure in the WikipediaXML corpus. Our approach obtains results that provide at least a new snippet per topic in average. The main limitation was found in the candidate selection strategy that results in some topics being not answered or in other cases providing <b>too</b> much <b>noisy</b> candidates...|$|R
60|$|Among the spectators, <b>too,</b> was the <b>noisy</b> brood of Boston school-boys, {{who came}} running, with {{laughter}} and shouts, {{to gaze at}} this crowd of oddly dressed foreigners. At first they danced and capered around them, full of merriment and mischief. But the despair of the Acadians soon had its effect upon these thoughtless lads, and melted them into tearful sympathy.|$|R
50|$|A stingy {{man eats}} the pits of some cherries, causing a tree to grow {{on top of}} his head. When crowds start {{converging}} on his head and be noisy, he uproots the tree, creating a lake.

2500|$|The car and its town {{changed their}} Second World War-era names to [...] "Volkswagen" [...] and [...] "Wolfsburg" [...] respectively, and {{production}} increased. It was still unclear {{what was to}} become of the factory. It was offered to representatives from the American, Australian, British, and French motor industries. Famously, all rejected it. After an inspection of the plant, Sir William Rootes, head of the British Rootes Group, told Hirst the project would fail within two years, and that the car [...] "...is quite unattractive to the average motorcar buyer, is too ugly and <b>too</b> <b>noisy</b> ... If you think you're going to build cars in this place, you're a bloody fool, young man." [...] The official report said [...] "To build the car commercially would be a completely uneconomic enterprise." [...] In an ironic twist of fate, Volkswagen manufactured a locally built version of Rootes's Hillman Avenger in Argentina in the 1980s, long after Rootes had gone bankrupt at the hands of Chrysler in 1978—the Beetle outliving the Avenger by over 30 years.|$|E
2500|$|In 1920, Wittgenstein {{was given}} {{his first job}} as a primary school teacher in Trattenbach, under his real name, in a remote village {{of a few hundred}} people. His first letters {{describe}} it as beautiful, but in October 1921, he wrote to Russell: [...] "I am still at Trattenbach, surrounded, as ever, by odiousness and baseness. I know that human beings on the average are not worth much anywhere, but here they are much more good-for-nothing and irresponsible than elsewhere." [...] He was soon the object of gossip among the villagers, who found him eccentric at best. He did not get on well with the other teachers; when he found his lodgings <b>too</b> <b>noisy,</b> he made a bed for himself in the school kitchen. He was an enthusiastic teacher, offering late-night extra tuition to several of the students, something that did not endear him to the parents, though some of them came to adore him; his sister Hermine occasionally watched him teach and said the students [...] "literally crawled over each other in their desire to be chosen for answers or demonstrations." ...|$|E

40|$|The Virtual Window {{system uses}} head {{movements}} {{in a local}} office to control camera movement in a remote office. The result is like a window allowing exploration of remote scenes rather than a flat screen showing moving pictures. Our analysis of the system, experience implementing a prototype, and observations of people using it, combine {{to suggest that it}} may help overcome the limitations of typical media space configurations. In particular, it seems useful in offering an expanded field of view, reducing visual discontinuities, allowing mutual negotiation of orientation, providing depth information, and supporting camera awareness. The prototype we built is <b>too</b> large, <b>noisy,</b> slow and inaccurate for extended use, but it is valuable in opening a space of possibilities for the design of systems that allow richer access to remote colleagues...|$|R
5|$|Everton {{originally}} {{played on}} an open pitch in the south-east corner of the newly laid out Stanley Park, the same site where Liverpool F.C. planned a stadium, however abandoned the project. The first official match took place in 1879. In 1882, a Mr J. Cruit donated land at Priory Road with the necessary facilities required for professional clubs. Cruit asked the club to leave his land after two years because the crowds became far <b>too</b> large and <b>noisy.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{the summer}} of 1922, Allan Loughead {{operated}} a ride concession at Catalina Island. Called [...] "The Thrill Of Avalon," [...] it consisted of a touring car body mounted on two seaplane floats and powered by an aircraft engine driving a pusher propeller. The skimmer proved to be <b>too</b> rough and <b>noisy</b> to be popular and lasted only a year. Later, {{when asked if he}} made any profit on the venture, Loughead laughed and said, [...] "No, we went broke, which was not a new experience!" ...|$|R

50|$|According to legend, Przemysł Hill {{was created}} by dark powers. When Mieszko I was baptized, the Devil, angry, decided to sink the entire city of Poznań. He pulled {{out one of the}} hills near Gniezno, and, with a group of demons, tried to block the flow of the Warta. However, the evil forces started to {{celebrate}} their victory <b>too</b> early; their <b>noisy</b> behavior awoke the roosters, which began to crow. The devil and his demons were so scared that they left the hill {{on the bank of the}} Warta.|$|R
2500|$|Professional clubs {{required}} proper enclosed facilities. In 1882, a Mr J. Cruit donated land at Priory Road {{which became}} the club's home for two years, with proper hoarding and turnstiles. [...] Mr Cruit asked the club to leave his land as the crowds became far <b>too</b> large and <b>noisy.</b> Everton moved to nearby Anfield in 1884, [...] renting from John Orrell, a friend of Houlding. Proper covered stands were built. Houlding bought Anfield one year after Everton moved in, Everton initially making a donation to a local hospital in lieu of rent before paying rent to their own president.|$|R
5000|$|The première was not well-received, with near {{unanimous}} criticism {{concerning the}} dancers, orchestra, and stage sets. Tchaikovsky's masterful score {{was lost in}} the debacle of the poor production, and though there were a few critics who recognised its virtues, most considered it to be far too complicated for ballet. Most of the critics were not themselves familiar with ballet or music but rather with spoken melodrama. Critics considered Tchaikovsky's music [...] "too <b>noisy,</b> <b>too</b> 'Wagnerian' and too symphonic." [...] The critics also found fault with Reisinger's choreography which they thought was [...] "unimaginative and altogether unmemorable." ...|$|R

40|$|In this {{bachelor}} thesis {{we developed}} a system for the automatic mosaicing of video frames obtained from the mobile platform Parrot AR. Drone. Sequential images were collated by extracting putative matching keypoints. Matching pairs were filtered with the RANSAC algorithm and the estimated homography was optimized using the Levenberg-Marquardt non-linear optimization method. We also present {{a set of rules}} to detect badly estimated homographies. We evaluate the generated mosaics and explain why some images are better suited for mosaicing than others. Moreover, we attempted to reconstruct the flight path using navigation data received from the quadricopter during flight. We concluded that the measured navigation data is <b>too</b> imprecise and <b>noisy</b> to use it for mosaicing...|$|R

60|$|It was {{a strangely}} silent meal. Scarce a word was spoken, {{even in a}} whisper. It {{came as a shock}} to {{everybody}} there, that after all the dictionary should have been taken by one of their number, and that the master's kindness on that occasion should have been requited by another robbery seemed a disgrace to the whole school. That Mather, <b>too,</b> always loud, <b>noisy,</b> and overbearing, should have been the thief was surprising indeed. Had it been some quiet little boy, the sort of boy others are given to regard as a sneak, there would have been less surprise, but that Mather should do such a thing was astounding. These were probably the first reflections which occurred to every boy as he sat down to breakfast.|$|R
