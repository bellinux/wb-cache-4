5000|$|<b>Toadfish</b> {{make up a}} {{large portion}} of the dolphin's diet. More {{specifically}} 13%. Scientific experiments have shown that the mating call of the <b>toadfish</b> alerts dolphin predators to the fish's location. Similarly, the sounds caused by the dolphin when it is hunting its prey alert <b>toadfish</b> to the location of the predators and cause the fish to silence their mating call. Male <b>toadfish</b> will reduce their mating calls by up to 50% when they hear the low sound of a dolphin's [...] "pop".|$|R

40|$|Metals {{may have}} direct and {{indirect}} effects on aquatic biota at different trophic levels. This study examined the metal concentrations and nutritional value (protein and lipid content) of sediment infauna consumed by the estuarine smooth <b>toadfish</b> (Tetractenos glaber) at sites with varying metal contamination in the Parramatta River (Sydney Harbour), southeastern Australia, and the resulting influence on <b>toadfish</b> size and their tissue metal concentrations. Metal concentrations in sediments showed positive linear relationships (r 2 = 0. 29 – 0. 87; P < 0. 001, n = 12) with metal concentrations in sediment infauna. Metal concentrations in <b>toadfish</b> tissues were also linearly and positively related to metal concentrations in both sediments (r 2 = 0. 32 – 0. 73; P < 0. 001, n = 55) and infauna (r 2 = 0. 27 – 0. 72; P < 0. 001, n = 55), indicating that sediment and infauna are an important metal exposure pathway for <b>toadfish.</b> Of the key <b>toadfish</b> prey items (sediment infauna), polychaetes (Marphysa sanguinea) generally had the highest metal concentrations and nutritional value followed by semaphore crabs (Heloecius cordiformis) and black mussels (Xenostrobus securis). Polychaetes from the most contaminated site generally had higher metal concentrations and higher nutritional value than those from the least contaminated site. <b>Toadfish</b> from the most contaminated site generally had the highest metal concentrations, and were 15 % larger and 41 % heavier than similarly-aged <b>toadfish</b> from the least contaminated site, suggesting that <b>toadfish</b> may be benefiting in size due to ingestion of sediment infauna of higher nutritional value...|$|R
