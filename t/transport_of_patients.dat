Eventually Douglas C-1 transports were modified to carry up to 9 litter patients and were used on an opportune basis in the US and Panama. This led to a directive that all future military transports be equipped with brackets for carrying litters.|$|E

40|$|Background. The {{treatment}} of acute coronary syndrom (ACS) with ST-segment elevation with primary {{percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty}} (PTCA) {{has been a}} routine method for treatment <b>of</b> these <b>patients</b> in KC Ljubljana since April 2000.  Using this method, mortality due to ACS, reinfarction, total number of death and strokes in comparison to thrombolytic therapy were highly reduced. Since May 2001 primary PTCA has been attainable also for patients from regional hospitals to be transferred quickly enough to Ljubljana. Methods. A retrospective analysis <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> with ACS with ST-segment elevation who have been transferred from General Hospital Novo mesto to KC Ljubljana in the period from Oct. 1, 2001 to March 31, 2002 to have a primary PTCA was performed. The analysis comprised the following: time interval from the chest pain start to the arrival <b>of</b> <b>patient</b> to the General Hospital Novo mesto, handling <b>of</b> <b>patient</b> at Internistic department of General Hospital Novo mesto, <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>patient</b> to Ljubljana and total time interval from the arrival <b>of</b> <b>patient</b> to the first inflation of balloon in Ljubljana. Results. In the upper mentioned period 14 patient (12 males and 2 females) were transported from the General Hospital Novo mesto to the KC Ljubljana to perform a primary PTCA. Our patients arrive to hospital very late. Due to problems with transport organisation and patient’s escort and duty, total time interval measured between the patient arrival to the General Hospital Novo mesto to the first inflation of balloon in Ljubljana was 2 h and 42 minutes. That was longer that had been stated previously in the literature. Conclusions. In our opinion, primary PTCA is practicable also for patients admitted to a regional hospital because of ACS with ST-segment elevation. The <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>patient</b> is safe. Better organisation of Health Service and patient transportion would shorten the time needed to perform the first inflation of balloon in Ljubljana. </p...|$|R
