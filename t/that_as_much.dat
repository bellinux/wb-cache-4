5|$|Geological {{mapping of}} the volcano has {{indicated}} <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as 80% {{of the volcano}}'s surface has been topped by lava flows during the last 5,000years, entirely composed of shield alkalic basalt. More than half of this is under 3,000years old, and about 12% is less than 1,000years of age. Between the years 1700 and 2016, eruptions originated from six vents; four of these lava flows poured into the sea to the west coast.|$|E
5|$|This {{control was}} further {{consolidated}} during the wars and conflicts of the 17th century, which witnessed English and Scottish colonisation in the Plantations of Ireland, the Wars of the Three Kingdoms and the Williamite War. Irish losses during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms (which, in Ireland, included the Irish Confederacy and the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland) {{are estimated to}} include 20,000 battlefield casualties. 200,000 civilians are estimated to have {{died as a result}} of a combination of war-related famine, displacement, guerrilla activity and pestilence over the duration of the war. A further 50,000 were sent into indentured servitude in the West Indies. Some historians estimate <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as half of the pre-war population of Ireland may have {{died as a result of}} the conflict.|$|E

5|$|While Middleton {{was helping}} LSU recover from this {{traumatic}} ordeal, {{he was also}} {{keeping an eye on}} events in Europe. In July 1940 he wrote a letter to General George Marshall asking if his services were needed by the Army as the United States was making preparations for war. Marshall replied <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as the Army would like to have Middleton back in uniform, all the Army could do would be to place him in some training role, which would not effectively use his battle experience.|$|E
5|$|It is {{estimated}} <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as another 1.2 GW of capacity remains available to exploit, {{mostly in the}} form of micro and small-hydro developments such as the existing one in Knoydart and a system planned for Kingussie. In reality, environmental constraints and given that the most easily available catchment areas have already been exploited {{it is unlikely that the}} full 1.2 GW will exploited. The 100 MW Glendoe Project which opened in 2009 was the first large scale dam in Scotland for almost fifty years but is likely to be one of the last of its kind. There is also further potential for new pumped storage schemes (at present used to meet peak demand) that would work with intermittent sources of power such as wind and wave. Examples include the 440 MW Cruachan Dam and 300 MW Falls of Foyers schemes. A 2011 report calculated that pumped storage hydro capacity could supply 2.8 GW of electricity for 5 hours, then drop to 1.1 GW and run out of water in 22 hours. The report concluded that even with projected new schemes at Loch Ness and Loch Sloy, pumped storage would not be able to replace wind electricity during extended windless periods.|$|E
