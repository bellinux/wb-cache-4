5|$|The {{demolition}} crew {{took control}} of the site by erecting scaffolding on 6 December 2006, and demolition commenced on 12 December. Workers took down the clock mechanism and clock face, leaving a gaping hole, and then proceeded to lift the clock tower off in one piece. After the protesters had been dispersed, the remainder of the pier was completely dismantled, away from <b>the</b> <b>glare</b> <b>of</b> publicity.|$|E
5|$|The {{difficulties}} of night fighting {{was evident in}} the performance of the night-fighter squadrons. One Fairey Battle was shot down in error by a Blenheim which could not correctly identify the aircraft; some other Blenheims crashed after being caught in <b>the</b> <b>glare</b> <b>of</b> search lights at low-level and return-fire from German bombers had inflicted at least one loss whilst 29 Squadron succeeded on bring down only one German aircraft. While identification friend or foe (IFF) devices had been fitted to some British aircraft they were not always switched on. Braham also experienced technical malfunctions in the Blenheims which prompted him to call into question their reliability. On one occasion the hydraulic pipe fractured in the Blenheim he was flying which caused the landing gear to fail and prompted Braham to force-land. At this time he was joined by his gunner/observer Bill Gregory with whom he was to fly frequently.|$|E

60|$|He {{turned to}} flee: but, once outside the church, he sank exhausted, and lay upon the steps, {{watching}} with stupid horror <b>the</b> <b>glaring</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fire, and the mob who leaped and yelled like demons round their Moloch sacrifice.|$|R

25|$|The {{location}} of sex was also important. People had to avoid <b>the</b> <b>glare</b> <b>of</b> the sun, moon or stars, {{the interior of}} shrines, proximity to temples, wells, stoves and privies, and the vicinity of graves or coffins.|$|E
25|$|Formerly {{located between}} and {{parallel}} to Queen Street and Victoria Street, and bisected by Ophir Road, Johore Road was the less well-known cousin of its glamorous counterpart, Bugis Street, just a stone's throw away. It was the seedy haunt of transgender prostitutes who solicited sex from locals, away from <b>the</b> <b>glare</b> <b>of</b> Western tourists. No photographs or media attention {{were focused on}} this street of ill-repute; only a no-frills approach to an economic exchange.|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} year, Italian {{astronomer}} Giuseppe Piazzi discovered the dwarf planet Ceres. Piazzi could only track Ceres for somewhat {{more than a}} month, following it for three degrees across the night sky. Then it disappeared temporarily behind <b>the</b> <b>glare</b> <b>of</b> the Sun. Several months later, when Ceres should have reappeared, Piazzi could not locate it: the mathematical tools of the time {{were not able to}} extrapolate a position from such a scant amount of data—three degrees represent less than 1% of the total orbit.|$|E
60|$|For {{the first}} hour, talking little, Davies and Wemple {{stumbled}} along the apology for {{a road that}} led through the jungle to the lodge. They did discuss <b>the</b> <b>glares</b> <b>of</b> several fires to the east along the south bank of Panuco River, and hoped fervently that they were dwellings and not wells.|$|R
60|$|Wade {{knew when}} danger of life loomed imminent. He fixed his glance upon <b>the</b> <b>glaring</b> eyes <b>of</b> Belllounds.|$|R

25|$|Astronomers have {{discovered}} some stars that seemingly orbit around an empty space. Astrometric binaries are relatively nearby stars {{which can be}} seen to wobble around a point in space, with no visible companion. The same mathematics used for ordinary binaries can be applied to infer the mass of the missing companion. The companion could be very dim, so that it is currently undetectable or masked by <b>the</b> <b>glare</b> <b>of</b> its primary, or it could be an object that emits little or no electromagnetic radiation, for example a neutron star.|$|E
25|$|NSG commandos {{based in}} Mehram Nagar, Palam Airport, Delhi took 10 hours {{to reach the}} sites. They were ready at 01:00, but had to wait three hours (until 03:15) for an {{aircraft}} to arrive from Chandigarh when the policy was that a plane be at Palam permanently. The NSG commandos landed at Mumbai Airport at 05:15, but had to wait an hour for the Bombay police to arrange BEST buses for them. They reached the Taj Mahal Hotel and the Oberoi Trident Hotel at 07:00, but initially were not given detailed maps of the buildings. The operations in the Taj Mahal hotel and Nariman House were conducted under <b>the</b> <b>glare</b> <b>of</b> the media, which may have assisted the terrorists by removing the element of surprise.|$|E
25|$|Proteus is {{the second}} largest moon of Neptune. It is about 420 {{kilometres}} in diameter, larger than Nereid, the second to be discovered. It was not discovered by Earth-based telescopes {{because it is so}} close to Neptune that it is lost in <b>the</b> <b>glare</b> <b>of</b> reflected sunlight. The surface of Proteus is dark—its geometrical albedo is about 10%. The color of its surface is neutral as the reflectivity does not change appreciably with the wavelength from violet to green. In the near-infrared around 2μm Proteus's surface becomes less reflective, pointing to a possible presence of complex organic compounds such as hydrocarbons or cyanides. These compounds may be responsible for the low albedo of the inner Neptunian moons. Although Proteus is usually thought to contain significant amounts of water ice, it has not been detected spectroscopically on the surface.|$|E

25|$|The {{elevated}} {{section is}} supported by steel-reinforced concrete columns. The roadway itself was constructed on top of concrete slabs supported by steel girders. The height of the elevated section is higher than required to cross city streets and provide clearance underneath. The intent of this was to reduce traffic noise at ground level. The highest point of the elevated section is the eastbound ramp from the Gardiner to the Don Valley Parkway which goes {{up and over the}} westbound lanes, then drops to ground level. The elevated sections of the Gardiner use a tall wall concrete barrier topped with green metal blades. The blades act to reduce <b>the</b> <b>glare</b> <b>of</b> oncoming headlights from the opposing direction of traffic. During the original construction concrete parapet walls with metal railings were used in the outer sections as well as a divider between west bound and east bound traffic. At grade sections west of Bathurst Street use steel guard rails, but originally featured a narrow grass median.|$|E
25|$|After honing their live set at Slattery's, {{they played}} two concerts, {{afternoon}} and evening, at Newbridge College on Thursday, 16 March 1972. Donovan {{was in the}} audience and invited Planxty to open for him on his six-date Irish tour the following week, during which their first major performanceat the Hangar in Galwaywas a huge success. Neither the audience nor the band knew what to expect, and both were pleasantly surprised. Irvine, unable to see the audience through <b>the</b> <b>glare</b> <b>of</b> the stage lights, was worried that the crowd {{might be on the}} verge of rioting. It took him several minutes to realize that what he was hearing was the expression of their enthusiastic response to the band's music. On 21 April 1972, Planxty embarked on their first tour of England, which had been booked previously by Moore, and played small folk clubs in Manchester, Bolton, Leeds, Hull, Barnsley, Blackpool, Newcastle, Chester and London, to great acclaim, returning to Ireland in May.|$|E

60|$|About the dawning {{of the day}} he {{was awakened}} by the sound <b>of</b> voices and <b>the</b> <b>glaring</b> <b>of</b> lights.

500|$|At 19:00, {{about an}} hour after they had left Tagauayan, PT-34 and PT-41 spotted a Japanese cruiser. Bulkeley made a sharp turn due west, and headed at top speed, about , into the setting sun. Whether {{because of the high}} waves, <b>the</b> <b>glare</b> <b>of</b> the sun, or simple inattentiveness, the cruiser did not spot them. After midnight, the weather began to worsen, with heavy swells and {{sporadic}} squalls. Kelly later recalled: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{pipeline}} {{debate of}} 1956 sparked a dramatic opposition {{stand on the}} importance of free parliamentary debate. Their arrogance did the Grits [...] enormous damage, contributing heavily to the government's problems in the 1957 general election.

500|$|In {{the cities}} where the train stopped, 1.5million people viewed Lincoln in his coffin.

But the next moment the train leaped across the chasm, striking the rails exactly even, and dashing out the life of Burke the Slogger, sped away to Sloperton.|$|R
