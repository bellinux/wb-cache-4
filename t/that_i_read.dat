Clarke {{put his finger}} on quite a number of bright thoughts. He and I have something in common: we both took out of the public library the same science fiction book when we were boys of about 15 or 16, which was Stapledon's Last and First Men. We took it out of the same country library in Porlock in Somerset. Whoever put that book on the shelves had a lot to answer for!" ...|$|E
2500|$|J. Baldwin {{was a young}} {{designer}} and instructor of design at colleges around the San Francisco Bay (San Francisco State University , the San Francisco Art Institute, and the California College of the Arts [...] ). As he recalled in the film Ecological Design (1994), [...] "Stewart Brand came to me because he heard <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> catalogs. [...] He said, 'I {{want to make this}} thing called a [...] "whole Earth" [...] catalog so that anyone on Earth can pick up a telephone and find out the complete information on anything. ...That’s my goal.'" [...] Baldwin served as the chief editor of subjects in the areas of technology and design, both in the catalog itself and in other publications which arose from it.|$|E
2500|$|The {{idea for}} the name of the film came to Cross from a T-shirt at a novelty store that had the phrase [...] "Normal People Scare Me" [...] printed on it. [...] "I thought it was {{absolutely}} perfect," [...] said Cross of the phrase he saw on the T-shirt. In an appearance on Sunday Today, Cross explained to Campbell Brown: [...] "Yeah, I was thinking I--it actually just came off a T-shirt <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>read,</b> which totally makes sense either way because the real underlying message, if--if you've noticed it, even I haven't noticed it until like recently, like the whole underlying message is `What is normal anyway?' I mean, that just kind of gives it off in the title." ...|$|E

2500|$|Brown is a Christian. He says, I'm not a spooky snake handler because I live in Georgia and I'm Christian, that I {{believe in}} the Bible, that I travel with the Bible, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> the Bible every day. I'm still me. I'm still a guy doing a job. I find, actually, that people ask me a lot about it. I don't hit people {{over the head with}} the Bible ...

You know what? People are going to stare at you. I used to feel really self-conscious. But I've gotten to a point where I think, nah, I'm not going to feel bad about that. I'm not going to apologize about that. Brown said in a December 2014 interview in Time that he [...] "could no longer abide the Southern Baptist Convention's indoctrination of children and its anti-gay stance" [...] adding that he's now [...] "searching for a new belief system." ...|$|E
