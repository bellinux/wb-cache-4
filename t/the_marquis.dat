5|$|A third subplot centres on the {{relationship}} between Fenwick, Mr. Puddleham, the village's Methodist minister, and <b>the</b> <b>Marquis</b> of Trowbridge, Bullhampton's principal landowner. <b>The</b> <b>marquis</b> believes that Sam Brattle is guilty of the murder, and is angered by Fenwick's support for him. He spreads rumours about Fenwick's relations with Carry Brattle, and grants Puddleham permission to build a chapel on a piece of land neighbouring Fenwick's residence, where he hopes that the sight of it and the sound of its bell will annoy the vicar. Fenwick tries to reconcile himself to the existence of the chapel, but it subsequently comes to light that the land does not belong to <b>the</b> <b>marquis,</b> and is instead part of the parish's glebe. The embarrassed marquis pays to move the chapel to a new location, and through the intervention of his son, a suave Member of Parliament, he and Fenwick are reconciled.|$|E
5|$|The assault, however, was {{a costly}} failure. After twenty-two days of {{prolonged}} action, {{during which the}} defenders, led by <b>the</b> <b>Marquis</b> of Lanzarote, virtually wiped out Almado's regiment with musketry fire and firebombs, Mendes de Vasconcelos ordered a withdrawal.|$|E
5|$|The site {{chosen for}} this summer retreat {{was in a}} secluded hollow. It had {{originally}} been owned by <b>the</b> <b>Marquis</b> of Castelo Rodrigo. When the ruling Spanish were driven from Portugal in 1640, <b>the</b> <b>Marquis</b> was accused of having collaborated with the Spanish and the property was seized by the Portuguese Crown. The estate and its hunting lodge then {{became one of the}} many properties of the Portuguese king, João IV. He set it aside as one of the properties reserved for the second son of the reigning monarch. Thus it came into the hands of Dom Pedro, the second son of João V.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>Marquis's</b> eyebrows were {{slightly}} elevated. Otherwise he was unmoved.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> Elder <b>Marquis</b> de Villeduval - The {{deceased}} {{father of}} <b>the</b> current <b>Marquis</b> and <b>the</b> late Armand de Villeduval. <b>The</b> late <b>Marquis</b> was, unlike his eldest son, a kind-hearted man, and favoured the similarly compassionate Armand over his cruel and wasteful elder son. <b>The</b> Elder <b>Marquis</b> died broken-hearted after Armand was killed. <b>The</b> Elder <b>Marquis</b> knew that Armand and Isabelle Gautier were lovers, and bequeathed an enormous fortune to Sido {{for her to}} inherit upon her wedding day. His first wife, according to Maître Tardieu, died in an asylum after going insane; <b>the</b> current <b>Marquis</b> de Villeduval inherited his madness from her.|$|R

5|$|Charles Carnan Ridgely {{frequently}} entertained prominent {{guests in}} the Mansion's 51ft.x21ft. (16 m by 6.4 m) Great Hall, such as Charles Carroll of Carrollton, {{who was a}} signer of the Declaration of Independence, and Revolutionary War general, <b>the</b> <b>Marquis</b> de Lafayette. Charles Carnan served as governor of Maryland between 181619. When Governor Ridgely died in 1829, he freed Hampton's slaves in his will.|$|E
5|$|Dodington was {{the site}} of the Buckingham Mine where copper was extracted. The mine was {{established}} before 1725 and followed earlier exploration at Perry Hill, East Quantoxhead. It was financed by <b>the</b> <b>Marquis</b> of Buckingham until 1801 when it was closed, until various attempts were made to reopen it during the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Piattoli {{traveled}} through Europe in the retinue of the Lubomirski family, including Izabela, {{and as a}} tutor of young Henryk Lubomirski. During that time he developed extensive contacts at various European courts in Courland, Austria (Vienna), Italy (Turin) and France (Paris). During his three-year stay in the Lubomirskis' Parisian residence, he was in touch with many important men of the Age of Enlightenment. He met—often through another Florentinian, Filippo Mazzei—Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Thomas Jefferson, <b>the</b> <b>Marquis</b> de Lafayette, Luigi Landriani, Girolamo Lucchesini, and <b>the</b> <b>Marquis</b> de Condorcet. He also corresponded with J. G. Herder. In Poland, he developed close contacts with Ignacy Potocki and Julian Ursyn Niemcewicza. From 1787 he also tutored Adam Jerzy Czartoryski, later an important politician in the Russian Empire, on whom Piattoli would retain significant influence.|$|E
60|$|But <b>the</b> <b>Marquis's</b> morbid energy over-reached itself. Twice Syme, parrying, knocked his opponent's point {{far out of}} the {{fighting}} circle; and the third time his riposte was so rapid, {{that there was no}} doubt about the hit this time. Syme's sword actually bent under the weight of <b>the</b> <b>Marquis's</b> body, which it had pierced.|$|R
60|$|CZAR. Quite right, Prince Paul; you {{are always}} right. See that <b>the</b> <b>Marquis's</b> letters are made out at once.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>Marquis's</b> face cleared. He drank his {{cocktail}} {{and pronounced}} it delicious. On the threshold {{he paused and}} looked back.|$|R
5|$|The rumours were correct. In 1845, the MacLean laird {{sold the}} island to the Marquess of Salisbury, who {{converted}} Rùm into an estate for country sports. <b>The</b> <b>Marquis</b> first built a pier at Kinloch, and adjacent limekiln, to help with this process, re-introducing deer, both Red and Fallow. He then passed the land to his son, Viscount Cranbourne, who {{was more interested in}} fishing.|$|E
5|$|To raise {{additional}} {{funding for the}} over-running production, Zwoboda had used the success of La Bête Humaine to sell advanced screening rights in large theatres to Jean Jay, {{the director of the}} Gaumont Film Company. When shooting in Sologne finally began progress was slow because of the constant improvisations of the actorswhich Renoir encouragedand Gregor's struggles with her role. Jay visited the set and was unhappy with the slow progress and with Renoir's performance. The cast and crew however admired Renoir and enjoyed the carefree atmosphere on set, forgetting about the impending political situation. The cast's improvisations caused some changes from the original script. Christine was initially written as a bored, upper class bourgeois whose main preoccupation was planning parties, but Renoir amended this to accommodate Gregor's acting. Renoir also cut most of the references to Christine's conductor father Stiller, such as his relationship with <b>the</b> <b>Marquis.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Marquis</b> was initially written as a patron of the arts and music instead of a collector of music boxes.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} {{religious}} beliefs are represented among the novel's characters. Jacob Brattle is an unbeliever. Puddleham is a Primitive Methodist. The Stowte family, to which <b>the</b> <b>marquis</b> belongs, are Low Church Anglicans, and Fenwick is High church and latitudinarian. Their charity is tested by {{their response to}} Carry Brattle, and it is Fenwick who passes the test. As William Cadbury expresses it, Puddleham has been hardened by too much doctrine, Jacob Brattle by too little.|$|E
50|$|A tale of lust {{that begins}} with a girl who married a wealthy aristocrat whose {{previous}} wives all disappeared under mysterious circumstances. She was given free rein in <b>the</b> <b>Marquis's</b> castle save for one room that she must never enter under any circumstance. Though she promised her husband, the girl later broke her vow while he was away and found the secret room to hold the murdered corpses of <b>the</b> <b>Marquis's</b> previous wives.|$|R
60|$|His lordship was at home, {{said the}} sombre, dingy servant, and {{in half a}} minute Arthur found himself in <b>the</b> <b>marquis's</b> study and in <b>the</b> <b>marquis's</b> presence, with his nose all red and moist, his feet in an agony of cold, his fingers benumbed, and his teeth chattering. He was barely allowed time {{to take off his}} greatcoat, and, as he did so, he felt almost disinclined to part with so good a friend.|$|R

5|$|After a {{hard but}} {{inconclusive}} fight during which Admiral Brézé was killed, the French fleet withdrew to Toulon leaving {{the sea to}} the Spanish, who decided not to pursue them to relieve Orbetello. The land forces disembarked by Count of Linhares a few days later, however, failed to dislodge the French lines, and the siege could be undertaken until 24 July, when another Spanish army led by <b>the</b> <b>Marquis</b> of Torrecuso and the Duke of Arcos, which {{had come from the}} Kingdom of Naples across the Papal States, defeated the besieging French troops, forcing them to retreat with heavy losses.|$|E
5|$|At the Crystal Palace dog show in 1870, in {{what was}} {{considered}} to be the dog champion class of that time with the qualification requirement of a first place win at another show, Old Jock placed second. The winner was a black and tan terrier named Trimmer, with a line-up of notable dogs {{in the history of the}} Fox Terrier including Mr. Murchison's Old Trap; Mr. W.J. Harrison's Jocko; Mr. F Sale's Tyrant, Hornet and Tartar; <b>the</b> <b>Marquis</b> of Huntly's Bounce; Mr. Bewley and Mr. Carson's Quiz; and Mr. W. Gammon's Chance. This was the final time Old Jock was exhibited in the show ring.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1896, Barrington spent ten very {{successful}} years under {{the management of}} George Edwardes at Daly's Theatre, first taking {{over the role of}} <b>the</b> <b>Marquis</b> Imari in The Geisha (1896), and then creating roles {{in a number of other}} Edwardian musical comedy hits, including Marcus Pomponius in A Greek Slave (1898), Yen How in San Toy (1899), The Rajah of Bhong in A Country Girl (1902), and Boobhamba in The Cingalee (1904), among others.|$|E

5|$|Dissension {{resulting}} from inadequate government attention to Army needs was restrained under {{the generation of}} officers who had begun their careers during the 1820s. These officers were loyal to the monarchy, believed the military should be under civilian control, and abhorred the caudillism (Hispanic-American dictatorships) against which they had fought. But by the early 1880s, this generation (including commanders such as the Duke of Caxias, the Count of Porto Alegre, and <b>the</b> <b>Marquis</b> of Erval) had died, were retired, or no longer exercised direct command.|$|E
5|$|French {{psychoanalyst}} Jacques Lacan linked psychoanalysis with Kantian {{ethics in}} his works The Ethics of Psychoanalysis and Kant avec Sade and compared Kant with <b>the</b> <b>Marquis</b> de Sade. Lacan argued that Sade's maxim of jouissance—the pursuit of sexual pleasure or enjoyment—is morally acceptable by Kant's criteria {{because it can}} be universalised. He proposed that, while Kant presented human freedom as critical to the moral law, Sade further argued that human freedom is only fully realised through the maxim of jouissance.|$|E
5|$|Güell's {{first task}} for Gaudí, that same year, was {{the design of}} the {{furniture}} for the pantheon chapel of the Palacio de Sobrellano in Comillas, which was then being constructed by Joan Martorell, Gaudí's teacher, at the request of <b>the</b> <b>Marquis</b> of Comillas, Güell's father in law. Gaudí designed a chair, a bench and a prayer stool: the chair was upholstered with velvet, finished with two eagles and the Marquis's coat of arms; the bench stands out with the motif of a dragon, designed by Llorenç Matamala; the prayer stool is decorated with plants.|$|E

5|$|Having {{dealt with}} the French naval threat, Rooke left as many men, guns and {{supplies}} at Gibraltar as he could before sailing for home. He split off part of his fleet, leaving Admiral Sir John Leake with 18 ships to patrol the strait and the Portuguese coast. The Spanish had already mobilised their forces and {{at the start of}} September <b>the</b> <b>Marquis</b> of Villadarias, the captain-general of Andalusia, arrived in the vicinity of Gibraltar with an army of 4,000 men. Villadarias planned to increase his force to 12,000, consisting of 9,000 Spaniards and 3,000 Frenchmen. The Two Crowns force was also supplemented by many of the civilian refugees from Gibraltar.|$|E
5|$|He {{is noted}} for his {{literary}} {{research on the}} authors of the 18th century. He published many previously unpublished works by authors including Paradis Moncrif, Benserade, Caylus, Besenval, <b>the</b> <b>Marquis</b> de Sade and Baudelaire. He founded the Société des Bibliophiles Contemporaines, of which he was president. His research produced a considerable literary output and frequent publications in newspapers such as L'Echo, Le Plume, Dépêche de Toulouse, Le Mercure de France, Le Gaulois and Le Figaro of Paris.|$|E
5|$|In 1685 Siam {{attempted}} to cede Singora to France: the {{hope was that}} the French East India Company, supported by a garrison of troops, could rebuild the city, establish a trading post and counter the strong regional Dutch influence. The city was offered to France's envoy to Siam, the Chevalier de Chaumont, and a provisional treaty signed in December; Siamese ambassador Kosa Pan sailed to France the following year to ratify the cession. The French, however, were not interested: Secretary of State for the Navy, <b>the</b> <b>Marquis</b> de Seignelay, told Kosa Pan that Singora was ruined and of no further use, {{and asked for a}} trading post in Bangkok instead.|$|E
60|$|Merton was ushered {{again into}} Dr. Fogarty's {{room on the}} ground floor. Presently the other doctor reappeared, leading a bent and much muffled up figure, who {{preserved}} total silence--for excellent reasons. The doctor handed to Merton a sealed envelope, obviously <b>the</b> <b>marquis's</b> will. Merton looked closely {{into the face of}} <b>the</b> old <b>marquis,</b> whose eyes, dropping senile tears, showed no sign of recognition.|$|R
