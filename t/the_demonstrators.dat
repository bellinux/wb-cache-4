5|$|Tensions mounted {{over the}} {{following}} week as sit-in demonstrations spread to other cities and race riots broke out in nearby Chattanooga. On February 27, the Nashville student activists held a fourth sit-in at the Woolworths, McClellan, and Walgreens stores. Crowds of white youths again gathered in the stores to taunt and harass <b>the</b> <b>demonstrators.</b> This time, however, police were not present. Eventually, several of the sit-in demonstrators were attacked by hecklers in the McClellan and Woolworths stores. Some were pulled from their seats and beaten, and one demonstrator was pushed {{down a flight of}} stairs. When police arrived, the white attackers fled and none were arrested. Police then ordered <b>the</b> <b>demonstrators</b> at all three locations to leave the stores. When <b>the</b> <b>demonstrators</b> refused to leave, they were arrested and loaded into police vehicles as onlookers applauded. Eighty-one students were arrested and charged with loitering and disorderly conduct.|$|E

40|$|Experimentation can be {{considered}} {{an effective way to}} study command and control information system (C 2 IS) technology, and at the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI) a demonstrator to support C 2 IS technology experimentation has been established. <b>The</b> <b>demonstrator</b> is used for studying middleware, different communication media, legacy information system integration and user interface equipment employed in C 2 ISs. A key property of <b>the</b> <b>demonstrator</b> is its flexibility provided mainly by its component-based structure.

40|$|Socially-influenced {{learning}} was studied in observer pigeons that observed a demonstrator in an adjacent chamber performing a target response comprising {{standing on a}} box and pecking a key 10 times. In Experiment 1 {{there was no evidence}} for social learning in the absence of reinforcement of the observer's behavior. When the target response was already established in the observer's repertoire, but was not differentially reinforced in relation to <b>the</b> <b>demonstrator's</b> behavior, rates of extinction were not influenced by <b>the</b> <b>demonstrator's</b> behavior (Experiment 2). Reinforcement of the observer's target response {{in the presence of the}} modeled target response, and not in its absence, resulted in control of the observer's responding by the behavior of <b>the</b> <b>demonstrator</b> (Experiments 3 and 4). This control was extended in Experiment 5 to deferred responses that occurred following a delay since <b>the</b> <b>demonstrator's</b> target responses. <b>The</b> acquisition of social influence depended on differential reinforcement of the observer's target response, with <b>the</b> <b>demonstrator's</b> target behavior serving as the explicit discriminative stimulus...|$|R
5|$|In January 2014, Mam Sonando {{organized}} a mass demonstration, which demanded {{the government to}} expand his radio reach and open a TV station.

5|$|A larger demonstration, the 8N, {{took place}} two months later. It was {{attended}} by {{nearly half a million}} people. They protested a variety of issues such as those of the previous demonstration, as well as the growing rate of inflation and the corruption scandals. Kirchner promised to keep her policies unchanged, and Senator Aníbal Fernández dismissed the significance of the demonstrations. Journalist Jorge Lanata explained the polarization was because the government and its supporters thought they were engaged in a revolution, and this justified being against freedom of the press and other public rights. Cabinet Chief Juan Manuel Abal Medina said <b>the</b> <b>demonstrators</b> belonged to a class that was against social justice, and compared the demonstrations to a coup d'état. A similar view was held by Kirchner's loyalists.|$|E
5|$|Acting on James Bevel's {{call for}} a march from Selma to Montgomery, King, Bevel, and the SCLC, in partial {{collaboration}} with SNCC, attempted to organize the march to the state's capital.

5|$|The Cabildo met at 9am and {{rejected}} Cisneros' resignation. They considered that {{the crowd had}} no legitimate right to influence something that the Cabildo had already decided and implemented. They considered that, as the Junta was in command, the demonstration should be suppressed by force, and made the members responsible for any changes to {{the resolution of the}} previous day. To enforce those orders, they summoned the chief commanders, but these did not obey. Many of them, including Saavedra, did not appear.

5|$|The crowd's {{agitation}} increased, {{and they}} overran the chapter house. Leiva and Lezica requested {{that someone who}} could act as spokesman for the people should join them inside the hall and explain the people's desires. Beruti, Chiclana, French and Grela were allowed to pass. Leiva attempted to discourage the rioter Pancho Planes, but he entered the hall as well. The Cabildo argued that Buenos Aires {{had no right to}} break the political system of the viceroyalty without discussing it with the other provinces; French and Chiclana replied that the call for a Congress had already been considered. The Cabildo called the commanders to deliberate with them. As had happened several times in the last few days, Romero explained that the soldiers would mutiny if forced to fight against the rioters on behalf of Cisneros. The Cabildo still refused to give up, until the noise of the demonstration was heard in the hall. They feared that <b>the</b> <b>demonstrators</b> could overrun the building and reach them. Martín Rodríguez pointed out {{that the only way to}} calm <b>the</b> <b>demonstrators</b> was to accept Cisneros' resignation. Leiva agreed, convinced the other members, and the people returned to the Plaza. Rodríguez headed to Azcuenaga's house to meet the other revolutionaries to plan the final stages of the revolution. The demonstration overran the Cabildo again, and reached the hall of deliberations. Beruti spoke on behalf of the people, and said that the new Junta should be elected by the people and not by the Cabildo. He said that, besides the nearly 400people already gathered, the barracks were full of people who supported them, and he threatened that they would take control, by force if necessary.
