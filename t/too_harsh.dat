5|$|Wilson {{initially}} favoured relatively lenient {{treatment of}} Germany – he feared <b>too</b> <b>harsh</b> conditions could foment {{the rise of}} extremism, and wanted Germany to be left sufficient capital to pay for imports. To Keynes's dismay, Lloyd George and Clemenceau were able to pressure Wilson to agree to include pensions in the reparations bill.|$|E

50|$|Eldar {{vehicles}} also {{follow the}} above policy of avoiding <b>too</b> many <b>harsh</b> edges and flat surfaces.

5|$|Belarusian cuisine {{consists}} {{mainly of}} vegetables, meat (particularly pork), and bread. Foods are usually either slowly cooked or stewed. Typically, Belarusians eat a light breakfast and two hearty meals, with dinner being the largest {{meal of the}} day. Wheat and rye breads are consumed in Belarus, but rye is more plentiful because conditions are <b>too</b> <b>harsh</b> for growing wheat. To show hospitality, a host traditionally presents an offering of bread and salt when greeting a guest or visitor.|$|E
5|$|Kulesza {{left his}} job soon afterwards; {{according}} to Majchrzak, he resigned in protest at the players' punishments, which he thought were <b>too</b> <b>harsh.</b> Officials at Widzew Łódź accused the PZPN of bias, saying the association had not supervised the players properly and should shoulder {{some of the}} blame. Directors at Widzew and ŁKS Łódź briefly considered resigning their PZPN memberships and organising their own league championship, but did not. The national team players' council, at that time comprising Marek Dziuba, Paweł Janas and Wojciech Rudy, wrote an open letter expressing surprise at {{what they saw as}} excessive sanctions against Terlecki, Boniek, Żmuda and Młynarczyk. They admitted the goalkeeper's conduct had been far from exemplary, but contended that the incident was only minor, and had been exacerbated by disproportionately prominent and negative press coverage.|$|E
5|$|General Prądzyński {{was once}} again {{dispatched}} to the Russian headquarters, where he was greeted by Grand Duke Michael Pavlovich as Paskevich had been wounded shortly before. Although Michael believed the Poles were playing for time to allow Ramorino's Corps to return from Podlasie, Prądzyński convinced him to send General Berg to Warsaw with a draft of an act of unconditional surrender. The agreement (apparently never signed on paper) stipulated that the Polish Army was free to leave the city, a two-day cease-fire would come into effect and that Warsaw would be spared the horrors it experienced during the 1794 siege. No political clauses were included. Around 17:00 Prądzyński and Berg arrived in Warsaw, where Krukowiecki generally agreed with the Russian terms, but considered them <b>too</b> <b>harsh.</b> Berg and Prądzyński then returned to Russian headquarters and Grand Duke Michael agreed to allow the Polish Army free passage to Modlin and Płock, an amnesty to all fighters of the Uprising, and to exchange prisoners. The new terms were more than acceptable to Krukowiecki. Upon Prądzyński's return the more liberal wing of the government won a temporary majority, and Krukowiecki was ousted from power and replaced with Bonawentura Niemojowski as head of government and General Kazimierz Małachowski as Commander-in-Chief.|$|E

60|$|But the {{reasoning}} is somewhat musty; lovers and husbands have {{gone over the}} ground before to-day. Clare had been harsh towards her; {{there is no doubt}} of it. Men are <b>too</b> often <b>harsh</b> with women they love or have loved; women with men. And yet these harshnesses are tenderness itself when compared with the universal harshness out of which they grow; the harshness of the position towards the temperament, of the means towards the aims, of to-day towards yesterday, of hereafter towards to-day.|$|R

Miriam looks after her little brother, who’s not really the easy kind, though. Miriam is a very nice young girl and careful sister but at times she {{can be a little}} bit <b>too</b> much <b>harsh</b> with herself and the people around her.

5|$|Like most seabirds, the {{majority}} of procellariids breed once a year. There are exceptions; many individuals of the larger species, such as the white-headed petrel, will skip a breeding season after successfully fledging a chick, {{and some of the}} smaller species, such as the Christmas shearwaters, breed on a nine-month schedule. Among those that breed annually, there is considerable variation as to the timing; some species breed in a fixed season while others breed all year round. Climate and the availability of food resources are important influences on the timing of procellariid breeding; species that breed at higher latitudes always breed in the summer as conditions are <b>too</b> <b>harsh</b> in the winter. At lower latitudes many, but not all, species breed continuously. Some species breed seasonally, to avoid competition with other species for burrows, to avoid predation or to take advantage of seasonally abundant food. Others, such as the tropical wedge-tailed shearwater, breed seasonally for reasons unknown. Among the species that exhibit seasonal breeding there can be high levels of synchronization, both of time of arrival at the colony and of lay date.|$|E
5|$|The {{regional}} specialties {{that are}} a feature of early modern and contemporary cuisine were not in evidence in the sparser documentation that survives. Instead, medieval cuisine can be differentiated by the cereals and the oils that shaped dietary norms and crossed ethnic and, later, national boundaries. Geographical variation in eating was primarily the result of differences in climate, political administration, and local customs that varied across the continent. Though sweeping generalizations should be avoided, more or less distinct areas where certain foodstuffs dominated can be discerned. In the British Isles, northern France, the Low Countries, the northern German-speaking areas, Scandinavia and the Baltic, the climate was generally <b>too</b> <b>harsh</b> for the cultivation of grapes and olives. In the south, wine was the common drink for both rich and poor alike (though the commoner usually {{had to settle for}} cheap second pressing wine) while beer was the commoner's drink in the north and wine an expensive import. Citrus fruits (though not the kinds most common today) and pomegranates were common around the Mediterranean. Dried figs and dates were available in the north, but were used rather sparingly in cooking.|$|E
5|$|On 5 November 1827 Antoinette von Leykam became Metternich's second wife. She {{was only}} twenty, and their marriage, a small affair at Hetzendorf (a village just outside Vienna), drew {{considerable}} criticism. Antoinette's grace and charm soon won over Viennese society. The same day British, Russian and French forces destroyed the Ottoman fleet at the Battle of Navarino. Metternich worried that further intervention would topple the Ottoman Empire, upsetting the balance so carefully created in 1815. To his relief the new British Prime Minister Wellington and his cabinet were equally fearful of giving Russia {{the upper hand}} in the Balkans. After another round of his proposals for congresses was rejected, Metternich stood back from the Eastern Question, watching as the Treaty of Adrianople was signed in September 1829. Though he publicly criticised it for being <b>too</b> <b>harsh</b> on Turkey, privately he was satisfied with its leniency and promise of Greek autonomy, making it a buffer against Russian expansion rather than a Russian satellite state. Metternich's private life was filled with grief. In November 1828 his mother died, and in January 1829 Antoinette died, five days after giving birth to their son, Richard von Metternich. After fighting tuberculosis for many months, Metternich's son Viktor, then a junior diplomat, died on 30 November 1829. Consequently, he spent Christmas alone and depressed, worried by the draconian methods of some of his fellow conservatives and by the renewed march of liberalism.|$|E
50|$|The Mahalwari {{system of}} land revenue worked under {{the scheme of}} 1833 was {{completed}} under the administration of James Thompson. The 66% rental demanded proved very <b>harsh,</b> <b>too.</b> In the Saharanpur Rules of 1855, it was revised to 50% by Lord Dalhousie. However, the British officers hardly cared of these rules. This created widespread discontent among the Indians.|$|R

60|$|But how, {{it may be}} asked, {{seeing that}} {{there must have been}} a shrill piping of birds and brawling of water among the stones, how could Mademoiselle's {{delicate}} ear endure that racket? Perhaps it is because the birds being loose in the hollow of space, it carried away into its vacancy their cries. It is, <b>too,</b> the <b>harsh,</b> rather than the shrill, that frets me. As for the noise of the water, it was so full and limpid, yet made up of such infinitely entangled chimings and drummings, that it would lull me into a kind of trance, until to a strange eye I must have appeared like a lifeless waxen mammet on my stone.|$|R

5000|$|Several {{reviews in}} the UK media noted that, {{with a few}} exceptions, the {{performances}} and material were not of the highest calibre and did not compare {{to the quality of}} the original shows from the late 1970s and early 1980s. The critical comments were tempered by references to the fact that the event was held for a good cause - e.g. the respected Chortle.co.uk website stated: [...] "a charity gig is much like the infants’ Nativity play, successful in its own terms and not deserving of <b>too</b> much <b>harsh</b> scrutiny." [...] (The contrast was perhaps made vivid by the airing on Channel Four of the film of the 1981 show The Secret Policeman's Other Ball just a few days before the new show.) ...|$|R
40|$|My {{intention}} in {{this paper}} is to reframe the practice of veiling as an embodied practice of self-development and self- transformation. I argue that practices like these cannot be handled by the choice/chance distinction relied on by those who would restrict religious minority accommodations. Embodied self- transformation necessarily means a change in personal identity and this means the religious believer cannot know if they will need religious accommodation when they begin their journey of piety. Even some luck egalitarians would find leaning exclusively on preference and choice to find who should be burdened with paying the full costs of certain choices in one’s life <b>too</b> morally <b>harsh</b> to be justifiable. I end by briefly illustrating an alternative way to think about religious accommodation that does not rely on the choice/chance distinction...|$|R

5000|$|Richland Balsam's upper {{elevations}} (above approximately 5,500 feet) {{support part}} of one of just ten stands of Southern Appalachian spruce-fir forest. This forest type consists of two dominant tree types - [...] the red spruce and the Fraser fir - [...] commonly called the [...] "he-balsam" [...] and [...] "she-balsam" [...] respectively, although the latter has been decimated in recent decades by the balsam woolly adelgid infestation. Spruce-fir forests are found in the highest elevations of Southern Appalachia due their ability to survive in climates that are <b>too</b> cold and <b>harsh</b> for the hardwood forests which dominate lower elevations. Southern spruce-fir ecosystems resemble ecosystems more commonly found in the northern United States and Canada than in the Southeastern United States.|$|R
25|$|The {{imposing}} north-eastern cliffs, riven by gullies, rise some 600ft {{from the}} Esk Hause path.

To {{the west of the}} cliffs a ridge descends more gradually {{in the general direction of}} Sty Head. This is known as The Band, and it <b>too</b> sports a <b>harsh</b> gash across its features. On the western side of The Band is the deep ravine of Skew Gill, a tributary of Wasdale-bound Lingmell Beck. At the base of The Band the ridge continues as the complex top of Seathwaite Fell, replete with numerous tarns.
