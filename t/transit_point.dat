40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on the {{optimised}} design of a distribution network taking into account the variability of the final customer demand. In particular we study the design of a one-to-many distribution system, considering the product flows from the hub to the different <b>transit</b> <b>points,</b> as well as the reverse flows. The optimization procedure consists of two main steps: the first step is the determination {{of the total number of}} the <b>transit</b> <b>points</b> and the second step is the positioning, within the considered regions, of the different <b>transit</b> <b>points</b> with respect to the position of the main hub. The fluctuating demand over the different regions modifies the optimal solution at the different evaluation times. The goal is the definition of the network configuration that minimizes the total costs considering the uncertainty of the customer demand. We have identified two possible strategies to face such uncertainty: a robust and a stable, where the former produces the minimum expected total cost while the latter determines the minimum variability of the different cost components over the different scenarios. The problem has been inspired by a real industrial case in the food distribution sector that has been reported to show the applicability of the proposed model...|$|R
40|$|This article {{sets out}} the main {{findings}} of the research project Documenting the Humanitarian Migration Crisis in the Mediterranean, which maps migration trajectories and <b>transit</b> <b>points</b> across Europe {{in order to develop}} a humanitarian response to the Mediterranean migration ‘crisis’. On their long journeys, people seeking refuge in Europe pass through various places of transit, both informal spaces such as railways stations, parks and makeshift camps, and institutionalised spaces such as reception centres, detention centres and hotspots. The focus on <b>transit</b> <b>points</b> helps to understand migrants as subjects rather than objects and journeys as fractured and complex movements rather than linear routes from A to B. In addition, it sheds light on the effects of migration management policies on people on the move and puts forward a set of recommendations to EU policy-makers...|$|R
