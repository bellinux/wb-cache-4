40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{planning}} of transport infrastructure requires as one ingredient sets of forecasts of transport demand. One {{of the factors}} that influences transport demand is the composition of the population in terms of person types, with considerable variation in trip making and trip distances between persons by age, sex, economic position, car availability and income (Siu et a 1 1994). Normally, attention is paid to the way trip rates for each person category are changing as a result of income or car availability changes. However; the irge and sex structure of the population is also changing and may have influence on future trip making. Also of potential importance is the redistribution of the population over time, predominantly in the direction of lower density areas, which can have very different model mixes from higher density areas. This paper describes work that attempts to link conventional category analysis based trip forecasting with knowledge of the changing demographic and geographic make-up of the British population. This should, in principle, be an easy task. Trip rates and <b>trip</b> <b>mileages</b> can be computed from one or more National Travel Surveys (NTS) for a highly diagnostic person classification. These trip rates are then trended or a scenario developed, and the forecast <b>trip</b> rates or <b>mileages</b> applied to the forecast population in each category to yield forecasts of the number of trips to be expected in the future, under the assumptions used in the two component forecasts. The 1985 / 86 NTS dataset is used in this study. (CONTINUES [...] ) ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractRoad freight {{transport}} {{in urban areas}} is growing regarding number of <b>trips</b> and <b>mileage.</b> Main reasons are the decreasing consignment sizes and increasing frequencies of delivery transports which are caused by individualisation of demand (incl. e-Commerce, home delivery) and the reduction of storage in central urban areas.

Supers had four of the new round VentiPorts per fender this year, with additional series script found on rear quarters and within the deck emblem. The side Sweepspear was unchanged from 1954. The larger bodied Buicks were readily identified by their more rounded contours, straight up windshield pillars and sedan rear quarter windows. Series 50 Super and 70 Roadmaster headlamp bezels also housed parking lights. Inside, a new Red Liner speedometer lay horizontally across the instrument panel. Interiors were trimmed in nylon/Cordaveen combinations, except for the convertible which featured leather seats.

But while the Rally is a monitored event, the riders of other events must monitor themselves. An example is the Saddle Sore 1000, where thorough documentation of the ride must be made, by collecting time-stamped gas and business receipts along the way, and by keeping a <b>trip</b> log recording <b>mileage</b> and location.

5000|$|The major {{category}} {{of greenhouse gas}} emissions resulting from human activities is carbon dioxide. Several other primary gases also include methane, nitrous oxide, sulfur hexafluoride, perfluorocarbons, and hydrofluorocarbons. Greenhouse gas sources resulting from project construction activities are typically generated from transportation of materials to the project site and petrol based equipment used during construction of the project itself. Stationary sources emit greenhouse gases from a single point source such as a smoke stack. Stationary source examples include coal- or gas-fired power plants, incinerators, refineries, bakeries, or chemical plants. Projects that are not stationary sources such as residential and commercial developments, schools, and related infrastructure can also contribute to increases in greenhouse gases. These projects emit greenhouse gases from sources such as vehicle <b>mileage</b> <b>trips</b> to site, energy to run the facility, and landscape maintenance equipment. Land use conversion can reduce vegetation sequestration of carbon dioxide.|$|R
40|$|Drilling mud waste, the {{by-product}} {{that generates}} from Drilling operation, {{should be treated}} to comply with GOI (Government of Indonesia) regulations. An oil and gas field in Sumatera Island operated by PT. X produced about 50, 000 bbls water base mud per month, but the centralized mud treating facility (CMTF) was designed only to treat 30, 000 bbls per month. Besides,transportation using vacuum truck is required to carry the waste from site to CMTF that creates potential of motor vehicle accidents while traveling. Using lean sigma framework with DMAIC methodology, a business case study was developed to find alternatives on how to manage the waste while also improving safety performance. We started with a pilot project, which is done very successfully, and then continuing with a full-scale implementation in the North area. Five (5) mobile (On Site Waste Treatment) OWT units with two (2) different technologies; electro-coagulation and advanced oxidation; are being operated to process drilling waste from the ground pit either while the rig is on location or after it is released. Each mobile OWT has capacity of 24, 000 barrels/month. The effluent is regularly checked in the laboratory to ensure the output meets GOI regulations before release to environment. Implementing this Mobile OWT initiative has delivered added value to the Company of about US 375, 000 over a nine (9) month period and improved HES compliance by reducing <b>trips</b> and <b>mileage</b> which in the end will reduce Motor Vehicle Crash (MVC) potential, especially when driving at night in our drilling waste operations.

40|$|During {{the last}} year {{eco-friendly}} driving {{and the development of}} new driver assistance systems that support eco-friendly driving are increasingly becoming important. One main objective of research in this area is finding ways of motivating drivers to behave ecologically beneficially in a sustainable way and identifying how these motives can be generated, for example, through in-vehicle assistance or information systems. One aim of the following study was to develop a matrix of the most important eco-friendly driving motives, moderating and influencing factors (e. g. <b>trip</b> purpose, annual <b>mileage).</b> Another objective was analysis of the influence of different driver characteristics on relevant motives and to deduce first hints for development of applications for generating these motives. The results of the questionnaire study demonstrate that three main motives ‘time’, ‘environment/consumption’ and ‘possibilities to change’ are selectively important and distinctive for various driver groups. The results therefore imply that different strategies and applications or systems might be necessary to change the driver behaviour and to convince them that the ‘eco-system’ will be beneficial for them. Furthermore, the results describe ideas of what kind of assistance or information systems the drivers would prefer as a support system. This information can help in the design of future eco-driving support systems. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{flexible}} mini-shuttle like transportation system called flexi, with routes formed by analyzing passenger trip {{data from a}} large set of taxi trajectories. The usage of public transportation is declining as often it no longer matches with individual needs. Thus, the flexi system provides a transportation mode in between buses and taxis so that inconvenience in switching to the system can be minimized overall. To generate flexi routes, we propose a two-phase approach. In the first phase, a fast diameter-constrained agglomerative clustering algorithm is developed and applied to the set of trips derived from the GPS data. This phase identifies a set of heavily traveled spatio-temporal trip clusters called hot lines. In the second phase, a directed acyclic graph is constructed from the hot lines. Then, an optimal single flexi route discovery algorithm on graph searching is proposed. Multiple routes are discovered by iteratively applying the single routing algorithm.

40|$|The {{quality of}} public {{transportation}} services {{is one of the}} most important performance indicators of modern urban policies for both planning and implementation aspects. Therefore, along with the size of the city, the significance of appropriate cost evaluation and optimization of all related transportation activities increases as well. One of the most important cost factors for the public transport agencies is naturally the fuel consumption of the vehicles. In this study, the attention is focused on the metropolitan bus transport service. The specific aim is to minimize a significant portion of total fuel utilization that occurs due to the so called deadhead <b>trip</b> or dead <b>mileage,</b> which is defined as the idle distance covered by the vehicle between the garage and the route terminal stops without carrying any passengers. In this study, the results of four mathematical models for minimizing the total deadhead trip distance covered in city bus services of Izmir are presented. The models vary due to the inclusion of garage capacity restrictions or operator distinction for supporting both operational and strategical decisions. All models are applied to the recent bus schedule data, which consist of 293 routes, 1, 424 buses and 10 garages, for obtaining the optimal route bus-garage allocations and garage capacities. The results of the Decentralized-Capacitated model, which is appropriate for quick implementation, promise a 7. 8 % reduction in total dead mileage. While on the other hand, if all garage capacities can be expanded and the bus service is maintained only by one operator as modelled in the Centralized-Uncapacitated case, even a 31. 4 % improvement is possible in the long term. The environmental gains as well as the financial benefits to be achieved when the solutions are actually implemented, justify the practical contribution of the study...|$|R
40|$|The idea of livable {{communities}} {{suggests that}} people should {{have the option to}} utilize non-motorized travel (NMT), specifically walking and bicycling, to conduct their daily tasks. Forecasting personal travel by walk and bike is necessary as part of regional transportation planning, and requires fine detail not only about individual travel, but also on transportation and neighborhood infrastructure. In an attempt to characterize the 'market' potential for NMT, the Office of Planning, Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) funded the Center for Transportation Analysis (CTA) of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to conduct a study. The objectives of this effort were to identify factors that influence communities to walk and bike and to examine why, or why not, travelers walk and bike in their communities. This study relied on information collected under the 2009 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) as the major source of data, and was supplemented with data from the American Community Survey (ACS), educational survey, health, employment, and others. Initial statistical screening methods were applied to sort through over 400 potential predictor variables, and examined with various measures (e. g., walk trip per person, walk mileage per person, bike trip per person, bike mileage per person) as the dependent variables. The best geographic level of detail used in the modeling for this study was determined to be the Census block group level for walking and Census tract level for biking. The need for additional supplemental private data (i. e., Walk Scores and Nielsen employment data), and geospatial information that reflects land use and physical environments, became evident after an examination of findings from the initial screening models. To be feasible, in terms of costs and time, the geographic scale of the study region was scaled down to nine selected NHTS add-on regions. These regions were chosen based on various criteria including transit availability, population size, and a mix of geographic locations across the nation. Given the similarities in modeling results from walk <b>trips</b> and walk <b>mileages,</b> additional modeling efforts conducted under the later part of this study were focused on walk trips per person. Bike models were limited only with the stepwise logistic models using Census tracts in the selected regions. Due to NHTS sampling limitations, only about 12 % of these tracts have bike trips recorded from NHTS sampled households. The modeling with NHTS bike data proved to be more challenging and time consuming than what was anticipated. Along with the late arrival of Nielsen employment data, the project team had to limit the modeling effort to focus on walking. Therefore, the final modeling and discriminant analysis was conducted only for walking trips...|$|R
40|$|Ein Großteil des Verkehrsaufkommens und der Verkehrsleistung ist allein dem Freizeitverkehr zuzuordnen. Der Forschungsstand in der Modellierung des Freizeitverkehrs ist allerdings weniger fortgeschritten als in der Modellierung des Pendlerverkehrs. Dies ist unter Anderem dadurch zu begründen, dass der Freizeitverkehr eine sehr heterogenes Segment darstellt und die Datengrundlage deutlich geringer ist. Studien zu Freizeitaktivitäten legen nahe, dass Freizeitaktivitäten nicht allein durch den Zweck der Erholung oder Unterhaltung motiviert sind, sondern auch durch das Bedürfnis des physischen Kontakts zu Personen aus dem sozialen Netzwerk motiviert sind. In der Verkehrswissenschaft stellt die Rolle sozialer Netzwerke einen Themenkomplex dar, der immer mehr an Bedeutung gewinnt. Diese Dissertation leistet einen Beitrag zu diesem Forschungsthema, in dem sie die Frage beantwortet, in wie weit das soziale Netzwerk für die Modellierung des Freizeitverkehrs {{relevant}} ist. Zu diesem Zweck werden drei Arbeitspakete behandelt: (i) Analyse eines sozialen Netzwerks von Freizeitkontakten, (ii) Modellierung und Simulation eines räumlich eingebetteten sozialen Netzwerks und (iii) Modellierung und Simulation eines Ortswahlmodell für Freizeitaktivitäten unter Einbeziehung eines sozialen Netzwerks. Das erste Arbeitspaket basiert auf einem sozialen Netzwerk von Freizeitkontakten, welches in der Schweiz zwischen 2009 und 2011 erhoben wurde. Dieses Netzwerk wird insbesondere hinsichtlich seiner räumlichen Struktur untersucht. Ein wesentliches Ergebnis dieser Untersuchung ist, dass die Wahrscheinlichkeit eine Person in Distanz als sozialen Kontakt zu akzeptieren mit dem Potenzgesetz ~ d^− 1. 4 skaliert. Auf Grundlage weiterer Beobachtungen wird die Hypothese aufgestellt, dass die Topologie des Netzwerks unabhängig von der räumlichen Struktur ist. Obige Hypothese wird durch Simulationsstudien zweier Netzwerkmodelle unterstützt. In einem naiven Modell wird nur die Wahrscheinlichkeit eine Person in einer gegebenen Distanz zu akzeptieren vorgegeben, woraus sich dann die Topologie und die räumliche Struktur des Netzwerks ergeben. In einem Verbundmodell wird der Prozess welcher die Topologie beschreibt und jener der die räumliche Struktur beschreibt in zwei unabhängigen Schritten modelliert. Simulationsergebnisse des naiven Modells zeigen eine deutliche Korrelation zwischen Topologie und räumlicher Struktur, welche jedoch nicht in den empirischen Daten identifiziert werden kann. Dagegen kann das Verbundmodell die empirischen Beobachtungen hinsichtlich Topologie, räumlicher Struktur und Korrelation beider Aspekte korrekt reproduzieren. Dies ist ein Indiz dafür, dass die Topologie und die räumliche Struktur eines sozialen Netzwerks aus zwei weitgehend unabhängigen Prozessen resultieren. Im letzten Arbeitspaket werden zwei Simulationsmodelle zur Ortswahl im Freizeitverkehr gegenüber gestellt. Die Modelle unterscheiden sich dahingehend, dass im ersten Modell Entscheidungsprozesse unabhängig ablaufen während im zweiten Modell Entscheidungsprozesse kooperativ ablaufen. Wer mit wem kooperiert wird durch das soziale Netzwerk bestimmt. Beschränkt man die Analyse auf eine makroskopische Betrachtung, d. h. auf die Distanzverteilungen und Zeitstruktur, so können beide Modelle so kalibriert werden, dass sie die empirischen Beobachtungen reproduzieren. Hinsichtlich einer mikroskopischen Analyse ist das zweite (kooperative) Modell dem ersten Modell in seiner Erklärungskraft deutlich überlegen. Zusammengefasst ist die Beantwortung der Frage nach der Relevanz sozialer Netzwerke in der Modellierung des Freizeitverkehrs zweigeteilt: Einerseits kann ein Modell ohne soziale Netzwerke hinsichtlich einer makroskopischen Betrachtung so kalibriert werden, dass es die gleichen Resultate wie ein Modell mit sozialen Netzwerken liefert. Andererseits repräsentiert es somit nur eine statistische Approximation mit vergleichsweise limitierter verhaltenstechnischer Grundlage. Dies stellt die Prognosefähigkeit des Modells in Frage. Ein Modell mit Berücksichtigung sozialer Netzwerke bietet dagegen eine plausible und intuitive verhaltenstechnische Grundlage, welche auch mikroskopische Prozesse erklären kann. Leisure travel {{represents the}} dominating travel segment {{with respect to}} number of <b>trips</b> and <b>mileage.</b> In Germany, about one third of trips is related to leisure travel. Models for the forecasting of travel demand, however, usually focus on commuter travel and treat leisure travel, if at all, as a homogeneous travel segment, which {{is assumed to be}} similar to commuter travel. Yet, studies on leisure activities show that they differ considerably from other activities, especially with respect to distances travelled and activity duration, and generally feature more heterogeneity. Leisure activities are not only for the purpose of recreation and entertainment but also do meet friends and acquaintances. For instance, going to a restaurant is not only motivated by the necessity to get something to eat, it is also, if not predominantly, motivated by the need to socialise with other people. Thus, {{it is not only the}} question of "where", "when", and "what" but also of "with whom". The answer to the question of "with whom" is given by the social network. The role of social networks represents a subject that gains increasing attention in transport research. This dissertation contributes to this research field by answering the question to what extend social networks are relevant for the modelling of leisure travel demand. For that purpose, three work packages are treated: 1. Analysis of a social network of leisure contacts. 2. Modelling and Simulation of a spatially embedded social network. 3. Modelling and Simulation of a location choice model for leisure activities that accounts for a social network. The first work package is based on a social network of leisure contacts surveyed between 2009 and 2011 in Switzerland. This network is analysed with special focus on its spatial structure. A key finding of the analysis is that the probability to accept a person in distance d as a social contact scales with the power-law ~d^- 1. 4. This law holds for the entire distance scale and is independent from the location of the decision maker. Based on further observations, the hypothesis is proposed that the topology is independent from the spatial structure of the network. For instance, the number of contacts per person does not depend on the location and is thus independent from the accessibility of other contact opportunities. The above hypothesis is supported by simulation experiments with two network models. In a naive model, only the probability with which a person in distance d is accepted is given from which then the topology and spatial structure of the network emerges. In a composite model, the processes that governs the topology and the one that governs the spatial structure are modelled as two independent steps. Simulation results of the naive model show a strong correlation between topology and spatial structure, which, however, is not identified in the empirical data. To the contrary, the composite model reflects the empirical observations with respect to topology, spatial structure, and correlations between both aspects. This indicates that the topology and the spatial structure of a social network result from two almost independent processes. In the last work package, two location choice models for leisure activities are compared. In the reference model, the decision making process is modelled as independent from other actors. In the cooperative model, actors are organised in activity groups with which they conduct joint activities. The composition of activity groups is defined by the social network. In the reference model, trip distances are controlled by the marginal utility of performing an activity. In the cooperative model, trip distances can be additionally controlled by an extra utility the actors gain for joint activities. Restricting the analysis to a macroscopic perspective, that is, to trip distance distributions and activity timing, both models can be calibrated so that they both reflect the empirical observations. With respect to a microscopic perspective, the cooperative model features much more explanatory power compared to the reference model. For instance, the empirical observation that if the number of activity participants increases, the average distance to the joint activity decreases, can only be reproduced by the cooperative model. In summary, the answer to the relevance of social networks in leisure travel demand models is twofold: On the one hand, a model without social networks can be calibrated so that it yields the same results as a model with social networks. On the other hand, the reference model represents just a statistical fit with a limited behavioural basis. This renders the forecasting power of the model questionable. A model that accounts for social networks, however, is based on a sound and intuitive behavioural basis and is moreover able to reflect microscopic processes...|$|R
40|$|This study {{tested the}} {{sensitivity}} of the Urban Airshed Model’s (UAM) ozone predictions to three assumptions in the motor vehicle emission calculations: trip average emission factor, average daily temperature, and uniform speed by road classification. These assumptions were tested by preparing a series of motor vehicle modeling inventories using conventional methodology, disaggregated emission factors, hourly temperature profiles, and speeds by road. These inventories were then merged with the area, point, biogenic, and nonroad mobile inventory for a 1988 ozone episode in Charlotte, North Carolina, and used in UAM simulations. Spatially and temporally allocating the disaggregated emissions to trip starts, trip ends, and <b>trip</b> <b>mileage</b> increased both the maximum gridded hourly emissions and the variability of gridded hourly emissions. VOC and CO showed a larger change than NO X. This reallocation moved emissions from major highway corridors to the central business district. Varying the temperature by hour had little effect on emissions. Assigning speeds to individual roads using output from a travel demand model decreased NO X and significantly increased VOC emissions. For this ozone episode, peak ozone changed by less than 3 ppb, but spatial ozone changes were more significant. Effect of this disaggregation methodology may be greater in other urban areas or future year scenarios with different VOC to NO X ratios. Also, the disaggregation methodology may be more important for CO calculations than for ozone...|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} a methodology and simple model for calculating the variable, per-mile costs of operating cars and trucks, {{for use in}} benefit-cost analysis of highway projects. While the marginal vehicle operating costs generated by changes to <b>trip</b> <b>mileage</b> or operating conditions are typically {{a small part of}} total project costs, they can be significant in deciding among alternative designs, construction scenarios, or project timing. Operating costs for personal vehicles (autos, pickups, SUVs, vans) are developed primarily from consumer guides, with an overall fleet average cost based on vehicle sales. Operating costs for large commercial trucks are based on a review of a number of sources of trucking costs. Factors for adjusting the costs based on stop-start conditions, pavement roughness, and inflation are derived from various sources. The results are that in a “baseline ” case of highway driving on smooth pavement, with a fuel price of $ 1. 50 per gallon, and other costs in 2003 dollars, that personal vehicles average 17. 1 cents per mile to operate, and trucks average 43. 4 cents per mile, not counting costs associated with the driver or travel time. City driving conditions, involving frequent stops and starts, increase this cost by 3. 9 cents per mile for personal vehicles and 9. 5 cents for trucks. Extremely rough pavement increases the baseline cost by 2. 7 cents for personal vehicles and 5. 5 cents for trucks...|$|E
40|$|We {{aimed to}} use the {{willingness}} to pay (WTP) method {{to calculate the cost}} of traffic injuries in Iran in 2013. We conducted a cross-sectional questionnaire-based study of 846 randomly selected road users. WTP data was collected for four scenarios for vehicle occupants, pedestrians, vehicle drivers, and motorcyclists. Final analysis was carried out using Weibull and maximum likelihood method. Mean WTP was 2, 612, 050 Iranian rials (IRR). Statistical value of life was estimated according to 20, 408 fatalities 402, 314, 106, 073, 648 IRR (US$ 13, 410, 470, 202 based on purchasing power parity at (February 27 th, 2014). Injury cost was US$ 25, 637, 870, 872 (based on 318, 802 injured people in 2013, multiple daily traffic volume of 311, and multiple daily payment of 31, 030 IRR for 250 working days). The total estimated cost of injury and death cases was 39, 048, 341, 074 $. Gross national income of Iran was, US$ 604, 300, 000, 000 in 2013 and the costs of traffic injuries constituted 6 · 46 % of gross national income.
