5|$|Despite its aims, <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> <b>was</b> {{in large}} part {{responsible}} for {{the ease with which}} the Germans could implement their policies in Belgium and was unable to moderate many German policies, such as deportation of workers to Germany (though delayed to October 1942) or the persecution of Jews. In particular, encouraging the Germans to delegate tasks to the Committee meant that the Germans were effectively using the established national civil service, which allowed much more efficient implementation than could have been achieved by force. Since Belgium was also dependent on Germany for the imports of food it needed, <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> <b>was</b> always at a disadvantage during negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Randall left {{no doubt}} about his sympathies when he {{assigned}} members to the committee, stacking it with Hayes's enemies from both parties. The committee's investigation had {{the opposite of the}} Democrats' intended effect, uncovering telegrams from Tilden's nephew, William Tilden Pelton, offering bribes to Southern Republicans in the disputed states to help Tilden claim their votes. The Pelton telegrams were in code, which <b>the</b> <b>committee</b> <b>was</b> able to decode; Republicans had also sent ciphered dispatches, but <b>the</b> <b>committee</b> <b>was</b> unable to decode them. The ensuing excitement fizzled out by June 1878 as the Congress went into recess.|$|E

5|$|A report {{published}} in 2007 by the Consultative Committee for Thermometry (CCT) to the CIPM noted that their current definition of temperature {{has proved to}} be unsatisfactory for temperatures below 20 kelvins and for temperatures above 1300 kelvins. <b>The</b> <b>committee</b> <b>was</b> of the view that the Boltzmann constant provided a better basis for temperature measurement than did the triple point of water, as it overcame these difficulties.|$|E
5|$|After the Belgian {{surrender}} on 28 May 1940, the Germans {{formed a}} Militärverwaltung (Military Administration) in the country; commanded by the German aristocrat and career soldier, General Alexander von Falkenhausen. A {{section of the}} administration called the Militärverwaltungsstab (Military Administrative Staff), commanded by SS-Gruppenführer Eggert Reeder, was reponsable for the day-to-day civil administration of the territory. The Militärverwaltungsstab would present its demands to the Secretaries-General, even though <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> <b>was</b> separate, {{in order to have}} them carried out.|$|E
5|$|In June 1940, the Government of Madras {{appointed}} a committee headed by Srinivasa Sastri to frame {{a set of}} general principles for coining words for scientific and technical terms in vernacular languages. The constitution of <b>the</b> <b>committee</b> <b>was</b> strongly condemned by the Madras Presidency Tamil Sangam and its Secretary E. M. Subramania Pillai who felt that Srinivasa Sastri was biased in favour of Sanskrit and hence, Anti-Tamil. The committee submitted its report after three months recommending the retention of the existing Sanskrit loanwords in Tamil and rejecting the need {{for them to be}} replaced. The deliberations of the Sastri Committee provoked widespread agitations in Madras Presidency. <b>The</b> <b>committee</b> <b>was</b> eventually reshuffled by Provincial Education Minister T. S. Avinashilingam Chettiar soon after the demise of Srinivasa Sastri and balanced with the introduction of more members supporting the replacement of Sanskrit loan words.|$|E

5|$|In March 1898, a {{resolution}} {{was introduced in}} Congress for a commission to erect a monument to Lafayette in Paris {{on behalf of the}} United States. The bill passed the Senate, and hearings were held before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. Chicago businessman and philanthropist Ferdinand Peck testified in support of the bill, which though favored by <b>the</b> <b>committee</b> <b>was</b> not considered by the House due to higher priorities during the Spanish–American War.|$|E
5|$|In May 1942, John Bevan {{replaced}} Stanley {{as head of}} the LCS, {{after the}} latter had asked Winston Churchill for permission to re-enter politics.

Hardboiled was sidelined by the new regime, and had been dropped entirely from the LCS programme by the end of May.|$|E
5|$|In {{search of}} someone {{willing and able}} to go to Budapest to {{organize}} a rescue program for the nation's Jews, Olsen established contact with a relief committee composed of many prominent Swedish Jews led by the Swedish Chief Rabbi Marcus Ehrenpreis to locate an appropriate person to travel to Budapest under diplomatic cover and lead the rescue operation.

5|$|Johnson {{served as}} {{chairman}} of the Committee on Claims during the Eleventh Congress (1809–1811). <b>The</b> <b>committee</b> <b>was</b> charged with adjudicating financial claims made by veterans of the Revolutionary War. He sought to influence the committee to grant the claim of Alexander Hamilton's widow to wages which Hamilton had declined when serving under George Washington. Although Hamilton was a champion of the rival Federalist Party, Johnson had compassion for Hamilton's widow; before the end of his term, he secured payment of the wages.|$|E
5|$|Since 1980, some {{reforms have}} been {{suggested}} to improve the performance of official scorers.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>committee</b> <b>was</b> {{reliant on}} public {{donations}} and realised {{that it was}} unlikely to raise a large sum of money as communities across Devon would be focusing on their own commemorations and commissioning individual war memorials. Despite this, <b>the</b> <b>committee</b> <b>was</b> determined to erect some sort of memorial to the county's war dead, and as a compromise sought a simple but elegant monument. They commissioned Lutyens in 1920 and opted for his War Cross design. The committee considered several potential sites, including Cawsand Beacon on Dartmoor and the Haldon Hills in south Devon, but the committee's preferred location was the cathedral close of Exeter, Devon's county town. The specific site was chosen so that the memorial would be visible from the High Street and Broadgate. With its remaining funds, the Devon County War Memorial Committee supported {{the construction of a}} battlefield memorial at La Ville-aux-Bois-lès-Pontavert in France to honour the 2nd Battalion of the Devonshire Regiment, who endured particularly heavy fighting at Bois des Buttes during the Third Battle of the Aisne.|$|E
5|$|Announced on 6 May 1997, {{only five}} days after that year's General Election, and officially given {{operational}} responsibility for setting interest rates in the Bank of England Act 1998, <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> <b>was</b> designed to be independent of political interference and thus to add credibility to interest rate decisions. Each member has one vote, {{for which they are}} held to account: full minutes of each meeting are published alongside the Committee's monetary policy decisions, and members are regularly called before the Treasury Select Committee, as well as speaking to wider audiences at events during the year.|$|E
5|$|Enron's audit {{committee}} was later criticized for its brief meetings that would cover {{large amounts of}} material. In one meeting on February 12, 2001, the committee met {{for an hour and}} a half. Enron's {{audit committee}} did not have the technical knowledge to question the auditors properly on accounting issues related to the company's special purpose entities. <b>The</b> <b>committee</b> <b>was</b> also unable to question the company's management due to pressures on the committee. The United States Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Governmental Affairs' report accused the board members of allowing conflicts of interest to impede their duties as monitoring the company's accounting practices. When Enron's scandal became public, the audit committee's conflicts of interest were regarded with suspicion.|$|E
