In a more recent 2004 case, Hamdi v.

25|$|However, some gay {{men such as}} Andrea Dworkin's husband John Stoltenberg {{are also}} {{critical}} of sadomasochism and pornography and agree with the radical feminist and lesbian feminist criticisms of these practices. Stoltenberg wrote that sadomasochism eroticizes both violence and powerlessness. The gay pro-feminist author Christopher N. Kendall wrote the book Gay Male Pornography: An Issue Of Sex Discrimination, advancing the idea that gay male pornography involved sex discrimination and should be banned under Canada's equality laws. He uses radical feminist theory <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> gay male pornography reinforces misogyny and homophobia.|$|E

25|$|John Hales wrote {{a speech}} to give in the House of Commons in 1563; he was a {{partisan}} of the Earl of Hertford, in right of his wife, the former Lady Catherine Grey. It {{was related to the}} efforts of Lord John Grey, Lady Catherine Grey's uncle and guardian, who tried <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> she was the royal heir at an early point in Elizabeth's reign, incurring the Queen's wrath. This manuscript brought to bear on the question the old statute De natis ultra mare. It was influential in the following debate, but the interpretation of the statute became important. It also caused a furore, and allegations of a plot. Hales could only be brought to say that he had shown a draft to John Grey, William Fleetwood, the other member of parliament for the same borough, and John Foster, who {{had been one of the}} members for Hindon. Walter Haddon called Hales's arrest and the subsequent row the Tempestas Halesiana. What Hales was doing was quite complex, using legal arguments to rule out Scottish claimants, and also relying on research abroad by Robert Beale to reopen the matter of the Hertford marriage. Francis Newdigate, who had married Anne Seymour, Duchess of Somerset, was involved in the investigation, but was not imprisoned; Hales was. He spent a year in the Fleet Prison and the Tower of London, and for the rest of his life was under house arrest.|$|E

2500|$|In 2012, Microsoft hired a {{political}} pollster named Mark Penn, whom the New York Times called [...] "famous for bulldozing" [...] his political opponents as Executive Vice-President, Advertising and Strategy. Penn created {{a series of}} negative ads targeting one of Microsoft's chief competitors, Google. The ads, called [...] "Scroogled", attempt <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> Google is [...] "screwing" [...] consumers with search results rigged to favor Google's paid advertisers, that Gmail violates the privacy of its users to place ad results related {{to the content of}} their emails and shopping results which favor Google products.

2500|$|From January to October 2005, Weld {{was chief}} {{executive}} of Decker College in Louisville, Kentucky. His term ended as the college was closing under bankruptcy protection following a disagreement with the U.S. Department of Education about accreditation of its construction-related courses and online instruction. This matter would follow Weld into the 2006 race for Governor of New York, with former U.S. Senator from New York Alfonse D'Amato asserting that Weld was responsible and oversaw [...] "multimillion dollar looting". In March 2016, the Wall Street Street Journal posted an editorial in which the newspaper expanded on a 2012 piece <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> the Department of Education's 2005 claim against Decker College was [...] "factually erroneous", with revenge against Weld as a motive.|$|E
2500|$|Commercially, {{the band}} {{was one of the}} most [...] {{successful}} rock bands of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Their first three studio albums, My Own Prison, Human Clay, and Weathered, have all gone multi-platinum in the United States, selling 6 million, 11 million, and 6 million copies respectively. The band also won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Song for the song [...] "With Arms Wide Open" [...] in 2001. However, in spite of this enormous commercial success, Creed was poorly received by professional critics, such as Robert Christgau, among others. [...] Jonah Weiner of Slate has tried <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> {{the band was}} [...] "seriously underrated," [...] "most people hate Creed’s combination of overwrought power-balladry and Christian-infused testosterone."

2500|$|Slate's Jacob Weisberg found 114 {{motorcycles}} in {{the catalog}} to be too many, and too boring for the non-motorcycle aficionado. [...] In contrast to critics like Zakaria, Perl, and Hilton Kramer, who want museums to challenge and educate the public with difficult art like abstract expressionism, which might require a little homework to learn to like, Weisberg complained that the information accompanying the motorcycle exhibits was too technical and bewildering to the non-gearhead, with talk of self-aligning bearings, compression ratios and near-hemispherical combustion chambers. [...] That is, he wrote, [...] "the approach is design-technical rather than design-aesthetic or design-cultural," [...] and thus it failed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> industrial design {{is more than just}} the [...] "stepchild of fine art" [...] and that [...] "the cross-fertilization of high and pop {{is an important part of}} the story of artistic modernism." ...|$|E

40|$|The so‐called ‘re‐identification condition’ (K elly 2011) {{has played}} an {{important}} role in the most prominent argument for nonconceptualism, the argument from fineness of grain. A number of authors have recently argued that the condition should be modified or discarded altogether, with devastating implications for the nonconceptualist (see, e. g., B rewer 2005, C huard 2006). The aim of this paper is to show that the situation is even more dire for nonconceptualists, for even if the re‐identification condition remains in its original form, the argument from fineness of grain still fails <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for nonconceptualism. <b>The</b> paper's central <b>case</b> rests on two claims: according to the first, if the re‐identification condition holds, then some beliefs will represent some properties nonconceptually; and according to the second, if some beliefs represent some properties nonconceptually, the argument from fineness of grain fails <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for nonconceptualism in any relevant sense. It follows that if the re‐identification condition holds, the argument from fineness of grain fails <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for nonconceptualism...|$|R

He said, [...] "I reveled in the sheer {{brilliance}} of how much energy and gameplay mileage Nintendo has packed into every world." [...] Otero's only complaint was that [...] "the camera becomes a slight obstacle in four-player multiplayer". GameTrailers gave the game a score of 9.5, praising its gameplay and presentation, while criticizing camera issues and some odd control choices. GamesRadar gave the game a score of 4.5/5, praising improved multiplayer and some moments so brilliant {{that they can make}} some other levels seem dull by comparison. Luke Plunkett of Kotaku called the game [...] "a terrific Mario game... just not a very good Wii U game", praising the game itself, but lamenting that it doesn't do much to show off the Wii U's capabilities. Patrick Klepek at Giant Bomb, saying [...] "World continues <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> it's possible to reinvent a classic over and over again".|$|E
2500|$|A third decimal {{representation}} {{was employed}} in a verse composition technique, later labelled Bhuta-sankhya (literally, [...] "object numbers") used by early Sanskrit authors of technical books. [...] Since many early technical works were composed in verse, numbers were often represented by {{objects in the}} natural or religious world that correspondence to them; this allowed a many-to-one correspondence for each number and made verse composition easier. [...] According to , the number 4, for example, [...] could be represented by the word [...] "Veda" [...] (since there were four of these religious texts), the number 32 by the word [...] "teeth" [...] (since a full set consists of 32), and the number 1 by [...] "moon" [...] (since {{there is only one}} moon). [...] So, Veda/teeth/moon would correspond to the decimal numeral 1324, as the convention for numbers was to enumerate their digits from right to left. [...] The earliest reference employing object numbers is a ca. 269 CE [...] Sanskrit text, Yavanajātaka (literally [...] "Greek horoscopy") of Sphujidhvaja, a versification of an earlier (ca. 150 CE) Indian prose adaptation of a lost work of Hellenistic astrology. Such use seems <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> by the mid-3rd century CE, the decimal place value system was familiar, at least to readers of astronomical and astrological texts in India.|$|E
