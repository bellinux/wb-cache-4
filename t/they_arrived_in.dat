5|$|The welcome {{extended}} by the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) was {{in contrast to}} that of Scotland. The morning <b>they</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> Belfast they were met by several IRFU officials who took them out for breakfast. The arrival in Ireland also marked a homecoming for the captain Dave Gallaher, {{who was born in}} County Donegal, but had moved to New Zealand at the age of four. Thousands awaited the All Blacks when <b>they</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> the Dublin train station. On the Thursday before the Test, both teams attended the theatre together; sitting alternatively so they could better mix.|$|E
5|$|As {{soon as the}} Persian {{survivors}} had put to sea, the Athenians marched {{as quickly}} as possible to Athens. <b>They</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> time to prevent Artaphernes from securing a landing in Athens. Seeing his opportunity lost, Artaphernes ended the year's campaign and returned to Asia.|$|E
5|$|On 21 July 1828, the {{expedition}} boarded the ship Eglé at Toulon and set sail for Egypt and <b>they</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> Alexandria on August 18. Here Champollion met with Drovetti {{who continued to}} warn about the political situation but assured Champollion that the Pasha would give his permission for {{the expedition}} to proceed. Champollion, Rosselini and Lenormant met with the Pasha on August 24, and he immediately gave his permission. However, {{after more than a}} week of waiting for the permissions, Champollion suspected that Drovetti was working against him and took a complaint to the French consulate. The complaint worked and soon the pasha provided the expedition with a large river boat. The expedition bought a small boat for five persons. Champollion named them the Isis and the Athyr after Egyptian goddesses. On September 19, <b>they</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> Cairo, where they stayed until October 1 when they left for the desert sites of Memphis, Saqqara and Giza.|$|E

In 1932, the British naval attaché reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.|$|E
5|$|The Coast Division's next {{assignment}} {{was supposed to}} be the capture of Wilmington, North Carolina. However, the failure of McClellan's Peninsular Campaign required the recall of the Coast Division to Virginia. The 21st broke their camp in New Bern and boarded schooners on July 2, 1862, while hearing conflicting rumors of McClellan's success or defeat. <b>They</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> Newport News, Virginia, on July 9.|$|E
5|$|The Nafana {{people say}} that they come from a village called Kakala in Ivory Coast. Their oral history says {{that some of their}} people are still there, and if they go back they {{will not be allowed to}} leave again. <b>They</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> the Banda area after the Ligbi people, who came from Begho (Bigu, Bighu) to the area in the early 17th century.|$|E

5|$|Archeologists {{believe the}} first humans to inhabit the Rogue River region were nomadic hunters and gatherers. Radiocarbon dating {{suggests}} that <b>they</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> southwestern Oregon at least 8,500 years ago. At least 1,500 {{years before the}} first contact with whites, the natives established permanent villages along streams. Even so, no evidence {{has been found to}} suggest that any of the native peoples, such as the Takelma who lived along the Rogue and Applegate rivers in the 19thcentury, used the cave.|$|E
5|$|Euryalus and Bacchante were {{transferred}} to Egypt in late January 1915 to reinforce the defences of the Suez Canal, although the Turkish raid on the Suez Canal had already been repulsed {{by the time that}} <b>they</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> February. Upon arrival Rear-Admiral Richard Peirse, commander of the East Indies Station, hoisted his flag in Euryalus. By this time the preliminary bombardments of the Turkish defences of the Dardanelles had already occurred, and the sisters {{were transferred}} north in March as the Turks east of the Canal proved to be reasonably quiet.|$|E
5|$|Finished in Java, Beebe and {{his crew}} sailed north from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur to begin {{exploring}} Malaya. After Malaya, the next portion of their expedition took them to Burma, where <b>they</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> Rangoon and traveled by rail to Myitkyina. In Burma Beebe succumbed temporarily to a bout of depression, and it was several days before {{he was able to}} resume working or continue the expedition. He attributed his recovery to the pile of penny dreadful novels he discovered in his bungalow at Pungatong, which he then read constantly for the next few days.|$|E

5|$|If Sheshi {{is to be}} {{equated with}} Salitis, then the seals of Sheshi {{discovered}} in Nubia suggest that the Hyksos allied themselves with the Nubians against the native Egyptian 13th Dynasty as soon as <b>they</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> the Nile Delta, an event which Grimal places c. 1720 BC. Grimal envisions Sheshi's kingdom as comprising the entire Nile Delta and the Nile valley north of Gebelein. According to Manetho as reported by Josephus in Against Apion, Salitis reigned from Memphis, and fortified the existing town of Avaris, which was to become the Hyksos' seat of power.|$|E
5|$|In August 1936 the Middletons made {{a leisurely}} drive to New York City where they boarded a ship for the Philippines. The trip took them 42 days and {{included}} {{passage through the}} Panama Canal with stops in Panama, San Francisco, Hawaii, and Guam. When <b>they</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> Hawaii, they were greeted by George Patton and his wife Bea. Patton was on duty in Honolulu and had sailed his own boat from San Diego to Hawaii, and later sailed {{it back to the}} states {{at the end of his}} tour.|$|E
5|$|In September the {{battalion}} marched {{through the city}} of Melbourne and a fortnight later they embarked upon HMT Hororata bound for the Middle East. <b>They</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> Egypt on 2 December 1914 after which they undertook further training before being called to undertake defensive duties along the Suez Canal following the failed Turkish First Suez Offensive in February 1915. However {{the battalion}} did not take part in direct combat, and during this time {{a number of the}} its non commissioned officers were allowed to apply for commissions in British Army units.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s, after Waterloo {{station was}} chosen as the British {{terminus}} for the Eurostar train service, Florent Longuepée, a municipal councillor in Paris, wrote to the British Prime Minister requesting that the station be renamed because he said it was upsetting for the French to be reminded of Napoleon's defeat when <b>they</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> London by Eurostar. There is a name counterpart in Paris: the Gare d'Austerlitz is named after the Battle of Austerlitz, one of Napoleon's greatest victories (over the Russians and Austrians).|$|E
5|$|Keogh {{became the}} star of the tour, and played in at least 60 of the side's 74 matches in the British Isles. The {{schedule}} was grueling, with their matches played in only 175 days. <b>They</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> early October 1888, and by late November the team was regularly fielding injured players due to the high rate of injuries. In December the team played two internationals, against Ireland and Wales, with Keogh appearing in both.|$|E
5|$|On 21 November, the {{battalion}} entrained for Fremantle, boarding troopships headed for Melbourne; {{it was there}} that the four battalions combined to form the 4th Brigade under the command of Colonel John Monash. After completing their basic training in Victoria, the brigade left Port Melbourne aboard Troopship A40, Ceramic on 26 December. After a brief stop at Albany, Western Australia, <b>they</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> Egypt in early February 1915. The brigade marched from Alexandria to Heliopolis as part of the New Zealand and Australian Division of Major General Alexander Godley.|$|E

5|$|On {{returning}} from his unsuccessful mission to Japan, Nuyts {{took up his}} position as the third Governor of Formosa, with his residence in Fort Zeelandia in Tayouan (modern-day Anping). One of his early aims was to force an opening for the Dutch to trade in China — something which had eluded them since <b>they</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> East Asia in the early 17th century. To further this goal, he took the Chinese trade negotiator Zheng Zhilong hostage and refused to release him until he agreed to give the Dutch trading privileges. More than thirty years later {{it was to be}} Zheng's son Koxinga who ended the reign of the Dutch on Formosa.|$|E
5|$|Ordinary {{citizens}} {{were said to}} be shocked by the emotive, evangelical tactics of the Salvation Army when <b>they</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> the town in 1880, but the reaction from those employed by the breweries or within the Licence trade quickly grew more openly hostile. Violent clashes became a regular occurrence culminating on Sunday 27 March 1881 with troops being called upon to break up the conflict after the Mayor had read the Riot Act. The riot and its causes led to questions in Parliament and a period of notoriety for the town. The town was described as 'Barbarous Basingstoke' by one London newspaper in 1882.|$|E
5|$|Pułaski next {{made her}} way to the Clyde in late October. Between 10 May and 12 June 1941, she sailed on three {{roundtrip}} trooping runs between Clyde and Iceland. In late June, Pułaski, loaded with 2,047 troops, sailed from Clyde to join convoy WS 9B headed for Freetown. The convoy arrived at its destination on 13 July. After three days, Pułaski and four other ships sailed on to Cape Town, arriving on 27 July. Leaving behind one ship at Cape Town, Pułaski and the others sailed on 30 July to their final destination of Aden, where <b>they</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> mid August.|$|E
