5|$|A delegation, {{consisting}} of {{the representatives of the}} twelve important clans of Medina, invited Muhammad to serve as chief arbitrator for the entire community; due to his status as a neutral outsider. There was fighting in Yathrib: primarily the dispute involved its Arab and Jewish inhabitants, and was estimated to have lasted for around a hundred years before 620. The recurring slaughters and disagreements over the resulting claims, especially after the Battle of Bu'ath in which all clans were involved, made it obvious to them that the tribal concept of blood-feud and {{an eye for an eye}} were no longer workable unless there was one man with authority to adjudicate in disputed cases. The delegation from Medina pledged themselves and their fellow-citizens to accept Muhammad into <b>their</b> <b>community</b> <b>and</b> physically protect him as one of themselves.|$|E

Children's learning in Indigenous-heritage communities is mainly based upon observing and helping out others in their community.

25|$|The Civitan Candy Box Project, one of Civitan's {{oldest and}} most {{successful}} fundraising programs, has raised $50,000,000 {{since its inception in}} 1976.

Volunteers collect the money, keeping some for club service projects and sending the rest to Civitan International for its charitable projects.|$|E

In the first two decades of the 20th century Italian immigrants began to make their presence felt in the South End.

25|$|It {{was later}} {{revealed}} that {{tens of thousands}} of Kirishitan still survived in some regions near Nagasaki. Some officially returned to the Roman Catholic Church. Others remained apart from the Catholic Church and have stayed as Kakure Kirishitan, retaining their own traditional beliefs and their descendants asserting that they keep their ancestors' religion. However, it became difficult for them to keep <b>their</b> <b>community</b> <b>and</b> rituals, so they have converted to Buddhism or Shinto eventually. When John Paul II visited Nagasaki in 1981, he baptized some young people from Kakure Kirishitan families, a rare occurrence.|$|E

25|$|The {{status of}} the {{indigenous}} groups in the subjugated relationship can be characterized in most instances as an effectively marginalized, isolated or minimally participative one, in comparison to majority groups or the nation-state as a whole. Their ability to influence {{and participate in the}} external policies that may exercise jurisdiction over their traditional lands and practices is very frequently limited. This situation can persist even in the case where the indigenous population outnumbers that of the other inhabitants of the region or state; the defining notion here is one of separation from decision and regulatory processes that have some, at least titular, influence over aspects of <b>their</b> <b>community</b> <b>and</b> land rights.|$|E
25|$|In 1822, the American Colonization Society began sending black {{volunteers to}} the Pepper Coast to {{establish}} a colony for freed blacks. By 1867, the ACS (and state-related chapters) had assisted in the migration of more than 13,000 blacks to Liberia. These free African-Americans and their descendants married within <b>their</b> <b>community</b> <b>and</b> came to identify as Americo-Liberians. Many were of mixed race and educated in American culture; they did not identify with the indigenous natives of the tribes they encountered. They intermarried largely within the colonial community, developing an ethnic group that had a cultural tradition infused with American notions of political republicanism and Protestant Christianity.|$|E

25|$|One {{major source}} of {{controversy}} {{in the realm of}} sex education is whether LGBT sex education should be integrated into school curricula. LGBT sex education includes safe sex practices for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals and general instruction in topics related to homosexuality. Studies have shown that many schools do not offer such education today. Eight states (Alabama, Arizona, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah) have laws in place that ban teaching LGBT sex education. Only 20% of LGBT students have heard anything positive about <b>their</b> <b>community</b> <b>and</b> they reported in a 2011 Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN) report that {{they were more likely to}} hear positive information about LGBT people from a history or social studies class rather than a health class.|$|E
25|$|Alexander Parks {{and others}} have {{identified}} libraries as potentially important safe places for LGBTQ youth and teens, especially {{in the face of}} bullying. He suggests the inclusion of LGBTQ titles in library displays or book talks to promote greater visibility. However, according to an 2005 study by Ann Curry, though many LGBTQ teens have the very similar concerns to their adult counterparts, librarians often do not answer their questions related to LGBTQ topics in a sensitive or welcoming manner. Studies by Carmichael and Greenblatt have emphasized that the library is an important place for teens who are coming out to find information because of the potential anonymity it provides. In his examination of public libraries in areas with large concentrations of same-sex families, Naidoo finds that many children's librarians are unaware of the LGBTQ families in <b>their</b> <b>community</b> <b>and</b> provide a mixed-bag of services, collections, and programs.|$|E
