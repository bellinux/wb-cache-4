500|$|Many {{waveguide}} filter components work {{by introducing}} a sudden change, a discontinuity, to the transmission {{properties of the}} waveguide. [...] Such discontinuities are equivalent to lumped impedance elements placed at that point. [...] This arises in the following way: the discontinuity causes a partial reflection of the <b>transmitted</b> <b>wave</b> back down the guide in the opposite direction, {{the ratio of the}} two being known as the reflection coefficient. [...] This is entirely analogous to a reflection on a transmission line where there is an established relationship between reflection coefficient and the impedance that caused the reflection. [...] This impedance must be reactive, that is, it must be a capacitance or an inductance. [...] It cannot be a resistance since no energy has been absorbed—it is all either transmitted onward or reflected. [...] Examples of components with this function include irises, stubs, and posts, all described later in this article under the filter types in which they occur.|$|E

2500|$|From the {{conclusions}} {{in the above}} section a left-handed material (LHM) can be defined. It is a material which exhibits simultaneous negative values for [...] permittivity, ε, and permeability, μ, in an overlapping frequency region. Since the values are derived {{from the effects of}} the composite medium system as a whole, these are defined as effective permittivity, εeff, and effective permeability, μeff. Real values are then derived to denote the value of negative index of refraction, and wave vectors. This means that in practice losses will occur for a given medium used to transmit electromagnetic radiation such as microwave, or infrared frequencies, or visible light – for example. In this instance, real values describe either the amplitude or the intensity of a <b>transmitted</b> <b>wave</b> relative to an incident wave, while ignoring the negligible loss values.|$|E

50|$|For example, {{consider}} total {{internal reflection}} in two dimensions, with the interface between the media lying on the x axis, the normal along y, and the polarization along z. One might naively expect that for angles leading to {{total internal reflection}}, the solution would consist of an incident wave and a reflected wave, with no <b>transmitted</b> <b>wave</b> at all, {{but there is no}} such solution that obeys Maxwell's equations. Maxwell's equations in a dielectric medium impose a boundary condition of continuity for the components of the fields E||, H||, Dy, and By. For the polarization considered in this example, the conditions on E|| and By are satisfied if the reflected wave has the same amplitude as the incident one, because these components of the incident and reflected waves superimpose destructively. Their Hx components, however, superimpose constructively, so there can be no solution without a non-vanishing <b>transmitted</b> <b>wave.</b> The <b>transmitted</b> <b>wave</b> cannot, however, be a sinusoidal wave, since it would then transport energy away from the boundary, but since the incident and reflected waves have equal energy, this would violate conservation of energy. We therefore conclude that the <b>transmitted</b> <b>wave</b> must be a non-vanishing solution to Maxwell's equations that is not a traveling wave, and the only such solutions in a dielectric are those that decay exponentially: evanescent waves.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{theme of}} this article is to apply a {{three-dimensional}} fully-nonlinear hydrodynamic model to simulate a solitary wave passing through a gap into a canal of expanded cross-section with a raised channel bottom. When a solitary wave impacts on an infinitely long breakwater with a gap width L 1, part of the wave energy is reflected by the breakwater and part is transmitted through the gap. Here the domain with incident and reflected waves is called Region I and that with <b>transmitted</b> <b>waves</b> in a channel of width L 2 (L 2 >=L 1) is Region II. As the bottom of Region II has an upward step, the wave is transitioned to propagate from a deep water region (normalized depth= 1) into a shallow water region (depth=D). The <b>transmitted</b> <b>waves</b> are subject to be diffracted and reflected by the confined boundaries. These diffraction and reflection effects are governed by D and L 2. For L 2 =L 1, it is similar to the case for a solitary wave climbing upon a step to generate soliton fission phenomenon. The results show that the condition of D> 0 can enhance the nonlinearity of waves while L 2 >L 1 allows the <b>transmitted</b> <b>waves</b> to expand with reduced wave height. It is noticed that part of the <b>transmitted</b> outward-propagating <b>waves</b> are reflected back from the wall boundaries to interact with longitudinal traveling waves forming a wave front oscillating transversely with nonuniform wave height across the channel.

50|$|The {{characteristic}} impedance of a transmission {{line is the}} ratio of the voltage and current of a wave travelling along the line. When the wave reaches the end of the line, in general, there will be a reflected wave which travels back along the line in the opposite direction. When this wave reaches the source, it adds to the <b>transmitted</b> <b>wave</b> and {{the ratio of the}} voltage and current at the input to the line will no longer be the {{characteristic impedance}}. This new ratio is called the input impedance. The input impedance of an infinite line is equal to the characteristic impedance since the <b>transmitted</b> <b>wave</b> is never reflected back from the end. It can be shown that an equivalent definition is: the characteristic impedance of a line is that impedance which when terminating an arbitrary length of line at its output will produce an input impedance equal to the characteristic impedance. This is so because there is no reflection on a line terminated in its own characteristic impedance.|$|E
