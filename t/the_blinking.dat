5|$|Traditionally, devices like a blink {{comparator}} {{were used}} in astronomy to detect objects in the Solar System, because these objects would move between two exposures—this involved time-consuming steps like exposing and developing photographic plates or films, and people then using a blink comparator to manually detect prospective objects. During the 1980s, the use of CCD-based cameras in telescopes {{made it possible to}} directly produce electronic images that could then be readily digitized and transferred to digital images. Because the CCD captured more light than film (about 90% versus 10% of incoming light) and <b>the</b> <b>blinking</b> could now be done at an adjustable computer screen, the surveys allowed for higher throughput. A flood of new discoveries was the result: over a thousand trans-Neptunian objects were detected between 1992 and 2006.|$|E

Shooting through BoPET film, he created multiple images which were layered over one another for the final effect (which Legato described as [...] "peculiar and bizarre"). Christmas tree lights were suspended and moved, to create <b>the</b> <b>blinking</b> effect seen on screen.|$|E
500|$|Everton {{and makeup}} {{designers}} Michael Westmore, Scott Wheeler, and Jake Garber wanted {{to upgrade the}} pasty white look the Borg had retained since The Next Generations second season, born out of a need for budget-conscious television design. [...] "I wanted it to look like they were [...] {{from the inside out}} rather than the outside in," [...] Everton said. Each Borg had a slightly different design, and Westmore designed a new one each day to make it appear that there was an army of Borg; in reality, between eight and twelve actors filled all the roles as the costumes and makeup were so expensive to produce. Background Borg were simulated by half-finished mannequins. Westmore reasoned that since the Borg had traveled the galaxy, they would have assimilated other races besides humans. In the television series, much of the Borg's faces had been covered by helmets, but for First Contact the makeup artist removed the head coverings and designed assimilated versions of familiar Star Trek aliens such as Klingons, Bolians, Romulans, Bajorans, and Cardassians. Each drone received an electronic eyepiece. <b>The</b> <b>blinking</b> lights in each eye were programmed by Westmore's son to repeat a production member's name in Morse code.|$|E

40|$|To observe narcoses and analgosedation {{it would}} be {{preferable}} to have an objective measurement for pain evaluation. <b>The</b> nociceptive <b>blink</b> reflex is possibly such an applicative measurement. It is a trigeminofacial brain-stem reflex. We investigated which electromyographic parameter shows the best correlation with subjective pain ratings. Furthermore we investigated which electromyographic parameter shows the highest accuracy and lowest variability to define <b>the</b> <b>blink</b> reflex threshold. <b>The</b> study was performed on 46 healthy subjects. We stimulated <b>the</b> nociceptive <b>blink</b> reflex in <b>the</b> innervation area of the left-sided supraorbital nerve and recorded the reflex of the left sided orbicularis oculi muscle with an EMG. Each subject received 54 electrical stimuli at nine different stimulus intensities, which corresponded to subjective pain ratings between 0 and 70 on an anchored verbal-numeric rating scale with a range from 0 till 100. Multilevel modeling was performed to determine which electromyographic blink reflex parameter showed the best correlation with subjective pain ratings. The determination of <b>the</b> individual <b>blink</b> reflex threshold was performed by using an up-down-staircase-procedure. To define <b>the</b> <b>blink</b> reflex threshold ROC analyses were performed, comparing different electromyographic <b>blink</b> reflex parameters. <b>The</b> baseline-adjusted area under the curve (baAUC) showed a good correlation with subjective pain ratings. Seventy-six percent of the residual variance of the pain ratings {{could be explained by}} this parameter. <b>The</b> <b>Blink</b> Interval peak z score showed the highest accuracy in defining <b>the</b> <b>blink</b> reflex threshold (area und the ROC-curve = 0. 95). Furthermore <b>the</b> <b>Blink</b> Interval peak z score showed the lowest variability between different data sets (2. 8 %) and an low variability between different raters (3. 9 %).

500|$|In 1987, {{astronomer}} David Jewitt, then at MIT, {{became increasingly}} puzzled by [...] "the apparent emptiness {{of the outer}} Solar System". He encouraged then-graduate student Jane Luu to aid him in his endeavour to locate another object beyond Pluto's orbit, because, as he told her, [...] "If we don't, nobody will." [...] Using telescopes at the Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona and the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile, Jewitt and Luu conducted their search {{in much the same}} way as Clyde Tombaugh and Charles Kowal had, with a blink comparator. Initially, examination of each pair of plates took about eight hours, but the process was sped up with the arrival of electronic charge-coupled devices or CCDs, which, though their field of view was narrower, were not only more efficient at collecting light (they retained 90% of the light that hit them, rather than the 10% achieved by photographs) but allowed <b>the</b> <b>blinking</b> process to be done virtually, on a computer screen. Today, CCDs form the basis for most astronomical detectors. In 1988, Jewitt moved to the Institute of Astronomy at the University of Hawaii. Luu later joined him to work at the University of Hawaii's 2.24m telescope at Mauna Kea. Eventually, the field of view for CCDs had increased to 1024 by 1024 pixels, which allowed searches to be conducted far more rapidly. Finally, after five years of searching, Jewitt and Luu announced on August 30, 1992 the [...] "Discovery of the candidate Kuiper belt object" [...] Six months later, they discovered a second object in the region, (181708) 1993 FW.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE—The blink rate is {{an index}} {{which can be}} easily {{obtained}} during the clinical examination, {{but it has not}} yet been properly standardised. The present study was undertaken to collect data on the age dependent development of this index and on possible abnormalities in Parkinson's disease and dystonia.  METHODS—The <b>blink</b> rate and <b>the</b> rate of perioral movements were measured in 156 normal controls, 51 patients with Parkinson's disease, 48 patients with spasmodic torticollis, 14 patients with generalised dystonia, and 12 patients with focal hand or leg dystonias and have been correlated with the results of testing the orbicularis oculi reflex, the palmomental reflex, and the perioral reflex.  RESULTS—No age related effects were found for <b>the</b> <b>blink</b> rate and perioral movements but all the reflexes showed age dependent variations. It is sufficient to measure <b>the</b> <b>blink</b> rate for one minute, provided standardised conditions are applied. Blink rate and perioral movement rate were positively correlated in patients and controls. <b>The</b> <b>blink</b> rate was significantly increased in spasmodic torticollis and decreased in Parkinson's disease. In generalised dystonia <b>the</b> <b>blink</b> rate was increased but in hand and leg dystonia <b>the</b> <b>blink</b> rate was normal. The reflex tests did not significantly differ between the subject groups except for the orbicularis oculi reflex, which was hyperexitable in Parkinson's disease.  CONCLUSION—Measuring <b>the</b> <b>blink</b> rate can assist the diagnosis of extrapyramidal disorders as a soft sign, but is not very sensitive. The group differences found indicate a decrease of <b>the</b> <b>blink</b> rate and perioral movements in hypokinetic and an increase in hyperkinetic extrapyramidal disorders such as spasmodic torticollis and generalised dystonias. This may be of interest for future pathophysiological studies. ...|$|R

2500|$|Despite these improvements, Word 2013 {{stopped using}} ClearType. The reasons invoked are, {{in the words}} of Murray Sargent: [...] "There is a problem with ClearType: it depends {{critically}} on the color of the background pixels. This isn’t a problem if you know a priori that those pixels are white, which is usually the case for text. But the general case involves calculating what the colors should be for an arbitrary background and that takes time. Meanwhile, Word 2013 enjoys cool animations and smooth zooming. Nothing jumps any more. Even the caret (<b>the</b> <b>blinking</b> vertical line at the text insertion point) glides from one position to the next as you type. Jerking movement just isn’t considered cool any more. Well animations and zooms have to be faster than human response times in order to appear smooth. And that rules out ClearType in animated scenarios at least with present generation hardware. And in future scenarios, screens will have sufficiently high resolution that gray-scale anti-aliasing should suffice." ...|$|E
2500|$|Problems {{with the}} 10NES lockout chip {{frequently}} {{resulted in the}} console's most infamous problem: <b>the</b> <b>blinking</b> red power light, in which the system appears to turn itself on and off repeatedly because the 10NES would reset the console once per second. The lockout chip required constant communication with the chip in the game to work. Dirty, aging and bent connectors would often disrupt the communication, resulting in the blink effect. Alternatively, the console would turn on but only show a solid white, gray, or green screen. Users attempted {{to solve this problem}} by blowing air onto the cartridge connectors, inserting the cartridge just far enough to get the ZIF to lower, licking the edge connector, slapping the side of the system after inserting a cartridge, shifting the cartridge from side to side after insertion, pushing the ZIF up and down repeatedly, holding the ZIF down lower than it should have been, and cleaning the connectors with alcohol. These attempted solutions often became notable in their own right and are often remembered alongside the NES. Many of the most frequent attempts to fix this problem instead ran the risk of damaging the cartridge and/or system. [...] In 1989, Nintendo released an official NES Cleaning Kit to help users clean malfunctioning cartridges and consoles.|$|E
2500|$|The {{regulatory}} {{intent of}} OBD-I was to encourage auto manufacturers to design reliable {{emission control systems}} that remain effective for the vehicle's [...] "useful life". The Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) of OBD-I vehicles can usually be found without an expensive 'scan tool'. Each manufacturer used their own diagnostic link connector (DLC), DLC location, DTC definitions, and procedure to read the DTCs from the vehicle. DTCs from OBD-I cars are often read through <b>the</b> <b>blinking</b> patterns of the 'Check Engine Light' (CEL) or 'Service Engine Soon' (SES) light. By connecting certain pins of the diagnostic connector, the 'Check Engine' light will blink out a two-digit number that corresponds to a specific error condition. The DTCs of some OBD-I cars are interpreted in different ways, however. Cadillac (gasoline) fuel-injected vehicles are equipped with actual on-board diagnostics, providing trouble codes, actuator tests and sensor data through the new digital Electronic Climate Control display. Holding down 'Off' and 'Warmer' for several seconds activates the diagnostic mode {{without the need for}} an external scan tool. Some Honda engine computers are equipped with LEDs that light up in a specific pattern to indicate the DTC. General Motors, some 1989–1995 Ford vehicles (DCL), and some 1989–1995 Toyota/Lexus vehicles have a live sensor data stream available, however, many other OBD-I equipped vehicles do not. OBD-I vehicles have fewer DTCs available than for OBD-II equipped vehicles.|$|E
