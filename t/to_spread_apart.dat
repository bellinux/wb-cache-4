25|$|Large shield volcanoes grow {{not only}} by adding {{material}} to their flanks as erupted lava, but also by spreading laterally at their bases. As a volcano grows in size, the stress field underneath the volcano changes from compressional to extensional. A subterranean rift may develop {{at the base of}} the volcano, causing the underlying crust <b>to</b> <b>spread</b> <b>apart.</b> If the volcano rests on sediments containing mechanically weak layers (e.g., beds of water-saturated clay), detachment zones (decollements) may develop in the weak layers. The extensional stresses in the detachment zones can produce giant landslides and normal faults on the volcano's flanks, leading to the formation of a basal escarpment. Further from the volcano, these detachment zones can express themselves as a succession of overlapping, gravity driven thrust faults. This mechanism has long been cited as an explanation of the Olympus Mons aureole deposits (discussed below).|$|E
2500|$|But in {{addition}} to friction, soil derives significant shear resistance from interlocking of grains. [...] If the grains are densely packed, the grains tend <b>to</b> <b>spread</b> <b>apart</b> from {{each other as they}} are subject to shear strain. The expansion of the particle matrix due to shearing was called dilatancy by Osborne Reynolds. If one considers the energy required to shear an assembly of particles there is energy input by the shear force, T, moving a distance, x and there is also energy input by the normal force, N, as the sample expands a distance, y. [...] Due to the extra energy required for the particles to dilate against the confining pressures, dilatant soils have a greater peak strength than contractive soils. Furthermore, as dilative soil grains dilate, they become looser (their void ratio increases), and their rate of dilation decreases until they reach a critical void ratio. Contractive soils become denser as they shear, and their rate of contraction decreases until they reach a critical void ratio.|$|E

50|$|A {{deviated}} gaze {{can result}} from several complications. If the bones and skin on the face are causing the eyes <b>to</b> <b>spread</b> too far <b>apart,</b> the eyes may start moving by themselves without cooperating with each other.

50|$|Unlike the UEPs, the Y-STRs mutate {{much more}} easily, which {{allows them to}} be used to {{distinguish}} recent genealogy. But it also means that, rather than the population of descendants of a genetic event all sharing the same result, the Y-STR haplotypes are likely <b>to</b> have <b>spread</b> <b>apart,</b> <b>to</b> form a cluster of more or less similar results. Typically, this cluster will have a definite most probable center, the modal haplotype (presumably similar to the haplotype of the original founding event), and also a haplotype diversity — the degree to which it has become spread out. The further in the past the defining event occurred, and the more that subsequent population growth occurred early, the greater the haplotype diversity will be for a particular number of descendants. However, if the haplotype diversity is smaller for a particular number of descendants, this may indicate a more recent common ancestor, or a recent population expansion.|$|R

For example, raising the arms up, such as when tightrope-walking, {{is an example of}} abduction at the shoulder. When the legs are splayed at the hip, such as when doing a star jump or doing a split, the legs are abducted at the hip.|$|R
50|$|The system found wide {{adoption}} in Britain. Often, the plates were mounted on stone blocks, and sometimes without sleepers, {{but that was}} liable to cause the rails <b>to</b> <b>spread</b> <b>apart,</b> increasing the gauge. Railways of this kind were widely used in south Wales, particularly to transport limestone down to the ironworks, and then to take the iron to a canal, sometimes several miles away, which took the products to market. The rails were at first made of cast iron, typically in lengths of 3 ft, spanning between stone blocks.|$|E
50|$|The {{terminal}} web is a filamentous structure {{found at}} the apical surface of epithelial cells that possess microvilli. It is composed primarily of actin filaments stabilized by spectrin, which also anchors the terminal web to the apical cell membrane. The presence of myosin II and tropomyosin helps to explain the contractile ability of the terminal web. When contracted, the terminal web causes a decrease in diameter of {{the apex of the}} cell, causing the microvilli, which are anchored into the terminal web through their stiff actin fibers, <b>to</b> <b>spread</b> <b>apart.</b> This spreading apart of the microvilli aids cells in absorption.|$|E
5000|$|The slab gap {{hypothesis}} {{proposes that}} instead of a [...] "window", the descending slab leaves behind a [...] "gap" [...] through which the asthenospheric mantle of the former spreading zone continues to act beneath the overriding plate. This hypothesis then assumes that a crustal spreading zone is also underpinned by a corresponding asthenospheric mantle spreading zone or upwelling of warmer material. The gap is created because instead of the old subducted plate continuing to sink, it quickly melts, allowing the asthenospheric upwelling zone to act directly {{on the underside of}} the overriding plate, heating it and causing it <b>to</b> <b>spread</b> <b>apart.</b> The fast melt is because the portion of the subducted plate nearest the spreading zone is thin and still warm from its recent creation.|$|E
5000|$|These {{consist of}} three or four cams mounted on a common axle or two {{adjacent}} axles, {{in such a way that}} pulling on the shaft connected to the axle forces the cams <b>to</b> <b>spread</b> further <b>apart.</b> The SLCD is used like a syringe, by pulling the cams via a [...] "trigger" [...] (a small handle) which forces them closer, inserting it into a crack or pocket in the rock, and then releasing the trigger. The springs make the cams expand and grip the rock face securely. A climbing rope may then be attached to the end of the stem via a sling and carabiner. SLCDs are typically designed to maintain a constant camming angle with the rock to ensure that the normal force provided by the cam lobes against the rock face will supply enough friction to hold a cam in equilibrium with the rock. These devices are also known as [...] "friends" [...] for example, as they are in the UK.|$|R
40|$|Repulsive point {{processes}} arise in models where competition forces entities <b>to</b> be more <b>spread</b> <b>apart</b> than if placed independently. Simulation {{of these types}} of processes can be accomplished using dominated coupling from the past with a running time that varies as the intensity of the number of points. These algorithms usually exhibit what is called an artificial phase transition, where below a critical intensity the algorithm runs in finite expected time, but above the critical intensity the expected number of steps is infinite. Here the artificial phase transition is examined. In particular, an earlier lower bound on this artificial phase transition is improved by including a new type of term in the analysis. In addition, the results of computer experiments to locate the transition are presented. Comment: 8 pages, 1 figur...|$|R

A hydraulic cylinder mounted between two stiff plates acts <b>to</b> <b>spread</b> the plates <b>apart</b> against the borehole walls when pressured. The spreading is measured by a displacement transducer and the load is measured hydraulically. The main improvement over previous instruments is the increased stroke, which allows large deformations of the borehole. Twenty-eight pistons are used to obtain a high hydraulic efficiency, and three return pistons are also provided.

50|$|After {{the salt}} layer was {{deposited}} {{it was covered}} by a carbonate layer approximately 112 million years ago. The carbonate formation occurred due to large-scale anoxic events which created organic-rich shales.During this time the basin was hypersaline making it inhospitable for normal marine life, although {{there may have been}} a small but stable amount of input of terrestrial fresh water.The source of this freshwater as well as clastic debris was likely from the Kouilou-Niari River which is located in present day Congo.As the rift continued <b>to</b> <b>spread</b> <b>apart</b> Pangaea into the South American and African continents, the Angola Basin opened up further, allowing for better ocean circulation which balanced out the extreme hypersaline conditions to allow for life to develop in the area.Towards the end of the Cretaceous the Congo River began to fill the basin with terrigenous sediments, characterized by many turbidite deposits which replaced most of the carbonate deposits.|$|E
50|$|The {{electroscope}} {{can also}} be charged without touching it to a charged object, by electrostatic induction. If a charged object is brought near the electroscope terminal, the leaves also diverge, because the electric field of the object causes the charges in the electroscope rod to separate. Charges of the opposite polarity to the charged object are attracted to the terminal, while charges with the same polarity are repelled to the leaves, causing them to spread. If the electroscope terminal is grounded while the charged object is nearby, by touching it momentarily with a finger, the same polarity charges in the leaves drain away to ground, leaving the electroscope with a net charge of opposite polarity to the object. The leaves close because the charge is all concentrated at the terminal end. When the charged object is moved away, the charge at the terminal spreads into the leaves, causing them <b>to</b> <b>spread</b> <b>apart</b> again.|$|E

50|$|Euhelopus and Brachiosaurus {{have been}} found to be among only a few sauropods to hold their necks at a {{vertical}} angle, which would have been impossible for other sauropods. Many studies have stated that the blood pressure and energy spent would have been too great to survive, but for Euhelopus and Brachiosaurus it would have suited them better. The energy spent by pumping blood to the head would probably be too great for sauropods, but when they travel often, which has been suggested for those two genera, it would have actually saved energy. The biomechanical evidence favours an upright neck when travelling <b>to</b> <b>spread</b> <b>apart</b> resources. The study finding this conclusion also tested how much energy would have been expended when walking 100 m and standing, both with an upright neck. The approximate conclusion was that an about equal amount of energy would have been used up. Elongated cervical ribs are skeletal evidence for a strong core to support the neck and limit its movement when walking. The study supports the idea that during times of drought and famine, an upright neck was crucial for these sauropods to survive.|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} experiment {{used the}} fact that two bosons tend to arrive at two separate detectors at the same time. Morgan and Mandel used a thermal photon source to create a dim beam of photons and observed the tendency of the photons to arrive at the same time on a single detector. Both of these effects used the wave nature of light to create a correlation in arrival time - if a single photon beam is split into two beams, then the particle nature of light requires that each photon is only observed at a single detector, and so an anti-correlation was observed in 1986. Finally, bosons have a tendency to clump together, giving rise to Bose-Einstein correlations, while fermions due to the Pauli exclusion principle, tend <b>to</b> <b>spread</b> <b>apart</b> leading to Fermi-Dirac (anti)correlations. Bose-Einstein correlations have been observed between pions, kaons and photons, and Fermi-Dirac (anti)correlations between protons, neutrons and electrons.

5000|$|A {{spring-loaded}} camming device (also SLCD, cam or friend) is a {{piece of}} rock climbing or mountaineering protection equipment. It consists of two, three, or four cams mounted on a common axle or two adjacent axles, so that pulling on the axle forces the cams <b>to</b> <b>spread</b> farther <b>apart.</b> This is then attached to a sling and carabiner {{at the end of the}} stem. The SLCD is used by pulling on the [...] "trigger" [...] (a small handle) so the cams move together, then inserting it into a crack or pocket in the rock and releasing the trigger to allow the cams to expand. A pull on the rope, such as that generated by a climber falling, will cause a properly placed SLCD to convert the pulling force along the stem of the unit into outwards pressure on the rock, generating massive amounts of friction and preventing the removal of the unit from the rock. Because of the large forces which are exerted on the rock when an SLCD is fallen on, it is very important that SLCDs are only placed in solid, strong rock.|$|R

50|$|Olympus Mons is {{asymmetrical}} structurally {{as well as}} topographically. The longer, more shallow northwestern flank displays extensional features, such {{as large}} slumps and normal faults. In contrast, the volcano's steeper southeastern side has features indicating compression. They include step-like terraces in the volcano's mid-flank region (interpreted as thrust faults) {{and a number of}} wrinkle ridges located at the basal escarpment. Why opposite sides of the mountain should show different styles of deformation is puzzling. The answer may lie in understanding how large shield volcanoes grow laterally and on how variations within the substrate of the volcano affect the final shape of the mountain.Large shield volcanoes grow not only by adding material to their flanks as erupted lava, but also by spreading laterally at their bases. As a volcano grows in size, the stress field underneath the volcano changes from compressional to extensional.

40|$|The round nucleoli of chick embryo {{fibroblast}} cells, {{when exposed}} to adenosine (2 mM) or {{to a number of}} adenosine analogues, lose material and unravel {{over a period of several}} hours to become beaded strands, 20 mu M in length, termed nucleolar necklaces (NN). Light microscope observations on this process are described. Biochemical experiments have revealed that most of these analogues interfere with both messenger RNA synthesis and ribosome synthesis, causing extensive degradation of the preribosome species containing 32 S RNA although most of the preribosomes containing 18 S RNA survive. We suggest that it is the depletion from the nucleolus of the adhesive 32 S and 28 S RNA preribosomes which allows the remaining nucleolar apparatus <b>to</b> <b>spread</b> <b>apart</b> into the NN configuration. Also required for the maintenance of the NN structure is the synthesis of some ribosomal RNA (rRNA) possibly present as rRNA "feathers" on the DNA. The addition of inhibitors of rRNA synthesis such as actinomycin D to the NN-containing cells causes loss of rRNA. Then a contraction and collapse of the NN structure into small dense spheres is observed...|$|E
40|$|The insects {{with the}} longest {{proboscis}} {{in relation to}} body length are the nectar-feeding Nemestrinidae. These flies represent important pollinators of the South African flora and feature adaptations to particularly long-tubed flowers. This study examines the morphology of the extremely long and slender mouthparts of Nemestrinidae for the first time. The heavily sclerotized tubular proboscis of flies from the genus Prosoeca is highly variable in length. It measures 20 - 47 mm in length and may exceed double the body length in some individuals. Proximally the proboscis consists of the labrum-epipharynx unit, the laciniae, the hypopharynx and the labium. The distal half is composed of the prementum of the labium which solely forms the food tube. In adaptation to long-tubed and narrow flowers, the prementum is extremely elongated bearing the short apical labella that appear only to be able <b>to</b> <b>spread</b> <b>apart</b> slightly during nectar uptake. Moving the proboscis from resting position under the body to a vertical feeding position is accomplished in particular by {{the movements of the}} laciniae which function like a lever arm.
