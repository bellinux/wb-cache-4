5|$|When {{the first}} Europeans entered Indiana during the 1670s, {{the region was}} in {{the final years of}} the Beaver Wars. The French {{attempted}} to trade with the Algonquian tribes in Indiana, selling them firearms in exchange for furs. This incurred the wrath of the Iroquois, who destroyed a French outpost in Indiana in retaliation. Appalled by the Iroquois, the French continued to supply the western tribes with firearms and openly allied with the Algonquian tribes. A major battle—and {{a turning point in the}} conflict—occurred near modern South Bend when the Miami and their allies repulsed a large Iroquois force in an ambush. With the firearms they received from the French, <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> <b>were</b> evened. The war finally ended in 1701 with the Great Peace of Montreal. Both Indian confederacies were left exhausted, having suffered heavy casualties. Much of Ohio, Michigan and Indiana was left depopulated as many tribes fled west to escape the fighting.|$|E
5|$|Following a touchback, Indiana's offense {{started from}} its 20-yard line. The Hoosiers {{picked up a}} first down with two short rushes, then Dittoe {{completed}} a first-down pass to Lewis and advanced the ball into Tech territory. On his second play in Tech territory, Dittoe completed a long pass to Lewis for Indiana's first touchdown of the second half. The score cut Virginia Tech's lead to 4520, but with only 4:26 remaining in the game, <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> <b>were</b> long against Indiana challenging Tech's lead in a serious fashion. The Hoosier kickoff went out of bounds, and the Hokie offense began a drive from its 35-yard line. Virginia Tech began running out the clock, executing rushing plays and staying in bounds to maximize {{the amount of time}} run off the game clock. Tech was unable to get a first down, and the Hokie punt was returned to the Indiana 29-yard line. Indiana was stopped on three consecutive plays and appeared to be punting the ball. As they had earlier in the game, however, the Hoosiers executed a trick play, snapping the ball to linebacker Alfonzo Thurman instead of the punter. Thurman ran forward for 37yards—the Hoosiers' longest run of the game—and a first down. Despite the gain and a 15-yard pass interference penalty against Tech, Indiana was unable to score. Time ran out in the fourth quarter, and Virginia Tech earned the 4520 victory.|$|E

5|$|This simple {{philosophy}} was tested as Texas A transitioned from an all-male military college to a coeducational research university. The addition {{of women to}} the Corps presented some challenges, including one high-profile lawsuit and fierce resistance from former Corps and Band members. When women were finally admitted to the band under court order (Fall Semester, 1985); the first three women had to be housed in a separate dorm until accommodations could be made within the band dorms. Reporters were relentless and Haney finally called an open press conference with the three young ladies. The female cadets refused pictures unless their fish buddies (members of their freshman class in their unit) {{were included in the}} photos. With a band dropout rate of 33% <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> <b>were</b> against all of the female cadets succeeding, only Andrea Abat remained in the band through her senior year. Haney realized the separate living conditions were not conducive to good order and discipline and integrated the dorms, grouping females {{at one end of the}} dorm and designating one bathroom for exclusive female use.|$|E

25|$|Jonathan Trott set up Warwickshire Bears {{for a big}} total at Taunton, making 112 not out as Warwickshire eased to 278 for 5, {{also helped}} by scores in the 40s from Neil Carter, Nick Knight and Trevor Penney. Somerset Sabres scored quickly in reply, Matthew Wood {{spending}} 39 balls for his 53 before being bowled by Trott, but at 187 for 6, <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> <b>were</b> long.

25|$|The Luftwaffe, on {{the other}} hand, were able to muster a larger number (1,450) of more {{experienced}} fighter pilots. Drawing from a cadre of Spanish Civil War veterans, these pilots already had comprehensive courses in aerial gunnery and instructions in tactics suited for fighter-versus-fighter combat. Training manuals discouraged heroism, stressing the importance of attacking only when <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> <b>were</b> in the pilot's favour. Despite {{the high levels of}} experience, German fighter formations did not provide a sufficient reserve of pilots to allow for losses and leave, and the Luftwaffe was unable to produce enough pilots to prevent a decline in operational strength as the battle progressed.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} Rosecrans {{had arrived in}} Murfreesboro {{on the evening of}} December 29, the Army of Tennessee had been encamped in the area for a month.

Bragg had the advantage of the detached, but cooperating, cavalry commands under Forrest and Morgan, who raided deeply behind Union lines while Wheeler's cavalry slowed the Union forces with hit-and-run skirmishes. (Part of Rosecrans's reluctance to move from Nashville was the inexperience of his cavalry forces in comparison to their Confederate counterparts.) On December 29, Wheeler and 2,500 of his men rode completely around the Union army, destroying supply wagons and capturing reserve ammunition in Rosecrans's trains. They captured four wagon trains and 1,000 Union prisoners.|$|E

25|$|Zhu Wan's {{unauthorized}} executions of the Zoumaxi captives {{provided an}} excellent opportunity for his political enemies. On April 27, Zhu Wan was impeached for exceeding his authority since executions had to be sanctioned by the emperor. The Jiajing Emperor dismissed Zhu Wan from his post and ordered a full investigation on the matter. Seeing that <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> <b>were</b> against him, especially since his backer Xia Yan had been executed in disgrace in October last year, Zhu Wan wrote his own epitaph and committed suicide by drinking poison in January 1550. The investigation confirmed the allegations that Zhu Wan had killed the prisoners without imperial authorization, and so a posthumous death sentence was handed down. Lu Tang and Ke Qiao were also condemned to death, and the Portuguese smugglers were let off lightly, with exile as their punishment. The ordeal left Galeote Pereira, one of the Portuguese crewmen captured in Zoumaxi, very impressed by what he perceived as the impartiality of the Chinese justice system.|$|E
25|$|The {{commander}} of the East Indies station, Admiral Peter Rainier had initially assigned Lind's old command, , to escort a convoy of two East Indiamen. News of the convoy and its light escort reached Rear-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Durand Linois, who was in command of a squadron raiding merchant shipping in the area, and deciding <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> <b>were</b> favourable, decided to attempt to capture the convoy. Unbeknownst to Linois, Rainier had decided to upgrade the convoy's escort and replaced the Wilhelmina with the 50-gun , placing Lind in temporary command, as Centurions nominal commander Captain John Sprat Rainier had been taken ill. Lind took command on 9 September, but had gone ashore during a stop at Vizagapatam when Linois's forces, consisting of the 74-gun Marengo and the frigates Sémillante and Atalante appeared. Lieutenant James Robert Phillips had been left in command while Lind was on shore, and opened fire on the approaching French. As soon as Lind realised what was happening he tried {{to return to his}} ship, but the Indian boatmen refused to row him out, until the French moved further away. A brief lull in the fighting allowed Lind to return to his ship, but he found the Centurions rigging had been too badly damaged to allow him to pursue the French. Instead he anchored between the French and the merchants, placing himself between them but out of range of supporting fire from the shore batteries. He attempted to arrange for cannon to be brought to the beach to provide covering fire, but this proved to be impractical.|$|E
25|$|In {{the week}} {{leading up to}} Block B competing, Rush stated {{that he was willing}} to put his {{differences}} with El Terrible aside as he wanted to win the Parejas Increibles tournament, despite the two having developed a heated rivalry over the last number of months. The second block matches started with a battle royal to determine the order of matches. The match included Ángel de Oro, Marco Corleone, Delta, El Felino, El Hijo del Fantasma, Pólvora, Rey Escorpión and Rush with El Felino and Ángel de Oro being the last two men in the ring. In the first round the team of Stuka, Jr. and Pólvora did not get along, playing off the two of them being disqualified from the 2012 Reyes del Aire ("Kings of the Air") tournament on the February 3, 2012 Super Viernes show. The dissension made it easy for Black Warrior and Rey Escorpión to win the first match of the tournament. In other first round matches Marco Corleone and Último Guerrero defeating El Hijo del Fantasma and Misterioso, Jr. Rush and El Terrible proved that they could indeed put their differences aside for at least one night as they worked well together to defeat Delta and Ephesto. While the final first round match featured the only all-rudo team in the tournament it did not mean that El Felino and Rey Bucanero got along at all, during the match Rey Bucanero left his former La Peste Negra partner alone in the ring as he walked out of the arena. <b>The</b> <b>odds</b> <b>were</b> too hard to overcome for Felino and he fell to Ángel de Oro and Psicosis. The first match in the second round saw two members of Los Guerreros del Infierno on opposite sides as Guerreros leader Último Guerrero teamed up with Marco Corleone and Guerrero team member Rey Escorpión teamed with Black Warrior. Initially the two Guerreros members avoided each other, but when they were finally in the ring with each other the fought like they had no allegiance with each other. The closing moments of the match saw Marco Corleone pin not just Black Warrior and Rey Escorpión but also his own teammate Último Guerrero when he got in the way of Corleone's move off the top rope. Guerrero expressed his displeasure at being pinned by his own team mate after the match. If the first second round match saw allegiances put aside for the tournament, the second match saw rivalry put aside for the tournament as Rush and El Terrible once again worked better together than expected as they defeated Ángel de Oro and Psicosis to become the second team in the semifinal match. In the third and final round of the evening Rush's promise to put differences aside and win the tournament turned out to be true as the two defeated Marco Corleone and Último Guerrero to earn the second spot in the tournament finals.|$|E
