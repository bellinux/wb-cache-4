In 1818 she married a professor of medicine, August Bécu. She ran a literary salon where young Juliusz was exposed <b>to</b> <b>diverse</b> influences. It was there in 1822 that the 13-year-old met Adam Mickiewicz, the first of the Three Bards of Polish literature. Two years later, in 1824, Mickiewicz was arrested and exiled by the Russian authorities for his involvement in a secret patriotic Polish student society, the Philomaths; Słowacki likely met with him on Mickiewicz's final day in Wilno.|$|E
