40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a new energy-efficient MAC design {{to improve the}} performance of IEEE 802. 15. 4 -based wireless sensor networks. Our proposed mechanism adaptively determines <b>the</b> sleeping <b>schedules</b> of sensor nodes based on the network traffic load to achieve the balance of throughput and energy consumption. This mechanism consists of two phases: schedule exchange phase and schedule generation phase. In <b>the</b> <b>schedule</b> exchange phase, <b>the</b> <b>schedule</b> parameters are piggybacked in normal transmissions. In <b>the</b> <b>schedule</b> generation phase, sensor nodes adaptively determine <b>the</b> sleeping <b>schedule</b> from <b>the</b> <b>schedule</b> parameters. Eventually, <b>the</b> <b>schedules</b> of all sensor nodes converge to one <b>schedule.</b> <b>The</b> experimental {{results show that the}} proposed mechanism achieves sleeping schedule convergence and high energy efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a SOAP request scheduling algorithm for differentiated quality of service. <b>The</b> <b>scheduling</b> algorithm can be deployed on a Web services server or any server that processes SOAP requests. Due to the resource-intensive security processing of SOAP messages, this research implements <b>the</b> <b>scheduling</b> algorithm on a QoS security server. <b>The</b> security server <b>schedules</b> <b>the</b> requests forwarded from the Web services server {{for the security}} processing and then sends the valid requests back to the Web services server for executing the Web services. The design of <b>the</b> <b>scheduling</b> algorithm {{is derived from the}} traditional deficit round-robin <b>scheduling.</b> However, <b>the</b> <b>scheduling</b> algorithm schedules requests according to the probed CPU resource consumption of requests. In <b>the</b> evaluation, <b>the</b> <b>scheduling</b> algorithm reveals <b>the</b> service differentiation on the throughput and response time and <b>the</b> little <b>scheduling</b> overhead. <b>The</b> resource utilizations are measured to prove the security processing is much more resource-intensive than the Web services execution. ...|$|R

40|$|To {{design and}} {{implement}} a task scheduling model which predicts a schedule for a new task set without actually running a task scheduling algorithm. Generating an optimal schedule of tasks for an application is critical for obtaining high performance in a heterogeneous computing environment {{and it is a}} hard problem. This work attempts to optimize on <b>the</b> <b>scheduling</b> time by designing a task <b>scheduling</b> model. <b>The</b> task <b>scheduling</b> algorithm used in this work is based on ACO, a swarm intelligence model. The prediction is done after the training phase of the model. The model is validated by comparing <b>the</b> predicted <b>schedule</b> with <b>the</b> actual <b>schedule</b> obtained by running <b>the</b> ACO <b>scheduling</b> algorithm on <b>the</b> new task set. The parameters used for comparison are waiting time of tasks, average processor utilization and <b>the</b> <b>scheduling</b> time. <b>The</b> predicted <b>schedule</b> is comparable to <b>the</b> actual <b>schedule</b> with respect to waiting time of tasks and average processor utilization. <b>The</b> <b>scheduling</b> time is significantly reduced and the reduction in <b>the</b> <b>scheduling</b> time increases with the increase in the task set size...|$|R
