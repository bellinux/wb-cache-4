50|$|El Paso & Southwestern Railroad No. 1 is a 4-4-0 type steam locomotive, {{preserved}} in El Paso, <b>Texas.</b> The <b>engine</b> {{was built in}} 1857 by Breese, Kneeland, and Company of Jersey City, New Jersey, {{and is the only}} locomotive built by that firm still in existence.|$|R
50|$|On 31 March 1959, USAF KC-135A, 58-0002, {{entered a}} {{thunderstorm}} near Killeen, <b>Texas.</b> Two <b>engines</b> separated {{and one of}} the engines struck the tail, causing loss of control. The aircraft crashed on a hillside, killing all four crew on board. The aircraft had been delivered just six weeks before the accident.|$|R
50|$|August 12, 1969: A Navion G, {{registration}} number N2431T, was damaged during a forced landing in Plano, <b>Texas</b> when its <b>engine</b> failed shortly after departing from Air Park-Dallas. Its pilot and sole occupant was not seriously injured.|$|R

50|$|In 2010, Nemechek ran a full season, {{but only}} managed to finish one race, due to funding issues. Nemechek secured {{sponsorship}} through England Stove Works for the Daytona 500 and succeeded in qualifying, but wrecked during the race. For the fall Talladega race, sponsorship {{was provided by}} HostGator.com. They also sponsored {{the car in the}} second <b>Texas</b> race, but <b>engine</b> failure took the car out early.|$|R
50|$|The Brickley Engine is a {{patented}} {{proposal for}} the design of an internal combustion engine. One embodiment uses opposing pistons driving a central linkage mechanism which turns the crankshaft with a single connecting rod. This proposed design configuration changes the way the pistons are connected {{to each other and to}} the crankshaft, thus reducing engine friction. Additionally, by connecting the pistons to each other in a more efficient manner, it reduces the type and number of bearings on the crankshaft for further reductions in friction. Reducing the internal friction of the engine should increase the fuel efficiency of the proposed engine as compared with the current design of one connecting rod per piston. The Brickley Engine was invented by Mike Brickley, an engineer from Austin, <b>Texas.</b> The <b>engine</b> configuration has three US patents.|$|R
5000|$|Shortly {{after takeoff}} from Ellington Field {{southeast}} of Houston, <b>Texas,</b> Herod experienced <b>engine</b> failure. Although {{he could have}} ejected safely, he remained with the plane {{to ensure that it}} did not crash into the suburban homes of Houston neighborhoods. Herod initially turned his plane around in an effort to return to Ellington Field or another airport. He radioed air traffic control {{that he was going to}} bail out. When controllers asked for confirmation he replied “not yet”. These were his last words. [...] Herod stayed with his plane until it crashed into what was then a vacant field surrounded by homes. The crash site was opposite the end of Atwell Drive on the north bank of Braes Bayou.|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the methodology {{used to develop}} the high efficiency pump/motor model (M 2) for wastewater treatment and water treatment plant. It reviews the engineering equations {{that were used to}} develop the model. It also includes a detailed description of an example to illustrate the methodology. Pumping water or wastewater is the largest use of electricity for a municipal water supply or wastewater treatment plant. Increasing the overall efficiency of the pumping system can achieve significant energy savings. Overall pump system efficiency depends on the efficiency of the motor, the pump, and the design of the piping layout. The model developed in this document focuses on improvements mostly to the pumping system rather than a municipal piping system. Furthermore, this model primarily addresses electric motor-driven pumps, and does not include the pumps driven with gasoline or diesel <b>engines.</b> <b>Texas</b> Senate Bill 5; Texas Commission in Environmental Qualit...|$|R
5000|$|San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railway #60 is a 4-4-0 {{built by}} Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1923. The {{railroad}} was merged into Southern Pacific Railroad subsidiary Texas and New Orleans, who renumbered {{the engine to}} #220. Paulsen Spence eventually bought the engine for his Louisiana Eastern Railroad, and initially numbered as 2. The engine was briefly renumbered as the second #1 until 1963 when it was sold to the Stone Mountain Scenic Railroad, who had also previously bought the LE's original #1. Stone Mountain restored the engine to its original SA&AP number and named it the <b>Texas</b> II. The <b>engine</b> operated until 1983 when it came in need of boiler work and other mechanical issues, though it continued to occasionally [...] "pull" [...] the train while pushed by a diesel until 2002. Afterwards, the engine remained in the Stone Mountain rail yard until donated to the Gulf & Ohio in 2013. The engine is currently awaiting restoration.|$|R
40|$|This {{report and}} its {{appendices}} summarize {{the findings of}} a 2 -year extension to the TxDOT-sponsored study 0 - 5974 entitled “Estimating Texas Motor Vehicle Costs ” undertaken by a Center for Transportation Research (CTR) team of mechanical engineers and economists at The University of Texas at Austin. The work was conducted in two phases over a 4 -year period beginning in 2007 and this report details the second phase conducted over the period 2009 – 2011. It reports results in three areas: 1) total operating costs for the major vehicle classes currently seen on <b>Texas</b> highways, 2) <b>engine</b> models for hybrid light vehicles, and 3) results from examining the impact of transmission types through gearbox and differential sub-models. This second phase is the focus of this report but the reader interested in why this work was undertaken should peruse technical report 0 - 5974 - 1. This second, and final, report contains several detailed appendices on mechanical engineering sub-models and a product—a Vcost model and manual—for TxDOT use in highway and freight planning, economics and departmental revenue estimation. (Note: Traditionally vehicle operating costs were termed VOCs but the current use of this acronym to represent volatile organic compounds in emission studies encouraged the authors to adopt a different term—Vcost. ...|$|R
2500|$|Brooklyn headed nearly {{straight}} for Infanta Maria Teresa at first, but by 10:05 {{it was apparent}} {{they were on a}} collision course and Commodore Schley ordered a sharp turn to starboard, the so-called [...] "retrograde loop", when all of the other American ships had already turned to port. This threatened Texas with collision and Captain Philip of <b>Texas</b> ordered all <b>engines</b> back fullto, which brought Texas to a near standstill until Brooklyn passed across Texass bow. Maria Teresa and Vizcaya then altered course to the west, the Colon and Oquendo falling in behind, and the two squadrons paralleled each other. Texas then swung behind Brooklyn but Oregon then ran up on the Texas and passed inboard, masking Texass fire. Oregon, initially {{to the rear of the}} action but the fastest ship in the U.S. fleet, soon raced past Indiana, which had an engine problem and could make only [...] at the time of the battle. Iowa had started from a disadvantaged position and was passed by Infanta Maria Teresa but hit her with two [...] rounds from [...] and swung into the chase. As Iowa was passed in turn by Cristóbal Colón, the Spanish ship hit her with two shots from her secondary battery. One of these struck near the waterline and caused Iowa to slow and she therefore engaged Almirante Oquendo, bringing up the rear of Cervera's four cruisers. With the Spanish fleet past the American blockade, the battle became a chase.|$|R
