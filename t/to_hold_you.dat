According to Dylan chronicler Olof Björner and Eight Arms <b>to</b> <b>Hold</b> <b>You</b> authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter, Harrison and Dylan may have recorded the demos for this song and [...] "Nowhere to Go" [...] in Bearsville, during the original composing session in 1968. Both songs appear on bootlegs such as The Dylan Harrison Sessions and The Beatles – 20 x 4.|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, Unreal Tournament {{received}} universal acclaim from critics, earning {{an overall}} score of 92 out of 100 on aggregate review website Metacritic. Mainstream press reviews lauded the title for its graphics, gameplay, and level design. Computer and Video Games concluded [...] "Unreal Tournament {{is nothing short}} of a technical and game-playing marvel destined <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>you</b> - as it did us - wailing with happiness and wasting far too many precious hours hammering keyboards. An absolute joy to behold." [...] In March 2000, Unreal Tournament was second on a list of best-selling games in Computer Dealer News trade magazine. However, the development team believed sales would have been higher if the game was released in October 1999.|$|E

500|$|Discussing the {{reception}} to Gone Troppo {{in their book}} Eight Arms <b>to</b> <b>Hold</b> <b>You,</b> Chip Madinger and Mark Easter note [...] "Circles" [...] as the only track [...] "reflecting weightier matters" [...] on what was otherwise Harrison's [...] "frothiest" [...] collection of songs to date, and they conclude: [...] "Sadly, a decent album {{was lost in the}} shuffle of the rapidly changing marketplace of the early '80's." [...] In a contemporary review for Musician magazine, Roy Trakin found that, following John Lennon's murder two years before, Harrison's [...] "tortured honesty" [...] undermined the album's [...] "attempt to heal those psychic wounds with calm, offhanded music", and he added that [...] "not even Billy Preston can rescue … the maudlin tautologies of the closing 'Circles'." ...|$|E
500|$|Harrison and co-producer Phil Spector {{began working}} on the Bangladesh {{recordings}} on 2 August, and work continued there at the Record Plant for around a week. Spector later talked of them spending [...] "six months" [...] mixing {{what amounted to a}} total of four hours of music; in fact, the process took just over a month, as Harrison told talk-show host Dick Cavett that November. In their book Eight Arms <b>to</b> <b>Hold</b> <b>You,</b> Chip Madinger and Mark Easter question the extent of Spector's involvement, citing Harrison's subsequent lauding of Kellgren's role in [...] "capturing the performances" [...] on 1 August, as well as the fact that Spector was [...] "in and out of hospital" [...] during this time, similar to his erratic attendance at the All Things Must Pass sessions in 1970.|$|E
500|$|Outside of {{the daytime}} rehearsals, Harrison {{finished}} off the songs hastily recorded in England, and mixed the album. Horn and Findley overdubbed flutes, and Richards wobble board onto [...] "It Is 'He'". Eight Arms <b>to</b> <b>Hold</b> <b>You</b> authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter suggest {{that much of}} the vocals on Dark Horse were taped at this point – a situation that resulted in Harrison overworking and then blowing his voice {{in the middle of the}} tour rehearsals. He was diagnosed with laryngitis. According to Scott, Harrison recorded [...] "Bye Bye, Love" [...] alone one night at A, adding a variety of instruments to his acoustic guitar track, including Moog synthesizer, drums, electric pianos and various electric-guitar parts. [...] "I Don't Care Anymore" [...] is another solo track that was most likely recorded in Los Angeles.|$|E

500|$|... "Isn't It a Pity" [...] {{remains one}} of Harrison's most popular songs with critics and fans alike. AllMusic calls it [...] "deeply moving and powerful", while in their book on the solo Beatles' {{recording}} history, Eight Arms <b>to</b> <b>Hold</b> <b>You,</b> Chip Madinger and Mark Easter declare: [...] "If any George Harrison song can be called 'majestic', 'Isn't It a Pity' would be the one." [...] In his December 1970 album review for the NME, Alan Smith {{described it as a}} track that [...] "catches the mood of aching tolerance of pain, which Harrison can do so well" [...] and [...] "a ballad which will stand out from the album with the passing of the years". While reviewing the song's pairing with [...] "My Sweet Lord", Billboard magazine wrote of a [...] "powerhouse two-sided winner" [...] with [...] "equally potent lyric lines and infectious rhythms".|$|E
500|$|In {{the same}} {{interview}} with Gross, for Circus Raves magazine, Scott recalled {{that he was}} the first Western musician that Harrison approached about joining him and Shankar for a tour of the United States and Canada later in the year. The tour would be the first in North America by a former Beatle since the group's 1966 US visit, and Harrison's first live performances since his staging of the Concert for Bangladesh in August 1971. Rather than include Beatles material on the 1974 tour, however, Harrison planned to present a varied program combining rock, soul/R, jazz, funk and Indian classical music. Eight Arms <b>to</b> <b>Hold</b> <b>You</b> authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter suggest that [...] "Hari's on Tour (Express)" [...] was written [...] "simply as a show opener" [...] for the North American concerts, which would also feature Harrison's former Apple Records protégé Billy Preston.|$|E
500|$|With its choruses {{presented}} in what Harrison biographer Elliot Huntley describes as [...] "thundering, echo-drenched crescendo", [...] "Let It Down" [...] received a hard rock arrangement that recalls {{the sound of}} Wright's former band Spooky Tooth. Like Huntley, authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter recognise the song as the most obvious example of Spector's influence on the album. In their book Eight Arms <b>to</b> <b>Hold</b> <b>You,</b> Madinger and Easter also credit the producer with [...] "creating havoc" [...] during the making of All Things Must Pass. According to Harrison's later recollections and those of Molland, Klaus Voormann and orchestral arranger John Barham, Spector's erratic behaviour and alcohol intake became a further burden on Harrison, alongside his marital problems {{and the death of}} his mother in July 1970. During a session at Apple Studio, Spector fell over and broke his arm; that and other [...] "health issues" [...] left Harrison to do much of the production work alone through to 12 August.|$|E

500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} by Alfred Publishing on Musicnotes.com, [...] "Lacrymosa" [...] {{is an alternative}} metal, gothic rock and post-grunge song set in a common time and performed in slow tempo of 48 beats per minute. Although the original Lacrimosa sequence was performed in D-minor, it was transposed into E-minor by Lee and Terry Balsamo. The instrumentation in the song is provided by piano, guitar, violins and drums. Lee's vocal range from the low note of B3 to the high note of E5; the SATB choir vocals range from the low note of B2 to the high note of E4. According to Gauntlet writer Claire Colette, [...] "Lacrymosa" [...] has a [...] "violin intro, synth worth of a Nine Inch Nails album, and Omen-esque choral sections that are very haunting." [...] It then goes on with a pinon-themed melody before the [...] "power guitar section" [...] joins in. Lyrically, the song speaks about a break-up, as illustrated in the verse [...] "And you can blame it on me / Just set your guilt free, honey / I don't want <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>you</b> back now love".|$|E
500|$|The song {{has invited}} varied {{opinions}} among Harrison and Beatles biographers. In their book Eight Arms <b>to</b> <b>Hold</b> <b>You,</b> Chip Madinger and Mark Easter dismiss the track as [...] "an inauspicious ending to a half-baked LP". Ian Inglis describes the deceleration into half-time during the verses as [...] "awkward" [...] and notes {{the failure of}} [...] "It Is 'He'" [...] next to Harrison's earlier successes with [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] and [...] "Hare Krishna Mantra". Inglis concludes: [...] "The gently floating Indian [...] are somewhat undermined by the ponderous nature of the rock-oriented interludes, and the evangelical nature of the English words – 'he who is complete' – finally discourage any attempt at participation." [...] Author Elliot Huntley describes the song as [...] "Krishna-consciousness psychobabble", with a refrain that is [...] "repeated ad nauseam". Writing in The Rough Guide to the Beatles, Chris Ingham views the track as [...] "George at his happy-clappy nadir" [...] and pairs it with [...] "Ding Dong, Ding Dong", which Harrison released as a hoped-for Christmas–New Year hit in the UK, as [...] "two of the worst songs he ever allowed out".|$|E
500|$|... "Where the Dream Takes You" [...] is a [...] "tender" [...] pop power ballad with {{contemporary}} R, soul and lite rock influences, performed {{in an urban}} contemporary style. According to the song's official sheet music, published by Walt Disney Music Publishing on Musicnotes.com, [...] "Where the Dream Takes You" [...] is set in signature common time and performed at a moderate tempo of 88 beats per minute in the key of C major. The Disney Song Encyclopedia author Thomas S. Hischak believes that the song's lyrics are [...] "about following your heart to find your true self", which begin [...] "They'll try <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>you</b> back, they will say you're wrong, but they will never understand, no, the journey that you're on." [...] A writer for Barnes & Noble agreed that, thematically, the single [...] "correlates to the film's tale of an inexperienced young adventurer", Milo Thatch, and its diverse cast of supporting characters, all of whom long to follow various dreams of their own as they search for Atlantis. One of its verses reads, [...] "There's something in your soul/That won't be denied/It's the faith to dream that keeps the dream alive/So you still believe {{and you know you}} must go", encouraging listeners to follow their dreams despite others' opinions. Lasting a duration of four minutes, AllMusic cites the song's mood as both [...] "earnest" [...] and [...] "mellow"; Mýa performs it using a [...] "sweet vocal", which spans two octaves from G3 to D♭5. Based on a melody heard only briefly during the film, [...] "Where the Dream Takes You" [...] encompasses [...] "soft, contemporary beats" [...] combined with the singer's [...] "dulcet tones" [...] that recall music played in a piano lounge, contrasting with the time period in which the film itself is set. Its production, which has been described as [...] "polished", was handled by Jay Selvester, Robbie Buchanan and Ron Fair.|$|E

2500|$|Lennon {{referred}} to [...] "Eight Days a Week" [...] in his 1980 interview with Playboy magazine as [...] "lousy". In 1972, Lennon recalled that [...] "Eight Days a Week" [...] {{might have been}} made {{with the goal of}} being the theme song for the film Help!: [...] "I think we wrote this when we were trying to write the title song for 'Help!' because there was at one time the thought of calling the film Eight Arms <b>To</b> <b>Hold</b> <b>You.</b> I think that's the story.

2500|$|Eight Arms <b>to</b> <b>Hold</b> <b>You,</b> {{which was}} {{released}} February 11, 1997 on Geffen Records, {{proved to be}} a difficult and dividing album. Some fans of American Thighs were disappointed by the polished, hard-rock and distinctively Bob Rock production, in comparison to the laid back, indie buzz-bin vibe of American Thighs. The new album garnered mixed reviews from music critics as well. Band members have since admitted that this album was difficult for the band, and the recording process was extremely tense. However, Eight Arms <b>to</b> <b>Hold</b> <b>You</b> sold well due {{to the success of the}} first single, [...] "Volcano Girls", written by Gordon. It was a catchy, power-pop tantrum that matched [...] "Seether"'s success, peaking at #8 on the Modern Rock charts. The album, however, didn't have longevity, and despite peaking higher (Billboard Top 200 at 55) than American Thighs, sales dropped off drastically when the second single, [...] "Shutterbug", failed to chart, despite a high budget video and Saturday Night Live performance, as well as other promotion. Three more singles were sent to radio ("The Morning Sad", [...] "Straight" [...] and [...] "Benjamin") but none of them did well enough to warrant a video. However, the Gordon-penned [...] "'Benjamin" [...] was released internationally as the third and last commercial single from the album despite having no video and no promotion. [...] "Benjamin" [...] also failed to chart.|$|E
2500|$|Harrison taped {{the basic}} track for [...] "Grey Cloudy Lies" [...] at A Studios in Hollywood on 24 April 1975. The line-up {{on the track}} was Harrison on {{electric}} guitar; David Foster on piano; Jesse Ed Davis on Leslie-effected guitar, played through a wah-wah pedal; Voormann on bass; and drummer Jim Keltner, another regular participant at Harrison recording sessions. In their book Eight Arms <b>to</b> <b>Hold</b> <b>You,</b> Chip Madinger and Mark Easter suggest that Foster may have added his piano part during the album's overdubbing phase, however, between 31 May and 6 June. According to author Bruce Spizer, Harrison was dissatisfied with Voormann's contribution, and so {{replaced it with a}} bass part he performed himself on Moog synthesizer. The song also features ARP synthesizer extensively, played by Harrison. Dated 23 June, the album's master-reel tracking sheet lists separate ARP horn, string and [...] "growl" [...] tracks on [...] "Grey Cloudy Lies", in addition to handclaps.|$|E

2500|$|A Records, co-founded by American {{musician}} and composer Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss in 1962, {{had a reputation}} as an [...] "artist-friendly" [...] international record company, a factor that led to George Harrison agreeing terms with A to serve as distributors for his Dark Horse Records label in May 1974. Artists such as Ravi Shankar, Splinter, Stairsteps and Attitudes had all recorded for Dark Horse before Harrison was able to sign with A as a Dark Horse act himself, following the expiration of his contract with EMI-affiliated Apple Records in January 1976. Around that time, Harrison and Alpert were working in neighbouring studios at A's recording facility on La Brea Avenue, Hollywood, when Alpert asked him to provide a song for his forthcoming solo album. Although Alpert was best known as a trumpeter through his success with the Tijuana Brass, he had a US number 1 hit in 1968 with the original version of [...] "This Guy's in Love with You", written by Burt Bacharach and lyricist Hal David. Harrison recalls in his 1980 autobiography, I, Me, Mine, that he admired Alpert's singing voice, especially on [...] "This Guy's in Love with You", and so [...] "thought I'd try and write a vocal , something with that sort of mood". According to Eight Arms <b>to</b> <b>Hold</b> <b>You</b> authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter, Harrison's working title for the new composition was [...] "Herb's Tune".|$|E
