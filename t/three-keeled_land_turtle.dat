50|$|Turtles {{are thought}} to have {{exceptional}} night vision due to the unusually large number of rod cells in their retinas. Turtles have color vision with a wealth of cone subtypes with sensitivities ranging from the near ultraviolet (UVA) to red.

5000|$|Until recently, {{there was}} very little {{scientific}} knowledge of diseases and parasites among the turtle populations; early studies showed that a genus of fly sometimes infested the legs of these turtles and caused death by starvation because their movement was impeded.

5|$|Plastromancy: The {{earliest}} use of turtle shells {{comes from}} the archaeological site in Jiahu site. The shells, containing small pebbles of various size, colour and quantity, were drilled with small holes, suggesting that each pair of them was tied together originally. Similar finds have also {{been found in the}} Dawenkou burial sites of about 4000–3000 BC, as well as in Henan, Sichuan, Jiangsu and Shaanxi. The turtle-shell shakers for the most part are made of the shell of <b>land</b> <b>turtles,</b> identified as Cuora flavomarginata. Archaeologists believe that these shells were used either as rattles in ceremonial dances, shamantic healing tools or ritual paraphernalia for divinational purposes.|$|R
5000|$|The coastal zone, {{which has}} a long beach {{extending}} to nearly 22 mi, is the nesting ground for turtles popularly known as the [...] "beach-resting turtles (tortugas)". They are found on the beaches, and also many of these species are reported from the canal banks. The main species to lay eggs {{during the winter months}} of February to July are: hawksbill, loggerheads, green, and leatherbacks. Large parts of the park have been semi-legally clearcut, giving access to the habitat of the endangered green sea turtle. Seven species of <b>Land</b> <b>turtles,</b> the manatee or sea cow, the crocodile, and a variety of crustaceans are found here, as are 30 species of freshwater fish, gar, eel and bull shark.|$|R

5000|$|Megalochelys atlas is {{the largest}} known member of Testudinidae, with a shell length of about 2.1 m, an {{estimated}} total length of 2.5 to 2.7 m, and an approximate total height of 1.8 m. Popular weight estimates for this taxon have varied greatly with the highest estimates reaching up to 4000 kg in some instances. [...] However, weights based on volumetric displacement of the skeleton, or inferences based on two-dimensional skeletal drawings, [...] indicate that M. atlas was probably closer to 952 to 1000 kg in mass. M. atlas is thus the largest known <b>land</b> <b>turtle.</b> The only larger turtles were the marine Archelon and Protostega from the Cretaceous period, and the aquatic, freshwater Stupendemys of the South American late Miocene.|$|R
25|$|Several {{variations}} of turtle racing exist. While turtle racing typically {{takes place on}} <b>land,</b> <b>turtle</b> races have occasionally occurred in pools as well. Some races begin with the turtles racing from a starting location and end when they reach a designated finish line. Outdoor races occasionally start the turtles in a sunny spot near a shaded area and the turtles by nature race into the shade. Other races begin with the turtles all being placed {{in the center of}} a large circle, the first to pass outside of the circle is deemed the winner. In some cases, a large lid is placed on top of the turtles before the race and the race begins when the lid is lifted off of them. The turtles are often distinguished by numbers painted or taped on their shells.|$|R

5000|$|Several {{sea turtles}} live along the Atlantic coast, {{including}} the hawksbill sea turtle, Kemp's ridley sea turtle, and loggerhead sea turtle. The {{green sea turtle}} and leatherback sea turtle are more common species along the southeastern coastline. <b>Land</b> <b>turtles</b> and tortoises found {{throughout most of the}} Eastern United States are the common snapping turtle, painted turtle, spotted turtle, diamondback terrapin, spiny softshell turtle, eastern mud turtle, northern red-bellied cooter, common musk turtle, eastern box turtle, and the yellow- and red-eared slider. While common species in the northeast include Blanding's turtle, wood turtle, and bog turtle, common species in the southeastern U.S. include gopher tortoise, pond slider, Escambia map turtle, Barbour's map turtle, eastern river cooter, striped mud turtle, loggerhead musk turtle, and the Florida softshell turtle.

50|$|The Calusa diet at {{settlements}} {{along the}} coast and estuaries consisted primarily of fish, in particular pinfish (Lagodon rhomboides), pigfish (redmouth grunt), (Orthopristis chrysoptera) and hardhead catfish (Ariopsis Felis).

When Pedro Menéndez de Avilés visited in 1566, the Calusa served only fish and oysters to the Spanish. An analysis of faunal remains at one coastal habitation site, the Wightman site (on Sanibel Island), showed that more than 93 percent of the energy (kilocalories) from animals in the diet came from fish and shellfish, less than 6 percent of the energy came from mammals, and less than 1 percent came from birds and reptiles. By contrast, at an inland site, Platt Island, mammals (primarily deer) {{accounted for more than}} 60 percent of the energy from animal meat, while fish provided just under 20 percent.|$|R
