25|$|After the disappointing {{performance}} of Millionaires the band chose to start anew {{in their approach}} to their next album, working with Eno once again. They spent most of 2000 recording the album; writing the songs, then performing them live before actually recording them. They embarked on a small-scale tour {{in the autumn of}} that year on which their set lists consisted almost entirely of new material. The album, Pleased <b>To</b> <b>Meet</b> <b>You,</b> was released in July 2001. The album's artwork featured a composite image of the faces of all the band members to create a new person. The album reached only number 11, the lowest position for a James studio album since their signing to Fontana.|$|E

You have a right to elect whom you please; vote for the man you think best, and I think, when that is done, that you and I are freemen. Do as you consider right and honest in electing men for office. I did not come here to make you a long speech, although invited to do so by you. I am not much of a speaker, and my business prevented me from preparing myself. I came <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>you</b> as friends, and welcome you to the white people. I want you to come nearer to us. When I can serve you I will do so. We have but one flag, one country; let us stand together. We may differ in color, but not in sentiment. Use your best judgment in selecting men for office and vote as you think right.|$|E

6000|$|Now when Sir Gaheris heard who Sir Launcelot was, he {{made great}} exclamation of amazement. [...] "Ha, Sir Launcelot!" [...] he cried, [...] "and is it thou! Often have I heard of thee and of thy prowess at arms! I have desired <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>thee</b> {{more than any}} knight in the world; but never did I think <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>thee</b> {{in such a case}} as this." [...] Therewith Sir Gaheris arose, and went to Sir Launcelot, and Sir Launcelot came to him and they met and embraced and kissed one another upon the face; and from that time forth they were as brethren together.|$|R
500|$|The group {{finale of}} [...] "Don't Stop" [...] {{received}} good grades—"A" [...] from Gonzales and [...] "B+" [...] from Benigno, {{and four of}} five stars from Berk. Kubicek found a bright spot in that Sam got to sing a solo. The performance received encomiums such as [...] "pretty great" [...] from Semigran and [...] "inspired" [...] from Futterman. The portion of an original song for the April Rhodes musical sung by April and Will, [...] "Nice <b>to</b> <b>Meet</b> <b>You,</b> Have I Slept with You?", received little commentary, though Flandez made specific mention of [...] "her operatic range, and their charismatic stage presence".|$|E
500|$|All six {{songs from}} Rumours {{covered in the}} episode were {{released}} as singles, available for digital download. Chenoweth and Morrison were featured on [...] "Dreams", McHale sang [...] "Never Going Back Again", Rivera covered [...] "Songbird", Monteith and Agron duetted on [...] "I Don't Want to Know", Michele sang [...] "Go Your Own Way", and the glee club combined on [...] "Don't Stop".

[...] "The Chain", also from Rumours, was used as backing music in the second motel stakeout scene.|$|E
500|$|The {{team found}} it {{difficult}} to fill the remaining places in the company with Asian performers, especially in the chorus. [...] Four other shows with Asian themes had opened or were in rehearsal in New York, and the demand for the few Asian actors was strong. [...] Kelly and the show's choreographer, Carol Haney, journeyed to cities across the country to seek out talent. [...] Agents were sent to other cities; in Honolulu, they found nightclub singer and native Hawaiian Ed Kenney, who would originate Wang Ta. [...] Meanwhile, in New York, the three producers were visiting dance schools. [...] An advertisement in New York Chinatown newspapers received one response. [...] No formal audition was held in San Francisco's Chinatown, and the only find was Forbidden City nightclub comedian Goro [...] "Jack" [...] Suzuki (who soon changed his name to Jack Soo), who was cast as Frankie Wing, comedian at Sammy Fong's Celestial Bar. [...] The role of Fong proved difficult to cast. [...] Initially, it was given to Larry Storch, a nightclub comic, but during the Boston tryouts, it was given to another Caucasian, Larry Blyden, who was married to Carol Haney, the show's choreographer. [...] The role of Madam Liang, Master Wang's sister-in-law, fell to Juanita Hall, a light-skinned African American who had played a Tonkinese (Vietnamese) woman, Bloody Mary, in South Pacific. Another African-American performer, Diahann Carroll, was considered for the cast but not hired. [...] Rodgers later wrote, [...] "what was important was that the actors gave the illusion of being Chinese. [...] This demonstrates one of the most wonderful things about theatre audiences. [...] People want to believe what they see on a stage, and they will gladly go along with whatever is done to achieve the desired effect. [...] Ask them to accept Ezio Pinza as a Frenchman , Yul Brynner as Siamese and they are prepared <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>you</b> nine tenths of the way even before the curtain goes up." ...|$|E

[...] Cutler himself later responded to the episode, saying, [...] "It was cool. I thought it was funny. They can make fun of me if they want to." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 2, 1917, President Woodrow Wilson asked Congress {{to declare}} war on Germany. One week later, Theodore Roosevelt asked President Wilson for {{permission}} to lead a [...] "Rough Rider"-type regiment against the Germans in France. While Roosevelt was waiting for Wilson's answer, he got some kidding from his friend Masterson, who wrote Roosevelt on May 14, 1917: [...] "I wish you would arrange for an appointment with Tex Rickard and myself <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>you</b> at your office when convenient.

In my macabre pictures, I have either been a monster-maker or a monster-destroyer, but never a monster. Actually, I'm a gentle fellow. Never harmed a fly. I love animals, and when I'm in the country I'm a keen bird-watcher." [...] In {{an interview}} published in 1966, he added, [...] "I do get terribly tired with the neighbourhood kids telling me 'My mum says she wouldn't want <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>you</b> in a dark alley'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Eno co-produced The Unforgettable Fire (1984), The Joshua Tree (1987), Achtung Baby (1991), and All That You Can't Leave Behind (2000) for U2 {{with his}} {{frequent}} collaborator Daniel Lanois, and produced 1993's Zooropa with Mark [...] "Flood" [...] Ellis. In 1995, U2 and Eno {{joined forces to}} create the album Original Soundtracks 1 under the group name Passengers; songs from which included [...] "Your Blue Room" [...] and [...] "Miss Sarajevo". When the album was released, the US charts were dominated by movie soundtrack albums and singles. Even though films are listed for each song, all but three are bogus. Once Eno pointed {{out that it was}} not a real ploy for radio airplay, but a spoof of one, U2 agreed to the concept. Eno also produced Laid (1993), Wah Wah (1994) Millionaires (1999) and Pleased <b>to</b> <b>Meet</b> <b>You</b> (2001) for James, performing as an extra musician on all four. He is credited for [...] "frequent interference and occasional co-production" [...] on their 1997 album Whiplash.|$|E

2500|$|On January 13, 2012, Rap-Up {{released}} a remix of [...] "We Found Love" [...] featuring American rapper Flo Rida. Flo Rida's parts overlap Calvin Harris' produced dance beats.

2500|$|The mournful Soliquisto, a once {{great music}} hall artiste, {{believes}} {{he has come to}} the end of his career. [...] He used to headline halls like the Hackney Empire, but now he is lucky to play small rooms at the end of piers. [...] His act has always consisted of trained animals: a singing parakeet (Parakeet <b>to</b> <b>Meet</b> <b>You),</b> and two all-dancing, all-singing catsone male, Stinkfoot, and one female, Persian Moll. [...] Each of these were creations of true brilliance, but all he has left now is Moll, his ventriloquist's dummy Screwy, and his eager nephew and assistant Buster. [...] He and his company ("Soliquisto & His Not So Dumb Friends") have returned for a week’s engagement at the very end-of-the-pier venue where nine years before he had mysteriously lost his famous songbird and his most precious creation, the even more famous Stinkfoot. [...] Buster works with him, acting in all capacities: props, costumes, manager, and even as a ludicrous stand-in for the lost Stinkfoot. [...] Buster is ambitious, and knows his uncle was once the best. [...] He is convinced there’s a secret to being a true artist and if only Solisquisto would tell him that secret, Buster too could be a great artist. [...] Soliquisto has told Buster in every way he can what the secret is, most pointedly in the song Follow Your Nose, but Buster cannot “hear” him.|$|E
2500|$|After her {{elimination}} from American Idol, Miller {{announced plans}} to launch a music career as soon as possible, {{as well as an}} eventual acting career. Of her intents for her debut studio album, Miller has revealed that she would like to write or co-write all material and intends to show all sides to her personality in an intricate and artistic manner which she feels current mainstream music largely lacks. She further explained, [...] "I want to have music that has meaning and is real. I don't want to have dance-party music, but at the same time, I don't want to put people to sleep. I want to incorporate the soulful piano sound with a lot of edge. I know the message that I want to send out, and I know the music I want to do. I can't wait to show it to people." [...] The top three finalists – Miller, Candice Glover and Harrison – recorded background vocals on a song for judge Mariah Carey's fourteenth studio album, though it is yet to be confirmed whether it will be on the final track listing. On May 17, 2013, subsequent to the series' finale, Miller released her debut single [...] "You Set Me Free" [...] to digital retailers via her American Idol contract with 19 Recordings. On May 22, 2013, reports surfaced that Miller had signed a publishing contract with Universal Music Publishing Group (UMPG), and is in midst of searching for a record deal. In June 2013, Miller confirmed she was co-writing with Toby Gad, Autumn Rowe, David Hodges, Adam Watts and his Red Decibel team and recording demos in Los Angeles, California through social media. Along with the remainder of the Top 11 from season twelve, Miller embarked on the American Idols LIVE! Tour 2013, where she showcased original music, from July to August 2013.
