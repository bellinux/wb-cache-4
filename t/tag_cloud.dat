50|$|On the one hand, <b>tag</b> <b>cloud</b> {{has many}} benefits. It is simple to build, {{intuitive}} to understand, and widely used. It can also represent {{the three types}} of relationship among users, tags, and resources in the tagging systems. On the other hand, since there exists the limitation on size of the <b>tag</b> <b>cloud</b> that can be presented in the screen, selecting the best tags and structuring the information space to present the relationships in the <b>tag</b> <b>cloud</b> would be an important issue.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tag</b> <b>Cloud</b> search - Once text {{data has}} been tagged with certain topics {{it can be}} {{visually}} represented as a <b>Tag</b> <b>Cloud,</b> where the importance of each tag is represented as a font size and/or color. This way you can identify and pick the most prominent topics.|$|E
50|$|A second {{generation}} of software development discovered a wider diversity of uses for <b>tag</b> <b>clouds</b> as a basic visualization method for text data. Several extensions of <b>tag</b> <b>clouds</b> have been proposed in this context. Examples include Parallel <b>Tag</b> <b>Clouds,</b> SparkClouds, and Prefix <b>Tag</b> <b>Clouds.</b> The Word Cloud Explorer, written in Adobe Flex, combines <b>tag</b> <b>clouds</b> {{with a number of}} interactive features for text analysis.|$|R

We {{show how}} <b>tag</b> <b>clouds</b> {{can be used}} {{alongside}} more traditional query languages and data visualisation techniques {{as a means for}} browsing and querying databases. Our approach is based on a general, extensible framework that supports different modes of visualisation as well as different database systems. A number of demonstrator databases and interfaces will be used to show how <b>tag</b> <b>clouds</b> can be used to visualise and browse data or metadata and even a mix of both in object databases and relational databases. Further, we will demonstrate synchronised browsing based on <b>tag</b> <b>clouds</b> as well as ways in which <b>tag</b> <b>clouds</b> can be combined with other forms of querying and data visualisation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new method for {{displaying}} large-scale <b>tag</b> <b>clouds.</b> We use a topographical image that helps users {{to grasp the}} relationship among tags intuitively as a background to the <b>tag</b> <b>clouds.</b> We apply this interface to a blog navigation system and show that the proposed method enables users to find the desired tags easily even if the <b>tag</b> <b>clouds</b> are very large, 5, 000 and above tags. Our approach is also effective for understanding the overall structure of {{a large amount of}} tagged documents...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of folksonomy and related <b>tag</b> <b>clouds</b> in Web is increasing but not following a standard global design approach. People with {{certain type of}} disabilities, like blindness, can't access {{to this type of}} information. In this context, this article describes Clouds 4 All, an Internet Explorer browser extension that adds a <b>tag</b> <b>clouds</b> reader interface. This extension is result of a research on Web accessibility that aims to answer to some issues related to Web 2. 0 sprouting. In this particular context, the study relies on understanding blind users' needs and new accessibility and information models inherent to Web 2. 0, namely in what concerns the impact of the {{presence of}} <b>tag</b> <b>clouds</b> on user interface. The conceptualization, prototyping and implementation of the <b>tag</b> <b>clouds</b> reader interface, as well its test and evaluation, will be the main outcomes of this research...|$|R
50|$|The first <b>tag</b> <b>clouds</b> on a {{high-profile}} website {{were on the}} photo sharing site Flickr, created by Flickr co-founder and interaction designer Stewart Butterfield in 2004. That implementation was based on Jim Flanagan's Search Referral Zeitgeist, a visualization of Web site referrers. <b>Tag</b> <b>clouds</b> were also popularized {{around the same time}} by Del.icio.us and Technorati, among others.|$|R
40|$|<b>Tag</b> <b>clouds</b> are {{a popular}} method for {{visualizing}} and linking socially-organized information on websites. <b>Tag</b> <b>clouds</b> represent {{variables of interest}} (such as popularity) in the visual appearance of the keywords themselves - using text properties such as font size, weight, or colour. Although <b>tag</b> <b>clouds</b> are becoming common, there is still little information about which visual features of tags draw the attention of viewers. As <b>tag</b> <b>clouds</b> attempt to represent {{a wider range of}} variables with a wider range of visual properties, it becomes difficult to predict what will appear visually important to a viewer. To investigate this issue, we carried out an exploratory study that asked users to select <b>tags</b> from <b>clouds</b> that manipulated nine visual properties. Our results show that font size and font weight have stronger effects than intensity, number of characters, or tag area; but when several visual properties are manipulated at once, there is no one property that stands out above the others. This study adds to the understanding of how visual properties of text capture the attention of users, indicates general guidelines for designers of <b>tag</b> <b>clouds,</b> and provides a study paradigm and starting points for future studies. In addition, our findings may be applied more generally to the visual presentation of textual hyperlinks as a way to provide more information to web navigators...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we present an {{approach}} to improving navigability of a hierarchically structured Web content. The approach {{is based on an}} integration of a tagging module and adoption of <b>tag</b> <b>clouds</b> as a navigational aid for such content. The main idea of this approach is to apply tagging for the purpose of a better highlighting of cross–references between information items across the hierarchy. Although in principle <b>tag</b> <b>clouds</b> have the potential to support efficient navigation in tagging systems, recent research identified a number of limitations. In particular, applying <b>tag</b> <b>clouds</b> within pragmatic limits of a typical user interface leads to poor navigational performance as <b>tag</b> <b>clouds</b> are vulnerable to a so-called pagination effect. In this paper, a solution to the pagination problem is discussed, implemented as a part of an Austrian online encyclopedia called Austria-Forum, and analyzed. In addition, a simulation-based evaluation of the new algorithm has been conducted. The first evaluation results are quite promising, as the efficient navigational properties are restored...|$|R

40|$|Social {{bookmarking}} sites typically visualize user-generated <b>tags</b> as <b>tag</b> <b>clouds.</b> While <b>tag</b> <b>clouds</b> effectively {{show the}} relative frequency and thus popularity of tags, {{they fail to}} convey two aspects tothe users: (1) the similarity between tags, and (2) the abstractness of tags. We suggest an alternative to <b>tag</b> <b>clouds</b> known as <b>tag</b> hierarchies. Tag hierarchies {{are based on a}} minimum evolution-based greedy algorithm for tag hierarchy construction, which iteratively includes optimal tags into the tree that introduce minimum changes to the existing taxonomy. Our algorithm also uses a global tag ranking method to order tags according to their levels of tags will appear at higher levels in the taxonomy. Based on the tag hierarchy, we derive a new tag recommendation algorithm, which is a structure-based approach that does not require heavily trained models and thus is highly efficient. User studies and quantitative analysis suggest that (1) the tag hierarchy can potentially reduce the user’s tagging time in comparison to <b>tag</b> <b>clouds</b> and other <b>tag</b> tree structures, and (2) the tag recommendation algorithm significantly outperforms existing content-based methods in quality...|$|R

It is still unclear how users perceive the size of the words in <b>tag</b> <b>clouds</b> and how they make their judgments of the size of words. In this poster, we look at how users estimate the relative sizes of words given different characteristics. We studied the influence of decorations like filled areas, boxes, and shadows to determine whether they would influence the perceived size. Another parameter we tested was the appearance of words (i. e. by choosing words with and without ascenders and descen-ders). We found significant effects from all of those parameters, which suggests that designers of <b>tag</b> <b>clouds</b> {{need to be aware of}} the influence of design choices on the perceived data. ...|$|R
