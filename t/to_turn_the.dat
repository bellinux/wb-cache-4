5|$|Meanwhile, Allenby's {{plan for}} 13 November was <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> right {{flank of the}} Ottoman line on the coast despite {{aircraft}} and cavalry reconnaissances revealing a considerable Ottoman force further inland on the Egyptian Expeditionary Force's own right flank. He assigned the task of dealing with this immediate threat to the Australian Mounted Division, which was ordered to make as big a demonstration of their operations as possible. This would further focus Ottoman {{attention away from the}} coastal sector where the Anzac and Yeomanry Mounted Divisions would advance northwards to attempt <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman right flank assisted by infantry attacks on the Ottoman right centre the following day.|$|E
5|$|The Commission of Fine Arts met, and, at the {{suggestion}} of sculptor-member Lorado Taft, decided to ask Buffalo nickel designer James Earle Fraser (no relation) who would be most suitable <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> sketches into plaster models, from which the Mint could make coinage dies and hubs. James Fraser suggested Peace dollar designer Anthony de Francisci, but sculptor Chester Beach was engaged instead.|$|E

5|$|After the Ashton Canal {{closed in}} the 1960s, it was decided <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> Portland Basin {{warehouse}} into a museum. In 1985, {{the first part of}} the Heritage Centre and Museum opened on the first floor of the warehouse. The restoration of building was complete in 1999; the museum details Tameside's social, industrial, and political history. The basin next to the warehouse is the point at which the Ashton Canal, the Huddersfield Narrow Canal and the Peak Forest Canal meet. It has been used several times as a filming location for Coronation Street, including a scene where the character Richard Hillman drove into the canal.|$|E
5|$|After {{the cinema}} closed, it was {{purchased}} by Develop UK, and several attempts were made <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> building into a Wetherspoons pub. However these were rejected by the council twice, once in the initial planning application, and also in a subsequent appeal. The application was denied due to the moratorium on new food and drink licences in Withington, part of the town's unitary development plan. In 2002 the building {{was purchased by}} Arrows International. They applied for planning permission in December 2002 to demolish part of the cinema, reconstructing it as five ground floor shops, with 21flats on the upper floors. These plans were withdrawn as they were seen as overdeveloping the site.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the Australians' {{visit to}} England in 1930 {{there was some}} {{confidence}} in English cricketing circles, since Chapman's victorious 1928–29 side was largely intact and on paper looked formidably strong, especially in batting. England duly won the first Test, at Trent Bridge, by 93 runs, despite a second-innings century from Bradman that for a time threatened <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> match. Larwood's active participation was curtailed by an attack of gastritis; he took 2 wickets in the match for 21 runs.|$|E
5000|$|I {{have asked}} dozens of bicycle riders how they <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left. I have never found {{a single person}} who stated all the facts {{correctly}} when first asked. They almost invariably said that <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left, they <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> handlebar <b>to</b> the left {{and as a result}} made a <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left. But on further questioning them, some would agree that they first <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> handlebar a little to the right, and then as the machine inclined <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left, they <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> handlebar <b>to</b> the left and as a result made the circle, inclining inward.|$|R

5000|$|One way {{to speed}} up DTL is to add a small [...] "speed-up" [...] {{capacitor}} across R3. <b>The</b> capacitor helps <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> off <b>the</b> transistor by removing the stored base charge; the capacitor also helps <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> on <b>the</b> transistor by increasing the initial base drive.|$|R
5|$|Another torque is {{produced}} by the finite width of the contact patch and the lean of the tire in a turn. The portion of the contact patch towards {{the outside of the}} turn is actually moving rearward, with respect to the wheel's hub, faster {{than the rest of the}} contact patch, because of its greater radius from the hub. By the same reasoning, the inner portion is moving rearward more slowly. So the outer and inner portions of the contact patch slip on the pavement in opposite directions, generating a torque that tends <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> front wheel in the direction of the turn, and therefore tends to decrease the turn radius.|$|E
5|$|At first distraught at leaving Montreal, Dutton quickly {{adapted to}} playing in New York. He {{maintained}} his aggressive {{style of play}} with the Americans, again leading the league in penalties in 1931–32. Despite his fiery temper, Dutton {{became one of the}} most popular players in New York amongst both the fans and his fellow players. He was not able <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> Americans' fortunes on the ice around, however, as the team failed to qualify for the playoffs in his first five seasons with the team.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century Camber Castle and the {{surrounding}} farmland remained in private ownership and open to visitors. In the 1931 there was a proposal <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> keep into a golf clubhouse but the project was not taken forward and the facility was built at the nearby Castle Farm instead. A research team from the Victoria County History project visited the castle in 1935, resulting in the first – albeit cursory – historical analysis and survey of the fortification being published two years later.|$|E

5|$|By the 19th century, {{extensive}} docks {{had grown}} up around the Citadel and in 1802 the surrounding land was granted to the Hull Dock Company.
