40|$|Doubts {{have been}} raised on {{theoretical}} grounds concerning the effect of BCG in tropical countries, where in most places {{a large proportion of}} the population have a naturally acquired <b>tuberculin</b> <b>allergy</b> of low strength and unknown (but almost certainly non-specific) origin. Furthermore, vaccinations in the tropics may be less efficient if the BCG vaccine used has deteriorated from exposure to heat or light.

50|$|Intradermal {{injection}} is {{the injection}} of a substance into the dermis, {{just below the}} epidermis. This route has the longest absorption time as compared to subcutaneous injections and intramuscular injections. As a result, it is used for sensitivity tests, like <b>tuberculin</b> and <b>allergy</b> tests, and for local anesthesia. Additionally, the body's reaction to substances is more easily visible since it {{is closer to the}} surface.|$|R
40|$|Delayed {{hypersensitivity}} {{has generally}} been regarded as a homogeneous group of reactions including reactivity to proteins such as <b>tuberculin,</b> contact <b>allergy,</b> resistance to infection with viruses and other microorganisms, and allograft rejection (1). Recently, however, {{we have found that}} several forms of delayed-onset cellmediated hypersensitivity in animals are characterized by an extensive infiltration of basophilic leukocytes (2). Such reactions have been designated cutaneous basophil hypersensitivity or CBH 1 to distinguish them from true delayed hypersensitivity (DH) in which basophils are infrequent or altogether absent. In many instances, both forms of reactivity may be elicited to the same antigen, depending on the mode of immunization, and CBH is favored when sensitization to protein antigens (2 - 4), contact allergens (4, 5), a virus (6), or allografts (7) is accomplished without the use of complete Freund's adiuvant. While CBH reactions to protein antigens are often transient and of the Jones-Mote type (3), in other instances, as with contact allergy and viral immunity, the characteristic basophil response persists for weeks or months (4, 6). In addition to differences in morphology and requirements for immunization...|$|R
40|$|Delayed or {{tuberculin}} type sensitivity {{is characterized}} by the progressive development of an inflammatory reaction at the site of tuberculin deposits. This reaction reaches its peak after 24 hours and when intense is marked by tissue necrosis. The term, delayed, best applies to the gross appearance of the reaction since time lapse movies of this process (1) indicate that the reaction begins after a few minutes. Within several hours the gross reaction is marked by induration, erythema, and some edema. Histological studies of these changes, according to Dienes and Mallory (2), are characterized by a predominant round cell infiltration, vascular engorgement, and by variable amounts of polymorphonuclear infiltration. In contradistinction, Follis (3) found that polymorphonuclear leucocytes predominate. Many efforts to show that this type response is due to a circulating antibody have been unsuccessful. Passive transfer of <b>tuberculin</b> type <b>allergy</b> by serum has been reported only once (4). Rich and Lewis found that tissue cultures of spleen, bone marrow, and peripheral blood cells from animals sensitized to tuberculin were injured by high concentrations of tuberculin (5). Moen and Swift (6) found that this cellula...|$|R
40|$|The {{frequent}} {{experience in}} the tropics of poor results of BCG vaccination is sometimes explained by a hypothetical interaction with ”non-specific” tuberculin sensitivity. However, samples of data from five tropical countries, reported in this paper, demonstrate a slight, positive correlation between the individual <b>tuberculin</b> <b>allergy</b> before and after vaccination. A negative correlation {{might have been expected}} had the ”non-specific” allergy been the cause of the poor vaccination results, and this particular hypothesis is therefore rejected...|$|E
40|$|Results {{are given}} {{for one of}} a series of {{projects}} designed to investigate the relation between observable post-vaccination responses and acquired resistance to tuberculosis. Controlled variations in the dose of BCG vaccine have previously been shown to cause systematic variations in the degree of skin sensitivity to tuberculin and the size of vaccinal lesions in human beings: the purpose of the present project was to see if similar variations would be produced in guinea-pigs and then, by infecting the animals with virulent tubercle bacilli, to see how survival time correlates with <b>tuberculin</b> <b>allergy</b> and vaccinal lesions...|$|E
40|$|BCG {{vaccine is}} {{commonly}} assessed for biological activity by {{its ability to}} induce tuberculin sensitivity in guinea-pigs. In 1950, the WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization advocated using a sensitizing dose of 5 mg of BCG. It is now known, however, that allergy can be produced by much smaller doses. Since {{the use of such}} a low dose that an attenuated vaccine would fail to induce allergy might be advantageous for assessing the biological activity, a further investigation of <b>tuberculin</b> <b>allergy</b> in the guinea-pig has recently been undertaken jointly by the BCG Department of the Statens Seruminstitut, Copenhagen, and the former WHO Tuberculosis Research Office, Copenhagen...|$|E
40|$|The {{variegated}} {{picture of}} tuiberculous infection, both spontaneous in man and experimentally induced in animals, has puzzled students {{and led to}} most complicated explanations. Most of the earlier experimental studies were handicapped {{by the lack of}} two fundamentals which now appear so essential to a solution. One of these was the primary lack of information on the tubercle bacillus and its virulence or avirulence, and the other was the necessity for an exact interpretation of the quantitative relations between the bacilli and the host as expressed in the evaluation of infection and specific immunity. As long as tuberculin and <b>tuberculin</b> <b>allergy</b> were fitted into the picture of specific immunity, and <b>tuberculin</b> <b>allergy</b> was viewed as synonymous with immunity, progress was hampered because of an experimental phenomenon which did not exist naturally. ' However, with a better conception of the avirulence of tubercle bacilli, stressed by Calmette with BCG, and a full recognition of grades of virulence of mammalian bacilli, it became possible to evaluate more exactly the elements involved in specific tubercultosis immunity, to understand its mechanism better, and to determine its part in experimental infection and recovery. It had frequently been noted that certain strains of tubercle bacilli would not infect all of the experimental animals uniformly though used in relatively large amounts, and yet those animals that were infected became definitely tuberculous. These observations were made frequently on guinea-pigs infected with mammalian tu'bercle bacilli to which they were usually acknowledged to be highly suscepti'ble. In earlier studies it was shown that a relative specific tuberculosis immunity is produced readily and consistently by viable avirulent mammalian tubercle bacilli, 6 and that this immunity must be produced actively and cannot be transmitted from mother to offspring 4 or passively transferred by the injection of blood or plasma. This specific tuberculosis immunity is quantitative and depends on a number of factors...|$|E
40|$|Early in 1953, nearly 2, 000 {{schoolchildren}} in Jabalpur, India, were tuberculin-tested, and 1, 200 of them vaccinated, in a co-operative study {{designed to}} determine whether exposing the vaccination site to strong sunlight immediately after injection of BCG would affect the development of <b>tuberculin</b> <b>allergy.</b> Follow-up examination in 5 - 6 weeks showed that the tuberculin reactions (and vaccinal lesions) averaged the same size in three groups of vaccinated children: (a) those whose vaccination site was exposed to sunlight for a period ranging from 0 to 45 minutes immediately after vaccination; (b) those exposed for a full 45 minutes after an interval ranging from 0 to 45 minutes after vaccination; and (c) those not exposed during the study period. It would thus appear unnecessary {{at the present time}} to recommend shielding the vaccination site from sunlight immediately after the vaccine has been injected...|$|E
40|$|A {{controlled}} {{study on}} the enhancing of <b>tuberculin</b> <b>allergy</b> {{by one or more}} earlier tuberculin tests was carried out in a previously untested and unvaccinated population, in an area where the prevalence of non-specific allergy was known to be high. The results have shown that a test with 1 TU of PPD RT 23 in Tween 80 diluent causes subsequent tests to elicit significantly larger reactions. This enhancing effect is more marked among those with initial reactions of 8 - 13 mm to 1 TU or 10 mm and more to 20 TU. There is practically no enhancement among those whose reactions to 20 TU measure 0 - 4 mm or even 0 - 9 mm. Even in the group with reactions of 10 mm and more to 20 TU only some individuals show evidence of enhancement. The enhancing of allergy increases with age...|$|E
40|$|Observation of the {{specific}} toxic effect of bacterial products on living sensitive cells in tissue culture offers a direct approach to a study of certain phases of bacterial allergic or hypersensitive states. In a preceding study (1) tuberculin was shown to have a specific toxic effect on sensitive cells from animals infected with several strains of tubercle bacilli having various degrees of virulence. This communication {{presents the results of}} an investigation by the tissue culture technique, of hypersensitive states associated with infection by a different species of microorganism, namely the hemolytic streptococcus. This permits of a comparison of cutaneous reactivity, antibody production and the development of cellular susceptibility to the toxic action of certain bacterial products in vitro.

40|$|Certain {{reactions}} of rabbits to intradermal injection of living nonhemolytic streptococci {{have been studied}} in detail by Swift and his coworkers (1, 2), who demonstrated that such injections properly spaced induce a condition in all respects comparable to the sensitization of infection (<b>tuberculin</b> <b>allergy).</b> Among the detectors of this condition is the lethal test, which consists of intravenous injections of living cultures in doses comparatively innocuous for normal animals, but which cause the death of about 50 per cent of sensitized rabbits in from 24 to 48 hours. Macroscopic postmortem findings in animals so dying include swelling and edema of lymph nodes and thymus, with gross hemorrhages into these organs, and also into the tricuspid ring, subperitoneal tissues, and elsewhere (1). Because lethal inocula regularly induce severe tissue damage, it has seemed of interest to determine what lesions, if any, might follow the administration of non-lethal doses...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{repeatedly}} shown that vaccination with BCG can induce a definite, although limited, level of antituberculous immunity in experimental animals. But, though {{the principle of}} BCG vaccination is widely accepted, almost all its practical aspects {{have been the subject}} of endless controversies. These involve the stability of the BCG strain, the techniques of preparation and preservation of the vaccine, the procedures used for its administration, the extent and duration of the immunity induced, etc. Investigation of the problems of antituberculous immunity has been rendered more difficult by the lack of simple and dependable experimental techniques for the assessment of the protective effects of vaccination. The measurement of tuberculin hypersensitivity in vaccinated individuals is a convenient technique for establishing that the vaccine has "taken, " but unfortunately, it provides no information concerning the development of immunity in the vaccinated individual. Despite many assertions, there is no evidence that <b>tuberculin</b> <b>allergy</b> and immunity to infection follow parallel courses and tha...|$|E
40|$|Rabbits immunized with BCG or {{infected}} with human tubercle bacilli were continuously desensitized with Sauton culture filtrate {{to study the}} relationship between <b>tuberculin</b> <b>allergy</b> and serum antibodies. By desensitizaton the tuberculin reaction gradually decreased and became negative in some cases, while precipitins and agglutinins increased. Thus the dissociation was observed between the strength of tuberculin reaction and the quantity of serum antibodies. But a definite inter-dependence between tuberculin reaction and serum antibodies was not observed in the complement fixation test. As anticutins were not always present in the sera of desensitized rabbits, the cause of tuberculin reaction showing negative by desensitization can not be laid {{at the door of}} anticutins and from experiments on the animals, which were sensitized with two antigens, and later desensitized with two antigens, {{it can be said that}} the "dissociation" is specific in tuberculin desensitization. It is evident that such desensitization gives a higher degree of immunity against the rein-fection with Myco. tuberculosis. From these results the interrelationship between allergy and immunity has been discussed...|$|E
40|$|Adequate {{biological}} or immunological criteria are still lacking for the standardization of the vaccines made from living attenuated bovine tubercle bacilli (BCG). It is probable that, eventually, standardization {{will be based}} on quantitative measurements of the humoral or cellular response of the host to the specific bacterial antigen which induces protective immunity against tuberculous infection. As long as the mechanism of antituberculous immunity remains unknown, however, {{it may be necessary to}} standardize the vaccine in terms of less specific criteria: the level of attenuation of the BCG culture, the amount of bacterial material present in the vaccine preparation, the viability and physiological activity of the cells which it contains, etc. All these different characteristics are probably of importance in determining the extent to which BCG is capable of multiplying in ~rivo, and its effectiveness in establishing <b>tuberculin</b> <b>allergy</b> and resistance against infection. In the hope of minimizing both qualitative and quantitative variations in the activity of the vaccine, most BCG workers have advocated a rigid adherence to the preparative technique...|$|E
40|$|Much {{progress}} has been made during recent years towards the identification of the components of tubercle bacilli which are responsible for tubercle formation and for the development of <b>tuberculin</b> <b>allergy.</b> It has never been proved however that these two phenomena can account [...] singly or jointly [...] for all the systemic manifestations of tuberculosis. Indeed, there are a few facts which suggest that tubercle bacilli contain or produce substances capable of exerting deleterious effects on the host without participation of allergic processes and without productive tissue reaction. The toxicity of cultures of tubercle bacilli has been observed under a wide range of conditions. In rabbits and guinea pigs, the injection of bacillary bodies killed by heat or disinfectants always causes loss of weight and commonly elicits the production of tubercles. The cachexia is slowly progressive and is eventually fatal if the amount of bacilli injected is large enough (1 - 5). While these effects can be obtained by injecting bacilli resuspended in aqueous medium (1 - 3), the results are more dramatic when an oil (mineral or vegetable) is used as a vehicle (4, 5) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} studies has been {{undertaken}} by the Tuberculosis Chemotherapy Centre Madras, with the ultimate object of finding out whether differences in the virulence of the tubercle bacilli isolated from Indian tuberculous patients {{before the start of}} chemotherapy are related to the severity of the patients' disease and to the subsequent response to treatment. This paper—the second in the series—presents the results of a comparative investigation of the virulence in the guinea-pig of tubercle bacilli obtained from Indian and from British tuberculous patients before treatment. In this investigation, which was carried out at the Centre and at the Microbiological Research Establishment, Porton, England, the virulence of the Indian and the British cultures was assessed by guinea-pig mortality, by the ”root-index of virulence” (based on the post-mortem tuberculous disease score and the survival period of the animal), and by the results of spleen culture. The Indian cultures were found, on the average, to be less virulent and to show a w der range of virulence than the British cultures, both in the Porton and in the Madras series of experiments. A further indication of the heterogeneity of the Indian tubercle bacilli was provided by the results of tuberculin tests: whereas the British cultures appeared to be homogeneous in their ability to induce <b>tuberculin</b> <b>allergy</b> in the guinea-pig, the Indian cultures showed considerable variation in this respect...|$|E
40|$|Tissue culture {{methods have}} been but little used in the elucidation of the various {{problems}} encountered in bacterial hypersensitivity. The few studies reported have dealt with tissues from tuberculin sensitive animals. Rich and Lewis (1) showed that tuberculin in proper concentration had a selective toxic effect on cells from tuberculous animals. They believed that the tuberculin sensitivity was inherent in the cells, and that the cytotoxic effect {{was the result of}} an antigen-antibody reaction. Aronson (2) confirmed this work and also demonstrated the cytotoxic specificity of various tuberculins on sensitive cells as compared with an indifferent effect of extracts made from other acid-fast organisms. In another series of experiments he (3) compared the reaction of tissues from animals sensitized to proteins with that of tissues sensitive to tuberculin when the respective antigens were added to the culture media. Horse serum added to cultures of tissues from horse serum sensitized animals produced no demonstrable cytotoxic effect; this was in marked contrast to the cytotoxic action of tuberculin on tissues from tuberculous animals; he thus showed that there is a fundamental difference between the two types of hypersensitive tissues. We (4) have also noted that cells from animals sensitized with horse serum, egg albumin or beef lens were not specifically inhibited when the respective antigens were added to tissue cultures. As a preliminary to an analysis of other types of bacterial hypersensitive states it was thought advisable to make a detailed study of <b>tuberculin</b> <b>allergy</b> since this is a prototype.

40|$|Groups of {{guinea pigs}} were vaccinated by the {{intracutaneous}} route with cultures of BCG grown in a liquid medium containing Tween 80 and the soluble fraction of heated human serum. After the cultures had been stored at 4 °C. for various periods of time, the antigenic response was {{compared with that}} of another group of guinea pigs receiving standard BCG vaccine prepared by the conventional technique. The local lesions occurring at the site of injection of cultures in Tween-serum filtrate medium were more severe than those produced by the standard vaccine. It was shown that this difference was probably due to the much larger number of viable bacilli in the former preparations. A marked degree of sensitization could be produced with culture dilutions containing as few as 10 viable units (single bacilli or small clumps). Slightly larger doses of BCG led to the highest degree of <b>tuberculin</b> <b>allergy</b> detectable by the technique employed. Further increases in the dose of vaccine failed to alter the level of sensibility when the animals were tested with tuberculin 5 weeks after vaccination. The same degree of sensitization was achieved by vaccination with 0. 1 cc. of either the standard vaccine or any of the fresh or stored cultures in Tween-serum filtrate medium. It was shown that these doses contained numbers of living bacilli far greater than the minimal number required to induce maximal sensitization. Under the conditions used, the guinea pigs vaccinated with cultures of BCG (fresh or stored) grown in the Tween-serum filtrate medium exhibited a marked degree of resistance to subcutaneous infection with virulent tubercle bacilli...|$|E
40|$|Tubercle bacilli {{separated}} from young cultures were thoroughly extracted with monochlorobenzene at temperatures never exceeding 50 °C. From the soluble material, a fraction corresponding to approximately 1 per {{cent of the}} total bacillary weight was separated by fractional precipitation with petrolic ether at temperatures of 0 ° or 4 °C. —depending upon the strain of bacilli. The monochlorobenzene-soluble-ether-insoluble material (fraction 7) prepared from BCG-P was found to contain 0. 14 per cent nitrogen and 0. 4 per cent phosphorus. Some of its other chemical characteristics are described. Fraction 7 proved unable to elicit <b>tuberculin</b> <b>allergy</b> in guinea pigs, but injection of 5 µg. of it into the skin produced severe local reactions. In albino mice, a single intraperitoneal injection of 20 µg. caused loss of muscular tone and of weight followed by death within 9 days. The only tissue reaction observed was a slight degree of peritonitis. In mice of the C 57 BL strain, a single injection of 40 µg. also caused death in the same time, but with pulmonary hemorrhages—usually massive. Material similar to fraction 7 was obtained from one virulent, two attenuated, and one avirulent strain of mammalian tubercle bacilli (bovine and human). The fractions obtained from the various strains differed somewhat in solubility and toxicity. The more virulent the culture, the more toxic was the fraction obtained from it; {{but it is possible}} that this relation was the result of differences in the effectiveness of the extraction procedures, rather than of characteristics inherent to the cultures. Evidence is presented that the toxicity of fraction 7 accounts for much of the primary toxicity of tubercle bacilli...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey was}} made of tuberculous {{infection}} among the inhabitants of Goimachi, Chiba Prefecture on a long term basis. The program included nearly all {{the inhabitants of the}} town amounting to 12, 000, and was continued for 10 years from 1947 to 1956. In conncection with the program, the author studied <b>tuberculin</b> <b>allergy</b> in individuals having examinations, and obtained the following results : (1) The ratio of BCG non-vaccinated tuberculin-positive individulas converting to tuberculin-negative status to all BCG non-vaccinated tuberculin positive individuals ranged from 2. 4 % to 5. 4 % every year. The conversion rate was high among both younger and older age groups. Many of these convertors had been weakly tuberculin-positive in the initial tests. (2) Of the individuals converting from tuberculin-positive to tuberculin-negative status who had been followed for a long period (over 5 years), less than half was determined to have completely converted to tuberculin-negative status. All the individuals in whom roentgenograms revealed pulmonary involvement at the time of conversion from tuberculin-positive to tuberculin-negative status, or a year before or after that, were found to have cured tuberculous lesions. (3) The rate of conversion from tuberculin-negative to tuberculin-positive status in one year following BCG vaccination was slightly higher in females than in males, low in a age group 0 - 9 years, but markedly high in age groups over 10 - 19 years. Conversion from tuberculin-positive to tuberculin-negative status after having acquired sensitivity to tuberculin occurred in comparatively larger percentages soon after acquisition of sensitivity than in any other period (after 1 year, 20. 8 %; after 3 years (cumulatively), 49. 4 %; after 8 years (cumulatively), 78. 6 %). The conversion occurred less often among those who had given strongly positive reactions to tuberculin tests when they acquired sensitivity to tuberculin, and more often among those who had received BCG vaccination when they were less than 9 years old. (4) Repeated BCG vaccination carried out for over 3 times did not result in the rise in the rate of conversion from tuberculin-negative to tuberculin-positive status, but rather tended to lower it. The greater the number of times of BCG vaccination, the higher was the rate of conversion from tuberculin-positive to tuberculin-negaive status after having acquired sensitivity to tuberculin. (5) Individuals who did not easily acquire sensitivity to tuberculin in spite of repeated BCG vaccination were found more often in an age group 0 - 9 years than in any other age groups. They were slightly larger in number among males than among females. Quite a small number of them had pulmonary involvement. (6) Of 10, 764 persons surveyed under our program, 621 had pulmonary involvement. Of the 621 persons, 7 (1. 1 %) gave doubtful positive tuberculin reactions and 8 (1. 3 %) did not react to tuberculin tests at the time tuberculous lesions were detected in their lungs. When those who were either negatively anergic, positively anergic or transiently anergic were excluded, none of those who did not react to tuberculin tests had pulmonary tuberculosis which might require medical treatment...|$|E
