5|$|As regards a bill {{mentioned}} in paragraph 1, the President, acting {{in accordance with}} the advice of the Cabinet, may refer to a Constitutional Tribunal {{the question of whether the}} bill circumvents or curtails the discretionary powers conferred on him or her by the Constitution. If the Tribunal is of the opinion <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> does not have this effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day after the day when the Tribunal's opinion is pronounced in open court. On the other hand, if the Tribunal feels <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> does have the circumventing or curtailing effect, and the President either has withheld or withholds his assent to the bill, the Prime Minister may direct <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> be submitted to the electors for a national referendum. In that case, the bill only becomes law if it is supported by not less than two-thirds of the total number of votes cast at the referendum. If 30 days have expired after a bill has been presented to the President for assent and he or she has neither signified the withholding of assent nor referred the Bill to a Constitutional Tribunal, the bill is deemed to have been assented to on the day following the expiry of the 30-day period. The procedure is similar for a bill {{mentioned in}} paragraph 2, except that if the Constitutional Tribunal rules <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> has a circumventing or curtailing effect, the Prime Minister has no power to put the bill to a referendum. This ensures that changes to the President's discretionary powers can only be made by way of constitutional amendments and not ordinary statutes.|$|E
5|$|On May 9, 1921, {{striking}} of the Morgan dollar resumed at the Philadelphia Mint {{under the}} recoinage {{called for by}} the Pittman Act. The same day, Congressman Vestal introduced the Peace dollar authorization bill as a joint resolution. Vestal placed his bill on the Unanimous Consent Calendar, but Congress adjourned for a lengthy recess without taking any action. When Congress returned, Vestal asked for unanimous consent <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> pass on August 1, 1921. However, one representative, former Republican leader James R. Mann (Illinois) objected, and numismatic historian Roger Burdette suggests that Mann's stature in the House ensured <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> would not pass. Nevertheless, Vestal met with the ANA {{and told them that}} he hoped Congress would reconsider when it met again in December 1921.|$|E
5|$|The Bill {{is unique}} amongst police dramas {{in that it}} takes a serial format, {{focussing}} on the work and lives of a single shift of police officers, rather than on one particular area of police work. Also unique is <b>that</b> <b>The</b> <b>Bill</b> adapted to this format after several series, whereas comparable series started with the serial format.|$|E

25|$|All three {{representatives from}} Nevis, {{including}} {{the leader of}} the opposition in the Nevis Island Assembly, objected to the introduction of these <b>bills</b> into <b>the</b> National Assembly in Saint Kitts, arguing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills</b> would affect <b>the</b> ability of Nevis to develop its offshore financial services sector and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills</b> would be detrimental to the Nevis economy. All the representatives in opposition in the National Assembly shared <b>the</b> conviction <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills,</b> if passed into law, would be unconstitutional and undermine the constitutional and legislative authority of the Nevis Island Administration, as well as result in the destruction of the economy of Nevis.|$|R

5|$|After the Finance Committee vote on October 15, {{negotiations}} {{turned to}} moderate Democrats. Majority leader Harry Reid focused on satisfying centrists. The holdouts {{came down to}} Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, an independent who caucused with Democrats, and conservative Nebraska Democrat Ben Nelson. Lieberman's demand <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> not include a public option was met, although supporters won various concessions, including allowing state-based public options such as Vermont's Green Mountain Care.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Bill of Rights was {{submitted}} to the states for ratification, opinions had shifted in both parties. Many Federalists, who had previously opposed a Bill of Rights, now supported the Bill {{as a means of}} silencing the Anti-Federalists' most effective criticism. Many Anti-Federalists, in contrast, now opposed it, realizing that the Bill's adoption would greatly lessen the chances of a second constitutional convention, which they desired. Anti-Federalists such as Richard Henry Lee also argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> left the most objectionable portions of the Constitution, such as the federal judiciary and direct taxation, intact.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the debates and {{legislative}} maneuvering that went into crafting the Bill of Rights amendments was done, many personal opinions had shifted. A number of Federalists came out in support, thus silencing the Anti-Federalists' most effective critique. Many Anti-Federalists, in contrast, were now opposed, realizing that Congressional approval of these amendments would greatly lessen {{the chances of a}} second constitutional convention. Anti-Federalists such as Richard Henry Lee also argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> left the most objectionable portions of the Constitution, such as the federal judiciary and direct taxation, intact.|$|E

5000|$|The Wall Street Journal {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills</b> {{tax provisions}} [...] "represented the largest {{tax increase in}} the past two decades", based on the year-to-year increase in tax rates from 2012 to 2013. [...] However, Dave Camp, the Republican chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, called the same provisions the [...] "largest tax cut in American history", referring to <b>the</b> fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills</b> tax rates replace much higher rates for 2013 that were provided for in the laws previously in effect.|$|R

5|$|In 2002, The Independent {{reported}} that The Bills Thursday episode was viewed by approximately 7million people, a fall of approximately 3million viewers {{in the space}} of 6 months. After the cast clearout resulting from the Sun Hill fire in April 2002, BBC News reported <b>that</b> <b>The</b> <b>Bill</b> attracted 8.6million viewers, the highest figure for the year to that point, and by October 2003, the program had around 8million viewers each week.|$|E
5|$|Labour again {{brought their}} bill {{before the new}} house on 31 October 2007 but the Government again voted the bill down. The Green Party, now in Government also voted in {{opposition}} to the bill, with spokesperson Ciarán Cuffe arguing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> was unconstitutional but without giving a reasoning. The Government committed itself to introducing its own bill for registered civil partnerships by 31 March 2008, a date it failed to meet.|$|E
5|$|Sylvia Lim was an NCMP from 2006 till Parliament was {{dissolved}} in 2011 {{for the general}} election held that year, at which she was elected {{as one of the}} MPs for Aljunied GRC. While she was an NCMP, Parliament debated the Human Organ Transplant (Amendment) Bill 2009 which would permit an organ donor to receive a reasonable amount of payment as a reimbursement for medical checks, insurance and other medical expenses, and loss of income. Lim spoke of her worry <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> might lead to a backdoor organ trading and profiteering.|$|E
5000|$|On May 10, 2014, Brown {{was traded}} to <b>the</b> Buffalo <b>Bills.</b> [...] <b>The</b> trade sent Brown and the Eagles 2014 7th round pick for <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> 2015 4th round pick and 2014 7th round pick. On September 15, 2015, it was {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> had released Brown.|$|R

5000|$|In the {{original}} action before the Chief Justice, which was upheld on {{appeal to the}} Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc, the allegation of unseaworthiness was rejected, but it was accepted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> loss {{was due to the}} captain's negligence in navigation. <b>The</b> contention <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills</b> of lading were illegal was rejected [...] in addition, the Court also held <b>that</b> if <b>the</b> <b>bills</b> of lading were held to be illegal, the parties were in pari delicto and on <b>that</b> ground <b>the</b> action must fail.|$|R
5|$|The debate, again {{including}} {{contributions from}} Justice Minister Michael McDowell, {{took place in}} February 2007. All speakers supported civil unions for same-sex couples and complimented Deputy Howlin on the bill. One expressed reservations about adoption. Minister McDowell claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> violated the constitutional provisions on marriage and the family. Government speakers said that civil unions needed to be introduced but that more time was needed {{to take account of}} the ongoing Supreme Court case and investigation work in the Department of Justice.|$|E
5|$|The hookbill's {{distinguishing}} characteristic was a heavy, parrotlike bill. The {{upper mandible}} hooked sharply downwards, while the heavy lower mandible hooked sharply upwards towards {{the middle of}} the upper mandible. This structure left a gap between the two mandibles when the bird held its beak closed. It is believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> was pale pink in coloration. The jaw muscles were particularly well developed around the bill. The hookbill's tongue was primitive and nontubular.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of the Prince Imperial, Beatrice's brother, Albert Edward, the Prince of Wales, {{suggested}} that she marry their sister Alice's widower, Louis IV, the Grand Duke of Hesse, who had lost his wife to diphtheria in 1878. Albert Edward argued that Beatrice could act as replacement mother for Louis's young children and spend most of her time in England looking after her mother. He further suggested the Queen could oversee the upbringing of her Hessian grandchildren with greater ease. However, at the time, it was forbidden by law for Beatrice to marry her sister's widower. This was countered by the Prince of Wales, who vehemently supported passage by the Houses of Parliament of the Deceased Wife's Sister Bill, which would have removed the obstacle. Despite popular support for this measure and although it passed in the House of Commons, it was rejected by the House of Lords because of opposition from the Lords Spiritual. Although the Queen was disappointed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> had failed, she was happy to keep her daughter at her side.|$|E
60|$|The {{consequence}} of this was, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills</b> increased again 400 the very first week in November; and if I might believe the physicians, there was above 3000 fell sick that week, most of them new-comers, too.|$|R
50|$|The U.S. Secret Service {{estimates}} that North Korea has produced $45 million in superdollars since 1989. They allege <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills</b> are produced at the Pyongsong Trademark Printing Factory, which {{is under the}} supervision of General O Kuk-ryol.|$|R

5|$|Bill C-19 (previously Bill S-4) titled An Act {{to amend}} the Constitution Act, 1867 (Senate tenure) was a bill to limit new Senators' tenure to eight-year terms. Currently, {{senators}} can stay in office until they reach the age of 75. The bill was first introduced {{by the government in}} the Senate on May 30, 2006. After consideration in committee and making amendments to the bill, the Senate recommended <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> not be proceeded with until such time as the Supreme Court of Canada had ruled with respect to its constitutionality, which had not occurred prior to dissolution. The bill was reintroduced in the second session as a Commons bill on November 13, 2007, but did not become law before the session ended.|$|E
5|$|Florida's {{consideration}} {{of a bill}} to compensate victims of racial violence was the first by any U.S. state. Opponents argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> set a dangerous precedent and put the onus of paying survivors and descendants on Floridians who {{had nothing to do}} with the incident in Rosewood. James Peters, who represented the State of Florida, argued that the statute of limitations applied because the law enforcement officials named in the lawsuit—Sheriff Walker and Governor Hardee—had died many years before. He also called into question the shortcomings of the report: although the historians were instructed not to write it with compensation in mind, they offered conclusions about the actions of Sheriff Walker and Governor Hardee. The report was based on investigations led by historians as opposed to legal experts; they relied in cases on information that was hearsay from witnesses who had since died. Critics thought that some of the report's writers asked leading questions in their interviews.|$|E
5|$|In 1895, Taylor {{was elected}} Attorney General of Kentucky, and served until 1899. During his term, state senator William Goebel {{proposed}} an election law {{that created a}} state Board of Elections which was empowered to appoint all election officers in every county and certify all election results. The board was to be appointed by the General Assembly, {{and there were no}} requirements that its composition be bi-partisan. The law was widely seen as a power play by Goebel, designed to ensure Democratic victories in state elections, including Goebel's own anticipated run for governor. The law passed the General Assembly, but was vetoed by Republican governor William O. Bradley. The General Assembly promptly overrode the veto. As attorney general, Taylor opined <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> was unconstitutional. The measure was adjudicated by the Kentucky Court of Appeals and found to be constitutional.|$|E
60|$|The {{consequence}} of this was, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills</b> increased again four hundred the very first week in November; and, if I might believe the physicians, there were above three thousand fell sick that week, most of them newcomers too.|$|R
60|$|The son did not remind <b>the</b> father <b>that</b> all {{regularity}} in {{the matter}} had ended there, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills</b> so sent had never been paid; {{but he could not}} help thinking that in justice he might do so.|$|R
50|$|In June 2014 the {{parliamentary}} Joint Committee on Human Rights claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill's</b> proposals to allow staff in “secure colleges” to use “reasonable force where {{necessary to ensure}} good order and discipline” would contravene the European Convention on Human Rights.|$|R
5|$|Sereno E. Payne, {{chairman}} of the House Ways and Means Committee, had held hearings in late 1908, and sponsored the resulting draft legislation. On balance, the bill reduced tariffs slightly, but when it passed the House in April 1909 and reached the Senate, the {{chairman of}} the Senate Finance Committee, Rhode Island Senator Nelson W. Aldrich, attached many amendments raising rates. This outraged progressives such as Wisconsin's Robert M. La Follette, who urged Taft to say <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> was not in accord with the party platform. Taft refused, angering them. Taft insisted that most imports from the Philippines be free of duty, and according to Anderson, showed effective leadership on a subject he was knowledgeable on and cared about.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill was}} {{carried over into}} the 2010 session and Lingle stated in January 2010 <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> was a {{distraction}} from the budget {{and should not be}} voted on for final passage in the Senate. Senator Brian Taniguchi argued the legislature could work on several issues simultaneously and the bill would pass. If passed, the amended bill would have to be approved by the House of Representatives. Speaker of the House Calvin Say stated that a vote on the bill would depend on whether the Senate passed the bill with enough votes to override a gubernatorial veto, arguing that {{he does not want to}} force a vote on controversial legislation in an election year if the bill's approval was in doubt. The Senate bill contains an effective date of January 1, 2010, and if the language is not changed, the bill could be vetoed regardless of its content.|$|E
5|$|The {{other two}} grounds relate to {{attempts}} by Parliament to circumvent or curtail the discretionary powers conferred on the President by the Constitution. Article 22H of the Constitution deals with attempts {{to alter the}} President's powers by introducing an ordinary bill. If this occurs, the President may exercise personal discretion to withhold assent to the bill. The Cabinet may, if it wishes, advise the President {{to refer to the}} Tribunal the question whether the bill in fact has the effect of circumventing or curtailing his discretionary powers. If the Tribunal determines <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> does not have that effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day following the day when the Tribunal's opinion is pronounced in open court.|$|E
5000|$|An {{editorial}} in The Lancet Oncology said that Saatchi was promoting [...] "precisely {{the type of}} emotional response that evidence-based practice seeks to avoid", <b>that</b> <b>the</b> current UK law already provided for medical innovation, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill's</b> provisions threatened to undermine the hippocratic oath.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> Buffalo <b>Bills</b> {{have retired}} two numbers in {{franchise}} history: No. 12 for Jim Kelly and No. 78 for Bruce Smith. Despite <b>the</b> fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> have only retired two jersey numbers in franchise history, {{the team has}} other numbers no longer issued to any player or in reduced circulation.|$|R
5000|$|Opponents {{stressed}} {{particularly the}} effects on public availability of biomedical research results, such as those funded by NIH grants, submitting <b>that</b> under <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> [...] "taxpayers who already paid for the research {{would have to pay}} again to read the results". Mike Taylor from the University of Bristol said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill's</b> denial of access to scientific research would cause [...] "preventable deaths in developing countries" [...] and [...] "an incalculable loss to science", and said Representatives Issa and Maloney were motivated by multiple donations they had received from the academic publisher Elsevier.|$|R
