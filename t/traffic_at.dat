50|$|In 2011-2014, Boris Kerner has {{expanded}} three phase traffic theory, which he developed initially for highway traffic, for {{the description of}} city traffic. It turns out that like <b>traffic</b> breakdown <b>at</b> highway bottlenecks, <b>traffic</b> breakdown <b>at</b> <b>traffic</b> signals is also a random phase transition that occurs in metastable under-saturated city traffic. This theory of <b>traffic</b> breakdown <b>at</b> <b>traffic</b> signals can explain the physics of traffic gridlock in city traffic {{as well as the}} breakdown of green wave that is often observed in real city traffic. Moreover, like empirical studies of highway traffic, recent empirical studies of over-saturated city traffic prove the existence of empirical synchronized flow in city traffic.|$|R

5|$|In 1992, RIDOT {{reviewed}} {{plans for}} an eastern extension of Route 37.

The first option was ultimately dropped by RIDOT after studies indicated the routing would interfere with aviation <b>traffic</b> <b>at</b> T. F. Green Airport. The freeway extension to Route 117, however, remains on RIDOT's long-term plans.|$|E

Environmental planning started in 1993, and construction started on the second span between Port Huron and Point Edward, Ontario in 1995. In July 1997, the second span opened.

5|$|To {{accommodate}} increased rail traffic, a new railroad terminal {{was constructed}} in 1875, {{but it was not}} large enough to consolidate all train service in one location. A replacement station, called Union Station, opened on September 1, 1894. Although Chicago had a greater volume of <b>traffic</b> <b>at</b> its own Union Station, more railroads met at St. Louis than any other city in the United States. Union Station's rail platform expanded in 1930 and operated as the passenger rail terminal for St. Louis into the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|To {{cater to}} the heavy leisure <b>traffic</b> <b>at</b> {{the end of the}} 19th century, Cromer Beach had a large station {{building}} in a half-timbered style, and a large goods yard.

Following the introduction of conductor-guard working, the ticket facilities were no longer needed and the building fell into disuse; it was renovated and reopened as a public house in 1998. A large supermarket was built {{on the site of the}} goods yards in 1991.|$|E

5|$|In 1969, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) {{designated}} the proposed expressway as I-895 {{instead of the}} originally proposed I-295. The expressway was planned to extend the existing Route 37 by , and {{was scheduled to be}} completed by 1975. In 1971, however, the expressway's original routing was canceled due to community opposition in the towns of Barrington and Warren and concerns that a new bridge across Upper Narragansett Bay would interfere with aviation <b>traffic</b> <b>at</b> T. F. Green Airport. In 1971, RIDOT submitted a new proposed alignment for I-895 that utilized the Jamestown and Newport Bridges in southern Newport County and bypassed Barrington and Warwick altogether, but the interstate was ultimately canceled in 1982.|$|E

Ain es Sir camp (south east of Es Salt, half way between the Jordan River and Amman) was found to be full of Ottoman troops, but at about midday the Ottoman garrison at Es Salt was hastily packing. Australian airmen reported the whole area east of the Jordan to be on the move towards Amman by between 15:00 and 18:00, when two Bristol Fighters bombed a mass of <b>traffic</b> <b>at</b> Suweile, half-way between Es Salt and Amman, and fired nearly 1,000 machine-gun rounds.|$|E

5|$|Route 37 {{was defined}} as the {{proposed}} Winchester By-Pass by 1963, and was included in the statewide Arterial Network when it was created in 1964. When I-81 opened past Winchester in November 1965, it included an interchange south of Winchester, taking traffic between I-81 and US 11 along a short connecting road. The north half of the bypass, from US 50 west of Winchester north and east to US 11 north of the city, opened in the late 1960s, and the semicircle was completed in the late 1970s, with the linking of Route 37 to the existing I-81/US 11 connection. A new bridge carrying southbound SR 37 over I-81 was built, but otherwise the diamond interchange was not modified. The only change to the major bypass since it was constructed has been a new trumpet interchange serving the Winchester Medical Center; construction began in September 2000 and was completed in November 2001. A single ramp from SR 37 north to Cives Lane, allowing <b>traffic</b> <b>at</b> {{the north end of the}} bypass to access US 11 south, was built in about 2000.|$|E
5|$|The Port Authority then {{proposed}} an inter-terminal rail connector at JFK in 1987. The connector, proposed {{as part of}} a $3 billion renovation of the three airports, would originate from a new five-story, $500 million transportation center, connecting all the terminals to that transportation hub. The two-track system would be able to accommodate 2,000 riders an hour and would also connect to another new structure, a $450 million terminal proposed by Pan American World Airways. The connector and transport hub were proposed to alleviate <b>traffic</b> <b>at</b> the airport, since during the previous year, all three airports had experienced an unusually large increase in passenger counts and were now accommodating 1.5 to 2 times their design capacity. This construction was proposed in conjunction with the JFK Expressway, which was already under construction. Architect Henry N. Cobb of Pei Cobb Freed & Partners created a design for the terminal and the proposed people mover system. However, the Port Authority withdrew its plans for the large transport hub in 1990 after opposition from the airlines there, which could not pay for the costly renovation.|$|E

However, these flights were cancelled due to runway safety issues (See Airlines and destinations, below). Kelowna International Airport has affected <b>traffic</b> <b>at</b> the Penticton Regional Airport, with the former providing more direct flight and connection options for travellers.
