5|$|When {{the first}} {{prototype}} Jaguar flew on 8September1968, {{it was also}} the first flight for the engine. In its initial development the Adour engine had complications with the stability of the afterburner system, and shipboard testing showed slow <b>throttle</b> <b>response</b> times, problematic in the situation of an aborted landing; engine improvements rectified these problems prior to the Jaguar coming into service. In French service, the Jaguars were introduced using the original Mk.101 engine. RAF Jaguars entered service using the Mk.102 engine, mainly featuring better afterburner-throttle control over the Mk.101. The RAF later had its Jaguars re-engined around 1981 with the improved Adour Mk.104, and again in 1999 with the Mk.106, each providing greater performance.|$|E
25|$|The Prius Plug-in {{has three}} drive modes, all-electric (EV), and two hybrid modes: Eco and Power. The EV mode is user-selectable and when running in this mode the hybrid {{engine control unit}} (ECU) {{operates}} the vehicle using only the larger motor-generator (MG2) if pre-determined parameters are satisfied, such as sufficient {{battery state of charge}} (SOC) and vehicle speed within EV mode range. The Eco mode is designed to maximize fuel savings for any driving conditions, and modifies or smoothes out the electronic throttle control program to reduce <b>throttle</b> <b>response,</b> reducing the throttle opening to a maximum of 11.6%, and also modifies the operation of the air conditioning system. As an additional benefit, the Eco mode improves performance in low-traction conditions because the reduced output helps to minimize wheel skidding such as those caused by ice and snow. Power mode increases <b>throttle</b> <b>response</b> in the middle range more than normal.|$|E
25|$|Turbocharger lag (turbo lag) is {{the time}} {{required}} to change power output in response to a throttle change, noticed as a hesitation or slowed <b>throttle</b> <b>response</b> when accelerating as compared to a naturally aspirated engine. This is due to the time needed for the exhaust system and turbocharger to generate the required boost which can also be referred to as spooling. Inertia, friction, and compressor load are the primary contributors to turbocharger lag. Superchargers do not suffer this problem, because the turbine is eliminated due to the compressor being directly powered by the engine.|$|E
5000|$|In extended-range {{electric}} vehicles, {{like those}} planned by Land-Rover/Range-Rover {{in conjunction with}} Bladon, or by Jaguar also in partnership with Bladon, the very poor <b>throttling</b> <b>response</b> (their high moment of rotational inertia) does not matter, because the gas turbine, which may be spinning at 100,000 rpm, is not directly, mechanically connected to the wheels. It was this poor <b>throttling</b> <b>response</b> that so bedevilled the 1950 Rover gas turbine-powered prototype motor car, which {{did not have the}} advantage of an intermediate electric drive train to provide sudden power spikes when demanded by the driver.|$|R

25|$|In 1979, McDonnell Douglas and F-15 radar manufacturer, Hughes, teamed to privately {{develop a}} strike fighter {{version of the}} F-15. This version competed in the Air Force's Dual-Role Fighter {{competition}} starting in 1982. The Boeing F-15E strike variant was selected for production over General Dynamics' competing F-16XL in 1984. Beginning in 1985, F-15C and D models were equipped with the improved P F100-PW-220 engine and digital engine controls, providing quicker <b>throttle</b> <b>response,</b> reduced wear, and lower fuel consumption. Starting in 1997, original F100-PW-100 engines were upgraded to a similar configuration with the designation F100-PW-220E starting.|$|E
25|$|The plane had, by {{contemporary}} standards, a high wing loading (294.0kg/m2, 60.2lbs/ft2) that required higher takeoff and landing speeds. Due to poor <b>throttle</b> <b>response,</b> the engines' tendency for airflow disruption {{that could cause}} the compressor to stall was ubiquitous. The high speed of the Me 262 also presented problems when engaging enemy aircraft, the high-speed convergence allowing Me 262 pilots little time to line up their targets or acquire the appropriate amount of deflection. This problem faces any aircraft that approaches another from behind at much higher speed, as the slower aircraft in front can always pull a tighter turn, forcing the faster aircraft to overshoot.|$|E
25|$|The Evoque was {{equipped}} with either two-wheel drive or a generation IV Haldex permanent Four-wheel drive system until the 2014 model year update when the Haldex system was replaced by two optional All-Wheel Drive Systems (Standard Driveline or Active Driveline) by GKN Driveline. The Evoque also comes standard with Land Rover's latest version of Terrain Response, which maximises traction {{in a variety of}} conditions by altering <b>throttle</b> <b>response,</b> power distribution, and suspension settings. The Terrain Response system also includes electronic stability control, roll stability control, traction control, and an optional hill descent control which automatically applies braking to control speed when moving down an incline.|$|E
5000|$|Trials after 1945 by the Royal Navy {{revealed}} that the new jet aircraft had slow <b>throttle</b> <b>responses</b> and could not safely use the standard deck landing technique then in use. Even in peacetime, carrier operations killed 20% of the aircrew. Goodhart therefore invented the mirror-sight deck landing system in 1951. [...] The device was first introduced in the Royal Navy in 1954 and by the US Navy in 1955. It greatly increased the safety when landing on an aircraft carrier. There was also a saving in arrester gear units and barriers - Ark Royal needed only four wires and one (emergency only) barrier. The reduction in weight and the extra space that this conferred enabled more mess-decks to be fitted in, thus reducing congestion in living spaces. It was recorded that for US carriers, the landing accident rate fell by 80% from 35 per 10,000 landings in 1954 to 7 per 10,000 landings in 1957. The US Navy awarded him the Legion of Merit for his invention and he received an undisclosed sum from the Admiralty.|$|R
5000|$|The {{centrifugal}} governor of a steam engine, as designed by James Watt in 1788, reduces the <b>throttle</b> valve in <b>response</b> {{to increases in}} the engine speed, or opens the valve if the speed falls below the pre-set rate.|$|R
50|$|Aston Martin {{has also}} {{developed}} an Adaptive Damping System, or ADS, which alters the suspension {{in order for}} the car to cope with the driver's desires and road/weather conditions. When turned on, the ADS automatically alters the suspension settings to ensure the driver has high levels of control at all times. Apart from the suspension getting stiffer, <b>throttle</b> and braking <b>response</b> is increased and steering is sharpened.|$|R
25|$|The Me 262 was {{difficult}} to counter because its high speed and rate of climb {{made it hard to}} intercept. However, as with other turbojet engines at the time, the Me 262's engines did not provide sufficient thrust at low air speeds and <b>throttle</b> <b>response</b> was slow, meaning in certain circumstances such as takeoff and landing, the aircraft became a vulnerable target. Another disadvantage that pioneering jet aircraft of the World War II era shared, was the high risk of compressor stall and if throttle movements were too rapid, the engine(s) could suffer a flame out. The coarse opening of the throttle would cause fuel surging and lead to excessive jet pipe temperatures. Pilots were instructed to operate the throttle gently and avoid quick changes. German engineers introduced an automatic throttle regulator later in the war but it only partly alleviated the problem.|$|E
25|$|Häkkinen {{made his}} first test in a Formula One car with the Benetton team driving 90 laps around the Silverstone Circuit and set quicker lap times than regular driver Alessandro Nannini. He found it {{difficult}} to fit into the Benetton but liked the steering and <b>throttle</b> <b>response.</b> Häkkinen expected not to be offered a seat at Benetton and he decided to sign with the Lotus team for the 1991 season. Making his debut in the United States alongside teammate Julian Bailey, Häkkinen qualified thirteenth on the grid and suffered an engine failure on the sixtieth lap and was classified thirteenth. The next race at Brazil saw him finish ninth, and scored his first Formula One points by reaching fifth place in San Marino. Häkkinen suffered from a dip in race form as he encountered consecutive retirements in the next two races—his car suffered from an oil leak in Monaco and spun out in Canada. Before Canada, Bailey lost his seat at Lotus {{due to a lack of}} funding, so Häkkinen was partnered by Johnny Herbert and Michael Bartels throughout the remainder of the season.|$|E
500|$|Autocar's Andrew Frankel was {{the first}} {{journalist}} to road-test the car and reported: [...] "Savage acceleration really is a given here.

[...] He was particularly impressed with the <b>throttle</b> <b>response,</b> the driver's ability to control the performance of the car very precisely, {{and the way in which}} the engine delivers its power progressively rather than in one short burst.|$|E
40|$|Moore’s Law {{has allowed}} {{processor}} performance to double approximately every 18 months due to continuous breakthroughs in transistor technology. Although processor performance is paramount to high-performance computing, {{the world of}} embedded systems has other priorities: namely the minimization of power and silicon area. Moreover, embedded systems often communicate via wireless networks with limited bandwidth and have limited communication and memory resources. The shrewd design of embedded systems, however, can make efficient use of limited resources through efficient and effective reconfiguration schemes that balance the tradeoffs between power consumption, memory consumption, and interoperability in heterogeneous environments. Several of these projects are discussed here {{in the context of}} a reconfigurable fabric—literally, a wearable motherboard—as well as several customizable medical devices. Adaptive algorithms for communication <b>throttling</b> in <b>response</b> to dynamic environmental changes are also described. Lastly, we highlight the need to reprogram embedded systems following an extended period of time already employed in their respective environments.

40|$|This report {{deals with}} the {{simulation}} of ground controlled approaches and describes an investigation into possible defects zn the system which might lead to accidents. Two such accidents are described and {{in both of these}} the aircraft built up long period expanding oscillations about the glide path. This motion is then investigated by simulation techniques and its causes determined. The trouble is found to be inherent in the technique of using the throttle to control height and the elevator to control speed. This is demonstrated by systematic use of the <b>throttle</b> in <b>response</b> to height errors according to various logical schemes. It ia found that, in certain circumstances, entirely logical use of the throttle results in an oscillation of increasing amplitude no matter bon successfully the pilot controls speed with the elevators. It 1 s concluded that accidents have sometimes resulted from use of the throttle to control height. Finally, a simple device is described, which led to a different flying technique giving much improved control of an aircraft making a blind approach. It consisted of an auxiliary spring;loaded throttle control. Flight tests of this device are strongly recommended. Replaces A. R. C. 24 545 - 2...|$|R
40|$|Lack of {{a locally}} {{trustworthy}} clock makes security protocols challenging to implement on batteryless embedded {{devices such as}} contact smartcards, contactless smartcards, and RFID tags. A device that knows how much time has elapsed between queries from an untrusted reader could better protect against attacks that depend {{on the existence of}} a rate-unlimited encryption oracle. The TARDIS (Time and Remanence Decay in SRAM) helps locally maintain a sense of time elapsed without power and without special-purpose hardware. The TARDIS software computes the expiration state of a timer by analyzing the decay of existing on-chip SRAM. The TARDIS enables coarse-grained, hourglass-like timers such that cryptographic software can more deliberately decide how to <b>throttle</b> its <b>response</b> rate. Our experiments demonstrate that the TARDIS can measure time ranging from seconds to several hours depending on hardware parameters. Key challenges to implementing a practical TARDIS include compensating for temperature and handling variation across hardware. Our contributions are (1) the algorithmic building blocks for computing elapsed time from SRAM decay; (2) characterizing TARDIS behavior under different temperatures, capacitors, SRAM sizes, and chips; and (3) three proof-of-concept implementations that use the TARDIS to enable privacy-preserving RFID tags, to deter double swiping of contactless credit cards, and to increase the difficulty of brute-force attacks against e-passports. ...|$|R
500|$|An [...] "M" [...] {{prototype}} flew in November 1969. The [...] "M" [...] had a strengthened airframe, an arrestor {{hook and}} different undercarriage: twin nosewheel and single mainwheels.

500|$|The 1995 VS Commodore {{served as}} a {{mechanical}} update of the VR, destined to maintain sales momentum {{before the arrival of}} an all-new VT model. The extent of exterior changes amounted to little more than a redesigned Holden logo and wheel trims.

The Ecotec engine packed 13percent more power for a total of , cut fuel consumption by 5percent, increased the compression ratio from 9.0:1 to 9.4:1 and improved on the engine's previous rough characteristics. Holden mated the new engine with {{a modified version of the}} GM 4L60-E automatic transmission, improving <b>throttle</b> <b>response</b> and smoothing gear changes. The Series II update of June 1996 included elliptical side turn signals, interior tweaks and the introduction of a supercharged V6 engine for selected trim levels, and the introduction of a new Getrag manual transmission.

50|$|From the pilot's {{point of}} view, after 25 seconds of flight, noise, bangs and {{vibrations}} caused by No. 2 engine (the right engine) being in surge were first noticed.

As a consequence, the engine surges continued. SAS flight captain Per Holmberg, who was on board as a passenger, noticed the problems early and hurried to the cockpit to assist the crew.

30|$|An {{overview}} of the factor barriers to innovation in the GNSI highlights four major recurrent policy dimensions that restrain innovation and prevent innovativeness in the Ghana economy. They are characterised as follows: the deficiencies in human capital skills related particularly to ICT capability and capacity could be considered as an “organisational capital” dimension (Hong et al. 2008; Vashishtha and Sharma 2011). The GNSI suffers from low concentrations of organisational capital which prevents system-wide combinations of skills and assets for significant productivity enhancement based on science, technology, engineering, mathematics and information technology. The lack of innovating and demanding customers and the insufficiency in the level and quality of demand is the “market demand” dimension. This deficiency dissuades the manufacturing and service sectors from innovating in order to offer products of enhanced qualities and values. According to Porter (1990), {{in the absence of}} sufficient policy capacity and capability to influence the NSI competiveness, resource-constrained developing countries would be better off concentrating on ensuring that markets work properly with respect to increasing sophistication of supply and demand, industry rivalry and related and supporting industries. “Organisational constraints” is considered as the third dimension. This points to the investment risks perceived and managerial rigidities that <b>throttle</b> the adaptive <b>response</b> mechanisms in the behaviour of the GNSI actors, who are moreover prevented from responding adequately and competitively to market signals (Pech and Oakley 2005; Schumpeter 1947). The last dimension named “fiscal and monetary deficiencies” depicts financial shortfalls with respect to supporting risk in innovation in general and innovative processes specifically {{in the early stages of}} ideation, invention and start-up and launch of new businesses.|$|R
40|$|Platooning, or {{controlled}} management of vehicle formation, enables multiple {{vehicles equipped with}} adaptive cruise control systems to drive behind one another with a specified inter-vehicle distance, acting together as one unit. In a platoon, the leading vehicle drives at a constant speed, independent of the following vehicles. The succeeding vehicles try to emulate this speed and maintain a following distance based on the most forward vehicle. To facilitate platoon implementation, an efficient control system that specifies to each vehicle the safe following distance and corresponding velocity is indispensable. Delays that are prevalent in <b>throttle</b> and brake <b>response,</b> {{as well as in}} vehicle control systems, can significantly increase the complexity of such an effective design, namely in that delays are often be unpredictable and time-varying. ^ This thesis presents a distributed cooperative control system that considers heterogeneous vehicles to improve the safety and stability of multi-vehicle platoons under the presence of delays. Moreover, multiple control schemes including those based on adaptive cruise control and cooperative adaptive cruise control algorithms are evaluated through the development of several simulations. All simulations are designed pragmatically to consider speed limits and restrictions on the maximum acceleration and deceleration rates vehicles can attain. As such, heterogeneous vehicle dynamics, including that of acceleration and braking capacities, as well as actuation, sensor, and communication delays, are incorporated. Further, this thesis presents a novel distributed control scheme that compensates for time-varying delays under the IQC framework. The results exemplify that platoon stability is significantly influenced by the control structure and that the IQC based delay compensation allows for the preservation of platoon stability with relatively small inter-vehicle distances. ...|$|R

5000|$|In January 1990 UKs Car Magazine ran a {{comparison}} of the 2.0 Si against the BMW 520i and Lancia Thema 16V 2.0 in a review of lower-end executive sector cars. The article says, [...] "Citroen expects business buyers to account for 80% of the 9000 XMs it hopes to shift in 1990... This is the middle trim level of a range that is extremely well-equipped, presumably as an inducement to forget your preconceptions." [...] CAR called the XM [...] "a rather exotic dish for executives raised on a staple of Granadas, Carltons, Rovers." [...] The theme of polarizing styling was repeated in the 1990 review: [...] "Anyone who feared that Citroens individuality might perish in PSA Groups drive for increased sales and profitability will be heartened by the XM. Theres a touch of love it or loathe it about the styling, but theres no denying that it is striking." [...] The slim Valeo headlamps design helped to make feasible the [...] "low, penetrating front end" [...] styling. While the Citroën had a drag coefficient of 0.28, the BMW 520s was 0.30 and the Lancias was 0.32. The article explained that the UK market XMs were not fitted with the self-centering power-steering because [...] "buyers here dont like it." [...] Regarding performance, the Lancia recorded a 0-60 mph time of 9.6 seconds versus 12.4 for the Citroën and 10.6 for the BMW. The Thema was [...] "the most mettlesome of the trio" [...] due to sharp <b>throttle</b> <b>responses</b> and engine sound quality. The XM was marked down for the coarseness of the 2.0-litre XU series engine which was [...] "rough and noisy. Theres no pleasure to be gained from revving it hard. Yet this is precisely what you must do to proceed with any sort of haste." [...] Performance was reckoned to be [...] "par for the class. Above 80 mph acceleration falls off dramatically, a victim of a tall top gear." [...] The fuel economy of all three cars was considered [...] "poor" [...] under test conditions. The XMs braking action was [...] "the least satisfactory of the group." [...] Under roadholding, [...] "the XM introduces a new motoring experience to those who dont work as engineers on active ride projects - the flat cornering attitude. In medium speed bends, the XM scurries around with little discernable body roll, wheels upright and all four tyres planted firmly on the tarmac. Body roll isnt entirely cancelled out, though as Hydractive doesnt act as an anti-roll bar, it merely stiffens spring and damper rates. In tight, fast corners the XM leans like any conventional car. When grip from the XMs 195/60 Michelin MXV2s runs out the Citroen starts to understeer gently. The tail can feel a bit light if you lift off part of the way around the corner, but its a sensation that doesnt develop into anything more sinister." [...] The steering was criticized for lack of feel at high speeds. The XM cabin was praised for its solid quality and roominess though the Lancia was reckoned to be as wide and had as much front head room and rear legroom. The BMW was comparatively less spacious. [...] "Rear seat riders are best off in the XM, where they enjoy the most headroom of the group ... put the centre armrest down, and there is a soft armchair quality to the seats. The front chairs are similar, yet they manage to locate you well when pressing on, and remain comfortable on long journeys." [...] About the ride quality the reviewer wrote that [...] "the XMs ride quality is a big disappointment, especially at low speeds. Fractured urban road surfaces make it thud noisily, while it pummels rather than absorbs, the contusions. Its jittery around town and will slap its tyres over ridges. A BX feels more composed in the same conditions. At higher speeds the XM is more impressive." [...] In comparison, the BMW was reckoned to have a [...] "ride superior to that of the Citroen." [...] There were [...] "occasional flashes of brilliance from the XMs chassis, but {{for the majority of the}} time it is outshone by the BMW." [...] Under driver appeal, the relatively thick a-pillar, foot-operated park brake and obstructed passenger-side mirror came in for criticism. To drive the car [...] "practice is required to drive it fluidly." [...] On the inside [...] "the XMs cabin is cossetting and is a relaxing place to spend a full day of motorway driving. The quality of trim is easily the best ever to adorn a Citroen, and looks plusher than that of the plainer BMW." [...] The conclusion of the article was that the BMW won the test against [...] "all comers in the 2.0 litre class", primarily for its completeness and engineering quality. But [...] "in spite of its faults you cant help be intrigued by the XM. You get the feeling that there is a lot to be learned about the car over an extended period of ownership, a hidden facet that can only be revealed by familiarity. And theres the satisfaction of driving a car that looks so distinctive."

2500|$|Unlike races {{such as the}} TT Formulae, or Moto-Cross, {{where two}} and four strokes had {{different}} engine size limits in the same class, until 2002 GP racing set the upper limit the same for both types of engines in all its classes.

2500|$|The {{aerodynamic}} concept worked, in {{that the}} car produced plenty of downforce without increasing drag which allowed the cars to run less wing and be among the fastest {{in a straight line}} at the faster tracks like Hockenheim, Monza and the Österreichring (where Warwick was actually the quickest through the speed trap at [...] heading into the Bosch Kurve). However, the tilted over engine and specially designed gearbox also produced many reliability problems including oil surge and a lack of <b>throttle</b> <b>response</b> that only compounded the already poor response of the BMW turbo (four cylinder turbos generally suffered more 'turbo lag' as a result of only using a single turbocharger, while V6 and V8 engines used twin turbos and suffered less lag). This saw the Brabhams off the pace on the slower circuits such as Monaco (where de Angelis qualified 20th and last for his final race, though amazingly Patrese managed to qualify 6th), Detroit, and the then new circuits of Jerez and the Hungaroring where acceleration counted for more than outright speed. The team scored just two points all season, both by driver Riccardo Patrese with sixth placings in San Marino and Detroit. It should be noted that, as in 1985, the Brabham's performance was severely hampered by inconsistent Pirelli race tyres.|$|E

Although the engine gains only [...] torque over the VQ35HR and this torque value arrives at a later 5,200 rpm vs. 4,800 in the VQ35HR, the torque curve itself is improved and flattened across the rpm range via Nissan's new VVEL (Variable Valve Event and Lift) variable valve timing resulting in better <b>throttle</b> <b>response</b> and low rpm torque. The G37s VQ37VHR engine has been touted by car magazines and reviewers as an improvement over the VQ35HR engine mostly adding much more refinement and smoother engine operation, especially at high rpm where the VQ35HR engine was frequently criticized for NVH and sounding strained, harsh and loud. The often criticized too aggressive clutch engagement, notchiness of the 6-speed manual in the G35 and engine vibrations transferred through the shifter and pedals in the G35 6MT cars was also addressed in the new G37 models.|$|E
