40|$|As {{widely known}} the RA- 2 data are {{affected}} by the socalled "S-Band anomaly " discovered {{in the early days of}} the Commissioning Phase. As described in [1] it consists in the accumulation of the S-Band echo waveforms that starts, apparently randomly, after an instrument Acquisition phase. Investigation is on going to try and find the instrumental cause of this behavior but in the meantime the data affected by this anomaly are completely unusable. For this reason the need has arisen for the users to be able to detect the anomalous data and eventually reconstruct a usable signal from them. This paper describes the algorithm developed for the L 1 b processor that allows <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>flag</b> identifying the data affected by the "S-Band anomaly “ and reconstruct normal echo waveforms to be then ingested in the nominal re-tracking procedure at L 2.

40|$|PredGuid+A {{software}} {{was developed to}} enable a unique numerical predictor-corrector aerocapture guidance capability that builds on heritage Orion entry guidance algorithms. The software {{can be used for}} both planetary entry and aerocapture applications. Furthermore, PredGuid+A implements a new Delta-V minimization guidance option that can take the place of traditional targeting guidance and can result in substantial propellant savings. PredGuid+A allows the user <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>a</b> mode <b>flag</b> and input <b>a</b> target orbit's apoapsis and periapsis. Using bank angle control, the guidance will then guide the vehicle to the appropriate post-aerocapture orbit using one of two algorithms: Apoapsis Targeting or Delta-V Minimization (as chosen by the user). Recently, the PredGuid guidance algorithm was adapted for use in skip-entry scenarios for NASA's Orion multi-purpose crew vehicle (MPCV). To leverage flight heritage, most of Orion's entry guidance routines are adapted from the Apollo program...|$|R

40|$|A system {{compresses}} image blocks via successive hierarchical {{stages and}} motion encoders which employ caches updated by stack replacement algorithms. Initially, a background detector compares the present image block with a corresponding previously encoded image block and if similar, the background detector terminates the encoding procedure by <b>setting</b> <b>a</b> <b>flag</b> bit. Otherwise, the image block is decomposed into smaller present image subblocks. The smaller present image subblocks are each {{compared with a}} corresponding previously encoded image subblock of comparable size within the present image block. When a present image subblock {{is similar to a}} corresponding previously encoded image subblock, then the procedure is terminated by <b>setting</b> <b>a</b> <b>flag</b> bit. Alternatively, the present image subblock is forwarded to a motion encoder where it is compared with displaced image subblocks, which are formed by displacing previously encoded image subblocks by motion vectors that are stored in a cache, to derive a first distortion vector. When the first distortion vector is below a first threshold TM, the procedure is terminated and the present image subblock is encoded by <b>setting</b> <b>flag</b> bit and <b>a</b> cache index corresponding to the first distortion vector.
