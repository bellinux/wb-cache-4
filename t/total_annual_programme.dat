40|$|Inventory model under {{risk that}} demand is {{uncertain}} is recognized. In this paper, the fuzzy demand {{per day and}} fuzzy lead time on a cycle in fuzzy inventory control system are assumed to trapezoidal distribution, trapezoidal fuzzy number by decision maker. A fuzzy inventory model under manager’s preference for order quantity is presented first. This model is given by fuzzy <b>total</b> <b>annual</b> inventory cost summating of <b>total</b> <b>annual</b> holding cost and fuzzy <b>total</b> <b>annual</b> setup cost. We obtain the optimal order quantity by using both Function Principle and Graded Mean Integration Representation method for both computing and representing fuzzy <b>total</b> <b>annual</b> inventory cost. The number of orders in a year, then, is getting by the above optimal order quantity. In addition, we get the reorder point and safety stock under a unit service level by manager. Furthermore, we also introduce a fuzzy inventory model under safety stock based on fuzzy <b>total</b> <b>annual</b> safety stock cost combined by <b>total</b> <b>annual</b> holding cost of safety stock and fuzzy <b>total</b> <b>annual</b> stockout cost. Fuzzy average demand in lead time, mean, thus is calculated by using Graded Mean Integration Representation method. Moreover, we find the optimal reorder point and the optimal safety stock of our second proposed model...|$|R

30|$|The {{climate of}} the area is {{characterized}} by hot and moist sub-humid i.e., hot summers and cool winters. <b>Total</b> <b>annual</b> rainfall ranged from 993.5 to 1901.8  mm (average of 1995 to 2010 rainfall data) {{with an average of}} 1509.2  mm (CV 14.8 %). <b>Total</b> <b>annual</b> effective rainfall was estimated as 858.2  mm which is 56.9 % of the <b>total</b> <b>annual</b> rainfall. The normal southwest monsoon, which delivers about 75.7 % of annual rainfall, extends from June to September of the year.

40|$|Aim: To {{estimate}} annual {{direct and}} indirect costs for patients diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and subtypes. Methods: Patients completed a standardized questionnaire concerning usage of healthcare resources, travel costs, meals, and productivity loss of patients when seeking treatment for IBS. <b>Total</b> <b>annual</b> costs per patient were calculated as the sum of direct (including medical and nonmedical) and indirect costs. <b>Total</b> <b>annual</b> costs per patient among various IBS subtypes were compared. Analysis of variance and bootstrapped independent sample t -tests were performed to determine differences between groups after controlling for IBS subtypes. Results: A total of 105 IBS patients (64. 80 % female), mean age of 57. 12 years ± 10. 31 years), mean disease duration of 4. 31 years ± 5. 40 years, were included. <b>Total</b> <b>annual</b> costs per patient were estimated as CNY 18262. 84 (USD 2933. 08). Inpatient and outpatient healthcare use were major cost drivers, accounting for 46. 41 %and 23. 36 % of <b>total</b> <b>annual</b> costs, respectively. Productivity loss accounted for 25. 32 % of <b>total</b> <b>annual</b> costs. The proportions of {{direct and indirect}} costs were similar to published studies in other countries. Nationally, the total costs of managing IBS would amount to CNY 123. 83 billion (USD 1. 99 billion). Among the IBS subtypes, <b>total</b> <b>annual</b> costs per patient of IBS-M was highest at CNY 18891. 18 (USD 3034). Furthermore, there was significant difference in productivity loss among IBS subtypes (P = 0. 031). Conclusion: IBS imposes a huge economic burden on patients and healthcare systems, which could account for 3. 3 % of the total healthcare budget for the entire Chinese nation. More than two-thirds of <b>total</b> <b>annual</b> costs of IBS consist of inpatient and outpatient healthcare use. Among the subtypes, IBS-M patients appear to have the greatest economic burden but require further confirmation...|$|R
