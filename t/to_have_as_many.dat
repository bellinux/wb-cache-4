Their troops consisted of Seljuq Turks, Arabs, Persians, Kurds, and Ethiopians, led by vizier al-Afdal Shahanshah. Opposing them were the crusaders, whose numbers, estimated by Raymond of Aguilers, were around 1,200 knights and 9,000 infantry.|$|E
5|$|In a 2009 {{paper on}} the affinities of Gondwanatheria, Yamila Gurovich and Robin Beck argue that the {{difference}} in shape between MACN-RN 975 and Argentodites is due to extensive wear on the former specimen; they write that {{the parts of the}} p4 that are not worn are virtually identical to the equivalents parts of the Argentodites p4. In addition, MACN-RN 975 is said <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> ridges as Argentodites and to be of approximately similar size—about 15% larger. They allocate MACN-RN 975 to the gondwanathere Ferugliotherium and consequently, they argue that Argentodites most likely represents either Ferugliotherium or some related species. In the same year, Guillermo Rougier and colleagues also suggested ferugliotherian affinities of Argentodites in a {{paper on the}} mammals of the Allen Formation, another Cretaceous rock unit of Argentina. Ferugliotherium is a gondwanathere from Late Cretaceous Argentinean deposits. Gondwanatheres are a small and enigmatic group from the late Cretaceous and Paleogene of South America, Antarctica, Madagascar, India, and perhaps Tanzania. Although the evolutionary affinities of gondwanatheres are controversial, both teams that identified Argentodites as gondwanathere believe gondwanatheres are likely themselves multituberculates or closely related to them.|$|E

25|$|The 20th-century one-drop rule made it {{relatively}} {{difficult for}} anyone of known Black ancestry {{to be accepted}} as White. The child of an African-American sharecropper and a White person was considered Black by the local communities. In terms of the economics of sharecropping, such a person also would likely become a sharecropper as well, thus adding to the landholder or employer's labor force. In short, this theory suggests that in a 20th-century economy that benefited from sharecropping, it was useful <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> Blacks as possible.|$|E

25|$|For recent genealogy, exact {{matching}} on the mtDNA {{full sequence}} {{is used to}} confirm a common ancestor on the direct maternal line between two suspected relatives. Because mtDNA mutations are very rare, a nearly perfect match is not usually considered relevant {{to the most recent}} 1 to 16 generations. In cultures lacking matrilineal surnames to pass down, neither relative above is likely <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> generations of ancestors in their matrilineal information table as in the above patrilineal or Y-DNA case: for further information on this difficulty in traditional genealogy, due to lack of matrilineal surnames (or matrinames), see Matriname. However, the foundation of testing is still two suspected descendants of one person. This hypothesize and test DNA pattern is the same one used for autosomal DNA and Y-DNA.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} {{classification system}} for para-swimming was created during the 1940s. At this time, swimmers were classified {{based on their}} medical conditions. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the classification system was set up {{as a series of}} [...] "handicaps". In an effort to clearly describe disabilities and promote fairness, the number of classifications ballooned. This made organizing competitive events difficult as there were too few people in each classification; international events for people with disabilities were said <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> winners as competitors. At the 1988 Summer Paralympics in Seoul, the number of eligible classes was so great that 60 gold medals were awarded in one swimming event.|$|E

500|$|During the 1960s, {{sales of}} singles in the UK were {{monitored}} by several magazines, including New Musical Express (NME), Record Retailer, Melody Maker and Disc. Before 1969, no officially recognised singles chart {{was published in}} the UK. Until 10 March 1960, chart compilers used the weekly chart listed by NME, after which they moved to the singles list published by Record Retailer, despite NME having the wider circulation and higher readership. During the start of the decade, Record Retailer was sampling roughly 30 stores; NME and Melody Maker had a sample size of more than one hundred. One source explains that the reason for using the Record Retailer chart for the early 1960s was that it was [...] "the only chart <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> as 50 positions for almost the entire decade". On 15 February 1969, Record Retailer and the BBC jointly commissioned the British Market Research Bureau (BMRB) to record sales of singles in what officially became the UK Singles Chart. The BMRB compiled the chart by using hand-written and post-submitted data from approximately 250 record stores.|$|E

500|$|During {{the process}} of {{founding}} a colony, {{as many as four}} queens cooperate with each other to find a suitable nesting ground, but after the first generation of workers is born, they fight each other until one queen is left alive. However, occasional colonies are known <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> as six queens coexisting peacefully in the presence of workers. A queen searches for a suitable nest site to establish her colony, and excavates a small chamber in the soil or under logs and rocks, where she takes care of her young. A queen also hunts for prey instead of staying in her nest, a behaviour known as claustral colony founding. Although queens do provide sufficient amounts of food to feed their larvae, the first workers are [...] "nanitics" [...] (or minims), smaller than the smallest workers encountered in older developed colonies. Several species do not have any worker caste, and solitary queens will raid a colony, kill the residing queen, and take over the colony. The first generation of workers may take a while to fully develop into adults; for example, M. forficata eggs take around 100 days to fully develop, while other species may take up to eight months.|$|E

500|$|The UK Singles Chart is the {{official}} record chart in the United Kingdom. Prior to 1969 there was no official singles chart; however, The Official Charts Company and Guinness' British Hit Singles & Albums regard the canonical sources as New Musical Express (NME) before 10 March 1960 and Record Retailer from then until 15 February 1969 when Retailer and the BBC jointly commissioned the British Market Research Bureau (BMRB) to compile the charts. The choice to use Record Retailer as the canonical source for the 1960s has been contentious because NME (which continued compiling charts beyond March 1960) had the biggest circulation of periodicals in the decade and was more widely followed. As well as the chart compilers mentioned previously, Melody Maker, Disc and Record Mirror all compiled their own charts during the decade. Due {{to the lack of}} any official chart the BBC aggregated results from all these charts to announce its own Pick of the Pops chart. One source explains that the reason for using the Record Retailer chart for the 1960s was that it was [...] "the only chart <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> as 50 positions for almost the entire decade". The sample size of Record Retailer in the early 1960s was around 30 stores whereas NME and Melody Maker were sampling over 100 stores. In 1969, the first BMRB chart was compiled using postal returns of sales logs from 250 record shops.|$|E
