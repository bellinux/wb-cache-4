5|$|At William P. Hobby Airport in Houston, 11planes {{were damaged}} when a hangar collapsed, {{resulting}} in losses of $250,000. Hermann Park was also {{affected by the}} storm, where nine goats began <b>to</b> <b>roam</b> within the park due to a broken fence caused by a fallen limb. 35convicts were freed from the Ramsey Unit state prison during the storm due to the chance of the prison collapsing. However, after the storm, only eight returned to the prison, leaving 27others missing.|$|E
5|$|Farm {{animals are}} {{widespread}} {{in books and}} songs for children; the reality of animal husbandry is often distorted, softened, or idealized, giving children an almost entirely fictitious account of farm life. The books often depict a rural idyll of happy animals free <b>to</b> <b>roam</b> in attractive countryside, which is completely {{at odds with the}} realities of the impersonal, mechanized activities involved in modern intensive farming.|$|E
5|$|Hog Island was colonized in the 17th century. The sheep that colonists {{would have}} been using at the time {{would have been}} the {{contemporary}} English breeds, but Merinos were known <b>to</b> <b>roam</b> the barrier islands, taken there by Spanish ships that wrecked and let the sheep loose. The colonists would have used some combination of these sheep in their flocks.|$|E

50|$|Users of {{the network}} can use {{advanced}} services {{all over the world}} due <b>to</b> <b>roaming</b> agreements with 350 GSM and 130 UMTS international networks. 23% {{of the network}} users are business customers, 29% are pre-paid customers and the rest are private post-paid customers.|$|R
5|$|Most {{recreation}} {{takes place}} around Lake Inari, although {{a limited number}} of visitors hike into the fells. The reserve is a demanding hiking area and inexperienced hikers are recommended to avoid traversing the wilderness. The freedom <b>to</b> <b>roam</b> grants everyone the right to hike, ski and short-term camping everywhere in the area. The park can be accessed from National Road 971 and 969; public transport is available to Nellim.|$|E
5|$|Players can pan {{around a}} map {{as the camera}} focuses on areas of intense fighting, and the Ghost Cam allows a player <b>to</b> <b>roam</b> freely around a map. The ability to take {{photographs}} is also featured, which enables the player to take a photo, which can be uploaded to the Gears of War website and is rated {{on the quality of}} action in the shot.|$|E
5|$|Beat 'em up games usually employ vigilante crime {{fighting}} and revenge plots with the action {{taking place on}} city streets, though historical and fantasy themed games also exist. Players must walk {{from one end of}} the game world to the other, and thus each game level will usually scroll horizontally. Some later beat 'em ups dispense with 2D-based scrolling levels, instead allowing the player <b>to</b> <b>roam</b> around larger 3D environments, though they retain the same simple gameplay and control systems. Throughout the level, players may acquire weapons that they can use as well as power-ups that replenish the player's health.|$|E
50|$|Increasingly, data {{services}} are being added <b>to</b> <b>roaming</b> SIM cards <b>to</b> {{reduce the cost}} of roaming data charges. Mobile users are increasingly using {{data services}} and it can be very difficult to predict the cost of using data because it is invoiced based on volume.|$|R
50|$|P-Visited-Network-ID: Identification {{string of}} the visited network.

40|$|Towards the {{deployment}} of 3 rd generation systems, Virtual Home Environment (VHE), stemming from 3 GPP, {{appears to be a}} powerful concept advocating the provision and delivery of personalized services <b>to</b> <b>roaming</b> users across network and terminal boundaries. This paper aims to expose the pathway for materializing the VHE concept, via the specification, implementation and evaluation of a prototype. Core aspects for realizing the concept such as the business and roaming models are presented, while a VHE enabling architecture utilizing key technologies (OSA/Parlay, MExE, and USAT) is introduced. The proposed architecture has already been evaluated by performing an initial trial demonstration. Currently it is being extended to support VHE service provision <b>to</b> <b>roaming</b> users, an aspect to be addressed by the final trial...|$|R
5|$|Beatrice spoke several {{languages}} {{and played the}} piano, and Mark played banjo and guitar, liked photography (winning an Evening Standard award), and took part in numerous sports. He was very fond of animals (working for the RSPCA for a time), and Mills remembered her family always having a dog and a cat, as well as once having a pet goose and a white nanny goat that was allowed <b>to</b> <b>roam</b> the house owned by Mark's parents in Libanus, near Brecon.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, Duncan Wood, the BBC's Head of Comedy, {{watched a}} comedy on {{television}} called The Misfit. Impressed by writer Roy Clarke's ability to inject both comedy and drama into the sitcom, Wood offered Clarke {{the opportunity to}} write a sitcom. Clarke nearly turned the job down as {{he felt that the}} BBC's idea for a programme about three old men was a dull concept for a half-hour sitcom. Instead, Clarke proposed that the men should all be unmarried, widowed, or divorced and either unemployed or retired, leaving them free <b>to</b> <b>roam</b> around like adolescents in the prime of their lives, unfettered and uninhibited.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to game, mutton was consumed {{from time to}} time. Keeping sheep provided wool to the household, and when a sheep reached an age when it was unsuitable for wool production, it could be harvested as mutton. Sheep were originally introduced to the Americas through the Spanish in Florida. In the north, the Dutch and English also introduced several varieties of sheep. The casual English practice of animal husbandry allowed sheep <b>to</b> <b>roam</b> free, consuming a variety of forage. Foragebased diets produce meat with a characteristically strong, gamey flavor and a tough consistency, which requires aging and slow cooking to tenderize.|$|E

5|$|As in all Norwegian {{national}} parks, motorized {{land transport}} is banned. However, on Svalbard {{this does not}} include snowmobiles. On the other hand, cycling is banned. The Governor can, however, enforce temporary bans on snowmobiles or even all travel within the national park. Use of helicopters and aircraft for sight-seeing are also prohibited. Polar bears are protected, but anyone outside of settlements is required to carry a rifle to kill polar bears in self-defense, as a last resort, should they attack. Most flora and fauna are protected; the right to gather established with the freedom <b>to</b> <b>roam</b> does not apply in national parks, although there are some exceptions. Hunting is permitted after explicit permit from the Governor, and locals have more access to hunting rights than tourists. Fishing is not permitted, although dispensations can be given.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the arrival}} of Europeans in the area, {{wildebeest}} used <b>to</b> <b>roam</b> widely, probably in relation to {{the arrival of}} the rains and the availability of good forage. They never made such extensive migrations as the blue wildebeest but at one time, they used to cross the Drakensberg Range, moving eastwards in autumn, searching for good pastures. Then they returned to the highvelds in the spring and moved towards the west, where sweet potato and Karoo vegetation were abundant. They also moved from north to south as the sourgrass found north of the Vaal River matured and became unpalatable, the wildebeest only consuming young shoots of sourgrass. Nowadays, almost all black wildebeest are in reserves or on farms and the extent of their movements is limited.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} years Metallica played in small festivals and as {{supporting}} acts on tours for bands such as Venom. Since their very first live gig at Radio City, Anaheim on March 14, 1982, Metallica has performed on all populated continents numbering live events every year (with the exception of 2001) {{in a total of}} over 1,600 shows. The majority of these were played in the United States, but numerous concerts were also played in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Germany, among other countries. The band also went on seven worldwide tours: Damage, Inc. Tour (1986–1987), Damaged Justice (1988–1989), Wherever We May Roam Tour (1991–1992), Nowhere Else <b>to</b> <b>Roam</b> (1993), Madly in Anger with the World Tour (2003–2004), Escape from the Studio '06, and World Magnetic Tour (2008–2010). During these tours, South Africa as well as several countries in Central and South America, Asia, and Oceania were visited.|$|E

5|$|Field {{lacrosse}} involves two teams, each competing {{to shoot}} a lacrosse ball into the opposing team's goal. A lacrosse ball {{is made out of}} solid rubber, measuring 7.75 to 8inches (19.7–20cm) in circumference and weighing 5 to 5.25ounces (140–149g). Each team plays with ten players on the field: a goalkeeper; three defenders in the defensive end; three midfielders free <b>to</b> <b>roam</b> the whole field; and three attackers attempting to score goals in the offensive end. Players are required to wear some protective equipment, and must carry a lacrosse stick (or crosse) that meets specifications. Rules dictate the length of the game, boundaries, and allowable activity. Penalties are assessed by officials for any transgression of the rules.|$|E
5|$|Galland {{was summoned}} to Karinhall on 18 August 1940, and missed the intense air battle that day, known as The Hardest Day. During the meeting, Göring insisted that, in combat, Bf 109 fighters escort Bf 110s, which could not survive against {{single-engine}} fighters. As high-scoring aces, both Galland and Mölders shared their concerns that close escort of Bf 110s and bombers robbed fighter pilots of their freedom <b>to</b> <b>roam</b> and engage the enemy on their own terms. They also pointed {{to the fact that}} German bombers flew at medium altitudes and low speed, the best height area and speed for the manoeuvrability of the Spitfire. Galland resented his pilots having to carry out a task unsuited to their equipment but Göring would not move from his position.|$|E
5|$|Modern animal {{husbandry}} relies on production systems {{adapted to the}} type of land available. Subsistence farming is being superseded by intensive animal farming in the more developed parts of the world, where for example beef cattle are kept in high density feedlots, and thousands of chickens may be raised in broiler houses or batteries. On poorer soil such as in uplands, animals are often kept more extensively, and may be allowed <b>to</b> <b>roam</b> widely, foraging for themselves. Most livestock are herbivores, except for the pig which is an omnivore. Ruminants like cattle and sheep are adapted to feed on grass; they can forage outdoors, or may be fed entirely or in part on rations richer in energy and protein, such as pelleted cereals. Pigs and poultry cannot digest the cellulose in forage, and require cereals and other high-energy foods.|$|E
50|$|In 2009, it was {{announced}} that NZ Communications (as 2degrees was called then) had signed a roaming deal with Vodafone New Zealand. The deal allowed NZ Communications' customers <b>to</b> automatically <b>roam</b> onto Vodafone's 2G network.

5|$|On October 11, 1945, the Philippines {{became one}} of the {{founding}} members of the United Nations. The following year, on July 4, 1946, the Philippines was officially recognized by the United States as an independent nation through the Treaty of Manila, during the presidency of Manuel Roxas. Disgruntled remnants of the communist Hukbalahap continued <b>to</b> <b>roam</b> the countryside but were put down by President Elpidio Quirino's successor Ramon Magsaysay. Magsaysay's successor, Carlos P. Garcia, initiated the Filipino First Policy, which was continued by Diosdado Macapagal, with celebration of Independence Day moved from July 4 to June 12, the date of Emilio Aguinaldo's declaration, while furthering the claim on the eastern part of North Borneo.|$|E
5|$|Stock ducks {{would be}} chosen from ducklings hatched in March, with a typical breeder keeping six males and twenty laying females {{at any given}} time. The females would be kept for around a year before mating, {{typically}} to an older male. They would then generally be replaced, to reduce the problems of inbreeding. Stock ducks were allowed <b>to</b> <b>roam</b> freely during the day, and would swim in local ponds which, although privately owned, were treated as common property among the duck breeders; breeders would label their ducks with markings on the neck or head. The stock ducks would forage for greenery and insects, supplemented by greaves (the residue left after the rendering of animal fat). As ducks lay their eggs at night, the ducks would be brought indoors overnight.|$|E
5|$|The German fighter escort {{consisted}} of five Gruppen from JG 3, JG 53 and Jagdgeschwader 77 (JG 77). LG 2 Bf 109s flew top cover while Adolf Galland's JG 26 and Jagdgeschwader 51 (JG 51) conducted fighter sweeps {{in advance of}} the main bomber stream. For the sake of appearances (the morale of the bomber crews), Zerstörergeschwader 26 (Destroyer Wing 26 or ZG 26) flying the Messerschmitt Bf 110 flew close escort to KG 26. It was twice as small as the formation that hit London on 7 September, but instead of having two fighters for every bomber, there were four. Nor could the German pilots complain about being tied to the bombers. Sufficient numbers of fighters were allowed <b>to</b> <b>roam</b> on free-ranging patrols.|$|E
