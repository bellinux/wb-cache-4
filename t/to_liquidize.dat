50|$|Sodium {{silicate}} {{is used as}} a deflocculant in casting slips helping reduce viscosity and {{the need}} for large amounts of water <b>to</b> <b>liquidize</b> the clay body. It is also used to create a crackle effect in pottery, usually wheel-thrown. A vase or bottle is thrown on the wheel, fairly narrow and with thick walls. Sodium silicate is brushed on a section of the piece. After 5 minutes, the wall of the piece is stretched outward with a rib or hand. The result is a wrinkled or cracked look.|$|E
50|$|Subaru had a {{strategic}} relationship with Fuore. Himmel {{developed a new}} brand design strategy. His concept car Subaru B11S showed the new philosophy at the 2003 “Geneva Salon International de l’Auto”. The current models Subaru R1, R2 and B9 Tribeca were created by him, too. With the ‘XF 10’ and the ‘BlackJag’, Himmel presented his first self-developed show cars at the 2003 “Barcelona Salón Internacional del Automóvil” and the 2004 “Geneva Salon International de l’Auto”. Himmel worked for almost every leading corporate group in the automotive sector. After a hard year in 2006 and a bad forecast of incoming contracts in 2007, Himmel did not see a good enough economic perspective to continue and decided <b>to</b> <b>liquidize</b> the company at the middle of 2007.|$|E
5000|$|Michael Morbius {{experienced}} a transformation by electrical shock treatment and chemical ingestion into a pseudo-vampire. As a pseudo-vampire, Morbius does not possess all {{the powers of}} an actual vampire, nor is he subject to all the traditional limitations and weaknesses thereof. He possesses a variety of superhuman powers, {{some of which are}} similar to supernatural vampires within the Marvel Universe such as superhuman strength and speed as well as heightened senses including night vision and echolocation. Due to his vampire-like condition, Morbius is forced to ingest fresh blood on a regular basis to sustain his life and vitality. How much blood he requires and how often he has to feed has not been specified in the comics. However, Morbius does not possess any of the mystical vulnerabilities that supernatural vampires are subject to, such as garlic, holy water, crucifix, or silver. Morbius has a strong aversion to sunlight, thanks to his photo-sensitive skin which prevents any protection from major sun burn, in contrast to [...] "true" [...] vampires that are incinerated by it, with the result that he can move in daylight but his powers are diminished and he will stick to the shade if circumstances demand him to be active during the day. Morbius also lacks the shape-shifting and weather-control powers, and the ability to control animals, of vampires. Like [...] "true" [...] vampires, Morbius does possess the ability to hypnotize beings of lesser willpower and bring them under his control, which can only be resisted by those possessing an extremely strong will. While briefly infected by the demon Bloodthirst, Morbius gained the ability <b>to</b> <b>liquidize</b> his body, moving through small spaces and stretching his limbs as needed. He lost these abilities when he and Bloodthirst split.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{physical}} {{methods used to}} lyse, kill, and remove cells from the matrix of a tissue {{through the use of}} temperature, force and pressure, and electrical disruption. Temperature methods are often used in a rapid freeze-thaw mechanism. By quickly freezing a tissue, microscopic ice crystals form around the plasma membrane and the cell is lysed. After lysing the cells, the tissue can be further exposed <b>to</b> <b>liquidized</b> chemicals that degrade and wash out the undesirable components. Temperature methods conserve the physical structure of the ECM scaffold, but are best handled by thick, strong tissues.|$|R
50|$|Common {{forms of}} funding such as Debt Capital + Capital. Such funds {{supports}} the social ventures with invested capital {{that must be}} repaid either in short or long period of time, in additional with an agreement amount of interests. These raised capitals are usually secured with {{the assets of the}} company, by the lenders from banks and venture capital companies. In other words, if the company failed to repay their debt capitals, would results their ownership and equity interest <b>to</b> be <b>liquidized.</b> Noted, that mezzanine financing usually blinded with a high returns of 20% to 30%.|$|R
40|$|The {{trade-off}} {{between parents}} feeding {{themselves and their}} young is an important life history problem that can be considered in terms of optimal behavioral strategies. Recent studies on birds have tested how parents allocate the food between themselves and their young. Until now the effect of food consumption by parent birds on their food delivery to their young {{as well as other}} parental activities has rarely been studied. I have previously shown that parent Palestine sunbirds (Nectarinia osea) will consume nectar and liquidized arthropods from artificial feeders. However, they will only feed their young with whole arthropods. This provided a unique opportunity to experimentally manipulate the food eaten by parents independent of that fed to their offspring. Here, I hypothesized that parents invest in their current young according to the quality of food that they themselves consume. Breeding pairs with two or three nestlings were provided with feeders containing water (control), sucrose solution (0. 75 mol) or liquidized mealworms mixed with sucrose solution (0. 75 mol). As food quality in feeders increased (from water up <b>to</b> <b>liquidized</b> mealworms mixed with sucrose solution) : 1) Parents (especially females) increased their food delivery of whole arthropod prey to their young. 2) Only males increased their nest guarding effort. Nestling food intake and growth rate increased with increasing food quality of parents and decreasing brood size. These results imply that increasing the nutrient content of foods consumed by parent sunbirds allow them to increase the rate at which other foods are delivered to their young and to increase the time spent on other parental care activities...|$|R
5000|$|Price {{played as}} a prop in a record 12 {{successive}} tests for the British and Irish Lions, touring New Zealand in 1977. The front line in that tour {{was dominated by}} the [...] "Viet Gwent" [...] players, including Price. During a test match against Australia, he suffered a broken jaw after a punch by Steve Finanne. Price had <b>to</b> eat <b>liquidized</b> food for six weeks, and wore dentures for the following 40 years until replaced by implants in 2015. He returned for the South Africa in 1980 and made his final international appearances in the New Zealand in 1983 {{at the age of}} 31. He had played in every match of all three tours. His record of 12 appearances for a prop for the British and Irish Lions is not expected to be broken.|$|R
