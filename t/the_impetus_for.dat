5|$|One might {{surmise that}} the {{hermeneutic}} style was cultivated energetically in England {{in an attempt}} to show that English learning was as profound and English writing as sophisticated as anything produced on the Continent. <b>The</b> <b>impetus</b> <b>for</b> the cultivation of the style in tenth-century England was therefore probably of Continental origin.|$|E

5|$|Harris {{cites the}} success of the {{adaptation}} of The X-Files for providing <b>the</b> <b>impetus</b> <b>for</b> a Millennium comic, noting that IDW editor-in-chief Chris Ryall approached him to write the latter series having seen the reception the former had been receiving. Harris himself had been a fan of the series during its initial broadcast, personally favouring its second season. He also expressed interest in possibly adapting another of Carter's creations, Harsh Realm.|$|E
5|$|Shin Megami Tensei If... was {{developed}} as a change from previous Shin Megami Tensei titles, focusing on a small-scale environment and threat rather than a large-scale environment as in previous titles. Upon release, If... received a positive reception from critics and fans, and inspired multiple tie-in print adaptations and a mobile prequel. Its well-received high school setting was <b>the</b> <b>impetus</b> <b>for</b> {{the creation of the}} spin-off Persona series.|$|E
5|$|The missionaries {{were forced}} to proceed slowly, and could not do much about {{eliminating}} pagan practices, or destroying temples or other sacred sites, unlike the missionary efforts {{that had taken place}} in Gaul under St Martin. There was little fighting or bloodshed during the mission. Paganism was still practised in Kent until the 630s, and it was not declared illegal until 640. Although Honorius sent Felix to the East Angles, it appears that most of <b>the</b> <b>impetus</b> <b>for</b> conversion came from the East Anglian king.|$|E

5|$|This {{population}} {{issue was}} {{a significant part of}} <b>the</b> <b>impetus</b> <b>for</b> the recent merger of Old Ikata with Seto and Misaki. While Old Ikata is geographically more accessible, and has enjoyed the economic benefits of the Ikata Nuclear Power Plant, Seto and Misaki have experienced even more severe aging and decline of their populations. In 2000, Seto's working-age population dipped below 50% of its total.|$|E
5|$|Wulfhelm {{also went}} to Rome to receive his pallium in person from Pope John X. Why he chose to go to Rome in person for his pallium rather than having it sent to him like most of his {{predecessors}} is unknown. One suggestion has been that {{because he had been}} translated from another see, Wulfhelm felt the need to have papal approval of his translation made explicit. Given the low status of the papacy at the time, it is unlikely that <b>the</b> <b>impetus</b> <b>for</b> the change in tradition came from the pope.|$|E
5|$|Like the British Army, Australia did {{not have}} a {{parachute}} operations capability at the outbreak of the Second World War; however, the demonstration of the effectiveness of such forces by the Germans {{in the early stages of}} the conflict soon provided <b>the</b> <b>impetus</b> <b>for</b> their development. Efforts to raise an operational parachute capability in the Australian Army began in November 1942, with 40 volunteers being selected for initial training with the newly formed Paratroop Training Unit. The first descents were made at Tocumwal in New South Wales, with the initial parachute courses consisting of four jumps. By March 1943 enough personnel had been trained for the Army to consider forming a full parachute battalion. As a result, the 1st Parachute Battalion was raised at this time at RAAF Station Richmond near Sydney, New South Wales.|$|E

5|$|Negotiations {{initially}} {{focused on}} a comprehensive ban, but this was abandoned due to technical questions surrounding the detection of underground tests and Soviet concerns over the intrusiveness of proposed verification methods. <b>The</b> <b>impetus</b> <b>for</b> the test ban was provided by rising public anxiety over the magnitude of nuclear tests, particularly tests of new thermonuclear weapons (hydrogen bombs), and the resulting nuclear fallout. A test ban was also seen {{as a means of}} slowing nuclear proliferation and the nuclear arms race. Though the PTBT did not halt proliferation or the arms race, its enactment did coincide with a substantial decline in the concentration of radioactive particles in the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>impetus</b> <b>for</b> {{federation}} did {{not extend}} to the administration of cricket, however. The ACC continued to attract criticism for being ineffectual and {{at a meeting of}} the Victorian Cricket Association in July 1898, Trott (in his capacity as a delegate for the South Melbourne club) tabled a motion that Victoria secede from the ACC. Although the proposal was defeated by a single vote, Trott was one of twelve Test players who signed a letter to the ACC secretary calling for the disbanding of the organisation. Failing to win the support of the players, the ACC folded in January 1900 following the withdrawal of the New South Wales Cricket Association.|$|E
5|$|The {{microscopic}} {{characteristics and}} cytogenetics of C.micaceus are well known, {{and it has}} been used frequently as a model organism to study cell division and meiosis in Basidiomycetes. Chemical analysis of the fruit bodies has revealed the presence of antibacterial and enzyme-inhibiting compounds. Formerly known as Coprinus micaceus, the species was transferred to Coprinellus in 2001 as phylogenetic analyses provided <b>the</b> <b>impetus</b> <b>for</b> a reorganization of the many species formerly grouped together in the genus Coprinus. Based on external appearance, C.micaceus is virtually indistinguishable from C.truncorum, {{and it has been}} suggested that many reported collections of the former may be of the latter.|$|E

50|$|They did not {{complete}} the 1955 season, as they {{dropped out of the}} League - the second squad to do so that season, following the Galveston White Caps. They played their final game of the season on June 29. Team owner J. C.

5|$|Although Metzger {{had been}} trying to pitch a movie based on the life of Joseph Süß Oppenheimer for many years, <b>the</b> <b>impetus</b> <b>for</b> the movie came from Joseph Goebbels' desire to make an antisemitic {{response}} to Mendes' philo-semitic film adaptation of Lion Feuchtwanger's 1925 novel Jud Süß. Because Mendes' movie was so sympathetic to the subject, the scriptwriters shifted their model to Wilhelm Hauff's 1827 novella. However, even after Harlan rewrote the original script, the result was not antisemitic enough to suit Goebbels' propaganda needs so he personally intervened in the editing process to the point of dropping some scenes and rewriting others including making a substantial change to the film's ending to show Süß as humbled rather than defiant. Thus, the message of the film was diametrically opposed to the intent of Feuchtwanger's novel. At the same time, however, the film evokes Feuchtwanger’s texts, twisting and reversing the core of the Jewish writer’s work. Although inspired by the historical details of Süß's life, the novel, novella, and film only loosely correspond to the historical sources available at the Landesarchiv Baden-Württemberg.|$|E
5|$|Carter's initial {{pitch for}} The X-Files was {{rejected}} by Fox executives. He fleshed out the concept and returned a few weeks later, leading to the commission of the pilot. Carter worked with NYPD Blue producer Daniel Sackheim in further developing the pilot, drawing stylistic inspiration from the 1988 documentary The Thin Blue Line, and the English television series Prime Suspect. Inspiration was also taken from Carter's memories of watching Kolchak: The Night Stalker and The Twilight Zone in his youth; {{as well as from}} the then-recently released film The Silence of the Lambs, which was <b>the</b> <b>impetus</b> <b>for</b> framing the series around agents from the FBI, in order to provide the characters with a more plausible reason for being involved in each case than Carter believed was present in Kolchak. Carter was also keen on keeping the relationship between the two lead roles strictly platonic, basing their interactions on the characters of Emma Peel (Diana Rigg) and John Steed (Patrick Macnee) in the series The Avengers.|$|E

5|$|New Jersey's {{drinking}} age {{was lowered}} to 18 in 1973 {{as part of}} a broader legal change which reduced New Jersey's age of majority from 21 to 18. Much of <b>the</b> <b>impetus</b> <b>for</b> lowering the drinking age to 18 was to grant returning Vietnam veterans the right to purchase alcohol. Possibly because of concerns about 18-year-old high school students being able to legally purchase liquor, and then illegally consume it school, the state raised the drinking age to 19 in 1980. Citing statistics that indicated an increase in car deaths among drivers under 21, the drinking age was raised back to 21 in 1983. At the same time, the penalties for underage drinking were increased to include a mandatory driver's license suspension. In 1985, the state made it illegal for an adult to give alcohol to a person under 21, with exception for religious services and parents serving alcohol to their own children at home or in a private area.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} {{conspiracy}} theories {{have been proposed}} about the events surrounding the bombing. Some theories allege that individuals in the government, including President Bill Clinton, knew of the impending bombing and intentionally failed to act on that knowledge. Other theories focus on initial reports by local news stations of multiple other unexploded bombs within the building itself as evidence of remnants of a controlled demolition; following the attack, search and rescue operations at the site were delayed until the area had been declared safe by the Oklahoma City bomb squad and federal authorities. According to both a situation report compiled by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and a memo issued by the United States Atlantic Command the day following the attack, a second bomb located within the building was disarmed while a third was evacuated. Further theories focus on additional conspirators involved with the bombing. Additional theories claim the bombing {{was carried out by}} the government in order to frame the militia movement or to provide <b>the</b> <b>impetus</b> <b>for</b> new antiterrorism legislation while using McVeigh as a scapegoat. Other conspiracy theories suggest that foreign agents, particularly Islamic terrorists but also the Japanese government or German Neo-Nazis, were involved in the bombing. Experts have disputed the theories and government investigations have been opened at various times to look into the theories.|$|E
5|$|On February 15, 2013, La Sombra {{defeated}} Volador Jr. {{to win the}} 2013 Reyes del Aire tournament. Following their clash {{over the}} Reyes del Aire trophy Volador Jr. and La Sombra were teamed up for the 2013 Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles tournament, the same tournament that in 2010 was <b>the</b> <b>impetus</b> <b>for</b> Volador Jr.'s rudo turn. The rivals put their issues aside for the tournament, defeating the teams of Guerrero Maya Jr. and Negro Casas, La Máscara and Averno, and Shocker and Mr. Niebla {{to qualify for the}} finals of the tournament. On March 15, at the 2013 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show, Volador Jr. and La Sombra defeated Altantis and Último Guerrero to win the Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles. The truce between La Sombra and Volador Jr. that allowed them to win the tag team tournament only lasted until the next time the two rivals were in the same ring. On February 17, 2013 La Sombra teamed up with Marco Corleone and Místico II against Volador Jr., Euforia and Último Guerrero. During the match Volador Jr. attacked both La Sombra and the referee, causing a disqualification before leaving the ring and his confused partners behind. On September 13 at CMLL's 80th Anniversary Show, La Sombra and Volador Jr. defeated Atlantis and Último Guerrero in a Relevos Suicidas match and thus advanced to a Mask vs. Mask Lucha de Apuestas against each other. In the end, La Sombra was victorious, forcing his rival to unmask.|$|E
