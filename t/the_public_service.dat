40|$|Original title: Tussen overschot en tekort. Many {{secondary}} {{and higher education}} programmes in the Netherlands are focused on training people for jobs in <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>services</b> sector. <b>The</b> rising participation in higher education {{has led to a}} considerable {{increase in the number of}} graduates from such programmes. The question then is how many of this increased number have been absorbed into the labour market. Has a surplus arisen of people with qualifications for jobs in <b>public</b> <b>services,</b> as predicted in the past? Are they ending up to a greater extent than in the past in sectors other than that for which they have qualified? How well does the level of their education programme match the level of the jobs they obtain? This study explores the quantitative and qualitative match between education and employment in <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>services</b> sector. Comparison between <b>the</b> <b>public</b> and private sectors is an important part of this. The following issues are addressed: the labour market participation and labour market destination of people graduating from vocational courses for <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>services</b> sector; characteristics of jobs and employees in <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>services</b> sector; surpluses and shortages of <b>public</b> <b>services</b> sector graduates; <b>the</b> match between the level of education programmes and job levels; the income of people with qualifications for <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>services</b> sector; <b>the</b> perceived quality of the work in <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>services</b> sector; <b>the</b> interest in <b>public</b> <b>service</b> sector training programmes and the background to the choice of these programmes...|$|R
40|$|The Master thesis {{analyses}} <b>the</b> {{development of}} <b>public</b> <b>services</b> supply. <b>The</b> {{recognition of the}} main development tendencies is especially important and has direct impact on decision – making and implementation. Although <b>the</b> development of <b>public</b> <b>services</b> supply is influenced {{by a variety of}} factors, public administration paradigms can be defined as the basic factor that determines fundamental changes within the entire system. In order to analyse <b>the</b> development of <b>public</b> <b>services,</b> it is important to raise the following question: how does <b>the</b> change of <b>public</b> administration paradigms influence <b>the</b> change of <b>public</b> <b>services</b> supply? <b>The</b> following aim has been raised: to reveal <b>the</b> development of <b>public</b> <b>services</b> supply in <b>the</b> context of <b>public</b> administration paradigms. These objectives have been set: 1. To discuss the concept of a <b>public</b> <b>service</b> and <b>the</b> system of <b>public</b> <b>services</b> supply. 2. To review the change of elements in <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>services</b> supply system in the context of <b>the</b> main <b>public</b> administration paradigms. 3. To carry out an analysis of <b>the</b> development of <b>public</b> <b>services</b> supply in Lithuania.

Part two constructs methodology and describes the analysis of <b>the</b> development of <b>public</b> <b>services</b> supply in Lithuania. The analysis proves that <b>the</b> current <b>public</b> <b>services</b> supply system displays all three public administration paradigms features. However, {{it can be said that}} the elements of <b>the</b> new <b>public</b> management paradigm are prevailing. According to the analysis carried out, the trends of the development of <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>services</b> supply system in Lithuania were discussed.
