5000|$|The {{density of}} water varies with {{temperature}} and pressure {{as does the}} density of the sample. So it is necessary to specify the temperatures and pressures at which the densities or weights were determined. It is nearly always the case that measurements are made at 1 nominal atmosphere (1013.25 mbar ± variations from changing weather patterns). But as <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> usually refers to highly incompressible aqueous solutions or other incompressible substances (such as petroleum products), variations in density caused by pressure are usually neglected at least where apparent <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> is being measured. For <b>true</b> (in vacuo) <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> calculations, air pressure must be considered (see below). Temperatures are specified by the notation [...] with [...] representing the temperature at which the sample's density was determined and [...] the temperature at which the reference (water) density is specified. For example, SG (20°C/4°C) would be understood to mean that {{the density of the}} sample was determined at 20°C and of the water at 4°C. Taking into account different sample and reference temperatures, we note that, while [...] (20°C/20°C), it is also the case that [...] (20°C/4°C). Here, temperature is being specified using the current ITS-90 scale and the densities used here and in the rest of this article are based on that scale. On the previous IPTS-68 scale, the densities at 20 °C and 4 °C are 0.9982071 and 0.9999720 respectively, resulting in an SG (20°C/4°C) value for water of 0.9982343.|$|R

50|$|Vibrating Element Transducers: This type of {{instrument}} {{requires a}} vibrating element {{to be placed in}} contact with the fluid of interest. The resonant frequency of the element is measured and is related to the density of the fluid by a characterization that is dependent upon the design of the element. In modern laboratories precise measurements of specific gravity are made using oscillating U-tube meters. These are capable of measurement to 5 to 6 places beyond the decimal point and are used in the brewing, distilling, pharmaceutical, petroleum and other industries. The instruments measure the actual mass of fluid contained in a fixed volume at temperatures between 0 and 80 °C but as they are microprocessor based can calculate apparent or <b>true</b> <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> and contain tables relating these to the strengths of common acids, sugar solutions, etc. The vibrating fork immersion probe is another good example of this technology. This technology also includes many coriolis-type mass flow meters which are widely used in chemical and petroleum industry for high accuracy mass flow measurement and can be configured to also output density information based on the resonant frequency of the vibrating flow tubes.|$|E
50|$|Submerged <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> {{is equal}} to the <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> given by the ratio of the weight of the object to the weight of the fluid) minus one. That is, the object and fluid have the same density when the <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> equals one and the {{submerged}} <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> equals zero. This fact highlights the utility of the usage of submerged <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> in problems involving buoyancy and force balances on submerged objects: the object will naturally rise when its submerged <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> is negative, and sink when its submerged <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> is positive. Because of this characteristic and its dimensionless nature, submerged <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> is ubiquitous in equations of sediment transport.|$|R
25|$|High <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> is a {{diagnostic}} property of a mineral. A variation in chemistry (and consequently, mineral class) correlates {{to a change}} in <b>specific</b> <b>gravity.</b> Among more common minerals, oxides and sulfides tend to have a higher <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> as they include elements with higher atomic mass. A generalization is that minerals with metallic or adamantine lustre tend to have higher <b>specific</b> <b>gravities</b> than those having a non-metallic to dull lustre. For example, hematite, Fe2O3, has a <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> of 5.26 while galena, PbS, has a <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> of 7.2–7.6, which is a result of their high iron and lead content, respectively. A very high <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> becomes very pronounced in native metals; kamacite, an iron-nickel alloy common in iron meteorites has a <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> of 7.9, and gold has an observed <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> between 15 and 19.3.|$|R
30|$|The <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> {{test was}} carried out as per ASTM D [16]. <b>Specific</b> <b>gravity</b> is {{the ratio of the}} mass of unit volume of waste at a stated {{temperature}} to the mass of the same volume of gas-free distilled water at a stated temperature. The average <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> of MSW obtained was about 1.15. The lower value of <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> {{can be attributed to the}} presence of decomposed organic matter. The <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> is a basic material property used in the design calculations of the landfill. Knowing the <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> of MSW makes it easier to evaluate the values of voids ratio, porosity and degree of saturation. Nazli et al. [17] reported <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> of MSW from the United States; found that the average <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> was 1.377. Breitmeyer [18] determined the <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> of MSW landfill, United States, found that the 1.65. All the experiments were performed as per the standard procedure established by the American society for testing and materials.|$|R
50|$|As {{specific}} gravity {{was the basis}} for the Balling, Brix and Plato tables, dissolved sugar content was originally estimated by measurement of {{specific gravity}} using a hydrometer or pycnometer. In modern times, hydrometers are still widely used, but where greater accuracy is required, an electronic oscillating U-tube meter may be employed. Whichever means are used, the analyst enters the tables with specific gravity and takes out (using interpolation if necessary) the sugar content in percent by mass. If the analyst uses the Plato tables (maintained by the American Society of Brewing Chemists) he or she reports in °P. If using the Brix table (the current version of which is maintained by NIST and can be found on their website), he or she reports in °Bx. If using the ICUMSA tables, he or she would report in mass fraction (m.f.). It is not, typically, actually necessary to consult tables as the tabulated °Bx or °P value can be printed directly on the hydrometer scale next to the tabulated value of specific gravity or stored in the memory of the electronic U-tube meter or calculated from polynomial fits to the tabulated data. Both ICUMSA and ASBC have published suitable polynomials; in fact, the ICUMSA tables are calculated from the polynomials. The opposite is true with the ASBC polynomial. Also note that the tables in use today are not those published by Brix or Plato. Those workers measured <b>true</b> <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> reference to water at 4 °C using, respectively, 17.5 °C and 20 °C, as the temperature at which the density of a sucrose solution be measured. Both NBS and ASBC converted to apparent specific gravity at 20 °C/20 °C. The ICUMSA tables are based on more recent measurements on sucrose, fructose, glucose and invert sugar, and they tabulate true density and weight in air at 20 °C against mass fraction.|$|E
40|$|These {{investigations}} {{were carried}} out to ascertain the geotechnical properties of gravel roads over peat areas in the lower Ishikari district, {{in order to provide}} the basic data necessary {{for the establishment of a}} rational policy for the construction of future roads in peat areas. The first report deals with the results of investigations of bearing capacity settlement and associated factors on existing roads in and around the Shinotsu district. The second report contains the results of the geotechnical investigations of roads in peat bogs and discusses a profile survey, undisturbed sampling and cone penetration tests in peat bogs. In the third report the author concludes that the relationship between moisture content and ignition loss corresponds to the consolidation history. A "moisture- ignition loss ratio" index presents a relationship between such factors as <b>true</b> <b>specific</b> <b>gravity,</b> density, moisture content and ignition loss. He concludes that such strength characteristics as shearing resistance indicate a correlation to this index, and suggests the possibility of estimating the consolidation history of a peat deposit from the index.

30|$|In another study, it {{was also}} {{determined}} that the <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> is a significant element in cutting forces.

30|$|Wood {{properties}} of six 8 -year-old natural acacia hybrid clones between Acacia mangium and Acacia auriculiformis, planted in Bavi, Vietnam, were studied.

The characteristics of growth, air-dry <b>specific</b> <b>gravity,</b> lengths of fibers and vessel elements, S 2 microfibril angle, green moisture content, and shrinkage were examined to clarify the variation among clones. From the results, the differences among the clones in growth and in some wood properties were significant. The pattern of distribution of <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> showed that there were low and high <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> zones in the stem. <b>Specific</b> <b>gravity</b> at stump height or at 3.0 m was useful for prediction of <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> in the whole tree stem.
