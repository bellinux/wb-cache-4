25|$|In this context, {{several women}} have joined guerrilla and rebel groups {{as a way}} to express their {{rejection}} of the situation that they have been forced to live with. A famous Latin American female fighter was the second in command of <b>the</b> <b>FMLN,</b> commander Ana María of El Salvador. She was an intellectual woman and was considered as an icon among revolutionary women in the region. Eventually she was brutally killed by her own comrades on April 6, 1983 in Managua, Nicaragua, after having made many sacrifices during her life as a guerrilla. <b>The</b> <b>FMLN</b> blamed its leader Cayetano Carpio as the person responsible for the crime, and he committed suicide.|$|E

This provision came into effect on March 2, and the new mission was to guard borders and homelands to serve as military police, under the name of a new military unit: the Special Brigade of Military Security of the Military of El Salvador, based on agreement N ° 59 of the Executive Branch, dated June 25, 1992. Also at that time the organic law dated from September 25, 1934 was repealed.|$|E

25|$|Noriega had {{sided with}} the U.S. rather than the USSR in Central America, notably in sabotaging {{the forces of the}} Sandinista {{government}} in Nicaragua, and the revolutionaries of <b>the</b> <b>FMLN</b> group in El Salvador. Noriega received upwards of $100,000 per year from the 1960s until the 1980s, when his salary was increased to $200,000 per year. Although he worked with the Drug Enforcement Administration to restrict illegal drug shipments, he was known to simultaneously accept significant financial support from drug dealers, because he facilitated the laundering of drug money, and through Noriega, they received protection from DEA investigations due to his special relationship with the CIA.|$|E
25|$|Guerrilla warfare {{is often}} {{associated}} with a rural setting, and this is indeed the case with the definitive operations of Mao and Giap, the mujahadeen of Afghanistan, the Ejército Guerrillero de los Pobres (EGP) of Guatemala, the Contras of Nicaragua, and <b>the</b> <b>FMLN</b> of El Salvador. Guerrillas however have successfully operated in urban settings as demonstrated in places like Argentina and Northern Ireland. In those cases, guerrillas rely on a friendly population to provide supplies and intelligence. Rural guerrillas prefer to operate in regions providing plenty of cover and concealment, especially heavily forested and mountainous areas. Urban guerrillas, rather than melting into the mountains and forests, blend into the population and are also dependent on a support base among the people. Removing and destroying guerrillas out of both types of areas can be difficult.|$|E

2500|$|When {{the same}} {{resolution}} was {{brought before the}} United Nations General Assembly on 3 November it was passed. [...] Only El Salvador and Israel voted with the U.S. against it.

2500|$|Nicaragua {{brought the}} matter to the U.N. Security Council, where the United States vetoed a {{resolution}} (11 to 1, 3 abstentions) calling on all states to observe international law. Nicaragua also turned to the General Assembly, which passed a resolution 94 to 3 calling for compliance with the World Court ruling. Two states, Israel and El Salvador, joined the United States in opposition. At that time, El Salvador was receiving substantial funding and military advisement from the U.S., which was aiming to crush a Sandinista-like revolutionary movement by <b>the</b> <b>FMLN.</b> At the same session, Nicaragua called upon the U.N. to send an independent fact-finding mission to the border to secure international monitoring of the borders after a conflict there; the proposal was rejected by Honduras with U.S. backing. A year later, on November 12, 1987, the General Assembly again called for [...] "full and immediate compliance" [...] with the World Court decision. This time only Israel joined the United States in opposing adherence to the ruling.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>FMLN</b> and {{the right-wing}} Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA) {{are the two}} {{dominant}} political parties in El Salvador.

According to Salvadoran law, a candidate must obtain 50% + 1 vote in order to win presidential elections. Sánchez Cerén attained the leading votes in the elections on 2 February but not the majority enough to win, so he and Norman Quijano competed in the second round.

50|$|The {{department}} of Morazán {{was the site}} of some of the fiercest fighting during the Salvadoran civil war of 1980-1992. It was also the scene of the conflict's most notorious massacre, in the village of El Mozote. Perquín was long a rebel stronghold, and sometimes designated <b>the</b> <b>FMLN's</b> unofficial capital. <b>The</b> war had an ambivalent effect on the region's natural ecosystem: on the one hand, the combat was a source of widespread destruction; on the other hand, it prevented significant urbanization.|$|R

50|$|After the 1994 {{elections}} and the 1994 split, momentum grew to unify <b>the</b> <b>FMLN</b> into a single organization without separate internal parties. In 1995, the five parties that had formed <b>the</b> <b>FMLN</b> dissolved themselves. It is {{at that point that}} the FPL, CP, ERP, RN and PRTC ceased to exist, and what remained was a unified FMLN. Then people could join <b>the</b> <b>FMLN</b> directly instead of having to join one of its component parties. While this decision liquidated the parallel organizational structures inside <b>the</b> <b>FMLN,</b> there still remained strong loyalties along historic organizational lines, some of which can still be seen today.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of party members {{came from the}} ARENA. Originally the defection from ARENA included 12 deputies in the Legislative Assembly, but this number has grown to 16.

50|$|RPGs were a main tool used by <b>the</b> <b>FMLN's</b> guerrilla {{forces in}} the Salvadoran Civil War.

Using RPGs to initiate the attack, they blew through the wall and killed a number of Salvadorean soldiers. They eliminated the outermost sentries and searchlights with the rockets, then {{made it into the}} inner wall, which they also punched through. They were then able to create mayhem as their comrades attacked from the outside.|$|R

5000|$|In 2004 and 2005, <b>the</b> <b>FMLN</b> {{experienced}} another split. Five FMLN Legislative Assembly {{members and}} a number of their supporters left <b>the</b> <b>FMLN</b> to form a new political party, the Democratic Revolutionary Front (Spanish: Frente Democratico Revolucionario). Some of the principal leaders of this split were Ileana Rogel and Francisco Jovel. The people who left to form the FDR chose this name because it has a legacy in the Salvadoran movement; an organization by the same name was formed under the leadership of <b>the</b> <b>FMLN</b> during the civil war to bring together parties and individuals doing legal political work during the civil war. As opposed to previous splits from <b>the</b> <b>FMLN</b> which openly proclaimed that they were ideologically 'center' or 'center-left' or were no longer self-declared [...] "revolutionaries", the people who split to form the FDR claimed to still be part of the leftist legacy of <b>the</b> <b>FMLN.</b> In the 2006 elections, no FDR candidates won office, except for the incumbent mayor of Nejapa, Rene Canjura. Canjura was a popular FMLN mayor of the municipality of Nejapa for three consecutive periods, and therefore under FMLN statutes, would not have been eligible to run for a fourth consecutive period. So he left <b>the</b> <b>FMLN</b> and successfully ran in 2006 as the FDR candidate. No other FDR candidates won any electoral victories in 2006.|$|E
