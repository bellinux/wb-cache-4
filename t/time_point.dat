25|$|One common {{approach}} to analysing fMRI data {{is to consider}} each voxel separately {{within the framework of}} the general linear model. The model assumes, at every <b>time</b> <b>point,</b> that the HDR is equal to the scaled and summed version of the events active at that point. A researcher creates a design matrix specifying which events are active at any timepoint. One common way is to create a matrix with one column per overlapping event, and one row per <b>time</b> <b>point,</b> and to mark it if a particular event, say a stimulus, is active at that <b>time</b> <b>point.</b> One then assumes a specific shape for the HDR, leaving only its amplitude changeable in active voxels. The design matrix and this shape are used to generate a prediction of the exact HDR response of the voxel at every timepoint, using the mathematical procedure of convolution. This prediction does not include the scaling required for every event before summing them.|$|E

40|$|Researchers often collect {{longitudinal}} data {{so as to}} model change over time in a phenomenon and for a population of interest. Inevitably, {{there will be some}} variation across individuals in specific time intervals between assessments. By necessity or by choice, a researcher can decide to ignore these individual differences in times of assessments. In this simulation study of growth curve modeling, I investigate how ignoring individual differences in <b>time</b> <b>points</b> when modeling change over time relates to convergence and admissibility of solutions, bias in estimates of parameters, power to detect change over time, and, when there is no change over time, Type I error rate. The simulation factors that I manipulate in this study are magnitude of the individual differences in assessment times that are ignored, magnitude of change over time, number of <b>time</b> <b>points,</b> and sample size. Results show that, in contrast to the correct analysis, ignoring individual differences in <b>time</b> <b>points</b> frequently led to inadmissible solutions, especially with few <b>time</b> <b>points</b> and small samples, regardless of the specific magnitude of individual differences that were ignored. Mean intercept and slope were generally estimated without bias. With few <b>time</b> <b>points</b> and small samples, ignoring individual differences in <b>time</b> <b>points</b> yielded overestimated intercept and slope variances and underestimated intercept-slope covariance and residual variance, more so than when using the correct analysis. When there were more than 3 <b>time</b> <b>points,</b> or when there were 3 <b>time</b> <b>points</b> and sample size was 500, ignoring individual differences in <b>time</b> <b>points</b> yielded overestimated residual variance, but only if individual differences were large. Power and Type I error rate for the linear slope were unaffected by the type of analysis. Overall, this study suggests that it is advisable to account for individual differences in <b>time</b> <b>points</b> whenever possible. M. S. PsychologyMastersUniversity of New Mexico.

25|$|Pharmacokinetics {{is often}} studied using mass {{spectrometry}} {{because of the}} complex nature of the matrix (often blood or urine) {{and the need for}} high sensitivity to observe low dose and long <b>time</b> <b>point</b> data. The most common instrumentation used in this application is LC-MS with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Tandem mass spectrometry is usually employed for added specificity. Standard curves and internal standards are used for quantitation of usually a single pharmaceutical in the samples. The samples represent different time points as a pharmaceutical is administered and then metabolized or cleared from the body. Blank or t=0 samples taken before administration are important in determining background and ensuring data integrity with such complex sample matrices. Much attention is paid to the linearity of the standard curve; however {{it is not uncommon to}} use curve fitting with more complex functions such as quadratics since the response of most mass spectrometers is less than linear across large concentration ranges.|$|E
25|$|A severe ADAMTS13 {{deficiency}} below 5% or <10% of {{the normal}} (depending on the definitions) is highly specific for the diagnosis of TTP. ADAMTS13 activity assays {{are based on the}} direct or indirect measurement of VWF-cleavage products. Its activity should be measured in blood samples taken before therapy has started, to prevent false high ADAMTS13 activity. If a severe ADAMTS13 deficiency is present an ADAMTS13 inhibitor assay is needed to distinguish between the acquired, autoantibody-mediated and the congenital form of TTP (USS). The presence of antibodies can be tested by ELISA or functional inhibitor assays. The level of ADAMTS13 inhibitor may be fluctuating over the course of disease and depends on free circulatory antibodies, therefore an onetime negative test result does not always exclude the presence of ADAMTS13 inhibitors and thereby an autoimmune origin of TTP. A severe ADAMTS13 deficiency {{in the absence of an}} inhibitor, confirmed on a second <b>time</b> <b>point</b> in a healthy episode of a possible USS patient, usually sets the trigger to perform a molecular analysis of the ADAMTS13 gene to confirm a mutation. In unclear cases a plasma infusion trial can be done, showing an USS in the absence of anti-ADAMTS13-antibodies a full recovery of infused plasma-ADAMTS13 activity as well as a plasma half-life of infused ADAMTS13 activity of 2â€“4 days. A deficiency of ADAMTS13 activity in first-degree relatives is also a very strong indicator for an Upshaw-Schulman Syndrome.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we {{consider}} an interesting identification problem where an unknown phenomenon {{is to be}} identified by the trajectory of an impulsive differential equation.
