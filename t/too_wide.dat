5|$|There was {{initially}} no direct line from London to Wales as the tidal River Severn was <b>too</b> <b>wide</b> to cross. Trains instead {{had to follow}} a lengthy route via Gloucester, where the river was narrow enough to be crossed by a bridge. Work on the Severn Tunnel had begun in 1873, but unexpected underwater springs delayed the work and prevented its opening until 1886.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, the {{rationing}} {{of petroleum}} fuels gave {{a boost to}} ridership on the electric tramways. To handle the massive increase in ridership, the trams were equipped with two conductors. The single-centre-door solution that worked excellently before the war became a bottle-neck as the trams became packed with riders. Lack of parts, particularly for the British Vickers motors, caused long waits for defective vehicles at the depots. From 1942, the Kolsås Line was transferred to terminate at Nationaltheatret in the city centre, and the Class B was operated along the Lilleaker Line from the west. Trams 164–166 were sent to Düsseldorf in Germany, but were never used because the city lacked balloon loops and the trams were <b>too</b> <b>wide.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the appeal}} against Prakash J.'s {{judgment}} to the Court of Appeal, also called Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. Minister for Information and the Arts (1996), {{counsel for the}} appellants argued that the restriction placed by the Minister on the importation, sale and distribution of the Jehovah's Witnesses publications was <b>too</b> <b>wide</b> and disproportionate. Applying an approach similar to that taken in Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. P.P. (1994), the Court of Appeal noted that the appellants were essentially seeking to challenge the view taken by the Minister that Jehovah's Witnesses' refusal to carry out National Service {{was a threat to}} national security. The Court regarded this as a non-justiciable issue and declined to allow the appellants to bring an application for judicial review of Order No. 405/1995.|$|E

5|$|The initial French {{attack was}} aimed at seizing the three Russian {{positions}} collectively known as the Bagration flèches, four arrow-head shaped, open-backed earthworks which arced out to the left en échelon {{in front of the}} Kolocha stream. These positions helped support the Russian left, which had no terrain advantages. There was much to be desired {{in the construction of the}} flèches, one officer noting that the ditches were much too shallow, the embrasures open to the ground, making them easy to enter, and that they were much <b>too</b> <b>wide</b> exposing infantry inside them. The flèches were supported by artillery from the village of Semyanovskaya, whose elevation dominated the other side of the Kolocha.|$|E
5|$|Frederick's army became {{bogged down}} in the Reppen Forest. The day was already hot and sultry, and the men were already tired. The trees were thick and the ground was {{unstable}} and oozy in some parts, which made {{the movement of the}} heavy guns difficult. Delay after delay slowed them down. The carriages pulling the biggest guns, traveling with the bulk of the army, were <b>too</b> <b>wide</b> to cross the narrow forest bridges and the columns had to be reshuffled in the woods. The Russians could hear them, but thought they were scouting parties, albeit noisy ones; they calculated Finck's column was the primary force. Between 5:00 am. and 6:00 am., only Finck's demonstrating corps, to the north by Trettin, were visible to the Russians. Finck's right wing moved out of the hills toward the mill on Hühner Fleiss; more Prussians from Finck's left and center prepared to attack the Walkberge. Finck's artillery awaited Frederick's signal, but the bulk of Frederick's army still crashed about in the woods.|$|E
5|$|Like other ankylosaurids, Ankylosaurus had {{cervical}} half-rings (armor {{plates on}} the neck), {{but these are}} only known from fragments, making their exact arrangement uncertain. Carpenter suggested that when seen from above, the plates would have been paired, and created an inverted V-shape across the neck, with the midline gap probably being filled with small ossicles (round bony scutes) to allow for movement. He believed the width of this armor belt was <b>too</b> <b>wide</b> to have fitted solely on the neck, and that it covered {{the base of the}} neck and continued onto the shoulder region. Paleontologists Victoria M. Arbour and Philip J. Currie disagreed with Carpenter's interpretation, and pointed out that the cervical half-ring fragments of specimen AMNH 5895 did not fit together in the way proposed by Carpenter (though this could be due to breakage). They instead suggested that the fragments represented the remains of two cervical half-rings, which formed two semi-circular plates of armor around {{the upper part of the}} neck, as in the closely related Anodontosaurus and Euoplocephalus.|$|E

40|$|A {{frequently}} encountered type of query in image database {{systems is}} to find the k most similar images to a query image with respect to its feature. Processing such queries requires substantially different search algorithms than those for the normal k nearest neighbor problem: dimensionality of the feature may be very high and similarity measure may not be as simple as a Euclidean distance. For this problem, low-dimensional transformation techniques were proposed, which map high dimensional feature values into a lower dimensional space and evaluate the original similarity metric only for those within some bound in lower dimension. This reduces the number of the high dimensional matchings. However, to guarantee no false dismissals, the existing methods use a maximal search space, which may be <b>too</b> <b>wider</b> than is practically needed. We propose an incremental filtering algorithm that can reduce the search space. The proposed algorithm first chooses a minimal search space and incremetally ex [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Foraging by feral pigs can {{strongly}} affect wetland vegetation assemblages and so <b>too</b> <b>wider</b> ecological processes, {{although their}} effects on freshwater ecosystems have seldom been studied. We assessed the ecological effects of pig foraging in replicate fenced and unfenced ephemeral floodplain lagoons in tropical north-eastern Australia. Pig foraging activities in unfenced lagoons caused major changes to aquatic macrophyte communities and as a consequence, to the proportional amounts of open water and bare ground. The destruction of macrophyte communities and upheaval of wetland sediments significantly affected wetland turbidity, and caused prolonged anoxia and pH imbalances in the unfenced treatments. Whilst fencing of floodplain lagoons will protect against feral pig foraging activities, our repeated measures of many biological, physical and chemical parameters inferred that natural seasonal (i. e. temporal) effects had a greater influence on these variables than did pigs. To validate this observation requires measuring how these effects {{are influenced by the}} seemingly greater annual disturbance regime of variable flooding and drying in this tropical climate...|$|R
5|$|The next year—1909—followed {{much the}} same pattern. KzS Ehler Behring {{replaced}} von Krosigk in April. In June, Deutschland won the Kaiser's Schießpreis (Shooting Prize) for excellent shooting in the II Squadron. Another cruise into the Atlantic was conducted from 7 July to 1 August, during which Deutschland stopped in Bilbao, Spain. While {{on the way back}} to Germany, the High Seas Fleet was received by the British Royal Navy in Spithead. After another round of exercises, Deutschland went in for a periodic overhaul. During the refit, she was given additional pedestal-mounted searchlights and became the first ship in the German navy to be equipped with an X-ray machine. In late 1909, Prince Heinrich was replaced by Admiral Henning von Holtzendorff, who kept Deutschland as his flagship. Holtzendorff's tenure as fleet commander was marked by strategic experimentation, owing to the increased threat the latest underwater weapons posed and the fact that the new s were <b>too</b> <b>wide</b> to pass through the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal. Accordingly, the fleet was transferred from Kiel to Wilhelmshaven on 1 April 1910.|$|E
5|$|As Scott's men {{reached an}} open prairie near the Wea {{settlement}} of Ouiatenon on June 1, they were discovered by an enemy scout {{and hurried to}} attack the villages before the residents could react. When the main force reached the villages, they found the residents hurriedly fleeing across the Wabash River in canoes. Aided by cover fire from a Kickapoo village {{on the other side}} of the river, they were able to escape before Scott's men could attack. The river was <b>too</b> <b>wide</b> to ford at Scott's location, so he sent a detachment under James Wilkinson in one direction and a detachment under Thomas Barbee in the other to find a place to ford the river. Wilkinson did not find a suitable location, but located and killed a small band of Indians before returning. Barbee located a crossing and conducted a brief raid against the Indians on the other side before returning to Scott. The next morning, Scott's main force burned the nearby villages and crops, while a detachment under Wilkinson set out for the settlement of Kethtippecannunk. The inhabitants of this village had fled across Eel Creek, and after a brief and ineffective firefight, Wilkinson's men burned the city and returned to Scott. In his official report, Scott noted that many of Kethtippecannunk's residents were French and speculated that it was connected to, perhaps dependent upon, the French settlement of Detroit.|$|E
5|$|Hessen {{participated in}} fleet {{maneuvers}} in February 1908 in the Baltic Sea and more fleet training off Helgoland in May–June. In July, Hessen {{and the rest}} of the fleet sailed into the Atlantic Ocean to conduct a major training cruise. Prince Heinrich had pressed for such a cruise the previous year, arguing that it would prepare the fleet for overseas operations and would break up the monotony of training in German waters, though tensions with Britain over the developing Anglo-German naval arms race were high. The fleet departed Kiel on 17 July, passed through the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal to the North Sea, and continued on to the Atlantic. During the cruise, Hessen stopped at Santa Cruz de Tenerife in the Canary Islands. The fleet returned to Germany on 13 August. The autumn maneuvers followed from 27 August to 12 September. Later that year, the fleet toured coastal German cities as part of an effort to increase public support for naval expenditures. The next year—1909—followed much the same pattern as in 1908. Another cruise into the Atlantic was conducted from 7 July to 1 August, during which Hessen stopped in El Ferrol, Spain. While on the way back to Germany, the High Seas Fleet was received by the British Royal Navy in Spithead. Late in the year, Admiral Henning von Holtzendorff became the commander of the High Seas Fleet. His tenure as fleet commander was marked with strategic experimentation, owing to the increased threat the latest underwater weapons posed and the fact that the new s were <b>too</b> <b>wide</b> to pass through the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal. Accordingly, the fleet was transferred from Kiel to Wilhelmshaven on 1 April 1910.|$|E
40|$|Extract] Foraging by feral pigs can {{strongly}} affect vegetation assemblages and so <b>too</b> <b>wider</b> ecological processes, although {{how this}} impacts upon freshwater ecosystems and their inhabitants have seldom been studied. Between May and October 2008, we assessed the ecological effects of pig foraging activities {{in a pair}} of fenced and unfenced ephemeral floodplain lagoons at Lakefield National Park on Cape York Peninsula, and from July we estimated the comparative effect of pig disturbance on the resident freshwater turtle fauna in each lagoon. Foraging by feral pigs caused major changes to aquatic macrophyte communities and as a consequence, to the proportional amounts of open water and bare ground. The destruction of macrophyte communities and upheaved wetland sediments significantly affected wetland light penetration and water clarity, and caused prolonged anoxia and pH imbalances in the unfenced treatment. The combined effects of vegetation destruction and the subsequent excretion of pig wastes caused high levels of nutrient enrichment in the unfenced lagoon...|$|R

5|$|The British had {{determined}} the Tug Argan gap {{the best possible}} place to make a stand out of the three roadways, and also the most likely invasion route, and thus positioned {{the bulk of the}} army around it. On the British right, to the north of Tug Argan, were three companies of the 3/15 Punjab Regiment, set upon a group of west-facing strongpoints overlooking the rough wilderness that lay beside the road. South of them lay the gap itself, manned by a contingent of Rhodesian troops. They sat upon a line of small hills, named from north to south Black, Knobbly, Mill, Observation, and Castle Hills. These hills, positioned in a row with 2,000–2,500 yard gaps in between, housed machine-gun nests surrounded with light rings of barbed wire and served as the Rhodesians' defensive strongholds and the main defense for the British of the pass. On the British left were another group of Indian troops, located upon the aptly named 'Punjab Ridge' facing directly to the south. Unfortunately for the British, the front was <b>too</b> <b>wide</b> for the troops available, and the gaps between hills too large, leaving the defenses prone to infiltration. Also, due to the hills being in a single line, the position lacked depth. Meanwhile, De Simone, arriving {{at the site of the}} impending battle on 10 August, set his forces directly opposite the British positions. On the left, II Brigade prepared to advance through the wilderness towards the Punjab troops in the north. In the Italian center, XIV Brigade faced the Rhodesian hilltop positions within the pass, and XV Brigade looked north towards Punjab Ridge on the Italian right. Behind them were XIII Brigade and the armored vehicles.|$|E

50|$|Economic {{disadvantage}} alone may {{not always}} lead to increased sex ratio, claimed Sen in 1990. For example, in sub-Saharan Africa, {{one of the most}} economically disadvantaged regions of the world, there is an excess of women. So, if economic disadvantage is uncorrelated with sex ratio in Africa, some other factor(s) may be at play. More detailed analysis of African demographics, in 2002, suggests that Africa <b>too</b> has <b>wide</b> variation in birth sex ratios (from 1.01 in Bantu populations of East Africa to 1.08 in Nigeria and Ethiopia). Thus economic disadvantage remains a possible unresolved hypothesis for Africa as well.|$|R
