40|$|Much {{attention}} has been paid to the theoretical explanation of the empirical success of AdaBoost. The most influential work is <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> theory, which is essentially an upper bound for the generalization error of any voting classifier in terms of <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> distribu-tion over <b>the</b> training data. However, important questions were raised about <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> explanation. Breiman (1999) proved a bound in terms of <b>the</b> minimum <b>margin,</b> which is sharper than <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> distribution bound. He argued that <b>the</b> minimum <b>margin</b> would be better in predicting the generalization error. Grove and Schuurmans (1998) developed an algorithm called LP-AdaBoost which maximizes <b>the</b> minimum <b>margin</b> while keeping all other factors the same as AdaBoost.

40|$|Abstract. Support vector {{machines}} (SVMs) and Boosting are {{possibly the}} two most popular learning approaches {{during the past two}} decades. It is well known that <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> is a fundamental issue of SVMs, whereas recently <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> theory for Boosting has been defended, establish-ing a connection between these two mainstream approaches. The recent theoretical results disclosed that <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> distribution rather than a single margin is really crucial for the generalization performance, and suggested to optimize <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> distribution by maximizing the mar-gin mean and minimizing <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> variance simultaneously. Inspired by this recognition, we advocate <b>the</b> large <b>margin</b> distribution learning, a promising research direction that has exhibited superiority in algorithm designs to traditional large margin learning. ...|$|R

5|$|A {{metalloid}} is {{an element}} with properties in between, or that are a mixture of, those of metals and nonmetals, and which is therefore hard to classify as either a metal or a nonmetal. This is a generic definition that draws on metalloid attributes consistently cited in the literature. Difficulty of categorisation is a key attribute. Most elements have a mixture of metallic and nonmetallic properties, and can be classified according to which set of properties is more pronounced. Only the elements at or near <b>the</b> <b>margins,</b> lacking a sufficiently clear preponderance of either metallic or nonmetallic properties, are classified as metalloids.|$|E

Diptychs were usually commissioned for private devotion, and van Eyck would have expected the viewer to contemplate text and imagery in unison.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its high}} level of {{nutrient}} requirements, cabbage is prone to nutrient deficiencies, including boron, calcium, phosphorus and potassium. There are several physiological disorders that can affect the postharvest appearance of cabbage. Internal tip burn occurs when <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> of inside leaves turn brown, but the outer leaves look normal. Necrotic spot is where there are oval sunken spots a few millimeters across that are often grouped around the midrib. In pepper spot, tiny black spots occur on the areas between the veins, which can increase during storage.|$|E
40|$|Efficient post-election audits {{select the}} number of {{machines}} or precincts to audit {{based in part on}} <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> of victory (<b>the</b> number of ballots that must be changed in order to change the outcome); a close election needs more auditing than a landslide victory.

However, for instant runoff voting (IRV) elections, it is not immediately obvious how to compute <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> of victory. This paper presents algorithmic techniques for computing <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> of victory for IRV elections. We evaluate our method by attempting to compute <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> of victory for 25 IRV elections in the United States. <b>The</b> <b>margin</b> of victory computed can then be used to conduct post-election audits more effectively for IRV elections. ...|$|R

While there is no issue, per se, with placing <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> at <b>the</b> gumline, problems may arise when placing <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> too subgingivally (below the gumline).

5|$|In {{most cases}} of early-stage NSCLC, {{removal of a}} lobe of lung (lobectomy) is the {{surgical}} treatment of choice.

Radioactive iodine brachytherapy at <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> of wedge excision may reduce the risk of recurrence. Rarely, removal of a whole lung (pneumonectomy) is performed. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and VATS lobectomy use a minimally invasive approach to lung cancer surgery.

Net migration figures remained slightly negative until 1990 because Sélestat and Central Alsace were on <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> of the metropolitan areas of Strasbourg and Colmar and lacked attractivity.

5|$|The {{expansion}} of Christianity from <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> of Scotland was {{key to the}} development of this period, as it became the religion of many inhabitants. Initially influenced by the Celtic tradition originating from what is now Ireland, {{by the end of the}} era it had become integrated into the organisational structures of the Catholic Church. This period produced some highly distinctive monumental and ornamental art, culminating in the development of the Insular art style, common across Britain and Ireland. The most impressive structures included nucleated hill forts and, after the introduction of Christianity, churches and monasteries. The period also saw the beginnings of Scottish literature in British, Old English, Gaelic and Latin languages.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaves of}} B. grossa are adapted to a dry climate.

Cladistic analysis suggests this species and its relatives in the series Abietinae developed long narrow leaves with inrolled margins as they invaded drier climates in Australia's southwest, having evolved from ancestors with broad leaves.|$|E
