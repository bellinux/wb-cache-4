5|$|In the past, the baths {{served as}} {{community}} spaces for gay men. Even now, some men {{choose to go}} to the baths with their friends (even though <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> necessarily have sex with each other). While many men talk to each other at the baths, even forming long-lasting friendships or relationships, many others do not, preferring, for various reasons, anonymity.|$|E

5|$|About 20 large (40–150m across) ejecta blocks {{have been}} identified, {{embedded}} in Ida's regolith. Ejecta blocks constitute the largest {{pieces of the}} regolith. Because ejecta blocks are expected to break down quickly by impact events, those present on the surface must have been either formed recently or uncovered by an impact event. Most of them are located within the craters Lascaux and Mammoth, but <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> have been produced there. This area attracts debris due to Ida's irregular gravitational field. Some blocks may have been ejected from the young crater Azzurra {{on the opposite side}} of the asteroid.|$|E
5|$|According to Tough, an {{extraterrestrial}} civilization {{might want}} to send various types of information to humanity by means of artifacts, such as an Encyclopædia Galactica, containing the wisdom of countless extraterrestrial cultures, or perhaps an invitation to engage in diplomacy with them. A civilization that sees itself {{on the brink of}} decline might use the abilities it still possesses to send probes throughout the galaxy, with its cultures, values, religions, sciences, technologies, and laws, so that <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> die along with their civilization.|$|E

Upon graduation from USMAPS, these candidates are appointed to the academy if they receive the recommendation of the USMAPS Commandant and meet medical admission requirements.|$|E
5|$|Historians have {{generally}} accepted Bede's report of Coenred's and Offa's abdications, but Barbara Yorke {{has suggested that}} <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> have relinquished their thrones voluntarily. There are instances of kings being forcibly removed and placed in holy orders to make them ineligible for kingship; one such was King Osred II of Northumbria, who was forced into a monastery. On the other hand, if Coenred went willingly, as Bede relates, then the apparently friendly relationship between Offa and Coenred, his overlord, {{makes it clear that}} the relationship between an overlord and his underking was not hostile in every case.|$|E
5|$|In its {{broadest}} definition, mimicry {{can include}} non-living models. The specific terms masquerade and mimesis are sometimes used when the models are inanimate. For example, {{animals such as}} flower mantises, planthoppers and geometer moth caterpillars resemble twigs, bark, leaves or flowers. Many animals bear eyespots, which are hypothesized to resemble the eyes of larger animals. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> resemble any specific organism's eyes, {{and whether or not}} animals respond to them as eyes is also unclear. Nonetheless, eyespots are the subject of a rich contemporary literature.|$|E

5|$|Martensite {{has a lower}} density (it expands {{during the}} cooling) than does austenite, so that the {{transformation}} between them results in a change of volume. In this case, expansion occurs. Internal stresses from this expansion generally {{take the form of}} compression on the crystals of martensite and tension on the remaining ferrite, with a fair amount of shear on both constituents. If quenching is done improperly, the internal stresses can cause a part to shatter as it cools. At the very least, they cause internal work hardening and other microscopic imperfections. It is common for quench cracks to form when steel is water quenched, although <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> always be visible.|$|E
5|$|Participants in est {{are told}} that they cannot take notes during the course, {{and at the end}} of the seminar the {{instructor}} declines to go over a review of the training. In order to participate in the course, trainees must adhere to agreements which include: <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> exit the course facility except during specified break time, they cannot sit next to someone they knew before coming to the course, and they cannot take unprescribed medications or alcohol for the week prior to the training.|$|E
5|$|The superb fairywren is a {{cooperative}} breeding species, with pairs {{or groups of}} 3–5 birds maintaining and defending small territories year-round. The group consists of a social pair {{with one or more}} male or female helper birds that were hatched in the territory, though <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> necessarily be the offspring of the main pair. These birds assist in defending the territory and feeding and rearing the young. Birds in a group roost side-by-side in dense cover as well as engaging in mutual preening.|$|E
50|$|Geese {{of various}} species are typical to China, <b>they</b> <b>may</b> be {{domestic}} or wild. Due to their migratory nature, wild geese {{tend to be}} a seasonal presence, either as temporary, nomadic settlers in an area, or often as seasonal migrants whose flight path takes them over vast areas where <b>they</b> <b>may</b> or <b>may</b> <b>not</b> land to rest at night.|$|R

5|$|Before mating, {{males and}} females may stridulate, or vibrate the objects they are on. In the Meloidae, the male climbs onto the dorsum of the female and strokes his {{antennae}} on her head, palps, and antennae. In Eupompha, the male draws his antennae along his longitudinal vertex. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> mate at all {{if they do not}} perform the precopulatory ritual. This mating behaviour may be different amongst dispersed populations of the same species. For example, the mating of a Russian population of tansy beetle (Chysolina graminis) is preceded by an elaborate ritual involving the male tapping the female's eyes, pronotum and antennae with its antennae, which is not evident in the population of this species in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Ceasefire {{negotiations}} {{began in}} 1285, {{and ended with}} Narathihapate finally agreeing to submit in June 1286. The Burmese embassy, received by the emperor in Beijing in January 1287, agreed to a treaty that acknowledged the suzerainty of the Yuan dynasty or the Mongol Empire over the Pagan Empire and annual payments in taxes to the Yunnan government {{in exchange for the}} evacuation of Mongol troops from northern Burma. But the treaty never really took effect as Narathihapate was assassinated in July 1287, and no authority who could honor the treaty emerged. The Mongol command at Yunnan now deemed the imperial order to withdraw void, and ordered an invasion of central Burma. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> have reached Pagan, and even if they did, after having suffered heavy casualties, they returned to Tagaung.|$|E
5|$|Elections {{are governed}} by the State Electoral Commission and electoral boards. Members of those bodies are {{required}} to have a university degree in law, and <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> be members of any political party. The State Electoral Commission prepares and manages elections in accordance with legislation, appoints lower-ranking election-commission and board members, issues directives to such bodies and supervises their work. The State Electoral Commission compiles and publishes candidate lists, supervises the legality of political campaigns and compiles and publishes election results. All members of election boards (or their legal deputies) must be present at assigned polling stations at all times while the polling station is open. The board verifies the identity of voters against the list of registered voters and records the turnout. The turnout number is later checked against number of votes cast; {{if the number of}} votes exceeds the turnout, the election at that polling station must be repeated. Votes are tallied by hand, and that information is forwarded (along with all other records kept at the polling station) to the State Electoral Commission.|$|E
50|$|The {{language}} of the Kakh, old inhabitants of Kakheti and Tusheti in Eastern Georgia. The Kakh apparently called themselves Kabatsas and their territory Kakh-Batsa. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> or <b>may</b> <b>not</b> be ancestral to the modern Bats, and <b>they</b> <b>may</b> or <b>may</b> <b>not</b> be closely related to them. They were assimilated (completely or almost completely, depending on if one believes {{the theory that the}} Bats are descended from them) by the Kartlians to speak Georgian.|$|R
50|$|They are erect plants, {{usually with}} long taproots. The fleshy to {{leathery}} leaves form a basal rosette at the root. The basal leaves {{may be different}} from those near the inflorescence. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> or <b>may</b> <b>not</b> have stipules. Minor leaf veins occur. The leaf blade margins are entire or crenate.|$|R

5|$|Exclusive Jurisdiction is {{a concept}} whereby only one Grand Lodge will be {{recognised}} in any geographical area. If two Grand Lodges claim jurisdiction over the same area, the other Grand Lodges will {{have to choose between}} them, and <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> all decide to recognise the same one. (In 1849, for example, the Grand Lodge of New York split into two rival factions, each claiming to be the legitimate Grand Lodge. Other Grand Lodges had to choose between them until the schism was healed.) Exclusive Jurisdiction can be waived when the two over-lapping Grand Lodges are themselves in Amity and agree to share jurisdiction (for example, since the Grand Lodge of Connecticut is in Amity with the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Connecticut, the principle of Exclusive Jurisdiction does not apply, and other Grand Lodges may recognise both).|$|E
5|$|In {{selecting}} the on-disc songs, FreeStyleGames recognized that engaging guitar tracks are not strictly limited to rock music, and included other genres into the mix. According to designer Jim Norris, their selection process began with identifying songs {{that would be}} expected by players {{to be on a}} Guitar Hero title, and then determining which of those songs which they could license. Once they had obtained the license, FreeStyleGames would mark up the song for the note highways and determined how much fun these songs would be to play. Finally, they balanced the song selection in the game to give players a combination of songs they know and those <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> recognize but would be enjoyable.|$|E
5|$|Much of the sunnah is {{recorded}} in the Hadith. Initially, Muhammad had instructed his followers not to write down his acts, so <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> confuse it with the Qur'an. However, he did ask his followers to disseminate his sayings orally. As {{long as he was}} alive, any doubtful record could be confirmed as true or false by simply asking him. His death, however, gave rise to confusion over Muhammad's conduct. Thus the Hadith were established. Due to problems of authenticity, the science of Hadith (Arabic: `Ulum al-hadith) is established. It is a method of textual criticism developed by early Muslim scholars in determining the veracity of reports attributed to Muhammad. This is achieved by analyzing the text of the report, the scale of the report's transmission, the routes through which the report was transmitted, and the individual narrators involved in its transmission. On the basis of these criteria, various Hadith classifications developed.|$|E
