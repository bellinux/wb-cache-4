5|$|To {{enforce the}} Reconstruction Amendments, Congress passed the Enforcement Acts in the 1870s. The Acts criminalized the {{obstruction}} of a citizen's voting rights and provided for federal supervision of <b>the</b> <b>electoral</b> <b>process,</b> including voter registration. However, in 1875 the Supreme Court struck down {{parts of the}} legislation as unconstitutional in United States v. Cruikshank and United States v. Reese. After the Reconstruction Era ended in 1877, enforcement of these laws became erratic, and in 1894, Congress repealed most of their provisions.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to his personal role in Parliament, Bute sought to control the votes {{of members of the}} House of Commons, primarily to ensure the passage of legislation affecting his business interests. Initially, the Isle of Bute had only 21 voters who were dominated by his private estate, but it only returned a Member of Parliament in alternate elections, and his estates in Luton were too limited to allow him to influence <b>the</b> <b>electoral</b> <b>process</b> there. The best remaining option for Bute was to control the voting in Cardiff, but even here he had to choose his candidate carefully and apply careful financial pressure through his control of leases and rents to ensure their election.|$|E

In Namibia, the Council of Churches in Namibia (CCN) was UNHCR's implementing partner.

The logistics of managing the returnees was largely delegated to the Australian contingent.|$|E
5|$|Following Nixon, the Democratic Party's state {{convention}} {{instituted a}} rule that only whites could vote in its primary elections; the Court unanimously upheld this rule as constitutional in Grovey v. Townsend (1935), distinguishing the discrimination by a private organization {{from that of the}} state in the previous primary cases. However, in United States v. Classic (1941), the Court ruled that primary elections were an essential part of <b>the</b> <b>electoral</b> <b>process,</b> undermining the reasoning in Grovey. Based on Classic, the Court in Smith v. Allwright (1944), overruled Grovey, ruling that denying non-white voters a ballot in primary elections was a violation of the Fifteenth Amendment. In the last of the Texas primary cases, Terry v. Adams (1953), the Court ruled that black plaintiffs were entitled to damages from a group that organized whites-only pre-primary elections with the assistance of Democratic party officials.|$|E

40|$|An {{election}} is a core {{part of any}} global democracy. Elections provide citizens {{with the opportunity to}} voice their opinions. South Africa achieved democracy {{for the first time in}} 1994 and has had four successful national elections since then. All of these elections have been declared “free and fair” according to <b>the</b> Independent <b>Electoral</b> Commission (IEC). However, there have been various challenges facing the current South African <b>electoral</b> <b>process.</b> This research, therefore examines alternative methods to improve the current South African <b>electoral</b> <b>process.</b> This research firstly identifies the various challenges and characteristics associated with <b>the</b> current <b>electoral</b> <b>process</b> in South Africa. This research study proposes, to incorporate Information and Communication Technology (ICT) into <b>the</b> South African <b>electoral</b> <b>process.</b> Thus, arguing that utilizing ICT could potentially improve the process. Various countries worldwide have investigated different methods to improve their <b>electoral</b> <b>processes.</b> Countries such as India, Brazil, Estonia and the USA have incorporated ICT into their <b>electoral</b> <b>processes,</b> known as electronic voting (e-voting). Therefore, this research study investigates countries such as India, Brazil, Estonia and the USA which opted to implement e-voting into their <b>electoral</b> <b>process.</b> In addition, various e-voting technologies and their capabilities are explored in detail in this research study. The conclusions drawn from the examination of <b>the</b> <b>electoral</b> <b>processes</b> of countries that utilize e-voting, contributed to the achievement of the primary objective in this research. As a result, to address the various challenges facing <b>the</b> current <b>electoral</b> <b>process</b> in South Africa, a process model was developed called an E-voting Process Model, which depicts two <b>electoral</b> <b>processes</b> namely, an optical scan polling station voting process and an online voting process.

5|$|In 1892, Cleveland had campaigned {{against the}} Lodge Bill, {{which would have}} {{strengthened}} voting rights protections through the appointing of federal supervisors of congressional elections upon a petition from the citizens of any district. The Enforcement Act of 1871 had provided for a detailed federal overseeing of <b>the</b> <b>electoral</b> <b>process,</b> from registration to the certification of returns. Cleveland succeeded in ushering in the 1894 repeal of this law (ch. 25, 28 Stat. 36). The pendulum thus swung from stronger attempts to protect voting rights to the repealing of voting rights protections; this in turn led to unsuccessful attempts to have the federal courts protect voting rights in Giles v. Harris, 189 U.S. 475 (1903), and Giles v. Teasley, 193 U.S. 146 (1904).|$|E
5|$|Matilda and Henry {{remained}} childless, {{but neither}} party {{was considered to}} be infertile and contemporary chroniclers blamed their situation on the Emperor and his sins against the Church. In early 1122, the couple travelled down the Rhine together as Henry continued to suppress the ongoing political unrest, but by now he was suffering from cancer. His condition worsened and he died on 23 May 1125 in Utrecht, leaving Matilda in the protection of their nephew Frederick, the heir to his estates. Before his death, he left the imperial insignia in the control of Matilda, but it is unclear what instructions he gave her {{about the future of the}} Empire, which faced another leadership election. Archbishop Adalbert subsequently convinced Matilda that she should give him the insignia, and the Archbishop led <b>the</b> <b>electoral</b> <b>process</b> which appointed Lothair of Supplinburg, a former enemy of Henry, as the new King of the Romans.|$|E
5|$|The NMP {{scheme was}} not {{introduced}} without controversy, which may {{lead one to}} question {{the effectiveness of the}} scheme in strengthening representative democracy. Despite the protests of many PAP MPs, the party whip was enforced to effect the passing of this scheme. Criticism of the scheme mainly revolved around the dilution of the democratic legitimacy of the Parliament since the electorate has no say in choosing the NMP based on his or her merits. Further, there may be doubts as to the NMP's commitment and willingness to serve as an MP, since the NMP bypasses <b>the</b> <b>electoral</b> <b>process.</b> The scheme has also given rise to allegations that it serves as another platform for the PAP to undercut support for the opposition.|$|E

5|$|At the Third Jakarta Informal Meeting in 1990, {{under the}} Australian-sponsored Cambodian Peace Plan, {{representatives of the}} CGDK and the PRK agreed to a power-sharing {{arrangement}} by forming a unity government known as the Supreme National Council (SNC). The SNC's role was to represent Cambodian sovereignty on the international stage, while the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) was tasked with supervising the country's domestic policies until a Cambodian government was elected by the people through a peaceful, democratic process. Cambodia's pathway to peace proved to be difficult, as Khmer Rouge leaders decided {{not to participate in}} the general elections, but instead they chose to disrupt <b>the</b> <b>electoral</b> <b>process</b> by launching military attacks on UN peacekeepers and killing ethnic Vietnamese migrants. In May 1993, Sihanouk's FUNCINPEC movement defeated the Cambodian People's Party (CPP), formerly the Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party (KPRP), to win the general elections. However, the CPP leadership refused to accept defeat and they announced that the eastern provinces of Cambodia, where most of the CPP's votes were drawn from, would secede from Cambodia. To avoid such an outcome, Norodom Ranariddh, the leader of FUNCINPEC agreed to form a coalition government with the CPP. Shortly afterwards, the constitutional monarchy was restored and the Khmer Rouge was outlawed by the newly formed Cambodian Government.|$|E
