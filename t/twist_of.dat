40|$|We {{prove the}} {{analytic}} continuation <b>of</b> certain linear <b>twists</b> <b>of</b> L-functions of degree 2 in the Selberg class. This extends a theorem by S. Voronin on linear <b>twists</b> <b>of</b> the L-functions associated with modular forms of level 1. The proofs are quite different. Indeed, Voronin used modularity, while {{we use a}} transformation formula for linear <b>twists</b> <b>of</b> L-functions in the Selberg class...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Given an {{algebraic}} curve C /Q having points everywhere {{locally and}} endowed with a suitable involution, {{we show that}} there exists a positive density family <b>of</b> prime quadratic <b>twists</b> <b>of</b> C violating the Hasse principle.

40|$|In {{this paper}} <b>twists</b> <b>of</b> reduced locally compact quantum groups are studied. <b>Twists</b> <b>of</b> the dual coaction on a reduced crossed product are {{introduced}} and the twisted dual coactions are proved {{to satisfy a}} type of Takesaki-Takai duality. The twisted Takesaki-Takai duality implies that <b>twists</b> <b>of</b> discrete, torsion-free quantum groups are torsion-free. Cocycle <b>twists</b> <b>of</b> duals of semisimple, compact Lie are studied leading to a locally compact quantum group contained in the Drinfeld-Jimbo algebra which gives a dual notion of Woronowicz deformations for semisimple, compact Lie groups. These cocycle twists are proven to be torsion-free whenever the Lie group is simply connected. Comment: 17 pages, to appear in Algebras and Representation Theory, [URL]...|$|R

40|$|<b>Twisted</b> homomorphisms <b>of</b> bialgebras are bialgebra homomorphisms {{from the}} first into Drinfeld twistings of the second. They possess a {{composition}} operation extending composition of bialgebra homomorphisms. Gauge transformations <b>of</b> <b>twists,</b> compatible with adjacent homomorphisms, give rise to gauge transformation <b>of</b> <b>twisted</b> homomorphisms, which behave nicely with respect to compositions. Here we study (gauge classes <b>of)</b> <b>twisted</b> automorphisms <b>of</b> cocommutative Hopf algebras. After revising well-known relations between <b>twists,</b> <b>twisted</b> forms <b>of</b> bialgebras and $R$-matrices (for commutative bialgebras) we describe <b>twisted</b> automorphisms <b>of</b> universal enveloping algebras...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{method is}} {{outlined}} in [El 94] for constructing rational points on quadratic <b>twists</b> <b>of</b> elliptic curves. Assuming the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, the method also produces {{a way to}} identify curves of rank at least three among certain quadratic <b>twists</b> <b>of</b> an arbitrary elliptic curve of rank zero. In this paper, we describe a use of the GP/PARI package {{to carry out the}} construction for a number of curves. In particular, we study the frequency of curves of rank three among the quadratic <b>twists</b> <b>of</b> several rank zero curves with no non-trivial isogenies...|$|R
40|$|In this study, a {{geometrical}} model {{was introduced to}} improve the hair trapping via a surface contacting the yarn-twisting triangle during ring <b>twisting</b> <b>of</b> two single yarns. The fiber-trapping improvement with the contact surface was analyzed theoretically. Then, single Ne 80 ring cotton yarns were used to produce two-ply yarns under different ring-twisting conditions, namely conventional <b>twisting,</b> dry <b>twisting</b> <b>of</b> yarns with a plane surface, wet <b>twisting</b> <b>of</b> yarns with a plane surface, dry <b>twisting</b> <b>of</b> yarns with a grooved surface, and wet <b>twisting</b> <b>of</b> yarns with a grooved surface. Plied yarn properties, including yarn hairiness, strength, and irregularity, were tested. The Student Newman Keuls (SNK) test and variation analysis were also {{carried out in the}} SPSS program to study the effect of different contact surfaces on related yarn properties; the significance level was 0. 05 for the SNK test and variation analysis. The hairiness of plied yarns was significantly reduced when twisting with the plane or grooved surface, especially for the wet twisting cases. This corresponds well with our model on improving fiber trapping. <br /...|$|R
5|$|Before {{the event}} aired live on pay-per-view, Carlito {{defeated}} Johnny Nitro {{in a dark}} match. The first match of the event was The Hardys (Matt and Jeff) versus Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch for the World Tag Team Championship.

5|$|In {{the next}} match, Matt Hardy and Montel Vontavious Porter faced Deuce 'n Domino for the WWE Tag Team Championship. Deuce 'n Domino {{dominated}} {{early in the}} match and mocked the champs because of their feud over the United States Championship, which MVP held. Deuce N' Domino took advantage of Hardy and MVP's fight {{with each other and}} isolated Hardy. Hardy tossed MVP out of the ring and delivered a <b>Twist</b> <b>of</b> Fate to Deuce and pinned Deuce. In result, MVP and Matt Hardy retained the WWE Tag Team Title.|$|E

5|$|Bobby Roode faced Jeff Hardy in {{the sixth}} encounter. Roode's fellow Team Canada member Petey Williams {{interfered}} in the contest distracting the referee, allowing Roode to attempt to hit Hardy with the a hockey stick. Hardy dodged the swing and countered with his signature <b>Twist</b> <b>of</b> Fate maneuver, forcing Roode's chin into his shoulder. Afterwards, Hardy jumped {{off the top of}} a padded turnbuckle onto both Williams and Roode at ringside. Later, Roode re-entered the ring with Hardy remaining at ringside, allowing Jeff Jarrett to attack Hardy from behind with a hockey stick. Jarrett then pushed Hardy into the ring with Roode covering for the pinfall victory at 9 minutes and 7 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Hardy {{returned}} from injury on the July 29 episode of Impact Wrestling, making an announcement that his brother, Matt, would face TNA World Heavyweight Champion Ethan Carter III in a Full Metal Mayhem match, in which Matt was unsuccessful. After a brief hiatus, Hardy returned on the August 26 episode of Impact Wrestling, {{where he and}} Matt made an agreement that if Matt would lose his second match against Carter for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, then Jeff would become his personal assistant. Matt was unsuccessful, and Jeff was forced to be Carter's assistant. On the September 21 episode of Impact Wrestling, after refusing to hit Spud, then hitting Carter with a <b>Twist</b> <b>of</b> Fate, Hardy quit as Carter's personal assistant, therefore also (storyline) quitting TNA. On the September 30 episode of Impact Wrestling, TNA President Dixie Carter announced that Hardy would be the special guest referee in the three-way dance TNA World Heavyweight Championship match between Carter, his brother Matt, and Drew Galloway at Bound for Glory. At the event, Hardy turned on Carter by hitting him with a steel chair with Matt hitting the <b>Twist</b> <b>of</b> Fate, thus giving Matt his first TNA World Heavyweight Championship. Hardy made an appearance on January 5, 2016 episode of Impact Wrestling on its live Pop TV debut backstage and ringside to support his brother Matt in the semi-finals and finals of the TNA World Title Series, which Matt had later lost.|$|E

5|$|In the 1985 Indianapolis 500, he {{was passed}} {{for the lead}} by Danny Sullivan in Turn One on lap 139. Immediately after {{completing}} the pass, Sullivan spun in front of Andretti. A caution for the spin, minimized the time Sullivan would lose to Andretti by pitting to replace 20 laps later Sullivan took the lead for good when he passed Andretti without incident. Andretti dominated the 1987 Indianapolis 500, leading 170 of the first 177 laps of the race. His lead was so large, that he was advised to slow his pace to preserve his equipment. In a cruel <b>twist</b> <b>of</b> fate, when Andretti started running slower, his reduced engine rpm's created a harmonic imbalance in his turbocharged Ilmor/Chevrolet V8 {{that led to a}} broken valve spring with 20 laps to go.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} match Matt Hardy faced Edge, who was {{accompanied}} by Lita, inside a Steel Cage. As the bell rang, Hardy tried to throw Edge face-first into the cage wall but didn't succeed. Back and forth action took place until Hardy got the advantage over Edge. Lita began to climb up {{the outside of the}} cage, but Hardy hit the cage, making Lita fall off. As Lita distracted Hardy, Edge started to crawl out. Hardy noticed this, grabbed Edge, and threw him into a corner. Lita interfered, which led to Hardy delivering a <b>Twist</b> <b>of</b> Fate to Lita. Edge executed a Spear on Hardy for a near-fall. After knocking Edge off the turnbuckle, Hardy delivered a leg drop {{off the top of the}} cage before pinning Edge for the win.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} {{televised}} match, Edge and Chris Masters (representing Raw) faced Rey Mysterio and Matt Hardy (representing SmackDown!). Before the match, Edge refused to wrestle, saying he didn't care about representing Raw and chose Snitsky as his replacement.

Afterwards, Hardy and Snitsky were tagged in, leading to Hardy getting the advantage as he delivered a Side Effect and DDT on Snitsky. Back and forth action took place between both teams. The match ended when Mysterio performed the 619 on Masters, before Hardy performed the <b>Twist</b> <b>of</b> Fate on Snitsky. Mysterio pinned Masters to give SmackDown! the win over Raw.|$|E
5|$|On August28, 1869, {{three men}} deserted the expedition, {{convinced}} {{that they could not}} possibly survive the trip through the Grand Canyon. They were killed by Native Americans after making it to the rim of the canyon; two days later, the expedition ran the last of the Grand Canyon rapids and reached St. Thomas. Powell led a second expedition in 1871, this time with financial backing from the U.S. government. The explorers named many features along the Colorado and Green rivers, including Glen Canyon, the Dirty Devil River, Flaming Gorge, and the Gates of Lodore. In what is perhaps a <b>twist</b> <b>of</b> irony, modern-day Lake Powell, which floods Glen Canyon, is also named for their leader.|$|E
