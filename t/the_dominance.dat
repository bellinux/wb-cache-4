5|$|As {{early as}} 1914, the British Admiral Percy Scott {{predicted}} that battleships {{would soon be}} made irrelevant by aircraft.

40|$|This paper studies three {{notions of}} fuzzy {{dominance}} based on credibility measure, namely, <b>the</b> fuzzy mean-risk <b>dominance,</b> <b>the</b> rst credibilistic <b>dominance</b> and <b>the</b> second credibilistic <b>dominance.</b> More precisely, we introduce and examine some {{properties of the}} Fuzzy Lower Partial Moments (FLPM) of a fuzzy variable and, we deduce the Fuzzy Kappa index (FK) of a fuzzy variable, that is, a risk-adjusted performance measure of an asset or a portfolio with fuzzy return. Based on the aforementioned notion, we introduce <b>the</b> fuzzy mean-risk <b>dominance</b> of two fuzzy variables and we characterize it in three speci c and interesting cases. We recall <b>the</b> rst credibilistic <b>dominance</b> and <b>the</b> second credibilistic <b>dominance</b> for fuzzy variables introduced earlier by Peng et al. [20]. We characterize <b>the</b> rst credibilistic <b>dominance</b> and determine some of its properties. We introduce and characterize the notion of crossing points of distributions of two fuzzy numbers {{and use them to}} characterize <b>the</b> second credibilistic <b>dominance</b> for fuzzy numbers. We justify that <b>the</b> rst credibilistic <b>dominance</b> is stronger than <b>the</b> fuzzy mean-risk <b>dominance</b> and <b>the</b> second credibilistic <b>dominance,</b> and neither of these two later implies the other...|$|R
40|$|We give a gauge-independent {{definition}} of Abelian <b>dominance</b> in <b>the</b> Wilson loop operator and a constructive proof of <b>the</b> Abelian <b>dominance</b> through a non-Abelian Stokes theorem via lattice regularization. We obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for <b>the</b> Abelian <b>dominance</b> in <b>the</b> Wilson loop operator in the fundamental representation. In the continuum limit, the gauge field is decomposed such that <b>the</b> Abelian <b>dominance</b> is given as an exact operator relation, {{leading to the}} exact (100 %) Abelian dominance. On a lattice, we estimate the deviation from <b>the</b> exact Abelian <b>dominance</b> due to non-zero lattice spacing. In order to obtain <b>the</b> best Abelian <b>dominance</b> on a lattice by minimizing the deviation, we discuss how to decompose the gauge field variable into the dominant part and the remaining one to be decoupled on a lattice.

Luthadel {{is the heart of}} the Lord Ruler's power, as well as the site of his palace, Kredik Shaw. Before the Lord Ruler remade the world, Luthadel was a mountainous region known as Terris. To hide the true {{location}} of Old Terris and the Well of Ascension, the Lord Ruler moved the mountains elsewhere and named that region [...] "Terris" [...] instead. Terris is the ancestral home of the Terris people. It is a mountainous region located north of <b>the</b> Northern <b>Dominance.</b> <b>The</b> Terris <b>Dominance</b> is <b>the</b> only <b>Dominance</b> to retain its original name.

Later it came under the control of a Skaa dominated government led by a man calling himself 'the Citizen'. Urteau is also famous for its canals that mysteriously ran dry. It plays a key role in the third novel. Fadrex City is an important cross roads city in <b>the</b> Western <b>Dominance.</b> Although all cities outside of Luthadel are forbidden from having walls, Fadrex City has a natural rock formation that makes it very defensible. Lord Cett made this city his base after the fall of the Lord Ruler for this very reason.|$|R

5|$|In December 1964, Kenya {{was officially}} proclaimed a republic. Kenyatta became its {{executive}} President, a role combining {{the head of}} state and head of government. Over the course of 1965 and 1966, various constitutional amendments were made that enhanced the President's power. For instance, a May 1966 amendment gave the president the ability to order the detention of individuals without trial if the security of the state was regarded as threatened. Kenyatta sought to attain the support of Kenya's second largest tribal group, the Luo, thus appointing the Luo activist Odinga as his Vice President. However, the Kikuyu—who made up around 20 percent of the Kenyan population—still held most of the important government and administrative positions in the country. This contributed to a perception among many in the country that independence had simply seen <b>the</b> <b>dominance</b> of a European elite replaced by <b>the</b> <b>dominance</b> of a Kikuyu elite.|$|E

Our findings indicate that the presence of an important/salient categorical attribute facilitates “editing out” of the asymmetrically dominated option, weakening <b>the</b> asymmetric <b>dominance</b> effect. Further, when initial category‐based elimination is enforced, <b>the</b> asymmetric <b>dominance</b> effect and <b>the</b> tendency to prefer a middle option are both mitigated. ...|$|R

This type of games has multiple strict equilibria, and therefore the identification of testable predictions is very difficult.

However, we apply <b>the</b> risk <b>dominance</b> criterion suggested by Harsanyi and Selten and show that it always selects the equilibrium where the leader is the firm having some ini-tial advantage. We then perform an experimental analysis to test whether <b>the</b> risk <b>dominance</b> prediction {{is supported by the}} behaviour of laboratory agents.
