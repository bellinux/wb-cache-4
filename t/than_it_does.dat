5|$|Following the 2011 Japanese nuclear accidents, Germany's federal {{government}} {{is working on a}} new plan for increasing energy efficiency and renewable energy commercialization, with a particular focus on offshore wind farms. Under the plan, large wind turbines will be erected far away from the coastlines, where the wind blows more consistently <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> on land, and where the enormous turbines won't bother the inhabitants. The plan aims to decrease Germany's dependence on energy derived from coal and nuclear power plants.|$|E
5|$|Fossils {{from the}} Pleistocene {{suggest that this}} species bred further south in Europe in the cool periods between glaciations <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> now. Its {{sensitivity}} to changing climate {{as well as to}} water table levels and the speed of vegetation growth has led to suggestions that its range is affected by global warming, and the ruff might act as an indicator species for monitoring climate change. Potential threats to this species may also include outbreaks of diseases to which it is susceptible such as influenza, botulism and avian malaria.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the oldest}} sectors of Dubrovnik was {{constructed}} around a Late Antique castle by the sea, which stretched landwards a bit more <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> today. It was constructed {{on the site of}} the Pre-Romanesque cathedral and the Rector's Palace, thus encircling the city's harbour. The harbour was designed and constructed by engineer Paskoje Miličević in the late 15th century. Notably, the harbour was noticeably painted on the palm of St. Blaise in a triptych painted by the artist Nikola Božidarević around 1500.|$|E
5|$|The town of Norwich {{was created}} on January19, 1793, {{comprising}} {{a much larger}} area <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> today. On April2, 1806, part of the town was split off {{to form a new}} town named Preston. A charter on April8, 1808, established the Norwich and Preston Turnpike, a turnpike connecting the town of Preston in the west to the town of Norwich in the east. The Norwich and Preston Turnpike was privately owned and maintained, as most turnpikes in New York were at the time.|$|E
5|$|An {{advantage}} held by Eurostar is {{the convenience}} {{and speed of}} the service: with shorter check-in times than at most airports and hence quicker boarding and less queueing and high punctuality, it takes less time to travel between central London and central Paris by high-speed rail <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> by air. Eurostar now has a dominant share of the combined rail–air market on its routes to Paris and Brussels. In 2004, it had a 66% share of the London–Paris market, and a 59% share of the London–Brussels market. In 2007, it achieved record market shares of 71% for London–Paris and 65% for London–Brussels routes.|$|E

5|$|In the 18th {{and early}} 19th century, Ceredigion had more {{industry}} <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> today; Cardigan was the commercial {{centre of the}} county; lead, silver and zinc were mined and Cardigan was the principal port of South Wales prior to the silting of its harbour. The economy became highly dependent on dairy farming and the rearing of livestock for the English market. During the last century, livestock farming has become less profitable, and the population of Cardiganshire has been in decline as people moved to the more prosperous parts of Wales or emigrated to other countries. More recently, the population has started rising again as elderly people move into the county for retirement, and various government and European Union initiatives have encouraged tourism and other alternative sources of income.|$|E
5|$|Interleukin 2 (IL-2) is {{a protein}} that helps T {{cells of the}} immune system attack {{pathogens}} and tumors. Unfortunately, its use as a cancer treatment is restricted due to serious side effects such as pulmonary edema. IL-2 binds to these pulmonary cells differently <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> to T cells, so IL-2 research involves understanding the differences between these binding mechanisms. In 2012, Folding@home assisted with the discovery of a form of IL-2 which is three hundred times more effective in its immune system role but carries fewer side effects. In experiments, this altered form significantly outperformed natural IL-2 in impeding tumor growth. Pharmaceutical companies have expressed interest in the mutant molecule, and the National Institutes of Health are testing it against a large variety of tumor models to try to accelerate its development as a therapeutic.|$|E
5|$|Negative {{pressure}} {{is believed to}} be a property of vacuum energy, but the exact nature and existence of dark energy remains one of the great mysteries of the Big Bang. Results from the WMAP team in 2008 are in accordance with a universe that consists of 73% dark energy, 23% dark matter, 4.6% regular matter and less than 1% neutrinos. According to theory, the energy density in matter decreases with the expansion of the universe, but the dark energy density remains constant (or nearly so) as the universe expands. Therefore, matter made up a larger fraction of the total energy of the universe in the past <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> today, but its fractional contribution will fall in the far future as dark energy becomes even more dominant.|$|E

5|$|The {{types of}} soil where the Valley of the Kings is located are an {{alternating}} sandwich of dense limestone and other sedimentary rock (which form the cliffs {{in the valley}} and the nearby Deir el-Bahri) and soft layers of marl. The sedimentary rock was originally deposited between 35–56 million years ago {{during a time when}} the precursor to the Mediterranean Sea covered an area that extended much further inland <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> today. During the Pleistocene the valley was carved out of the plateau by steady rains. There is currently little year-round rain in this part of Egypt, but there are occasional flash floods that hit the valley, dumping tons of debris into the open tombs.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} that ancestors of the fisher migrated to North America during the Pliocene era between 2.5 and 5 million years ago. Two extinct mustelids, M. palaeosinensis and M. anderssoni, {{have been found in}} eastern Asia. The first true fisher, M. divuliana, has only been found in North America. There are strong indications that M. divuliana is related to the Asian finds, which suggests a migration. M. pennanti has been found as early as the Late Pleistocene era, about 125,000 years ago. There are no major differences between the Pleistocene fisher and the modern fisher. Fossil evidence indicates that the fisher's range extended farther south <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> today.|$|E
5|$|When NY3 was {{assigned}} in 1924, it followed a significantly different routing through the North Country <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> today. NY3 entered Franklin County near Hogansburg and served Malone, Paul Smiths, Gabriels, and Harrietstown {{before leaving the}} county near Saranac Lake. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY3 was rerouted east of Watertown to follow its modern alignment through the North Country. The portion of NY3's former routing from Harrietstown to a junction southeast of Gabriels was designated as NY408 while the segment between Paul Smiths and the vicinity of Gabriels became part of NY192, an east–west highway extending from Paul Smiths to the realigned NY3 in Bloomingdale.|$|E

5|$|When {{the highway}} was first {{designated}} {{in the late}} 1910s, it extended farther south <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> today and ended well short of its current northern terminus. The southern end was added to another state highway, truncating M-18's length to roughly its current southern terminus in 1926. The northern end was also simultaneously extended {{for the first time}} with these revisions to the highway's routing. In the 1940s, the northern extension was reversed and then reinstated. M-18's course was last changed with the opening of three different freeways in the area in the 1960s and 1970s. The last extension in 1973 supplanted the M-144 designation from Roscommon north to Luzerne.|$|E
5|$|It {{lived in}} what is now {{southern}} Germany in the Late Jurassic period around 150million years ago, when Europe was an archipelago in a shallow warm tropical sea, much closer to the equator than it is now. Similar in shape to a European magpie, with the largest individuals possibly attaining the size of a raven, Archaeopteryx could grow to about 0.5metres (1.6ft) in length. Despite its small size, broad wings, and inferred ability to fly or glide, Archaeopteryx has more in common with other small Mesozoic dinosaurs <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> with modern birds. In particular, it shares the following features with the deinonychosaurs (dromaeosaurs and troodontids): jaws with sharp teeth, three fingers with claws, a long bony tail, hyperextensible second toes ("killing claw"), feathers (which suggest homeothermy), and various skeletal features. These features make Archaeopteryx a clear candidate for a transitional fossil between dinosaurs and birds, making it important in the study both of dinosaurs and of the origin of birds.|$|E
5|$|NY3 {{originally}} {{followed a}} vastly different alignment <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> today. In 1924, it {{was assigned to}} the New York portion of the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway, an auto trail that extended from Portland, Maine, to Portland, Oregon. In New York, it connected North Tonawanda (near Niagara Falls) in the west to Plattsburgh in the east via Rochester and Watertown. NY3 began at what is now the intersection of US62 and NY425 and followed modern NY425 north through Cambria Station to Cambria Center, from where the highway continued to Lockport on Lower Mountain, Gothic Hill, and Upper Mountain Roads and modern NY31. It remained on current NY31 through the city and mostly followed that route's modern alignment across western New York to the city of Rochester. The most significant exception to this was between Lockport and Gasport, where NY3 veered south by way of modern NY77 and County Route10 (CR10) to serve the hamlet of McNalls.|$|E

5|$|The three-story {{brick house}} {{includes}} a full elevated basement and a mansard roof with steeply pitched gabled dormers. Projecting from the roofline are plain corbeled chimneys and iron gillwork, the original roofing material was slate. The 1879 {{version of the}} Ellwood House featured dormer ornamentation with finial work. The original windows were all double-hung and of modest size, occurring both singly and in pairs while showing a variety of lintel designs. The original front (east) facade appeared much different <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> at present. The front entryway has been completely altered, due to Perry Ellwood's 1911 remodeling. The original entryway featured a one-story stone porch supported with two pilasters and two granite columns. The square projecting porch bay {{was connected to the}} ground via 12 stone stairs. In the southeast corner of the house was a full three-story projecting tower set at a 45° angle {{to the rest of the}} front facade.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the striped}} hyena, {{for which a}} number of {{subspecies}} were proposed in light of its extensive modern range, the spotted hyena is a genuinely variable species, both temporally and spatially. Its range once encompassed almost all of Africa and Eurasia, and displayed a large degree of morphological geographic variation, which led to an equally extensive set of specific and subspecific epithets. It was gradually realised {{that all of this}} variation could be applied to individual differences in a single subspecies. In 1939, biologist L. Harrison Matthews demonstrated through comparisons between a large selection of spotted hyena skulls from Tanzania that all the variation seen in the then recognised subspecies could also be found in a single population, with the only set of characters standing out being pelage (which is subject to a high degree of individual variation) and size (which is subject to Bergmann's Rule). When fossils are taken into consideration, the species displayed even greater variation <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> in modern times, and a number of these named fossil species have since been classed as synonymous with Crocuta crocuta, with firm evidence of there being more than one species within the genus Crocuta still lacking.|$|E
5|$|Mutation bias {{effects are}} {{superimposed}} on other processes. If selection would favor either {{one out of}} two mutations, {{but there is no}} extra advantage to having both, then the mutation that occurs the most frequently is the one that is most likely to become fixed in a population. Mutations leading to the loss of function of a gene are much more common than mutations that produce a new, fully functional gene. Most loss of function mutations are selected against. But when selection is weak, mutation bias towards loss of function can affect evolution. For example, pigments are no longer useful when animals live in the darkness of caves, and tend to be lost. This kind of loss of function can occur because of mutation bias, and/or because the function had a cost, and once the benefit of the function disappeared, natural selection leads to the loss. Loss of sporulation ability in Bacillus subtilis during laboratory evolution appears to have been caused by mutation bias, rather than natural selection against the cost of maintaining sporulation ability. When there is no selection for loss of function, the speed at which loss evolves depends more on the mutation rate <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> on the effective population size, indicating that it is driven more by mutation bias than by genetic drift. In parasitic organisms, mutation bias leads to selection pressures as seen in Ehrlichia. Mutations are biased towards antigenic variants in outer-membrane proteins.|$|E
