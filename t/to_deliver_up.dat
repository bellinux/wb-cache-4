With Sigismund defeated and exiled, as both an alien and a heretic to the majority of the Swedish nation, and his formal deposition by the Riksdag of the Estates in 1599 was, in effect, a natural vindication and ex post facto legitimization of Charles's position all along, for the same session of the Riksens ständer named him as the ruler as regent.|$|E

500|$|Initially {{only the}} Public Ledger {{reported}} on the case, but once it became known that noblemen had taken an interest and visited the ghost at Mr Bray's house on 14January, the story {{began to appear in}} other newspapers. [...] The St. James's Chronicle and the London Chronicle printed reports from 16–19 January (the latter the more sceptical of the two), and Lloyd's Evening Post from 18–20 January. [...] The story spread across London and by the middle of January the crowds gathered outside the property were such that Cock Lane was rendered impassable. [...] Parsons charged visitors an entrance fee to [...] "talk" [...] with the ghost, which, it was reported, did not disappoint. [...] After receiving several requests to intercede, Samuel Fludyer, Lord Mayor of London, was on 23January approached by Alderman Gosling, John Moore and Parsons. [...] They told him of their experiences but Fludyer was reminded of the then recent case of fraudster Elizabeth Canning and refused to have Kent or Parsons arrested (on charges of murder and conspiracy respectively). [...] Instead, against a backdrop of hysteria caused in part by the newspapers' relentless reporting of the case, he ordered that Elizabeth be tested at Aldrich's house. [...] Meanwhile, Elizabeth was again the subject of study, in two séances held 23–24January. [...] Parsons accepted the Lord Mayor's decision, but asked that [...] "some persons connected with the girl might be permitted to be there, to divert her in the day-time". [...] This was refused, as were two similar requests, Aldrich and Penn insisting that they would accept only [...] "any person or persons, of strict character and reputation, who are housekeepers". [...] Aldrich and Penn's account of their negotiations with Parsons clearly perturbed the clerk, as he defended his actions in the Public Ledger. [...] This prompted Aldrich and Penn to issue a pointed retort in Lloyd's Evening Post: [...] "We are greatly puzzled to find Mr. Parsons asserting that he hath been always willing <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> <b>up</b> the child, when he refused a gentleman on Wednesday evening the 20th inst.

2500|$|In Sykes v Walls , a {{claim of}} {{wrongful}} detention by a bailee was upheld as a good claim {{on the ground that}} a refusal <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> <b>up</b> constituted a [...] "misfeasance". [...] By this case, trover became virtually concurrent with detinue. [...] When a chattel had been found, and there was a subsequent refusal to deliver it to the owner, it was taken as evidence that a conversion had occurred. Trover was a wrong against the right of possession and not against the possession itself, because possession was prima facie in the wrong-doer. Even when trover was allowed to overlap trespass and replevin, which were concerned with possession, it remained necessary to define conversion, and this extension did not really affect the definition. Conversion became any act {{on the part of the}} defendant inconsistent with the plaintiff's right to possession. [...] This right had parts: [...] it had to be (1) absolute and (2) immediate.|$|E

For suppressing the book Stevenson was imprisoned in Castle Rushen by Horne, who required Wilson <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> <b>up</b> the volume as a condition of Stevenson's release.

2500|$|The current Extradition Treaty {{between the}} United States of America and the United Mexican States (see 31 U.S.T. 5061) {{was signed by}} President Jimmy Carter in 1978 and {{went into effect in}} 1980. [...] Like many such treaties, it {{provides}} for the extradition of a party who has been charged with or found guilty of an offense committed in the United States, who has fled to Mexico. An offense is extraditable if it is a crime in both countries and punishable by incarceration for a period of one year or more. [...] In theory this allows for the extradition of child abductors who have absconded to Mexico as child abduction is a federal crime there. [...] In practice US authorities rarely request extradition in preference of Hague Convention litigation and, even when they do, Mexico is not bound <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> <b>up</b> its nationals. [...] If extradition is denied based on nationality, the request for extradition is automatically converted into a foreign prosecution pursuant to Article IV of the Mexican Federal Penal Code. [...] Although by law Mexican authorities are authorized to extradite their own nationals in “exceptional circumstances”, [...] in practice they most often will refuse to do so. [...] (See “Ley De Extradicion Internacional”, enacted May 19, 1897, revised [...] January 10, 1994: “extradition of Mexican nationals is prohibited except in “exceptional” circumstances”.) [...] “Nationality” is also liberally construed and often, marriage to a national, having dual citizenship, parents or other close relatives who are Mexican nationals, or simply having a Hispanic surname will suffice for purposes of extradition.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} of the Civil War, this clause was one of the {{provisions}} upon which the Court relied in holding that the Confederation formed by the seceding States (the States that withdrew from membership in a federal union) could not be recognized as having any legal existence. Today, its practical significance lies in the limitations which it implies upon the power of the States to deal with matters having a bearing upon international relations. In the early case of Holmes v. Jennison, Chief Justice Taney invoked it as a reason for holding that a State had no power <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> <b>up</b> a fugitive from justice to a foreign State. More recently, the kindred idea that the responsibility for the conduct of foreign relations rests exclusively with the Federal Government prompted the Court to hold that, since the oil under the three mile marginal belt along the California coast might well become the subject of international dispute and since the ocean, including this three mile belt, is of vital consequence to the nation in its desire to engage in commerce and to live in peace with the world, the Federal Government has paramount rights in and power over that belt, including full dominion over the resources of the soil under the water area. In Skiriotes v. Florida, the Court, on the other hand, ruled that this clause did not disable Florida from regulating the manner in which its own citizens may engage in sponge fishing outside its territorial waters. Speaking for a unanimous Court, Chief Justice Hughes declared: “When its action does not conflict with federal legislation, the sovereign authority of the State over the conduct of its citizens upon the high seas is analogous to the sovereign authority of the United States over its citizens in like circumstances.” ...|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash {{interpreted}} the Israelites' encounter with Sihon in [...] and [...] Noting {{the report of}} [...] that [...] "Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying: ‘Let me pass through your land,'" [...] the Midrash taught that the Israelites sent messengers to Sihon {{just as they had}} to Edom to inform the Edomites that the Israelites would not cause Edom any damage. Noting the report of [...] that the Israelites offered Sihon, [...] "You shall sell me food for money [...] [...] [...] and give me water for money," [...] the Midrash noted that water is generally given away for free, but the Israelites offered to pay for it. The Midrash noted that in [...] the Israelites offered, [...] "We will go by the king's highway," [...] but in [...] the Israelites admitted that they would go [...] "until [...] shall pass over the Jordan," [...] thus admitting {{that they were going to}} conquer Canaan. The Midrash compared the matter to a watchman who received wages to watch a vineyard, and to whom a visitor came and asked the watchman to go away so that the visitor could cut off the grapes from the vineyard. The watchman replied that the sole reason that the watchman stood guard was because of the visitor. The Midrash explained that the same was true of Sihon, as all the kings of Canaan paid Sihon money from their taxes, since Sihon appointed them as kings. The Midrash interpreted [...] which says, [...] "Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan," [...] to teach that Sihon and Og were the equal of all the other kings of Canaan. So the Israelites asked Sihon to let them pass through Sihon's land to conquer the kings of Canaan, and Sihon replied that the sole reason that he was there was to protect the kings of Canaan from the Israelites. Interpreting the words of [...] "and Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border; but Sihon gathered all his people together," [...] the Midrash taught that God brought this about designedly so as to deliver Sihon into the Israelites' hands without trouble. The Midrash {{interpreted the}} words of [...] "Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon," [...] to say that if Heshbon had been full of mosquitoes, no person could have conquered it, and if Sihon had been living in a plain, no person could have prevailed over him. The Midrash taught that Sihon thus would have been invincible, as he was powerful and dwelt in a fortified city. Interpreting the words, [...] "Who dwelt at Heshbon," [...] the Midrash taught that had Sihon and his armies remained in different towns, the Israelites would have worn themselves out conquering them all. But God assembled them in one place to deliver them into the Israelites' hands without trouble. In the same vein, in [...] God said, [...] "Behold, I have begun <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> <b>up</b> Sihon [...] [...] [...] before you," [...] and [...] says, [...] "Sihon gathered all his people together," [...] and [...] reports, [...] "And Israel took all these cities." ...|$|E
