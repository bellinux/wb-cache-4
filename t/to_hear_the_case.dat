5|$|The BIA {{appealed to}} the Supreme Court of the United States, which granted certiorari <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in order to settle a circuit split.|$|E
5|$|During the trial, {{attempts}} {{to suppress the}} statements given by J. D. B. {{because he was not}} given a Miranda warning were denied on the grounds that J. D. B. was not in police custody. The case was appealed and the Supreme Court agreed <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> J. D. B. v. North Carolina.|$|E
50|$|In August 2010 he was {{appointed}} <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> in <b>the</b> Deepwater Horizon oil spill. It is expected that at least 300 cases will be consolidated in his court.|$|R
2500|$|The Supreme Court of the United States, {{over the}} Government's objections, agreed in November 2003 <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> of <b>the</b> Guantánamo detainees, namely Rasul v. Bush, which was {{consolidated}} with al Odah v. Bush (the latter represented twelve Kuwaiti men).|$|R
5000|$|Epps {{personally}} {{received at}} least the $1.47 million in bribes for steering what Assistant US Attorney LaMarca estimated to be $800 million in contracts between 2006 and 2014. Judge Wingate was <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> of others who were charged with bribing Epps.|$|R
5|$|National Security Advisor John Poindexter {{was convicted}} of five counts of conspiracy, {{obstruction}} of justice, perjury, defrauding the government, and the alteration and destruction of evidence. A panel of the D.C. Circuit overturned the convictions on November 15, 1991 {{by a vote of}} 2 to 1 and the Supreme Court refused <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E
5|$|On November 7, 2005, the Supreme Court {{issued a}} writ of certiorari <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> The {{petition}} was filed {{on behalf of}} Hamdan by Neal Katyal of Georgetown University Law Center and Lt. Commander Charles Swift of the U.S. Navy, an alumnus of Seattle University School of Law. The Seattle law firm Perkins Coie provided the additional legal counsel for Hamdan.|$|E
5|$|Another {{question}} in the case was whether the High Court, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, had jurisdiction <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> Hill argued {{that because of the}} structure of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, the court could not hear the case. She argued that elections could not be disputed by petition if the dispute was about the eligibility of a candidate, as another provision of the Act meant that it would require a resolution of the relevant house of Parliament, the Senate in this case.|$|E
50|$|The {{scheme was}} {{initiated}} in July 2006 and Senior Counsel Tan Chee Meng {{became the first}} Specialist Judge to be appointed under this scheme <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> Fusionpolis <b>case.</b> Tan Cheng Han, dean of NUS law school, was the second Specialist Judge to be appointed <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> Informatics <b>Case.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In early December, {{a member}} of the Consultative Assembly, Kamal Subhi, {{submitted}} a report to the Assembly saying that lifting the ban would cause prostitution, pornography, homosexuality and divorce and the [...] "end of virginity". The head of the Assembly told women campaigners that he was [...] "still open <b>to</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for lifting <b>the</b> ban".|$|R
50|$|He was {{appointed}} to the Supreme Court of Canada on January 1, 1974. de Grandpré was the subject of controversy that year when objections were raised <b>to</b> him <b>hearing</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> Morgentaler v. <b>The</b> Queen given his prior personal statements about the issue at a 1973 national meeting of the Canadian Bar Association. In the end, the Chief Justice decided that Mr. Justice de Grandpré could remain on <b>the</b> panel <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> abortion <b>case.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 2013 the Virginia Supreme Court {{held that}} the city's attempt {{to take over the}} {{business}} properties was illegal. However, the U.S. District Court ruled in favor the city regarding the sign removal. In January 2015, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's ruling. In April 2015, the Institute for Justice asked the U.S. Supreme Court <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> as a First Amendment free speech issue.|$|E
5|$|Judges Stephen Reinhardt, Raymond C. Fisher and Richard R. Clifton (nominated to {{the court}} by presidents Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush respectively) were empaneled <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> After oral {{arguments}} in May 2007, they announced their decision ten months later, in March 2008. Unanimously, they reversed Moskowitz and ruled that the KD II was not a fishing vessel, therefore the fins had not been lawfully seized.|$|E
5|$|On January 19, 2010, the Supreme Court {{ordered the}} appeals court to reconsider its {{decision}} to rescind the death penalty, with the same three-judge panel convening in Philadelphia on November 9, 2010, to hear oral argument. On April 26, 2011, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals reaffirmed its prior decision to vacate the death sentence {{on the grounds that}} the jury instructions and verdict form were ambiguous and confusing. The Supreme Court declined <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in October.|$|E
5000|$|The Canadian Labor Defence League sent Cunningham {{along with}} Soloman Greenberg and W. H.

50|$|Following court {{proceedings}} in the High Court on the 2nd March 2007, Paul Knapman was appointed Coroner. He appointed Lady Butler-Sloss, a retired Court of Appeal Judge <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> inquests as his Assistant Deputy Coroner. She resigned on the 24th April 2007. On the 7th June 2007 Knapman appointed Lord Justice Scott Baker as his Assistant Deputy Coroner <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases.</b> He then held inquests into both Diana, Princess of Wales and Dodi Al-Fayed which {{began on the}} 2nd October 2007.|$|R
5|$|On January 6, 2009, Coleman's {{campaign}} {{filed an}} election contest, {{which led to}} a trial before a three-judge panel. The trial ended on April 7, when the panel ruled that 351 of 387 disputed absentee ballots were incorrectly rejected and ordered them counted. Counting those ballots raised Franken's lead to 312 votes. Coleman appealed to the Minnesota Supreme Court on April 20. On April 24, the Minnesota Supreme Court agreed <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> Oral arguments were conducted on June 1.|$|E
5|$|Compromise {{having been}} exhausted, both sides agreed to litigate the matter. The Kentucky Court of Appeals {{found that the}} General Assembly had acted legally in declaring Goebel {{the winner of the}} election. That {{decision}} was appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States. Arguments were presented in the case (Taylor v. Beckham) on April 30, 1900, and on May 21, the justices decided 8–1 not <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> allowing the Court of Appeals' decision to stand. The lone dissension was that of Associate Justice John Marshall Harlan, a Kentucky native. and member of the Republican Party.|$|E
5|$|In June 2001, the Brussels Correctional Court {{declared}} itself incompetent <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> as it {{related to}} political misconduct. In February 2003, the Brussels Appellate Court followed {{and gave a}} similar judgement. The original plaintiffs then appealed, and the case {{was sent to the}} Court of Appeals in Ghent, which upheld the complaint; the Vlaams Blok non-profit organisations were fined, and it was deemed that the Vlaams Blok was an organisation that sanctioned discrimination. The Vlaams Blok lodged an appeal which was rejected, and in November 2004, the ruling was made definite, when it was upheld by the Court of Cassation. The ruling meant that the party would lose access to state funding and access to television, effectively shutting the party down.|$|E
50|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 107 (3) of the Constitution and section 7 of the Supreme Court Act, the Supreme Court could try certain cases. Exceptionally this power is limited <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> relating <b>to</b> contempt of the Supreme Court and its subordinate courts. Article 102(3) and s.7(1) of the Supreme Court Act 1991 has {{provided that the}} authority to penalize wrongdoers with an amount of up to NRs. 10,000 or imprisonment of maximum {{period of one year}} or both if the court finds an accused is in contempt.|$|R
50|$|On 4 March, Sharjeel and Latif {{responded to}} the charges laid against them, with both {{accepting}} {{at least one of}} the minor charges but denying major allegations. In the aftermath of this, the PCB formed a three-man tribunal of retired Justice Asghar Haider, former PCB chairman Tauqir Zia, and former cricketer Wasim Bari <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> of <b>the</b> two players. On 17 March, Sharjeel appeared before <b>the</b> tribunal <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> charges, whereas Latif forced the postponement of his hearing citing health issues. Sharjeel was given up to 5 May to respond to the accusations, with <b>the</b> formal <b>hearing</b> scheduled for 15 May. Latif was set a deadline of 31 March to appear before the tribunal.|$|R
5|$|Discussed in ArticleVIII, the {{judiciary}} {{was separated from}} the two other branches of the government, and was to be served by elective judges. Courts of first instance existed in each voivodeship and were in constant session, with judges elected by the regional sejmik assemblies. Appellate tribunals were established for the provinces, based on the reformed Crown Tribunal and Lithuanian Tribunal. The Sejm elected from its deputies the judges for the Sejm court, a precursor to the modern State Tribunal of Poland. Referendary courts were established in each province <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> of <b>the</b> peasantry. Municipal courts, described in the law on towns, complemented this system.|$|R
5|$|On March 10, 1900, {{the circuit}} court of Jefferson County upheld the General Assembly's actions that {{certified}} Goebel as governor. The case was appealed to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, then the court of last resort in Kentucky. On April 6, 1900, the Court of Appeals ruled 6—1 that Taylor had been legally unseated. Taylor appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, and on May 21, 1900, the Court refused <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> Only Kentuckian John Marshall Harlan dissented from this refusal. With Taylor's legal options exhausted, Goebel's lieutenant governor, J. C. W. Beckham, ascended to the governorship. During his short term as governor, Taylor had done little beyond making a few appointments and issuing a few pardons.|$|E
5|$|Tera McArthur asked {{two police}} {{officers}} to accompany her to a trailer home where she lived with her husband Charles, {{so that she could}} take her belongings out of the home. Just after she came out of the trailer, she told the police that Charles McArthur had drugs inside. The police knocked and asked Charles if they could search, which he refused. He then came out of the trailer; an officer prevented him from going back inside while the other policeman rushed to get a warrant. The Illinois Appellate Court held that this action violated the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures without a warrant. The Supreme Court granted certiorari <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The Fifth Circuit {{held that}} this {{interpretation}} of Section 7 was impermissible {{and refused to}} enforce the NLRB order. The Fifth Circuit followed {{the lead of the}} Seventh and Fourth circuits which had refused to enforce the NLRB's previous decisions in Mobil Oil Corp. and Quality Mfg. Co. respectively. The Fifth Circuit argued that no union presence was necessary in Collins' questioning because the company was not attempting to bargain with her in any way. Additionally, the court argued that requiring a union representative any time the threat of discipline was present would extend the scope of the NLRA far too broadly. The NLRB appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, which granted certiorari <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E
2500|$|All five <b>cases</b> share <b>the</b> {{same basic}} {{procedural}} history. After the Furman decision, {{the states of}} Georgia, Florida, Texas, North Carolina, and Louisiana amended their death penalty statutes to meet the Furman guidelines. Subsequently, the five named defendants were convicted of murder {{and sentenced to death}} in their respective states. The respective state supreme court upheld the death sentence. The defendants then asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review their death sentence, asking the Court to go beyond Furman and declare once and for all the death penalty to be [...] "cruel and unusual punishment" [...] and thus in violation of the Constitution; <b>the</b> Court agreed <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota sued {{in federal}} court to {{overturn}} those regulations. The district courts agreed with them, but upon appeal, the Eighth Circuit consolidated the two cases into one and reversed the judgments, remanding the cases for entry of judgments {{in favor of the}} United States. This decision was at odds with decisions from the Second, Sixth, Seventh, and Eleventh Circuits, which had all previously ruled that residents may count as students for the purpose of FICA taxes. The Eighth Circuit's ruling created a circuit split, and on appeal, the Supreme Court agreed <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{environmental}} groups that had filed the injunction appealed the decision, and on October 6, 1972, the U.S. District Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C. partially reversed Hart's decision. The appeals {{court said that}} although the impact statement followed the guidelines set by the National Environmental Policy Act, it did not follow the Minerals Leasing Act, which allowed for a smaller pipeline right of way than was required for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. The oil companies and Alyeska appealed this decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, but in April 1973, the court declined <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gov. Schwarzenegger again {{appealed to}} the Supreme Court, looking to {{overturn}} the Ninth Circuit's ruling, filing a writ of certiorari to the Court in May 2009. The Supreme Court agreed <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> at this point filed as Schwarzenegger v. Entertainment Merchants Ass'n. The fact that the Court accepted this case was considered surprising, based on the previous case record for such violent video game laws that were unanimously overturned in other states. Analysts believe that because the Court agreed to hear this case, there are unanswered questions between the protection of free speech from the First Amendment, and the legal enforcement of protecting minors from unprotected free speech such as through restrictions on the sales of pornography to minors. Just a week prior to {{the acceptance of the}} certiorari, in United States v. Stevens the Court overturned another law that sought restrictions on depictions of animal cruelty, which some analysts felt would reflect the Court's position to likely overturn the violent video game law.|$|E
5000|$|John appealed both convictions. In May, 1997, the Mississippi Supreme Court {{determined}} that the Indian title to the land was extinguished under the removal treaties. Under the treaties, the Mississippi Constitution, and Mississippi statutes, Choctaws that remained in the state after removal became citizens of Mississippi and subject to state law. Because of this, the reservation land in Mississippi is not Indian country. Following this ruling, the Fifth Circuit Court came to the same conclusion, and reversed the federal conviction {{on the grounds that}} the district court lacked jurisdiction. [...] The United States then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which granted certiorari <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In May 2002, the Supreme Court of Illinois agreed <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> civil <b>case</b> of Illinois Department of Professional Regulation vs. Yvonne Cryns, {{over whether}} the DPR {{has the right to}} {{regulate}} unlicensed professions.
