5|$|Although Suzuki might {{indeed have}} seen peace as a distant goal, {{he had no}} design <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> <b>it</b> within any {{immediate}} time span or on terms acceptable to the Allies.

5|$|On 5 April, after a {{long night}} of battle, French fighter-bombers and {{artillery}} inflicted particularly devastating losses on one Viet Minh regiment, which was caught on open ground.

5|$|In 2004, the {{possibility}} arose of his father's record of 257hits {{in a season}} being surpassed by Ichiro Suzuki of the Seattle Mariners. Living in Dallas, Texas at the time, Sisler and his son Dave followed Ichiro's progress throughout the season. Both had mixed feelings about the record chase; they were happy that George Sisler's name was being talked about and that people were re-discovering him as a player, but both were hoping that, if the record was not broken in 154games, {{there would be an}} asterisk noting that it took Ichiro more games <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> <b>it.</b> Ichiro finished the season with 262hits, and the Mariners extended an invitation for the entire Sisler family to attend the celebration at Safeco Field. The younger Sisler was prevented by an emergency heart procedure from travelling to Seattle. Both remarked that the Mariners were a classy organization for extending the invitation.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Jaime {{talks with}} Edmure Tully, {{trying to win}} his {{cooperation}} by tempting him with seeing his newborn son, whom he has never seen, and offering to send {{him and his family}} to Casterly Rock, away from the Freys. Edmure ridicules Jaime and all of his past misdeeds, and asks him how he can live with himself. Jaime responds how he wants to take Riverrun to be back with Cersei, and he is willing to do anything <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> <b>it,</b> even if it means killing every Tully he finds, including Edmure and his son. Jaime then sends Edmure to parley with the Blackfish. Despite the Blackfish's protests, the Tully soldiers allow Edmure entry into the castle. Edmure then orders his men to surrender Riverrun, and also orders the Blackfish's capture. The Blackfish helps Brienne and Podrick escape, but stays behind to fight to the end.|$|E
5|$|San Martín {{resigned}} from the Spanish army, for controversial reasons, and moved to South America, where he joined the Spanish American wars of independence. Historians propose several explanations for this action: the common ones are that he missed his native country, {{that he was a}} British agent and the congruence of the goals of both wars. The first explanation suggests that when the wars of independence began San Martín thought that his duty was to return to his country and serve in the military conflict. The second explanation suggests that Britain, which would benefit from the independence of the South American countries, sent San Martín <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> <b>it.</b> The third suggests that both wars were caused by the conflicts between Enlightenment ideas and absolutism, so San Martín still waged the same war; the wars in the Americas only developed separatist goals after the Spanish Absolutist Restoration.|$|E

5|$|The {{vertical}} triple expansion engines consumed {{large amounts}} of internal space that could otherwise {{have been used for}} magazines. Without sufficient magazine capacity to support superfiring centerline turrets, designers were compelled to distribute six main turrets in an unusual hexagonal configuration. Two twin turrets were mounted fore and aft (one on each end), and two were mounted on each flank of the ship. Firing directly forward and aft, the ships could bring 6 guns to bear, and 8 on the broadside; this was the same theoretical capability as Dreadnought, but the Nassau-class ships required two additional guns <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> <b>it.</b> It was considered that this arrangement provided a useful reserve of heavy guns that were shielded from enemy fire.|$|E
5|$|Themes from Plato and his {{influence}} on Western political philosophy are also {{prevalent in the}} novel. Mainly, {{the debate over the}} nature of 'Good Society' and how <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> <b>it</b> are seen in the positions of the Supreme. He argues that it is the ruler's role, as well as his duty and obligation, to bring about the good society, and this can only be done by the imposition of absolute order from above. The dictator’s job is to bring about the Good Society, to impose the needed order, and the people's job is to obey the dictator, thereby enjoying the fruits of the good society. The result of such behavior by both the ruler and the ruled will be good for everyone.|$|E
