5|$|The {{basic model}} can be {{extended}} to incorporate a supra-game played by <b>the</b> <b>governments</b> of the respective countries. In this case, each government chooses the level of subsidy it will provide to its firm, taking the other government's action as given, and anticipating {{the reaction of the}} firms (in terms of quantity produced) to the subsidy. Brander and Spencer show that in the resulting Nash equilibrium <b>the</b> <b>governments</b> choose a level of subsidy that is too high and hence they do not manage to maximize social welfare. In fact, if the good produced is not consumed domestically, then the optimal level of subsidy is negative – an export tax., where m is a competitively produced numéraire good This is because the total quantity produced in the Cournot and the Stackelberg equilibrium is higher than the profit maximizing collusive monopoly level of output. Since both the home and foreign firm are producing for a third market, an export tax could reduce the total quantity produced down to the monopoly level, thus increasing both firms' profits. In that way <b>the</b> <b>governments</b> can effect a collusive outcome between their firms, at the expanse of the third country which imports the good.|$|E

40|$|By {{introducing}} <b>the</b> <b>government's</b> {{preference for}} tax revenues into unionized mixed duopolies, this paper investigates how the preference can change <b>the</b> <b>government's</b> choice of tax regimes between ad valorem and specific taxes. Main results are as follows. Given {{that one of}} the tax regimes is predetermined, privatization never improves welfare and privatization is preferable for <b>the</b> <b>government</b> when it emphasizes its tax revenue. However, when the tax regime is endogenously determined by <b>the</b> <b>government,</b> privatization is preferable from the viewpoint of social welfare if <b>the</b> <b>government</b> heavily emphasizes its tax revenue. Thus, there are conflicts of interest between the public firm and the government: If it heavily emphasizes its tax revenue, then <b>the</b> <b>government</b> always has <b>the</b> incentive to levy specific tax, while the public firm has the incentive to be levied by ad valorem. However, there are no conflicts of interest between the public firm and <b>the</b> <b>government</b> when <b>the</b> <b>government</b> levies <b>the</b> specific tax if <b>the</b> <b>government</b> less emphasizes its tax revenue. Interestingly, <b>the</b> <b>government</b> never has <b>the</b> incentive for privatization if <b>the</b> <b>government</b> considers either tax as an option. ...|$|R
