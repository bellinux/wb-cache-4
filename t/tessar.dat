25|$|When {{he went to}} Mexico in 1924 he took an 8 × 10 Seneca folding-bed view {{camera with}} several lenses, {{including}} a Graf Variable and a Wollensak Verito. While in Mexico he purchased a used Rapid Rectilinear lens which he was his primary lens for many years. The lens, now in the George Eastman House, {{did not have a}} manufacturer's name. He also took to Mexico a 3¼ × 4¼ Graflex with a ƒ/4.5 <b>Tessar</b> lens, which he used for portraits.|$|E

Only the latter years saw the Industar degraded to a mass item with production shortcuts affecting coating, as incidentally also with the last 2.8/50 <b>Tessars</b> from the GDR.|$|R
50|$|With {{the advent}} of the Contax by Zeiss-Ikon, the first serious {{challenge}} to the Leica in the field of professional 35 mm cameras, both Zeiss-Ikon and Carl Zeiss decided to beat the Leica in every possible way. Bertele's Sonnar series of lenses designed for the Contax were the match in every respect for the Leica for at least two decades. Other lenses for the Contax included the Biotar, Biogon, Orthometar, and various <b>Tessars</b> and Triotars.|$|R
2500|$|Image {{sharpness}} {{is related}} to f/number through two different optical effects: aberration, due to imperfect lens design, [...] and diffraction {{which is due to}} the wave nature of light. The blur optimal f-stop varies with the lens design. For modern standard lenses having 6 or 7 elements, the sharpest image is often obtained around 5.6–8, while for older standard lenses having only 4 elements (<b>Tessar</b> formula) stopping to 11 will give the sharpest image. The larger number of elements in modern lenses allow the designer to compensate for aberrations, allowing the lens to give better pictures at lower f-numbers. Even if aberration is minimized by using the best lenses, diffraction creates some spreading of the rays causing defocus. To offset that use the largest lens opening diameter possible (not the f/ number itself).|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} Zenit {{came with}} the sturdy click-stop four-element 3.5/50mm Zeiss <b>Tessar</b> copy under the [...] "Industar" [...] designation. [...] Early aluminium variants made in several different bodies were finely blue-coated, whereas the later mass-produced black version was either partially or un-coated with no visible colour on the glass. They were sharp but gave the typically [...] "foggy" [...] image of an uncoated lens with bright lighting. [...] With the iris ring sitting inside the focussing ring {{it was impossible to}} focus at full aperture followed by stopping down, as this moved the point of focus. [...] What makes these lenses interesting is their very compact [...] "pancake" [...] design. The concept of the makers was to offer a sharp Tessar-type lens of the simplest possible body construction, leaving out all progress made in this field since 1945. [...] The most prominent lens is the 6-element 2.0/58mm [...] "Helios" [...] based on the pre-war Zeiss Biotar (US Patent 1,786,916 (W.Merté, 1930) Zenit also manufactures several Tair lenses in different focal lengths of which some were of 4-element pre-war Zeiss Sonnar design with the cemented second and ultra-fat third element.|$|E

50|$|Early <b>Tessar</b> designs by Paul Rudolph {{allowed a}} maximum {{aperture}} of f/6.3. Later development allowed an aperture of f/4.5 by 1917. In 1930, Ernst Wanderslab and Willy Merté of Zeiss developed <b>Tessar</b> lenses with apertures of f/3.5 and f/2.8.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Tessar</b> is {{a famous}} {{photographic}} lens design conceived by the German physicist Paul Rudolph in 1902 {{while he worked}} at the Zeiss optical company and patented by Zeiss in Germany; the lens type is usually known as the Zeiss <b>Tessar.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Other <b>Tessar</b> lenses, {{for example}} for Nokia mobile phones, have only the name [...] "Tessar" [...] {{in common with}} the {{original}} <b>Tessar.</b> They are for example a 5-elements-in-1-group, aperture-less all-aspherical lens, as in the Nokia 808 Pureview and Nokia Lumia 800 camera.|$|E
50|$|Paul Rudolph {{developed}} the <b>Tessar</b> from {{dissatisfaction with the}} performance of his earlier Protar, although it also resembles the Cooke triplet. The <b>Tessar</b> was originally an f/6.3 lens. It was refined to f/2.8 by 1930, although f/3.5 was the realistic limit for best image quality.|$|E
50|$|It {{is often}} {{incorrectly}} {{stated that the}} Leitz Elmar 50mm f/3.5 fixed to the Leica A (1925, Germany), Leitz's first camera, was a <b>Tessar.</b> However, {{at the time the}} Leica was introduced the 50mm f/3.5 Kino <b>Tessar</b> had only been designed to cover the cine format of 18x24mm, which was insufficient for the new 24x36mm format of the Leica, and Leitz had to develop a new lens to provide adequate full frame coverage. It was only when Zeiss Ikon were designing the Contax in response {{to the success of the}} Leica that a 50mm <b>Tessar</b> which could cover the 24x36mm format was designed. The Elmar was based on a modified Cooke Triplet with a different computation to the <b>Tessar</b> and with the stop in the first air space.|$|E
