40|$|Walter Benjamin and Rem Koolhaas {{developed}} {{two significant}} investigations, which explored {{the culture of}} Paris and New York through the analysis of their architectural artifacts. Their research projects successfully construct, from a few meaningful components of the built environment, {{an understanding of the}} overall city and its society. The objective {{of this paper is to}} address the similarities between the research carried out at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and the work of these <b>two</b> acclaimed <b>writers.</b> Our <b>group</b> aims to select urban icons, from different moments and areas in Rio de Janeiro, to be studied in order to understand the city evolution in the 20 th Century. The distinguished Ministry of Education building is the investigation's prototype, analyzed thorough several 3 D models and other digital techniques. We conclude that a thorough study of Benjamin's and Koolhaas'work should be considered a primary support for the interrogation of our own investigation...|$|R

40|$|Using a {{switching}} replications quasi-experimental design, {{this study}} investigated {{the effectiveness of the}} application Clicker Docs and tablet accessibility features as a 6 week alternating intervention tool for improving writing. Aspects of writing included writing quality, writing output, and attitudes of struggling <b>writers.</b> <b>Two</b> <b>groups</b> of 11 students from grades 2 - 7 who were identified with a disability or as a struggling writer, alternated participation in this intervention program. A mixed 2 x 2 repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with pre-test scores as covariate was used. Results showed a large significant effect on writing quality at Post-test 2. On average, those in the iPad intervention group demonstrated better writing quality than those in the control group. In addition, a medium significant effect was found for writing output. On average, those in the iPad intervention group wrote less overall than those in the control group. No effect was found for attitude towards writing. : assistive technology, tablet computer, iPad, struggling writers, learning disabilities, writing quality, writing output, writing attitude, intervention, switching replications desig...|$|R
