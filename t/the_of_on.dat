30|$|After {{performing}} the preprocessing techniques, the retinal structure extraction {{and also the}} exudates detection, feature extraction takes place {{in order to obtain}} the features from the given images. There are three features selected from the exudates output image and macula image, respectively. They are <b>the</b> area <b>of</b> <b>on</b> pixels, <b>the</b> mean <b>of</b> <b>on</b> pixels and <b>the</b> standard deviation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>on</b> pixels for the exudates region. In addition, there are another three features from the maculopathy region, i.e., <b>the</b> area <b>of</b> <b>on</b> pixels, <b>the</b> mean <b>of</b> <b>on</b> pixels and <b>the</b> standard deviation <b>of</b> <b>on</b> pixels for <b>the</b> maculopathy. The features between the exudates region and maculopathy region are compared. <b>The</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exudates area is higher compared to <b>the</b> area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> maculopathy value as the maculopathy is located around the macula, and <b>the</b> diameter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> macula is small.|$|R
