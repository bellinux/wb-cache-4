25|$|The {{decision}} making processes of tribunals {{can be quite}} heterogeneous. Though often having procedures <b>that</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> resemble those of a court of law, common law and legislative rules about court proceedings do not apply directly to tribunals. Tribunals often have their power granted to them {{by an act of}} parliament, and conventionally, in English constitutional law the judiciary cannot invalidate legislation, as the UK does not have an entrenched, written constitution. However the process of judicial reviews allow courts to challenge decisions made by tribunals. To a degree these set out some common law rules for how tribunals can make decisions.|$|E
25|$|An {{exchange}} of telegrams ensued between the War Office in London and Gordon in Bombay about just what exactly {{he was planning}} on doing in China, and when Gordon replied that he would find out when he got there, Gordon was ordered to stay. Gordon disobeyed orders and left on the first ship to China, an action <b>that</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> angered the Army's commander, the Duke of Cambridge. Gordon arrived in Shanghai in July and met Li Hongzhang, and learned that there was risk of war with Russia. After meeting his old friend, Gordon assured Li that if Russia should attack he would resign his commission in the British Army {{to take up a}} commission in the Chinese Army, an action that if taken risked prosecution under the Foreign Enlistments Act. Gordon informed the Foreign Office that he willing to renounce his British citizenship and take Chinese citizenship as he would not abandon Li and his other Chinese friends should a Sino-Russian war begin. Gordon's willingness to renounce his British citizenship in order to fight with China in the event of war did much to raise his prestige in China.|$|E

2500|$|The album {{opens with}} a cover of [...] "I'll Be Home for Christmas", a war song written by Kim Gannon, Walter Kent, and Buck Ram; William Ruhlmann from AllMusic {{considered}} the inclusion of this track on Christmas Memories to reflect Streisand's [...] "mature perspective <b>that</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> takes loss into consideration". [...] "A Christmas Love Song" [...] is the second track and was written by Alan and Marilyn Bergman and Johnny Mandel. Author Tom Santopietro described the song's message as [...] "an embrace of the holidays filled with honest sentiment". A [...] "jazzy" [...] rendition of Frank Loesser's [...] "What Are You Doing New Year's Eve?" [...] is the third song, followed by a reworked cover of [...] "I Remember" [...] by Stephen Sondheim. Streisand's cover of the latter song was described as [...] " [...] an extremely sad song" [...] by Ruhlmann. [...] "Snowbound" [...] was written by Russell Faith and Clarence Kehner, {{is set in a}} [...] "moderately slow" [...] tempo, and features the use of a piano. [...] "It Must Have Been the Mistletoe" [...] was considered by the staff at Show Music {{to be one of the}} many songs on the album to [...] "focus on love".|$|E
2500|$|Saxony was {{a center}} of völkisch {{activity}} in the late 19th century, and in the elections to the Saxon Landtag in 1893, völkisch candidates won 6 out of the 16 seats. Chamberlain's status as an immigrant to Germany always meant he was {{to a certain extent}} an outsider in his adopted country-a man who spoke fluent German, but always with an English accent. In a classic case of being plus royaliste que le roi (more royalist than the kings), Chamberlain tried very hard to be more German than the Germans, and it was his efforts to fit in that led him to völkisch politics. Likewise, his anti-Semitism allowed him to define himself as a German in opposition to a group that allegedly threatened all Germans, thereby allowing him to integrate better into the Wagnerian circles with whom he socialized most of the time. Chamberlain's friend Hermann Keyserling later recalled that Chamberlain was an eccentric English [...] "individualist" [...] who [...] "never saw Germany as it really is", instead having an idealized, almost mythic view of Germany and the Germans. This was especially the case as initially the German Wagnerites had rejected Chamberlain, telling him that only Germans could really understand Wagner, statements <b>that</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> hurt Chamberlain. To compensate, Chamberlain became über deutsche, the man who wanted to be more German than the Germans.|$|E
