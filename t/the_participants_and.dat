5|$|In {{another study}} that {{appeared}} in the British Journal of Psychology, researchers tested how respondents considered balance in artwork composition of differing qualities. Fifteen pairs of works from ArtCyclopedia by artists such as Paul Gauguin, Georgia O'Keeffe, and Georges-Pierre Seurat, and fifteen from MOBA by artists including Doug Caderette, Unknown, and D. Alix were shown to participants; in each, an item in the painting was shifted vertically or horizontally, and respondents were asked to identify the original. The researchers hypothesized that respondents would identify balance and composition more easily in the traditional masterworks, and that study participants would find a greater change of quality when items were shifted in traditional masterworks than they would in MOBA pieces. However, the study concluded that balance alone did not define art of higher quality for <b>the</b> <b>participants,</b> <b>and</b> that respondents were more likely to see that original art was more balanced than the altered version, not necessarily that the traditional art was significantly better composed and balanced than MOBA works.|$|E
5|$|On Saturday, February 7, Murray's father Fred {{arrived in}} Amherst. He told {{investigators}} he and Maura went car-shopping that afternoon and later went {{to dinner with}} a friend of Murray's. Murray dropped her father off at his motel room and, borrowing his Toyota Corolla, she returned to campus to attend a dorm party. She arrived at 10:30 pm. At 2:30 am on Sunday, February 8, she left the party. At 3:30 am, en route to her father's motel, she struck a guardrail on Route 9 in Hadley causing nearly $10,000 worth of damage to her father's car. The responding officer wrote an accident report but there is no documentation of sobriety field tests being conducted. She was driven to her father's motel and stayed in his room the rest of the morning. At 4:49 am, there was a cell phone call placed to Murray's boyfriend from Fred's phone. <b>The</b> <b>participants</b> <b>and</b> content of the phone call are unknown.|$|E

5|$|The {{events of}} the early morning of June 28, 1969 were not the first {{instances}} of homosexuals fighting back against police in New York City and elsewhere. Not only had the Mattachine Society been active in major cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago, but similarly marginalized people started the riot at Compton's Cafeteria in 1966, and another riot responded to a raid on Los Angeles' Black Cat Tavern in 1967. However, several circumstances were in place that made the Stonewall riots memorable. The location of the raid was a factor: it was {{across the street from}} The Village Voice offices, and the narrow crooked streets gave the rioters advantage over the police. Many of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>and</b> residents of Greenwich Village were involved in political organizations that were effectively able to mobilize a large and cohesive gay community {{in the weeks and months}} after the rebellion. The most significant facet of the Stonewall riots, however, was the commemoration of them in Christopher Street Liberation Day, which grew into the annual Gay Pride events around the world.|$|E

40|$|Descriptive and {{experimental}} analyses {{suggested that the}} self-injurious behavior (SIB) of a 10 -year-old girl with severe mental retardation was maintained by attention. Additional analyses identified physical contact as the type of attention maintaining SIB; therefore, we hypothesized that physical proximity of an adult was a discriminative stimulus for SIB. Based on these findings, we systematically varied the distance between <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>and</b> a therapist to assess stimulus generalization. Results showed that rates of SIB varied relative to the distance between <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>and</b> therapist; <b>the</b> highest percentage of SIB occurred with the therapist positioned less than 0. 5 m from <b>the</b> <b>participant.</b> Treatment consisted of placing the therapist at a specified distance (9. 0 m) from <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> (during low-attention situations), noncontingent reinforcement, and extinction...|$|R

She referred to this as [...] "ritual without myth". [...] For Clark, art work would have no representative meaning outside of its manipulation by <b>the</b> <b>participants.</b> <b>Participants</b> would take <b>the</b> art objects and fashion {{them in any way}} that they pleased. At this point, the line between <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>and</b> art work would become blurred. <b>The</b> <b>participants</b> would become one with the art piece. In a sense, <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>and</b> art work would become fused. In the final years of her career, Clark focused solely on psychotherapy and the use of art in healing patients. Clark's objective through her art was to surpass each phase since ideas that were originally considered groundbreaking were outdated with regard to her latter works.|$|R

25|$|Ecological {{facilitation}} or probiosis describes species {{interactions that}} benefit {{at least one}} of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>and</b> cause harm to neither. Facilitations can be categorized as mutualisms, in which both species benefit, or commensalisms, in which one species benefits and the other is unaffected. Much of classic ecological theory (e.g., natural selection, niche separation, metapopulation dynamics) has focused on negative interactions such as predation and competition, but positive interactions (facilitation) are receiving increasing focus in ecological research. This article addresses both the mechanisms of facilitation and the increasing information available concerning the impacts of facilitation on community ecology.|$|E
