5|$|The report {{published}} by the Tower Commission was delivered to the president on February 26, 1987. The Commission had interviewed 80 witnesses to the scheme, including Reagan, {{and two of the}} arms trade middlemen: Manucher Ghorbanifar and Adnan Khashoggi. The 200-page report was the most comprehensive of any released, criticizing the actions of Oliver North, John Poindexter, Caspar Weinberger, and others. It determined that President Reagan did not have knowledge of the extent of the program, especially about the diversion of funds to the Contras, although it argued that the president ought to have had better control of the National Security Council staff. The report heavily criticized Reagan for not properly supervising his subordinates or being aware of their actions. A major result of the Tower Commission was the consensus that Reagan should have listened to his National Security Advisor more, thereby placing more {{power in the hands of}} <b>that</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|E

It does however catch the attention of Homer, who picks it up and reads it while sitting in a wing chair owned by Archie Bunker, a character from All in the Family.

500|$|To {{adjust to}} {{potential}} audio feedback and leakage and obtain a usable take, Chavarria tried having Badu sit in an overstuffed chair six feet behind the mixing console and use alternate microphones {{such as a}} Neumann M 269 or AEA R44 ribbon microphone with Sony MDR-V900 headphones into a Furman headphone mixer. However, Badu felt she could not perceive all of her voice's frequencies with the headphones and often discarded them to move towards the studio monitors. He also considered situating her in an equilateral triangle with the two speakers, one {{of which would be}} placed out of phase in order to have the leakage cancel itself. However, according to him, the mic has to be stationary, while Badu [...] "likes to hold the mic like an MC. She is at home as a live performer." [...] He said of working around audio spills and adapting to Badu's methods, [...] "We worked to make her vocals fit into the track, phase-wise ... What did work was to keep the monitors fairly low and turn the microphone out of phase, and we would move her around the room until she found a spot where the leakage was reasonable and where she felt comfortable and could hear herself. But just as often she would just sit in <b>that</b> <b>chair</b> behind the board in the A Room." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2011, DC {{announced}} that Barbara Gordon would {{be returning to}} the role of Batgirl in September 2011, in her own eponymous monthly comic, as part of a company-wide relaunch of all of their titles. In addition, former Birds of Prey writer Gail Simone would be writing the series. This announcement {{became one of the most}} controversial aspects of the DC Comics relaunch. Supporters of Barbara Gordon in her persona as Oracle expressed dismay over losing an iconic character for the disabled community. Journalist and blogger Jill Pantozzi, who is diagnosed with muscular dystrophy, stated that [...] "people being disabled is part of the real world, it is essential it be part of the fictional world as well... Writer Kevin Van Hook did a great job showing what disabled individuals have to go through in the mini-series Oracle: The Cure. It’s that type of honesty I expect more of... While some diverse characters were mishandled over the years, Oracle was always treated with the utmost respect but this move is the most disrespectful I’ve seen in a long time." [...] Gail Simone responded directly by stating that at times when others had attempted to restore Gordon's mobility, she fought to keep her as a disabled character, even in light of requests from readers who also had disabilities that wished to see the character healed. However, part of her reasoning for reversing her decision and writing Batgirl with Gordon as the title character was that [...] "rms and legs get ripped off, and they grow back, somehow. Graves don't stay filled. But the one constant is that Barbara stays in <b>that</b> <b>chair.</b> Role model or not, that is problematic and uncomfortable, and the excuses to not cure her, in a world of purple rays and magic and super-science, are often unconvincing or wholly meta-textual. And the longer it goes on, the more it has stretched credibility. But now, everything has changed. If nearly everyone in the DCU, not just Batgirl but almost everyone, is now at a much earlier stage in their career, then my main objection no longer applies, because we are seeing Barbara at an earlier starting point." ...|$|E

Overall there were seven women and two men, one of whom was elected as chair. Meanwhile, at least one White influential Bahá'í was uncomfortable with integrated meetings - Emogene Hoagg - and there were reports the FBI was specifically checking on Bahá'ís in Greenville who had more forcefully defied Jim Crow laws like Luda Dabrowski and Grace Wilder and social tensions were felt from the tone of traveling teachers of the religion as well as a young African-American woman, Eva Flack McAllister - all this seeming to lower interest from higher social class White people, despite the fact that Shoghi Effendi had continued to hold a standard that Black seekers of the religion should be welcomed equally to White and the White not be given privilege of being first, though not going against public law in arranging for meetings. In affect the caution may have avoided the attention prone to violence, it also dampened the practical outreach to African-Americans where other communities across the South succeeded in gaining converts from both White and Black.
