This welding operation generates residual stresses which {{can have an}} important role in integrity assessments. In order to evaluate these stresses, an experimental and numerical programme has been conducted. The experiments includes cladding operations, macrographic analyses, temperature and residual stresses measurements with different methods. According to these measurements, <b>transversal</b> <b>stresses</b> (perpendicular to the welding direction) and longitudinal stresses (parallel to the welding direction) are highly tensile in stainless steel and they are compressive in the HAZ. Finite element calculations were used to simulate both welding operations and post weld heat treatment. These calculations coupled the thermal, metallurgical and mechanical aspects in a 2 D representation. Different models were studied including effect of generalised plane strain, transformation plasticity, creep and tempering. The <b>transversal</b> <b>stresses</b> calculated are similar to the measured ones, but the longitudinal stresses showed to be very sensitive to the model used. As expected because of the two-dimension model, the longitudinal stresses can't be well estimated.

A predictive model would be also very useful to determine the thermal loading which is at present dependant on measurements.

40|$|The local {{splitting}} behaviour in Fibre Reinforced Concrete (FRC) elements under a high {{concentrated load}} is gaining a growing interest, especially {{with reference to}} precast tunnel segments. In fact, during the lining construction process, high concentrated thrust jack forces are introduced in the segments leading to both high compressive stresses under the thrust shoes that can provoke a concrete crushing and tensile <b>transversal</b> <b>stresses</b> that can cause cracks and, eventually, a splitting failure. In order to investigate the main involved mechanisms during either splitting or crushing failure, a simplified analytical study is firstly presented on the two load configurations generally adopted in practice, namely the Line Load (LL) and the Point Load (PL). Based on this analytical study, experimental tests on Steel Fibre Reinforced Concrete (SFRC) specimens subjected to a LL configuration have been carried out.

To connect wooden pieces {{by means of}} friction welding, they are initially pressed against each other. The rapid movement {{of one of the}} pieces, applied simultaneously leads to friction, and heating generation, which is softening the material at the interface within a few seconds. This paper addresses the question to which extent welding of wood can be considered for structural joining of load bearing timber elements. For this purpose, experimental investigations on wood-welded double-lap joints were carried-out, in which a series of parameters, including overlap length, member thickness, etc., has been varied. This experimental campaign allowed for (a) the determination of the fracture mechanism of welded wood connections, (b) quantification of the influence of main design parameters on the strength of these and (c) delivering benchmark data related to the strength of welded wood joints, including its statistical component, for a subsequent joint strength prediction model. The experimental investigations were completed by numerical modelling of all investigated welded joints, which allowed to conclude that (1) failure of the investigated welded joints is triggered by a combination of shear and <b>transversal</b> <b>stresses</b> acting in the interface, but also that (2) joint strength is not linearly correlated to stress magnitudes...|$|R

30|$|The local {{examination}} of the microstructure and composition of the different nanowire segments revealed that their crystalline structure changes as the Co/Ni ratio is modified. Particularly, {{it was found that}} nanowire segments containing at least 60 % of cobalt display SAED patterns which correspond to hcp single crystals grown along the < 10 - 10 [*]>[*]direction. On the other hand, nanowire segments containing below 60 % of cobalt exhibit SAED patterns corresponding to a Co-Ni alloy single crystal with a fcc structure, where the < 111 [*]>[*]direction lies along the nanowire axis. Representative examples are shown in Figure  5. In particular, the segment highlighted with number (1) on the left of Figure  5 has a composition of Co 83 Ni 17, which was determined by EDS operating the microscope in TEM mode. The spots of the corresponding SAED pattern can be indexed to the [0001] zone axis of a Co-Ni single crystal with hcp structure. In addition, it is observed that the < 10 - 10 [*]>[*]direction lies along the nanowire axis. On the other hand, the segment highlighted with number (2) having Co 52 Ni 48 composition exhibits a SAED pattern that can be indexed to the [− 321] zone axis of a Co-Ni alloy with fcc structure, where the < 111 [*]>[*]direction lies along the nanowire axis. Interestingly, in several of these SAED patterns, the diffraction spots appear slightly elongated, or well, two or three spots appear very close. This fact evidences a texture that could be originated by fluctuations in the distribution of the Co/Ni ratio into the same segment and/or the effect of <b>transversal</b> <b>stresses</b> produced by the confined growth into the pores of the alumina template. The appearance of the hcp structure for Co-Ni alloys with high Co content is in agreement with its equilibrium phase diagram [26].

At first, a literature study was conducted to find out existing knowledge on the topic. The literature study was mainly focused on the stress wave analysis and modeling of drilling equipment. Based on the findings of the literature study a brief theoretical introduction was written. The theory was tested in practice by conducting a series of strain wave, acoustic, and surface vibrations measurements under laboratory conditions. To gain more understanding on the vibration phenomena in drill steels computational models were developed to provide tools for the sound production modeling of the drill steels. The modeling approach was to utilize modeling techniques that have previously been used in musical instrument modeling, such as digital waveguides and dispersion filters.

And thus the requirements of pressure and temperature for atom diffusion are met. Notable atom diffusion between butt-welded specimens is occurred, which promote the formation of permanent solid-state joints. On the other hand, unlike diffusion bonding relied on external force, present method utilizes self-established internal thermal elasto-plastic stress–strain field to promote the atom diffusion between butt-specimens.

30|$|Both {{numerical}} formulations for stirrups show {{a similar}} structural response. The main {{difference is the}} magnitude of the vertical mid-span displacement at point D. The layerwise stirrup formulation predicts a slightly earlier failure than the formulation based on the constant out-of-plane strain assumption. This {{can be explained by the}} difference in the ultimate strain of the confined concrete layers (Fig.  12) as a result of different stress states in the models. At point D the in-plane <b>transversal</b> <b>stress</b> component gives close values in both stirrup formulations (in the order of some tenth of MPa to 1  MPa) but the out-of plane <b>transversal</b> <b>stress</b> is significantly higher in the constant out-of-plane strain (around 9.5 – 10  MPa) than in the layerwise formulation (some tenth of MPa). This is a natural outcome of the fact that in this formulation only the concrete layers in compression carry stresses that equilibrate the force generated in the out-of-plane direction by the steel stirrup. The result generally is a smaller effective area (and its evolution) over which concrete stresses can act in the z direction, compared to the layerwise formulation. Because of the nature of the considered concrete yield surface a higher value of the confining stress allows for the development of a higher axial stress. The increased capacity of the confined concrete layers to carry stress results in the development of a higher hydrostatic stress, which influences beneficially the ultimate strain of confined concrete. Considering the experimentally-inspired asymptotic nature of the increase in concrete ultimate strain as a function of the confining hydrostatic stress, the peak value of ultimate strain at point D remains close in both stirrup formulations, as shown in Fig.  12. On the other hand, this particular test was observed to be extremely sensitive to the ultimate strain in concrete, therefore even a small variation in its value is apparent in the load-displacement curves.|$|E
