5|$|Johnston {{dismissed}} Smith's argument, {{asserting that}} neither the Federation nor Rhodesia had ever made such an appointment (this was actually false; the Federal government had opened independent diplomatic missions in South Africa and Portuguese Mozambique, and Rhodesia retained them both). Johnston concluded that Rhodesia was trying to prematurely advance its international standing. The previous entrustments, he said, {{had been made to}} allow Britain and Rhodesia to cooperate subject to Whitehall's ultimate authority, and did not entitle Rhodesia to do as it liked in the field of external affairs, especially if its chosen line ran counter to Britain's. In an attempt to intimidate Smith, Johnston sternly asked why the Rhodesian Prime Minister would risk causing a major international incident by deliberately defying Britain; Smith replied that following Britain's several slights against Rhodesia over the previous year and a half, Salisbury would not accept another. The conversation continued in this manner for some time afterwards. Smith proposed that <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>documents</b> be examined jointly by two judges, one British and one Rhodesian, but Johnston refused this. The meeting ended without agreement.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{organised}} {{a meeting}} with Johnston, starting at 09:00 on 18 August, where he informed the British High Commissioner that he had considered the Lisbon appointment extensively, {{with the help of}} Dupont, several legal advisers, and a judge of the Rhodesian High Court. The judge had examined <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>documents,</b> and had {{come to the conclusion that}} Dupont's interpretation of them was correct. Smith therefore felt certain that Reedman's appointment was legitimate so long as Portugal agreed. A long argument ensued, with neither man willing to budge. Smith said that he had always tried to be flexible and civil, but that he and his government felt they had to make a stand. By making clear to Lisbon the exact nature of their proposed representative, and informing Britain of their intent, Smith said the Rhodesians had filled every legal obligation.|$|E

25|$|James Burbage died in February 1597, and {{two months}} later the ground lease on the Theatre expired, Giles Allen having refused to renew it.

25|$|The future {{robustness}} of {{the highly}} secret investigation, in progress since 2008, may however be in some doubt. According to the leading Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza, soon after Siemiątkowski was charged by the prosecutors in Warsaw, the case was transferred and is now expected to be handled by a different prosecutorial team in Cracow.

25|$|In 1897, Rosenblum began a torrid {{affair with}} Margaret Thomas (née Callaghan), the {{youthful}} wife of Reverend Hugh Thomas, {{shortly before the}} latter's death. Rosenblum first met Thomas in London via his Ozone Preparations Company. Thomas had a kidney inflammation and was intrigued by the miracle cures peddled by Rosenblum. Thomas introduced Rosenblum to his young wife at his Manor House, {{and over the next}} six months they began having an affair. On 4 March 1898, Thomas altered his will and appointed Margaret as an executor. A week after the new will was made, Thomas and his nurse arrived at Newhaven Harbour Station. On 12 March 1898 Thomas was found dead in his hotel room. A mysterious Dr. T. W. Andrew, whose physical description matched that of Sigmund Rosenblum, appeared to certify Thomas's death as generic influenza and after signing <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>documents</b> proclaimed that there was no need for an inquest. Records indicate that there was no one by the name of Dr. T. W. Andrew in Great Britain circa 1897.|$|E

[...] Miller states that Hubbard was a disciple of Aleister Crowley, with the implication that Scientology derives from Crowley's teachings, but Frenschkowski concludes, [...] "Nevertheless it remains quite obvious that Hubbard did not take much inspiration from Crowley and Parsons." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although McGann {{received}} {{praise for}} his dramatic performance, the drama was never re-broadcast on the BBC. This {{is because the}} BBC came under fire from the Conservative Government due to {{the sensitivity of the}} subject matter of the Étaples Mutiny in 1917 at the [...] "Bull Ring", a harsh British Army training ground in Étaples, France. The events that occurred at the Bull Ring remain the subject of debate; <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>documents</b> will remain sealed until 2017. The critics claimed that the film was inaccurate and displayed a [...] "left-wing bias". Toplis was a mysterious figure and the film, like the source book, depicted him as an active participant in the Étaples Mutiny, before he was tracked down and killed some years after the end of World War I after he went on a violent criminal rampage. As a result, a minor political crisis in Britain was launched which prompted the BBC to remove all planned repeat screenings of the film. Despite the banning controversy, The Monocled Mutineer was released by the BBC on video in the early 1990s, and on DVD in 2007.|$|E
2500|$|Tsvangirai was {{detained}} near Lupane on 4 June, {{along with his}} security team and other top MDC officials, such as Thokozani Khupe and Lovemore Moyo. A lawyer for the MDC said that Tsvangirai was alleged to have addressed a rally near Lupane without permission. His vehicle was stopped by police at a roadblock and his motorcade was searched; after two hours, {{he was taken to}} a police station. The MDC described this as [...] "part of a determined and well-orchestrated effort to derail our campaign programme", while the US government called the incident [...] "deeply disturbing" [...] and the German government demanded his release; Amnesty International said that it was [...] "part of a sudden, sharp and dangerous crackdown on political opposition {{in the run-up to the}} elections". Tsvangirai was released later on the same day after nine hours. Bvudzijena, the police spokesman, rejected any suggestion that the police were trying to interfere in Tsvangirai's campaign; he explained the detention by saying that the police had wanted to determine whether a vehicle in Tsvangirai's motorcade had valid registration. According to Bvudzijena, the police had wanted to take only the driver of this vehicle to the police station to review <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>documents,</b> but that Tsvangirai and the rest of his entourage insisted on coming as well. Although the MDC said that Tsvangirai was released only after being charged with [...] "attracting a large number of people", Bvudzijena said that he had not been charged. In a statement on 5 June, Tsvangirai vowed to persevere, and the MDC said that he was continuing his campaign.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, Jerzy Zięborak {{revisited}} {{the evidence}} {{gathered by the}} Court of Inquiry in 1943 {{as well as other}} material that has been made available to date. His conclusion was that the accident resulted from the combination of factors. Firstly, the aircraft was overloaded and its centre of gravity was displaced beyond the permissible limit. Secondly, the aircraft speed at take-off was too low due to the excessive weight. Finally, the autopilot was switched on just after the take-off – contrary to the flight manual – and that caused an effect similar to the controls' jamming as seen by the second pilot. Evidence has been found that the surviving pilot Eduard Prchal did actually perform the second pilot's duties during the take-off, which he did not reveal {{at the time of the}} investigation. Jerzy Zięborak rejects General MacFarlane's opinion that Prchal's [...] during the take-off was the reason for the accident. He then compares Prchal's article written ten years after the accident with <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>documents</b> from the accident. It turns out that not only did Prchal write an untrue description of the accident, but he forgot some details he had earlier mentioned during his meetings with pilots. The differences included even the kinds of his own injury mentioned in the article and those reported in the medical examination after the accident. The author asks whether it was possible that Prchal had completely forgotten such details of the accident as for example the number of victims. The reason for these differences, i.e. whether Prchal lied deliberately in his article or suffered from a kind of partial amnesia as a result of his injury is not discussed. However, Jerzy Zięborak thinks that Prchal lied on purpose about the Mae West lifejacket.|$|E

We proposed modification of measure of mutual information for the query expansion; we calculate it between two words in each question and a word in its answer in the Q&A site corpus not to choose the words that are not suitable. The second method is for the candidate answer evaluation module. We proposed the method to evaluate candidate answers using existing two methods, i.e., the Web relevance score and the translation probability. We showed that the proposed method evaluated the candidate answers more effectively than the original methods. The experiments were carried out using a Japanese Q&A site corpus. They revealed that the first method was significantly better than the original method when the accuracies and MRR were compared. They also showed that the second method was significantly better than the original methods when the MRR were compared.|$|R
