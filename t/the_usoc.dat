5|$|Following Chicago's loss, <b>the</b> <b>USOC</b> {{declined}} {{to bid for}} the 2020 Summer Olympics, which was ultimately awarded to Tokyo. <b>The</b> <b>USOC</b> later entered {{the race for the}} 2024 Summer Olympics with Boston but withdrew their bid. <b>The</b> <b>USOC</b> quickly selected Los Angeles to be the American candidate for the 2024 Olympics. After the IOC decided to award the hosts of both the 2024 and 2028 Olympics in 2017, Los Angeles declared their candidature for 2028, securing the 2024 Olympics for Paris with Los Angeles securing the 2028 edition.|$|E
5|$|The {{final stage}} of <b>the</b> <b>USOC</b> {{internal}} selection occurred on April 14, 2007, at Washington, D.C.'s Embassy Row Hotel, where the two remaining bid cities, Chicago and Los Angeles, made a last 40-minute presentation to <b>the</b> <b>USOC</b> board members.

5|$|In 2016, Boston briefly {{shouldered}} a bid as the US applicant for the 2024 Summer Olympics. The bid {{was supported}} by the mayor and a coalition of business leaders and local philanthropists, but was eventually dropped due to public opposition. <b>The</b> <b>USOC</b> then selected Los Angeles to be the American candidate with Los Angeles ultimately securing the right to host the 2028 Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|The {{sport was}} again {{included}} in the subsequent 1924 games in Paris. <b>The</b> <b>USOC</b> decided to send a team in order to defend their gold medal. Along with the U.S. and the host nation, Romania entered. The American team was again made up of mainly Californian players, seven of whom {{were members of the}} 1920 team. The U.S. squad departed on a seven-day voyage to England on an ocean liner from New York City.|$|E
5|$|Individual {{athletes have}} {{also used the}} Olympic stage to promote their own {{political}} agenda. At the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, two American track and field athletes, Tommie Smith and John Carlos, who finished first and third in the 200metres, performed the Black Power salute on the victory stand. The second-place finisher, Peter Norman of Australia, wore an Olympic Project for Human Rights badge in support of Smith and Carlos. In response to the protest, IOC president Avery Brundage told the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) to either send the two athletes home or withdraw the track and field team. <b>The</b> <b>USOC</b> opted for the former. During the same Olympics, Czechoslovakian gymnast Věra Čáslavská announced her protest to the Soviet-led invasion of her home country after controversially receiving Silver on the Beam and a shared Gold on the Floor. During the Soviet anthem, Čáslavská turned her head down {{and to the right}} of the Soviet flag in order to make a statement over the invasion and the Soviet influence of the sport of Gymnastics. Returning home, Čáslavská was made an outcast by the Soviet government and was banned from competition and travelling.|$|E

5|$|The IIHF {{follows the}} World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) {{regulations}} on performance-enhancing drugs. The IIHF maintains a Registered Testing Pool, {{a list of}} top players who are subjected to random in-competition and out-of-competition drug tests. According to the WADA, a positive in-competition test results in disqualification of the player and a suspension that varies {{based on the number}} of offences. When a player tests positive, the rest of their team is subjected to testing; another positive test can result in a disqualification of the entire team. In 2001, the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) pushed for American NHL players who were potential Olympians to be subject to random drug tests. <b>The</b> <b>USOC</b> requires all Olympic-bound athletes to be randomly tested by the United States Anti-Doping Agency, but had exempted NHL players in 1998. The NHL preferred a more uniform method, in which all players would undergo the same number of tests from the WADA. An agreement was reached that the WADA would start testing players after the NHL playoffs were finished.|$|E

25|$|The United States, {{represented}} by the United States Olympic Committee (USOC), competed at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. U.S. athletes have competed in every Summer Olympic Games in the modern era, except the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, which was boycotted by the US team and many others. <b>The</b> <b>USOC</b> sent a total of 596 athletes to Beijing (310 men and 286 women), and competed in all Olympic sports except handball.|$|E
25|$|The USA Weightlifting {{trials were}} held on May 25 in Atlanta, Georgia. The initial team {{included}} seven competitors and two alternates. Casey Burgener was originally selected to lift at the +105kg event after <b>the</b> <b>USOC</b> {{reported that the}} International Weightlifting Federation offered the United States a third men's Olympic slot. The third slot never materialized, and the United States was not placed on the start list for the +105 event.

25|$|United {{failed to}} build on the {{momentum}} of the Kansas City win, suffering a crushing 0-2 home loss to Seattle, on late goals by rookie Jordan Morris and Joevin Jones. The entire MLS went on break for the Copa América Centenario. Birnbaum and Saborio were called up to their respective national team squads for the USA and Costa Rica. During the league break, the team made an unusual move, adding 16-year old youth national team captain Chris Durkin as a Homegrown Player signing. Durkin was one of the youngest signings in league history, but the unusual deal did not add Durkin to D.C. United's MLS roster. Instead, he was available to play in a U.S. Open Cup match the next day, and would go out on loan after the match, first to Richmond Kickers, and then to resume his residency with the national team program in Bradenton as least until the USA U-17s finished their run at the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup. Durkin did make his debut in <b>the</b> <b>USOC</b> match and by all accounts looked very much as if he belonged. However, the team was unable to break through against the Ft. Lauderdale Strikers defense, and the D.C. squad made a quick exit from the competition, after losing to the Strikers in a penalty kick shootout. When MLS league action resumed, United claimed 4 points in their final 2 matches of the month, including a dreary 0-0 draw in Houston that produced no excitement until stoppage time, when Bill Hamid was forced into two spectacular reaction saves. D.C. United turned in a stronger performance with some home cooking against the New England Revolution, as Neagle and Franklin turned in highlight reel goals, and the home team cruised to a 2-0 win.|$|E
50|$|In May 2012, USOC’s leaders {{negotiated}} a resolution with the IOC, addressing a decades-long revenue sharing debate and {{paving the way}} for a peaceful future between the two bodies.

500|$|There {{has been}} {{criticism}} for not providing equal funding to Paralympic athletes {{as compared to}} Olympic athletes. [...] An example of this criticism was {{a lawsuit filed by}} Paralympic athletes Tony Iniguez, Scot Hollonbeck and Jacob Heilveil of the United States, in 2003. They alleged that the United States Olympic Committee (USOC), which also include <b>the</b> <b>USOC</b> Paralympic Division (the National Paralympic Committee), was underfunding American Paralympic athletes. Iniguez cited the fact that <b>the</b> <b>USOC</b> made healthcare benefits available to a smaller percentage of Paralympians, <b>the</b> <b>USOC</b> provided smaller quarterly training stipends and paid smaller financial awards for medals won at a Paralympics. US Paralympians saw this as a disadvantage for the US Paralympic athletes, as nations such as Canada and Britain supported Paralympians and Olympians virtually equally. <b>The</b> <b>USOC</b> did not deny the discrepancy in funding and contended that this was {{due to the fact that}} it did not receive any government financial support. [...] As a result, it had to rely on revenue generated by the media exposure of its athletes. [...] Olympic athletic success resulted in greater exposure for <b>the</b> <b>USOC</b> than Paralympic athletic achievements. [...] The case was heard by lower courts, who ruled that <b>the</b> <b>USOC</b> has the right to allocate its finances to athletes at different rates. [...] The case was appealed to the Supreme Court, where on September 6, 2008 it announced that it would not hear the appeal. However, during the time the lawsuit lasted (from 2003 to 2008), the funding from <b>the</b> <b>USOC</b> had nearly tripled. In 2008 $11.4million was earmarked for Paralympic athletes, up from $3million in 2004.|$|E
500|$|There were racial {{tensions}} between black US athletes and their white counterparts; in one incident, African Americans blocked whites from the track. One black runner, Tommie Smith, told writers on October 15, [...] "I don't want Brundage presenting me any medals". The following day, Smith won the 200 meters, and fellow African-American John Carlos took the bronze medal. The two men, after receiving their medals from IAAF president Lord Exeter, and as [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner" [...] played, raised black-gloved fists, heads down, in salute of black power. Although <b>the</b> <b>USOC</b> initially only reprimanded the two men, {{under pressure from}} the IOC, two days after the race it suspended them from the team and expelled them from the Olympic Village. Other demonstrations by African-Americans also took place: the three African Americans who took the medals in the 400 meters race, led by gold medalist Lee Evans, wore black berets during the anthem (they were not disciplined by <b>the</b> <b>USOC)</b> while African-American boxer George Foreman, triumphant in the heavyweight division, waved an American flag around the boxing ring and with fellow American boxers invited Brundage to their victory celebration. Brundage's comment about the Smith-Carlos incident was [...] "Warped mentalities and cracked personalities seem to be everywhere and impossible to eliminate." [...] The USOC's official report omits the iconic photograph of Smith and Carlos with their fists raised; the local organizing committee's official film showed footage of the ceremony. Brundage, who termed the incident [...] "the nasty demonstration against the American flag by negroes", objected in vain to its inclusion.|$|E
500|$|Strict rules {{govern the}} conduct of athletes during the medal ceremony. For example, they are {{required}} to wear only pre-approved outfits that are standard for the athlete's national Olympic team. [...] They are not allowed to display any political affiliation or make a political statement while on the medal stand. The most famous violation of this rule was the Black Power salute of Tommie Smith and John Carlos at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. [...] For their actions, IOC president Avery Brundage demanded their expulsion from the Olympics. [...] If the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) did not comply, then Brundage demanded the removal of the entire track and field team of the United States. [...] <b>The</b> <b>USOC</b> complied with his demands and Smith and Carlos were expelled.|$|E

500|$|Since balloting is {{secret and}} IOC members rarely share their voting tendencies, {{there has been}} much {{speculation}} as to why Chicago lost the Olympic bid so early in the process. [...] Michelle Higgins on The New York Times blog argued that an overly restrictive passport and visa policy was one such reason. [...] CBS 2 Chicago's website suggested that anti-Americanism may have contributed. [...] Bid CEO Patrick Ryan was quoted in the Chicago Sun-Times as saying [...] "bloc voting" [...] and assumptions by others in the IOC that Chicago had enough votes {{to make it to the}} second round of voting led to its early demise. [...] The same article hinted at fractious relations, noted by The Seattle Times, between the IOC and USOC over the corporate background of <b>the</b> <b>USOC</b> executives and the [...] "inordinate" [...] share of revenue that they receive.|$|E
500|$|Trademark controversies arose for [...] "Chicago2016.com" [...] and [...] "Tokyo2016.com", {{when both}} were {{registered}} in 2004 by entrepreneur Stephen Frayne Jr., an MBA {{student at the}} Kellogg School of Management; he also claimed around 40 other domain names whose city/year format mimicked the way Olympic Games are marketed. Frayne's stated intent for the site was a [...] "comprehensive, balanced discussion" [...] of the benefits and pitfalls of holding the Olympics in Chicago; the Chicago 2016 committee contended that his real intent was to profit from cybersquatting. The Chicago Olympic bid organization, which had been using Chicago2016.org as its official web site, sought control of Chicago2016.com through a complaint filed with an international arbitration organization. Attempts by <b>the</b> <b>USOC</b> to have the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) release the names failed. [...] Frayne sued in the U.S. District Court in Chicago, seeking an injunction against the arbitration proceedings. [...] On September 25, 2008, the WIPO arbitration panel granted Frayne's motion to suspend and terminate proceedings setting up a battle in the federal court in the Northern District of Illinois.|$|E
500|$|Early cost {{estimates}} hovered at $5 billion, with $1.1 {{billion for the}} lakeside Olympic Village and an additional estimated $366 million for a temporary 80,000 seat Olympic Stadium {{to be built in}} Washington Park. Nonetheless, the proposed budget was small in comparison to the Beijing Olympics, which are estimated to have cost $40 billion. [...] Further, the 2004 Olympic games in Athens, initially budgeted to cost $2.4 billion, in fact cost $9 billion. [...] On April 11, 2007, former Governor of Illinois Rod Blagojevich proposed $150 million in state funding to help secure the bid to <b>the</b> <b>USOC</b> for Chicago. [...] Current Governor Pat Quinn stated that {{he would be willing to}} support any funding necessary to secure the Olympics for Chicago. By April 14, over $35 million in cash and $13 million in goods had been pledged, including donations in excess of $100,000 from at least 225 individuals and corporations. Chicago had strong allies to pursue federal funds for security and transportation: U.S. Senator Dick Durbin was the second in command among Democratic Senators as the Whip, and former Senator Barack Obama had become the President of the United States. The city announced a $500 million insurance policy against cost overruns and revenue shortfalls.|$|E
