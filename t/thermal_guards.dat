40|$|A {{multi-purpose}} {{thermal insulation}} test apparatus {{is used for}} testing insulation materials, or other components. The test apparatus is a fluid boil-off calorimeter system for calibrated measurement of the apparent thermal conductivity (k-value) of a specimen material at a fixed vacuum level. The apparatus includes an inner vessel for receiving a fluid with a normal boiling point below ambient temperature, such as liquid nitrogen, enclosed within a vacuum chamber. A cold mass assembly, including the inner vessel and <b>thermal</b> <b>guards,</b> is suspended {{from the top of}} the vacuum chamber. Handling tools attach to the cold mass assembly for convenient manipulation of the assembly and for the installation or wrapping of insulation test materials. Liquid nitrogen is typically supplied to the inner vessel using a fill tube with funnel. A single port through the top of the vacuum chamber facilitates both filling and venting. Aerogel composite stacks with reflective films are fastened to the top and the bottom of the inner vessel as <b>thermal</b> <b>guards.</b> The comparative k-value of the insulation material is determined by measuring the boil-off flow rate of gas, the temperature differential across the insulation thickness, and the dimensions (length and diameters) of the test specimen...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Two-phase heat {{transfer}} {{devices such as}} heat pipes and vapor chambers are composed of an evaporator, an adiabatic section and a condenser. For the dry-out prevention and capillary purpose, adiabatic sections and evaporators are covered by wick structures. Common wick structures are grooves, mesh, sintered powder and their combination. Combining with the wick structures, the major phase change effects on evaporators are thin-film evaporation. For the research between parameters of wick structure and evaporator performance, we developed a facility to measure the {{heat transfer}} on evaporators. To ensure the least heat losing, the path of heat flux and test condition were designed with several <b>thermal</b> <b>guards.</b> A pressure control system was established with balance mechanisms to maintain a stable condition of low pressure. Since temperature differences are very fast while the major phase change effect is thin-film evaporation, a high speed data acquisition system was used. Based on this test platform, the performance of evaporators can be determined at specific conditions...|$|E
40|$|A sensor for {{measuring}} small convective heat flows (< 0. 2 W/cm^ 2) from micro-structured surfaces is designed and tested. This sensor {exploits {{the notion of}} <b>thermal</b> <b>guard</b> and is purposely designed} to deal with metal samples made by additive manufacturing, {such as} {{direct metal laser sintering}} (DMLS). For validation purposes, we utilize both experimental literature data and a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model: Maximum and average deviations from CDF model in terms of the Nusselt number are on the order of +/- 13. 7 % and +/- 6. 3 %, respectively while deviations from literature data are even smaller. Similar works in the literature often have the necessity of maintaining one-directional heat flows along the main dimension of a conducting bar using insulating materials. Such an approach can be critical for small fluxes due to the curse of heat conduction losses along secondary directions. As a result, it is necessary to estimate those secondary fluxes (e. g. by numerical models), thus making the measurement difficult and indirect. On the other hand, depending on the manufacturing accuracy, the present sensor enables to practically reduce at will those losses, with direct measurement of the heat flux. To our knowledge, the adoption of <b>thermal</b> <b>guard</b> is not a common practice in convective heat transfer, especially when local measurements are of interest. We hope that this study may (i) shed light on the usefulness of the approach in this field; and (ii) provide an effective tool for future investigation on electronic cooling and convective heat transfer enhancement by micro-/nano-structured surfaces. Owing to a number of features of the proposed device, we suggest that it can be prospectively utilized in the near future (i) for industrial applications (due to simplicity and robustness of the design); (ii) for high temperature measurements (unlike foil sensors, no delamination issues can be experienced); (iii) in the context of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) (easy to miniaturize) ...|$|R
40|$|An {{apparatus}} and method {{have been developed}} for measuring the rates of leakage of heat into pipes carrying liquids, the purpose of the measurements being to quantify the thermal performance of the insulation system. The apparatus is designed primarily for testing pipes used to carry cryogenic liquids, but can also be used for measuring the thermal performance of other insulated pipes or piping systems. The basic measurement principle is straightforward: The outer surface of the pipe insulation is maintained at a fixed warmer temperature. The interior of the pipe is maintained in a narrow fixed lower-temperature range by means of a regular liquid (e. g., water) that is pumped through the pipe at a known flow rate or a cryogenic liquid (e. g., nitrogen) that is saturated at atmospheric pressure and replenished until steady-state conditions are achieved. In the case of water or another liquid pumped through, the inlet and outlet temperatures are measured and heat-leak power is calculated as the mass flow rate of the liquid multiplied by the specific heat of the liquid multiplied by the inlet-to-outlet temperature rise of the liquid. In the case of liquid nitrogen or another low-temperature boiling liquid, the heat-leak power is calculated as the rate of boil-off multiplied by the latent heat of vaporization of the liquid. Then the thermal-insulation performance of the pipe system can be calculated {{as a function of the}} measured heat-leak power, the inner and outer boundary temperatures, and the dimensions of the pipe. The apparatus can test as many as three pipes simultaneously. The pipes can have inner diameters up to. 15 cm and outer diameters up to. 20 cm. The lengths of the pipes may vary; typical lengths are of the order of 18 m. Two <b>thermal</b> <b>guard</b> boxes. one for each end of the pipe(s) under test. are used to make the inlet and outlet fluid connections to the pipe(s) (see figure). The connections include bellows that accommodate thermal expansion and contraction of the pipes. The guard boxes and pipe(s) are positioned so that the pipe(s) slope upward from the upstream to the downstream end at an angle of at least 2. The upward slope allows vapor bubbles to accumulate at the downstream end. The <b>thermal</b> <b>guard</b> boxes keep the ends of the pipes at the lower interior temperature to prevent spurious lengthwise leakage of heat into the pipes. It is important to prevent this spurious heat leakage because, if it were allowed to occur, it could contribute a large error in the measured heat-leak power. The upstream <b>thermal</b> <b>guard</b> box includes a heat exchanger through which liquid flowing into the pipe(s) is subcooled to the saturation temperature corresponding to the ambient pressure. Conversely, this heat exchanger can also be used to warm the flowing liquid to a desired fixed temperature. The apparatus includes a temperature control device that is placed around each pipe under test. Each device is operated under thermostatic control to maintain the outer surface of the pipe insulation at the specified test temperature. All measurements are recorded on a portable data-acquisition system...|$|R

40|$|A compact {{additive}} manufactured flat-panel gas-gap heat switch {{operating at}} cryogenic temperature is {{reported in this}} paper. A guarded-hot-plate apparatus has been developed to measure the thermal conductance of the heat switch with the heat sink temperature {{in the range of}} 100 – 180 K. The apparatus is cooled by a two-stage GM cooler and the temperature is controlled with a heater and a braided copper wire connection. A <b>thermal</b> <b>guard</b> is mounted on the hot side of the device to confine the heat flow axially through the sample. A gas handling system allows testing the device with different gas pressures in the heat switch. Experiments are performed at various heat sink temperatures, by varying gas pressure in the gas-gap and with helium, hydrogen and nitrogen gas. The measured off-conductance with a heat sink temperature of 115 K and the hot plate at 120 K is 0. 134 W/K, the on-conductance with helium and hydrogen gases at the same temperatures is 4. 80 W/K and 4. 71 W/K, respectively. This results in an on/off conductance ratio of 37 ± 7 and 35 ± 6 for helium and hydrogen respectively. The experimental results matches fairly well with the predicted heat conductance at cryogenic temperatures...|$|R
50|$|Textron's Survivable Combat Tactical Vehicle (SCTV) is a {{protective}} capsule that can increase Humvee survivability to MRAP levels while significantly improving mobility; the modifications come in five kits, but all five {{need to be}} installed before the vehicle can be properly called an SCTV. The vehicle features a monocoque V-shaped hull and angled sides to help deflect rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) with scalable levels of protection. It has greater engine power, replacing the 6.5 liter diesel engine with a Cummins 6.7 liter diesel and Allison 6-speed transmission, {{as well as a}} stronger transmission and suspension, improved brakes, higher ground clearance, and new onboard instrumentation. Fuel capacity is increased from 27 gallons to 40 and the battery and fuel cells are moved from under the rear seat {{to the rear of the}} vehicle. Also included are a powerful air conditioner and heating system, run-flat tires, a <b>thermal</b> <b>guard</b> liner under the roof, sharp edges removed from inside the cabin, blast attenuating seats, and a folding gunner's turret allowing rapid deployment from a cargo aircraft or shipboard below deck. Although heavier than the Humvee, the SCTV is half the weight and costs $150,000 less than a comparably survivable MRAP. The basic version is a four-passenger armament carrier, but it can be configured as a nine-passenger troop carrier, air-defense vehicle, flatbed cargo truck, or field ambulance depending on the type of Humvee it is converted from.|$|R
40|$|Microelectronics {{has enjoyed}} great {{success in the}} past century. As the {{technology}} node progresses, the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor scaling has already reached a wall, and serious challenges in high-bandwidth interconnects and fast-speed signal processing arise. The incorporation of photonics to microelectronics provides potential solutions. The theme of this thesis {{is focused on the}} novel applications of travelling-wave microresonators such as microdisks and microrings for the on-chip optical interconnects and signal processing. Challenges arising from these applications including theoretical and experimental ones are addressed. On the theoretical aspect, a modified version of coupled mode theory is offered for the TM-polarization in high index contrast material systems. Through numerical comparisons, it is shown that our modified coupled mode theory is more accurate than all the existing ones. The coupling-induced phase responses are also studied, which is of critical importance to coupled-resonator structures. Different coupling structures are studied by a customized numerical code, revealing that the phase response of symmetric couplers with the symmetry about the wave propagating direction can be simply estimated while the one of asymmetric couplers is more complicated. Mode splitting and scattering loss, which are two important features commonly observed in the spectrum of high-Q microresonators, are also investigated. Our review of the existing analytical approaches shows that they have only achieved partial success. Especially, different models have been proposed for several distinct regimes and cannot be reconciled. In this thesis, a unified approach is developed for the general case to achieve a complete understanding of these two effects. On the experimental aspect, we first develop a new fabrication recipe with a focus on the accurate dimensional control and low-loss performance. HSQ is employed as the electron-beam resist, and the lithography and plasma etching steps are both optimized to achieve vertical and smooth sidewalls. A third-order temperature-insensitive coupled-resonator filter is designed and demonstrated in the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform, which serves as a critical building block element in terabit/s on-chip networks. Two design challenges, i. e., a broadband flat-band response and a temperature-insensitive design, are coherently addressed by employing the redundant bandwidth of the filter channel caused by the dispersion as <b>thermal</b> <b>guard</b> band. As a result, the filter can accommodate 21 WDM channels with a data rate up to 100 gigabit/s per wavelength channel, while providing a sufficient <b>thermal</b> <b>guard</b> band to tolerate more than ± 15 °C temperature fluctuations in the on-chip environment. In this thesis, high-Q microdisk resonators are also proposed to be used as low-loss delay lines for narrowband filters. Pulley coupling scheme is used to selectively couple to one of the radial modes of the microdisk and also to achieve a strong coupling. A first-order tunable narrowband filter based on the microdisk-based delay line is experimentally demonstrated in an SOI platform, which shows a tunable bandwidth from 4. 1 GHz to 0. 47 GHz with an overall size of 0. 05 mm². Finally, to address the challenges for the resonator-based delay lines encountered in the SOI platform, we propose to vertically integrate silicon nitride to the SOI platform, which can potentially have significantly lower propagation loss and higher power handling capability. High-Q silicon nitride microresonators are demonstrated; especially, microresonators with a 16 million intrinsic Q and a moderate size of 240 µm radius are realized, which is one order of magnitude improvement compared to what can be achieved in the SOI platform using the same fabrication technology. We have also successfully grown silicon nitride on top of SOI and a good coupling has been achieved between the silicon nitride and the silicon layers. Ph. D...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{heat flux}} {{measurements}} {{are needed to}} gain a better knowledge of the thermal performance of buildings and to evaluate the heat exchange among various parts of a building envelope. Heat flux meters (HFMs) are commonly used both in laboratory applications and in situ for measuring one-dimensional heat fluxes and, thus, estimating the thermal transmittance of material samples and existing buildings components. Building applications often requires heat flux measurements below 100 W center dot m(- 2). However, a standard reference system generating such a low heat flux is available only in a few national metrology institutes (NMIs). In this work, a numerical study aimed at designing an HFM calibration apparatus operating in the heat flux range from 5 W center dot m(- 2) to 100 W center dot m(- 2) is presented. Predictions about the metrological performance of such a calibration system were estimated by numerical modeling exploiting a commercial FEM code (COMSOL(A (R))). On the basis of the modeling results, an engineered design of such an apparatus was developed and discussed in detail. The system was designed for two different purposes: (i) for measuring the thermal conductivity of insulators and (ii) for calibrating an HFM with an absolute method (i. e., by measuring the applied power from the heater and its active cross section) or by a relative method (i. e., by measuring the temperature drop across a reference material of known thickness and thermal conductivity). The numerical investigations show that in order to minimize the uncertainty of the generated heat flux, a fine temperature control on the <b>thermal</b> <b>guard</b> is needed. The predicted standard uncertainty is within 2 % at 10 W center dot m(- 2) and within 0. 5 % at 100 W center dot m(- 2) ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} thesis, novel methods devoted to develop high heat {{transfer}} efficiency devices have been presented. These methods rely on both novel manufacturing techniques, {{belonging to the}} class of additive manufacturing (AM), and thermal and fluid-dynamics studies and optimization procedures. As a first result, optimization of a traditional heat exchanger from a real application, i. e. million of units produced per year, is presented; That is manufactured by extrusion. A thermal fluid-dynamic model is experimentally validated (from an industrial experimental test rig) and used for optimization purposes. Results demonstrate {{there is room for}} efficiency optimization even in well established heat transfer devices configurations based on traditional manufacturing techniques. Then, an experimental rig for ''in house'' thermal characterization is designed. It guarantees high precision measurement of small convective heat fluxes (forced air) on enhanced solutions investigated hereinafter, namely micro-structured surfaces and small heat transfer devices. To deal with that challenge, an innovative convective heat flux sensor is developed. That exploits the concept of <b>thermal</b> <b>guard</b> to avoid any spurious perturbation between the flow field and investigated surfaces, while it allows to cancel out terms due to spreading conduction phenomenon. Results demonstrate remarkable accuracy in direct measurement of convective heat fluxes through this novel concept. Relying on the proposed experimental rig, various methods for enhanced convective heat transfer are experimentally investigated. Firstly, regular patterns of micro-protrusions are studied. Effect of fluid-dynamics and geometrical length on heat transfer performances are discussed. More important, they have been applied to develop an optimization procedure tailored to deal with AM techniques. Results from both experimental investigation and optimization procedure suggest the existence of an optimal value of protrusion height, that maximize performance-to-cost ratio for patterns made by AM. Then, surface roughness of components built by DMLS has been investigated as an augmentation heat transfer technique. Surface roughness is controlled varying DMLS process parameters and its effect on convective heat transfer is measured. The results demonstrate a remarkable enhancement in convective heat transfer due to DMLS artificial roughness, in the investigated configurations. That preliminary study unveils the potential of AM artificial roughness as an heat transfer enhancement techniques. It has been considered, by academic and industrial institutions, as an important step towards development of next generation gas turbine components and electronic cooling devices. Finally, extreme flexibility in shape of parts built by DMLS is exploited to design and fabricate in one step an unconventional heat transfer device, called Pitot heat exchanger. Enhanced heat transfer efficiency is achieved, with regard to standard heat exchangers. Nevertheless, the most important achievement has been to highlight unusual morphologies allowed by AM can pave the way to revolutionary changes in conceiving and designing heat transfer component...|$|R
40|$|A {{concrete}} wall externally insulated with six expanded polystyrene boards, each containing three vacuum insulation panels, was investigated both experimentally and numerically. The main {{goal of this}} study was to determine the thermal performance of vacuum-insulation panels applied to walls in building constructions. Comparisons were made with conventional insulation and also with systems including damaged, i. e., vented vacuum panels. Since the vacuum insulation panels are encased in a metallized laminates as barriers against permeation of moisture and gas, special attention was given to the edge effects. Stepwise adjustment of the measured and calculated results reported here provide a general assessment of the efficacy of this insulation system applied on different wall materials. A functional representation of the measured data, for steady-state conditions, is introduced. Moreover, infrared thermography was used to confirm the three dimensionally calculated temperature distributions on the surface.

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of regional anaesthesia on post surgery opioid induced hyperalgesia in diabetic and non-diabetic mice. MethodsDiabetic and non-diabetic mice underwent plantar surgery. Levobupivacaine and sufentanil were used before surgery, for sciatic nerve block (regional anaesthesia) and analgesia, respectively. Diabetic and non-diabetic groups were each randomly assigned to three subgroups: control, no sufentanil and no levobupivacaine; sufentanil and no levobupivacaine; sufentanil and levobupivacaine. Three tests were used to assess pain behaviour: mechanical nociception; <b>thermal</b> nociception and <b>guarding</b> behaviours using a pain scale. ResultsSufentanil, alone or in combination with levobupivacaine, produced antinociceptive effects shortly after administration. Subsequently, sufentanil induced hyperalgesia in diabetic and non-diabetic mice. Opioid-induced hyperalgesia was enhanced in diabetic mice. Levobupivacaine associated to sufentanil completely prevented hyperalgesia in both groups of mice. ConclusionThe results suggest that regional anaesthesia can decrease opioid-induced hyperalgesia in diabetic as well as in non-diabetic mice. These observations may be clinically relevant for the management of diabetic patients...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Tissue injury elicits both {{hypersensitivity}} to evoked stimuli and ongoing, stimulus-independent pain. We previously {{demonstrated that}} pain relief elicits reward in nerve-injured rats. This approach {{was used to}} evaluate the temporal and mechanistic features of inflammation-induced ongoing pain. Results Intraplantar Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) produced <b>thermal</b> hyperalgesia and <b>guarding</b> behavior that was reliably observed within 24 hrs and maintained, albeit diminished, 4 days post-administration. Spinal clonidine produced robust conditioned place preference (CPP) in CFA treated rats 1 day, but not 4 days following CFA administration. However, spinal clonidine blocked CFA-induced thermal hyperalgesia at both post-CFA days 1 and 4, indicating different time-courses of ongoing and evoked pain. Peripheral nerve block by lidocaine administration into the popliteal fossa 1 day following intraplantar CFA produced a robust preference for the lidocaine paired chamber, indicating that injury-induced ongoing pain is driven by afferent fibers innervating the site of injury. Pretreatment with resiniferatoxin (RTX), an ultrapotent capsaicin analogue known to produce long-lasting desensitization of TRPV 1 positive afferents, fully blocked CFA-induced thermal hypersensitivity and abolished the CPP elicited by administration of popliteal fossa lidocaine 24 hrs post-CFA. In addition, RTX pretreatment blocked guarding behavior observed 1 day following intraplantar CFA. In contrast, administration of the selective TRPV 1 receptor antagonist, AMG 9810, at a dose that reversed CFA-induced thermal hyperalgesia failed to reduce CFA-induced ongoing pain or guarding behavior. Conclusions These data demonstrate that inflammation induces both ongoing pain and evoked hypersensitivity that can be differentiated on the basis of time course. Ongoing pain (a) is transient, (b) driven by peripheral input resulting from the injury, (c) dependent on TRPV 1 positive fibers and (d) not blocked by TRPV 1 receptor antagonism. Mechanisms underlying excitation of these afferent fibers in the early post-injury period will offer insights for development of novel pain relieving strategies in the early post-traumatic period. </p...|$|R
