5|$|Don instructs the Jaguar team {{to ditch}} the {{mistress}} concept {{because it is}} vulgar. Later, Harry praises Peggy's work on Chevalier Blanc. She tells Don the client ultimately went with the same ad as before, only in a Paris setting. Don says Ginsberg will take over once the Jaguar pitch is finished, prompting Peggy to reply {{that she is not}} in charge of everything. Don pulls some money from his wallet and condescendingly tosses it in Peggy's face, telling her that if she wants to go to Paris, she should just go. Ken tries to comfort her, saying <b>that</b> <b>Don</b> is just upset about Jaguar, to which she replies that she does not care.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Jack Donaghy's (Alec Baldwin) {{aspirations}} of becoming CEO of General Electric (GE) {{comes to a}} halt when his girlfriend and CNBC host, Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) informs him that the Philadelphia-based cable company Kabletown is rumored to be buying NBC. Jack—who serves as Vice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming for GE—insists that no sale is pending, as he believes that his mentor and GE CEO Don Geiss (Rip Torn) would not agree to such a deal. As rumors persist, Jack panics, but things get worse when he learns from former GE chairman Jack Welch (as himself) <b>that</b> <b>Don</b> Geiss has been dead for weeks and that the company negotiated a takeover with Kabletown. Welch kept Geiss's death a secret while negotiations took place. Liz comforts Jack when he admits his dream of running GE is crushed. The next day, on Avery Jessup's program, The Hot Box, Jessup confirms that the buyout has gone forward, praising Jack Donaghy as a wise choice to lead Kabletown's new acquisition. Jack, who is watching the program, is cheered by this.|$|E

5000|$|On March 15, 1979, {{shortly after}} the release of Superman, the Salkinds {{replaced}} Donner with Lester for Superman II. The exact reasoning and details behind Donner's departure are still debated. In his 2006 DVD commentary for Superman II, Spengler claims <b>that</b> <b>Donner</b> was indeed invited back to finish the sequel, but <b>that</b> <b>Donner</b> refused, telling Army Archerd in a March 1978 interview for Variety magazine {{that he would not be}} returning to direct as long as Spengler was acting producer. However, Donner told Starlog in 1989 that he was not invited back and that he did not know production had continued on the sequel until he received a telegram from the Salkinds telling him: [...] "Your services are no longer needed." ...|$|R
25|$|At {{the fifteenth}} attempt {{since the war}} we won at Melbourne...It was then that I felt that the great Australian team was just {{beginning}} to deteriorate. The quality of the Test sides usually runs in cycles. A number of the batsmen who scored heavily on previous occasions found <b>that</b> <b>Don</b> Bradman had not spent hours at the wicket softening the bowling, and run-scoring against bowlers who were not tired was not so easy.|$|E
25|$|In late 1940s Carlism {{lost its}} {{influence}} on Gipuzkoan , FET and major local ayuntamientos. Having returned to San Sebastían Arrúe resumed his semi-official Carlist activities; as the movement decomposed into many factions, he stayed loyal to Fal and the regent. He was with those judging that the regency aroused little enthusiasm amongst the rank-and-file and merely encouraged damaging dynastical competition; hence, he preferred <b>that</b> <b>Don</b> Javier announces his personal claim to the throne, which indeed took place in 1952.|$|E
25|$|He did {{not achieve}} {{much in the}} Test matches but it was off his bowling <b>that</b> <b>Don</b> Bradman {{completed}} his 100th first class century. When Bradman reached 99, in the match for an Australian XI against the Indians, the Indian captain Lala Amarnath brought Kishenchand on to bowl. It was his first try at bowling during the tour. After playing a few balls carefully, Bradman took a single past mid-on to reach his hundred. He scored a duck {{in each of the}} five Tests that he played.|$|E

25|$|It {{is certain}} that from the day <b>that</b> <b>Don</b> Hernando Cortés, Marques del Valle, entered this land, in the seven years, more or less, that he governed, the natives {{suffered}} many deaths, much maltreatment, robbery and violence, taking advantage of their labor and their lands, without order or moderation.... A {{large part of the}} population disappeared, as much from the excessive tribute and maltreatment as from the diseases and smallpox, so that in this time the population is considerably less, especially in the hot lands.|$|E
25|$|Don Luis de Noroña (or Noronha), captain {{general of}} Ceuta, witness the {{incredible}} battle {{and that he}} had given the squad a signal service and to warn of the approximation of their enemies, reacted immediately, sending a brig with gunpowder and bullets tow, bandages for the wounded, a surgeon and some food. In the attached message cavalierly congratulated the squad leader saying he did not know <b>that</b> <b>Don</b> Fadrique was at this place (but) it did not think could be another who so bravely and with so few ships had disrupted so many. The Dutch fleet was no longer a danger to anyone.|$|E
25|$|In August 1572, Pedro Menéndez de Aviles {{arrived from}} Florida with thirty {{soldiers}} and sailors to take revenge for the massacre. Initially, Menéndez de Avilés believed <b>that</b> <b>Don</b> Luís' uncle {{was responsible for the}} killings. He lured several natives aboard his ship with gifts and used them as hostages. From them, Menéndez de Avilés learned of Alonso de Olmos' survival and was able to secure the boy's return. After gaining a fuller picture of the massacre from Olmos, Menéndez de Avilés attempted to use other natives as hostages to bargain for the hand-over of Don Luís. Don Luís did not turn himself over to the Spanish.|$|E

25|$|He is a harsh taskmaster, likes {{being the}} boss, {{and is not}} very forgiving. One of his former {{tactical}} trainees from Quantico, Liz Warner has proclaimed to this and, after Colby confided in her {{that he made a}} mistake, she told him that the very fact that he still remains on Don's team means something. She also said <b>that</b> <b>Don</b> never spoke of his personal life while at the FBI Academy and was at the time fresh from the field in hunting fugitives (with friend Agent Cooper). Liz knows he has mellowed with age and he can hold a commitment with a woman for longer periods of time.|$|E
25|$|The Prince {{takes his}} time {{dressing}} for {{his meeting with}} Don Calogero, and when he finally goes downstairs, he has {{a vision of the}} two of them as animals. Their conversation is, for the most part, polite, with both men making occasional slips into tactlessness but both ultimately making the truths of the situation quite apparent. For the Prince, that truth involves Tancredi's excellent lineage but extreme poverty, while for Calogero the truth involves his wealth, which is much greater than the Prince ever realized, and the fact <b>that</b> <b>Don</b> Calogero is in final negotiations to purchase the title of Baroness for his daughter. An agreement is reached that the marriage is to proceed.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1950s Tejada got firmly engaged in {{mainstream}} Carlism and demonstrated an uncompromising political stand. He lambasted the dissenting Carloctavistas, complained to Fal about permissive, increasingly Christian-Democratic {{profile of a}} semi-official Carlist daily Informaciones, and advocated <b>that</b> <b>Don</b> Javier goes bold by terminating the long overdue regency. He co-drafted Declaración de Barcelona, the statement which was issued by Don Javier in 1952 and which indeed announced his own claim to the Carlist throne, though the episode is not entirely clear. With the 1954 publication of La monarquía tradicional Tejada became the top Carlist theorist; the same year within the party top body, Junta Nacional, he formed part of Comisión de Cultura y Propaganda. At that time he was considered among key politicians of Carlism.|$|E
50|$|The Court {{decided that}} the Florida court lacked {{jurisdiction}} based on the minimum contacts test that had developed {{over the course of}} several decades of Supreme Court Jurisprudence. The trust company had no substantial business with Florida and no offices in Florida. The only contact with Florida was the fact <b>that</b> <b>Donner</b> moved there, which was ruled insufficient to support jurisdiction.|$|R

5|$|Cynics {{were often}} {{recognized}} {{in the ancient world}} by their apparel - an old cloak and a staff. The cloak came as an allusion to Socrates and his manner of dress, while the staff was to the club of Heracles. These items became so symbolic of the Cynic vocation that ancient writers accosted those who thought <b>that</b> <b>donning</b> the Cynic garb would make them suited to the philosophy.|$|R
25|$|Already in the 1910s Rodezno timidly {{advanced}} {{the idea of}} transferring legitimist rights to an appropriate Alfonsist candidate once the Carlist dynasty would extinguish; also during the Republican years {{he was the most}} enthusiastic supporter of rapprochement within the monarchist camp and in 1935 proposed <b>that</b> <b>Don</b> Alfonso Carlos names Don Juan his legitimate heir. When the last direct Carlist claimant indeed died in September 1936 Rodezno was the last to acknowledge the regency of Don Javier. At that time he was already considering another regency, this of Franco on behalf of Don Juan, whom he held well familiar with Traditionalist ideas. It is not clear when the two first met; during the Civil War Rodezno and the Alfonsist prince already exchanged friendly correspondence.|$|E
25|$|The film opens {{five years}} after the ending of the first film, with Don (Shah Rukh Khan) narrating the story. The European drug cartel bosses meet in the French Riviera to discuss a new threat {{emerging}} from Asia: Don is jeopardising their business by undercutting their prices, and the bosses decree <b>that</b> <b>Don</b> must die. Living in Thailand for the last five years, he goes to a remote settlement to pick up a shipment of cocaine. Instead of the expected uneventful transaction, Don fights his way out. He returns to Malaysia, surrendering to Roma (Priyanka Chopra), who has joined Interpol, and Inspector Malik (Om Puri). Don is sentenced to death and sent to prison, where he meets old rival Vardhan (Boman Irani). He offers Vardhan a partnership, and they escape from prison after poisoning the other inmates.|$|E
25|$|Actual {{position}} of Don Javier versus changes being introduced {{by his son}} remains highly unclear and subject to conflicting accounts, most pursued by highly partisan historians. Some claim that from the onset he nurtured democratic sentiments and was uneasy about ultra-reactionary deviation of Carlism. They maintain <b>that</b> <b>Don</b> Javier was fully aware and entirely supportive of transformation triggered by Carlos Hugo, intended as renovation of genuine Carlist thought and as shaking the Traditionalist distortions off. Another group of students claims that aging Don Javier, {{at that time in}} his late 70s, was increasingly detached from Spanish issues; reportedly unaware of political course sponsored by Carlos Hugo, he was perhaps manipulated – and at later stages incapacitated - by his son and three daughters, who intercepted all incoming correspondence and re-edited the outgoing one. Finally, one more group of scholars refrains from conclusions and limit themselves to referring letters, declarations and statements.|$|E
50|$|While {{initially}} praised as {{a compelling}} account of Yanomami culture, in 1983 controversy broke out when {{an article in}} American Anthropologist accused the book of not being based on original ethnographic work, but instead being a patchwork made of previously published ethnographic accounts. Rebecca De Holmes, {{the author of the}} critique, stated that it was unlikely <b>that</b> <b>Donner</b> had spent any amount of time among the Yanomami. Particularly she criticized Donner for having plagiarized the biographical account of the Brazilian woman Helena Valero, who grew up as a captive among the Yanomami, without acknowledging having borrowed large parts of her life-story. Another critical review, by Dr. Debra Picchi, argues that the book was invalid as social science because of the authors auto-biographical focus on her personal development and experience, rather than on describing the Yanomami people. One critic suspected <b>that</b> <b>Donner</b> might have worked from the many ethnographic movies about the Yanomami and argued that in that case her book could be considered an interpretive study of the visual documentary data.|$|R
