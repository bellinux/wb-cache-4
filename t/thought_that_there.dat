5|$|As {{early as}} 1870, chemists <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{should be an}} alkali metal beyond caesium, with an atomic number of 87. It was then {{referred}} to by the provisional name eka-caesium. Research teams attempted to locate and isolate this missing element, and at least four false claims were made that the element had been found before an authentic discovery was made.|$|E
5|$|During July 1914, Australia {{and other}} {{units of the}} RAN fleet were on a {{training}} cruise in Queensland waters. On 27 July, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board learned through press telegrams that the British Admiralty <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> would be imminent and widespread war in Europe following the July Crisis, and had begun to position its fleets as a precaution. Three days later, the Board learned that the official warning telegram had been sent: at 22:30, Australia was recalled to Sydney to take on coal and stores.|$|E

5|$|There {{was another}} {{pollution}} incident in March 2008 when twenty {{miles of the}} river turned orange. Iron oxide from old mine workings near the source at Irwell Springs had polluted the water since 1969 and in 1997 a Coal Authority survey identified the stretch as having the fourth worst case of minewater pollution in the country. A treatment plant was built in 1999 to remove the pollution {{at a cost of}} £1M; however, it is <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a collapse in the mine after heavy rains in the spring of 2008. Although the water was stained with ochre, no damage to wildlife was reported.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{not widely}} cultivated, Alloxylon flammeum {{has proven to be}} by far the most hardy and {{adaptable}} (as well as the showiest) member of the genus Alloxylon, and has been grown successfully in as cool a climate as Victoria. It does best in a well-drained soil rich in organic material but low in phosphorus with some shelter when young. Applying mulch to the soil around the plant and extra water in dry spells is beneficial. Fertilisers high in phosphorus content can damage the plant, though fertilisers specifically for Australian native plants can be used. Yellowing of new leaves may indicate chlorosis from iron deficiency and can be remedied with iron chelate or iron sulphate. Its flowers attract birds to gardens. A large tree grows in the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney. It is <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are more plants in cultivation than there are in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Joe Mayer {{was fired}} in 1937. He {{attributed}} this to the hatred of women {{on the part of}} the dean of physical sciences, which he thought was provoked by Goeppert Mayer's presence in the laboratory. Herzfeld agreed and added that, with Goeppert Mayer, Franck and Herzfeld all at Johns Hopkins, some <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were too many German scientists there. There were also complaints from some students that Mayer's chemistry lectures contained too much modern physics. Mayer took up a position at Columbia University, where the chairman of the Physics Department, George B. Pegram, arranged for Goeppert Mayer to have an office, but she received no salary. She soon made good friends with Harold Urey and Enrico Fermi, who arrived at Columbia in 1939. Fermi asked her to investigate the valence shell of the undiscovered transuranic elements. Using the Thomas–Fermi model, she predicted that they would form a new series similar to the rare earth elements. This proved to be correct.|$|E

5|$|The New Guinea {{crocodile}} {{was first}} {{described by the}} American herpetologist Karl Patterson Schmidt in 1928 as Crocodylus novaeguineae. At one time it was <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were two subspecies, C. n. novaeguineae, the New Guinea crocodile native to Papua New Guinea and Western New Guinea, and C. n. mindorensis, the Philippine crocodile, native to several islands including Busuanga, Luzon, Masbate, Mindoro, Negros, Samar and Mindanao. Most authorities now consider that the Philippine crocodile is an entirely separate species. DNA sequencing data reported in 2011 showed that the Philippine crocodile is, in part, paraphyletic {{with regard to the}} New Guinea crocodile, and that the latter may constitutes a population within the Philippine crocodile. Among their two samples for the New Guinea crocodile, one was part of the Philippine crocodile clade and the other was separate, estimated to have diverged 2.6–6.8 million years ago. Both samples were taken from captives (could potentially be misidentified or hybrids) and the result should therefore be treated with caution.|$|E
5|$|Season five {{features}} Monica and Chandler {{trying to}} keep their new relationship a secret from their friends. Phoebe gives birth to triplets in the show's 100th episode. She gives birth to a boy, Frank Jr. Jr., and two girls: Leslie and Chandler. (They had originally <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were two boys and one girl, but decided to keep the name Chandler, despite the baby turning out a girl.) Emily states that the only condition in which she would remain married to Ross is if he stops all communication with Rachel. Ross agrees, but during a last dinner with all six main characters together, Emily phones Ross and, upon discovering Rachel is there, realizes she does not trust him, which ends the marriage. Phoebe begins {{a relationship with a}} police officer, Gary (Michael Rapaport), after finding his badge and using it as her own. Monica and Chandler go public with their relationship, to the surprise and happiness of their friends. They decide to get married on a trip to Las Vegas, but change their plans after witnessing Ross and Rachel drunkenly stumble out of the wedding chapel.|$|E

25|$|One {{negative}} {{criticism of}} the novel was made by a reviewer who <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was an assumption that {{the course of history}} would have gone pretty much as it did with Native Americans here, and felt that this underestimates the impact of Native Americans on our history.|$|E

25|$|Aristotle contrasted rule by {{the many}} (democracy/polity), with rule by the few (oligarchy/aristocracy), and with rule by a single person (tyranny or today autocracy/absolute monarchy). He also <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a good and a bad variant of each system (he {{considered}} democracy to be the degenerate counterpart to polity).|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{presence}} of hot springs, it is <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> must have been a thermal bath complex already in the Hellenistic period, but probably at a smaller scale than the later Roman site.

25|$|Following François Hollande's {{victory in}} the 2012 presidential election, it is <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> may be a partial nuclear phaseout in France.

25|$|While enthusiasts {{still believe}} the mystery can be solved, {{scholarly}} attempts at decipherment {{are thought to}} be unlikely to succeed unless more examples of the signs turn up somewhere, as it is generally <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is not enough context available for meaningful analysis.

25|$|For example, in the Latane et al. {{clapping}} {{and shouting}} study, {{people who were}} alone but told that {{they were part of}} a group screaming or clapping could have <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a set level of noise that experimenters were looking for, and so assumed they could work less hard to achieve this level depending on the size of the group.|$|E
25|$|Space {{agencies}} {{have already had}} experience with returning samples {{thought to be a}} back contamination risk during the Apollo era, when samples were returned for the first time by Apollo 11.

The regulations used then have been rescinded, and new regulations would be needed. A different approach would be needed for a modern sample return.|$|E

Yet even then she could not help but note the wondrous strength and agility of this great beast, and as he approached she even found herself admiring the sheen of his heavy, black, silvershot coat.|$|R
50|$|The Astley family {{held the}} manor from the 12th century. It is not <b>thought</b> likely <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{was ever a}} true 'castle' at Astley. Although a licence to crenellate the manor house there was granted in 1266, the {{property}} was only ever a fortified house.|$|R
