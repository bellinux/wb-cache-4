5|$|Contrary to <b>the</b> <b>fears</b> of many fans, the Glazers {{took action}} {{to ensure that}} Gill and veteran manager Sir Alex Ferguson {{remained}} at Manchester United, citing the duo's success with the club. In 2006, Malcolm Glazer's other two sons, Kevin and Edward, and his daughter, Darcie, were appointed to the Manchester United board as non-executive directors.|$|E
5|$|Experience {{from the}} few cities where {{congestion}} pricing has been implemented shows that {{social and political}} acceptability is key. Public discontent with congestion pricing, or rejection of congestion pricing proposals, is due mainly to the inequality issues, the economic burden on neighboring communities, the effect on retail businesses and the economic activity in general, and <b>the</b> <b>fears</b> that the revenues will become just another tax.|$|E
5|$|In early 2001, the Workshop {{conducted}} a summative study {{about the effects}} of war, natural disasters, and other events on young children. It demonstrated that little was being done to address <b>the</b> <b>fears</b> and concerns of victims of traumatic events. As a result, the Workshop developed a series of materials it believed would help children (and their families) cope with events such as the September 11 terrorist attacks and Hurricane Katrina.|$|E
50|$|Lesson 2 Self-Confidence {{will help}} you master <b>the</b> six basic <b>fears</b> with which every person is cursed: <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of Poverty, <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of Ill Health, <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of Old Age, <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of Criticism, <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of Loss of Love of Someone, and <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of Death. It will teach you the {{difference}} between egotism and real self-confidence which is based upon definite, usable knowledge.|$|R
5000|$|Several space-related phobias {{have been}} identified, {{including}} agoraphobia (<b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of open spaces), [...] (<b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of celestial space) and claustrophobia (<b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of enclosed spaces).|$|R
50|$|Some {{possible}} explanations of gephyrophobia may be <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of driving off <b>the</b> bridge, <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of {{a gust of}} wind taking one off <b>the</b> bridge, a <b>fear</b> of <b>the</b> structural integrity of the bridges itself, or <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> that <b>the</b> bridge will collapse if they try to cross it. <b>The</b> <b>fear</b> overlaps with acrophobia, <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of heights, as gephyrophobia tends to be exacerbated in tall bridges vs. ones close to the water/ground beneath.|$|R
5|$|Nuaym {{then came}} up with an {{efficient}} stratagem. He first went to the Banu Qurayza and warned them about the intentions {{of the rest of the}} Confederacy. If the siege fails, he said, the Confederacy will not be afraid to abandon the Jews, leaving them at the mercy of Muhammad. The Qurayza should thus demand Confederate leaders as hostages in return for cooperation. This advice touched upon <b>the</b> <b>fears</b> the Qurayza had already harboured.|$|E
5|$|Severe acute {{respiratory}} syndrome (SARS) {{is caused}} by a new type of coronavirus. Other coronaviruses were known to cause mild infections in humans, so the virulence and rapid spread of this novel virus strain caused alarm among health professionals as well as public fear. <b>The</b> <b>fears</b> of a major pandemic were not realised, and by July 2003, after causing around 8,000 cases and 800 deaths, the outbreak had ended. The exact origin of the SARS virus is not known, but evidence suggests that it came from bats.|$|E
5|$|St Vincent's gaze {{passed over}} {{every aspect of}} the Navy from the Sea Fencibles to the Navy Hospitals. The earl {{attempted}} to disband the Sea Fencibles claiming that they were needed only to quiet <b>the</b> <b>fears</b> of little old ladies and that good men passed their whole careers without hearing a shot fired. Doctor Baird, St Vincent's personal physician, was appointed to the Sick and Hurt Board as Inspector of all Hospitals.|$|E
50|$|It {{seeks to}} create the {{situation}} in which all our people shall be free from <b>fear,</b> including <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of <b>the</b> oppression of one national group by another, <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of <b>the</b> disempowerment of one social echelon by another, <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of <b>the</b> use of state power to deny anybody their fundamental human rights and <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of tyranny.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} deals with <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of {{appearing}} incompetent as delineated by White, Goffman and Adler. <b>The</b> <b>fear</b> of appearing incompetent is {{an aspect of}} competence that may threaten self-esteem. <b>The</b> <b>fear</b> of appearing incompetent can purportedly be measured by <b>the</b> <b>Fear</b> of Appearing Incompetent Scale (FAIS). It was found that <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of appearing incompetent correlated positively with self-estimated IQ, but correlated negatively with obtained IQ. <b>The</b> <b>fear</b> of appearing incompetent had no significant relationship to GPA. <b>The</b> <b>fear</b> of appearing incompetent in participants who over-estimated their IQs {{did not differ significantly}} from <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of appearing incompetent in participants who under-estimated their IQs. There was also {{no significant difference between the}} mean self-estimated IQ and the mean obtained IQ. Out of a total of 68 participants 44 % accurately estimated their IQs, 22 % over-estimated their IQs and 34 % under-estimated their IQs...|$|R
5000|$|The Jonah {{complex is}} <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of success which {{prevents}} self-actualization, or {{the realization of}} one's potential. It is <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of one's own greatness, the evasion of one's destiny, or the avoidance of exercising one's talents. As <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of achieving a personal worst may serve to motivate personal growth, likewise <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of achieving a personal best may hinder achievement.|$|R
5|$|The Virginia General Assembly {{voted in}} February 1846 {{to accept the}} return of Alexandria and on July 9, 1846, Congress agreed to return all the {{territory}} that had been ceded by Virginia. Therefore, the District's current area consists only of the portion originally donated by Maryland. Confirming <b>the</b> <b>fears</b> of pro-slavery Alexandrians, the Compromise of 1850 outlawed the slave trade in the District, although not slavery itself.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>fears</b> of {{terrorism}} received an extra boost from {{the disruption of}} communications and news as facilities were devoured by the fire. The General Letter Office in Threadneedle Street burned down early on Monday morning, through which post passed for the entire country. The London Gazette just managed to put out its Monday issue before the printer's premises went up in flames. The whole nation depended on these communications, and the void which they left filled up with rumours.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{of a new}} four-lane {{bridge across}} the Raritan River (now the John A. Lynch Memorial Bridge) began in the 1960s, but in 1970, when the {{environment}} impact laws came out, construction froze with only three massive piers standing out of the river. Outside of the bridge, there was significant controversy over the abandoned Delaware and Raritan Canal heading through New Brunswick. The new freeway was to supplant the former canal and its thirteenth lock in New Brunswick, abandoned in 1932. The environmentalists and the historic preservationists opposed the freeway extension because of <b>the</b> <b>fears</b> of losing the canal, while companies like Johnson & Johnson supported the new highway for redeveloping New Brunswick.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Fear</b> Factor Malaysia is {{back for}} the second time after six years of disappearance. <b>The</b> <b>Fear</b> Factor Selebriti Malaysia was hosted by actor, Aaron Aziz. <b>The</b> <b>Fear</b> Factor Selebriti Malaysia was won by team Dazrin & Hairul.|$|R
60|$|Solomon {{does not}} say, To {{understand}} <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of <b>the</b> Lord {{is the beginning}} of wisdom, but simply <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of <b>the</b> Lord {{is the beginning of}} it. But the end of wisdom, he says, is not merely to <b>fear</b> <b>the</b> Lord, but to understand <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of <b>the</b> Lord.|$|R
60|$|Answ. Fear, as I have showed you, may {{be taken}} several ways. 1. It {{may be taken}} for <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of devils. 2. It may be taken for <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of reprobates. 3. It may be taken for <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> that is wrought in the godly by the Spirit as a spirit of bondage; or, 4. It may be taken for <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> that I have been but now discoursing of.|$|R
5|$|Cousse's message {{confirmed}} <b>the</b> <b>fears</b> of Faisal's cabinet that Gouraud {{was intent}} on taking over Syria by force. The cabinet subsequently rejected Gouraud's ultimatum and issued a largely symbolic appeal {{to the international community}} to end the French advance. On 23 July, Al-'Azma set out from Damascus with his motley force of army regulars and volunteers, which was divided into northern, central and southern columns each headed by camel cavalry units. French forces launched their offensive towards Khan Maysalun and Wadi al-Qarn shortly after dawn on 24 July, at 5:00, while Syrian forces were waiting at their positions overlooking the low end of Wadi al-Qarn.|$|E
5|$|In 1787, 1789, and 1790, Dissenters again {{tried to}} repeal the Test and Corporation Acts. Although {{initially}} {{it looked as if}} they might succeed, by 1790, with <b>the</b> <b>fears</b> of revolution looming in Parliament, few were swayed by appeals to equal rights. Political cartoons, {{one of the most effective}} and popular media of the time, skewered the Dissenters and Priestley. In Parliament, William Pitt and Edmund Burke argued against the repeal, a betrayal that angered Priestley and his friends, who had expected the two men's support. Priestley wrote a series of Letters to William Pitt and Letters to Burke in an attempt to persuade them otherwise, but these publications only further inflamed the populace against him.|$|E
5|$|In August 1870, Seward {{embarked}} on another trip, this time westbound around the world. With him was Olive Risley, {{daughter of a}} Treasury Department official, to whom he became close in his final year in Washington. They visited Japan, then China, where they walked on the Great Wall. During the trip, they decided that Seward would adopt Olive, and he did so, thus {{putting an end to}} gossip and <b>the</b> <b>fears</b> of his sons that Seward would remarry late in life. They spent three months in India, then journeyed through the Middle East and Europe, not returning to Auburn until October 1871.|$|E
50|$|Pulp {{novels in}} the 1950s were mass-produced to {{specifically}} {{cash in on}} <b>the</b> growing <b>fear</b> of youth that was spreading throughout society. Ironically, {{it has also been}} said that popular media's effects on young people are not as powerful as <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of youth, which drives <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of technology and in turn perpetuates <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of youth.|$|R
50|$|Some sufferers of genophobia {{may develop}} <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> {{as a result}} of preexisting fears. Some people may have nosophobia: <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of {{contracting}} a disease or virus. They may also have gymnophobia: <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of nudity. Others may have extreme fear of being touched. These issues, along with stress disorders, can manifest themselves as <b>the</b> innate <b>fear</b> of sex.|$|R
25|$|Globophobia {{has been}} used to refer to <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of globalization, though it can also mean <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of balloons.|$|R
5|$|Le souper de Beaucaire was a {{political}} pamphlet written by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1793. With the French Revolution into its fourth year, civil war had spread across France between various rival political factions. Napoleon was involved in military action, on the government's side, against some rebellious cities of southern France. It was during these events, in 1793, that he spoke with four merchants from the Midi and heard their views. As a loyal soldier of the Republic he responded in turn, set on dispelling <b>the</b> <b>fears</b> of the merchants and discouraging their beliefs. He later wrote about his conversation {{in the form of}} a pamphlet, calling for an end to the civil war.|$|E
5|$|Order in {{the streets}} broke down as rumours arose of {{suspicious}} foreigners setting fires. <b>The</b> <b>fears</b> of the homeless focused on the French and Dutch, England's enemies in the ongoing Second Anglo-Dutch War; these substantial immigrant groups became victims of lynchings and street violence. On Tuesday, the fire spread {{over most of the}} City, destroying St Paul's Cathedral and leaping the River Fleet to threaten Charles II's court at Whitehall, while coordinated firefighting efforts were simultaneously mobilising. The battle to quench the fire is considered to have been won by two factors: the strong east winds died down, and the Tower of London garrison used gunpowder to create effective firebreaks to halt further spread eastward.|$|E
5|$|Postwar {{social unrest}} was {{also related to}} the {{difficulties}} of absorbing the veterans {{from the war in}} the job market. Competition among groups for work heightened tensions. In the 1920s there was growing anti-Semitism in the United States related to economic competition and <b>the</b> <b>fears</b> of social change from decades of changed immigration, a lingering anti-German sentiment left over from World War I, and anti-black violence erupted in numerous locations as well. In this period African Americans were leaving the South by the tens of thousands, to escape oppressive social conditions and find work in the North and Midwestern industrial cities, in what came to be called the Great Migration.|$|E
50|$|In 2007 {{the band}} {{released}} a split EP with Environmental Youth Crunch, and a full-length <b>The</b> <b>Fear,</b> <b>The</b> <b>Fear,</b> <b>The</b> <b>Fear</b> on No Idea. Theo moved the Athens, Georgia, while the band continued to practice, tour and write together, and they toured Australia {{for the first}} time.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the name}} of the album (which is derived from a line in track five, [...] "Eureka!") and many of the track titles indicate, the major lyrical theme of <b>The</b> <b>Fear,</b> <b>The</b> <b>Fear,</b> <b>The</b> <b>Fear</b> is fear. Other major themes include anxiety, worry, isolation, monotony, and acceptance.|$|R
50|$|There is a {{fear that}} is unlike all other fears. It has a special, clammy chill, a deadly gift for inspiring deeper, darker dread. It is <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of unentered rooms, of bends in lonely roads. It is <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of <b>the</b> phone call {{in the middle of}} the night, of the {{stranger}} you recognize, perhaps from a nightmare. It is <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of <b>the</b> unexpected, the unfamiliar. It is <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of... <b>THE</b> UNKNOWN.|$|R
5|$|Several {{species have}} been reintroduced to the gorge. White-tailed deer were {{imported}} from Michigan and released throughout Pennsylvania to reestablish {{what had once been}} a thriving population. The current population of deer in Pennsylvania are descended from the original stock introduced beginning in 1906, after the lumberman had moved out of the area. The deer population has grown so much that today they exceed their carrying capacity in many areas. River otters were successfully reintroduced in 1983 and now breed in the gorge. Despite <b>the</b> <b>fears</b> of anglers, their diet is only 5percent trout.|$|E
5|$|The delegates couldn't {{agree on}} whether the {{executive}} should be a single person, or a board of three. Many wished to limit {{the power of the}} executive and thus supported the proposal to divide the executive power between three persons. The possible problems of this system, in addition to the knowledge that George Washington would probably be the first president, calmed <b>the</b> <b>fears</b> enough so that the proponents of a singular executive could accumulate a large coalition. This issue came up occasionally after the matter was settled, but was never again seriously doubted.|$|E
5|$|A {{worldwide}} backlash {{over the}} resulting destruction, and <b>the</b> <b>fears</b> Wanda's hallucinations incited, send the team into hiding {{at a safe}} house. Thor departs to consult with Dr. Erik Selvig {{on the meaning of}} the apocalyptic future he saw in his hallucination, while Romanoff and Banner plan to flee together after realizing a mutual attraction. However, Nick Fury arrives and encourages the team to form a plan to stop Ultron. In Seoul, Ultron forces the team's friend Dr. Helen Cho to use her synthetic-tissue technology, together with vibranium and the scepter's gem, to perfect a new body for him. As Ultron uploads himself into the body, Wanda is able to read his mind; discovering his plan for human extinction, the Maximoffs turn against Ultron. Rogers, Romanoff, and Barton find Ultron and retrieve the synthetic body, but Ultron captures Romanoff.|$|E
50|$|Other {{conditions}} of fear or aversion associated with age groups {{have their own}} names, particularly: paedophobia, <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of infants and children; ephebiphobia, <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of youth, sometimes {{also referred to as}} an irrational fear of adolescents or a prejudice against teenagers; and gerontophobia, <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of elderly people.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>fear</b> {{of falling}} (FOF), also {{referred}} to as basophobia (or basiphobia), is a natural fear and is typical of most humans and mammals, in varying degrees of extremity. It differs from acrophobia (<b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of heights), although <b>the</b> two <b>fears</b> are closely related. <b>The</b> <b>fear</b> of falling encompasses the anxieties accompanying the sensation and the possibly dangerous effects of falling, as opposed to the heights themselves. Those who have little fear of falling may be said to have a head for heights. Basophobia is sometimes associated with astasia-abasia, <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of walking/standing erect.|$|R
50|$|During <b>the</b> <b>Fear</b> Itself storyline, Vermin attacks Spider-Man, who is {{struggling}} to deal with <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> and chaos that is gripping Manhattan.|$|R
