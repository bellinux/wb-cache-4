Histopathological examinations revealed caseous necrosis, epithelioid cell granuloma, and multinucleated Langhans' giant cells, but no neoplastic cell was found.

40|$|In the {{preliminary}} papers (1 ? 4), clinical and pathohistological findings were reported on tuberculous guinea-pigs {{treated with a}} combination of antituberculous drugs and tuberculin.

In curatve effect, however, the treatment with streptomycin plus tuberculin surpassed that of INAH plus tuberculin. 2) The fact that, the antituberculous drugs showed an increased curative effect on tuberculosis, administered in combination with tuberculin, may be attributed, first, to the enrichment and localization of the drugs in <b>tuberculous</b> <b>lesion,</b> owing to the focal reaction to tuberculin, and, second, to the desensitizing effect of tuberculin which intensifies resistance in tuberculous animals...|$|E

Under local anaesthesia, affected lumbar discs were curetted using a procedure of percutaneous nucleotomy, and in-tube and the out-tube were placed for continuous irrigation. The period of continuous irrigation was 12 – 16 days. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was demonstrated in case 1 by culture and PCR, whereas histology showed <b>tuberculous</b> <b>lesion</b> with caseous necrosis in both cases. Postoperative MRI showed markedly reduced abscesses after 3 months in both cases. The signal intensity in vertebral bodies was improved.
