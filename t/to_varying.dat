5|$|Brahmousin cattle are {{a hybrid}} {{purebred}} breed of Brahman and Limousin first {{created in the}} USA in the late 1970s. The goal was to blend {{the best of the}} Limousin and Brahman traits to create a breed that has reproductive efficiency, mothering ability, good muscling and growth traits, and is adaptable <b>to</b> <b>varying</b> environmental conditions. Brahmousin are now bred in the USA, Indonesia, El Salvador and Australia.|$|E

Because family life stresses in-group benefits, preferences, and successes over {{those of the}} individual, collectivist societies tend to use more family symbols in advertising than individualist societies. For example, Korea, which is reputably collectivistic, has more success with family advertisements than the United States, which is reputably individualistic.|$|E

5|$|First-person {{shooters}} may be structurally {{composed of}} levels, {{or use the}} technique of a continuous narrative in which the game never leaves the first-person perspective. Others feature large sandbox environments, which are not divided into levels and can be explored freely. In first-person shooters, protagonists interact with the environment <b>to</b> <b>varying</b> degrees, from basics such as using doors, to problem solving puzzles based {{on a variety of}} interactive objects. In some games, the player can damage the environment, also <b>to</b> <b>varying</b> degrees: one common device is the use of barrels containing explosive material which the player can shoot, destroying them and harming nearby enemies. Other games feature environments which are extensively destructible, allowing for additional visual effects. The game world will often make use of science fiction, historic (particularly World War II) or modern military themes, with such antagonists as aliens, monsters, terrorists and soldiers of various types. Games feature multiple difficulty settings; in harder modes, enemies are tougher, more aggressive and do more damage, and power-ups are limited. In easier modes, the player can succeed through reaction times alone; on more difficult settings, it is often necessary to memorize the levels through trial and error.|$|E

When testing for its less intense form (fixed solar urticaria), phototesting should be conducted only in the areas where the hives have appeared to avoid the possibility of getting false-negative results.|$|E
5|$|Due to its graphic content, {{there are}} several {{different}} versions of Cannibal Holocaust in circulation which are edited <b>to</b> <b>varying</b> degrees. In the UK, the film was originally released on VHS by Go Video in 1982 with approximately six minutes of cuts. These cuts were self-imposed by the distributor, possibly due to technical limitations of the tape. In 2001, the film was passed for release on DVD by the BBFC with 5 minutes and 44 seconds of cuts to remove scenes of animal cruelty and sexual violence; all but 15 seconds of these cuts were waived for a re-release in 2011. The latter release also includes a new edit sponsored by Deodato which reduces the violence toward animals.|$|E
