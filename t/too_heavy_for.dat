5|$|Admiral Capelle, {{the deputy}} {{director}} of the Reichsmarineamt, stated that by mid November 1906, the testing for the underwater protection designs would be complete. He suggested that if the torpedo bulkhead needed to be strengthened, the ship might be <b>too</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>for</b> the 28cm(11in) guns, if the displacement of around 19,000t(21,000short tons) was to be retained. Tirpitz refused to consider using smaller guns, even if it meant increasing the displacement of the ship. Von Eickstedt proposed employing a secondary battery of 17cm(6.7in) guns instead of the 15cm(5.9in) the design called for, but the increased weight would have made it impossible to mount eight main battery guns.|$|E
5|$|By 1857, {{both the}} Royal Mint {{and the public}} were {{dissatisfied}} {{by the state of}} the copper coinage. Much of it was worn or defaced by advertisements, and 14 percent of the pennies in commerce were Boulton's 1797 cartwheels. The fact that pennies of different specifications circulated side by side precluded the weighing of quantities of copper coin to ascertain the value. Both sorts of pennies were deemed <b>too</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>for</b> daily use. The copper coins were so heavy that Charles Dickens in Nicholas Nickleby had Mr Mantalini contemplate suicide by drowning himself in the Thames, his pockets filled with halfpennies.|$|E

5|$|Artillery {{powered by}} {{gunpowder}} {{was introduced to}} Europe in the 1320s and spread quickly. Handguns, which were initially unpredictable and inaccurate weapons, were not recorded until the 1380s. Castles were adapted to allow small artillery pieces– averaging between – to fire from towers. These guns were <b>too</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>for</b> a man to carry and fire, but if he supported the butt end and rested the muzzle {{on the edge of}} the gun port he could fire the weapon. The gun ports developed in this period show a unique feature, that of a horizontal timber across the opening. A hook on the end of the gun could be latched over the timber so the gunner did not have to take the full recoil of the weapon. This adaptation is found across Europe, and although the timber rarely survives, there is an intact example at Castle Doornenburg in the Netherlands. Gunports were keyhole shaped, with a circular hole at the bottom for the weapon and a narrow slit on top to allow the gunner to aim.|$|E
5|$|In Germany, Walther Bothe and {{his student}} Herbert Becker had used {{polonium}} to bombard beryllium with alpha particles, producing an unusual form of radiation. Chadwick had his Australian 1851 Exhibition scholar, Hugh Webster, duplicate their results. To Chadwick, this {{was evidence of}} something that he and Rutherford had been hypothesising for years: the neutron, a theoretical nuclear particle with no electric charge. Then in January 1932, Feather drew Chadwick's attention to another surprising result. Frédéric and Irène Joliot-Curie had succeeded in knocking protons from paraffin wax using polonium and beryllium {{as a source for}} what they thought was gamma radiation. Rutherford and Chadwick disagreed; protons were <b>too</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>for</b> that. But neutrons would need only a small amount of energy to achieve the same effect. In Rome, Ettore Majorana came to the same conclusion: the Joliot-Curies had discovered the neutron but did not know it.|$|E

In Willow's dorm she frantically knocks on doors which no one will open; The Gentlemen steadily pursue her. Willow hears Tara's panicked knocking down the hall and exits her room as Tara sprints into her, sending them both tumbling. They lock themselves into a laundry room and try to barricade the door with a vending machine, but it is <b>too</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>for</b> them to move. Willow, injured, sits and concentrates on moving the machine with telekinesis; she fails, but Tara sees what she is doing. They clasp hands and the machine moves swiftly across the room, blocking the door.|$|E

5|$|Abra uses various extrasensory powers, {{even when}} sleeping. With {{the ability to}} read minds, they can sense danger, teleporting when it does and can do so quickly enough to create visual doubles. Using self-hypnosis, Abra spends 18 hours a day sleeping, unable to utilize its telekinesis unless rested. This {{behavior}} ceases once it evolves into Kadabra, a strong psychic that emits alpha waves affected by its current mental state. These waves can trigger headaches in nearby people and can cause machines to malfunction. Once it evolves into Alakazam, it has mastered every type and form of psychic ability, and its brain continually grows. This causes its head to become <b>too</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>for</b> its neck, requiring telekinesis to hold it upright. Able to remember everything that it has experienced since hatching as an Abra, Alakazam has an IQ that exceeds 5,000 and can outperform a supercomputer. Both Kadabra and Alakazam utilize spoons generated mentally to enhance their abilities, two for the latter, and can increase them further by closing their eyes. Upon Mega Evolving, Mega Alakazam's mental abilities become even more pronounced due to it manifesting an organ on its forehead that emits psychic power. It also manifests three additional spoons alongside the two it possessed as Alakazam. Kadabra and Alakazam can engage in precognition, while all three Pokémon in the evolution line are capable of creating spaces where battle factors are affected.|$|E
5|$|On 23 August a {{reconnaissance}} patrol from the 1st Battalion, Royal Ulster Rifles crossed the River Touques by boat, but German {{resistance in the}} area was <b>too</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>for</b> the battalion to cross. Instead they moved upriver, intending to cross at Bonnerville sur Touques. Intelligence reported that the railway embankment on the river was held in force by the Germans, and this put attempts to cross the river there on hold. Elsewhere the 2nd Battalion, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry reached the river. Major John Howard and his D Company swam across and established the battalion's bridgehead. With local French assistance {{and a collection of}} small boats and rafts, the rest of the battalion were also able to cross the river, entering Touques on 24August. The next day they liberated Saint Philibert, La Correspondence and Petiville, and reached Malhortie where the Germans were still defending the bridge and high ground. At 13:00, the battalion assaulted and captured the bridge intact, but German resistance prevented them from proceeding any further. On 26August the advance continued, and at 19:00 Foulbec was liberated. Circumstances had divided the 6th Airlanding Brigade's forces, and they were now advancing along two routes, with the Belgian and Dutch brigades along the coast and the airlanding battalions further inland. The 6th Airlanding Brigade battalions headed towards Honfleur and Berville sur Mer, meeting slight German opposition, while the Belgians occupied the area around Berville and Foulbec.|$|E
5|$|A third ship, the Manantico also {{crashed into}} shore {{due to a}} {{combination}} of the storm and human error in which the captain confused Cape Henry with Cape Charles after spotting another schooner. The Manantico was also where the two deaths associated with the storm occurred. The first was when a cook on the ship was crushed to death by the cargo of lumber being hauled by the ship. The ship was then pushed towards a sand bar. The captain, who had stayed high on the starboard side for safety, began climbing down to slip the ship cables, but the ship made a sudden stop. This flung the captain into the water, and he drowned. Both bodies were found after the storm and were very disfigured. The captain was sent to Middletown, Connecticut for interment while the body of the cook was buried on the beach. The final ship was the Harriet Thomas, which was the schooner spotted by the Manantico. After beaching, the crew managed to get a rope to shore where fishermen had tied the other end. The crew were able to climb ashore, although the captain had to be rescued via alternate means due to being <b>too</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>for</b> this method. The ship was written off as a $7000 (1887 USD) loss. Although all four ships were beached, due to the loss of communications, only one wreck – that of the Mary D. Cranmer – was reported in the Norfolk Virginian newspaper. As a result, news of the two deaths from the Manantico were initially unreported.|$|E
