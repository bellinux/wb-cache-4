5|$|Cotto's third {{championship}} defense {{took place}} on September 24, 2005 at Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City, New Jersey, against Ricardo <b>Torres</b> of Colombia. In the first round Cotto had an offensive advantage and scored a knockdown on <b>Torres.</b> In the second round after trading hits <b>Torres</b> scored a knockdown on Miguel. The last seconds of the round were evenly matched with both boxers finishing the round injured. Cotto was apparently in better condition when the third round began and was dominating the fight at that point. With two minutes remaining in the round one of Cotto's punches landed in Torres' beltline. Following this <b>Torres</b> was granted thirty seconds to recover by the referee. Cotto dominated the fourth round and <b>Torres</b> won the fifth. Cotto won and scored a knockdown in the sixth round. At 1:24 of the seventh round a left hook by Cotto knocked <b>Torres</b> out.|$|E
5|$|In game one of {{the second}} round of the 2013 Stanley Cup playoffs against the Kings, <b>Torres</b> {{recorded}} a hit on Jarret Stoll, injuring him. The hit was an illegal check to the head and <b>Torres</b> was a repeat offender; therefore, on May 16, the NHL suspended <b>Torres</b> for the remainder of the second round, which the Sharks lost. On June 20, 2013 the Sharks announced that they had re-signed <b>Torres</b> to a three-year contract. In the second 2013 preseason game against the Anaheim Ducks, <b>Torres</b> collided with Emerson Etem, causing <b>Torres</b> to injure his ACL, and was out until mid-February. <b>Torres</b> returned to the Sharks on February 27 against the Flyers. <b>Torres</b> recorded three points during the Sharks' opening round, seven game loss to the Los Angeles Kings in the 2014 Stanley Cup Playoffs. He then missed the entire 2014–15 NHL season due to injury.|$|E
5|$|Janszoon did {{not detect}} the {{existence}} of <b>Torres</b> Strait, which separates Australia and New Guinea. Unknown to the Dutch, the Spanish or Portuguese explorer Luis Váez de <b>Torres,</b> working for the Spanish Crown, sailed through the strait only four months later. However, <b>Torres</b> did not report seeing the coast of a major land mass to his south and is therefore presumed not to have seen Australia. Because the two separate observations of Janzoon and <b>Torres</b> were not matched, Dutch maps {{did not include the}} strait until after James Cook's 1770 passage through the <b>Torres</b> Strait, while early Spanish maps showed the coast of New Guinea correctly, but omitted Australia.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Sulan kills Durst and grafts {{his face}} {{over his own}} to appear more {{appealing}} to the Klingon <b>Torres.</b> Klingon <b>Torres</b> escapes from Sulan's laboratory, and rescues her human version. After arguing about their respective weaknesses, and past expulsion from Starfleet Academy, the two halves formulate a plan. Human <b>Torres</b> suggests shutting down the shields for the complex so that Voyager can transport them to the ship, while the Klingon <b>Torres</b> deals with guards. Chakotay, disguised as a Vidiian guard {{with the help of}} , breaks into the facility at the same time <b>Torres</b> deactivates the shields. Klingon <b>Torres</b> sacrifices herself to protect {{the rest of the crew}} members from Sulan. Transported back to Voyager, Klingon <b>Torres</b> refuses medical help to die an honorable death. The Doctor explains that Human <b>Torres</b> would not survive without her Klingon half and restores her to her original self by reintegrating the Klingon DNA. Human <b>Torres</b> admits to feeling incomplete without her Klingon half. After being restored, she realizes that she will spend the rest of her life dealing with her inner conflict.|$|E

5|$|<b>Torres,</b> {{who was in}} a coma {{the entire}} time, is resuscitated by Paris and the Doctor; she had almost died from the {{accident}} in the ion storm. Chakotay believes that Torres' encounter with her mother was a hallucination prompted from her near-death experience, but she believes that it was real. <b>Torres</b> believes that her mother is being punished because of her daughter's dishonor, stating that she must return to the Barge of the Dead to rescue her. Captain Kathryn Janeway permits <b>Torres</b> to put herself in an induced coma, with the Doctor monitoring the procedure. After being placed in a coma, <b>Torres</b> successfully returns to the barge. She reunites with her mother, but they argue about whether or not she has truly embraced Klingon spirituality. Miral responds by telling her that she does not understand what it truly means to be a Klingon. After their conversation, <b>Torres</b> decides to take her mother's place on the barge; even though Miral resists the transference, she is allowed to move on Sto-vo-kor (a version of the afterlife similar to the Norse Valhalla) while <b>Torres</b> is escorted into Gre'thor. She discovers that Voyager is her version of Gre'thor, and is confronted by alternate versions of the crew. Miral returns to explain that she cannot fully be released into Sto-vo-kor until <b>Torres</b> completes her journey. Tuvok attacks <b>Torres</b> again with a bat'leth, but she surrenders rather than fighting back. Miral identifies this as the first step in her path. She informs <b>Torres</b> that they will reunite either in Sto-vo-kor or when <b>Torres</b> returns home. <b>Torres</b> is resuscitated and embraced by Janeway.|$|E
