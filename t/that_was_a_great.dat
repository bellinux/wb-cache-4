25|$|The rebels {{realized}} {{that the people in}} Mecca supported the defense offered by Uthman and were not in the mood to listen to them. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> psychological victory for Uthman. It is said, according to Sunni Muslim accounts, that before returning to Syria, the governor Muawiyah, Uthman’s cousin, suggested that Uthman should come with him to Syria as the atmosphere there was peaceful. Uthman rejected his offer, saying that he didn't want to leave the city of Muhammad (referring to Medina). Muawiyah then suggested that he be allowed to send a strong force from Syria to Medina to guard Uthman against any possible attempt by rebels to harm him. Uthman rejected it too, saying that the Syrian forces in Medina would be an incitement to civil war, and he could not be party to such a move.|$|E

A circus agent saw him busking and hired him for three years. He later trained for three years as an actor at the Drama Centre London. Brosnan has described the feeling of becoming an actor and the impact it had on his life: [...] "When I found acting, or when acting found me, it was a liberation. It was a stepping stone into another life, away from a life that I had, and acting was something I was good at, something which was appreciated. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> satisfaction in my life." ...|$|E

The Edge said [...] "we heard Wim Wenders {{was looking for a}} song... so I had a go at finishing it." [...] U2 watched the film, Faraway, So Close!, for inspiration on how to craft the song. Bono said [...] "the film was about angels who want to be human and who want to be on Earth. But to do so they have to become mortal. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> image to play with- the impossibility of wanting something like this, and then the cost of having it." [...] Two versions of the song were crafted; the first was released on Zooropa, and the second, almost two minutes longer and featuring [...] "an edgier guitar and drum performance," [...] was included on the Faraway, So Close! soundtrack. Close to the completion of {{the recording}} Bono renamed the song [...] "Stay." [...] Wanting to further reference the Wenders film he then changed it once more, to [...] "Stay (Faraway, So Close!)".|$|E

Masood is still {{the only person who}} can see Yusef for what he really is, so he goes into a blind panic over the situation. Masood calls in the police, and they make sure that Kamil is safe, but we're left to wonder if he will stay that way. The police say that they can't get involved in domestic disputes, so Masood says, 'Well, what about the father's rights? If a mother reported this, you'd see it as kidnap'. I thought <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> line and really interesting - I think in that moment, Masood's representing a lot of fathers who have separated or divorced and don't have access to their children in the same way." ...|$|E

She wrote, [...] "...though I disagree {{with a few of}} the animator's choices, this Christmas special is a treat." [...] Basile criticized its characters especially the use of foam to create the characters and the way Santa Claus was depicted saying [...] "...he looks like a pig with liver spots." [...] The animators responded to this comment about their interpretation of Santa Claus, saying [...] "We definitely wanted to keep an element of strangeness, almost scary aspects in the story." [...] Caballero explained that the idea of making Santa Claus look tired and strange came when they saw a drawing of him by Marc Ceccarelli or Luke Brookshier. Caballero said, [...] "We thought <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> idea. So we came up with our own little back story where Bikini Bottom is the last stop for Santa. He's tired, he wants to get home, take his shoes off ... We honed in on the old descriptions of Santa being a jolly old elf. We pictured him as humanoid, but not necessarily directly human." ...|$|E

500|$|Love's Last Shift is {{the story}} of a last [...] "shift" [...] or trick that a virtuous wife, Amanda, is driven to reform and retain her rakish husband Loveless. Loveless has been away for ten years, {{dividing}} his time between the brothel and the bottle, and no longer recognises his wife when he returns to London. Acting the part of a high-class prostitute, Amanda lures Loveless into her luxurious house and treats him to the night of his dreams, confessing her true identity in the morning. Loveless is so impressed that he immediately reforms. A minor part <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> hit with the première audience is the fop Sir Novelty Fashion, written by Cibber for himself to play. Sir Novelty flirts with all the women, but is more interested in his own exquisite appearance and witticisms, and Cibber would modestly write in his autobiography 45 years later, [...] "was thought a good portrait of the foppery then in fashion". Combining daring sex scenes with sentimental reconciliations and Sir Novelty's buffoonery, Love's Last Shift offered something for everybody, and was a great box-office hit.|$|E
500|$|Pinkner {{thought the}} added musical element {{improved}} the episode, {{because it gave}} insights into each of the characters' psyches. According to Wyman and Pinkner, the [...] "episode {{was supposed to be}} a fantastical episode in the first place, and so the music supports the storytelling". Wyman continued in a different interview with the Los Angeles Times that [...] "Noirs traditionally are morality tales, and that's kind of what we're doing. We felt that <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> way to get across Walter's mind frame and where his head is at right now, with his son missing". Other cast members also praised the added music. John Noble wrote [...] "It really deepened and blew the episode out even further in the direction we were already taking. We get [...] fractured take on the world and his condition now that Peter has left. The music really supports the storytelling". He added, [...] "It is like a mind-trip of Walter's. It is Walter trying to grapple with the fact that his son is gone". Jasika Nicole continued: [...] "I have a musical theater background, so I've been waiting for some moment in some realm of where I am in TV and film for this to happen and, you know, of course, when Glee came on the air I was like, 'Great, that was my chance,' and I'm in this show, which I love this show, but I'm never going to sing and dance in this show. And I did! It's so awesome!" [...] Swerling called it [...] "the longest and possibly most difficult episode of the season" [...] to create.|$|E

2500|$|Despite having {{achieved}} {{a circulation of}} 670,000 Talk magazine's publication was abruptly halted in January 2002 {{in the wake of}} the advertising recession following the 9/11 attacks. It was Brown's first very public failure but she had no regrets about embarking on the project. She told Charlotte Edwardes of The Telegraph in 2002: [...] "My reputation rests on four magazines – three great successes, one <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> experiment. I don't feel in any way let down. No big career doesn't have one flame out in it and there's nobody more boring than the undefeated." [...] Talk Media was founded in July 1998 by Miramax Films, Tina Brown and Ron Galotti to publishing books and Talk magazine and produce television programs. Talk Media formed a joint venture with Heart Magazines for the magazine only in February 1999. Brown worked with the book division's editor-in chief Jonathan Burnham. She recalled in October 2017 at the time of allegations of sexual assault being made against Harvey Weinstein: [...] "Strange contracts pre-dating us would suddenly surface, book deals with no deadline attached authored by attractive or nearly famous women".|$|E

He described the race as [...] "tough" [...] and drove more conseratively with the knowledge he acculated from the previous [...] day's race and also made set-up and balance changes. Trummer said it felt [...] "really good" [...] to finish in second place and knew beforehand that he would achieve a good result in the sprint race. He stated he did not defend excessively against Palmer on the second lap because of his fast pace and was aware he had to conserve tyre life, [...] "But I was a bit wrong because he kept this strong pace all race long. Even {{at the end of the}} race I thought he would struggle more but he didn’t. It was really hard to attack him. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> race. I had a great pace and I’m happy with P2." [...] Third-place finisher Leal spoke of an [...] "unbelievable" [...] start of the season for himself and his team but focused their attention to the next race of the season. He said after the first corner, he was maintaining third place and praised Trummer for his performance in spite of not overtaking him in the first three laps.|$|E
