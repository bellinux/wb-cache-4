5|$|In 2016, {{due to a}} {{mounting}} debt {{in funding}} of the athletic program, the university polled its students {{on whether or not}} they would approve an increase in tuition which would be necessary to maintain the athletic program.

5|$|Manning {{became the}} target of {{bullying}} at the school {{because she was the}} only American and was viewed as effeminate.

25|$|The other {{southern}} states, Mysore State (now Karnataka), Andhra and Kerala, adopted a three-language formula where <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>would</b> {{be expected to}} study English, Hindi, and their regional language. While the north was keen on getting the southern curriculum with compulsory Hindi, it was demanded from the south that northern states take on a three-language policy for themselves too, {{with one of them}} being a Dravidian language. The northern states either refused to adopt a three-language formula, or wherever a three-language formula was implemented in the north, an option for taking Sanskrit was implemented, defeating the purpose of the policy itself.|$|E

25|$|Germantown did {{not have}} a public school until {{after the end of the}} American Civil War. During that time, {{education}} was handled at home. In 1868, a one-room schoolhouse was built on Maryland Route 118, near Black Rock Road, which hosted children from both Germantown and neighboring Darnestown. In 1883, a larger one-room schoolhouse was built closer to Clopper Road. Another, newer school was constructed in 1910, on what is now the site of Germantown Elementary School. This school had four rooms, with two downstairs and two upstairs, with each room housing two grade levels. After the eighth grade, <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>would</b> head via train to nearby Rockville, for further education.|$|E
25|$|Sentosa Balloon Hat Festival {{began in}} 2004.

25|$|When Aelony {{arrived at}} the University of Minnesota, he met some of the few {{students}} of color and discovered {{that only a small}} number were from the local communities, since most local blacks chose to attend black colleges and universities in the South. He also found that other minority students were having trouble obtaining local housing and employment in Minneapolis. Aelony worked with a group of students to help find housing for Persian students. This population had difficulty securing housing because it was rumored that they rubbed their skin with olive oil, which ruined the bedding. If the minority students were told an apartment complex was full, white students would go ask for a room there to test the fairness of the renters. <b>The</b> <b>students</b> <b>would</b> then talk to the renters, who were often embarrassed and would agree to rent to the minority students.|$|E
25|$|The {{school name}} {{was changed to}} İstanbul Sultanisi (Istanbul High School) in 1913. Following {{the closing of the}} foreign schools in İstanbul due to the {{beginning}} of the First World War, İstanbul Sultanisi was moved to the buildings of the Saint Benoit High School, and some parts of the buildings were changed to dormitories. The faculty was supported with the addition of prominent teachers, and the student populace exceeded 1600. Subsequent to the increased collaboration between the German and Ottoman Empires, 22 German teachers were sent by the German Ministry to the school, and the curriculum was changed to German. The curriculum was similar to Galatasaray High School, only the foreign language was German instead of French. <b>The</b> <b>students</b> <b>would</b> take 14 hours of weekly lessons in German, and the same lectures again in Turkish, except history and literature, which were taught only in Turkish.|$|E
25|$|On November 14, about 350 {{students}} {{gathered in}} front of Maha Bandula Park in downtown Yangon to stage a protest against the National Education Law. The students also later held subsequent protests at Yangon University and Shwedagon Pagoda. Moreover, Kyaw Ko Ko, the chairman of ABFSU, declared that the protest {{was just the beginning}} of the fight to reform National Education Law. He also stated that the main concern against the NEL is the formation of a National Education Commission composed of ministers and government officials that could limit students’ opinions and further reinforce the government control over higher education. The protest also coincided with United States President Barack Obama’s second visit to Yangon although Kyaw Ko Ko claimed that it was not intentional. He added, though, that <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>would</b> be ready to seize the opportunity to raise awareness about issues on education. The Action Committee for Democratic Education then requested the government to convene a quadripartite meeting with its members, NNER, members of Parliament and the government to discuss the students’ concerns. On 17 November, the students announced a 60-day interval for the government to respond to their demands and also threatened that they would stage a nationwide protests if the government didn’t respond within the deadline.|$|E

500|$|In his Philosophical Books review, Graham Haydon {{wrote that}} the book {{was part of a}} trend of {{political}} philosopher interest in how education works within liberal-democratic societies. He noted issues of compatibility between a society's self-described [...] "liberal" [...] values and the values of their educational practice, or between a society's educational practice and the wishes of its citizens. Haydon wrote critics of the common and detached public school would ask how <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>would</b> be raised without [...] "some cultural coherence". Writing in 2001, he said that her criticism of England's civics education already appeared outdated in view of England's then-new National Curriculum citizenship curriculum, which he felt Levinson would find the [...] "best model ... consistent with her own argument". He added that the [...] "radical pluralist" [...] societies used as examples do not accommodate citizens that hold other values over [...] "autonomy", and do not answer how citizens can be convinced to believe in [...] "autonomy-promoting" [...] schools. Haydon considered her book [...] "an important contribution" [...] to liberal theory and wrote that [...] "it would be a loss to political philosophy" [...] if she continued her work as a schoolteacher in lieu of an academic career.|$|E
500|$|On May 10, 1983, Howard Emerson, the {{adviser to}} the journalism class, {{submitted}} page proofs of the May 13 issue of the newspaper to principal Robert Eugene Reynolds for approval, a practice that was customary at the time. Reynolds objected {{to two of the}} stories scheduled to run. One was about teen pregnancy, containing interviews with three students who had been pregnant. The story used false names to keep the girls' identities a secret, but Reynolds was concerned that <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>would</b> still be identifiable from the text. He was also concerned that the references to sexual activity and birth control were inappropriate for younger students at the school. The second story was about divorce and featured an interview with a student whose parents were divorced, in which she complained that her father [...] "wasn't spending enough time with my mom, my sister, and I ... was always out of town on business or out late playing cards with the guys ... always argued about everything". Reynolds, unaware that the girl's name would also be changed, argued that her family should have been given an opportunity to respond within the story, or to object to its publication.|$|E

500|$|O'Mahoney and Winter {{began working}} on the film in 2006.

They wanted to make a {{documentary}} about [...] "the people never seen on the evening news, [...] presidents, prime ministers, generals and militants ... claiming to know something of Iraq's future". Winter explained that [...] "all these documentaries coming out of Iraq were done for or by adults. Iraqi children had not been more than a UN statistic about the dead, kidnapped or injured", so they decided to concentrate on what they viewed as the [...] "real source of Iraq's future" [...] – teenagers. [...] "I wanted {{to tell the story of}} Iraq in a different way. As journalists, we do stories about kids and teenagers, but we don't hear from them. If you go to the UN reports, they are just a number and that's it." [...] O'Mahoney was a little more reticent; he had recently worked in Iraq but did not wish to return due to the civil war and the deteriorating condition of the country. When it was decided to use a school as a backdrop to the story, which could also be used to provide a chronological narrative, O'Mahoney and Winter realised it would be too dangerous for the students to be seen with either a Western or Iraqi camera crew because it would draw too much attention to them, and so they decided that <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>would</b> film the documentary themselves.|$|E
