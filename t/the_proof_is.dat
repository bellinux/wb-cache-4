5|$|The rough idea {{of these}} inapproximability results is {{to form a}} graph that {{represents}} a probabilistically checkable proof system for an NP-complete problem such as the Boolean satisfiability problem. In a probabilistically checkable proof system, a proof is represented as a sequence of bits. An instance of the satisfiability problem should have a valid proof {{if and only if}} it is satisfiable. <b>The</b> <b>proof</b> <b>is</b> checked by an algorithm that, after a polynomial-time computation on the input to the satisfiability problem, chooses to examine a small number of randomly chosen positions of the proof string. Depending on what values are found at that sample of bits, the checker will either accept or reject the proof, without looking at the rest of the bits. False negatives are not allowed: a valid proof must always be accepted. However, an invalid proof may sometimes mistakenly be accepted. For every invalid proof, the probability that the checker will accept it must be low.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contains}} {{detailed description}} of two consistency proofs, which state that in the system called Peano arithmetic no contradiction can <b>be</b> obtained. <b>The</b> <b>proofs</b> <b>were</b> first published in 1936 and 1938 by the German mathematician Gerhard Gentzen. For {{the purpose of this}} paper, <b>the</b> <b>proofs</b> <b>were</b> read and studied from the original articles called "Die Widerspruchsfreiheit der reinen Zahlentheorie" and "Neue Fassung des Widerspruchsfreiheitsbeweises für die reine Zahlentheorie". <b>The</b> first mentioned <b>proof</b> <b>is</b> interesting from <b>the</b> historical point of view. Gentzen used a natural deduction sequent calculus and ordinal numbers in an unusual form he invented. <b>The</b> second <b>proof</b> <b>is</b> similar to <b>the</b> consistency <b>proof,</b> which <b>is</b> commonly known as a consistency proof for Peano arithmetic nowadays...|$|R

25|$|Intuitively, ψ is a self-referential {{sentence}} {{saying that}} ψ has the property F. The sentence ψ {{can also be}} viewed as a fixed point of the operation assigning to each formula θ the sentence F(°#(θ)).

25|$|A {{proof that}} P = NP could have {{stunning}} practical consequences if the proof leads to efficient methods for solving {{some of the}} important problems in NP. It {{is also possible that}} a proof would not lead directly to efficient methods, perhaps if <b>the</b> <b>proof</b> <b>is</b> non-constructive, or the size of the bounding polynomial is too big to be efficient in practice. The consequences, both positive and negative, arise since various NP-complete problems are fundamental in many fields.|$|E
25|$|For {{refutation}} tableaux, {{the objective}} is to show that the negation of a formula cannot be satisfied. There are rules for handling each of the usual connectives, starting with the main connective. In many cases, applying these rules causes the subtableau to divide into two. Quantifiers are instantiated. If any branch of a tableau leads to an evident contradiction, the branch closes. If all branches close, <b>the</b> <b>proof</b> <b>is</b> complete and the original formula is a logical truth.|$|E

25|$|To {{establish}} a mathematical statement as a theorem, a proof is required, that is, {{a line of}} reasoning from axioms in the system (and other, already established theorems) to the given statement must be demonstrated. However, <b>the</b> <b>proof</b> <b>is</b> usually considered as separate from the theorem statement. Although more than one proof may be known for a single theorem, only one proof is required to establish {{the status of a}} statement as a theorem. The Pythagorean theorem and the law of quadratic reciprocity are contenders for the title of theorem with the greatest number of distinct proofs.|$|E
25|$|Another {{suggestion}} for simplifying <b>the</b> <b>proof</b> <b>is</b> to make {{greater use of}} representation theory. The {{problem here is that}} representation theory seems to require very tight control over the subgroups of a group in order to work well. For groups of small rank one has such control and representation theory works very well, but for groups of larger rank no-one has succeeded in using it to simplify the classification. In {{the early days of the}} classification there was considerable effort made to use representation theory, but this never achieved much success in the higher rank case.|$|E
25|$|Another way {{to think}} of <b>the</b> <b>proof</b> <b>is</b> that B, empty or non-empty, is always in the power set of A. For f to be onto, some element of A must map to B. But {{that leads to a}} {{contradict}}ion: no element of B can map to B because that would contradict the criterion of membership in B, thus the element mapping to B must not be an element of B meaning that it satisfies the criterion for membership in B, another contradiction. So the assumption that an element of A maps to B must be false; and f cannot be onto.|$|E
