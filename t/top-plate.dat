60|$|Beyond 'Devil's Gate' a {{pleasant}} surprise awaited us. Mr. D. C. MacLennan, manager of the Effuenta mine, [Footnote: The name was given by M. Dahse; it {{is that of the}} first worker, Efuátá, a woman born on Saturday (Efua), and the third of a series of daughters (átá).] stopped his canoe to greet us. He was justly proud of his charge--a box of amalgam weighing 15 lbs. and carrying eighty ounces of gold. It was to be retorted at home and to be followed within a fortnight by a larger delivery, and afterwards by monthly remittances. The precious case, which will give courage to so many half-hearted shareholders, was duly embarked on the A.S.S. Ambriz (Captain Crookes); and its successor, containing the produce of a hundred tons, on the B. and A. Benguela (Captain Porter). Consequently the papers declared that Effuenta was first in the field of results. This {{is by no means the}} case. As early as November 1881 Mr. W. E. Crocker, of Crockerville, manager of the important Wásá, (Wassaw) mining-property, sent home gold--amalgam, and black sand [Footnote: I have before noticed this 'golden sea-sand.' It has lately been found, the papers tell me, on the coast about Cape Commerell, British Columbia. A handful, taken from a few inches below the surface, shows glittering specks of 'float-gold,' scales so fine that it was difficult to wash them by machinery. Mem. This is what women do every day on the Gold Coast. The Colonist says that a San Francisco company has at length hit upon the contrivance. It consists of six drawers or layers of plates punched with holes about half an inch in diameter, and covered with amalgam. The gold-sand is 'dumped in;' and the water, turned on the <b>top-plate,</b> sets all in motion: the sand falls from plate to plate, leaving the free loose gold which has attached itself to the amalgam, and very little remains to be caught by the sixth plate. So simple a process is eminently fitted for the Gold Coast.]--a total of sixty-eight ounces to twenty-five tons.|$|E

40|$|Typical North American wood frame {{houses have}} trusses that are toe-nailed {{to the wall}} <b>top-plates.</b> In order to develop models of roof {{failures}} for such structures, considering the effects of wind speed, direction and duration for a storm, {{as well as the}} structural details, knowledge of the load sharing and how it is altered by the nail slip at each of the connections is required. The objective of the current paper is to quantify the changes in load sharing during nail/connection slip. This is achieved by simplifying the roof structure to the essential components of a beam, which bends elastically in the direction normal to the trusses, and real, toe-nailed connections. Test results for a single "roof stiffness" and truss spacing show that significant load sharing is not observed until permanent displacements (i. e., damage) to a connection occur. Dynamic load tests, with the same time-varying load applied to each connection, have shown that the load sharing increases with the damage accumulation to each of the connections and changes continuously. Ultimately, this information will be used in the development of analytical models that are able to consider storm duration effects on the performance and failure of wood-frame houses in extreme winds...|$|R
40|$|A typical wood {{frame house}} roof {{consists}} of trusses which are {{nailed to the}} <b>top-plates</b> of the wall assembly. These are known as roof-to-wall connections (RTWCs). A load-sharing mechanism is developed between adjacent RTWCs via roof elements such as roof-sheathing, fascia beams, etc., during high wind loads. An experimental setup was developed to observe the load-sharing behavior between seven connections. To mimic the roof bending stiffness in the direction perpendicular to the trusses, two steel beams with representative bending stiffness were connected across the RTWCs in a simple way. Identical ramp and identical fluctuating wind loads were applied to all the connections simultaneously. Two types of beams were used for these loading types. The bending stiffness of the stiffer beams is four {{times higher than the}} bending stiffness of the less stiff beams. Individual RTWCs were also subjected to identical ramp and fluctuating wind loads to define the load-displacement behavior of toe-nail connections and to make comparisons with the results found from the RTWCs of the systems. From the tests conducted it was found that individual connections displacement variability for the same applied loads is reduced by the system (i. e., beams) due to load-sharing between the connections through the beams. Load-sharing is greatest during the short duration, damaging peak loads. Load-sharing changes and increases continuously with the permanent displacements during damaging peak loads. Due to higher flexural rigidity of the stiffer beams, load-sharing or load re-distribution is higher between the RTWCs than for the less stiff beams...|$|R

40|$|Woods, as the {{constitutive}} {{materials of}} a majority of musical instruments throughout the world, {{play a major role in}} their final behaviour and "cultural/musical identity". Musical instrument making, which can be considered as an "intangible cultural heritage", involves the acquisition and transmission of very specific craftsmanship skills, and is integrated into a wider context - woodworking and musical traditions of a given geo-cultural area, but also knowledge on woody plant resource and material. The choice of wood by instrument makers is an essential part of such traditional knowledge and know-how. Due to the "ambivalent" nature of musical instruments (with equally strong acoustical/mechanical, and cultural, functions), the woods chosen for their building have been studied -for nearly a century now- from two distinct points of view/disciplines: "engineering" and "ethno-botanical" points of view. This paper aims at illustrating some wood science approaches to musical instrument making, with particular focus on the links between mechanical/acoustical and traditional/empirical criteria of material selection. It relies on a survey of existing literature, combined with our personal works: characterization of dynamic mechanical and physical properties of instrument woods, interviews with instrument makers, and inter-disciplinary database construction. It considers two case studies (woods for <b>top-plates</b> of stringed instruments and woods for bows) and two levels of variability: chosen species in different cultural contexts, and within-species wood piece selection by makers. Between-species diversity results suggest that: (i) the "western classical music instruments" standard which is usually used in material research studies cannot always be extrapolated to other geo-cultural areas; (ii) the amount of diversity in chosen species results from the combination of material availability, of mechanical "performance", but also of musical/technological trends related to a cultural context. Such trends continuously evolved since the Middle-Ages in the case of European bows, resulting in some "diversification" and some "standardization" epochs. Within-species selection by makers is by essence based on multi-criteria approaches. Different works on psycho-sensorial classification of woods for string instruments tend towards the same conclusions in terms of material properties, but they do not always fully converge, due to the "human variability" parameter, which suggests that wider samplings and surveys with several makers would be useful. The analysis of the relation between mechanical assessment and "empirical" classification of different "qualities" of pernambuco wood for modern violin bows, through two recently published references plus our present work; suggests that: (i) specific gravity and Young's modulus are indeed important parameters in bow material selection, but not always sufficient for discrimination of empirical qualities; (ii) taking into account, not only density and elastic properties, but simultaneously colorimetric (CIELCh) and dynamic mechanical (loss coefficient tanδ) parameters allowed for a much clearer discrimination between "traditional knowledge" classifications, which highlights the importance of multi-criteria, and multi-disciplinary approaches, if a better global understanding of traditional knowledge is sought after...|$|R

5000|$|The R9 was an {{evolutionary}} step from the R8 and appears superficially very similar; {{enough so that}} some have opined {{that it should have}} been simply a Mark II of the R8, or in Leica nomenclature, an [...] "R8.2".2 The silver <b>top-plate</b> color available on the R8 was replaced by an 'Anthracite' color on the R9; black remained available. Another external change was the addition of an LCD frame counter on the top plate between the wind lever and the shutter-speed dial. The mode selector dial gained a lock, after many R8 user complaints that it was too easily moved from the desired setting when handling the camera. The rear LCD display gained a backlight so it could be viewed in dim lighting. The mass of the R9 was reduced by 100g (to 790g) from the R8, achieved by switching to a magnesium casting for the top plate (formerly zinc alloy) and substituting aluminum for steel at the bottom plate's frame. Electronic changes included the ability to tune the sensitivity of matrix metering in steps of 0.1 EV independently of the other metering modes, and several improvements to the flash support. Metz's HSS (High Speed Sync) flash mode was now supported, allowing fill flash at shutter speeds greater than the X-sync speed by the use of many repeated small flashes of the electronic flashgun. This mode could be used from 1/360 to the camera's shortest 1/8000 of a second shutter speed. Also improved was the use of fill-flash at slower shutter speeds and wider apertures, by enabling lower-power illumination modes on modern Metz equipment. The manual flash exposure compensation ability in Program mode was improved, and AE lock was now possible in all automated modes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{widespread}} {{interest on}} the hereditary behavior of biological and bioinspired materials motivates deeper studies on their macroscopic “min-imal ” state. The resulting integral equations for the detected relaxation and creep power-laws, of exponent β, are characterized by fractional operators. Here strains in SBVloc are considered to account for time-like jumps. Consis-tently, starting from stresses in Lrloc, r ∈ [1, β− 1], β ∈ (0, 1) we reconstruct the corresponding strain by extending a result in [42]. The “minimal ” state is explored by showing that different histories delivering the same response are such that the fractional derivative of their difference is zero for all times. This equation is solved through a one-parameter family of strains whose related stresses converge to the response characterizing the original problem. This provides an approximation formula for the state variable, namely the resid-ual stress associated to the difference of the histories above. Very {{little is known about}} the microstructural origins of the detected power-laws. Recent rheological models, based on a <b>top-plate</b> adhering and moving on functionally graded microstructures, allow for showing that the resultant of the underlying “microstresses ” matches the action recorded at the <b>top-plate</b> of such models, yielding a relationship between the macroscopic state and the “microstresses”. 1.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} number of bits, parasitic effects and flicker noise of switching transistors in the DAC capacitor array of the SAR ADC are getting relatively bigger when compared to the exponentially decreasing error budget. This paper analyses the effects of parasitic capacitances related to the <b>top-plate</b> and bottom-plate of unit capacitors on the accuracy and the noise performance of the DAC capacitor array, showing that thermal noise of the whole capacitor array decreases when parasitic capacitances are considered while in the meantime an unexpected gain error is introduced. Although the parasitic-capacitance-induced gain error is almost independent of the number of bits, parasitic effects should be minimized for high resolution SAR ADCs since the dynamic range of the high resolution ADC is severely reduced due to the gain error. The post-layout parasitic capacitance extraction of a 10 -bit poly-poly DAC capacitor array shows that the value difference between the <b>top-plate</b> and bottom-plate related parasitic capacitances is large so that the parasitic-capacitance-induced gain error can be decreased by 152 times when top-plates of unit capacitors are connected together as the output node of the capacitor array. The switching transistor’s flicker noise calculation for a 10 -bit SAR ADC shows that flicker noise can be safely ignored for 10 -bit 1 MSPS SAR, while the calculation for an 18 -bit 1 MSPS SAR ADC shows that flicker noise should be considered for the higher resolution SAR ADCs...|$|E

Finite element (FE) analysis using ABAQUS (6. 12 - 3) software is {{used in this study}} to determine the {{structural response}} and uplift capacities of typical roof to wall connections. Results (i. e. force-displacement relationship and failure modes) of the FE model were compared with experimental tests and the model validated from the test results.

The FE model produced structural responses and uplift capacities that generally agree with the experimental results. Construction defects (i. e. missing nails) in a roof to wall connection influences the design uplift capacity. Nails located near the centre line of the loading action in a triple grip connection (i. e. common roof to wall connection used in the timber-framed house of Australia) significantly affect the stiffness of this connection.

40|$|By {{studying}} pressure fluctuations using {{a system}} identification approach, it is hypothesized that circulating fluidized bed (CFB) pressure fluctuations {{are indicative of}} CFB hydrodynamics in two ways. First, the frequency phenomenon that is observed in the lower regions of the CFB under conditions of high solids loading {{is the result of}} lower dense bed voidage oscillations. Our results suggest that a surface wave phenomena inversely proportional to the square root of the bed diameter is also be observed in CFB pressure fluctuations under most conditions. By matching revised similitude parameters between two CFBs a number of conclusions can be drawn. First, spectral analysis of pressure fluctuations, if properly applied, can be used to verify that similitude has been achieved. To do this, not only must the Bode plot characteristics important for hydrodynamics be identified, but the pressure fluctuation structure at all elevations of the CFB must be similar. The set of similitude parameters defined by Glicksman is not sufficient to establish hydrodynamic similitude. The solids flux as typically measured in the downcomer does not contain information on the solids hold-up in the riser, or the amount of solids that progress downwards in the annulus rather than exit the riser. It is better to use the total mass contained in the riser as the important ``solids`` parameter for the establishment of similitude, rather than the solids flux. This measurement can be made more accurately, monitored continuously, and is a much simpler measurement to perform in most CFB systems. Even with this new set of dimensionless parameters, the differences in the coefficient of restitution of particle/bed collisions may make {{a significant difference in the}} CFB hydrodynamics.

The analysis reveals the presence of two classes of modes, the first of which becomes unstable for perturbations with wavelength comparable to the channel width (finite wavelength modes), and the second becomes unstable for perturbations with wavelength small compared to the channel width (short wave modes). The latter class of modes are found to be absent for the highly concentrated polymer solutions with β≤ 0. 23, where β is the ratio of solvent-to-solution viscosity. We have mapped out the regions in the parameter space W̅-H) where the finite wavelength and short wave modes are unstable, where W̅=(λ G/ η), and lambda is the relaxation time of the viscoelastic fluid. Fluid elasticity is found to have a stabilizing influence on the unstable mode, such that when the shortwave instability is absent for β≤ 0. 23, the flow becomes stable for any Weissenberg number W̅>W̅_ max. Here, W̅_max increases proportional to H for H≫ 1. However, when the shortwave instability is present, the instability persists for W̅≫ 1. The behavior of both classes of modes with respect to the parameters, like W̅, H, β, and the ratio of solid-to-fluid viscosity η_o, is examined...|$|E
40|$|The linear {{stability}} {{analysis of}} a plane Couette flow of an Oldroyd-B viscoelastic fluid past a flexible solid medium is carried out to investigate the role of polymer addition in the stability behavior. The system consists of a viscoelastic fluid layer of thickness R, density rho, viscosity eta, relaxation time lambda, and retardation time beta lambda flowing past a linear elastic solid medium of thickness HR, density rho, and shear modulus G. The {{emphasis is on the}} high-Reynolds-number wall-mode instability, which has recently been shown in experiments to destabilize the laminar flow of Newtonian fluids in soft-walled tubes and channels at a significantly lower Reynolds number than that for flows in rigid conduits. For Newtonian fluids, the linear stability {{studies have shown that the}} wall modes become unstable when flow Reynolds number exceeds a certain critical value Re c which scales as Sigma(3 / 4), where Reynolds number Re = rho VR/eta, V is the <b>top-plate</b> velocity, and dimensionless parameter Sigma = rho GR(2) /eta(2) characterizes the fluid-solid system. For high-Reynolds-number flow, the addition of polymer tends to decrease the critical Reynolds number in comparison to that for the Newtonian fluid, indicating a destabilizing role for fluid viscoelasticity. Numerical calculations show that the critical Reynolds number could be decreased by up to a factor of 10 by the addition of small amount of polymer. The critical Reynolds number follows the same scaling Re-c similar to Sigma(3 / 4) as the wall modes for a Newtonian fluid for very high Reynolds number. However, for moderate Reynolds number, there exists a narrow region in beta-H parametric space, corresponding to very dilute polymer solution (0. 9 less than or similar to beta < 1) and thin solids (H less than or similar to 1. 1), in which the addition of polymer tends to increase the critical Reynolds number in comparison to the Newtonian fluid. Thus, Reynolds number and polymer properties can be tailored to either increase or decrease the critical Reynolds number for unstable modes, thus providing an additional degree of control over the laminar-turbulent transition...|$|E
