5|$|While other {{companies}} marketed directly to foreign air forces, {{as part of}} the FX program, the F-5G could only be marketed by the State Department. Under this policy umbrella, Northrop had to submit every piece of marketing material to government review, which could <b>take</b> <b>months.</b> The State Department had no interest in selling the FX; from its perspective it was one aircraft among many, leading to a lackadaisical approach, and led to complaints from Northrop that the government was not promoting the F-20 enough.|$|E

5|$|Within Stalags and Oflags, prisoners had {{substantial}} {{amounts of}} leisure time. Letters and parcels from home could <b>take</b> <b>months</b> to arrive in camps and be distributed by the Red Cross; consequently, most had little regular contact with their families. The Red Cross also provided food, books, sports equipment and musical instruments, {{as well as information}} and letters. Thanks to the access to books, the historian Fernand Braudel wrote most of his influential work La Méditerranée et le monde méditerranéen à l'époque de Philippe II (1949), which established the analytical concept of the longue durée, while in captivity in Germany.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} the {{widespread}} damage, 1,000personnel from the Canadian military were brought in for recovery efforts. The military operation, known as Operation Lama, was to last {{for the duration of}} the emergency phase in the immediate aftermath. An initial deployment of 120soldiers and 40vehicles arrived on September25 from the Canadian Forces Base Gagetown in Oromocto, New Brunswick arrived in Newfoundland. Three ships and a fleet of helicopters were called in for the distribution of emergency aid and the military set up temporary bridges while long-term plans for reconstruction were made. Operation Lama also enabled partial repairs of several buildings, and simultaneously, emergency personnel surveyed roughly 500mi (900km) of roads in Newfoundland. On September27, government officials stated that it would <b>take</b> <b>months</b> for cleanup efforts to finish. Ten days after the storm, six towns were still isolated as progress on temporary road reconstruction was being made only slowly. Allocation of military aid continued through October6, though the number of on-scene personnel began to decrease two days earlier.|$|E
5|$|Powell Clayton, a 35-year-old former Brigadier General in the Union Army who {{remained}} in Arkansas after marrying an Arkansas woman, was elected governor as a Republican in April, 1868. The election was scarred with irregularities. For example, the return of votes in Pulaski County exceeded the number of registered voters. Also, the registrars, who controlled the distribution of ballots, admitted that they had given ballots to voters from other counties if they could show a valid registration certificate. Both sides claimed election fraud and voter intimidation: armed parties had been stationed on roads to keep voters away from the polls. General Gillem, commander of the military district that included Arkansas, wrote to General Grant that it would <b>take</b> <b>months</b> to sort out which side had committed the greater election fraud.|$|E

25|$|While the {{majority}} of brown recluse spider bites do not result in any symptoms, cutaneous symptoms occur more frequently than systemic symptoms. In such instances, the bite forms a necrotizing ulcer {{as the result of}} soft tissue destruction and may <b>take</b> <b>months</b> to heal, leaving deep scars. These bites usually become painful and itchy within 2 to 8 hours. Pain and other local effects worsen 12 to 36 hours after the bite, and the necrosis develops over the next few days. Over time, the wound may grow to as large as 25cm (10inches). The damaged tissue becomes gangrenous and eventually sloughs away.|$|E

25|$|Tetanus, {{also known}} as lockjaw, is an {{infection}} characterized by muscle spasms. In the most common type, the spasms begin in the jaw and then progress {{to the rest of}} the body. These spasms usually last a few minutes each time and occur frequently for three to four weeks. Spasms may be so severe that bone fractures may occur. Other symptoms may include fever, sweating, headache, trouble swallowing, high blood pressure, and a fast heart rate. Onset of symptoms is typically three to twenty-one days following infection.

Other symptoms include elevated temperature, sweating, elevated blood pressure, and episodic rapid heart rate. Spasms may occur frequently and last for several minutes with the body shaped into a characteristic form called opisthotonos.
