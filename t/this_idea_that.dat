5|$|In 350 BCE, Greek philosopher Aristotle {{suggested}} that nature abhors a vacuum, a principle that {{became known as}} the horror vacui. This concept built upon a 5th-century BCE ontological argument by the Greek philosopher Parmenides, who denied the possible existence of a void in space. Based on <b>this</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> a vacuum could not exist, in the West it was widely held for many centuries that space could not be empty. As late as the 17th century, the French philosopher René Descartes argued that the entirety of space must be filled.|$|E

Although these DNA markers {{are too small to}} be genes, they suggest that researchers may be getting close to finding an autism gene in this region.|$|E
25|$|There were early {{claims that}} Dolly the sheep had pathologies {{resembling}} accelerated aging. Scientists speculated that Dolly's death in 2003 {{was related to}} the shortening of telomeres, DNA-protein complexes that protect the end of linear chromosomes. However, other researchers, including Ian Wilmut who led the team that successfully cloned Dolly, argue that Dolly's early death due to respiratory infection was unrelated to deficiencies with the cloning process. <b>This</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> the nuclei have not irreversibly aged was shown in 2013 to be true for mice.|$|E

25|$|From a Maslownian perspective, Sarkar {{defends the}} need to meet {{physical}} and mental needs before being able {{to engage in a}} journey to find that transcendental nature of the world. The five fundamental principles stem from <b>this</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> society needs to provide for the basic necessities of all human beings so that they can engage in this journey of self discovery and achieve true progress. Fundamentally, progress in society is the effort through which communities engage in the fulfillment of human needs, with the goal of achieving a transcendental existence. As a goal, transcendence will offer a fourth bottom line which ideally would propel human society into a more peaceful, inclusive and all-round more progressive existence.|$|E

I joined Dad's Army when I was sixteen, and if the Germans had arrived, I tell you, I could use a bayonet, a rifle, a revolver, and if I'd seen a German officer having a meal I'd have tossed a grenade through the window. Would I have been a freedom fighter or a terrorist?" ...|$|E

[...] On the subject of being too obscure, he said in a 1996 interview that [...] "maybe the area where we're on dodgy ground, is <b>this</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> you need great knowledge [...] esoteric music to understand what we're doing." [...] Sadier responded to Gane, saying that she [...] "think we have achieved a music that will make sense {{to a lot of people}} whether they know about Steve Reich or not." [...] The duo were up-front about their desire to grow the group's sound: for Gane, [...] "otherwise it just sounds like what other people are doing," [...] and for Sadier, [...] "you trust that there is more and that it can be done more interesting." ...|$|E
5|$|A further {{suggestion}} is that Mari Lwyd derives from the English term Merry Lude, referring to a merry game. Peate opposed <b>this</b> <b>idea,</b> arguing <b>that</b> if the latter was converted into Welsh then {{the result would be}} merri-liwt or merri-liwd. Peate also dismissed the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> had been suggested to him that the term Mari in this context had derived from Morris, a reference to Morris dance. Another reason to doubt <b>this</b> <b>idea</b> is <b>that</b> there is no known historical link between the Mari Lwyd, which was found in South Wales, and the Morris dance, which was concentrated in the north of the country.|$|R

500|$|The {{violence}} of the fight clubs serves not to promote or glorify physical combat, but for participants to experience feeling {{in a society where}} they are otherwise numb. The fights tangibly represent a resistance to the impulse to be [...] "cocooned" [...] in society. Norton believed that the fighting between the men strips away the [...] "fear of pain" [...] and [...] "the reliance on material signifiers of their self-worth", leaving them to experience something valuable. When the fights evolve into revolutionary violence, the film only half-accepts the revolutionary dialectic by Tyler Durden; the Narrator pulls back and rejects Durden's ideas. Fight Club purposely shapes an ambiguous message, the interpretation of which is left to the audience. Fincher elaborated, [...] "I love <b>this</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> you can have fascism without offering any direction or solution. Isn't the point of fascism to say, 'This is the way we should be going'? But this movie couldn't be further from offering any kind of solution." ...|$|E
500|$|This was {{the last}} episode filmed by Carter to feature Scully in the FBI autopsy scene at 20th Century Fox.

[...] The tagline for this episode is [...] "Dio Ti Ama", meaning [...] "God loves you" [...] in Italian, replacing the usual phrase [...] "The Truth is Out There." [...] The normal line [...] "Executive Producer: Chris Carter" [...] is also rendered in Italian, reading, [...] "Produttore Esecutivo: Chris Carter".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Murphy commented {{on the structure of}} the series' first season. [...] "I loved how it began. I loved it in the middle and I loved the end. The only thing really frustrating for me, to be honest with you, is that sometimes people would write <b>this</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> we were making it up as we went along and I wanted to say, 'Really?' But I think now people are writing and saying, 'Oh yeah!' I'm excited for people to see it on DVD, because now that they know how it ended, [...] go back and see all of the little things, like people who have no reflections in mirrors. When you go back, you will see everything was set up." [...] When asked if the House [...] "pulled" [...] the Harmons to it, Murphy responded, [...] "I don't know if they were targeted. I don't think the Internet site had any supernatural pull to it...although that would have been hilarious. I thought it was two things: it was house porn because I think that house really is extraordinary. And also I think there's always that allure in American lives of the fresh start, moving West, starting fresh." ...|$|E

500|$|Van Eyck gives Mary three roles: Mother of Christ, the {{personification}} of the [...] "Ecclesia Triumphans" [...] and Queen of Heaven, the latter apparent from her jewel-studded crown. The painting's near miniature size contrasts with Mary's unrealistically large stature compared with her setting. She physically dominates the cathedral; her head is almost level with the approximately sixty feet high gallery. This distortion of scale is found {{in a number of}} other van Eyck's Madonna paintings, where the arches of the mostly gothic interior do not allow headroom for the virgin. Pächt describes the interior as a [...] "throne room", which envelopes her as if a [...] "carrying case". Her monumental stature reflects a tradition reaching back to an Italo-Byzantine type – perhaps best known through Giotto's Ognissanti Madonna (c. 1310) – and emphasises her identification with the cathedral itself. Till-Holger Borchert says that van Eyck did not paint her as [...] "the Madonna in a church", but instead as metaphor, presenting Mary [...] "as the Church". <b>This</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> her size represents her embodiment as the church was first suggested by Erwin Panofsky in 1941. Art historians in the 19th century, who thought the work was executed early in van Eyck's career, attributed her scale as the mistake of a relatively immature painter.|$|E
500|$|Stephen G. Haw, however, {{challenges}} <b>this</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> Polo exaggerated his own importance, writing that, [...] "contrary to {{what has}} often been said...Marco does not claim any very exalted position for himself in the Yuan empire." [...] He points out that Marco never {{claimed to be a}} minister of high rank, a darughachi, a leader of a tumen (i.e. 10,000 men), not even the leader of 1,000 men, only that he was an emissary for the khan and held a position of some honor. Haw sees this as a reasonable claim if Marco was a keshig, who numbered some fourteen thousand at the time. Haw explains how the earliest manuscripts of Polo's accounts provide contradicting information about his role in Yangzhou, with some stating he was just a simple resident, others stating he was a governor, and Ramusio's manuscript claiming he was simply holding that office as a temporary substitute for someone else, yet all the manuscripts concur that he worked as an esteemed emissary for the khan. Haw also objected to the approach to finding mention of Marco Polo in Chinese texts, contending that contemporaneous Europeans had little regard for using surnames, and a direct Chinese transcription of the name [...] "Marco" [...] ignores the possibility of him taking on a Chinese or even Mongol name that had no bearing or similarity with his Latin name.|$|E
