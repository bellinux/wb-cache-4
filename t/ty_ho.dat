A previous study of P 50 sensory gating did not reveal abnormalities in high-functioning school age children [C. Kemner, B. Oranje, M. N. Verbaten, H. van Engeland, Normal P 50 gating in children with autism, J. Clin. Psychiatry 63 (2002) 214 – 217]. Sensory gating deficit may, however, characterize younger children with autism or be a feature of retarded children with autism, reflecting imbalance of neuronal excitation/inhibition in these cohorts. We applied a paired clicks paradigm to study P 50 sensory gating, {{and its relation to}} IQ and EEG gamma spectral power (as a putative marker of cortical excitability), in young (3 – 8 years) children with autism (N = 21) and age-matched typically developing children (N = 21).

2500|$|Oberdorfer {{reported}} {{that on the}} 5th day of the Viet Cong occupation in the Catholic district of Huế, Phủ Cam, all able-bodied males over age 15, approximately 400 boys and men, who took refuge in Phủ Cam Cathedral were taken away and killed [...] Some {{had been on the}} VC's blacklist, some were of military age and some just looked prosperous. Oberdorfer interviewed <b>Ho</b> <b>Ty,</b> a VC commander {{who took part in the}} advanced planning of a general uprising. [...] He {{reported that}} Ty recounted that the Communist party [...] "was particularly anxious to get those people at Phủ Cam... The Catholics were considered particular enemies of ours." [...] It was apparently this group whose remains were later found in the Da Mai Creek bed. The murders of 500 people at Da Mai were authorized by PRG command [...] "on grounds that the victims had been traitors to the revolution.” ...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} the extent of {{transcriptional}} regulation of many, apparently unrelated, genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is dependent on RPD 1 (and RPD 3 [M. Vidal and R. F. Gaber, Mol. Cell. Biol. 11 : 6317 - 6327, 1991]). Genes regulated by stimuli as diverse as external signals (PHO 5), cell differentiation processes (SPO 11 and SPO 13), cell type (RME 1, FUS 1, <b>HO,</b> <b>TY</b> 2, STE 6, STE 3, and BAR 1), and genes whose regulatory signals remain unknown (TRK 2) depend on RPD 1 to achieve maximal states of transcriptional regulation. RPD 1 enhances {{both positive and negative}} regulation of these genes: in rpd 1 delta mutants, higher levels of expression are observed under repression conditions and lower levels are observed under activation conditions. We show that several independent genetic screens, designed to identify yeast transcriptional regulators, have detected the RPD 1 locus (also known as SIN 3, SD 11, and UME 4). The inferred RPD 1 protein contains four regions predicted to take on helix-loop-helix-like secondary structures and three regions (acidic, glutamine rich, and proline rich) reminiscent of the activating domains of transcriptional activators...|$|R
