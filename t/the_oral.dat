5|$|Because <b>the</b> <b>oral</b> {{polio vaccine}} is inexpensive, easy to administer, and {{produces}} excellent immunity in the intestine (which helps prevent infection with wild virus {{in areas where}} it is endemic), {{it has been the}} vaccine of choice for controlling poliomyelitis in many countries. On very rare occasions (about one case per 750,000 vaccine recipients), the attenuated virus in <b>the</b> <b>oral</b> polio vaccine reverts into a form that can paralyze. Most industrialized countries have switched to inactivated polio vaccine, which cannot revert, either as the sole vaccine against poliomyelitis or in combination with oral polio vaccine.|$|E

5|$|The column or trunk is {{generally}} {{more or less}} cylindrical and may be plain and smooth or may bear specialist structures; these include solid papillae (fleshy protuberances), adhesive papillae, cinclides (slits) and small protruding vesicles.

When the animal contracts, <b>the</b> <b>oral</b> disc, tentacles and capitulum fold inside the pharynx and are held in place by a strong sphincter muscle part way up the column.

40|$|In The Netherlands <b>the</b> routine <b>oral</b> {{examination}} (ROE) can {{be characterized}} as an important tool in dental care. As a result of the changing prevalence of <b>oral</b> diseases of <b>the</b> Dutch population the content of <b>the</b> routine <b>oral</b> examination has changed over time. A representative survey among general dental practitioners has been carried out to investigate the professional performance in <b>the</b> routine <b>oral</b> examination. Participants consisted of a random, stratified sample of 619 dentists, of whom 521 (85 %) responded. The Dutch general dental practitioners use <b>the</b> routine <b>oral</b> examination mainly for detecting dental caries and to asses the status of the restorations. About 50 % of the responders use a standard recall interval for all patients whereas the other half takes individual patient factors into consideration when determining the recall interval. Both groups differ significantly on the variables: 'time spend on <b>the</b> routine <b>oral</b> examination', 'the amount of diagnostic activities', 'the registration in patient dental records' and 'the frequency of using bitewing radiographs'. In the perspective of quality of dental care a national reconsideration of <b>the</b> routine <b>oral</b> examination by professionals and patients is advocated. The instrument of choice would be the use of evidence-based clinical practice guideline development procedures...|$|R
