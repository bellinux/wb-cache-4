5|$|After winning all the breaststroke {{events at}} the country championships, O'Brien was taken by his father to the Ryde pool in Sydney in 1960, to be coached by Forbes Carlile and his assistant, retired world record-breaking breaststroker Terry Gathercole. Carlile was {{regarded}} as the leading swimming coach in Australia at <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>At</b> age 13, O'Brien was already a large teenager, weighing in at 82.6kg. He only trained with Gathercole during holidays, when his father could take him to Sydney; Jim Wilkins, a Catholic priest in Bathurst, supervised him according to Gathercole's program {{while he was in}} the countryside. Within a year, O'Brien rose from being a country carnival champion to a national-level athlete, despite the death of his father in the same year.|$|E
5|$|As {{the brain}} develops, {{by the fourth}} week of embryological {{development}} three swellings have formed within the embryo around the canal, near where the head will develop. These swellings represent different components of the central nervous system: the prosencephalon, mesencephalon and rhombencephalon. Subarachnoid spaces are first evident around the 32nd day of development near the rhombencephalon; circulation is visible from the 41st day. At this time, the first choroid plexus can be seen, found in the fourth ventricle, although <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>at</b> which they first secrete CSF is not yet known.|$|E
5|$|Diffusion {{of crude}} natural gas through special {{semipermeable}} membranes and other barriers is another method {{to recover and}} purify helium. In 1996, the U.S. had proven helium reserves, in such gas well complexes, of about 147 billion standard cubic feet (4.2 billion SCM). At rates of use at that time (72 million SCM {{per year in the}} U.S.; see pie chart below) this would have been enough helium for about 58 years of U.S. use, and less than this (perhaps 80% of <b>the</b> <b>time)</b> <b>at</b> world use rates, although factors in saving and processing impact effective reserve numbers.|$|E

25|$|PERT and CPM {{are very}} similar in their {{approach}} but still present some differences. CPM is used for projects that assume deterministic activity times; <b>the</b> <b>times</b> <b>at</b> which each activity {{will be carried out}} are known. PERT, on the other hand, allows for stochastic activity times; <b>the</b> <b>times</b> <b>at</b> which each activity will be carried out are uncertain or varied. Because of this core difference, CPM and PERT are used in different contexts. These mathematical techniques quickly spread into many private enterprises.|$|R

At <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>at</b> least 3 to 5in (76 to 127mm) of precipitation was expected, with locally accumulations of up to 8in (203mm). In response, the Government of Cape Verde issued a tropical storm warning for the southern portion of the archipelago, which included Maio, Sao Tiago, Fogo, and Brava. The tropical storm warning remained in effect after Julia intensified into a tropical storm; it was finally discontinued early on September 14.|$|E

5|$|In September 2006, the Government of Croatia {{formed a}} {{construction}} workgroup. It {{was decided that}} the project, estimated at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>at</b> HRK 173 million (US$ 30 million), would be partially financed by the Government of Croatia and the City of Zagreb, and that both Jewish organizations should be represented in the workgroup. However, the involvement of Bet Israel was deemed unacceptable by the Jewish Community of Zagreb, which is the sole owner of the Praška Street property, and which also sees itself as the sole legal representative of the Zagreb Jewish community. As a consequence, the community and its president, Ognjen Kraus, refused further participation in the project under the set conditions.|$|E

5|$|On {{completing}} his novitiate in 1518, Vermigli took the name Peter Martyr after the thirteenth-century Dominican Saint Peter of Verona. The Lateran Congregation had recently decided that promising young ordinands {{should be sent}} to the monastery of Saint John of Verdara in Padua to study Aristotle, so Vermigli was sent there. The University of Padua, with which Saint John of Verdera was loosely affiliated, was a very prestigious institution at <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>At</b> Padua, Vermigli received a thorough training in Thomistic scholasticism and an appreciation for Augustine and Christian humanism. Vermigli was determined to read Aristotle in his original language despite the lack of Greek teachers, so he taught himself. He also made the acquaintance of prominent reform-minded theologians Pietro Bembo, Reginald Pole, and Marcantonio Flaminio.|$|E
5|$|Raynolds {{spent two}} months {{recovering}} from illness after the Valley Campaign, then was assigned as chief engineer of Middle Department and VIII Corps in January 1863.

Lee's second Confederate invasion of the north during the Gettysburg Campaign. On March 31, 1863, the Corps of Topographical Engineers ceased to be an independent branch of the army and was merged into the Corps of Engineers and Raynolds served in that branch of the army for the remainder of his career.
