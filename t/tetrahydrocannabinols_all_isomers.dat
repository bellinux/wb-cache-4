LTM GC is a new approach for modern high speed GC and the technology is to achieve ultrafast temperature programming with an unprecedented cool-down time and a power consumption of approximately 1 % of conventional GC. The chromatographic separation was achieved using a DB- 624 column with ultrafast temperature programming.

Regression analysis showed a correlation coefficient value greater than 0. 999 for <b>all</b> <b>isomers.</b> The detection limit and quantitation limit established for each isomer were 0. 4 ppm and 1. 2 ppm, respectively, indicating high sensitivity of the newly developed LTM GC method.

40|$|In a joint {{experimental}} and theoretical study, the UV/Vis absorption spectra {{of the three}} isomers (ortho, meta, para) of nitrobenzaldehyde (NBA) were analyzed. Absorption spectra are reported for NBA vapors, cyclohexane and acetonitrile solutions. All spectra are poor in vibronic structure and hardly affected in shape by the surroundings (vapor or solution). Moderate solvatochromic shifts of B� 0. 2 eV are measured. For <b>all</b> <b>isomers</b> vertical transition energies, oscillator strengths, and excited state dipole moments were computed using the MS-CASPT 2 /CASSCF and CC 2 methods. Based on these calculations the experimental transitions were assigned. The spectra of <b>all</b> <b>isomers</b> are characterized by weak (emax E 100 M� 1 cm� 1) transitions around 350 nm (3. 6 eV), arising from np* absorptions starting from the lone pairs of the nitro and aldehyde moieties. The next band of intermediate intensity peaking around 300 nm (4. 2 eV, emax E 1000 M� 1 cm� 1) is dominated by pp* excitations within the arene function. Finally, strong absorptions (emax E 10 000 M� 1 cm� 1) were observed around 250 nm (5. 0 eV) which we ascribe to pp* excitations involving the nitro and benzene groups. ...|$|R

40|$|Chloramphenicol is a broad-spectrum {{antibiotic}} with, {{apart from}} its human medicinal use, veterinary abuse in all major food-producing animals. Chloramphenicol occurs in four stereoisomers (all para-nitro substituted) and furthermore four meta-nitro analogs of chloramphenicol exist. In this paper these {{are referred to as}} eight chloramphenicol isomers. According to EU regulations an analytical method should be able to discriminate the analyte from interfering substances that might be present in the sample, including isomers. For the first time a quantitative method for the analysis of trace levels of eight chloramphenicol isomers in urine by chiral liquid chromatography in combination with tandem mass spectrometric detection is reported. The separation of the isomers on the analytical column, the clean-up of urine and the selectivity of the monitored product ions turned out to be critical parameters. To obtain reproducible retention isocratic elution on a chiral AGP column was applied. For urine samples matrix compounds present in the final extract caused decreased retention of the isomers on the chiral stationary phase and a lack of chromatographic resolution. Therefore an extended clean-up procedure that combines solid phase extraction and liquid–liquid extraction had to be developed. The final method was fully validated and showed satisfactory performance for <b>all</b> <b>isomers</b> with decision limits (CCa) ranging from 0. 005 to 0. 03 µg L- 1 and within-laboratory reproducibility of <b>all</b> <b>isomers</b> below 20 % at the minimum required performance limit level of 0. 3 µg L- 1.

40|$|Mixed {{cultures}} of bacteria, enriched from aquatic sediments, grew anaerobically on <b>all</b> three <b>isomers</b> of phthalic acid. Each culture grew anaerobically {{on only one}} isomer and also grew aerobically on the same isomer. Pure cultures were isolated from the phthalic acid (o-phthalic acid) and isophthalic acid (m-phthalic acid) enrichments that grew aerobically on phthalic and isophthalic acids. Cell suspension experiments indicated that protocatechuate is an intermediate of aerobic catabolism. Pure cultures which grew aerobically on terephthalic acid (p-phthalic acid) could not be isolated from the enrichments, and neither could pure cultures that grew anaerobically {{on any of the}} isomers. Cell suspension experiments suggested that separate pathways exist for the aerobic and anaerobic oxidation of phthalic acids. Each enrichment culture used only one phthalic acid isomer under anaerobic conditions, but <b>all</b> <b>isomers</b> were simultaneously adapted for the anaerobic catabolism of benzoate. Cells grown anaerobically on a phthalic acid immediately attacked the isomer under anaerobic conditions, whereas there was a lag before aerobic breakdown occurred, and, for phthalic and terephthalic acids, chloramphenicol stopped aerobic adaptation but had no effect on anaerobic catabolism.

The energies, relative energies, and some geometric parameters of <b>all</b> possible <b>isomers</b> are given and discussed. In the case of both the chloro and fluoro iso-mers the most stable structure is the one having two neighboring axial substituents over the all-equatorial isomer which is usually assumed to be more stable.
