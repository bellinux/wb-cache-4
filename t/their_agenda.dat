5|$|Butler {{participated in}} a series of occupations, police actions, and {{interventions}} by the United States in Central America and the Caribbean, commonly called the Banana Wars because their goal was to protect American commercial interests in the region, particularly those of the United Fruit Company. This company had significant financial stakes in the production of bananas, tobacco, sugar cane, and other products throughout the Caribbean, Central America and the northern portions of South America. The U.S. was also trying to advance its own political interests by maintaining its influence in the region and especially its control of the Panama Canal. These interventions started with the Spanish–American War in 1898 and ended with the withdrawal of troops from Haiti and President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Good Neighbor Policy in 1934. After his retirement, Butler became an outspoken critic of the business interests in the Caribbean, criticizing the ways in which U.S. businesses and Wall Street bankers imposed <b>their</b> <b>agenda</b> on United States foreign policy during this period.|$|E

25|$|Whereas {{there are}} several {{political}} parties and movements in Ukraine that advocate a moderate pro-Russian policy, {{there are also a}} few pro-Russian political organizations that are considered radical by observers. Many of them state <b>their</b> <b>agenda</b> as an opposition to Ukrainian independence and openly advocate for the restoration of the Russian Empire. These movements are numerically small, but their impact on the society is easy to overestimate due to their vocal activity that generates much media coverage and commentary from politicians at the highest levels.|$|E
25|$|The Zürich-wing followingly {{started to}} gain {{ground in the}} party {{at the expense of}} the Bern-wing, and the party became {{increasingly}} centralised as a national party, in contrast to the traditional Swiss system of parties with loose organisational structures and weak central powers. During the 1990s, the party also doubled its number of cantonal branches (to eventually be represented in all cantons), which strengthened the power of the Zürich-wing since most new sections supported <b>their</b> <b>agenda.</b> Although Swiss political parties tended to lack dominant national leaders, Blocher became the de facto leader of the national SVP and one of the most famous Swiss politicians.|$|E

30|$|The macropolitics of education, {{according}} to Alderson (2009), addresses the agendas and issues within {{the purview of}} national or local government (p. 2). While recognizing {{the central role of}} educational policy-making and implementation at the macropolitical level, Alderson (2009) also attaches great weight to individual factors: the personality of the players themselves, their emotions, <b>their</b> ambitions, <b>their</b> <b>agendas</b> and <b>their</b> influence (p. 2). Macro-level educational policy often involves innovations in language education, which requires individuals within an educational institution to respond to and to take actions. It is therefore argued that “politics with a small p includes not only institutional politics, but also personal politics: the motivation of the actors themselves and <b>their</b> <b>agendas.</b> And personal politics can influence language education both in day-to-day affairs, and in projects for innovation and change” (Alderson 2009, p. 3).|$|R
25|$|The Conservatives and Liberal Unionists {{returned}} {{to power in}} the 1895 general election, remaining in office until 1905.

This bred apathy amongst the Irish public towards politics, much needed financial contributions from America ebbing away. In this period of political disarray and disunity of purpose young Irish nationalists turned instead to the country’s’ new cultural and militant movements, enabling the Church to fill the political vacuum.|$|E

A primary element of <b>their</b> <b>agenda</b> was opposition to the principle of episcopal collegiality, which they feared could undermine papal primacy and the rights of individual bishops.
