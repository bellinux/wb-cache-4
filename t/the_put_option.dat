25|$|Another {{very common}} {{strategy}} is the protective put, {{in which a}} trader buys a stock (or holds a previously-purchased long stock position), and buys a put. This strategy acts as an insurance when investing on the underlying stock, hedging the investor's potential loses, but also shrinking an otherwise larger profit, if just purchasing the stock without the put. The maximum profit of a protective put is theoretically unlimited as the strategy involves being long on the underlying stock. The maximum loss {{is limited to the}} purchase price of the underlying stock less the strike price of <b>the</b> <b>put</b> <b>option</b> and the premium paid. A protective put is also known as a married put.|$|E

[...] In June 2002, Clive Calder decided to exercise <b>the</b> <b>put</b> <b>option.</b> [...] Effective 26 November 2002, BMG Entertainment concluded its deal with Zomba for the purchase of the company's entire assets. [...] While Calder had originally requested $3.2 billion for his shares in Zomba, valuation of the label's assets varied from $1.6 billion to $2.4 billion. [...] Following the purchase negotiations, a price of $2.74 billion was agreed upon, the biggest purchase of an independent at the time. [...] Zomba's sale had been {{the latest in a series}} of independent label sellouts including Island Records and Geffen Records (both sold to Universal for $300 million and $550 million respectively), and Virgin (sold for $950 million to EMI).

50|$|A risk {{reversal}} is {{a position}} which simulates {{profit and loss}} behavior of owning an underlying security; therefore it is sometimes called a synthetic long. This is an investment strategy that amounts to both buying and selling out-of-money options simultaneously. In this strategy, the investor will first make a market hunch; if that hunch is bullish he will want to go long. However, instead of going long on the stock, he will buy an {{out of the money}} call option, and simultaneously sell an out of the money put option. Presumably he will use the money from the sale of <b>the</b> <b>put</b> <b>option</b> to purchase the call option.

40|$|American {{options are}} the most {{commonly}} traded financial derivatives in the market. Pricing these options fairly, {{so as to avoid}} arbitrage, is of paramount importance. Closed form solutions for American <b>put</b> <b>options</b> cannot be utilised in practice and so numerical techniques are employed. This thesis looks at the work done by other researchers to find an analytic solution to <b>the</b> American <b>put</b> <b>option</b> pricing problem and suggests a practical method, that uses Monte Carlo simulation, to approximate <b>the</b> American <b>put</b> <b>option</b> price. <b>The</b> theory behind option pricing is first discussed using a discrete model. Once the concepts of arbitrage-free pricing and hedging have been dealt with, this model is extended to a continuous-time setting. Martingale theory is introduced to <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>option</b> pricing theory in a more formal framework. The construction of a hedging portfolio is discussed in detail and it is shown how financial derivatives are priced according to a unique riskneutral probability measure. Black-Scholes model is discussed and utilised to find closed form solutions to European style options. American options are discussed in detail and it is shown that under certain conditions, American style options can be solved according to closed form solutions. Various numerical techniques are presented to approximate <b>the</b> true American <b>put</b> <b>option</b> price. Chief among these methods is the Richardson extrapolation on a sequence of Bermudan options method that was developed by Geske and Johnson. This model is extended to a Repeated-Richardson extrapolation technique. Finally, a Monte Carlo simulation is used to approximate Bermudan <b>put</b> <b>options.</b> These values are then extrapolated to approximate the price of an American <b>put</b> <b>option.</b> <b>The</b> use of extrapolation techniques was hampered by the presence of non-uniform convergence of <b>the</b> Bermudan <b>put</b> <b>option</b> sequence.
