5|$|To learn whether errors {{actually}} {{existed in}} Lilienthal's data tables, the brothers used a bicycle {{for a new}} type of experiment. They made a model-size airfoil and a counter-acting flat plate, both according to dimensions Lilienthal had specified, and attached them to an extra bicycle wheel, which they mounted horizontally in front of the handlebars. Pedaling strenuously on a local street to create airflow over the apparatus, they observed that the <b>third</b> <b>wheel</b> rotated against the airfoil instead of remaining motionless as Lilienthal's formula predicted. The experiment confirmed their suspicion that either the standard Smeaton coefficient or Lilienthal's coefficients of lift and drag–or all of them–were in error.|$|E
25|$|Even {{if there}} were {{exceedingly}} few things in a finite space in an infinite time, {{they would not have}} to repeat in the same configurations. Suppose there were three wheels of equal size, rotating on the same axis, one point marked on the circumference of each wheel, and these three points lined up in one straight line. If the second wheel rotated twice as fast as the first, and if the speed of the <b>third</b> <b>wheel</b> was 1/π of the speed of the first, the initial line-up would never recur.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the ancient}} {{descriptions}} suggest that some south-pointing chariots could move in only three ways: straight ahead, or turning left or right with a fixed radius of curvature. A <b>third</b> <b>wheel</b> might {{have been used to}} fix the turning radius. If the chariot was turning, the pointing doll was connected by gears to one or other of the two main road wheels (e.g. whichever was {{on the outside of the}} curve around which the chariot was moving) so the doll rotated at a fixed speed, relative to the rate of the chariot's movement, to compensate for the predetermined rate of turn. The doll turned in opposite directions depending on which road wheel was connected to it, so its rotation compensated for the chariot turning left or right. This design would have been simpler than using a differential gear.|$|E

25|$|Testing of the 40.08 Luftkreuzer {{began on}} 8 June 1916 {{at the airport}} in Aszód. It was {{immediately}} clear that the machine suffered from a centre of gravity that was too high and too far forward. The aircraft was damaged when it nosed over during ground testing and was redesigned with a <b>third</b> <b>wheel</b> under the nose, similar to the Zeppelin-Staaken R.XIV, to prevent tipping forward.In October 1916 Oberleutnant Antal Lany-Lanczendorfer attempted the first flight but the aircraft was unable to leave the ground. Early in November the Fliegerarsenal (FlArs) considered reducing the bomb load, and in December additional chassis rails were added to the main undercarriage. Development continued slowly but many of the design flaws would never be solved. Lloyd applied for a revision of the airplane in March 1917, but the application was denied and all work halted. The Luftkreuzer was placed in storage and in January 1918 it was ordered to be transported to the aircraft scrapyard at Cheb.|$|E

500|$|Barney was {{notoriously}} non-monogamous, a {{fact that}} the other two women had to accept. Brooks met Barney in 1916, {{at a time when the}} writer had already been involved for about seven years with Duchess Elisabeth de Gramont, also known as Lily or Elisabeth de Clermont-Tonnerre. She was married and the mother of two daughters. After a brief dust-up that resulted in Barney's offering Gramont a marriage contract while at the same time refusing to give up Brooks, the three women formed a stable lifelong triangle in which none was a <b>third</b> <b>wheel.</b> Gramont, one of the most glamorous taste-makers and aristocrats of the period, summed up their values when she said, [...] "Civilized beings are those who know how to take more from life than others." [...] Gender fluidity and sexual freedom were paramount among women of Brooks' circle. [...] Barney hosted a literary salon on Paris's Left Bank.|$|E

Todd McCarthy of Variety felt her character was [...] "not very well integrated into the rest of the story, a shortcoming the normally resourceful McAdams is unable to do much about". A. O. Scott of The New York Times stated, [...] "Ms.McAdams is a perfectly charming actress and performs gamely as the <b>third</b> <b>wheel</b> of this action-bromance tricycle. But Irene feels in this movie more like a somewhat cynical commercial contrivance.

500|$|... "New Year's Eve" [...] {{received}} several positive reviews from critics. New York writer Steven Heisler praised the episode for avoiding [...] "sitcom-y territory" [...] {{with the emotional}} ending. He also called the series a better choice to follow The Office then Whitney. The A.V. Club reviewer Margaret Eby complemented the believability of the main Reagen-Chris plot. Despite this, she criticized the Ava-Kevin subplot comparing it to a storyline from Sex and The City. She also noted the plotline didn't stay true to the characters following their plotline in the previous episode, [...] "First Christmas". She ultimately rated the episode with a B. Adam Victavage of Paste called the episode a perfect transition from the previous episodes and allowed Ava to be [...] "a loveable <b>third</b> <b>wheel</b> to a completely strong duo in Chris and Reagan". He also reacted positively for the scenes featuring Missy, comparing her scenes to [...] "early Ava, but less obnoxious". He ultimately gave the episode an 8.7/10 calling it [...] "commendable". Bradford Evans of SplitSider praised Jennifer Hall's performance calling her the [...] "unsung hero" [...] of the series. He also reacted positively towards the episode's ability to unify the show and [...] "keep all of the characters on the same turf". He concluded that he hoped the series could make itself {{a vital part of}} the network's lineup. HitFix reviewer Alan Sepinwall called the episode [...] "one its [...] strongest episodes to date". He wrote that the addition of Jason Lee humanized Ava more and gave her a more natural reason to visit Reagan and Chris at home. He also wrote that the episode worked on a [...] "character level".|$|E
500|$|Affleck {{reunited with}} {{director}} Michael Bay for the critically derided war drama Pearl Harbor (2001). He later characterized it {{as a film}} he did [...] "for money– for the wrong reasons". A.O. Scott of The New York Times felt Affleck and Kate Beckinsale [...] "do what they can with their lines, and glow with the satiny shine of real movie stars". But Todd McCarthy of Variety said, [...] "the blandly handsome Affleck couldn’t convince that he’d ever so much as been turned down for a date, much less lost {{the love of his}} life to his best friend". Affleck then parodied Good Will Hunting with Damon and Van Sant in Kevin Smith's Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001), made a cameo in the comedy Daddy and Them (2001), and had a supporting role in the little-seen The <b>Third</b> <b>Wheel</b> (2002). He portrayed the CIA analyst Jack Ryan in the thriller The Sum of All Fears (2002). Stephen Holden of The New York Times felt he was miscast in a role previously played by both Harrison Ford and Alec Baldwin: [...] "Although Mr. Affleck can be appealing when playing earnest young men groping toward maturity, he simply lacks the gravitas for the role." [...] Affleck had an [...] "amazing experience" [...] making the thriller Changing Lanes (2002), and later cited Roger Michell as someone he learned from as a director. Robert Koehler of Variety described it as one of the actor's [...] "most thoroughly wrought" [...] performances: [...] "The journey into a moral fog compels him to play more inwardly and thoughtfully than he ever has before." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{tinkering}} with the project for a further three weeks, the Department returned to the beach. Panjandrum was now equipped with over seventy cordite rockets and a stabilising <b>third</b> <b>wheel.</b> When launched, it hurtled towards the coast, skimming the beach before turning back out to sea. A number of the [...] rockets detached and whipped wildly above {{the heads of the}} gathered audience or exploded underwater. Despite these failures, Shute and his team persevered, removing the <b>third</b> <b>wheel</b> and attaching steel cables to the remaining two wheels as a basic form of steering. Panjandrum proved to be too powerful however, snapping the cables and whipping them back across the beach when they were used. More weeks were spent testing every conceivable variable from thicker cables to heavier rocket-clamps without success before the DMWD received notification that the weapon was only required to be consistently able to travel {{in the general direction of}} the enemy. With some degree of confidence, a final trial was scheduled to be performed in January 1944, in front of a number of Navy officials and scientists, as well as an official photographer.|$|E

His team protested the sprint, but the race commissaires took no further action. Sánchez moved into second place overall behind Wiggins; a ten-second bonus for winning the stage reduced his deficit to Wiggins to just one second.|$|E
2500|$|The Clarkson wind engine {{consisted}} of a rotor or a number of rotors, one behind the other, revolving in a casing with fixed guide vanes between and of opposite pitch {{to those of the}} rotors, and having a further casing to admit a fresh supply of wind to the rotors behind. The cylindrical casings are open at each end with a larger opening facing the wind. The wind catches a number of wheels and feathered vanes fixed to a shaft revolving in bearings inside the casings. When the wind has passed between the vanes of the front wheel it is directed by the guide vanes to the second wheel and is again taken up by guides and passed to a <b>third</b> <b>wheel</b> and so on, the action each time increasing the effect of the wind on the shaft and improving efficiency. The Clarkson of which an illustration survives (1919) was erected by the Air Power Co. of Prestwich, Cheshire on the estate of Lord Derby.

50|$|The {{department}} {{produced a}} larger hull by adapting the long-travel five-wheel Christie suspension {{used on the}} Comet {{with the addition of}} a sixth wheel, and extending the spacing between the second and <b>third</b> <b>wheels.</b> The Christie suspension, with vertical spring coils between side armour plates, was replaced by a Horstmann suspension with three horizontally sprung, externally mounted two-wheel bogies on each side. The Horstmann design did not offer the same ride quality as the Christie system, but took up less room and was easier to maintain. In case of damage by mines, individual suspension and wheel units could be replaced relatively easily. The hull was redesigned with welded, sloped armour and featured a partially cast turret with the highly regarded 17 pounder (76.2 mm/3 inch) as the main gun and a 20 mm Polsten cannon in an independent mounting to its left. With a Rover-built Rolls-Royce Meteor engine, as used on the Comet and Cromwell, the new design would have excellent performance.|$|R
