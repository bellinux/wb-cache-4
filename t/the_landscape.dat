30|$|Productivity {{is higher}} in <b>the</b> Nilgiri <b>landscape,</b> whereas <b>the</b> low {{rainfall}} in <b>the</b> Sathyamangalam <b>landscape</b> {{has resulted in the}} domination of tropical dry thorn forests. The higher fuel loads in the tropical deciduous forests in <b>the</b> Nilgiri <b>landscape</b> could be driving the frequent fires in <b>the</b> Nilgiri <b>landscape,</b> as <b>the</b> mean fire-return interval is seven times more frequent than for <b>the</b> Sathyamangalam <b>landscape.</b> In <b>the</b> Sathyamangalam <b>landscape,</b> most fires occur in the tropical deciduous forests that are found at medium elevations, which receive higher rainfall. A few high elevation grassland patches (Sukumar et al. 1995) are also distributed in <b>the</b> Sathyamangalam <b>landscape.</b> <b>The</b> higher dead fuel loads in the tropical dry thorn forests in <b>the</b> Sathyamangalam <b>landscape</b> could be due to the higher biotic pressures in the forests (Reddy et al. 2012).|$|R

30|$|Tropical dry {{forests and}} savannas {{constitute}} {{more than half}} of all tropical forests and grasslands, but little is known about forest fire regimes within these two extensive types of ecosystems. Forest fire regimes in a predominantly dry forest in India, <b>the</b> Nilgiri <b>landscape,</b> and a predominantly savanna ecosystem in <b>the</b> Sathyamangalam <b>landscape,</b> were examined. Remote sensing data were applied to delineate burned areas, determine fire size characteristics, and to estimate fire-rotation intervals. Belt transects (0.5 ha) were used to estimate forest structure, diversity, and fuel loads. Mean area burned, mean number of fires, and mean fire size per year were substantially higher in <b>the</b> Nilgiri <b>landscape</b> compared to <b>the</b> Sathyamangalam <b>landscape.</b> Mean fire-rotational interval was 7.1 yr in <b>the</b> Nilgiri <b>landscape</b> and 44.1 yr in <b>the</b> Sathyamangalam <b>landscape.</b> Tree (‚â• 10 cm diameter at breast height) species diversity, tree density, and basal area were significantly higher in <b>the</b> Nilgiri <b>landscape</b> compared to <b>the</b> Sathyamangalam <b>landscape.</b> Total fuel loads were significantly higher in tropical dry and moist deciduous forests in <b>the</b> Nilgiri <b>landscape,</b> but total fuel loads were higher in the tropical dry thorn forests of <b>the</b> Sathyamangalam <b>landscape.</b> Thus, <b>the</b> two <b>landscapes</b> revealed contrasting fire regimes and forest characteristics, with more and four-fold larger fires in <b>the</b> Nilgiri <b>landscape.</b> <b>The</b> dry forests and savannas could be maintained by a combination of factors, such as fire, grazing pressures, and herbivore populations. Understanding the factors maintaining these two ecosystems will be critical for their conservation.|$|R
30|$|Forest {{fires are}} annual {{disturbance}} events in <b>the</b> two <b>landscapes</b> dominated by dry forests and savannas in the WG (Kodandapani et al. 2004). Contrasting fire metrics occurred across <b>the</b> two <b>landscapes,</b> especially {{with reference to}} the mFRI, the mean fire size, and the largest fire size in <b>the</b> two <b>landscapes.</b> <b>The</b> fire size distribution was similar in both of <b>the</b> <b>landscapes,</b> in <b>the</b> sense that small fires (‚â§ 10 ha) are abundant. Although <b>the</b> two <b>landscapes</b> are different in terms of their protected area histories, this alone may not be the chief reason for the large differences in the magnitude of the forest fire regimes. A combination of climate, fuels, and topography, as well as ignition sources, could be driving these patterns of wildland fires in <b>the</b> two <b>landscapes</b> (Renard et al. 2012).|$|R
