5|$|After {{the tests}} have been satisfactorily completed, a {{cylinder}} passing the <b>test</b> <b>will</b> be marked accordingly. Stamp marking {{will include the}} registered mark of the inspection facility and the date of testing (month and year). Records of a periodic inspection and test are made by the test station and kept available for inspection. These include: If a cylinder fails inspection or testing and cannot be recovered, the owner must be notified before making the empty cylinder unserviceable.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} the test {{is to ensure that}} the right to equal {{protection}} is upheld by guarding against three forms of arbitrariness. First, individuals in the same class must share common features and should not be classified arbitrarily. Secondly, the treatment of persons falling within the same class must not be arbitrary. Lastly, the basis of classification must not be arbitrary but should bear a reasonable relationship to the object of the executive action. The stages of the rational nexus test directly address these forms of arbitrariness. As such, a law that satisfies all the stages of the <b>test</b> <b>will</b> be found to be valid and constitutional.|$|E
5|$|Several {{relatively}} simple chemical tests — commercially available as reagent testing kits — {{can be used}} to assess the presence of psilocybin in extracts prepared from mushrooms. The drug reacts in the Marquis test to produce a yellow color, and a green color in the Mandelin test. Neither of these tests, however, is specific for psilocybin; for example, the Marquis <b>test</b> <b>will</b> react with many classes of controlled drugs, such as those containing primary amino groups and unsubstituted benzene rings, including amphetamine and methamphetamine. Ehrlich's reagent and DMACA reagent are used as chemical sprays to detect the drug after thin layer chromatography. Many modern techniques of analytical chemistry have been used to quantify psilocybin levels in mushroom samples. Although the earliest methods commonly used gas chromatography, the high temperature required to vaporize the psilocybin sample prior to analysis causes it to spontaneously lose its phosphoryl group and become psilocin — making it difficult to chemically discriminate between the two drugs. In forensic toxicology, techniques involving gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC–MS) are the most widely used due to their high sensitivity and ability to separate compounds in complex biological mixtures. These techniques include ion mobility spectrometry, capillary zone electrophoresis, ultraviolet spectroscopy, and infrared spectroscopy. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is used with ultraviolet, fluorescence, electrochemical, and electrospray mass spectrometric detection methods.|$|E

25|$|False negatives produce {{serious and}} counter-intuitive problems, {{especially}} when the condition being searched for is common. If a test with a false negative rate of only 10%, is used to test a population with a true occurrence rate of 70%, many of the negatives detected by the <b>test</b> <b>will</b> be false.|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} gives {{instructions for}} the Operability Testing of the Rotary Mode Core Sampling (RMCS) System No. 3. This document {{is based on the}} Operability Test Procedure for RMCS system No. 2 because the basic design is the same for all three systems. Modifications have been made from the original design only when exact duplication was not feasible or design improvements could be incorporated without affecting the operation of the system. Operability testing of the Rotary Mode Core Sampling System No. 3, will verify that functional and operational requirements have been met. <b>Testing</b> <b>will</b> be completed in two phases. The first phase of <b>testing</b> (section 7) <b>will</b> involve operating the truck equipment to demonstrate its capabilities. The second phase of <b>testing</b> (section 8) <b>will</b> take repeated samples in a simulated operation environment. These <b>tests</b> <b>will</b> be conducted at the ``Rock Slinger`` test site located just south of U-Plant in the 200 West Area. <b>Tests</b> <b>will</b> be done in a simulated tank farm environment.

25|$|The first Asian probe {{that was}} part of a lunar landing program was the Indian Moon Impact Probe (MIP) {{released}} from Chandrayaan-1 in 2008. MIP was a hard lander and was designed to move the ground under for research purposes. MIP was designed to be destroyed at impact. Its instruments performed lunar observations to within 25 minutes before impact. The landing <b>test</b> <b>will</b> be applied to future soft landings such as Chandrayaan-2, planned for 2016.|$|E
25|$|False positives {{can also}} produce serious and counter-intuitive {{problems}} when the condition being searched for is rare, as in screening. If a test has a false positive {{rate of one}} in ten thousand, but only {{one in a million}} samples (or people) is a true positive, most of the positives detected by that <b>test</b> <b>will</b> be false. The probability that an observed positive result is a false positive may be calculated using Bayes' theorem.|$|E
