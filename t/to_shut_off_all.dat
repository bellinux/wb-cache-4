For many years, the people of these planets lived in harmony together with the seemingly more advanced Parcerians continually visiting the Senecans. However, something happened on Parceria: something caused the Parcerians <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>off</b> <b>all</b> forms of communication, visitation and activity with Seneca. Over time, Parceria's environment died out, leaving only a planet-wide barren terrain. Hundreds of years have now passed and the current generation of Senecans see Parceria as nothing but a dead husk with the concept of life and companionship on it being mere, long forgotten legends.|$|E
50|$|The {{vacuum system}} {{provided}} a physical buffer between the precision {{movements of the}} capstan and the large movements of the reels by storing a short length of tape in the vacuum column under relatively low tension. The vacuum columns were chambers open at one end, the openings being {{in line with the}} tape path before and after the capstan and roller assemblies. The amount of tape in the column was controlled by four optical or vacuum sensors {{on the sides of the}} columns. The control electronics kept the curve of the tape loop between the two inner sensors, cueing the supply reel to feed more or the take-up reel to take more as necessary. The outer two sensors, at the very top and bottom of the columns, served to sense malfunctions in the feed mechanism during operation, prompting the control electronics <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>off</b> <b>all</b> operation of the tape transport and vacuum system to prevent damaging the tape. Because of the tension provided by the vacuum columns and the design of the tape path, tape was usually kept in sufficient contact with the relatively high-friction coating on the capstan that a pinch roller was not used.|$|E

5000|$|The {{district}} court (Judge Stanley Weigel) {{held that the}} legal significance of the repeated case-by-case requests for approval to bid [...] "depends {{on the state of}} mind of Melco and MHI in seeking Westinghouse approval." [...] The court refused to infer the existence of an illegal agreement not to compete in the United States. It agreed with the defendants that Melco and MHI did not refrain from competing in the United States on the basis of an illegal agreement with Westinghouse but rather out of fear of infringing Westinghouse patents. The court dismissed the contention that the grant of a patent license outside the United States coupled with case-by-case and customer-by-customer approvals or denials of bid permission violated § 1 of the Sherman Act. The court approved instead the argument that [...] "a patentee's right <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>off</b> <b>all</b> competition must necessarily include the lesser right to restrict the exercise of the granted privilege so long as the patentee does not attach a condition that enlarges his monopoly beyond that given by the patent statute and the patent itself." [...] The court dismissed the case.|$|E

I was very pleased and accepted the offer. a short time later I realized that I had my weekly duty (of shutting the bases lights) that evening. Stupidly I decided to take the risk; I asked a friend of mine <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>off</b> <b>all</b> the naval base lights that night as required by law. For some unexplainable reason he forgot. The lights of the base were illegally on until finally shut off by other on duty sailors.Naval Officers immediately investigated the matter and my 'so called' friend, of necessity, had to fully explain where I was that evening. Marine Corps personnel were sent to the burlesque house to bring me back. Although I spent the rest of the night in the 'Naval Detention Center', the connections I made through my performances got me off the hook, but I still vowed to never again disobey naval regulations, which I thankfully never did."(Maury Deutsch) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{decision}} in Johnson v. Lake Drunmond Canal and Water Company (I 919. Va.) 99 S. E. 771, seems both unjust and unnecessary. It appears that in 1787 the Virginia legislature incorporated a canal company {{to erect a}} canal which should 2 ̆ 2 forever after 2 ̆ 2 be a public highway, free for transportation of goods and for travel on payment of the tolls imposed by the act of incorporation. In 1839 another act was passed authorizing the same company to construct an outlet from its canal to the Elizabeth river and granting it the power of eminent domain, provided, however, that the proprietors of abutting land should have free passage through the outlet. Prior {{to the construction of}} the outlet these lands either bordered on or were intersected by navigable creeks or streams reaching deep water and thus giving deep water access. The building of the outlet or canal completely destroyed these creeks or streams and the proviso of the Act of 1839 was inserted in order to give abutting proprietors deep water access through the canal in place of the access which was being destroyed. Soon thereafter the outlet was completed and the privilege of passage has been used by abutting proprietors, deep water access adding greatly to the value of the lands. In 1851 a railroad was given permission by the legislature to erect drawbridges across the outlet, but so as not to hinder, obstruct or delay passage of any craft on the canal; and if any such inconvenience resulted from the construction of the road, it was to be declared a nuisance and abated by the circuit court. In 1916 the latter portion of this Act was repealed and defendant canal company, who had succeeded the original canal company, was authorized by the legislature to abandon maintenance and operation of this portion of the canal or of so much of it as it deemed desirable. The defendant canal company has now sold to the defendant railroad the privilege of crossing the outlet by a permanent fill, bridge or obstruction and the railroad proposes to cross the outlet in this manner, so as completely <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>off</b> <b>all</b> passage through it at the point of crossing. The plaintiffs, abutting landowners, bring this bill for an injunction which the court dismisses on the defendants 2 ̆ 7 demurrer...|$|E

5000|$|There are {{two main}} {{categories}} of sliding sleeves: open/close and choking. Open/close sleeves are shifted between a full open position and a closed position.

Hydraulically actuated sleeves are more complicated but can be actuated from a small pump at surface. King sleeves can be used to regulate the pressure between two or more zones. They are also used to regulate the flow of fluid into a well during proppant fracturing or hydraulic fracturing operations. Choking sleeves are all hydraulically actuated and have a much more complex design than open/close sleeves.|$|R
