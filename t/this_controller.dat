500|$|Released in 1994, the PlayStation {{control pad}} {{was the first}} {{controller}} made for the original PlayStation. It featured a basic design of a D-pad, 4 main select buttons ( [...] ('Green Triangle'), [...] ('Red Circle/Red O')), [...] ('Blue Cross/Blue X') and [...] ('Pink Square'), [...] and start and select buttons on the face. 'Shoulder buttons' are also featured on the top [...] (named by the side [...] and 1 and 2 [...] ). In 1996, Sony released the PlayStation Analog Joystick for use with flight simulation games.

2500|$|To do this, a {{controller}} {{with the}} requisite corrective behaviour is required. <b>This</b> <b>controller</b> monitors the controlled process variable (PV), and compares {{it with the}} reference or set point (SP). The difference between actual and desired value of the process variable, called the error signal, or SP-PV error, is applied as feedback to generate a control action to bring the controlled process variable to the same value as the set point. Other aspects which are also studied are [...] controllability and observability. On this is based the advanced type of automation that revolutionized manufacturing, aircraft, communications and other industries. This is feedback control, which is usually continuous and involves taking measurements using a sensor and making calculated adjustments to keep the measured variable within a set range {{by means of a}} [...] "final control element", such as a control valve.|$|E

2500|$|In North America, Westinghouse Air Brake {{supplied}} High Speed Control {{brake equipment}} for several post-World War II streamlined passenger trains. [...] This was an electrically controlled overlay on conventional D-22 passenger and 24-RL locomotive brake equipment. [...] On the conventional side, {{the control valve}} set a reference pressure in a volume, which set brake cylinder pressure via a relay valve. On the electric side, pressure from a second straight-air trainline controlled the relay valve via a two-way check valve. This [...] "straight air" [...] trainline was charged (from reservoirs on each car) and released by magnet valves on each car, controlled electrically by a 3 wire trainline, in turn controlled by an [...] "electro-pneumatic master controller" [...] in the controlling locomotive. <b>This</b> <b>controller</b> compared the pressure in the straight air trainline with that supplied by a self lapping portion of the engineers valve, signaling all of the [...] "apply" [...] or [...] "release" [...] magnets valves in the train to open simultaneously, changing the pressure in the [...] "straight air" [...] trainline much more rapidly and evenly than possible by simply supplying air directly from the locomotive. The relay valve was equipped with four diaphragms, magnet valves, electric control equipment, and an axle-mounted speed sensor, so that at speeds over [...] full braking force was applied, and reduced in steps at [...] , bringing the train to a gentle stop. [...] Each axle was also equipped with anti-lock brake equipment. [...] The combination minimized braking distances, allowing more full-speed running between stops. The [...] "straight air" [...] (electro-pneumatic trainline), [...] anti-lock, and speed graduating portions of the system were not dependent on each other in any way, and {{any or all of}} these options could be supplied separately.|$|E

40|$|A model-based {{controller}} architecture for Fault-Tolerant Control (FTC) {{is presented}} in <b>this</b> paper. The <b>controller</b> architecture {{is based on a}} general controller parameterization. The FTC architecture consists of two main parts, a Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) part and a controller reconfiguration part. The theoretical basis for the architecture is given followed by an investigation of the single parts in the architecture. It is shown that the general controller parameterization is central in connection with both fault diagnosis as well as controller reconfiguration. Especially in relation to the controller reconfiguration part, the application of controller parameterization results in a systematic technique for switching between different <b>controllers.</b> <b>This</b> also allows <b>controller</b> switching using different sets of actuators and sensors...|$|R
