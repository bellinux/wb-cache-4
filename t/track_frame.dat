500|$|Roberts {{continued}} his road racing successes in 1975, winning {{three out of}} four races in the 1975 Transatlantic Match races. After having won the national championship in 1974, Roberts faced an increasingly difficult battle in dirt track races, as Harley-Davidson continued to improve their XR-750 dirt tracker while Yamaha struggled to maintain the pace. Roberts made up for his bike's lack of power with an almost fearless, determined riding style. He battled Harley-Davidson factory rider Gary Scott throughout the 1975 season but mechanical breakdowns hampered his title defense. He had been leading the Daytona 200 when mechanical problems yielded the victory to his Yamaha teammate Gene Romero. At the Ascot TT, Roberts battled from 17th place to take the lead before a broken sprocket ended his race. Roberts' fearless riding style was highlighted at the Indy Mile Grand National. In a desperate effort to keep Scott within reach in the points chase, Yamaha wedged a Yamaha TZ750 two-stroke road racing engine inside a dirt <b>track</b> <b>frame.</b> On a bike that was considered unrideable due to its excessive horsepower, Roberts came from behind on the two-stroke, and overtook the factory Harley-Davidson duo of Corky Keener and Jay Springsteen on the last lap {{for one of the most}} famous wins in American dirt track racing history. Afterward, Roberts was famously quoted as saying, [...] "They [...] pay me enough to ride that thing". Despite accomplishing another Grand Slam, this time in only one season, Roberts lost his crown, finishing second to Gary Scott in the 1975 national championship.|$|E
50|$|A <b>track</b> <b>frame</b> is {{specific}} to its intended use, {{with emphasis on}} rigidity and lightness. Frames for sprinting seek to maximize rigidity, while those for general racing seek to reduce aerodynamic drag.|$|E
50|$|In 1988, Corima diversified into carbon {{composite}} parts and its first product for cycling : the disc wheel. This {{was followed by}} the 4-spoke wheel, the Puma monocoque frame, the Aero wheel, the Ellipse seatpost and others to create a range of carbon products. In 1994, Corima expanded to frames, achieving success with the Puma, an aerodynamic carbon monocoque road frame with a steeply sloping top tube, based on the custom <b>track</b> <b>frame</b> ridden by Chris Boardman in 1993. However, production was discontinued in 1999, due to revised UCI rules that rendered the Puma's geometry inconsistent with racing frame guidelines. This banning from competition meant limited exposure and sponsorships. Corima continued making a <b>track</b> <b>frame</b> with similar geometry and sloping top tube - the Cougar - until it was replaced by the VIF frame.|$|E
50|$|Miles {{lived in}} St Albans Hertfordshire where {{he ran a}} cycle shop in Victoria Street and {{customised}} both road and <b>track</b> <b>frames.</b>|$|R
50|$|Typical <b>track</b> <b>frames</b> use 120mm spacing for {{the rear}} hub. The {{dropouts}} or track ends face rearwards to facilitate chain tension adjustment.|$|R
25|$|Aluminium is {{the most}} {{commonly}} extruded material. Aluminium can be hot or cold extruded. If it is hot extruded it is heated to 575 to 1100nbsp&°F (300 to 600nbsp&°C). Examples of products include profiles for <b>tracks,</b> <b>frames,</b> rails, mullions, and heat sinks.|$|R
50|$|The {{two main}} {{sections}} of an excavator are the undercarriage and the house. The undercarriage includes the blade (if fitted), tracks, <b>track</b> <b>frame,</b> and final drives, {{which have a}} hydraulic motor and gearing providing the drive to the individual tracks, and the house includes the operator cab, counterweight, engine, fuel and hydraulic oil tanks. The house attaches to the undercarriage {{by way of a}} center pin. High pressure oil is supplied to the tracks' hydraulic motors through a hydraulic swivel at the axis of the pin, allowing the machine to slew 360° unhindered.|$|E
5000|$|Company {{photographer}} Charles Clements {{was reported}} to have observed that the tractor crawled like a caterpillar, and Holt seized on the metaphor. [...] "Caterpillar it is. That's the name for it!" [...] Some sources, though, attribute this name to British soldiers in July 1907. Two years later Holt sold his first steam-powered tractor crawlers for US$5,500, about US$128,000 today. Each side featured a <b>track</b> <b>frame</b> measured 30 in high by 42 in wide and were 9 ft long. The tracks were 3 in by 4 in redwood slats.|$|E
5000|$|The flame thrower, {{located in}} the front cabin, had a range of 90 ft; {{additionally}} there were four [...]30 cal. machine guns; two in a sponson at each side. The length of the vehicle was 34 feet 9 inches, the width 12 feet 6 inches and the height 10 feet 4.5 inches. The tracks were 24 inches wide. Each <b>track</b> <b>frame</b> carried mud clearing spikes, sometimes mistaken for battering rams. The tank had a weight of about fifty short tons. There {{was to have been}} a crew of eight, on the assumption there were a commander, a driver, an operator of the flame thrower, a mechanic and four machine gunners.|$|E

25|$|<b>Track</b> <b>frames</b> {{have much}} in common with road and time trial frames, but come with rear-facing, {{horizontal}} fork ends, rather than dropouts, to allow one to adjust the position of the rear wheel horizontally to set the proper chain tension. Also the seat tube angle is steeper than on road racing bikes.|$|R
5000|$|Wilson {{was unhappy}} with the basic concept of the Number 1 Lincoln Machine, and on 17 August {{suggested}} to Tritton {{the idea of using}} tracks that ran all around the vehicle. With d'Eyncourt's approval construction of an improved prototype began on 17 September. For this second prototype (later known as [...] "HMLS Majesty's Land Ship Centipede", and, later still, [...] "Mother"), a rhomboid <b>track</b> <b>frame</b> was fitted, taking the tracks up and {{over the top of the}} vehicle. The rear steering wheels were retained in an improved form, but the idea of a turret was abandoned and the main armament placed in side sponsons.|$|E
50|$|The front section, an {{open area}} between the tracks, was flanked by tall narrow structures, above {{the front of the}} <b>track</b> <b>frame</b> at each side, that acted as {{armoured}} cabs for driver on the left and brakesman to the right. In the prototype these driving positions had been {{directly in front of the}} superstructure; moving them forward greatly improved visibility, but made communication very difficult. This arrangement had obvious disadvantages where, as in the Mark I, four men, including the gearsmen, had to coordinate their actions to drive and manoeuvre a most ungainly vehicle. Between these two structures lay a low-slung pivoting platform able to accommodate a 60-pounder (5-inch) gun, a 6-inch 26 cwt howitzer or any equivalent in stores or personnel.|$|E
50|$|For Athletics {{competition}} a six-lane, banked 200-meter oval {{is installed}} on the arena floor. According to an IAAF press release, the athletics track at the ERGO Arena, the venue for the 2014 IAAF World Indoor Championships, was officially opened for the 2014 season on Sunday 16 February and almost 6,000 people came {{to get a glimpse}} of the new track. Italian company Mondo made the indoor portable banked track with a Mondo Super X rubberized surface (13.5mm thick). Mondo's portable tracks can be assembled and disassembled in a matter of days. The company's claw locking mechanism locks the modular <b>track</b> <b>frame</b> in place without the use of screws or bolts, guaranteeing constant clamping force and perfect accuracy from panel to panel, and from installation to installation. Mondo's world-renowned Super X surface has been the world's top track for more than 30 years and was used at both the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics.|$|E
50|$|A {{direct hit}} by an {{artillery}} or mortar shell could cause the fuel tanks (which were placed {{high in the}} front horns of the <b>track</b> <b>frames</b> {{either side of the}} drivers' area, to allow gravity feed) to burst open. Incinerated crews were removed by special Salvage Companies, who also salvaged damaged tanks.|$|R
50|$|<b>Track</b> <b>frames</b> {{have much}} in common with road and time trial frames, but come with rear-facing, {{horizontal}} fork ends, rather than dropouts, to allow one to adjust the position of the rear wheel horizontally to set the proper chain tension.

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{technique}} for acquiring detailed facial geometry of a dynamic performance using extended spherical gradient illumination. Key to our method {{is a new}} algorithm for jointly aligning two photographs, under a gradient illumination condition and its complement, to a full-on <b>tracking</b> <b>frame,</b> providing dense temporal correspondences under changing lighting conditions. We employ a two-step algorithm to reconstruct detailed geometry for every captured frame. In the first step, we coalesce information from the gradient illumination frames to the full-on <b>tracking</b> <b>frame,</b> and form a temporally aligned photometric normal map, which is subsequently combined with dense stereo correspondences yielding a detailed geometry. In a second step, we propagate the detailed geometry back to every captured instance guided by the previously computed dense correspondences. We demonstrate reconstructed dynamic facial geometry, captured using moderate to video rates of acquisition, for every captured frame...|$|R
50|$|In {{its second}} meeting on 22 July 1938, some troubling data were considered. Most bridges could carry a maximum single vehicle load of 35 tons, so the new tank {{would have to}} cross rivers on special pontoons. German tank moats were {{discovered}} to have a design width of about seven metres, so a very long vehicle seemed to be necessary. Existing rail road cars could carry a maximum of 100 tons though. It was {{also pointed out that}} 120 mm armour might not be enough in view of the powerful German 88 mm gun. The commission rejected the char minimum proposal of 56 tons as it had insufficient trench-crossing capacity. It also discarded a proposal by the engineer Boirault to build a futuristic 120 ton articulated tank. It retained two options: the char maximum of 89 tons, demountable in two sections, and the char squelette of 110 tons and with a trench-crossing ability of eight metres; this latter design was along the general lines of the World War I American Skeleton Tank, but with the added feature that the main body could move in relation to the skeleton <b>track</b> <b>frame</b> in order to shift its point of gravity.|$|E
50|$|On 11 August actual {{construction}} began; on 16 August Tritton {{decided to}} fit a wheeled tail to assist in steering. On 9 September the Number 1 Lincoln Machine, as the prototype was then known, made its first test run in the yard of the Wellington Foundry. It {{soon became clear that}} the track profiles were so flat that ground resistance during a turn was excessive. To solve this, the suspension was changed so that the bottom profile was more curved. Then the next problem showed up: when crossing a trench the track sagged and then would not fit the wheels again and jammed. The tracks were also not up to carrying the weight of the vehicle (about 16 tons). Tritton and Lieutenant Walter Gordon Wilson tried several types of alternative track design, including balatá belting and flat wire ropes. Tritton, on 22 September, devised a robust but outwardly crude system using pressed steel plates riveted to cast links and incorporated guides to engage {{on the inside of the}} <b>track</b> <b>frame.</b> The track frames as a whole were connected to the main body by large spindles. This system was unsprung, as the tracks were held firmly in place, able to move in only one plane. This was a successful design and was used on all First World War British tanks up to the Mark VIII, although it limited speed.|$|E
5000|$|The Vickers design {{still was}} {{reminiscent}} of the Great War types. It had a high, lozenge-shaped, <b>track</b> <b>frame</b> with side doors but it also showed some improvements. There was a fully revolving turret and the suspension was provided by vertical helical springs, while the Medium Mark C still had a fixed turret and was unsprung. The Vickers was {{much smaller than the}} Medium C at just seven feet high and weighing only 8.5 short tons. It was driven by a separately compartmented 86 hp engine through an advanced hydraulic Williams-Jenney transmission, allowing infinitely variable turn cycles. The first prototype was a [...] "Female" [...] version with three Hotchkiss machine guns; the second prototype was a [...] "Male" [...] which had a 3-pounder gun in place of one of the machine guns and also a machine gun for anti-aircraft use. It looked far closer to a modern tank than its predecessors with the turret, the front of the fighting compartment and the hull front plate all strongly rounded. The advanced transmission proved to be utterly unreliable however and the project was abandoned in 1922 in favour of a generally more conventional design, the Vickers Light Tank Mark I. This would be renamed the Vickers Medium Tank Mark I in 1924 [...] The first prototypes were sent to Bovington for trial in 1923. The Vickers designation was A2E1.|$|E
50|$|Nichols {{moved to}} a former shop at 48 Durban Road in nearby Smethwick. His last frame was built in 1995. He was a {{vice-president}} of the Hill Top Cycling Club and at its 21st anniversary dinner in 1956 he presented one of his early <b>track</b> <b>frames</b> to the first Briton to finish the Tour de France, Brian Robinson.|$|R

50|$|The machine {{concept was}} a {{standard}} base to each model on which optional front-end equipment could be mounted with appropriate counterbalances, crawler <b>track</b> <b>frames</b> and minimal additional machinery. The most common variants included face shovel, dragline, lifting crane and grabbing crane. Less common variants included drag shovel, skimmer and pile driver. Some cranes were also lorry-mounted. All machines had 360 degree rotation on a conical section roller path.|$|R
5000|$|Fosters of Lincoln {{built the}} 14 ton [...] "Little Willie", which first ran on 8 September. Powered by a 105 hp (78 kW) Daimler engine, the 10 ft {{armoured}} box was initially {{fitted with a}} low Bullock caterpillar. A rotating top turret was planned with a 40 mm gun but abandoned due to weight problems, leaving the final vehicle unarmed and {{little more than a}} test-bed for the difficult track system. Difficulties with the commercial tracks supplied led to Tritton designing a completely new track system different from, and vastly more robust than, any other system then in use. The next design by Lieutenant Walter Gordon Wilson RNAS, a pre-war motor engineer, added a larger <b>track</b> <b>frame</b> to the hull of [...] "Little Willie". In order to achieve the demanded gap clearance a rhomboidal shape was chosen - stretching the form to improve the track footprint and climbing capacity. To keep a low centre of gravity the rotating turret design was dropped in favour of sponsons {{on the sides of the}} hull fitted with naval 6-pounder (57 mm) guns. A final specification was agreed on in late September for trials in early 1916, and the resulting 30 ton [...] "Big Willie" [...] (later called [...] "Mother") together with [...] "Little Willie" [...] underwent trials at Hatfield Park on 29 January and 2 February. Attendees at the second trial included Lord Kitchener, Lloyd George, Reginald McKenna and other political luminaries. On 12 February an initial order for 100 [...] "Mother" [...] type vehicles was made, later expanded to 150.|$|E

50|$|The {{tank was}} based on a {{lengthened}} and modified version of the suspension of the Holt Model 75, with pivoting <b>track</b> <b>frames.</b> There were ten road wheels at each side. The tank was 7 ft tall, 16 ft long, and 9 ft wide. The vehicle had a Holt , 4-cylinder engine fitted with a General Electric generator driving an electric motor for each track; a comparable petro-electric system had earlier been used for the French Saint-Chamond that also was fitted with a lengthened Holt suspension. To prevent overheating the transmission—a constant problem with electrical types—a complicated water cooling system had been installed.|$|R
50|$|Over {{the years}} the OC-9 was in production, there were only slight {{modifications}} and improvements made to the design. The most notable was the blade push trunnions and hydraulic ram mounting positions. The only real variant of the OC-9 was a track loader designated the OC-96, built on the same design as the OC-9. The OC-96 was modified slightly {{to allow for the}} loader configuration: the final drives were rotated slightly to allow the position of the tracks to be farther in front of the machine.
