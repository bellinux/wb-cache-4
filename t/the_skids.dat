40|$|Abstract. An {{expert system}} has been {{proposed}} to estimate {{the relationship between the}} vehicle pre-braking speed and the length of <b>the</b> <b>skid</b> mark. Since <b>the</b> length of <b>the</b> <b>skid</b> mark varies with many factors, there is no a single formula or equation which can represent the relationship between the vehicle pre-braking speed and the length of <b>the</b> <b>skid</b> mark. Therefore in this paper an expert system is built to estimate the relationship between the vehicle pre-braking speed and the length of <b>the</b> <b>skid</b> mark. <b>The</b> radial basis function (RBF) neural network is used for the expert system due to its shorter training time and higher accuracy. There are many factors affecting <b>the</b> <b>skid</b> mark. In this paper we choose 7 factors, i. e. brand of vehicle, vehicle displacement, year of manufacture, vehicle weight, vehicles with and without ABS, roadway surface, and vehicle speed for the training in the RBF neural network. The total number of the training data for the RBF neural network is 2619. The results showed that high accuracy is obtained for estimating the relationship between the vehicle pre-braking speed and the length of <b>the</b> <b>skid</b> mark. Thus <b>the</b> expert system proposed in this paper is demonstrated to be a suitable system for estimating the relationship between the vehicle pre-braking speed and the length of <b>the</b> <b>skid</b> mark...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSES: This study {{aimed to}} measure <b>the</b> <b>skid</b> {{resistance}} of <b>the</b> sidewalk {{in order to}} find out the relationship between different surface types and skid resistance. By using British Pendulum Tester, skid resistance of sidewalk was measured in a wet after snow-melt, sludgy, and snowy conditions. METHODS: <b>The</b> <b>skid</b> resistance was measured on surfaces including Concrete Interlocking Block Paving, Colour Asphalt Pavement, Granite Block Paving, Manhole, and Tactile Paving for Visually Impaired. Five trials at each measurement were made, and the average and standard deviation were derived. RESULTS: <b>The</b> <b>skid</b> resistance measured in wet after snow-melt, sludgy, and snowy conditions for the various surface types are summarized and compared. Reduction rates of skid resistance of sludgy and snowy against wet after snow-melt are also analysed. <b>The</b> <b>skid</b> resistance variation between measurement points which mimic pedestrian route in study site are analysed to check out the consistency of <b>the</b> <b>skid</b> resistance along <b>the</b> sidewalk. CONCLUSIONS: The study concluded that <b>the</b> <b>skid</b> resistance of sidewalk surfaces varied depending on the surface types and weather conditions. Secondly, reduction rates of skid resistance according to weather changes are varied depending on the surface types, Thirdly, consistency of <b>skid</b> resistance along <b>the</b> pedestrian route is hardly acquired in the study site at least.

In this research plant species recovery rate and natural tree regeneration on <b>the</b> <b>skid</b> trails with different time of construction (1980, 1990, 2000 and 2010) were investigated in the Hyrcanian forests of Iran.

40|$|Abstract—Effect of {{aeolian sand}} on <b>the</b> <b>skid</b> {{resistance}} of AC- 13 and SMA- 13 asphalt pavements was investigated by characterization of skid resistance value and structural {{depth of the}} asphalt mixture before and after accelerated wearing. The results indicate that when the aeolian sand cover is less than 1. 0 kg/m 2, the aeolian sand affects <b>the</b> <b>skid</b> resistance of AC- 13 and SMA- 13 asphalt pavements similarly. However, when the aeolian sand cover exceeds 1. 0 kg/m 2, the aeolian sand affects <b>the</b> <b>skid</b> resistance of AC- 13 asphalt pavement more significantly than that of SMA- 13 asphalt pavement. With the aeolian sand cover increasing from 1. 0 kg/m 2 to 1. 5 kg/m 2, <b>the</b> <b>skid</b> resistance value declines from 53 to 40 and the declining rate is up to 30 %. The polished stone value testing of coarse aggregate before and after accelerated wearing shows that the asphalt mixture with the gradation of AC- 13 exhibits a bigger polished stone value changing of coarse aggregate, which confirms that the aeolian sand affects <b>the</b> <b>skid</b> resistance of AC- 13 asphalt mixture more significantly.

25|$|The actual salvage {{started in}} February 1902. The forty workers used heavy timber to {{construct}} skids {{to direct the}} schooner {{into the water and}} used hydraulic jackscrews to dislodge her from the sand onto <b>the</b> <b>skids,</b> while the Wallowas engines were used to pull the Minnie A. Caine towards the water. The schooner was moved 45 feet, but procedure had to be restarted in April, as a March storm destroyed weeks of work, pushing the schooner where it originally was. Finally, the vessel was dragged 85 feet towards the water, and the Wallowa was making the final pull, but her power was insufficient to drag the schooner into the water. On May 4, a more powerful tug Tyee from Puget Sound Tug Boat Co. was chartered, but only after simultaneous application of two tugs — the Tyee and the Tacoma on May 9, 1902, the Minnie A. Caine was finally afloat.|$|E

25|$|The {{aircraft}} was a three-bay biplane with a biplane elevator and central fin mounted on {{two pairs of}} converging booms in front. The chord of the outer bay of each wing was extended aft to form flexible extensions to effect lateral control: between the tips of these extensions, four balanced rudders were pivoted. The undercarriage consisted {{of a pair of}} ash skids extending forward, almost as far as the elevators. No wheels were fitted, as it was intended to use a launching rail for takeoff. Apart from <b>the</b> <b>skids,</b> the entire airframe was built of spruce, and was covered with Continental brand rubberised fabric. The engine, originally intended to be a version of the Wright's engine made by Bariquand et Marre, drove a pair of pusher propellers, mounted slightly above mid-gap using a chain drive. This was arranged so that both propellers revolved in the same direction, since crossing them to make them revolve in opposite directions might have infringed patents held by the Wright brothers.|$|E
