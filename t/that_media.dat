5|$|According to Perry Link, {{pressure}} on Western institutions also takes more subtle forms, including academic self-censorship, whereby research on Falun Gong is avoided {{because it could}} result in a denial of visas for fieldwork in China. Ethan Gutmann also noted <b>that</b> <b>media</b> organizations and human rights groups also self-censor on the topic, given the PRC government's attitude toward the practice, and the potential repercussions that may follow for making overt representations on Falun Gong's behalf.|$|E
5|$|Innis {{examined}} {{the rise and}} fall of ancient empires as a way of tracing the effects of communications media. He looked at media that led to the growth of an empire; those that sustained it during its periods of success, and then, the communications changes that hastened an empire's collapse. He tried to show <b>that</b> <b>media</b> 'biases' toward time or space affected the complex interrelationships needed to sustain an empire. These interrelationships included the partnership between the knowledge (and ideas) necessary to create and maintain an empire, and the power (or force) required to expand and defend it. For Innis, the interplay between knowledge and power was always a crucial factor in understanding empire.|$|E

5|$|Many {{writers have}} {{attempted}} to designate one person, often Hensley, as the progenitor of Appalachian religious snake handling. Although these writers have emphasized Hensley's role in propagating the practice, Kimbrough notes that claims that he originated it are usually unsubstantiated by research, and {{the origins of the}} observance are unclear. Hood and Williamson argue that the beginnings of Pentecostal snake handling rites cannot be ascribed to a single person, and that the observance arose independently on multiple occasions. There is no doubt among historians, however, that Hensley helped spread Pentecostal snake handling throughout the Southeast, and <b>that</b> <b>media</b> coverage of Hensley's ministry was influential in prompting various churches to include the practice in their services.|$|E

I have, based on the purpose of this study issued following questions: What is social media, according to the teachers?, How do the teachers think about their students' use of social media?, How do the teachers think <b>that</b> social <b>media</b> has influenced their teaching? And how do the teachers describe / experiencing the impact <b>that</b> social <b>media</b> has contributed to in the students' identity work? This study is made through a qualitative method based on interviews with five teachers. The results show that all of the teachers agree <b>that</b> social <b>media</b> is a part of our present. The teachers’ talk about various ways social media has affected their teaching, but most often the discussion has been about values, laws and regulations, concerning the etiquette on social media. The teachers’ believe <b>that</b> social <b>media</b> has had an effect on the children's identity. They believe that children today, focus on appearance, perfection, performance and material objects, which automatically will affect children’s self-image. According to the teachers, social media has created a new way to show appreciation between individuals, where they are appreciated by comments and likes. But let’s all agree <b>that</b> social <b>media</b> is a social place, where children can feel part of their social togetherness and culture...|$|R
