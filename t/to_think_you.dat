[...] However, he commented {{that it was not}} for him to say if the Internal Security Act should be scrapped. [...] "As a lawyer, I'm all for its review but on whether it should be scrapped, I don't know. You've got a multi-racial society [...] in which emotions can run high very quickly." [...] Interviewed on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's radio programme PM in April 2001, Hickling agreed with the interviewer, Geoff Thompson, that he supported the law's continued existence and said he was [...] "sorry to say that, in the light of my own experience, I'm inclined <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> couldn't really safely get rid of it at the moment". Worldwide terrorist attacks such as 9/11 confirmed his views on the matter.|$|E
500|$|From {{the very}} {{beginning}} of the series, fans had expressed dislike towards the character of Duncan. However, he decided to keep playing the character. In a later interview, he said, [...] "Obviously, I acted because I wanted the fans to like the experience. You want your performance to be liked. You don't want to suck. You don't want people <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> suck. That wasn't the goal." [...] Towards the end of the airing of the first season, he stated, [...] "I'm going to be there in every episode next season if we get a second season. So people will either continue to hate me or things will change. Things are going to change for Duncan anyway, as the season resolves. There are going to be different sides of him that you're going to get to see." [...] Before going into the filming of season two, Thomas had told Dunn that he was being written off the show, and Dunn did not react badly to the news, as by that point, it [...] "was actually a decision" [...] for him to return for the second season at all.|$|E
500|$|Eccleston {{stated in}} April 2004 {{that he did}} not believe his Doctor would be [...] "as {{eccentric}} and as foppish as he was in some of his incarnations". Russell T Davies characterised the character as a [...] "stripped down" [...] version of previous Doctors. Regarding the Ninth Doctor's less eccentric character, Davies stated: [...] "He travels in time and space, he's got two hearts, he's a Time Lord— that's eccentric enough to be getting on with". In contrast with previous Doctors, the Ninth Doctor speaks with a distinct Northern accent. Remarking on this aspect of his characterisation Eccleston states that the character [...] "is a scientist and an intellectual, {{and a lot of people}} seem <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> can only be those things if you speak with received pronunciation which, of course, is rubbish." [...] In regards to the Doctor's costume, consisting of simply a black leather coat and dark trousers, Eccleston stated, [...] "I didn't want the costume to be my performance" [...] and that [...] "I wanted any flamboyance and colour to come out of my acting." [...] Eccleston thought that as the Doctor he should show a [...] "slight dark side" [...] but also bring out a lighter side. Executive producer Julie Gardner observed that the Ninth Doctor gave Eccleston the chance to be [...] "very intense but also frivolous as well." ...|$|E

500|$|On 15 March 1899 Bruce {{wrote to}} Sir Clements Markham at the RGS, {{offering}} {{himself for the}} scientific staff of the National Antarctic Expedition, then in its early planning stages. Markham's reply was a non-committal one-line acknowledgement, after which Bruce heard nothing for a year. He was then told, indirectly, {{to apply for a}} scientific assistant's post. On 21 March 1900 Bruce reminded Markham that he had applied a year earlier, and went on to reveal that he [...] "was not without hopes of being able to raise sufficient capital whereby I could take out a second British ship". He followed this up a few days later, and reported that the funding for a second ship was now assured, making his first explicit references to a [...] "Scottish Expedition". This alarmed Markham, who replied with some anger: [...] "Such a course will be most prejudicial to the Expedition A second ship is not in the least required I do not know why this mischievous rivalry should have been started". Bruce replied by return, denying rivalry, and asserting: [...] "If my friends are prepared to give me money to carry out my plans I do not see why I should not accept it [...] there are several who maintain that a second ship is highly desirable". Unappeased, Markham wrote back: [...] "As I was doing my best to get you appointed (to the National Antarctic Expedition) I had a right <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> would not take such a step without at least consulting me". He continued: [...] "You will cripple the National Expedition [...] in order to get up a scheme for yourself".|$|E

People gravitate to the best singer...We have people today who go just the other way, and I don't agree with them. Some of our folksong exponents seem <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> have to go way back in the hills and drag out the worst singer in the world before it's authentic. Now, this is nonsense...Just because he's old and got three arthritic fingers and two strings left on the banjo doesn't prove anything." ...|$|E

2500|$|Because of the 1968 National Democratic Convention and the {{possibility}} of the song inciting further violence, Chicago radio stations refused to play the song. [...] This was much to the delight of Mick, who stated: [...] "I'm rather pleased to hear they have banned (the song). [...] The last time they banned one of our records in America, it sold a million." [...] Mick said he was told they thought the record was subversive, to which he snapped: [...] "Of course it's subversive! [...] It's stupid <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> can start a revolution with a record. [...] I wish you could." ...|$|E
2500|$|Throughout the competition, Allen {{received}} many compliments for his folk-inspired interpretations of modern pop songs. He played several instruments during his performances, including the acoustic guitar, the electric guitar, the keyboard, and the piano. His performance of [...] "To Make You Feel My Love" [...] {{as part of}} the Top 11 earned praise from the judges, with Simon Cowell commenting, [...] "I am genuinely beginning <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> have a shot of doing well in this competition." [...] In the finals, he performed his own arrangement of [...] "Ain't No Sunshine" [...] on a keyboard, with a few musicians on stage, which earned praise from the judges. Cowell lauded it as Allen's [...] "best performance so far." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I wrote a quick script which I was not {{particularly}} enamored with myself," [...] Hill said. However it attracted the interest of Paul Newman and John Huston. [...] "One would like <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> are mistaken about the wonders of your work, but I didn't believe it," [...] he said. [...] "That part {{turned out to be}} true. I went over to work on the script with Huston. He wasn't very well, I ended up with sole screen credit, but {{one of the problems is}} the screen credit is misleading very often. I wrote 90% of the first half, various people wrote the rest. I didn't think it was a very good film. Hill says he never saw the final product, but was told it was [...] "a real bomb".|$|E

2500|$|The {{proposed}} book outraged the Goldman family, who {{criticized the}} publisher for [...] "helping a murderer get his voice out there." [...] According to lawyers for Ron Goldman's family, the Goldmans planned {{to attempt to}} garnish any earnings Simpson might get from the book. Fred Goldman, Ron's father, was awarded $33.5 million by a jury in 1997 for the wrongful death of his son. However, Simpson never paid this judgment due to a California law that prevents pensions from being used to satisfy judgments, {{and the fact that}} the bulk of his income comes from his NFL pension. Goldman described the book and television interview as [...] "an all-time low" [...] and [...] "morally reprehensible to me... <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> are willing to give somebody airtime about how they would murder two people." [...] Patricia Schroeder, president and chief executive of the Association of American Publishers, felt that the book would [...] "stir an awful lot of debate and make the culture take a real look at itself, and that may not be unhealthy".|$|E
