5|$|Additionally, {{there can}} be {{confusion}} between the various water hemlock species and poison hemlock (Conium maculatum) as the common name hemlock is applied to both Cicuta and Conium maculatum. Both are poisonous and can be differentiated by differences in their root structure. Water hemlock has a branched root systems with tubules, while poison hemlock has a single <b>tap</b> <b>root.</b> Another reliable method to identify water hemlock {{is to examine the}} leaf veins. Water Hemlock is unique in the Apiaceae family in that it has leaf veins which terminate in the notches between the leaf tips, rather than extend to the tip of the leaf, as is found in the leaf structure of other members of this family.|$|E
5|$|Yosemite National Park has {{documented}} more than 130 non-native plant species within park boundaries. These non-native plants were introduced into Yosemite following {{the migration of}} early Euro-American settlers in the late 1850s. Natural and human-caused disturbances, such as wildland fires and construction activities, have contributed to a rapid increase in the spread of non-native plants. A number of these species aggressively invade and displace the native plant communities, resulting in impacts on the park's resources. Non-native plants can bring about significant changes in park ecosystems by altering the native plant communities and the processes that support them. Some non-native species may cause {{an increase in the}} fire frequency of an area or increase the available nitrogen in the soil that may allow more non-native plants to become established. Many non-native species, such as yellow star thistle (Centaurea solstitialis), are able to produce a long <b>tap</b> <b>root</b> that allows them to out-compete the native plants for available water.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} of the root system, comprising a vertical <b>tap</b> <b>root</b> and multiple horizontal laterals, develops in the seedling's first year. Thereafter, the sinker and laterals continue to lengthen, and new laterals appear. There are only three to five laterals at first, but this number typically increases to eight to ten within ten years. During the first winter, {{there is a great}} deal of root system development, especially elongation of the sinker root, but almost no shoot growth. By summer, the sinker root has generally almost reached the water table, and shoot growth increases substantially. Around February, the shoot forms a resting bud, and growth then ceases until October. On resumption of shoot growth, the shoots grow rapidly for a short time, while the plant is under little water stress; then, with the onset of water stress, the plants settles into a long period of slower shoot growth. This pattern of summer-only shoot growth is maintained throughout the life of the plant, except that in mature plants, seasonal shoot growth may cease with the formation of a terminal inflorescence rather than a resting bud. Inflorescence development continues after shoot growth ceases, and flowering commences in February or March. March and April are the peak months for flowering, which ends in July or August.|$|E

2500|$|While {{the term}} [...] "weed" [...] {{generally}} {{has a negative}} connotation, many plants known as weeds can have beneficial properties. A number of weeds, such as the dandelion (Taraxacum) and lamb's quarter, are edible, and their leaves or roots {{may be used for}} food or herbal medicine. Burdock is common over much of the world, and is sometimes used to make soup and medicine in East Asia. Some weeds attract beneficial insects, which in turn can protect crops from harmful pests. Weeds can also prevent pest insects from finding a crop, because their presence disrupts the incidence of positive cues which pests use to locate their food. Weeds may also act as a [...] "living mulch", providing ground cover that reduces moisture loss and prevents erosion. Weeds may also improve soil fertility; dandelions, for example, bring up nutrients like calcium and nitrogen from deep in the soil with their <b>tap</b> <b>root,</b> and clover hosts nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its roots, fertilizing the soil directly. The dandelion is also one of several species which break up hardpan in overly cultivated fields, helping crops grow deeper root systems. Some garden flowers originated as weeds in cultivated fields and have been selectively bred for their garden-worthy flowers or foliage. An example of a crop weed that is grown in gardens is the corncockle, (Agrostemma githago), which was a common weed in European wheat fields, but is now sometimes grown as a garden plant.|$|E

40|$|Plant {{roots are}} very {{effective}} in controlling concentrated flow erosion. Several studies quantified the erosion-reducing effects of plants with different root traits. This is useful for practitioners who want to evaluate suitable plant species to improve slope stability. So far, most research on the erosion-reducing potential of plant roots focused on silt loam soils whereas no or little research exists for sand soils. These soils are common and are also very prone to incisive erosion processes resulting {{in the formation of}} e. g. large gullies. At present, no specific relationship between root variables and their erosion-reducing potential exists to reliably assess the erosion-reducing potential of plant roots in sand soils. Therefore the first objective {{of this study was to}} assess the erosion-reducing potential of grass and carrot roots in soils with a sand content of 94 % through concentrated flow experiments. Our second objective was to compare the erosion-reducing potential of plant roots in sand and silt loam soils. For sand soils, the results show a strong erosion-reducing effect for fibrous roots while this effect was less pronounced for <b>tap</b> <b>roots.</b> This results in a negative root diameter effect showing that thicker <b>tap</b> <b>roots</b> are less effective in reducing concentrated flow erosion rates compared to thin <b>tap</b> <b>roots</b> and fibrous roots. New relationships were established between the root variables root density (RD) and root length density (RLD) and the erosion-reducing potential expressed as a soil detachment ratio of the root-permeated soil sample compared to a bare reference sample (SDR). Soil texture plays a significant role in this relationship as revealed by comparing results for sand and silt loam soils. The nature of this soil texture effect is root-architecture dependent. Fibrous roots are much more effective in sand soils compared to silt loam soils while this effect is opposite for <b>tap</b> <b>roots</b> which are less effective in sand soils. The latter can be attributed to more pronounced vortex erosion around the thicker <b>tap</b> <b>roots</b> in sand soils. These results can be used by practitioners to assess the likely erosion-reducing effect of plant species based on root characteristics (i. e. root (length) density and diameter) and soil texture. status: publishe...|$|R

The aqueous fraction also showed marked improvement in OGTT and serum insulin level in neonatal STZ-induced diabetic rats for 30 consecutive days.
