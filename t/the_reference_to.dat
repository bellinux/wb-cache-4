5|$|I {{think you}} will {{recognise}} {{that it was necessary}} to get rid of Brunetto for two reasons. The first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with Yeats though I do not mean anything so precise as that. However, I do not wish to take the responsibility of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell and I do not want to impute to him the particular vice which took Brunetto there. Secondly, although <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> that Canto is intended to be explicit, I wish the effect of the whole to be Purgatorial which is more appropriate. That brings us to <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of Purgatorio 26 where the poets are found.|$|E
5|$|In his (1991) novel Roman Blood, Steven Saylor renders a fictionalized, yet informed, {{rendition}} {{of how the}} Roman punishment poena cullei might occur. <b>The</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> the punishment is in connection with Cicero's (historically correct, and successful) endeavours to acquit Sextus Roscius of the charge of having murdered his own father.|$|E
5|$|In his 1995 revision, Nelson {{refers to}} {{putative}} hybrids with A.dobsonii and A.apiculatus, citing the 1978 paper {{in which he}} published putative hybrids with A.dobsonii and A.forrestii. It is unclear whether <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> A.apiculatus is an error or a fourth putative hybrid.|$|E
50|$|Critics also praised <b>the</b> <b>references</b> <b>to</b> past episodes {{such as the}} Ice Truck Killer. Katie Waldman of Slate thought <b>the</b> <b>references</b> <b>to</b> past seasons, {{including}} the Ice Truck Killer, Rita, the Trinity Killer and Doakes, made the world of Dexter more layered and complete.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> St. Peter's sister {{may be a}} {{substitution}} for St. Peter's daughter, St. Petronilla, {{known in}} England as St. Parnell.

5|$|Apart {{from the}} finds in the Taynton Limestone Formation, in 1939 Sidney Hugh Reynolds {{referred}} remains to Megalosaurus {{that had been}} found in the older Chipping Norton Limestone Formation dating from the early Bathonian, about thirty single teeth and bones. Though the age disparity makes it problematic to assume an identity with Megalosaurus bucklandii, in 2009 Benson could not establish any relevant anatomical differences with M. bucklandii among the remains found at one site, the New Park Quarry, and therefore affirmed <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> that species. However, in another site, the Oakham Quarry, the material contained one bone, an ilium, that was clearly dissimilar.|$|E
5|$|Article 149(1) immunizes the Internal Security Act from {{invalidity}} due to inconsistency {{with five}} of the fundamental liberty provisions in the Constitution, including Article 12. <b>The</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> Article 12 in Article 149(1) was enacted by Parliament in 1989 to reverse the effect of Chng Suan Tze v.

5|$|Giraldus Cambrensis wrote a Life of St Æthelberht, {{probably}} at Hereford during the 1190s. He quotes an incident from Asser {{that occurred during}} the reign of Offa of Mercia, who died in 796. This incident is not in the surviving copies of the manuscript. It is possible that Giraldus had access to a different copy of Asser's work. It is also possible that he is quoting a different work by Asser, which is otherwise unknown, or even that Giraldus is making up <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> Asser to support his story. The latter is at least plausible, since Giraldus is not always regarded as a trustworthy writer.|$|E
5|$|In January 2007, Casino Royale {{became the}} first Bond film ever to be shown in {{mainland}} Chinese cinemas. The Chinese version was edited before release, with <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> the Cold War re-dubbed and new dialogue added during the poker scene explaining the process of Texas hold 'em, as the game is less familiar in China (this addition is reminiscent of dialogue that {{was added to the}} 1954 American TV adaptation to explain the rules of baccarat, the game featured in the original book). Casino Royale has earned approximately $11.7million in China since its opening on 30 January on 468 screens, including a record opening weekend collection for a non-Chinese film, with $1.5million.|$|E
5|$|In a later {{edition of}} his memoirs, Vrba responded that he is certain <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> the {{imminent}} Hungarian deportations was in the original Slovak version of the Vrba–Wetzler report, some of which he wrote by hand, but which did not survive. He wrote that he recalled Oscar Krasniansky of the Slovak Jewish Council, who translated the report into German, arguing that only actual deaths should be recorded, and not speculation, to lend the report maximum credibility. Vrba speculated {{that this was the}} reason Krasniansky omitted the references to Hungary from the German translation, which was the version that was copied around the world.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. {{portion of}} the {{operation}} was to bear the title Dewey Canyon II, named for Operation Dewey Canyon conducted by U.S. Marines in the northwestern South Vietnam in 1969. It was hoped that <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> the previous operation would confuse Hanoi as to the actual target of the proposed incursion. The ARVN's portion was given the title Lam Son 719, after the village of Lam Son, birthplace of the legendary Vietnamese patriot Lê Lợi, who had defeated an invading Chinese army in 1427. The numerical designation came from the year, 1971, and the main axis of the attack, Route 9.|$|E
5|$|Various {{changes were}} made in the second edition. Some of the social {{commentary}} regarding the poor treatment of Native Americans by the government was toned down. The name of the Native tribe was changed from the Orteils Ficelés ("Tied Toes") to the Pieds Noirs ("Black Feet"). Perhaps because Al Capone's power had diminished in the intervening years, Hergé depicted Capone's scarred face in the 1945 version. He removed <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> Mary Pikeford from the ceremonial dinner scene and deleted two Chinese hoodlums who tried to eat Snowy. References to Belgium were also removed, allowing the story to have a greater international appeal.|$|E
5|$|Blökumen are {{mentioned}} in the Flateyjarbók, an Icelandic manuscript from the late 14th century, which preserved a 13th-century biography of King Olaf of Norway. This work contains a separate chapter on the adventures of a Norwegian prince, Eymund, at the court of Prince Jarizleifr in Novgorod. The chapter narrates that Eymund informed Jarizleifr of the departure of Jarizleifr's brother, Burizlaf, to Tyrkland, and added that Burizlaf was preparing to attack Jarizleifr with a huge army formed by Tyrkir, Blökumen and other peoples. Curta, Spinei and other scholars identify Jarizleifr with Yaroslav the Wise, and Burizlaf with Sviatopolk I of Kiev. They argue that <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> the Tyrkir and Blökumen proves that Sviatopolk I hired Pechenegs and Vlachs {{when he decided to}} go to war with Yaroslav. Furthermore, they propose that the Blökumenn of the Flatey Book, like the Blakumen of the runic inscription from Gottland, were Vlachs from Moldavia or Wallachia.|$|E

5|$|During the happenings of the episode, a man playing Santa at a Christmas-themed ranch {{is shown}} videotaping the {{children}} at his ranch. Billie later tells Mulder that she saw a vision of her daughter in her room and that she said the number 74. Mulder decides he cannot finish the case and wants {{to take time off}} because he's too close to make any sound judgment. On their way to the airport, Scully comes across the Santa park (situated off of California State Route 74) and decides to stop because of <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> Santa Claus in the notes. Here they find the videotape setup and tapes dating {{all the way back to}} the '60s, including one of Amber Lynn LaPierre. The man who runs the park is promptly arrested, and Mulder finds graves of children all over his ranch.|$|E
5|$|Eidos hired several {{models to}} portray Lara Croft at {{publicity}} events, promotions, trade shows, and photo shoots. Nathalie Cook {{was the first}} model, portraying the character from 1996 to 1997. Cook was followed by British actress Rhona Mitra from 1997 to 1998. Eidos then updated the Croft costume to match its video game depiction. Core Design reportedly restricted Mitra's dialogue as the character at trade shows and out of costume. French model Vanessa Demouy succeeded Mitra {{for a brief time}} until fashion model Nell McAndrew took over the role at the 1998 Electronic Entertainment Expo. McAndrew portrayed Croft from 1998 until 1999, when Eidos fired her for posing in Playboy, which used the character and Tomb Raider franchise to promote the McAndrew's issue without Eidos's approval. Core Design was granted an injunction against the magazine to protect the character's image; Playboy was ordered to place stickers {{on the cover of the}} issue to conceal <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> Tomb Raider. Eidos later donated McAndrew's Tomb Raider costume to a UNICEF charity auction.|$|E
5|$|Nine quarterings on {{a shield}} was {{considered}} too complex {{for a national}} symbol and by 1915 a push had begun to design a new coat of arms for Canada. A committee was formed in 1919 to pursue the issue, eventually agreeing that {{the elements of the}} new arms would reference the Royal Arms of England, Ireland, Scotland, and France, with maple leaves representing Canada, though there was at the time no consensus on how the leaves were to be used. The decision was settled by 1920, and the committee conferred with the College of Arms in London, only to face resistance {{to the use of the}} Royal Arms from the Garter King of Arms. After some manoeuvring, including the personal intervention of Winston Churchill, the new arms of Canada were eventually formally requested by an Order in Council on 30 April 1921 and adopted on 21 November of the same year by proclamation of King George V as the Arms or Ensigns Armorial of the Dominion of Canada. The new layout closely reflected the arms of the United Kingdom with the addition of maple leaves in the base and <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> the French royal arms in the fourth quarter. The proclamation also established white and red as the national colours of Canada.|$|E

5|$|The {{etymology}} of Mirza puzzled researchers {{for many}} years. Gray often created mysterious and unexplained taxonomic names—a trend not only continued with {{his description of}} Mirza in 1870, {{but also with the}} genera Phaner (fork-marked lemurs) and Azema (for M.rufus, now a synonym for Microcebus), both of which were described in the same publication. In 1904, American zoologist Theodore Sherman Palmer attempted to document the etymologies of all mammalian taxa, but could not definitively explain these three genera. For Mirza, Palmer only noted that it derived from the Persian title mîrzâ ("prince"), a view tentatively supported by Alex Dunkel, Jelle Zijlstra, and Groves in 2012. However, because <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> Persian princes might have come from Arabian Nights, a popular piece of literature at the time, Dunkel et al. also searched the general literature published around 1870. The origin of all three names was found in a British comedy The Palace of Truth by W. S. Gilbert, which premiered in London on 19November1870, nearly one and a half weeks prior to the date written on the preface of Gray's manuscript (also published in London). The comedy featured characters bearing all three names: King Phanor (sic), Mirza, and Azema. The authors concluded that Gray had seen the comedy and then based the names of three lemur genera on its characters.|$|E
