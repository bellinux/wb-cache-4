5|$|Many of the cottages {{were now}} burning, {{obscuring}} {{the field of}} fire and driving the defenders out of their positions. Hearing <b>the</b> <b>din</b> of battle in Blenheim, Tallard {{sent a message to}} Marlborough offering to order the garrison to withdraw from the field.|$|E
5|$|Around 1 p.m., from 150 to 170 Confederate guns {{began an}} {{artillery}} bombardment {{that was probably}} the largest of the war. In order to save valuable ammunition for the infantry attack that they knew would follow, the Army of the Potomac's artillery, under the command of Brig. Gen. Henry Jackson Hunt, at first did not return the enemy's fire. After waiting about 15 minutes, about 80 U.S. cannons added to <b>the</b> <b>din.</b> The Army of Northern Virginia was critically low on artillery ammunition, and the cannonade did not significantly affect the Union position.|$|E
5|$|DIN {{screw thread}} {{connectors}} - the regulator screws into the cylinder valve trapping the O-ring securely between the sealing {{face of the}} valve and the O-ring groove in the regulator. These are more reliable than A-clamps because the O-ring is well protected, but many countries do not use DIN fittings widely on compressors, or cylinders which have DIN fittings, so a diver traveling abroad with a DIN system may need to take an adaptor, either for connecting <b>the</b> <b>DIN</b> regulator to a rented cylinder, or for connecting an A-clamp filler hose to a DIN cylinder valve.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} incarceration of the Thapas, a new {{government}} with joint mukhtiyars was formed with Rangnath Paudel {{as the head of}} civil administration, and Dalbarjan Pande and Ranjang Pande as joint heads of military administration. This appointment established the Pandes as the dominant faction in the court, and they started to make preparations for war with the British in order to win back the lost territories of Kumaon and Garhwal. While such war posturing was nothing new, <b>the</b> <b>din</b> the Pandes created alarmed not just the Resident Hodgson but the opposing court factions as well, who saw their aggressive policy as detrimental to the survival of the country. After about three months in power, under pressure from the opposing factions, the King removed Ranjang as mukhtiyar and Ranganath Paudel, who was favorably inclined towards the Thapas, was chosen as the sole mukhtiyar.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>DIN</b> fitting {{is a type}} {{of direct}} {{screw-in}} connection to the cylinder. <b>The</b> <b>DIN</b> system is less common worldwide, but has the advantage of withstanding greater pressure, up to 300 bar, allowing use of high-pressure steel cylinders. They are less susceptible to blowing the O-ring seal if banged against something while in use. DIN fittings are the standard in much of Europe and are available in most countries. <b>The</b> <b>DIN</b> fitting is considered more secure and therefore safer by many technical divers.|$|E

25|$|J. S. White of Cowes built a {{prototype}} to the Fleming design. Eight weeks later the craft was doing trials on the Clyde.

The metal hull served as an amplifier for the two 120hpChrysler engines. Also, there remained the difficulty of applying armour plate to the hull. The sides were not flat, but rounded – a complicated shape for which to roll an armoured skin.

25|$|The {{legions of}} the late Republic and early Empire are often called Marian legions. Following the Battle of Vercellae in 101 BC, Marius granted all Italian {{soldiers}} Roman citizenship. He justified this action to the Senate by saying that in <b>the</b> <b>din</b> of battle he could not distinguish Roman from ally. This effectively eliminated the notion of allied legions; henceforth all Italian legions would be regarded as Roman legions, and full Roman citizenship was open to all the regions of Italy. At the same time, the three different types of heavy infantry were replaced by a single, standard type based on the Principes: armed with two heavy javelins called pila (singular pilum), the short sword called gladius, chain mail (lorica hamata), helmet and rectangular shield (scutum).|$|E

25|$|On 2 July, {{the four}} foreign {{observers}} {{returned to the}} battlefield at 5am, in time to witness a meeting between Generals Lee, Longstreet, Hill, John Bell Hood and Henry Heth. Once more, Fremantle climbed his tree {{to see what was}} happening, this time in the company of Captain Scheibert. After touring the Confederate lines, Fremantle returned to that position at about 2pm on the advice of General Longstreet, but was frustrated that the attack did not take place until well after 4pm. For the first time, the Englishman heard the 'Rebel Yell', as well as a Confederate band playing polkas and waltzes above <b>the</b> <b>din</b> of battle. That evening, news reached the observers of the wounding of General Hood, as well as the death of General William Barksdale.|$|E
25|$|While Khan {{was away}} from Mangalgarh, Mohammad Farooq Hakim, the Governor of Bhilsa, imprisoned his men and confiscated his {{personal}} property. When Khan returned and confronted him, {{he said that he}} believed that Khan had died in the battle with the Mughals. He released the imprisoned men, but returned only half of the Khan's belongings. The resulting hostility eventually led to a battle near Bhilsa. Farooq's army included 40,000 Maratha and Rajput soldiers, while Khan commanded just 5000 Afghans, supported by some Rajput soldiers. In a one-sided battle, Khan lost his brother Sher Mohammed Khan, and his men fled from the battlefield. Dost Mohammad Khan, with some of his most loyal men, had to hide in a thicket near the battlefield. As he lay hidden, he saw Farooq riding an elephant in the victory procession. He dressed himself in the uniform of one of Farooq's slain soldiers, hiding his face with a scarf and a helmet. Amid <b>the</b> <b>din</b> of the victory drums, he mounted the howdah (seat) on the elephant, killed Farooq and his guard, and claimed victory.|$|E
25|$|With the {{darkness}} of night, now rapidly deepening, <b>the</b> <b>din</b> of battle, which had been terrific and incessant until the last faint glimmering of twilight, became gradually hushed: its expiring sounds still issuing from the heights in front of Brye, whence the flashes from the fire of artillery, and from that of skirmishers along the outskirts of this village (held by General Jagow with the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 9th Regiment, and the 2nd Battalion of the 1st Westphalian Landwehr), indicated to the French army the extreme verge of its advance; while the still more vivid flashes emitted from the rattling musketry fire of the two Battalions of the 30th Regiment, which had so gallantly sallied forth out of Mont-Potriaux, under Major Dittfurth were still engaged, as also from the Prussian guns which defended the approach to Sombreffe, and frustrated the renewed attack along the high road towards that point, plainly intimated that the Prussian left wing (Thielemann's Corps) still firmly maintained itself in a position whence it might seriously endanger the flank of any further movement in advance against the centre.|$|E

25|$|The Battalion Forming up Place(FUP) {{was secured}} and marked by C Company, under Major HC Singh. Just before the H Hour it was {{realized}} by Lieutenant Ashok Nagpaul, the battalion intelligence officer, that the FUP was misaligned. Sathe, the commanding officer, who had located {{himself in the}} centre of the two assaulting Rifle Companies, on learning that there was mistake in the marking of the FUP, coolly and without causing a flap had the FUP marking corrected. The assault was conducted by A and D Rifle companies under the command of Captain Subash C Jolly and Maj Hem Chander Tiwari respectively. Before the assault Sathe shook hands with the two company commanders and wished them victory. The Battalion advancing through sugar cane fields secured Anula by first light 8 September against 'comparatively light' opposition, according to the Ministry of Defense, History of the war, published 27 years later. The defenders, consisting mainly of Pakistan para-military troops, prompted by <b>the</b> <b>din</b> of war and the impending assault, abandoned their position before the assault reached their position. Anula and Bajragarhi were captured by 0539 hours 8 September 65. Soon after Anula was captured Sathe reached the objective. He first visited A Company, and then D Company, where he was wounded by own artillery fire.|$|E
500|$|Two guardsmen, Miomandre and Tardivet, each {{separately}} {{attempted to}} face down {{the crowd and}} were overpowered. [...] The violence boiled over into savagery as Tardivet's head was shorn off and raised aloft on a pike.

[...] They continued to experiment with string arrangements to various effect; Sgt. Peppers [...] "She's Leaving Home", for instance, is [...] "cast in the [...] of a sentimental Victorian ballad", Gould writes, [...] "its words and music filled with the clichés of musical melodrama".|$|E

500|$|The assault troops rose {{early on}} 3 January 1941, ate a meal and drank a tot of rum. The leading {{companies}} began {{moving to the}} start line at 0416. The artillery opened fire at 0530.
