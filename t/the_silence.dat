40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} {{the experience of}} applying of <b>The</b> <b>Silences</b> Framework to underpin health research investigating Tuberculosis/HIV/AIDS coinfection. Method: <b>The</b> <b>Silences</b> Framework originally developed following a study exploring <b>the</b> decisions and <b>silences</b> surrounding black Caribbean men living in England, discussing the themes 'sexual health' and 'ethnicity'. Following this study a conceptual a theory for research on sensitive issues and health care of marginalized populations was developed called 'Screaming Silences' which forms the foundation of <b>The</b> <b>Silences</b> Framework. Screaming Silences define research areas and experiences that are poorly studied, little understood or <b>silenced.</b> Results: <b>The</b> <b>Silences</b> Framework supports researchers in revealing "silences" in the subjects they study - as such results may reflect how beliefs, values, and experiences of some groups influence their health. This framework provides the application of four complementary stages: working <b>the</b> <b>silences,</b> hearing silences, voicing silences and working with <b>the</b> <b>silences.</b> <b>The</b> analysis occurs cyclically and can be repeated as long as <b>the</b> <b>silences</b> inherent in a study are not revealed. Conclusion: this article presents <b>The</b> <b>Silences</b> Framework and <b>the</b> application {{of the notion of}} "sounds of silence", mapping an antiessentialist theoretical framework for its use in sensitive research in health and nursing areas, being a reference for other researchers in studies involving marginalized populations.

5|$|The Doctor uses Amy's {{communication}} chip {{to track}} her location, and lands the TARDIS in the Silence's control room five days later. As River and Rory hold <b>the</b> <b>Silence</b> at bay, the Doctor shows them the live {{broadcast of the}} moon landing. As they watch, the Doctor uses his modification of the Apollo command module to insert Canton's recording of the wounded Silent into the footage of the landing. Because of this message, humans will now turn upon <b>the</b> <b>Silence</b> whenever they see them. The group frees Amy and departs in the TARDIS, while River kills all <b>the</b> <b>Silence</b> in the control room. Amy reassures Rory that the man he overheard her speaking of loving through the communication chip was him, not the Doctor.|$|E

However, none of the cast of Manhunter reprise their roles in the later film, although actors Frankie Faison and Dan Butler appear in both films as different and unrelated characters. <b>The</b> <b>Silence</b> of the Lambs earned several awards and accolades, including the Academy Award for Best Picture. It {{is one of only}} three films to have won the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Actress, and Best Screenplay. <b>The</b> <b>Silence</b> of the Lambs was followed in turn by a sequel and two prequels: Hannibal, Red Dragon and Hannibal Rising, plus an NBC television series, Hannibal.|$|E

40|$|AbstractCosuppression {{refers to}} the {{phenomenon}} in which silencing among dispersed homologous genes occurs. Here we demonstrate that two nonhomologous reciprocal fusion genes, white-Alcohol dehydrogenase (w-Adh) and Adh-w, exhibit cosuppression using the endogenous Adh sequence as an intermediary. Deletion of the endogenous Adh gene eliminates the interaction, while reintroduction of an 8. 6 kb Adh fragment restores <b>the</b> <b>silencing.</b> Using truncated Adh constructs, a nontranscribed segment in the Adh regulatory region {{was found to be}} one of the sequences required for homology recognition. <b>The</b> <b>silencing</b> interaction is initiated during early development. <b>The</b> <b>silenced</b> transgenes are associated with the Polycomb group complex of chromatin proteins...|$|R

5|$|Almost {{nothing is}} {{recorded}} {{of the first}} twenty years of Egbert's reign, apart from campaigns against the Cornish in the 810s. The historian Richard Abels argues that <b>the</b> <b>silence</b> of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle was probably intentional, concealing Egbert's purge of Beorhtric's magnates and suppression of rival royal lines. Relations between Mercian kings and their Kentish subjects were distant. Kentish ealdormen {{did not attend the}} court of King Coenwulf, who quarrelled with Archbishop Wulfred of Canterbury (805–832) over the control of Kentish monasteries; Coenwulf's primary concern seems to have been {{to gain access to the}} wealth of Kent. His successors Ceolwulf I (821–23) and Beornwulf (823–26) restored relations with Archbishop Wulfred, and Beornwulf appointed a sub-king of Kent, Baldred.|$|E

5|$|During a {{visit to}} Pompeii, he lost his passport, {{and went back to}} the amphitheatre he had visited earlier in the day in order to find it.

5|$|In the sonnet, {{the poet}} writes {{of why he}} has stopped {{showering}} his muse with flowery praise and adoration.

He writes of how immediately following the Rival Poet sonnets, the Poet begins to speak of his lover being false and having forsaken him. West claims that this ultimately culminates in sonnets 100-103, where the Poet expresses his regret over what has transpired.|$|E
