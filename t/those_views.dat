5|$|Over time, Dmowski {{became more}} {{receptive}} to Russian overtures, particularly neoslavism, warming up {{to the idea that}} Poland and Russia may have a common future, particularly due to Germany being their common enemy. In light of what he regarded as Russian cultural inferiority, Dmowski felt that a strong Russia was more acceptable than a strong Germany. In Dmowski's view, the Russian policy of Russification would not succeed in subjugating the Poles, while the Germans would be far more successful with their Germanisation policies. He explained <b>those</b> <b>views</b> in his book Niemcy, Rosja i kwestia Polska (Germany, Russia and the Polish Cause), published in 1908.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} few decades of the 20th century, most field naturalists {{continued}} to believe that alternative mechanisms of evolution such as Lamarckism and orthogenesis provided the best explanation for the complexity they observed in the living world. But as the field of genetics continued to develop, <b>those</b> <b>views</b> became less tenable. Theodosius Dobzhansky, a postdoctoral worker in Thomas Hunt Morgan's lab, had {{been influenced by the}} work on genetic diversity by Russian geneticists such as Sergei Chetverikov. He helped to bridge the divide between the foundations of microevolution developed by the population geneticists and the patterns of macroevolution observed by field biologists, with his 1937 book Genetics and the Origin of Species. Dobzhansky examined the genetic diversity of wild populations and showed that, contrary to the assumptions of the population geneticists, these populations had large amounts of genetic diversity, with marked differences between sub-populations. The book also took the highly mathematical work of the population geneticists and put it into a more accessible form. In Britain, E. B. Ford, the pioneer of ecological genetics, continued throughout the 1930s and 1940s to demonstrate the power of selection due to ecological factors including the ability to maintain genetic diversity through genetic polymorphisms such as human blood types. Ford's work would contribute to a shift in emphasis {{during the course of the}} modern synthesis towards natural selection over genetic drift.|$|E

40|$|Part 2 : GamesInternational audienceEliciting {{accurate}} and complete knowledge from individuals is a non-trivial challenge. In this paper, we present {{the evaluation of}} a virtual-world based approach, informed by situated cognition theory, which aims to assist with knowledge elicitation. In this approach, we place users into 3 D virtual worlds which represent real-world locations and ask users to describe information related to tasks completed in those locations. Through an empirical A/B evaluation of 62 users, we explore the differences in recall ability and behaviour of <b>those</b> <b>viewing</b> the virtual world via a virtual reality headset and <b>those</b> <b>viewing</b> the virtual world on a monitor. Previous {{results suggest that the}} use of a virtual reality headset was able to meaningfully improve memory recall ability within the given scenario. In this study, we adjust experiment protocol to explore the potential confounds of time taken and tool usability. After controlling for these possible confounds, we once again found that those given a virtual reality headset were able to recall more information about the given task than <b>those</b> <b>viewing</b> the virtual world on a monitor...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 63 - 66) This {{study investigated}} the relationships between depression, the characteristics of internal and external locus of control, and the expression of aggression, testing the psychoanalytic theory that depression is aggression turned inwards. The 247 subjects who voluntarily {{participated in the study}} were {{randomly assigned to one of}} three groups. All subjects were given the Rotter Internal-External Locus of Control Scale and saw one of three 10 -minute films judged to be depressing, neutral or humorous. Then the subjects were given the Beck Depression Inventory and finally the Iowa Picture Interpretation Test (a multiple choice version of the TAT) to measure the subjects' expression of hostility. It was hypothesized that Externals would be more depressed than Internals, that subjects viewing the depressing film would be more depressed than <b>those</b> <b>viewing</b> the neutral and humorous films, and that Internals would report more hostility than Externals. It was found that a Externals were significantly more depressed than Internals, that b) Externals exhibited more hostility than Internals, contrary to what was predicted, and that c) <b>those</b> <b>viewing</b> the depressing film were not more depressed than <b>those</b> <b>viewing</b> the neutral and humorous films...|$|R
25|$|Later {{investigations}} {{showed that}} the FBI misled Congress about investigating Casolaro's death.

25|$|The {{scientific}} community has overwhelmingly rejected the ideas put forth in creation science as lying outside {{the boundaries of}} a legitimate science. The foundational premises underlying scientific creationism disqualify it as a science because the answers to all inquiry therein are preordained to conform to Bible doctrine, and because that inquiry is constructed upon theories which are not empirically testable in nature. Scientists also deem creation science's attacks against biological evolution to be without scientific merit. <b>Those</b> <b>views</b> of the {{scientific community}} were accepted in two significant court decisions in the 1980s which found the field of creation science to be a religious mode of inquiry, not a scientific one.|$|E

500|$|Luther's theses were {{intended}} to begin a debate among academics, not a popular revolution, but {{there are indications that}} he saw his action as prophetic and significant. Around this time, he began using the name [...] "Luther" [...] and sometimes [...] "Eleutherius", Greek for [...] "free", rather than [...] "Luder". This seems to refer to his being free from the scholastic theology which he had argued against earlier that year. Luther later claimed not to have desired the Theses to be widely distributed. Elizabeth Eisenstein has argued that his claimed surprise at their success may have involved self-deception and Hans Hillerbrand has claimed that Luther was certainly intending to instigate a large controversy. At times, Luther seems to use the academic nature of the Theses as a cover to allow him to attack established beliefs while being able to deny that he intended to attack church teaching. Since writing a set of theses for a disputation does not necessarily commit the author to <b>those</b> <b>views,</b> Luther could deny that he held the most incendiary ideas in the Theses.|$|E
500|$|Highlighting Ion Creangă's {{recourse}} to the particularities of Moldavian regionalisms and archaisms, their accumulation making Creangă's work {{very difficult to}} translate, George Călinescu reacted against claims that the narratives reflected antiquating patterns. He concluded that, in effect, Creangă's written language {{was the equivalent of}} a [...] "glossological museum", and even contrasted by the writer's more modern everyday parlance. Also discussing the impression that Creangă's work should be read with a Moldavian accent, noted for its [...] "softness of sound" [...] in relation to standard Romanian phonology, Călinescu cautioned against interpretative exaggerations, maintaining that the actual texts only offer faint suggestions of regional pronunciation. Contrasting Creangă with the traditions of literature produced by Wallachians in what became the standard literary language, Călinescu also argued in favor of a difference in mentality: the [...] "balance" [...] evidenced by Moldavian speech and illustrated in Ion Creangă's writings is contrasted by the [...] "discoloration and roughness" [...] of [...] "Wallachianism". He also criticized <b>those</b> <b>views</b> according to which Creangă's variant of the literary language was [...] "beautiful", since it failed to [...] "please everyone on account of some acoustical beauty", and since readers from outside the writer's native area could confront it [...] "with some irritation." [...] For Călinescu, the result nevertheless displays [...] "an enormous capacity of authentic speech", also found in the works of Caragiale and, in the 20th century, Mihail Sadoveanu. According to the same commentator, the dialectical interventions formed a background to a lively vocabulary, a [...] "hermetic" [...] type of [...] "argot", which contained [...] "hilarious double entendres and indecent onomatopoeia", passing from [...] "erudite beauty" [...] to [...] "obscene laughter". Some of the expressions characteristic of Creangă's style are obscure in meaning, and some other, such as [...] "drought made the snake scream inside the frog's mouth", appear to be spontaneous and nonsensical. Another specific trait of this language, commented upon by Vianu's and compared by him to the aesthetics of Classicism, sees much of Creangă's prose being set to a discreet poetic meter.|$|E
