5|$|A similar {{play in the}} game's {{second half}} scored another {{touchdown}}. Quarterback Doc Kuhn dropped back for a more than 40-yard touchdown pass to Bomar. The pass went 28 yards in <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> <b>with</b> Bomar running {{the rest of the}} way. Georgia running back Dave Collings tackled him as he crossed the goal line (injuring himself), and Bomar also made an interception in the 12–0 Vanderbilt victory. The season's final game, against Vanderbilt's oldest rival Sewanee, had a trick play by the Commodores. A fake run ended with Kuhn tossing the ball to Bomar, who was left open behind the defense and easily ran it in; Vanderbilt won, 26–0.|$|E
40|$|The {{processes}} of structurization of dust precipitations in granulated filtering mediums, {{formed by the}} monolithic glass spherical granules with the diameters of 2 mm and 3 mm, are re-searched. The distinctions between the distributions of filtered coal dust masses in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> filters <b>with</b> cylindrical granules and <b>the</b> <b>air</b> filters <b>with</b> spherical granules, are found. The influences by the filtered dust masses on <b>the</b> <b>air</b> resistance of both <b>the</b> <b>air</b> filters <b>with</b> <b>the</b> cylindrical granules and <b>the</b> <b>air</b> filters <b>with</b> <b>the</b> spherical granules are described. The conclusions on a possibility {{of the use of}} various chemical adsorbents with different geometric forms and volumetric dimensions to improve the filtering properties of granulated filtering mediums in air filters at nuclear power plants are formulated.

40|$|Difussion of {{moisture}} through <b>air</b> layers <b>with</b> opened edges in buiding walls {{has been studied}} using two kinds of test methods. Diffussion rate {{of moisture}} through <b>air</b> layers <b>with</b> opened edges is represented by equivalent vapor transmission coefficient. Consideration {{have been given to}} moisture distribution in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> layers <b>with</b> opened edges. The results are shown that these test methods and the diffussion rate of moisture through <b>air</b> layers <b>with</b> opened edges are satisfactory. The experimental results indicate that <b>the</b> <b>air</b> layers <b>with</b> opened edges of thickness not less than 2 cm have enough the effect of removal moisture when the height of <b>the</b> <b>air</b> layers <b>with</b> opened edges is 1. 8 m. These test methods {{can be applied to the}} methods for water vapor permeance of the actual size walls. The agreement between the measured and calculated value is good when diffusion of moisture in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> layers <b>with</b> opened edges is calculated using MAC method...|$|R

5|$|At the lek, {{males have}} been {{observed}} to break up into pairs, performing “confrontation displays”. This consists of facing each other while bowing, jumping, and flapping their wings, sometimes even snapping their bills, {{and at the same}} time giving off various squawking and grunting calls. When the female approaches, it becomes even more intense. The display turns into a cacophony of bright color and a frenzied activity filling <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>with</b> very strange sounds.|$|E
5|$|Brolgas {{are well}} known for their ritualised, {{intricate}} mating dances. The performance begins with a bird picking up some grass and tossing it into the air before catching it in its bill. The bird then jumps a metre (yard) into <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>with</b> outstretched wings and continues by stretching its neck, bowing, strutting around, calling and bobbing its head up and down. Sometimes just one brolga dances for its mate; often they dance in pairs; and sometimes {{a whole group of}} about a dozen dance together, lining up roughly opposite each other before they start.|$|E
5|$|DEA agents collect MI6 agent James Bond and {{his friend}} (and CIA agent) Felix Leiter, {{on their way to}} Leiter's wedding in Key West, to have them assist in {{capturing}} drugs lord Franz Sanchez.

5|$|In Washington, D.C., {{sustained}} winds remained below {{tropical storm}} force, though gusts reached 71mph (114km/h) as {{recorded by the}} National Academy of Science. Hurricane-force winds existed several hundred feet in <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> <b>with</b> wind sensors {{on the top of}} tall buildings recording winds of 70 to 85mph (115 to 135km/h). Rainfall was minimal, amounting to around two inches across the district. A gauge on Wisconsin Avenue recorded a storm surge of 11.3feet (3.4m), and a gauge on a pier in the southwest portion of the district recorded a storm surge of 10.25feet (3.1m). Both observations were records, surpassing the previous observation set by the 1933 Chesapeake Potomac Hurricane.|$|E

5|$|Television {{broadcasting}} in Winnipeg {{started in}} 1954. The federal government refused to license any private broadcaster until the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation {{had created a}} national network. In May 1954, CBWT went on <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>with</b> four hours of broadcasting per day. There are now five English-language stations and one French-language station based in Winnipeg. Additionally, some American network affiliates are available over-the-air. Winnipeg is home to 33 AM and FM radio stations, {{two of which are}} French-language stations. CBC Radio One and CBC Radio 2 broadcast local and national programming in the city. NCI is devoted to Aboriginal programming.|$|E
5|$|To counter this threat, the Admiralty {{developed}} the fighter catapult ship a converted freighter, manned by a naval crew, carrying a single Hawker Hurricane fighter. When an enemy bomber was sighted, the fighter would be launched into <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>with</b> rockets, and fly up to destroy or drive away the bomber. Being large and slow, the Fw 200 became a rather vulnerable target. After the combat, the fighter pilot would bail out or ditch {{in the ocean}} near the convoy, and be picked up if all went well.|$|E

5|$|Although not gifted with pace, stamina, physicality or notable {{defensive}} skills, work-rate, or tackling abilities, Pirlo {{was known}} for his composure in possession, and drew praise for his touch, technique, balance, close control, and dribbling ability, as well as his flair and creativity in beating players with feints during one-on-one situations, in order to retain the ball and create space. As a playmaker, he is highly regarded by pundits for his outstanding vision, awareness, and football intelligence, as well as his movement, inventive play, anticipation, ability to read the game, and his wide range of distribution, which enabled him to play the ball first time and rarely relinquish possession, even when put under pressure; in addition to being capable of playing precise, short exchanges to teammates, he was also known for frequently attempting riskier and more difficult passes and is renowned in particular for his extremely accurate long-range passing, both on the ground or in <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> <b>with</b> either foot, despite being naturally right footed. He is considered {{to be one of the}} best passers in the history of the sport, and is also known for his accurate striking ability from distance. These characteristics allowed him to contribute to his team's offensive play with goals and assists.|$|E
5|$|Ambrose's height, and the {{accuracy}} {{with which he}} bowled, {{made it difficult for}} batsmen to play forward to the ball; instead they were forced to play with their weight going back. His accuracy meant that he was effective if the pitch favoured batsmen. He bowled an effective yorker, and unlike other fast bowlers, used short-pitched deliveries sparingly, although he could bowl a hostile bouncer, and concentrated on bowling a full length aimed at the wickets. Ambrose rarely engaged in verbal sparring with batsmen, although in later years he occasionally inspected the pitch in an area close to the batsman before an innings began and rubbed his hands to suggest that he would enjoy bowling there. He always aimed to concede as few runs as possible when bowling, and frequently berated himself when he offered an easy delivery from which to score. Following his dismissal of a batsman, Ambrose often celebrated by pumping <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>with</b> his fists. With Courtney Walsh, Ambrose developed a reputation for performing at his best when his team seemed likely to lose, and he often took wickets in clusters which devastated the opposition. In addition, he was often most effective against the leading batsmen on a team; he was also capable of exploiting vulnerabilities in the techniques of other batsmen.|$|E
5|$|American kestrels feed {{largely on}} small {{animals such as}} grasshoppers, dragonflies, lizards, mice, voles, and small birds. The kestrel has also been {{reported}} to have killed snakes, bats, and squirrels. The kestrel is able to maintain high population densities, {{at least in part}} because of the broad scope of its diet. The American kestrel's primary mode of hunting is by perching and waiting for prey to come near. The bird is characteristically seen along roadsides or fields perched on objects such as trees, overhead power lines, or fence posts. It also hunts by kiting, hovering in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>with</b> rapid wing beats and scanning the ground for prey. Other hunting techniques include low flight over fields, or chasing insects and birds in the air.|$|E

5|$|Combat {{comes in}} the form of both avoidable random {{encounters}} and scripted fights where the camera is fixed within the fighting area: enemies and bosses are primarily drawn from Japanese folklore and mythology. Battles are triggered only when enemies are near, with the player character otherwise keeping their weapons sheathed. In combat, characters attack and guard using a single-button prompt, while another button accesses items such as healing potions. Continuously attacking triggers combos. Different moves include sword slashes combined with directional buttons, which have different effects such as throwing an enemy into <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>with</b> an upward slash. Additional offensive items such as smoke bombs are acquired during the course of the game. At the end of each battle, experience points are awarded to the player character depending on how fast the battle was finished: leveling up increases a character's health, stats, and the amount of damage inflicted upon enemies.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} career, after scoring a goal, Del Piero often celebrated by {{running to the}} touchline {{in front of the}} fans with his arms out-stretched, and {{sticking}} out his tongue, in a similar manner to Michael Jordan, also frequently leaping into <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>with</b> a raised fist towards the sky, or sliding onto his knees whilst passionately chanting to the crowd. Del Piero also performed a back-flip goal celebration in a 2008 UEFA Champions League match against Zenit, and he also pointed up at the sky after scoring on certain occasions, to dedicate a goal to his late father, such as when he scored against Bari during the 2000–01 season, and Mexico at the 2002 World Cup.|$|E
5|$|On November 14, 2009, Paramount flew 50 {{members of}} the press to New York with Anna Kendrick, Sad Brad Smith and representatives of American Airlines to promote Up in the Air.
