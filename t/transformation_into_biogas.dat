Organic waste is the most part of the solid waste generated. This waste need to be treated adequately to avoid environmental problems and health problems in people. The objective was to treat urban residential organic waste and to verify the efficiency of the <b>transformation</b> <b>into</b> <b>biogas</b> and bio fertilizers. A digester of the Indian type was used in Nova Palma, Rio Grande do Sul. The research was developed in the period of three years with a daily monitoring. The average biogas production was higher in the summer for three years and it was more stable in the third year in different seasons. There were no reagents to coliforms. The study found that anaerobic digestion has potential in treating organic waste...|$|E

30|$|Many biotechnological {{processes}} rely on {{the combined}} action of complex microbial consortia (Kleerebezem and van Loosdrecht [2007]). An important example is the anaerobic digestion process which converts organic residues <b>into</b> <b>biogas,</b> a renewable form of energy containing methane as the primary energy carrier (Chen et al.

50|$|Biogas is {{produced}} as landfill gas (LFG), which {{is produced}} by the breakdown of Biodegradable waste inside a landfill due to chemical reactions and microbes, or as digested gas, produced inside an anaerobic digester. A biogas plant is the name often given to an anaerobic digester that treats farm wastes or energy crops. It can be produced using anaerobic digesters (air-tight tanks with different configurations). These plants can be fed with energy crops such as maize silage or biodegradable wastes including sewage sludge and food waste. During the process, the microorganisms transform biomass waste <b>into</b> <b>biogas</b> (mainly methane and carbon dioxide) and digestate. The biogas is a renewable energy {{that can be used}} for heating, electricity, and many other operations that use a reciprocating internal combustion engine, such as GE Jenbacher or Caterpillar gas engines. Other internal combustion engines such as gas turbines are suitable for the conversion of <b>biogas</b> <b>into</b> both electricity and heat. The digestate is the remaining inorganic matter that was not transformed <b>into</b> <b>biogas.</b> It can be used as an agricultural fertiliser.|$|R
40|$|Material flow {{analysis}} (MFA) {{was applied to}} study the process of biogas production from switchgrass using a mid-temperature (35 +/- 1 degrees C) batch anaerobic digestion process. The flow distributions of energy and material, including carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), were analyzed, as were the material and energy conversion efficiencies. The results showed that biogas and CH 4 production were 268. 80 and 135. 31 NmL. gVS(- 1) added, respectively, and the average CH 4 content in biogas was 50. 34 %. Based on the MFA of the anaerobic digestion process, 30. 6 %, 3. 6 %, and 65. 8 % of C was converted <b>into</b> <b>biogas,</b> biogas slurry, and biogas residue, respectively; and 11. 7 % and 88. 3 % of N was converted <b>into</b> <b>biogas</b> slurry and biogas residue, respectively. The conversion efficiencies of the material and energy from switchgrass to biogas were 36. 1 % and 30. 1 %.

The biogas process was initiated after closing the bottles, and the biogas was collected during the process until the biogas production ended. During the 33 days of experiment the batch bottles were held at constant temperature (370 C) in a water bath. The biomass used in the experiment was wheat straw and corn stalks. Before being used in the experiment the biomass was milled using a kitchen mixer. After that the biomass was subjected to a combination of thermal and chemical pretreatments. The volume of biogas produces was measured every seven days during the experiment period. The biogas production measurements were done by using a BlueSens measuring equipment...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents three novel optimization {{models for}} sustainable wastewater management. The Blue Plains Advance Wastewater treatment plant (AWTP) {{operated by the}} District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority (DC Water) {{is used as a}} case study. The application to the Blue Plains AWTP is presented to illustrate the usefulness of the model and how wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), solid waste disposal plants, community management groups can actively and positively participate in energy and agricultural markets. Besides the conversion of the solid end products <b>into</b> <b>biogas</b> and electricity via digesters, WWTP can also produce Class B biosolids for land application or Class A biosolids for use as fertilizer. Chapter 1 introduces the Blue Plains case study and other important aspects of wastewater management. The first problem, discussed in Chapter 2, is a multi-objective, mixed-integer optimization model with an application to wastewater-derived energy. The decisions involve converting the amount of solid end products <b>into</b> <b>biogas,</b> and/or electricity for internal or external purposes. Three objectives; maximizing total value, minimizing energy purchased from external sources and minimizing carbon dioxide equivalen...|$|R
