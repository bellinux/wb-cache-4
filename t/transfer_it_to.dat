5|$|This fern was {{at first}} {{identified}} by André Michaux, in 1803, as black spleenwort (Asplenium adiantum-nigrum). Carl Ludwig Willdenow recognized and {{described it as a}} separate species, which he named Asplenium montanum, in 1810. In 1901, John A. Shafer attempted to <b>transfer</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the genus Athyrium as Athyrium montanum, but this name is illegitimate as a later homonym of Athyrium montanum (Lam.) Röhl. ex Spreng. The species was segregated from Asplenium as Chamaefilix montana by Oliver Atkins Farwell in 1931. The change was not widely accepted and current authorities do not recognize this segregate genus. In 1974, Timothy Reeves described an unusual population of A.montanum from the Shawangunk Mountains. Having used chromatography to show {{that it was not a}} hybrid, he interpreted it as a new form, Asplenium montanum forma shawangunkense. In this form, as contrasted with the usual forma montanum, the leaf blade is yellow-green, the fronds continue highly dissected to the apex and do not come to a pointed tip, the fronds are shorter and more highly dissected than usual, and all fronds are sterile.|$|E
5|$|With Alden on {{a murderous}} rampage towards the Historic District, Cole defeats him {{once and for}} all in a bridge battle. Before jumping in the water, Alden reveals that Kessler exiled him from the First Sons. White, who turns out to be an NSA agent with no {{connection}} to Moya, reaches out to Cole and explains that the Ray Sphere is designed to consume bio-energy from thousands of lives and <b>transfer</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> a single user, making them a Conduit. During their search for the Sphere, Kessler publicly challenges Cole to stop a series of bombings across the district, ending with him being forced to choose between saving Trish or her colleagues. Regardless of which choice he makes, Cole fails to keep Trish from dying. Determined to punish Kessler, Cole tracks the Sphere to a remote pier, where he must decide whether to destroy it or use it to become even more powerful. Regardless, the Sphere releases the last of its energy, killing John before disappearing into a vortex.|$|E

50|$|The fungus was {{originally}} described in 1903 by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck as Cortinarius punctifolius. Alexander H.

50|$|After being {{released}} from PSII, PQH2 travels to the cytochrome b6f complex which then transfers two electrons from PQH2 to plastocyanin in two separate reactions. The process that occurs {{is similar to the}} Q-cycle in Complex III of the electron transport chain. In the first reaction, PQH2 binds to the complex on the lumen side and one electron is transferred to the iron-sulfur center which then <b>transfers</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> cytochrome f which then <b>transfers</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> plastocyanin. The second electron is transferred to heme bL which then <b>transfers</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> heme bH which then <b>transfers</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> PQ. In the second reaction, a second PQH2 gets oxidized, adding an electron to another plastocyanin and PQ.Both reactions together transfer four protons into the lumen.|$|R

25|$|Heat gain is {{the heat}} {{accumulated}} {{from the sun}} in the system. Solar thermal heat is trapped using the greenhouse effect; the greenhouse effect {{in this case is}} the ability of a reflective surface to transmit short wave radiation and reflect long wave radiation. Heat and infrared radiation (IR) are produced when short wave radiation light hits the absorber plate, which is then trapped inside the collector. Fluid, usually water, in the absorber tubes collect the trapped heat and <b>transfer</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> a heat storage vault.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Coppelius {{returns home}} to find the girls. He becomes angry with them, not only for {{trespassing}} but for also disturbing his workroom. He kicks them out and begins cleaning up the mess. However, upon noticing Franz at the window, Coppélius invites him in. The inventor wants to bring Coppélia to life but, to do that, he needs a human sacrifice. With a magic spell, he will take Franz's spirit and <b>transfer</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Coppélia. After Dr. Coppelius proffers him some wine laced with sleeping powder, Franz begins to fall asleep. The inventor then readies his magic spell.|$|E
25|$|The Bolshevik {{forces were}} the first to enter Vilnius on July 14, 1920, and despite the treaty did not intend to <b>transfer</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the Lithuanians. The Soviets {{installed}} a puppet government, the former Litbel, with the intent of fomenting a socialist revolution. Leon Trotsky and Mikhail Tukhachevsky were making preparations to overthrow the Lithuanian government. The plans never came to pass as Poland defeated Soviet forces in the Battle of Warsaw between August 13 and August 25. On August 26, as the Polish Army was approaching the southern borders of Lithuania, the Soviets finally transferred Vilnius to Lithuanian control and the Red Army retreated.|$|E

25|$|The Buenos Aires Underground, {{initially}} {{maintained by}} the national government, {{was the subject of}} a year-long dispute between Macri and Kirchner. The national government sought to <b>transfer</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the city (which Macri supported), but the budget and length of the transition period were contested. Macri announced that the city would take over the underground on 13November 2012. Line A, still using wooden cars almost a century old, received a fleet of modern cars from the national government; Line H also received new cars. Madrid Metro rolling-stock purchases for Line B were criticised, despite their technical superiority, for being incompatible with the line and costing more than new trains for the city's commuter-rail network.|$|E
25|$|March 19 was {{dedicated}} to Saint Joseph in several Western calendars by the 10th century, and this custom was established in Rome by 1479. Pope Pius V extended its use to the entire Roman Rite by his Apostolic Constitution Quo primum (July 14, 1570). Originally a double of the second class and a feast of precept, it was re-raised to be of precept in 1917 after having this status intermittently lost, and consequently also raised to its current rank of double of the first class (now called a solemnity), having become in the meantime the rank common to all remaining general feasts of precept. Since 1969, Episcopal Conferences may, if they wish, <b>transfer</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> a date outside Lent.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the council}} was delayed until 1545 and, as it happened, convened right before Luther's death. Unable, however, {{to resist the}} urging of Charles V, the pope, after proposing Mantua as the place of meeting, convened the council at Trento (at that time a free city of the Holy Roman Empire under a prince-bishop), on 13 December 1545; the Pope's {{decision}} to <b>transfer</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Bologna in March 1547 on the pretext of avoiding a plague failed to take effect and the Council was indefinitely prorogued on 17 September 1549. None of the three popes reigning over {{the duration of the}} council ever attended, which had been a condition of Charles V. Papal legates were appointed to represent the Papacy.|$|E

25|$|The {{agricultural}} {{reforms of}} the early 1980s led to a confusingly large number of new production arrangements and contracts. Underlying the variability of administrative and contractual forms were several basic principles and trends. In the first place, land, the fundamental means of production, remained collective property. It was leased, allocated, or contracted to individual households, but the households did not own the land and could not <b>transfer</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> other households. The household became, in most cases, the basic economic unit and was responsible for its own production and losses. Most economic activity was arranged through contracts, which typically secured promises to provide {{a certain amount of}} a commodity or sum of money to the township government in return for the use of land, or workshops, or tractors.|$|E
25|$|In 1075 {{a council}} {{was held in}} London, under the {{presidency}} of Archbishop Lanfranc, which, reciting the decrees {{of the council of}} Sardica held in 347 and that of Laodicea held in 360 on this matter, ordered the bishop of the south Saxons to remove his see from Selsey to Chichester; the Wiltshire and Dorset bishop to remove his cathedra from Sherborne to Old Sarum, and the Mercian bishop, whose cathedral was then at Lichfield, to <b>transfer</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Chester. Traces of the tribal and migratory system may still be noted in the designations of the Irish see of Meath (where the result has been that there is now no cathedral church) and Ossory, the cathedral church of which is at Kilkenny. Some of the Scottish sees were also migratory.|$|E
25|$|Almost all spiders {{reproduce}} sexually. They are {{unusual in}} {{that they do not}} transfer sperm directly, for example via a penis. Instead the males <b>transfer</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> specialized structures (palpal bulbs) on the pedipalps and then meander about to search for a mate. These palps are then introduced into the female's epigyne. This was first described in 1678 by Martin Lister. In 1843 it was revealed that males build a nuptial web into which they deposit a drop of semen, which is then taken up by the copulatory apparatus (the palpal bulb) in the pedipalp. The structure of the copulatory apparatus varies significantly between males of different species. While the widened palpal tarsus of the southern house spider, Kukulcania hibernalis (Filistatidae), only forms a simple bulb containing the coiled blind duct, members of the genus Argiope have a highly complex structure.|$|E
