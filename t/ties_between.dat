5|$|After Cecilia's {{death in}} 1644, the <b>ties</b> <b>between</b> Władysław and the Habsburgs were {{somewhat}} loosened. In turn, the relations with France improved, and eventually Władysław married the French princess Ludwika Maria Gonzaga de Nevers, daughter of Karol I Gonzaga, prince de Nevers, in 1646.|$|E
5|$|During the war the Polish 1st Armoured Division {{had been}} based in Scotland, {{establishing}} <b>ties</b> <b>between</b> {{the community and}} Poland.

Later she established the Lady Curran Endowment fund for overseas, particularly Polish, students.|$|E

5|$|In March 2006, a {{visit to}} India led to renewed <b>ties</b> <b>between</b> the two countries, {{reversing}} decades of U.S. policy. The visit focused particularly on areas of nuclear energy and counter-terrorism cooperation, discussions that would lead eventually to the India–United States Civil Nuclear Agreement.|$|E
5|$|The {{annihilation}} of Khazaria was undertaken {{against the background}} of the Rus'-Byzantine alliance, concluded in the wake of Igor's Byzantine campaign in 944. Close military <b>ties</b> <b>between</b> the Rus' and Byzantium are illustrated by the fact, reported by John Skylitzes, that a Rus' detachment accompanied Byzantine Emperor Nikephoros Phokas in his victorious naval expedition to Crete.|$|E
5|$|The close {{geographic}} and cultural <b>ties</b> <b>between</b> the Riverina and northern Victoria, combined with continuing frustration with inter colonial tariffs, made the Riverina a fertile area for ideas for uniting the various colonies in an Australian federation. This {{would see the}} southern Riverina in particular take {{a leading role in}} bringing about federation.|$|E

5|$|As a {{token of}} respect for Roman religion, however, Elagabalus joined either Astarte, Minerva, Urania, or some {{combination}} of the three to Elagabal as consort. A union between Elagabal and a traditional goddess would have served to strengthen <b>ties</b> <b>between</b> the new religion and the imperial cult. In fact, there may have been an effort to introduce Elagabal, Urania, and Athena as the new Capitoline triad of Rome—replacing Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva.|$|E
5|$|As president, John Quincy Adams had {{previously}} disallowed {{trade between the}} United States and West Indies during his tenure. However, following {{the passage of the}} 1827 hurricane, the politician allowed free trade for three months. Presidential candidate Andrew Jackson soon became outspoken against cutting <b>ties</b> <b>between</b> the two regions, and his support for free trade garnered support from shipping interests that helped him win the presidency a year later.|$|E
5|$|Cheney's {{views on}} NATO {{reflected}} his skepticism about prospects for peaceful social {{development in the}} former Eastern Bloc countries, where he saw a high potential for political uncertainty and instability. He felt that the Bush Administration was too optimistic in supporting General Secretary of the CPSU Mikhail Gorbachev and his successor, Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Cheney worked to maintain strong <b>ties</b> <b>between</b> the United States and its European allies.|$|E

Festival participants included Janet Street-Porter and Benjamin Zephaniah.|$|E
5|$|King Stefan the First-Crowned, who {{had become}} ill, took monastic vows and died in 1227. Radoslav, the eldest son, became king; he was crowned at Žiča by his uncle, Archbishop Sava. Radoslav's younger brothers, Vladislav and Uroš I, {{received}} appanages. Sava II (Predislav) was appointed Bishop of Hum shortly thereafter, later serving as Archbishop of Serbia from 1263 to 1270. The Church and state was thus controlled by the same family, and the <b>ties</b> <b>between</b> the two continued.|$|E

5|$|The {{syndication}} {{deal for}} Secretariat precluded the horse racing past age three. Accordingly, Secretariat's last race was against older {{horses in the}} Canadian International Stakes over one and five-eighths miles on the turf at Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on October 28, 1973. The race was chosen {{in part because of}} long-time <b>ties</b> <b>between</b> E.P. Taylor and the Chenery family, and partly to honor Secretariat's Canadian connections, Laurin and Turcotte. Unfortunately, Turcotte missed the race with a five-day suspension: Eddie Maple got the mount.|$|E

5|$|There {{have not}} been any {{controlled}} studies on meth mouth, and several of its aspects are unclear. Although the condition has been popularized by media coverage and case reports, no systematic {{studies have been conducted}} to conclusively tie methamphetamine use to symptoms that are commonly described as meth mouth.

5|$|An {{international}} peace conference {{was held in}} Kano in Nigeria, in which Chad's bordering states participated along with Malloum, Habré, and Goukouni. The Kano Accord was signed on 16 March by all those present, and Malloum resigned, replaced by a Council of State under the chairmanship of Goukouni. This {{was a result of}} Nigerian and French pressures on Goukouni and Habré to share power; the French in particular saw this as part of their strategy to cut all <b>ties</b> <b>between</b> Goukouni and Gaddafi. A few weeks later, the same factions formed the Transitional Government of National Unity (GUNT), kept together to a considerable extent by the common desire to see Libya out of Chad.|$|E
