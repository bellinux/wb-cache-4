40|$|Information to stop desert {{encroachment}} in The Gambia Cue: Desertification {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious environmental problems facing Africa today. In parts of The Gambia, the loss of agricultural land to the desert is particularly serious, with drought, deforestation and the common occurrence of bush fires contributing to the problem. Protecting and enhancing the remaining forest resources is vital, and has been a key focus for work by the Gambia World Development Agency, a non-government organization based in the capital Banjul. Much of that work has involved spreading information and new technologies to people in the affected areas, and the organisation has used a wide variety of approaches to deliver that information. Susanna Thorp spoke to Kebba Bah, the Executive Director of the Agency, about the different approaches his organisation is using. She also wanted to find out about a new resource centre, recently established to co-ordinate natural resource management strategies in the country. But Mr Bah began by explaining how his agency had been helping communities to the north of the Gambia River, one of the most seriously affected areas, to learn how establishing community forests could help to protect their scarce forest resources. IN:		?We had a series of exchange visits? OUT:	?natural resources in the Gambia. ? DUR?N		 3 ? 26 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Kebba Bah, Executive Director of The Gambia World Development Agency. Transcript Bah	We had a series of exchange visits, for them to visit some successful community forests. But in the East areas where we are also operating we have encouraged them to be involved in agroforestry so that they would help revive the vegetation that is affected. Thorp	So you are encouraging them to grow particular trees that have certain properties that will be useful? Bah	That?s true. In some areas we incorporated improved cooking stoves, and they realised how much they would save in terms of fuel and walking distances of 7 - 10 km, especially the women to get some firewood, and this has turned out to be a very successful study, quite a lot of the women are doing it now in some villages. Thorp	Now you said one way of sharing information is actually by taking farmers from one area and showing them what?s happening in the successful areas, but you must be using other means of disseminating and communicating that information. What have you been doing to share that information more widely? Bah	The information we have been using the national radio station, and sometimes we use some commercial radio stations, community radio stations. We organise awareness days where we bring farmers together annually to share their experiences, that?s another area. We also encourage school children to come up with posters and to come up with dramas, as a debate, and of course, teachers involved in environmental studies disseminate and use this in their own curriculum, actually. But right now with the newly approved project by CTA of establishing an regional information centre, we are looking forward to continuously collaborating with Department of Forestry, Department of Agricultural Services and some of our other traditional partners in developing this regional natural resource management centre, funded by CTA, to be a centre of excellence to serve natural resource dissemination in the area. Thorp	So how do you think <b>that?s</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> change the way in which information is shared and natural resource management can be managed more carefully? Bah	Of course it will go a long way in disseminating information, especially in areas of bush fires, which is a major concern for the Gambia. It would go a long way in coming in with posters, coming with messages and coming with radio programs, so that we would hire resource persons, specialists in different sectors of natural resource management. We use them as panelists and disseminate this information over the media and over the radio television and radio Gambia and community radios, and the audience are given the chance to get back with questions in different languages that are spoken in the Gambia. Thorp	So you can have those agencies really sharing knowledge amongst themselves so that they have a common understanding of the different problems, but also you?re going at it now in a more holistic way, because instead of just providing information on soil or information on water, you can integrate that information and really give people what they need. Bah	That is true, because the human resources are not a problem in the Gambia, it?s a question of coordinating them and bringing them on board to see how they can best be effectively utilised. Thorp	So, a positive move then for good natural resource management in the Gambia for the future? Bah	For the future it is to maintain and develop this resource centre and bring all specialists on natural resource management of different domains under one umbrella, and come up with a committee that gathers advice and guidance to see how best we can forge ahead and save natural resources in the Gambia. End of track. Providing advice and information for natural resource management to prevent desertification and improve degraded lands in The Gambia...|$|E
40|$|Water {{rights in}} the Sahara Desert? CUE: What {{does it mean to}} have the right to water? Can a {{statement}} on water rights in a constitution achieve anything? And is it meaningful to tell people living in a dry area that they have a right to, for example, 20 litres of water per day, when that water may simply not exist? Virginia Roaf works for WaterAid, an international NGO that aims to improve the access of poor people to water and sanitation. Mike Davison went to the WaterAid office in London, and started by asking how useful she thought it was to give someone a right to water. IN: 		?The question of the right? OUT:		?coming from the local communities? DUR?N	 5 ? 08 BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Virginia Roaf of WaterAid describing some of the key issues raised by the right to water. Transcript Roaf	The question of the right to water is actually not as simple as it sounds. Everyone would agree that the right to water is a good right, it should be in the UN Declaration of Human Rights. But you also have to look at what is meant by the right to water, how much water, for whom, how clean is that water going to be? One of the problems of introducing a right to water is setting the standards that go with that. For example they might decide that everyone has a right to 20 litres per person per day. Now that?s obviously not going to be accessible to those people living in villages in rural areas, in the middle of the Sahara Desert for example, because that water is just not accessible; there isn?t that water in the ground. So setting a right to water which has unrealistic standards, you may actually find that the right to water works against the needs of the poorest. Maybe I can explain this best by looking at the right to housing. In South Africa the right to housing is enshrined in the constitution but along with that right to housing is also a long list of standards that are required to be met by that housing. For example they are to do with what the walls are to be made of, what the roof is to be made of. Now that?s obviously unaffordable to the poor who are presently living in shacks and in over crowded conditions. So while it?s a very good thing for the right to housing to be enshrined in the constitution it?s actually not accessible. Davison	So having that right to housing you would say is meaningless? Roaf	I think often it can be meaningless unless you?ve got a government that?s committed to creating the framework or the policies that will actually be able to deliver that housing. Davison	And if we were to carry that on to the example of the village in the Sahara Desert having a right to water, would you regard it in the same way? Roaf	Yes, I would say that rather than setting the standards for the right to water here in Britain or through the UN, I think it?s important to include local communities from poor areas, from developing countries, to ensure that the standards are not inaccessible. Davison	Do you think that if a country adds a statement on the right to water to its constitution, that is likely to help the poorer people who currently don?t have access to water? Roaf	I think that in some cases that will strengthen the poor community?s hand. I think it depends on whether the poor community is well organised and whether they know that they have the right to water. I think however that generally these rights that stand in the constitution become just words on a piece of paper and that they are actually more likely to protect the rights of the middle income people or the people in power than they are to protect the rights of the poor. Davison	Can you explain what you mean by that? Roaf	In Dhaka in Bangladesh a vast proportion of the population live in illegal settlements which they don?t have the rights to. It could be because it?s along the river bank or it?s on pavements or it?s on land which is ear-marked for other purposes, and the government is not willing to give land rights. There?s a community in an area called Tejganj where the people are living on a pavement adjacent to the factory where they are working. And they?ve been living there for maybe 25 or 30 years without access to adequate water and sanitation and the reason for that is the government is not prepared to provide water and sanitation to that community because they lack land title. So what WaterAid has done is actually to work with the community and they have negotiated with the local council, for the local council to give the community a 5 year, a short term lease, which will then allow the municipal supplier to actually provide water and sanitation. Interestingly this has caused a problem with the middle income community which lives opposite. The middle class community has decided that this is a threat to them and persuaded the local municipality to evict the community. Within a week the community were back living in that area because they had nowhere else to go. So they are actually now living in that area again and they are still obviously working in the factory. Davison	So that suggests that often when you get water rights you may well have a situation of conflict between two different groups? Roaf	There?s always going to be conflict over resources which are limited. The water supply in Dhaka probably reaches maybe 25 % of the population but obviously <b>that?s</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be going to the richer parts of that community. And so if the middle class community see that the water is now being accessed by poorer communities obviously there?s going to be less water to go around. Davison	To me water rights would seem to be quite a western concept. To what extent do you think that the communities that WaterAid is working with feel that they have a right to water? Roaf	I think that the people living in Dhaka in Bangladesh through the work that they?ve been doing in accessing their right to land has actually introduced ideas of rights of water to those communities. Davison	So the increasing awareness of water rights has come through increasing awareness and interest in land rights? Roaf	I would say that there is more interest now in water rights, yes, because there?s been interest in land rights and the demand is coming from the local communities. End of tape.

40|$|Harvesting, honey {{extraction}} and packaging Cue: As a food {{that is often}} eaten raw, the purity of honey {{is one of its}} most important characteristics. But honey is also a product that can easily be contaminated. Even storing honey in the wrong type of container can damage its flavour, and beekeepers must take care at every stage of harvesting and handling honey to ensure that contamination is avoided. For beekeepers who sell their own honey, having a clean product that buyers can trust is the cornerstone of their marketing strategy. And for those who sell to processors, if their honey is less than pure it will simply be rejected. Daniel Ball is the managing director of Forest Fruits, a company that buys honey from several thousand beekeepers in Zambia?s North-Western province. The beekeepers come from Mwinilunga, an area at the source of the Zambezi river. Forest Fruits not only buys honey from the beekeepers, but also provides training and some equipment. Daniel spoke to Chris Kakunta about the importance of hygiene in the production of top quality honey, much of which he exports to Europe and America. Chris asked him how beekeepers can protect the purity of their honey during the harvesting process. IN:		?The first thing farmers have to do is ? OUT:		?have confidence in your product. ? DUR?N:	 5 ? 51 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Daniel Ball, of the Zambian company Forest Fruits, which buys top quality honey from small scale beekeepers for export to Europe and America. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Ball	The first thing farmers {{have to do is to}} make sure they are prepared. When they are harvesting their beehives, it doesn?t matter what kind of beehive they are using; they must start by having the right equipment. Even if it is very basic equipment that is OK, but you need to have the right equipment so you need to plan for it. Kakunta	When you say basic equipment what are you referring to? Ball	Well, when you are harvesting honey you need to have buckets, containers that you can put the honey into, and those containers must not be metal, because honey takes on the taste of the metal, and that affects the taste. Therefore for the people who buy it, it is not that you can?t eat it, but it will not taste as nice. So you need a plastic bucket or a wooden bucket, but you should not have a metal bucket. And then of course the bucket should be clean, and it should have a lid, a top, that can seal against the moisture. Because honey sucks in water from the air, and if it sucks in water from the air eventually it can ferment. So you need a top or a lid that will seal against moisture in the air. And then besides a bucket, you probably need a sharp knife that is also clean. And then, in order to maintain your quality, most beekeepers should probably have a veil to protect their face. Now in our company, in Forest Fruits, we deal with about 6000 beekeepers, and when we started as a company we didn?t have money to give veils to beekeepers and we saw that that affected the quality. Once we had a bit of money we bought materials, made veils for our beekeepers, and we noticed that that changed the quality immediately. When people?s eyes and nose and face is protected, then they are willing to stay with the bees longer. So you need some protective equipment. At the very minimum you need a veil to protect your face. If you can get some gloves, that is also good. If you have those things you will stay longer with your bees, and you?ll be able to work with the honey a bit more. Kakunta	In short, you are trying to say that while working with the bees you must exercise a little bit of patience? Ball	Very much. You can?t rush in and rush out. If you rush in, your quality will be affected. And if you are looking to find a good market beyond the village, then definitely you must take time to take care of your product, not just your product, but also your bees. Kakunta	Apart from a metal container, what are some of the things that you consider as contaminating factors? Ball	Well if you have a bucket and you have been using it for fertiliser, that will contaminate your honey. So fertiliser is one thing. If you have been carrying diesel or oil or petrol or any chemicals in that container, you should never use it for food, because it will definitely be contaminated. Kakunta	Once you have harvested your honey, there comes now the issue of extracting. During this process do you foresee any contamination as well? Ball	Yes, in extraction you also have to be careful. If you are extracting in the village then you must be careful. If it?s raining or it?s in the rainy season then you must extract quickly, otherwise the honey will suck up moisture from the air and that will cause it to ferment. Also, in the village if you are processing you must be careful that you don?t have too much smoke. Now when you are harvesting you use some smoke; you should use just a little bit of smoke. If you use too much that smoke can be tasted in the honey. And then when you are processing in the village, if you are processing under the, what we call the chota here in Zambia, which is the small thatched building, and if you have a fire in there, the smoke will be going into the honey. So you must be careful there that the smoke doesn?t go into the honey. Remember that honey should taste like the flowers that the bees take it from, and every beekeeper can tell you that, yes, this is good honey, because it actually tastes like the flowers, and it smells like the flowers. If the quality is affected by poor processing or poor extraction in the village, then definitely the taste and the smell is going to change. Kakunta	Sometimes there is also the issue of filtering or straining the honey to remove any impurities. What type of materials do you recommend for beekeepers to use? Ball	Well you can use simple things like mosquito gauze. If you are selling a finished product in the village, then definitely straining it is important. But if you are selling it to a larger processor, then straining it is not so important. It just depends how you are going to sell it. But if you are going to strain it then mosquito gauze is OK. Kakunta	What type of conditions do you need to package your honey? Ball	Well as I mentioned before, one of the most important things with honey is that you make sure that you package it in a container that you can seal. If it?s got plenty of holes in it, or it is allowing the moisture or the air in, <b>that?s</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> affect the quality. Remember, honey sucks up moisture from the air, and that is an enemy of honey. Kakunta	How important is the issue of labelling? Ball	Anyone who buys it will want to know when it was harvested. What we do with our farmers is, it is labelled with their name and the name of the village and the date that it was harvested, and that is enough. Once that label is on there we know what to do with it as a processor, as a packer. But a small beekeeper, if you have the date that it was harvested, your name and your village, then people are going to have confidence in your product. End of track.
