5|$|Topoisomerases {{introduce}} both single- and double-strand {{breaks in}} the course of changing the DNA's state of supercoiling, which is especially common in regions near an open replication fork. Such breaks are not considered DNA damage because they are a natural intermediate in the topoisomerase biochemical mechanism and are immediately repaired by the enzymes <b>that</b> <b>created</b> them.|$|E

Some planets and moons accumulate enough heat to drive geologic processes such as volcanism and tectonics. Those that accumulate or retain an atmosphere can also undergo surface erosion from wind or water. Smaller bodies, without tidal heating, cool more quickly; and their geological activity ceases {{with the exception of}} impact cratering.|$|E

5|$|Aboriginal peoples have {{inhabited}} {{what is now}} Manitoba {{for thousands}} of years. In the late 17th century, fur traders arrived in the area when {{it was part of}} Rupert's Land and owned by the Hudson's Bay Company. In 1869, negotiations for the creation of the province of Manitoba led to an armed uprising of the Métis people against the Government of Canada, a conflict known as the Red River Rebellion. The rebellion's resolution led to the Parliament of Canada passing the Manitoba Act in 1870 <b>that</b> <b>created</b> the province.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin Hudson {{suggested}} {{that it was only}} the vigorous campaigning by Niall Glúndub in Ulster and Connacht from 913 to 915, along with Óengus's fortuitous death, that led to Niall being named Flann's heir. Alex Woolf {{suggested that}} Flann had not only attempted to monopolise the succession within his family, but had come close to instituting a national kingship in Ireland comparable to <b>that</b> <b>created</b> by his contemporaries Alfred the Great and Edward the Elder in England from their Kingdom of Wessex.|$|E
5|$|Blaine and Harrison {{wished to}} see American power and trade {{expanded}} across the Pacific and were {{especially interested in}} securing rights to harbors in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and Pago Pago, Samoa.

Bayard, Blaine’s predecessor, had accepted {{an invitation to a}} three-party conference in Berlin aimed at resolving the dispute, and Blaine appointed American representatives to attend. The result was a treaty <b>that</b> <b>created</b> a condominium among the three powers, allowing all of them access to the harbor.|$|E

5|$|During {{the sixteenth}} century, Scotland {{underwent}} a Protestant Reformation <b>that</b> <b>created</b> a predominantly Calvinist national Church of Scotland (kirk), which was strongly Presbyterian in outlook. Scotland's ecclesiastical art paid a heavy toll {{as a result}} of Protestant iconoclasm, with the almost total loss of medieval stained glass, religious sculpture and paintings. The nature of the Scottish Reformation may have had wider effects, limiting the creation of a culture of public display and meaning that art was channelled into more austere forms of expression with an emphasis on private and domestic restraint.|$|E
