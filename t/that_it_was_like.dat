5|$|Unlike {{that of the}} pied currawong, {{the grey}} currawong's call does not sound like its name. It {{is best known for}} making a sound {{variously}} transcribed as p'rink, clink, cling, ker-link or tullock, either in flight or when gathered in any numbers. The call has been described as very loud and ringing in the Tasmanian and Kangaroo Island subspecies; Edwin Ashby wrote that in Tasmania it was akin to the squeaking of a wheelbarrow and Gregory Mathews <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> the kling of an anvil. Elsewhere, their call has been likened to the screech of ungreased metal grinding in Victoria and South Australia (races versicolor and melanoptera are noted as similar to each other), and as a harsh squeak in Western Australia. The clinking call resembles that of the superb lyrebird, which imitates the currawong call at times.|$|E

Nagel stated, “An organism has conscious mental states if and only if there <b>is</b> something <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to <b>be</b> <b>that</b> organism - something <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> for the organism to be itself.” ...|$|R

25|$|Popular stories claim {{one of the}} Confederate half dollars {{was given}} to Confederate President Jefferson Davis. This story has no basis in fact. In an 1879 letter to Ebenezer Mason, Davis {{confirmed}} that a Union soldier (actually a Federal Officer) stole a coin {{from one of his}} wife’s trunks, but could not confirm <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> the then known Confederate half dollar. It is very possible that the coin was a gold so-called Jefferson Davis dime struck at the Paris (France) Mint, which Davis described to coin dealer Ed Frossard in an 1880 letter. All known Jefferson Davis dimes were struck in silver at the Paris Mint. The Davis letter is the only known reference to a gold specimen, which was likely a special presentation piece made for Davis.|$|E
25|$|In his speech, Pericles {{states that}} he had been emphasising the greatness of Athens in order to convey that the {{citizens}} of Athens must continue to support the war, to show them that what they were fighting for was of the utmost importance. To help make his point he stated that the soldiers who he was speaking of gave their lives to a cause to protect the city of Athens, its citizens, and its freedom. He praised Athens for its attributes that stood out amongst their neighbours such as its democracy when he elaborates that trust is justly placed on the citizens rather than relying only on the system and the policy of the city. Where citizens boast a freedom that differs from their enemies’ the Lacedaemonians. He regards the soldiers who gave their lives as truly worth of merit. That if anyone should ask, they should look at their final moments when they gave their lives to their country and that should leave no doubt {{in the mind of the}} doubtful. He explained that fighting for one’s country was a great honour, and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> wearing a cloak that concealed any negative implications because his imperfections would be outweighed by his merits as a citizen. He praises the soldiers for not faltering in their execution during the war. That the soldiers put aside their desires and wishes for the greater cause. Because as they are described by Pericles, Athenian citizens were distinct from the citizens of other nations – they were open minded, tolerant, and ready to understand and follow orders. Where their system of democracy allowed them to have a voice amongst those who made important decisions that would affect them. Therefore, he proceeds to point out that the greatest honour and act of valour in Athens is to live and die for freedom of the state Pericles believed was different and more special than any other neighbouring city.|$|E

[...] is a {{paper by}} American philosopher Thomas Nagel, first {{published}} in The Philosophical Review in October 1974, and later in Nagel's Mortal Questions (1979). In <b>it,</b> Nagel argues <b>that</b> materialist theories of mind omit the essential component of consciousness, namely that there <b>is</b> something <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> (or feels) <b>like</b> to <b>be</b> a particular, conscious thing. He argued that an organism had conscious mental states, [...] "if and only if there <b>is</b> something <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to <b>be</b> <b>that</b> organism—something <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> for the organism."

According to Thompson, the book remained hugely popular in the Congo even after the country achieved independence in 1960. Nevertheless, government figures in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have criticised the book. In 2004, after the Belgian Minister of Foreign Affairs Karel De Gucht described President Joseph Kabila's provisional DRC government as incompetent, Congolese Information Minister Henri Mova Sakanyi accused him of [...] "racism and nostalgia for colonialism", remarking <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> [...] "Tintin in the Congo all over again."

40|$|In “What <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> to <b>be</b> {{boring and}} myopic?” Kathleen Akins offers an interesting, empirically driven, {{argument}} for thinking that there <b>is</b> nothing <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to <b>be</b> a bat. She suggests that bats are “boring” {{in the sense}} that they are governed by behavioral scripts and simple, non-representational, control loops, and are best characterized as biological automatons. Her approach has been well received by philosophers sympathetic to empirically informed philosophy of mind. But, despite its influence, her work has not met with any critical appraisal. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> argued <b>that</b> a reconsideration of the empirical results shows that bats are not boring automatons, driven by short input-output loops, instincts, and reflexes. Grounds are provided for thinking that bats satisfy a range of philosophically and scientifically interesting elaborations of the general idea that consciousness is best understood in terms of representational functions. A more complete examination of bat sensory capabilities suggests there <b>is</b> something <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> after all. The discussion of bats is also used to develop an objection to strongly neurophilosophical approaches to animal consciousness...|$|R

He realized that McClellan was a strong organizer and a skilled trainer of troops, able to recombine the units of Pope's army with the Army of the Potomac faster than anyone. On September 2, 1862, Lincoln named McClellan to command [...] "the fortifications of Washington, and all the troops for the defense of the capital." [...] The appointment was controversial in the Cabinet, a majority of whom signed a petition declaring to the president [...] "our deliberate opinion that, at this time, it is not safe to entrust to Major General McClellan the command of any Army of the United States."
