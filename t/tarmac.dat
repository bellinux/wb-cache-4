5|$|The <b>Tarmac</b> Group (now Carillion) won the {{construction}} bid in 1956, including 19 bridges; John Cox was the onsite engineer {{assigned by the}} contractor to oversee {{the construction}}.|$|E
5|$|Both {{buildings}} {{were designed by}} architects Yorke Rosenberg Mardall, with engineering consultation from Engineering & Power Consultants Ltd. The power station was constructed by <b>Tarmac</b> Construction and the smelter by M.J. Gleeson Company. Both the power station and smelter were brought into operation in March 1972.|$|E
5|$|Contract 4 (Essington) was {{the largest}} contract, and was awarded to <b>Tarmac</b> Construction (present day Carillion). This section took the longest to complete, and faced {{opposition}} from Staffordshire County Council who wanted disruption at the junction with the M6 to remain minimal.|$|E
50|$|Migori is {{connected}} by {{road to the}} Masai Mara national park, but the road is in poor condition. Migori town is immediately after Awendo, (where the Sony Sugar Company is situated), Oyani, Stella and Kakrao areas.The road to Isebania is well <b>tarmacked</b> from Kakrao to Mwanza in Tanzania. The road connecting Migori town to Masara is also currently <b>tarmacked.</b>|$|R

5|$|Improbably, the {{excavators}} {{found the}} {{remains in the}} first location in which they dug at the car park. Coincidentally, they lay almost directly under a roughly painted 'R' on the <b>tarmac.</b> This had existed since the early 2000s to signify a reserved parking space.|$|E
5|$|To remedy {{crumbling}} <b>tarmac</b> {{along the}} tracks on Princes Street, {{the road was}} closed in September 2011 and remained closed for ten months. A road closure between Haymarket and Shandwick Place in March 2012 led to complaints from businesses and residents. It remained closed until October 2013.|$|E
5|$|After further {{slippage}} in the timescales, {{the opening}} date was revised from late June 2015 to 19 August 2015. The delay was explained as being due to needing to undertake additional work to stabilise the road foundation in two locations {{to make it}} suitable to lay <b>tarmac</b> on. The road finally opened {{on the evening of}} 19 August 2015, costing £20.4M in total, of which Sefton Council funded £5.9M (approximately 30%) of the cost.|$|E

5|$|Creel turns {{himself into}} <b>tarmac</b> {{in front of}} the vehicle that Idaho, Hartley, and Hunter are in, causing it to flip. Hartley and Idaho are killed, and Creel {{retrieves}} the Obelisk for his employer, Sunil Bakshi. In an end tag, Bakshi is shown to be working for Reinhardt, now going by the name Daniel Whitehall, who {{does not appear to have}} aged since 1945.|$|E
5|$|Early in the afternoon, the North Korean {{aircraft}} {{returned in}} larger numbers {{to attack the}} air transports. A flight of eight Ilyushin Il-10s appeared in the airspace between Seoul and Inchon, attempting to ambush transport aircraft while still {{on the ground at}} the airfields. The F-80s spotted the North Korean planes and engaged them. The North Korean aircraft split into two groups of four and quickly destroyed a Republic of Korea Air Force T-6 Texan parked on the <b>tarmac</b> at Kimpo.|$|E
5|$|On 5 September 1986, four ANO gunmen hijacked Pan Am Flight 73 at Karachi Airport on its {{way from}} Mumbai to New York, holding 389 {{passengers}} and crew for 16 hours in the plane on the <b>tarmac</b> before detonating grenades inside the cabin. Neerja Bhanot, the flight's senior purser, was able to open an emergency door, and most passengers escaped; 20 died, including Bhanot, and 120 were wounded. The London Times reported in March 2004 that Libya had been behind the hijacking.|$|E

50|$|The biggest asset of the {{district}} is perhaps the continued prevalence of peace and security for the last 25 years and denunciation of rebellion which has attracted many developmental projects. Major achievements include infrastructural transformation such as the <b>tarmacking</b> of the Arua to Karuma Highway, the West Nile Rural Electrification Project and numerous telephone communication networks that have been established in the region. During 2013, the <b>tarmacking</b> of the Vurra-Arua-Koboko-Oraba Road began.|$|R
5|$|On August 21, 1983, Marcos' chief rival, {{opposition}} leader Benigno Aquino, Jr., was assassinated on the <b>tarmac</b> at Manila International Airport. Marcos eventually called snap presidential elections in 1986. Marcos was proclaimed the winner, {{but the results}} were widely regarded as fraudulent, leading to the People Power Revolution. Marcos and his allies fled to Hawaii and Aquino's widow, Corazon Aquino was recognized as president.|$|E
5|$|The public roads {{from the}} Indianapolis corner to the Porsche Curves were re-surfaced. Run-off areas at the Dunlop Chicane, Tertre Rouge, Indianapolis, and Ford Chicanes were also {{partially}} asphalted {{in order to}} avoid gravel being brought back onto the circuit by cars which had gone off course. This also increased safety by allowing the cars to slow themselves more efficiently using their brakes and tyres on <b>tarmac.</b>|$|E
5|$|The robot {{has several}} {{possible}} responses to any obstacles. These {{will depend on}} its environment (navigation corridor, <b>tarmac</b> area without many obstacles, cluttered indoor environment etc.) {{at the time of}} the encounter with an obstacle. It can stop and wait for a gap in traffic, or avoid an obstacle by using a technique based on a spiral, or perform path planning trajectories.|$|E

5|$|Toivonen {{started his}} career in circuit racing and was also very {{competitive}} on <b>tarmac.</b> He raced successfully in two World Sportscar Championship events, achieved praise from Eddie Jordan, in whose Formula Three team Toivonen made a few guest appearances, and impressed in his Formula One test for March Grand Prix. The annual Race of Champions, originally organised in Toivonen's memory, awards the winning individual driver the Henri Toivonen Memorial Trophy.|$|E
5|$|At 5:24pm Cooper was {{informed}} that his demands had been met, and at 5:39pm the aircraft landed at Seattle-Tacoma Airport. Cooper instructed Scott to taxi the jet to an isolated, brightly lit section of the <b>tarmac</b> and close each window shade in the cabin to deter police snipers. Northwest Orient's Seattle operations manager, Al Lee, approached the aircraft in street clothes (to avoid the possibility that Cooper might mistake his airline uniform for that of a police officer) and delivered the cash-filled knapsack and parachutes to Mucklow via the aft stairs. Once the delivery was completed, Cooper permitted all passengers, Schaffner, and senior flight attendant Alice Hancock to leave the plane.|$|E
5|$|Colin McRae Rally is a rally racing {{video game}} {{developed}} {{and published by}} Codemasters. It was originally released for iOS mobile devices in June 2013, and then ported to Android devices and OS X and Windows personal computers (PCs) in 2014. Gameplay is similar to early iterations of the Colin McRae Rally series of racing games with content predominantly taken from the 2000 title Colin McRae Rally 2.0. Players can drive cars and participate in point-to-point rally events, competing against times recorded by computer drivers. Stages take place in several different locations with varied terrain like <b>tarmac</b> and gravel. The game features damage modelling and chassis deformation effects that can be sustained from collisions.|$|E
50|$|The town is the {{southern}} end of the Isebania-Kisii-Ahero Road. In addition to the highway, other roads in the town are being <b>tarmacked.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{roads are}} mostly <b>tarmacked</b> and are {{of an average}} grade for Belarusian road ways. The nearest {{airports}} are in Minsk and Krupki has a railway station.|$|R
50|$|Matugga is the {{starting}} point of the Matugga-Kapeeka Road, a 42 km <b>tarmacked</b> road connecting the towns of Matugga, Gombe, Semuto, and Kapeeka. The highway traverses Wakiso District and Nakaseke District.|$|R
5|$|Each season {{normally}} {{consists of}} 12 to 16 rallies driven on surfaces ranging from gravel and <b>tarmac</b> to snow and ice. Points from these events are calculated towards the drivers' and manufacturers' world championships. The driver's championship and manufacturer's championship are separate championships, but {{are based on}} the same point system. In the current points system, points are awarded {{at the end of each}} rally to the top ten WRC (overall), junior and production car drivers that qualify as follows: 25, 18, 15, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, 1. Despite how many drivers are in one team, constructors can only nominate two drivers to score points for the team as well as scoring for themselves.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{examination}} for {{the construction}} of what would become Penticton Regional Airport began in 1937, at two locations. The proposed areas—west of Penticton's city centre and north of the Skaha Lake—were owned by the Penticton Indian Band. The land for the airport was expropriated from the band in 1949 under the War Measures Act, with the preliminary development of the airfield completed in 1941. Because of wartime military air transportation concerns, the airport acted as an emergency landing strip until its <b>tarmac</b> was completed. Rights for a temporary public use airport were secured in 1945for an operation of 24hours a day. In 1946, more land was acquired from the Penticton Indian Band for the airport's use.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{priorities}} of the regeneration was {{the restoration of the}} dock system, which had deteriorated rapidly since the Brunswick Dock gates had been left open. Contaminated silt was removed from the dock basin, dock gates were replaced & bridges restored, whilst the dock walls were repaired. The Albert Dock company appointed <b>Tarmac</b> to renovate the dock's vast warehouses and repair war time bomb damage. Structural surveys carried out by the MDC found the brickwork and foundations to be in very good condition and it was considered a testament to the strict build quality of Hartley's design that a building almost 150 years old was still in such good condition.|$|E
50|$|There is {{only public}} access to the lane itself. The <b>tarmacked</b> road {{continues}} as a bridleway beyond the Barnet boundary to Saffron Green Meadows in Hertfordshire and to the A1 road.|$|R
40|$|The fences snake for miles, {{often with}} no discernable entrances. Sometimes they are ornate brick constructions, with large blazing lamps every metre or so. Often they’re just {{anonymous}} metal sheeting or chain-links anchored by metal posts. Every year the fences advance, claiming more land. Sometimes {{you can see}} over or through the fence: a street with a <b>tarmacked</b> road. Last year the fence {{was on the other}} side of the street, the road accessible to locals. Now the fence has moved with no reasons given and no public notice made. Now nobody can use the <b>tarmacked</b> road...|$|R
50|$|It {{is a small}} {{air base}} with a few taxiways and <b>tarmacs.</b> Google Earth {{high-resolution}} images show that airfield has been vacated by the military; only one small twin-engine prop plane is found.|$|R
