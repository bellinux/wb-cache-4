5|$|Lieutenant Colonel Cameron Mitchell {{is the son}} of Frank and Wendy Mitchell, long-time {{residents}} of Auburn, Kansas. Mitchell occasionally mentions his Bible-thumping grandmother in comparison and contrast to the Ori religion.

5|$|Some seamounts {{have not}} been mapped and thus pose a navigational danger. For instance, Muirfield Seamount is named after <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> hit it in 1973. More recently, the {{submarine}} USS San Francisco ran into an uncharted seamount in 2005 at a speed of , sustaining serious damage and killing one seaman.|$|E
5|$|A {{contract}} to build <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> would become Agincourt was signed on 3June 1911, and its keel was laid on 14September 1911. The design {{called for a}} staggering fourteen 12-inch guns, something historian David Topliss attributed to political necessity: the ship had to appear more powerful to the Brazilian populace than her predecessors (with twelve 12-inch guns) but, without increasing the gun size, the only option left was increasing {{the total number of}} guns.|$|E

5|$|After {{a futile}} attempt to {{approach}} Herald Island, the ship began the journey back to Alaska; {{next day she}} encountered Bear, with Bartlett aboard. McConnell records that the party were unanimous in their desire to remain with <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> had effected their rescue, but Bartlett ordered them aboard Bear. Before returning to Alaska, Bear made a final attempt to reach Herald Island; ice limited their approach to , and they saw no signs of life. The reunited party arrived at Nome on 13 September, to a great welcome from the local population.|$|E
5|$|After the February Revolution, the {{condition}} of the ships was assessed on 28 April 1917. <b>The</b> <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> was furthest along was the Ismail: her hull, engines, and boilers were around 65% complete, and her armour was 36% complete. Her turrets, however, were not expected to be completed until 1919. The Congress of Shipyard Workers decided to continue work on the Izmail in mid-1917, but only to provide jobs. The Provisional Government halted all work on Borodino, Kinburn, and Navarin on 24 October 1917, and the Soviet Supreme Naval College ordered work on Izmail halted on 14 December 1917.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} large numbers, many seamounts {{remain to be}} {{properly}} studied, and even mapped. Bathymetry and satellite altimetry are two technologies working to close the gap. There have been instances where naval vessels have collided with uncharted seamounts; for example, Muirfield Seamount is named after <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> struck it in 1973. However, the greatest danger from seamounts are flank collapses; as they get older, extrusions seeping in the seamounts put pressure on their sides, causing landslides that {{have the potential to}} generate massive tsunamis.|$|E

5|$|Benedict Arnold and John André {{finally met}} on September 21 at the Joshua Hett Smith House. On {{the morning of}} September 22, the outpost at Verplanck's Point under command of Col. James Livingston fired on HMS Vulture, <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> was {{intended}} to carry André back to New York. This action did sufficient damage that she retreated downriver, forcing André to return to New York overland.

5|$|Pirates of the Caribbean was {{the first}} film {{released}} under the Walt Disney Pictures banner to be rated PG-13 by the MPAA; one executive noted that she found the film too intense for her five-year-old child. Nonetheless, the studio was confident enough to add The Curse of the Black Pearl subtitle to the film in case sequels were made, and to attract older children. Verbinski disliked the new title {{because it is the}} Aztec gold rather than <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> is cursed, so he requested the title to be unreadable on the poster.|$|E

The final construction cost for the ship was $91,000.|$|E

5|$|This bucentaur was {{frequently}} {{referred to in}} Venetian chronicles. It was on <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> on 15 July 1547 Henry II of France was conveyed with the doge down the Grand Canal to the Ca' Foscari where he stayed {{during his visit to}} Venice. The ship was also used to transport the newly crowned Dogaressa Morosina Morosini-Grimani to the Doge's Palace on 4 May 1597. This event was the subject of numerous etchings and paintings by Giacomo Franco, Andrea Vicentino, Sebastian Vrancx and anonymous artists.|$|E
5|$|In {{the centre}} of York, in St Helen's Square, there is the York branch of Bettys Café Tea Rooms. Bettys founder, Frederick Belmont, {{travelled}} on the maiden voyage of the Queen Mary in 1936. He was so impressed by the splendour of <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> he employed the Queen Mary's designers and craftsmen to turn a dilapidated furniture store in York into an elegant café in St Helen's Square. A few years after Bettys opened in York war broke out, and the basement 'Bettys Bar' became a favourite haunt {{of the thousands of}} airmen stationed around York. 'Bettys Mirror', on which many of them engraved their signatures with a diamond pen, remains on display today as a tribute to them.|$|E
5|$|The {{condition}} of the Ottoman fleet could not be concealed from foreign observers. The fleet {{proved to be an}} embarrassment for the government and finally forced Sultan Abdul Hamid II to authorize a modernization program, which recommended that the ironclads be modernized in foreign shipyards. German firms, including Krupp, Schichau-Werke, and AG Vulcan, were to rebuild the ships, but after having surveyed them, withdrew from the project in December 1897 owing to the impracticality of modernizing the ships and the inability of the Ottoman government to pay for the work due to its weak finances. Negotiations dragged on into the early 1900s, but Hamidiye {{was not included in the}} program. Instead, Hamidiye was decommissioned in 1903; the Ottoman Navy considered rebuilding <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> year, like many of the other ironclads, but the ship was in too poor a condition to merit reconstruction. On 11 November 1909, she was placed for sale, and she was finally purchased by ship breakers in 1913 and thereafter dismantled.|$|E

5|$|After Daniel parachutes from {{a failing}} {{helicopter}} onto the island, he uses Naomi's phone to contact George Minkowski (Fisher Stevens) on <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> he came from. The next morning, on December 22, 2004, {{two of the}} flight 815 survivors – Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) – help Daniel find his colleagues, as the rival group led by Locke attempts to do the same. Jack and Kate find Miles, who demands to see Naomi's body, and ascertains that Naomi was killed by Kate as Naomi said a code on the phone before dying. Kate confesses then that Naoimi was killed by John Locke. Locke's group finds Charlotte, takes her prisoner, and disposes of her tracking device. Daniel's third colleague, helicopter pilot Frank, fires a flare into the sky, leading Jack's group to him. Frank tells Jack's group that he managed to land the helicopter intact. After finding out that Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) {{is one of the}} Others, Miles demands to know where Ben (Michael Emerson) is, as locating him is the freighter crew's primary objective. In Locke's group, several people become discontent with Locke's revelation that he is following the instructions of Walt Lloyd (Malcolm David Kelley), who had left the island a month earlier, and they also question why Ben is being kept alive. Locke holds him at gunpoint, and Ben starts to reveal information about the Kahana crew, specifically Charlotte's identity and that he has a spy aboard the ship.|$|E
5|$|Given a {{classical}} name for Japan, Fusō was {{built at the}} Samuda Brothers shipyard in Cubitt Town, London. Japanese sources universally give the date for Kongōs keel-laying as 24 September 1875the same as that for the awarding of the contractbut historian Hans Langerer describes this as improbable, arguing that no shipyard would order enough material to begin construction without cash in hand. Fusō was launched on 14 April 1877 when Ueno Ikuko, wife of the Japanese consul, cut the retaining rope with a hammer and chisel. Completed in January 1878, the ship sailed for Japan before 22 March {{under the command of}} a British captain and with a British crew because the IJN was not yet ready for such a long voyage. While transiting the Suez Canal, she was lightly damaged when she ran aground on 27 April. She received temporary repairs at a local dockyard and arrived in Yokohama on 11 June. She was classified as a second-class warship while still in transit. She was transferred to Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on 17 June for permanent repairs. On 10 July a formal ceremony was held in Yokohama for the receipt of <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> was attended by the Meiji Emperor and many senior government officials. The ship was then opened for tours by the nobility, their families and invited guests for three days after the ceremony. Beginning on 14 July, the general public was allowed to tour the ship for a week.|$|E

5|$|On 12 June 1917, {{well before}} Mutsu was laid down, Hiraga {{proposed}} a revised design for <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> reflected the {{lessons from the}} Battle of Jutland that had occurred the previous year, and incorporated advances in boiler technology. Given project number A-125, his design added an extra twin main-gun turret, using space and weight made available by {{the reduction of the}} number of boilers from 21 to 12, while the power remained the same. He reduced the secondary armament from 20 guns to 16, although they were raised in height to improve their ability to fire during heavy weather and to improve their arcs of fire. To increase the ship's protection he proposed angling the belt armor outwards to improve its resistance to horizontal fire, and increasing the thickness of the lower deck armor and the torpedo bulkhead. Hiraga also planned to add anti-torpedo bulges to improve underwater protection. He estimated that his ship would displace as much as Nagato, although it would cost about a million yen more. Hiraga's changes would have considerably delayed Mutsus completion and were rejected by the Navy Ministry.|$|E
5|$|On Elizabeth's {{death in}} 1603 she was succeeded by James I. Strongly {{influenced}} by Scotland's {{separation from the}} Catholic Church during the Scottish Reformation, James was intensely interested in Protestant theology, focusing much of his curiosity on the theology of witchcraft. By the early 1590s he had become convinced {{that he was being}} plotted against by Scottish witches. After a visit to Denmark, he had attended the trial in 1590 of the North Berwick witches, who were convicted of using witchcraft to send a storm against <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>that</b> carried James and his wife Anne back to Scotland. In 1597 he wrote a book, Daemonologie, instructing his followers that they must denounce and prosecute any supporters or practitioners of witchcraft. One year after James acceded to the English throne, a law was enacted imposing the death penalty in cases where it was proven that harm had been caused through the use of magic, or corpses had been exhumed for magical purposes. James was, however, sceptical of the evidence presented in witch trials, even to the extent of personally exposing discrepancies in the testimonies presented against some accused witches.|$|E
5|$|The {{contract}} for Hiei {{was awarded to}} Milford Haven Shipbuilding and Engineering Co. in Pembroke Dock, Wales, on 24 September 1875 {{for the price of}} £119,600, exclusive of armament. Japanese sources universally give the date for Hieis keel-laying as 24 September 1875—the same as that for the awarding of the contract—but historian Hans Langerer describes this as improbable, arguing that no shipyard would order enough material to begin construction without cash in hand. She was launched on 12 June 1877; Reed's daughter smashed a bottle of champagne on the ship's bow in the traditional Western style. The ship was named for Mount Hiei. Completed in February 1878, Hiei sailed for Japan on 22 March under the command of a British captain and with a British crew because the IJN was not yet ready for such a long voyage. One of the passengers aboard her was the future admiral Togo Heihachiro, who had just completed six years of study in the United Kingdom. She arrived in Yokohama on 22 May and was assigned to the Tokai Naval District a month later.
