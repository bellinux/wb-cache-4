40|$|The Office of Inspector General`s (OIG) April 1995 {{report found}} that {{couriers}} received too much overtime and incurred too much unproductive time. This finding occurred because the Transportation Safeguards Division (TSD) employed a traditional work schedule that {{did not meet the}} demands of the job. The report recommended implementing an alternative work schedule that corresponded more closely to the couriers` actual work requirements. Management agreed to conduct a comparative analysis of work schedules to evaluate potential savings. The objectives of this audit were to (1) follow up on actions taken {{as a result of the}} OIG`s previous report, (2) determine if courier work schedules are cost effective, and (3) determine the cost effectiveness of escort vehicle replacements. The authors recommend: (1) implementing an alternative work schedule for courier which would achieve savings in overtime and unproductive time, while efficiently and cost effectively fulfilling TSD`s mission; (2) reexamining and adjusting the staffing level of each courier section in relation to the workload requirements in the area; and (3) discontinuing payment for travel time between courier lodging and <b>temporary</b> <b>duty</b> <b>stations.</b> The Albuquerque Operations Office agreed with the auditor`s findings and recommendations...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe requirement to provide en route <b>temporary</b> <b>duty</b> training {{is not unique}} to the Navy, but is a requirement common to al four military services. This thesis is a comparative study as to how the Navy and its sister services plan, program and budget for active duty personnel training conducted en route between permanent <b>duty</b> <b>stations.</b> Specific attention will be given to the Navy's <b>Temporary</b> <b>Duty</b> Under Instruction (TEMDUINS). This thesis will also examine related programs used by the United States Army, Air Force and Marine Corps to determine how they manage their en route training activities.
