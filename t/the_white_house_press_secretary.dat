Davis filed a request with the U.S. Supreme Court to stay his execution. Almost an hour after Davis's scheduled execution time, the Supreme Court announced they would review his petition, thereby postponing the execution. The Supreme Court, however, denied Davis's petition, after deliberating for several hours.|$|E

Kovaleski, whom in her words Trump [...] "outranked in privilege, power and the capacity to fight back", and that [...] "When the powerful use their position to bully, we all lose." [...] She also said [...] "Hollywood is crawling with outsiders and foreigners, and if you kick us all out, you'll have nothing to watch except for football and mixed martial arts, which are not arts". Trump responded on Twitter by calling Streep [...] "one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood" [...] and [...] "a Hillary flunky who lost big". <b>The</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>press</b> <b>secretary</b> at the time, Josh Earnest, defended Streep's comments, saying that she was exercising her First Amendment rights to freedom of speech.|$|E

[...] James Hormel, who was appointed by Clinton as the first openly gay U.S. Ambassador, described the reaction from the gay community to Clinton signing DOMA as shock and anger. On Hormel's account, Clinton {{had been the first}} President to advocate gay rights, push for AIDS funding, support gay and lesbian civil rights legislation, and appoint open LGBT people to his Administration.
