5|$|A {{dust devil}} (also {{known as a}} whirlwind) resembles a tornado {{in that it is}} a {{vertical}} swirling column of air.

If there is enough low level wind shear, the column of hot, rising air can develop a small cyclonic motion that can be seen near the ground. They are not considered tornadoes because they form during fair weather and are not associated with any clouds. However, they can, on occasion, result in major damage.|$|E

5|$|Given {{the size}} of the Austrian force {{approaching}} him, Ney planned to withdraw to Winterthur.

His small force would receive reinforcements from Soult's division. Consequently, Ney directed <b>the</b> <b>weakest</b> brigade, under the command of Gazan, to move up a long valley toward Frauenfeld, and another brigade, under the command of Roget, to take the right, preventing any Austrian flanking manoeuvre.|$|E
