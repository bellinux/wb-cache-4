5|$|The {{killing of}} civilians living in Voćin and two nearby smaller villages began on 13 December at noon. The White Eagles infantry, {{supported}} {{by at least}} one tank, moved through Voćin bombing Croat-owned houses and killing civilians. The killings and the destruction took twelve hours and claimed the lives of 43 civilians. The bodies of <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> mutilated and left on display, presumably as a warning to others, outside Voćin itself, to flee or perish. All <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> Croat civilians, except one 77-year-old Serb who had tried to protect his neighbours from the paramilitaries. Most of <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> elderly, including twelve women aged 56–76 and eleven men aged 60–84.|$|E
5|$|Jurors {{were taken}} to sites {{involved}} in the case, including the exterior of Wright's rented house and the sites where <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> found.|$|E
5|$|On 27 July 2010, {{the names}} of all <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> inscribed on a {{memorial}} installed near the crash site which was destroyed by vandals on 5 October 2010.|$|E
50|$|In no {{circumstances}} shall <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>be</b> {{considered to have}} given consent if <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> under <b>the</b> age of 14 or has a mental disability or illness.|$|R
5000|$|Worker on worker (Type III) - {{both the}} aggressor and <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>are</b> {{employees}} in <b>the</b> same organization. Often, the aggressor is a supervisor, and <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> a subordinate.|$|R
50|$|Ingestion: <b>The</b> <b>victim’s</b> mouth should <b>be</b> rinsed at first. <b>The</b> <b>victim</b> should <b>be</b> given {{charcoal}} as a slurry (240 ml water/30 g charcoal). This is {{only possible}} when <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> conscious.|$|R
5|$|The Moors murders {{were carried}} out by Ian Brady and Myra Hindley between July 1963 and October 1965, in and around Manchester, England. <b>The</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> five {{children}} aged between 10 and 17—Pauline Reade, John Kilbride, Keith Bennett, Lesley Ann Downey and Edward Evans—at least four of whom were sexually assaulted. Two of <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> discovered in graves dug on Saddleworth Moor; a third grave was discovered there in 1987, {{more than twenty years}} after Brady and Hindley's trial. The body of a fourth victim, Keith Bennett, is also suspected to be buried there, but despite repeated searches remains undiscovered.|$|E
5|$|James Bond {{is sent to}} {{investigate}} the murder of three British MI6 agents, {{all of whom have}} been killed within 24 hours. He discovers <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> all separately investigating the operations of Dr. Kananga, the dictator of a small Caribbean island, San Monique. He also establishes that Kananga also acts as Mr. Big, a ruthless and cunning gangster.|$|E
5|$|Later {{the same}} year, it was {{revealed}} that large quantities of infant formula had been tainted with melamine, causing 300,000 infants to fall ill and resulting in several deaths. A group of parents of <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> reportedly detained for attempting to draw media attention to their plight. Dozens of lawyers—particularly from the provinces of Hebei, Henan and Shandong—offered pro-bono legal services to victims, but their efforts were obstructed by authorities.|$|E
25|$|Sexual {{abuse in}} the first degree is a Class D felony if <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> 12 to 17 years old, and a Class C felony if <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> under 12.|$|R

5|$|Reports {{of the six}} {{missing women}} and Sparks's brutal beating {{appeared}} prominently in newspapers and on television throughout Washington and Oregon. Fear spread among the population; hitchhiking by young women dropped sharply. While pressure mounted on law enforcement agencies, the paucity of physical evidence severely hampered them. Police could not provide reporters with the little information that was available for fear of compromising the investigation. Further similarities between <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> noted: The disappearances all took place at night, usually near ongoing construction work, {{within a week of}} midterm or final exams; all of <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> wearing slacks or blue jeans; and at most crime scenes, there were sightings of a man wearing a cast or a sling, and driving a brown or tan Volkswagen Beetle.|$|E
5|$|The Voćin {{massacre}} was {{the killing}} of 43 civilians in Voćin, Croatia, by the Serbian White Eagles paramilitary unit on 13 December 1991, during the Croatian War of Independence. The massacre was carried out after the unit was ordered to abandon the village before the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska – HV) recaptured the area in Operation Papuk-91. All <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> local Croats, save one Serb, {{who had tried to}} protect his neighbours. Gunfire was the leading cause of death, though some of <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> killed with axes or chainsaws, or were burned to death. The victims exhibited signs of torture and were left unburied. On the night of 13–14 December, the White Eagles dynamited a 550-year-old church in the village.|$|E
5|$|The same day, several non-Serb {{civilians were}} killed in Dalj. In a {{subsequent}} round of negotiations with Croatian authorities, the SAO SBWS representatives reported 56 or 57 Croats were killed in Dalj on 1 August. Twenty-five bodies of the victims, including two civilians, were transferred to ZNG-held Osijek. Post-mortem examinations indicated some of <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> beaten and then executed.|$|E

5|$|A {{memorial}} {{ceremony was}} held for the victims on July 31, 1944, at Port Chicago. Admiral Carleton H. Wright, Commander, 12th Naval District, spoke of the unfortunate deaths {{and the need to}} keep the base operating during a time of war. He gave Navy and Marine Corps Medals for bravery to four officers and men who had successfully fought a fire in a rail car parked within a revetment near the pier. The remains of 44 of <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> interred at Golden Gate National Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|A {{pandemic}} is {{a worldwide}} epidemic. The 1918 flu pandemic, which lasted until 1919, was a category 5 influenza pandemic {{caused by an}} unusually severe and deadly influenza A virus. <b>The</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> often healthy young adults, in contrast to most influenza outbreaks, which predominantly affect juvenile, elderly, or otherwise-weakened patients. Older estimates say it killed 40–50million people, while more recent research suggests {{that it may have}} killed as many as 100million people, or 5% of the world's population in 1918.|$|E
5|$|According to Ming Pao, {{family members}} of <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> {{dissatisfied}} with the official investigation and held a sit-in protest, calling for a fair judgement. Some locals blamed the official rescue work by comparing it with a large emergency response exercise on a 330-meter building several days before, and the successful firefighting for a blaze at Shanghai World Financial Center in 2007. Others blamed an ineffective firefighting system for the high death toll, and were dissatisfied {{that they were not}} given more details about the fire.|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} {{investigated}} the impact of gender, victim job performance, and victim employment status on individual juror and jury perceptions of sexual harassment. Gender, victim job performance, and <b>victim</b> employment <b>are</b> all extralegal factors that were found to influence individual jurors 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of sexual harassment. The present study revealed individual female jurors {{were more likely than}} male jurors to find sexual harassment. Although gender did not have a significant effect in jury perceptions of sexual harassment, further analysis revealed females were more likely than males to change their decision on sexual harassment in a jury. Victim job performance and employment status were both found to influence jury perceptions of sexual harassment. When <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> a good, average performer, or no information <b>was</b> provided on <b>victim</b> job performance, <b>the</b> individual jurors were more likely to find sexual harassment than cases where <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> a poor performer. When <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> a good or poor performer or no information <b>was</b> provided for <b>victim</b> job performance, <b>the</b> jury was more likely to find sexual harassment than cases where <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> an average performer. Individual jurors were more likely to find sexual harassment when <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> currently employed or no information was provided than when <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> fired from <b>the</b> organization. Juries were more likely to perceive sexual harassment when no employment information was provided than when <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> currently employed fired. These results have implications for the legal system...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>victim</b> {{receives}} a small payout {{as a demonstration}} of the scheme's effectiveness. This may be a real amount of money, or faked in some way. In a gambling con, <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> allowed to win several small bets. In a stock market con, <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> given fake dividends.|$|R
5|$|According to the {{accounts}} {{of some of the}} guards, there may have been an opportunity for {{one or more of the}} guards to rescue a survivor. Yurovsky demanded that the guards come to his office and turn over items they had stolen following the assassinations. There was reportedly a span of time when the bodies of <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> left largely unattended in the truck, in the basement, and in the corridor of the house. Some guards who had not participated in the murders and had been sympathetic to the grand duchesses were left in the basement with the bodies.|$|E
5|$|According to the report, sex {{offences}} {{were committed}} by Savile on 450 people (328 being minors at the time) across England and Scotland, {{and also in}} Jersey. The {{vast majority of the}} alleged offences occurred in his home town of Leeds and his main workplace in London. <b>The</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> mainly unacquainted with each other. Savile may have committed more than 30 rapes, with a total of 126 claims of indecent acts having been recorded.|$|E
5|$|After the Croatian Serb forces, the JNA and the paramilitaries {{established}} their {{control in the}} village, the Croat population was required to wear white armbands and mark their houses using white sheets. The church in Lovas was torched and 261 houses were looted and destroyed, while 1,341 civilians were forced to leave their homes. The bodies of <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> retrieved from a mass grave and ten individual graves in 1997. Lovas was rebuilt after the war, but its population size shrunk by one third compared to its pre-war level.|$|E
5000|$|Reasonable {{belief that}} <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> over <b>the</b> age of consent: In some jurisdictions it is a defense if the accused {{can show that}} he or she {{reasonably}} believed <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> over <b>the</b> age of consent. However, where such a defense is provided, it normally applies only when <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> close to <b>the</b> age of consent or the accused can show due diligence in determining the age of <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> (e.g. an underage person who used a fake identification document claiming to be of legal age).|$|R

5|$|After the attack, {{the bulk}} of the {{civilian}} population and the remaining Croatian police and troops fled over snow-covered terrain in poor weather to Karlovac, Ogulin, and to the nearby territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Approximately 30–60 civilians, largely elderly people, remained in Saborsko. The JNA and SAO Krajina troops forced those who remained behind to leave the village, killing or abusing the civilians. At least 25 civilians were murdered by the troops {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the capture of Saborsko. Some of <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> shot, while others were beaten or burned to death.|$|E
5|$|Dartmouth {{was not as}} densely {{populated}} as Halifax and was separated from the blast by {{the width of the}} harbour, but still suffered heavy damage. Almost 100 people were estimated to have died on the Dartmouth side. Windows were shattered and many buildings were damaged or destroyed, including the Oland Brewery and parts of the Starr Manufacturing Company. Nova Scotia Hospital was the only hospital in Dartmouth and many of <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> treated there.|$|E
5|$|During press {{conferences}} on 13 and 14 December, DCS Gull revealed that police believed the locations where the five {{bodies were found}} to have been 'deposition sites', not murder scenes, indicating that <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> all killed elsewhere and transported to the locations where they were later found; no comment was made on where the women may have been murdered. DCS Gull also revealed that some items of women's clothing and accessories, including a handbag and jacket, had been recovered and were being forensically tested to establish whether they belonged to any of the murdered women.|$|E
