5|$|A third {{component}} of motion that occurs relatively infrequently involves {{the interaction of}} multiple tropical cyclones. When two cyclones approach one another, their centers will begin orbiting cyclonically about a point between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>systems.</b> Depending on their separation distance and strength, the two vortices may simply orbit around one another or else may spiral into the center point and merge. When the two vortices are of unequal size, the larger vortex will tend to dominate the interaction, and the smaller vortex will orbit around it. This phenomenon is called the Fujiwhara effect, after Sakuhei Fujiwhara.|$|E

In contrast, Upanishadic focus was the individual, the self (atman, soul), self-knowledge, and the means of an individual's moksha (freedom, liberation in this life or after-life).|$|E
5|$|In late July, a monsoon {{depression}} moved {{across much of}} India, and another monsoon disturbance persisted {{off the coast of}} Pakistan.

40|$|SUMMARY We discuss human {{collaborative}} discovery processes using {{a production}} system model as a cognitive simulator. We {{have developed an}} interactive production system architecture to construct <b>the</b> simulator. <b>Two</b> production <b>systems</b> interactively find targets in which the only experimental results are shared; each does not know the hypothesis the other system has. Through this kind of interaction, we verify whether or not <b>the</b> performance of <b>two</b> <b>systems</b> interactively finding targets exceeds that of <b>two</b> <b>systems</b> independently finding targets. If we confirm the superiority of collaborative discovery, we approve of emergence by the interaction. The results are: (1) generally speaking collaboration does not produces the emergence defined above, and (2) as the different degree of hypothesis testing strategies that <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>system</b> use gets larger, the benefits of interaction gradually increases...|$|R
5|$|On November 2, a trough of {{low-pressure}} {{was analyzed}} near the Lesser Antilles. The system moved westward into the Caribbean Sea without much organization. On November 7, the low-pressure area moved south of Cuba and became sufficiently organized {{to be considered}} a tropical depression with a pressure of at least 1010 mbar (hPa; 29.83 inHg). The depression moved over Cuba and into the Atlantic, where it dissipated the following day.

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} JTWC issued their final {{advisory}} on Lucille, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began monitoring the system near Luzon as a tropical depression.

While crossing the northern Philippines, <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>systems</b> merged and became a single cyclone, retaining the name Lucille. During its passage of the country, winds up to 63km/h (39mph) were reported in Manila. Once back over open waters, the system intensified as it accelerated northeastward, attaining tropical storm intensity early on May30.|$|E
5|$|The Maya {{writing system}} {{is one of}} the {{outstanding}} achievements of the pre-Columbian inhabitants of the Americas. It was the most sophisticated and highly developed writing system {{of more than a dozen}} systems that developed in Mesoamerica. The earliest inscriptions in an identifiably Maya script date back to 300–200 BC, in the Petén Basin. However, this is preceded by several other Mesoamerican writing systems, such as the Epi-Olmec and Zapotec scripts. Early Maya script had appeared on the Pacific coast of Guatemala by the late 1st century AD, or early 2nd century. Similarities between the Isthmian script and Early Maya script of the Pacific coast suggest that <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>systems</b> developed in tandem. By about AD 250, the Maya script had become a more formalized and consistent writing system.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} autumn 2007, long-rage {{forecast}} models {{indicated that a}} La Niña would develop by December of that year. In general, this event results in increased sea surface temperatures near Australia.

Situated over land, the system initially embedded within a disorganised trough and to intensify as it slowly tracked eastward. By 30December, it separated itself from the trough and travelled towards the west. The following day, the interaction between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>systems</b> allowed the low to significantly deepen, attaining a barometric pressure of 993mbar (hPa; 29.32inHg).

5|$|At 1800UTC on August1, an {{unidentified}} ship roughly 950mi (1,550km) southeast of Hilo, Hawaii reported 70mph (110km/h) winds within a storm, prompting the JTWC to initiate advisories on Tropical Storm Dot. Despite an apparent correlation between Dot and the preceding unnamed tropical cyclone, {{the lack of}} ship reports between July27 and August1 prevented the agency from confirming that <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>systems</b> were the same. Nonetheless, development upon designation was rapid as the system tracked westward, with reports from the SS Sonoma indicating that Dot had intensified to hurricane strength by August2. Rapid intensification continued, and at 0000UTC on August3, reconnaissance aircraft found winds of 150mph (240km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 952mbar (hPa; 28.11inHg), making Dot a Category4 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Later analysis indicated that these figures constituted the hurricane's peak intensity.|$|E
5|$|By {{the morning}} of October29, a {{tropical}} wave, tracking towards the west, began {{to interact with the}} depression and leading to forecasters discussing a possible merger of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>systems.</b> An upper-level anticyclone over the eastern Caribbean produced significant wind shear over the depression, preventing the center from moving under the deep convection. However, a large convective banding feature developed {{to the north of the}} system. Several hours later, hurricane hunters flew through the storm and recorded surface winds of 40mph (65km/h) and a barometric pressure of 999mbar (hPa; 29.5inHg), leading to the upgrade of the depression to a tropical storm. At this time, the storm received the name Katrina and peaked in intensity. By 0000UTC on October30, the center of Katrina made landfall near Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua at peak intensity. Within three hours, the storm weakened to a depression due to interaction with the mountains of Nicaragua and convection was limited to a small area on the western side of the center of circulation.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{interaction}} with the high terrain of northern Luzon, Bess temporarily weakened to a tropical storm before regaining typhoon strength over the South China Sea during the afternoon of October11. As the storm emerged back over water, satellite images revealed a relatively large system with clouds spanning an area 485km (300mi) in diameter. Upon reintensifying, Bess turned due west {{in response to a}} dominating high-pressure area over Southern China. With a large difference in pressures between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>systems,</b> a strong northeasterly flow developed between them. This resulted in gale-force winds occurring up to 400km (250mi) from Bess's center. During the evening of October12, the combined effects of a winter monsoon and entrainment of cool, dry air from mainland China began to weaken the system. By the following morning, Bess had weakened to tropical storm as it passed 305km (190mi) south of Hong Kong. The system later struck Hainan Island with winds of 85km/h (50mph) before lessening to a tropical depression. The dissipating system emerged over the Gulf of Tonkin on October14 and ultimately dissipated as it began moving ashore in northern Vietnam later that day.|$|E

The third rail required all level crossings to be removed, resulting in the line being rebuilt several places to allow the road to underpass or overpass. The light rail permitted passengers to cross the lines at the stations, but this was made impossible with metro standard. Because of this, underpasses or overpasses were built at the stations.|$|E

5|$|On October11, 2015, {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} weather traversed Central America {{and emerged}} over the eastern Pacific Ocean.

A concurrent Tehuantepec gap wind event on the western side of the gyre, complimented by anticyclonic flow behind a cold front, enhanced vorticity and spurred the formation of an elongated area of low pressure on October17. The broad system spanned several hundred miles from the Yucatán Peninsula into the eastern Pacific. A large, disorganized area of convection—showers and thunderstorms—accompanied the system, increasing in coverage substantially throughout the day. A strong pulse in the Madden–Julian oscillation—a propagating climate pattern associated with increased tropical cyclogenesis—may have aided in creating favorable conditions for further development.|$|E
