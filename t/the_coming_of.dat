5|$|Because {{the studios}} {{were forced to}} {{streamline}} operations and rely on their own resources, their individual house styles and corporate personalities came into much sharper focus.

5|$|The Parrett Navigation was {{a series}} of {{improvements}} to the river to allow increased boat traffic between Burrowbridge and Thorney.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> winter {{improved}} the water situation for some who {{had access to}} icicles, but the cold made living conditions worse.

5|$|After the Gadsden Purchase, {{southern}} Arizona's social elite, {{including the}} Estevan Ochoa, Mariano Samaniego, and Leopoldo Carillo families, remained primarily Mexican American until <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> the railroad in the 1880s. When the Sonora Exploring and Mining Company opened silver mines in southern Arizona, {{it sought to}} employ educated, middle-class Americans who shared a work ethic and leadership abilities to operate the mines. A biographical analysis of some 200 of its employees, classed as capitalists, managers, laborers, and general service personnel, reveals that the resulting work force included Europeans, Americans, Mexicans, and Indians. This mixture failed to stabilize the remote area, which lacked formal social, political, and economic organization in the years from the Gadsden Purchase to the Civil War.|$|E

A total of 889people in the northern coastal plains {{were evacuated}} and placed in shelters out of Debby path. Three shelters were opened for <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> Debby in Saint Thomas, and another two in Saint John. The total {{number of people in}} all five shelters only reached64.

5|$|At first, Prester John was {{imagined}} {{to reside}} in India; tales of the Nestorian Christians' evangelistic success there and of Thomas the Apostle's subcontinental travels as documented in works like the Acts of Thomas probably provided the first seeds of the legend.

5|$|By the 1960s, the Santa Fe {{encountered}} capacity {{problems on}} the San Francisco Chief, which ran between Chicago and San Francisco. Unlike the El Capitan, the Chief carried a mix of sleeping cars and coaches. To augment capacity, the Santa Fe ordered an additional 24 coaches in 19631964; 12 step-down and 12 standard. This was the final major order for new long-distance passenger equipment before <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> Amtrak.

5|$|For {{hundreds}} of years mining was an important industry for the area, {{and there were a}} number of mines in Midsomer Norton, e.g. Old Mills, Norton Hill, and Welton. However the seams were thin and with the hilly nature around, not easily worked. Generations of miners who worked in the difficult conditions of the local collieries are remembered at the Radstock Museum. <b>The</b> <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> the railways, particularly the Bath extension of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway (S) in 1874, transformed the conveyance of coal out of the area.|$|E
5|$|For {{the shot}} of the levitating truck, which {{was used in the}} film to {{demonstrate}} the strange phenomena brought on by <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> the alignment of the worlds, filmmakers attached a cement truck to a large hydraulic rig, which could be programmed to change speed and movement. In order to create Algrim's transformation into Kurse, Double Negative morphed live action performances of Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as both Algrim and Kurse. Double Negative then added in smoke and lava-like effects.|$|E

The collection included prints of the photographs, two of the cameras used by the girls, watercolours of fairies painted by Elsie, and a nine-page letter from Elsie admitting to the hoax.|$|E
