5|$|Vesicles {{sent off}} by the ER {{containing}} proteins are further altered at the Golgi apparatus and then prepared for secretion from the cell or transport {{to other parts of}} the cell. Various <b>things</b> <b>can</b> happen to the proteins on their journey through the enzyme covered space of the Golgi apparatus. The modification and synthesis of the carbohydrate portions of glycoproteins is common in protein processing. The Golgi apparatus removes and substitutes sugar monomers, producing a large variety of oligosaccharides. In addition to modifying proteins, the Golgi also manufactures macromolecules itself. In plant cells, the Golgi produces pectins and other polysaccharides needed by the plant structure.|$|E
5|$|A {{portion of}} all genetic {{variation}} is functionally neutral, producing no phenotypic effect or {{significant difference in}} fitness. Motoo Kimura's neutral theory of molecular evolution by genetic drift proposes that this variation accounts for a large fraction of observed genetic diversity. Neutral events can radically reduce genetic variation through population bottlenecks. which among other <b>things</b> <b>can</b> cause the founder effect in initially small new populations. When genetic variation does not result in differences in fitness, selection cannot directly affect the frequency of such variation. As a result, the genetic variation at those sites is higher than at sites where variation does influence fitness. However, after a period with no new mutations, the genetic variation at these sites is eliminated due to genetic drift. Natural selection reduces genetic variation by eliminating maladapted individuals, and consequently the mutations that caused the maladaptation. At the same time, new mutations occur, resulting in a mutation–selection balance. The exact outcome of the two processes depends both on {{the rate at which}} new mutations occur and on the strength of the natural selection, which is a function of how unfavourable the mutation proves to be.|$|E
5|$|After {{an armored}} car leaves a bank with ten million dollars, it is {{attacked}} en route by Diabolik who manages {{to steal the}} money and escape with his partner Eva Kant. Leaving the money in their underground hideout, Diabolik and Eva attend a press conference held by the Minister of the Interior which they disrupt by releasing laughing gas. Due to {{the high level of}} crime, the death penalty is brought back. The police cannot find Diabolik, and gang leader Valmont suffers at their hands from a clampdown because of his actions. Realising <b>things</b> <b>can</b> only get worse because of Diabolik's crime spree, Valmont contacts Inspector Ginko and makes a deal to catch him for the police. At his hideout, Diabolik decides to steal the famous Aksand emerald necklace from the Saint Just Castle for Eva's birthday. Valmont builds up an identikit picture of Eva and circulates it as a means of capturing Diabolik. Diabolik scales the walls of Saint Just Castle where he finds the police lying in wait. He manages to steal the necklace by fooling the police officers with mirrors on the road and dummy decoys of himself.|$|E

There are cases where three <b>things</b> <b>can</b> be rendered impure in succession by a corpse, two of those things being rendered impure with a seven-day impurity and the remaining thing with an impurity lasting until the evening.

25|$|Further, it is {{superfluous}} {{to suppose}} that what can {{be accounted for by}} a few principles has been produced by many. But it seems that everything we see in the world can be accounted for by other principles, supposing God did not exist. For all natural <b>things</b> <b>can</b> be reduced to one principle which is nature; and all voluntary <b>things</b> <b>can</b> be reduced to one principle which is human reason, or will.

25|$|Such {{rules are}} another {{standard}} device in traditional linguistics; e.g. passivization in English. Much of generative grammar {{has been devoted}} to finding ways of refining the descriptive mechanisms of phrase-structure grammar and transformation rules such that exactly the kinds of <b>things</b> <b>can</b> be expressed that natural language actually allows. Allowing arbitrary transformations doesn't meet that goal: they are much too powerful, being Turing complete unless significant restrictions are added (e.g. no transformations that introduce and then rewrite symbols in a context-free fashion).|$|E
25|$|On further reflection, the Meditator {{realizes that}} even simple <b>things</b> <b>can</b> be doubted. Omnipotent God could make even our {{conception}} of mathematics false. One {{might argue that}} God is supremely good and would not lead him to believe falsely all these things. But by this reasoning we should think that God would not deceive him with regard to anything, and yet this is clearly not true. If we suppose there is no God, then there is even greater likelihood of being deceived, since our imperfect senses {{would not have been}} created by a perfect being.|$|E

Reliability is not considered an intrinsic, unchanging property of tests because it could change when used under different conditions or {{in a different context}} than where it had been studied before.|$|E

Other injuries take place underwater, such as leg and groin injuries, as many <b>things</b> <b>can</b> not be seen from above the surface and not much padding is used to protect the players.|$|E
25|$|FlatSpin, {{along with}} GamePlan, was {{originally}} intended {{to be part of}} a pair of plays, both set in the London Docklands, and both using the same cast of seven. Ayckbourn has a flat in the Docklands, where he observed the neighbours do not know each other well and strange <b>things</b> <b>can</b> happen under their noses. The pair of plays was eventually joined by a third, RolePlay, written as an afterthought, and the trilogy, Damsels in Distress, was shown in the Stephen Joseph Theatre's 2001 season. Like the other two plays, this drew some inspiration from the London Docklands.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{majority}} of the inhabitants being of peasantry stock, the Sasanian economy relied on farming and agriculture, Khuzestan and Iraq being the most important provinces for it.

The mountains of the Sasanian state was used on lumbering by the nomads of the region, and due to the great centralization of the Sasanians, they also managed to impose tax on the nomads and inhabitants of the mountains. During the reign of Khosrau I, further land was brought under centralization.|$|E

25|$|Opponents {{say that}} nuclear power poses many threats {{to people and}} the environment. These threats include health risks and {{environmental}} damage from uranium mining, processing and transport, the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation or sabotage, and the unsolved problem of radioactive nuclear waste. They also contend that reactors themselves are enormously complex machines where many <b>things</b> <b>can</b> and do go wrong, {{and there have been}} many serious nuclear accidents. Critics do not believe that these risks can be reduced through new technology. They argue that when all the energy-intensive stages of the nuclear fuel chain are considered, from uranium mining to nuclear decommissioning, nuclear power is not a low-carbon electricity source.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, <b>things</b> <b>can</b> be {{causes of}} one another, causing each other reciprocally, as hard work causes fitness and vice versa, {{although}} {{not in the}} same way or function, the one is as the beginning of change, the other as the goal. (Thus Aristotle first suggested a reciprocal or circular causality as a relation of mutual dependence or influence of cause upon effect.) Moreover, Aristotle indicated that the same thing can be the cause of contrary effects; its presence and absence may result in different outcomes. Simply it is the goal or purpose that brings about an event. Our two dominoes require someone or something to intentionally knock over the first domino, because it cannot fall of its own accord.|$|E
25|$|The Orthodox Church {{regards the}} bodies of all saints as holy, made such by {{participation}} in the Holy Mysteries, especially the communion of Christ's holy body and blood, and by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit within the Church. Indeed, that persons and physical <b>things</b> <b>can</b> be made holy is a cornerstone {{of the doctrine of}} the Incarnation, made manifest also directly by God in Old Testament times through his dwelling in the Ark of the Covenant. Thus, physical items connected with saints are also regarded as holy, through their participation in the earthly works of those saints. God himself bears witness to this holiness of saints' relics through the many miracles connected with them that have been reported throughout history since Biblical times, often including healing from disease and injury.|$|E
