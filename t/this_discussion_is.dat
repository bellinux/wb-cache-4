500|$|Rhetoric is {{discussed}} in chapter 4.17 of Manasollasa. The text dedicates over 450 verses in chapter 4.18 to dance and describes types of dance forms, musical instruments that go with dance performances, and the occasions when dances were celebrated. The text discusses six types of performers, their characteristics and their roles — Nata (actor), Nartaka (dancer), Nartaki (danseuse), Vaitalika (bard), Charana (wandering performer) and Kollatika (acrobat). Their body movements (6 Anga, [...] 8 Upanga and 6 Pratyanga) are explained with their significance. <b>This</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>is</b> similar to that found in Natya Shastra, a Sanskrit text composed around 1st-century BCE. The text thereafter presents the 21 Sthanas and 26 Charis of the dance tradition.|$|E
500|$|Most recent {{research}} on Tyrannosaurus locomotion {{does not support}} speeds faster than , i.e. moderate-speed running. For example, a 2002 paper in Nature used a mathematical model (validated by applying it to three living animals, alligators, chickens, and humans; later eight more species including emus and ostriches) to gauge the leg muscle mass needed for fast running (over [...] ). They found that proposed top speeds in excess of [...] were infeasible, because they would require very large leg muscles (more than approximately 40–86%of total body mass). Even moderately fast speeds would have required large leg muscles. <b>This</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>is</b> difficult to resolve, as it is unknown how large the leg muscles actually were in Tyrannosaurus.

2500|$|In politics, {{happiness}} as {{a guiding}} ideal {{is expressed in}} the United States Declaration of Independence of 1776, written by Thomas Jefferson, as the universal right to [...] "the pursuit of happiness."

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, some authors have {{no use for}} this {{distinction}} of morphisms (especially since the emerging concepts of [...] "complete semilattice morphisms" [...] can as well be specified in general terms).

2500|$|The 1956 {{document}} couches {{the violence}} and occupation of the island of Ireland in {{a long history of}} armed resistance to occupation. [...] The first Chapter is entirely taken up with providing this history from the viewpoint of the organisation. [...] It provides information on the Kerne, the battle of the Yellow Ford, Owen Roe O'Neill, the 1798 Rebellion and United Irishmen, James Fintan Lalor, and the [...] "Tan War". All are described as being within the context of legitimate resistance to the occupation of Ireland. [...] <b>This</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>is</b> largely romanticised and aimed at demonstrating a lineage of [...] "armed struggle" [...] from which the IRA assumes its legitimacy in the fight against [...] "occupying forces in Ireland". [...] One entry in <b>this</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>is</b> the fact that the efforts of IRA guerrillas were the direct cause in ending the British occupation of the 26 counties of Ireland—the territory that would become the Irish Free State, and later the Republic of Ireland. [...] The 1956 manual also implies that the bulk of the IRA's work in [...] "freeing Ireland from occupation" [...] is over. This indicates both a [...] "southern" [...] perspective on Irish independence and an underestimation of the resistance they would encounter during the Border Campaign, that was aimed at the end of British rule in Northern Ireland. With the publication of the 1977 edition this assumption of an easy victory in ending partition had been dropped and the [...] "Long War" [...] strategy adopted.|$|E

60|$|Then {{another and}} very grave point (for <b>this</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>is</b> deep, deep--not for trifles, or pretty seemings.) I {{am not sure}} but the establish'd and old (and superb and profound, and, one may say, needed as old) {{conception}} of Deity as mainly of moral constituency (goodness, purity, sinlessness, &c.) has been undermined by nineteenth-century ideas and science. What does this immense and almost abnormal development of Philanthropy mean among the moderns? One doubts if there ever will come {{a day when the}} moral laws and moral standards will be supplanted as over all: while time proceeds (I find it so myself) they will probably be intrench'd deeper and expanded wider. Then the expanded scientific and democratic and truly philosophic and poetic quality of modernism demands a Deific identity and scope superior to all limitations, and essentially including just as well the so-call'd evil and crime and criminals--all the malformations, the defective and abortions of the universe.|$|E
60|$|I {{know quite}} well that {{launching}} myself into <b>this</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>is</b> {{a very dangerous}} operation; {{that it is a}} very large subject, and one which is difficult to deal with, however much I may trespass upon your patience in the time allotted to me. But the discussion is so fundamental, it is so completely impossible to make up one's mind on these matters until one has settled the question, that I will even venture to make the experiment. A great lawyer-statesman and philosopher of a former age--I mean Francis Bacon--said that truth came out of error much more rapidly than it came out of confusion. There is a wonderful truth in that saying. Next to being right in this world, the best of all things is to be clearly and definitely wrong, because you will come out somewhere. If you go buzzing about between right and wrong, vibrating and fluctuating, you come out nowhere; but if you are absolutely and thoroughly and persistently wrong, you must, some of these days, have the extreme good fortune of knocking your head against a fact, and that sets you all straight again. So I will not trouble myself as to whether I may be right or wrong in what I am about to say, but at any rate I hope to be clear and definite; and then {{you will be able to}} judge for yourselves whether, in following out the train of thought I have to introduce, you knock your heads against facts or not.|$|E
6000|$|... "Science" [...] is {{supposed}} to lend its sanction to race mania, {{but it is only}} [...] "science" [...] as it is understood by very illiterate people that does anything of the sort--"scientists'" [...] science, in fact. What science has to tell about [...] "The Races of Man" [...] will be found compactly set forth by Doctor J. Deinker, in the book published under that title. [Footnote: See also an excellent paper in the American Journal of Sociology for March, 1904, The Psychology of Race Prejudice, by W. I. Thomas.] From that book one may learn the beginnings of race charity. Save for a few isolated pools of savage humanity, there is probably no pure race in the whole world. The great continental populations are all complex mixtures of numerous and fluctuating types. Even the Jews present every kind of skull that {{is supposed}} to be racially distinctive, a vast range of complexion--from blackness in Goa, to extreme fairness in Holland--and a vast mental and physical diversity. Were the Jews to discontinue all intermarriage with [...] "other races" [...] henceforth for ever, it would depend upon quite unknown laws of fecundity, prepotency, and variability, what their final type would be, or, indeed, whether any particular type would ever prevail over diversity. And, without going beyond the natives of the British Isles, one can discover an enormous range of types, tall and short, straight-haired and curly, fair and dark, supremely intelligent and unteachably stupid, straightforward, disingenuous, and what not. The natural tendency is to forget all this range directly [...] "race" [...] comes under discussion, to take either an average or some quite arbitrary ideal as the type, and think only of that. The more difficult thing to do, but the thing that must be done if we are to get just results in <b>this</b> <b>discussion,</b> <b>is</b> to do one's best to bear the range in mind.|$|E
