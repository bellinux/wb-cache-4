25|$|We can {{extrapolate}} {{from the}} above table that the step size needed to get an answer <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>correct</b> to three decimal places is approximately 0.00001, meaning that we need 400,000 steps. This large number of steps entails a high computational cost. For this reason, people usually employ alternative, higher-order methods such as Runge–Kutta methods or linear multistep methods, especially if a high accuracy is desired.|$|E
25|$|The fully {{polynomial}} time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for the knapsack problem {{takes advantage of}} the fact that the reason the problem has no known {{polynomial time}} solutions is because the profits associated with the items are not restricted. If one rounds off some of the least significant digits of the profit values then they will be bounded by a polynomial and 1/ε where ε is a bound on the correctness of the solution. This restriction then means that an algorithm can find a solution in polynomial time <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>correct</b> within a factor of (1-ε) of the optimal solution.|$|E
25|$|Robert E. Lee's biographer, Douglas p. Freeman, {{asserts that}} the army {{received}} its final name from Lee when he issued orders assuming command on June 1, 1862. However, Freeman does admit that Lee corresponded with Joseph E. Johnston, his predecessor in army command, prior to that date and referred to Johnston's command as the Army of Northern Virginia. Part of the confusion results {{from the fact that}} Johnston commanded the Department of Northern Virginia (as of October 22, 1861) and the name Army of Northern Virginia can be seen as an informal consequence of its parent department's name. Jefferson Davis and Johnston did not adopt the name, {{but it is clear that}} the organization of units as of March 14 was the same organization that Lee received on June 1, and thus it is generally referred to today as the Army of Northern Virginia, even if <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>correct</b> only in retrospect.|$|E

500|$|Some {{scholars}} identify Halfdan Ragnarsson {{as another}} brother.

If <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>correct,</b> then it may explain {{the reason for the}} conflict: it was a dynastic squabble for control of the kingdom. One potential problem is that according to Norse tradition Ivar and Halfdan were the sons of Ragnar Lodbrok, whereas Ímar and Amlaíb are named as sons of Gofraid in the Fragmentary Annals. However, the historicity of Ragnar is uncertain and the identification of Ragnar as the father of Ivar and Halfdan is not to be relied upon.|$|E

2500|$|In logic, {{the term}} decidable {{refers to the}} {{decision}} problem, {{the question of the}} existence of an effective method for determining membership in a set of formulas, or, more precisely, an algorithm that can and will return a boolean true or false value <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>correct</b> (instead of looping indefinitely, crashing, returning [...] "don't know" [...] or returning a wrong answer). Logical systems such as propositional logic are decidable if membership in their set of logically valid formulas (or theorems) can be effectively determined. A theory (set of sentences closed under logical consequence) in a fixed logical system is decidable if there is an effective method for determining whether arbitrary formulas are included in the theory. Many important problems are undecidable, that is, it has been proven that no effective method for determining membership (returning a correct answer after finite, though possibly very long, time in all cases) can exist for them.|$|E
2500|$|Richard T. Arndt, {{a former}} State Department {{cultural}} diplomacy practitioner, said [...] "Cultural relations grow naturally and organically, without government intervention – the transactions {{of trade and}} tourism, student flows, communications, book circulation, migration, media access, inter-marriage – millions of daily cross-cultural encounters. If <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>correct,</b> cultural diplomacy can only be said to take place when formal diplomats, serving national governments, try to shape and channel this natural flow to advance national interests." [...] It {{is important to note}} that, while cultural diplomacy is, as indicated above, a government activity, the private sector has a very real role to play because the government does not create culture, therefore, it can only attempt to make a culture known and define the impact this organic growth will have on national policies. Cultural diplomacy attempts to manage the international environment by utilizing these sources and achievements and making them known abroad. [...] An important aspect of this is listening- cultural diplomacy is meant to be a two-way exchange. [...] This exchange is then intended to foster a mutual understanding and thereby win influence within the target nation. [...] Cultural diplomacy derives its credibility not from being close to government institutions, but from its proximity to cultural authorities. It is seen as a silent weapon in gaining control over another nation with the use of non-violent methods to perpetrate a relationship of mutual understanding and support among the countries involved.|$|E

[...] But notwithstanding the accommodation in which the writer of the Acts would have us believe, the Jerusalem Church held to its endeavour to retain the observance of the Law.
