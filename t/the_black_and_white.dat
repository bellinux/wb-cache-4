5|$|In {{the period}} in which The Wrestlers was painted, sports were {{becoming}} increasingly popular, and the painting is both a reflection of this trend and a part of the English tradition of copying poses from classical Hellenistic works. It was also a time of change in the British attitude to race relations. Etty in this period was generally making a conscious effort to illustrate moral lessons in his work, and {{it is not clear whether}} he chose the topic as a form of social commentary or simply because the contrast between <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> flesh tones was visually striking.|$|E
5|$|Referred to during {{development}} as the ZX81 Colour and ZX82, it was launched as the ZX Spectrum by Sinclair {{to highlight the}} machine's colour display, compared with <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> of its predecessor, the ZX81. The Spectrum was released as eight different models, ranging from the entry level with 16KB RAM released in 1982 to the ZX Spectrum +3 with 128KB RAM and built in floppy disk drive in 1987; together they sold over 5 million units worldwide (not counting clones).|$|E
5|$|The 1950s decade {{ended with}} Murphy doing three westerns. He co-starred with 14-year-old Sandra Dee in the 1959 film The Wild and the Innocent. The film's cast was rounded out with {{respected}} talent {{of the era}} in Gilbert Roland, Joanne Dru and Jim Backus. His collaboration with Walter Mirisch on <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> Cast a Long Shadow included an uncredited stint as co-producer. The film co-starred Terry Moore. His performance in No Name on the Bullet was well received. The storyline follows the cool, jaded hired gun as the townspeople are gripped with fear by his presence.|$|E
50|$|Adelaide City {{was founded}} as Juventus in 1946. To this day, it retains the Juventus, or 'Juve' nickname.

5|$|The colours {{used by the}} {{original}} Panthers were black and white. Home shirts were black with {{a black and white}} striped lining on the shoulders. When the club reformed in 1980, <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> colours were also revived, with a gold lining also being added to the jerseys. In 1996 red was added to the colour scheme of the shirts. In 2001–02 the club's colour scheme was changed to black and gold.

Wattle and daub or lath and plaster are used to fill the spaces between the timbers. <b>The</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> appearance from the timber framing construction dates from the Tudor period, though some parts have been repaired in later years.|$|E
5|$|Juventus {{have played}} {{in black and white}} striped shirts, with white shorts, {{sometimes}} black shorts since 1903. Originally, they played in pink shirts with a black tie. The father of one of the players made the earliest shirts, but continual washing faded the colour so much that in 1903 the club sought to replace them. Juventus asked one of their team members, Englishman John Savage, if he had any contacts in England who could supply new shirts in a colour that would better withstand the elements. He had a friend who lived in Nottingham, who being a Notts County supporter, shipped out <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> striped shirts to Turin. Juventus have worn the shirts ever since, considering the colours to be aggressive and powerful.|$|E
5|$|Murphy {{continued}} to make films in the 1960s. Murphy and Huston worked together one {{more time in the}} 1960 film The Unforgiven, in which Murphy took second billing as Burt Lancaster's racist kid brother who was bent on the destruction of the Kiowa.Writer Clair Huffaker had success in a number of his works being adapted for the films, including his 1958 novel Flaming Lance being filmed as the Elvis Presley western Flaming Star. Two of his works retained their original titles when Huffaker wrote the screenplays for them as Murphy's films in 1961, Seven Ways from Sundown and Posse from Hell. Author Bob Herzberg deemed the scripts two of the best Murphy worked with in that decade. Herbert Coleman directed Posse from Hell as well as <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> World War II drama Battle at Bloody Beach set in the Philippines.|$|E

5|$|On August 3, 2010, Masuda {{announced}} on his blog that <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> <b>and</b> <b>White</b> game versions will initially only contain brand-new Pokémon to evoke {{a feeling of}} it being a brand-new game, like when the original Pokémon games were first released. In all of the games following the first generation, there were a series of new Pokémon introduced interspersed with Pokémon from the previous generations. For example, Pikachu was introduced in Red and Green, and was obtainable in Blue, Yellow, and all subsequent main series games; however, Pikachu will not be obtainable in Black and White {{from the start of}} the game. It was later confirmed that Black and White are region locked on the Nintendo DSi and 3DS.|$|E
5|$|Since 2006, all {{prisoners and}} parolees in Queensland have been {{prohibited}} by law (section 132 of Queensland's Corrective Services Act, {{introduced by the}} Beattie Labor Government) from speaking to reporters without permission. Thus, {{for the duration of}} his imprisonment and parole, Wotton could not lawfully speak to the media or attend public meetings without prior approval from his parole officer. Gracelyn Smallwood of the Indigenous Human Rights Committee believed it was designed to muzzle the truth. Terry O'Gorman, President of the Australian Council for Civil Liberties, has called it 'obnoxious'. Stewart Levitt, the director of <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> <b>and</b> <b>White</b> Justice Foundation remarked that it was unusual for a public spokesman and former politician to be prohibited from a public meeting. Welcoming Wotton back home, Alf Lacey, mayor of Palm Island, commented that the conditions were excessive.|$|E

Atlético's traditional away kit is all-white shirts, shorts and socks, but has had slight variations. An all-black third kit {{was introduced in the}} 2000 season, being used again in 2015. In 2008, a black-and-gold vertically striped third kit was launched to commemorate the club's centenary, featuring the first crest.

5|$|The road jersey from 1995 to 2003, {{which became}} the team's home jersey in 2003 when the NHL decided to switch home and road jerseys, is {{predominantly}} burgundy and dark blue in color. Along the jersey, there are two black and white zigzag lines, one in the shoulders, the other near the belly. Between them, the jersey is burgundy, outside those lines it is dark blue. Similar lines exist around the neck. The Avalanche logo is {{in the center of}} the jersey. On top of the shoulders, there is the alternate logo, one on each side. The away jersey is similar but with different colors. The burgundy part on the home jersey is white on the away jersey, the light blue part is burgundy and <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> lines became gray and blue.|$|E
5|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature of}} the Wootton Hall is its pair of Italian black and Beschia marble blackamoor torchères, originally given to the First Duke of Marlborough as a present from General Charles Churchill. In exceptionally good condition, they stand {{either side of the}} door into the Saloon. These were discovered in the silt of the River Tiber and are depictions of slaves who once served in a Roman household. Several flags stand above them, including the White Ensign. The ceiling is intricately made, featuring flowers in the plaster, each one different, the work of Colen Campbell in the early 18th century. <b>The</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> check marble floor is also a distinguishing {{feature of the}} room, but through most of its history this floor would have been left plain as horses and carriages would enter the hall inside. In the mid 19th century Frederick, the 4th Earl, had laid down brown and blue tiles, replaced by the marble floor which was added by his son Robert in around 1910. The floor gives significant depth to the hall and provides fine acoustics, so much that Diana would once practice her tap dancing in the hall as a teenager.|$|E
5|$|The 1990s saw the {{creation}} of a number of independent publishing houses with output that competed with the giants of mainstream comics publishing, Marvel and DC. The companies included Malibu Comics, Image Comics (such as Hisao and Guilliame from Morning Glories) and later, Dark Horse Comics. These companies gave greater artistic freedom to their writers and artists and chose not to ascribe to the Comics Code, allowing exploration of more mature themes. As a result, comics from these companies included a greater relative number of LGBT characters and storylines than their more traditional competitors. LGBT superhero characters include Spectral and Turbo Charge (from Malibu comics), and Gen13's Sarah Rainmaker (created by Wildstorm for Image Comics before being taken over by DC). Colleen Doran's A Distant Soil, dating back to <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> independent movement of the 1980s, and published by Image since 1996, featured openly gay characters as the romantic leads that gained the series a Gaylactic Spectrum Award nomination.|$|E
