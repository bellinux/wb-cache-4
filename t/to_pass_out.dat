5|$|Walter (John Noble) {{remembers that}} one of his former {{patients}} Rebecca Kibner (Theresa Russell), while under a heavy dose of mind-altering drugs, had witnessed events in the parallel universe including the presence of the shapeshifters. To try to learn more, they approach Rebecca and ask for her help, who is happy to participate. After outfitting her with electrodes and injecting her with more drugs, Walter starts the process by clanging a bell; to everyone's surprise, this causes Olivia <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
5|$|The train derails en route, {{forcing the}} duo to proceed on foot. As they fight through the disorganized Combine forces and rampant alien infestations, Kleiner {{appears on the}} screens Breen once used <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>out</b> propaganda, and gives out useful updates to the {{evacuating}} citizens about the latest turn of events as well as reiterating the Citadel's imminent collapse. Alyx and Gordon eventually meet up with Barney Calhoun {{and a group of}} other survivors who are preparing to move on a train station to escape City 17. Alyx and Gordon provide cover for the passengers as they board.|$|E
5|$|As {{the number}} of known {{specimens}} increased, scientists began to analyze the variation between individuals and discovered {{what appeared to be}} two distinct body types, or morphs, similar to some other theropod species. As one of these morphs was more solidly built, it was termed the 'robust' morph while the other was termed ''. Several morphological differences associated with the two morphs were used to analyze sexual dimorphism in Tyrannosaurus rex, with the 'robust' morph usually suggested to be female. For example, the pelvis of several 'robust' specimens seemed to be wider, perhaps to allow the passage of eggs. It was also thought that the 'robust' morphology correlated with a reduced chevron on the first tail vertebra, also ostensibly to allow eggs <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>out</b> of the reproductive tract, as had been erroneously reported for crocodiles.|$|E

25|$|Several {{members of}} the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP) flew to Rome to protest saying Cardinal Law's place of honour was painful to sexual abuse victims and {{embarrassing}} to Catholics. Just as the group's members arrived at St. Peter's Basilica, led by founder Barbara Blaine, police officers escorted them outside the confines of St. Peter's Square.

25|$|By 915, Berengar's eldest daughter, Bertha, was abbess of San Salvatore in Brescia, {{where her}} aunt {{had once been}} a nun. In that year, the {{following}} year, and in 917, Berengar endowed her monastery with three privileges to build or man fortifications. His younger daughter, Gisela, had married Adalbert I of Ivrea as early as 898 (and no later than 910), but this failed to spark an alliance with the Anscarids. She was dead by 913, when Adalbert remarried. Adalbert was one of Berengar's earliest internal enemies after the defeat of Louis of Provence. He called on Hugh of Arles between 917 and 920 to take the Iron Crown. Hugh did invade Italy, with his brother Boso, and advanced as far as Pavia, where Berengar starved them into submission, but allowed them <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>out</b> of Italy freely.|$|E
25|$|On March 27, 1985, {{just days}} prior to the inaugural WrestleMania, Richard Belzer {{requested}} on his cable TV talk show Hot Properties that Hogan demonstrate one of his signature wrestling moves. After consistently refusing but being egged on by Belzer, Hogan put Belzer in a modified Guillotine choke, which caused Belzer <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>out.</b> When Hogan released him, Belzer hit {{his head on the}} floor, sustaining a laceration to the scalp that required a brief hospitalization. Belzer sued Hogan for $5 million and later settled out of court. On October 20, 2006, on the Bubba the Love Sponge Show, it was claimed (with Hogan in the studio) that the settlement totaled $5 million, half from Hogan and half from Vince McMahon. During his June 23, 2008, appearance on Sirius Satellite Radio's The Howard Stern Show, Belzer suggested that the real settlement amount was actually closer to $400,000.|$|E
25|$|Strassburg {{managed to}} {{disengage}} and escape when the battlecruisers approached but Cöln {{was not so}} fortunate. Cut off from escape she was quickly disabled by the much larger guns of the battlecruisers. She was saved from immediate sinking by the sighting of another German light cruiser, Ariadne, to which Beatty gave chase and again quickly overcame. Ariadne was left to sink, which she eventually did at 15:00, attended by the German ships Danzig and Stralsund who took off survivors. At 13:10, Beatty turned north-west and ordered all the British ships to withdraw, since the tide had now risen sufficiently for larger German ships <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>out</b> through the Jade estuary. Passing Cöln again, he opened fire, sinking her. Attempts to rescue the crew were interrupted {{by the arrival of}} a submarine; one survivor was rescued by a German ship two days later out of some 250 who had survived the sinking. Rear Admiral Maass perished with his ship.|$|E

25|$|Jean-Claude Van Damme was {{originally}} {{cast as the}} Predator creature, the idea being that the physical action star would use his martial arts skills to make the Predator an agile, ninja-esque hunter. When compared to Schwarzenegger, Weathers, and Ventura, actors known for their bodybuilding regimens, it became apparent a more physically imposing man was {{needed to make the}} creature appear threatening. Additionally, it was reported that Van Damme constantly complained about the monster suit being too hot, causing him <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>out.</b> He also had allegedly voiced his reservations on numerous occasions regarding the fact he would not be appearing on camera without the suit. Additionally, the original design for the Predator was felt to be too cumbersome and difficult to manage in the jungle and, even with a more imposing actor, was felt to not provoke enough fear. Van Damme was removed from the film and replaced by Kevin Peter Hall.|$|E
25|$|For the {{farewell}} season, {{the best}} friends hit the road again for an overnight camping trip at Yosemite National Park. Park ranger Shelton Johnson wrote to Winfrey because he was concerned by the low number of African-Americans who visited the national parks each year. So Winfrey and King packed up their camper and headed to Yosemite to help Johnson attract visitors. When they arrived, Johnson took Winfrey and King around the park {{to see some of}} its famous sites including Mariposa Grove and the Tunnel View, where El Capitan is visible in the distance. On the way to the campsite, Winfrey made a sharp turn causing their trailer to hit a rock. After setting up their pop-up camper, the two mixed up some Moscow Mules <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>out</b> to their camping neighbors. The drink has become a signature Oprah cocktail. The next day they took a lesson in fly fishing and wrapped up their stay with a mule ride.|$|E

She asks Amy to continue living with them to help with Nell while Toadie recovers. Angie briefly visits to help out, but soon leaves after clashing with Sonya. The neighbours organise a benefit for Toadie, which raises over $6000. Sonya is bitten by a Redback spider at the nursery, causing her <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>out.</b> After receiving treatment, Sonya recovers at home. She and Toadie consider using the benefit fund to pay their bills, but discover the money has been taken. Amy's ex-husband Liam Barnett (James Beck) later reveals he stole the money. Steph returns to Erinsborough and Sonya is uncomfortable having her around. However, after she learns Paul was gaslighting Steph, Sonya invites her {{to move in with}} her and Toadie. Steph's ex-girlfriend Belinda Bell (Nikki Shiels) believes Steph has feelings for Toadie, and she threatens Toadie. When Sonya learns that Belinda is the theatre nurse during Toadie's spinal surgery, she interrupts the operation, causing a complication that leaves Toadie infertile.

25|$|Iowa {{started the}} second half with the ball but they would punt the ball to Wisconsin after three plays. Wisconsin {{would do the same}} as they punted the ball back to Iowa. The Hawkeyes drive the ball to the Badgers 35-yard line. On fourth-and-one, Iowa decided to go for it and failed as the Badgers defense stuffed the run up the middle. Still the Badgers {{struggled}} to move the ball on the Iowa defense and punted it back to the Hawkeyes. The Wisconsin punt was downed at the Iowa 1-yard line. On the first play, Iowa tried <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>out</b> of their own end zone. The pass was intercepted by CB Darius Hillary at the Iowa 20-yard line. During that play Iowa starting QB Jake Rudock was injured and would not return to the game. On the very next play, Joel Stave connected with WR Jared Abbrederis on a 20-yard touchdown pass. Jared Abbrederis was injured on the touchdown catch and he would not return to the game. Iowa's backup QB C.J. Beathard would come in but failed to pick up a first down so they punted. Wisconsin tried to move the ball but two holding penalties forced them to punt. Wisconsin punting into the wind again forced a 23-yard punt and Iowa took over at their own 40-yard line. Iowa would again get into the red zone at the Wisconsin 12-yard line but once again they were forced to settle for a 29-yard field goal. Wisconsin would have the ball as the third quarter came to a close with the Badgers holding onto a slight 14–9 lead. The Badgers got to midfield put punted the ball back to the Hawkeyes. The Badgers would get pressure on the Iowa backup QB and forced a bad throw that hit off an Iowa helmet, popped {{up in the air and}} was intercepted by DE Pat Muldoon at the Iowa 25-yard line. Three plays later, RB James White scored on an 11-yard touchdown run. The Badgers defense would again force another Hawkeye punt. Wisconsin took over at their own 24-yard line and on the second play of the drive, James White broke loose for a 59-yard run down to the Iowa 17. The Iowa defense tried to hold Wisconsin but finally James White punched it in with a 2-yard touchdown run giving the Badgers a 28–9 lead. With about and three and a half minutes left in the game, Iowa would again drive into the Wisconsin red zone but failed on fourth down and the Badgers closed out the game with a kneel down.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} Borg costume Ryan wore {{during the}} second part of [...] "Scorpion" [...] took approximately {{two and a half hours}} to apply.
