500|$|Howard Blake recalls: [...] "I {{went to a}} {{viewing and}} saw that the film was very profound, with a serious anti-war theme, but a certain amount of 'found' choral music had already been laid in by the editors...I {{explained}} that I loved the film and I thought the choral/orchestral music worked brilliantly but it was very big and rich and I felt a score would have to emerge from it and be very pure and expressive and quite small — and that I could only hear <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> head as done by strings only." ...|$|E
500|$|Atlanta's climate {{was cited}} as a {{potential}} issue that would hinder production. Darabont recalled that he {{found it difficult to}} adjust to the sweltering heat, adding that he [...] "never had clothes stick to me like <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life". Lincoln retorted that it was [...] "becoming a running joke that people arrive on set ready for the day and then they are battered and beaten up by the weather." [...] Despite such assertions, he opined that it added to the episode's overall emotion. [...] "There's a lot of hard-earned sweat on camera. It's not comfortable and it's not pleasant, but it's as you would imagine it would be trying to survive in this world." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{preparation}} for the 2010 Winter Olympics, Ohno lost over 9kilograms (20 pounds) of weight from when he appeared at the 2002 Winter Games. [...] He went down to a 65.7kg (145lb) bodyframe and a 2.5% Body fat percentage enduring a 5-month 3-a-day training program combined with a strict nutritional program. [...] As a result, he could lift double the weight he could before the training. [...] With respect to his training regimen, Ohno said: [...] "Come these Games, there's no one who's going to be fitter than me. There's just no way. Whether I can put it together on the ice or not and feel good, that's a different story. But I know, from a physical training standpoint, nobody's even close... I've never prepared like <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life — for anything. [...] I want to leave nothing on the table." ...|$|E

2500|$|On November 8, 2012, the Supreme Court of Canada {{ruled that}} Pfizer's patent 2,163,446 on Viagra was invalid from the {{beginning}} because the company did not provide full disclosure in its application. The decision, Teva Canada Ltd. v. Pfizer Canada Inc., pointed to section 27(3)(b) of The Patent Act which requires that disclosure must include sufficient information [...] "to enable any person {{skilled in the art}} or science to which it pertains" [...] to produce it. It added further: [...] "As a matter of policy and sound statutory interpretation, patentees cannot be allowed to 'game' the system in this way. <b>This,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> view, is the key issue in this appeal." ...|$|E
2500|$|There is {{an ancient}} record of one person who survived a crucifixion that was {{intended}} to be lethal, but that was interrupted. Josephus recounts: [...] "I saw many captives crucified, and remembered three of them as my former acquaintance. I was very sorry at <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind, and went with tears in my eyes to Titus, and told him of them; so he immediately commanded them to be taken down, and to have the greatest care taken of them, in order to their recovery; yet two of them died under the physician's hands, while the third recovered." [...] Josephus gives no details of the method or duration of the crucifixion of his three friends before their reprieve.|$|E
2500|$|Aside from {{a part in}} the {{suspense}} drama Sherlock Holmes and the Strange Case of Miss Faulkner and her desire to play more-challenging roles, Entwistle was often cast as a comedian, most often the attractive, good-hearted ingénue. In 1929 she told a reporter:"I would rather play roles that carry conviction. Maybe it is because they are the easiest and yet the hardest things for me to do. To play any kind of an emotional scene I must work up to a certain pitch. If I reach <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> first word, the rest of the words and lines take care of themselves. But if I fail, I have to build up the balance of the speeches, and in doing this the whole characterisation falls flat. I feel that I am cheating myself. I don't know whether other actresses get this same reaction or not, but it does worry me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hannity {{was criticized}} by some conservatives, {{especially}} supporters of Ted Cruz's 2016 presidential campaign, as being overly {{favorable to the}} candidacy of Donald Trump and granting Trump more airtime than other presidential candidates during the 2016 primaries. Hannity, for instance, let Donald Trump promote the false conspiracy theory that Ted Cruz's father {{was involved in the}} John F Kennedy assassination. During interviews, Hannity [...] "frequently cites areas where he agrees with Trump, or where he thinks Trump was right about something, then asks him to expand on it", and [...] "often ignores or defends Trump from criticism," [...] according to a CNN report. Tensions between Cruz and Hannity appeared to reach a boiling point during a contentious April 2016 radio interview, during which Cruz implied Hannity was a [...] "hard-core Donald Trump supporter" [...] and Hannity responded by accusing Cruz of [...] "throw <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> face" [...] every time he asked a [...] "legitimate question". Jim Rutenberg reported in August 2016 that Hannity is [...] "not only Mr. Trump’s biggest media booster; he also veers into the role of adviser," [...] citing sources who said Hannity spent months offering suggestions to Trump and his campaign on strategy and messaging. Hannity responded to the report by saying, [...] "I’m not hiding the fact that I want Donald Trump to be {{the next president of the}} United States. ... I never claimed to be a journalist." [...] Hannity has feuded with several conservatives who oppose Trump, including National Reviews Jonah Goldberg, Wall Street Journal foreign affairs columnist Bret Stephens, and National Review editor Rich Lowry.|$|E
