5|$|Media {{reports said}} the attack struck {{at the heart}} of American covert {{operations}} in the region, with some characterizing it as the CIA's Pearl Harbor.

5|$|The Act was {{subsequently}} amended to promote private development {{of nuclear energy}} under the Eisenhower administration's Atoms for Peace program in 1954. In restricting the access to nuclear information to other countries, it created a rift between <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> allies, particularly Britain and Canada, which {{had participated in the}} Manhattan Project. This resulted in cumbersome command and control arrangements, and in Britain developing its own nuclear weapons. The Act was amended in 1958 to allow the United States to share information with its close allies.|$|E

He wrote several biographies; his works on Johan Sverdrup and Henrik Ibsen spanned several volumes each. He became known for syntheses on Norwegian history, and emphasised the roles of peasants and wage labourers as historical agents who found their place in an expanding notion of the Norwegian nation. He was also interested in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> history, and was a pioneer in Norway in this respect.|$|E

5|$|The temple is a {{powerful}} symbol of Cambodia, and {{is a source of}} great national pride that has factored into Cambodia's diplomatic relations with France, <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> neighbour Thailand. A depiction of Angkor Wat {{has been a part of}} Cambodian national flags since the introduction of the first version circa 1863. From a larger historical and even transcultural perspective, however, the temple of Angkor Wat did not become a symbol of national pride sui generis but had been inscribed into a larger politico-cultural process of French-colonial heritage production in which the original temple site was presented in French colonial and universal exhibitions in Paris and Marseille between 1889 and 1937. Angkor Wat's aesthetics were also on display in the plaster cast museum of Louis Delaporte called musée Indo-chinois which existed in the Parisian Trocadero Palace from c.1880 to the mid-1920s.|$|E
5|$|Although the Doolittle Raid caused little damage, it had {{important}} ramifications. The attack raised morale in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> commander, Lieutenant Colonel James H. Doolittle, {{was seen}} as a hero. The weak state of the country's air defenses greatly embarrassed the Japanese military leadership, and four fighter groups were transferred from the Pacific to defend the home islands. In an attempt to prevent further naval raids, the IJN launched an offensive in the Pacific Ocean which ended in defeat during the Battle of Midway. The Japanese Army also conducted the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign to capture the airfields in central China at which the Doolittle Raiders had intended to land. This offensive achieved its objectives and resulted in the deaths of 250,000 Chinese soldiers and civilians; many of these civilian deaths were due to war crimes. The destruction of the airfields and heavy casualties badly damaged China's war effort. The IJA also began developing fire balloons capable of carrying incendiary and anti-personnel bombs from Japan to the continental United States.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 18th century, the British Empire had {{facilitated}} {{the spread of}} English through its colonies and geopolitical dominance. Commerce, science and technology, diplomacy, art, and formal education all contributed to English becoming the first truly global language. English also facilitated worldwide international communication. As England continued to form new colonies, these in turn became independent and developed their own norms for how to speak and write the language. English was adopted in North America, India, parts of Africa, Australasia, and many other regions. In the post-colonial period, some of the newly created nations that had multiple indigenous languages opted to continue using English as the official language to avoid the political difficulties inherent in promoting any one indigenous language above the others. In the 20th century the growing economic and cultural influence of <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> status as a superpower following the Second World War has, along with worldwide broadcasting in English by the BBC and other broadcasters, significantly accelerated {{the spread of the}} language across the planet. By the 21st century, English was more widely spoken and written than any language has ever been.|$|E
