5|$|This was {{the first}} {{election}} since the Act on a Candidate's Election Funding came into force in May 2009, along with the 2010 amendments to the Act on Political Parties. Both laws mandate the disclosure {{of the sources of}} campaign finance and expenses. Every candidate and party as a whole must disclose their source of funding. Campaign funding may start six months before the election day and end two weeks after the election regardless of when <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> actually paid. The candidates must file a public report with the National Audit Office detailing their sources of all contributions of over €1,500 in value raised in support of the election campaign. The funds include expenses from the candidate's own assets, loans taken out for the campaign, and contributions received by either the individual or by a group that supports the candidate. Candidates are barred from receiving anonymous contributions of over €1,500 in value.|$|E

25|$|If Pa {{separation}} is specified, {{this must be}} done quite often (for example, every 10 days) to be effective. For a 1GW, 1-fluid plant this means about 10% of the fuel or about 15 t of fuel salt need to go through reprocessing every day.

25|$|The {{sovereign}} {{and other}} members of the Royal Family are only supported by tax dollars in the performance of their official duties. Should a province be hosting events that involve royal participation, <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> also split between the federal and provincial spheres—the provincial Crown may pay for accommodation and transport, while the federal Crown supplies funds for Royal Canadian Mounted Police security and other household staff. Residents of the provinces do not pay any money to the royals, either as personal income or to support royal residences outside of the province.|$|E
25|$|Possible undue {{hardship}} for the defendant. The defendant must explain what the hardship {{is and how}} material <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>are.</b> If there are costs involved, {{they need to be}} spelled out. If there is a difficulty in getting witnesses out of a foreign court and into the original court, this needs to be revealed to the court. The defendant must explain why the use of letters rogatory or other judicial reciprocity tools are not sufficient and cannot replace actual transfer of the case. The standard that the defendant must meet is “overwhelming hardship” if they are required to litigate in the forum’s State.|$|E

50|$|A {{second point}} about free permits (usually “grandfathered,” i.e. given out in {{proportion}} to past emissions) has often been misunderstood. Companies that receive free permits, treat {{them as if they}} had paid full price for them. This is because using carbon in production has <b>the</b> same <b>cost</b> under both arrangements. With auctioned permits, <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>is</b> obvious. With free permits, <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of not selling the permit at full value — this is termed an “opportunity cost.” Since <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of emissions <b>is</b> generally a marginal cost (increasing with output), <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>is</b> passed on by raising <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of output (e.g. raising <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of gasoline or electricity).|$|R

25|$|The city of Zürich {{is among}} the world-leaders in {{protecting}} the climate by following a manifold approach. In November 2008 the people of Zürich voted in a public referendum to write into law the quantifiable and fixed deadline of one tonne of CO2 per person per annum by 2050. This forces any decision of the executive to support this goal, even if <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> higher in all dimensions. Some examples are the new disinfection section of the public city hospital in Triemli (Minergie-P quality – passive house), the continued optimisation and creation of public transportation, enlargement of the bicycle-only network, research and projects for renewable energy and enclosure of speed-ways.|$|E

While in water supply systems cost recovery levels are satisfactory, the situation regarding sanitation is clearly unsustainable. The coastal urban regions show greater cost recovery ratios than the inland regions, especially regarding the Northeast region where <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> higher and revenues are lower. A decree defining {{the water and}} sanitation tariff policy is being finalized in 2007.

2500|$|The {{majority}} opinion {{goes on to}} note that the costs of exclusion for knock and announce violations outweigh the benefits of admitting the evidence. [...] Scalia states that <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> small, but that [...] "suppression of all evidence amount in many cases is a get-out-of-jail-free card." [...] The Court states that exclusion of evidence has little or no deterrence effect, especially considering that deterrents (a civil action against the police department and internal discipline for officers) already exist. [...] Scalia ends the portion of his opinion which constitutes the {{majority opinion}} with praise for the [...] "increasing professionalism" [...] of the police force over the last half-century, which he says makes some concerns expressed in past cases by the Court obsolete.|$|E

2500|$|A {{challenge}} for the modern archaeologist is to consider whether [...] in-situ preservation, or recovery and conservation on land is the preferable option; or {{to face the fact}} that preservation in any form, other than as an archaeological record is not feasible. A site that has been discovered has typically been subjected to disturbance of the very factors that caused its survival in the first place, for example, when a covering of sediment has been removed by storms or the action of man. Active monitoring and deliberate protection may mitigate [...] further rapid destruction making in situ preservation an option, but long-term survival can never be guaranteed. For very many sites, <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> too great for either active measures to ensure in situ preservation or to provide for satisfactory conservation on recovery. Even the cost of proper and complete archaeological investigation may be too great to enable this to occur within a timescale that ensures that an archaeological record is made before data is inevitably lost.|$|E

Old Fogg looked first at the money, and then at him, and then he coughed in his rum way, so that I knew something was coming. [...] "You don't know there's a declaration filed, which increases the costs materially, I suppose," [...] said Fogg. [...] "You don't say that, sir," [...] said Ramsey, starting back; [...] "the time was only out last night, Sir." [...] "I do say it, though," [...] said Fogg, [...] "my clerk's just gone to file it. Hasn't Mr. Jackson gone to file that declaration in Bullman and Ramsey, Mr. Wicks?" [...] Of course I said yes, and then Fogg coughed again, and looked at Ramsey. [...] "My God!"

[...] "None at all," [...] said Fogg coolly; [...] "so you had better go back and scrape some more together, and bring it here in time." [...] "I can't get it, by God!"

[...] Well, Ramsey tried to speak, but Fogg wouldn't let him, so he put the money in his pocket, and sneaked out. The door was scarcely shut, when old Fogg turned round to me, with a sweet smile on his face, and drew the declaration out of his coat pocket.
