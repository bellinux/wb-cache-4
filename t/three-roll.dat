50|$|The <b>three-roll</b> mill {{has proven}} to be the most {{successful}} of the range of roll mills which saw extensive development in the 19th century. These included the single-roll mill and the five-roll mill. The single-roll mill works by material passing between the roll and a fixed bar pressing against the roll. The five-roll mill incorporates four successively smaller in-running nips and hence, compared to the <b>three-roll</b> mill, allows the use of larger agglomerates as part of the input material- but is correspondingly more complicated and expensive.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Three-Roll</b> Push Bending (TRPB) is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used freeform-bending process to manufacture bending geometries consisting of several plane bending curves. Nevertheless, a 3D-shaping is possible. The profile is guided between bending-roll and supporting-roll(s), while being pushed through the tools. The position of the forming-roll defines the bending radius. The bending point is the tangent-point between tube and bending-roll. To change the bending plane, the pusher rotates the tube around its longitudinal axis. Generally, a TRPB tool kit can be applied on a conventional rotary draw bending machine. The process is very flexible since with a unique tool set, several bending radii values Rm can be obtained, although the geometrical precision of the process is not comparable to rotary draw bending. Bending contours defined as spline- or polynomial-functions can be manufactured.|$|E

40|$|A {{large number}} of flows with {{distinctive}} patterns have been observed in experiments and simulations of Rayleigh-Benard convection in a water-filled cylinder whose radius is twice the height. We have adapted a time-dependent pseudospectral code, first, to carry out Newton's method and branch continuation and, second, {{to carry out the}} exponential power method and Arnoldi iteration to calculate leading eigenpairs and determine the stability of the steady states.

The diagram contains 17 branches of stable and unstable steady states. These can be classified geometrically as roll states containing two, three, and four rolls; axisymmetric patterns with one or two tori; three-fold symmetric patterns called mercedes, mitubishi, marigold and cloverleaf; trigonometric patterns called dipole and pizza; and less symmetric patterns called CO and asymmetric <b>three-rolls.</b> The convective branches are connected to the conductive state and to each other by 16 primary and secondary pitchfork bifurcations and turning points.

This article proposed a new idea to alleviate the secondary torsion phenomenon by dividing the secondary torsion segment out of the roll as an independent and passive one.

Comparing the simulation results of the two models, the results indicated that the change in the roll structure had just a little influence on the metal deformation, temperature, and rolling force, but it lessened the secondary torsion deformation effectively and improved the outside roundness of the rolled tube slightly.

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} an {{investigation}} to identify methods {{to increase the}} capacity or throughput of the six-roll roller mills used in Australia to extract sugar from sugarcane. The approach taken was to {{gain an understanding of}} the factors affecting mill throughput through the application of the computational milling model, developed in recent years at James Cook University. The computational milling model is based on general equations of force equilibrium and continuity and a general description of sugarcane material behaviour. The development of the throughput model was conducted in stages. Firstly, an experiment was conducted on a laboratory two-roll mill to gain an understanding of the factors affecting throughput on this simple milling geometry. A two-roll computational model was constructed to predict the observed behaviour, accounting for all mechanisms identified from the experimental results. Secondly, a <b>three-roll</b> computational model was constructed which was sufficient to describe the throughput behaviour of the factory six-roll mill. An experiment was conducted on a factory six-roll mill to provide data to validate the model. The <b>three-roll</b> computational model was tested across the range of geometries and operating conditions known to exist in Australian factories and its throughput predictions were tested against throughput measurements. The <b>three-roll</b> computational model was used to identify the main factors affecting mill throughput and was used to construct a data set across a wide range of parameter values. The data set was used in a multiple regression analysis to develop an empirical model that could readily be used to identify conditions for maximum throughput. The computational and empirical models developed during this investigation were shown to predict throughput better than existing models. Conditions for maximum throughput were identified and involved the openings between rolls, the speed of the rolls and the amount of water in the sugarcane material being processed. As part of the investigation, further development of the computational milling model was undertaken in order to advance the model to a sufficient standard for this investigation. A material parameter was introduced to define the hardening rule for the plastic material model following established soil mechanics methodology. Darcy’s law, describing fluid flow through porous media, was shown to adequately describe the flow of water through bagasse {{for a wide range of}} fluid velocities. Greater confidence in the measured magnitude of the permeability factor in Darcy’s law was gained through improved experimental and parameter estimation procedures.

40|$|Abstract. During {{the last}} 90 years, {{a lot of}} works have been {{published}} about rolling theories for the two-roll rolling process (2 RP). In the last decades, the <b>three-roll</b> process (3 RP) has become a significant technique {{in the production of}} wire rod and bars, as it allows to cover a wide range of finished dimensions with one pass design, or to realize very close tolerances, depending on the pass design method used (free size rolling or high precision rolling). Horihata and Motomura [2] made use of the upper bound theorem to construct a method for spread calculation, but up to now, a straightforward mathematical method for calculation of stress distribution, roll forces, torques and forward slip is still missing. The present paper aims at a transfer of the slab method, which is well-known and established for the 2 RP, to the 3 RP. After the rolling theory for flat passes is introduced, Lendl’s equivalent pass method is transferred to the 3 RP, which allows the calculation of section passes. Computational results show, that roll forces, torques and forward slips can be calculated under inclusion of elastic stand feedback and interstand tensions. Therefore the model can be used for roll speed set-up to minimize interstand tensions, which is of great importance for the rolling industry...|$|E
