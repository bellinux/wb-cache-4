Participants included 100 mothers, 67 of whom were adult mothers and 33 were adolescent mothers. Findings indicated that in comparison to adult mothers, adolescent mothers report more security within their attachment to their children, tend to utilize more permissive <b>parenting,</b> <b>and</b> report more <b>parenting</b> stress. Significant {{differences were found between}} adult and adolescent mothers on cognitive readiness <b>to</b> <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> perceived social support, but these constructs did not predict the outcome variables.

[...] Keating mentioned links between pornography and Communism at other times, but distanced himself from the more fervent anti-Communist groups of the early 1960s.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a description}} of a case study of <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> community involvement and the impact of that involvement on education. The study is based upon the observations, interviews, and reflections of the writer in one elementary school as a plan was implemented <b>to</b> increase <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> community involvement in that school. The primary methods of data collection were structured, open-ended interviews, transcribed minutes from various school-based committees, attendance logs, and event participant logs. The writer interviewed the school’s principal, four parents whose children attend the study school, five individual teachers, a focus group of five teachers, the school’s guidance counselor, two business partners, and members of the School Council. Findings from the study identified effective research-based, best practices implemented at the study school. Study results indicate that <b>to</b> increase <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> community involvement, schools need supportive administrators, who are willing <b>to</b> involve <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> community members in the decision-making process and who are willing <b>to</b> welcome <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> community members into the school. Additionally, schools need to provide professional training for staff in how to effectively use volunteers in the classroom, in two-way communication with <b>parents,</b> <b>and</b> in the skills needed by teachers <b>to</b> assist <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> community members in moving to the next level of <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> community involvement. Training programs and initiatives need to be provided by schools <b>to</b> help <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> community members assume a more direct and sustained role in reinforcing and promoting students’ academic achievement. Finally, schools desiring <b>to</b> increase <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> community involvement must possess patience and a willingness to change. Suggestions for further research on this topic are also included in this paper...|$|R

This study describes {{the development of the}} SOM and investigates its psychometric properties in 86 children with Autism spectrum disorder, aged 9. 8 - 13. 1 years. The interrater reliability was found to be good to excellent. The convergent validity was low in relation <b>to</b> <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> teacher reports of social skills, <b>and</b> also <b>to</b> <b>parent</b> interview on adaptive social functioning. Therefore this direct observation seems to provide additional information on the frequency and quality of social behaviors in daily life situations.

2500|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) {{was first}} added to newborn screening programs in New Zealand and regions of Australia in 1981, by measuring immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) in dried blood spots.

[...] CF is included in the core panel of conditions recommended for inclusion in all 50 states, Texas was the last state to implement their screening program for CF in 2010.

[...] Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island do not include CF in their screening programs.

[...] Inspection reports refer specifically to seven monks who have worked at the school at different times and whose behaviour has been [...] "a cause for concern". [...] The Independent Schools Inspectorate had previously criticised a lack of urgency in making improvements to child protection. The Charity Commission also sent a compliance team to work with the school on this, which it treated as [...] "a high-risk case". The Abbot responded by apologising <b>to</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> reported that 50 years of confidential school records indicated that four of the monks had faced police action, two had restrictions imposed on them, and one was cleared and returned to monastic life. A review of school governance was already taking place.
