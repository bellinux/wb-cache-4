Research showed {{that women were}} reluctant to carry a pack of Lucky Strike cigarettes, because the brand's green color scheme clashed with popular fashion choices.

5|$|In various {{applications}} to physical problems, a function can be decomposed into physically meaningful eigenfunctions of a differential operator (typically the Laplace operator): this forms {{the foundation for}} the spectral study of functions, in reference to the spectrum of the differential operator. A concrete physical application involves the problem of hearing the shape of a drum: given the fundamental modes of vibration that a drumhead is capable of producing, can one infer the shape of the drum itself? The mathematical formulation of this question involves the Dirichlet eigenvalues of the Laplace equation in the plane, <b>that</b> <b>represent</b> the fundamental modes of vibration in direct analogy with the integers <b>that</b> <b>represent</b> the fundamental modes of vibration of the violin string.|$|E

Mount Cleveland is a site of persistent steam emissions and thermal anomalies <b>that</b> <b>represent</b> constant background activity.
