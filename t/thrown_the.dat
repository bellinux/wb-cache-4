5|$|Immediately after Warne and Waugh had met John in Colombo, Australia {{defeated}} Pakistan in {{a one-day}} match, scoring 7/179 and restricting Pakistan to 9/151 in reply. There were suspicions that the Pakistanis had <b>thrown</b> <b>the</b> game by batting slowly, although Warne {{said he had}} genuinely tried his best, pointing {{out that he was}} named man-of-the-match. Warne and May had alleged that Malik offered them money to bowl badly {{on the final day of}} the First Test in Karachi. Australia then reduced Pakistan from 3/157 to 9/258, and appeared set for victory, but a last-wicket partnership took them to the target of 314. The win was registered when wicket-keeper Ian Healy missed a stumping chance from Warne and the ball went for four byes. Warne denied that he had <b>thrown</b> <b>the</b> match, again pointing out he was named man-of-the-match. Waugh had alleged that Malik offered him money to help Australia lose a one-day match during the same tour. He denied the allegation that he did so. Waugh scored an unbeaten 121, but it was not enough to prevent Australia from suffering a nine-wicket defeat.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the conference, Keynes came up with a {{plan that}} he argued would not only help Germany and other impoverished central European powers but also be good for the world economy as a whole. It {{involved}} the radical writing down of war debts, which would have had the possible effect of increasing international trade all round, but at the same time <b>thrown</b> <b>the</b> entire cost of European reconstruction on the United States.|$|E
5|$|Having {{been the}} franchise's {{starting}} quarterback for 13 seasons (longer {{than any other}} Vikings player), Fran Tarkenton holds {{the record for the}} most starts in a Vikings jersey, and those for the most wins and ties. He is also the franchise's leading passer in terms of numbers of attempts, completions, total yards gained and passing touchdowns, although Brett Favre has the best pass completion percentage. However, Tarkenton has also <b>thrown</b> <b>the</b> most interceptions. The record for the longest completed pass by a Vikings starting quarterback is held by Gus Frerotte, who threw a 99-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Bernard Berrian in a home game against the Chicago Bears in the 2008 season.|$|E

5|$|The 1993 season saw long-time Red Sox fan {{favorite}} Wade Boggs defect to the Yankees after eleven {{seasons with}} Boston. Later in September 1993, the Yankees defeated Boston at Yankee Stadium via a last-moment reprieve. Trailing 3–1, Mike Stanley's apparent fly out {{with two outs}} in the ninth was nullified by a fan running onto the field prior to the pitch being <b>thrown.</b> <b>The</b> umpire had called time and when play resumed, Stanley singled. The Yankees would rally to score three runs and win on a Mattingly single.|$|E
5|$|The River Brue {{marks the}} {{boundary}} with Glastonbury, {{to the north}} of Street. At the time of King Arthur, the Brue formed a lake just south of the hilly ground on which Glastonbury stands. This lake is one of the locations suggested by Arthurian legend as the home of the Lady of the Lake. Pomparles Bridge stood at the western end of this lake, guarding Glastonbury from the south, and it was here that Sir Bedivere is thought to have <b>thrown</b> <b>the</b> sword Excalibur into the waters after King Arthur fell at the Battle of Camlann. The old bridge was replaced by a reinforced concrete arch bridge in 1911.|$|E
5|$|When Monk {{returns with}} Natalie (Traylor Howard) to Dr. Kroger's office, they meet Francis Merrigan (Gordon Clapp), who owns an {{importing}} and exporting business {{based in the}} same building. Merrigan is carrying a milk carton, which {{he says he is}} utilizing for a coffeemaker. That night, someone throws a rock through the window of Dr. Kroger's house. Stottlemeyer and Disher keep the suspicion on one of Dr. Kroger's patients. As they interview the Kroger family, they learn Kroger suspects his rebellious son Troy (Cody McMains) did it. Monk, however, believes that whoever killed Teresa might have <b>thrown</b> <b>the</b> rock to make everyone believe that one of Dr. Kroger's patients is involved. Monk recognizes the rock, though he does not know where he saw it.|$|E

5|$|During the 110meters hurdles, Maurice Smith {{was placed}} in the second heat against eight other athletes. Maurice Smith ranked third with a time of 14.08seconds. Andres Raja of Estonia ranked second (14.06seconds) and American decathlete Bryan Clay ranked first (13.93seconds). He placed fourth of the 29 {{finishing}} athletes. In the discus throw event, Maurice Smith was in the first heat and placed second out of the 14 finishing athletes, having <b>thrown</b> <b>the</b> discus 53.79meters away. Pogorelov finished directly behind Smith (50.04meters), while Clay finished directly ahead of him (53.79meters). Overall, 29 competitors finished the event. The Jamaican athlete ranked second. In the pole vault, Smith vaunted over a 4.6meter-tall bar. He placed fifth of the 11 people who finished in his heat, behind Belarus' Mikalai Shubianok and ahead of China's Qi Haifeng. Of the 24 finishing athletes, Smith ranked 18th. Javelin occurred next; he participated in the first heat of the event, finishing ninth out of 13 finishing athletes after throwing the javelin 51.52meters. Smith placed between Kasyanov (51.59meters) and Iran's Hadi Sepehrzad (49.56meters) in a heat led by Garcia (65.60meters) and France's Romain Barras (65.40meters). The final event of the decathlon was the 1500meters decathlon; Maurice Smith participated in the second heat, placing fifth of 13 athletes by finishing the race in 4:31.62 between Barras (4:29.29) and Germany's Andre Niklaus (4:32.90). He placed seventh of 26 athletes, concluding the decathlon. Smith accrued 8,205points, ranking ninth of the 26 athletes that finished the decathlon.|$|E
5|$|On 27 May 1849, {{stores were}} taken from a hut on Thomas Cooper Horn's station and a hutkeeper and {{shepherd}} were threatened by Aboriginal people, who left with the goods they had taken. The station owner {{and some of his}} station hands pursued the group, and when they caught up with the fleeing party of Aboriginal people shots were fired and spears <b>thrown.</b> <b>The</b> Aboriginal group split in two, and Horn and his men followed one party to the Waterloo Bay cliffs, which the group tried to climb down in order to make their escape. Horn and his men opened fire, and two Aboriginal people were killed and one was fatally wounded, with several more being captured. The Government Resident and the police inspector from Port Lincoln both wrote detailed accounts of the incident, neither of which mentioned a large number of casualties. One specified that only two Aboriginal people were killed. In September, a group of Aboriginal men were transported to Adelaide for trial. Two were convicted of the murder of Beevor, and were transported back to the Elliston district where they were hanged outside his hut. Three were charged with the murder of Easton, but were acquitted due to lack of evidence. A number of others were charged over the confrontation at the hut on Horn's station. Shortly after this, two more Aboriginal men were arrested in Port Lincoln by the police and charged with the murder of Hamp. Found guilty and sentenced to death, they were later released when doubts were raised about the testimony of Aboriginal witnesses located by the police. In February 1852 another Aboriginal male was arrested as an accomplice in Hamp's murder, but after being transported to Adelaide, he too was released due to lack of evidence. He tried to walk home to his country, and was murdered by four Aboriginal men for trespassing.|$|E
5|$|Six {{teams from}} North America and six teams {{representing}} {{the rest of}} the World play a series of games against each other in order to win points. The first side to win a majority of the points available wins the cup. Teams compete in four formats: team games, mixed doubles games, singles competitions, and skins games. Team games are regular curling games, with two teams of four playing against each other. Mixed doubles games involve two teams, each consisting of one male and one female, playing against each other. Mixed doubles teams use only six stones per end, one of which is positioned {{prior to the start of}} the end. This is in contrast to the eight stones per end used by teams of four in regular curling games. The singles competition involves two teams playing against each other. There are six types of shots contested in the singles competitions. Each curler from each team is assigned to throw at least one type of shot. Points are given based on how well the shot is made. After all of the shots have been <b>thrown,</b> <b>the</b> team with the most points wins the competition. Skins games involve two teams playing against each other, where the objective is to win skins by scoring two or more points with the hammer or stealing points without the hammer. The points for the skins games, which go toward the total points for the cup, are distributed throughout the game, and the teams earn these points by winning skins.|$|E

5|$|The trial, Illinois vs. August Spies et al., {{began on}} June 21, 1886, {{and went on}} until August 11. The trial was {{conducted}} {{in an atmosphere of}} extreme prejudice by both public and media toward the defendants. It was presided over by Judge Joseph Gary. Judge Gary displayed open hostility to the defendants, consistently ruled for the prosecution, and failed to maintain decorum. A motion to try the defendants separately was denied. The defense counsel included Sigmund Zeisler, William Perkins Black, William Foster, and Moses Salomon. Selection of the jury was extraordinarily difficult, lasting three weeks, and nearly one thousand people called. All union members and anyone who expressed sympathy toward socialism were dismissed. In the end a jury of 12 was seated, most of whom confessed prejudice towards the defendants. Despite their professions of prejudice Judge Gary seated those who declared that despite their prejudices they would acquit if the evidence supported it, refusing to dismiss for prejudice. Eventually the peremptory challenges of the defense were exhausted. Frustrated by the hundreds of jurors who were being dismissed, a bailiff was appointed who selected jurors rather than calling them at random. The bailiff proved prejudiced himself and selected jurors who seemed likely to convict based on their social position and attitudes toward the defendants. The prosecution, led by Julius Grinnell, argued that since the defendants had not actively discouraged the person who had <b>thrown</b> <b>the</b> bomb, they were therefore equally responsible as conspirators. The jury heard the testimony of 118 people, including 54 members of the Chicago Police Department and the defendants Fielden, Schwab, Spies and Parsons. Albert Parsons' brother claimed there was evidence linking the Pinkertons to the bomb. This reflected a widespread belief among the strikers.|$|E
5|$|The {{tactical}} {{decision that}} precedes almost every {{play in a}} baseball game involves pitch selection. By gripping and then releasing the baseball in a certain manner, and by throwing it at a certain speed, pitchers can cause the baseball to break to either side, or downward, as it approaches the batter. Among the resulting wide variety of pitches that may be <b>thrown,</b> <b>the</b> four basic types are the fastball, the changeup (or off-speed pitch), and two breaking balls—the curveball and the slider. Pitchers have different repertoires of pitches they are skillful at throwing. Conventionally, before each pitch, the catcher signals the pitcher what type of pitch to throw, {{as well as its}} general vertical and/or horizontal location. If there is disagreement on the selection, the pitcher may shake off the sign and the catcher will call for a different pitch. With a runner on base and taking a lead, the pitcher may attempt a pickoff, a quick throw to a fielder covering the base to keep the runner's lead in check or, optimally, effect a tag out. Pickoff attempts, however, are subject to rules that severely restrict the pitcher's movements before and during the pickoff attempt. Violation of any one of these rules could result in the umpire calling a balk against the pitcher, with the result being runners on base, if any, advance one base with impunity. If an attempted stolen base is anticipated, the catcher may call for a pitchout, a ball thrown deliberately off the plate, allowing the catcher to catch it while standing and throw quickly to a base. Facing a batter with a strong tendency to hit {{to one side of the}} field, the fielding team may employ a shift, with most or all of the fielders moving to the left or right of their usual positions. With a runner on third base, the infielders may play in, moving closer to home plate to improve the odds of throwing out the runner on a ground ball, though a sharply hit grounder is more likely to carry through a drawn-in infield.|$|E
