5|$|City have {{previously}} worn three other badges on their shirts, {{prior to their}} current badge which was implemented in 2016. The first, introduced in 1970, was based on designs which had been used on official club documentation since the mid-1960s. It consisted of a circular badge which used the same shield as the current badge, inside a circle bearing {{the name of the}} club. In 1972, this was replaced by a variation which replaced {{the lower half of the}} shield with the red rose of Lancashire. On occasions when Manchester City plays in a major cup final, the usual badge has not been used; instead shirts bearing a badge of the arms of the City of Manchester are used, as a symbol of pride in representing the city of Manchester at a major event. This practice originates from a time when the players' shirts did not normally bear a badge of any kind, but has continued throughout the history of the club. For the 2011 FA Cup Final, City used the usual badge with a special legend, but the Manchester coat of arms was included as a small monochrome logo in <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back of players' shirts.|$|E
5|$|Veronica waits with Keith at an {{election}} party, where tensions are high {{due to the}} election being extremely close. Sheriff Lamb (Michael Muhney) is nosing ahead before a man walks up to Lamb and says that he made the anonymous call from the bridge where Felix Toombs was stabbed. Keith loses the election {{by a margin of}} 51% to 49%. After we learn that Woody Goodman (Steve Guttenberg) has been elected mayor, Dick Casablancas (Ryan Hansen) hits on Gia Goodman (Krysten Ritter). Officers come in and arrest Logan for the murder of Felix Toombs before Veronica goes home and finds Abel Koontz, who is in the latter stages of stomach cancer. He asks her to help him find his daughter, Amelia, who has disappeared, and Veronica agrees. Veronica talks to Amelia's old boyfriend, who has not seen her for a while; Amelia ditched the boyfriend in Europe. Cliff McCormack (Daran Norris) is appointed to be Logan's lawyer before Veronica asks Cliff to call <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> phone cards that Amelia stole under an alias. Cliff tells Logan that he should get a different lawyer. Veronica finds out that Amelia called from Neptune (Veronica's town) the previous week. Logan is placed in a cell with his father, Aaron (Harry Hamlin), who is temporarily being held there before his trial for the murder of Lilly Kane. Logan receives bail, but Weevil and his friends are angry about this fact. Veronica breaks into Clarence Wiedman's (Christopher B. Duncan) office, but he denies any knowledge of the situation.|$|E

25|$|As a {{marketing}} move for the AMX, AMC affixed a small {{plate with a}} number {{to the center of}} the dash (1968-1969) or to the glovebox door (1970). These are random numbers. They do not coincide with any other identifying number such as the car's VIN code, dealer or zone order, production sequence, nor build date. For example, <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 1970 models ranged from 014469 to 18584.|$|E
25|$|The {{circle is}} {{commonly}} used to represent the relationship between diatonic scales. Here, the letters on the circle are taken to represent the major scale with that note as tonic. <b>The</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> inside of the circle show how many sharps or flats the key signature for this scale has. Thus a major scale built on A has 3 sharps in its key signature. The major scale built on F has 1 flat.|$|E

25|$|When {{designing}} a device capable of computing, {{it is often}} necessary to convert parallel data lines into a serial data stream. This conversion allows different pieces of data to {{be reduced to a}} time-dependent series of values on a single wire. Figure 9 shows such a parallel-to-serial conversion QCA device. <b>The</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shaded areas represent different clocking zones at consecutive 90-degree phases. Notice how all the inputs are on the same clocking zone. If parallel data were to be driven at the inputs A, B, C and D, and then driven no more for at least the remaining 15 serial transmission phases, the output X would present the values of D, C, B and A –in that order, at phases three, seven, eleven and fifteen. If a new clocking region were to be added at the output, it could be clocked to latch a value corresponding to any of the inputs by correctly selecting an appropriate state-locking period.|$|E

2500|$|An {{example of}} {{operational}} {{definition of the}} term weight of an object, operationalized to a degree, would be the following: [...] "weight is the numbers that appear when that object is placed on a weighing scale". According to it, the weight can be any of the numbers shown on the scale after, including the very moment the object is put on it. Clearly, the inclusion of the moment when one can start reading <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> scale would make it more fully an operational definition. Nonetheless, it is still in contrast to those purely theoretical definitions.|$|E
2500|$|This status {{did have}} {{disadvantages}} however. For instance, official name registers and property titles {{had to be}} in either German, French, or Italian. This meant that Romansh-speaking parents were often forced to register their children under German or Italian versions of their Romansh names. As late as 1984, the Canton of Grisons was ordered not to make entries into its corporate registry in Romansh. The Swiss National Bank first planned to include Romansh on its bills in 1956, when a new series was introduced. Due to disputes within the Lia Rumantscha over whether the bills were to feature the Sursilvan version [...] "Banca nazionala svizra" [...] or the Vallader version [...] "Banca naziunala svizzra", the bills eventually featured the Italian version twice, alongside French and German. When new bills were again introduced in 1976/77, a Romansh version was added by finding a compromise between the two largest varieties Sursilvan and Vallader, which read [...] "Banca naziunala svizra". <b>The</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bills were printed in Surmiran, a minor intermediate dialect.|$|E
