The photos showed slash marks all over Saqer's back and other signs of physical abuse, and were also stated <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>accurate</b> by an HRW researcher who had seen the body prior to burial. Five prison guards were subsequently charged with Saqer's death.|$|E

5|$|In 1936, Romanian {{physicist}} Horia Hulubei and his French colleague Yvette Cauchois also analyzed pollucite, {{this time}} using their high-resolution X-ray apparatus. They observed several weak emission lines, which they {{presumed to be}} those of element 87. Hulubei and Cauchois reported their discovery and proposed the name moldavium, along with the symbol Ml, after Moldavia, the Romanian province where Hulubei was born. In 1937, Hulubei's work was criticized by American physicist F. H. Hirsh Jr., who rejected Hulubei's research methods. Hirsh was certain that eka-caesium would not be found in nature, and that Hulubei had instead observed mercury or bismuth X-ray lines. Hulubei insisted that his X-ray apparatus and methods were too accurate {{to make such a}} mistake. Because of this, Jean Baptiste Perrin, Nobel Prize winner and Hulubei's mentor, endorsed moldavium as the true eka-caesium over Marguerite Perey's recently discovered francium. Perey took pains <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>accurate</b> and detailed in her criticism of Hulubei's work, and finally she was credited as the sole discoverer of element 87. All other previous purported discoveries of element 87 were ruled out due to francium's very limited half-life.|$|E

25|$|An {{effective}} fast bowler {{needs to}} be able to hold a consistent line and length, or in common terms, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>accurate.</b> In this context, line refers to the path of the ball towards the batsman, in the horizontal dimension running from the off to the leg side, while length describes the distance the ball travels toward the batsman before bouncing. Variations in length is generally seen as the more important of the two for a fast bowler. The faster the bowler, the harder it is to achieve consistent line and length but sheer speed can make up for the shortfall. Fast bowlers who also manage <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>accurate</b> can be devastatingly effective, for example the likes of Australian pace bowler Glenn McGrath and South African pace bowler Shaun Pollock.|$|E

25|$|Another {{assumption}} is that heat loss from the calorimeter maintains the same relationship with measured temperature as found when calibrating the calorimeter. This assumption ceases <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>accurate</b> if the temperature distribution within the cell becomes significantly altered from the condition under which calibration measurements were made. This can happen, for example, if fluid circulation within the cell becomes significantly altered. Recombination of hydrogen and oxygen within the calorimeter would also alter the heat distribution and invalidate the calibration.|$|E
25|$|A {{completely}} different approach is often taken for very large systems, which would otherwise {{take too much}} time or memory. The idea is to start with an initial approximation to the solution (which does not have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>accurate</b> at all), and to change this approximation in several steps to bring it closer to the true solution. Once the approximation is sufficiently accurate, this is taken to be {{the solution to the}} system. This leads to the class of iterative methods.|$|E
