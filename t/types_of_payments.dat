40|$|Background: The <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> is one <b>of</b> the {{important}} factors {{that has an}} effect on the health of employees, as a basic working condition. In the conventional research field of occupational safety and health, only the physical, chemical, biological, and ergonomic factors are treated as the main hazardous factors. Managerial factors and basic working conditions such as working hours and the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> are neglected. This paper aimed to investigate the association <b>of</b> the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> and the exposure to the various hazardous factors as an heuristic study. Methods: The third Korean Working Conditions Survey (KWCS) by the Occupational Safety and Health Research Institute in 2011 was used for this study. Among the total sample of 50, 032 economically active persons, 34, 788 employees were considered for analysis. This study examined the relation between the three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> such as basic fixed salary and wage, piece rate, and extra payment for bad and dangerous working conditions and exposure to hazardous factors like vibration, noise, temperature, chemical contact, and working at very high speeds. Multivariate regression analysis was used to measure the effect <b>of</b> the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> on working hours exposed to hazards. Results: The result showed that the proportion of employees with a basic fixed salary was 94. 5 %, the proportion with piece rates was 38. 6 %, and the proportion who received extra payment for hazardous working conditions was 11. 7 %. Conclusion: The piece rate was associated with exposure to working with tight deadlines and stressful jobs. This study had some limitations because KWCS was a cross-sectional survey...|$|R

50|$|Mercantilism is an {{economic}} policy that emphasizes the goal of each nation was to gain {{as much money as}} possible by whatever means. The belief was that the richer the nation the more powerful it was. The idea behind it was an outgrowth of the guild system, as guilds were monopolistic enterprises: they regulated trade within towns by controlling the creation of goods, regulated themselves through their system of apprenticeship, kept outside traders from selling goods in the town, and forced outsiders to pay tolls and other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> for the privilege of doing business in that town.
