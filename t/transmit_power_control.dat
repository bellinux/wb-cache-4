Sensor network usually consists {{of a large number of}} ultra small autonomous devices. The resource constraint nature of these ultra small devices poses an immediate need for resource management. A fundamental component of resource management is transmitter <b>power</b> <b>control</b> and an efficient <b>power</b> <b>control</b> technique is essential to support system quality and efficiency in wireless sensor networks. The data transmitted from the sensor nodes is highly susceptible to error in a wireless environment which increases the <b>transmit</b> <b>power.</b> Error <b>control</b> coding (ECC) schemes can improve the system performance and has an impact on energy consumption as node energy is sturdily influenced by the modulation and error correction coding used.

40|$|Network-on-chip (NoC) is an on-chip {{communication}} network that allows parallel communication between all cores to improve inter-core performance. Wireless NoC (WiNoC) introduces long-range and high bandwidth radio frequency (RF) interconnects that can possibly reduce the multi-hop communication of the planar metal interconnects in conventional NoC platforms. In WiNoC, RF transceivers {{account for a}} significant power consumption, particularly its transmitter, out of its total communication energy. CurrentWiNoC architectures employ constant maximum <b>transmitting</b> <b>power</b> for communicating radio hubs regardless of physical location of the receiver radio hubs. Besides, high transmission power consumption in WiNoC with constant maximum power suffers from significant energy and load imbalance among RF transceivers which lead to hotspot formation, thus affecting {{the reliability of the}} onchip network system. There are two main objectives covered by this thesis. Firstly, this work proposes a reconfigurable <b>transmitting</b> <b>power</b> <b>control</b> scheme that, by using bit error rate (BER) estimation obtained at the receiver’s side, dynamically calibrates the <b>transmitting</b> <b>power</b> level needed for communication between the source and destination radio hubs. The proposed scheme achieves significant total system energy reduction by about 40 % with an average performance degradation of 3 % and with no impact on throughput. The proposed design utilizes a small fraction of both area and power overheads (about 0. 1 %) out of total transceiver properties. The proposed technique is generic and can be applied to any WiNoC architecture for improving its energy efficiency with a negligible overhead in terms of silicon area. Secondly, an energyaware adaptive packet relocator scheme has been proposed. Based on transmission energy consumption and predefined energy threshold, packets are routed to adjacent transmitter for communication with receiver radio hub, with an aim to balance energy distribution in WiNoC. The proposed strategy alone achieves total communication energy savings of about 8 %. A joint scheme of the reconfigurable <b>transmitting</b> <b>power</b> management and energy-aware adaptive packet relocator is also introduced. The scheme consistently results in an energy savings of 30 % with minimal performance degradation...|$|R

40|$|Considering the {{time-varying}} K-user single-antenna interference channel (IC), it {{has been}} shown that, when terminals have perfect global channel state information (CSI) and they can tolerate asymptotically long delay, applying an ergodic interference alignment (EIA) scheme can achieve half of the interference-free achievable rate. However, in practice obtaining such CSI is challenging, and only a limited delay is acceptable. This paper addresses data transmission over the IC by taking these concerns into account. Specifically, we consider the case that each transmitter attains only quantized CSI via limited feedback signals. This causes imperfect interference alignment and a degraded performance. We propose adaptive schemes to compensate the impact of the CSI uncertainties. We first study a <b>power</b> <b>control</b> problem which concerns how to communicate at fixed rates using minimum <b>transmit</b> <b>powers.</b> A <b>power</b> <b>control</b> algorithm is used to reach the solution.

In contrast, downlink optimization is generally a nontrivial task because the user SINRs depend on all optimization variables {{and have to be}} optimized jointly.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} project, {{the author has}} carried out a {{thorough}} study {{on the performance of}} an uplink wideband CDMA (WCDMA) cellular system under fast closed-loop <b>power</b> <b>control.</b> Two study approaches are taken. Firstly, analytical study is carried out over a simplified cellular system. A mathematical model for the received signal power is proposed in terms of the probability density function. A large number of important parameters affecting the system performance have been included. The parameters taken into account include Doppler frequency which is related to mobile station's velocity, number of resolvable multipaths, maximum allowable <b>transmitted</b> <b>power,</b> <b>power</b> <b>control</b> updating frequency, number of pilot symbols per transmission frame, and number of receive diversity antenna branches. A set of analytical expression is then derived for the evaluation of the system performance in terms of bit-error rate (BER). The proposed analytical analysis approach has been verified to give good prediction of the system BER performance through comparison with simulation. The mathematical expression derived allow quick analysis of how various parameters may effect the WCDMA system performance. Next, simulation approach is adopted where most of the assumptions made in the pervious analyses are relaxed. A number of parameters are not taken into account in analytical method, such as number of <b>power</b> <b>control</b> command bits, <b>power</b> adjustment step-size, feedback channel error rate, type of power estimator, and <b>power</b> adjustment step-size <b>control</b> logic due to mathematical complexity. With simulation approach, the study of these parameters can be carried out. The analytical expression derived earlier have helped to serve as a reference for calibrating the simulation program developed. A new method for estimating the received signal power based on Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) criteria is then proposed and is found to outperform the conventional power estimator at high mobile speed. Performance and characteristics of the conventional fixed step-size <b>power</b> <b>control</b> scheme has been examined and optimum step-sizes have been identified. A simple adaptive <b>power</b> adjustment step-size <b>control</b> based on information of current and past <b>power</b> <b>control</b> commands is found to be able to improve system performance at low mobile speed.
