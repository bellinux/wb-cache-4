5|$|Altgens {{tried to}} find a good camera angle on the bridge, but uniformed police said it was private {{property}} and turned him away, and he moved to a location within the plaza. He began photographing the motorcade on Main Street as the vehicles approached Houston Street, and got a close-up of the presidential limousine as it <b>turned</b> <b>right</b> onto Houston. He then picked up his equipment bag and ran on the grass toward the south curb along Elm Street, stopping across from the Plaza's north colonnade. Altgens heard a loud noise {{at about the same time}} as his first photograph from that spot (simultaneous to Zapruder film frame 255), but he did not recall having any reaction since he thought the noise came from a firecracker.|$|E
5|$|The FIA {{approved}} {{minor changes}} to the layout of the Marina Bay Street Circuit ahead of the Grand Prix. The modifications ran from turn 11 to turn 13; drivers still <b>turned</b> <b>right</b> at turn 11 but it now kinked left slightly on entry, with the track shifting to the left-hand side of Fullerton Road. This changed the profile of turn 12, as drivers now used {{the other side of the}} Anderson Bridge, while the hairpin at turn 13 has been widened by a metre in order to increase overtaking opportunities. The drag reduction system (DRS) had two activation zones for the race; the first between turns five and seven down the length of Raffles Boulevard, and the second on the start/finish straight between turn 23 to turn one.|$|E
5|$|Alonso made a {{complaint}} about Hamilton and asked {{his team to}} work with the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile race director Charlie Whiting to discuss the issue with the safety car. Massa attempted to pass Liuzzi around the outside heading into turn 17 but Liuzzi <b>turned</b> <b>right</b> to defend the position. Shortly afterwards, Massa made a slight mistake which allowed Alguersuari to close the gap. Hamilton started to conserve fuel and prepare for a late attack on lap 20. On the following lap, it was announced Hamilton would be investigated by the stewards for his safety car overtake for which he was given a drive-through penalty which he served on the 27th lap. He remained in second position due to Kobayashi holding {{up the rest of the}} field. Massa placed further pressure upon Liuzzi but was unable to pass him. A glass bottle appeared on the outside of the track on lap 28 which was retrieved by a marshal three laps later to allow racing to continue unaffected. Massa made an error at the final turn on lap 35 which meant he fell behind Liuzzi in the battle for 14th place.|$|E

5|$|The {{first set}} of posted routes in New York were {{assigned}} in 1924. At this time, all of legislative Route20 west of Rochester became part of NY3, a cross-state route that began in North Tonawanda and ended in Plattsburgh. By 1926, NY31 was assigned to an alignment extending from Niagara Falls to Oneida. The route began at NY34 (now NY104) in Niagara Falls and followed College Avenue east to the city line, from where it continued eastward to Rochester on the alignment of legislative Route30. Within the city of Rochester, NY31 continued east on Ridge Road to Lake Avenue, where it turned south to enter downtown Rochester, becoming State Street at Lyell Avenue. At East Main Street, NY31 resumed its eastward alignment, crossing the Genesee River and continuing on Main Street to Monroe Avenue, which, at the time, connected directly with Main Street. NY31 <b>turned</b> <b>right</b> on Monroe Avenue, rejoining its present alignment of NY31 near Union Street.|$|E
5|$|Earnhardt made a {{pit stop}} on lap 244, {{followed}} by Kahne {{on the following}} lap. Edwards gained the lead and maintained it at the lap-252 restart, followed by Earnhardt and Kahne. Five laps later, Kahne passed Edwards to reclaim the lead as they came across slower cars and began to pull away. Debris was located on the track on lap 276, necessitating the race's ninth caution. The leaders elected to make pit stops during the caution. Kahne maintained his lead at the lap-281 restart and pulled away from Earnhardt. Jeff Gordon passed Nemechek to move into fourth place on the following lap. Jeff Gordon's engine failed after he crossed the start-finish line on lap 302, triggering the race's final caution. The leaders, including Kahne, made pit stops for fuel under caution. Johnson led the field at the lap-307 restart, ahead of Kahne, Earnhardt and Burton. Kahne <b>turned</b> <b>right</b> to the track's outside and passed Johnson around the inside in turn one for the lead on the 309th lap. Burton (who felt a vibration from his car) passed Earnhardt to take over third position seven laps later. Kahne increased his advantage over Johnson in the remaining seventeen laps to win the race and became the eighth driver to win both points races at Lowe's Motor Speedway in a calendar year. Johnson finished second, ahead of Burton in third, Earnhardt in fourth and Bobby Labonte in fifth. Kyle Busch, Raines, Edwards, Nemechek, and Vickers rounded out the top ten finishers. The race had a total of ten cautions and thirty-four lead changes by thirteen different drivers. Kahne led eight times {{for a total of}} 134 laps, more than any other competitor. The win was the seventh of Kahne's Cup Series career and the last of a series-high six victories he posted in the 2006 season.|$|E
5|$|Safety {{precautions}} {{were also}} enacted elsewhere in {{and near the}} storm's path; council members and citizens at Moore City Hall − where a council meeting {{was scheduled to be}} held that evening − sheltered in place in the building's first-floor restrooms, away from the multiple large-pane windows at its facade. In downtown Oklahoma City, spectators attending sporting events held that evening involving two of the city's minor league teams – a regular season baseball game between the Oklahoma RedHawks and Memphis Redbirds (which was suspended during the second inning) and Game 2 of the Ray Miron President's Cup series between the Oklahoma City Blazers and the Huntsville Channel Cats – were also evacuated to shelter in an underground storage area connected to the Southwestern Bell Bricktown Ballpark and Myriad Convention Center amid concerns that the storm would jog northward and place Oklahoma City itself in the tornado's path. Flights were grounded at Will Rogers World Airport as the northern edge of the supercell approached the area; the tornado <b>turned</b> <b>right,</b> away from southwestern parts of the city proper, shortly before airport officials began evacuating employees and visitors at the terminals. Traffic on Interstate 35 in south Oklahoma City and north Moore became backed up for several miles, as drivers evacuated from their vehicles to seek shelter under an overpass overlooking South Shields Boulevard.|$|E
