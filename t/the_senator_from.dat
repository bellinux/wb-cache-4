5|$|The Grant administration, who {{recognized}} Morton {{as a powerful}} friend, offered him the position of Minister to Great Britain, replacing John Lothrop Motley, but Morton declined. Because the Indiana General Assembly was controlled by the Democrats, Morton feared a Democrat would be elected to his U.S. Senate seat. In 1874 similar concerns caused him to refuse invitations to accept a nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States. (Later, Grant recalled that concerns over Morton's ill health alone had kept him from proposing Morton for Chief Justice, but Grant may have mistaken. Well-advised sources at the time heard that <b>the</b> <b>Senator</b> <b>from</b> Indiana had been offered {{a place on the}} Supreme Court, unofficially, and Justice David Davis took the credit for convincing Grant that the rigor of the job would cause Morton a physical breakdown).|$|E
5|$|At the convention, held August 5â€“8, Agnew {{abandoned}} his favorite son status, placing Nixon's name in nomination. Nixon narrowly secured the nomination {{on the first}} ballot. In the discussions that followed about a running mate, Nixon kept his counsel while various party factions thought they could influence his choice: Strom Thurmond, <b>the</b> <b>senator</b> <b>from</b> South Carolina, told a party meeting that he held a veto on the vice presidency. It was evident that Nixon wanted a centrist, though there was little enthusiasm when he first proposed Agnew, and other possibilities were discussed. Some party insiders thought that Nixon had privately settled on Agnew early on, and that the consideration of other candidates {{was little more than}} a charade. On August 8, after a final meeting of advisers and party leaders, Nixon declared that Agnew was his choice, and shortly afterwards announced his decision to the press. Delegates formally nominated Agnew for the vice presidency later that day, before adjourning.|$|E

500|$|Bayh {{was criticized}} {{throughout}} {{his campaign for}} being [...] "boring" [...] or [...] "dull," [...] but media outlets also described the candidate as [...] "folksy" [...] and displaying a [...] "Midwest charm," [...] that some compared to President Harry Truman.

The Wall Street Journal lauded the Senator as a [...] "genuinely fiscally conservative Democrat." [...] His record as a governor and Senator were also portrayed as desirable assets.

500|$|Gravel beat Gruening in {{the primary}} in a tight result with a margin of about 2,000 votes. Gruening found [...] "the {{unexpected}} defeat hard to take" [...] and thought that some aspects of his opponent's biographical film had misled viewers. In the general election, Gravel faced Republican Elmer E. Rasmuson, a banker and former mayor of Anchorage. College students in the state implored Gruening to run a write-in campaign as an Independent, but legal battles prevented <b>the</b> <b>senator</b> <b>from</b> getting approval for it until only two weeks were left. A late appearance by anti-war presidential candidate Eugene McCarthy could not offset Gruening's lack of funds and endorsements; meanwhile, Gravel and Rasmuson both saturated local media with their filmed biographies. On November 5, 1968, Gravel won the general election, gaining 45 {{percent of the vote}} against 37 percent for Rasmuson and 18 percent for Gruening.|$|E
500|$|After Obama {{secured the}} nomination, Bayh {{endorsed}} <b>the</b> <b>Senator</b> <b>from</b> Illinois and was {{mentioned as a}} possible running mate. He was included on the initial shortlist, which was then whittled down to four names: Bayh, Senator Joe Biden of Delaware, Governor Tim Kaine of Virginia and Governor Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas. On August 22, the eve of Obama's scheduled unveiling of his running mate, NBC News reported that Bayh and Kaine had been informed {{that they were not}} chosen. Obama opted instead for Biden. Obama's campaign manager David Plouffe later wrote in his book The Audacity to Win, which was published in November 2009, that Bayh had been a [...] "coin toss" [...] away from becoming Obama's running mate. Plouffe and David Axelrod had interviewed the finalists and Plouffe said that Bayh's answers were [...] "substantively close to perfect, if cautiously so." [...] He recalled {{that at the time of}} the interview he thought to himself, [...] "there's no way this guy will color outside the lines... Bayh's up side and down side are probably the closest spread of the three", compared to Biden, who could [...] "reach higher heights but could cause us real pain." [...] As Obama approached a decision, he told Plouffe [...] "it's a coin toss now between Bayh and Biden, but Kaine is still a distinct possibility." [...] On August 17, Obama told Axelrod simply, [...] "I've decided. It's Biden." ...|$|E
500|$|Until the 1960s, the New Jersey Senate had 21 representatives, {{one from}} each county {{regardless}} of population. In {{the wake of}} the 1964 decision by the Supreme Court of the United States in Reynolds v. Sims, establishing the one man, one vote principle that state legislative districts must be approximately equal in size, David Friedland filed suit in New Jersey Supreme Court on behalf of two union leaders, challenging a system under which each county was represented by a single member in the New Jersey Senate. The senate enacted a proposal whereby each senator's vote would be weighted based on the population of the county represented, [...] under which Cape May County's senator would receive one vote while <b>the</b> <b>senator</b> <b>from</b> Essex County would receive 19.1, in direct relation to the ratio of residents between counties. In a decision issued on December 15, 1964, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the weighted voting system as adopted was unconstitutional. The court ordered that interim measures be established for the 1965 legislative elections, in which weighted voting {{could be used as a}} temporary measure, and that the needed constitutional changes to restructure the New Jersey Legislature to be in compliance with [...] "one man, one vote" [...] requirements be in place before elections took place in 1967. The legislature's final decision was to establish 40 districts statewide, each represented by one senator and two assemblymembers, without relation to county boundaries.|$|E

500|$|The Fourteenth Amendment {{provides}} that children {{born in the}} United States become American citizens regardless of the citizenship of their parents. At {{the time of the}} amendment's passage, three Senators, including Trumbull,Mr. Cowan: [...] "I will ask whether it will not have the effect of naturalizing the children of Chinese and Gypsies born in this country?"Mr. Trumbull: [...] "Undoubtedly."...Mr. Trumbull: [...] "I understand that under the naturalization laws the children who are born here of parents who have not been naturalized are citizens. This is the law, as I understand it, at the present time. Is not the child born in this country of German parents a citizen? I am afraid we have got very few citizens in some of the counties of good old Pennsylvania if the children born of German parents are not citizens."Mr. Cowan: [...] "The honorable Senator assumes that which is not the fact. The children of German parents are citizens; but Germans are not Chinese; Germans are not Australians, nor Hottentots, nor anything of the kind. That is the fallacy of his argument."Mr. Trumbull: [...] "If <b>the</b> <b>Senator</b> <b>from</b> Pennsylvania will show me in the law any distinction made between the children of German parents and the children of Asiatic parents, I may be able to appreciate the point which he makes; but the law makes no such distinction; and the child of an Asiatic is just as much of a citizen as the child of a European." [...] the author of the Civil Rights Act, as well as President Andrew Johnson, asserted that both the Civil Rights Act and the Fourteenth Amendment would confer citizenship on such children at birth; however, Senator Edgar Cowan of Pennsylvania had a definitively contrary opinion.Mr. Cowan: [...] "...Therefore I think, before we assert broadly that everybody who shall be born in the United States shall be taken to be citizen of the United States, we ought to exclude others besides Indians not taxed, because I look upon Indians not taxed as being much less dangerous and much less pestiferous to a society than I look upon Gypsies. I do not know how many my honorable friend from California looks upon Chinese, but I do know how some of his fellow citizens regard them. I have no doubt that now they are useful, and I have no doubt that within proper restraints, allowing that State and the other Pacific States to manage them as they may see fit, they may be useful; but I would not tie their hands by the Constitution of the United States so as to prevent them hereafter from dealing with them as in their wisdom they see fit..."Mr. Johnson: [...] "...Who is a citizen of the United States is an open question. The decision of the courts and doctrine of the commentators is, that every man who is a citizen of the State becomes ipso facto a citizen of the United States; but there is no definition as to how citizenship can exist in the United States except through the medium of a citizenship in a State..." [...] These congressional remarks applied to non-citizens lawfully present in the United States, as the problem of unauthorized immigration did not exist in 1866, and some scholars dispute whether the Citizenship Clause applies to unauthorized immigrants, although {{the law of the land}} continues to be based on the standard interpretation. Congress during the 21st century has occasionally discussed revising the clause to reduce the practice of [...] "birth tourism", in which a pregnant foreign national gives birth in the United States for purposes of the child's citizenship.|$|E

For her his tongue is always profuse in words. [...] Let her be impeached in character, or any proposition made to shut her out from the extension of her wantonness, and no extravagance of manner or hardihood of assertion is then too great for this senator.|$|E
