5|$|As {{the files}} {{converge}} {{on the east}} frieze we encounter <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>women</b> celebrants E2–27, E50–51, E53–63.

The next groups E18–23, E43–46, are problematic. Six on the left and four on the right, if one does not count two other figures who may or may not be marshals, then this group might be taken to be the ten eponymous heroes who gave their names to the ten tribes. Their proximity to the deities indicates their importance, but selecting differently, then nine of them may be the archons of the polis or athlothetai officials who managed the procession; there is insufficient iconographic evidence to determine which interpretation is correct.|$|E
