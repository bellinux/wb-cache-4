5|$|Roridula has a {{more complex}} {{relationship}} with its prey. The plants in this genus produce sticky leaves with resin-tipped glands <b>that</b> <b>look</b> {{similar to those of}} larger Drosera. However, the resin, unlike mucilage, is unable to carry digestive enzymes. Therefore, Roridula species do not directly benefit from the insects they catch. Instead, they form a mutualistic symbiosis with species of assassin bugs that eat the trapped insects. The plant benefits from the nutrients in the bugs' feces.|$|E
5|$|Written by David Fisher, {{this story}} was {{discussed}} with Script Editor Douglas Adams in late 1979, shortly before Adams left Doctor Who. It would have featured the Doctor battling the Nephilim, creatures who travel through time in sleeping units <b>that</b> <b>look</b> like sarcophagi. The name Nephilim was drawn from the Old Testament and from various Jewish writings, where it refers {{to a kind of}} demon. New producer Nathan-Turner was not interested and instead The Leisure Hive was developed as the season opener.|$|E

The image was illustrated by Bob Grant and Bob Totten. An alternative theory suggests <b>that</b> <b>Look</b> Mickey and Popeye were enlargements of bubble gum wrappers. This image marked the first of numerous works in which Lichtenstein cropped his source to bring the viewer closer to the scene.|$|E
5|$|In North America, C.violaceus favours conifers, and, though rare {{over much}} of the continent, is {{relatively}} common in certain areas, including Mount Rainier National Park and Olympic National Park. It is more common in old growth forest in the Pacific Northwest, though has sprung up in regrowth areas populated with fir, pine, aspen and alder in the Great Lakes region. Fruit bodies occur singly or in small groups, often near rotting wood, and can grow in fairy rings. Closely related species <b>that</b> <b>look</b> like C.violaceus can be found in Central and South America, Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, and Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|Local {{assemblies}} {{are organized}} into geographical regions. Regional leadership forums are representative bodies consisting of pastors and delegates from each local assembly. Every three years, each forum elects a regional committee from {{among its members}} and a regional leader from among its pastors. The committee acts as an executive and advisory body to the regional leadership forum. Each region is represented by its leader on the National Leadership Forum. Non-geographical regions, {{in the form of}} networks of local churches that share a peculiar ministry philosophy, also exist. These are normally led by the senior pastors of urban mega-churches, who network with a number of local assemblies nationwide <b>that</b> <b>look</b> to them for leadership and mentorship.|$|E

Casting, finding the right cat—just every aspect. Kind of like making a little movie. We basically sat down and just threw out all every idea we could possibly conceive of {{and of all the}} things we wanted. All the imagery we wanted—and I had a few set ideas, for instance the cat and the idea of Metropolis. I definitely wanted to have that influence, <b>that</b> <b>look</b> on all the men—the workers, diligently, methodically working away.|$|E
5|$|Vavilovian mimicry {{presents}} {{an illustration of}} unintentional (or rather 'anti-intentional') selection by man. Weeders {{do not want to}} select weeds and their seeds <b>that</b> <b>look</b> increasingly like cultivated plants, yet there is no other option. For example, the Echinochloa oryzoides plant, a species of grass found as a weed in rice (Oryza sativa) fields, looks similar to rice; its seeds are often mixed in rice and have become difficult to separate through Vavilovian mimicry. Vavilovian mimics may eventually be domesticated themselves, {{as in the case of}} rye in wheat; Vavilov called these weed-crops secondary crops.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of these}} {{hypotheses}} have been discredited or rejected. For example, {{there is no}} hole {{at the end of}} the crest for a snorkeling function. There are no muscle scars for a proboscis and it is dubious that an animal with a beak would need one. As a proposed airlock, it would not have kept out water. The proposed air reservoir would have been insufficient for an animal the size of Parasaurolophus. Other hadrosaurids had large heads without needing large hollow crests to serve as attachment points for supporting ligaments. Also, none of the proposals explain why the crest has such a shape, why other lambeosaurines should have crests <b>that</b> <b>look</b> much different but perform a similar function, how crestless or solid-crested hadrosaurids got along without such capabilities, or why some hadrosaurids had solid crests. These considerations particularly impact hypotheses based on increasing the capabilities of systems already present in the animal, such as the salt gland and olfaction hypotheses, and indicate that these were not primary functions of the crest. Additionally, work on the nasal cavity of lambeosaurines shows that olfactory nerves and corresponding sensory tissue were largely outside the portion of the nasal passages in the crest, so the expansion of the crest had little to do with the sense of smell.|$|E

5|$|Philip Nel {{highlighted}} {{the influence of}} Jane Austen, whom Rowling has greatly admired {{since the age of}} twelve. Both novelists encourage re-reading, because details <b>that</b> <b>look</b> insignificant foreshadow important events or characters much later in the story-line– for example Sirius Black is briefly mentioned near the beginning of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, and then becomes a major character in the third to fifth books. Like Austen's heroines, Harry often has to re-examine his ideas near the ends of books. Some social behaviour in the Harry Potter books is remininiscent of Austen, for example the excited communal reading of letters. Both authors satirise social behaviour and give characters names that express their personalities. However in Nel's opinion Rowling's humour is more based on caricature and the names she invents are more like those found in Charles Dickens's stories, and Amanda Cockrell noted that many of these express their owners' traits through allusions that run from ancient Roman mythology to eighteenth-century German literature. Rowling, like the Narnia series' author C.S. Lewis, thinks there is no rigid distinction between stories for children and for adults. Nel also noted that, like many good writers for children, Rowling combines literary genresfantasy, young adult fiction, boarding school stories, Bildungsroman and many others.|$|E
5|$|The first {{element in}} the scheme of painted {{architecture}} is a definition of the real architectural elements by accentuating the lines where spandrels and pendentives intersect with the curving vault. Michelangelo painted these as decorative courses <b>that</b> <b>look</b> like sculpted stone moldings. These have two repeating motifs, a formula common in Classical architecture. Here, one motif is the acorn, the symbol of the family of both Pope Sixtus IV, who built the chapel, and Pope Julius II, who commissioned Michelangelo's work. The other motif is the scallop shell, one of the symbols of the Madonna, to whose assumption the chapel was dedicated in 1483. The crown of the wall then rises above the spandrels, to a strongly projecting painted cornice that runs right around the ceiling, separating the pictorial areas of the biblical scenes from the figures of Prophets, Sibyls, and Ancestors, who literally and figuratively support the narratives. Ten broad painted crossribs of travertine cross the ceiling and divide it into alternately wide and narrow pictorial spaces, a grid that gives all the figures their defined place.|$|E
5|$|The game {{opens with}} Zidane and the Tantalus Theater Troupe {{attempting}} to kidnap Princess Garnet during her sixteenth birthday celebration {{in the city}} of Alexandria. Upon reaching her, they discover that Garnet, who is concerned about Queen Brahne's increasingly erratic behavior, had planned on escaping the city and is willing to be kidnapped, especially as their employer, Regent Cid of Lindblum, is who she wanted to run to. During the escape from the city, the troupe is joined by Vivi, who is looking to explore, and Steiner, who decides to travel with Garnet for her protection rather than take her back against her will. After the group flees the city and its guards, their damaged airship crashes, and Zidane, Garnet, Vivi, and Steiner travel on together. During their journey to Lindblum, Garnet takes the alias Dagger, and the group discovers a factory in the village of Dali that is manufacturing soulless black mage soldiers <b>that</b> <b>look</b> similar to Vivi.|$|E
