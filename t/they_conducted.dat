5|$|Due to {{concerns}} about the entry of Japan into {{the war in the}} Pacific, the battalion was brought back to Australia in early 1942. Departing Port Tewfik on 9 February on the MV Vernon, the battalion arrived at Port Adelaide, South Australia, on 9 March and moved to Camp Woodside. In early April <b>they</b> <b>conducted</b> a road and rail move to Casino, New South Wales, where a weeks' leave was granted before moving on to Caboolture, Queensland. During this time the battalion undertook defensive duties securing the northern approach to Brisbane during the Battle of the Coral Sea. From June they began jungle training in preparation for deployment to New Guinea in September where the units of the Militia had been fighting a delaying campaign against the Japanese along the Kokoda Track.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the length}} of time it took to build her, Wisconsin missed much of the initial thrust into Japanese-held territory, having arrived {{at a time when the}} reconquest of the Philippines was well underway. As a part of that movement, the {{planners}} had envisioned landings on the southwest coast of Mindoro, south of Luzon. From that point, American forces could threaten Japanese shipping lanes through the South China Sea. In preparation for the coming invasion of Mindoro, Wisconsin was assigned to protect the 3rd Fleet's Fast Carrier Task Force (TF 38), as <b>they</b> <b>conducted</b> air raids at Manila to soften up Japanese positions.|$|E

After concluding the bombardment, Guam returned to the carrier screen while <b>they</b> <b>conducted</b> operations off Nansei Shoto until 11 May. The ship then steamed to Ulithi for periodic maintenance and to replenish ammunition and supplies. She {{then returned}} to Okinawa, assigned to Task Group 38.4 of William Halsey's Third Fleet. She continued to provide anti-aircraft defense for the carriers while they launched fighter sweeps of Kyushu. Guam and Alaska bombarded Oki Daitō {{for an hour and a}} half on 9 June, after which they steamed to San Pedro Bay in the Leyte Gulf, arriving on 13 June.|$|E

5|$|However, retired Colonel Thomas H. Taylor, a {{military}} historian, contended in his 1996 book {{that in spite}} of their original purpose of short range infiltration, the Eighth Army Ranger Company was employed well for the missions <b>they</b> <b>conducted,</b> most of which were reactionary and borne out of a need to rapidly counter North Korean and Chinese attacks. Taylor noted that particularly in their earlier missions, the Rangers had been successful at operating as a night combat force, a skill {{that the rest of the}} U.S. forces in Korea were largely untrained in. Taylor also believed that the Rangers, who were drawn from replacement and occupation units in Japan, effectively gave the 25th Infantry Division an extra force it would not otherwise have possessed, allowing it to employ its conventional forces elsewhere. Taylor praised division commander Major General William B. Kean for his employment of the Rangers, and argued that the successes of the subsequent Ranger companies validated the existence of the Eighth Army Ranger Company.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, {{his team}} at NIMH {{admitted}} {{a patient with}} depression who had observed seasonal changes within himself and thought previous research regarding melatonin release at night {{may be able to}} help him.

The results were published in 1984, officially describing SAD and pioneering light therapy as an effective treatment method. The research on SAD and light therapy is inconclusive and in some ways controversial, as not all researchers agree with Rosenthal's conclusions on the effect of light therapy and at what time of day the light should be administered.|$|E
