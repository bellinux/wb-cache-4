5|$|The {{first pick}} in Toronto Raptors' history was Damon Stoudamire, {{a point guard}} from the University of Arizona, who was the seventh overall pick in the 1995 NBA draft. People in the crowd were {{surprised}} by this pick because they expected the Raptors to pick Ed O'Bannon from UCLA. In their second pick of the same draft, Fab Five member Jimmy King from Michigan was drafted in the second round. The Raptors won the first overall pick in 1996, but they had <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>that</b> up due to the expansion agreement with the league. Chris Bosh was selected by the Raptors as the fourth pick overall in the 2003 NBA draft, {{and he went on}} to play in three all-star games, while starting in two. Andrea Bargnani, who was selected by the Raptors with the first overall pick of the 2006 NBA draft, became the first European to be picked first overall in the NBA draft.|$|E

25|$|Wardell died at his home, Upton Grange, in Edward Street, North Sydney on 19 November 1899 {{of heart}} failure and pleurisy. He is buried in the Catholic section of Gore Hill Cemetery. He did not {{live long enough to}} see the final {{finishing}} touches to St Patrick's Cathedral, and St Mary's Cathedral was far from finished. His legacy to Australia has been <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>that</b> country two cathedrals which rank among the finest modern examples of gothic architecture. St Patrick's Cathedral {{is considered one of the}} few Australian buildings to be of world significance. However, Wardell's work was more than the design of two cathedrals, his work was versatile and skilful in both the Gothic and classical styles and has given both Sydney and Melbourne some of their most distinguished 19th-century buildings.|$|E

25|$|The new Minister Jayewardene saw {{tourism in}} a new {{dimension}} as a great industry capable of earning foreign exchange, providing avenues of mass employment, creating a manpower which commanded a high, employment potential in the world. He was determined to place this industry on a solid foundation providing it a 'conceptional base and institutional support.' This was necessary to bring dynamism and cohesiveness into an industry, shunned by leaders in the past, ignored by investors who were inhibited {{by the lack of}} incentive to invest in projects which were uncertain of a satisfactory return. The new Minister Hon. J. R. Jayewardene considered it essential for the government <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>that</b> assurance and with this objective in view he tabled the Ceylon Tourist Board Act No 10 of 1966 followed by Ceylon Hotels Corporation Act No 14 of 1966.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, {{an open-air}} canopy that protects all fan seating areas {{from the rain}} and heat was constructed. The canopy however, does have a football-field sized hole in the middle, and does not protect the playing field itself from rain. The renovations were {{completed}} by the first Miami Dolphins pre-season home game in September 2016. Previously, since the field runs east–west (rather than north–south {{as is the case}} in most other stadiums), the north stands were exposed to the full force of South Florida's oppressive heat early in the season. The issue became so problematic that Stephen Ross, who owns the Dolphins and the stadium, successfully petitioned the NFL to have all September home games start at 4 pm. Although the heat gave the Dolphins a substantial home-field advantage against opponents unaccustomed to the sweltering heat, Ross was willing <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>that</b> up in order to ensure a more comfortable environment for fans.|$|E

500|$|Bungie {{used the}} beta to fix mistakes, glitches, and balance issues within {{gameplay}} elements. [...] "We needed our fans to provide feedback," [...] said Lehto, adding {{that having a}} large audience to [...] "hammer" [...] on the game allowed them to gather useful feedback to mold the finished product. The game automatically collected statistics such as upload and matchmaking speeds, as well as game preferences; sorting out what Jarrard called [...] "the more subjective anecdotal feedback" [...] from emails, notes, and forums proved more difficult. The Reach beta generated over 360,000 forum posts on Bungie's community forums. Bungie created official threads for groups of issues to manage the high volume of feedback; [...] "We tried {{to give people a}} little bit more of a direct avenue <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>that</b> feedback and to make our lives easier. It was definitely a lot to assess and digest," [...] said Jarrard. Certain feedback from the players did not correlate with the statistical data obtained from the matches during the beta. Chris Carney, lead designer for the multiplayer mode, recalled vocal dissatisfaction with the pistol early in the beta; by the end of the beta, the weapon was responsible for most of the kills coming from newly included weapons in the game. Bungie deployed special test matches to eliminate lurking variables, balance gameplay, and make other informed changes.|$|E
500|$|While at Winchester in 1070, William {{met with}} three papal legates– John Minutus, Peter, and Ermenfrid of Sion– {{who had been}} sent by Pope Alexander. The legates ceremonially crowned William during the Easter court. The {{historian}} David Bates sees this coronation as the ceremonial papal [...] "seal of approval" [...] for William's conquest. The legates and the king then proceeded to hold a series of ecclesiastical councils dedicated to reforming and reorganising the English church. Stigand and his brother, Æthelmær, the Bishop of Elmham, were deposed from their bishoprics. Some of the native abbots were also deposed, both at the council held near Easter and at a further one near Whitsun. The Whitsun council saw the appointment of Lanfranc as the new Archbishop of Canterbury, and Thomas of Bayeux as the new Archbishop of York, to replace Ealdred, {{who had died in}} September 1069. William's half-brother Odo perhaps expected to be appointed to Canterbury, but William probably did not wish <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>that</b> much power to a family member. Another reason for the appointment may have been pressure from the papacy to appoint Lanfranc. Norman clergy were appointed to replace the deposed bishops and abbots, {{and at the end of}} the process, only two native English bishops remained in office, along with several continental prelates appointed by Edward the Confessor. In 1070 William also founded Battle Abbey, a new monastery at the site of the Battle of Hastings, partly as a penance for the deaths in the battle and partly as a memorial to those dead.|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} {{the third}} season of Ellen, {{producers}} were becoming frustrated by the series' lack of focus and the lack of interest that the character Ellen Morgan displayed toward the standard sitcom tropes of dating and relationships. Disney boss Michael Eisner suggested that since the character showed no inclination toward dating, she should get a puppy. [...] "It was an indication of just how lost the show was that network executives would be excited by Ellen buying a puppy", said executive producer Mark Driscoll. It was this suggestion that gave writer Jonathan Stark the idea <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>that</b> working title to the episode, and it stuck. In the summer of 1996 DeGeneres and the show's other writers opened negotiations with ABC and its parent company, Disney, to have Ellen Morgan come out during season four. Word of the secret negotiations leaked in September of that year, sparking a storm of speculation as to whether the character, the actress, or both would come out. The LGBT media watchdog group Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) launched a [...] "Let Ellen Out!" [...] campaign, including an [...] "Ellen Watch" [...] website. Disney rejected the first draft of the script, with Disney executive Dean Valentine stating that it did not go far enough. Director Junger reported that Valentine said [...] "'If we're going to do it, let's do it.' Once he said to go as far as we could, it became great fun to write." [...] Once final approval from Disney was secured, ABC announced on March 3, 1997, that Ellen Morgan would be coming out. [...] "The Puppy Episode" [...] went into production on March 7. Guest stars sought to be a part of the project. According to writer/producer Driscoll, [...] "Suddenly all these talented actors were lining up to be in the episode. It had a buzz around it that it would be an historic episode. When Oprah came on—and she was so wonderful and open and giving—it suddenly had this great weight to it." ...|$|E
