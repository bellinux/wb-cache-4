5|$|In Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. v. Dabit (2005), Sotomayor wrote a {{unanimous}} {{opinion that the}} Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 did not preempt class action claims in state courts by stockbrokers alleging misleading inducement <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>or</b> sell stocks. The Supreme Court handed down an 8–0 decision stating that the Act did preempt such claims, thereby overruling Sotomayor's decision.|$|E

In the early days, the desks served as a relay point between the pits and those wishing <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>or</b> sell.

5|$|Amtrak {{took over}} {{operation}} of most intercity rail passenger {{service in the}} United States on May 1, 1971; up until then such services were run by various private railroads. The private railroads chose to retain their most modern passenger locomotives to operate the various commuter services which, by law, did not pass to Amtrak. To operate these intercity services the company had <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>or</b> lease from the private railroads whatever locomotives remained. This left Amtrak with an aging and mechanically-incompatible fleet of diesel locomotives. The mainstays of Amtrak's road diesel fleet were veteran EMD E8s and EMD E9s, which were all 10–20 years old and due for replacement.|$|E

There is also stepped access to the footbridge from the south, and a ramp down to the southern platform. There is no taxi rank, but there are bus stops on Whiteladies Road. Cycle storage is available on the platform.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{contend that}} a risk parity portfolio requires strong management and continuous oversight {{to reduce the}} potential for negative consequences {{as a result of}} leverage and allocation building in the form of buying and selling of assets to keep dollar holdings at predetermined and equalized risk levels. For example, if the price of a security goes up or down and risk levels remain the same, the risk parity portfolio will be adjusted to keep its dollar exposure constant. On the other hand, some consider risk parity to be a passive approach, because it does not require the portfolio manager <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>or</b> sell securities on the basis of judgments about future market behavior.|$|E

5|$|The forward {{exchange}} rate is {{the rate at which}} a commercial bank is willing to commit to exchange one currency for another at some specified future date. The {{forward exchange}} rate is a type of forward price. It is the exchange rate negotiated today between a bank and a client upon entering into a forward contract agreeing <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>or</b> sell some amount of foreign currency in the future. Multinational corporations and financial institutions often use the forward market to hedge future payables or receivables denominated in a foreign currency against foreign exchange risk by using a forward contract to lock in a {{forward exchange rate}}. Hedging with forward contracts is typically used for larger transactions, while futures contracts are used for smaller transactions. This is due to the customization afforded to banks by forward contracts traded over-the-counter, versus the standardization of futures contracts which are traded on an exchange. Banks typically quote forward rates for major currencies in maturities of one, three, six, nine, or twelve months, however in some cases quotations for greater maturities are available up to five or ten years.|$|E

25|$|Another related {{explanation}} used {{in behavioral}} finance lies in herd behavior, {{the fact that}} investors tend <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>or</b> sell {{in the direction of}} the market trend. This is sometimes helped by technical analysis that tries precisely to detect those trends and follow them, which creates a self-fulfilling prophecy.|$|E
25|$|However, futures {{contracts}} {{also offer}} opportunities for speculation in that a trader who {{predicts that the}} price of an asset will move in a particular direction can contract <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>or</b> sell it in the future at a price which (if the prediction is correct) will yield a profit.|$|E
25|$|The {{difficulty}} lies {{in identifying}} public {{companies that are}} sufficiently comparable to the subject company for this purpose.

25|$|Only one Red Cross {{supply of}} parcels was {{received}} by the prisoners between March 1942 and September 1945. This arrived in March 1944 and worked out at one sixth of a parcel per person: a single tin of food. Prisoners occasionally were able <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>or</b> barter chicks which they raised on worms and beetles and rice sweepings from the quartermaster's store floor (other edible food scraps being too precious to use). If female these provided much-needed eggs.|$|E
25|$|All {{the birds}} killed are {{protected}} species {{and the open}} bill stork is endangered. In India, {{it is illegal to}} trap, sell, hunt, buy or kill any wild bird under the Wildlife Protection Act 1972. The crime is a non-bailable one and anyone convicted of killing a protected bird can be imprisoned for up to seven years and/or fined Rs. 25,000. Under the Act, it is illegal <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>or</b> sell animal parts. They are sold anywhere in the range between for Rs. 300 to Rs. 600 per kilo.|$|E
25|$|Between 1970 and 1989, the {{official}} exchange rate was fixed by the government through law. This exchange rate {{was used by the}} government to calculate the value of foreign trade, but foreign currency was not available to be bought and sold by private individuals. Owning or attempting <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>or</b> sell foreign currency was a criminal offence, punishable with a prison sentence that could go up to 10 years (depending on the amount of foreign currency found under one's possession). International trade was therefore considered as part of another economic circuit than domestic trade, and given greater priority.|$|E

Any such term of assurance in a form supplied by the offeree must be separately signed by the offeror.|$|E
25|$|The strongest {{pressure}} {{took place}} from around 1900 to 1940, when Norway invested considerable money {{and effort to}} wipe out Sami culture. Notably, anyone who wanted <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>or</b> lease state lands for agriculture in Finnmark, had to prove knowledge of the Norwegian language. This also ultimately caused the dislocation in the 1920s, that increased the gap between local Sami groups, something still present today, and sometimes bears the character of an internal Sami ethnic conflict. Another factor was the heavy war destruction in northern Finland and northern Norway in 1944-45, destroying all existing houses and visible traces of Sami culture. After World War II the pressure was relaxed somewhat.|$|E
