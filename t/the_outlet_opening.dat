Many studies on natural ventilation have been performed in the past, however, a detailed {{review of the literature}} indicates that the majority of these studies focused on flat roofs with symmetric opening positions. There is a lack of research that analyzes the impact of asymmetric opening positions and roof inclination on natural ventilation potential. This paper presents Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations to analyze the natural ventilation flow in a generic isolated building with different vertical positions of <b>the</b> <b>outlet</b> <b>opening</b> – yielding asymmetric opening positions – and five different roof inclination angles. The simulations are performed using the 3 D steady Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations.

The results show that the shear-stress transport (SST) k-¿ and the Renormalization-group (RNG) k-e turbulence models provide the best agreement with the experimental data. It is also shown that the roof inclination angle has a significant effect on the ventilation flow; the volume flow rate increases by more than 22 %.

40|$|AbstractDespite {{significant}} {{impacts of}} natural ventilation on atria, indoor thermal conditions and decreasing energy usage load, there {{is lack of}} knowledge about how various design parameters influence atria thermal conditions. The complexity of natural ventilation design of atria and inadequate simulation design tools may lead to inaccurate atria thermal prediction. In the past 25 years, researchers have developed and suggested various methods such as experimental, theoretical and numerical modeling to identify thermal and ventilation performances of atria. However, the diversity of the modeling conditions makes it difficult to achieve proper conclusions which link all contributing parameters to atrium thermal conditions.

These parameters include various atrium configurations and components such as atrium geometry, opening characteristics, roof properties, materials and fenestration characteristics.
