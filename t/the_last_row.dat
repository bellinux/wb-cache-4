5|$|After much discussion, {{the city}} of Munich, the state of Bavaria, Bayern Munich and 1860 Munich jointly decided {{at the end of}} 2000 to build a new stadium. While Bayern had wanted a {{purpose-built}} football stadium for several years, the awarding of the 2006 FIFA World Cup to Germany stimulated the discussion as the Olympiastadion no longer met the FIFA criteria to host a World Cup game. Located on the northern outskirts of Munich, the Allianz Arena has been in use {{since the beginning of the}} 2005–06 season. Its initial capacity of 66,000 fully covered seats has since been increased for matches on national level to 69,901 by transforming 3,000 seats to terracing in a 2:1 ratio. Since August 2012, 2,000 more seats were added in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>row</b> of the top tier increasing the capacity to 71,000. In January 2015, a proposal to increase the capacity was approved by the city council so now Allianz Arena has a capacity of 75,000 (70,000 in Champions League).|$|E

25|$|Come the 1979 Grand Prix and {{the passage}} of two years had made a great {{difference}} {{to the performance of}} the turbocharged Renaults; the car which qualified on <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>row</b> in 1977 was now on the front row beside Alan Jones in the Williams FW07. When Jones's Cosworth expired, his teammate Clay Regazzoni moved into the lead, going on to win from René Arnoux in the Renault RS10 with Jean-Pierre Jarier third in the Tyrrell 009. The winners average speed was 138.80mph.|$|E
25|$|Encouraged {{by these}} results, {{a full season}} with Hesketh was planned for 1976. In the South African Grand Prix he {{qualified}} in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>row</b> and finished 15th. The next races saw him either not qualify at all, or {{at the back of}} the grid, with early retirements due to mechanical failures. Despite not being satisfied with the value the team gave him for the money, he almost scored a point when coming in seventh at the 1976 British Grand Prix, albeit three laps down.|$|E

Each player begins by making an illegal move (although they cannot capture enemy pieces with these illegal moves, and the rules of check and checkmate are still respected), and then normal play begins. Since all pawns are just one step from promotion, they may only promote to captured pieces: if no pieces may be captured, pawns may not move to <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>row.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the French comb the {{slivers of}} wool are fed forward by ratchet-operated rollers and a pinned feed grid, the leading {{end of the}} fibres being pushed beyond the nipper jaws which open and shut to receive and hold them, leaving a fringe of fibres {{protruding}} through which the pins of the revolving cylinder comb pass, removing the short fibres or noil and any impurities. These are carried round to the underside and deposited in a box for removal. Whilst the above initial combing is taking place the drawing-off rollers, mounted on a carriage, move towards the nipper jaws and grip the fringe of fibres as soon as <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>row</b> of pins on the comb cylinder has passed through the fringe projecting from the nipper jaws. As the drawing-off rollers grip the projecting fringe, the intersector comb descends, piercing the fringe of fibres, the nipper jaws open and the fibres are given their second combing by the rotation and recession of the drawing-off rollers pulling the fibres through the pins of the intersector comb and the pins of the feed grid. The combed fibres are then conveyed by the leather apron of the drawing-off rollers to the front rollers of the carriage, down a funnel and through the calender rollers, into a can placed directly underneath.|$|E

25|$|After {{travelling}} to Malaysia for {{the second}} round of the season, Alonso was passed fit to take part in the event after undergoing medical tests at the track. In the season opener, his Ferrari replacement Sebastian Vettel had finished on the podium, whilst McLaren occupied <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>row</b> with huge difficulties with the performance of the car and the new engine package. In spite of this, Alonso stated at the aforementioned press conference that he had no regrets about leaving Ferrari for McLaren, saying that he was no longer content with just podium finishes after 14 years in Formula One and therefore was prepared to take risks in order to win. In the race, Alonso failed to finish after overheating issues with his car's hybrid system. Notably, Vettel won the race, prompting Alonso to once again a couple of weeks later publicly defend his decision saying that it was 'difficult to keep the trust' amid Ferrari's attempts to persuade him the 2015 car was going to be a big improvement. He said that he would only suggest the move was a mistake should Ferrari actually win the title in November. Having been lapped and outside the points in the , Alonso suggested he was just happy to finish the race to gather information about the car. Alonso collided with 2014 teammate Kimi Räikkönen during the first lap of the , sending his car briefly airborne and landing on Räikkönen's sidepod. Both drivers were unhurt and the incident was ruled as a 'race incident' with Räikkönen spinning in front of Alonso due to wheelspin. At the , Alonso managed to score his first point of the season. At the , he finished fifth, his best result since rejoining McLaren. It was also the first time both drivers finished in the points as Jenson Button finished in ninth. However he failed to score any further points in the remainder of the season.|$|E
500|$|The {{first phase}} of the {{construction}} includes approximately 50,805 seats, with the design able to support future expansion of up to 80,000 seats. The 10,000-seat student section is located in the eastern end of the stadium, and the area reserved for the University of Minnesota Marching Band is [...] partitioned from it, situated directly behind the eastern end zone and framed by a backdrop labeled Pride of Minnesota. There are approximately 20,000 seats with permanent chairbacks in the stadium, located between the goal lines in both the upper and lower decks, but all remaining locations have aluminum bench seating with no backs. The stadium also features 1,000 handicap accessible and companion seats, and accessible seating is located throughout the stadium, including in the first row of the first level, <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>row</b> of the first level, and <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>row</b> of the second level. Premium seating includes 37 private suites, 250 indoor club seats, 1,250 outdoor club seats, and 50 loge boxes, along with access to the exclusive [...] climate-controlled DQ Club Room, which offers luxurious amenities to premium-seat ticket holders.|$|E
500|$|Bizarro {{operates}} {{with three}} steel and fiberglass trains. Each train has eight cars that have four seats {{in a single}} row. When the ride was re-themed, the middle two seats of <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>row</b> were removed on each train to install a computer and power module for the on-board audio. This reduced {{the capacity of the}} trains from 32 to 30 riders per train. Each seat on every train has a speaker to the left and right of the rider. A recording of Bizarro, fighting and talking is played {{for the duration of the}} ride. Frequently, while the train is braked, waiting to enter the station platform, riders hear Bizarro chanting his name and [...] "Bizarro #1". For the 2013 season the on-board audio speakers were removed; there was some speculation towards the end of the current (2013) season that the audio equipment would be given to Six Flags America so that the park's stand-up roller coaster Apocalypse could be fitted with an audio track for the 2014 season.|$|E

500|$|Right away, Jackson {{noticed that}} Springsteen {{was a very}} {{particular}} critic of his own concert sound.

He asked Jackson why the sound was not so good far away as it was up close, and if the audio crew could do anything about it. Jackson said, [...] "we can do a lot about it", and worked with Clair Brothers to design a ring of delay loudspeakers positioned closer to the farthest seats to augment the high frequencies lost over distance by sound waves travelling through air. This made the hi-hat sound more [...] "crisp and clean", with higher quality sound in the back row than previously experienced in such large venues. Throughout Jackson's years with him, Springsteen maintained his interest in delivering high quality sound to every seat, and the solutions grew in size and complexity until by 1984 there were eight rings of delays set up for the largest venues.|$|E
