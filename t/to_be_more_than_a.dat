5|$|Gold and Silver {{were first}} {{publicly}} showcased at the 1997 Nintendo SpaceWorld Expo in Japan, becoming {{the most popular}} exhibit at the program. Unlike the previous game in the series, Pokémon Yellow, the new titles were announced <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> small upgrade to Pokémon Red and Blue. Instead, they would feature a new storyline, a new world, and new species of Pokémon. Gold and Silver were designed for the Game Boy Color, allowing them full color support and more detailed sprites. Other additions that were shown included Pokémon breeding, held items, an in-game gadget known as the PokéGear, a real-time internal clock, and backward compatibility with the previous games in the series.|$|E
5|$|It {{may be that}} in {{the mind}} of their self-celebrated Svengali...the Sex Pistols were never meant <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> nine-month wonder, a cheap vehicle for some fast money, a few laughs, a touch of the old épater la bourgeoisie. It may also be that {{in the mind of}} their chief {{terrorist}} and propagandist, anarchist veteran...and Situational artist McLaren, the Sex Pistols were meant to be a force that would set the world on its ear...and finally unite music and politics. The Sex Pistols were all of these things.|$|E
5|$|The {{asteroid}} belt occupies the orbit between Mars and Jupiter, between 2.3 and 3.3AU from the Sun. It {{is thought to}} be remnants from the Solar System's formation that failed to coalesce because of the gravitational interference of Jupiter. The {{asteroid belt}} contains tens of thousands, possibly millions, of objects over one kilometre in diameter. Despite this, the total mass of the asteroid belt is unlikely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> thousandth of that of Earth. The asteroid belt is very sparsely populated; spacecraft routinely pass through without incident.|$|E

5|$|Andrew Graham, {{programmer}} of {{the original}} game, had returned to university after its completion, and David Darling, co-founder of Codemasters, decided {{that they could not}} wait for him to finish his degree. Codemasters approached Peter Williamson of Supersonic Software and had him produce the sequel. Williamson had just completed Cosmic Spacehead and wanted to do something new. It was intended for the sequel to reproduce the feeling {{of the original}} and add as many new features as possible. The original was used for reference, and the code and graphics were produced from the beginning. Williamson explained that it was hoped that they could capture and go beyond that the original game offered, and the game's success was anticipated. Darling wanted it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> mere continuation of the first.|$|E
5|$|From 1886, Worthington {{began to}} acquire public houses, which {{provided}} a captive market for their product. In order to raise capital for this expansion, the firm became {{a public company}} in 1889, and Horace Brown was created joint managing director alongside William Posnette Manners. By this time the company had an annual output of around 200,000 barrels, and employed 470 people. By 1890, the company's bottling operations equalled those of Bass, Guinness, Allsopp and Whitbread. When William Henry Worthington (1826–1894) died he left no direct heirs and was the fourth and final generation of the family to manage Worthington & Co. Horace Brown left the company in 1894 following a dispute with co-manager William Manners. By 1900, 73 per cent of the company's equity was {{in the hands of}} William Posnette Manners (1846–1915), who had joined the company in 1862 as a junior clerk, and under his astute leadership Worthington acquired a reputation for the quality of its bottled pale ales. The company acquired the Burton Brewery Company in 1915. On Manners' death in 1915, control of the company passed to two of his sons, Arthur (1879–1968) and Ernest. Arthur was the architect of the merger with archrival Bass in 1927, and proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> match for John Gretton, 1st Baron Gretton, the chairman of the much larger Bass. Despite Bass's superior capitalization, the terms of the merger were such that Manners became chairman and joint managing director of Worthington, and deputy chairman and joint managing director of Bass. The amalgamation, described as 'the biggest non-merger {{in the history of the}} brewing industry', failed to realize its objectives. Apart from greater co-operation in bottled beer production and distribution, there were few economies and the two companies continued to operate as separate entities. Both boards were increasingly dominated by Manners and his family.|$|E

Van Gaal saw that his number two had the promise <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> skilled assistant. He let Mourinho develop his own independent coaching style and entrusted him with the coaching duties of Barcelona B.

25|$|The CIS has few {{supranational}} powers but aims <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> purely symbolic organization, nominally possessing coordinating {{powers in}} the realms of trade, finance, lawmaking, and security. It has also promoted cooperation on cross-border crime prevention. Furthermore, eight of the nine CIS member states participate in the CIS Free Trade Area. Three organizations are under the overview of the CIS, namely the Collective Security Treaty Organization, the Eurasian Economic Union (alongside subdivisions, the Eurasian Customs Union and the Eurasian Economic Space, which comprises territory inhabited by over 180 million people), and the Union State. While {{the first and the}} second are military and economic alliances, the third aims to reach a supranational union of Russia and Belarus with a common government, flag, currency, etc.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{also considered}} {{how to make}} the dog believable because, according to Gatiss, audiences always find the dog disappointing in the adaptations. Therefore, Gatiss wanted the solution <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> [...] "dog with luminous paint". In one scene, Henry has an hallucination in his home, wherein the hound sets off the bright security lights in his back garden. That scene is apparently based on the experience of co-creator Steven Moffat and his executive producer and wife Sue Vertue, who also have bright security lights and are frequently startled whenever the lights turn on at night.|$|E

500|$|The {{production}} team intended Karas <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> mere henshin (transforming) hero. Unlike the vengeful protagonist in Mazinger Z, {{the hero of}} Karas embodies {{the spirit of the}} city, and acts for the city's interest instead of his own. Screenwriter Shin Yoshida sets up a dualism of this idea in the form of two Karas characters; one who believes events are leading to a revolution, and the other viewing them as simply the passing of an era. Manga Entertainment also promoted the hero in Karas as [...] "a cross between a cyberpunk version of the Crow and Batman".|$|E
500|$|Champollion's {{decipherment}} remained controversial {{even after}} his death. The brothers Alexander and Wilhelm von Humboldt famously championed his decipherment, as did Silvestre de Sacy, but others, such as Gustav Seyffarth, Julius Klaproth and Edmé-François Jomard sided with Young and refused to consider Champollion <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> talented imitator of Young even after the posthumous publication of his grammar. In England, Sir George Lewis still maintained 40 years after the decipherment, that since the Egyptian language was extinct, it was a priori impossible to decipher the Hieroglyphs. In a reply to Lewis' scathing critique, Reginald Poole, an egyptologist, defended Champollion's method describing it as [...] "the method of interpreting Hieroglyphics originated by Dr. Young and developed by Champollion". Also Sir Peter Le Page Renouf defended Champollion's method, although he was less deferential to Young.|$|E
500|$|A {{group of}} trappers led by {{mountain}} man Joseph Reddeford Walker {{may have seen}} Yosemite Valley {{in the autumn of}} 1833. Walker approached a valley rim as he led his party across the Sierra Nevada, but he did not enter it. A member of the group, Zenas Leonard, wrote in his journal that streams from the valley rim dropped [...] "from one lofty precipice to another, until they are exhausted in rain below. Some of these precipices appeared to us <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> mile high." [...] The Walker party probably visited either the Tuolumne or Merced Groves of giant sequoia, becoming the first non-indigenous people to see the giant trees, but journals relating to the Walker party were destroyed in 1839, in a print shop fire in Philadelphia.|$|E

In another way, others called it [...] "juvenile". Critics praised the degree of customization options, [...] and had mixed views of the array of activities, but found Professor Genki's Super Ethical Reality Climax a high point. Some found the game's ironic sexism to verge on misogyny, and that its other humor sometimes fell flat. Several critics referred to the game as the perfection of the Saints Row formula It was a nominee for Best Narrative at the 2012 Game Developers Conference, an IGN Editor's Choice, and a recipient of perfect scores from GamesRadar and G4.|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stone writer Christian Hoard {{summarized}} {{the record and}} the mixed reviews simply as [...] "DeLonge yanks heartstrings with so-so results" [...] and saw the atmospheric elements as excessive. Spin had a similar sentiment: [...] "Here, his three sidemen elevate [...] emo tendencies to something grander and more timelessly romantic—though somewhat less exciting. Blender scrunitized {{the composition of the}} album as it contains the [...] "duller" [...] aspects of Blink-182 accompanied with U2-influenced guitar chimes.Many critics arraigned the album to be pretentious and contrasted Angels & Airwaves with Blink-182. The A.V. Club journalist Kyle Ryan described his experience with We Don't Need to Whisper as 50 minutes of DeLonge demonstrating his musical skills. English magazine Uncut discerned his departure from Blink-182 and the album's serious tone. AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the differences in musical style between both bands, but remained polarized about the album and commented that [...] "It may not make for a successful record, but it does make for an interesting one, particularly in how DeLonge's desire to be taken seriously has led him to use the serious music of his adolescence as a signifier that he's serious now, but We Don't Need to Whisper is too doggedly dour and amorphous <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> curiosity."The album sold 127,000 copies its first week, and was certified Gold by the RIAA. It was nominated for an MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist in a Video, Best Special Effects in a Video and Best Editing in a Video for [...] "The Adventure," [...] as well as Best Band of 2006 for We Don't Need to Whisper.|$|E
