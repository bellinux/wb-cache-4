40|$|In an in vivo {{crossover}} trial, {{we compared}} a cellulosic with a synthetic dialyzer {{with respect to}} polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) function and apoptosis, cytokine serum levels and synthesis by {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC), and complement activation. Twenty hemodialysis (HD) patients were assigned in alternate order to HD with cellulose acetate (CA) or polysulfone (PS) dialyzer. After 2 weeks, patients were crossed over to <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>dialyzer</b> and treated for another 2 weeks. Apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry in freshly isolated PMN. Phagocytosis and production of peroxide by PMN were studied by flow cytometry in whole blood. PBMC were isolated from blood samples and incubated for 24 h with or without lipopolysaccharide (LPS). There was no impact of dialyzer biocompatibility on PMN apoptosis and function, cytokine synthesis by PBMC or on their serum levels, serum levels of C 3 a, and terminal complement complex (TCC). Nevertheless, after HD, serum levels of complement correlated negatively with PMN phagocytosis and peroxide production, and positively with PMN apoptosis and cytokine production by PBMC. Although the results did not show a dialyzer advantage on the immunologic parameters, complement activation may have modulated cell function and apoptosis after HD.

40|$|Impact of {{dialyzer}} membrane selection on cellular {{responses in}} {{acute renal failure}}: A crossover study. BackgroundWhen acute renal failure (ARF) is severe enough to require dialysis, in-hospital mortality rates approach 60 %. These alarming figures have been ascribed in part to advanced age and the high prevalence of comorbid conditions. In the past several years, a number of {{attempts have been made}} to investigate the impact of dialyzer membrane type on clinical outcomes. Unfortunately, to date, clinical studies addressing this question have reported conflicting results. MethodsThis crossover study examined the effect of dialyzer membrane type on cytokine synthesis by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), superoxide release by neutrophils, and apoptosis or programmed cell death of neutrophils in 24 patients with ARF requiring intermittent hemodialysis. The patients were assigned in an alternate order to a low-flux cellulose acetate (CA) or polysulfone (PS) dialyzer. After three consecutive dialysis sessions, patients were crossed over to <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>dialyzer</b> for three additional treatments. These cellular responses were measured upon dialyzer assignment and at the third and sixth dialysis session in relationship to the dialyzer type. ResultsThe results of the study showed no impact of dialyzer biocompatibility on synthesis of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) or interleukin 10 (IL- 10) by PBMCs, superoxide release by neutrophils, or neutrophil apoptosis. This held true regardless of the initial dialyzer assignment. Furthermore, there was no correlation between dialysis adequacy (measured by single-pool Kt/V) and postdialysis cellular responses. ConclusionsIn summary, this study refines the question of biocompatibility by comparing a substituted cellulose rather than unsubstituted cellulose dialyzer to a PS dialyzer in the setting of ARF. The results failed to demonstrate a dialyzer advantage on the selected cellular responses...|$|E
