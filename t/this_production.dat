5|$|Giselle {{was mounted}} by other ballet {{companies}} in Europe and America {{almost immediately after}} its first night. The British had their first taste of Giselle with a drama based on the ballet called Giselle, or The Phantom Night Dancers by William Moncrieff, who had seen the ballet in Paris the same year. The play was performed on 23 August 1841 at the Theatre Royal, Sadler's Wells. The actual ballet was first staged in London at Her Majesty's Theatre on 12 March 1842 with Grisi as Giselle and Perrot as Albrecht. The dances were credited to Perrot and one Deshayes. <b>This</b> <b>production</b> was revived many times, once in 1884 with a Mlle. Sismondi {{in the role of}} Albrecht. <b>This</b> <b>production,</b> preceded by an operetta called Pocahontas, met with little enthusiasm.|$|E
5|$|Giselle was {{performed}} in Paris from its debut in 1841 to 1849, with Grisi always dancing the title role. In 1849, it was dropped from the repertoire. The ballet was revived in 1852 and 1853, without Grisi, then dropped from the repertoire after 1853. It was revived in 1863 for a Russian ballerina, then dropped again in 1868. It was revived almost 50 years later in 1924 for the debut of Olga Spessivtzeva. <b>This</b> <b>production</b> was revived in 1932 and 1938.|$|E

The New York Times review of Adler's performance was not favorable: in particular his naturalistic acting style was not what audiences of the period expected in a production of Shakespeare. Some other reviews (such as that in Theater magazine) were friendlier; in any event the same production was revived two years later.|$|E

Only a few lines of Ol' Man River were heard, sung by a chorus.
