Most of the <b>tobacco</b> <b>planters</b> in these areas would not use the proper PPE during the application of pesticides.

25|$|The rural tier {{has been}} the focus of orchestrated efforts by {{residents}} and county government to preserve its rural character and environmental integrity. Under the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission (M-NCPPC), Patuxent River Park is the largest natural preserve and provides public access for birdwatching and viewing the rural tier's natural waterfront vistas. In season, the park's Jug Bay Natural Area and the Patuxent Riverkeeper in Queen Anne both offer canoeing and kayaking rentals on the Patuxent. The county's largest collection of <b>tobacco</b> <b>planter</b> mansions and preserved homes are in the rural tier, some managed by the M-NCPPC. Many rural tier roads have scenic highway preservation status; a fall drive yields exceptional beauty along the Patuxent valley's Leeland Road, Croom Road, Clagett's Landing Rd., Mill Branch Rd., Queen Anne Rd., and Brandywine Rd. Walking access along roads in this area is very limited, because most property along the roads remains in private ownership. However, walking is much more accessible in the widespread M-NCPPC lands and trails and state holdings in the Patuxent valley, such as Merkle Wildlife Sanctuary and Rosaryville State Park, both popular among hikers and mountain bikers.|$|E

50|$|In contrast, <b>tobacco</b> <b>planters</b> desired skilled male slaves, {{while women}} were mainly {{responsible}} for breeding and raising children. Family members were often estranged when {{women and children}} left to seek other work. Individual life expectancies for tobacco slaves were generally longer because their unique skills, honed {{over the course of}} many years in the field, proved indispensable to a <b>planter’s</b> success. <b>Tobacco</b> <b>planters</b> favored a technique called “ganging”, where groups of eight to twelve slaves worked fields simultaneously under the supervision of a white superior or a tenured slave. The hardest working slaves, called “pace-setters”, were spread amongst the different groups as an example for those around them. Unlike tasking, ganging was amenable to supervision and quality control, and lacked an inherent measure of individual effort.|$|R
