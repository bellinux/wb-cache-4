5|$|Any {{baseball}} game involves {{one or more}} umpires, who make rulings {{on the outcome of}} each play. At a minimum, one umpire will stand behind the catcher, to have {{a good view of the}} strike zone, and call balls and strikes. Additional umpires may be stationed near the other bases, thus making it easier to judge plays such as attempted force outs and tag outs. In Major League Baseball, four umpires are used for each game, one near each base. In the playoffs, six umpires are used: one at each base and <b>two</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> outfield along the foul lines.|$|E

The boundaries for each zone are determined by major state trunkline highways on each peninsula. Each highway is given a designation composed of the zone letter followed by a two-digit number. Within the zone, numbers are assigned on a grid system: north–south highways use odd numbers and east–west highways have even numbers. Lower numbers are used to the south or west sides of the zones.|$|E
