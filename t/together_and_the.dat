5|$|Based on observations, Iridomyrmex {{workers can}} be {{deformed}} {{when they are}} born. For example, a captured specimen had its propodeum and gaster fused <b>together,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> petiole was still present but enlarged. Despite the deformity, the worker {{was still able to}} forage with little trouble.|$|E
5|$|Like other abelisaurids, the hindlimbs were stocky {{and short}} {{compared}} to body length. The tibia (lower leg bone) of Majungasaurus was even stockier {{than that of}} its relative Carnotaurus, with a prominent crest on the knee. The astragalus and calcaneum (ankle bones) were fused <b>together,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> feet bore three functional digits, with a smaller first digit that did not contact the ground.|$|E
5|$|Tessa is MacLeod's mortal {{companion}} and bears {{the consequences of}} his immortality. These include her aging while he does not, the impossibility of having children <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> dangers of MacLeod's involvement in the Game, an ongoing battle in which all Immortals must behead each other until a single victor remains. Fully aware of this situation, Tessa stays with MacLeod, demonstrating her courage, understanding, generosity and compassion.|$|E

5|$|The final {{competition}} {{is the team}} classification. On each stage, each team is awarded a time based on the cumulative time of its top three riders.

There is no jersey awarded for this classification.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth stage}} was run without the {{incidents}} that plagued {{the first three}} stages.

5|$|Absent Miyamoto's direction, the {{development}} team used elements new and {{inconsistent with the}} series as Super Mario Land shrunk elements of the series to fit the portable device's small screen. Yokoi, the head of R, served as producer, and Satoru Okada served as director. They had previously developed Metroid (1986) and Kid Icarus (1986) <b>together,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> two subsequently designed the Game Boy—Yokoi on its industrial design, and Okada on its engineering. Their Super Mario Land was planned as the portable console's showcase title until Henk Rogers brought Tetris to Nintendo of America and convinced Minoru Arakawa that the addictive computer game would help Nintendo reach the largest audience. The company subsequently chose to bundle Tetris with every Game Boy purchase.|$|E

5|$|After {{leaving the}} White House, the Pierces {{remained}} in Washington {{for more than}} two months, staying with former Secretary of State Marcy. Buchanan altered course from the Pierce administration, replacing all of his appointees. The Pierces eventually moved to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where Pierce had begun to speculate in property. Seeking warmer weather, he and Jane spent the next three years traveling, beginning with a stay in Madeira and followed by tours of Europe and the Bahamas. In Rome, he visited Nathaniel Hawthorne; the two men spent much time <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> author found the retired president as buoyant as ever.|$|E
5|$|Another source from 684 AD, {{during the}} Tang dynasty and {{recorded}} in Li Shizhen's Compendium of Materia Medica, states {{that when the}} leaves are taken internally, they make one incoherent and sleepy, while when used externally they can be effectively used to treat boils, abscesses and itches. Yet another recipe recorded by Li uses the leaves to treat baldness. This formula calls for young leaves of ailanthus, catalpa and peach tree to be crushed <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> resulting liquid applied to the scalp to stimulate hair growth.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{gripped the}} bat very {{low on the}} handle and bent over so far in his stance that the {{knuckles}} {{of his right hand}} were level with his knees. He stood with his heels almost <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> toes of his left foot pointing toward extra cover, which left him open-chested when facing the bowler. A noticeable flourish in his backlift enabled him to follow the swinging delivery and play it late if necessary. His first movement was back and across the crease to cover the stumps from the view of the bowler, putting him in position to play the hook, leg glance, sweep and his favourite square cut shot.|$|E

5|$|Blount {{entered his}} junior year at Oregon sharing the running back role with senior Jeremiah Johnson. The two backs lived <b>together,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> talkative Johnson advised Blount in his first Pac-10 season. For Blount, {{it was the first}} season in which he split time with another running back, and his {{reaction}} was mixed. The two backs each contributed nearly 100 yards and three touchdowns in an early 63–14 win over the Washington State Cougars, and both again performed well in a late season victory over the Oregon State Beavers. However, Blount would record lackluster performances in games against USC and Cal. Overall, Blount rushed for 17 touchdowns, setting a single-season school record, and 1,002 yards. Blount and Johnson became only the second duo in team history to both clear 1,000 rushing yards in the same season; Johnson led the team with 1,201 yards.|$|E
5|$|During the present, the man apologizes to {{his lover}} {{and they are}} reconciled. In another flashback, he attacks someone who plays pool with his lover. Eminem joins Rihanna {{in front of the}} burning house for the final verse. Meanwhile, after the flashback, the woman comes home and locks herself in the {{bathroom}} to stop her abusive lover from entering. In another scene, the fire on her palms vanishes as she clasps her hands. Flames later engulf Eminem and the couple, who are then shown fighting in front of the burning house. In the end, the couple stays <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> video returns to their first scene, in which they sleep.|$|E
5|$|Early {{forms of}} {{xylophone}} {{such as the}} atranatrana are found throughout the island and {{are believed to have}} come across with the original Indonesian settlers. The earliest of these is played uniquely by a pair of women, one of whom sits with her legs outstretched <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bars of the xylophone resting across her legs rather than on a separate resonator box. Each woman strikes the atranatrana with a pair of sticks, one keeping the beat while the second plays a melody. The xylophone bars range from five to seven in number and are made of differing lengths of a rot-resistant wood called hazomalagny. A similar xylophone called katiboky is still played in the southwest among the Vezo and Bara ethnic groups.|$|E

5|$|Glorious carried four BL 15-inch (381mm) Mark I guns in two twin-gun turrets, {{one each}} fore ('A') and aft ('Y'). Her {{secondary}} armament was 18 BL 4-inch (102mm) Mark IX guns mounted in six triple mounts. These mounts had the three breeches too close <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> 23 loaders tended {{to interfere with}} one another. This negated the mount's intended high rate of fire against torpedo boats and other smaller craft. A pair of QF 3-inch (76mm) 20 cwt anti-aircraft guns were fitted abreast of the mainmast on Glorious. She mounted two submerged tubes for 21-inch torpedoes and 10 torpedoes were carried.|$|E
5|$|In 1673, the Duke of York's {{conversion}} to Catholicism became public, and {{he married a}} Catholic princess, Mary of Modena, who was only {{six and a half}} years older than Anne. Charles II had no legitimate children, and so the Duke of York was next in the line of succession, followed by his two surviving daughters from his first marriage, Mary and Anne—as long as he had no son. Over the next ten years, the new Duchess of York had ten children, but all were either stillborn or died in infancy, leaving Mary and Anne second and third in the line of succession after their father. There is every indication that, throughout Anne's early life, she and her stepmother got on well <b>together,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Duke of York was a conscientious and loving father.|$|E

5|$|On 30 May 2010—the fifth {{anniversary of}} Holloway's disappearance—Stephany Tatiana Flores Ramírez, 21, {{died at the}} Hotel TAC, in the Miraflores District of Lima, Peru. On 2 June, a hotel {{employee}} found her beaten body in Room 309, which had been registered in Van der Sloot's name. He had departed from the hotel without returning the room key and left the television running. A tennis racquet, identified by the coroner as a possible homicide weapon, was recovered from the room. A hotel guest and an employee came forward to say they saw Van der Sloot and the victim entering the hotel room <b>together,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> police obtained video of the two playing cards {{at the same table}} the night before at the Atlantic City Casino in Lima. Van der Sloot had entered Peru via Colombia on 14 May 2010 to attend the Latin American Poker Tour.|$|E

Smith's directorial debut, the short film Cargese, was aired on Sky Arts in May 2013. Smith had a supporting role, as the embodiment of Skynet, in Terminator Genisys (2015); he is set to have more screen time in the sixth and seventh films in the series. On 20 November 2014, it was announced that Smith will star in the action-thriller film Patient Zero.|$|E
5|$|Some of the city's necessities such as coal {{arrived by}} barge, but most came by road. Carts, carriages, horses and {{pedestrians}} were crowded <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> gateways {{in the wall}} formed bottlenecks through which {{it was difficult to}} progress. The nineteen-arch London Bridge was even more congested. The better-off used hackney carriages and sedan chairs to get to their destinations without getting filthy. The poor walked, and might be splashed by the wheeled vehicles and drenched by slops being thrown out and water falling from the overhanging roofs. Another hazard was the choking black smoke belching forth from factories which made soap, from breweries and iron smelters and from about 15,000 houses burning coal.|$|E
