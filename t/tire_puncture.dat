The #82 Risi Competizione Ferrari was quickly {{recovering}} from its penalty and at just over two hours was right behind the class leading Corvettes. The class lead was swapped several times until the #82 Ferrari suffered a gearbox failure and would not emerge again. The #63 Corvette suffered reliability issues at night, while the #64 Corvette was in the GT2 lead, running a full two laps ahead of the Felbermayr-Proton Porsche. With less than seven hours to go the #64 lost grip and spun in the Porsche Curves as the #1 Peugeot with Anthony Davidson at the wheel was lapping the Corvette. Emmanuel Collard managed to bring the car back to the pits but subsequent repairs cost them ten laps and soon engine failure followed on the Corvette. Team Felbermayr-Proton took the GT2 lead and a very consistent run saw the team holding onto the lead until the finish. They won the LMGT2 category for Porsche, their first since their [...] win. The drivers had claimed that their car was about half a second off the Ferrari and Corvette's pace.|$|E

50|$|Throughout {{the race}} the GT-Ones battled {{for the lead}} with BMW and Mercedes, having it switch {{multiple}} times amongst the top competitors. Unfortunately the GT-One was hampered by higher fuel consumption (1 or 2 laps less per stint than BMW) and by failures of its Michelin tires throughout the race, mostly caused by sharp gravel which had been accidentally brought onto the racing surface by other cars. The design of the GT-One's wheel wells allowed for a blown tire to cause extensive damage to the mechanical linkages inside. Thus after only 90 laps the first GT-One was lost when it suffered an explosive <b>tire</b> <b>puncture</b> and was damaged beyond repair, unable {{to return to the}} pits and abandoned on the track. Halfway into the event, another GT-One was lost in a <b>tire</b> <b>puncture</b> that led to a high speed accident, destroying the car. This left the team with only car #3, which was still running {{at the top of the}} field. At this point a large amount of the competition had been eliminated, with all Mercedes out of the race due to their famous accident and withdrawal. Audi had also lost two of their four cars, and Nissan had lost their factory backed R391, although an older Courage C52 campaigned by the team was still active.
