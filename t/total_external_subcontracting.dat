40|$|Mention {{indicators}} {{have frequently}} {{been used in}} Webometric studies because they provide {{a powerful tool for}} determining the degree of visibility and impact of web resources. Among mention indicators, hypertextual links were a central part of many studies until Yahoo discontinued the linkdomain command in 2011. Selective links constitute a variant of external links where both the source and target of the link can be selected. This paper intends to study the influence of social platforms (measured through the number of selective external links) on academic environments, in order to ascertain both the percentage that they constitute and whether some of them can be used as substitutes of <b>total</b> <b>external</b> links. For this purpose, 141 URLs belonging to 76 Spanish universities were compiled in 2010 (before Yahoo! stopped their link services), and the number of links from 13 selected social platforms to these universities were calculated. Results confirm a good correlation between <b>total</b> <b>external</b> links and links that come from social platforms, with the exception of some applications (such as Digg and Technorati). For those universities with a higher number of <b>total</b> <b>external</b> links, the high correlation is only maintained on Delicious and Wikipedia, which can be utilized as substitutes of <b>total</b> <b>external</b> links in the context analyzed.

40|$|The main {{purposes}} of this study were to investigate the acute effects of static and dynamic lower limb stretching routines: (a) on peak torque, <b>total</b> <b>external</b> work and joint angle at peak torque of the hamstrings during maximal eccentric isokinetic leg flexion; (b) on unilateral hamstring to quadriceps (H/Q) strength ratios; as well as (c) to determine whether static and dynamic routines elicit similar responses. A total of 49 active adults completed the following intervention protocols in a randomised order on separate days: (a) non-stretching (control condition), (b) static stretching, and (c) dynamic stretching. After the stretching or control intervention, eccentric isokinetic peak torque, the angle of peak torque and <b>total</b> <b>external</b> work were assessed with participants prone at 1. 04 and 3. 14 rad · s(- 1). Unilateral strength ratios of the knee were also recorded. Measures were compared via a fully-within-groups factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA). There were no main effects for eccentric isokinetic peak torque, angle of peak torque, <b>total</b> <b>external</b> work and unilateral H/Q strength ratios. The results suggest that dynamic and static stretching has no influence on eccentric strength profile and unilateral H/Q strength ratios and hence both forms of stretching do not reduce these two primary risk factors for muscle injury...|$|R

40|$|I g 63. -From records {{obtained}} from a triple accelerometer applied to {{the trunk of a}} subject the displacements of the trunk in vertical, forward, and lateral directions have been calculated. With motion pictures taken simultaneously, dis-placements of the center of gravity within the body were measured. From these data the external mechanical work of walking was calculated. The sum of work for vertical and for forward displacements of the center of gravity of the body gives the <b>total</b> <b>external</b> work; energy for the lateral displacements was negligible. <b>Total</b> <b>external</b> work appears to be lower than that calculated from the vertical displacements alone, because work done in lifting is partly sustained by the inertial force of the forward-moving body. <b>Total</b> <b>external</b> work reaches a highest value (0. 1 kcal/km kg) at the most economical speed of walking, 4 km/hr, which corresponds to an energy con-sumption of 0. 48 kcal/km kg. At this speed the internal work appears negligible; it amounts to appreciable entities at very low speeds because of the static contractions of the muscles, and at high speeds because of considerable stiffening of the limbs and movements not involving a displacement of the center of gravity.

30|$|Overburden {{pressure}} (total vertical stress, <b>total</b> <b>external</b> pressure, lithostatic pressure, geostatic load) originates {{from the}} combined weight of formation matrix and the fluid in the pore spaces overlying {{the formation of}} interest. Skeleton pressure (matrix stress, grain-to-grain pressure, vertical effective stress, frame pressure) of a rock is the <b>total</b> <b>external</b> pressure less the fluid pressure. The elastic parameters of the skeleton increase as the skeleton pressure increases, and a corresponding increase in velocity is observed. The increase in elastic parameters is attributable to the reactions at the intergranular contacts and {{the closure of the}} microcracks as the skeleton pressure increases. Hence, when both overburden pressure and formation fluid pressure are varied, only {{the difference between the two}} has a significant influence on velocity. When the skeleton pressure is increased, the velocity increases; when the difference remains constant, the velocity remains constant (Gardner et al. 1974).|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test if the {{critical}} power model can be used to determine the critical rest interval (CRI) between vertical jumps. Ten males performed intermittent countermovement jumps on a force platform with different resting periods (4. 1 +/- 0. 3 s, 5. 0 +/- 0. 4 s, 5. 9 +/- 0. 6 s). Jump trials were interrupted when participants could no longer maintain 95 % of their maximal jump height. After interruption, number of jumps, total exercise duration and <b>total</b> <b>external</b> work were computed. Time to exhaustion (s) and <b>total</b> <b>external</b> work (J) were used to solve the equation Work = a + b. time. The CRI (corresponding to the shortest resting interval that allowed jump height to be maintained for a long time without fatigue) was determined dividing the average external work needed to jump at a fixed height (J) by b parameter (J/s). in the final session, participants jumped at their calculated CRI. A high coefficient of determination (0. 995 +/- 0. 007) and the CRI (7. 5 +/- 1. 6 s) were obtained. In addition, the longer the resting period, the greater the number of jumps (44 13, 71 28, 105 30, 169 53 jumps; p< 0. 0001), time to exhaustion (179 +/- 50, 351 +/- 120, 610 +/- 141, 1, 282 +/- 417 s; p< 0. 0001) and <b>total</b> <b>external</b> work (28. 0 +/- 8. 3, 45. 0 +/- 16. 6, 67. 6 +/- 17. 8, 111. 9 +/- 34. 6 kJ; p< 0. 0001).
