5|$|Going into <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>round</b> <b>of</b> games, {{both teams}} were equal on points with Spain, with Scotland ahead {{thanks to a}} {{superior}} goal difference; however, Spain's final game at home to Iceland {{was scheduled to be}} played two weeks after Wales and Scotland had played each other. With this in mind, a draw for Scotland would be sufficient to virtually guarantee second place in Group 7 and advance at the very least through to the two legged play-off against the winner of the Oceania qualifying tournament, while a win would likely see them top the group and qualify automatically. For Wales, anything less than a win would virtually end their hopes of qualification.|$|E
