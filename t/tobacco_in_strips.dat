50|$|In the English-speaking world, the use {{of tobacco}} in {{cigarette}} form became increasingly widespread {{during and after the}} Crimean War, when British soldiers began emulating their Ottoman Turkish comrades and Russian enemies, who had begun rolling and smoking <b>tobacco</b> <b>in</b> <b>strips</b> of old newspaper for lack of proper cigar-rolling leaf. This was helped by the development of tobaccos suitable for cigarette use, and by the development of the Egyptian cigarette export industry.|$|E

5000|$|Pouches hold {{fine cut}} or snuff <b>tobacco</b> <b>in</b> a small, teabag-like pouch. They are {{initially}} less messy because the tobacco won't {{fall out of}} the user's fingers and mouth. Dipping <b>tobacco</b> <b>in</b> pouches resemble snus [...] "portions", but the difference between these two products lies in the way the tobacco is processed. Dipping tobacco (including pouched products) undergoes fermentation, whereas <b>tobacco</b> <b>in</b> snus is pasteurized. In addition to regular sized pouches, smaller sized pouches, known as Bandits, are also available in the Skoal brand, Grizzly brand, and Copenhagen brand.|$|R

40|$|What are Molds? Molds are fungi (plural of the Latin word fungus), {{and are a}} large {{class of}} living organisms, one of the “kingdoms ” into which {{biologists}} categorize life. They are not plants, animals, or bacteria[1]. Molds are found nearly everywhere, even <b>in</b> <b>tobacco</b> <b>stripping</b> rooms, and their spores are in the air or carried by airborne dusts. Weather conditions this year have been favorable {{to the growth of}} blue mold on tobacco. This has raised a concern about inhaling mold during the stripping process, but blue mold itself requires living tissue for sporulation (giving off spores) and would not be active on cured tobacco. Conditions have also been favorable for other molds, however, and the molds we’ll see most commonly on cured tobacco would be species of Penicillium and Aspergillus, as well as some Mucor and Rhizopus. Some mold is likely present on cured tobacco every year, however this year the weather conditions during curing have been particularly favorable for molds. When the cured tobacco is taken down and stripped, the shaking and movement of the leaves can release large amounts of dust and mold spores. In an enclosed barn or stripping room, the dust and mold can become concentrated creating greater health risks for farmers and their workers. Should You Be Concerned About Molds? Molds can produce large quantities of spores that can easily become airborne and/or attach to dusts, spreading throughout a...|$|R
