Though nothing shocking occurs during the first 15–20 minutes of the film, the title music remains in the audience's mind, lending tension to these early scenes. Herrmann also maintains tension through the slower moments in the film {{through the use of}} ostinato.|$|E

That is to say, the timbre is associated in experience with the receipt of gratification, has acquired a pleasure-giving quality, and consequently <b>the</b> <b>tones</b> which in music have an allied timbre become pleasure-giving and are called beautiful. Not that this is the sole cause of their pleasure-giving quality.... Still, in recalling <b>the</b> <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> instruments which approach <b>the</b> <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human voice, and observing that they seem beautiful in proportion to their approach, we see that this secondary æsthetic element is important." ...|$|R

5|$|In November 2013, Howling Bells {{recorded}} Heartstrings at Assault & Battery Studios, in London. The {{album was}} primarily produced by Marks, but Moulder supported {{the effort and}} was given credit as co-producer. Marks set <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> the environment in the recording studio and the band felt extremely open and comfortable in her presence. Her female nature was credited with her ability to elicit exceptional performances from the band, more so than any of her record producer counterparts who worked with Howling Bells previously. The band moved on from former label Cooking Vinyl and established a partnership with Birthday Records, a small, independent record label founded by former Kaiser Chiefs drummer, Nick Hodgson.|$|E

Trevor also increased the usage of more millennial based references, impersonations & characterisations for his comedy on the show, due to his younger demographic and his ability to speak in multiple accents and eight languages.|$|E

5|$|In the novel's final chapters, {{the three}} storylines {{intersect}} with increasing frequency. <b>The</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> these chapters is especially dark as they deal primarily with the horrific torture {{and death of}} the assassins {{at the hands of}} the SIM, the failure of the coup, the rape of Urania, and the concessions made to Trujillo's most vicious supporters allowing them to enact their horrific revenge on the conspirators and then escape the country. The book ends as Urania prepares to return home, determined this time to keep in touch with her family back on the island.|$|E
5|$|Le Guin was {{strongly}} opposed to and {{troubled by the}} Vietnam War, a reaction which played a large part in <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> the novel. <b>The</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> the novel is often harsh and hard-hitting, playing off the anger in the United States at American military actions in Vietnam. The tension between violence and non-violence {{is a part of}} the dialectic theme in the novel, of a constant tension between opposites. Through most of the novel, the Terran military is in control of the colony, despite Raj Lyubov's good intentions. Davidson is the most prominent example of the oppressiveness of the military government. There are intentional parallels drawn between the Terran colonizers and the US intervention in Vietnam; the anti-interventionist tone of the novel was in sharp contrast to other science-fiction novels about war written around the same period. For example, the high use of drugs amongst US troops in Vietnam is represented by the use of hallucinogens amongst the Terran soldiers, which Le Guin portrays as the norm on the colony.|$|E
5|$|Lead's high density, atomic number, and {{formability}} {{form the}} basis for use of lead as a barrier that absorbs sound, vibration, and radiation. Lead has no natural resonance frequencies; as a result, sheet-lead is used as a sound deadening layer in the walls, floors, and ceilings of sound studios. Organ pipes are often made from a lead alloy, mixed with various amounts of tin to control <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> each pipe. Lead is an established shielding material from radiation in nuclear science and in X-ray rooms due to its denseness and high attenuation coefficient. Molten lead {{has been used as a}} coolant for lead-cooled fast reactors.|$|E
50|$|A plateau {{cannot be}} formed between a lexical tone and a phrasal tone; {{so in the}} {{sentence}} kíri mu Bunyóró 'it is in Bunyoro' there is downdrift, since <b>the</b> <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> Bunyóró are phrasal. But a phrasal tone can and frequently does form a plateau with a following high <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> either sort. So in abántú mú Úgáńda 'people in Uganda', there is a plateau from <b>the</b> phrasal <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> tú to <b>the</b> lexical <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> gá, and in túgendá mú lúgúúdó 'we are going into the street', there is a plateau from <b>the</b> phrasal <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> ndá to <b>the</b> phrasal <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> dó. Again there are certain exceptions; for example, there is no plateau before the words ono 'this' or bonnâ 'all': muntú onó 'this person', abántú bonnâ 'all the people'.|$|R

5|$|Obama's {{inaugural address}} {{received}} mixed reviews, with some describing <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> the speech a praiseworthy one of restraint and plain speaking, while others described the speech as low-brow and cliched. Despite his optimism, Obama {{was critical of}} former Presidents GeorgeW. Bush and BillClinton. David E. Sanger, chief Washington correspondent for The New York Times, described the speech as the harshest rebuke of an outgoing President during an inaugural address since Franklin Roosevelt's call for restoration of American values. The Bush administration was upset about <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> the speech, saying that the speech veered {{from that of a}} ritualistic but respectful thanks to that of a public diatribe. Members of the Republican party viewed the speech as a missed chance to seek unity, while Rahm Emanuel, Obama's White House Chief of Staff, described the speech as a reflection of the mandate of the people. In an analysis of the inaugural address, one reporter described the speech as one that emphasized the burdens of the moment and the cloudy future whose challenges may be met with the resolve that is part of our American heritage.|$|E

5|$|The 2009 {{film was}} {{originally}} conceived as an origin story, but the project {{evolved into a}} re-imagining of the first four Friday the 13th films. The character Jason Voorhees was redesigned as a lean, quick killer with a backstory that allows the viewer {{to feel a little}} sympathy for him, but not enough that he would lose his menace. In keeping with <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> the film, Jason's mask was recreated from a mold of the original mask used for Part III; though there were subtle changes. Friday the 13th includes some of Harry Manfredini's musical score from the previous Friday the 13th films because the producers recognized its iconic status.|$|E

5|$|The A and B {{clarinets}} {{have nearly}} the same bore and use the same mouthpiece. Orchestral clarinetists using the A and B instruments in a concert could use the same mouthpiece (and often the same barrel) (see 'usage' below). The A and B have nearly identical tonal quality, although the A typically has a slightly warmer sound. <b>The</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> the E clarinet is brighter and can be heard even through loud orchestral or concert band textures. The bass clarinet has a characteristically deep, mellow sound, while the alto clarinet is similar in tone to the bass (though not as dark).|$|E
5|$|The film's {{theme of}} {{reconciliation}} between a dying {{father and his}} son had special significance for Burton, as his father had died in 2000 and his mother in 2002, a month before he signed on to direct. Big Fish was shot on location in Alabama {{in a series of}} fairy tale vignettes evoking <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> a Southern Gothic fantasy. The film received award nominations in multiple film categories, including four Golden Globe Award nominations, seven nominations from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, two Saturn Award nominations, and an Oscar and a Grammy Award nomination for Danny Elfman's original score.|$|E
5|$|The fourth {{letter was}} written in {{response}} to the many charges put forth by the British supporters of Wood's patent against the Irish, including claims of papal influence and of treason. A large portion of the letter is a response to these accusations and to refuting further arguments that Wood's coin could be beneficial to the Irish people. <b>The</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> the letter is clear: Wood's allies are promoting an evil that will harm Ireland. However, Wood is only a secondary target—figures like Walpole are mocked for their role in the controversy.|$|E

5|$|The {{music has}} been {{compared}} to <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> alternative rock bands Radiohead, TheFlamingLips, and R.E.M.'s 1998 album Up. Furthermore, Barry Walters of Spin has compared the music to former Eno collaborators U2 and several reviewers have compared the musicality to PaulSimon—especially his 2006 Eno collaboration Surprise. The vocals have been declared similar to NeilYoung; and the arrangement {{has been compared to}} TheBeachBoys. Although the music was informed by gospel and digital music, comparisons have been made with genres as diverse as country due to the vocal delivery and oldschoolhiphop. One weakness addressed by several reviewers is the unoriginality of the music, especially in comparison to the duo's previous collaborations.|$|E
5|$|The story {{which became}} the director's {{follow-up}} film The Hateful Eight was first attempted as a paperback novel sequel to Django Unchained titled Django in White Hell. Tarantino decided, however, that the character's established morals did not fit <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> the developing story so he began re-writing it as an original screenplay with no connection to the earlier film. He has {{expressed a desire to}} write a series of Django sequel novels.|$|E

Instead of educating the public about different subcultures in the gay community, they printed effective posters showing an eye peeping through a keyhole and a family living in a fishbowl. High-profile liberal figures, labor unions, and other large organizations including the Church Council of Greater Seattle opposed Initiative Thirteen. David Estes {{did not have the}} enthusiasm and momentum modeled by Bryant and other communities though his campaign used many of their tactics. On election day, Initiative Thirteen was rejected by 63%.|$|E
