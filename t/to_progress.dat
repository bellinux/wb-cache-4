30|$|Prior to ST 6, {{trainees}} {{are expected}} to have reached independent competence in performing diagnostic hysteroscopy and polypectomy. It is, therefore, no longer a requirement to perform therapeutic hysteroscopies under direct supervision prior <b>to</b> <b>progressing</b> <b>to</b> advanced training. It can be argued that “polypectomy” is a form of therapeutic hysteroscopy; however, it is the simplest form because it can be performed blindly with polypectomy forceps, without the need of an operative hysteroscope. Therefore, the new training system following August 2007 no longer requires trainees to be trained in operative hysteroscopy prior <b>to</b> <b>progressing</b> <b>to</b> advanced training, hence, the overall criteria for hysteroscopic competence prior to advanced training have become less stringent, meaning that trainees choosing to pursue advanced training in hysteroscopic surgery will potentially be less trained at the onset compared to previous trainees.|$|R

The player controls a space ship as it navigates the terrain, flying either to the left or right.

The object is to destroy alien invaders, while protecting astronauts on the landscape from abduction. Humans that are abducted return as mutants that attack the ship.

A ship is lost if it is hit by an enemy, or hit by an enemy projectile, or if a hyperspace jump goes wrong (as they randomly do). After exhausting all ships, the game ends.|$|E
