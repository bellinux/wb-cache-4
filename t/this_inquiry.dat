5|$|When the Whitlam Government came {{to power}} in late 1972, the CMF was in a very poor state. The new {{government}} moved quickly to end conscription, and this caused the CMF's strength to fall by roughly 5,000 to 23,119 by June 1973. In 1973 a committee of inquiry into the CMF was announced, under the chairmanship of Dr. T.B Millar and the subsequent report developed from <b>this</b> <b>inquiry</b> became known as the Millar Report. Far from being a vehicle of the Regular Army to denigrate the CMF as some opponents predicted, the report did much to highlight many of the conceptual and structural problems that the CMF was afflicted by at the time, however, {{the way in which the}} government chose to implement the recommendations, and indeed the way in which some of them were allowed to lapse, ultimately served to at least partially justify some of the cynicism voiced in certain CMF circles about the report.|$|E

25|$|In 1864 the Queensland Government {{appointed}} a select committee {{to investigate the}} state of harbours and rivers in the colony. A direct outcome of <b>this</b> <b>inquiry</b> was {{the construction of the}} Bustard Head Light south-east of Gladstone in 1867/68 and a lighthouse at Sandy Cape in 1870 - the first lighthouses built by the Queensland colonial government. These were prefabricated iron-framed structures with bolted or riveted cast-iron plate cladding and internal iron staircases, the whole imported from England.|$|E

25|$|However, {{there were}} a number of {{objections}} to these proposals, amongst them from Strathclyde Bus Holdings, who it could be argued did so out of fear of their profit margins being affected by such an initiative. This necessitated a public inquiry, which lasted around 10 weeks. The Parliamentary Commissioners appointed to deliberate on the matter met and discussed the conclusions of <b>this</b> <b>inquiry</b> in a matter of hours before finding in favour of the objections raised thus killing off the Strathclyde Tram Project. The reasoning of the Commissioners is unknown as there existed no obligation for them to reveal it.|$|E

25|$|Argumentation {{theory is}} {{interdisciplinary}} {{in the sense}} that no one discipline will be able to provide a complete account. A full appreciation of argumentation requires insights from logic (both formal and informal), rhetoric, communication theory, linguistics, psychology, and, increasingly, computer science. Since the 1970s, there has been significant agreement that there are three basic approaches to argumentation theory: the logical, the rhetorical and the dialectical. According to Wenzel, the logical approach deals with the product, the dialectical with the process, and the rhetorical with the procedure. Thus, informal logic is one contributor to <b>this</b> <b>inquiry,</b> being most especially concerned with the norms of argument.|$|E
25|$|Giddings was an {{independent}} panel inspector with the Department of Environment between 1979 and 1991. During {{this time he}} presided over many inquiries concerning motorway expansion. He presided over the year-long inquiry in May 1982 concerning {{the extension of the}} M1 motorway to link with the A1(M). At the time it was the longest inquiry ever held. He also chaired the inquiry concerning the Archway Road A1 extension in North London. The expansion would have led to the demolition of almost 200 houses and was strongly opposed. During <b>this</b> <b>inquiry</b> he and his family received a number of threats and an attack on their home. This led to Gidding's resignation from the department in 1991.|$|E
25|$|Even so, it wasn't until February 1452 that Charles finally {{consented to}} see d'Estouteville. In his {{capacity}} as papal legate, he {{handed over the}} inquiry to the Inquisitor of France, Jean Bréhal. On 2 May 1452, the inquisitor questioned witnesses connected with the case, followed by more thorough testimony beginning on May 8. <b>This</b> <b>inquiry</b> included most of the former tribunal members who were still living. Though Charles was keen to know the facts behind the case, he was not enamored of {{the thought of the}} Inquisition running a high-profile case in France outside of royal control. But through d'Estouteville's intervention, by December 1452 the case had taken {{on a life of its}} own, independent of Charles.|$|E

25|$|In 1910, the {{decision}} was made to do a second Court of Inquiry. The reasons for this were the recovery of the bodies of the victims, so they could be buried in the United States and also a desire for a more thorough investigation. The fact that the Cuban government wanted the wreck removed from Havana Harbor might also have played a role: it at least offered the opportunity to examine the wreck in greater detail than had been possible in 1898, while simultaneously obliging the Cubans. Wegner suggests that the fact that <b>this</b> <b>inquiry</b> could be held without the pending risk of war, which had been the case in 1898, lent it the potential for greater objectivity than had been possible previously. Moreover, since several of the members of the 1910 board would be certified engineers, they would be better qualified to evaluate their findings than the line officers of the 1898 board had been.|$|E
25|$|Shastri's {{sudden death}} {{has led to}} {{persistent}} conspiracy theories that he was poisoned. The first inquiry into his death, conducted by the Raj Narain Inquiry, as {{it came to be}} known, however did not come up with any conclusions, and today no record of <b>this</b> <b>inquiry</b> exists with the Indian Parliament's library. It was alleged that no post-mortem was done on Shastri, but the Indian government in 2009, claimed it did have a report of a medical investigation conducted by Shastri's doctor and some Russian doctors. Furthermore, the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) revealed that there was no record of any destruction or loss of documents in the PMO having a bearing on Shastri's death. The Russian butler attending on Shastri {{at the time of his}} death was arrested for suspected poisoning but released later as per the news source. It was maintained that Shastri had died of cardiac arrest but his family insisted he was poisoned.|$|E
25|$|In May 2009, while Success was on {{exercise}} in South-East Asia, the ship's commanding officer was alerted to an alleged sex gambling game aboard, which challenged male sailors {{to record their}} sexual activities with female sailors in a 'ledger', and awarded them prize money based on with whom or where they had sex. This {{was one of several}} incidents during the three-month deployment; two bars in Manila were damaged during shore leave, while at another bar in Qingdao, several sailors were involved in a public sex act. Three male sailors were removed from Success when the ship docked in Singapore, and were sent back to Australia to participate in a formal inquiry; <b>this</b> <b>inquiry</b> was found to be flawed because of bias and the denial of support to the three accused, and a second, independent inquiry was set up under former judge Roger Gyles in February 2010. The first part of Gyles' inquiry report was released in February 2011, which stated that there was an entrenched culture of sexual harassment, bullying, and predatory sexual behaviour towards female sailors, coupled with alcohol-fuelled misconduct, particularly amongst the male sailors of the ship's marine engineering department. Gyles found that although the harassment and misconduct had been occurring as early as 2004, failures to respond to earlier complaints led to a breakdown in discipline aboard Success. The former judge was unable to prove the existence of the claimed ledger, but found many of the other claims to be correct, including evidence that male sailors had placed bets around having sex with a particular female sailor.|$|E

500|$|Despite initial grand {{plans and}} ideals, Kew Asylum had a {{difficult}} and chequered history resulting in several inquiries, including a Royal Commission. [...] The first inquiry occurred in 1876, only five years after Kew opened. Another notable inquiry occurred in 1907 after a severe outbreak of Typhoid fever, {{which at the time}} was thought to have been virtually eradicated in Melbourne. <b>This</b> <b>inquiry</b> in turn led to amendments to the Lunacy Act, improvements to Kew (and the state's other asylums) and the planned construction of Mont Park Asylum.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{findings}} of <b>this</b> <b>inquiry,</b> the issues surrounding the status and position of the College continued. At {{the beginning of the}} 20th century these issues were once again brought to the forefront. In 1903 an inquiry was set up at the instructions of Arthur Balfour, soon to be Prime Minister. The committee of inquiry was to consist of eight members, Sir Algernon West was made chairman. They were tasked to investigate [...] "the constitution, duties and administration of the Heralds' College". The main issues being the anomalous position of the College, who are theoretically officials of the Royal Household, but actually derive their income from fees paid by private individuals for their services. Some {{of the members of the}} committee (a minority) wanted (like Burke thirty-four years earlier) to make officers of the College of Arms into [...] "salaried civil servants of the state". Despite concluding that some form of change was necessary, the inquiry categorically stated that any changes [...] "is at the present time and in present circumstances impracticable." [...] In 1905 the generous endowment from the Crown (as instituted by George IV) was stopped by the Liberal Government of the day as part of its campaign against the House of Lords and the class system.|$|E

500|$|On 8 December 2009, General Walter Natynczyk {{testified before}} a {{parliamentary}} committee that one particular detainee that was abused on 14 June 2006 by Afghan police {{was never in}} CF custody. [...] Canada's chief commander stated that although CF members had questioned the man, he {{was taken into custody}} by Afghan police, and Canadian troops rescued him when the police started beating him with their shoes. However, the general corrected himself the following day upon receiving new information that the man had in fact been in Canadian custody. This would be the first piece of evidence that Afghan detainees in Canadian custody were subsequently abused by Afghan officials, contrary to government claims that there was no such evidence. It prompted opposition MPs to recall for a public inquiry into the matter, and for Peter MacKay to be fired. Canada's top military commander subsequently ordered an inquiry to find out why he had not been informed about this incident. <b>This</b> <b>inquiry</b> revealed many Canadian soldiers were aware that Afghan security forces beat prisoners [...] "in the street and elsewhere" [...] on a regular basis. [...] A separate report to General Natynczyk also concluded that the detainee beaten in June 2006 was not defined as a Canadian detainee, preventing it from being reported up the chain of command, and that the CF and Department of Defence should “be tasked to examine the detainee reporting process...to develop one consolidated process for the reporting on [...] detainees.” ...|$|E
