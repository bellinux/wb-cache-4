The song is sort of meant to be a wake up call. It could be about an ex-girlfriend. It could be about a rock diva <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know,</b> it could be about your sister. It could also be called 'Stupid Boy'." [...] Looking back, he also stated, [...] "It's impossible to predict what will be a hit.

Physically, of course, what I had to do was capture the energy, to capture the physicality of the man, the vocal physicality of the man, this was my task. I was aided enormously by my hair and makeup and special effects people here in terms of getting the overall, and indeed wardrobe helped a lot as well.

It is also Ingels' third housing development in Ørestad, following VM Houses and Mountain Dwellings. The sloping, bow-shaped 10-storey building consists of [...] of three different types of residential housing and [...] of retail premises and offices, providing views over the fields and marches of Kalvebod Faelled to the south. The 476-unit apartment building forms a figure 8 around two courtyards. Noted for its green roof which won it the 2010 Scandinavian Green Roof Award, Ingels explained, [...] "The parts of the green roof that remain were seen by the client as integral to the building as they are visible from the ground. These not only provide the environmental benefits <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> come from green roofs, but also add to the visual drama and appeal of the sloping roofs and rooftop terrace in between." [...] The building also won the Best Residential Building at the 2011 World Architecture Festival, and the Huffington Post included 8 House {{as one of the}} [...] "10 Best Architecture Moments of 2001–2010." ...|$|E

New York magazine's James Lim wrote that while Gaga's magazine covers were showing the singer in more modest poses, the book showed the [...] "wild, funky, creative Gaga <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> and love". Liesl Bradner of the Los Angeles Times expressed surprise at seeing Gaga without her makeup and stage costumes. [...] "It's when the singer {{takes a moment}} from the madness, pulls back her hair and ditches the costumes, that we see the real girl who is the mastermind behind the monster," [...] Bradner wrote, adding that the release would be special for the fans. Eden Carter Wood of Diva magazine shared the same thought with Bradner and added that the book contained nice portraits of the artist. Arthur House from The Daily Telegraph was positive in his review, while finding the pictures to be glossy and enjoyable. Toronto Stars David Graham compared the book to Madonna's similar styled book called Sex (released in 1992). However, he found a [...] "distinct lack of fanfare surrounding the book". Lady Gaga x Terry Richardson, according to Graham could not generate {{the same amount of}} [...] "shock and awe that erupted when Madonna came out with Sex". However he still believed that there were [...] "outrageous — even disturbing — photographs" [...] of Gaga.|$|E

2500|$|Former Sex Pistols and Public Image Ltd vocalist John Lydon {{alluded to}} sordid conduct by Savile, {{as well as}} {{suppression}} of widely held knowledge about such activity, in an October 1978 interview recorded for BBC Radio 1. Lydon stated: [...] "I'd like to kill Jimmy Savile; I think he's a hypocrite. I bet he's into all kinds of seediness <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> about, but {{are not allowed to}} talk about. I know some rumours." [...] He added: [...] "I bet none of this will be allowed out." [...] As predicted, the comment was edited out by the BBC prior to broadcasting, but the complete interview was included as a bonus track on a re-release of Public Image Ltd's 1978 debut album [...] in 2013, after Savile's death. In October 2014, Lydon expanded on his original quote, saying: [...] "By killed I meant locking him up and stopping him assaulting young children...

5000|$|Despite {{rave reviews}} and an {{excellent}} reputation as a live band, plus a growing fanbase, the band's career was set back by Bickers's refusal to tour America following an incident on the band's first American tour in which the band was caught in crossfire during a gun battle between police and a criminal gang. This led to tension between Bickers and the other members, culminating in Bickers departing the band, acrimoniously, in 1993.

First, I never meant that anything should supersede duties which I am well aware you practise with real use to yourself and those about you, e.g., the kindness and sympathy shown to friends, and generally due observance of all social relations. Second, I quite believe that the practical application of what is already known, teaching, going about among the poor, is of far more consequence than the acquisition of knowledge, which, of course, {{for its own sake}} is worth nothing.

60|$|I have pondered much {{upon the}} apparition, and {{have come to}} a {{definite}} opinion. A man I met later at Frankfort, and to whom I described the pair, said he had seen them himself in Paris, three weeks after the termination of the Fashoda incident; while a traveller for some English steel works whom we met in Strassburg remembered having seen them in Berlin during the excitement caused by the Transvaal question. My conclusion is that they were actors out of work, hired to do this thing in the interest of international peace. The French Foreign Office, wishful to allay the anger of the Parisian mob clamouring for war with England, secured this admirable couple and sent them round the town. You cannot be amused at a thing, {{and at the same time}} want to kill it. The French nation saw the English citizen and citizeness--no caricature, but the living reality--and their indignation exploded in laughter. The success of the stratagem prompted them later on to offer their services to the German Government, with the beneficial results <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know.</b>|$|E
60|$|If {{it were a}} plant {{propagated}} by seed, {{one would}} suppose that it was carried across by wind or waves, wafted on the feet of birds, or accidentally introduced in the crannies of drift timber. So the coco-nut made the tour of the world ages before either of the famous Cooks--the Captain or the excursion agent--had rendered the same feat easy and practicable; and so, too, a number of American plants have fixed their home in the tarns of the Hebrides or among the lonely bogs of Western Galway. But the banana must have been carried by man, because it is unknown in the wild state in the Western Continent; and, as it is practically seedless, it can only have been transported entire, {{in the form of}} a root or sucker. An exactly similar proof of ancient intercourse between the two worlds is afforded us by the sweet potato, a plant of undoubted American origin, which was nevertheless naturalised in China as early as the first centuries of the Christian era.

To her mind the acquittal was perfect; but she never explained to human ears,--not even to those of her sister,--the manner in which it had been given. Her life, as far as we are concerned with it, has been told. For the rest, it cannot be but that it should be better than that which was passed. If there be any retribution for such sufferings in money, liberty, and outward comfort, such retribution she possessed;--for all that had been his, was now hers. He had once suggested what she should do, were she ever to be married again; and she felt that of such a career there could be no possibility.

The God Squad, however, was not well received: Canning described it as [...] "conveniently arriving for the sake of one storyline in this episode" [...] and debating [...] "a forced issue <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> would result in acceptance", and VanDerWerff pointed out that as [...] "we already know how the other three kids are going to shake out", it was [...] "surprisingly undramatic" [...] and its sole purpose to [...] "watch a new character decide if he's okay with gay people".
