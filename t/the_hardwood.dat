40|$|Riparian {{habitats}} in <b>the</b> California <b>hardwoods</b> zone {{are slowly}} being converted from natural landuses to permanently anthropogenic landuses.

CA Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CDF) Hardwoods Rangeland Monitoring Project's map of the riparian areas in <b>the</b> <b>hardwoods</b> zone was combined with the UCSB California Gap Analysis Managed Areas map to show {{the area of the}} riparian habitat in the study not protected from development. Using ARC/INFO GRID, it was found that, of the approximately 2, 780, 000 acres of riparian mapped by CDF, 65 % is privately owned and not managed for biodiversity. A digital elevation model (DEM) was used to determine which riparian areas were on slopes of < 10 ¦. Riparian habitat on a slope of < 10 ¦ and privately owned is at a higher risk of development and represents 35 % of the total riparian habitat in the study area. In addition, to the management status and slope of <b>the</b> riparian <b>hardwood</b> habitat, <b>the</b> population growth rate of the study area counties was examined. The population of California is estimated to increase from 23, 383, 000 in 1996 to 47, 507, 000 by 2020, with 44 % of the population growth expected in occur in the counties with riparian hardwood habitat.

Paired with Abdul-Jabbar, two more division titles with the Bucks followed in the 1971–72 and 1972–73 season. In Robertson's last season, he helped lead Milwaukee to a league-best 59–23 record and helped them to reach the 1974 NBA Finals. There, Robertson {{had the chance to}} end his stellar career with a second ring. The Bucks were matched up against a Boston Celtics team powered by an inspired Dave Cowens, and the Bucks lost in seven games. As a testament to Robertson's importance to the Bucks, in the season following his retirement the Bucks fell to last place in their division with a 38–44 record in spite of the continued presence of Abdul-Jabbar.|$|E

5|$|On <b>the</b> <b>hardwood,</b> he was {{considered}} the consummate defensive center, noted for his unmatched defensive intensity, his stellar basketball IQ and his sheer will to win. Russell excelled at playing man-to-man defense, blocking shots, and grabbing defensive and offensive rebounds. Opponent Wilt Chamberlain said Russell's timing as a shot-blocker was unparalleled. Russell “was the smartest player ever {{to play the game}} ” according to Bill Bradley, Russell’s erstwhile Knicks opponent writing in 2009. He also could score with putbacks and made mid-air outlet passes to point guard Bob Cousy for easy fast break points. He also was known as a fine passer and pick-setter, featured a decent left-handed hook shot and finished strong on alley oops. However, on offense, Russell's output was limited. His NBA career personal averages show him to be an average scorer (15.1 points career average), a poor free throw shooter (56.1%), and average overall shooter from the field (44%, not exceptional for a center). In his 13 years, he averaged a relatively low 13.4 field goals attempted (normally, top scorers average 20 and more), illustrating that he was never {{the focal point of the}} Celtics offense, instead focusing on his tremendous defense.|$|E

Unfortunately, this has complicated describing and applying silvicultural practices for good northern hardwood management. Northern hardwoods are very diverse in species composition and stand characteristics.

With an annual state appropriation for the college of only $10,000, Cornell entered into a contract with the Brookyn Cooperage Company for the project to be viable. Under terms of the contract, the firm was to take the logs and cordwood from the forest land for a 15-year period.
