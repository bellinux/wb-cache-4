25|$|Albert Almoznino {{suggests}} {{to use a}} white or light-colored wall, sheet or <b>table</b> <b>cloth</b> for a small audience as in a private home. If a wall is dark-colored, the sheet or <b>table</b> <b>cloth</b> can be hung against it. If performing for a large audience such as in an auditorium or on a stage, he suggests a screen made of muslin or other thin cloth attached to a frame. In a nightclub, hall or small theater, he suggests a nylon screen on a pliable aluminum frame. It is a screen sometimes used for TV projection called a rear projection screen, but the light must be stronger like a small spotlight without the projector, lenses, or diffusers, or a motion-picture projector with the front lenses removed.|$|E
25|$|Graham {{is seated}} {{to the right}} of the picture, on the left of the table that divides the picture. He is seen in full length, facing {{forwards}} though looking to the side, while smoking a long pipe. Standing to Graham's right, his lower half obscured by the <b>table</b> <b>cloth,</b> a man holds a sheet of music and is in the act of singing. The third member of the dining party is seated on the left of the painting, and like Graham is visible in full length. Ronald Paulson identifies them as the ship's clerk and chaplain. The music the men are listening or singing along to is provided by a black manservant, standing on the right of the painting and playing a pipe and tabor. A steward stands opposite him on the left of the painting, framing the composition. The steward holds a plate of roast duck, but looks out of the painting towards the viewer with a smile, while gravy drips from the plate down the back of the chaplain's coat. The remaining members of the portrait are two dogs. One is Graham's own, sitting at the chaplain's feet and apparently joining in the singing. The other, sat on his haunches on a chair on the right of the painting, is Hogarth's own pug, Trump. Trump, his tongue lolling out and wearing Graham's wig, holds a scroll and appears to read from his own sheet of music, balanced against a wine glass in front of him.|$|E
500|$|An {{excerpt from}} [...] premiered as the song's music video in August 2009 on Disney Channel {{to promote the}} home release of the film. The video begins with Cyrus and her backup dancers atop a stage in a crowded outdoor concert. Cyrus is dressed as Hannah Montana and is wearing a {{business}} suit. As Cyrus begins singing, she and the dancers engage in intricate choreography. The video then transitions to a clip from Hannah Montana: The Movie in which Cyrus' character is getting down from a private airplane. The video continues to alternate between Cyrus performing and more film clips; scenes include Stewart taking off her Hannah Montana wig and interacting with Travis Body, her love interest in the film, portrayed by actor Lucas Till. Midway through the video, Cyrus and her dancers exit the stage through a back door and instantly enter sporting western clothing with Cyrus in a western teal button up shirt, a checkered red and white <b>table</b> <b>cloth</b> with purple ruffles pettiskirt or a petticoat, and cowboy boots.|$|E

500|$|Kanduri {{festival is}} a 14-day annual event celebrated during the urs (death anniversary) of the Saint. The festival is celebrated in {{commemoration}} of {{the anniversary of the}} Saint's death, and pilgrims participate in the rituals and rites. [...] The word [...] "Kanduri" [...] is derived from the Persian word for <b>table</b> <b>cloth.</b> The festival is also called [...] "Qadir Wali Ke Fande" [...] festival. A saffron flag-carrying ceremony is also observed, during which a flag is carried from a devotee's house to the dargah, accompanied by a procession in streets. The flag is hoisted on a tree known as [...] "Fande ka Fahad" [...] by a Sirang (hereditary trustee) who is assisted by twenty assistants. The Islamic rites performed during the festival include the recitation of Quranic verses and observance of Fatiha (it includes recitation of Al-Fatiha an essential part of daily prayer and Durood). The main attraction of the festival is the presence of Fakhir Jamas (mendicant priests) and Qalandars—the disciples of the saint who witness the festival. On the 9th day of Jamathul Akhir month in the Islamic calendar, at 10 p.m., a Pir (one of the disciples) is chosen for the spiritual exercise of offering prayers to the Saint. The disciple throws lemons {{at the end of the}} prayers on to devotees, which [...] provides miraculous relief to worldly sorrows. The festival is also seen as a sacred exchange between Hindus and Muslims expressing solidarity of mixed faith in the region. Pilgrims from both the religions from the state and also from Sri Lanka, Burma and Gulf countries, attend the festival. In the evening of the ninth day of Akhir month in the Islamic calendar, a chariot containing sandal paste (locally called santhanakoodu) is pulled across the streets of Nagore by pilgrims and devotees, accompanied by banging of instruments. [...] The sandal paste is received by the saint's descendants and used to anoint the Rowla Sharif (sanctum) of the saint by the Khalifa of the dargah.|$|E

2500|$|During Easter of 1948, Timothy Evans and {{his wife}} Beryl moved into the top-floor flat at Rillington Place, where Beryl gave birth that October to their daughter, Geraldine. In late 1949, Evans {{informed}} police {{that his wife was}} dead. A police search of 10Rillington Place failed to find her body, but a later search revealed the bodies of Beryl Evans, her daughter, Geraldine, and a 16-week-old male foetus in an outdoor wash-house. Beryl's body had been wrapped twice over in a blanket and then a <b>table</b> <b>cloth.</b> The post-mortem revealed that both mother and daughter had been strangled and that Beryl Evans had been physically assaulted before her death, shown by facial bruising. Evans at first claimed that Christie had killed his wife in a botched abortion operation, but police questioning eventually produced a confession. The alleged confession may have been fabricated by the police themselves, as the statement appears contrived and artificial. After being charged Evans withdrew his confession and once again accused Christie, this time of both murders. On 11January 1950, Evans was put on trial for the murder of his daughter, the prosecution having decided not to pursue a second charge of murdering his wife. Christie was a principal witness for the Crown and gave evidence denying Evans's accusations. The jury found Evans guilty despite the revelation of Christie's criminal record of theft and violence, and, after an appeal on 20 February had failed, Evans was hanged at Pentonville Prison on 9 March 1950. (Christie himself lost the job he had held for four years at the Post Office Savings Bank due to the disclosure of his criminal convictions at the trial.) ...|$|E
