5|$|Certain {{patterns}} of reflectivity are important clues for the meteorologist as well. The three body scatter spike is an example. This {{is the result}} of energy from <b>the</b> <b>radar</b> hitting hail and being deflected to the ground, where they deflect back to the hail and then to <b>the</b> <b>radar.</b> The energy took more time to go from the hail to the ground and back, as opposed to the energy that went direct from the hail to <b>the</b> <b>radar,</b> and the echo is further away from <b>the</b> <b>radar</b> than the actual location of the hail on the same radial path, forming a cone of weaker reflectivities.|$|E
5|$|A mid-wing, all-metal, {{cantilever}} monoplane {{with two}} Pratt & Whitney Double Wasp radial engines mounted in streamlined nacelles under the wing, the XTSF-1 {{was intended to}} carry two crew members in tandem seats, and featured an internal bomb bay and a SCR-720 radar set, <b>the</b> <b>radar</b> later being replaced in the design by an AN/APS-3 or AN/APS-4 set. A second seat was added for <b>the</b> <b>radar</b> operator.|$|E
5|$|Based on this information, Frost {{decided to}} divide the company into five groups of forty men for the raid, each named after a famous Royal Navy admiral: 'Nelson', 'Jellicoe', 'Hardy', 'Drake' and 'Rodney'. 'Nelson' would clear and secure German {{positions}} defending the evacuation beach, whilst 'Jellicoe', 'Hardy' and 'Drake' would capture <b>the</b> <b>radar</b> site, villa and the enclosure. 'Rodney' was the reserve formation, placed between <b>the</b> <b>radar</b> site and the main likely enemy approach to block any counterattack.|$|E

40|$|Two oceanographic Radars {{targeting}} tsunamis {{had been}} installed in Wakayama Prefecture in Japan. To study obeservation capabilities of <b>the</b> <b>radars</b> on far field and near field tsunamis, numerical experiments were carried out. After starting {{the operation of}} <b>the</b> <b>radars,</b> nine earthquakes occurred in the observation area, however, they were {{too small to be}} observed by <b>the</b> <b>radars.</b> Parameter study on near field tsunamis showed <b>the</b> <b>radars</b> can observe earthquake of Mw 7 and very shallow Mw 6. As a far field tsunami, the 2012 Haida Gweii Earthquake Tsunami arrived at Japan, however, <b>the</b> <b>radars</b> could not detect it because of very small velocity. Parameter study on far field tusnamis showed the main energy of tsunamis off Canada propagates northward, and Oshika Peninsula is suitable to observe the tsunamis...|$|R

5|$|Construction at the {{two sites}} started between 1962 and 1963 with {{improvements}} in the TsSO-P test model being fed back into the deployed units. They gained an M-4 2-M computer with semiconductors, although the rest of <b>the</b> <b>radar</b> used Vacuum tubes. <b>The</b> <b>radar</b> systems were completed in late 1966 with the fourth Dnestr at Balkhash being used for testing. In 1968 the Dnepropetrovsk Sputnik target satellite, DS-P1-Yu, {{was used to test}} the ability of the system.|$|E
5|$|Examination of <b>the</b> <b>radar</b> array {{also allowed}} British {{scientists}} {{to conclude that}} they would have to deploy a countermeasure that had recently been developed, code-named Window. Examination of the Würzburg array showed that it was impervious to being jammed by conventional means used by the British during the early years of the conflict; thus Window would have to be deployed against German radars. The effectiveness of Window against Würzburg radar arrays was confirmed by a raid conducted by RAF Bomber Command on 24 July 1943 against Hamburg (Operation Gomorrah); when the bombers utilised Window, all of <b>the</b> <b>radar</b> arrays in Hamburg were blinded and their operators confused, unable to distinguish between <b>the</b> <b>radar</b> signature of a real bomber and several pieces of Window giving off a similar signature.|$|E
5|$|Hugo Sperrle's Luftflotte 3 {{ordered his}} dive bomber units to begin {{operations}} against <b>the</b> <b>radar</b> stations and airfields {{on the southern}} coast of Britain.

5000|$|Clinton would {{continue}} to slide down the standings, as they finished the year with a 13-6-1 record, earning 27 points, and fourth place in the WOAA South Division. The 27 points would be the lowest point total earned <b>the</b> <b>Radars</b> since <b>the</b> 2000-01 season. Clinton beat the Tillsonburg Thunder in seven games {{in the first round}} of <b>the</b> playoffs. <b>The</b> <b>Radars</b> took a 3-1 series lead before being pushed to a seventh game. <b>The</b> <b>Radars</b> won game seven 6-5 in double overtime. <b>The</b> <b>Radars</b> were then eliminated in the [...] "AA" [...] quarter-finals by the Tavistock Royals (again) in seven games. Tavistock won game seven 5-4 in overtime. Four of the series seven games were decided in overtime.|$|R
5000|$|Over the years, the {{equipment}} {{at the station}} was upgraded or modified to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the information gathered by <b>the</b> <b>radars.</b> <b>The</b> 766th <b>Radar</b> Squadron was inactivated on 30 September 1980.|$|R
50|$|The SSRs proved only {{moderately}} successful, as <b>the</b> <b>radars</b> themselves proved troublesome {{and somewhat}} unreliable, and the boats' surface speed was insufficient {{to protect a}} fast-moving carrier group. <b>The</b> <b>radars</b> were removed and the boats reverted to general purpose submarines after 1959.|$|R
5|$|Storm {{spotters}} {{are needed}} because radar {{systems such as}} NEXRAD do not detect a tornado; merely signatures which hint at the presence of tornadoes. Radar may give a warning before there is any visual evidence of a tornado or imminent tornado, but ground truth from an observer can either verify the threat or determine that a tornado is not imminent. The spotter's ability to see what radar cannot is especially important as distance from <b>the</b> <b>radar</b> site increases, because <b>the</b> <b>radar</b> beam becomes progressively higher in altitude further away from <b>the</b> <b>radar,</b> chiefly due to curvature of Earth, and the beam also spreads out.|$|E
5|$|The Wild Weasels {{also carried}} {{electronic}} countermeasures (ECM) equipment to protect themselves. They directed flak suppression strikes and carried AGM-45 Shrike anti-radiation missiles (another Navy development), which homed in on <b>the</b> <b>radar</b> {{systems of the}} SAMs. The SA-2 had greater range than the Shrike, but if the Shrike was launched and <b>the</b> <b>radar</b> operator stayed on the air, the American missile would home in on the signal and destroy <b>the</b> <b>radar</b> source. A sophisticated cat and mouse game then ensued between North Vietnamese radar operators and the Wild Weasel pilots.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>radar</b> suite {{included}} two Type 277Q height-finding sets, one Type 293M surface search set, one Type 960/281BQ long-range air warning set, and one Type 961 air search set.|$|E

40|$|A laser {{satellite}} ranging {{system that}} is mounted upon and integrated with a microwave tracking <b>radar</b> is reported. <b>The</b> 1 -pulse/sec ruby laser transmitter is attached directly to <b>the</b> <b>radar's</b> elevation axis and radiates through a new opening in <b>the</b> <b>radar's</b> parabolic dish. <b>The</b> laser photomultiplier tube receiver utilizes <b>the</b> <b>radar's</b> existing 20 -cm diam f/ 11 boresight telescope and observes through a similar symmetrically located opening in the dish. The laser system possesses separate ranging system electronics but shares <b>the</b> <b>radar's</b> timing, computer, and data handling/recording systems. The basic concept of the laser/radar is outlined together with a listing of the numerous advantages over present singular laser range-finding systems. The developmental laser hardware is described along with preliminary range-finding results and expectations...|$|R
5|$|The rapid {{introduction}} of new types of radars working on different frequencies meant the IFF system had to respond to an ever-increasing list of signals, and the direct response of the Mk. II required an ever-increasing number of sub-models, each turned to different frequencies. By 1941 {{it was clear that}} this was going to grow without bound, and a new solution was needed. The result was a new series of IFF units which used the indirect interrogation technique. These operated on a fixed frequency, different from <b>the</b> <b>radar.</b> The interrogation signal was sent from the aircraft by pressing a button on <b>the</b> <b>radar,</b> which caused the signal to be sent out in pulses synchronized to the radar's main signal. The received signal was amplified and mixed into the same video signal as <b>the</b> <b>radar,</b> causing the same extended blip to appear.|$|E
5|$|Attacking and {{destroying}} <b>the</b> <b>radar</b> chain was also difficult. The stations were indeed vulnerable to dive bombers and low flying aircraft, however the British had mobile units {{which could be}} moved around to cover any gaps. Rapid repair services were also quick. Rarely were radar stations out of action {{for more than a}} few days.|$|E
5|$|Development {{continued}} largely at {{the urging}} of the Admiralty, who saw it as a solution to detecting the conning towers of partially submerged U-Boats. After a visit by Tizard to GEC's Hirst Research Centre in Wembley in November 1939, and a follow-up visit by Watt, the company took up development and developed a working 25cm set using modified VT90s by the summer of 1940. With this success, Lovell and a new addition to the Airborne Group, Alan Lloyd Hodgkin, began experimenting with horn-type antennas that would offer significantly higher angular accuracy. Instead of broadcasting <b>the</b> <b>radar</b> signal across the entire forward hemisphere of the aircraft and listening to echoes from everywhere in that volume, this system would allow <b>the</b> <b>radar</b> to be used like a flashlight, pointed in the direction of observation. This would greatly increase the amount of energy falling on a target, and improve detection capability.|$|E
50|$|Over the years, the {{equipment}} {{at the station}} was upgraded or modified to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the information gathered by <b>the</b> <b>radars.</b> <b>The</b> AN/FPS-90 height-finder <b>radar</b> was retired in late 1971.|$|R

5|$|Dowding {{later wrote}} a memo {{considering}} several aircraft for the role, rejecting the Boulton Paul Defiant two-seat fighter {{due to its}} cramped rear turret area. He was sure the Bristol Beaufighter would be perfect for the role, {{but it would not}} be ready for some time. So he selected the Bristol Blenheim light bomber for the immediate term, sending two of the early prototypes to Martlesham Heath to be fitted with <b>the</b> <b>radar</b> from the Battles. Blenheim K7033 was fitted with <b>the</b> <b>radar,</b> while K7034 acted as the target. Both of these aircraft lost a propeller in flight but landed safely; K7033s propeller was never found, but K7034s was returned to Martlesham the next day by an irate farmer.|$|E
5|$|Early in production, <b>the</b> <b>radar</b> was {{upgraded}} to the Westinghouse AN/APQ-72, an AN-APG-50 {{with a larger}} radar antenna, necessitating the bulbous nose, and the canopy was reworked to improve visibility and make the rear cockpit less claustrophobic.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, local {{production}} of the F-20 was discussed with India.

It was evaluated by a Pakistani contingent in the United States, with the F-20 being flown by Abbas Mirza, a senior Pakistani air force fighter pilot. Of {{the components of the}} F-20, <b>the</b> <b>radar</b> would end up being the most successful; Taiwan selected it for the Ching-kuo, South Korea also adopted it for the KAI T-50 Golden Eagle trainer aircraft, and <b>the</b> <b>radar</b> was used in the multinational FMA IA 63 Pampa. As sales prospects were not apparent early on, GE sold their radar division, which was eventually acquired by Lockheed-Martin.|$|E
