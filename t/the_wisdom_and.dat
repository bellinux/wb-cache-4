But also, it {{laid the groundwork for}} a historic and decisive shift in the global balance of economic power, from Europe to the United States; a shift which occurred exactly at that time. More than this, McAdoo's actions both saved the American economy and its future allies from economic defeat {{in the early stages of}} the war.|$|E
25|$|Collaborative {{planning}} {{arose in}} the US {{in response to the}} inadequacy of traditional public participation techniques to provide real opportunities for the public to make decisions affecting their communities. Collaborative planning is a method designed to empower stakeholders by elevating them to the level of decision-makers through direct engagement and dialogue between stakeholders and public agencies, to solicit ideas, active involvement, and participation in the community planning process. Active public involvement can help planners achieve better outcomes by making them aware of the public’s needs and preferences and by using local knowledge to inform projects. When properly administered, collaboration can result in more meaningful participation and better, more creative outcomes to persistent problems than can traditional participation methods. It enables planners to make decisions that reflect community needs and values, it fosters faith in <b>the</b> <b>wisdom</b> <b>and</b> utility of the resulting project, and the community is given a personal stake in its success.|$|E

2500|$|Despite Victor's {{failure to}} carry out his intent to excommunicate the Asian churches, many Catholic apologists point to this episode as {{evidence}} of papal primacy and authority in the early Church, citing the fact that none of the bishops challenged his right to excommunicate but rather questioned <b>the</b> <b>wisdom</b> <b>and</b> charity of doing so. Orthodox apologists argue that Victor had to relent in the end and note that the Eastern Churches never granted Victor presidency over anything other than the Church of Rome.
