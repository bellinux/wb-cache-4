500|$|Meredith is widowed when Derek {{is killed}} in a car {{accident}} and was taken to an understaffed hospital. The doctors failed to recognize his head injury in time and allowed personal conflicts to interfere. Derek is declared brain dead, and Meredith must go to the medical center to consent to remove him from life support, shortly before she's hit with the first waves of morning sickness. She tells Penny, the intern who was assigned to Derek that every doctor has [...] "that one" [...] patient who dies on their watch and haunts them forever and [...] "that one will make you work harder, and <b>they</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> better." ...|$|E
500|$|The subplot of Homer {{entering}} the childproofing business {{was inspired by}} an instance when a salesman visited Payne and his pregnant wife to see if their home was safe for children. In an interview with Star-News, Payne commented: [...] "You hire this person to come into your home to look for changes you can make. <b>They</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> feel like the most horrible {{person in the world}} and that your house is the temple of doom." [...] "Bye Bye Nerdie" [...] features a scene based specifically on this instance in which a saleswoman (voiced by cast member Tress MacNeille) selling childproofing items visits Homer and Marge and exaggerates the dangers in their home. NRBQ's song [...] "Always Safety First" [...] is played during a montage in the episode in which Homer is seen improving the safety of the infants of Springfield.|$|E

500|$|Brosnan left Ireland on 12 August 1964 and was {{reunited with}} his mother and her new husband, William Carmichael, now living in the Scottish village of Longniddry, East Lothian. Carmichael took Brosnan to see a James Bond film for the first time (Goldfinger), at the age of 11. Later moving back to London, Brosnan was educated at Elliott School, a state {{comprehensive}} school in Putney, southwest London, now known as Ark Putney Academy. Brosnan has spoken about the transition from Ireland to England and his education in London; [...] "When you go to a very large city, a metropolis like London, as an Irish boy of 10, life suddenly moves pretty fast. From a little school of, say, seven classrooms in Ireland, to this very large comprehensive school, with over 2,000 children. And you're Irish. And <b>they</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> feel it; the British have a wonderful way of doing that, and I had a certain deep sense of being an outsider." [...] When he attended school, his nickname was [...] "Irish".|$|E
500|$|In Marc Cherry's first {{script for}} the pilot of Desperate Housewives, the {{character}} was originally named Mary Alice Scott, but he was later forced to change the character's surname when the series {{was picked up by}} ABC. In the book Desperate Housewives: Behind Closed Doors, a companion to the first season of the series, he explained: [...] "We changed Mary Alice Scott to Mary Alice Young because we couldn't get the name cleared with our lawyers. If over three people in the country have that name you're fine but with anything less than that, <b>they</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> use a different name. Apparently there was one Mary Alice Scott in the country." [...] The role of Mary Alice was originally given to Sheryl Lee, who portrayed the character in the original pilot that was filmed for ABC, but Lee was soon replaced by Strong after Cherry and the producers decided that Lee was not right for the part. Marcia Cross, who would later be cast as Bree Van de Kamp, also expressed interest in Mary Alice, but after reading for the part Cherry insisted that she read for Bree instead.|$|E
500|$|Many reviewers {{praised the}} game's combat and pacing. G4 called the game's combat [...] "sublime," [...] {{and said that}} [...] "no Infinity Engine game thus far has had such {{interesting}} and intricate tactical combat." [...] GameSpot called it [...] "expertly paced." [...] PC Zone complained that certain gameplay mechanics had become outdated, but that [...] "the only real downer is the antiquated spell system and the inexplicable necessity to rest after every fight." [...] The game was also praised for its implementation of the Third Edition rules and interface. Computer Gaming World said that [...] "IWD II has the Third Edition rules down, and in no other place in the game is it more apparent than with character development," [...] and PC Gamer said it had [...] "a dazzling implementation of the D 3rd Edition rules." [...] GameSpot called the interface [...] "a big improvement on the spread-out interface of all previous Infinity Engine games," [...] and IGN said that [...] "the customization improvements to the interface that seem so natural, <b>they</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> wonder why they weren't thought of before." [...] Game Informer called the interface [...] "absolutely inspired" [...] and its inventory system [...] "second to none." ...|$|E

500|$|Week ten {{featured}} the Bears attempting to avoid suffering the first sweep by the Lions since 2007, while {{also trying to}} claim the division lead; {{the last time the}} two teams faced each other in a late-season game for the division lead was in 1991, which ended in a Chicago 20–10 win. However, the Bears had won the last five games against the Lions at Soldier Field. On November 7, Marc Trestman announced that Jay Cutler has been cleared by doctors to return against Detroit, despite having been projected to be out for approximately four weeks. Against the Lions, Cutler was 7–2, and won all four home games. On the offensive side, Jeff Joniak states that the Lions defensive line [...] "are ferocious up the middle, they are physical, and <b>they</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> pay for poor technique," [...] but that [...] "there is growing confidence that the Bears offense is a resilient one;" [...] the Bears had the fewest pre-snap penalties in the league, and only one false start. The Bears could also seize the Lions' cornerback corps, which struggled during the season, allowing 11 plays of 40 yards or more, along with 4.7 yards per carry. Defensively, Sports Illustrated writers Chris Burke and Doug Farrar wrote the Bears must attempt to hinder Reggie Bush, and improve their performance from the previous week, when the Packers' running game ran for 190 yards and two touchdowns. The Bears also had to prevent Calvin Johnson from excelling; against the Dallas Cowboys, Johnson recorded 329 receiving yards.|$|E

2500|$|James Berardinelli {{wrote of}} the film, [...] "The Mist is what a horror film should be—dark, tense, and punctuated by just enough gore to keep the viewer's flinch reflex intact. ... Finally, after {{a long list of}} failures, someone has done justice in {{bringing}} one of King's horror stories to the screen. Though definitely not the feel-good movie of the season, this is a must-see for anyone who loves the genre and doesn't demand 'torture porn' from horror." [...] Roger Ebert was negative, however, writing: [...] "If you have seen ads or trailers suggesting that horrible things pounce on people, and <b>they</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> think you want to see this movie, you will be correct. It is a competently made Horrible Things Pouncing on People Movie. If you think Frank Darabont has equaled the Shawshank and Green Mile track record, you will be sadly mistaken." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bourne {{arrives at}} a {{hospital}} at 415 East 71st Street, having figured out Landy's coded message. Outside, Bourne meets Landy and gives her the Blackbriar files before going inside. Vosen also figures out Landy's code and warns Dr. Albert Hirsch (Albert Finney), who ran Treadstone's behavior modification program, that Bourne is coming. He follows Landy inside the building but {{is too late to}} stop her from faxing the Blackbriar documents out. Meanwhile, Hirsch is confronted by Bourne on an upper floor, who now remembers that he volunteered for Treadstone. As Bourne flees to the roof, he is confronted by Paz, who asks, [...] "Why didn't you take the shot?" [...] Bourne repeats the dying words of The Professor in The Bourne Identity: [...] "Look at us. Look at what <b>they</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> give." [...] Paz lowers his gun, but Vosen appears and shoots at Bourne as he jumps into the East River.|$|E
