Four acres of land at the end of Brean Down were requisitioned in 1862, with construction beginning in 1864 and completed in 1871.|$|E

5|$|The Act was {{subsequently}} amended to promote private development {{of nuclear energy}} under the Eisenhower administration's Atoms for Peace program in 1954. In restricting <b>the</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> nuclear information to other countries, it created a rift between the United States and its allies, particularly Britain and Canada, which {{had participated in the}} Manhattan Project. This resulted in cumbersome command and control arrangements, and in Britain developing its own nuclear weapons. The Act was amended in 1958 to allow the United States to share information with its close allies.|$|E

5|$|After work began, it was {{determined}} that the repairs needed were more extensive, costly, and time-consuming than expected, and NJDOT estimated that rehabilitation could cost more than $1.2billion. In 2009, NJDOT estimated that it would take a decade before the state could afford to rehabilitate or replace the structure. In a controversial move in 2011, Governor Chris Christie directed the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) to divert money originally earmarked for <b>the</b> <b>Access</b> <b>to</b> the Region's Core rail project to highway projects.

5|$|At first, Sélestat {{was a major}} {{strategic}} stronghold for the French. Located {{near the}} Rhine, it controlled <b>the</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the Vosges mountains {{and the rest of}} France. Vauban, the foremost military architect at that time, rebuilt the town walls between 1675 and 1691. However, after the conquest of Strasbourg in 1681 Sélestat lost much of its strategic importance, as Strasbourg was better located. But it remained a garrison town, and the troops stationed there helped to improve the faltering local economy. Although Protestantism was not forbidden in Alsace, French authorities largely encouraged Catholicism and opened three new convents in Sélestat. Jews were expelled from the town in 1642. During the French Revolution the population was extremely conservative and opposed to change. The new territorial organisation confirmed the decline of the town, which did not become a prefecture and was not distinguished as a subprefecture until 1806, when it replaced Barr in that capacity. Sélestat suffered from the Napoleonic wars as it was besieged and bombed by the Bavarians in 1814 and blockaded by a German coalition in 1815.|$|E
5|$|Fischer {{attempted}} to gain wider {{support for the}} cooperation schemes already in place and extend their scope in Sector West. Fischer also assured the local authorities of the RSK that {{such a move would}} prevent renewed fighting in the area. The result of Fischer's efforts was the Daruvar Agreement. The agreement, signed in Daruvar on 18 February, encompassed the reconstruction of water and electrical power supply networks, the reopening of the Zagreb–Belgrade motorway section in Sector West for non-commercial traffic, the facilitation of the Novska–Nova Gradiška railway, the repair of telecommunication lines, the establishment of a joint commission tasked with normalisation of living conditions in Sector West, the return of all refugees to their homes, <b>the</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> property owned by civilians across the ceasefire line, and further meetings with local authorities to discuss further cooperation.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, The New York Times {{reported}} that Mayor Michael Bloomberg's administration had been considering an extension to Hoboken and to Secaucus Junction in New Jersey, {{where it would}} connect with most New Jersey Transit commuter lines. It would offer New Jersey commuters a direct route to Grand Central Terminal on the East Side of Manhattan and connections to most other New York City subway routes. If opened, the extension would take the New York City Subway outside the state's borders for the first time. The plan would replace <b>the</b> <b>Access</b> <b>to</b> the Region's Core (ARC) tunnel, which was canceled by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in October 2010.|$|E
5|$|In May 2007, the TSB {{released}} {{copies of}} the audio recordings of the air traffic control transmissions associated with the flight. The transcripts of these recordings had been released in 1998 (within days of the crash), but the TSB had refused to release the audio on privacy grounds. The TSB argued that under Canada's Access to Information Act and Privacy Act, the audio recordings constituted personal information and were thus not disclosable. Canada's Federal Court of Appeal rejected this argument in 2006 in a legal proceeding concerned with air traffic control recordings in four other air accidents. The Supreme Court of Canada did not grant leave to appeal that decision and consequently the TSB released {{a copy of the}} Swissair 111 air traffic control audio recordings to the Canadian Press, which had requested the recordings under <b>the</b> <b>Access</b> <b>to</b> Information Act. Several key minutes of the air traffic control audio {{can be found on the}} Toronto Star web site.|$|E

State Senator Diane Savino was among the supporters of the tunnel; Savino stated that if built, the tunnel would cost $3 billion and would improve quality of life for Staten Islanders, reduce traffic, and increase the attractiveness of the borough for investment.|$|E

Innovation, Business and Rural Development Minister Keith Hutchings was appointed as the minister {{responsible for the}} office, while Steve Kent was appointed parliamentary secretary for the office. Several days after his appointment Hutchings announced {{that the government was}} looking at putting restaurant inspection reports online for the public viewing. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) had spent $457 obtaining inspection reports earlier the year, which had been criticized by former Service NL Minister Paul Davis during the debate on Bill 29. On November 22, 2012, Hutchings and Service NL Minister Nick McGrath announced that the public could now go on the government's website and see recent health and sanitation inspection reports for restaurants. While both opposition parties agreed with the government's decision to make the reports available online, Liberal MHA Andrew Parsons said that “I have no doubt that this is a response to the Bill 29 criticism".|$|E
5|$|This growth would {{continue}} due to transportation {{improvements in the}} 1820s. Troy's businessmen had already built a turnpike to Schenectady, the path followed today by Route 2 from Troy to Colonie. These trade routes were enhanced by the Erie and Champlain canals, which opened new markets {{to the north and}} west, while the Troy Steamboat Company's debut did likewise for the south. <b>The</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> iron ore mines in the Adirondack Mountains also got some local businessmen into iron refining. In 1835 the Rensselaer and Saratoga Railroad brought that technology to the city, and in 1842 the completion of the Schenectady and Troy Railroad linked Troy to the vast network that reached as far west as Buffalo.|$|E
