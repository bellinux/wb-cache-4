25|$|The {{national}} memorial {{has three}} main parts: entry, assembly room, and shrine. The central assembly room features seven large open windows on either wall and ceiling, {{to commemorate the}} date of the attack. Rumor says the 21 windows symbolically represents a 21-gun salute or 21Marines standing at eternal parade rest over the tomb of the fallen, but guides at the site will confirm this was not the architect's intention. The memorial also has an opening in the floor overlooking the sunken decks. It is from this opening that visitors can pay their respects by tossing flowers in honor of the fallen sailors. In the past, leis were <b>tossed</b> <b>in</b> the water, but because string from leis poses a hazard to sea life, leis now are placed on guardrails in front of the names of the fallen.|$|E

Shirley is soon kidnapped by a bandit named Moses, {{prompting}} Senel to {{team up with}} a local sheriff named Will and a female knight named Chloe to rescue her. Will explains that Shirley's arrival coincided with a pillar of light {{at the center of}} the ship, leading many to believe that she is the legendary [...] "Merines", a person destined to lead the Ferines to prosperity. After finding her at the thieves' hideout, she is captured yet again by a Ferines soldier named Walter Delques, who takes her away. When the group eventually catches Walter, he reveals that he was only protecting her from the real enemy: the Orerine Crusand Empire Army, led by a man named Vaclav Bolud, who promptly arrives and abducts Shirley himself. While in captivity, Shirley becomes friends with another captive, a young Ferines girl named Fenimore Xelnes.|$|E
500|$|At that time, a Parisian ballet {{audience}} typically {{consisted of}} two diverse groups: the wealthy and fashionable set, who would be expecting to see a traditional performance with beautiful music, and a [...] "Bohemian" [...] group who, the poet-philosopher Jean Cocteau asserted, would [...] "acclaim, right or wrong, anything that is new because of their hatred of the boxes". Monteux believed that the trouble began when the two factions [...] began attacking each other, but their mutual anger was soon diverted towards the orchestra: [...] "Everything available was <b>tossed</b> <b>in</b> our direction, but we continued to play on". Around forty of the worst offenders were ejected—possibly with {{the intervention of the}} police, although this is uncorroborated. Through all the disturbances the performance continued without interruption. Things grew noticeably quieter during Part II, and by some accounts Maria Piltz's rendering of the final [...] "Sacrificial Dance" [...] was watched in reasonable silence. At the end there were several curtain calls for the dancers, for Monteux and the orchestra, and for Stravinsky and Nijinsky before the evening's programme continued.|$|E
500|$|Neurath {{had enjoyed}} {{role-playing}} video games like Wizardry, {{but found that}} their simple, abstract visuals were an obstacle to the suspension of disbelief. He believed that Dungeon Masters detailed first-person presentation was a [...] "glimpse into the future", and he sought to create a fantasy role-playing game that built on its example. In early 1990, Neurath wrote a design document for a game titled Underworld, which described such elements as [...] "goblins on the prows of rowboats <b>tossed</b> <b>in</b> the waves, shooting arrows at the player above on a rope bridge swinging in the wind." [...] He contracted former Origin employee Doug Wike to create concept art. Wike created a brief, hand-drawn animation with Deluxe Paint Animation, which depicted the game's interface and a creature moving toward the player. The animation defined the game's direction, and it {{was used as a}} reference point for the game's tone and features throughout development. That spring, Neurath founded the company Blue Sky Productions in Salem, New Hampshire, with the intention to create Underworld. Among the company's first employees was Doug Church, who was studying at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The team was thus composed of Doug Church as programmer, Doug Wike as lead artist and Paul Neurath as lead designer. Development began in May 1990.|$|E

500|$|The first {{third of}} the game was a tight {{scoreless}} pitcher's duel between Volquez and Bumgarner, with the latter needing to throw just 28 pitches – the fewest number of pitches he has ever <b>tossed</b> <b>in</b> three consecutive innings of any game in his career. [...] Only one batter – Giants' third baseman Pablo Sandoval – was able to advance as far as second base during this time. [...] The game remained tied until the fourth inning, when Volquez allowed two singles and a walk to load the bases. [...] The subsequent batter, Brandon Crawford, hit a grand slam. [...] This was the first grand slam hit by a shortstop in postseason history. [...] Up until this point, players from all other positions in baseball– including pitcher – had hit postseason grand slams. [...] Volquez pitched until {{the top of the}} sixth inning, when he gave up a walk and was replaced by Justin Wilson, who promptly threw a wild pitch. Wilson then allowed the inherited runner to score on a run batted in (RBI) single by Brandon Belt, who ended up driving in two more runs in the seventh inning with another single. [...] The Giants added their final run of the game with an RBI single by Buster Posey {{in the top of the}} eighth.|$|E
500|$|Rousseau's unknown fate in [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] {{was heavily}} {{discussed}} among critics. [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{felt that the}} relationship between Rousseau and Alex after their reunion remained unexplored, which made Rousseau's death a wasted opportunity for a powerful death scene. BuddyTV's Don Williams believed that Rousseau would survive, mainly because he had been waiting to see her flashback for four seasons, and thought her death would ensure it would not happen. Dan Compora from SyFy Portal was disappointed in her death scene, noting, [...] "I wasn't shocked to see Danielle get killed, but the scene felt like it was <b>tossed</b> <b>in</b> just in case this had to serve as the season finale." [...] Compora felt that Rousseau deserved more screen time in the episode leading up to her death. [...] The San Francisco Chronicles Tim Goodman described it as [...] "a rude and lazy {{way to get rid of}} Rousseau". John Kubicek, also of BuddyTV, found her death scene unsatisfactory, commenting, [...] "Then we have that entirely tacked on scene at the end which felt so artificial, like I accidentally flipped over to a different show. While I agree Danielle Rousseau being shot with an arrow is shocking, is this really what the show has come to? Arbitrarily putting a recurring character's life in peril to pose as a cliffhanger?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Compared to the mummies of Egypt, these mummies {{were simply}} buried without any long term or {{elaborate}} preparation. A preliminary {{observation of the}} mummies already reveals striking parallels with customs and rituals still practiced in present-day Lebanon. An adult woman was found buried with her eighteen-month-old child. The infant was placed at the mother's left shoulder. We are almost certain that the infant is hers since this method of burial is still practiced today in Lebanon when the deaths of both mother and child are caused by complications in the birthing process. Most interesting {{of all is the}} adult woman who is buried with her infant. She is found with pieces of cotton and cloth inserted in both her vaginal and anal orifices. This preparation of the deceased for viewing is still practiced to our day. In some areas of Lebanon such as the Bekaa Valley, the cotton and cloth pieces are wrapped around a small onion and inserted in the human orifices. Another cultural manifestation is the presence of long black human hair found between Yasmine's toes. It probably belonged to the child's mother. Local tradition has it, that the grieving mother will pull out her hair while kissing the feet of her lost child. A talismanic prayer recovered from the grotto requests the intercession of saints in curing a sick child. This prayer resembles the ones still in practice and use among the Maronites in present-day Lebanon, e.g.,. 'Kitab Mar Antonios' -- the Talisman of Saint Anthony of Qozhayya. A wooden house key was found on the body of one of the adult female mummies. In accordance with traditional customs, at the funeral of the last surviving member of a family, the key to the dead person's house will be tossed over the roof of that house indicating that the house of that family will forever be closed. In this case the person died in a besieged Grotto, so the key was <b>tossed</b> <b>in</b> the grave [...] similar circumstances mourners will comment by saying, [...] "pity this family, their house is forever closed." ...|$|E
