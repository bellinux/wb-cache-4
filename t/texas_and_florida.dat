5|$|The {{precursor}} disturbance to Arlene brought significant rainfall {{to parts}} of Central America, killing three people and triggering widespread flooding and landslides. Throughout Mexico, prolonged rains from Arlene and subsequent flooding affected hundreds of homes and several roads, causing many residents to seek shelter. At {{the height of the}} storm, power was lost to 285,000homes. At least 22people in Mexico were killed by Arlene. Elsewhere, rainfall from the storm alleviated ongoing drought conditions in southern <b>Texas</b> <b>and</b> <b>Florida.</b>|$|E

Nine players picked in the initial round were outfielders, while six catchers, four first basemen, and three shortstops were {{selected}}. The team also selected one player each at second base and third base. Thirteen of the 45 players came from high schools or universities in the state of California, while <b>Texas</b> <b>and</b> <b>Florida</b> follow, with six and five players, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The French did {{not fully}} comply with the {{commerce}} provisions of the Treaty of Utrecht. They attempted to prevent English trade with remote Indian tribes, and they erected Fort Niagara in Iroquois territory. French settlements continued to grow on the Gulf Coast, with the settlement of New Orleans in 1718 and other (unsuccessful) attempts to expand into Spanish-controlled <b>Texas</b> <b>and</b> <b>Florida.</b> French trading networks penetrated the continent along the waterways feeding the Gulf of Mexico, renewing conflicts with both the British and the Spanish. Trading networks established in the Mississippi River watershed, including the Ohio River valley, also brought the French into more contact with British trading networks and colonial settlements that crossed the Appalachian Mountains. Conflicting claims over that territory eventually led to war in 1754, when the French and Indian War broke out.|$|E

25|$|In the southeastern, central, and southwestern {{part of the}} United States, {{the adult}} C. rufifacies {{is one of the}} first insects to arrive on a fresh corpse. The adults {{normally}} arrive within the first 10 minutes after death. The larvae also have a shorter developmental time than other species, but because of their predatory nature, they can also alter entomological-based post mortem interval estimation. In <b>Texas</b> <b>and</b> <b>Florida,</b> the species emerges from corpses that are in an advanced stage of decomposition.|$|E
25|$|Human {{trafficking}} occurred consistently in high-population {{areas that}} serve as hubs for international travel and that have large immigrant populations.

According to the National Human Trafficking Resource Center (NHTRC) roughly 979,000 of the human trafficking cases reported by state are from California, making it the most affected area in the United States.|$|E

25|$|Since its opening, Lenox Square has {{undergone}} four major renovations and expansions. During {{the years following}} {{the opening of the}} shopping mall, several new retail centers opened up in several suburban locations, notably Perimeter Mall and Cumberland Mall. As a response to increasing competition, Lenox Square underwent a major renovation and expansion in the early 1970s that would have the entire shopping center enclosed. The renovation included a new wing and the addition of the first Neiman Marcus location outside of <b>Texas</b> <b>and</b> <b>Florida.</b> It is still to this day the company's only location in the state.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{reformatting}} of the NCAA Baseball Tournament in 1999, Tech and UGA have hosted eight super regionals – the fourthmost super regionals {{hosted by}} a state behind California, <b>Texas,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Florida.</b> The two teams have met six times in the NCAA tournament with Georgia holding a 4–2 edge over Tech. Georgia has eliminated Tech three times in tournament play in 1987, 2001, and 2008. Tech avenged the 2001 elimination by eliminating UGA in 2002. Tech and UGA's latest meeting in the 2008 NCAA tournament saw UGA sweep Tech in a two game series, which eliminated Tech from the tournament.|$|E
25|$|Sciurus carolinensis is {{native to}} the eastern and midwestern United States, and to the southerly {{portions}} of the eastern provinces of Canada. The native range of the eastern gray squirrel overlaps {{with that of the}} fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), with which it is sometimes confused, although the core of the fox squirrel's range is slightly more to the west. The eastern gray squirrel is found from New Brunswick to Manitoba, south to East <b>Texas</b> <b>and</b> <b>Florida.</b> Breeding eastern gray squirrels are found in Nova Scotia, but whether this population was introduced or came from natural range expansion is not known. It has also been introduced into Ireland, Britain, Italy, South Africa, and Australia (where it was extirpated by 1973). Eastern grey squirrels in Europe are a concern because they have displaced some of the native squirrels there.|$|E

25|$|Two iconic American {{stories have}} Spanish antecedents, too. Almost 80 years before John Smith's alleged rescue by Pocahontas, {{a man by}} the name of Juan Ortiz told of his remarkably similar rescue from {{execution}} by an Indian girl. Spaniards also held a thanksgiving—56 years before the famous Pilgrims festival—when they feasted near St. Augustine with Florida Indians, probably on stewed pork and garbanzo beans. As late as 1783, at the end of the American Revolutionary War, Spain held claim to roughly half of today's continental United States (see New Spain); in 1775, Spanish ships even reached Alaska. From 1819 to 1848, the United States and its army increased the nation's area by roughly a third at Spanish and Mexican expense, including today's three most populous states: California, <b>Texas,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Florida.</b> Hispanics became the first American citizens in the newly acquired Southwest territory and remained the ancestral majority in several states until the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|Verizon FiOS dropped The Weather Channel and {{its sister}} network Weatherscan from its lineup at 12:00a.m. Eastern Time on March 10, 2015 {{after the two}} parties were unable {{to come to terms}} on a new {{carriage}} agreement. The services have respectively been replaced by the AccuWeather Network (which launched on March 10) and a widget provided by FiOS featuring forecast content provided by WeatherBug. No public announcement was made regarding the removal until over 12 hours after TWC and Weatherscan were pulled. The Weather Channel offered a less expensive deal to Verizon FiOS, which rejected the offer. Verizon cited the wide availability of the internet and mobile apps for consumers to access weather content any time of day as the reason for dropping TWC and its services. It is unknown if Frontier FiOS customers in clusters formerly served by Verizon are affected, including (as of April 1, 2016) the recently acquired clusters from California, <b>Texas,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Florida.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{it grows}} {{in parts of}} California, Nevada, Arizona, <b>Texas</b> <b>and</b> <b>Florida,</b> the entire Mediterranean coast of Spain (very {{noticeable}} in the Valencian community, Balearic Islands and Andalusia.

It was introduced to Cape Town by Baron von Ludwig in about 1829. It is regarded as an invasive species in parts of South Africa and Queensland, Australia, the latter of which has had problems with the Blue Jacaranda preventing growth of native species. Lusaka, the capital of Zambia, and Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, also see the growth of many jacarandas.|$|E
