5|$|He’s {{had a huge}} role in my career. There’s {{no doubt}} about that. I value his opinion. But as a person, Salman has had the biggest impact on my life. I became friends with him when I was young. And his persona is very strong. If I were <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> see his impact on my life, it’s been tremendous.|$|E
25|$|It {{is strange}} <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> {{see how this}} frail-looking young man burst {{on the scene in}} 1953. We had sent Ken Joy, the former BBAR, to {{challenge}} for the Grand Prix des Nations, then 140 kilometres long, and dragging through the hills of the Chevreuse valley. All over Paris they talked about this burly Englishman who had ridden 160km in 4 hours and 6 minutes: and when it came to it, he was hammered by a 19-year-old, but a teenager with a will of iron that was to prove inflexible for the next 19 years.|$|E
500|$|By time Tunis had fallen, few Rhodesians {{remained}} with the First or Eighth Armies; most were transferring to the South African 6th Armoured Division, then in Egypt, or {{making their way}} home on leave. Out of the 300 Southern Rhodesians who had joined the KRRC in Egypt, only three officers and 109 other ranks remained {{at the end of}} the Tunisian Campaign. The Rhodesian Anti-Tank Battery retraced many of the movements it had taken during the campaign as it returned to Egypt. [...] "Left for Matruh at 0830 hours today," [...] one Rhodesian gunner wrote. [...] "Camped at night on the identical spot where we camped in June 1941. It gave me a queer feeling <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> think how many of us are missing." ...|$|E

500|$|On its release, Rebel Heart {{received}} positive critical reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns {{a weighted}} mean rating out of 100 to reviews by music critics, the album received an average score of 68, based on 29 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". The Daily Telegraph writer Neil McCormick, Andy Gill of The Independent, AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine, and Lauren Murphy of The Irish Times each gave the album 4 out of 5 stars. McCormick felt that [...] "(f)or {{the first time}} in years, [...] doesn't sound desperate", praising it in comparison to Hard Candy and MDNA. Saeed called it: [...] "a fine collection of sturdy pop tunes in which Madonna finally allows herself <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> sometimes pilfer from her peak periods of the late 80s and early 2000s". Murphy wrote [...] "the indisputable pop icon is back with a tentative bang" [...] after MDNA had [...] "few memorable pop hits". For Gill, the most impressive aspect of Rebel Heart was Madonna's vocals, while Erlewine found the album to be a revival of Madonna's defiant side and her confessional mood.|$|E
2500|$|David Campese once said, [...] "I want to {{be remembered}} like Barry John in Wales. I want people <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> say Campo did this, this and this." [...] After the 1991 Rugby World Cup former Welsh rugby great Barry John said, [...] "Like Pelé, he is {{associated}} with the very best and historic moments in sport; he has a special genius which shows an individual can still paint his own portrait and leave an indelible mark for all to treasure. The ingredients are all the same: stature, presence, personality, style and an immense belief in the God-given talents." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "For me, {{there will}} be days when I write a little poem in a little book, or make a little voice memo in my iPhone. For me, I need to be sitting at an {{instrument}} and be overwhelmed. I've tried <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> see if a song {{just came out of}} a sunny day. [...] "Oh, today I'm going to write a song." [...] That's never been the case for me. It's always whether I'm just overwhelmed with some emotion. Whether it be I'm happy, I'm sad, I've fallen in love, I've fallen out of love. I'm lonely, I'm scared. Whatever it be that day. If I'm like a volcano and I'm about to explode, I better run to an instrument because it's about to come out. For me, I don't really go back. I probably should. I have a bajillion pieces of songs. But I seem to just write in one sitting. There's very few occasions where I've gone back and worked on songs later. Normally, I sit down, the song comes out and I'm done." ...|$|E
5000|$|While {{promoting}} his album in September 2011, Carrigan {{said of the}} Thrills: [...] "We’re just on a hiatus. We haven’t done anything since 2008, when we toured Australia. We never split up, but we're all working on other projects. In time, I'm sure we'll get back together. It just got a bit crazy for a while because we were away from home, so we needed to take a break." [...] During an interview with Hot Press in late October 2011 Carrigan stated: [...] "It's like a past life now, the whole Thrills thing, to be honest. Which is kind of nice because it’s good to always feel like you’re moving forward as opposed <b>to</b> <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> wondering what might have been." ...|$|R

"We're more {{analytical}} about film today -- we {{have more}} history <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> on, <b>and</b> the cost of making movies is so high that it leaves less room for experimentation.

60|$|Chitterlow had had adventures, a quite {{astonishing}} {{variety of}} adventures in this direction; {{he was a}} man with a past, a really opulent past, and he certainly seemed to like <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> see himself amidst its opulence.|$|E
60|$|They did pull, {{and soon}} came {{closer to the}} craft ahead. Then the negro chanced <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> saw them. He was evidently chagrined, and with out delay turned in toward shore, close to where the trees grew thick.|$|E

60|$|For a brief space he {{had enjoyed}} {{some of the}} old zest of life in scheming for the freedom of his would-be murderer, in outwitting the police and press-men, and in {{achieving}} his own escape; but with all this secured, and in the safe seclusion of his room, he had leisure <b>to</b> <b>look</b> within himself and found himself the most miserable of men, utterly lonely, with failure <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> upon <b>and</b> nothing for which to hope.|$|R

60|$|Again Mirando's shrill cry of mortal terror {{had caused}} them <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> there {{they had seen}} the most horrible sight--their companion's body flying upwards into the trees, {{his arms and legs}} beating the air and his tongue {{protruding}} from his open mouth.
