Its first edition was printed in August 1643, and then a much expanded, also unlicensed second edition came out in 1644. Editors debate how to present The Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce to modern readers, since the second edition's amplifications nearly characterise it as a separate argument, and a less personal one at that. Though Milton's full name appeared on neither title page, he did sign the epistle [...] "To <b>the</b> <b>Parlament</b> of England" [...] added to the second edition. He was denounced in a sermon given before Parliament in August 1644 by preacher Herbert Palmer, and was rebuked by others including William Prynne in print.

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the seventies there was initiated in Yugoslavia a program aimed at preparation of changes of the economy's functioning system. These changes in their basic assumptions constituted a continuation of the policy course launched in 1950, while as regards their detailed solutions they were aimed at cushioning or elimination of irregularities which appeared in the Yugoslav economy after 1965.

In the article there are analyzed those system changes which directly determine character of the national economy's functioning. The essence of these changes consists in introduction of the so-called basic organizations of associated labour as a form of consolidation of self-government relationships (institutional condition of implementation of the direct workers'self-government), provision of a legal basis for the so-called social and self-government agreements as an instrument of central management of the economy (solution aimed at consolidation of obligatory nature of indirect instruments of the economy management), recognition of integration of companies as an essential prerequisite of effective implementation of the above mentioned institutional solutions (the more advanced the integration processes the wider the subject scope of self-government decisions and the smaller the scale of difficulties in conclusion of agreements between economic subjects at various levels of the organizational macrostructure — social agreements — agreements between companies — self-government agreements).

40|$|Vlada Republike Hrvatske donijela je 11. 3. 1993. Socijalni program čiji je cilj pomoć socijalno ugroženim građanima. U proteklom je razdoblju u našoj zemlji došlo do mnogih značajnih gospodarskih, socijalnih i drugih promjena. Sukladno tome i sam je Socijalni program u stanovitoj mjeri revidiran, tako da neki prvotni elementi tog programa nisu realizirani, dok su se drugi djelomice transformirali, a neki su naknadno – tijekom njegove provedbe, ugrađeni u nj. Pri tome valja imati na umu da Socijalni program i nije bio zamišljen kao nepromjenjiv i statičan. Naime, još pri njegovoj izradi nametnula se ideja da Program mora, radi uspješnosti i učinkovitosti, biti elastičan i prilagodljiv zbiljskim gospodarskim i socijalnim prilikama, tj. da se neke njegove sastavnice mogu i moraju mijenjati i usklađivati prema novonastalim okolnostima.

Inflation has been curbed and the economy is heading towards gradual growth. In order to protect the living standard of the socially most threatened groups within the population, the Government will proceed by putting into practice and extending the Social Programme, which affects various fields of social security with special emphasis on the development component which means encouraging investment and employment. The public sector is no longer deficitary financed given to a restrictive fiscal and income policy, which also requires maximum rationalization and saving. The most important task of the social welfare is to secure the satisfaction of the basic living requirements of all persons incapable of achieving it through work, property rights, family solidarity or in any other way. Approximately 400, 000 persons or 8 % of the population are receiving different types of social assistance from the state or humanitarian sources.
