He is {{attacked}} {{on the way}} by the shadow, which destroys his staff, but Ged escapes into the Court of Terrenon. Serret, {{the lady of the}} castle, shows him <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> of Terrenon, and tempts Ged to speak to it, claiming it can give him limitless knowledge and power. Believing <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> harbors an evil spirit, Ged refuses. Realizing that the servants of <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> wish to enslave him, he flees. He is pursued by the stone's minions but transforms into a falcon and flies away.|$|E
5|$|Queens of <b>the</b> <b>Stone</b> Age (also {{known as}} QOTSA) {{was formed in}} 1997 by guitarist and vocalist Josh Homme (formerly of Kyuss) under the name Gamma Ray.

In 1998, the band released its full-length debut, Queens of <b>the</b> <b>Stone</b> Age. The band subsequently signed with Interscope Records and released its first album for a major label, Rated R, which became the first Queens of <b>the</b> <b>Stone</b> Age album to chart.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{annotation}} of <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> is in {{a church}} inventory from 1829, and it says that <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> was illegible. Ljungström documented in 1861 {{that it was in}} the rock fence with the inscription facing the cemetery. When Djurklou visited <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> in 1869, it was still in the same spot. Djurklou considered its placement to be unhelpful because a part of the runic band was buried in the soil, so he commanded an honourable farmer to select a group of men and remove <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> from the wall. The next time Djurklou visited the location, he found <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> raised in the cemetery.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>stone's</b> name, <b>The</b> Piper's <b>Stones,</b> is {{believed}} to have derived from a local folk tale that said those caught dancing there on a Sunday would turn to <b>stone,</b> with <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> representing such revellers. An outlying <b>stone</b> on <b>the</b> north east represents the piper. There is an old hawthorn tree growing around <b>the</b> <b>stone's</b> circumference, this tree is associated with fairies and other folklore.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>stone</b> circles {{have been}} studied since John Aubrey's visit in 1664 with some {{excavations}} of the site in the 18th century.

The Cove {{has been shown to}} be around one thousand years older than <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> circles, so dating from 4000-3000 BCE. A variety of myths and legends about <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> circles have been recorded, including one about dancers at a celebration who have been turned to stone.|$|E
5|$|According to some scholars, the Black Stone was {{the same}} stone that Islamic {{tradition}} describes as greeting Muhammad before his prophethood. This led to a debate about whether the Black Stone's greeting comprised actual speech or merely a sound, and following that, whether <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> was a living creature or an inanimate object. Whichever was the case, <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> was held to be a symbol of prophethood.|$|E
5|$|After Napoleon's departure, French troops {{held off}} British and Ottoman attacks for another 18 months. In March 1801, the British landed at Aboukir Bay.

5|$|Coatbridge {{was given}} burgh status in 1885, and {{was granted a}} coat of arms by the Lord Lyon in 1892. The arms have a black field and on it a flaming tower to {{represent}} a blast furnace and Coatbridge's industrial tradition. The crest is a monk holding a stone in his left hand. <b>The</b> <b>stone</b> relates to the old parish of Monklands and {{the legend of the}} 'aul' Kirk stane'. The legend of the 'aul' Kirk stane' is that a pilgrim undertaking a penance from Glasgow carried a stone in the direction of Monklands. When he could carry <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> no further (or in another version of the legend, when an angel spoke to him) he laid <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> down. It was where <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> came to rest that he was to build a church. The church is the present day Old Monkland Kirk, at which <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> can still be seen.|$|E

5|$|In 1861, a stone {{addition}} to the original 1774 Georgian structure was built. The large stone blocks used {{for the construction of}} the addition were quarried from the plantation's Mill Creek Mountain, a ridge located across the South Branch Potomac River {{to the west of the}} mansion. <b>The</b> <b>stone</b> blocks were hewed by sawyers, then transported across the river to the mansion, and lifted upon the addition's scaffolding with wheelbarrows.

25|$|About {{one third}} of <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> in <b>the</b> museum are Class II in nature (stones with symbols carved in relief and usually bearing a Christian cross). Most of <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> date to <b>the</b> 9th or 10th century AD and were {{intended}} as tombstones. <b>The</b> <b>stones</b> are carved from the local sandstone, which is suitable for fine sculpture. Some stylistic elements of <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> show <b>the</b> influence of Northumbria. <b>The</b> Pictish <b>stones</b> at Meigle have a distinct local style that includes an emphasis on aggressive biting beasts, the decorating of crosses with a diagonal key pattern and the usage of rounded heads on cross-slabs.|$|R
50|$|When a {{stone is}} touched when stones are in play, the {{remedies}} vary between placing <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> as {{they end up}} after the touch, replacing <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> {{as they would have}} been if no stone were touched, or removal of <b>the</b> touched <b>stone</b> from play.

5|$|Pastor H.J. Pedersen, {{like most}} early pastors in the synod, had {{received}} his training in a folk school, {{and he was}} convinced that the success of the new congregation and colony depended on the establishment of such a Danish-speaking folk school. Danebod Folk School opened December1, 1888, with Pedersen as president. Other teachers were Carl Hansen and Christian Hansen. Among the first students were Niels Petersen and Kristian Klink, both Danish immigrants. Klink was a stonemason educated in Denmark, and he helped pastor Pedersen in building <b>the</b> <b>Stone</b> Hall. It was built of native rock. Farmers hauled rocks from the shores of Swan Lake just south of Danebod, and Klink and his helpers split and shaped the rocks. <b>The</b> <b>Stone</b> Hall was finished in the fall of 1889, and the first public gathering in <b>the</b> <b>Stone</b> Hall was at Klink's funeral in November 1889. <b>The</b> <b>Stone</b> Hall quickly became the center of the new colony, and Sunday services were conducted here, as well as numerous weddings, baptisms and funerals. The students at the Danebod Folk School used the building as a gym hall, and young people would meet here to socialize, meet up with friends, and participate in singing games. Three years later, <b>the</b> <b>Stone</b> Hall was now too small for worship services. It was decided to build a new church, and the Cross Church at Danebod was dedicated on Sunday, June16, 1895.|$|E

5000|$|McGlashen Stones / Atlas Stones - Five heavy round stones {{increasing}} in weight from 220 - 350 lb are lifted and set on platforms. When <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> were first {{introduced to the}} competition, it was an individual event and the platforms were all of equal height. <b>The</b> modern Atlas <b>Stones</b> event takes place on a 16 - 33 ft long course and the competitors participate two at a time. There are three current variations to <b>the</b> Atlas <b>Stones</b> event. In one, <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> are placed {{directly in front of}} the platforms and the competitors must simply lift and place them, generally <b>the</b> lightest <b>stone</b> being placed on the highest platform. In another, <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> are placed in a diagonal line, with <b>the</b> first <b>stone</b> being in front of the first platform, and each subsequent stone is set farther back from the course, with <b>the</b> heaviest <b>stone</b> being farthest away (or vice versa). The third variation sees the five platforms in a straight vertical line with <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> in front of each, and the competitors must place <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> and then move a short distance to the next one. In recent competitions, this is typically the final event. In the 2015 competition, <b>the</b> maximum <b>stone</b> was 209 kilos(461lbs) ...|$|R
