It was a chain running alternately over and under a sequence of pulleys on movable shafts. The chain was fixed at one end, and the other (free) end was weighted to keep it taut. As each shaft moved up or down it would take up or release a corresponding length of the chain. The movements in position of the free (movable) end of the chain represented the sum of the movements of the different shafts. The movable end was kept taut, and fitted with a pen and a moving band of paper on which the pen plotted a <b>tidal</b> <b>curve.</b> In some designs, the movable end of the line was connected instead to a dial and scale from which tidal heights could be read off.|$|E

Also, in the real Thomson machines, to save on motion and wear of the other parts, the shaft and pulley with the largest expected motion (for the M2 tide component at twice per lunar day) was mounted nearest to the pen, and the shaft and pulley representing the smallest component was at the other end, nearest to the point of fixing of the flexible cord or chain, to minimize unnecessary motion in the most part of the flexible cord.|$|E

A slight amplitude increase towards the head of the bay was obtained, presumably due to shoaling effects. The high correlation between sea level variations at selected coastal tide stations and model results suggests the dependence on tidal forcing at the mouth. Strongest tidal velocities were found at the mouth and decreased towards the head of the bay. The wind-driven component of the flow using mean September 1995 wind forcing shows the presence of two asymmetrical, counter-rotating gyres.

40|$|AbstractAn {{attempt is}} made to study a {{nonlinear}} mathematical model for the description of tidal flow propagation at the confluence of two tidal rivers. The model so developed requires no additional approximations than what is usually accepted {{in the case of}} a single channel without branching. To illustrate the effectiveness of the model, the flow conditions at the confluence of the river Hooghly and the river Rupnarain have been determined. The explicit finite difference scheme is used for its simple mathematical formulation and easy computer programming, also keeping in mind the sharp turn-over of the <b>tidal</b> <b>curves</b> of the Hooghly and the Rupnarain, which is difficult to be reproduced using the implicit finite difference schemes. It is of interest to note that not only the junction of two rivers but also of any number of rivers can easily be simulated with this method.

The accuracy of tidal computation is verified by checking the results of the model against the data observed in the above-mentioned river system...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a {{mechanism by which}} the tide, forcing a coastal water body, produces an oscillation at the natural period of the water body - a seiche - {{around the time of}} high water. The seiche appears as a distortion in the <b>tidal</b> <b>curve</b> which can, under certain conditions, produce a double high water. The formation of the seiche is explored with a numerical simulation of a sea strait, forced by the tide at its open ends. A seiche, of wavelength equal to twice the length of the strait, is formed when the mean depth of the strait is similar to the tidal range: the rapid reduction of friction as high water is approached appears to be {{an important part of the}} formation process. Observations of water level in the centre of a shallow sea strait in north Wales confirm that there is a residual oscillation around high water with the form of a damped seiche. The crest of the seiche occurs just before, and the trough just after, the maximum in the fitted <b>tidal</b> <b>curve.</b> The seiche slows the fall of the tide after high water and on one occasion, at neap tides, the fall is reversed and a double high water is formed. It is possible that this mechanism, hitherto unidentified, contributes to the formation of double high waters in other shallow coastal locations...|$|E

In order to investigate the behaviors of tidal currents in this sea area after con-struction of the breakwater and the reclaimed lands, hydraulic model experiments havebeen carried out in laminar regime.

40|$|SYNOPSIS. Functional {{challenges}} can differ among life-history stages, yet {{performance at}} one stage {{may be linked}} to the outcome of performance at others. For example, adult performance, in terms of the location or timing of reproduction in response to environmental signals, can set conditions that affect the performance of developmental stages. In marine invertebrates, however, early performance has been studied primarily in the laboratory. I outline an integrative approach to the study of field reproductive performance in a marine gastropod that undergoes development in intertidal habitats. Embryos within gelatinous masses experience high variability in development temperature and frequent exposure to thermal stress. In labo-ratory experiments, developmental performance was measured as a function of maximum temperature (Tmax) experienced during fluctuations that mimicked field <b>tidal</b> profiles. Performance <b>curves</b> showed declines that coincided with temperature thresholds for heat shock protein (Hsp) expression, a signal of cellular stress. Application of laboratory results to field records of Tmax predicted large variation in the survival of embryos deposited on different days. Timing of field reproduction was non-random with respect to Tmax, suggesting that adults could help to buffer embryos from environmental stress. Embryo survival, however, was not predicted to benefit from the non-random pattern of adult reproduction. Adults may be constrained to respond to information that only weakly predicts conditions that embryos will experience. Studies that incorporate linkages between life cycle stages in the field may better reveal how performance capacities and constraints at one stage can influence performance and selection at others...|$|R

30|$|This paper extends and detides a Karachi tide-gauge {{record as}} an {{observational}} basis for assessing Indian Ocean tsunami risk. The extended marigram encompasses {{the time of}} the great 1945 Makran earthquake of early November 28, local time, and of the ensuing tsunami, which continued into November 29. The marigram was published previously as a 9 -h excerpt that begins 1  h after the earthquake. The full marigram presented here covers most of 17  days from November 15 to December 1. Gaps include a tsunami-induced outage that may help explain why the highest water level gauged is 1  m below the maximum water level reported nearby. The detiding method computes a reference <b>tidal</b> <b>curve</b> that disregards all observations from November 28 and 29. For those 2  days, the reference tide is guided by Admiralty tide tables and, secondarily, by high waters and low waters gauged before and after. As in previous estimates, the detided tsunami crests about 0.5  m above ambient tide, but now with the possibility that the gauge failed to record a higher wave. Anomalies described for the first time include an early one that likely resulted from a recognized problem with the Karachi tide station, but which might instead represent an earthquake precursor.|$|E
40|$|Intertidal {{areas in}} {{estuaries}} play a multi-functional role, from energy dissipation and mitigation of floods over provision of natural habitat to a contribution in the cycling and recycling of nutrients. Many of these intertidal {{areas have been}} claimed for urban, agricultural or industrial expansion.

In this paper we investigate the possibility to combine {{the concept of a}} flood control area (FCA) with nature development and the functions of intertidal areas, by use of simple sluice constructions to introduce a controlled reduced tide (CRT). Model results show the possibility to introduce acceptable tidal influence in FCAs. Nevertheless there are major differences with tidal characteristics of natural outer dike marshes: the spring-neap tidal range is strongly reduced, the <b>tidal</b> <b>curve</b> flattened. Also the relation between inundation time (IT) and inundation frequency (IF) shows strong distortion compared to the natural situation, with roughly doubled inundation times as compared with a natural outer dike marsh.

40|$|We use {{a simple}} {{framework}} {{to calculate the}} time evolution of {{the composition of the}} fallback material onto a supermassive black hole arising from the tidal disruption of main sequence stars. We study stars with masses between 0. 8 and 3. 0 M_, at evolutionary stages from zero-age main sequence to terminal-age main sequence, built using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics code. We show that most stars develop enhancements in nitrogen (^ 14 N) and depletions in carbon (^ 12 C) and oxygen (^ 16 O) over their lifetimes, and that these features are more pronounced for higher mass stars. We find that, in an accretion-powered tidal disruption flare, these features become prominent only after the time of peak of the fallback rate and appear at earlier times for stars of increasing mass. We postulate that no severe compositional changes resulting from the fallback material should be expected near peak {{for a wide range of}} stellar masses and, as such, are unable to explain the extreme helium-to-hydrogen line ratios observed in some TDEs. On the other hand, the resulting compositional changes could help explain the presence of nitrogen-rich features, which are currently only detected after peak. When combined with the shape of the light curve, the time evolution of the composition of the fallback material provides a clear method to help constrain the nature of the disrupted star.

Tidal curves were produced from the raw data collected and added to a data set from a study that was previously carried out on the same estuary but at alternate locations. The results were analyzed against a local tide gauge near the mouth of the estuary which was used as a control. Analysis showed that distortion of the tidal wave occurred as it entered the estuary and continued increasing distortion was observed with its travel up the course of the estuary. The distortion found was representative of a saw toothed <b>tidal</b> <b>curve.</b> An offset in the time that high tide occurred was found to have a relationship related to distance from the control. The high tide heights varied throughout the locations showing a slight trend of increasing height with distance up the estuary, but more recordings would be required to conclude a definitive relationship.

40|$|Understanding {{the effect}} of {{physical}} forcing on estuarine functioning is of major importance to determine the rate of exchange of water, sediments, pollutants and nutrients between the continent and the ocean. The combination of numerical models and discrete datasets is used to describe and investigate processes of natural variability in the partially-mixed, non-turbid, macrotidal Solent-Southampton Water estuarine system (UK). The estuarine circulation and the response of wind forcing is examined using a three dimensional, free surface, finite volume and finite element grid model. Results from short-term (three months) simulations have been compared against data (ADCP measurements, tidal elevations and salinity distributions) collected in spring 2001 in Southampton Water and the Solent. The model reproduces the unique <b>tidal</b> <b>curve</b> of Southampton Water and the partially-mixed conditions prevailing in the upper estuary. The contribution of the local wind forcing (wind intensity · 12 m s− 1) to changes in water level {{is estimated to be}} up to 6 cm in Southampton Water in the model. The modelled salinity stratification varies over a semi-diurnal cycle with the highest stratification occuring at mid-ebb. Wind forcing is more efficient in altering stratification at ebb than flood. The temporal and spatial variability of light attenuation is also investigated. Turbidity is demonstrated to be the major contribution to light attenuation using a time-series of discrete data collected in 2001, 2002 and 2003. A typical seasonal cycle of the coefficient of light attenuation is revealed, with a minimum in May-June and a maximum occuring in September-October. A second dataset of continuous measurements (10 -minute interval) demonstrates the spring-neap modulation of the turbidity. The mouth of Southampton Water is more exposed to tidal mixing and therefore more turbid than the mid-estuary. A five-compartment zero-dimensional pelagic ecosystem model including a sediment compartment has been developed {{to assess the impact of}} the variability of the light attenuation on the timing and the magnitude of the spring phytoplankton bloom. Using high resolution irradiance forcing and a constant coefficient of attenuation k set to the minimum May-June value, simulations compare well with discrete data of chlorophyll a, and less successfully with zooplankton and Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen. A sensitivity analysis indicates that interranual variability in the phytoplankton spring bloom originates in order of importance from 1) parameterization of k 2) the variation of the seasonal cycle of surface irradiance 3) the intrinsic dynamics determined by the combination of fixed parameters of the ecosystem model.

40|$|Although infant lung {{function}} (ILF) testing is widely practiced in developed Western countries {{it is not}} typically performed in Eastern countries, and lung measurements are scarce for Asian infants. Therefore, this study aimed to establish normal reference values for Taiwanese infants. Full-term infants without any chronic diseases and major anomalies {{were enrolled in the}} Prediction of Allergies in Taiwanese Children (PATCH) cohort study. Detailed medical data, such as body weight and length, birth history, and histories of previous illness and hospitalization were recorded. Lung function measurements such as analysis of tidal breathing, passive respiratory mechanics, and forced <b>tidal</b> expiratory flow-volume <b>curves</b> were obtained through Jaeger Masterscreen BabyBody Paediatrics System. Multiple linear analyses were performed to determine various parameters of the {{lung function}} tests. ILF test parameters were collected from 126 infants, and 189 tests were performed. The results revealed that the ratio of time to peak expiratory flow to total expiratory time, the ratio of volume to peak expiratory flow to total expiratory volume, and the ratio of inspiratory time to total respiratory time remained relatively constant despite differences in age. However, body length is the strongest independent variable influencing tidal volume, respiratory rate, resistance, compliance, and maximal expiratory flow at functional residual capacity. According to our review of relevant literature, this is the first study to establish a reference data of ILF tests in the Asian population. This study provided reference values and regression equations for several variables of lung function measurements in healthy infants aged less than 2 years. With these race-specific reference data, ILF can more precisely and efficiently diagnose respiratory diseases in infants of Chinese ethnicity...|$|R
