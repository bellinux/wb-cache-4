5|$|Chase was {{promoted}} to Brigadier General in March 1943 on assuming command of the 1st Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division. He was chosen to lead {{the assault on the}} Admiralty Islands in February 1944. He resisted <b>the</b> <b>temptation</b> <b>to</b> swiftly overrun the island, and thereby overextend his forces, and formed a defensive perimeter that made good use of the terrain. From this position, he was able to defeat a series of counterattacks by the numerically superior Japanese garrison.|$|E
5|$|And {{where in}} modern {{dramatic}} literature can such pearls be matched—Julie incoherently confessing to her dead lover the love {{she had always}} been ashamed to tell; Liliom crying out to the distant carousel the glad news that he is to be a father; the two thieves gambling for the spoils of their prospective robbery; Marie and Wolf posing for their portrait while the broken-hearted Julie stands looking after the vanishing Liliom, the thieves' song ringing in her ears; the two policemen grousing about pay and pensions while Liliom lies bleeding to death; Liliom furtively proffering his daughter the star he has stolen for her in heaven.... <b>The</b> <b>temptation</b> <b>to</b> count the whole scintillating string is difficult to resist.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Hobbits’ fears, Faramir {{was wise}} {{enough to realize that}} such a weapon was not to be used and if desired, should be resisted. With this knowledge, he also {{realized}} what his brother had to face, and wished that he had gone on the quest himself — knowing that Boromir {{would not have been able}} to resist <b>the</b> <b>temptation</b> <b>to</b> seize the Ring for himself. Giving the Hobbits provisions, he sent them on their way to continue their quest, but warned Frodo that their guide, Gollum, was a treacherous creature, and that an unknown terror lived in Cirith Ungol, where Gollum was leading them.|$|E

5|$|In September 2011, the Indian media {{reported}} that Mahesh Bhatt and Bhushan Kumar were keen {{to remake the}} 1990 musical blockbuster Aashiqui. Kumar approached Bhatt for a possible sequel, although it was Shagufta Rafique's melodramatic romantic script which persuaded him that the film had potential as a sequel and decided {{to proceed with the}} project. Given Aashiqui 's status in Hindi cinematic history as one of the finest Indian musicals of all time, many expressed concerns towards the decision to remake the film, dubious that the producers could come up with a soundtrack on par with the quality of the 1990 film. Bhatt stated that they completely resisted <b>the</b> <b>temptation</b> <b>to</b> use the soundtrack of the earlier film, and promised that Aashiqui 2 would revive the era of melodious film music, as Aashiqui had done 22 years ago.|$|E
5|$|The Dark Tower reveals more of Flagg’s background, {{relating}} that he {{was born}} Walter Padick in Delain to Sam the Miller of Eastar’d Barony. At age 13 Walter set out for a life on the road, but was raped by a fellow wanderer; author Bev Vincent hypothesized in The Road to the Dark Tower that Flagg's later actions towards Delain in The Eyes of the Dragon may have been revenge for the abuse he suffered as a child. Resisting <b>the</b> <b>temptation</b> <b>to</b> crawl back home, Padick instead moves towards his destiny; he learns various forms of magic, achieving a quasi-immortality. After centuries of wreaking havoc Flagg attracts {{the attention of the}} Crimson King, who adopts him as his emissary.|$|E
5|$|Violet Clay (1978) and A Mother and Two Daughters (1982) {{are each}} about an {{unmarried}} protagonist's career in a creative profession. In A Mother and Two Daughters {{the main character}} resists <b>the</b> <b>temptation</b> <b>to</b> get married and chooses instead to focus on her work. A Mother and Two Daughters and A Southern Family (1987) each depend heavily on a southern setting and employ themes traditionally associated with social problems in the South. Some of their themes include racial discrimination, social-economic class and the cultural differences between generations. Many characters struggle to reduce {{the gap between the}} rich and poor or try to break free from a dominant cultural tradition, with mixed success.|$|E

Born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, Street was the first member of <b>the</b> <b>Temptations</b> <b>to</b> {{actually}} be a native of the city which served as Motown's namesake and hometown; all of the previous members were born and at least partially raised in the southern United States.|$|R

5|$|The 1st Cavalry Division {{arrived in}} Australia and {{continued}} its training at Strathpine, Queensland. Training {{there was more}} vigorous than at Fort Bliss, and Chase broke his heel bone in a training accident. In December 1943, the 1st Cavalry Division sailed for Oro Bay, where it staged for its next operation, the Admiralty Islands campaign. Chase was chosen to lead the assault. Here, his tactical expertise came to the fore. He resisted <b>the</b> <b>temptation</b> <b>to</b> overrun the island of Los Negros, and thereby overextend his forces, and instead formed a defensive perimeter that made good use of the terrain. From this position, {{he was able to}} defeat a series of counterattacks by the numerically superior Japanese garrison. The crisis passed, Chase's force was reinforced {{by the rest of the}} division, and the 1st Cavalry Division was then able to overrun the islands. Chase was awarded the Bronze Star for his role in the campaign.|$|E
5|$|The 1969–70 season {{opened with}} {{victory in the}} 1969 FA Charity Shield, as Bremner captained Leeds to a 2–1 victory over Manchester City. With new arrival Allan Clarke played upfront {{alongside}} Mick Jones and Peter Lorimer Revie had to instruct Bremner and Giles to resist <b>the</b> <b>temptation</b> <b>to</b> get forward and attack. It took the team some time to gel, as only two wins came from the opening eight league games, and Leeds eventually finished a distant second to champions Everton. They chased Everton all season only {{to give up on}} the title after a home defeat by Southampton late in the campaign. In the European Cup Leeds recorded a club record 10–0 win over Norwegian side Lyn, with Bremner netting two of the goals. However they exited the competition at the semi-final stage after two defeats to Celtic; Bremner levelled the aggregate score by putting United 1–0 ahead in front of a competition record 136,505 spectators at Hampden Park, but Celtic came back to win the game and the tie with two second half goals. Further disappointment came in the 1970 FA Cup Final, where Leeds were beaten 2–1 in extra-time of the replay at Old Trafford. Bremner was named as FWA Footballer of the Year for the season.|$|E
25|$|Madame Nhu {{arrived in}} the United States on 7 October, and her arrival was greeted by the United Nations' {{launching}} of an inquiry into the repression of Buddhists in South Vietnam.

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2000, rumours were rife over his future, with Scottish club Celtic among one of the clubs named as a {{potential}} destination. <b>The</b> <b>temptation</b> <b>to</b> manage another World Cup-bound international team proved irresistible to him, however, as he agreed to coach the South Korean national football team on 1 January 2001.|$|E
25|$|According to {{tradition}} (already attested {{at the end}} of the 13th century), one night St. Francis, feeling <b>the</b> <b>temptation</b> <b>to</b> abandon his way of life, rolled naked in the bramble thorns in an attempt to overcome doubt and temptation. In contact with his body, the bramble bushes turned into dog roses without thorns. Since then, the dog rose cultivar Rosa canina assisiensis has been grown in the garden.|$|E
25|$|The Portuguese {{army had}} been modernized in 1762 by William, Count of Schaumburg-Lippe but the army's {{administration}} soon became corrupt. Colonels and captains collected pay and supplies {{from the government}} for their soldiers. But <b>the</b> <b>temptation</b> <b>to</b> profit from this arrangement proved irresistible. The poorly paid officers often pocketed funds for soldiers {{who were on the}} muster rolls but absent or non-existent. Graft and embezzlement led to understrength units, cavalrymen without horses, and regimental depots without supplies.|$|E
50|$|In May 1971, <b>the</b> <b>Temptations</b> {{finally found}} a {{permanent}} replacement for the first tenor position in twenty-year-old Baltimore native Damon Harris.

However, good acts are rewarded by increases in the character's spiritual barometer, which affect the chances of the player destroying AM in the final adventure. Conversely, evil acts are punished by lowering the character's spiritual barometer.|$|E
25|$|After his conviction, Castor disappeared. Seven months later, he {{was found}} while visiting the Auto Show at the Anhembi Convention Center in São Paulo on October 26, 1994.

When that happens, the state grows faster, and the economy can collapse under its weight unless the state is rolled back (New Zealand is a recent example that comes to mind)." ...|$|R
25|$|Qadis (Judges) were {{appointed}} at all administrative levels {{for the administration}} of justice. The Qadis were chosen for their integrity and learning in Islamic law.

The Qadis were not allowed to engage in trade. Judges were appointed in sufficient number, and there was no district which did not have a Qadi.|$|E
25|$|The year 1812 {{seems to}} have been the last in which Hazlitt persisted seriously in his {{ambition}} to make a career as a painter. Although he had demonstrated some talent, the results of his most impassioned efforts always fell far short of the very standards he had set by comparing his own work with the productions of such masters as Rembrandt, Titian, and Raphael. It did not help that, when painting commissioned portraits, he refused to sacrifice his artistic integrity to <b>the</b> <b>temptation</b> <b>to</b> flatter his subjects for remunerative gain. The results, not infrequently, failed to please their subjects, and he consequently failed to build a clientele.|$|E
25|$|His {{last years}} were saddened not merely {{by the death}} of many of his closest friends, but by {{increasing}} ill-health. This did not interfere with the quality of his literary work; he was rarely idle and some of his latest work is among his best. But he indulged <b>the</b> <b>temptation</b> <b>to</b> alter his work repeatedly, and many of his later alterations are not improvements. Towards the end of 1585 his health deteriorated, and he seems to have moved restlessly from one of his houses to another for some months. When the end came, which, though in great pain, he met in a resolute and religious manner, he was at his priory of Saint-Cosme in Touraine, and he was buried in the church of that name on Friday, 27 December 1585.|$|E

60|$|The father--a {{learned and}} busy man--was so {{occupied}} by the duties of his large parish, or so absorbed in the abstruse studies to which his brief leisure was devoted, {{that he had no}} time left for his children.
