5|$|The county prefects {{and city}} and {{municipal}} mayors are elected to four-year terms by majority of votes cast within applicable local government units. A runoff election is held if no candidate achieves {{a majority in}} the first round of voting. Members of county, city, and municipal councils are elected to four-year terms through proportional representation; the entire local government unit forms a single constituency. The number of council members is defined by the councils themselves based on applicable legislation. Electoral committees are then tasked with determining whether the national minorities are represented in the council as required by the constitution. If <b>the</b> <b>minorities</b> are not represented, further members, who belong to <b>the</b> <b>minorities</b> and who have not been elected through the proportional representation system, are selected from electoral candidate lists and added to the council.|$|E

5|$|As {{with most}} of the {{principles}} adopted by the League, <b>the</b> <b>Minorities</b> Treaties were a part of the Wilsonian idealist approach to international relations, and as with the League itself, the Minority Treaties were increasingly ignored by the respective governments, with the entire system mostly collapsing in the late 1930s. Despite the political failure they remained the basis of international law. After World War II the legal principles were incorporated in the UN Charter and a host of international human rights treaties.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>minority</b> {{leader of}} Parliament {{is a member}} of Parliament who is elected by members of <b>the</b> <b>minority</b> parties in Parliament to act as their leader. <b>The</b> <b>Minority</b> leader of Parliament is always from <b>the</b> largest <b>minority</b> party in Parliament and is the main {{opposition}} to the majority or ruling party. <b>The</b> <b>minority</b> leader keeps member of <b>the</b> <b>minority</b> parties in order, usually to oppoose a bill supported by members of the majority or ruling party.

5|$|In addition, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the GRC scheme merely provides an appearance of a united, multiracial Parliament.

5|$|At first, the revolutionaries {{used the}} {{constitutional}} machinery {{of the old}} confederal republic. They resumed where they had left off after the purge in 1787 of Patriot regents, taking over {{the offices of the}} Orangist regents that were now purged in their turn. Though the political make-up of the States-General changed appreciably because of this change in personnel, it retained a number of defenders of the old particularist interests. The first order of business of the revolutionaries therefore was to strive for the reform of the confederal state, with its discrimination of the Generality Lands, and of particular minorities (Catholics, Jews), {{in the direction of a}} unitary state, in which <b>the</b> <b>minorities</b> would be emancipated, and the old entrenched interests superseded by a more democratic political order. As a first step the representatives of Brabant were admitted to the States-General.|$|E
5|$|In about 1500 the Scottish monarchy {{turned to}} the {{recording}} of royal likenesses in panel portraits. More impressive are the works or artists imported from the continent, particularly the Netherlands. The tradition of royal portrait painting in Scotland was probably disrupted by <b>the</b> <b>minorities</b> and regencies it underwent {{for much of the}} sixteenth century, but it flourished after the Reformation. James VI employed Flemish artists Arnold Bronckorst and Adrian Vanson, who have left behind a visual record of the king and major figures at the court. The first significant native artist was George Jamesone, who was succeeded by a series of portrait painters as the fashion moved down the social scale to lairds and burgesses.|$|E

5|$|The {{tradition}} of royal portrait painting in Scotland was probably disrupted by <b>the</b> <b>minorities</b> and regencies it underwent {{for much of}} the sixteenth century. In his majority James V was probably more concerned with architectural expressions of royal identity. Mary Queen of Scots had been brought up in the French court, where she was drawn and painted by major European artists, but she did not commission any adult portraits, {{with the exception of the}} joint portrait with her second husband Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley. This may have reflected an historic Scottish pattern, where heraldic display, or an elaborate tomb were considered more important than a portrait.|$|E
5|$|The loss of ecclesiastical {{patronage}} {{created a}} crisis for native craftsmen and artists, who turned to secular patrons. One {{result of this}} was the flourishing of Scottish Renaissance painted ceilings and walls, {{with large numbers of}} private houses of burgesses, lairds and lords gaining often highly detailed and coloured patterns and scenes, of which over a hundred examples survive. These include the ceiling at Prestongrange, undertaken in 1581 for Mark Kerr, Commendator of Newbattle, and the long gallery at Pinkie House, painted for Alexander Seaton, Earl of Dunfermline in 1621. These were undertaken by unnamed Scottish artists using continental pattern books that often led to the incorporation of humanist moral and philosophical symbolism, with elements that call on heraldry, piety, classical myths and allegory.

Election silence, as in all other types of elections in Croatia, when campaigning is forbidden, is enforced the day before the election and continues until 19:00 hours on the election day when the polling stations close and exit polls may be announced. Six nationwide local elections have been held in Croatia since 1990, the most recent being the 2009 local elections to elect county prefects and councils, and city and municipal councils and mayors. In 2009, the HDZ-led coalitions won a majority or plurality in fifteen county councils and thirteen county prefect elections. SDP-led coalitions won a majority or plurality in five county councils, including the city of Zagreb council, and the remaining county council election was won by IDS-SDP coalition. The SDP won four county prefect elections and the city of Zagreb mayoral election, the HSS won three county prefect elections, and the HNS and the HDSSB won a single county prefect election each.|$|E
5|$|Surviving {{stone and}} wood carvings, wall {{paintings}} and tapestries suggest {{the richness of}} sixteenth century royal art. At Stirling castle stone carvings on the royal palace from the reign of James V are taken from German patterns, and like the surviving carved oak portrait roundels from the King's Presence Chamber, known as the Stirling Heads, they include contemporary, biblical and classical figures. Scotland's ecclesiastical art suffered {{as a result of}} Reformation iconoclasm, with the almost total loss of medieval stained glass, religious sculpture and paintings. The parallel loss of ecclesiastical patronage created a crisis for native craftsmen and artists, who turned to secular patrons.

50|$|Minority {{influence}} {{is more likely}} to occur if {{the point of view of}} <b>the</b> <b>minority</b> is consistent, flexible, and appealing to the majority.

However, any wavering opinions from <b>the</b> <b>minority</b> group could lead the majority to dismiss <b>the</b> <b>minority's</b> claims and opinions.Serge Moscovici and Nemeth (1974) argued that minority {{influence is}} effective as long as there is consistency over time and agreement among the members of <b>the</b> <b>minority.</b> If this consistency were lost, then <b>the</b> <b>minority</b> would lose its credibility. This can be the case if a member of <b>the</b> <b>minority</b> deserts and joins the majority, as this damages the consistency and unity of <b>the</b> <b>minority.</b> After this occurrence, members of the majority are less likely to shift their position to that of the minority.The key to minority influence being successful is not just consistency, but how the majority interprets consistency. If <b>the</b> consistent <b>minority</b> are seen as too inflexible, rigid, and unwilling to change, they are unlikely to influence the majority. However, if they appear flexible and compromising, they will be seen as less extreme and more reasonable, having a better chance of changing majority views.|$|R
