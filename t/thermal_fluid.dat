50|$|The {{absorber}} {{is located}} at the focal line of the mirrors.

40|$|International audienceThermal fluids in the Balaruc-les-Bains peninsula, on {{the northeastern}} {{edge of the}} Thau lagoon (southern France), supply the third largest spa in France. These <b>thermal</b> <b>fluids</b> {{interact}} with karst water in the Upper Jurassic aquifer composed of limestone and dolomite, forming two massifs {{to the east and}} north of the lagoon. These calcareous formations extend under the western end of the Thau lagoon. Geochemical and isotope analyses were carried out in 1996 and 1998 on the thermal wells of the Balaruc-les-Bains peninsula to determine the origin of the <b>thermal</b> <b>fluids</b> and their interaction with subsurface karst water. The <b>thermal</b> <b>fluids</b> are a mixture of karst water and water of marine origin. (super 3) H and NO (sub 3) concentrations show that the proportion of present-day karst water in certain thermal wells is small (< 5 %), thus enabling us to define a "pure" thermal end-member. The thermal end-member is itself a mixture of seawater and meteoric paleowater. Ca and Sr concentrations indicate a lengthy interaction with the carbonate substratum of the deep reservoir. Sr isotope signatures are very homogeneous and associated mainly with the dissolution of Jurassic carbonate, but also to evaporitic minerals. delta (super 13) C contents indicate that this dissolution is linked to deep inflow of CO (sub 2). (super 87) Sr, trace element and rare earth element (REE) concentrations indicate that there is also a component, with a systematically minor participation, whose origin is deeper than the Jurassic carbonate and attributed to the Triassic and/or to the crystalline basement. (super 36) Cl concentrations are extremely low, indicating a residence time of around a hundred thousand years. The outflow temperature of the <b>thermal</b> <b>fluids</b> reaches 50 degrees C, and geothermometers indicate a reservoir temperature of around 80 - 100 degrees C, locating this aquifer at a depth of between 2000 and 2500 m. The geometry of the geological formations indicates a thrust plane associated with major basement faulting that separates the two calcareous massifs and seems to control the rise of deep <b>thermal</b> <b>fluids</b> from the Jurassic carbonate reservoirs and the participation of a deeper component from the basement and/or the Triassic. The present study shows that seawater can infiltrate at great depths and reside {{for long periods of time}} compared to the subsurface groundwater cycle. Compared to other highly saline fluids encountered in basement zones, these waters have a relatively well-preserved marine signature, probably due to the carbonate nature of the aquifer in which the fluids resided and their short residence time...|$|R
50|$|A {{key part}} of {{reaction}} calorimetry {{is the ability to}} control temperature in the face of extreme thermal events. Once the temperature is able to be controlled, measurement of a variety of parameters can allow an understanding of how much heat is being released of absorbed by a reaction.In essence, constant flux calorimetry is a highly developed temperature control mechanism which can be used to generate highly accurate calorimetry. It works by controlling the jacket area of a controlled lab reactor, while keeping the inlet temperature of the <b>thermal</b> <b>fluid</b> constant. This allows the temperature to be precisely controlled even under strongly exothermic or endothermic events as additional cooling is always available by simply increasing the area over which the heat is being exchanged.|$|E
50|$|A compact linear Fresnel {{reflector}} (CLFR) - {{also referred}} to as a concentrating linear Fresnel reflector - is a specific type of linear Fresnel reflector (LFR) technology. Linear Fresnel reflectors use long, thin segments of mirrors to focus sunlight onto a fixed absorber located at a common focal point of the reflectors. These mirrors are capable of concentrating the sun’s energy to approximately 30 times its normal intensity. This concentrated energy is transferred through the absorber into some <b>thermal</b> <b>fluid</b> (this is typically oil capable of maintaining liquid state at very high temperatures). The fluid then goes through a heat exchanger to power a steam generator. As opposed to traditional LFR’s, the CLFR utilizes multiple absorbers within the vicinity of the mirrors.|$|E
