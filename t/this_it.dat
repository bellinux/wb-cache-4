5|$|A Gothic {{screen was}} also {{added to the}} Norman nave at Peterborough, {{but this is an}} {{architectural}} oddity with no precedent or successor. The screen is composed of three enormous open arches, the two outer ones being much wider than that which frames the central door. The overwhelming composition is somewhat spoilt by the later porch and the fact that two towers of very different height pop up from behind the screen. Despite <b>this,</b> <b>it</b> is {{regarded as one of the}} supreme masterpieces of Gothic, revealing the enormous diversity and imagination of English medieval architects.|$|E

5|$|A {{commemorative}} {{was wanted}} by the State of Illinois {{to mark the}} centennial of its 1818 admission to the Union, and in 1918, legislation was introduced into Congress to accomplish <b>this.</b> <b>It</b> met no opposition, though several amendments were made during the legislative process.

5|$|A {{criticism}} {{of this method}} {{is that it can}} be statistically weak. Schaefer in particular has questioned how robust the claimed alignments in the Caracol are. Because of the wide variety of evidence, which can include artefacts as well as sites, there is no one way to practice archaeoastronomy. Despite <b>this</b> <b>it</b> is accepted that archaeoastronomy is not a discipline that sits in isolation. Because archaeoastronomy is an interdisciplinary field, whatever is being investigated should make sense both archaeologically and astronomically. Studies {{are more likely to be}} considered sound if they use theoretical tools found in archaeology like analogy and homology and if they can demonstrate an understanding of accuracy and precision found in astronomy. Both quantitative analyses and interpretations based on ethnographic analogies and other contextual evidence have recently been applied in systematic studies of architectural orientations in the Maya area and in other parts of Mesoamerica.|$|E
5|$|A low {{pressure}} area that developed over the southern Andaman Sea late in April moved north into the Bay of Bengal becoming the first depression of the year on May 2. The depression intensified {{under the influence of}} a high-level anticyclone and became a cyclonic storm the next day. The storm then turned to the northeast and strengthened into a severe cyclonic storm on May 4. Soon after <b>this,</b> <b>it</b> peaked with winds of 150km/h (90mph) and a well-defined eye formed. The storm made its landfall near Cox's Bazar in easternmost East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) early in the morning of May 7 and dissipated over western Burma that evening.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{operation}} was mounted too late to prevent the attacks on Saigon, the Australians and New Zealanders successfully disrupted the communist lines of communication, limiting their freedom of manoeuvre to attack the Long Binh–Bien Hoa complex, while they were also able to successfully interdict their withdrawal, causing heavy casualties.

5|$|As {{a member}} of the Board of Consultants to a {{committee}} appointed by Truman, Oppenheimer strongly influenced the Acheson–Lilienthal Report. In this report, the committee advocated creation of an international Atomic Development Authority, which would own all fissionable material and the means of its production, such as mines and laboratories, and atomic power plants where it could be used for peaceful energy production. Bernard Baruch was appointed to translate this report into a proposal to the United Nations, resulting in the Baruch Plan of 1946. The Baruch Plan introduced many additional provisions regarding enforcement, in particular requiring inspection of the Soviet Union's uranium resources. The Baruch Plan was seen as an attempt to maintain the United States' nuclear monopoly and was rejected by the Soviets. With <b>this,</b> <b>it</b> became clear to Oppenheimer that an arms race was unavoidable, due to the mutual suspicion of the United States and the Soviet Union, which even Oppenheimer was starting to distrust.|$|E
5|$|As its {{common name}} suggests, it is {{extremely}} bitter, though not toxic as such. This bitterness is worsened by cooking. One specimen can foul the taste of a whole meal prepared with mushrooms. Despite <b>this,</b> <b>it</b> is sold in local markets (tianguis) in Mexico. A local recipe from France, Romania and East Germany calls for stewing it in skimmed milk after which it can be eaten, or powdered and used for flavouring. The mushroom is not bitter for those who lack genetic sensitivity to bitter taste, a trait endowed by the gene TAS2R38 (taste receptor 2 member 38). The compound responsible for the bitter taste has not been identified.|$|E

5|$|By 1947, US395 ran {{concurrently}} {{along the}} portion of SR78 from Vista to Escondido before continuing along Santa Fe Avenue to Bonsall and Fallbrook and rejoining its alignment during the 1970s. At this time, all of SR78 that existed had been paved. Before the present-day freeway was built, SR78 was routed on the Vista Way Freeway (which was an expressway) from Oceanside east to downtown Vista. After <b>this,</b> <b>it</b> followed Santa Fe Avenue and Mission Road east (now signed as CR S14), continuing onto Grand Avenue in Escondido. Following the intersection with US395, SR78 turned south on Ash Street and rejoined the current alignment of the highway. In 1949, the rerouting of SR78 from US395 to US99 was listed as a priority by local officials. The road was known for its curves, even though it went over relatively flat terrain; this reduced its efficiency.|$|E
5|$|Coldrum Long Barrow is {{comparatively}} {{isolated from}} the other Medway Megaliths; in <b>this</b> <b>it</b> is unique, given that the other surviving examples are clustered into two groups.
