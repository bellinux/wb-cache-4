5|$|Out of {{a belief}} that many women in the sex {{industry}} have been spiritually abused by Christians trying to frighten {{them out of the}} sex industry with warnings of damnation, JC's Girls focuses on telling these women that God loves them. JC's Girls volunteers tell the women about the gospel but do not try to persuade them <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> sex industry; the organization recognizes that is often not financially viable for women in the sex industry to immediately sacrifice their employment. JC's Girls connects female sex workers with churches the organization believes to be non-judgmental, hoping that the women will experience the love of Christ through these churches and that they will thereby eventually have the support and strength they need <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> industry. Prior to referring a woman to a church, JC's Girls puts the church through a formal approval process to ensure that the church will not be judgmental. If women express a desire <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> sex industry, JC's Girls attempts to support them in doing so.|$|E
