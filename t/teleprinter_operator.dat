50|$|Reiner {{was drafted}} into the Army Air Forces in 1943 and served during World War II, {{eventually}} achieving the rank of corporal. He initially trained to be a radio operator, but after spending three months in the hospital recovering from pneumonia, {{he was sent to}} Georgetown University for ten months to train as a French interpreter. During language training, he had his first experience as a director, putting on a Molière play entirely in French. In 1944, after completing language training, he was sent to Hawaii to work as a <b>teleprinter</b> <b>operator.</b> The night before he was to ship out for an unknown assignment, he attended a production of Hamlet by the Special Services entertainment unit. Following an audition for actor and Major Maurice Evans, he was transferred to the Special Services. Reiner performed around the Pacific theater, entertaining troops in Hawaii, Guam, Saipan, Tinian, and Iwo Jima for the next two years. He was discharged in 1946.|$|E
50|$|By {{the end of}} 1942 WAAFs {{were serving}} on 21 air stations, and were {{eventually}} posted to every major station in New Zealand, and some served overseas. In January 1943 a party of 19 WAAFs were sent to Fiji to serve as shorthand typists, clerks, drivers, and equipment assistants. Later, as {{the size of the}} party expanded to 77, wireless <b>operators,</b> telephone and <b>teleprinter</b> <b>operators,</b> and cipher officers predominated, and it also included meteorological observers and medical orderlies. Only volunteers aged between 23 and 33 were permitted to go, with a tour of duty limited to eighteen months. This was later reduced to nine months, to allow more WAAFs to serve overseas. A WAAF detachment also served on Norfolk Island, which at its largest numbered 94, mostly cipher officers, but also including medical orderlies, and a clerk-librarian.|$|R
50|$|Initially, entry was {{confined}} to the few service trades then open to women, namely MT Driver, Equipment Assistant, Cook, Clerk and Mess and Kitchen Staff. A small number of fabric workers were also employed. By August 1939, the following additional trades were authorised: <b>Teleprinter</b> <b>Operators,</b> Telephone Operators and Plotters. It was in these latter trades that women’s natural temperament gave them a clear advantage over men, and in which they made {{a significant contribution to}} the Battle of Britain. Hardly a photograph or film of those days, showing the WAAF manning the radar stations and plotting tables could fail to evoke memories of those brave women, most of whom would have been recruited and trained as original part-time pre-war auxiliaries, including some who worked on the balloon squadrons as fabric workers or, later in the war, handling the balloons themselves.|$|R
5000|$|After WW2 {{it became}} a trade {{training}} camp for certain ground Signals trades. Many thousands of newly recruited RAF personnel, most having just completed their 8 weeks basic training, were taught their RAF trade skills at RAF Compton Bassett, so as to become competent Wireless <b>Operators,</b> <b>Teleprinter</b> <b>Operators,</b> Telegraphists or Telephonists before being posted to work at RAF operational stations and airfields elsewhere in the United Kingdom or abroad. As well as their trade training, personnel experienced tougher service discipline at Compton Bassett than on operational stations. There were frequent parades involving military drill, regular [...] "stand by your beds" [...] inspections of personal appearance, kit inspections and inspections of barrack hut accommodation. Being put on a charge for not being up to required standard, resulting in Jankers, was very commonly experienced by personnel while being trade trained there.|$|R
5000|$|... an <b>operator’s</b> <b>teleprinter</b> device (with a slow {{paper tape}} punch built-in) {{permitting}} programs to display {{information to the}} operator, and the operator to use the keyboard to punch up short program or data items on paper-tape. This teleprinter {{could not be used}} to input data directly to the computer, all operator commands had to be input through the operator’s console.|$|R
25|$|Teleprinters {{were invented}} {{in order to}} send and receive {{messages}} {{without the need for}} operators trained in the use of Morse code. A system of two <b>teleprinters,</b> with one <b>operator</b> trained to use a typewriter, replaced two trained Morse code <b>operators.</b> The <b>teleprinter</b> system improved message speed and delivery time, making it possible for messages to be flashed across a country with little manual intervention.|$|R
50|$|The {{teleprinter}} evolved {{through a}} series of inventions by a number of engineers, including Samuel Morse, Alexander Bain, Royal Earl House, David Edward Hughes, Emile Baudot, Donald Murray, Charles L. Krum, Edward Kleinschmidt and Frederick G. Creed. Teleprinters were invented in order to send and receive messages without the need for operators trained in the use of Morse code. A system of two <b>teleprinters,</b> with one <b>operator</b> trained to use a typewriter, replaced two trained Morse code <b>operators.</b> The <b>teleprinter</b> system improved message speed and delivery time, making it possible for messages to be flashed across a country with little manual intervention.|$|R
5000|$|Where 14 was the {{operation}} code {{for this type}} of read, 200000 was the lowest store location the data would be read to, 00 indicates that no register modification was to be done to the A or B addresses of the instruction, and 77 was the (fixed) device identifier of the paper tape reader. (Note - 77 used as a device ID for a write operation would direct the write to the <b>operator's</b> <b>teleprinter.</b> Embarrassing if this was due to a program error, and it was a large data block intended for mag tape.....) The last four octal characters (0000) were not required in this instruction, and would be ignored when the instruction was processed. Such [...] "spare" [...] characters were frequently, given the extremely limited main store available used by programmers to store constants.|$|R
5000|$|Store {{and forward}} {{networks}} predate {{the use of}} computers. Point-to-point teleprinter equipment was used to send messages which were stored at the receiving end on punched paper tape at a relay center. A human operator at the center removed the message tape from the receiving machine, read the addressing information, and then sent it toward its destination on appropriate outbound point-to-point teleprinter link. If the outbound link was in use, the operator placed the message in tape in a physical queue, usually consisting {{of a set of}} clips or hooks. A major relay center in the mid 1900s might have dozens of inbound and outbound <b>teleprinters,</b> scores of <b>operators,</b> and thousands of messages in the queues during peak periods. Operators referred to these centers as [...] "torn-tape relay centers," [...] a reference to removing the received message from the inbound teleprinter by tearing the paper tape to separate one message from the next. The U.S. military term for such a center was [...] "Non-Automated Relay Center" [...] (NARC).|$|R
