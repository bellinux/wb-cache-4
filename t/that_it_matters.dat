In her book Soap Stars, Debbie Foy featured Metcalfe and described Mercedes as [...] "having a dangerous streak and is always causing trouble or has a scam on the go, she enjoys taking risks and usually seems to get what she wants". Virgin Media listed Mercedes' wedding to Russ amongst their list of [...] "Soap's biggest wedding day disasters" [...] before adding that [...] "McQueen weddings are full of drama, and Russ and Mercedes' big day was no exception". Virgin Media later profiled some of Hollyoaks' [...] "hottest females" [...] in their opinion, and stated about Mercedes, [...] "As one of the hottest ladies in Hollyoaks, with curves to die for, Mercedes has had more men than hot dinners. And now Malachy's met his maker, we're sure it won't be long till Mercedes earns yet another notch on her bedpost". The Liverpool Echo described Mercedes' desire to marry saying, [...] "Mercedes has finally got what she's wanted for so long - a great big gleaming rock on her finger. Not <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>matters</b> who gave it to her, of course". Anthony D. Langford from AfterElton praised Mercedes, saying he loved the character and had these affections [...] "Because frankly, she scares the bejeezus out of me. This is one tough chick [...] As hard edged as she is, it's obvious she loves her brother dearly, and heaven help anyone who hurts a member of her family".|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to honouring journalists, Lindsey Hilsum, the Channel 4 News International Editor {{who was the}} host of the 2014 awards, emphasises that the Amnesty Awards play a very important role in encouraging editors to allow journalists to cover more obscure stories that are far away and expensive. She said that when: “you point out that you won an Amnesty Award for a similar story a couple of years ago. It makes editors think that they will get some sort of kudos from this, and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>matters</b> within the industry. So I think it’s tremendously important and I think Amnesty is doing a tremendous job by giving us these awards so that we can use them to say: ‘Yes, we’ve got to carry on reporting human rights, it really matters’." ...|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{historians have}} very {{different}} ideas regarding the authorship of A General History and what this attribution means for historiography. [...] As many historians point out, A General History of the Pyrates {{set the tone for}} every work on pirates that has been written since. [...] Since the attribution, there have been three schools of thought concerning the subject: those who agree with Moore's conclusions, those who do not, and even some who do not think <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>matters.</b> [...] Prior to Furbank and Owens' work on Defoe's canon, some scholars accepted that Defoe authored A General History, while others postulated that authorship does not matter. [...] Interestingly, however, some people, still believed that Defoe was the author. Some scholars compared the work to other records and sources from the time and concluded that A General History is highly significant for its amount of accuracy, regardless of attribution. [...] What is most important about this work is not who penned it, but that it represents what people thought about pirates in the early eighteenth century.|$|E

60|$|I stood hesitating, half minded to {{go after}} her and {{question}} her more closely as to what she knew and what she did no more than surmise.

60|$|We need say {{but little}} {{of his visit}} to Sir Louis. <b>It</b> <b>mattered</b> nothing now, whether it was Thorne, or Greyson, or Fillgrave.

60|$|They {{were both}} silent again, and I looked {{surprised}} {{from one to}} the other. What could this question of a few things matter, when a woman we had known so long was dying?

60|$|These silks were costly, and Wulf {{turned to}} the Prior to borrow money, {{but he had no}} more upon him.
