Other easily calculated events are supernovae whose remains are visible to astronomers and therefore their positions and magnitude can be accurately calculated.|$|E
5|$|The mod {{received}} widespread media acclaim. Edge called DayZ the mod of the year. Wired UKs Quitin Smith said {{it could}} be the most terrifying game of 2012, and Rock Paper Shotgun's Jim Rossignol called it the best game he had played so far in 2012. PC Gamer stated the game {{was one of the most}} important things <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> PC gaming in 2012 and included it in their 2012 list of the top five scariest PC games of all time. Metro called it one of the best games to ever to come out of PC modding and one of the single most impressive experiences available on the system. Eurogamer called it the best zombie game ever made and the break out phenomenon of PC gaming in 2012. Kotaku called it possibly the greatest zombie game of all time and the most interesting PC game of 2012. PC PowerPlay said DayZ was the most important thing <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> PC gaming in 2012.|$|E
5|$|As they {{sail for}} Greenland, strange things begin <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> the ships bearing the {{tourmaline}} veils. Marine life and sea birds {{of all kinds}} are attracted towards them, and crew stationed aboard them for too long begin acting intoxicated and amorous. The plant and animal life attracted to the ships experiences rapid growth, so that before they reach Greenland the ships look more like mountains or meadows than ships. Strange sea creatures never before seen appear around the ships, and when the expedition is ready to deploy the tourmaline veils, they have {{to cut through the}} riot of organic growth that has totally filled the ships. Once the energy of the veils is unleashed on Greenland, it melts the ice quickly but also has unanticipated effects. Prehistoric bones and plant remains that were buried under the ice are reanimated, and fuse together into monstrous forms made up of plant, animal, and mineral parts. Greenland, free of its icy burden, rises up, ripping from north to south in the process and becoming two separate islands. As the chapter ends, the now enormous monsters brought to life by the volcanic energy are spilling away from Greenland towards Europe.|$|E

5|$|Weed {{had wanted}} {{the vice presidential}} {{nomination}} for Seward (who attracted few delegate votes), and Collier had acted to frustrate them {{in more ways than}} one, for with the New Yorker Fillmore as vice president, under the political customs of the time, no one from that state could be named to the cabinet. Fillmore was accused of complicity in Collier's actions, but this was never substantiated. Nevertheless, there were sound reasons for the selection of Fillmore, as he was a proven vote-getter from electorally crucial New York, and his track record in Congress and as a candidate showed his devotion to Whig doctrine, allaying fears he might be another Tyler were something <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> General Taylor. Delegates remembered him {{for his role in the}} Tariff of 1842, and he had been mentioned as a vice presidential possibility along with Lawrence and Ohio's Thomas Ewing. His rivalry with Seward (already known for anti-slavery views and statements) made him more acceptable in the South.|$|E

25|$|In {{the fourth}} edition, {{things have changed}} substantially. The game still runs on six-sided dice, but now each task is given a threshold.

Hits above the threshold indicate extraordinary performance. Furthermore, if more than half the dice rolled are ones, then the player has made a glitch. Glitches cause bad things <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> the player and game masters are encouraged to be inventive and funny.|$|E

25|$|No {{declaration}} of trust is the most straightforward form of resulting trust, and is created when a trust is created, but the settlor does not give the form in which the property is to be held. For example, the settlor might give property to the beneficiary to hold for life, but fail to explain what is <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> the property when the holder dies. When this occurs, the property is held on resulting trust for the settlor, as in Vandervell v IRC. This also occurs where a trust is formed over property which requires formality, but is improperly created (for example, a land transfer that does not adhere to the Law of Property Act 1925).|$|E

25|$|In December 1936, Henry's brother Edward VIII abdicated {{the throne}} to marry divorcée Wallis Simpson. While the {{consequences}} of the abdication crisis weighed much more heavily on his brother Prince Albert, who became King George VI, Prince Henry also suffered from the outcome. Apart from the deep personal shock to the whole royal family, the abdication meant the end of Henry's military career. Although third in line to the throne, following his two nieces Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret, he became the first adult in line, meaning he would act as regent if anything were <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> the King before Princess Elizabeth came of age on 21 April 1944, her 18th birthday. Because of this, Prince Henry could not leave England {{at the same time as}} the King. Furthermore, he and his younger brother, the Duke of Kent, had to increase their royal engagements considerably to support the new King.|$|E
25|$|Greece appealed in 1954 to the United Nations {{to demand}} {{self-determination}} for Cyprus. Britain had the ruling mandate over the mostly ethnic Greek island, and wanted the Cyprus dispute {{to be resolved}} without being taken to the United Nations Security Council, where it could be problematically framed as an anti-colonialist struggle. To this end, Britain diplomatically encouraged Turkey to agitate Greece. The British ambassador to Greece also incited, saying in an August 1954 speech that Greco-Turkish ties were superficial, so nothing would be lost if, for example, something were <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> Atatürk's house in Thessaloniki. More bluntly, {{an official of the}} Foreign Office said that some agitation would be much to Turkey's benefit. In any case, said parliamentarian John Strachey, Turkey had a large ethnic Greek minority in Istanbul as a card to play against Greece if it considered annexing an independent Cyprus to Greece.|$|E
25|$|Several {{types of}} supernatural {{entities}} {{are believed to}} exist; they make themselves known by means of inexplicable sounds or happenings. Among these phenomena are khmaoc (ghosts), pret and besach (particularly nasty demons, the spirits {{of people who have}} died violent, untimely, or unnatural deaths), arak (evil spirits, usually female), neak ta (tutelary spirits residing in inanimate objects), mneang phteah (guardians of the house), meba (ancestral spirits), and mrenh kongveal (elf-like guardians of animals). All spirits must be shown proper respect, and, {{with the exception of the}} mneang phteah and mrenh kongveal, they can cause trouble ranging from mischief to serious life-threatening illnesses. An important way for living people to show respect for the spirits of the dead is to provide food for the spirits. If this food is not provided, the spirit can cause trouble for the offending person. For example, if a child does not provide food for the spirit of its dead mother, that spirit can cause misfortunes <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> the child.|$|E

25|$|Every time a cow {{enters the}} parlor several things need <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> ensure milk quality and cow health. First, the cow’s udder must be cleaned and {{disinfected}} to prevent both milk contamination and udder infections. Then the milking technician must check each teat {{for signs of}} infection by observing the first stream of milk. During this processes, called stripping the teat, the milking technician is looking for any discoloration or chunkiness that would indicate mastitis, an infection in the cow’s mammary gland. Milk from a cow with mastitis cannot enter the human milk supply, thus farmers must be careful that infected milk does not mix with the milk from healthy cows and that the cow gets the necessary treatment. If the cow passes the mastitis inspection, the milking technician will attach the milking cluster. The cluster will run until the cow is fully milked and then drop off. The milk travels immediately through a cooling system and then into a large cooled storage tank, where it will stay until {{picked up by a}} refrigerated milk truck. Before the cow is released from the milking stalls her teats are disinfected one last time to prevent infection.|$|E
25|$|On 13 June de Gaulle {{attended}} another Anglo-French {{conference at}} Tours with Churchill, Lord Halifax, Lord Beaverbrook, Spears, Ismay and Alexander Cadogan. This time few other major French figures were present apart from Reynaud and Baudoin. He was an hour late, and his account is not reliable. Reynaud demanded that France {{be released from}} the agreement which he had made with Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain in March 1940, so that France could seek an armistice. De Gaulle wrote that Churchill was sympathetic to France seeking an armistice, provided that an agreement was reached about what was <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> the French fleet. This claim was later made by apologists for the Vichy Regime, e.g. General Georges, who claimed that Churchill had supported the armistice {{as a means of}} keeping the Germans out of French North Africa. However, is not supported by other eyewitnesses (Churchill himself, Roland de Margerie, Spears) who agree that Churchill said that he “understood” the French action but that he did not agree with it. He murmured at de Gaulle that he was “l’homme du destin (the man of destiny)”, although it is unclear whether de Gaulle actually heard him. At the Cabinet meeting that evening Pétain strongly supported Weygand’s demand for an armistice, and said that he himself would remain in France to share the suffering of the French people and to begin the national rebirth. De Gaulle was dissuaded from resigning by the Interior Minister Georges Mandel, who argued that the war was only just beginning, and that de Gaulle needed to keep his reputation unsullied.|$|E
25|$|In {{the city}} of Harran, a mysterious viral {{outbreak}} has turned most of the population into hyper-aggressive zombie-like creatures, forcing Harran's Defence Ministry to quarantine the entire city. The Global Relief Effort (GRE) assists survivors still trapped in the city by regularly airdropping supplies. The GRE hires Kyle Crane (Roger Craig Smith) to infiltrate Harran in order to retrieve a sensitive file stolen from them by Kadir Suleiman (Jim Pirri), which he is using as leverage to blackmail them, {{with the threat of}} publicizing it if anything were <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> him. Crane is airdropped into Harran, where he is ambushed by a gang of hostile bandits. As the infected attack, Crane is bitten and infected, but rescued by Jade Aldemir (Nazneen Contractor) and Amir Ghoreyshi (Roy Vongtama). Amir sacrifices himself to buy Jade and Crane time, and Jade takes him to a survivor sanctuary called the Tower. Crane wakes up and is introduced to Rahim Aldemir (Suraj Partha), Jade's brother. Rahim then teaches Crane parkour and sends him to Spike (Kevin Daniels), who gives him his first task as a Runner of the tower. Crane learns that the Tower, which seeks to help other survivors, is being harassed by a gang of bandits led by a warlord named Rais who steals and hoards the supplies from the GRE airdrops, including Antizin; a drug that suppresses symptoms of infection and slows down the process of turning. After Harris Brecken (Matthew Wolf), leader of the tower is nearly killed by a rival runner in a mission to retrieve an Antizin drop, need for the drug becomes immense. Crane volunteers and manages to reach an airdrop containing Antizin, but despite the dire need of the medicine by the survivors, Crane is instructed by the GRE to destroy the airdrop, instructing him to reach out to Rais in order to buy the drug and possibly confirm his identity. Crane reluctantly complies and lies to the Tower that the supplies have been looted.|$|E
