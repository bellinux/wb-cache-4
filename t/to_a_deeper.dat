5|$|Chopin {{took the}} new salon genre of the nocturne, invented by the Irish {{composer}} John Field, <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> level of sophistication. He {{was the first}} to write ballades and scherzi as individual concert pieces. He essentially established a new genre with his own set of free-standing preludes (Op.28, published 1839). He exploited the poetic potential of the concept of the concert étude, already being developed in the 1820s and 1830s by Liszt, Clementi and Moscheles, in his two sets of studies (Op.10 published in 1833, Op.25 in 1837).|$|E
5|$|In the 17th century, {{botanical gardens}} began their {{contribution}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> scientific curiosity about plants. If a botanical garden {{is defined by}} its scientific or academic connection, then the first true botanical gardens were established with the revival of learning {{that occurred in the}} European Renaissance. These were secular gardens attached to universities and medical schools, used as resources for teaching and research. The superintendents of these gardens were often professors of botany with international reputations, a factor that probably contributed to the creation of botany as an independent discipline rather than a descriptive adjunct to medicine.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as the early nuclear arms control work, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Nathan F. Twining, sent a memorandum, in August 1959, to the Secretary of Defense, Neil McElroy, which {{suggested}} that the Strategic Air Command (SAC) formally be assigned responsibility to prepare the national nuclear target list, and a single plan for nuclear operations. Up to that point, the Army, Navy, and Air Force had done their own target planning. This had led to the same objectives being targeted multiple times by the different services. The separate service plans were not mutually supporting as in, for example, the Navy destroying an air defense facility on the route of an Air Force bomber going <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> target. While Twining had sent the memo to McElroy, the members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff disagreed on the policy during early 1960. Thomas Gates, who succeeded McElroy, asked President Dwight D. Eisenhower to decide the policy.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his return}} to Schalke, Holtby was named in the {{starting}} line-up for the 2011 Supercup on 23 July and scored the first penalty in a penalty shoot-out victory over Dortmund. He scored his first goal for the club the following month, netting Schalke's third in a 5–1 league win over Köln. Having previously played as an attacking fielder and winger, Holtby was converted <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> role under new manager Ralf Rangnick due to Spanish legend Raúl occupying the more advanced attacking position in the team. In spite of his more defensive role, Holtby managed to record a career best tally of nine goals for the season across 41 appearances, helping Schalke finish the campaign in fifth position {{in the league and}} as semi-finalists in the Champions League.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{interested}} in the ministers of the Empire, Phipps was diverted <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> interest in Napoleon's marshals, primarily by the difficulty of obtaining facts about them. He capitalized on the growing interest of both Britons and the French in the Napoleonic period by purchasing, as they came out, the many personal memoirs published by {{the descendants of the}} participants. Indeed, by 1920, he had acquired over 2,000 volumes, plus sundry maps and letters. That year, in failing health, he moved to the house of his son, Charles, in Carlyle Square (21), Chelsea, London. There was no room for the books at his son's house, so Phipps gave them to All Souls College, Oxford; the majority of them were placed in the Codrington Library. He selected All Souls for its established reputation in military history, and for the Codrington's collection left to it by Sir Foster Cunliffe, who had been killed in action in 1916. The collection, called the Phipps Collection, numbered more than 2,000 volumes, and includes Napoleon's published correspondence, that of the marshals, and has been kept up to date with modern works issued by the Historical Department of the French General Staff.|$|E
5|$|While at Celtic, Hooper {{struck up}} an {{excellent}} partnership with fellow striker Anthony Stokes. They scored over 40 goals {{between them in}} their first season together and {{were considered to be}} Celtic's best strike partnership, although on many occasions, especially for big matches, Georgios Samaras was often used alongside Hooper. Hooper expressed his disappointment at this because he felt that he worked very well with Stokes. In their partnership Hooper usually had a more advanced role, playing off the shoulder of the last defender, or in the box, and making runs in behind. His strength, pace, finishing ability and awareness made him suitably adapted to this role. Stokes usually played a deeper role, coming short to get the ball and creating space through his dribbling skill and passing. Although Hooper is more suited to an advanced role, and Stokes <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> one, they were capable of switching and both have the skills required to play in either role. This made it very hard for defenders to mark them.|$|E

25|$|The {{sources for}} {{information}} about Aztec society are primarily documents written in the Spanish language {{in the first century}} after the Spanish conquest. Important among these are the Florentine Codex, a 12 volume ethnographic description of precolumbian Aztec society compiled by Bernardino de Sahagún, the chronicle of Diego Durán, and the descriptions of the first conquistadors such as those of Hernán Cortés himself and of Bernal Díaz del Castillo. In recent decades the archaeological study of precolumbian Aztec civilization has also unearthed important information about Aztec society which has led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> understanding particularly of social structures and trade.|$|E

Her army is defeated, and Aslan himself kills Jadis, while most of her followers are killed and the remnants of her army flee and are eventually killed by Aslan's followers, who now serve Narnia under their new rulers.|$|E

25|$|Vinyl acetate {{polymers}} include polyvinyl acetate, {{polyvinyl alcohol}} and polyvinyl acetal; {{all come from}} reaction products of vinyl acetate. Some forms of acetates {{are known to be}} acidic and will do damage to an object with direct contact. Additionally, polyvinyl acetate mixtures tend to degrade in storage and release acetic acid, which in some cases can corrode lead. This compound's coloring ranges from clear/white to a soft yellow. As it ages, it will change <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> yellow. It can have a similar appearance to rubber adhesives but the difference is that PVA turns white when comes into contact with water. Warm water and acetone are typically used as solvents.|$|E
25|$|Arirang had {{initiated}} {{the period of}} nationalist film in Korea which continued from 1926 until about 1930, when harsher suppressive measures were undertaken by the authorities. After Arirang, tear-jerker shinpa-style movies that did no more than entertain, without appealing <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> national need, were criticized by the Korean press. Indeed, some of Na's own later films were also criticized in this way. Korean director and film historian Yu Hyun-mok states that Na's appearance with a Japanese woman as his romantic interest in the 1931 shinpa film, Geumganghan (The Grief of Geumgan), {{was seen as a}} betrayal by the Korean people, and had a profoundly negative impact on his career.|$|E

25|$|A {{major factor}} {{that contributed to}} the {{depletion}} of the cod stocks off the shores of Newfoundland was the introduction and proliferation of equipment and technology that increased the volume of landed fish. For centuries local fishermen used technology that limited the volume of their catch, the area they fished, and allowed them to target specific species and ages of fish. From the 1950s onwards, as was common in all industries at the time, new technology was introduced that allowed fishermen to trawl a larger area, fish <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> depth and for a longer time. By the 1960s, powerful trawlers from the Soviet Union and its satellite countries, Great Britain, Spain, Portugal, Japan, and Canada, equipped with radar, electronic navigation systems and sonar allowed crews to pursue fish with unparalleled success, and Canadian catches peaked in the late 1960s and early 1970s.|$|E
25|$|The use of BMIs {{has also}} led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> {{understanding}} of neural networks {{and the central}} nervous system. Research has shown that despite the inclination of neuroscientists to believe that neurons have the most effect when working together, single neurons can be conditioned {{through the use of}} BMIs to fire at a pattern that allows primates to control motor outputs. The use of BMIs has led to development of the single neuron insufficiency principle which states that even with a well tuned firing rate single neurons can only carry a narrow amount of information and therefore the highest level of accuracy is achieved by recording firings of the collective ensemble. Other principles discovered with the use of BMIs include the neuronal multitasking principle, the neuronal mass principle, the neural degeneracy principle, and the plasticity principle.|$|E
25|$|In 1934 de Gaulle wrote Vers l'Armée de Métier (Toward a Professional Army). He {{proposed}} mechanization of the infantry, {{with stress}} on an élite force of 100,000 men and 3,000 tanks. Ironically the German panzer units, so effectively {{employed in the}} invasion of France in 1940, used similar theories, while the French dispersed and wasted their armour. The book imagined tanks driving around the country like cavalry. De Gaulle’s mentor Emile Mayer was somewhat more prophetic than he about the future importance of air power on the battlefield. Such an army would both compensate for France's population shortage, and be an efficient tool to enforce international law, particularly the Treaty of Versailles, which forbade Germany from rearming. He also {{thought it would be}} a precursor <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> national reorganisation, and wrote that “a master has to make his appearance … whose orders cannot be challenged – a man upheld by public opinion”.|$|E
