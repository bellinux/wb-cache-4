5|$|Unlike the organolithium compounds, the {{organometallic}} compounds of the heavier alkali metals are predominantly ionic. The application of organosodium compounds in chemistry {{is limited in}} part due to competition from organolithium compounds, which are commercially available and exhibit more convenient reactivity. The principal organosodium compound of commercial importance is sodium cyclopentadienide. Sodium tetraphenylborate can also be classified as an organosodium compound since in the solid state sodium is bound to the aryl groups. Organometallic compounds of the higher alkali metals are even more reactive than organosodium compounds and of limited utility. A notable reagent is Schlosser's base, a mixture of n-butyllithium and potassium tert-butoxide. This reagent reacts with propene to form the compound allylpotassium (KCH2CHCH2). cis-2-Butene and trans-2-butene equilibrate when in contact with alkali metals. Whereas isomerisation is fast with lithium and sodium, it is slow with the heavier alkali metals. The heavier alkali metals also favour the sterically congested conformation. Several crystal structures of organopotassium compounds have been reported, establishing that <b>they,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> sodium compounds, are polymeric. Organosodium, organopotassium, organorubidium and organocaesium compounds are all mostly ionic and are insoluble (or nearly so) in nonpolar solvents.|$|E

500|$|Shatner {{says that}} acting in Star Trek was [...] "life-consuming" [...] {{and left him}} [...] "barely any time for family", {{and that this was}} the reason for his divorce from Gloria Rand, his first wife. He {{describes}} a subsequent succession of sexual partners, including, he says, Star Trek actresses. He also talks about the death of his father, Joseph Shatner, and of his third wife, Nerine Kidd, who accidentally drowned in a pool in 1999, losing a battle with alcoholism. Shatner recalls that Nimoy had expressed concern about Kidd's alcoholism and warned him about marrying her. Another topic is Nimoy's fine-art photography, which deals with spirituality and sensuality. Both Shatner and Nimoy say that, while they are glad that Star Trek became successful, they wish their subsequent fame had encroached less on their privacy. They also describe having been typecast {{as a result of their}} roles in Star Trek, and say that this has had repercussions on their respective acting careers. Shatner recounts his initial surprise that, at science fiction conventions, the fans seem to like each other more than <b>they</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> science fiction actors.

500|$|Josh Selig was {{inspired}} to create the show after watching puppeteers perform with their bare hands {{on the set of}} Ulica Sezamkowa in Warsaw, Poland. He noted the amount of expression conveyed by the more skilled actors' hands. Selig pitched the show to Noggin under the working title Pipo, but it was later renamed Oobi to mirror the characters' eyes with two O's. Viacom registered the Oobi title as a trademark on July 5, 2000. Elements of the series were intentionally made simple and old-fashioned, so that young children could easily understand the storylines and relate to the characters. In an interview with Gothamist, Selig stated, [...] "Simple is good. Everything about Oobi is stripped down to the bare essentials: the writing, the puppets, the educational goals. What is left‚Äîwhen it all works‚Äîare clear stories and emotional performances unencumbered by lots of fur or feathers." [...] He expanded upon this idea in an article for The New York Times, in which he noted that [...] "in the same way the puppets are very bare, the way they speak is quite distilled ... we've found it's really attractive to young kids. <b>They</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> clarity and simplicity." [...] The show was also specifically created to encourage preschool-aged viewers to use their imaginations and play with their own Oobi puppets.|$|E
