Due to the style of play, groin injuries are common for butterfly goalies. Luongo suffered one during the 2008–09 season and missed 24 games.|$|E

5|$|With {{approximately}} {{two minutes of}} normal time left, the referee's whistle blew for an infringement. Stein however appeared {{to think that the}} final whistle had been blown, as he rose from his seat and began to make his way towards the Welsh bench to shake hands with England. However, as he got up, he then fell <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> before collapsing to the ground. He was immediately carried to the stadium's medical room where attempts were made to resuscitate him.|$|E

5|$|As a result, {{the gods}} and goddesses meet and hold a thing to discuss and debate the matter. At the thing, the god Heimdallr puts forth the {{suggestion}} that, in place of Freyja, Thor should be dressed as the bride, complete with jewels, women's clothing down <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees,</b> a bridal head-dress, and the necklace Brísingamen. Thor rejects the idea, yet Loki interjects {{that this will be}} the only way to get back Mjöllnir. Loki points out that, without Mjöllnir, the jötnar will be able to invade and settle in Asgard. The gods dress Thor as a bride, and Loki states that he will go with Thor as his maid, and that the two shall drive to Jötunheimr together.|$|E
5|$|Gertrude summons Hamlet to {{her room}} to demand an explanation. Meanwhile, Claudius talks to himself about the impossibility of repenting, since he still has {{possession}} of his ill-gotten goods: his brother's crown and wife. He sinks <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees.</b> Hamlet, {{on his way to}} visit his mother, sneaks up behind him, but does not kill him, reasoning that killing Claudius while he is praying will send him straight to heaven while his father's ghost is stuck in purgatory. In the queen's bedchamber, Hamlet and Gertrude fight bitterly. Polonius, spying on the conversation from behind a tapestry, makes a noise.|$|E
5|$|After re-signing {{for another}} year in July 2006, he {{recorded}} 10 assists over 76 games the following season. He earned his first multi-year contract in the off-season, re-signing with the Bruins. During the 2007–08 season, he was limited to 35 games due to a head injury suffered on November 26, 2007, during {{a game against the}} Philadelphia Flyers. Going down <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> to block a puck moving into the defensive zone, opposing forward Scott Hartnell bodychecked him, using his elbow to hit Alberts' head against the boards. Alberts left the game injured, while Hartnell received a five-minute major penalty and a game misconduct; he was later suspended an additional two games by the league. Alberts recovered in time to make his NHL playoff debut in April 2008, as the Bruins were eliminated in the first round by the Montreal Canadiens.|$|E

5|$|On February 5, 2005, Judah {{would get}} a rematch with Spinks at the Savvis Center in St. Louis, Missouri, Spinks' hometown. The fight {{was the first major}} bout in St. Louis in more than 40years, and it was a sellout. Judah was the aggressor {{throughout}} the fight. He knocked Spinks down <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> at the bell in the seventh round, but it was not ruled a knockdown. Spinks had a strong start to the ninth round and connected with a left hand, then followed with a right hand and a combination, but Judah scored a knockdown moments later. Judah pressed the attack after the first knockdown and avoided Spinks' desperate efforts to tie him up. After Spinks was knocked down for the second time, the referee stopped the fight, and Judah became the new Undisputed Welterweight Champion.|$|E
5|$|Schneider {{plays in}} the {{butterfly}} style of goaltending, dropping <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> with his skates pointing outwards and his pads meeting in the middle in order to cover the bottom portion of the net. He honed the style with goaltending consultant Brian Daccord, beginning {{at the age of}} 15. After joining the Canucks as a backup in 2010–11, Schneider began working with the team goaltending coach Roland Melanson, who encouraged him to play shallower in his crease. Schneider adopted the style which required him to be more athletic on first shots, but better prepared him for rebounds and cross-crease plays. Schneider's strengths are his size and athleticism. His coach with the Moose, Scott Arniel, has also heralded his ability to get into position ahead of time, anticipating plays.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the first}} and second falls, Barr began to mockingly perform jumping jacks in the ring, showing how little {{physical}} exertion it took to win the first fall. This was followed by Guerrero once again mocking the Mexican crowd by pretending to be swimming to infuriate the crowd. Guerrero and Hijo del Santo started out the second fall as they had the first, locking up {{in the center of the}} ring. When Octagón entered the ring, Guerrero dropped <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees,</b> feigning an apology for a moment, before poking Octagón in the eye to gain the advantage. Later on, Hijo del Santo entered the ring and all four men ended up in the ring at the same time, until the tecnico team sent La Pareja del Terror to the floor, followed by a double Topé Suicida (Suicide dive headbutt) by Hijo del Santo and Octagón. Later in the match, Guerrero performed a Huracanrana with Hijo del Santo sitting on the top rope and gained a pinfall, leaving Octagón at a disadvantage in the second fall. Barr and Guerrero double-teamed Octagón, with Barr throwing Octagón up on the air, thinking Guerrero caught him for a move. Instead, Octagón rolled up Guerrero for the pinfall as Barr celebrated, mistakenly thinking Guerrero got the pinfall. Moments later, the unsuspecting Barr was rolled up into Octagón's trademark submission hold La Escalera and was forced to submit, tying the match at one fall each.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} day, as Australia faced a large deficit on {{the first}} innings, Bert Oldfield played a long innings in support of Bill Ponsford, who scored 85. In {{the course of the}} innings, the English bowlers used bodyline against him, and he faced several short-pitched deliveries but took several fours from Larwood to move to 41. Having just conceded a four, Larwood bowled fractionally shorter and slightly slower. Oldfield attempted to hook but lost sight of the ball and edged it onto his temple; the ball fractured his skull. Oldfield staggered away and fell <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> and play stopped as Woodfull came onto the pitch and the angry crowd jeered and shouted, once more reaching the point where a riot seemed likely. Several English players thought about arming themselves with stumps should the crowd come onto the field. The ball which injured Oldfield was bowled to a conventional, non-bodyline field; Larwood immediately apologised but Oldfield said that it was his own fault before he was helped back to the dressing room and play continued. Jardine later secretly sent a telegram of sympathy to Oldfield's wife and arranged for presents to be given to his young daughters.|$|E

Having always been rather overweight, he participated in both seasons of Channel Nine's Celebrity Overhaul to lose weight and improve his fitness.

However, this depiction of a pagan prayer has been criticized as inaccurate due to the description of Haakon dropping <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees.</b>|$|E
