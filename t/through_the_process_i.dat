40|$|In {{the wake}} of genetic and tissue engineering, two {{concepts}} which are deeply intertwined have acquired new connotations, {{not only in the}} field of science but also in the thick fabric of cultural beliefs and expectations which stem from the former and vice-versa; namely hybridity and purification. Discourses around the purity of the human species abound, and they help to maintain the separation between humans and between humans and nonhuman animals. Birke and Michael, 1 following Latour, 2 call this process of keeping separate the human and nonhuman ‘purification’. This artificial separation perpetuates discourses and practices of colonialism, racism and sexism, which extend to nonhuman animals <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>I</b> call ‘othering’, which is a desperate attempt at keeping the boundaries between ‘the self‘ and ‘the other’, intact. However, this constant policing of boundaries, which Latour sees as obsessive in modernity, covers up increasing anxieties over hybridity [...] because, as Birke and Michael note: ‘[T]he notion of hybridity implies boundary [...] crossing and mixing [...] if not literally, then certainly at a conceptual level’. 3 This would confuse, they suggest, issues of humanity, animality and even of individuality.

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{alternative}} journalism, my work seeks to build empathy and combat inequalities of representation within a specified community of viewer-participants. Through MA thesis work, I built flexible, minimalist design systems that succeeded by receding—by eliminating expressive elements and pushing contributor content (visual and literary work {{in a variety of}} styles) to the foreground. In response to the highly technological, reductive mindset that had come to dominate my creative life, I engaged in exploratory exercises that were antithetical to this prior work. Through expressive engagement with analog materials, I isolated the skill of making and responding to a range of personal marks that were free of the constraints associated with developing marketing materials or periodicals for a general audience. Slowed into a more contemplative mindset, I explored abstraction, symbolism and personal history in works that engaged on different levels, and became more open to discovering images <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>process.</b> <b>I</b> found that at the heart of my work—from clean, legible layouts for books and magazines to the most abstract, personal or expressive wall-hanging pieces—is a desire to connect, to bring about preferred (clearer, deeper) states of information transfer by fusing content, form, and viewer participation into moments of contemplative engagement.

Fine arts, science, math, and literature all work as one, and overlap to teach us valuable lessons and tools we can use as we grow. But as we become older school systems segregate subjects, forcing students to chose a direction. Do I have a creative mind, or a logical mind? As an art student I’ve tried {{over the course of}} my college career to push hard against the stigma that the arts and sciences are separate entities. Much of my work is inspired by the natural sciences – landscapes, habitants of the deep sea, and microscopic creatures. For this project I wanted to combine my love of nature and my childlike curiosity for the sciences with my artistic tendency, in order to create something for the public viewing. Out of this desire came the idea for a moss mural. This project presented many challenges, not unlike those found in a laboratory or those found in an artist’s studio. But <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>I</b> have gained more appreciation for that part of me that is still a child hunched over a toy microscope, attempting to draw what I see.

As {{the demands for}} a higher {{accountability}} in our current education system continue to grow, more attention is being given to Standards-based Grading. Based on an abundance of research correlating {{the positive effects of}} certain types of feedback and achievement, SBG is a tool that can provide effective feedback and will eventually allow teachers, parents, administrators and government officials to quickly gain quantitative insight concerning student progress in the attainment of specific skills areas. Although not formally recognized as Standards-based Grading, a criterion, skills-based form of grading and assessment has existed for years at the primary level of education. It has only been in the last 15 years that secondary schools have begun to adopt SBG. Considering the future exigencies in education and in hopes of successfully paving the way for my fellow colleagues and other future educators, the purpose of this project was to research, create and implement a standards-based grading system that is both effective and functional at the secondary level.

40|$|Only three processes, operant {{during the}} {{formation}} of the Solar System, are responsible for the diversity of matter in the Solar System and are directly responsible for planetary internal-structures, including planetocentric nuclear fission reactors, and for dynamical processes, including and especially, geodynamics. These processes are: (i) Low-pressure, low-temperature condensation from solar matter in the remote reaches of the Solar System or in the interstellar medium; (ii) High-pressure, high-temperature condensation from solar matter associated with planetary-formation by raining out from the interiors of giant-gaseous protoplanets, and; (iii) Stripping of the primordial volatile components from the inner portion of the Solar System by super-intense solar wind associated with T-Tauri phase mass-ejections, presumably during the thermonuclear ignition of the Sun. As described herein, these processes lead logically, in a causally related manner, to a coherent vision of planetary formation with profound implications including, but not limited to, (a) Earth formation as a giant gaseous Jupiter-like planet with vast amounts of stored energy of protoplanetary compression in its rock-plus-alloy kernel; (b) Removal of approximately 300 Earth-masses of primordial gases from the Earth, which began Earth's decompression process, making available the stored energy of protoplanetary compression for driving geodynamic processes, which I have described by the new whole-Earth decompression dynamics and which is responsible for emplacing heat at the mantle-crust-interface {{at the base of the}} crust <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>I</b> have described, called mantle decompression thermal-tsunami; and, (c) Uranium accumulations at the planetary centers capable of self-sustained nuclear fission chain reactions.

I would like to start by thanking my advisor, Professor Milind Tambe, for seeing the potential in me and accepting me as a PhD student. I came to Teamcore without much knowledge of game theory, optimization, or even a clear idea of what it meant to conduct proper research.

Your passion and dedication to research, and use-inspired research in particular, is palpable and something I will strive to emulate in my career. Your commitment to your students is unparalleled and extends long after graduation. The Teamcore family that has been formed over the years stands as a tribute to that commitment.

40|$|This thesis explores {{whether an}} {{intervention}} {{carried out with}} a senior secondary school Environmental Science class was able to develop action competence in Education for Sustainability (EfS) in the students. The concept of action competence was initially proposed by Danish researchers who were dissatisfied {{with a focus on}} behavioural change by other researchers in the field. I was particularly interested in using a New Zealand model of action competence in my classroom and examining the role that the culture of the student played in that model. The United Nations literature includes culture as part of Education for Sustainability but international educational research has not to date. In designing the intervention, examined a range of learning theories and matched them with the needs of students in a city in New Zealand with a very multicultural population. Links were also made between The New Zealand Curriculum and Best Evidence Synthesis from the Ministry of Education here in New Zealand. The resulting intervention had a student centered approach and an emphasis on recognising the culture of students that was based around an action competence model developed for New Zealand. The aim was to see if this combination would enable the students in the intervention to make progress towards being action competent during an EfS unit on action –taking. The intervention was carried out with a class of seventeen students who were undertaking an Education for Sustainability Achievement Standard involving taking an action towards becoming more sustainable. I used an action research approach whereby I taught and supported students <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>process.</b> <b>I</b> used their log books, reports, journals and informal conversations to provide my research data. This data was analysed using a continuum I developed that was {{based on the work of}} a New Zealand team that adapted the concept of action competence for the New Zealand situation.

40|$|When I {{was young}} at school, in Cambodia, I only learnt {{the history of}} Cambodia from books which were written by French clerks during their {{domination}} from II August 1863 to 8 November 1953. I {{did not know the}} truth until I received the Memoirs of my grandmother and my great grand father from my dearest mother on the day of a very significant event in my life. The documents which recorded Cambodian history of the period of French occupation were written only by the French and portrayed a very benign and distorted history of the French colonization of France. There is therefore a need to provide a Cambodian perspective on the events of this period. My study documents the rise of the Cambodian Nationalist Movement through the memoirs of my grandmother, Princess Bophaphuong, and my great grand father, Prince Hassakan. I have focused especially on the period from 1880 - 1920, and in this thesis on my grandmother's journal. She was active in the education of girls and the maintenance and transmission of Cambodian cultural knowledge and practices. In her journals she described the secret classes of children in rural areas for girls conducted by the Nationalist Movement. I undertook this research through a process of collective biography and memory work in which I evoked the circumstances of the handing over of the memoirs during the uprising of the 1970 s. During this time I memorized the memoirs. For my research I wrote the memoirs down in Cambodian and then translated them into English. This process required also extensive consultation of archival documents and private collection in order to verify names, places, events from memoirs. <b>Through</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>I</b> found that the women who worked for the Nationalist Movement sacrificed their life for the nation. I learnt how my grandmother struggled to provide education without self interest, risked her life, spent her money, and her time, and sacrificed her personal life. They achieved the literacy of girls and lower class children, who then filled middle level positions in the public service which were previously only for the rich. They educated people in the traditional cultural practices of the royal ballet and silk weaving and knowledge of their meanings. I have concluded that the princesses, and especially my grandmother, {{played an important role in}} maintaining Cambodian cultural knowledge and practices throughout the French colonization of Cambodia. This is the role that I have continued in Australia today...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} the result of an ethnographic {{fieldwork}} at a major university hospital in Denmark that I undertook between June 2009 and January 2011. I was an ‘embedded’ observer in a cancer clinic and entirely dependent on the staff – administrative and clinical – for access to facilities, people and diseases. That said, I was never asked to modify my writings in any way or to show the content of my field notes or tape recordings. Neither does the hospital have any formal share in the overall thesis. The responsibility for the final outcome is on my shoulders alone. As an embedded observer I was to handle personally sensitive data, such as specific details in patient records, with confidentiality. There is no information in my writings which can be traced – directly or indirectly – back to individual patients or relatives at the hospital and hence disclose their identity. My observations lasted anywhere from 20 minutes (the length of a typical staff meeting) to five working days in a row. During a day of observation, I followed doctors from they arrived in the early mornings; when they attended the morning conferences, until they left the hospital in the late afternoon after hours of clinical work in the outpatient clinic. I also followed them in their offices and in the operation theatres. Many tableaux from the thesis you are reading now were recorded in my notebook and then reconstructed in the later writing. Wherever possible, I have used my free access to the hospital to check the accuracy of my writing, for example by procuring typical situations more than once or by going through precarious details with involved staff members. Statements that appear in quotation marks (‘…’) were recorded directly on my tape recorder or in my notebook while the person was speaking, or immediately hereafter. <b>Through</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>I</b> have shared my ideas with the staff members involved {{to make sure that they}} understood the purpose of my work and also in order for them to have a chance to feel comfortable with my presence. Throughout the thesis, I have shortened quotes from documents and interviews in order to make the text more readable. In addition to my fieldwork at the hospital, I have worked with the sociologist Nanna Mik-Meyer. In her work, Mik-Meyer has focused on general practitioners and their preoccupation with patients who attend the consultancy with medically unexplained symptoms. Parts of the raw data material from some of her previous studies became the basis of a co-authored article, which is included in this thesis. Utterances from individuals described in this article are directly quoted from a larger quantity of interviews with general practitioners in primary care medicine...|$|E

Our results on purified DNAs from cervical tissues show that, in spite of the diffuse DNA hypomethylation which characterizes neoplastic cells, specific DNA methylation of HpaII and CfoI sequences of the first exon occurs and increases with the grade of neoplastic transformation.
