5|$|PortLINK is {{the most}} complex of the proposals, as it {{involves}} making decisions {{on the future of}} the Outer Harbor and Grange railway lines.

Light rail options for the Grange railway line include converting the entire line to light rail, diverting it <b>to</b> <b>West</b> Lakes and closing the section beyond Albert Park station, or replacing it with new on-street routes to Grange and West Lakes. The PortLINK routes are very similar to a group of light rail extensions <b>to</b> <b>West</b> Lakes, Port Adelaide and Semaphore that were announced in the 2008 South Australian Budget but then scrapped in the 2012 budget.|$|E
