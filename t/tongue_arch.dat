50|$|Clint was {{the first}} teacher {{to explain how the}} order in which embouchure motions are used affects the players range and endurance. Clint {{discovered}} that some embouchure techniques like <b>tongue</b> <b>arch</b> work best in the middle register, some like lip compression work best in the upper register. Making sure to add the elements of embouchure control in the right order is a key of successful playing. He calls this idea the 4 Trumpet Octave Keys.|$|E

Raphael Mendez advised saying the letter [...] "M". The skin under the lower lip will be taut with no air pocket. The lips do not overlap nor do they roll in or out. The corners of the mouth are held firmly in place. To play with an extended range one should use a pivot, <b>tongue</b> <b>arch</b> and lip to lip compression.|$|E
50|$|An {{interstitial}} deletion of chromosome 14 {{has been known}} to occasionally be the source of anophthalmia. The deletion of this region of chromosome has also been associated with patients having a small <b>tongue,</b> and high <b>arched</b> palate, developmental and growth retardation, undescended testes with a micropenis, and hypothyroidism. The region that has been deleted is region q22.1-q22.3. This confirms that region 22 on chromosome 14 influences the development of the eye.|$|R

5000|$|In the {{original}} {{form of the}} Cardinal Vowels, Jones employed a dual-parameter system of description based on the supposed height of the <b>tongue</b> <b>arch</b> together with {{the shape of the}} lips. This he reduced to a simple quadrilateral diagram which could be used to help visualize how vowels are articulated. Tongue height (close vs. open) is represented on the vertical axis and front vs. back on the horizontal axis indicates the portion of the tongue raised on the horizontal axis. Lip-rounding is also built into the system, so that front vowels (such as e, a) have spread or neutral lip postures, but the back vowels (such as o,u) have more marked lip-rounding as vowel height increases. Jones thus arrived at a set of eight [...] "primary Cardinal Vowels", and recorded these on gramophone disc for HMV in 1917.|$|E
40|$|In 1867 Alexander Melville Bell {{conceived}} the high-low front-back tongue position model for vowels, including {{the concept of}} central vowels. This model was rapidly accepted by the phonetics community, but {{it has never been}} validated. This article reports an examination of 38 sets of X-ray tracings of vowels from 15 different languages, published in the past half century. This corroborates the charges made against the Bell model of failing to prescribe tongue positions correctly. Other criticsms concern the acoustic theory underlying the Bell model, which is not only oversimplistic but also misleading since the position of the <b>tongue</b> <b>arch</b> is irrelevant for the tuning of vocal resonances. The implications of invalidation for speech production theory are discussed. The constancy of vocal tract configurations, compared with the ambiguity of <b>tongue</b> <b>arch</b> position, points to a more suitable type of model for vowel articulation in which individual gestures combine to shape the vocal cavities to the resonator configurations appropriate to the sound quality...|$|E
40|$|This article reports model {{experiments}} where {{vocal tract}} profiles {{of high and}} mid unrounded front and high rounded back vowels were systematically modified to simulate small constriction shifts along the hard or soft palate, {{in order to test}} A. M. Bell's century-old proposal that small shifts of <b>tongue</b> <b>arch</b> fronting or retraction would yield audible shifts of vowel timbre. Such differences were claimed to explain audible differences of vowel timbre between dialects or between languages. The claim has never been validated and is contridicted on several counts: the Bell model provides an inaccurate account of articulatory activity for vowels, <b>tongue</b> <b>arch</b> position is irrelevant for tuning vocal tract resonances, the Bell model is based on the single resonance theory and cannot accommodate several formants, and quantal theory suggests that local shifts of contriction location should not yield any audible spectral shift in F 2. The results confirmed that F 2 of all these vowels was insensitive to fronting and retraction in Bell's sense. However, F 3 of the unrounded front vowels fell steadily from fronted to retracted, as expected from perturbation theory (the fronted position is near a volume velocity antinode for F 3 and the retracted position is close to a volume velocity node). This explains the often reported sharpness of, say Swedish and, Russian prepalatal front vowels, and the dullness of, say, English midpalatal front vowels...|$|E

40|$|In 1954, Papillon-Leage and Psaume {{were the}} first to {{describe}} the clinical characteristics of oral-facial-digital syndrome (OFDS). On the basis of their clinical features and the inheritance pattern, 2 variants were initially distinguished, namely OFDS type I (Papillon-Leage and Psaume) and OFDS type 11, or Mohr syndrome. At present, I I types of OFDS have been discovered. OFDS represents a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by oral manifestations including oral frenula, cleft or lobulated <b>tongue,</b> high <b>arched</b> palate, cleft lip and/or palate, facial anomalies, and digital abnormalities such as syndactyly, polydactyly, brachydactyly, and clinodactyly. Depending on the type of OFDS, abnormalities may be present in other organs, such as the brain and heart. We report a patient with OFDS in whom multiple recurrent and de novo keratocysts were found. Although multiple keratocysts are commonly found in Gorlin-Goltz nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome, a relationship between OFDS and multiple keratocysts has not been describe...|$|R

40|$|A {{model of}} the midsagittal plane motion of the tongue, jaw, hyoid bone, and larynx is presented, based on the lambda version of {{equilibrium}} point hypothesis. The model includes muscle properties and realistic geometrical arrangement of muscles, modeled neural inputs and reflexes, and dynamics of soft tissue and bony structures. The {{focus is on the}} organization of control signals underlying vocal tract motions and on the dynamic behavior of articulators. A number of muscle synergies or "basic motions" of the system are identified. In particular, it is shown that systematic sources of variation in an x-ray data base of midsagittal vocal tract motions can be accounted for, at the muscle level, with six independent commands, each corresponding to a direction of articulator motion. There are two commands for the jaw (corresponding to sagittal plane jaw rotation and jaw protrusion), one command controlling larynx height, and three commands for the tongue (corresponding to forward and backward motion of the <b>tongue</b> body, <b>arching</b> and flattening of the tongue dorsum, and motion of the tongue tip). It is suggested that all movements of the system can be approximated as linear combinations of such basic motions. In other words, individual movements and sequences of movements can be accounted for by a simple additive control model. The dynamics of individual commands are also assessed. It is shown that the dynamic effects are not neglectable in speechlike movements because of the different dynamic behaviors of soft and bony structures...|$|R
40|$|Here {{we review}} the {{influence}} of bronchopulmonary receptors (slowly and rapidly adapting pulmonary stretch receptors, and pulmonary / bronchial C-fiber receptors) on respiratory-related motor output to upper airway muscles acting on the larynx, <b>tongue</b> and hyoid <b>arch.</b> Review of the literature shows that all muscles in all three regions are profoundly inhibited by lung inflation, which excites slowly adapting pulmonary stretch receptors. This widespread coactivation includes the recruitment of muscles that have opposing mechanical actions, suggesting that the stiffness of upper airway muscles is highly regulated. A profound lack {{of information on the}} modulation of upper airway muscles by rapidly adapting receptors and bronchopulmonary C-fiber receptors prohibits formulation of a conclusive opinion as to their actions, and underscores an urgent need for new studies in this area. The preponderance of the data support the view that slowly adapting pulmonary stretch receptors are the primary afferent pathway for the initiation of the widespread and highly coordinated recruitment of laryngeal, tongue and hyoid muscles during airway obstruction.

40|$|A method {{utilizing}} {{the principle of}} fluid displacement was devised to measure {{the volume of the}} anterior portion of the tongue. A sample of thirty-nine men was used to test the relationships between measurable tongue volume, tongue length, certain angular cephalometric measurements, and lower arch dimensions. Seventeen subjects showing scalloping of the lateral borders of the tongue were compared with the main sample. Conclusions from this investigation are as follows: 1. 1. The volume of the anterior portion of the tongue can be measured with an average accuracy of 2. 3 c. c. +/- 1. 4 c. c., using the instrument described here. 2. 2. In this sample, and with this method of measurement, the volume and length of the tongue seem to have little, if any, influence on the width and length of the lower dental arch, on the degree of interincisal relationship, and on the angle of the lower incisor teeth to the mandibular plane. 3. 3. A statistically significant correlation of 0. 4 exists between measurable <b>tongue</b> volume and <b>arch</b> perimeter. 4. 4.
