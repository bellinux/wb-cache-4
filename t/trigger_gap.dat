40|$|The {{time delay}} to {{the firing of}} a {{triggered}} vacuum gap (t. v. g.) containing barium titanate in the <b>trigger</b> <b>gap</b> is investigated {{as a function of}} the main gap voltage, main gap length, trigger pulse duration, trigger current and trigger voltage. The time delay decreases steadily with increasing trigger current and trigger voltage until it reaches saturation. The effect of varying the main gap length and voltage on the time delay is not strong. Before `conditioningÃ�Â¿ the t. v. g. two groups of time delays, long (> 100 Ã�Â¿s) and short (< 10 Ã�Â¿s), are simultaneously observed when a large number of trials are conducted. After conditioning, only the group of short time delays are present. This is attributed to the marked reduction of the resistance of the <b>trigger</b> <b>gap</b> across the surface of the solid dielectric resulting directly from the conditioning effect...|$|E
40|$|The firing {{characteristics}} of the simple triggered vacuum gap (TVG) using lead zirconate titanate as dielectric material in the triggered gap are described. This TVG has a long life of about 2000 firings without appreciable deterioration of the electrical properties for main discharge currents upto 3 kA and is much superior to these made with Supramica (Mycalex Corporation of America) and silicon carbide as used in our earlier investigations. The effects of the variation of trigger voltage, trigger curcit, trigger pulse duration, trigger pulse energy, main gap voltage, main gap separation and main circuit energy on the firing characteristics have been studied. Trigger resistance progressively decreases {{with the number of}} firings of the <b>trigger</b> <b>gap</b> and {{as well as of the}} main gap. This decrease in the trigger resistance is more pronounced for main discharge currents exceeding 10 kA. The minimum trigger current required for reliable firing decreases with increase of trigger voltage upto a threshold value of 1. 2 kV and there-onwards saturates at 3. 0 A. This value is less than that obtained with Supramica as dielectric material. One hundred percent firing probability of the TVG at main gap voltages as low as 50 V is possible and this low voltage breakdown of the main gap appears to be similar to the breakdown at low pressures between moving plasma by other workers. and the cold electrodes immersed in it, as reported...|$|E
50|$|Special purpose, high-energy triggerable {{spark gaps}} {{can be used}} to rapidly switch high {{voltages}} and very high currents for certain pulsed power applications, such as pulsed lasers, railguns, fusion, ultrastrong pulsed magnetic field research, and in the triggering of nuclear bombs. Commercially available devices can be divided into two classes: positive pressure and <b>triggered</b> vacuum <b>gaps.</b> Positive pressure <b>triggered</b> <b>gaps</b> have a limited operating voltage range (for instance, from 1/3 to 2/3 of the self breakdown voltage). <b>Triggered</b> vacuum <b>gaps</b> offer a wide operating voltage range (400 V to 90 kV is achievable). Both classes can switch higher energy levels than any thyristor, thyratron, krytron, or sprytron. <b>Triggered</b> <b>gaps</b> are popular for single-shot and low-repetition-rate applications. One such switch is known as a trigatron. The Ignitron and Crossatron could be considered <b>triggered</b> <b>gaps.</b> The latter is unique in that it can be turned back off by the control electrode after conduction begins. The xenon flash tube is another common <b>triggered</b> <b>gap.</b> Various schemes have also been devised to <b>trigger</b> open air <b>gaps</b> on command. A set of spark gaps are a key element of a Marx generator, used to generate high-voltage impulses; the spark gaps allow a chain of capacitors to be slowly charged in parallel and then rapidly discharged in series.|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis extends and contributes knowledge {{to the field of}} laser-induced breakdown of a spark gap in air. Previous work has shown that laser- triggering of a spark gap is very effective {{in the case of a}} coaxially <b>triggered</b> spark <b>gap</b> (where the beam is directed along the axis of the gap). Although a coaxially <b>triggered</b> <b>gap</b> presents a very intuitive approach, it is not practical. Therefore, the main focus of this work is to investigate how effective laser-triggering is in the case of an orthogonally arranged gap (beam at right angles to the gap axis). The effects of the laser beam intensity, the gap length used and the position of the plasma in the gap were found to play important roles in the breakdown process of an orthogonally <b>triggered</b> <b>gap.</b> It was found that directing and focusing the laser beam at right angles to the gap axis reduces the breakdown voltage of the gap dramatically. An almost 70...|$|R

40|$|Plexins are cell surface receptors for the semaphorin {{family of}} cell {{guidance}} cues. The cytoplasmic region comprises a Ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain and a RhoGTPase binding domain. Concomitant binding of extracellular semaphorin and intracellular RhoGTPase <b>triggers</b> <b>GAP</b> activity and signal transduction. The mechanism of this intricate regulation remains elusive. We present two crystal {{structures of the}} human Plexin-B 1 cytoplasmic region in complex with a constitutively active RhoGTPase, Rac 1. The structure of truncated Plexin-B 1 -Rac 1 complex provides no mechanism for coupling RhoGTPase and Ras binding sites. On inclusion of the juxtamembrane helix, a trimeric structure of Plexin-B 1 -Rac 1 complexes is stabilised by a second, novel, RhoGTPase binding site adjacent to the Ras site. Site-directed mutagenesis combined with cellular and biophysical assays demonstrate that this new binding site is essential for signalling.

40|$|AbstractGap {{junction}} proteins, connexins, are dynamic polytopic membrane {{proteins that}} exhibit unprecedented short half-lives {{of only a}} few hours. Consequently, it is well accepted that in addition to channel gating, gap junctional intercellular communication is regulated by connexin biosynthesis, transport and assembly as well as the formation and removal of gap junctions from the cell surface. At least nine members of the 20 -member connexin family are known to be phosphorylated en route or during their assembly into gap junctions. For some connexins, notably Cx 43, evidence exists that phosphorylation may trigger its internalization and degradation. In recent years it has become apparent that the mechanisms underlying the regulation of connexin turnover are quite complex with the identification of many connexin binding molecules, a multiplicity of protein kinases that phosphorylate connexins and the involvement of both lysosomal and proteasomal pathways in degrading connexins. This paper will review the evidence that connexin phosphorylation regulates, stimulates or <b>triggers</b> <b>gap</b> junction disassembly, internalization and degradation...|$|R

40|$|Describes {{a simple}} <b>triggered</b> vacuum <b>gap</b> {{developed}} for initiating electric arcs in vacuum which uses the property that the voltage required to breakdown {{a gap in}} vacuum {{in the presence of}} a solid insulating material is considerably less than the voltage required in the absence of such material. In this <b>triggered</b> vacuum <b>gap</b> a solid insulating material is used in the angular space between the main cathode and the concentric trigger electrode forming the auxiliary gap. Different materials like epoxy resin, Teflon (PTFE) and mica have been used. The trigger voltage was found to vary in the range 560 - 1840 V. The results with epoxy and Teflon were unsatisfactory because the trigger voltages showed wide scatter and the auxiliary gap was soon bridged by metal particles eroded from the electrodes. Though the trigger voltages required with mica were relatively high, consistent triggering could be obtained for a large number of trials before the auxiliary gap was bridged. This was probably due to better thermal stability of mica as compared with either epoxy or Teflon...|$|R

40|$|The {{intestine}} is {{a common}} site for invasion by intracellular pathogens, but {{little is known about}} how pathogens restructure and exit intestinal cells in vivo. The natural microsporidian parasite N. parisii invades intestinal cells of the nematode C. elegans, progresses through its life cycle, and then exits cells in a transmissible spore form. Here we show that N. parisii causes rearrangements of host actin inside intestinal cells as part of a novel parasite exit strategy. First, we show that N. parisii infection causes ectopic localization of the normally apical-restricted actin to the basolateral side of intestinal cells, where it often forms network-like structures. Soon after this actin relocalization, we find that gaps appear in the terminal web, a conserved cytoskeletal structure that could present a barrier to exit. Reducing actin expression creates terminal web gaps in the absence of infection, suggesting that infection-induced actin relocalization <b>triggers</b> <b>gap</b> formation. We show that terminal web gaps form at a distinct stage of infection, precisely timed to precede spore exit, and that all contagious animals exhibit gaps. Interestingly, we find that while perturbations in actin can create these gaps, actin is not required for infection progression or spore formation, but actin is required for spore exit. Finally, we show that despite large numbers of spores exiting intestinal cells, this exit does not cause cell lysis. These results provide insight into parasite manipulation o...|$|R

40|$|Under natural circumstances, saccade-vergence eye {{movements}} {{are among the}} most frequently occurring. This study examines the properties of such movements focusing on short-term repetition effects. Are such movements robust over time or are they subject to tiredness ? Twelve healthy adults performed convergent and divergent combined eye movements either in a gap task (i. e., 200 ms between the end of the fixation stimulus {{and the beginning of the}} target stimulus) or in an overlap task (i. e., the peripheral target begins 200 ms before the end of the fixation stimulus). Latencies were shorter in the gap task than in the overlap task for both saccade and vergence components. Repetition had no effect on latency, which is a novel result. In both tasks, saccades were initiated later and executed faster (mean and peak velocities) than the vergence component. The mean and peak velocities of both components decreased over trials in the gap task but remained constant in the overlap task. This result is also novel and has some clinical implications. Another novel result concerns the accuracy of the saccade component that was better in the gap than in the overlap task. The accuracy also decreased over trials in the gap task but remained constant in the overlap task. The major result of this study is that under a controlled mode of initiation (overlap task) properties of combined eye {{movements are}} more stable than under automatic <b>triggering</b> (<b>gap</b> task).
