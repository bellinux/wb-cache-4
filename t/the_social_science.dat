5|$|In 2014's The Giver, {{a motion}} picture {{adaptation}} of the young adult novel, Streep played a community leader. Set in 2048, <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>science</b> fiction film recounts {{the story of a}} post-apocalyptic community without war, pain, suffering, differences or choice, where a young boy is chosen to learn the real world. Streep was aware of the book before being offered the role by co-star and producer Jeff Bridges. Upon its release, The Giver was met with generally mixed to negative reviews from critics. Streep also had a small role in the period drama film The Homesman (2014). Set in the 1850s midwest, the film stars Hilary Swank and Tommy Lee Jones as an unusual pair who help three women driven to madness by the frontier to get back East. Streep does not appear until {{near the end of the}} film, playing a preacher's wife, who takes the women into care. The Homesman premiered at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival where it garnered largely positive reviews from critics.|$|E

40|$|This thesis makes a {{contribution}} to the debate about the status of <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>sciences.</b> Many philosophers have argued that <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>sciences</b> are unlike <b>the</b> natural sciences because they involve a kind of interpretative inquiry which has no parallel in the natural sciences. Stronger versions of this argument suggest that <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>sciences</b> are dominated or exhausted by interpretation. In many cases, this stronger claim is supported by an appeal to an analogy between interpretation in <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>sciences</b> and interpretation in the arts. The claim of this thesis is that the analogy between interpretation in the arts and <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>sciences</b> is not as strong as it is often thought to be. Works of art can be subjected to several distinct kinds of interpretation. Not all of these different kinds have analogues in <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>sciences.</b> In particular, conceptions of interpretation which allow for multiple incompatible interpretations of a single artwork have no corollary in <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>sciences.</b> By questioning <b>the</b> analogy between interpretation in the two fields, I seek to develop a limited version of naturalism in <b>the</b> philosophy of <b>social</b> <b>science.</b> That is, I argue that there are similarities and points of contact between <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>sciences</b> and <b>the</b> natural sciences. This position is strengthened by a further argument: that those who have opposed naturalism have tended to rely on an outdated and overly-rigid view of the what the natural sciences are like. The naturalism I defend is limited because it accepts that there are differences between <b>the</b> natural and <b>social</b> <b>sciences,</b> including <b>the</b> {{fact that there is a}} role (but not a dominating role) for interpretation in <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>sciences.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|Mathematical {{models are}} a well {{established}} tool in most natural sciences. Although {{models have been}} neglected by the philosophy of science for a long time, their epistemological status as a link between theory and reality is now fairly well understood. However, regarding the epistemological status of mathematical models in <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>sciences,</b> there still exists a considerable unclarity. In my paper I argue that this results from specific challenges that mathematical models and especially computer simulations face in <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>sciences.</b> <b>The</b> most important difference between <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>sciences</b> and <b>the</b> natural sciences with respect to modeling is that in <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>sciences</b> powerful and well confirmed background theories (like Newtonian mechanics, quantum mechanics or the theory of relativity in physics) do not exist in <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>sciences.</b> Therefore, an epistemology of models that is formed on the role model of physics may not be appropriate for <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>sciences.</b> I discuss <b>the</b> challenges that modeling faces in <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>sciences</b> and point out their epistemological consequences. The most important consequences are that greater emphasis must be placed on empirical validation than on theoretical validation and that the relevance of purely theoretical simulations is strongly limited...|$|R
