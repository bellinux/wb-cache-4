5|$|The {{result that}} 0.999... = 1 generalizes readily in two ways. First, every nonzero number with a finite decimal {{notation}} (equivalently, endless <b>trailing</b> 0s) has a counterpart with <b>trailing</b> 9s. For example, 0.24999... equals 0.25, exactly {{as in the}} special case considered. These numbers are exactly the decimal fractions, and they are dense.|$|E
5|$|Titania's orbit lies {{completely}} {{inside the}} Uranian magnetosphere. This is important, because the <b>trailing</b> hemispheres of satellites orbiting inside a magnetosphere are struck by magnetospheric plasma, which co-rotates with the planet. This bombardment {{may lead to}} the darkening of the <b>trailing</b> hemispheres, which is actually observed for all Uranian moons except Oberon (see below).|$|E
5|$|Trojan moons are {{a unique}} feature only {{known from the}} Saturnian system. A trojan body orbits at either the leading L4 or <b>trailing</b> L5 Lagrange point {{of a much larger}} object, such as a large moon or planet. Tethys has two trojan moons, Telesto (leading) and Calypso (<b>trailing),</b> and Dione also has two, Helene (leading) and Polydeuces (<b>trailing).</b> Helene is by far the largest trojan moon, while Polydeuces is the {{smallest}} and has the most chaotic orbit. These moons are coated with dusty material that has smoothened out their surfaces.|$|E

5|$|The Callistoan {{surface is}} asymmetric: the leading {{hemisphere}} is {{darker than the}} <b>trailing</b> one. This is different from other Galilean satellites, where the reverse is true.

5|$|The Ganymedian surface albedo is very asymmetric; {{the leading}} {{hemisphere}} is {{brighter than the}} <b>trailing</b> one. This is similar to Europa, but the reverse for Callisto. The <b>trailing</b> hemisphere of Ganymede appears to be enriched in sulfur dioxide. The distribution of carbon dioxide does not demonstrate any hemispheric asymmetry, {{although it is not}} observed near the poles.

5|$|The first {{dorsal fin}} {{is large and}} triangular, with a pointed apex and a concave <b>trailing</b> margin; it {{originates}} roughly over the posterior insertions of the pectoral fins. The second dorsal fin {{is less than a}} third as high as the first, and originates ahead of the anal fin. There is no midline ridge between the dorsal fins. The long pectoral fins are broad and slightly falcate (sickle-shaped), becoming narrow and pointed at the tips. The anal fin has a sharply notched <b>trailing</b> margin. The caudal peduncle has a deep notch on its upper surface at the caudal fin origin. The caudal fin is asymmetrical, with a well-developed lower lobe and a longer upper lobe with a notch in the <b>trailing</b> margin near its tip.|$|E

The main difference is the speed of plasma flow—supersonic in the case of Earth and subsonic in the case of Ganymede.

5|$|The {{surface of}} Metis is heavily cratered, dark, {{and appears to}} be reddish in color. There is a {{substantial}} asymmetry between leading and <b>trailing</b> hemispheres: the leading hemisphere is 1.3 times brighter than the <b>trailing</b> one. The asymmetry is probably caused by the higher velocity and frequency of impacts on the leading hemisphere, which excavate a bright material (presumably ice) from its interior.|$|E
5|$|The {{surface of}} Thebe {{is dark and}} appears to be reddish in color. There is a {{substantial}} asymmetry between leading and <b>trailing</b> hemispheres: the leading hemisphere is 1.3times brighter than the <b>trailing</b> one. The asymmetry is probably caused by the higher velocity and frequency of impacts on the leading hemisphere, which excavate a bright material (probably ice) from the interior of the moon. The surface of Thebe is heavily cratered and it appears that {{there are at least three}} or four impact craters that are very large, each being roughly comparable in size to Thebe itself.|$|E
5|$|The wings {{were of a}} broad 55 m² (590ft²) {{area and}} had a span of 18 m (59ft 0⅝ in) with a {{straight}} leading edge which curved in a near-perfect semicircle into the <b>trailing</b> edge. The positions of the wing roots were offset. The leading edge wing root merged with {{the top of the}} fuselage and cockpit. As the wing extended backwards, by roughly two thirds, it declined downwards at a sharp angle so that the <b>trailing</b> edge wing root ended nearly halfway {{down the side of the}} fuselage increasing the angle of incidence. This design feature was used on all future Dornier bomber designs, namely the Dornier Do 217. The <b>trailing</b> edge was faired into the round fuselage shape. The engine nacelle was also faired into the flaps. The extreme rear of the nacelle was hollow and allowed the flap with an attached vertical slot to fit into the cavity when deployed.|$|E

5|$|Among Uranus's {{five major}} moons, Ariel {{is the second}} closest to the planet, {{orbiting}} at the distance of about 190,000km. Its orbit has a small eccentricity and is inclined very little relative to the equator of Uranus. Its orbital period is around 2.5Earth days, coincident with its rotational period. This means that {{one side of the}} moon always faces the planet; a condition known as tidal lock. Ariel's orbit lies completely inside the Uranian magnetosphere. The <b>trailing</b> hemispheres (those facing away from their directions of orbit) of airless satellites orbiting inside a magnetosphere like Ariel are struck by magnetospheric plasma co-rotating with the planet. This bombardment may lead to the darkening of the <b>trailing</b> hemispheres observed for all Uranian moons except Oberon (see below). Ariel also captures magnetospheric charged particles, producing a pronounced dip in energetic particle count near the moon's orbit observed by Voyager 2 in 1986.|$|E
