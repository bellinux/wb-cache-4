5|$|The Blockburger test, {{originally}} {{developed in the}} multiple punishments context, is also <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>for</b> prosecution after conviction. In Grady v. Corbin (1990), the Court held that a double jeopardy violation could lie even where the Blockburger test was not satisfied, but Grady was overruled in United States v. Dixon (1993).|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>test</b> <b>for</b> {{judicial}} review on matters not {{relating to the}} ISA remains the objective test. In Kamal Jit Singh v. Minister for Home Affairs (1992), the High Court held that validity of detention under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act is not dependent on the Minister's subjective satisfaction. Rather, the Minister must be objectively satisfied that the person was associated with criminal activities.|$|E
5|$|For {{there to}} be a claim in private nuisance, the {{claimant}} must show that the defendant's actions caused damage. This can be physical damage, as in St Helen's Smelting Co v Tipping, or discomfort and inconvenience. <b>The</b> <b>test</b> <b>for</b> remoteness of damage in nuisance is reasonable foreseeability, as established in Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Counties Leather plc; if the defendant was using their land unreasonably and causing a nuisance, the defendant is liable even if they used reasonable care to avoid creating a nuisance. The test {{is whether or not the}} nuisance was reasonably foreseeable; if it was, the defendant is expected to avoid it.|$|E

5|$|From 1912, Godley began putting {{plans in}} place for the rapid {{deployment}} of a New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) in the event of war in Europe. He anticipated that Imperial Germany would be the likely enemy and envisaged deployment to either Europe or possibly Egypt, to counter the likely threat to the Suez Canal in the event Turkey aligned itself with Germany. He envisioned the expected deployment would be co-ordinated with an Australian Imperial Force (AIF) and liaised with the Australian Chief of General Staff, Brigadier General Joseph Gordon, and the possibility of a composite division was discussed. The question of Germany's possessions in the South Pacific was also raised, and it was agreed that New Zealand would have responsibility for German Samoa, while Australia dealt with German New Guinea. The arrangements Godley put {{in place for}} deployment for the NZEF were soon put to <b>the</b> <b>test,</b> <b>for</b> when the First World War began, a New Zealand occupation force was quickly assembled to occupy German Samoa.|$|E
5|$|However, the United Kingdom courts {{gradually}} {{adopted a}} single sufficient interest test for all prerogative orders. In R. v. Commissioners of Customs and Excise, ex parte Cook (1969), for example, the High Court used a sufficient interest test {{to determine whether}} an applicant had standing {{to apply for a}} mandatory order. Singapore followed the UK's move towards a uniform test for all prerogative orders. In Re Lim Chor Pee, ex parte Law Society of Singapore (1986), the Court of Appeal endorsed the sufficient interest test for mandatory orders. In that case, the Law Society of Singapore had applied for a mandamus (now known as a mandatory order) to ensure that the Disciplinary Committee heard and investigated all six charges levied against an advocate and solicitor. The Court, applying the decision of the House of Lords in R. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners, ex parte National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses Ltd. (1981), held that <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>for</b> standing was whether the applicant had a sufficient interest in the subject matter, and not whether he or she had a specific legal right.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} 1309 when Gibraltar's defences were put to <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>for</b> {{the first time in}} the First Siege of Gibraltar. That year Ferdinand IV of Castile and James II of Aragon joined forces to attack the Muslim Emirate of Granada, {{targeting}} Almería in the east and Algeciras, across the bay from Gibraltar, in the west. In July 1309 the Castilians laid siege to both Algeciras and Gibraltar. By this time the latter had a modest population of around 1,200 people, a castle and rudimentary fortifications. They proved unequal to the task of keeping out the Castilians and Gibraltar's Nasrid defenders surrendered after a month. Ferdinand gave up the siege of Algeciras the following February but held on to Gibraltar, expelling the Moors and repopulating it with Christians. A keep and dockyard were built on his orders to secure Castile's hold on the peninsula. Ferdinand also issued a letters patent granting privileges to the inhabitants to encourage people to settle, as it was initially not regarded as a particularly hospitable place to live.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>test</b> time <b>for</b> core-external {{interconnect}} {{shorts and}} opens is typically {{much less than}} that for core-internal logic. Therefore, prior work on test-infrastructure design for core-based system-ona-chip (SOC) has mainly focused on minimizing <b>the</b> <b>test</b> time <b>for</b> core-internal logic. However, as feature sizes shrink for newer process technologies, <b>the</b> <b>test</b> time <b>for</b> signal integrity (SI) faults on interconnects cannot be neglected. <b>The</b> <b>test</b> time <b>for</b> SI faults can be comparable to, or even larger than, <b>the</b> <b>test</b> time <b>for</b> <b>the</b> embedded cores. We investigate the impact of interconnect SI tests on SOC test-architecture design and optimization. A compaction method for SI faults and algorithms for test-architecture optimization are also presented. Experimental results for the ITC’ 02 benchmarks show that the proposed approach can significantly reduce <b>the</b> overall <b>testing</b> time <b>for</b> core-internal logic and core-external interconnects...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> Phenistix {{screening}} <b>test</b> <b>for</b> phenylketonuria in newborn infants, {{when used}} routinely at the recommended age of 4 to 6 weeks, passes as normal a substantial proportion—perhaps between a quarter and a half—of {{children with the}} disease, who are then diagnosed only after brain damage has occurred. Screening procedures based on three other tests—namely, <b>the</b> paper chromatography <b>test</b> <b>for</b> o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid in urine, <b>the</b> Guthrie <b>test</b> <b>for</b> phenylalanine in blood, and a modification of <b>the</b> Guthrie <b>test</b> <b>for</b> phenylalanine in urine—have been compared {{with each other and}} with <b>the</b> Phenistix <b>test</b> in a special field inquiry.

5|$|The Norman castle's defences {{were put}} to <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>for</b> {{the first time in}} the Rebellion of 1088, when Norman barons allied with Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy rebelled against the new king William Rufus. The barons, who were also {{supported}} by William the Conqueror's half-brothers Robert of Mortain and Bishop Odo of Bayeux, defended Pevensey Castle against an army led personally by William Rufus. Although the castle's defences were strong enough to resist assaults from land and sea, its defenders were forced to surrender when they ran out of food after six weeks. Robert was allowed to keep the castle but his son William, Count of Mortain was stripped of it, along with his other English estates, after rebelling against Henry I in the early 12th century.|$|E
