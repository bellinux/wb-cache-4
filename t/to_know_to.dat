25|$|Peirce said that, {{in order}} <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>to</b> what a sign refers, the mind needs {{some sort of}} {{experience}} of the sign's object, experience outside, and collateral to, the given sign or sign system. In that context he spoke of collateral experience, collateral observation, collateral acquaintance, all {{in much the same}} terms. For example, art work can exploit both the richness and the limits of the audience's experience; a novelist, in disguising a roman à clef, counts on the typical reader's lack of personal experience with the actual individual people portrayed. Then the reader refers the signs and interpretants in a general way to an object or objects of the kind that is represented (intentionally or otherwise) by the novel. In all cases, the object (be it a quality or fact or law or even fictional) determines the sign to an interpretant through one's collateral experience with the object, collateral experience in which the object is newly found or from which it is recalled, even if it is experience with an object of imagination as called into being by the sign, as can happen not only in fiction but in theories and mathematics, all of which can involve mental experimentation with the object under specifiable rules and constraints. Through collateral experience even a sign that consists in a chance semblance of an absent object is determined by that object.|$|E

500|$|According to a 1994 study {{published}} in the journal Sociology of Religion, [...] "ost sannyasins indicated that they believed that [...] knew about Ma Anand Sheela's illegal activities." [...] Frances FitzGerald writes in Cities on a Hill that most of Rajneesh's followers [...] "believed [...] incapable of doing, or willing, violence against another person", and that almost all thought the responsibility for the criminality was Sheela's – according to FitzGerald, the followers believed the guru had not known anything about it. Carus writes in Toxic Terror that, [...] "There is no way <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>to</b> what extent [...] participated in actual decision-making. His followers believed he was involved in every important decision that Sheela made, but those allegations were never proven." [...] Rajneesh insisted that Sheela, who he said was his only source of information during his period of isolation, used her position to impose [...] "a fascist state" [...] on the commune. He acknowledged that the key to her actions was his silence.|$|E
500|$|Morrell {{was born}} at Rye, in Westchester County, New York, on July 5, 1795. He grew up in Stonington, Connecticut, where his father, also named Benjamin, was {{employed}} as a shipbuilder. Morrell, after minimal schooling, ran away to sea {{at the age of}} 17 [...] "without taking leave of any member of my family, or intimating my purpose to a single soul". During the War of 1812, which broke out while he was at sea, he was twice captured by the British; on his first voyage his ship, carrying a cargo of flour, was intercepted off St John's, Newfoundland, and Morrell was detained for eight months. His second voyage landed him in Dartmoor prison, England, for two years. After his release Morrell continued his seafaring career, sailing before the mast as an ordinary seaman since his lack of education prevented him advancing to officer rank. A sympathetic captain, Josiah Macy, taught him what he needed <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>to</b> qualify as an officer, [...] and in 1821 he was appointed chief mate on the sealer Wasp, under Captain Robert Johnson.|$|E
500|$|Carl Marbach of AVweb wrote {{positively}} of {{the first}} portion of the book, but was critical of the latter half: [...] "On the whole, the book has some worthwhile sections notwithstanding the soap opera ramblings at the end. Read the first half, then pass it along to another pilot-friend." [...] John Clark of The Plain Dealer gave the book a positive review, but was also critical of the instructive section {{at the end of}} the book: [...] "Narratively, the book breaks down when Schiavo resorts to lists and tables to provide information to help the reader fly more safely." [...] Robert W. Poole Jr. reviewed the book for Reason, and called it [...] "valuable and frustrating". Poole noted [...] "Only an outsider-insider like Schiavo could provide ordinary people with authentic accounts of how badly off-track the FAA has gotten in its job of looking after aviation safety," [...] but commented that some aviation veterans regarded her as a [...] "loose cannon". Jerry Fraser of The Boston Globe was critical in his review of the book, and wrote that [...] "a book that sets out to be 'everything you need <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>to</b> travel safer by air' winds up griping about how the FAA reimburses employees for moving expenses and conducts crude management-training seminars". The book received a critical review from Bill Adair in the St. Petersburg Times, who wrote: [...] "Schiavo is right about many problems at the FAA. ... But Schiavo seems unable to offer a calm and constructive account of the FAA's problems. She'd rather grab headlines with wild and often inaccurate comments." ...|$|E

2500|$|Only animals {{specifically}} slaughtered {{for food}} or {{for use in}} the sacrificial service could be eaten. Detailed lists of which animals, birds and fish could be eaten and which were prohibited appear in the Bible ( [...] and [...] ), and animal bones found in the archaeological record tend to support this, with some exceptions. For the Israelites, food was one way for self-definition. While it is impossible <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>to</b> what extent dietary laws were observed, self-definition is a most likely the basis for certain biblical lists listing different kinds of animals permitted or forbidden for consumption. The taboo against eating certain animals, particularly the pig, may have developed from the early Iron Age.|$|E
