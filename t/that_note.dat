25|$|The {{circle is}} {{commonly}} used to represent the relationship between diatonic scales. Here, the letters on the circle are taken to represent the major scale with <b>that</b> <b>note</b> as tonic. The numbers {{on the inside of}} the circle show how many sharps or flats the key signature for this scale has. Thus a major scale built on A has 3 sharps in its key signature. The major scale built on F has 1 flat.|$|E
25|$|The QAPF diagram {{has four}} {{minerals}} or mineral groups chosen as important cornerstones of the classification. These are quartz (Q), Alkali feldspars (A), plagioclase feldspars (P), and feldspathoids (F). F and Q for chemical reasons {{can not exist}} together in one plutonic rock. Other minerals may and almost certainly occur in these rocks as well {{but they have no}} significance in this classification scheme. So, the whole diagram is actually composed of two ternary plots (QAP and FAP). To use the classification, the concentration (the mode) of these minerals must be known and recalculated to make their sum 100%. For example: a plutonic rock that contains no alkali feldspar and no feldspathoids but contains lots of pyroxenes (neglected in this diagram), plagioclase feldspar and few quartz grains is probably gabbro (located at the right edge of the diagram, near P). This diagram does not determine whether a rock is gabbro, diorite, or anorthosite. There are another criteria used to decide <b>that.</b> <b>Note</b> that this diagram is not used for all plutonic rocks. Ultramafic rocks are the most important plutonic rocks that have separate classification diagrams.|$|E

Timmons dismissed {{the idea that he}} was deliberately a composer: [...] "I'm a dilettante as a composer. I have never consciously sat down and tried to write a song." [...] He stated that his method of composing a new song might involve [...] "whistling, playing around with the notes, or at a club. I'll tell one musician to play this note, another <b>that</b> <b>note,</b> and we kick it around." [...] One account of the creation of [...] "Moanin'" [...] was given by Golson: Timmons had the opening eight bars, which he often played between tunes, but formed the complete song only after Golson encouraged him to add a bridge.|$|E
500|$|Schuur {{started singing}} {{when she was}} about three years old. Her mother, who died when Schuur was 13, loved jazz and had a Duke Ellington record collection. Her father, a police captain, was an amateur {{musician}} who often played piano with his daughter sitting by his side. Schuur stated, [...] "As far back as I can remember, singing was in my blood. My parents loved music, and I loved to sing. I was scatting at an early age". She has absolute pitch memory. Unlike the average person, in Schuur's mind every sound – musical or not – has a note value; for example, if she hears a humming motor, she knows the name <b>that</b> <b>note</b> has on a musical instrument. Schuur listened to the radio avidly in her youth; her early musical idols were Sarah Vaughan and Dinah Washington. She said that as a small child she would often retreat to a closet to sing.|$|E
40|$|In the {{classical}} monetary debates, the Banking School held <b>that</b> <b>notes</b> would be equally demand-elastic whether supplied by many issuers {{or a single}} one. The Free Banking School held <b>that</b> <b>notes</b> would be less demand-elastic if supplied by a single issuer. These assertions have rarely, if ever, been subject to more stringent statistical testing.

500|$|On 24 July 1999, Climbié {{was taken}} by Kouao to the accident-and-emergency {{department}} at North Middlesex Hospital with severe scalding to her head and other injuries. The hospital {{found no evidence of}} scabies. Consultant Mary Rossiter felt Climbié was being abused but still wrote 'able to discharge' on her notes. According to Maureen Ann Meates, another doctor at the hospital, when Rossiter had written <b>that</b> <b>note,</b> she had noted that Climbié was exhibiting signs of neglect, emotional abuse and physical abuse. Later, in the inquiry, Rossiter said that by writing 'able to discharge', she did not mean she wanted Climbié to go home, merely that she was physically fit to leave. Garnham said, [...] "quite how the subtlety of that distinction was to be ascertained from the notes is far from obvious". Rossiter admitted to the inquiry that she had expected police and social services to follow up on the case. For a brief period while Climbié was in hospital, Enfield social services took up the case before passing it to Haringey.|$|E
500|$|Margaret Lyons of Entertainment Weekly {{agreed that}} the episode was [...] "another solid 30 Rock", but was {{somewhat}} less positive, writing that it [...] "didn't quite slay me like the last few episodes have."

I get that that's her bit, but... <b>that</b> <b>note</b> is starting to drive me crazy." [...] IGN contributor Robert Canning also delivered a mixed review of the episode, writing that he laughed [...] "quite a bit" [...] but said it ultimately [...] "felt like it could have been so much more." [...] Canning also concluded his review by stating that it [...] "fell shy of being an absolute classic." [...] Writing for The Palm Beach Post Kevin D. Thompson said [...] "While last night's episode was far from unwatchable, it wasn't one of the show's best, either. But as I've written before, a so-so 30 Rock is still better than 99 percent of TV's other so-called comedies." [...] Thompson noted that he was not thrilled with the return of Dean Winters as Dennis, and called his plot with Liz and Jenna [...] "the show's least interesting plot".|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Ken Tucker {{gave the}} episode an A, posing the question: [...] "Has there {{ever been a}} TV show more aptly named than Glee? It both embodies and inspires exactly that quality." [...] Glee was the top ranked topic on social {{networking}} site Twitter {{on the night of}} its initial airing. Alessandra Stanley for The New York Times called the show [...] "blissfully unoriginal in a witty, imaginative way", saying the characters are [...] "high school archetypes" [...] but noted [...] "a strong satiric pulse that doesn’t diminish the characters’ identities or dim the showmanship of a talented cast". The Daily News David Hinckley wrote that the show [...] "isn't close to perfect" [...] but [...] "has likable characters, {{a good sense of humor}} and a reasonably deft touch with music." [...] He called the pilot episode [...] "not very plausible" [...] but [...] "potentially heartwarming", writing of the musical choices: [...] "The duet of [...] "You're the One That I Want" [...] from Grease may be a little obvious, but setting a group dance routine to Amy Winehouse's [...] "Rehab" [...] shows some inspiration. Whether Glee can hold <b>that</b> <b>note</b> remains a very unanswered question. But it will at least be worth watching to see." [...] USA Today Robert Bianco assessed: [...] "There's a lot to like here: the exuberance of the musical numbers, the bite to the comedy and the joy of seeing something different. It has casting and tone problems, but it has all summer to fix them." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{gameplay}} {{is similar}} to other music and rhythm video games, in that the player must press buttons on a game controller in time with scrolling notes on the game screen to complete a song. The basic mechanics are based on Konami's Guitar Freaks. In the case of Guitar Hero, the player may use either the guitar peripheral (a 3/4-scale reproduction of the Gibson SG guitar as bundled with the game, or a third-party version) or a standard controller to play the scrolling notes. The guitar peripheral has five different-colored fret buttons near the nut of the guitar neck, and a strum bar and a whammy bar {{on the body of}} the guitar. The peripheral also has other buttons in order to navigate the game's menus. Music is displayed on screen through a series of notes, matching in color and position to the fret buttons, that scroll down the screen on a fret board. To hit or play a note, the player must hold down the fret button corresponding to the note shown and toggle the strum bar {{at the same time as}} <b>that</b> <b>note</b> passes a marked area on the screen. Faster series of notes may be played on the guitar controller using hammer-on and pull-off techniques where the player does not need to strum each note. [...] The game supports toggling the handedness of the guitar, allowing both left-handed and right-handed players to utilize the guitar controller. A player using the standard controller simply presses the buttons that correspond with the displayed notes as outlined in the game's manual.|$|E
500|$|Hank Williams, {{who heard}} both the Miller and Griffin versions, started {{performing}} the {{song on the}} Louisiana Hayride shortly after joining in August 1948. Horace Logan, the show's producer and programming director for KWKH, reported that the audience [...] "went crazy" [...] the first time Williams performed the song on the show. [...] In light of the live audience's strong positive reaction, Williams decided to record the song. His decision was questioned by his musicians and also his producer, Fred Rose, who felt that the song did not merit a recording. Williams, mindful of the reaction he received live, [...] persisted, and the recording {{took place during the}} final half-hour of a session recorded at Herzog Studio in Cincinnati, Ohio, on December 22, 1948. For this recording, Williams replaced the jazz musicians with a modern country music band, using a rhythm guitar, mandolin, string bass, drums and a steel guitar. [...] Williams' session band was composed of Clyde Baum (mandolin), Zeke Turner (electric guitar), Jerry Byrd (steel guitar), Louis Innis (rhythm guitar), Tommy Jackson (fiddle) and Willie Thawl (bass). With little time left, Byrd and Turner replicated the musical arrangement they previously used on an Ernest Tubb session for a cover of Jimmie Rodgers' [...] "Waiting for a Train". [...] In the episode of American Masters about Williams, Drifting Cowboy Don Helms recalls, [...] "When they recorded 'Lovesick Blues,' Fred told Hank, 'That song's out of meter! [...] Got too many bars in it. [...] And you hold <b>that</b> <b>note</b> too long.' [...] And Hank said, 'Well, when I find a note I like, I wanna hold on to it as long as I can,' you know, just tryin' to be funny. [...] And Fred said, 'Well, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. [...] That thing is so much out of meter, I'm gonna get me {{a cup of coffee and}} when I get back maybe ya'll have that thing cut.' [...] And they did, but it was still out of meter. [...] So Fred lived with that the rest of his life." [...] Williams combined Griffin's lyrical arrangement with a two-beat honky-tonk track, borrowing the yodeling and beat drops from Miller's recording. [...] "Lovesick Blues" [...] was recorded in two takes.|$|E
