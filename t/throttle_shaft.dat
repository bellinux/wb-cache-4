50|$|Over much use, {{the steel}} primary <b>throttle</b> <b>shaft</b> {{will tend to}} wear the {{aluminum}} casting material in the throttle body. This results in a minor air leak and in extreme cases, can cause the primary throttle blades to not close properly. This results in poor idle quality. The aftermarket has responded; several vendors are supplying repair kits for the carburetor body, generally {{in the form of}} teflon bushings.|$|E
50|$|And for 1991, the 700R4 {{was renamed}} to 4L60. The TBI (throttle body injection) system {{used on the}} Blazer's {{standard}} 5.7-liter V-8 had longer <b>throttle</b> <b>shaft</b> bearings, new throttle return springs, and improved fuel mixture distribution. The 5.7-liter V-8 also had new heavy-duty intake valves and powdered metal camshaft sprockets. Standard on all engines was a lighter more powerful 100-amp CS130 alternator. Two new exterior colors, Brilliant Blue and Slate Metallic were offered.|$|E
50|$|Pneumatic: the {{governor}} mechanism detects air {{flow from the}} flywheel blower used to cool an air-cooled engine. The typical design includes an air vane mounted inside the engine's blower housing and linked to the carburetor's <b>throttle</b> <b>shaft.</b> A spring pulls the throttle open and, as the engine gains speed, increased air flow from the blower forces the vane back against the spring, partially closing the throttle. Eventually a point of equilibrium will be reached and the engine will run at a relatively constant speed. Pneumatic governors are simple in design and inexpensive to produce. However, they do not regulate engine speed very accurately and are affected by air density, as well as external conditions that may influence airflow.|$|E
50|$|Within a year, the {{controller}} had become {{larger and more}} complex. A breadboard electronic version complete with sensor amplifiers and large control modules consumed the entire back end of a station wagon. Input data came from variable reluctance sensors installed at the front drive shaft, rear drive <b>shaft,</b> <b>throttle,</b> brakes, and steering. The goal was to control clutch actuation by controlling current.|$|R
40|$|System {{flow control}} components, such as valves or pumps {{are a part}} of routine {{operation}} in a water distribution system. When a flow control component changes state the steady-state flow condition in the system is altered. The values of the initial flow conditions of the system, characterized by the measured velocity and pressure at positions along the pipeline change with time until the final flow conditions are established in a new steady-state condition. The physical phenomenon that occurs during this time interval is known as a hydraulic transient. Transients resulting from more rapid changes in flow rate are called waterhammer. The waterhammer causes excessively high and low pressures, which can lead to failure in the pipe system. The implementation of a surge tank is a method to intercept and reduce rapidly these extreme pressure situations. For the new hydropower station Jinping 2 in Sichuan province Southwest of china, the optimum type and dimensions of a surge shaft need to be determined. Within this thesis, a Matlab program is applied to determine the highest and lowest pressures in the pipe system, especially at the valve. Further the mass oscillations in the tank are of significant interest. The investigated surge shaft is a differential surge shaft. Variation of the dimensions of the orifice, the riser, and the maintank, and their interdependency are observed, reported and the optimum dimensions are determined. Another group of students has performed a similar investigation for a <b>throttled</b> surge <b>shaft</b> alternative, and the final results are compared between the differential and <b>throttled</b> surge <b>shaft</b> designs.

25|$|The {{two most}} common methods used for testing {{centrifugal}} compressors is to test along lines of constant shaft speed or along lines of constant <b>throttle.</b> If the <b>shaft</b> speed is held constant, test points are taken along a constant speed line by changing throttle positions. In contrast, if a throttle valve is held constant, test points are established by changing speed (common gas turbine practice). The map shown in Figure 5.2 illustrate {{the most common}} method; lines of constant speed. In this case we see data points connected via straight lines at speeds of 50%, 71%, 87%, and 100% RPM. The first three speed lines have 6 points each while the highest speed line has five.|$|R
5000|$|The Saab 96 had a {{longitudinally}} mounted engine layout. As first designed, it had a 841 cc, 38 hp (28 kW) three-cylinder Saab two-stroke engine. By 1965 {{this was}} increased to [...] An optional [...] version of the engine, with triple carburetors and oil injection, {{was used in the}} Sport and Monte Carlo models. The additional power was obtained from a modified cylinder head and filled crankshaft counterweights offering higher overall compression ratio. The Saab 96 of 1964 was tweaked to [...] For 1966 models, the standard 96 841 cc engine, using pre-mix oil, appeared with a three throat Solex carburetor in which the center carburetor handled start, idle, and low speed functions, increasing the power to [...] The same carburetor had been used in the Monte Carlo and Sport models. A common <b>throttle</b> <b>shaft</b> minimized carburetor synchronization problems.|$|E
5000|$|The Quadrajet is a [...] "spread bore" [...] carburetor; {{the primary}} {{venturis}} are {{much smaller than}} the secondary venturis. By comparison, a [...] "square bore" [...] carburetor has primary and secondary venturis of similar size. Most Quadrajets were capable of 750 ft3 L/min (cfm) maximum, but some rare Buick and Pontiac models were capable of 800 ft3 L/min for use on high performance engines, and most 1984-1987 pickup trucks were also equipped with the 800-cfm carb. Most Quadrajets use a vacuum operated piston to move the primary metering rods to control the air-fuel ratio, allowing the mixture to be lean under low load conditions and rich during high load conditions. A less-common version uses a linkage driven off the primary <b>throttle</b> <b>shaft</b> to mechanically move the power piston. [...] "E" [...] (electronic control module controlled) series of Quadrajets use a computer controlled mixture control solenoid that responds to electronic signals from the throttle position and oxygen sensors via the computer, ideal for precise fuel metering and allowing additional fuel under load. The solenoid-controlled metering rods allow the fuel mixture to be very close to optimum, then the solenoid is pulse width modulated at about 6 Hz to fine-tune the air fuel ratio under closed loop conditions. The electronic versions have a throttle position sensor that is mounted inside the carburetor body, actuated by the accelerator pump lever.|$|E
