5|$|Hazareesingh (2004) explores how Napoleon's {{image and}} memory are best understood. They {{played a key}} role in {{collective}} political defiance of the Bourbon restoration monarchy in 1815–1830. People from different walks of life and areas of France, particularly Napoleonic veterans, drew on the Napoleonic legacy and its connections with <b>the</b> <b>ideals</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1789 revolution.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his life, Lafayette was an {{exponent}} of <b>the</b> <b>ideals</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Age of Enlightenment, {{especially on}} human rights and civic nationalism. Despite {{the fact that he}} spent most of his political career in opposition, his views were taken very seriously by intellectuals and others on both sides of the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|During the {{preceding}} Tang dynasty, {{the civil service}} examinations did not yet produce {{the high number of}} officials as they would during the Song dynasty; a hereditary aristocracy remained dependent on the court for attaining rank and holding office. Song rulers, particularly Emperor Huizong, encountered a great deal of political opposition despite attempts to attain <b>the</b> <b>ideals</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sage kings of antiquity. The inability of the sovereign to monopolize political authority was linked to the rise of a new class of gentry and scholar-official who filled the bureaucracy.|$|E

40|$|Inside the Nazi {{concentration}} camps Jewish prisoners experienced extreme forms of exclusion, humiliation and violence. Disqualified as <b>the</b> “countertype” <b>of</b> <b>the</b> “Aryan” man, they were denied {{not only their}} participation in the “national community” but also their male dignity. This paper looks at various attempts of Jewish prisoners to preserve and assert their gendered identities in <b>the</b> face <b>of</b> terror by analysing three different manifestations of masculinity to be found in autobiographical sources: <b>the</b> <b>ideal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> revolutionary fighter for <b>the</b> class struggle, <b>the</b> <b>ideal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emancipated “Bildungsbürger” and patriarch, and finally <b>the</b> <b>ideal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soldier internalised through Jewish men’s active participation in the German wars...|$|R

5|$|After the Third Partition of Poland (1795), many Poles {{believed}} that revolutionary France, whose public opinion was very sympathetic to <b>the</b> <b>ideals</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Polish Constitution of 3 May 1791, {{would come to}} Poland's aid. France's enemies included Poland's partitioners, Prussia, Austria and Imperial Russia. Paris was the seat of two Polish organizations laying the {{claim to be the}} Polish government-in-exile, the Deputation (Deputacja) of Franciszek Ksawery Dmochowski and the Agency (Agencja) of Józef Wybicki. Many Polish soldiers, officers and volunteers therefore emigrated, especially to Italy and to France. Eventually, the Agency was successful in convincing the French government (the Directory) to organize a Polish military unit. As the French Constitution did not allow for the employment of foreign troops on French soil, the French decided to use the Poles to bolster their allies in Italy, the Cisalpine Republic.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Periyar in 1973, {{conferences}} were held throughout Tamil Nadu for a week in January 1974. The same year Periyar's wife, Maniyammai, {{the new head of}} the Dravidar Kazhagam, set fire to the effigies of 'Rama', 'Sita' and 'Lakshmana' at Periyar Thidal, Madras. This was in retaliation to the Ramaleela celebrations where effigies of 'Ravana', 'Kumbakarna' and 'Indrajit' were burnt in New Delhi. For this act she was imprisoned. During the 1974 May Day meetings held at different places in Tamil Nadu, a resolution urging the Government to preserve 80 percent of jobs for Tamils was passed. Soon after this, a camp was held at Periyar Mansion in Tiruchirapalli to train young men and women to spread <b>the</b> <b>ideals</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dravidar Kazhagam in rural areas.|$|E
5|$|Dissatisfaction {{became more}} evident during the 1880s, and some {{officers}} began to display open insubordination. The Emperor {{and the politicians}} did nothing to improve the military nor meet their demands. The dissemination of Positivist ideology among young officers brought further complications, as Positivism opposed the monarchy under the belief that a dictatorial republic would bring improvements. A coalition between a mutinous Army faction and the Positivist camp was formed and directly led to the republican coup on 15 November 1889. Battalions and even full regiments of soldiers loyal to the Empire, who shared <b>the</b> <b>ideals</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> older generation of leaders, attempted to restore the monarchy. Attempts at a restoration proved futile and supporters of the Empire were executed, arrested or forcibly retired.|$|E

5|$|Several {{critics have}} made exactly the {{opposite}} interpretation, reading the poem as a comic critique of the Christianity of the time, particularly as embodied in the Christian chivalry of Arthur's court. In its zeal to extirpate all traces of paganism, Christianity had cut itself off from the sources of life in nature and the female. The green girdle represents all the pentangle lacks. The Arthurian enterprise is doomed unless it can acknowledge the unattainability of <b>the</b> <b>ideals</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Round Table, and, {{for the sake of}} realism and wholeness, recognize and incorporate the pagan values represented by the Green Knight.|$|E
5|$|The Civil War {{brought with}} it {{the end of the}} {{consensus}} among English Protestants {{that there should be a}} single church imposed by the state, though there was still not complete freedom of religion. <b>The</b> <b>ideals</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dissenting brethren of the Assembly were significant in the rise of denominationalism, the doctrine that the church is found in several institutions rather than a single one in a given location. Though Protestants already commonly recognized the validity of churches in different territories, the outcome of the Assembly's debates marks the wider acceptance of the idea that several true churches may be found in the same territory.|$|E
5|$|According {{to those}} historians, the Spanish {{revolution}} against absolutism got {{mixed up with}} the Peninsular War. When FerdinandVII stood against his father CharlesIV, who {{was seen as an}} absolutist king, many Spaniards got the mistaken impression that he sympathized with the new enlightened ideas. Thus, the revolutions made in the Americas in the name of FerdinandVII (such as the May Revolution, the Chuquisaca Revolution, or the one in Chile) would have sought to replace absolutist power with power formulated under the new ideas. Even if Spain was at war with France, <b>the</b> <b>ideals</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French Revolution (liberty, equality and fraternity) were still respected. Those revolutions pronounced themselves enemies of Napoleon, but did not face any active French military attack; they promoted instead fights between Spanish armies for keeping either the old or new order. This situation would change with the final defeat of Napoleon and the return of FerdinandVII to the throne, as he began the Absolutist Restoration and persecuted the supporters of the new libertarian ideas within Spain. For people in South America, to stay {{as a part of the}} Spanish Empire, but with a new relationship with the mother country, was no longer a feasible option: the only remaining options at this point were to return to absolutism or to adopt independentism.|$|E

5|$|During the 18th century <b>the</b> <b>ideals</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Western European Enlightenment and the French Revolution became {{widely known}} to the Greek scholars. They soon {{realized}} the potential of these new ideals, and especially of popular freedom and sovereignty for their own national struggle against Ottoman rule. Adamantios Korais, a humanist scholar and leading figure of the modern Greek Enlightenment, had stressed the desirability of a printed medium, written in the vernacular language, in order to spread these ideas to the Greek people, that lived in the Ottoman Empire and the Diaspora in Western Europe as well. Korais explained about {{the necessity of a}} periodical that would gather material from political and philological newspapers of the enlightened peoples of Europe and contain reports from Ottoman-ruled Greece. He also stressed that this should be edited by a man of learning, and proposed that his friend Anthimos Gazis, scholar and Orthodox priest in Vienna, would be the most suitable person.|$|E
5|$|Lemoine was {{accepted}} into the École Polytechnique in Paris {{at the age of}} twenty, the same year as his father's death. As a student there, Lemoine, a presumed trumpet player, helped to found an amateur musical group called La Trompette, for which Camille Saint-Saëns composed several pieces. After graduation in 1866, he considered a career in law, but was discouraged by the fact that his advocacy for republican ideology and liberal religious views clashed with <b>the</b> <b>ideals</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incumbent government, the Second French Empire. Instead, he studied and taught at various institutions during this period, studying under J. Kiœs at the École d'Architecture and the École des Mines, teaching Uwe Jannsen at the same schools, and studying under Charles-Adolphe Wurtz at the École des Beaux Arts and the École de Médecine. Lemoine also lectured at various scientific institutions in Paris and taught as a private tutor for a period before accepting an appointment as a professor at the École Polytechnique.|$|E
5|$|The drive {{towards a}} boycott {{was fueled by}} {{the large number of}} African nations which became {{independent}} in the late 1950s and early 1960s. To prevent the new nations from overwhelming the ISFs, Brundage proposed that the federations adopt weighted voting systems to allow earlier members to wield disproportionate influence, which some did. By 1962, with the suspension of South Africa from FIFA (the association football governing body), Brundage had come around to the position that South Africa's racist policies were inconsistent with <b>the</b> <b>ideals</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Olympic movement. At the 1963 IOC session in Baden-Baden (moved there from Nairobi when Kenyan officials refused to issue visas to South African representatives), the IOC voted to suspend South Africa from the Olympics unless its NOC and government adopted non-discrimination policies regarding Olympic selection. This did not come to pass, and South Africa did not participate in 1964. In 1968, Brundage and the IOC invited a South African team (supposedly to be multiracial) to the Mexico City Games, but under a threatened boycott and with evidence of minimal South African compliance, withdrew it.|$|E
