5|$|Despite {{an injury}} <b>to</b> <b>pace</b> {{spearhead}} Ray Lindwall, Bradman's fast bowlers reduced England {{in their first}} innings to 8/74 before finishing them off for 165. Bradman dropped two catches in this innings. English gloveman Godfrey Evans came to the crease with the score at 6/60, and hit Johnston hard to cover, where the ball went through Bradman for a boundary. The second chance went through Bradman's hand and struck him in the abdomen. However, these missed catches did not cost Australia much, as Evans was soon caught at short leg by Morris close in, leaving England at 7/74. England managed to recover somewhat after Laker and Bedser added 89 runs in only 73 minutes for the ninth wicket. At first, Bradman did not appear concerned by the partnership, and it was surmised {{that he may have}} been happy for England to continue batting so that his top order would not have to bat in fading light {{towards the end of the}} afternoon, but he became anxious as the total continued to mount and both Bedser and Laker appeared comfortable.|$|E

5|$|Following several stages won by sprinters and {{breakaway}}s, {{the next}} {{test for the}} riders was the legendary Alto de El Angliru in Stage 13. The morning breakaway was afforded over eleven minutes, but it was dropped to nothing on the ascent {{of what has been}} called the most difficult climb in all of professional cycling. Astana and Caisse d'Epargne both had many support riders in the leading group going up the climb, and they alternately tried to set paces to protect either Contador or Alejandro Valverde while isolating the competition. It was left to Leipheimer <b>to</b> <b>pace</b> Contador to the conclusion as the climb reached its hardest part, 7 kilometers from the finish. Contador indeed {{went on to win the}} stage, and took the race lead as well. Contador added another stage win the next day when only he and Leipheimer could respond to the repeated attacks of Ezequiel Mosquera, and Contador won the sprint.|$|E
5|$|In the 1500m, Talbot {{decided that}} Windle would {{attack from the}} outset and attempt to hang on in the latter stages of the race.

Windle broke the Olympic record in the heats {{with a time of}} 17min 15.9s to qualify fastest for the final by more than six seconds. In the final, Windle repeated the strategy of sprinting from the start, leading throughout to lower his own Olympic record to 17min 1.7s and holding off American John Nelson by 1.3s. Windle's tactics disrupted the raceplan of the Americans; Nelson and world record holder Roy Saari had planned <b>to</b> <b>pace</b> each other throughout the race, but ended up reacting to Windle instead of swimming their own race. As a result, Saari finished in seventh place, far outside his global standard.|$|E
5|$|Johnston {{played as}} a left-arm fast bowler {{when the ball}} was new and conducive <b>to</b> <b>pace</b> bowling, before {{reverting}} to finger spin when it became old and lost its shine. He was Australia's third fast bowler in the Tests, reinforcing the new ball pairing of Keith Miller and Ray Lindwall, who were {{regarded as one of}} the finest pace duos of all time. Bradman typically used Miller and Lindwall in short and sharp new ball bursts against the local batsmen. England had agreed that a new ball would be available every 55 overs, a milestone that usually came more frequently than the old regulation of 200 runs for every ball. This allowed Australiawho had the superior pace attackmore frequent use of a shiny ball, which swung at high pace. Johnston typically bowled pace after the first-choice pair had finished their new ball spell, before reverting to spin when the ball was worn. He took 27 wickets at 23.33 in the Tests, making him the equal-leading wicket-taker along with Lindwall, who averaged 19.62. The Australian pacemen’s tally was substantially more than the next best, recorded by England's Alec Bedser, who took 18 wickets at 38.22.|$|E

The {{goal of this}} study was to review the clinical and imaging presentation of cardiac perforation related <b>to</b> <b>pacing</b> lead displacement. Patients and methodsThe clinical and imaging files of four patients (two men and two women) who experienced cardiac perforation related <b>to</b> <b>pacing</b> lead displacement were reviewed. The four patients were investigated in our radiology department over a 24 -month-period. ResultsTwo patients had clinical symptoms at the time lead displacement was detected and the other two were free of symptoms. In all patients, lead displacement was visible on imaging examinations in retrospect but was not detected prospectively. ConclusionRadiologists should pay attention to the position of the tips of the leads on chest X-ray and CT, even late after the implantation and in asymptomatic patients...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Captive animals exhibit stereotypic <b>pacing</b> in {{response}} <b>to</b> multiple causes, including {{the inability to}} escape from human contact. Environmental enrichment techniques can minimize pacing expression. By using an individual-based approach, we addressed whether {{the amount of time}} two males and a female jaguar (Panthera onca) devote <b>to</b> <b>pacing</b> varied with the number of visitors and tested the effectiveness of cinnamon and black pepper in reducing pacing. The amount of time that all jaguars engaged in pacing increased significantly with the number of visitors. Despite the difference between the males regarding age and housing conditions, both devoted significantly less time <b>to</b> <b>pacing</b> following the addition of both spices, which indicates their suitability as enrichment techniques. Mean time devoted <b>to</b> <b>pacing</b> among the treatments did not differ for the female. Our findings pointed out to the validity of individual-based approaches, as they can reveal how suitable olfactory stimuli are to minimizing stereotypies irrespective of particular traits...|$|R

25|$|CRT {{devices have}} at least two leads, one passing through the vena cava and the right atrium into the right {{ventricle}} to stimulate the septum, and another passing through the vena cava and the right atrium and inserted through the coronary sinus <b>to</b> <b>pace</b> the epicardial wall of the left ventricle. Often, for patients in normal sinus rhythm, there is also a lead in the right atrium to facilitate synchrony with the atrial contraction. Thus, timing between the atrial and ventricular contractions, as well as between the septal and lateral walls of the left ventricle can be adjusted to achieve optimal cardiac function.|$|E

However, 1999 proved to be the year of renaissance for Dravid's ODI career.
