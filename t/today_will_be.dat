25|$|The Communist radical of <b>today</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> the {{administrator}} of tomorrow, and the Communist Society will need the radical as badly as the capitalist society needs him now. It will then be {{the business of the}} radical, as it is now, not to take an appointment as justice of the Supreme Court, not to perform any particular function {{as a part of the}} established order, but to stand apart and speak his mind about the established order.... A radical who wishes to continue being a radical cannot do so if he is an essential part of the existing order, for then he owes a certain fealty to his position. I have seen Socialists elected to office; they become, not critical functionaries, but administrators, and one cannot be both at the same time.|$|E

500|$|Authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter {{describe}} [...] "Ding Dong" [...] as the [...] "quickest song" [...] that Harrison ever wrote, {{in terms}} of time spent on the composition. The words for the song's middle eight – [...] "Yesterday, today was tomorrow / And tomorrow, <b>today</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> yesterday" [...] – came from another pair of inscriptions from Crisp's time at Friar Park. Harrison found these lines in what he called [...] "the garden building", carved in stone around two matching windows. The only other lyrics in [...] "Ding Dong, Ding Dong" [...] are the song title, repeated four times to serve as its chorus. Sung in imitation of a clock chiming, the chorus lyrics, combined with the message of those of the verse, lend the composition an obvious New Year's theme. Harrison later described the song as [...] "very optimistic", and suggested: [...] "Instead of getting stuck in a rut, everybody should try ringing out the old and ringing in the new… [...] sing about it, but they never apply it to their lives." ...|$|E

500|$|Homer and Marge are {{scheduled}} to do a singing toast at their cousin Valerie's wedding, causing Marge to become nervous, due to her fear of embarrassment. Homer tells her not to worry, saying that he will {{make sure they do}} not mess up. Homer gets a fortune cookie stating that <b>today</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> his lucky day, but he does not believe so. However, he starts to believe this occurs when he crashes into a vending machine causing all of the snacks to fall out on him, and finds an Emerson, Lake & Palmer CD in the parking lot. He sings along to [...] "Lucky Man", driving recklessly to the synthesizer solo. He then goes to the Kwik-E-Mart for a lottery ticket, even though he has to go to the wedding and sing with Marge. After a long wait, Homer gets his lottery ticket, only to find out the wedding has ended. When he takes his eyes off the road for a second, he crashes off the ramp. Homer wakes up in the hospital after the crash, and realizes he won a million dollars in the lottery. Homer does not want Marge to know he missed the wedding to get a lottery ticket, and has Barney pose as the winner. So that Marge does not know he won the money, he secretly leaves gifts for his family members. However, when Homer tries to get money out of the tree where he hid the money, Bart discovers that he won the lottery. Threatening to tell Marge, Bart demands that Homer publicly embarrasses himself, does unethical tasks, and becomes a victim of his own son. Eventually, Homer decides to tell Marge himself and get it over with. Taking Marge on a hot-air balloon, he reveals he won the lottery, causing Marge to become very glad and not furious about his absence at the wedding; he tells her he spent it all, leaving them poor as usual. However, Marge does not care, saying at least they have each other. Homer then reveals he spent the last of the money on a giant cherry blossom grove in the shape of Marge's face with the words [...] "Love of my Life". They then sing the song they were supposed to sing at the wedding together, off in the sunset.|$|E

He was a proponent of achieving Philippine self-government peacefully through institutional reform rather than through violent revolution, and would only support [...] "violent means" [...] as a last resort. Rizal believed that the only justification for national liberation and self-government was the restoration of the dignity of the people, saying [...] "Why independence, if the slaves of <b>today</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> the tyrants of tomorrow?" [...] However, through careful examination of his works and statements, including Mi Ultimo Adios, Rizal reveals himself as a revolutionary. His image as the Tagalog Christ also intensified early reverence to him.|$|E
