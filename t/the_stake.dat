At one point, 250 men from <b>the</b> <b>stake</b> served in the war, and Kimball ensured that each received {{a copy of the}} monthly stake bulletin and often wrote personal notes on each copy to the recipient.|$|E
5|$|In England, burning was a legal {{punishment}} {{inflicted on}} women {{found guilty of}} high treason, petty treason and heresy. Over {{a period of several}} centuries, female convicts were publicly burnt at <b>the</b> <b>stake,</b> sometimes alive, for a range of activities including coining and mariticide.|$|E
5|$|P.Sampath, {{president}} of the Tamil Nadu Untouchability Eradication Front (TNUEF) and an office-bearer politician from the Tamil Nadu unit of Communist Party of India (Marxist) (known as CPI (M)), calls the Chidambaram fire-trail as Brahmin propaganda to conceal the truth that Nandanar was burnt at <b>the</b> <b>stake.</b>|$|E

5|$|Tannakin's {{deformity}} {{was soon}} discovered, and many locals came {{to hear her}} pig-like speech or to watch her feed from the trough. The old woman was located, tried and convicted for witchcraft, but even at <b>the</b> <b>stake</b> refused or was unable to reverse the enchantment.|$|E
5|$|As {{with much}} of England, Chesham {{suffered}} serious religious unrest in the 16th and 17th centuries, and in 1532 Lollard radical Thomas Harding was burnt at <b>the</b> <b>stake</b> in the town for heresy. From the 17th century Chesham was a focus for dissenters. The first Baptist chapel in the town opened in 1701, Quakers have met in Chesham since the late 17th century, and John Wesley preached in Chesham in the 1760s.|$|E
5|$|During the retreat, Crawford and {{an unknown}} number of his men were captured. The Indians {{executed}} many of these captives in retaliation for the Gnadenhutten massacre that occurred earlier in the year, in which about 100 peaceful Indians were murdered by Pennsylvanian militiamen. Crawford's execution was particularly brutal: he was tortured for at least two hours before being burned at <b>the</b> <b>stake.</b> His execution was widely publicized in the United States, worsening the already-strained relationship between Native Americans and European Americans.|$|E

5|$|In 1960, Union Bank of Switzerland {{acquired}} an 80% stake in Argor SA, a Swiss precious metals refinery founded in 1951 in the canton of Ticino. In 1973, the bank increased <b>the</b> <b>stake</b> to full 100% ownership, though the ownership was ultimately sold between 1986 and 1999 to Argor-Heraeus SA. UBS continues to issue gold bars via Argor-Heraeus which {{is famous for}} the unique kinebar holographic technology it uses to provide enhanced protection against bank gold bar counterfeiting.|$|E
5|$|In June 1955, at age 27, Monson {{became a}} {{counselor}} to Percy K. Fetzer {{in the presidency}} of the Salt Lake Temple View Stake. He was replaced as bishop of the 6th-7th ward the following month. In <b>the</b> <b>stake</b> presidency, Monson oversaw the stake's Primary, Sunday School, MIA, athletics and budget, until he was moved to Holladay, Utah, in June 1957. In Holladay, Monson was assigned to a ward building committee, to coordinate ward members' volunteer service to build a meetinghouse.|$|E
5|$|Later that night, Jerry {{finds out}} from his mother that Elaine knows about <b>the</b> <b>stake</b> out. On {{the day of the}} wedding, Elaine tells Jerry that the reason that she was angry was {{because it was the first}} time she saw him flirt with another woman. They decide that they have to be able to talk more about their {{relationships}} if they wish to remain friends. Elaine then reveals that she has recently met a man using a stake out.|$|E

At the time, <b>the</b> <b>stake</b> carried a purse of $1,000.|$|E
5|$|South Africa's Comair and Denmark's Sun Air of Scandinavia {{have been}} franchisees of British Airways since 1996.

BA also owned a 10% stake in InterCapital and Regional Rail (ICRR), the company that managed the operations of Eurostar (UK) Ltd from 1998 to 2010, when the management of Eurostar was restructured.|$|E
5|$|The final {{fight of}} Johnson's early period, during which <b>the</b> <b>stake</b> money was {{relatively}} low, was his comprehensive win over a ponderous fighter called Fry for a prize of 50guineas at Kingston. The fight, which lasted less than 30minutes, ended with Fry badly beaten up and Johnson {{with barely a}} scratch on him. This fight did not attract many supporters of the sport; it took place on 6June 1786 and was therefore during the period when the wealthy were away from London.|$|E

5|$|Achieving her {{objective}} was, however, not straightforward. The Pope {{was only}} {{prepared to accept}} reunion when church property disputes had been settled—which, in practice, meant letting those who had bought former church property keep it. Thus did Cardinal Pole arrive to become Archbishop of Canterbury in Cranmer's place. Mary could have had Cranmer imprisoned as he was tried and executed for treason—he had supported the claims of Lady Jane Grey—but she resolved to have him tried for heresy. His recantations of his Protestantism {{would have been a}} major coup. Unhappily for her, he unexpectedly withdrew his recantations at the last minute as he was to be burned at <b>the</b> <b>stake,</b> thus ruining her government's propaganda victory.|$|E
5|$|As an example, the {{execution}} scene in The Kingdom of This World puts European and autochthonous cultures in opposition {{through the use}} of the spectator-performer relationship. In this spectacle situation, Carpentier is able to juxtapose the Europeans' experience of Macandal's body falling into the flames with the autochthonous (Afro-Haitian) experience of Macandal's body flying off <b>the</b> <b>stake.</b> Through the different, mutable views of the performance that he creates, Carpentier is able to represent an unstable cultural identity. As a second example, the scene that Ti Noel constructs around himself after the sacking of the Sans-Souci Palace presents the reader with a dramatic rehearsal in which Ti Noel represents culturally mobile subjectivity by performing different identities on his own.|$|E
5|$|As {{they read}} the end, Joan of Arc is being burnt at <b>the</b> <b>stake,</b> still waiting for God to save her (the real Joan had said several days earlier that her voices had spoken to her of martyrdom). Shocked, Lisa asks Homer if she was really burned to death. Marge then interrupts, {{claiming}} that Joan of Arc was rescued by Sir Lancelot, and they get married and live in a spaceship. She then rips out the last page and eats it, remarking that {{it is easier to}} chew than the video of Bambi.|$|E

50|$|Limahong {{finally arrived}} at the {{particular}} spot where <b>the</b> <b>stakes</b> were driven. Here, amidst blinding fires, Limahong had ropes fastened about the shoulders of his men and {{at the point of}} the sword, they were forced to go overboard. Then wrapping arms and legs about <b>the</b> <b>stakes</b> to act as human grappling hooks, the Chinese began their ugly job of pulling <b>the</b> <b>stakes.</b>|$|R
5|$|During the Ottoman rule of Greece, impalement {{became an}} {{important}} tool of psychological warfare, intended to put terror into the peasant population. By the 18th century, Greek bandits turned guerrilla insurgents (known as klephts) became an increasing annoyance to the Ottoman government. Captured klephts were often impaled, as were peasants that harbored or aided them. Victims were publicly impaled and placed at highly visible points, and had the intended effect on many villages who not only refused to help the klephts, but would even turn them in to the authorities. The Ottomans engaged in active campaigns to capture these insurgents in 1805 and 1806, {{and were able to}} enlist Greek villagers, eager to avoid <b>the</b> <b>stake,</b> in the hunt for their outlaw countrymen.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with such}} {{conflicting}} accounts {{and unable to}} reach a conclusion, the Parlement announced on 15 September {{that the two men}} would fight to the death on 27 November 1386 to decide guilt in the case. If Carrouges lost, then Marguerite would be burnt at <b>the</b> <b>stake</b> for perjury. In fact, the duel was delayed a month as the King and his court, which contained most of the country's senior dukes and generals, was held up on campaign in Flanders and could not return in time. Eager to see what was rapidly becoming the event of the season, the King ordered the duel postponed until 29 December so that he would be present for its culmination.|$|E
5|$|Fury, Javier and his witchbreed {{launch a}} {{successful}} attack on Count Doom's fortress. The Four of the Fantastick are freed, and Doom is horribly scarred {{by what he}} believes is the Templar's treasure; in fact, Donal's walking stick is the true treasure, and using it Donal becomes the Norse god Thor. Having nowhere else to go, the ship of fugitives heads for the New World. In Spain, Enrique, the Inquisitor who has killed so many witchbreed, is exposed as a witchbreed himself and sentenced to be burned at <b>the</b> <b>stake</b> with his young acolytes, Petros and Sister Wanda. Enrique breaks their bonds and they escape on a ship of their own, also bound for America.|$|E
