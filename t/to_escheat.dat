25|$|The {{extension}} of his estates through the Harthill inheritance was for long uncertain. At {{the death of}} his grandfather, Richard Harthill, there was still a male heir in the family, a ten-year-old grandson called William, who was intended to inherit the majority of the estates. Richard had appointed feoffees to ease the transition, although there were reports that the tenants had no connection with the feoffees and an inquisition post mortem decided that Pooley and the rest ought <b>to</b> <b>escheat</b> to the king during William's minority. In March 1401 an inquiry was held at Tamworth, Staffordshire, into the age of William and it transpired that he was 21, old enough to take over his estates, although he his wardship was still held by Roger Sapurton. Only with the death of William sine prole in the summer of 1402 could it be certain that his aunt Elizabeth, Sir John Cokayne's mother, would inherit. However, matters were still far from straightforward. For example, an inquisition at Tamworth on 10 August found that Elizabeth's stepmother, Mary, was still alive and held a third of the estate at Newton Regis. After the death of Edmund Cokayne in 1403, Elizabeth married John Francis (also rendered Franceys and Fraunceys) of Ingleby, apparently in the same year, She and Francis settled the manor of Harthill on Sir John Cockayne at about the time of their marriage but Elizabeth seems to have been in no hurry to hand over any more of her inheritance to her son. The quitclaim dated 21 April 1416 but issued on 5 May 1417, after her death, listed the manors and properties that made up the Harthill inheritance.|$|E

Further, that this Acour alleged himself to be the lawfully married husband of Eve Clavering, the heiress of Sir John Clavering, a point upon which his Grace demanded information, since if this were true he purposed <b>to</b> <b>escheat</b> the Clavering lands. With this brief and stern announcement the letter ended.|$|E
6000|$|... "Under the feodal system, {{the tenant}} {{originally}} held his lands entirely at {{the will of}} the lord, and at his death they reverted to the lord again. The services to be performed for the lord were uncertain and unlimited. The copyhold was also subject to a variety of grievous taxes, which the lord had the privilege, upon many occasions, of imposing--such as aids, reliefs, primer seisin, wardship, escheats for felony and want of heirs, and many more, altogether so exorbitant and oppressive as often totally to ruin the tenant and rob him of almost all interest in his property. {56} The difference of the circumstances under which the lands in the manor of Merdon are, and, as it seems, always were held, is remarkably striking: here the copyhold is hereditary, the services are certain and limited, the fines are fixed and unchangeable, the lord has no right of wardship, neither is the copyhold liable <b>to</b> <b>escheat</b> for felony; the widow of a tenant has also a right of inheritance, and the tenement may be let without the lord's consent for a year. All which circumstances appear to bespeak an original and fundamental difference of tenure from that of the feodal system, and are, I presume, to be considered, not as encroachments that have gradually grown upon that system, but as being of a more liberal extraction and much greater antiquity. {57a} But besides these differences, the supposition here advanced has this farther ground to rest upon, viz. that neither the name of MERDON, nor that of HURSLEY, is so much as mentioned in the great survey of the kingdom, called Domesday-Book, which, if the intention of that survey be rightly understood, {57b} it seems next to a certainty that one or other of them would have been had the new system been here adopted. Nor, when it is considered that this was CHURCH property, and that in many instances the alterations were not enforced, {58} out of favour as it is supposed to the landholder, who was partial to the more ancient tenure, ought it to be thought extraordinary that the customs in this manor did not undergo the general change; since, if favour were desirable and shown to any, who were so likely to expect and to find it as the clergy? But however this point may really be, it appears evident that the tenants of this manor have, from the earliest times to which we have the means of resorting for information, enjoyed many unusual rights and immunities, and that their services were, in many respects, far from being so base and servile as those of the strictly feodal tenant.|$|E

5000|$|... ==The arguments== The plaintiff, {{the state}} of Texas, argued that the State with “the most {{significant}} ‘contacts’ with the debt should be allowed exclusive jurisdiction <b>to</b> <b>escheat</b> it,” and that under this test {{the state of}} Texas had the best claim to jurisdiction over the unclaimed property. The plaintiffs also argued that Texas had a superior claim <b>to</b> <b>escheat</b> {{on the grounds that}} at least the part of the intangible obligations were “royalties, rents, and mineral proceeds derived from land located in Texas.” The state of New Jersey countered with the argument that the State with power <b>to</b> <b>escheat</b> was the state that was the domicile of the debtor, in this case New Jersey, where Sun Oil Co. was incorporated. Pennsylvania, in a similar vein to New Jersey, argued that it was the location of the debtor’s “principal offices,” rather than state of incorporation, that had jurisdiction <b>to</b> <b>escheat</b> the property.|$|E

50|$|Texas v New Jersey (1965) is a United States Supreme Court {{decision}} {{handed down}} on February 1, 1965. Concerning {{the authority of}} the state <b>to</b> <b>escheat,</b> or take title to, unclaimed personal property, the Court was petitioned, under its power of original jurisdiction, to adjudicate a disagreement between three states, Texas, New Jersey, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, over which state had the jurisdiction <b>to</b> <b>escheat</b> intangible personal property, such as debts. Recognizing the lack of any extant constitutional or statutory formula to decide jurisdiction, the Warren Court accepted the case, assigning a Special Master to compile evidence and recommend a solution that the states could use for similar cases in the future. Adopting the Special Masters suggestions, the Court, in a decision authored by Justice Hugo Black, ruled that the authority <b>to</b> <b>escheat</b> intangible personal property lay with the state of the creditor’s last known address, rather than the state of the debtor’s incorporation or headquarters, a formula used in previous cases.|$|E

25|$|Jurisdiction over Crown {{property}} is {{divided between the}} provincial legislatures and the federal parliament, with the key provisions Sections 108, 109, and 117 of the Constitution Act, 1867. Public works are {{the property of the}} federal Crown, and natural resources are within the purview of the provinces. Title to such {{property is}} not vested in one jurisdiction or another, however, since the Canadian Crown is indivisible. Section 109 has been given a particularly-broad meaning; provincial legislation regulating labour used to harvest and the disposal of natural resources does not interfere with federal trade and commerce power, and royalties have been held to cover the law relating <b>to</b> <b>escheats.</b> Canada cannot unilaterally create Indian reserves, since the transfer of such lands requires federal and provincial approval by Order in Council (although discussion exists about whether this is sound jurisprudence).|$|R

5000|$|While {{the state}} of Texas argued that “this {{intangible}} property {{should be treated as}} situated in Texas, so as to permit that State to escheat,” two other areas, {{the state of}} New Jersey, where Sun Oil Co. was incorporated, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, where their corporate offices were located, argued for their own right <b>to</b> <b>escheat.</b> Since the Supreme Court had ruled three years previously, in [...] Western Union Co. v Pennsylvania (1961), that one state had “no power to render a judgment of escheat which would bar...any other State from escheating the same property”, the state of Texas petitioned the court, under Art. III, 2, of the Constitution, which gave the Court original jurisdiction over cases between states, for a definitive declaration of rights on the subject. Noting that “since the States separately are without constitutional power to provide a rule to settle this interstate controversy and since there is no applicable federal statute,” the Court accepted the case, arguing that it was their responsibility “in the exercise of our original jurisdiction to adopt a rule which will settle the question of which State will be allowed <b>to</b> <b>escheat</b> this intangible property.” ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{state of}} Florida, given leave {{to act as}} an intervenor due to its claim on {{intangible}} property Sun Oil Co. owed to creditors whose last known address was in Florida, argued that the debt was the property of the creditor, not the debtor, and that “fairness among the States requires that the right and power <b>to</b> <b>escheat</b> the debt should be accorded to the State of the creditor's last known address as shown by the debtor's books and records.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Accepting {{the logic}} that the debt in {{question}} was {{the property of the}} creditor rather than the debtor, the Court adopted the plan offered by the state of Florida, that power <b>to</b> <b>escheat</b> should reside {{in the state of the}} creditors last known address. “Adoption of such a rule,” Black wrote, “involves a factual issue simple and easy to resolve, and leaves no legal issue to be decided.” “By using a standard of last known address,” the Court concluded, “rather than technical legal concepts of residence and domicile, administration and application of escheat laws should be simplified.” ...|$|E

50|$|One of the {{earliest}} known marriage promotion laws, the Lex Papia Poppaea, imposed penalties on those who refused to get married before a certain age.

5000|$|The {{concept of}} the Crown took form under the feudal system. Though not used this way in all {{countries}} that had this system, in England, all rights and privileges were ultimately bestowed by the ruler. Land, for instance, was granted by the Crown to lords in exchange for feudal services and they, in turn, granted the land to lesser lords. One exception to this was common socage—owners of land held as socage held it subject only to the Crown. When such lands become owner-less they are said <b>to</b> <b>escheat</b> i.e., return to direct ownership of the Crown (Crown lands). Bona vacantia is the Royal prerogative by which un-owned goods become {{the property of the}} Crown.|$|E
