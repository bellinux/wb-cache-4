5|$|Cheryl Cole later {{stated that}} despite her {{initially}} hating the song, {{that the success}} of the single taught the group that they were not always right regarding single decisions and that they needed <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> label from time to time.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the large}} {{interest}} in the group, the Herberts quickly set about creating a binding contract for them. Encouraged by the reaction they had received at the showcase, all five members delayed signing contracts on the legal advice from, amongst others, Victoria Beckham's father, Anthony Adams. In March 1995, because of the group's frustration at their management's unwillingness <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> visions and ideas, they parted from Heart Management. In order to ensure they kept {{control of their own}} work, the group retrieved the master recordings of their discography from the management offices. The next week they were supposed to meet with Sheffield-based producer Eliot Kennedy. The Herberts arranged the session weeks before the group's departure.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} {{has since}} become {{a prime example of}} successful crew resource management. For much of aviation's history, the captain was considered the final authority, and crews were to respect the captain's expertise and not question him. This began to change in the 1970s, especially after the Tenerife airport disaster. Crew Resource Management, while still considering the captain the final authority, instructs crewmembers to speak up when they detect a problem, and instructs captains <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> concerns. United Airlines instituted a Crew Resource Management class in the early 1980s. The NTSB would later credit this training as valuable toward the success of United 232's crew in handling their emergency. The FAA made Crew Resource Training mandatory {{in the aftermath of the}} accident.|$|E

5|$|The {{only reason}} the Nazis put on {{prisoner}} broadcasts {{is to get}} people justifiably anxious about relatives reported missing at the front <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> propaganda. Although many of the messages undoubtedly are true, they represent but {{a small fraction of}} our prisoners and we have no assurance that many of them are not faked from papers picked up on the battlefield. What concerns some of us is the consequences of listening to Nazi broadcasts unless you are a well-trained listener (and often, even if you are). Nazi arguments often sound plausible. A person may listen to them with all the skepticism in the world, knowing that every word is a lie. But if the content is sufficiently sensational (and it often is) the source may be forgotten in time, and out pops the Nazi lie, all unsuspecting.|$|E

25|$|Cockpit {{procedures}} were also changed. Hierarchical relations among crew members were played down. More emphasis {{was placed on}} team decision-making by mutual agreement. Less experienced flight crew members were encouraged to challenge their captains when they believed something was not correct, and captains were instructed <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> crew and evaluate all decisions in light of crew concerns. This concept was later expanded into what is known today as crew resource management (CRM), training in which is now mandatory for all airline pilots.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Kelly {{moved to}} Alice Springs {{and started to}} {{establish}} further contacts with community members, organisations and institutions across the APY Lands.

He spent time in Bhopal with the people, <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> stories.

500|$|Bodanzky and Bolognesi {{spent four}} months in Trieste, Italy editing the film along with Italian editors Jacopo Quadri and Letizia Caudullo. However, the film was [...] "dreamed, written and filmed" [...] for Brazilian people, so they then {{returned}} to Brazil <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> opinions. After some screenings in Brazil, they felt the film was not working as they wanted. On the airplane back to Italy, they rewrote the screenplay; they focused more on Neto and removed minor characters and subplots, while emphasizing the son-father relationship. When they arrived they had a long discussion with the Italian producers before finally agreeing and finishing the film. The film was finalized in October at the Cinecittà studio in Rome, using the THX mixing technology and the standard Dolby Digital.|$|E

Critics also praised the addition of the customisable radio station, which allows players <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> own choice of music; Tom Chick of 1UP.com named it the best feature of the port, and Steven Hopper of GameZone called it a [...] "great touch". The port's upgrade to 32 concurrent players in the online multiplayer mode, as opposed to the console version's 16 players, was also met with positive feedback; Eurogamer's Gillen said that the [...] "possibility for mayhem... increases", while Will Tuttle of GameSpy felt that the player increase [...] "changes the action significantly".|$|E
500|$|Schuster {{was born}} on 22 August 1869 to Frederick Schuster, a manager of the Manchester firm of merchants Schuster, Fulder and Company, and his wife Sophia Wood, the {{daughter}} of a Lieutenant Colonel in the Indian Army. The family described themselves as [...] "Unitarian" [...] but were descended from Jews who had converted to Christianity in the mid-1850s and included other notable people such as Sir Arthur Schuster, Sir Felix Schuster, and later Sir George Schuster. From the age of seven he was educated at St. George's School, Ascot, {{one of the most expensive}} preparatory schools in the country but one known for harsh treatment; it was standard for the headmaster to flog pupils until they bled and force other students and staff <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> screams. During the school holidays he accompanied his father to Switzerland, where he developed a lifelong love of mountaineering and skiing. He was president of the Alpine Club from 1938 to 1940.|$|E
500|$|Art Modell, a New York {{advertising}} executive, {{bought the}} team in 1961 for almost $4 million ($ today). Modell, who was 35 {{years old at the}} time, bought out Brown's 15% stake in the team for $500,000 and gave Brown a new eight-year contract. He said he and Brown would have a [...] "working partnership", and began to play a more direct role than previous owners in the team's operation. [...] This angered Brown, who was used to having a free hand in football matters. Modell, who was single and only {{a few years older than}} most players, started <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> concerns about the coach. He became particularly close to Jim Brown, calling him [...] "my senior partner". Modell sat in the press box during games and could be overheard second-guessing Paul Brown's play-calling, which drove a deeper wedge between the two men. At that time, Brown was the only coach who insisted on calling every offensive play. When Plum openly questioned Paul Brown's absolute control over play-calling, he was traded to Detroit.|$|E

December 15, 1991) {{were born}} and raised in the San Fernando Valley, California, to a Jewish family. [...] Their Israeli-born father Mordechai ("Moti") and their mother Donna were both musical; though he had been a {{professional}} soccer player in Israel, Moti also played drums, while Donna won a contest on The Gong Show in the 1970s singing a Bonnie Raitt song. While Danielle showed an aptitude for the guitar at a young age, Moti made the decision that Este would be more suited to the bass, buying her a second hand Fender for $50. The siblings were encouraged <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> parents' 1970s classic rock and Americana records and, during their childhood, the family formed a band called Rockinhaim to play cover versions at local charity fairs, with Moti on drums and Donna on guitar. The group played typical wedding band material, including the Beatles' [...] "Get Back", Billy Joel's [...] "You May Be Right" [...] and Van Morrison's [...] "Brown Eyed Girl", but only did free community and benefit gigs at churches, schools and hospitals.|$|E
500|$|The group parted with Heart Management in March 1995 {{because of}} their {{frustration}} with the management company's unwillingness <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> visions and ideas. The girls met with artist manager Simon Fuller, who signed them with 19 Entertainment. The group considered a variety of record labels, and signed a deal with Virgin Records in July. The original mix of [...] "Wannabe" [...] was considered lacklustre by the label's executives. Ashley Newton, {{who was in charge}} of A, sent the song to American producer Dave Way for remixing; the result was not what the group had hoped to achieve. As Halliwell later described it, [...] "the result was bloody awful." [...] She elaborated in her second autobiography, Just for the Record: [...] "Right at the beginning of the Spice Girls, [...] Ashley Newton had tried to turn us into an R group. He sent [...] "Wannabe" [...] over to America to be remixed by some hot R producers. He brought us jungle versions and hip-hop mixes and I hated them all. Although Mel B was a big fan of R, she agreed with me that these versions just didn't work so we exercised our Spice veto!" [...] Fuller gave the song to audio engineer Mark [...] "Spike" [...] Stent, who thought that it was a [...] "weird pop record." [...] Stent remixed it in six hours, in what he described as [...] "tightening it up" [...] and [...] "getting the vocals sounding really good." ...|$|E
