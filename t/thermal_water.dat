40|$|Portugal {{is one of}} Europe's richest {{countries}} in <b>thermal</b> <b>waters</b> [1], {{and the majority of}} Portuguese thermal resorts are distributed by northern and central regions. The thermalism comprises the use of natural mineral water and other complementary means for prevention, treatment, rehabilitation or wellness [2]. The use of such water, also known as mineral-medicinal water, for therapeutic purposes has always been aroused a continuous interest in carrying out the characterization of this type of waters and the establishment of an eventual relationship for the treatment of a specific pathological condition. <b>Thermal</b> <b>waters</b> can be defined by waters from the subsoil, which are generated in specific geologic conditions and presenting "physico-chemical dynamism" [3, 4]. <b>Thermal</b> mineral <b>water</b> has three fundamental characteristics: it originates naturally from the earth, it is bacteriologically pure and has therapeutic potential [3, 4]. Most <b>thermal</b> <b>waters</b> are originated from the water resulting from precipitation, and with its infiltration in depth, they acquire particular physico-chemical characteristics, depending on the mineralogical composition of the geological formations through the water flows [1]. In fact, the geological variability in Portugal enables the occurrence of <b>thermal</b> <b>waters</b> with a high diversity in terms of physico-chemical composition [4]. <b>Thermal</b> <b>waters</b> are classified according to parameters such as temperature, osmotic pressure, radioactivity, chemical composition and mineralisation, being the latter two considered of greater importance [5]. The various therapeutic effects described with thermal therapy have been attributed to its physico-chemical composition, being classified as bicarbonated, sulfated, chlorided, sulphurous, hiposaline and gasocarbonic waters, and this correlation has been the basis for the indication of the different thermal resorts for different disorders of several vital systems of the body, and it is precisely in this context that the existing data are more controversial. From a simplistic and reductionist point of view, most Portuguese <b>thermal</b> <b>waters</b> are described as weakly mineralized, sulphurous, bicarbonated or chlorinated and sodium type waters. In the present work, a literature review was undertaken in order to create an index of information of physico-chemical composition of <b>thermal</b> <b>waters</b> of the Beira Interior region and its therapeutic indications, followed by an exhaustive statistical analysis to assess the correlation between the different physico-chemical parameters and the therapeutic indications described for that <b>thermal</b> <b>waters.</b> The results obtained allow us to demonstrate the role of the major components of the <b>thermal</b> <b>waters</b> to a particular therapeutic effect and hence to create a useful tool for regional typology of the <b>thermal</b> <b>waters</b> in Portugal as a valuable alternative of the therapeutic armamentarium for well and specific-oriented pathological disturbs...|$|R
25|$|Heat in a {{solar thermal}} system {{is guided by}} five basic principles: heat gain; heat transfer; heat storage; heat transport; and heat insulation. Here, heat is {{the measure of the}} amount of thermal energy an object {{contains}} and is determined by the temperature, mass and specific heat of the object. Solar thermal power plants use heat exchangers that are designed for constant working conditions, to provide heat exchange. Copper heat exchangers are important in solar thermal heating and cooling systems because of copper’s high thermal conductivity, resistance to atmospheric and water corrosion, sealing and joining by soldering, and mechanical strength.

25|$|To {{the south}} of the presumed forum site, between the Rue du Théâtre and Rue Vernoux the ruins of the thermae were discovered. This <b>thermal</b> <b>water</b> supply, and more {{generally}} that of the city of Valentia, was thanks to the numerous springs in the vicinity. The site of Valence still presents a dense network of streams and canals born of the overflow of water which escapes in sources {{at the foot of the}} terraces, forming, in the east, a curved line from the source of the Treuil up to the Fountain of Malcontents, and near the Rhône and the lower town, a quasi-parallel line to the river from the Saint-Pierre source until the descent of the Boulevard Gambetta. Thus, the Chony quarter (in the current commune of Bourg-lès-Valence), were found remains of pipes that belonged to the aqueduct that brought water from the source of the Treuil to Valence.|$|E
25|$|Light debris {{outside of}} Iapetus's orbit, either knocked {{free from the}} surface of a moon by micrometeoroid impacts or created in a collision, would spiral in as its orbit decays. It would have been darkened by {{exposure}} to sunlight. A portion of any such material that crossed Iapetus's orbit would have been swept up by its leading hemisphere, coating it; once this process created a modest contrast in albedo, and so a contrast in temperature, the thermal feedback described above would have come into play and exaggerated the contrast. In support of the hypothesis, simple numerical models of the exogenic deposition and <b>thermal</b> <b>water</b> redistribution processes can closely predict the two-toned appearance of Iapetus. A subtle color dichotomy between Iapetus's leading and trailing hemispheres, with the former being more reddish, can in fact be observed in comparisons between both bright and dark areas of the two hemispheres. In contrast to the elliptical shape of Cassini Regio, the color contrast closely follows the hemisphere boundaries; the gradation between the differently colored regions is gradual, on a scale of hundreds of km. The next moon inward from Iapetus, chaotically rotating Hyperion, also has an unusual reddish color.|$|E
