On <b>the</b> other hand, plasma fom <b>the</b> less <b>affected</b> patient improves <b>the</b> lymphoblastic response of <b>the</b> most <b>affected</b> one (although not significantly).

We then examine the robustness of <b>the</b> <b>affect</b> phenomena across a number of previously unexplored dimensions. These latter tests can be subdivided into two types.

Further to this, <b>the</b> <b>affect</b> heuristic itself could be considered as a specific sub-type of spontaneous process that is driven by implicit attitudes. We propose that each of the implicit attitude and affect heuristic constructs could be further developed through the examination and comparison of existing literatures surrounding the other.
