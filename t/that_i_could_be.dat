25|$|In August 2017, he {{was asked}} whether he might have {{acquired}} Greek citizenship through his mother, born in Greece, and British or Cypriot nationality through his father, an ethnic Greek {{who was born in}} Cyprus when it was a British colony and who possessed a British passport. He stated: “I’ve never had, never sought, never received citizenship of another country but out of an abundance of caution I wrote to the Greek embassy and Cypriot high commission saying essentially, ‘I’ve never been a citizen, I don’t want to be, so if there’s any question <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>be,</b> I renounce any rights to be’. I don’t know what else I can do in the circumstances.” He added that he had not received replies to these enquiries. Later he said he had renounced Greek citizenship but, on finding he might be British, he had sought clarification from British authorities. On 19 August, he announced that British authorities had confirmed he is a British Overseas citizen, a lesser form of British nationality. He stated that he would not resign from the Parliament, but would await a High Court decision. Together with that of Nash, Xenophon's case was referred to the Court on 4 September.|$|E

500|$|DJ Diplo {{introduced}} {{elements of}} Brazilian baile funk to [...] "Bucky Done Gun". Fellow composer-producer Richard X {{worked on the}} track [...] "Hombre", which featured a drum pattern created from the sounds made by toys that M.I.A. had bought in India, augmented with sounds produced by objects such as pens and mobile phones. Steve Mackey and Ross Orton, known professionally as Cavemen, worked on [...] "Galang", which M.I.A. had initially produced with her 505 and a basic four-track tape recorder. Working with Cavemen in a professional studio, she added a bass line and new vocals to give the song [...] "a more analogue sound" [...] than was possible with the 505. The track was co-written by Frischmann, whose input M.I.A. described as [...] "refreshing". She initially hoped to feature guest vocalists on the album, but was unable due to budget constraints and other artists' unfamiliarity with her work. She chose to perform all the vocals herself, saying, [...] "I just quietly got on with it... I didn't wanna convince anyone it was good.

2500|$|At sixteen, then {{living on}} her own, Streisand's youth and {{ambition}} worked in her favor, but she lacked a mature woman's physical features which were needed for serious female roles. She therefore took various menial jobs {{to have some}} income. At one period, she lacked a permanent address, and found herself sleeping {{at the home of}} friends or anywhere else she could set up the army cot she carried around to save on rent expense. When desperate, she would return to her mother's flat in Brooklyn for a home-cooked meal. However, her mother would be horrified by her daughter's [...] "gypsy-like lifestyle," [...] wrote biographer Karen Swenson, and again begged her to give up trying to get into show business; but Streisand took her mother's pleadings as even more reason to keep trying: [...] "My desires were strengthened by wanting to prove to my mother <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> a star." ...|$|E
2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1979, Frith {{relocated}} to New York City, where he immediately hooked up with the local avant-garde/downtown music scene. The impact on him was uplifting: [...] "...New York was a profoundly liberating experience for me; {{for the first time}} I felt <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> myself and not try to live up to what I imagined people were thinking about me." [...] Frith met and began recording with a number of musicians and groups, including Henry Kaiser, Bob Ostertag, Bryan Medwed, Tom Cora, Eugene Chadbourne, Zeena Parkins, Ikue Mori, the Residents, Material, the Golden Palominos, and Curlew. He spent some 14 years in New York, during which time he joined a few bands, including John Zorn's Naked City (in which Frith played bass) and French Frith Kaiser Thompson (consisting of John French, Frith, Henry Kaiser and Richard Thompson). Frith also started three bands himself, namely Massacre, Skeleton Crew, and Keep the Dog.|$|E

[...] He began {{fulfilling}} his wish while a high school freshman in Spring Run, playing as a substitute church organist at his father's church when the regular organist became ill for a month. He studied at Westminster College, Pennsylvania and at the American Conservatory of Music in Chicago where he earned two Master of Music degrees : [...] organ and church music in 1965 and music theory in 1969. Walker then earned a Doctor of Musical Arts degree from Stanford University in 1972. His teachers, Raymond Ocock and Robert Lodine, [...] "molded and nurtured" [...] his career, wrote Walker. Herbert Nanney, Professor of Music at Stanford, also had a dominant role in Walker's professional growth.|$|E

2500|$|Camping did not {{consider}} Family Radio a church and did not claim ordained or hierarchical authority within a church or institution. Camping claimed that the church institutions do not employ the Bible alone as the sole authority. According to Camping, each church or denomination has its own unique set of doctrines and hermeneutics, which dictate how they understand the Bible. Family Radio's sole focus on the Bible is what he believed distinguishes it from mainstream churches. In his book 1994?, he claimed {{there was a very}} high likelihood that the world would end in September 1994, although he did acknowledge in the book [...] "the possibility does exist <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> wrong"; Family Radio remained popular despite this failed prediction. Both before and after the failure of his 2011 prophecies, Camping received criticism from a number of leaders, scholars, and laymen within the Christian community, who argued that Jesus Christ taught that no man knows the day or the hour of the Lord's return. Camping responded to those who labelled him a [...] "date-setter", following his own method of Biblical interpretation, by asserting that he followed the Bible's method of interpretation.|$|E
2500|$|He {{resigned}} from the advertising industry in 1964, moved into a modest apartment near the Queens-Midtown Tunnel ("It wasn’t Paris in the 1920s, but I was happy" [...] DeLillo has said of this time), and began work on his first novel. Reflecting on {{the early days of}} his writing career, he remarked: [...] "I lived in a very minimal kind of way. My telephone would be $4.20 every month. I was paying a rent of sixty dollars a month. And I was becoming a writer. So in one sense, I was ignoring the movements of the time." [...] His first novel, Americana, was written over the course of four years and finally published in 1971, to modest critical praise. Americana concerned [...] "a television network programmer who hits the road in search of the big picture". DeLillo revised the novel in 1989 for paperback re-printing. Reflecting on the novel later in his career, he admitted, [...] "I don't think my first novel would have been published today as I submitted it. I don't think an editor would have read 50 pages of it. It was very overdone and shaggy, but two young editors saw something that seemed worth pursuing and eventually we all did some work on the book and it was published." [...] Later still, DeLillo still felt a degree of surprise at Americana being published, noting [...] "I was working on my first novel, Americana, for two years before I ever realized <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> a writer [...] I had absolutely no assurance that this book would be published because I knew that there were elements that I simply didn't know how to improve at that point. So I wrote for another two years and finished the novel. It wasn’t all that difficult to find a publisher, to my astonishment. I didn't have a representative. I didn’t know anything about publishing. But an editor at Houghton Mifflin read the manuscript and decided that this was worth pursuing." ...|$|E
