5000|$|It is {{possible}} that diamonds exist on Saturn and Jupiter {{on the basis of}} a different prior theory by Reginald B. Little. In 2000-03, Little previously proposed (2000) and demonstrated (2003). that a strong magnetic field can organize diamonds at lower temperatures and pressures relative to the higher pressure and temperatures formations from amorphous carbon and/or graphite. In 2005, Little realized that lightning could also provide such a magnetic field to directly transform graphite and elemental carbon to diamond and Reginald Little experimentally observed Nanodiamonds form from terrestrial lightning bolts upon solid carbon in 2009. Therefore, on the basis of his prior work, Reginald Little reasoned in 2013 that diamond particles can form and exist in the lightning storms and clouds on Saturn and Jupiter but by the direct cloud transformation of carbon to small diamond particles by lightning strikes in such clouds. As Baines and Delitsky report here in 2013, the lightning striking methane generates elemental carbon in clouds on Saturn and Jupiter, but Little asserts that the diamonds form not from the carbon sinking into the core of these planets but by subsequent lightning strikes on the generated carbon in the clouds. Therefore, Little suggests that the lightning directly transforms the elemental carbon to small diamond particles in the clouds with such diamonds in the clouds sticking together and falling as diamond hail. As the diamond hail falls it is chemically etched by the hydrogen in these planets under higher pressure and temperatures to reform methane gas. The resulting methane gas rises back to reform clouds to create a cycle of hydrogen-methane cloud forming diamond hail at higher elevations (by lightning) and the resulting diamond hail reforming hydrogen methane as it (the diamond) falls to lower elevations by temperatures for a diamond-hydrogen to methane cycle on these planets of similarity and analog to water-steam-ice cycle in thunderstorms on Earth. Such a cycle is important on these planets of Saturn and Jupiter to explain the prevailing presence of methane in their atmospheres. If the methane as by Baines and Delitsky is irreversibly converted to elemental carbon and to graphite at lower elevation and irreversibly to diamond at even lower elevations in Saturn and Jupiter then the atmospheres would be completely stripped of methane which is inconsistent with the persisting hydrogen, methane ammonia clouds of these planets. But unlike Baines and Delitsky prior theory of diamond forming toward the interior of these planets as the carbon falls (2013), Reginald Little asserts that the diamond forms in the clouds directly from frequent lightning striking the elemental carbon in the clouds. Reginald Little in 2005 also proposed that lightning striking Kimberlites on earth may explain diamond in certain Kimberlitic rocks relative to non producing Kimberlitic rock on Earth. Reginald Little correlated the most producing Kimberlitic rock with regions on the Earth with the highest yearly frequency cloud to ground lightning central to southern Africa. Prior to the birth of science, over thousands of years ago some ancient people in India believed that diamonds form by lightning striking rock but this belief was non scientific as there was no elemental basis for diamond and they believed granite would form diamond as well as slates, phyllites, mylonite, jade, marble, soapstone, and serpentine. The true theory and prediction came with Reginald Little in 2000. As only Carbonaceous rock perhaps with some iron only form diamond when struck by lightning. Extending this theory to other planets of Saturn and Jupiter as inspired by Baines and Delitsky, rather naturally and beautifully reasons direct transformation of elemental carbon to diamond by lightning at high elevation in the clouds of Saturn and Jupiter is not subject to thermodynamics of chemically etching of diamond and mixing in the interior of the planets. As at higher elevations in the clouds of these planets the temperature is very low so such thermodynamic mixing is infeasible but the <b>thermal</b> <b>quenching</b> of the lightning transformed diamond is feasible. This model and mechanism of Reginald Little is also not subject to the low methane concentration argument. as the carbon is concentrated in from initial low methane concentrations by prior lightning strikes. So very frequent lightning strikes and severe lightning storms in these planets tend to support. Reginald Little diamond cloud theory in Saturn and Jupiter.! ...|$|E

Disruptions on the Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak (MAST) are characterised {{in terms of}} <b>thermal</b> <b>quench</b> timescales, energy balance and pre disruption energy loss.

This mechanism was able to explain what a traditional model failed to explain. Usually, in traditional model used to explain “normal” quenching, the slope of PL quenching in the Arrhenius plot determines the ionization energy of the defect causing the PL band. However, in abrupt quenching when the intensity of PL decreases by several orders of magnitude within a small range of temperature, the slope in the Arrhenius plot has no relation to the ionization energy of any defect. It is not known a priori if the <b>thermal</b> <b>quenching</b> of a particular PL band is normal or abrupt and tunable.

40|$|As {{a result}} of the ITER design review {{activities}} the specifications for power and particle fluxes onto plasma facing components (PFCs) have been revisited. The revised specifications for steady-state fluxes are based on 2 -D/ 3 -D SOL modelling code predictions with input from experiments in tokamaks, as well as on simple models and empirical extrapolations and they are provided for all phases of the discharges and scenarios in ITER. In particular, it has been identified that power fluxes along the field can be present for field lines in the far-SOL of ITER (more than 4 - 6 cm from the separatrix at the outer midplane) with parallel power flux densities of ∼ 5 MWm- 2. Evaluation of the expected characteristics of power fluxes to the divertor during ELMs in ITER and experimental measurements of plasma material erosion under such loads has shown that an acceptable divertor target lifetime can only be ensured for ELMs causing an energy loss of ∼ 1 MJ or less. This is a factor of 20 smaller than that expected under uncontrolled ELMs and has determined the new requirements for ELM control in ITER. The expected range of energy and power fluxes on main chambers plasma facing components for controlled and uncontrolled ELMs in ITER is described on the basis of present models and empirical scaling of experimental data from various divertor tokamaks. Analysis of the energy outflow from the plasma to PFCs during the <b>thermal</b> <b>quench</b> of disruptions has shown that there is a significant degradation of plasma confinement for resistive-MHD disruptions expected in ITER scenario 2 at full performance.

In this second case, and that of VDEs, the plasma thermal energy remains close to its maximum value up to the <b>thermal</b> <b>quench.</b> As a consequence of this and the large broadening of the edge power flux profile at the <b>thermal</b> <b>quench,</b> the parallel energy flux during disruptions (mapped to the midplane) is expected to be in the range of 50 - 200 MJm- 2 for scenario 2 and 200 - 400 MJm- 2 for scenario 4. The specifications of the energy flux during VDEs for ITER have been refined on the basis of analysis of new experimental data that take into account the details of the plasma energy outflow up to the <b>thermal</b> <b>quench</b> of VDE...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the spontaneous generation of crystallized topological defects via the combining effects of fast rotation and rapid <b>thermal</b> <b>quench</b> on the spin- 1 Bose-Einstein condensates. By solving the stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation, we show that, {{when the system}} reaches equilibrium, a hexagonal lattice of skyrmions, and a square lattice of half-quantized vortices can be formed in a ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic spinor BEC, respetively, which can be imaged by using the polarization-dependent phase-contrast method...|$|R
40|$|Three {{dimensional}} MHD {{simulations of}} high-{beta} plasmas show that toroidally localized high-n ballooning modes can be driven unstable {{by the local}} pressure steepening which arises from the evolution of low-n modes. Nonlinearly, the high-n mode becomes even more localized and produces a strong local pressure bulge which destroys the flux surfaces resulting in a <b>thermal</b> <b>quench.</b> The flux surfaces then recover temporarily but now contain large magnetic islands. This scenario is supported by experimental data...|$|R
