5|$|Back at the dance, Harry's {{group are}} outside {{and take the}} {{assumption}} {{that they have been}} abandoned by Harry because he has not showed up. In actuality, Harry is hiding at the wall near them and <b>takes</b> <b>another</b> drink of the vial of formula before walking off. Soon after, Peter returns to find the dance almost abandoned except for Mary Jane, who is dancing with another boy. Downtrodden, he is reassured when Mary Jane walks up to him and tells him that she saved the last dance for him.|$|E
5|$|The female incubates for 12–14 {{days before}} the altricial chicks are hatched naked and blind. Fledging <b>takes</b> <b>another</b> 10–19 (average 13.6) days, with both parents feeding the young and {{removing}} faecal sacs. The nest is often ill-concealed {{compared with those of}} other species, and many breeding attempts fail due to predation. The young are fed by the parents for up to three weeks after leaving the nest, and will follow the adults begging for food. If the female starts another nest, the male alone will feed the fledged young. Second broods are common, with the female reusing the same nest if the brood was successful, and three broods may be raised in the south of the common blackbird's range.|$|E
5|$|The {{fragmentary notes}} for the {{remainder}} of the novel indicate two different trajectories for the plot and five separate conclusions. In both major plot arcs, George Venables wins a lawsuit against Darnford for seducing his wife; Darnford then abandons Maria, flees England, and <b>takes</b> <b>another</b> mistress. When she discovers this treachery, Maria loses the child she was carrying by Darnford (either through an abortion or a miscarriage). In one ending, Maria commits suicide. In another, more complete ending, Maria is saved from suicide by Jemima who has found her first daughter. Maria agrees to live for her child (as Wollstonecraft herself had done after her second suicide attempt). Jemima, Maria and Maria's daughter form a new family.|$|E

5|$|Rachel crashes her {{car into}} Adam's on a {{supermarket}} car park. After a brief argument Adam suggests they exchange phone numbers, under the pretence {{that it is}} for insurance purposes. She writes hers on his rear windscreen but rain washes it off. Prompted by Pete, Adam spends {{a day on the}} supermarket car park, in the hope that he and Rachel will cross paths, but they do not meet. At a dinner party held by Karen and David, Karen suggests Rachel get out more and advises her to call Adam. They go on a date but Adam is disappointed that Rachel does not want sex. Eventually, he suggests they see a play, which happens to be on at a theatre near his house. The play is dismal but Rachel decides it is time they slept together. Jenny <b>takes</b> <b>another</b> pregnancy test, but it is negative. Adam arrives and recounts his dates with Rachel to her and Pete, telling them he loves Rachel.|$|E
5|$|This martin {{builds a}} deep bowl nest on a {{sheltered}} horizontal surface, or a neat quarter-sphere against a vertical rock face or wall. The nest is constructed with mud pellets and lined with grass or feathers, {{and may be}} built on natural sites under cliff overhangs or on man-made structures such as buildings and bridges. It is often reused for subsequent broods or in later years. This species is often a solitary breeder, but small groups may breed close together in suitable locations. The two or three eggs of a typical clutch are white with brown and grey blotches, and are incubated by both adults for 16–19 days prior to hatching. Both parents then feed the chicks. Fledging <b>takes</b> <b>another</b> 22–24 days, although the young birds {{will return to the}} nest to roost for {{a few days after the}} first flight.|$|E
5|$|Julie Loeb (Isabella Grace) {{is found}} shot dead during a hunting {{expedition}} in the woods. Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) and Peter Dunlop (Nicholas Bishop), begin to examine Julie. Megan notices a scratch on Julie's husband Martin (Jay Karnes) beginning to suspect he is her killer. After interviewing Martin, her step children Thomas (Joey Adams) and Erika (Natalie Floyd), their financial manager Alan Wright (Alex Fernandez), and Martin's ex-wife Alexandra (Jessica Tuck), she accuses Martin of the murder. Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan) tells Megan that Martin has phoned the mayor, {{and made a}} complaint about Megan's behaviour who accused him of Julie's death. Megan is taken off the case, but gets Ethan Gross (Geoffrey Arend) to test a tissue found on the scene. Kate defends her actions to Peter, stating {{that she did not}} take her off the case due to her grudge with Megan, as she is dating Megan's ex-husband Todd Fleming (Jeffrey Nordling). Meanwhile, Curtis Brumfield (Windell Middlebrooks) interviews people to become a driver; a person who carries the bodies from the crime scene to the autopsy, and is ultimately unsuccessful. Bud Morris (John Carroll Lynch) and Samantha Baker (Sonja Sohn) interview Martin once again, but are interrupted by Megan, who gets back the results from the scratch, once again accusing Martin of fighting with Julie, which he denies, as his blood matched some which was on her fingernail. Kate issues a final warning to Megan, so Megan <b>takes</b> <b>another</b> case. Bud and Samantha interview Alan, and find out that Julie was pregnant when she was shot.|$|E

5|$|Like other fairywrens, {{the superb}} fairywren is notable for its marked sexual dimorphism, males {{adopting}} a highly visible breeding plumage of brilliant iridescent blue contrasting {{with black and}} grey-brown. The brightly coloured crown and ear tufts are prominently featured in breeding displays. The breeding male has a bright-blue forehead, ear coverts, mantle and tail, brown wings, and black throat, eye band, breast and bill. Females, immatures, and non-breeding males are a plain fawn colour with a lighter underbelly and a fawn (females and immatures) or dull greyish blue (males) tail. The bill is brown in females and juveniles and black in males after their first winter. Immature males moult into breeding plumage the first breeding season after hatching, though incomplete moulting sometimes leaves residual brownish plumage that <b>takes</b> <b>another</b> year or two to perfect. Both sexes moult in autumn after breeding, with males assuming an eclipse non-breeding plumage. They moult again into nuptial plumage in winter or spring. Breeding males' blue plumage, particularly the ear-coverts, is highly iridescent because of the flattened and twisted surface of the barbules. The blue plumage also reflects ultraviolet light strongly, and so {{may be even more}} prominent to other fairywrens, whose colour vision extends into this part of the spectrum.|$|E

25|$|The total {{synthesis}} of napelline (Scheme a) begins with aldehyde 100. In a 7 step process, the A-ring of napelline is formed (104). It <b>takes</b> <b>another</b> 10 steps {{to form the}} lactone ring in the pentacyclic structure of napelline (106). An additional 9 steps creates the enone-aldehyde 107. Heating in methanol with potassium hydroxide causes an aldol condensation to close the sixth and final ring in napelline (14). Oxidation then gives rise to diketone 108 which was converted to (±)-napelline (14) in 10 steps.|$|E

25|$|Haemaphysalis leporispalustris has a {{complete}} lifecycle where it completes {{the stages of}} egg, larva, nymph, and adult. After emerging from the egg, the rabbit tick finds a host and takes a blood meal during each life stage. Once the tick feeds, it drops to the ground to molt and then climbs back on its host and <b>takes</b> <b>another</b> meal. The rabbit tick may change hosts throughout this process, especially if the host is not a hare or rabbit. This life cycle can {{take as long as}} a year, especially in climates that are cold. The population of H. leporispalustris peaks during the summer and declines during the winter. Development of the rabbit ticks often occur at quicker rates at higher temperatures than in colder temperatures.|$|E
25|$|However, Alexander Grosart {{denies that}} Henry Vaughan was solely an imitator of Herbert. There are moments {{in when the}} reader can {{identify}} Vaughan's true self, rather than an imitation of Herbert. In such passages Vaughan is seen to demonstrate naturalness, immediacy and ability to relate the concrete through poetry. In some instances, Vaughan derives observations from Herbert's language that are distinctly his own. It is as if Vaughan takes proprietorship of some of Herbert's work, yet makes it completely unique to himself. Vaughan <b>takes</b> <b>another</b> step away from Herbert in his manner of presenting his poetry. Herbert in The Temple, which is most often the source of comparison between the two writers, lays down explicit instructions on its reading. This contrasts with the attitude of Vaughan, who saw the experience of reading as the best guide to his meanings and promoted no special reading method.|$|E
25|$|However, {{they do not}} {{strictly}} follow history. The first six books quickly move through twelve years of the Napoleonic Wars, as established by frequent reference to historical events, with The Fortune of War ending on 1 June 1813 with the battle between HMS Shannon and USS Chesapeake. Yet the series then enters a kind of fantasy-time in which it <b>takes</b> <b>another</b> dozen novels to progress to November 1813. Much of this period is spent at sea, {{with little or no}} connection to real-world years, and the events of the novels take up substantially more time than the few months 'available'. External historical reference returns with The Yellow Admiral, the 18th book in the series. Towards the beginning of this novel, it is stated that the British army under the Duke of Wellington has entered France from Spain, which occurred in November 1813. Time is then paused again for a few chapters, as a narrative apparently lasting several months ensues before a specific arrival at Christmas 1813. Thereafter, the book and the next in the series (The Hundred Days) move swiftly through the historical events of Napoleon's disastrous invasion of Russia and his defeat in the War of the Sixth Coalition, his exile and escape from Elba, and his final campaign and defeat in June 1815. The last completed book in the series, Blue at the Mizzen, is the only volume which is set entirely after the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars.|$|E
