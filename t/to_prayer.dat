5|$|At Kanshi Ram's funeral ceremonies in 2006, Mayawati {{stated that}} both Kanshi Ram and herself had been, {{and she would}} {{continue}} to be, observant of Buddhist traditions and customs. She has stated her intention to formally convert to Buddhism when the political conditions enable her to become Prime Minister of India. Her act of performing the last rites (traditionally done by a male heir) was an expression of their views against gender discrimination. When she was Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, she publicly called Bhikkhus <b>to</b> <b>prayer.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{author of}} the Rule of Saint Benedict, which was the {{principal}} monastic code in Western Europe in the early Middle Ages, was Saint Benedict of Nursia (c. 480–550). Under this rule {{the lives of the}} monks were mainly devoted <b>to</b> <b>prayer,</b> together with reading sacred texts and manual work. They lived a communal life and were required to give complete obedience to their abbot. Benedict's achievement was to produce a stable system characterised by moderation and prudence.|$|E
5|$|From October 1928 onward, Mufti Amin al-Husayni {{organised}} {{a series}} of measures to demonstrate the Arabs' exclusive claims to the Temple Mount and its environs. He ordered new construction next to and above the Western Wall. The British granted the Arabs permission to convert a building adjoining the Wall into a mosque and to add a minaret. A muezzin was appointed to perform the Islamic call <b>to</b> <b>prayer</b> and Sufi rites directly next to the Wall. These were seen as a provocation by the Jews who prayed at the Wall. The Jews protested and tensions increased.|$|E

5|$|Miller {{was born}} on February 3, 1920, in Charleston, West Virginia, {{the son of an}} {{executive}} at a steel company, George E. Miller, and Florence (Armitage) Miller. Soon after, his parents divorced. He grew up with only his mother during the Great Depression, attended public school, and graduated from Charleston High School in 1937. He relocated with his mother and stepfather to Washington D.C., and was at George Washington University for a year. His family practiced Christian Science, which required turning <b>to</b> <b>prayer,</b> rather than medical science, for healing. After his stepfather was transferred to Birmingham, Alabama, Miller transferred to the University of Alabama.|$|E
5|$|Symeon {{was born}} into the Byzantine nobility and given a {{traditional}} education. At age fourteen he met Symeon the Studite, a renowned monk of the Monastery of Stoudios in Constantinople, who convinced him to give his own life <b>to</b> <b>prayer</b> and asceticism under the elder Symeon's guidance. By {{the time he was}} thirty, Symeon the New Theologian became the abbot of the Monastery of St. Mammas, a position he held for twenty-five years. He attracted many monks and clergy with his reputation for sanctity, though his teachings brought him into conflict with church authorities, who would eventually send him into exile. His most well known disciple was Nicetas Stethatos who wrote the Life of Symeon.|$|E

5|$|The mosques at Gedi {{contained}} {{wells and}} washing facilities, {{which would have}} been used for cleansing prior to worship. However, they were not constructed with minarets used for the call <b>to</b> <b>prayer,</b> which was more characteristic in other regions. Gedi's mosques were typically laid out with anterooms flanking the central room, which had a roof supported by wood beams resting on square stone pillars. The isles created by the pillars obstructed the view of the mihrab, which were situated on the north walls in the direction of Mecca.|$|E
5|$|Only a few {{towns in}} western Libya—such as Bani Walid, Sebha and Sirte—remained Gaddafist strongholds. Retreating to Sirte after Tripoli's fall, Gaddafi {{announced}} {{his willingness to}} negotiate for a handover to a transitional government, a suggestion rejected by the NTC. Surrounding himself with bodyguards, he continually moved residences to escape NTC shelling, devoting his days <b>to</b> <b>prayer</b> and reading the Qur'an. On 20 October, Gaddafi broke out of Sirte's District 2 in a joint civilian-military convoy, hoping to take refuge in the Jarref Valley. At around 8.30am, NATO bombers attacked, destroying at least 14 vehicles and killing at least 53. The convoy scattered, and Gaddafi and those closest to him fled to a nearby villa, which was shelled by rebel militia from Misrata. Fleeing to a construction site, Gaddafi and his inner cohort hid inside drainage pipes while his bodyguards battled the rebels; in the conflict, Gaddafi suffered head injuries from a grenade blast while defence minister Abu-Bakr Yunis Jabr was killed.|$|E
5|$|The King, {{weakened}} by illness, became progressively less {{active in the}} last years of his reign, devoting an increasing amount of time <b>to</b> <b>prayer,</b> as did his aging mother, who had returned from Poland in 1374. These circumstances allowed Elizabeth to assume a more prominent role at court. Her influence had grown steadily since she had given her husband heirs. It appeared probable that the crowns would pass to one of Elizabeth's underage daughters and by 1374, their rights were confirmed. Behind the scenes, Elizabeth began ensuring that the succession would be as smooth as possible by encouraging a slow but decisive change in the personnel of the government. Warlike and illiterate barons were gradually replaced by a small group of noblemen who excelled in their professional skills but were not distinguished by birth or military ability. Palatine Nicholas I Garai led the movement and enjoyed the full support of the Queen, and their power eventually became virtually unrestricted.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{main purpose}} of this study was to {{investigate}} the relationship between adherence <b>to</b> <b>prayers</b> and mental health among the students of Khorramabad Payame Noor University in Khoramabad. Materials and Methods: The method of the study was correlation analysis. The population of the study was all the students of Khorramabad Payame Noor university. The sample size comprised of 400 students, based on Morgantable, were selected using proportional stratification sampling method. Data gathering instruments were Panahi’s (2003) adherence <b>to</b> <b>prayers</b> questionnaire and Geldberg and Healer’s (1979) general health questionnaire (GHQ). The reliability of the questionnaire of adnerence <b>to</b> <b>prayers</b> was found <b>to</b> be 0. 906 and for the general health questionnaire was 0. 95. The descriptive statistics of frequency, percentage, percentile and Pearson’s correlation coefficient were used in this study. Results: The results showed that 68. 7 % had a very high, 26. 5 % had a high, 3. 8 % had a Mediocre, and only 1 % had a low or very low adherence <b>to</b> <b>prayers.</b> Based on the study results, 47. 5 % of the samples had no or little disorder in their mental health. 33. 3 % showed middle mental health disorder, 14. 5 % had a mediocre disorder in mental health, 4. 7 % showed severe mental health disorder. The results showed that there is a significant relationship between adherence <b>to</b> <b>prayers</b> and mental health in terms of general mental health as well as any other micro measures of mental health. Conclusion: Thus, according to this study by adopting suitable methods the mental health rate of students can be promoted. Adopting cultural programs to boost adherence <b>to</b> <b>prayers</b> in elementary school students can increase mental health in later years...|$|R
25|$|In January 2004, {{members of}} the Al-Islah Islamic Center {{requested}} permission to use loudspeakers {{for the purpose of}} broadcasting the Islamic call <b>to</b> <b>prayer.</b> This request set off a contentious debate in the city, about the noise that would be caused by the call <b>to</b> <b>prayer,</b> eventually garnering national attention.

50|$|By {{study of}} the prayers, it seems {{apparent}} to scholars, that these types of <b>prayers</b> seem <b>to</b> be reformations of earlier topos made, for example, {{in a similar vein}} <b>to</b> <b>prayers</b> such as the <b>Prayer</b> <b>to</b> the Gods of the Night.|$|R
25|$|From Biblical {{times to}} today, {{the most common}} form of prayer is to {{directly}} appeal to God to grant one's requests. This in many ways is the simplest form of prayer. Some have termed this the social approach <b>to</b> <b>prayer.</b> In this view, a person directly enters into God's rest, and asks for their needs to be fulfilled. God listens to the prayer, and may so or not choose to answer in the way one asks of him. This is the primary approach <b>to</b> <b>prayer</b> found in the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, most of the Church writings, and in rabbinic literature such as the Talmud.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>prayer</b> services, observant traditional Jews recite {{prayers and}} benedictions {{throughout the day}} when performing various acts.

25|$|In Yunnan province, {{during the}} Qing Dynasty, tablets that wished the Emperor {{a long life}} were placed at mosque entrances. No minarets were {{available}} and no chanting accompanied the call <b>to</b> <b>prayer.</b> The mosques were similar to Buddhist Temples, and incense was burned inside.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the five}} {{required}} daily prayers, a muezzin calls the worshippers <b>to</b> <b>prayer</b> from the minaret. In many countries like Singapore where Muslims {{are not the}} majority, mosques are prohibited from loudly broadcasting the call <b>to</b> <b>prayer</b> (adhan), although {{it is supposed to}} be said loudly to the surrounding community. The adhan is required before every prayer. However, nearly every mosque assigns a muezzin for each prayer to say the adhan as it is a recommended practice or sunnah of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. At mosques that do not have minarets, the adhan is called instead from inside the mosque or somewhere else on the ground. The iqama, which is similar to the adhan and said immediately before the start of prayer, is usually not said from the minaret even if a mosque has one.|$|E
25|$|Some outward {{acts that}} {{sometimes}} accompany prayer are: anointing with oil; ringing a bell; burning incense or paper; lighting a candle or candles; See, for example, facing a specific direction (i.e. towards Mecca or the East); making {{the sign of}} the cross. One less noticeable act related <b>to</b> <b>prayer</b> is fasting.|$|E
