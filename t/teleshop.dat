40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we present}} <b>TeleShop,</b> the teleassistance module of ShopMobile 2, our mobile {{accessible}} shopping system for visually impaired (VI) and blind individuals {{that we have}} been developing for the past several years. <b>TeleShop</b> enables its users to obtain help from remote sighted guides by transmitting images and voice from their smartphones to the guides ’ computers or phones. We have successfully tested <b>TeleShop</b> in a laboratory study in which a married couple (a blind husband and a sighted wife) used it to retrieve grocery products and read nutrition facts from product packages...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} employs {{structural equation}} modeling (SEM) techniques to explore the tradeoffs people make when engaging in teleshopping activities from home. Using the Bay Area Travel Survey (BATS) 2000 this dissertation performs an activities analysis to investigate these relationships. Time use variables are included that predict {{the amount of time}} each individual spends during the day on work, maintenance, discretionary, and shopping activities, both in and outside of the home. These activities are used to predict the amount of shopping travel each person undertook. Results suggest that people substitute home teleshopping time for shopping travel time, and teleshoppers take fewer shopping trips and travel shorter total distances for shopping purposes. However, these effects are mainly “indirect” and appear to be mediated through two time-use variables – In-Home Maintenance and In-Home Discretionary activities. Home teleshoppers tended to spend more time on In-Home Maintenance and less on In-Home Discretionary activities than non-home teleshoppers. Variables constructed to represent the degree to which people are “time-starved” from the demands of their work and maintenance activities revealed that female heads of households tend to home <b>teleshop</b> more, make more shopping trips and shopping trip chains, shop out-of-home more, and shop travel for longer periods {{than the rest of the}} survey population. A variable constructed to measure each survey participant household’s accessibility to shopping opportunities suggests that people who live in high retail accessibility areas tend to home <b>teleshop</b> slightly (but statistically significantly) more, take more shop trips, make more shop trip chains, and travel shorter total distances for shopping purposes than those who live in lower accessibility neighborhoods. These results suggest that home teleshopping is primarily used as a tool to restructure a person’s daily activities participation, which in turn, restructures a person’s shop travel behavior. The degree to which someone is time-starved – particularly, female head of households – appears to play a role in determining the propensity to home <b>teleshop</b> as does a person’s relative accessibility to retail opportunities. While confirmatory analysis is necessary, these results suggest that activity-based travel demand models would benefit from the inclusion of home teleshopping, time-starved, and retail accessibility variables...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to present}} an {{in-depth}} study of key drivers influencing <b>teleshopping</b> behaviour. For this purpose, we put forward a set of hypotheses regarding the influence of demographics, television media exposure, <b>teleshopping</b> genre exposure and attitude towards <b>teleshopping</b> in <b>teleshopping</b> decision. Data analysis of the results obtained from a sample of 200 Spanish teleshoppers shows that attitude towards <b>teleshopping</b> and <b>teleshopping</b> genre exposure are significative predictors of <b>teleshopping</b> behaviour...|$|R

Moreover it seems that the attractiveness of the regular shopping centre plays an important role...|$|R

40|$|<b>Teleshopping</b> {{has become}} {{central to the}} content of Maltese {{television}} in the last five years. This study tried to identify reasons behind the success of these programmes amongst this country’s television audience. It was hypothesised that the popularity of this genre must be related to the gratification of psychological needs besides their overt marketing function. Factor analysis of data collected from 150 participants indicated that viewers watch <b>teleshopping</b> programmes primarily because this activity provides the viewer with a sense of identification with a particular group of people. Specifically, these programmes instil the belief that buying the advertised products makes consumers more important and respected, enhancing their self-esteem and hope in a better future. <b>Teleshopping</b> allows viewers to identify with a higher social group than the one they belong to while providing relaxation and entertainment as well as escapism from life’s realities. The results of this study emphasize the primacy of the emerging virtual community. This genre seems to have partially replaced what the physical community used to offer in the provision of companionship, setting of norms and providing benchmarks for a comfortable lifestyle...|$|R
