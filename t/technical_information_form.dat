50|$|PRONOM's origins {{lie in a}} {{requirement}} {{to have access to}} reliable <b>technical</b> <b>information</b> about the electronic records held by The National Archives. By definition, electronic records are not inherently human-readable - file formats encode <b>information</b> into a <b>form</b> which can only be processed and rendered comprehensible by very specific technological environments. The accessibility of that information is therefore highly vulnerable to technological obsolescence. <b>Technical</b> <b>information</b> about the structure of those file formats, and the software and hardware environments required to support them, is therefore a prerequisite for any digital preservation regime. PRONOM was developed to provide this function, initially as an internal resource for National Archives staff, and subsequently as public, web-based resource.|$|R

40|$|Background: Since it {{was first}} defined in 1995, Public Health Informatics (PHI) has become a {{recognized}} discipline, with a research agenda, defined domain-specific competencies and a specialized corpus of <b>technical</b> knowledge. <b>Information</b> systems <b>form</b> a cornerstone of PHI research and implementation, representing significant progress for the nascent field. However, PHI does not advocate or incorporate standard, domain-appropriate design methods for implementing public health information systems. Reusable design is generalized design advice that can be reused {{in a range of}} similar contexts. We propose that PHI create and reuse information design knowledge by taking a systems approach that incorporates design methods from the disciplines of Human-Computer Interaction, Interaction Design and other related disciplines. Discussion: Although PHI operates in a domain with unique characteristics, many design problems in public health correspond to classic design problems, suggesting that existing design methods and solution approaches are applicable to the design of public health information systems. Among the numerous methodological frameworks used in other disciplines, we identify scenario-based design and participatory design as two widelyemployed methodologies that are appropriate for adoption as PHI standards. We make the case that these methods show promise to create reusable design knowledge in PHI...|$|R
