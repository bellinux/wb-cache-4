5|$|Hibs enjoyed {{great success}} in the period {{immediately}} {{after the end of}} the Second World War, winning three league championships between 1948 and 1952. The club's participation in the (inaugural) 1955–56 European Cup meant that Easter Road became the first British ground to host European Cup football. A record attendance of 65,860 was set by an Edinburgh derby against Hearts played on 2 January 1950. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> record for any football match played in Edinburgh. As the fans had been tightly packed on the terraces to achieve this record attendance, the size of the East Terrace was increased further. The club even drew up plans to expand the overall capacity to nearly 100,000. This would have been done by raising each end terrace to the same height as the east side, but these plans were never realised.|$|E
5|$|The BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year is {{an award}} {{presented}} at the annual BBC Sports Personality of the Year award ceremony. The award is presented to a non-British sportsperson considered to have made the most substantial contribution to a sport in that year.

In the case of a points tie, the sportsperson chosen as first preference by the most panellists is the winner. If <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> tie the award is shared.

5|$|There is {{no clear}} {{evidence}} that the classic Maya were aware of precession. Some Maya scholars, such as Barbara MacLeod, Michael Grofe, Eva Hunt, Gordon Brotherston, and Anthony Aveni, have suggested that some Mayan holy dates were timed to precessional cycles, but scholarly opinion on the subject remains divided. There is also little evidence, archaeological or historical, that the Maya placed any importance on solstices or equinoxes. It is possible that only the earliest among Mesoamericans observed solstices, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> disputed issue among Mayanists. There is also {{no evidence that the}} classic Maya attached any importance to the Milky Way; there is no glyph in their writing system to represent it, and no astronomical or chronological table tied to it.|$|E
