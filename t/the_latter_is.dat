5|$|American Cockers {{are also}} prone to canine {{epilepsy}} {{and the related}} condition known as Rage Syndrome. <b>The</b> <b>latter</b> <b>is</b> a form of epilepsy which can cause a normally placid dog to engage in sudden and unprovoked violent attacks.

5|$|Fauré {{revised and}} {{enlarged}} the Requiem {{in the years}} between its first performance in 1888 and {{the publication of the}} final version in 1901. <b>The</b> <b>latter</b> <b>is</b> scored for full orchestra; since the 1970s attempts have been made by several Fauré scholars to reconstruct the composer's earlier versions, scored for smaller orchestral forces.|$|E
5|$|Finally, two special transformations {{are used}} to invert the {{coordinate}} system in space, space inversion, and in time, time reversal. In the first case, the space coordinate axes are reversed. <b>The</b> <b>latter</b> <b>is</b> reversal of the time direction. This is thought of, in the passive view, as having the observer set their clock at minus what it shows and then have the clock's hands move counterclockwise. Physical time progresses forward.|$|E

5|$|For instance, the {{periodontal}} ligament {{can detect}} the pressure exerted when biting on something {{smaller than a}} grain of sand (10-30µm). When a tooth is intentionally stimulated, about 33% of people can correctly identify the tooth, and about 20% cannot narrow the stimulus location down {{to a group of}} three teeth. Another typical difference between pulpal and periodontal pain is that <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>is</b> not usually made worse by thermal stimuli.|$|E
5|$|For natural uranium, about 49% of its {{alpha rays}} are emitted {{by each of}} 238U atom, and also 49% by 234U (since <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>is</b> formed from the former) and about 2.0% of them by the 235U. When the Earth was young, {{probably}} about one-fifth of its uranium was uranium-235, but the percentage of 234U was probably much lower than this.|$|E
