5|$|A {{southbound}} {{passenger train}} and a pilot engine left Arthington station on 19 September 1854 heading for Leeds. A pilot engine had travelled northbound {{through the tunnel}} earlier the same day with no problems {{but this time the}} train ran into a pile of stone debris and was derailed when it was three-quarters of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> tunnel. The debris was from a roof fall that affected both tracks. The train engine collided with the pilot engine tender causing considerable damage.|$|E
5|$|This {{stage was}} {{extremely}} climbing-intensive, with three categorized high mountains, including a mountaintop {{finish with a}} very difficult gradient at Monte Petrano, and a smaller climb {{about a third of}} <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> stage. It also had five short uncategorized hills. Following the alterations to Stage 10, this was also called the queen stage of the Giro.|$|E
5|$|C'est trop bête d'en parler (It's {{too stupid}} to talk about). There was a break. Coppi {{attacked}}. His brother Fausto gave him a push to get him away. He wanted his brother to win. I waited a bit and then I attacked and I caught him and the break. Then I went off by myself. I {{was going to win}} Paris–Roubaix. At the entrance to the vélodrome, there were crowds everywhere, blocking the way. I looked around for where to go and I was directed round the outside wall of the track, to where the team cars had to park. It wasn't like nowadays, when there's television and everything. Then it was more chaotic and the whole road was blocked. People said I should have known <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> track. But how do you know a thing like {{that at the end of}} Paris–Roubaix, when you've raced all day over roads like that? A gendarme signalled the way to go and that's the way I went.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese attack did not {{delay the}} Australian {{assault on the}} Pocket. At 10 am on 21 June, C Company of the 2/28th Battalion began {{to advance to the}} west along Lushington Ridge, and D Company moved south from Eastman Spur. D Company was {{supported}} by a troop of three conventional Matilda tanks and two Frog flamethrowers. C Company advanced about half of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Pocket before being halted by Norman who was concerned that they might be accidentally attacked by D Company, which was also making good progress. The force built around D Company subsequently completed the occupation of the Pocket, with the flamethrower tanks playing a key role. The Japanese soldiers who had survived the artillery bombardment offered little resistance to the Australian forces. The 24th Brigade assessed that 60 Japanese personnel were killed in the final assault on the Pocket, with 117 being killed by the artillery bombardment which had preceded it.|$|E
5|$|US41/M-28 runs north {{along the}} Lake Superior shoreline, passing the Marquette Branch Prison and {{crossing}} the Carp River before cresting Shiras Hill on <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> city of Marquette, entering town on Front Street. South of downtown, the highway turns west on the Marquette Bypass, a four-lane expressway complete with two overpasses. The bypass moves traffic around the former routing of US41/M-28 along Front and Washington streets, a routing that was used for Business US41 (Bus. US41) until 2005. West of Washington Street, US41/M-28 follows a heavily trafficked business corridor. The 2006 average annual daily traffic (AADT, the yearly traffic count divided by 365) along this corridor ranged from 31,700 to 34,700vehicles. US41/M-28 climbs hilly terrain into the cities of Negaunee and Ishpeming, running west and slightly south. The two cities host Bus. M-28, which was once designated as ALTUS41 as well. Between the twin cities, US41/M-28 skirts the shores of Teal Lake in Negaunee and then narrows to two lanes west of Ishpeming.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech {{began its}} first full drive {{of the fourth}} quarter at its 41-yard line with 10:21 {{remaining}} in the game. Tech transitioned into a running strategy, maximizing {{the amount of time}} used off the game clock between each play. On the drive's first play, Stith was tackled for a one-yard loss. On its second play, Stith regained the lost yard. The third-down play was an incomplete pass by Clark, and the Hokies punted after going three and out. The kick rolled into the end zone for a touchback, and Alabama's offense began at its 20-yard line. Alexander was tackled for a two-yard loss, then Zow threw an interception to Anthony Midget, who returned the ball all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> end zone for a Virginia Tech defensive touchdown. The extra point was good, and Tech extended its lead to 387 with 7:33 remaining in the game.|$|E

5|$|With {{the area}} having a {{generally}} low density and lacking transit-oriented development, the Metrorail {{was designed as}} a park and ride system, with the idea being that suburban residents would drive to the stations, then commute the rest of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> city. Nearly all of the stations outside of downtown Miami have parking facilities, except Tri-Rail Station. Several have large parking garages, such as Dadeland North and South stations, located {{at the southern end of}} the system, which combined have space for over 3,000 cars. Earlington Heights, located just northwest of Downtown and adjacent to Interstate 95 and the Airport Expressway, has a large garage that was formerly dedicated to Metrorail riders. However, that is now used by the county due to the station's low ridership, with only 95 vehicle spaces currently available. The successful Dadeland garages are at or over capacity, with two of Metrorail's proposed extensions, the West Kendall Corridor and South Link, intended to help alleviate them. The two northernmost stations, which are located near the Palmetto Expressway, Palmetto and Okeechobee, appeal to Broward County commuters with nearly 2,000 combined spaces. Additionally, the proposed North Corridor to the Broward/Miami-Dade county line would have included five park and ride facilities totaling 2,650 spaces. In the late 1990s, the plan was to potentially even continue the Metrorail line into Broward County along 27th Avenue (University Drive), ending at Broward Boulevard near Broward Mall in Plantation.|$|E

The tube extends nearly all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> bottom bulb, and attaches to the top bulb but does not extend into it. The space inside the bird contains a fluid, usually colored. The fluid is typically dichloromethane, also known as methylene chloride. Earlier versions contained trichlorofluoromethane. Miles V. Sullivan's 1945 patent suggested ether, alcohol, carbon tetrachloride, or chloroform.|$|E
25|$|There, in May 1850, he {{once again}} took up Siegfried's Tod. He {{prepared}} a third fair {{copy of the}} libretto (Viertschrift des Textbuches) for publication, which, however, did not take place, and by July he had even begun to compose music for the prologue. Of this music a sheet of preliminary sketches survives and a more detailed composition draft, which extends about one quarter of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> duet between Brünnhilde and Siegfried. Having reached this point, however, Wagner abandoned the work.|$|E
25|$|As the pilots, who {{had entered}} Nordkapp during the patrol boat's signal {{exchange}} with Kattegat, {{reported that the}} tanker's thirty-nine man crew were all armed and wearing naval uniforms, Seip considered it impossible to board and seize the ship, since his own 22-man crew had a total of only four rifles amongst them. He assessed that to control the large German crew all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> port of Bodø while being outnumbered and probably out-gunned {{would have been too}} difficult.|$|E

The other ships would form a separate double column and pass on the port side of the monitors, so that the armored ships would shield their wooden sisters from the guns of the fort. When the Confederate fleet made its expected appearance, the monitors would move to attack the armored Tennessee, while the rest of the fleet would fight the faster gunboats.|$|E
25|$|The playoff round saw the top eight teams {{competing}} {{for the title of}} 2010 world champions. The quarter-finals began with a close match between Finland and the Czech Republic. After Petri Kontiola's early goal in the first minute, the game remained scoreless all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> third period. Jakub Klepiš scored the equalizer shortly after the final period started. No further goals were scored, so the game went into a scoreless overtime followed by a shootout. Jan Marek scored the decisive goal to put the Czechs into the semifinals.|$|E
25|$|Police {{officers}} Sergeant John Bassett and Detective Kenneth Evans were on board, as was Donald Turnbull, son of inventor Wallace Rupert Turnbull. Also killed was Charles Stone of Montreal, {{a former}} {{co-owner of the}} Canadian Football League's (CFL) Montreal Alouettes; his death occurred during the CFL's Grey Cup week in Vancouver. The casualty count could have been higher. Traffic congestion on Montreal's main expressway caused eight people to miss this flight. The traffic congestion, which extended all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> downtown core, also delayed emergency vehicles from getting to the crash-site.|$|E

25|$|In ancient times, the Kingdom of Punt, {{which is}} {{believed}} by several Egyptologists {{to have been}} situated {{in the area of}} modern-day Somalia, had a steady trade link with the Ancient Egyptians and exported precious natural resources such as myrrh, frankincense and gum. This trade network continued all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> classical era. The city states of Mossylon, Malao, Mundus and Tabae in Somalia engaged in a lucrative trade network connecting Somali merchants with Phoenicia, Ptolemic Egypt, Greece, Parthian Persia, Saba, Nabataea and the Roman Empire. Somali sailors used the ancient Somali maritime vessel known as the beden to transport their cargo.|$|E
25|$|An early {{problem for}} the escapees was that most were unable to find <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> railway station, until {{daylight}} revealed {{it was in a}} recess of the side wall to an underground pedestrian tunnel. Consequently, many of them missed their night time trains, and decided either to walk across country or wait on the platform in daylight. Another unanticipated problem was that this was the coldest March for thirty years, with snow up to five feet deep, so the escapees had no option but to leave the cover of woods and fields and stay on the roads.|$|E
25|$|When, in 1069, Malcolm Canmore and William the Conqueror held {{a conference}} {{regarding}} {{the claims of}} Edgar Atheling to the English Crown, they met at Abernithi – a term which in the old British tongue means a port {{at the mouth of}} the Nith. It has been argued, the town thus characterised must have been Dumfries; and therefore it must have existed as a port in the Kingdom of Strathclyde, if not in the Roman days. However, against this argument is that the town is situated eight to nine miles (14km) distant from the sea, although the River Nith is tidal and navigable all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> town itself.|$|E
