50|$|In {{pharmaceutical}} research <b>toxicogenomics</b> {{is defined as}} the study of the structure and function of the genome as it responds to adverse xenobiotic exposure. It is the toxicological subdiscipline of pharmacogenomics, which is broadly defined as the study of inter-individual variations in whole-genome or candidate gene single-nucleotide polymorphism maps, haplotype markers, and alterations in gene expression that might correlate with drug responses. Though the term <b>toxicogenomics</b> first appeared in the literature in 1999 it was already in common use within the pharmaceutical industry as its origin was driven by marketing strategies from vendor companies. The term is still not universal accepted, and others have offered alternative terms such as chemogenomics to describe essentially the same area.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{importance}} of <b>toxicogenomics</b> was recognized early in Korea {{and a group}} of researchers was trying to build up a research infrastructure and educational system. However, since the scale of the Korean pharmaceutical industry, which was expected to play the key role in <b>toxicogenomics</b> was small compared to that of advanced countries, industry-sponsored large-scale research projects and supporting infrastructures have been lacking in Korea. Results To improve this situation, the Korean government has exerted special efforts to promote <b>toxicogenomics</b> research and development the last few years as an initiative to stimulate a premature drug development industry on par with global competition and launched several large scale research projects recently. Researchers are also trying to keep pace with government efforts by organizing local scientist groups, training young <b>toxicogenomics</b> scientists, and widening the toxicogenomic research efforts to environmental toxicity as well. Research and development from bioinformatics and genomics venture companies are also contributing to uplifting the competitiveness of the <b>toxicogenomics</b> industry. Conclusion <b>Toxicogenomics</b> in Korea is making steady progress in many directions. It is gaining ground by government and related industries as well, the research is diversified to embrace environmental genomics, and local research groups are making strategic links to international research groups such as the MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC) consortium. We expect the advancement of the Korean <b>toxicogenomics</b> research program will be beneficial not only to the local society alone, but also to international scientists as a whole. </p...|$|E
40|$|Last {{fifty years}} a {{significant}} advancement {{has been established}} in biological science.

According to this, several molecular techniques have been established to prove molecular events, effects of chemical exposure within individuals and environment. For this evaluation, the necessary of <b>toxicogenomics</b> is crucial, that deals with the effects of chemical in changing the genetic pattern along with mutation into gene. <b>Toxicogenomics</b> also deals with transcription of proteins and metabolite profiling to investigate the interaction of genes and environment stress in disease. <b>Toxicogenomics</b> also described the altered expression of genes caused by mutation and chemical exposure that cause several disease and show toxicant functions in cell.

As {{with the larger}} field of gene expression analysis, <b>toxicogenomics</b> faces the problems of probe annotation and data comparison across different array platforms. <b>Toxicogenomics</b> studies are generally built on standard toxicology studies generating biological end point data, and as such, one goal of <b>toxicogenomics</b> is to detect relationships between changes in gene expression and in those biological parameters. These challenges are best addressed through data collection into a well-designed <b>toxicogenomics</b> database.

40|$|Male Wistar rats {{were treated}} with various model {{compounds}} or the appropriate vehicle controls {{in order to create}} a reference database for <b>toxicogenomics</b> assessment of novel compounds. Hepatotoxic compounds in the database were either known hepatotoxicants or showed hepatotoxicity during preclinical testing. Histopathology and clinical chemistry data were used to anchor the transcript profiles to an established endpoint (steatosis, cholestasis, direct acting, peroxisomal proliferation or nontoxic/control). These reference data were analyzed using a supervised learning method (support vector machines, SVM) to generate classification rules. This predictive model was subsequently used to assess compounds with regard to a potential hepatotoxic liability. A steatotic and a non-hepatotoxic 5 HT 6 receptor antagonist compound from the same series were successfully discriminated by this <b>toxicogenomics</b> model. Additionally, an example is shown where a hepatotoxic liability was correctly recognized in the absence of pathological findings. In vitro experiments and a dog study confirmed the correctness of the <b>toxicogenomics</b> alert. Another interesting observation was that transcript profiles indicate toxicologically relevant changes at an earlier timepoint than routinely used methods.
