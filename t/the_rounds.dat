The International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) employs an indoor format that breaks the competition into three rounds: qualifications, semi-finals, and finals. <b>The</b> <b>rounds</b> feature different sets {{of four or five}} boulder problems, and each competitor has a fixed amount of time to attempt each problem. At the end of each round, competitors are ranked by the number of completed problems, with ties settled {{by the total number of}} attempts taken to solve the problems.|$|E

50|$|When one of {{the teams}} reaches 11 points, they play <b>the</b> mão-de-onze (<b>round</b> of eleven).

5|$|He {{scored two}} more {{victories}} on 23 and 28 April, his {{first in the}} North African Campaign. However, on 23 April, Marseille himself was shot down during his third sortie of that day by Sous-Lieutenant James Denis a Free French pilot with No. 73 Squadron RAF (8.5 victories), flying a Hawker Hurricane. Marseille's Bf 109 received almost 30 hits in the cockpit area, and three or four shattered the canopy. As Marseille was leaning forward <b>the</b> <b>rounds</b> missed him by inches. Marseille managed to crash-land his fighter. Just a month later, records show that James Denis shot down Marseille again on 21 May 1941. Marseille engaged Denis, but overshot his target. A turning dogfight ensued, in which Denis once again bested Marseille.|$|E
5|$|His next fight {{took place}} on January 7, 2006 at Madison Square Garden in New York City against Carlos Baldomir. For Judah, the fight {{was viewed as a}} tuneup bout that would lead to a lucrative bout between Judah and WBC Light Welterweight Champion Floyd Mayweather, Jr., which was {{tentatively}} scheduled for April. Judah entered the fight as a 10-to-1 favorite over Baldomir. The stage was set when Judah unsportingly punched Baldomir on the thigh during the prefight introductions instead of touching gloves to show sportsmanship. The early rounds of the fight were close, but as <b>the</b> <b>rounds</b> passed, Judah was doing less than necessary to win, while Baldomir kept applying pressure on Judah. In round seven, Judah was hurt by a right hand and Baldomir landed a series of right hands to Judah's head along the ropes during the tenth round. Baldomir defeated Judah by unanimous decision with scores of 115–113, 114–113 and 115–112 from the three judges.|$|E
5|$|In her 15th {{professional}} bout, Kentikian {{fought for}} her first world championship in Cologne, Germany, on February 16, 2007; it was also her first time headlining a fight card. She won by a ninth round technical knockout against Carolina Alvarez of Venezuela, thereby winning the vacant WBA Flyweight title. Alvarez took unanswered punches in most of <b>the</b> <b>rounds</b> and was bleeding heavily from her nose and the referee eventually stopped the fight in round nine in concern for Alvarez's health. Six weeks later, on March 30, 2007, Kentikian made her first title defense. Before a crowd of 19,500 in the Kölnarena, she fought on the undercard of the popular exhibition bout between German comedian Stefan Raab and WIBF World Champion Regina Halmich. Kentikian beat María José Núñez from Uruguay with a third round technical knockout. Núñez was knocked down in round two and Kentikian finished the fight one round later with a right cross followed up by combinations that left Núñez defenseless on the ropes, causing the referee to step in.|$|E

5|$|In {{her next}} title defense on August 29, 2008, Kentikian met Hager Finer of Israel, Halmich's last {{opponent}} before retiring.

From round five onwards, Kentikian managed to take over the bout by landing the cleaner punches and she won by unanimous decision. On December 5, 2008, Kentikian faced Anastasia Toktaulova of Russia, the reigning GBU Flyweight Champion, although the GBU title was not on the line. During the uncharacteristic tactical fight, Kentikian managed to control her opponent from the middle of the ring in most of <b>the</b> <b>rounds.</b> The three judges all scored the bout in favor of Kentikian. In December 2008, she was named Germany's female boxer of the year for the first time.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 23 October New Jersey steamed north to rearm before taking up {{position}} {{in support of the}} 3rd Marine Division 25 October. That day she shelled enemy troops located by a spotter plane. The next day New Jersey engaged targets of opportunity, destroying 11 structures, seven bunkers, a concrete observation tower, and an enemy trench line. She also received hostile fire when North Vietnamese gunners attempted to strike at New Jersey with artillery positioned near Cap Lay. Some ten to twelve rounds were launched at New Jersey; however, <b>the</b> <b>rounds</b> fired landed well short of the battleship. Aerial spotters were called in to look at the suspected gun position; they reported no artillery present but fresh tire tracks leading to a concealed area, suggesting that there had been artillery there earlier. Armed with this information New Jersey fired five 16inch shells at the site, but in the darkness spotters were unable to confirm any hits.|$|E
