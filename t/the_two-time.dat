He failed {{to make it into}} the Bundesliga Team of the Season, but was included in a list of the Best Defenders for the 2013–14 campaign. Rodríguez's nine assists also meant that he created more goals than any other full-back in Europe. His impressive displays during the season included 2.3 key passes per game, the same number as Andrea Pirlo, <b>the</b> <b>two-time</b> reigning Serie A Footballer of the Year, and 2.6 successful dribbles per game, more than Cristiano Ronaldo, the reigning Ballon d'Or winner.|$|E

40|$|In this work, the out-of-equilibrium {{dynamics}} of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation in (1 + 1) dimensions is studied by means of numerical simulations, focussing on <b>the</b> <b>two-times</b> evolution of an interface {{in the absence of}} any disordered environment. This work shows that even in this simple case, a rich aging behavior develops. A multiplicative aging scenario for <b>the</b> <b>two-times</b> roughness of <b>the</b> system is observed, characterized by the same growth exponent as in the stationary regime. The analysis permits the identification of the relevant growing correlation length, accounting for the important scaling variables in the system. The distribution function of <b>the</b> <b>two-times</b> roughness is also computed and described in terms of a generalized scaling relation. These results give good insight into the glassy {{dynamics of}} the important case of a non-linear elastic line in a disordered medium. Comment: 14 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

5|$|Harvard {{entered the}} season as <b>the</b> <b>two-time</b> {{defending}} Ivy League Champion, but its roster was greatly changed due to graduation and the 2012 Harvard cheating scandal {{that led to the}} withdrawal of two star players. With reduced expectations, the team entered the season expected to finish second in conference. During the season, the team swept the three opponents that are also from Boston. The win against Boston College, gave Amaker his sixth victory against no defeats over Atlantic Coast Conference foes. Despite the team's turmoil, it prevailed to win the 2012–13 Ivy League men's basketball season regular season championship, earning the team an automatic bid to the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, where it won the school's first ever NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament game. The tournament victory over #3 seed New Mexico was also the school's first victory over a top 10 ranked team.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the Colts had {{a greatly}} {{improved}} defense over that of recent years. Combining this with their offense, they won their first 13 games, including a 40–21 rout of <b>the</b> <b>two-time</b> defending Super Bowl champions, New England. This was Manning's first road win against the Patriots in eight attempts, {{and his three}} touchdown passes earned him AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors. By Week 15, the Colts had a perfect 13–0 record, and had secured the AFC South and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. Nevertheless, head coach Tony Dungy {{made the decision to}} play all of his regular starters against the Chargers. However, the Colts played a sub-par game against the Chargers and fell short of the win; the score was 26–17. Manning finished the 2005 season with , {{the first time he had}} thrown for under 4,000yards since his rookie season in 1998, largely because Manning sat out much of the final two games with the top AFC seed clinched. His quarterback rating of 104.1 was the highest in the league for the season.|$|E

5|$|The 1990 New York Giants {{season was}} one of the most {{successful}} seasons in the professional football franchise's history. The Giants, who play in the National Football Conference (NFC) of the National Football League (NFL), won their sixth championship and second Super Bowl. Led by linebacker Lawrence Taylor and quarterbacks Phil Simms and Jeff Hostetler, the Giants posted a 13–3 record before defeating the Chicago Bears and <b>the</b> <b>two-time</b> defending Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers in the NFC playoffs. In Super Bowl XXV, they defeated the Buffalo Bills 20–19 in Tampa Stadium against a patriotic backdrop inspired by the recently started Gulf War. The story of the season is the subject of a recent book, When the Cheering Stops, by defensive end Leonard Marshall and CBSsports.com co-writer William Bendetson.|$|E
5|$|The Browns' {{debut in}} the NFL in the 1950 season was closely watched; while the team {{dominated}} the AAFC in its short existence, some sportswriters, NFL owners and coaches considered the league inferior. Cleveland put all doubts to rest in its first game against <b>the</b> <b>two-time</b> defending champion Philadelphia Eagles, winning 35–10. In {{a game against the}} Washington Redskins later in the season, Groza broke a 24-year-old NFL record by kicking his 13th field goal of the season. He also scored the only touchdown of his career in that game on a reception from Graham. The Browns ended the regular season with a 10–2 record in the American Conference, tied with the New York Giants. That forced a playoff against the Giants in which Groza kicked the winning field goal for the Browns with under a minute to play.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{defeated}} the Chicago Bears 31–3 in the divisional playoff round, {{setting up a}} rematch with the 49ers in San Francisco for the NFC Championship and a Super Bowl berth. As they had in Week 12, the Giants defense held San Francisco's offense in check, limiting San Francisco to one touchdown and two field goals. The 49ers defense also held the Giants' offense in check, limiting the Giants to four Matt Bahr field goals through the midway point of the fourth of quarter. In the game's waning moments Erik Howard caused a Roger Craig fumble, and Lawrence Taylor recovered it. The Giants drove down the field and got into field goal range for Bahr. On the game's last play, Bahr hit a 42–yard field goal to give the Giants the NFC title, 15–13, over <b>the</b> <b>two-time</b> defending Super Bowl champions. Bahr set an NFC Championship Game record with his fifth field goal of the day.|$|E

5|$|After {{spending}} {{about a decade}} living as a recluse on Mercer Island near Seattle, Russell rose to prominence again {{at the turn of}} the millennium. Russell's Rules was published in 2001, and in January 2006, he convinced Miami Heat superstar center Shaquille O'Neal to bury the hatchet with fellow NBA superstar and former Los Angeles Lakers teammate Kobe Bryant, with whom O'Neal had a bitter public feud. Later that year, on November 17, 2006, <b>the</b> <b>two-time</b> NCAA winner Russell was recognized for his impact on college basketball as a member of the founding class of the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame. He was one of five, along with John Wooden, Oscar Robertson, Dean Smith and Dr. James Naismith, selected to represent the inaugural class. On May 20, 2007, Russell was awarded an honorary doctorate by Suffolk University, where he served as its commencement speaker, and Russell received an honorary degree from Harvard University on June 7, 2007. On June 18, 2007, Russell was inducted as a member of the founding class of the FIBA Hall of Fame. Russell was also honored during the 2009 NBA All-Star Weekend in Phoenix.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{advanced}} to face <b>the</b> <b>two-time</b> defending champion San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship game on January 20, 1991, {{in front of}} 65,750 fans at Candlestick Park. The game was a rematch of the 7–3 49ers win one month earlier. The teams alternated field goals {{in the first and}} second quarter to make the score 6–6 at halftime. Less than five minutes into the third quarter, 49ers quarterback Joe Montana threw a 61-yard touchdown pass to receiver John Taylor to give San Francisco a 13–6 lead. A Giants field goal made the score 13–9 {{at the end of the}} third quarter. With 9:42 remaining in the game, Leonard Marshall sacked and injured Montana, who left the game. The Giants got the ball back, but were stopped on a key third down and one. On fourth down, Parcells called a fake punt, which resulted in a long run by Gary Reasons to set up another Giants field goal, making the score 13–12. The 49ers then attempted to run out the clock, but Giants nose tackle Erik Howard made a key play, fighting through a double-team to knock the ball out of running back Roger Craig's possession. Lawrence Taylor caught the fumble in mid-air, which gave the ball to the Giants at their own 43-yard line. Hostetler completed passes to Bavaro and Baker, advancing the Giants to within Matt Bahr's field-goal range. Bahr's fifth made kick of the day, a 42-yarder with no time left on the clock, gave the Giants a 15–13 victory.|$|E
5|$|The Original Six era was {{a period}} of dynasties. The Toronto Maple Leafs won the Stanley Cup five times between 1944–45 and 1950–51. In the 1951 Stanley Cup Finals, the Maple Leafs {{defeated}} the Canadiens four games to one in the only final in NHL history when all games were decided in overtime. Beginning in 1948–49, the Red Wings won seven consecutive regular season titles, a feat that no other team has accomplished. During that time, the Wings won four Stanley Cups. It was during the 1952 Stanley Cup Finals that the Legend of the Octopus was created. Brothers Pete and Jerry Cusimano brought a dead octopus to the Detroit Olympia for the fourth game of the finals. They hoped that the octopus would inspire Detroit to an eighth game victory. Detroit went on to defeat Montreal 3–0 and the tradition was born. The Red Wings faced the Canadiens in the Stanley Cup Finals in three consecutive seasons between 1954 and 1956. Detroit won the first two match-ups, but Montreal captured the 1956 Stanley Cup, ending one dynasty and starting another. The Canadiens won five consecutive championships between 1956 and 1960, a feat no other team has duplicated. The Original Six era ended with the 1967 Stanley Cup Finals between <b>the</b> <b>two-time</b> defending champion Canadiens, and the Maple Leafs. The Maple Leafs finished the era by winning the Cup four times between 1962 and 1967, their 1967 championship is the last Maple Leafs title to date. The Chicago Blackhawks, who won in 1961, are the only other team to win the Stanley Cup during this period.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the response properties of granular {{media in the}} framework of the so-called Random Tetris Model. We monitor, for different driving procedures, several quantities: the evolution of the density and of the density profiles, the ageing properties through <b>the</b> <b>two-times</b> correlation functions and <b>the</b> <b>two-times</b> mean-square distance between the potential energies, the response function defined in terms of the difference in the potential energies of two replica driven in two slightly different ways. We focus in particular on the role played by the spatial inhomogeneities (structures) spontaneously emerging during the compaction process, the history of the sample and the driving procedure. It turns out that none of these ingredients can be neglected for the correct interpretation of the experimental or numerical data. We discuss the problem of the optimization of the compaction process and we comment on the validity of our results for the description of granular materials in a thermodynamic framework.
