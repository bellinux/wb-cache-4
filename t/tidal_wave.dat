Based on the physical characters of tidal bores, in this paper we propose a novel method to model and render this phenomenon, especially the <b>tidal</b> <b>waves</b> in Qiantang estuary. According to Boltzmann equation for <b>tidal</b> <b>waves,</b> we solve it with the novel triangle mesh of Kinectic Flux Vector Splitting (KFVS) mode.

5|$|On August 18, the Szczecin Shipyard {{joined the}} strike, under the {{leadership}} of Marian Jurczyk. A <b>tidal</b> <b>wave</b> of strikes swept the coast, closing ports and bringing the economy to a halt. With KOR assistance and support from many intellectuals, workers occupying factories, mines and shipyards across Poland joined forces. Within days, over 200 factories and enterprises had joined the strike committee. By August 21, most of Poland was affected by the strikes, from coastal shipyards to the mines of the Upper Silesian Industrial Area (in Upper Silesia, the city of Jastrzębie-Zdrój became center of the strikes, with a separate committee organized there, see Jastrzębie-Zdrój 1980 strikes).

40|$|In an X-ray binary system, the {{companion}} star feeds the compact neutron star with plasma materials via accretions. The spinning neutron star is likely {{covered with a}} thin "magnetized ocean" and may support magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) <b>tidal</b> <b>waves.</b> While modulating the thermal properties of the ocean, MHD <b>tidal</b> <b>waves</b> periodically shake {{the base of the}} stellar magnetosphere that traps energetic particles, including radiating relativistic electrons. For a radio pulsar, MHD <b>tidal</b> <b>waves</b> in the stellar surface layer may modulate radio emission processes and leave indelible signatures on timescales different from the spin period. Accretion activities are capable of exciting these waves but may also obstruct or obscure their detections meanwhile. Under fortuitous conditions, MHD <b>tidal</b> <b>waves</b> might be detectable and offer valuable means to probe properties of the underlying neutron star. Similar situations may also occur for a cataclysmic variable [...] an accretion binary system that contains a rotating magnetic white dwarf. This Letter presents the theory for MHD <b>tidal</b> <b>waves</b> in the magnetized ocean of a rotating degenerate star and emphasizes their potential diagnostics in X-ray and radio emissions.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the interactions between periodic <b>tidal</b> <b>waves</b> and coastal aquifers. The analysis is based on a set of equations governing the hydrodynamic interactions near coastal regions consisting of a modified Fokker-Planck equation for modelling the transport of salts, a Boussinesq equation for groundwater flow and a <b>wave</b> equation for <b>tidal</b> <b>waves.</b> The modified Fokker-Planck equation is featured with a time- and scale-dependent dispersivity, and solutions of the Boussinesq equation are obtained subject to phase-modulated <b>tidal</b> <b>waves</b> as the boundary condition which is a solution of the wave equation. The phase-modulated periodic solution of the wave equation is shown to satisfactorily simulate the uneven twin peaks of semi-diurnal tides. Fourier series solutions of the Boussinesq equation subject to periodic boundary conditions reveal that the <b>tidal</b> <b>waves</b> damp towards land, and the half amplitude of the tide above the mean sea level is greater than that below it. Seawater-freshwater interface is also analysed using the modified Fokker-Planck equation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{procedures for}} analysing {{the interactions between}} <b>tidal</b> <b>waves</b> and coastal aquifers overlaying a sloping impervious bed, using Boussinesq equation and wave equation. Fourier series solutions of a linearised Boussinesq equation are presented subject to a periodic boundary condition (BC). The periodic BC is a phase-modulated periodic solution of the wave equation which {{has been shown to}} satisfactorily simulate uneven twin peaks of semi-diurnal tides as observed in a study area on the east coast of Queensland, Australia. Numerical analyses show that the Fourier series solutions of Boussinesq equation subject to periodic BCs reveal two important features of the <b>tidal</b> <b>waves.</b> First, the <b>tidal</b> <b>waves</b> damp towards landward, and second, the half amplitude of the tide above the mean sea level is greater than that below it. While the first feature is clearly expected, the second feature is physically more meaningful and important, and is confirmed by the field data. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
