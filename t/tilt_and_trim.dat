40|$|By {{presenting}} oriented Gabor patches either monocularly or binocularly, we dissociated retinal orientation from perceived <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> perceived slant. After {{adapting to}} binocular patches, with zero apparent <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> non-zero slant, small <b>tilt</b> after-effects (TAEs) <b>and</b> large slant after-effects (SAE) were measured. Adapting to monocular patches with non-zero <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> zero slant produced large TAEs and smaller SAEs. This {{pattern of results}} suggests that a common, low-level adaptation to monocular orientation is involved in slant <b>and</b> <b>tilt</b> after-effects. However, the incomplete transfer between slant <b>and</b> <b>tilt</b> {{makes it clear that}} higher-level adaptation is also involved, perhaps at the level of surface representation...|$|R

40|$|A {{face seal}} model is analyzed, {{taking into account}} both {{diametral}} <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> coning of the primary seal ring. The Reynolds equation for incompressible fluid is solved analytically using the narrow seal approximation. The solution covers {{a wide range of}} <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> coning angles, from complete alignment to touch-down. Seal performance like axial force, <b>tilting</b> moment, axial <b>and</b> angular stiffness, and leakage are analyzed. It is found that interaction between diametral <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> coning strongly affects seal performance...|$|R

50|$|Unlike most view cameras, {{the shift}} {{mechanism}} allows shifts along only one axis, <b>and</b> the <b>tilt</b> mechanism allows tilts about only one axis; however, {{the rotation of}} the mechanisms allows the orientations of the axes to be changed, providing, in effect, combined <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> swing, and combined rise/fall and lateral shift. The <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> shift functions cannot be independently rotated. The lens is supplied with these functions at 90° to each other (e.g., providing <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> lateral shift); they can be changed to work in the same directions (e.g., providing <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> rise/fall) by removing four screws, rotating the front of the lens 90°, and reinstalling the screws.|$|R

40|$|The <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> {{decentration}} of {{intraocular lens}} (IOL) result in defocussing, astigmatism, and wavefront aberration after operation. The {{objective is to}} give a method to estimate the <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> decentration of IOL more accurately. Based on AS-OCT images of twelve eyes from eight cases with subluxation lens after operation, we fitted spherical equation to the data obtained from {{the images of the}} anterior and posterior surfaces of the IOL. By the established relationship between IOL <b>tilt</b> (decentration) <b>and</b> the scanned angle, at which a piece of AS-OCT image was taken by the instrument, the IOL <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> decentration were calculated. IOL <b>tilt</b> angle <b>and</b> decentration of each subject were given. Moreover, the horizontal <b>and</b> vertical <b>tilt</b> was also obtained. Accordingly, the possible errors of IOL <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> decentration existed in the method employed by AS-OCT instrument. Based on 6 – 12 pieces of AS-OCT images at different directions, the <b>tilt</b> angle <b>and</b> decentration values were shown, respectively. The method of the surface fitting to the IOL surface can accurately analyze the IOL’s location, and six pieces of AS-OCT images at three pairs symmetrical directions are enough to get <b>tilt</b> angle <b>and</b> decentration value of IOL more precisely...|$|R

A review {{is made of}} changing container ship hull designs {{up to the present}} time, together with available model test data for sinkage <b>and</b> <b>trim.</b> Two potential flow methods (slender-body method and Rankine-source method) are discussed with reference to the model test results. It is shown that slender-body theory is able to give good predictions of dynamic sinkage <b>and</b> <b>trim</b> in wide canals or open water, while Rankine-source methods offer an accurate solution particularly for ships at high speed in narrow canals...|$|R

40|$|Adaptive optics {{systems can}} measure {{high-order}} aberrations using an artificial laser beacon {{without the need}} for a relatively bright object near the object being imaged. Unfortunately, <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> focus measurements are difficult to obtain from a laser beacon. One solution is to use light from the object being imaged to measure <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> focus. Through analysis, I estimate the performance of using a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor with 2 by 2 sub-apertures for measuring <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> focus. Specifically, I discuss implementing this scheme for the sodium beacon adaptive optics upgrade to the Starfire Optical Range (SOR) 3. 5 m telescope. I use wave-optics simulation tools to evaluate the performance of the <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> focus sensor in the SOR sodium beacon system. 1...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAn {{unsteady}} Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes {{method is}} developed {{to account for}} sinkage <b>and</b> <b>trim</b> effects in the calculation of steadily advancing surface ship. Volume of fluid method (VOF) is devised {{for the treatment of}} free surface. The sinkage <b>and</b> <b>trim</b> were predicted by using dynamic mesh technology, and the motion of ship is controlled by six degrees of freedom (6 DOF) code. Predicted results for sinkage <b>and</b> <b>trim</b> <b>and</b> resistance at seven Froude numbers (from Fn= 0. 15 to Fn= 0. 45) were compared against experimental data, showing good agreement. A plenty of numerical simulations for resistance of ship model under different running attitudes are carried out. On these bases, the results of numerical simulation and the factors which affect ship resistance are analyzed, the formulas for calculating the ship resistance under different drafts <b>and</b> longitudinal <b>trims</b> <b>and</b> arbitrary drift-trim coupled running attitudes are deduced and validated. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|Canon {{currently}} offers four lenses with <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> shift functions: the TS-E 17 mm 4, the TS-E 24 mm 3.5L II, the TS-E 45 mm 2.8, and the TS-E 90 mm 2.8. On the 45 mm and 90 mm lenses, {{the mechanisms}} providing the <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> shift functions can be rotated 90° {{to the left}} or right so that they operate horizontally, vertically, or at intermediate orientations. The lenses are supplied with the <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> shift movements at right angles to each other; they can be modified so that the movements operate in the same direction. The 17 mm and the 24 mm version II lenses allow independent rotation of the <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> shift movements. The 90 mm lens gives 0.29 magnification, making it usable for moderate close-up work. All four lenses provide automatic aperture control.|$|R
