5|$|The South Tower has one freight {{and three}} {{passenger}} elevators. The elevators are the second fastest {{in the city}} of San Francisco, second only to those in 555 California Street and tied with those in 555 Mission Street. The elevators of the South Tower can travel from the ground floor to the 61st floor (the mechanical level) in only 26 seconds to speed passenger traffic flow. This means the elevators can travel about 1,200 vertical feet (366 m) in a minute. The elevators have artificial intelligence control systems that figure out passenger traffic patterns and dispatch the three elevators to handle passenger needs accordingly. <b>The</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> elevator shaft has a cylinder filled with hydraulic oil to stop a falling elevator without injuring the passengers inside.|$|E
5|$|During the American {{assault on}} Attu Island, 2,400 Japanese troops were killed, and only 25 were captured. The Americans' losses were {{significantly}} lower, at 566 dead and 1,442 wounded. The {{bodies of the}} killed Japanese troops were buried in mass graves on the island – only five per cent of Japanese troops fighting on Attu Island wore dog tags, making identification difficult. In addition, many fallen Japanese were buried by their fellow soldiers up in the island's peaks, and many bodies still remain undiscovered. The American burials were undertaken at Massacre Bay {{as well as at}} Holtz Bay – in the former case, the bodies of the soldiers were buried in group graves. Large holes of seven feet in depth were dug by bulldozers, and eight small foot-deep graves were dug at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> of these holes to serve as the American soldiers' final resting places.|$|E
5|$|One of the Techniques {{most popular}} {{features}} is the Sliver Box, an analogue of the Vent {{feature of the}} Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which allows readers to submit any comment they wish. Comments are submitted on the Techniques website and as many Slivers that will fit appear in the week's paper, usually in order of submission. Slivers are subject to minimal censorship, with only full names of non-public figures, personal information and strong profanities typically removed or altered. Other entries are occasionally removed or truncated, usually in cases of spamming of the Sliver submission system. According to the paper, the Box is used to fill empty room left between advertisements {{in order to maintain}} a modular layout style. It is not uncommon for students to have conversations using the Sliver Box. Slivers were originally comments made by editorial board members during deadline night and were placed in narrow boxes ("Slivers") at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> page. Comments made on deadline night and opinions of editorial board members still occasionally find their way into the Sliver Box.|$|E

5|$|The {{bell tower}} rises , and halfway up its length {{is a large}} round sign. The sign denotes the school district, Pine Rock, and {{the year of the}} school's foundation. Originally, the sign graced the front {{exterior}} wall of the larger of the two rooms. The tower rises above the roof by about fifteen feet and at its top are four arches, one on each side. Wooden construction is found throughout the tower, its arches, {{and the rest of the}} schoolhouse, save the limestone and cement foundation. At <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> of the four arches are balustrades decorated with spindles. Inside the tower is the school bell. The bell house is topped with a multi-gabled roof. The roof of the overall schoolhouse is covered with cedar shingles and features chimneys rising from each of the classrooms.|$|E
25|$|These {{were special}} edition Chevettes made by Star Custom Vehicles, Station Road, Ampthill. They came {{with black and}} silver paint, red graphics, a plaque inside the door stating styles by Farina, sport {{steering}} wheel, flared arches and low-profile wheels. Blackwatch was written on {{the nose of the}} car and on <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> door.|$|E
25|$|Coinciding {{with the}} well {{understood}} {{implications of a}} loss of coolant accident, the insufficient cooling eventually led to meltdowns in Reactors 1, 2, and 3. The {{full extent of the}} movement of the resulting corium is unknown but it is now considered to be at least through <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> reactor pressure vessel(RPV), residing somewhere between there and the water-table below each reactor. In a similar manner to what was observed at reactor 4 in Chernobyl.|$|E

50|$|There are 2 groups called Group A and B. The top two {{finishers}} in {{each group}} will qualify for <b>the</b> Semi-Finals. <b>The</b> <b>bottom</b> finishers <b>of</b> <b>each</b> group will qualify for the Relegation Final.|$|R
25|$|Folio size is {{approximately}} 28×16cm {{with a single}} column of text averaging 11.5cm. There are between 26 and 32 lines (rows) of text per page, although both {{the width of the}} rows and the number of rows per page increase progressively. Rows of text at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> page are damaged (lacunose), with between 1–2 lines lacunose {{in the first quarter of}} the MS, 2–3 lines lacunose in the central half, and up to seven lines lacunose in the final quarter.|$|E
25|$|The Flyers {{unveiled}} second-generation jerseys for the 1982–83 season. The {{main difference}} was the increased {{width of the}} shoulder and arm stripes with black trim added to {{the border of the}} stripes. Also, a pinstripe (black for the white jersey, orange for the dark) was added to <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> sleeve. With the exception of a similarly designed black jersey replacing the orange and the NHL switching back to wearing darks at home and whites on the road prior to 2003–04, this design was used {{until the end of the}} 2006–07 season.|$|E
25|$|Hyperion's {{surface is}} covered with deep, {{sharp-edged}} craters that give it {{the appearance of a}} giant sponge. Dark material fills <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> crater. The reddish substance contains long chains of carbon and hydrogen and appears very similar to material found on other Saturnian satellites, most notably Iapetus. Scientists attribute Hyperion's unusual, sponge-like appearance {{to the fact that it}} has an unusually low density for such a large object. Its low density makes Hyperion quite porous, with a weak surface gravity. These characteristics mean impactors tend to compress the surface, rather than excavating it, and most material that is blown off the surface never returns.|$|E
50|$|The Second Division is {{geographically}} {{divided into}} 5 zonesThe winners <b>of</b> <b>each</b> zone are automatically promoted into the First Division. <b>The</b> <b>bottom</b> finishers <b>of</b> <b>each</b> zone lose professional status and are relegated into the Amateur Football League.|$|R
25|$|The {{following}} table {{summarizes the}} major events {{and characteristics of}} the periods of time making up the geologic time scale. This table is arranged with the most recent geologic periods at the top, and the most ancient at <b>the</b> <b>bottom.</b> <b>The</b> height <b>of</b> <b>each</b> table entry does not correspond to the duration <b>of</b> <b>each</b> subdivision <b>of</b> time.|$|R
50|$|As {{part of the}} renovation, all 44 piers {{that support}} the Tabernacle's roof were {{reinforced}} with steel bars, which were inserted into the piers from <b>the</b> <b>bottom.</b> <b>The</b> foundation <b>of</b> <b>each</b> pier was also reinforced with concrete. Steel boxes were used to connect trusses, and were also attached to the piers, clinched tight with structured steel.|$|R
25|$|In 1999, {{the open}} access journal Journal of Medical Internet Research was launched, which from its {{inception}} decided to publish {{the names of the}} reviewers at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> published article. Also in 1999, the British Medical Journal moved to an open peer review system, revealing reviewers' identities to the authors but not the readers, and in 2000, the medical journals in the open access BMC series published by BioMed Central, launched using open peer review. As with the BMJ, the reviewers' names are included on the peer review reports. In addition, if the article is published the reports are made available online as part of the 'pre-publication history'.|$|E
25|$|P46 is {{the second}} New Testament {{manuscript}} in the Chester Beatty collection (P. II), and was a codex that contained the Pauline Epistles dating c. 200. What remains today of the manuscript is roughly 85 out of 104 leaves consisting of Romans chapters 5-6, 8-15, all of Hebrews, Ephesians, Galatians, Philippians, Colossians, virtually all of 1–2 Corinthians and 1 Thessalonians 1-2, 5. The leaves have partially deteriorated, resulting {{in the loss of}} some lines at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> folio. The manuscript split up between the Chester Beatty Library and the University of Michigan. Scholars do not believe the Pastoral epistles were included originally in the codex, based on the amount of space required in the missing leaves; they conclude 2 Thessalonians would have occupied the final portion of the codex. The inclusion of Hebrews, a book that was questioned canonically and not considered authored by Paul, is notable. The placement of it following Romans is unique against most other witnesses, as is the ordering of Galatians following Ephesians.|$|E
25|$|The {{first floor}} {{exterior}} wall consists of limestone quoins {{at the corner}} and stone coursing. A string course with Greek decorative carving is set {{between the first and}} second floors, and acts as the window sill for the second floor windows and as the balustrade for the entrance loggia. The second and third floor exterior walls have stone quoins as well. Between each window on the second floor is a panel inlaid with variegated marble and surrounded by egg-and-dart moldings. The base of the panel is decorated with scrollwork, and the top by a bas-relief urn. Five fruit-shaped clusters decorate the outside frame of the furthermost window on this floor (the lowest cluster supported by a tiny putto), while above each window is a false pediment topped by an escutcheon flanked by drapery. Variegated marble panels are set between each window on the third floor as well, <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> decorated with scrollwork and a small dramatic mask. The sill of each third floor window is of scrollwork, while the window is topped by scrollwork and a torch. Circular medallions with pendants decorate the outside frame of the furthermost window on the third floor. A bas-relief putto stands atop each medallion and panel, supporting fruit swags. Between the third and fourth (or attic) floors is a molding decorated with repetitive small eggs which serves as the sill for the fourth floor windows. The truncated hipped roof slightly overhangs the walls. The cornice is decorated with dentils and acanthus carvings beneath the roofline. The roof, originally red tile, was changed at some point to asbestos roof shingles with copper flashing. There are seven chimneys on the roof, and about five skylights on the flat section.|$|E
50|$|The eight fencers who {{had placed}} in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> four <b>of</b> <b>each</b> {{pool in the}} semifinals competed for 9th to 16th places in the {{consolation}} pool. Renaud withdrew, making room for de Saint-Aignan to be activated from alternate status.|$|R

50|$|The 2015 County Championship {{took the}} same format as the 2014 {{championship}} {{in which there was}} four groups of four with the top two qualifying for <b>the</b> quarter-finals. <b>Bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> group play in relegation play-offs to decide which team is relegated the 2016 intermediate championship.|$|R
2500|$|All {{the inner}} pages have {{seasonal}} flowers at the side, and different [...] "華" [...] {{characters in the}} centre (in English this means [...] "Chinese"). [...] As well as being printed in red at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> page, the passport number is perforated through the top section of all the odd-numbered pages. [...] At <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> page is a gold outline of the Great Wall of China. [...] The seasonal flower is printed across the middle of even-numbered and odd-numbered pages. [...] When two pages are rolled up such that they meet each other, the seasonal flower on the right margin of odd-numbered page matches up with the flower on the left margin of the even-numbered page (e.g. pages 11 and 14), forming a complete bunch of flowers.|$|E
2500|$|Five level sensors in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> S-II {{propellant}} tank were armed during S-II flight, allowing any two to trigger S-II cutoff and staging {{when they were}} uncovered. One second after the second stage cut off it separated and several seconds later the third stage ignited. Solid fuel retro-rockets mounted on the interstage {{at the top of}} the S-II fired to back it away from the S-IVB. The S-II impacted about [...] from the launch site.|$|E
2500|$|In 1943, the Japanese {{commuted}} {{the sentence}} of Dr. Ba Maw, an outspoken advocate for Burmese self-rule, and installed {{him as the}} head of the puppet government. From 1943 onward the Japanese issued paper scrip currency of 1, 5 and 10 Rupee with a 100 Rupee note in 1944. [...] The Japanese characters in the oblong box at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> note read “Government of Great Imperial Japan” and the contents of the seal at the lower right of the note comprise the Japanese symbol for the Minister of Finance.|$|E

50|$|In Indian, ten {{columns of}} three cards are dealt; <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> card <b>of</b> <b>each</b> column is faced down. Furthermore, cards are built down by any suit other than its own. For example, any 5 {{can be placed}} over the 6♥ except the 5♥.|$|R
5000|$|Two decks (104 cards) are used. Twenty-eight {{cards are}} dealt out to seven {{diminishing}} columns with <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> card <b>of</b> <b>each</b> column face up, and a further seven cards (the [...] "devils") are dealt {{face up to}} the right of the columns.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the most}} {{traditional}} versions, various sizes of natural gourds are attached below {{the keys to}} act as resonators; in more sophisticated versions carved wooden resonators are substituted, allowing for more precise tuning of pitch. [...] In Central America and Mexico, a hole is often carved into <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> resonator and then covered with a delicate membrane taken from the intestine of a pig to add a characteristic [...] "buzzing" [...] or [...] "rattling" [...] sound known as charleo. In more contemporary-style marimbas, wood is replaced by PVC tubing. The holes in the bottoms of the tubes are covered with {{a thin layer of}} paper to produce the buzzing noise.|$|E
2500|$|The Books of the Bible, {{according}} to its Preface, uses characteristics such as [...] "changes in topic, movement in place or time, or shifts from one kind of writing to another" [...] to identify the natural literary divisions within biblical books. It also relies on the tendency of authors to repeat [...] "particular phrases… each time they [...] the transition from one section to another." [...] The placement of these phrases [...] "reinforces a structure that can already be recognized implicitly from other characteristics." [...] The Books of the Bible uses line spacing of different widths to mark off natural literary sections on various levels. [...] It still provides a chapter and verse range, in faded type, at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> page.|$|E
2500|$|In 1991 John Wisden & Co Ltd {{produced}} its own facsimile set in {{a distinctive}} yellow box. This again comprised editions from 1864 to 1878 inclusive and was limited to 1000 sets.
