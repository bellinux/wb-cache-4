5|$|For {{reasons that}} remain obscure, the planet's <b>thermosphere</b> {{is at an}} anomalously high {{temperature}} of about 750K. The planet is {{too far from the}} Sun for this heat to be generated by ultraviolet radiation. One candidate for a heating mechanism is atmospheric interaction with ions in the planet's magnetic field. Other candidates are gravity waves from the interior that dissipate in the atmosphere. The <b>thermosphere</b> contains traces of carbon dioxide and water, which may have been deposited from external sources such as meteorites and dust.|$|E
5|$|The {{mesosphere}} of Venus can {{be divided}} into two layers: the lower one between 62–73km and the upper one between 73–95km. In the first layer the temperature is nearly constant at 230K (−43°C). This layer coincides with the upper cloud deck. In the second layer temperature starts to decrease again reaching about 165K (−108°C) at the altitude of 95km, where mesopause begins. It is the coldest part of the Venusian dayside atmosphere. In the dayside mesopause, which serves as a boundary between the mesophere and <b>thermosphere</b> and is located between 95–120km, temperature increases to a constant—about 300–400K (27–127°C)—value prevalent in the <b>thermosphere.</b> In contrast, the nightside Venusian <b>thermosphere</b> is the coldest place on Venus with temperature as low as 100K (−173°C). It is even called a cryosphere.|$|E
5|$|The {{circulation}} {{patterns in}} the upper mesosphere and <b>thermosphere</b> of Venus are completely different {{from those in the}} lower atmosphere. At altitudes 90–150km the Venusian air moves from the dayside to nightside of the planet, with upwelling over sunlit hemisphere and downwelling over dark hemisphere. The downwelling over the nightside causes adiabatic heating of the air, which forms a warm layer in the nightside mesosphere at the altitudes 90–120km. The temperature of this layer—230K (−43°C) is far higher than the typical temperature found in the nightside thermosphere—100K (−173°C). The air circulated from the dayside also carries oxygen atoms, which after recombination form excited molecules of oxygen in the long-lived singlet state (1Δg), which then relax and emit infrared radiation at the wavelength 1.27μm. This radiation from the altitude range 90–100km is often observed from the ground and spacecraft. The nightside upper mesosphere and <b>thermosphere</b> of Venus is also the source of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium emissions of CO2 and nitric oxide molecules, which are responsible for the low temperature of the nightside <b>thermosphere.</b>|$|E
40|$|Absorption of high-energy {{radiation}} in planetary <b>thermospheres</b> {{is believed}} {{to lead to the}} formation of planetary winds. The resulting mass-loss rates can affect the evolution, particularly of small gas planets. We present 1 D, spherically symmetric hydrodynamic simulations of the escaping atmospheres of 18 hot gas planets in the solar neighborhood. Our sample only includes strongly irradiated planets, whose expanded atmospheres may be detectable via transit spectroscopy. The simulations were performed with the PLUTO-CLOUDY interface, which couples a detailed photoionization and plasma simulation code with a general MHD code. We study the thermospheric escape and derive improved estimates for the planetary mass-loss rates. Our simulations reproduce the temperature-pressure profile measured via sodium D absorption in HD 189733 b, but show unexplained differences in the case of HD 209458 b. In contrast to general assumptions, we find that the gravitationally more tightly bound <b>thermospheres</b> of massive and compact planets, such as HAT-P- 2 b are hydrodynamically stable. Compact planets dispose of the radiative energy input through hydrogen Lyα and free-free emission. Radiative cooling is also important in HD 189733 b, but it decreases toward smaller planets like GJ 436 b. The simulations show that the strong and cool winds of smaller planets mainly cause strong Lyα absorption but little emission. Compact and massive planets with hot, stable <b>thermospheres</b> cause small absorption signals but are strong Lyα emitters, possibly detectable with the current instrumentation. The absorption and emission signals provide a possible distinction between these two classes of <b>thermospheres</b> in hot gas planets. According to our results, WASP- 80 and GJ 3470 are currently the most promising targets for observational follow-up aimed at detecting atmospheric Lyα absorption signals.

40|$|Abstract. Because {{the solar}} {{radiation}} and particle environment {{plays a major}} role in all atmospheric processes like ionization, dissociation, the heating of the upper atmospheres, and thermal and non-thermal atmospheric loss processes, the long-time evolution of planetary atmospheres and their water inventories can only be understood within the context of the evolving Sun. We compare the effect of solar induced X-ray and EUV (XUV) heating on the upper atmospheres of Earth, Venus and Mars since the time when the Sun arrived to the Zero-Age-Main-Sequence (ZAMS) about 4. 6 Gyr ago. We apply a diffusive-gravitational equilibrium and thermal balance model for studying heating of the early <b>thermospheres</b> by pho-todissociation and ionization processes, due to exothermic chemical reactions and cooling by IR-radiating molecules like CO 2, NO, OH, etc. Our model simulations result in extended <b>thermospheres</b> for early Earth, Venus and Mars.

5|$|The exhaust can {{be transported}} to the Arctic region in little over a day, {{although}} the exact mechanism of this very high-speed transport is unknown. As the water migrates northward, it falls from the <b>thermosphere</b> down into the colder mesosphere, which occupies {{the region of the}} atmosphere just below. Although this mechanism is the cause of individual noctilucent clouds, it is not thought to be a major contributor to the phenomenon as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Above the troposphere, the {{atmosphere}} is usually divided into the stratosphere, mesosphere, and <b>thermosphere.</b> Each layer has a different lapse rate, defining {{the rate of change}} in temperature with height. Beyond these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind. Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth.

40|$|Gas {{planets in}} close {{proximity}} to their host stars experience photoevaporative mass loss. The energy-limited escape concept is generally used to derive estimates for the planetary mass-loss rates. Our photoionization hydrodynamics simulations of the <b>thermospheres</b> of hot gas planets show that the energy-limited escape concept is valid only for planets with a gravitational potential lower than _ 10 (-Φ_G) < 13. 11 erg g^- 1 because in these planets the radiative energy input is efficiently used to drive the planetary wind. Massive and compact planets with _ 10 (-Φ_G) ≳ 13. 6 erg g^- 1 exhibit more tightly bound atmospheres in which the complete radiative energy input is re-emitted through hydrogen Lyα and free-free emission. These planets therefore host hydrodynamically stable <b>thermospheres.</b> Between these two extremes the strength of the planetary winds rapidly declines {{as a result of a}} decreasing heating efficiency. Small planets undergo enhanced evaporation because they host expanded atmospheres that expose a larger surface to the stellar irradiation. We present scaling laws for the heating efficiency and the expansion radius that depend on the gravitational potential and irradiation level of the planet. The resulting revised energy-limited escape concept can be used to derive estimates for the mass-loss rates of super-Earth-sized planets as well as massive hot Jupiters with hydrogen-dominated atmospheres.

5|$|The main ovals are the {{dominant}} {{part of the}} Jovian aurorae. They have stable shapes and locations, but their intensities are strongly modulated by the solar wind pressure—the stronger solar wind, the weaker the aurorae. As mentioned above, the main ovals are maintained by the strong influx of electrons accelerated by the electric potential drops between the magnetodisk plasma and the Jovian ionosphere. These electrons carry field aligned currents, which maintain the plasma's co-rotation in the magnetodisk. The potential drops develop because the sparse plasma outside the equatorial sheet can only carry a current of a limited strength without those currents. The precipitating electrons have energy in the range 10–100keV and penetrate deep into the atmosphere of Jupiter, where they ionize and excite molecular hydrogen causing ultraviolet emission. The total energy input into the ionosphere is 10–100TW. In addition, the currents flowing in the ionosphere heats it by the process known as Joule heating. This heating, which produces up to 300TW of power, {{is responsible for the}} strong infrared radiation from the Jovian aurorae and partially for the heating of the <b>thermosphere</b> of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Venus has an {{extended}} ionosphere located at altitudes 120–300km. The ionosphere almost {{coincides with the}} <b>thermosphere.</b> The high levels of the ionization are maintained only over the dayside of the planet. Over the nightside the concentration of the electrons is almost zero. The ionosphere of Venus consists of three layers: v1 between 120 and 130km, v2 between 140 and 160km and v3 between 200 and 250km. There may be an additional layer near 180km. The maximum electron volume density (number of electrons in a unit of volume) 3m−3 is reached in the v2 layer near the subsolar point. The upper boundary of the ionosphere—ionopause is located at altitudes 220–375km and separates the plasma of the planetary origin {{from that of the}} induced magnetosphere. The main ionic species in the v1 and v2 layers is O2+ ion, whereas the v3 layer consists of O+ ions. The ionospheric plasma is observed to be in motion; solar photoionization on the dayside, and ion recombination on the nightside, are the processes mainly responsible for accelerating the plasma to the observed velocities. The plasma flow appears to be sufficient to maintain the nightside ionosphere at or near the observed median level of ion densities.|$|E
25|$|The {{stratosphere}} is {{the middle}} layer of the Uranian atmosphere, in which temperature generally increases with altitude from 53K in the tropopause to between 800 and 850K at the base <b>thermosphere.</b> The heating of the stratosphere {{is caused by the}} downward heat conduction from the hot <b>thermosphere</b> as well as by absorption of solar UV and IR radiation by methane and the complex hydrocarbons formed as a result of methane photolysis. The methane enters the stratosphere through the cold tropopause, where its mixing ratio relative to molecular hydrogen is about 3, three times below saturation. It decreases further to about 10−7 at the altitude corresponding to pressure of 0.1mbar.|$|E
30|$|Terrestrial planets may evolve through phases {{where their}} upper atmospheres are hydrogen-rich. There is some {{evidence}} from planetary formation theories that early Venus once lost its initial H 2 O inventory during an episode of a runaway and/or wet greenhouse effect via thermal and non-thermal atmospheric escape processes {{which could have been}} related to the form of “hydrodynamic” outflow. These extreme conditions may be reached in H-rich primordial <b>thermospheres</b> heated by the strong EUV flux of the young Sun (Sekiya et al., 1980 a, b; Watson et al., 1981; Zahnle and Walker, 1982; Tian et al., 2005).|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{view of the}} low H 2 O {{abundance}} in the present Venusian and Martian atmospheres several observations by spacecraft and studies suggest that both planets should have lost most of their water over the early active period of the young Sun. During the first Gyr after the Sun arrived at the Zero-Age-Main-Sequence high X-ray and EUV fluxes between 10 – 100 {{times that of the}} present Sun were responsible for much higher temperatures in the thermosphere-exosphere environments on both planets. By applying a diffusive-gravitational equilibrium and thermal balance model for investigating radiation impact on the early <b>thermospheres</b> by photodissociation and ionization processes, due to exothermic chemical reactions and cooling by CO 2 IR emission in the 15 µm band we found expanded <b>thermospheres</b> with exobase levels between about 200 (present) to 2000 km (4. 5 Gyr ago). The higher temperatures in the upper atmospheres of both planets could reach “blow-off ” conditions for H atoms even at high CO 2 mixing ratios of 96 %. Lower CO 2 /N 2 mixing ratio or higher contents of H 2 O-vapor in the early atmospheres could have had a dramatic impact from the loss of atmosphere and water on both planets. The duration of this phase of high thermal loss rates essentially depended on the mixing ratios of CO 2, N 2 and H 2 O in the early atmospheres and could have lasted between about 150 to several hundred Myr...|$|R
25|$|The {{outermost}} {{layer of}} the Uranian atmosphere, extending for thousands of kilometres, is the thermosphere/exosphere, which has a uniform temperature of around 800 to 850K. This is much higher than, for instance, the 420K observed in the <b>thermosphere</b> of Saturn. The heat sources necessary to sustain such high temperatures are not understood, since neither solar FUV/EUV radiation nor auroral activity can provide the necessary energy. The weak cooling efficiency due to the depletion of hydrocarbons in the stratosphere may contribute to this phenomenon. In addition to molecular hydrogen, the <b>thermosphere</b> contains {{a large proportion of}} free hydrogen atoms, while helium is thought to be absent here, because it separates diffusively at lower altitudes.|$|E
25|$|Objects in LEO {{encounter}} atmospheric drag from {{gases in}} the <b>thermosphere</b> (approximately 80–500km up) or exosphere (approximately 500km and up), depending on orbit height. Due to atmospheric drag, satellites do not usually orbit below 300km. Objects in LEO, orbit Earth between the denser part of the atmosphere and below the inner Van Allen radiation belt.|$|E
25|$|The {{upper part}} of the <b>thermosphere,</b> where the mean free path of the {{molecules}} exceeds the scale height, is called the exosphere. The lower boundary of the Uranian exosphere, the exobase, is located at a height of about 6,500km, or 1/4 of the planetary radius, above the surface. The exosphere is unusually extended, reaching as far as several Uranian radii from the planet. It is made mainly of hydrogen atoms and is often called the hydrogen corona of Uranus. The high temperature and relatively high pressure {{at the base of the}} <b>thermosphere</b> explain in part why Uranus's exosphere is so vast. The number density of atomic hydrogen in the corona falls slowly with the distance from the planet, remaining as high a few hundred atoms per cm3 at a few radii from Uranus. The effects of this bloated exosphere include a drag on small particles orbiting Uranus, causing a general depletion of dust in the Uranian rings. The infalling dust in turn contaminates the upper atmosphere of the planet.|$|E
30|$|As {{discussed}} in the previous section, dynamically expanded <b>thermospheres</b> and related coronae should form if SXR and EUV fluxes ≥ 5 EUV and light atoms such as hydrogen populate the upper atmosphere, or if no IR-cooling molecules are present. As a consequence the upper atmosphere expands beyond a possible magnetospheric shield and hydrogen energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) are produced via charge exchange collisions between the atmosphere and charged solar/stellar wind particles (Lammer et al., 2011 a, b). As discussed recently by Holmström et al. (2008), Ekenbäck et al. (2010) and Lammer et al. (2011 a) ENAs have been observed around all Solar System planets when a spacecraft was equipped with an accurate instrument.|$|R

DR may produce metastable fragments, which may live long enough to participate in reactions that are not available to ground state species.

Comparison of the neutral <b>thermosphere's</b> zonal velocity (measured by the FPI during twilight and night-time) and the F-region plasma's zonal drift (measured by the ISR throughout the day and night) indicate that at certain times, such as evening twilight, the two motions are not correlated, but that in the late night they are.

40|$|Because {{the solar}} {{radiation}} and particle environment {{plays a major}} role in all atmospheric processes such as ionization, dissociation, heating of the upper atmospheres, and thermal and non-thermal atmospheric loss processes, the long-time evolution of planetary atmospheres and their water inventories can only be understood within the context of the evolving Sun. We compare the effect of solar induced X-ray and EUV (XUV) heating on the upper atmospheres of Earth, Venus and Mars since the time when the Sun arrived at the Zero-Age-Main-Sequence (ZAMS) about 4. 6 Gyr ago. We apply a diffusive-gravitational equilibrium and thermal balance model for studying heating of the early <b>thermospheres</b> by photodissociation and ionization processes, due to exothermic chemical reactions and cooling by IR-radiating molecules like CO 2, NO, OH, etc. Our model simulations result in extended <b>thermospheres</b> for early Earth, Venus and Mars. The exospheric temperatures obtained for all the three planets during this time period lead to diffusion-limited hydrodynamic escape of atomic hydrogen and high Jeans’ escape rates for heavier species like H 2, He, C, N, O, etc. The duration of this blow-off phase for atomic hydrogen depends essentially on the mixing ratios of CO 2, N 2 and H 2 O in the atmospheres and could last from ∼ 100 to several hundred million years. Furthermore, we study the efficiency of various non-thermal atmospheric loss processes on Venus and Mars and investigate the possible protecting effect of the early martian magnetosphere against solar wind induced ion pick up erosion. We find that the early martian magnetic field could decrease the ion-related non-thermal escape rates by a great amount. It is possible that non-magnetized early Mars could have lost its whole atmosphere due to the combined effect of its extended upper atmosphere and a dense solar wind plasma flow of the young Sun during about 200 Myr after the Sun arrived at the ZAMS. Depending on the solar wind parameters, our model simulations for early Venus show that ion pick up by strong solar wind from a non-magnetized planet could erode up to an equivalent amount of ∼ 250 bar of O + ions during the first several hundred million years. This accumulated loss corresponds to an equivalent mass of ∼ 1 terrestrial ocean (TO (1 TO ∼ 1. 39 × 10 24 g or expressed as partial pressure, about 265 bar, which corresponds to ∼ 2900 m average depth)).
