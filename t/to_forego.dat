Angels scout Dan Radcliff and director of scouting Eddie Bane convinced Adenhart <b>to</b> <b>forego</b> a scholarship offer from the University of North Carolina and signed him to a $710,000 bonus ($ in 2010) on July 26, 2004. After having Dr. James Andrews perform the Tommy John surgery, Adenhart spent the next year rehabilitating his elbow at the Angels' rehab facility in Tempe, Arizona. During that time, Adenhart also attended classes at Arizona State University.|$|E
5|$|Convinced of his ability, the Winterhawks persuaded Johansen <b>to</b> <b>forego</b> {{university}} and join their club for the 2009–10 WHL season. In Portland, {{he joined a}} line with fellow 2010 NHL Entry Draft prospects Nino Niederreiter and Brad Ross. He finished the year with 25 goals and 69 points in 71 games, second among league rookies behind Kevin Connauton and second in team scoring, behind Chris Francis. Helping the Winterhawks make the playoffs one year after finishing last in the WHL, they advanced to the second round. Johansen added 18 points in 13 games, ninth in league scoring and first among rookies, despite playing in only two of four playoff rounds.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{prominent}} {{position in}} the party, Harper's relationship with the Reform Party leadership was frequently strained. In early 1994, he criticized a party decision to establish a personal expense account for Manning {{at a time when}} other Reform MPs had been asked <b>to</b> <b>forego</b> parliamentary perquisites. He was formally rebuked by the Reform executive council despite winning support from some MPs. His relationship with Manning grew increasingly fractious in the mid-1990s, and he pointedly declined to express any opinion on Manning's leadership during a 1996 interview. This friction was indicative of a fundamental divide between the two men: Harper was strongly committed to conservative principles and opposed Manning's inclinations toward populism, which Harper saw as leading to compromise on core ideological matters.|$|E

5|$|Dino Crisis {{utilizes}} {{an original}} 3D engine with real-time environments, {{as opposed to}} the pre-rendered backgrounds of the Resident Evil series. Mikami chose a real-time engine to enable better cinematic action and more dramatic character depictions that would otherwise be impossible. However, with the real-time engine came the challenge of hardware limitations, making it difficult for the team to create detailed environments. The team had <b>to</b> <b>forego</b> a jungle scene because of this issue. Mikami did however believe the team was able to create sufficiently detailed environments despite the hardware's polygon limitations. Like Resident Evil, the game takes place indoors in an enclosed environment. Mikami wanted to keep the claustrophobic feelings, thinking it was better to build fear.|$|E
5|$|In May 1906, {{while still}} serving his ban, Meredith moved to Manchester United. He joined on a free {{transfer}} {{and received a}} £500 signing-on fee from United; Manchester City reluctantly accepted the transfer as they had previously signed an undertaking promising Meredith a benefit match, and he was willing <b>to</b> <b>forego</b> on the agreement if the club instead granted his transfer. He returned from suspension on 1 January 1907, and marked his debut at Bank Street with an assist for Sandy Turnbull to score the only goal of the game against Aston Villa. In addition to Turnbull, Meredith was joined at United by former City teammates Jimmy Bannister and Herbert Burgess. This new forward line made the team into a powerful force, as they already possessed a dominant half-back line in captain Charlie Roberts, Dick Duckworth and Alex Bell. They ended the 1906–07 season in eighth place in the First Division.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the {{negotiations}} continued, with Hall prominent. During informal discussions following the 1975 state election, Millhouse {{had been offered}} the deputy leadership in a merged party, and Cameron {{a leading role in}} the upper house, but following the poor showing at the federal election and the deteriorating financial state of the LM, the offer was reduced and the posts that had been offered to Millhouse and Cameron were no longer available. However, Hall was still able to negotiate for the LM President and Treasurer to be given positions on a new executive. He also agreed <b>to</b> <b>forego</b> any further senate bids. An agreement was put in place to protect Boundy from being ousted at a pre-selection of the new party, but this was broken at the next election. The LM was also given an equal voting share on pre-selection committees for three urban lower house seats.|$|E

30|$|Further on, the {{computed}} {{effect is}} small in scope. For firms with low skill needs it indicates an average {{increase in the}} probability of CVT provision of roughly 0.4 percentage points when turnover rates drop by one percentage point. Thus, {{only a minority of}} firms seems <b>to</b> actually <b>forego</b> CVT because of high turnover. In line with this, fewer than 7 % of non-CVT firms’ representatives said that turnover was a reason for their firms’ CVT abstinence. This makes turnover the least important out of eight potential reasons given in the survey questionnaire.|$|R

5|$|The Sci-Fi Dine-In {{is modeled}} after a 1950s {{drive-in}} theater. The entrance {{is made to}} look like a box office, and guests can walk from there along a tall fence to the dining room, where they sit at formica countertops in booths {{made to look like}} convertibles from the 1940s and 1950s. These booths were designed by Walt Disney Imagineering and are made of fiberglass with much chrome plating. The cars have whitewall tires, and speakers are mounted on poles next to each car. The license plates are dated from 1955, and each convertible seats four people, although these mock vehicles were initially six-seaters when the restaurant first opened. There are six picnic tables near {{the back of the room}} that are only used when the rest of the restaurant is full and there are guests who are willing <b>to</b> <b>forego</b> the experience of sitting in the cars. All guests who make reservations are seated in the cars, although this was not the case the year the restaurant first opened. The restaurant has a total seating capacity of 260.|$|E

40|$|The optimal public insurance-taxation {{scheme is}} derived for a model with unobservable outcomes. If the {{government}} can only observe aggregate commodity expenditures, reimbursement insurance is constrained-efficient. However, two distortions accompany. First, consumers are induced <b>to</b> take (<b>forego)</b> actions which increase (decrease) the likelihood of adverse outcomes (moral hazard). Second, reimbursement insurance creates a subsidy distortion. Moral hazard calls for taxation (subsidization) of commodities which increase (decrease) the probability of adverse outcomes. The second calls for taxation (subsidization) of commodities which are complements to (substitutes for) the insured commodity. An example centered on cigarettes and medical insurance is presented. ...|$|R

25|$|This {{incident}} caused Alexander Borodyansky and Alexander Stefanovich {{to write}} an autobiographical scenario for the film using the dramatic situation in the singer's life, characterising her loss of voice with an opening of her soul.

After having seen the new rewritten scenario and new songs, written in a completely new style, Rotaru agreed to star in the movie and decided <b>to</b> temporarily <b>forego</b> all concert performances.

60|$|Although the {{exterior}} of the cottage was humble and unpretentious, and in keeping with the wildness of the landscape, its interior gave evidence of the cultivation and refinement of its inmates. An aquarium, containing goldfishes, stood on a marble centre-table {{at one end of the}} apartment, while a magnificent grand piano occupied the other. The floor was covered with a yielding tapestry carpet, and the walls were adorned with paintings from the pencils of Van Dyke, Rubens, Tintoretto, Michael Angelo, and the productions of the more modern Turner, Kensett, Church, and Bierstadt.

50|$|When a non-addict takes a drug or {{performs}} a behavior {{for the first}} time he/she does not automatically become an addict. Over time the non-addict chooses to continue to engage in a behavior or ingest a substance because of the pleasure the non-addict receives.

The change from non-addict to addict occurs largely from the effects of prolonged substance use and behavior activities on brain functioning.
