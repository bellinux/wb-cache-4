500|$|In {{his review}} for Salon magazine, Andrew O'Hehir wrote, [...] "What Soderbergh {{has sought to}} capture here is a grand process of birth and extinguishment, one that {{produced}} a complicated legacy in which John McCain, Barack Obama, and Raúl Castro are still enmeshed. There {{will be plenty of}} time to argue about the film's (or films') political relevance or lack thereof, to call Soderbergh names for this or that historical omission, for this or that ideological error. He's made something that people will be eager to see and eager to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> over the world, something that feels strangely urgent, something messy and unfinished and amazing".|$|E
500|$|In 1994, Conran {{set up a}} bluescreen in {{his living}} room and began {{assembling}} the tools he would need to create his movie. He was not interested in working his way through the system and instead wanted to follow the route of independent filmmakers like Steven Soderbergh. Initially, Kerry and his brother had nothing more than [...] "just a vague idea of this guy who flew a plane. We would <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> the obvious things like Indiana Jones and all the stuff we liked." [...] Conran spent four years making a black and white teaser trailer in the style of an old-fashioned movie serial on his Macintosh IIci personal computer. Once he was finished, Conran showed it to producer Marsha Oglesby, who was a friend of his brother's wife and she recommended that he let producer Jon Avnet see it. Conran met Avnet and showed him the trailer. Conran told him that he wanted to make it into a movie. They spent two or three days just talking about the tone of the movie.|$|E
500|$|Peter Bradshaw, in {{his review}} for The Guardian, wrote, [...] "Perhaps it will even come {{to be seen as}} this director's flawed masterpiece: enthralling but {{structurally}} fractured—the second half is much clearer and more sure-footed than the first—and at times frustratingly reticent, unwilling to attempt any insight into Che's interior world". In his less favorable review for Esquire, Stephen Garrett criticized the film for failing to show Guevara's negative aspects, [...] "the absence of darker, more contradictory revelations of his nature leaves Che bereft of complexity. All that remains is a South American superman: uncomplex, pure of heart, defiantly pious and boring". Richard Corliss had problems with Del Toro's portrayal of Guevara: [...] "Del Toro—whose acting style often starts over the top and soars from there, like a hang-glider leaping from a skyscraper roof—is muted, yielding few emotional revelations, seemingly sedated here ... Che is defined less by his rigorous fighting skills and seductive intellect than by his asthma". In his review for Salon.com, Andrew O'Hehir praised Soderbergh for making [...] "something that people will be eager to see and eager to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> over the world, something that feels strangely urgent, something messy and unfinished and amazing. I'd be surprised if Che doesn't win the Palme d'Or ... but be that as it may, nobody who saw it here will ever forget it".|$|E

2500|$|Hillary Busis of Entertainment Weekly {{gave it a}} great review, saying [...] "I mean. How am I {{supposed}} to discuss Once's two-hour finale -- an epic, fantastical take on Back to the Future complete with far-off places, daring sword fights, magic spells, and a princess in disguise -- when all I can <b>talk</b> <b>about,</b> <b>all</b> I can think about, is that final shot, which may just be the most surprising {{moment in the history}} of OUAT?" ...|$|E
2500|$|As of the Rogers-produced Hockey Night, Coach's Corner was noticeably shortened, from {{as long as}} 10 {{minutes to}} as short as 5—a change that was lampshaded by both Cherry and MacLean during their first segment of the new season. The {{following}} Monday, Scott Moore had a short discussion with Cherry regarding the matter, laughing it off and explaining that [...] "if you have more to <b>talk</b> <b>about,</b> <b>all</b> {{you need to do}} is make sure you tell the executive producer what you want to talk about and we'll make sure you have lots of time." ...|$|E
2500|$|As well, the hip hop music {{community}} {{has been criticized for}} its homophobia and transphobia. Hip hop song lyrics contain offensive, homophobic slurs (most popularly, the pejorative term [...] "faggot") and sometimes violent threats towards queer people, such as rapper DMX's [...] "Where the Hood At," [...] rapper Eazy-E's [...] "Nobody Move," [...] rap group Brand Nubian's [...] "Punks Jump Up to Get Beat Down". Many rappers and hip hop artists have advocated homophobia and/or transphobia. These artists include Ja Rule, who in an interview claimed,"We need to go step to MTV and Viacom, and let's <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> these fucking shows that they have on MTV that is promoting homosexuality, that my kids can’t watch this shit," [...] and rap artist Erick Sermon, who has said publicly," [...] will never accept transgender rappers." [...] Until the 2010s, hip hop music has excluded the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community. This has perpetuated a culture in hip hop that is prejudiced towards queer and trans people, making it a tough culture for queer artists to participate in. Despite this prejudice, some queer/genderqueer rappers and hip hop artists have become successful and popular in the 2010s. One of the more notable members of the LGBT community in hip hop is Frank Ocean, who came out in 2012 and has released critically acclaimed albums and won two Grammy Awards. Other successful queer hip hop/rap artists include female bisexual rapper Azealia Banks, pansexual androgynous rapper and singer Angel Haze, lesbian rapper Siya, and genderqueer rapper Mykki Blanco.|$|E
