Specifically, heat transfer pads {{were placed on the}} hottest components of the electronics boards to provide a conductive <b>thermal</b> <b>path</b> for heat transfer. In atmosphere, the electronics can cool convectively, but operation in vacuum requires cooling via conduction and hence an improved conductive path. Additionally, a small aperture made of tungsten was attached {{to the front of the}} detector to reduce the likelihood of photon saturation and limit the field of view to ±4º. Finally, an additional beryllium filter was mounted in front of the detector to reduce the number of photoelectrons reaching the detector.|$|E

50|$|The current {{focus in}} R&D is on cost reduction, {{increase}} of power density, increase of reliability and reduction of parasitic lumped elements. These parasitics are unwanted capacitances between circuit parts and inductances of circuit traces. Both can have {{negative effects on}} the electromagnetic radiation (EMR) of the module if it is operated as an inverter, for instance. Another problem connected to parasitics is their {{negative impact on the}} switching behavior and the switching loss of the power semiconductors. Therefore, manufacturers work on minimizing the parasitic elements of their modules while keeping cost low and maintain a high degree of interchangeability of their modules with those of a second source (other manufacturer).A further aspect for optimization is the so-called <b>thermal</b> <b>path</b> between the heat source (the dies) and the heat-sink. The heat has to pass through different physical layers as solder, DCB, baseplate, thermal interface material (TIM) and the bulk of the heat-sink, until it is transferred to a gaseous medium as air or a fluid medium as water or oil. Since modern silicon-carbide power semiconductors show a larger power density, the requirements for heat transfer are rising.|$|E
50|$|The metal traces {{shown in}} the figure for {{conducting}} electric current into the thermal bump {{may or may not}} be directly connected to the circuitry of the chip. In the case where there are electrical connections to the chip circuitry, on-board temperature sensors and driver circuitry can be used to control the thermal bump in a closed loop fashion to maintain optimal performance. Second, the heat that is pumped by the thermal bump and the additional heat created by the thermal bump in the course of pumping that heat will need to be rejected into the substrate or board. Since the performance of the thermal bump can be improved by providing a good <b>thermal</b> <b>path</b> for the rejected heat, it is beneficial to provide high thermally conductive pathways on the backside of the thermal bump. The substrate could be a highly conductive ceramic substrate like AlN or a metal (e.g., Cu, CuW, CuMo, etc.) with a dielectric. In this case, the high thermal conductance of the substrate will act as a natural pathway for the rejected heat. The substrate might also be a multilayer substrate like a printed wiring board (PWB) designed to provide a high-density interconnect. In this case, the thermal conductivity of the PWB may be relatively poor, so adding thermal vias (e.g. metal plugs) can provide excellent pathways for the rejected heat.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} a thermal design approach to increase thermal control system performance and decrease reliance on system resources, e. g., mass. Thermal design optimization has lagged other subsystems because the thermal subsystem is not thought to significantly drive performance or resource consumption. However, there are factors present in many spacecraft systems that invalidate this assumption. Traditional thermal design methods include point designs where experts make key component selection and sizing decisions. Thermal design optimization literature primarily focuses on optimization {{of the components}} in isolation {{from other parts of}} the thermal control system, restricting the design space considered. The collective thermal design optimization process formulates the <b>thermal</b> <b>path</b> design process as an optimization problem where the design variables are updated for each candidate design. Parametric model(s) within the optimizer predict the performance and properties of candidate designs. The <b>thermal</b> <b>path</b> parameterization captures the component interactions with each other, the system, and the space environment, and is critical to preserving the full design space. The optimal design is a <b>thermal</b> <b>path</b> with higher performance and decreased resource consumption compared to traditional thermal design methods. The REgolith X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (REXIS) payload instrument serves as a case study to demonstrate the collective thermal design optimization process. First, a preliminary thermal control system model of a point design is used to determine the critical <b>thermal</b> <b>path</b> within REXIS: the thermal strap and radiator assembly. The collective thermal design optimization process is implemented on the thermal strap and radiator <b>thermal</b> <b>path.</b> Mass minimization is the objective and the REXIS detector operational temperature is a constraint to the optimization. This approach offers a 37 % reduction in mass of the thermal strap and radiator assembly over a component-level optimization method. by Kevin Dale Stout. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Knowledge of {{instantaneous}} {{junction temperature}} {{is essential for}} effective health management of power converters, enabling safe operation of the power semiconductors under all operating conditions. Methods based on fixed thermal models are typically unable to compensate for degradation of the <b>thermal</b> <b>path</b> resulting from aging {{and the effect of}} variable cooling conditions. Thermosensitive electrical parameters (TSEPs), on the other hand, can give an estimate of junction temperature TJ, but measurement inaccuracies and the masking effect of varying operating conditions can corrupt the estimate. This paper presents a robust and noninvasive real-time estimate of junction temperature that can provide enhanced accuracy under all operating and cooling conditions when compared to model-based or TSEP-based methods alone. The proposed method uses a Kalman filter to fuse the advantages of model-based estimates and an online measurement of TSEPs. Junction temperature measurements are obtained from an online measurement of the on-state voltage, VCE(ON), at high current and processed by a Kalman filter, which implements a predict-correct mechanism to generate an adaptive estimate of TJ. It is shown that the residual signal from the Kalman filter may be used to detect changes in thermal model parameters, thus allowing the assessment of <b>thermal</b> <b>path</b> degradation.

40|$|Non-cubic materials, when {{structurally}} aligned, possess sufficient anisotropy {{to exhibit}} thermoelectric effects where the electrical and <b>thermal</b> <b>paths</b> can be orthogonal due to off-diagonal thermoelectricity (ODTE).

The correlation is unexpected in its universality and unfavorable in its consequences for applications in DTE and ODTE. A standard model suggests that conduction by carriers of both signs occurs in these polymers, which thus leads to reduced thermoelectric efficiency. They also discuss polyacetylene (which is not air-stable), where this ambipolar conduction does not occur, and where properties seem more favorable for thermoelectricity...|$|R

40|$|Heat {{transfer}} in essence is {{the transport of}} thermal energy along certain paths {{in a similar way}} as fluid motion is the transport of fluid parcels along fluid paths. This similarity admits Lagrangian heat-transfer analyses by the geometry of such 2 ̆ 2 <b>thermal</b> <b>paths</b> 2 ̆ 2 analogous to well-known Lagrangian mixing analyses. Essential to Lagrangian heat-transfer formalisms is the reference state for the convective flux. Existing approaches admit only uniform references. However, for convective heat transfer, a case of great practical relevance, the conductive state that sets in for vanishing fluid motion is the more natural reference. This typically is an inhomogeneous state and thus beyond the existing formalism. The present study closes this gap by its generalisation to non-uniform references and thus substantially strengthens Lagrangian methods for thermal analyses. This ansatz is demonstrated by way of a 2 D case study and offers new fundamental insight into thermal transport that is complementary to the Eulerian picture based on temperature and heat-transfer coefficient...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Thermal {{cracking}} of kerogens and bitumens {{is widely}} accepted {{as the major}} source of natural gas (thermal gas). Decomposition is believed to occur at high temperatures, between 100 and 200 °C in the subsurface and generally above 300 °C in the laboratory. Although there are examples of gas deposits possibly generated at lower temperatures, and reports of gas generation {{over long periods of time}} at 100 °C, robust gas generation below 100 °C under ordinary laboratory conditions is unprecedented. Here we report gas generation under anoxic helium flow at temperatures 300 ° below thermal cracking temperatures. Gas is generated discontinuously, in distinct aperiodic episodes of near equal intensity. In one three-hour episode at 50 °C, six percent of the hydrocarbons (kerogen & bitumen) in a Mississippian marine shale decomposed to gas (C 1 –C 5). The same shale generated 72 % less gas with helium flow containing 10 ppm O 2 and the two gases were compositionally distinct. In sequential isothermal heating cycles (~ 1 hour), nearly five times more gas was generated at 50 °C (57. 4 μg C 1 –C 5 /g rock) than at 350 °C by thermal cracking (12 μg C 1 –C 5 /g rock). The position that natural gas forms only at high temperatures over geologic time is based largely on pyrolysis experiments under oxic conditions and temperatures where low-temperature gas generation could be suppressed. Our results indicate two paths to gas, a high-temperature <b>thermal</b> <b>path,</b> and a low-temperature catalytic path proceeding 300 ° below the <b>thermal</b> <b>path.</b> It redefines the time-temperature dimensions of gas habitats and opens the possibility of gas generation at subsurface temperatures previously thought impossible. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{increased}} {{component density}} of a 3 D System-On-Package (SOP) exacerbates the thermal hotspot problem. A popular choice {{to mitigate the}} thermal issues is thermal vias (t-vias) {{that are used to}} establish <b>thermal</b> <b>paths</b> from the core of an SOP package to the heat sinks. Another major problem with SOP integration is the power supply noise coupling among various mixed signal components constituting the system. In this case, decoupling capacitors (decaps) are inserted to provide the switching currents locally. The goal of our automatic 3 D SOP component placement algorithm is to determine the x/y/z location of each component while minimizing the footprint area under thermal and power supply noise constraints. In general, t-vias and decaps are typically inserted in the white space in the placement, whereas the proximity of the t-vias and decaps to the target components determines their effectiveness. Hence, our component placer considers t-via and decap insertion during the early design stage, where the component location can be flexibly changed. Related experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. I...|$|R
