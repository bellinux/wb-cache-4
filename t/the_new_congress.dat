5|$|<b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>Congress</b> met for a {{few weeks}} in March 1867, then adjourned, leaving the House Committee on the Judiciary behind, charged with {{reporting}} back to the full House whether there were grounds for Johnson to be impeached. This committee duly met, examined the President's bank accounts, and summoned members of the Cabinet to testify.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the first}} pieces of {{legislation}} passed by <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Congress</b> under Gingrich was the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, which subjected members of Congress to the same laws that apply to businesses and their employees, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. As a provision of the Contract with America, the law was symbolic of the new Republican majority's goal to {{remove some of the}} entitlements enjoyed by Congress. The bill received near universal acceptance from the House and Senate and was signed into law on January 23, 1995.|$|E
5|$|Having {{passed his}} exam, Middleton was {{recommended}} for a commission by President Howard Taft in November 1912, but it wasn't {{until after the}} new President, Woodrow Wilson, was sworn in the following March, and <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>congress</b> convened, that the 56 successful candidates were confirmed by the Senate. Their appointment was back-dated to 30 November 1912. During this interim period, Middleton was transferred to Fort Crockett in Galveston, Texas, where he arrived early in 1913.|$|E
50|$|Bolivar asks <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Granadian <b>congress</b> for his {{incorporation}} into the army, and is quickly ascended {{to the rank of}} Brigadier and assigned to a garrison. He then organizes a flash campaign between Tunja and Pamplona, managing the expulsion of the royalist troops from this region. With the royalists in retreat, Bolivar once again addresses <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Granadian <b>congress</b> for authorization to intervene in Venezuela with a voluntary army. In view of the actions Bolivar had executed in favor of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Granadians, <b>the</b> <b>congress</b> grants his request and Bolivar marches into Venezuela.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>New</b> Delhi <b>Congress</b> or Declaration of Delhi was an {{international}} gathering of over 185 judges, lawyers, and law professors from 53 countries {{all over the}} world, united as the International Commission of Jurists {{that took place in}} New Delhi, India in 1959. The theme of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Delhi <b>Congress</b> was [...] "The Rule of Law in a Free Society". The Congress further developed the principles and procedures underlying the Rule of Law as well as defining and clarifying the concept itself.|$|R

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Congress</b> in 1977, Mathias was in line for several potential committee promotions to ranking member. However, Mathias' outspoken criticism of the party in the previous election cycle aroused enmity amongst his colleagues. On the Judiciary Committee, Mathias had the most seniority of any other member except Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who already held another ranking membership on the Armed Services Committee. Only one ranking membership was allowed per senator, so Thurmond resigned his ranking membership on the Armed Services Committee to circumvent Mathias serving as ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. Mathias was also prevented from assuming leadership positions on the Government Operations Committee following a power struggle, and on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights. On the latter subcommittee, Mathias had more seniority than any other member. However, party leaders were uneasy {{with the idea of}} allowing Mathias to team up with liberal Democrat and subcommittee chairman Birch Bayh, and voted instead for William L. Scott as ranking member.|$|E
5|$|Entering the 1922 midterm congressional {{election}} campaign, Harding and the Republicans {{had followed}} through {{on many of}} their campaign promises. But some of the fulfilled pledges, like cutting taxes for the well-off, did not appeal to the electorate. The economy had not returned to normalcy, with unemployment at 11percent, and organized labor angry over {{the outcome of the}} strikes. From 303 Republicans elected to the House in 1920, the new 68th Congress would see that party fall to a 221–213 majority. In the Senate, the Republicans lost eight seats, and had 51 of 96 senators in <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Congress,</b> which Harding did not survive to meet.|$|E
5|$|In the 1994 {{campaign}} season, in {{an effort}} to offer an alternative to Democratic policies and to unite distant wings of the Republican Party, Gingrich and several other Republicans came up with a Contract with America, which laid out ten policies that Republicans promised to bring to a vote on the House floor during the first hundred days of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Congress,</b> if they won the election. The contract was signed by Gingrich and other Republican candidates for the House of Representatives. The contract ranged from issues such as welfare reform, term limits, tougher crime laws, and a balanced budget law, to more specialized legislation such as restrictions on American military participation in United Nations missions.|$|E

5000|$|Bolivia held a {{parliamentary}} election in May 1920, electing a <b>new</b> National <b>Congress</b> (for half the seats of the Deputies and 1/3 the seats of <b>the</b> Senators). <b>The</b> <b>new</b> National <b>Congress</b> {{was supposed to}} start sitting on 6 August but was dissolved on 12 July following a coup-d'état.|$|R
25|$|Even with <b>the</b> <b>new</b> U.S. <b>Congress</b> {{giving him}} {{large sums of}} money, he became largely indebted. In 1790, Congress awarded him a pension of $2,500 a year, which he kept until his death.|$|R
5|$|In the {{lame-duck session}} of 1887, Congress passed the Dawes Act, which allowed the {{president}} to terminate tribal governments, and broke up Indian reservations into homesteads for individual natives. Although the Five Civilized Tribes were exempt from the Act, {{the spirit of the}} law encouraged Weaver and the Boomers to continue their own efforts to open western Indian Territory to white settlement. Weaver reintroduced his Oklahoma bill in <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Congress</b> the following year, but again it stalled in committee. He returned to Iowa for another re-election campaign in September 1888, but the Greenback party had fallen apart, replaced by a new left-wing third party, the Union Labor Party. In Iowa's 6th district, the new party agreed to fuse with Democrats to nominate Weaver, but this time the Republicans were stronger. Their candidate, JohnF. Lacey, was elected with an 828-vote margin. The Union Laborites and their presidential candidate, Alson Streeter, fared poorly nationally as well, and the new party soon dissolved. Weaver returned to Congress for the lame-duck session and once more pushed to organize the Oklahoma Territory. This time he prevailed, as the House voted 147–102 to open the Unassigned Lands to homesteaders. The Senate followed suit and President Cleveland, who was about to leave office, signed the bill into law.|$|E
25|$|Madison {{played a}} central role in <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Congress,</b> while Washington was the {{unanimous}} choice as first president. He was followed by the Virginia Dynasty, including Thomas Jefferson, Madison, and James Monroe, giving the state four of the first five presidents.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{election}} the Congress formed {{a government in}} the Presidency. Thevar had high hopes that <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Congress</b> ministry would revoke the Criminal Tribes Act. But the new Chief minister, C. Rajagopalachari, did not fulfil those hopes.|$|E

25|$|Rufus King (March 24, 1755April 29, 1827) was an American lawyer, politician, and diplomat. He was a {{delegate}} for Massachusetts to the Continental Congress and the Philadelphia Convention {{and was one}} of the signers of the United States Constitution in 1787. After formation of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Congress</b> he represented New York in the United States Senate.

25|$|Despite {{considerable}} congressional resistance, {{presidential and}} popular pressure {{led to a}} November 1993 agreement brokered by the Catholic Church between the administration and Congress. This package of constitutional reforms was approved by popular referendum on 30 January 1994. In August 1994, a new Congress was elected to complete the unexpired term. Controlled by the anti-corruption parties: the populist Guatemalan Republican Front (FRG) headed by Ríos Montt, and the center-right National Advancement Party (PAN), <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Congress</b> began to abandon the corruption that characterized its predecessors.|$|E

His major opponent, former Secretary-General of the United Nations Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, won only 22 percent of the vote. Fujimori's {{supporters}} won comfortable majorities in the legislature. One of the first acts of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>congress</b> was to declare an amnesty for all members of the Peruvian military or police accused or convicted of human rights abuses between 1980 and 1995.|$|E
25|$|The Acta Constitutiva de la Federación of January 31, 1824, and the Federal Constitution of October 4, 1824, {{fixed the}} {{political}} and administrative organization of the United Mexican States after the Mexican War of Independence. In addition, Section XXVIII of Article 50 gave <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Congress</b> {{the right to choose}} where the federal government would be located. This location would then be appropriated as federal land, with the federal government acting as the local authority. The two main candidates to become the capital were Mexico City and Querétaro.|$|E
25|$|Richard {{served as}} a member of the Virginia House of Delegates from 1784 to 1788, 1796, and again from 1799 to 1806. During his second term in the state {{legislature}} he was involved in debates surrounding the ratification of the United States Constitution which he wholeheartedly supported. Following ratification he opposed efforts by Patrick Henry and others to call a second constitutional convention to add a bill of rights, believing the new system should be given a chance to operate before wholesale alterations were made. He also believed that <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>congress</b> could be trusted to add the necessary amendments.|$|E

25|$|When <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Congress</b> {{convened in}} 1935, {{there were only}} twenty-five Republican senators, and Vandenberg {{was one of the}} most {{effective}} opponents of the second New Deal. He voted against most Roosevelt-sponsored measures, notable exceptions being the Banking Act of 1935 and the Social Security Act. He pursued a policy of what he called fiscal responsibility, a balanced budget, states' rights, and reduced taxation. He felt that Franklin Roosevelt had usurped the powers of Congress, and he spoke of the dictatorship of Roosevelt. But at the 1936 Republican National Convention, Vandenberg refused to permit the party to nominate him for Vice President, anticipating Roosevelt's victory that year.|$|E
25|$|The {{membership}} of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Congress</b> was decidedly federalist. In the eleven-state (minus North Carolina and Rhode Island) Senate 20 were Federalist and two Anti-federalist (both from Virginia). The House included 48 Federalists and 11 Anti-federalists (from four states: Massachusetts, New York, South Carolina, and Virginia). On April 6 the House and Senate held a joint meeting {{to count the}} electoral vote. George Washington was unanimously elected the first president, even receiving the electoral vote of ardent anti-federalist Patrick Henry. John Adams of Massachusetts was elected vice president. Both were sworn into office on April 30, 1789. The business of setting up the new government was completed.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Congress</b> Party's {{popular support}} began to wane in the mid-1970s. From 1975, Gandhi's {{government}} grew increasingly more authoritarian and unrest among the opposition grew. On 12June 1975, the High Court of Allahabad declared Indira Gandhi's {{election to the}} Lok Sabha, the lower house of India's parliament, void {{on the grounds of}} electoral malpractice. However, Gandhi rejected calls to resign and announced plans to appeal to the Supreme Court. She moved to restore order by ordering the arrest of most of the opposition participating in the unrest. In response to increasing disorder and lawlessness, Gandhi's cabinet and government recommended that President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed declare a State of Emergency, which he declared on 25June 1975 based on the provisions of Article 352 of the Constitution.|$|E
