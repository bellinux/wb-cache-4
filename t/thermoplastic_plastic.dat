40|$|Wood-plastic {{composite}} (WPC) is {{an environmentally}} progress way of combining recycled plastics and wood flour. The composite typically {{consists of four}} major elements: wood flour, <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>plastics,</b> coupling agent, and lubricant. The physical and mechanical properties of WPCs highly depend on the material formulation, and the optimal material composition is an essential topic of current research. This study investigated the effects of changing material compositions on the physical and mechanical properties of WPCs. The studied WPCs were extruded molding WPCs manufactured using recycled polypropylene (RPP) plastics and wood flour. The study evaluated four parameters: (1) wood flour particle size; (2) coupling agent dosage; (3) lubricant content; and (4) the mass ratio of wood and RPPs. The results showed that using finer wood flour (smaller than 125 pm) can improve the tensile and flexural strength of WPCs, and reduce the swelling due to water adsorption. The optimal concentration of the coupling agent (Maleic Anhydride Polypropylene) and lubricant (Zinc stearate) in WPCs were both 3 %. Adding the proper amount of coupling agent can improve the mechanical properties and significantly reduce the swelling, but over-dosing the lubricant significantly increased swelling and reduced all the mechanical properties of the WPCs. Maintaining wood content at 50 % or less produced the best mechanical properties, and wood content above approximately 50 % resulted in reduction of all physical and mechanical properties of WPCs. The study demonstrated the relationship between moisture adsorption to thickness swelling. Reducing thickness swelling from water adsorption, or reducing the exposure of wood fibers to atmosphere, may also improve all the mechanical performances of WPCs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{demand for}} the {{utilization}} of plastic waste has increased due to the tightening environmental legislation and interest in material recycling. Wood plastic composites are one possible way to recycle thermoplastic materials, as they have desirable material properties for many applications. However, due to technical restrictions and lack of knowledge, the product geometries have been mainly limited to extruded twodimensional profiles. In this work, the development of post-processing and line development methodology for an extruded <b>thermoplastic</b> wood <b>plastic</b> composite is investigated to enable the production of more complex shapes. The aim {{of the work is}} to investigate and recognize the major factors affecting the post-processing of the composite material by utilizing the press forming technique, and to develop a practical prototype line based on these observations and findings. Several experiments are done to investigate the most influential material properties and parameters of one interesting thermoplastic composite material. In this process, the main challenge in acquiring satisfactory quality of a complex product is uniform temperature control of the process and the adhesion properties of the composite material. The results show that the quality of extruded, press-formed <b>thermoplastic</b> wood <b>plastic</b> composite products can be satisfactory and suitable for mass production, if right parameters are selected for the machine construction, and the process temperature is monitored and controlled. It is also shown that the mechanical post-processing stage can decrease material variation and thus improve the quality of the extruded sheets.

The tangential stress component is compressive and tensile on the inner and outer surfaces, respectively. It is the highest on the inner surface. The elastic-plastic solution is performed for the plastic region expanded around the inner and outer surfaces by an analytical formulation and a numerical solution. The solution is also carried out by the finite element method (ANSYS solution). These two solutions give similar results.

40|$|Results are {{presented}} {{from a number}} of fire experiments that were conducted in a room environment to study the fire characteristics of typical residential furnishings and assist in the design of a subsequent phase of a project involving fully furnished room fire experiments. The experiments were conducted in a 16 -m 2 test room (with dimensions 3. 8 m wide 74. 2 m long 72. 4 m high), which had a 1. 571. 5 -m window opening. The furnishings tested included mattresses, bed clothes, bed assemblies, upholstered seating furniture, clothing arrangements, books, plastic audio/video media and storage cases, toys, shoes, and a computer workstation setup. The smoke (gaseous products of combustion) from the room was collected using a hood system in order to measure the heat release rate (HRR) and optical density of the smoke. The test room was instrumented with load cells, heat flux gauges, thermocouples and velocity probes in order to take the following measurements: mass loss, total heat flux on gauge-installed flush with the internal surfaces (floor, walls, and ceiling), temperatures at numerous locations, and gas velocities in the window opening. Twin-size mattresses produced peak HRRs of approximately 3800 kW, and the maximum room temperature was approximately 9800 C. The HRRs of bed assemblies of various sizes and configurations ranged from 1800 kW for a twin-size bed to 6250 kW for a bunk bed. The maximum temperature and heat flux recorded in the experiments were 10710 C and 221 kW/m 2, respectively. Upholstered chairs and sofas had HRRs ranging from 630 kW for an ottoman to 3360 kW for a two-seat sofa. In tests with clothing, toys, shoes, books, a computer workstation, and CD/DVD media, the peak HRRs ranged from 440 kW for a bookcase to 2045 kW for toys. Furnishings containing a large proportion of rigid <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>plastics,</b> such as shoes and media cases, produced very dense smoke even at low HRRs. The effect of parameters such as bed clothes, mattress type, foundation type, bed assembly and chair size, material composition, and fuel package arrangement was evident in the results. Because the room dimensions and wall lining materials remained constant, temperatures were linearly proportional to the peak HRR (and exposure time) until the ventilation limit (approximately 4100 kW) was reached. 9 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
