25|$|Ramtanu Lahiri was {{possibly}} {{the first person}} in that society to discard his sacred thread. He is believed to have done it at Bardhaman in 1851. This daring act of his led to a huge uproar in orthodox society and he was socially boycotted for a long time. That, however, did not daunt him. Another movement <b>that</b> <b>rocked</b> society of the time was the debate for re-marriage of widows first raised by Ramgopal Ghosh and other Derozians in the Bengal Spectator from 1842 onwards, but it was possible that Pandit Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar was behind the scene.|$|E
25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of June 14, the Associated Press reported an explosion <b>that</b> <b>rocked</b> Gaza City. According to Fatah officials, security forces withdrew from their post and blew it up in order to not let Hamas take it over. The security forces afterwards repositioned to another location. Later on June 14, Hamas also {{took control of the}} southern Gaza Strip city Rafah which lies near an already closed border crossing with Egypt, which is monitored by Israeli, Palestinian and European Union security forces. The EU staff had, at that time, already been relocated to the Israeli city of Ashkelon for safety reasons. On June 14, Abbas dissolved the Palestinian-Hamas unity government, on 15 June, Hamas completed the control over Gaza.|$|E
25|$|Foucault was in Tunis {{during the}} anti-government and pro-Palestinian riots <b>that</b> <b>rocked</b> {{the city in}} June 1967, and which {{continued}} for a year. Although {{highly critical of the}} violent, ultra-nationalistic and anti-semitic nature of many protesters, he used his status to try to prevent some of his militant leftist students from being arrested and tortured for their role in the agitation. He hid their printing press in his garden, and tried to testify on their behalf at their trials, but was prevented when the trials became closed-door events. While in Tunis, Foucault continued to write. Inspired by a correspondence with the surrealist artist René Magritte, Foucault started {{to write a book about}} the impressionist artist Eduard Manet, but never completed it.|$|E

25|$|ABC chose Megan McTavish, {{a former}} actress {{who had been}} on the writing team since 1987, to be its new head writer. She was officially {{promoted}} to that position in 1992, with Nixon serving as executive head writer. Stories such as Molly's leukemia, Ceara Connor's (Genie Francis) incest, Mona's lung cancer, and Deconstruction (a story about racism), were all praised in soap opera magazines for their social conscience. Other storylines included the Who Killed Will Cortlandt? mystery, Willow Lake Acres (a both humorous and serious tale about the plight of the elderly in a fraudulent nursing home), and a tornado <b>that</b> <b>rocked</b> Pine Valley. Behr also helped craft a story re-exploring Erica's father, Eric Kane. It was revealed he had faked his own death. In a comical twist, Erica finds him working as a clown in a traveling circus.|$|E
25|$|Notwithstanding these {{technical}} and commercial successes on the Macintosh platform, their systems remained fairly expensive, making them less competitive {{in light of}} the falling costs of components that made IBM PC compatibles cheaper and accelerated their adoption. In 1989, Jean-Louis Gassée had steadfastly refused to lower the profit margins on Mac computers, then there was a component shortage <b>that</b> <b>rocked</b> the exponentially-expanding PC industry that year, forcing Apple USA head Allan Loren to cut prices which dropped Apple's margins. Microsoft Windows 3.0 was released in May 1990, the first iteration of Windows which had a feature set and performance comparable to the significantly costlier Macintosh. Furthermore, Apple had created too many similar models that confused potential buyers; at one point the product lineup was subdivided into Classic, LC, II, Quadra, Performa, and Centris models, with essentially the same computer being sold under a number of different names.|$|E
25|$|As soon as White was arrested, he gave {{back the}} $5,500 he had saved in an {{envelope}} that he kept in his room. He was forced to miss the last few games of the season, {{and at that time}} he was averaging 27.7points per game and was the nation's leading scorer. He was only 77total points from setting the new NCAA single season scoring record. When his career came to an abrupt halt, White had scored 1,435points. On February 19, 1951—the day before his arrest—White was named The Sporting News Player of the Year. The only reason that he was still able to accept the honor was because The Sporting News had already mailed out their newest issue and {{it was too late to}} recall the magazine. Although he had been a Consensus Second Team All-American the year before, and was on track to be named a Consensus First Team All-American (and, probably, the Consensus National Player of the Year) as a senior, the NCAA refused to allow any awards or recognition to be bestowed upon any of the schools, players and coaches found to be involved in the match-fixing scandal <b>that</b> <b>rocked</b> college basketball in the late 1940s into 1951. LIU shut down its entire athletic program from 1951 to 1957 as a result of the scandal.|$|E
