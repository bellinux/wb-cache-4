5|$|According to The Economist, Apollo {{succeeded in}} {{accomplishing}} President Kennedy's goal {{of taking on}} the Soviet Union in the Space Race, and beat it by accomplishing a singular and significant achievement, and thereby showcased {{the superiority of the}} capitalistic, free-market system as represented by the US. The publication noted the irony <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to achieve the goal, the program required the organization of tremendous public resources within a vast, centralized government bureaucracy.|$|E

Magneto declares war on the humans and retrieves his own weapon: Phoenix, the resurrected former X-Man Jean Grey.

5|$|A {{reference}} to the Consolatio made by the Christian theologian Jerome in a consolation letter to Heliodorus of Altino concerning the death of St. Nepotian suggests that the work was heavily based on the Greek philosopher Crantor's ancient work De Luctu ("On Grief"). Paul MacKendrick argues that the general outline for the Consolatio can be deduced based both on the structure used by Servius Sulpicius Rufus in a consolation letter sent to Cicero following Tullia's death, {{as well as the}} structure of Cicero's reply. From what little remains of the work, {{it would appear that the}} piece was addressed to Cicero himself. A novel part of the Consolatio seems to be Cicero's idea that Tullia deserves to be deified as a god. Cicero notes <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> for his plan to work, her assent must both be recognized by the gods, as well as the Roman public. In order to win over the public, he concludes that he will build Tullia a shrine.|$|E

5|$|Administrator Webb {{realized}} <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to keep Apollo costs under control, he had {{to develop}} greater project management skills in his organization, so he recruited Dr. George E. Mueller for a high management job. Mueller accepted, {{on the condition that}} he have a say in NASA reorganization necessary to effectively administer Apollo. Webb then worked with Associate Administrator (later Deputy Administrator) Seamans to reorganize the Office of Manned Space Flight (OMSF). On July 23, 1963, Webb announced Mueller's appointment as Deputy Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, to replace then Associate Administrator D. Brainerd Holmes on his retirement effective September 1. Under Webb's reorganization, the directors of the Manned Spacecraft Center (Gilruth) Marshall Space Flight Center (von Braun) and the Launch Operations Center (Debus) effectively reported to Mueller.|$|E
5|$|After Yoh and {{his friends}} {{overcome}} the ten Patch Tribe members, Hao is awakened as the new Shaman King. He defeats Yoh and all his friends and absorbs their souls. Inside the Great Spirit, Yoh, Ren, Horohoro, Lyserg, and Chocolove battle against Hao using the five legendary spirits: the Spirit of Earth, the Spirit of Thunder, the Spirit of Rain, the Spirit of Fire, and the Spirit of Wind. When former associates of Yoh {{and his friends}} begin appearing in the Great Spirit, it is revealed that the Great Spirit granted Hao's wish for someone to bring back his mother's spirit. With Anna's help, Hao's mother is brought to the Great Spirit. Hao's mother tells him <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to be saved, he must forgive the humans for murdering her. Hao decides to postpone his plan to eradicate humans and to observe how Yoh and his friends will change the world.|$|E
5|$|All of the {{location}} shots were filmed {{at the beginning of}} the production block. Recording for the first series of six episodes began on location in the first half of April 1992 and were mainly filmed in Chelsea within a short distance from the director's home. The stand-up sequences were filmed in the Café Des Artistes on London's Fulham Road, now known as the Valmont Club, and were shot for the benefit of the studio audience, with the intention of reshooting them later for the broadcast version. Robert Bathurst has complained <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to save £5,000, this promised reshoot never materialised. The close ups of Bathurst were filmed in the studio for the second series, with stock footage of the club's audience reused.|$|E

5|$|British philosopher Richard Swinburne {{proposed}} {{a version of}} the Irenaean theodicy based on his libertarian view of free will, a view that one's free actions are not caused by any outside agent. He argued <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> for people to make free moral decisions, they must be aware of the consequences of such decisions. Knowledge of these consequences must be based on experience—Swinburne rejected the idea that God could implant such knowledge, arguing that humans would question its reliability. Swinburne argued that humans must have first hand experience of natural evil {{in order to understand the}} consequences of moral evil and that for God to give humans moral free will, he must allow human suffering. Swinburne conceived Hell as being a separation from God, rejecting the notion of eternal physical punishment, and argued that people who had chosen to reject God throughout their lives would continue to do so after death.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{performs}} a one-man show on Broadway {{so that he}} can be considered for a Tony Award as part of his EGOT quest. His show receives positive reviews, and Tracy is convinced that he will win a Tony, but Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) tells him <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> for him to qualify for the award he must do his one-man show eight times, which worries Tracy, as he is unable to perform anything the same way twice. Despite initial reluctance to help him, Jenna eventually agrees to coach Tracy in the principles of acting, but this leads nowhere, resulting in the two arguing and Jenna telling him he can go on his show and read the phone book for all she cares. At the end of the episode, Tracy does read the phone book at his show, making Jenna very proud of him, and inexplicably drawing high praise from the audience.|$|E
5|$|In the epilogue, Shiva retires to Mount Kailash {{where he}} lives {{the rest of his}} days peacefully, though missing Sati every day. Ganesh, Kali and Kartik become renowned as Gods for their prowess, all over India. They take revenge for Sati's death by wiping out the whole clan of the Egyptian assassins. Bhrigu {{continues}} teaching and collates his knowledge in a book called Bhrigu Samhita. Sati's death is not forgotten and she is later renowned as Goddess Shakti, and her ashes are spread throughout India, in places later known as Shakti Peethas (Seat of Shakti). It is revealed <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to ensure that the Somras is not mass-manufactured again, the course of the Yamuna is turned towards the east, thus drying up the Saraswati River.|$|E

5|$|Kikai {{thought that}} {{work on a}} boat might be photogenic, but, having no experience, {{could not get a}} job on one. He was {{eventually}} accepted on a boat fishing for tuna when he displayed the scar from an unneeded appendectomy as evidence of one risk fewer that his presence might force the boat into port. He worked on the boat in the Pacific from 6 April until 9 November 1972, with a stop in Manzanillo (Mexico) for provisions. It was during this time that he took his first photographs to be published, in the May 1973 issue of Camera Mainichi. In 1973 he won a prize for his submission to the 14th exhibition of the Japan Advertising Photographers’ Association. But Kikai decided <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to be a photographer he needed darkroom skills, and he returned to Tokyo to work at Doi Technical Photo (1973–76). He became a freelance photographer in 1984, a year after his first solo exhibition and the same year as his second.|$|E
5|$|Marcel Pagnol's 1953 film Manon des Sources {{was four}} hours long, and {{subsequently}} cut by its distributor. The end result left Pagnol dissatisfied, {{and led him}} to retell the story as a novel. The {{first part of the}} novel, titled Jean de Florette, was an exploration of the background for the film; a prequel of sorts. Together the two volumes made up the work Pagnol called L'Eau des collines (The Water of the Hills). Berri came across Pagnol's book by chance in a hotel room, and was captivated by it. He decided <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to do the story justice it had to be made in two parts.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, actor Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) is {{nominated}} for a Golden Globe Award {{for his role in}} the drama feature Hard To Watch but realizes <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to win the award he needs to act as a serious actor. As a result, Tracy buys the rights to his new comedy movie, The Chunks 2: A Very Chunky Christmas, in order to block the distribution of the feature and improve his chances at winning the award. Later, Tracy decides to do a charity event by screening Hard To Watch—a story of an inner-city boy living in the ghetto—for a women's shelter. At the charity event, Tracy introduces the movie but decides against showing it, realizing that laughter is the best medicine and instead screens The Chunks 2: A Very Chunky Christmas. The people in the shelter find the movie hilarious thus making Tracy happy.|$|E
