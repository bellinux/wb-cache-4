5|$|In the 21st century, <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> {{has been}} {{dilapidated}} and has required constant repairs to fulfill Health and Safety requirements for Glentoran to host its home matches there. In 2009, Glentoran's Irish Cup match against Limavady United was abandoned after the stadium's floodlight pylons started shaking {{in the high}} winds and the referee deemed it too dangerous for the match to continue. In 2012, after considering selling naming rights to <b>The</b> <b>Oval,</b> Glentoran unveiled plans to move the club to a new stadium in the Titanic Quarter of Belfast. <b>The</b> <b>Oval</b> was sold to property developers in March 2003 for £4million. Glentoran's chairman suggested that <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> might be redeveloped into social housing.|$|E

5|$|From 1882 to 1886, Glentoran used Ormeau Park {{as their}} home ground. They moved to Westbourne in Ballymacarrett {{for six years}} until 1892. They then moved to <b>The</b> <b>Oval.</b> Initially it was on Dee Street, however in 1903 The Oval's pitch was rotated 90 degrees to its current location. During the early 20th century, the land on which <b>The</b> <b>Oval</b> stood was given in {{perpetuity}} to Glentoran by the Lord Mayor of Belfast, Daniel Dixon.|$|E
5|$|In {{previous}} years, <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> {{was used}} to host {{the final of the}} Irish Cup as one of Northern Ireland's biggest stadiums along with Windsor Park, with the location of the final often being decided on a coin toss. During the 1985 Irish Cup final, Glentoran supporters released a cockerel and a pig that had been painted blue onto the pitch to antagonize Linfield supporters. <b>The</b> <b>Oval</b> {{was used to}} host the final of the County Antrim Shield in 2012. <b>The</b> <b>Oval</b> has also been used to host the Setanta Cup final. It hosted the 2012 final between Belfast's Crusaders representing the IFA Premiership, and County Londonderry based Derry City, representing the League of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Sound that {{travels through}} the outer ear {{impacts on the}} eardrum, and causes it to vibrate. The three {{ossicles}} bones transmit this sound to a second window (<b>the</b> <b>oval</b> window) which protects the fluid-filled inner ear. In detail, the pinna of the outer ear helps to focus a sound, which impacts on the eardrum. The malleus rests on the membrane, and receives the vibration. This vibration is transmitted along the incus and stapes to <b>the</b> <b>oval</b> window. Two small muscles, the tensor tympani and stapedius, also help modulate noise. The two muscles reflexively contract to dampen excessive vibrations. Vibration of <b>the</b> <b>oval</b> window causes vibration of the endolymph within the vestibule and the cochlea.|$|E
50|$|The {{determination}} of the 1944 season's fixtures were greatly {{complicated by the fact}} that, although <b>the</b> Western <b>Oval</b> and <b>the</b> Junction <b>Oval</b> were now available to the VFL, the Melbourne Cricket Ground and <b>the</b> Lake <b>Oval</b> were still appropriated for military use and, because of this, Melbourne was sharing <b>the</b> Punt Road <b>Oval</b> with Richmond as its home ground, and South Melbourne was sharing <b>the</b> Junction <b>Oval</b> with St Kilda as its home ground.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Oval</b> is a {{football}} stadium in Belfast, Northern Ireland, {{which has been}} home to Glentoran F.C. since 1892. <b>The</b> <b>Oval</b> was bombed during the Belfast blitz of World War II, and was out of use until 1949 when it was rebuilt by the club along with supporters, who had jointly formed the 'Back to the Oval' committee. During their exile, the club played games at the ground of fellow Belfast club, Distillery - Grosvenor Park. It had a new stand built in 2000 but requires consistent maintenance to fulfill health and safety requirements and its capacity is currently restricted to 6,050. <b>The</b> <b>Oval</b> has occasionally hosted {{the final of the}} Irish Cup as well as hosting the final of the County Antrim Shield and the Setanta Cup.|$|E

5|$|At {{the height}} of the second World War in 1941, <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> – {{including}} terraces, offices, kits and club records – was destroyed in a bombing raid on the nearby Harland & Wolff Shipyard. Glentoran approached Distillery to play at Grosvenor Park, which they did until <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> was rebuilt with help from other clubs, most notably Cliftonville. During this time, Glentoran considered resigning from senior football to become a junior club, but after borrowing kits from Distillery and Crusaders they continued to compete at Grosvenor until 1949. Out of 14 league games at Grosvenor Park however, they were only victorious over Linfield on one occasion.|$|E
