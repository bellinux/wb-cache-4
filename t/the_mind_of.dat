5|$|It {{may be that}} in <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> their self-celebrated Svengali...the Sex Pistols {{were never}} meant {{to be more than a}} nine-month wonder, a cheap vehicle for some fast money, a few laughs, a touch of the old épater la bourgeoisie.

The Sex Pistols were all of these things.|$|E

5|$|Asa Gray {{promoted}} {{and defended}} Origin against those American naturalists with an idealist approach, notably Louis Agassiz who viewed every species {{as a distinct}} fixed unit in <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> the Creator, classifying as species what others considered merely varieties. Edward Drinker Cope and Alpheus Hyatt reconciled this view with evolutionism in a form of neo-Lamarckism involving recapitulation theory.|$|E
5|$|Feeling {{the need}} to seek out truth creates a {{separation}} between <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> a poet and <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> a philosopher. The poem reconciles the two by allowing the pursuer of truth to reflect on his time of simply enjoying nature and God's presence. However, the philosopher aspect is dominant and the individual must {{go out and try}} to help humanity. Nature can be soothing, but the narrator must reject the Edenic quality of nature because such a state is not yet appropriate. The Edenic imagery figures into many of Coleridge's poems and is reinforced with the image of myrtle trees and takes on many forms within his poetry. In Reflections, to dwell in an Edenic state is a paradise in which the narrator leaves voluntarily because he cannot ignore the problems of the world like a coward. Instead, the individual is compelled to join with humanity and even the lowest form of benefiting humanity is superior to doing nothing at all.|$|E

The Bulgarian historian Maria Todorova (Imagining the Balkans, 1997) presented the ethnologic concept of Nesting Balkanisms (Ethnologia Balkanica, 1997), which is derived from Milica Bakić–Hayden's concept of Nesting Orientalisms.|$|E

5|$|Avatar, {{marketed as}} James Cameron's Avatar, is a 2009 American epic science fiction film directed, written, produced, and co-edited by James Cameron, and {{starring}} Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, Michelle Rodriguez, and Sigourney Weaver. The film {{is set in}} the mid-22nd century, when humans are colonizing Pandora, a lush habitable moon of a gas giant in the Alpha Centauri star system, in order to mine the mineral unobtanium, a room-temperature superconductor. The expansion of the mining colony threatens the continued existence of a local tribe of Na'vi– a humanoid species indigenous to Pandora. The film's title refers to a genetically engineered Na'vi body with <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> a remotely located human that is used to interact with the natives of Pandora.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{have noted}} that Narayan's {{writings}} {{tend to be more}} descriptive and less analytical; the objective style, rooted in a detached spirit, providing for a more authentic and realistic narration. His attitude, coupled with his perception of life, provided a unique ability to fuse characters and actions, and an ability to use ordinary events to create a connection in <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> the reader. A significant contributor to his writing style was his creation of Malgudi, a stereotypical small town, where the standard norms of superstition and tradition apply.|$|E

5|$|In the Balkand {{episode of}} the {{marriage}} of the princes of Ayodhya with the princesses of Mithila, Tulsidas presents a metaphor in which the four brides are compared with the four states of consciousness – the waking state (Jagrat), sleep with dreams (Swapna), dreamless sleep (Sushupti) and the fourth self-conscious state (Turiya). The four grooms are compared with the presiding divinity (Vibhu) of the four states – Vishva, Taijasa, Prajna and Brahman. Tulsidas says as the four states of consciousness with their presiding divinities reside in <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> a Jiva, so the four brides with their grooms are resplendent in the same pavilion.|$|E
5|$|Many historians {{maintain}} {{that given the}} massive reductions in US military aid to South Vietnam after 1973, any major PAVN offensive was bound to succeed. However, the ARVN's soldiers were hardened veterans, and South Vietnam maintained vast stockpiles of ammunition and equipment (as demonstrated by the massive quantities of war materiel captured by the PAVN when the war ended). The final collapse of the ARVN {{may well have been}} inevitable, but the end would have been much bloodier and much longer in coming had the PAVN chosen a more direct, conventional plan of attack. In fact, the most damaging blow of the entire PAVN campaign may have been the crushing psychological blow their skillful and unexpected strategy dealt to <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> the ARVN's commander-in-chief.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, chroma dots {{were used}} to restore the colour to Episodes 2–4, 6, and 7 of The Ambassadors of Death and episodes 2–6 of <b>The</b> <b>Mind</b> <b>of</b> Evil.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> William Bell (Leonard Nimoy) still {{possesses}} Olivia's (Anna Torv) body {{after several}} failed attempts to extract it to recently deceased corpses. Walter (John Noble) and William {{believe that they}} have less than a day before Olivia's mind will be lost. They realize that Olivia is unaware that she has been possessed by William's mind, and instead has likely locked her ego away, making it difficult to contact her by normal means. Walter comes up with a plan: he and Peter (Joshua Jackson) will enter Olivia's mind with the aid of LSD to locate her ego and help it to regain dominance in her mind, while Walter hopes to download William's mind into a computer.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{theme of}} the song puts me in <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> a hit from R group Bell Biv Devoe circa 1990 that was also titled Poison, but doesn't fair the {{potential}} to be a number one song like it did close to 20 years ago. Even though the song doesn't seem like it would be a chart topper it does seem album worthy. It's something most can relate to if you've ever been in a relationship. Beyonce sings about a failed relationship that's no good, but yet is so hard to walk away from and ends up being just like Poison.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately, episode 1 of <b>The</b> <b>Mind</b> <b>of</b> Evil {{contains}} no colour information. In principle, BBC engineers {{were supposed to}} filter out the chroma dots upon telerecording, to create a cleaner and nicer picture. In most cases they {{failed to do so}} properly, allowing the colour recovery process to work. For this one episode, the filter had been correctly applied – so there was no colour to recover. To complete the serial for DVD, the episode was manually colourised by Stuart Humphryes and Peter Crocker – thereby returning the final Pertwee episode to its original colour presentation.|$|E

5|$|A lead {{scientist}} for a pharmaceutical company is {{killed by a}} blue powder that turns his bones into dust. The Fringe division traces {{the source of the}} package which contained the powder to a former Marine; when they search his home, Peter (Joshua Jackson) finds the man nearby and gives chase, but the man is hit by a car and knocked into a coma. Broyles (Lance Reddick) fears that there may be others involved in targeted attacks. Walter (John Noble) suggests they read the man's mind to learn of any such plot using the ability of one of his undocumented nootropic Cortexiphan patients, Simon Phillips, (Omid Abtahi). Simon, who is unable to control his telepathic abilities, has isolated himself from the general population for two decades, but finds some comfort in not being able to read <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> Olivia (Anna Torv)—a fellow Cortexiphan patient. Olivia convinces Simon to help them with the ongoing investigation despite the mental anguish he will suffer in a large crowded city such as Boston. During their time together, Olivia explains her concerns over Peter, wondering if he still feels any attraction to her alternate self, Fauxlivia, in the parallel universe. Meanwhile, three military contractors are killed by the release of the compound in an elevator, confirming Broyles' fears.|$|E
5|$|According to the Malayalam Bhagavata Purana, Krishna got {{the name}} Keshava as he slew Keshi. Krishna is {{referred}} to as slayer of Keshi twice in the Bhagavata Gita by Arjuna - Keshava (1.30) and Keshi-nisudana (18.1). In the first chapter (1.30), addressing Krishna as slayer of Keshi, Arjuna expresses his doubts about war, at the same time, finds Krishna capable of destroying them. Here, Keshi represents false pride and the reference as slayer of Keshi by Arjuna expresses his humility. Keshi as a mad horse who created havoc in Gokula - also represents the wild horse of doubts who run in <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> a person. In the last chapter (18.1), Arjuna addresses Krishna as Maha-baho ("mighty-armed") paired with the slayer of Keshi epithet, reminding the reader how Krishna killed Keshi with his arms alone. The Vishnu sahasranama ("The Thousand names of Vishnu") calls Krishna as Keshava (Names 23, 648) and Keshitha (649) - the slayer of Keshi. The fourth century play Mudrarakshasa also interprets the epithet Keshava as the slayer of Keshi. Keshighat is a major bathing ghat along the river Yamuna in Vrindavan, where Krishna is believed to have overpowered Keshi.|$|E
5|$|Before his death, Mr. Nobody {{tells the}} {{journalist}} {{that neither of}} them exist. They are figments in <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> the 9-year-old Nemo at the train station, as {{he was forced to}} make an impossible choice. The young boy tries to find the correct decision, following each choice to its conclusion. Eventually, the boy takes a third option: to not make the choice at all. He leaves both parents and runs away towards an unknown future. This ambiguous choice somehow leads to him and Anna reuniting happily. The film returns to old Nemo on his death bed. The calculated time arrives and Mr. Nobody's last words are watched by the world. The expansion of the universe comes to a halt and time appears to reverse. The universe ceases to dissipate, and finally begins contracting. Consequently, Nemo's life simplifies itself. He is able to return to his childhood, watch his parents get back together and be with Anna. The 118-year-old man cackles triumphantly as he springs back into awareness with the realization that his younger self has finally found his one true love and life.|$|E
