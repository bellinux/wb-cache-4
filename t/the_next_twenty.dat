5|$|By 2005 du Maurier had {{withdrawn}} as a sponsor and, {{along with its}} over-budget renovation costs, the Stanley was left with a $2million mortgage. That year Industrial Alliance Pacific Life Insurance Company made a $1.5million donation, and on April 5 the theatre was renamed the Stanley Industrial Alliance Stage for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>twenty</b> years.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{moved to}} London {{at a young}} age and spent <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>twenty</b> years or so working as a corn porter, loading and {{unloading}} sacks of corn from a wharf near to Old Swan Stairs, (Upper) Thames Street.|$|E
5|$|The convent {{continued}} to be significantly expanded over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>twenty</b> years, and in 1858 the Franciscans purchased a plot of land adjacent to the convent for the erection of a church, rectory and school. This was gifted to the local Bishop, and St George's Church was opened on the site two years later.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> morning <b>twenty</b> {{thousand}} of them marched to Highbury, the great manor-house of which belonged to the Order of St. John, and this and the buildings around it were all destroyed by fire.|$|R
5000|$|The concert also {{marked the}} closing of DFP and MPO's 2012/2013 season. To {{maintain}} the exclusivity of the concert, no form of audio or visual recordings were made upon Siti's own request. She said, [...] "This is my own request and may it become the sweetest memory for the audiences for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> ten, <b>twenty</b> years".|$|R
60|$|He rose noisily, and {{followed}} by Flower entered <b>the</b> <b>next</b> bar. <b>Twenty</b> minutes afterwards Flower bade them all a hearty good-night, and Mr. Green, {{walking back to the}} schooner with Joe, dwelt complacently on the advantages of possessing a style and address which had enabled them to exchange the rudeness of Ben for the appreciative amiability of Captain Fraser.|$|R
5|$|After her naval service {{ended in}} 1919, she was {{returned}} to her original owners and resumed relatively uneventful cargo service over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>twenty</b> years. Early in World War II, the ship was requisitioned by the War Shipping Administration, and shipped cargo on New York– Caribbean routes and transatlantic routes. In mid-July 1944, Pennsylvanian was scuttled {{as part of the}} breakwater for one of the Mulberry artificial harbors built to support the Normandy Invasion.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the Russos' studies found similar risk rates between virgin and {{pregnancy}} interrupted rats, their research would be used to support the contention that abortion created a greater risk of breast cancer for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>twenty</b> years. However, because rats do not exhibit naturally occurring breast cancer, the extrapolation of these results to human abortion and breast cancer is viewed as dubious.|$|E
5|$|The {{first showing}} of {{films in the}} Dutch East Indies was in 1900, and over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>twenty</b> years foreign productions– {{generally}} from the United States– were imported and shown throughout the country. Domestic production of documentaries had begun in 1911 but were unable to compete with imported works. By 1923 a local feature film production spearheaded by the Middle East Film Co. was announced, but the work was not completed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Some day they'll {{have to pass}} {{some more}} laws, {{protecting}} game," [...] was Shep's comment. [...] "If they don't, there won't be anything to shoot inside of <b>the</b> <b>next</b> fifteen or <b>twenty</b> years." ...|$|R
50|$|Over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> {{four and}} <b>twenty</b> hours {{maturation}} occurs. The less stable calcium polyacrylate chains are progressively replaced by aluminum polyacrylate, allowing the calcium {{to join the}} fluoride and phosphate and diffuse into the tooth substrate, forming polysalts, which progressively hydrate to yield a physically stronger matrix.|$|R
60|$|Then we sat {{ourselves}} down {{to partake}} of food {{for the first time}} since leaving the encampment, and I noted with no little anxiety that if we continued to have such appetites during <b>the</b> <b>next</b> four and <b>twenty</b> hours, our store of food would be sadly diminished.|$|R
5|$|As {{noted by}} a {{historical}} marker {{on the large}} hill in Central Campus, the site occupied by the school's first buildings once held fortifications built to protect Atlanta during the Atlanta Campaign of the American Civil War. The surrender of the city {{took place on the}} southwestern boundary of the modern Georgia Tech campus in 1864. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>twenty</b> years were a time of rapid industrial expansion; during this period, Georgia's manufacturing capital, railroad track mileage, and property values would each increase by a factor of three to four.|$|E
5|$|Before {{joining the}} Football League, Arsenal played briefly on Plumstead Common, {{then at the}} Manor Ground in Plumstead, then spent three years between 1890 and 1893 at the nearby Invicta Ground. Upon joining the Football League in 1893, the club {{returned}} to the Manor Ground and installed stands and terracing, upgrading it from just a field. Arsenal continued to play their home games there for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>twenty</b> years (with two exceptions in the 1894–95 season), until the move to north London in 1913.|$|E
5|$|The African {{art museum}} took a {{scholarly}} direction over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>twenty</b> years, with less social programming. It collected traditional and contemporary works of historical importance. Exhibitions include works {{both internal and}} borrowed, and have ranged from solo artist to broad, survey shows. The museum hosts two to three temporary exhibitions and ten special events annually. Reviewers criticized the National Mall building's architecture, particularly its lack of natural light. The museum is scheduled for remodeling {{as part of the}} Smithsonian's upcoming South Mall project.|$|E
60|$|To {{all of this}} Hiram agreed as if {{satisfied}} {{in every}} particular, and then claimed to be prodigiously hungry, which was another surprise on his part, for we had even then with us enough of provision to satisfy all our desires during <b>the</b> <b>next</b> four and <b>twenty</b> hours.|$|R
5000|$|When Santana {{prepared}} to record his follow-up to Supernatural, {{he sought to}} collaborate with Thomas again. Instead of providing vocals, Thomas wrote two songs for the album, which were recorded by Seal and Musiq [...] Thomas provided songs to other artists as well. Willie Nelson recorded three of Thomass songs on his 2002 album The Great Divide. One of those, [...] "Recollection Phoenix", had been in contention for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> Matchbox <b>Twenty</b> album before the other band members had decided it wasnt a good fit.|$|R
60|$|In the {{meanwhile}} I derived some consolation {{from the}} thought that at any rate for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> four and <b>twenty</b> hours the lovely creature would be safe. No news of the arrest of Aristide Fournier could possibly reach the lonely house until I myself could return thither and take her under my protection.|$|R
5|$|The Democrats' success {{continued}} down the ballot. Meehan {{did not run}} for re-election, and the race for county sheriff pitted two incumbent city councilmen against {{each other for the}} job: Democrat William M. Lennox and Republican Cornelius S. Deegan, Jr. The office of sheriff was another holdover county office. The sheriff, whose job differed from that of the chief of police, was the chief law enforcement officer of the court. Lennox came out ahead, and would hold the job for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>twenty</b> years.|$|E
5|$|The next year, Dow met {{his future}} wife, Maria Cornelia Maynard, the {{daughter}} of a Massachusetts merchant. They married on January 20, 1830. Over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>twenty</b> years, they had nine children, five of whom (two sons and three daughters) survived infancy. Maria Cornelia was a Congregationalist, and Dow attended services with her at Second Parish Church regularly, although he never became a member. Their home, built at 714 Congress Street in Portland in 1829, still stands and is now a museum memorializing Dow's life and administered by the local chapter of the Women's Christian Temperance Union.|$|E
5|$|During the war Vaughan Williams stopped writing music, {{and after}} {{returning}} to civilian life he took some time before feeling ready to compose new works. He revised some earlier pieces, and {{turned his attention to}} other musical activities. In 1919 he accepted an invitation from Hugh Allen, who had succeeded Parry as director, to teach composition at the RCM; he remained on the faculty of the college for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>twenty</b> years. In 1921 he succeeded Allen as conductor of the Bach Choir, London. It was not until 1922 that he produced a major new composition, A Pastoral Symphony; the work was given its first performance in London in May conducted by Adrian Boult and its American premiere in New York in December conducted by the composer.|$|E
60|$|Confusion and dismay reigned in Dublin. The French Marshal, De Rosen, {{advised that}} Dublin and Drogheda should be abandoned, {{and that the}} Irish army should be {{concentrated}} at Athlone and Limerick; but Tyrconnell went to Drogheda, where the council of war was sitting, and strenuously opposed this, promising that by <b>the</b> <b>next</b> night <b>twenty</b> thousand men should be assembled there. Expresses were sent out in all directions; and by forced marches, the Irish troops stationed in Munster directed their course to Drogheda, in high spirits and anxious to meet the enemy.|$|R
6000|$|... "How you stand, man?" [...] ejaculated Colonel Harris with {{uncontrolled}} vehemence. [...] "Great Heavens, don't {{you realize}} that here is some damned conspiracy as mysterious as it is damnable, and {{that you will have}} to look this seriously in the face, if you don't wish to find yourself in the dock before <b>the</b> <b>next</b> four and <b>twenty</b> hours?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... 1981 The Festival {{expanded}} its location to encompass, over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> six years, <b>twenty</b> downtown blocks including nine performing stages, 350 fine craft artists, an outdoor sculpture exhibition {{along the banks}} of the Buffalo Bayou, and the involvement of all major arts organizations. (Houston Symphony, Houston Grand Opera, Houston Ballet, and The Alley Theatre) And all of this was free to the public.|$|R
5|$|Feth-i Bülend saw action {{during the}} Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, where she battled the Russian steamer Vesta in an {{inconclusive}} engagement. The Ottoman fleet was laid up {{for most of}} <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>twenty</b> years, and Feth-i Bülend saw no activity during this period. Modernized in 1890, she was nevertheless still not in condition for active service at {{the outbreak of the}} Greco-Turkish War in 1897. She was therefore heavily rebuilt in Germany between 1903 and 1907. At the start of the First Balkan War in 1912, the ship was stationed in Thessaloniki; the ship was disarmed so the guns could be used to strengthen the port's fortifications. On the night of 31 October, a Greek torpedo boat slipped into the harbor and sank Feth-i Bülend, killing seven of her crew.|$|E
5|$|It {{was at this}} battle, {{regardless}} of exactly when and where this occurred, that a defining moment of Epaminondas's early life would happen. Epaminondas saved the life of his fellow Theban Pelopidas; Pelopidas, after receiving seven wounds in front, sank down upon a great heap of friends and enemies who lay dead together; but Epaminondas, although he thought him lifeless, stood forth to defend his body and his arms, and fought desperately, single-handed against many, determined to die rather than leave Pelopidas lying there. And now he too was in a sorry plight, having been wounded in the breast with a spear and in the arm with a sword, when Agesipolis the Spartan king came to his aid from the other wing, and when all hope was lost, saved them both. Plutarch says that this incident firmly cemented their friendship, and Pelopidas would be Epaminondas's partner in politics for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>twenty</b> years.|$|E
5|$|The elder Roddenberry {{became a}} patrolman, and held that rank for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>twenty</b> years. The family {{expanded}} {{with the birth}} of Robert Leon Roddenberry in 1924, and Doris Willodean Roddenberry in 1925. During this time, the Roddenberrys bought their first home at 3243 Drew Street. During Gene's early years, he was saved by a quick thinking milkman who noticed that the house was on fire. He pounded on the door until Glen awoke and rushed out of the house with the children in tow. Roddenberry's father kept rabbits, and the children sold them outside the house. It was these animals that became the subject of Roddenberry's first published work in his school's twice-yearly newspaper, The Ace. During his childhood, Roddenberry was interested in reading, especially pulp magazines, and was a fan of stories such as John Carter of Mars, Tarzan, and the Skylark series by E. E. Smith.|$|E
60|$|With a good-natured shrug of the {{shoulders}} the imperturbable Sir Percy turned to go, {{but just before}} he did so, he took {{a scrap of paper}} from his waistcoat pocket, and slipped it between Chauvelin's trembling fingers. On the paper were scribbled the four lines of verse which in <b>the</b> <b>next</b> four and <b>twenty</b> hours Robespierre himself and his colleagues would read.|$|R
6000|$|... "Abduction!" [...] I retorted, flaring up in righteous indignation. [...] "Who {{dares to}} use the word in {{connexion}} with this lovely lady? Mademoiselle Goldberg, I swear, will be Madame Ratichon within <b>the</b> <b>next</b> four and <b>twenty</b> hours. And the sooner you, Sir Gendarme, allow us to proceed on our way the less pain will you cause to this distressed and virtuous damsel." ...|$|R
50|$|Levave {{made his}} provincial rugby debut {{at the age}} of 19 for Wellington. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> year, aged <b>twenty,</b> he made the Hurricanes wider {{training}} group. However, a pectoral strain kept him on the sidelines for most of the year. In 2007, Levave played 14 games for the Lions, including five starts at blindside flanker. Earlier in the season he played for the New Zealand U21 team.|$|R
5|$|The ships {{remained}} in the Austro-Hungarian fleet for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>twenty</b> years, but severely reduced naval budgets owing to Hungarian disinterest in naval matters led to an uneventful career. In 1870, Habsburg was used {{in a show of}} force to try to prevent the Italian annexation of Rome while the city's protector, France, was distracted with the Franco-Prussian War, though the Italians took the city regardless. They were rearmed with newer guns in 1874 and again in 1882. Both ships were converted for secondary duties in 1886, Erzherzog Ferdinand Max becoming a tender to the gunnery training school from 1889 to 1908, while Habsburg was employed as a guard ship and a barracks ship in Pola until 1898, when she was stricken from the naval register and sold for scrap. Erzherzog Ferdinand Max {{remained in}} the inventory until 1916 when she too was broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|To {{increase}} the toll on Allied bombers further, intruder operations restarted briefly in August 1943 and took place intermittently {{or on the}} initiative of single crews, since no organised Fernnachtjagd existed after October 1941. Success was still possible. On 22 April 1944 the United States Army Air Force (USAAF) 1st Bombardment Division and 3rd Bombardment Division were returning to England in darkening skies after a daylight raid over Germany. They were attacked by an element of Messerschmitt Me 410 bomber destroyers of Kampfgeschwader 51 (KG 51—Bomber Wing 51) over their bases. Over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>twenty</b> minutes, 10 aircraft, nine of them B-24 Liberators, were shot down and 61 men killed {{for the loss of}} only two Me 410s and four airmen. The attack coincided with Operation Steinbock, a bombing and intruder offensive against Greater London and in response to the British offensive against German industrial cities, but the operation was aimed at the British capital rather than British bomber bases.|$|E
5|$|Nigel's date {{of birth}} is uncertain, but {{it is likely to}} have been some time around 1100. Historians {{occasionally}} refer to him as Nigel Poor or Nigel of Ely, but before his elevation to the episcopate he was commonly known as Nigel, the bishop's nephew, or Nigel, the treasurer. He was probably a Norman by ancestry although he was brought up in England, which in 1066 had been conquered by the Duke of Normandy, William the Conqueror. Following William's death in 1087 his realm was divided between two of his sons. His middle son, William Rufus, inherited the Kingdom of England, and the Duchy of Normandy passed to his eldest son, Robert Curthose. The youngest son, Henry, received a grant of money, which he used to purchase a lordship in Normandy. The brothers fought amongst themselves for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>twenty</b> years; the initial conflict was between Rufus and Robert, but after Rufus' death in 1100 Henry, who succeeded Rufus as King of England, also became involved. Eventually, in 1106, Henry captured Robert, imprisoned him for life, and took control of Normandy.|$|E
