5|$|Birds {{appear to}} moult {{once a year}} in spring or summer, {{although}} observations have been limited. Young birds spend about a year in juvenile plumage before moulting into adult plumage at around a year old. Juvenile birds have more brown-tinged and uniform plumage; the darker colour around the lores and eyes are less distinct. Their blackish bill is yellow-tipped, and the gape is yellow. <b>Their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> brownish, but turn yellow early. The exact timing is unknown but likely to be around four months of age.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of {{slow lorises}} are forward-facing, which gives stereo vision. <b>Their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> large and possess a {{reflective}} layer, called the tapetum lucidum, that improves low-light vision. It {{is possible that}} this layer blurs the images they see, as the reflected light may interfere with the incoming light. Slow lorises have monochromatic vision, meaning they see in shades of only one color. They lack the opsin gene {{that would allow them}} to detect short wavelength light, which includes the colors blue and green.|$|E

5|$|American {{paddlefish}} are smooth-skinned {{and almost}} entirely cartilaginous. <b>Their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> small and directed laterally. They have a large, tapering operculum flap, a large mouth, and a flat, paddle-shaped rostrum that measures approximately one-third {{of their body}} length. During {{the initial stages of}} development from embryo to hatchling, American paddlefish have no rostrum. It begins to form shortly after hatching. The rostrum is an extension of the cranium, not of the upper and lower jaws or olfactory system as with the long snouts of other fishes. Other distinguishing characteristics include a deeply forked heterocercal caudal fin and dull coloration, often with mottling, ranging from bluish gray to black dorsally grading to a whitish underbelly.|$|E
5|$|At {{least three}} aspects of flowers {{appear to have}} coevolved between {{flowering}} plants and insects, because they involve communication between these organisms. Firstly, flowers communicate with their pollinators by scent; insects use this scent to determine how far away a flower is, to approach it, and to identify where to land and finally to feed. Secondly, flowers attract insects with patterns of stripes leading to the rewards of nectar and pollen, and colours such as blue and ultraviolet, to which <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> sensitive; in contrast, bird-pollinated flowers tend to be red or orange. Thirdly, flowers such as some orchids mimic females of particular insects, deceiving males into pseudocopulation.|$|E
5|$|The horses' senses {{are based}} on their status as prey animals, where they {{must be aware of}} their {{surroundings}} at all times. They have the largest eyes of any land mammal, and are lateral-eyed, meaning that <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> positioned on the sides of their heads. This means that horses have a range of vision of more than 350°, with approximately 65° of this being binocular vision and the remaining 285° monocular vision. Horses have excellent day and night vision, but they have two-color, or dichromatic vision; their color vision is somewhat like red-green color blindness in humans, where certain colors, especially red and related colors, appear as a shade of green.|$|E
50|$|Konik horses with {{a single}} whorl located above <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> rated as more {{difficult}} to handle whereas horses that also had a single whorl but located below or right in between <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> easier to handle. Whorls that {{were found to be}} elongated or doubled acted the most cautious when coming up to an unfamiliar object. They looked longer and were slower to approaching then the single whorled horses.|$|R

5|$|<b>Their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> {{large and}} covered entirely by a {{transparent}} secondary cornea. They are greenish at the base. A pair of prominent ridges (olfactory crests) are {{present on the}} ventral surface of the head at the rear edge of the eyes. The mouth area is supported by seven triangular flaps (buccal lappets), each with 0 to 7 suckers of less than 0.2mm in diameter and 18 to 25 teeth. The strong, curved, and short beaks (rostra) are mostly black to dark brown. The radula has seven rows of teeth.|$|E
5|$|The {{reproductive}} behaviour {{of the king}} vulture in the wild is poorly known, and much knowledge has been gained from observing birds in captivity, particularly at the Paris Menagerie. An adult king vulture sexually matures when it is {{about four or five}} years old, with females maturing slightly earlier than males. The birds mainly breed during the dry season. King vultures mate for life and generally lay a single unmarked white egg in its nest in a hollow in a tree. To ward off potential predators, the vultures keep their nests foul-smelling. Both parents incubate the egg for the 52 to 58 days before it hatches. If the egg is lost, it will often be replaced after about six weeks. The parents share incubating and brooding duties until the chick is about a week old, after which they often stand guard rather than brood. The young are semi-altricial—they are helpless when born but are covered in downy feathers (truly altricial birds are born naked), and <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> open at birth. Developing quickly, the chicks are fully alert by their second day, and able to beg and wriggle around the nest, and preen themselves and peck by their third day. They start growing their second coat of white down by day 10, and stand on their toes by day 20. From one to three months of age, chicks walk around and explore the vicinity of the nest, and take their first flights at about three months of age.|$|E
25|$|Kittens do {{not open}} their eyes until 10-13 days old; though <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> {{initially}} blue, they change to green around seven weeks of age.|$|E

25|$|Snakes' {{eyes are}} covered by their clear scales (the brille) rather than movable eyelids. <b>Their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> always open, and for sleeping, the retina can be closed or the face buried among {{the folds of the}} body.|$|E
25|$|Waterhorse: A large pinniped, {{similar to}} the long necked and merhorse. Only the males are maned, but females appear to have snorkels. Both of <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> rather small. They are {{noteworthy}} for being behind both salt and fresh water sightings.|$|E
25|$|A downturned {{mouth with}} fleshy lips {{surrounded}} {{by a number of}} barbels assist them with feeding. They are a solid, almost cylindrical, elongate fish, with the posterior half of their body tapering into a pointed eel-like tail. A continuous fin margin surrounds this tapering posterior half of the body. <b>Their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> small.|$|E

25|$|The {{performance}} of the eye in low light levels depends on {{the distance between the}} lens and the retina, and small birds are effectively forced to be diurnal because <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> not large enough to give adequate night vision. Although many species migrate at night, they often collide with even brightly lit objects like lighthouses or oil platforms. Birds of prey are diurnal because, although <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> large, they are optimised to give maximum spatial resolution rather than light gathering, so they also do not function well in poor light. Many birds have an asymmetry in the eye's structure which enables them to keep the horizon and {{a significant part of the}} ground in focus simultaneously. The cost of this adaptation is that they have myopia in the lower part of their visual field.|$|E
25|$|Huskies are {{energetic}} and athletic. They {{usually have a}} thick double coat that can be gray, black, copper red, or white. <b>Their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> typically pale blue, although {{they may also be}} brown, green, blue, yellow, or heterochromic. Huskies are more prone to some degree of uveitis than most other breeds.|$|E
25|$|Members of the {{subfamily}} Amblyopinae are elongated mud-dwelling gobies {{commonly known}} as the eel gobies or worm gobies. Their two dorsal fins are connected by a membranous structure and <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> highly reduced. They are usually pink, red, or purple in coloration. Amblyopinae contain 12 genera and about 23 species.|$|E

25|$|Snow leopards have long, thick fur, {{and their}} base color varies from smoky gray to {{yellowish}} tan, with whitish underparts. They have dark grey to black open rosettes on their bodies, with small spots {{of the same}} color on their heads and larger spots on their legs and tails. Unusually among cats, <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> pale green or grey in color.|$|E
25|$|Temnodontosaurus {{are known}} for their {{incredibly}} large eyes. <b>Their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> thought to be the largest of any animal ever known. Temnodontosaurus eyes were approximately 20cm (8in) in diameter making them some of the largest of any known vertebrate. They have a tail bend which is characteristic of Jurassic age Ichthyosaurs. and they have many conical teeth that fill their jaw and are set in a continuous groove.|$|E
25|$|The English Springer Spaniel {{is similar}} to the English Cocker Spaniel and at first glance the only major {{difference}} is the latter's smaller size. However English Springers also tend to have shorter, and higher-set ears than English Cockers. In addition Springers also tend to have a longer muzzle; <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> not as prominent, and the coat is less abundant. The major differences between the Welsh Springer and the English Springer are that the Welsh have more limited colours and tend to be slightly smaller.|$|E
