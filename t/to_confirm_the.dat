5|$|A {{physician}} will initially assess for Parkinson's {{disease with}} a careful medical history and neurological examination.

The finding of Lewy bodies in the midbrain on autopsy is usually considered final proof that the person had PD. The clinical course of the illness over time may reveal it is not Parkinson's disease, requiring that the clinical presentation be periodically reviewed to confirm accuracy of the diagnosis.|$|E

A 2010 phylogenetic study by Nicolas Straube and colleagues, based on nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, found the black dogfish is the sister {{species of the}} whitefin dogfish (C.ritteri), and the two are, in turn, sister to the clade formed by the granular dogfish (C.granulatum) and combtooth dogfish (C.nigrum).|$|E

In 2011, when one of the decay products (289115) was synthesized directly, its properties matched those measured in the claimed indirect synthesis from the decay of element 117.

5|$|An {{alternative}} {{possibility is}} that 55 Cancri e is a solid planet made of carbon-rich material rather than the oxygen-rich material that makes up the terrestrial planets in our solar system. In this case, roughly {{a third of the}} planet's mass would be carbon, much of which may be in the form of diamond {{as a result of the}} temperatures and pressures in the planet's interior.

5|$|Bowie perished {{with the}} rest of the Alamo {{defenders}} on March 6, when the Mexicans attacked. Most of the noncombatants in the fort, including Bowie's relatives, survived. Santa Anna ordered the alcalde of San Antonio, Francisco Antonio Ruiz, <b>to</b> <b>confirm</b> <b>the</b> identities of Bowie, Travis, and Crockett. After first ordering that Bowie be buried, as he was too brave a man to be burned like a dog, Santa Anna later had Bowie's body placed with those of the other Texians on the funeral pyre.|$|E

5|$|Dengue {{is spread}} by {{several species of}} {{mosquito}} of the Aedes type, principally A. aegypti. The virus has five different types; infection with one type usually gives lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term immunity to the others.

A number of tests are available <b>to</b> <b>confirm</b> <b>the</b> diagnosis including detecting antibodies to the virus or its RNA.|$|E
5|$|FLCN {{mutations}} are {{detected by}} sequencing in 88% of probands with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome. This means {{that some people}} with the clinical diagnosis have mutations that are not detectable by current technology, or that mutations in another currently unknown gene could be responsible for a minority of cases. In addition, amplifications and deletions in exonic regions are also tested. Genetic testing can be useful <b>to</b> <b>confirm</b> <b>the</b> clinical diagnosis of {{and to provide a}} means of determining other at-risk individuals in a family even if they have not yet developed BHD symptoms.|$|E
