500|$|With the {{publication}} of A Manual of North American Birds in 1887, Robert Ridgway condensed what was known about the continent's birds into a relatively compact 642 pages and 464 outline drawings. [...] A prototype of today's field guides, it was quite successful, going into a second edition in 1896, and was described by Montague Chamberlain as [...] "far away the best <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> for the working naturalist." [...] Nevertheless, its bulk was unwieldy {{for use in the}} field, and its identification keys depended on characteristics of the bird in the hand, not field marks. [...] Harry Oberholser characterized the quality of the illustrations as [...] "rarely equaled, never excelled" [...] in beauty and accuracy.|$|E

Lionel Messi is the greatest <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> in Argentina and we must take care of him." [...] Mayor of Buenos Aires Horacio Rodríguez Larreta unveiled a statue of Messi in the capital to convince him reconsider retirement. On social networks, NoTeVayasLeo became a global trending topic, and even a playlist on Spotify. The campaign also continued in the streets and avenues of the Argentine capital, with about 50,000 supporters going to the Obelisco de Buenos Aires on 2 July, using the same slogan.|$|E

Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams, Beyoncé's former bandmates from the group Destiny's Child provided background vocals along with Stefan Skarbek and Boots. The audio mixing of [...] "Superpower" [...] was completed by Tony Maserati at Mirrorbal Studios and Clockworks Studios and the track was eventually mastered by Tom Coyne and Aya Merrill at Sterling Sound.

Likewise, Arad noted, [...] "Captain America stands for freedom for all democracies, for hope all around the world. He was created to stop tyranny and the idea of stopping tyranny is important today as it was then. So I think that we will have some interesting challenges but at the end of the day if the movie is terrific and the movie talks to the world, it's not about one place, it's about the world and I think [...] that basis it will be very successful." [...] Later, after the election of US President Barack Obama, Feige commented, [...] "The idea of change and hope has permeated the country, regardless of politics, and that includes Hollywood. Discussions in all our development meetings include the zeitgeist and how it's changed in the last two weeks. Things are being adjusted".|$|E

500|$|Although the Mr. Hankey {{short film}} was never made, Parker and Stone made two Christmas-related {{animated}} short films called The Spirit of Christmas, {{which served as}} precursors to the South Park series. When the shorts began to generate interest for a possible television series, Parker and Stone originally conceived {{the idea of a}} South Park-like show with four children characters, but with a talking stool named Mr. Hankey as the show's main protagonist; they planned to call it [...] "The Mr. Hankey Show". They pitched the idea to friend Brian Graden, then a television executive with the Fox Broadcasting Company, but he rejected it and said, according to Matt Stone, [...] "I'm not putting poo on my network". Parker and Stone adapted their original idea into a show revolving around the South Park town and four children without Mr. Hankey as a protagonist, but they planned to revive the character as a minor supporting role in a future episode. Later, when Comedy Central expressed interest in the series, Parker and Stone brought up the idea of a Mr. Hankey episode during negotiations with the network executives. Parker claimed during a meeting, he said, [...] "One <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to know before we really go any further: {{how do you feel about}} talking poo?"

Now {{effectively}} a puppet himself, for an entire month Päts signed about 200 decrees for the new Soviet regime. Among other things, he signed a decree to change the electoral law, allowing the new regime to organize preliminary elections. This law was illegal, since the upper house of the Riigikogu had been dissolved and never reconvened. The new elections were only for the lower chamber, the Riigivolikogu, with voters being presented with a single list of Communists and fellow travellers. On Victory Day of 23June 1940, Päts declared: [...] "the greatest <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> accomplished {{is the creation of}} the Estonian state. To her we have given our strongest love, our loyalty, our work, and our life." [...] From 29June 1940, Päts remained under permanent house arrest. Even in early July, Päts declared to the German ambassador that he did not believe Estonia would be Sovietized. On 21July 1940, the Estonian SSR was proclaimed and it is claimed that only then Päts realized the essence of the Soviet occupation.|$|E
2500|$|Cumberbatch's {{performance}} {{was met with}} widespread acclaim from critics. TIME ranked Cumberbatch's portrayal number one in its Top 10 film performances of 2014, with the magazine's chief film critic Richard Corliss calling Cumberbatch's characterisation [...] "the actor's oddest, fullest, most Cumberbatchian character yet ... he doesn't play Turing so much as inhabit him, bravely and sympathetically but without mediation". Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times declared Turing [...] "the role of Cumberbatch's career", while A.O. Scott of The New York Times stated that it is [...] "one of the year's finest pieces of screen acting". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone asserted that the actor [...] "gives an explosive, emotionally complex" [...] portrayal. Critic Clayton Davis stated that it's a [...] "performance for the ages... proving he's {{one of the best}} actors working today". Foundas of Variety wrote that Cumberbatch's acting is [...] "masterful... a marvel to watch", Manohla Dargis of The New York Times described it as [...] "delicately nuanced, prickly and tragic" [...] and Owen Gleiberman of the BBC proclaimed it an [...] "emotionally tailored perfection". It's [...] "a storming performance from Cumberbatch: you'll be deciphering his work long after the credits roll" [...] declared Dave Calhoun of Time Out. In addition, Claudia Puig of USA Today concluded in her review, [...] "It's Cumberbatch's nuanced, haunted performance that leaves the most powerful impression". The Hollywood Reporters Todd McCarthy reported that the undeniable highlight of the film was Cumberbatch, [...] "whose charisma, tellingly modulated and naturalistic array of eccentricities, talent at indicating a mind never at rest and knack for simultaneously portraying physical oddness and attractiveness combine to create an entirely credible portrait of genius at work". Critic Roger Friedman wrote {{at the end of his}} review, [...] "Cumberbatch may be the closest <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to a real descendant of Sir Laurence Olivier".|$|E
2500|$|Principal {{photography}} commenced on September 20, 1993. The lead offscreen talent had {{all worked}} with Tarantino on Reservoir Dogs— cinematographer Andrzej Sekuła, film editor Sally Menke, production designer David Wasco, and costume designer Betsy Heimann. According to Tarantino, [...] "e had $8 million [...] I {{wanted it to}} look like a $20–25 million movie. I wanted it {{to look like a}}n epic. It's an epic in everything— in invention, in ambition, in length, in scope, in everything except the price tag." [...] The film, he says, was shot [...] "on 50 ASA film stock, which is the slowest stock they make. The reason we use it is that it creates an almost no-grain image, it's lustrous. It's the closest <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to 50s Technicolor." [...] The largest chunk of the budget— $150,000— went to creating the Jack Rabbit Slim's set. It was built in a Culver City warehouse, where it was joined by several other sets, as well as the film's production offices. The diner sequence was shot on location in Hawthorne at the Hawthorne Grill, known for its Googie architecture. For the costumes, Tarantino took his inspiration from French director Jean-Pierre Melville, who believed that the clothes his characters wore were their symbolic suits of armor. Tarantino cast himself in a modest-sized role as he had in Reservoir Dogs. One of his pop totems, Fruit Brute, a long-discontinued General Mills cereal, also returned from the earlier film. The shoot wrapped on November 30. Before Pulp Fictions premiere, Tarantino convinced Avary to forfeit his agreed-on cowriting credit and accept a [...] "story by" [...] credit, so the line [...] "Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino" [...] could be used in advertising and onscreen.|$|E
