2500|$|As {{the total}} number of degrees of freedom {{approaches}} infinity, the system will be found in the macrostate that corresponds to the highest multiplicity. In order to illustrate this principle, observe the skin temperature of a frozen metal bar. Using a <b>thermal</b> <b>image</b> of the skin temperature, note the temperature distribution on the surface. This initial observation of temperature represents a [...] "microstate". At some future time, a second observation of the skin temperature produces a second microstate. By continuing this observation process, it is possible to produce a series of microstates that illustrate the thermal history of the bar's surface. Characterization of this historical series of microstates is possible by choosing the macrostate that successfully classifies them all into a single grouping.|$|E

40|$|The present-day {{reliance}} on metadata in obtaining information from <b>thermal</b> <b>images</b> {{means that in}} the absence of metadata, estimating temperatures from <b>thermal</b> <b>images</b> would have to be done with user intervention, which is time-consuming when there are many <b>thermal</b> <b>images</b> to consider. This research intends to develop a program to estimate temperatures from <b>thermal</b> <b>images</b> without metadata, so that a wider range of sources of <b>thermal</b> <b>images,</b> such as scans from documents, can be handled in large numbers. To facilitate this research, <b>thermal</b> <b>images</b> of various subjects are used as sample images to test the program. A method to estimate temperatures from <b>thermal</b> <b>images</b> without metadata and without the need for manual input has been developed, by making use of optical character recognition to have the program automatically read the temperature scales on <b>thermal</b> <b>images</b> for the necessary information. This method utilizes correlation coefficients to compare images of objects with images of known characters.

30|$|Today, {{building}} practitioners widely use Infrared (IR) thermography {{to identify}} {{sources of energy}} loss in building envelopes. The IR thermography –which detects and measures heat variations from surfaces in a non-destructive manner– is particularly known for its usefulness for identifying thermal defects. Nonetheless, current thermographic inspection processes have several inefficiencies. For example, <b>thermal</b> <b>images</b> captured using consumer-level IR thermal cameras typically have low spatial resolutions (160 × 120 or 320 × 240 pixel) and small fields-of-view compared to their digital counterparts (> 1 megapixel). As a result, sensing thermal performance data for buildings, even a single room, requires large numbers of <b>thermal</b> <b>images</b> (e.g., ~ 300 to 400 <b>thermal</b> <b>images</b> for around 4 m × 5 m room based on experiments). Considering significantly large collections of 2 D <b>thermal</b> <b>images</b> {{that need to be}} manually analyzed for the purpose of assessing thermal conditions, their direct application for practical building diagnostics can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. In order to improve the process of sensing thermal performance using raw 2 D <b>thermal</b> <b>images,</b> several studies (Borrmann et al. [2013]; [Ham and Golparvar-Fard 2013]; Lagüela et al. [2013]; Wang et al. [2013]) have recently focused on developing methods for 3 D thermal modeling of building environments by leveraging digital photogrammetry or laser scanning, and promising results have been reported.|$|R

30|$|Recently, several {{research}} groups {{have focused on}} the problem of non-destructive measurement of the actual heat transfer conditions of building assemblies using <b>thermal</b> <b>images.</b> Madding's work (Madding [2008]) is one of the earliest studies that propose a method for analyzing <b>thermal</b> <b>images</b> to estimate the actual heat transfer conditions for building envelopes. Based on the environmental assumption of a steady-state heat transfer condition of building environments, this work measured the R-value of drywall assemblies using the indoor surface temperature data obtained from <b>thermal</b> <b>images.</b> The measurements were experimentally conducted in controlled lab environments, and then they were compared with the theoretical expected properties. Likewise, based on the similar environmental assumptions, methods proposed in (Albatici and Tonelli [2010]; Dall'O' et al. [2013]; Fokaides and Kalogirou [2011]) measured the overall heat transfer coefficient of the building assemblies. For validation, several experiments were conducted for a few standard wall assemblies. In these studies, the difference between the measured values using <b>thermal</b> <b>images</b> and the notional values was reported to be in the range of ~ 10 % (Madding [2008]), 10 - 20 % (Fokaides and Kalogirou [2011]), and around 15 % for cavity walls (Dall'O' et al. [2013]).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Metal {{materials}} especially {{steel or}} cast iron are used extensively in {{many types of}} construction such as buildings, bridges, cranes, vehicles and so on, so detection or prediction of metal failure is very important, but deformation of metal material often deliveries heat energy which can be detected by infrared imager. The test specimen is installed between the two grips of the testing machine and then loaded in tension and in compression. The IR 913 A infrared imager is used to observe the deformation of metal specimen. The high-sensitive infrared <b>thermal</b> <b>images</b> of metal specimen in the different phase of deformation are obtained. The paper theoretically analyzes the reason from the thermodynamics and plastic mechanics, the conclusions are drawn as follows: 1) When applying loads, temperature field {{on the surface of}} metal specimen is changing, the local rise of temperature is remarkable, this can be observed from the infrared <b>thermal</b> <b>images.</b> 2) From the infrared <b>thermal</b> <b>images,</b> rising temperatures are found in the regions of stress concentrations. 3) When the test specimen approaches to failure or appears fracture, there is a remarkable change that can be shown from the infrared <b>thermal</b> <b>images</b> with remarkable colors...|$|R
