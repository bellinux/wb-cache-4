There is also a memorial wall with his name engraved on it in Boston. A street was named in his honor in Safed, Israel, and a stone memorial erected in Tel Aviv more recently.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{for a new}} {{building}} on the site have gone through several generations. The first design consisted of a six-storey building (including basement), which had a large shop on the ground floor, {{as well as an}} underground car park and four floors of residential apartments, with a top level to hold the building's mechanics. Each floor would have 4,000 square feet (372 m2), and {{there would have been a}} leaning tower to <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> The design was given planning permission in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Production on {{the film}} was {{temporarily}} shut down after a fire destroyed several soundstages at Paramount Studios, {{one of which was}} adjacent to the set for the Genesis planet. Initially, the set's pyrotechnics were suspected of causing the fire, but the cause was ruled to be arson. Shatner was among the cast members who grabbed fire hoses to stop the flames. Correll hoped the place would burn down so that he would get his chance to film in Hawaii. While most of the set was undamaged, holes in <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> had to be covered with heavy black curtains to prevent outside light from leaking in.|$|E

5|$|The lobby guard {{returned}} {{a call to}} the alarm monitoring service, which had called when the alarm initially went off to confirm that there was a fire, but never called the Philadelphia Fire Department. The first call came from someone on the street who saw smoke coming from the building. During the first 911 call, at about 8:27 PM, the alarm company alerted the fire department to the fire. Engine 43 was the first firefighting unit to arrive at the scene and reported seeing heavy smoke and flames in one of the windows. As firefighters started fighting the fire it had grown with flames breaking through windows and lapping up <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b>|$|E

25|$|After {{purchasing}} the hotel, Nicholson hired Archibald Henning to paint large portraits on <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> {{hoping that they}} would lure curious pedestrians inside. These portraits depicted showed well-known people, such as The Duke of Wellington and Alfred d'Orsay, attending events at the hotel.|$|E

25|$|On {{the northeastern}} side of Piccadilly Circus, {{on the corner}} between Shaftesbury Avenue and Coventry Street, is the London Pavilion. The first {{building}} bearing the name was built in 1859 and was a music hall. In 1885, Shaftesbury Avenue was built through the former site of the Pavilion, and a new London Pavilion was constructed, which {{also served as a}} music hall. In 1924 electric billboards were erected on <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b>|$|E
25|$|The first station {{building}} {{was designed by}} Georg Andreas Bull. Known as the Asker Class, a similar design was used for another eleven train stations on the Drammen- and Randsfjorden Lines. The original station {{building was}} among the most spacious and elaborate for its size category. Built in Swiss chalet style, it featured a saddle roof and was split between a public area and a residence for the station master. Unusual for stations at the time the residential door was on the front, rather than <b>the</b> <b>side,</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> The station was decorated in fretsaw ornaments in organic and Gothic styles.|$|E

25|$|Additionally, private {{groups have}} become {{increasingly}} involved in the conflict, such as the International Solidarity Movement on <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Palestinians, and the American Israel Public Affairs Committee on <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Israelis.|$|R
25|$|An American sentry, Air Force Staff Sergeant Alfredo R. Guerrero, was {{stationed}} atop Building #131. He witnessed the men, recognised the vehicles as a threat, reported it to security, {{and began a}} floor by floor evacuation of the building. His actions are credited with saving dozens of lives. Many of the evacuees were in the stairwell when the bomb went off. The stairwell was constructed of heavy marble and was located on <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> away from the truck bomb, perhaps the safest location in the building. For his actions, Guerrero was awarded the Airman's Medal, the highest peacetime award for valour that the U.S. Air Force gives.|$|E
25|$|Presented as Jubilee Confectioners, the two storey sweet shop {{opened in}} 1994 and {{is meant to}} {{represent}} the typical family run shops of the era, with living quarters above the shop (the second storey not {{being part of the}} display). To the front of the ground floor is a shop, where traditional sweets and chocolate (which was still relatively expensive at the time) are sold to visitors, while {{in the rear of the}} ground floor is a manufacturing area where visitors can view the techniques of the time (accessed via the arched walkway on <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building).</b> The sweet rollers were sourced from a variety of shops and factories.|$|E
25|$|In {{his book}} Ready for the Plaintiff, Belli noted {{examples}} of negligence cited {{by himself and}} other personal-injury lawyers to win in court—for example, a colleague in Florida, who showed how a builder violated a building code in Miami Beach concerning the use of wooden shims in construction of outside walls (forbidden by the municipal code because {{of the effect of}} the ocean salt and air). The facing was a slab of Vitreous marble, whose adhesion was eventually weakened by the climate; it fell off <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> and injured a passerby, who sued the builder. After winning a court case, Belli would raise a Jolly Roger flag over his Montgomery Street office building in the Barbary Coast district of San Francisco (which Belli claimed had been a Gold Rush-era brothel) and fire a cannon, mounted on his office roof, to announce the victory and the impending party.|$|E

25|$|The {{building}} has a curved frontage. Between of the arcade {{on the ground}} floor is a central feature consisting of perpendicular piers running up three storeys. Around the central feature, which projects slightly from the frontage, is an acanthus leaf border worked in precast concrete. A white stucco frieze of interlocking discs frames the panel. There is 18,000 feet of floor space in the building arranged around an air-well. The ground floor was designed for retail. The central entrance and show windows had curved plate glass that had to be specifically made in England. Italian tiles were used in the floors throughout the building. The upper four floors, of which one complete floor was reserved for the Oriental Government Security Life Assurance Company, was used as office space and was reached by a lift and staircase at <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> The basement was constructed separately, with windows fitted with sliding steel doors. The contract time for completing the structure was eight months, and the construction was to start shortly after late November 1931, with the architects reported as Messrs. Booty and Edwards, the contractors as Gammon (Malaya) Ltd., and Steen Sehested as the consulting reinforced concrete specialist.|$|E
500|$|In 1854, a {{monument}} was erected in Ridgefield to honor David Wooster. [...] The Keeler Tavern, now a local museum, features a British cannonball still lodged in <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> [...] Educational markers are maintained {{at various points}} of significance throughout the town, including the locations where David Wooster was mortally wounded and Benedict Arnold was pinned by his shot horse. [...] A stone marker {{near the site of}} the barricade marks a spot where both Patriot and British troops were buried together. In New Haven, a public square was named for Wooster, as was Wooster Street.|$|E
500|$|The [...] {{rectangular}} house stands [...] {{high and}} was built with Indiana Limestone, and yellow Roman brick, which emphasizes the geometric and horizontal {{nature of the}} home's exterior. The house was constructed on a narrow lot, so the main entryway is located on <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> similar to Wright's Warren McArthur House of 1892. The south side entrance was adorned with Classical detailing and the cantilevered entry lintel, which sits on two ornately detailed stone columns, was decorated with quatrefoils (...) which were set on a stone panel. The front room is not split by a corridor or side hall, making it more spacious.|$|E
