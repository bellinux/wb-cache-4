30|$|The {{petrographic}} {{investigation of}} the studied Lower Paleozoic sandstones from southeast central Sinai revealed that it is composed mainly of quartz arenite microfacies. Some diagenetic events are identified in this sandstone including considerable compaction during burial diagenesis at higher temperatures and low flow rates, cementation by clay minerals and iron oxides, dissolution and alteration of unstable clastic grains, and tectonically induced grain fracturing. Unstable clastic grains like feldspars suffered considerable alteration to kaolinite when exposed to meteoric water of low ionic strength near the surface. The main pore spaces in this microfacies are of intergranular type. The studied microfacies {{is characterized by the}} presence of some detrital clays, and iron oxides as cements which unequally affected the porosity and permeability of the studied rocks due to the heterogenetic distribution of these fines. Existence of different pore systems, hence different petrophysical parameters within the same lithofacies, reflects the dissimilar distribution of the diagenetic processes or effects that affect the studied section. The current reservoir clustering has been done, based on the <b>turbulence</b> <b>factor</b> which is an important petrophysical attribute studied by many authors, among them, Jones (1987) and Amaefule et al. (1993), whose equations were selected for the data layout. <b>Turbulence</b> <b>factor</b> reflects the pore system nature that represents the end product of all diagenetic processes and rock composition, so the tight flow pore system, due to intensive cementation or detrital clays or finer grain components, would exhibit much turbulence within the flow, in contrast to the wide paths pore system as a result of lesser clay content or cementing material or larger grain component, they would display laminar or less turbulent flow regime, so a clear relation between diagenesis and turbulence can be established. <b>Turbulence</b> <b>factor</b> which is a good parameter for reservoir zonation based on flow properties is strongly affected by permeability, heterogeneity, and reservoir quality index. Also, pore throat size distribution affects flow system positively or negatively, where the more the macropores, the higher the permeability, the lower the <b>turbulence</b> <b>factor,</b> and the more the micropores, the lower the permeability, the higher the <b>turbulence</b> <b>factor.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose a novel {{approach}} to analytical modelling of steady-state heat transfer from the exterior of totally enclosed fan-cooled induction motors. The proposed approach is based on the geometry simplification methods, energy balance equation, modified correlations for forced convection, the Stefan-Boltzmann law, air-flow velocity profiles, and <b>turbulence</b> <b>factor</b> models. To apply modified correlations for forced convection, the motor exterior is presented with surfaces of elementary 3 -D shapes as well as the air-flow velocity profiles and <b>turbulence</b> <b>factor</b> models are introduced. The existing correlations for forced convection from a short horizontal cylinder and correlations for heat transfer from straight fins (as well as inter-fin surfaces) in axial air-flows are modified by introducing the Prandtl number to the appropriate power. The correlations for forced convection from straight fins and inter-fin surfaces are derived from the existing ones for combined heat transfer (due to forced convection and radiation) by using the forced-convection correlations for a single flat plate. Employing the proposed analytical approach, satisfactory agreement is obtained with experimental data from other studies...|$|E

30|$|Surface Lower Paleozoic {{sandstone}} {{samples were}} collected from southeast central Sinai. These samples subjected to petrophysical measurements which are porosity and permeability. It is known that <b>turbulence</b> <b>factor</b> (β) is a good tool to describe turbulent flow level, hence {{it was used to}} detect the flow properties distribution that corresponds {{to the nature of the}} pore system, so <b>turbulence</b> <b>factor</b> (β) was correlated with porosity, permeability, and reservoir quality index using many equations, where porosity correlation shows the presence of three groups having same porosity ranges but correspond to different values of <b>turbulence</b> <b>factor,</b> this refers to the presence of different flow zones. Porosity–permeability relation confirmed also the presence of similar three groups, where there are nearly same porosity ranges but with different permeability values. Consequently, samples with nearly same porosity values and representing the three groups were selected for capillary pressure by mercury injection to reveal the flow properties that characterize each group. Capillary pressure results confirmed that each group has their own pore system and flow regime. Petrography was done by optical polarizing microscope (OPM) through thin sections. The results indicated that the studied sandstone is composed mainly of quartz arenite microfacies of fine, angular to subrounded, moderately well sorted monocrystalline quartz grains. There are several features indicating that the investigated sandstones have been subjected to diagenesis processes. Diagenetic events identified in these sandstones include considerable compaction during burial diagenesis at higher temperatures and low flow rates, cementation by clay minerals and iron oxides, dissolution and alteration of unstable clastic grains, and tectonically induced grain fracturing. Unstable clastic grains like feldspars suffered considerable alteration to kaolinite when exposed to meteoric water of low ionic strength near the surface. The distribution of this kaolinite rather than the post-depositional iron oxides in pores of the studied sandstone leaded to differentiating these sandstones into three different flow units. This zonation indicates that the turbulence properties are proportional to the diagenetic effects inside the pores.|$|E

Understanding the wind characteristics at the bridge site is thus of great significance to the wind- resistant analysis of such a flexible structure.

The Ventilation Experiment (VE) was performed in a 1. 3 m diameter unlined horizontal microtunnel on Opalinus clay at Mont Terri underground research laboratory in Switzerland to evaluate the impact of desaturation on rock properties. A multiphase flow and reactive transport model of VE is presented here. The model accounts for liquid, vapor and air flow, evaporation/condensation and multicomponent reactive solute transport with kinetic dissolution of pyrite and siderite and local-equilibrium dissolution/precipitation of calcite, ferrihydrite, dolomite, gypsum and quartz.

Direct integration of the steam generator {{is one of the}} possibilities. In this paper a higher order finite volume modeling approach for the storage is presented which reduces numerical diffusion but applies a <b>turbulence</b> <b>factor</b> which determines stratification. The discharge of the storage and the circulation of molten salt through the shell side of the internal steam generator by a forced flow is compared to natural circulation. The buoyancy driven flow strongly depends on the system design. The performance is improved with higher positioning of the heat sink in the storage system since a lower minimum charging level of the storage is required to obtain the design flow rate. The difference between the operation modes is more distinctive in the morning and the evening, when the charging level is relatively low and during days with low irradiation. With the chosen configuration both operation modes lead to the same circulation rate as soon as the charging level exceeds 24 %. An annual simulation showed a reduction of total produced electricity by 3 % for natural circulation compared to forced circulation. In case of forced circulation 95 % of the cumulated charging power can be discharged, pure natural circulation achieves a discharge rate of 91 %. To achieve the same performance the buoyancy driven flow needs to be supported by an impeller in 9 % of the operational time...|$|E

Improvements being made in three CW, CO 2 laser doppler systems, including a filter bank for optimized signal processing and a versatile scanning system, are noted. A pulsed CO 2 system for measuring clear air turbulence is described, and results of test performance on board a Convair 990 are presented. It is noted that while the system was able to measure air speed and turbulence, the range of its transmitter-atmosphere-receiver was lower than predicted, and a difference of about 20 to 30 dB existed between the actual and theoretical <b>turbulence</b> measurements. <b>Factors</b> that may account for this loss are listed...|$|R
