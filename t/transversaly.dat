40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show that any {{extension}} of a minimal Lie foliation on a compact manifold is a <b>transversaly</b> Riemannian g- foliation with trivial normal bundle. This result permits to classify the extensions of a minimal Lie foliation on a compact manifold from the Lie subgroups of its Lie group. Comment: 12 page...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} random dynamical {{systems such}} as groups of conformal transformations with a probability measure, or <b>transversaly</b> conformal foliations with a Laplace operator along the leaves, in which case we consider the holonomy pseudo-group. We prove that either there exists a measure invariant under {{all the elements of}} the group (or the pseudo-group), or almost surely a long composition of maps contracts exponentially a ball. We deduce some results about the unique ergodicity. 1...|$|E
40|$|When the saddle-center {{bifurcation}} {{occurs in}} an analytic family of area-preserving maps, first a parabolic fixed point {{appears at the}} origin and then this point bifurcates, creating an elliptic and hyperbolic fixed point. Separatrices of the hyperbolic fixed point form a small loop around the elliptic point. In general the separatrices intersect <b>transversaly</b> and the splitting is exponentially small {{with respect to the}} perturbation parameter. We derive an asymptotic formula, which describes the splitting, and study the properties of the preexponential factor...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect on}} the lasing {{photostability}} of Rhodamine 6 G (Rh 6 G), and the rigidity of a hybrid inorganicorganic matrix by controlled addition of di-, tri- and tetrafunctionalized alkoxides has been evaluated. The dye was incorporated into hybrid matrices of (2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (HEMA) or vol/vol copolymers of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and HEMA with different weight proportions of polycondensated dimethyldiethoxysilane (DEOS), methyltriethoxysilane (TRIEOS), and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS). The laser samples were <b>transversaly</b> pumped at 534 nm at 5. 5 mJ/pulse and up to a 10 Hz repetition rate. The dependence of the laser photostability on organic-inorganic composition, pH of the medium, and thermal treatment of the samples was studied. Good stability, with a drop of the initial laser output of only 13...|$|E
40|$|Let us {{consider}} non <b>transversaly</b> orientable measurable foliations of codimension one, on orientable open manifolds M^n, n> 3. We calculated the subgroups of finite type of two groups: {{one is the}} fundamental group Π_ 1 (BΓ) of the Haefliger's classifying space {{and the other is}} the quotient of Π_ 1 (M) by the normal subgroup L' generated by free homotopy classes of the loops contained in the leaves. We use these groups to extend the result of G. Levitt to a no-orientable case. This result caracterize the finite type groups acting freely on a simply connected 1 -manifold by C^ 2 -diffeomorphism which preserves orientation. We study the pseudogroups of the isometries of the circle and we calculated the variation of the measure of the orbite space when we modified the length of the domain of the generators...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} hyperbolic tori {{of three}} {{degrees of freedom}} initially hyperbolic Hamiltonian systems. We prove that if the stable and unstable manifold of a hyperbolic torus intersect <b>transversaly,</b> then there exists a hyperbolic invariant set near a homoclinic orbit on which the dynamics is conjugated to a Bernoulli shift. The proof {{is based on a}} new geometrico-dynamical feature of partially hyperbolic systems, the transversality-torsion phenomenon, which produces complete hyperbolicity from partial hyperbolicity. We deduce the existence of infinitely many hyperbolic periodic orbits near the given torus. The relevance of these results for the instability of near-integrable Hamiltonian systems is then discussed. For a given transition chain, we construct chain of hyperbolic periodic orbits. Then we easily prove the existence of periodic orbits of arbitrarily high period close to such chain using standard results on hyperbolic sets...|$|E
40|$|In {{a recent}} paper, M. Do Carmo and B. Lawson studied hypersurfaces M of {{constant}} mean curvature in hyperbolic space [2]. They use the Alexandrov reflection technique to study M given the asymptotic boundary ðM. For example, {{one of their}} theorems says M is a horoshpere when ðM reduces to a point. They also prove a Bernstein type theorem for minimal graphs. In this paper we shall extend their results to other boundary conditions. We prove an embedded M, of constant mean curvature, with ðM a subset of a codimension one sphere S, either is invariant by reflection in the hyperbolic hyperplane containg S or is a hypersphere. In the former case M is a "bigraph" over H: it meets any geodesic orthogonal to H either not at all or <b>transversaly</b> in two points (one {{on each side of}} H) or tangentially on H...|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} the apical microleakage of Thermafil obturations after three different post space preparation techniques. Materials and methods: 33 root canals of monoradiculated extracted teeth were prepared with M two and then obturated with Thermafil. Teeth so treated were then {{divided into three}} groups and the post space to middle root was prepared using three different techniques. In samples in group A the housing for the post was created using a Torpan bur, and the carrier was partially removed only in the coronal portion. In samples in group B the carrier was completely removed and gutta-percha was hand compacted, before canal preparation using a Torpan bur. In samples in group C the carrier was completely removed, without gutta-percha compaction, before canal preparation using Torpan bur. The roots were immersed for 72 hours in methylene blue dye solution and sectioned <b>transversaly</b> at 1 - 3 - 5 mm from the apex for evaluation of dye penetration using a stereomicroscope. The data collected were processed using Win CAD software and subjected to statistical analysis using the Student t test for p< 0. 05. Results: There {{were no significant differences}} between the three groups, except for the presence of voids in the intermediation section of teeth in groups B and C. Conclusions: Post space preparation did not influence the apical seal, and gutta-percha without voids was always found in the last millimetre of the canal obturation. This study proposes a post preparation technique which provides for complete carrier removal using pliers, hand compaction of residual gutta-percha with a manual plugger and anlargement of the root canal, using appropriate post space burs, free of any interference from the carrier. Operating time is reduced, as is the risk of creating ledges or iatrogenic perforations...|$|E
