5|$|Contrary to {{previous}} reports <b>that</b> <b>France</b> {{was against the}} invasion, France gave its approval and helped to air-lift the AU troops to the island. French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner stressed on April 8 <b>that</b> <b>France</b> had not supported Bacar or provided him with any protection, {{and that it had}} fully supported African Union intervention.|$|E
5|$|General Salle {{removed the}} already limited {{autonomy}} of the Council on February 16, 1918. After the armistices and capitulations {{at the end of}} First World War, it was agreed <b>that</b> <b>France</b> and Italy should continue to govern the territories they occupied, and <b>that</b> <b>France,</b> Italy and the British Empire together should govern Shkodër. As a result, the French army moved from Korçë on June 15, 1920. After the French army left Korçë, the fate of the territory that it administered was decided by the Paris Peace Conference in 1919.|$|E
50|$|After Teddy holds {{a funeral}} for Frances, Bob confesses to having {{possibly}} killed her. But {{then it is}} revealed <b>that</b> <b>Frances</b> was 14 years old, unusually long for a guinea pig. Realizing <b>that</b> <b>Frances</b> might have died due to old age or exposure to the black and orange paint, Teddy finally lets everyone go home.|$|R
50|$|Once Marc Schreuder's link to {{the crime}} was discovered, it was alleged <b>that</b> <b>Frances</b> Schreuder {{manipulated}} her son through an unhealthy and abusive form of triangulation, using her son to target and murder her father. One of the wrinkles of the case was <b>that</b> <b>Frances</b> Schreuder's mother Berenice Schreuder continued to support her daughter throughout the case and bequeathed to Frances a share of her estate.|$|R
50|$|In 2012, Juan Alderete noted <b>that</b> <b>Frances</b> the Mute is {{the studio}} album {{he is most}} proud of.|$|R
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1850s it {{was clear}} <b>that</b> <b>France</b> was unable to match British {{building}} of steam warships, and to regain the strategic initiative a dramatic change was required. The result was the first ocean-going ironclad, , begun in 1857 and launched in 1859.|$|E
5|$|In 1690 Spanish authorities, {{concerned}} <b>that</b> <b>France</b> posed competitive threat, constructed several {{missions in}} East Texas. After Native American resistance, the Spanish missionaries returned to Mexico. When France began settling Louisiana, {{mostly in the}} southern part of the state, in 1716 Spanish authorities responded by founding a new series of missions in East Texas. Two years later, they created San Antonio as the first Spanish civilian settlement in the area.|$|E
5|$|Marine Le Pen has {{advocated}} <b>that</b> <b>France</b> {{should leave}} the euro (along with Spain, Greece and Portugal). She {{also wants to}} reintroduce customs borders and has campaigned against allowing dual citizenship. During both the 2010–2011 Ivorian crisis and the 2011 Libyan civil war, she opposed the French military involvements. She has recast the party's image towards Israel, after affirming Israel's right to secure itself from terrorism, and criticising the leadership of Iran.|$|E

5000|$|In 2009 {{executive}} producer Cameron Welsh revealed <b>that</b> <b>Frances</b> was back filming {{and she was}} [...] "very much part of plans going forward" [...] for the future. In 2010, she signed another six-month contract and appeared again from January 2011. Frances admitted she {{wanted to become a}} permanent cast member. On 14 April 2011, it was announced <b>that</b> <b>Frances</b> had finished filming her final scenes. A show spokesman said [...] "Morag is a much-loved Summer Bay character and we're sure we'll see her back." [...] Frances returned for another guest stint in early 2012. Frances reprised the role in late 2015 for a brief return in early 2016. In November 2016, a writer for TV Soap reported <b>that</b> <b>Frances</b> had reprised the role once more for a brief stint in 2017.|$|R

5|$|Mohamed Bacar {{managed to}} escape to Mayotte by {{speedboat}} and reports on March 26 confirmed his presence {{on the island and}} stated he had requested political asylum in France. The Associated Press reported from Paris <b>that</b> <b>France</b> was considering the request for political asylum but Comoran leaders demanded <b>that</b> <b>France</b> should return Bacar to the Comoros, and there have been anti-French protests calling for the same. France stated that it was treating the asylum request as quickly as possible, but, on March 27, Bacar was moved to the French island of Réunion, where he was charged and investigated for illegally entering French territory while carrying weapons, along with 23 of his followers. The case was rejected for procedural reasons, but Bacar and the 23 others remained in custody.|$|E
5|$|The Courbet-class {{ships were}} {{completed}} {{less than a}} year before the start of World War I and nothing is known of their activities during this time except <b>that</b> <b>France,</b> escorted by Jean Bart, carried the President of the French Republic, Raymond Poincaré, on a state visit to Saint Petersburg, Russia in July 1914. They were returning from Russia when World War I began, but made it to France without encountering German ships.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} rugby union {{teams of}} France and New Zealand (the All Blacks) {{have been playing}} each other for over a century; as of 19 October 2015, they have played 56 Test matches against each other. The first encounter, which was also France's first Test, took place in Paris in January 1906 and was won by New Zealand 388. It was not until 1954 <b>that</b> <b>France</b> secured their first win over New Zealand (30).|$|E

5000|$|Gay told a {{reporter}} from TVNZ that her character is good with [...] "any kind" [...] of business related matters {{but not with the}} social world. She added <b>that</b> <b>Frances</b> [...] "swings on a really big pendulum between someone who knows what's going on to someone who is so far behind the game that she's on another pitch." [...] She told a Yahoo!7 reporter <b>that</b> <b>Frances</b> is a [...] "wildly intelligent and high-powered business woman". She spent her life [...] "getting to the top of her game in a man's world, surrounded by men".|$|R

5|$|The {{projected}} {{attack on}} Aouzou never took place, as {{the dimensions of}} the victory obtained at Maaten made France fear that the attack on the Libyan base was only the first stage of a general offensive into Libya proper, a possibility <b>that</b> <b>France</b> was not willing to tolerate. As for Gaddafi, being subjected to internal and international pressures, he showed himself more conciliatory, which led to an OAU-brokered ceasefire on 11 September.|$|E
5|$|While in Egypt, Bonaparte stayed {{informed}} of European affairs. He learned <b>that</b> <b>France</b> {{had suffered a}} series of defeats in the War of the Second Coalition. On 24 August 1799, he {{took advantage of the}} temporary departure of British ships from French coastal ports and set sail for France, {{despite the fact that he}} had received no explicit orders from Paris. The army was left in the charge of Jean Baptiste Kléber.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the American Revolution, George Rogers Clark was sent from Virginia to enforce its claim to much of the land in the Great Lakes region. In July 1778, Clark and about 175men crossed the Ohio River and took control of Kaskaskia, Vincennes, and several other villages in British Indiana. The occupation was accomplished without firing a shot because Clark carried letters from the French ambassador stating <b>that</b> <b>France</b> supported the Americans. These letters made most of the French and Native American inhabitants of the area unwilling to support the British.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, the European Commission {{assessed}} <b>that</b> <b>France's</b> nuclear decommissioning liabilities {{were seriously}} underfunded, with only 23 billion euros of earmarked assets to cover 74.1 billion euros of expected decommissioning costs.|$|R

5|$|An {{agreement}} {{called the}} Matignon Accord followed on 6 November 1988 between the French and the Kanaks, {{which had the}} majority support of 80% of the French people. According to the Matignon Accord (or Matignon Agreement) a referendum on independence was proposed to be held by 1998. However, two of the Kanak leaders who had signed the agreement, Jean-Marie Tjibaou and Yeiwene Yeiwene, were assassinated on 4 May 1989 by a Kanak activist. The Kanak independence activists were unhappy with the situation as they felt <b>that</b> <b>France</b> would never allow them independence.|$|E
5|$|As {{time went}} on, Louis XVIII {{realised}} <b>that</b> <b>France</b> would never accept {{an attempt to}} return to the Ancien Régime. Accordingly, he created another policy in 1805 with a view toward reclaiming his throne: a declaration that was far more liberal than his former ones. It repudiated his Declaration of Verona, promised to abolish conscription, retain Napoleon I's administrative and judicial system, reduce taxes, eliminate political prisons, and guarantee amnesty to everyone who did not oppose a Bourbon Restoration. The opinions expressed in the declaration were largely those of the Count of Avaray, Louis's closest associate in exile.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{domestic}} opposition, internal demoralization, and international hostility, Gaddafi assumed a more conciliatory attitude following his defeat. On the other side, Habré also found himself vulnerable, as the French {{feared that the}} attack on Maatan as-Sarrah was only {{the first stage of}} a general offensive into Libya proper, a possibility <b>that</b> <b>France</b> was not disposed to tolerate. As a result, Mitterrand forced Habré to accept the mediation efforts of the Organization of African Unity's Zambian Chairman, Kenneth Kaunda, which resulted in a ceasefire on September 11.|$|E
2500|$|In February 1938 Pernot {{talked of}} the [...] "moral sickness" [...] of France {{in a speech}} in which he cited {{statistics}} <b>that</b> showed <b>that</b> <b>France's</b> population was falling behind Italy and Germany.|$|R

50|$|Frances {{worked at}} the Red Lodge Reformatory and lived with the owner, Mary Carpenter, from 1858 to 1859, but a {{turbulent}} {{relationship between the two}} meant <b>that</b> <b>Frances</b> left the school and moved out.|$|R
5|$|De Gaulle decided <b>that</b> <b>France,</b> though {{formally}} remaining a member, {{would no}} longer participate in the NATO military organization. This caused a rift between France and West Germany, which then started to emphasize standardization with American equipment, especially in armament, and to follow the new NATO policy to use multifuel diesel engines. German defence minister Franz Josef Strauss began to oppose the common tank project. In July 1963, the defence committee of the German Bundesrat decided to procure a purely national tank. In response, the same month the French government decided likewise.|$|E
5|$|For most of Scott's {{tenure as}} governor, {{tensions}} between the U.S. and Great Britain escalated. Sentiment {{in favor of a}} U.S. declaration of war against the British was particularly strong in Kentucky. Most Kentuckians resented the replacement of the Embargo Act of 1807 with the weaker Non-Intercourse Act of 1809 and Macon's Bill Number 2. Kentucky Senator Henry Clay became the acknowledged leader of the war hawks in Congress. During an address to the General Assembly on December 4, 1810, Scott expressed little hope of peacefully resolving U.S. grievances against Great Britain. He reminded the General Assembly, however, <b>that</b> <b>France</b> had also violated the United States' maritime rights and urged equal treatment of the two countries for their offenses.|$|E
5|$|In {{a memorable}} event, Metternich argued with Napoleon at Napoleon's 39th {{birthday}} celebrations in August 1808 over the increasingly obvious preparations for war on both sides. Soon after, Napoleon refused Metternich's {{attendance at the}} Congress of Erfurt; Metternich was later glad to hear from Talleyrand that Napoleon's attempts at the Congress to get Russia to invade Austria had proved unsuccessful. In late 1808 Metternich was recalled to Vienna for five weeks of meetings {{about the possibility of}} Austria invading France while Napoleon was on campaign in Spain. His memoranda reported <b>that</b> <b>France</b> was not united behind Napoleon, that Russia was unlikely to want to fight Austria, and <b>that</b> <b>France</b> had few reliable troops that could fight in central Europe. Back in Paris, Metternich was overtly apprehensive about his own safety. When Austria declared war on France, Metternich was indeed arrested in retaliation for the arrest of two French diplomats in Vienna, but the effects of this were minimal. He was allowed to leave France under escort for Austria in late May 1809. After Napoleon's capture of Vienna Metternich was conducted to the Austrian capital and exchange there for the French diplomats.|$|E
5000|$|The {{possible}} {{consequences of a}} [...] "No" [...] vote were highly debated in France before the referendum. Proponents of the Constitution, including Jacques Chirac, claimed <b>that</b> <b>France's</b> standing in Europe had been considerably weakened.|$|R

5000|$|Debi Enker {{writing for}} The Age said that Winners & Losers {{had a problem}} of being to broad with the narrative. But she felt that Gay [...] "notably" [...] often managed [...] "to transcend the limitations" [...] as the [...] "socially awkward Frances". The writer later said <b>that</b> <b>Frances</b> has a [...] "self-sabotaging lack of confidence" [...] and that Zach has [...] "the {{patience}} of a saint" [...] {{to put up with}} her [...] "frequent eruptions of nervy insecurity". Michael Idato from The Sydney Morning Herald said that four actresses had a [...] "palpable chemistry" [...] but Frances and Jenny were [...] "the most fully formed in the writing". He added <b>that</b> <b>Frances</b> is an [...] "over-thinker" [...] and [...] "bright". His colleague Frances Atkinson echoed his views writing that Gay and Bergland were given more opportunity to show off their acting skills. Idato has also branded Frances awkward and bright. He added <b>that</b> <b>Frances</b> being mistaken for a lesbian was one of the series premiere's [...] "sharper moments".|$|R
