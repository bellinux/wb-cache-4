40|$|International audienceObjective: was {{to apply}} a <b>tongue</b> <b>protector</b> with habit-modifying therapy through self-control, in the {{patients}} with burning mouth syndrome (BMS). Methods: A prospective, randomized study was made of 65 consecutive patients with BMS. Fifty subjects were randomized to two groups: group A (informed) and group B (informed {{and the application of}} a <b>tongue</b> <b>protector).</b> The symptoms were evaluated by VAS, while the psychological profile was assessed using the HAD, with application of the quality of life questionnaires SF- 36 and OHIP- 49. The duration of treatment was 8 weeks. Results: Fifty patients (46 females and 4 males) completed the study. The VAS scores in group B were 8. 2 at baseline and 4. 5 after two months. The respective scores in group A were 7. 1 and 5. 6 - {{the differences between the two}} groups being significant (p< 0. 001). In group B the OHIP- 49 yielded lower scores for most of the scales, with significant differences versus group A. In group B the SF 36 yielded significant differences versus group A in physical role, bodily pain, general health and emotional role. Conclusions: Parafunctional traumatism of the tongue should be taken into account in the pathogenesis of BMS with a view to exploring new therapeutic option...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Burning mouth {{syndrome}} (BMS) {{is characterized}} by burning of the oral mucosa {{in the absence of}} underlying dental or medical causes. The results of previous systematic reviews have generally been equivocal. However, findings for most interventions are based on searches of 5 - 10 years ago. This study therefore updates previous searches of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for pain as assessed by Visual Analogue Scales (VAS). Secondary outcomes included quality of life, mood, taste and salivary flow. Methods: A search of MEDLINE and Embase up to 2016. Results: 24 RCTs were identified. Meta-analyses were impossible because of wide variations in study method and quality. The commonest interventions were alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) (8 comparisons), capsaicin or an analogue (4 comparisons), clonazepam (3 comparisons) and psychotherapy (2 comparisons). ALA and capsaicin led to significantly greater improvements in VAS (4 studies each), as did clonazepam (all 3 studies), at up to two month follow-up. However, capsaicin led to prominent dyspepsia. Psychotherapy significantly improved outcomes in one study at two and 12 month follow-up. Catauma and tongue-protectors also showed promise (one study each). There {{were no significant differences in}} any of the secondary outcomes except in the one study of <b>tongue</b> <b>protectors.</b> Conclusions: At least in some studies and for some outcomes, ALA, clonazepam, capsaicin and psychotherapy may show modest benefit in the first two months. However, these conclusions are limited by generally short follow-up periods, high study variability and low participant numbers. Further RCTs with follow-up of at least 12 months are indicated...|$|R
