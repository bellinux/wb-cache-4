5|$|Benny Benke, {{writing for}} the Semarang-based daily Suara Merdeka, found that Bramantyo had used ? to portray {{tolerance}} in Indonesia without making the subject seem cliché; however, he considered some scenes, such as Hendra's conversion, overdone. Frans Sartono, reviewing for <b>the</b> <b>historically</b> Catholic daily Kompas, considered the film heavily didactic but ultimately interesting, because its social commentary was much needed, considering Indonesia's religious turmoil. He {{also noted that the}} characters were driven to their actions by worldly needs and not religion.|$|E

5|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>historically</b> {{contentious}} views within Jainism {{is in part}} {{attributed to}} Mahavira and his ascetic life where he never wore any clothes as a mark of disowning everything (interpreted {{as a consequence of}} the fifth vow of Aparigraha). The disputes triggered by this teaching of Mahavira are those related to gender and whether a female mendicant (sadhvi) can achieve spiritual liberation just like a male mendicant (sadhu) through Jain ascetic practices.|$|E

Their small size and gentle nature made them <b>the</b> <b>historically</b> preferred mount for children and women, but they were also used as working animals due to their abilities in the field. Today, they are used in endurance riding, as well as continuing their traditional work assisting humans with hunting wild game and herding cattle.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} was originally {{known as the}} McKernan Block, after John W. McKernan, the Princess’s owner and manager until 1919. The McKernans were a family of property developers in boomtown Strathcona; John’s father developed and ran <b>the</b> <b>historically</b> important Dominion Hotel, also on Whyte Avenue. For his part, J.W. McKernan is considered an important trailblazer in Edmonton entertainment. He opened two other south side theatres before the Princess, the South Side Gem and the South Side Bijou, both of which failed during the collapse of Strathcona's building boom in 1913.|$|E

Brøndby plays at Brøndby Stadion in the inner suburb of Brøndbyvester. BK Frem is based {{in the southern part of}} Copenhagen (Sydhavnen, Valby).

5|$|The poem is {{critical}} of the corruption Coleridge sees within his own government, but it still displays his loyalty and devotion to England. The poem operates in a circular pattern with its beginning and ending at the Stowey dell. By introducing <b>the</b> <b>historically</b> real possibility of an invasion of England, the narrator announces his determination to protect his family and the dell, along with his fellow Britons. Throughout the poem, {{there is also an}} emphasis on the simple life and the narrator desires to return to his previous idyllic lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|The {{sorority}} {{was founded}} on January 15, 1908, at <b>the</b> <b>historically</b> black Howard University in Washington, D.C., {{by a group of}} sixteen students led by Ethel Hedgeman Lyle.

Alpha Kappa Alpha was incorporated on January 29, 1913.|$|E

5|$|In the Western world, biographers {{began writing}} about Lenin {{soon after his}} death; some – like Christopher Hill – were {{sympathetic}} to him, and others – like Richard Pipes and Robert Gellately – expressly hostile. Some later biographers, such as Read and Lars Lih, sought to avoid making either hostile or positive comments about him, thereby evading politicised stereotypes. Among sympathisers, he was portrayed as having made a genuine adjustment of Marxist theory that enabled it to suit Russia's particular socio-economic conditions. The Soviet view characterised {{him as a man}} who recognised <b>the</b> <b>historically</b> inevitable and accordingly helped to make the inevitable happen. Conversely, the majority of Western historians have perceived him as a person who manipulated events in order to attain and then retain political power, moreover considering his ideas as attempts to ideologically justify his pragmatic policies. More recently, revisionists in both Russia and the West have highlighted the impact that pre-existing ideas and popular pressures exerted on Lenin and his policies.|$|E
5|$|Nevado del Ruiz has {{undergone}} three distinct eruptive periods, the first beginning 1.8million years ago. During the present period (beginning 11,000years ago), it has erupted at least twelve times, producing ashfalls, pyroclastic flows, and lahars. <b>The</b> <b>historically</b> recorded eruptions have primarily involved a central vent eruption (in the caldera) {{followed by an}} explosive eruption, then the formation of lahars. Ruiz's earliest identified Holocene eruption was in about 6660BC, and further eruptions occurred around 1245, 850, 200BC and in about 350, 675, in 1350, 1541 (perhaps), 1570, 1595, 1623, 1805, 1826, 1828 (perhaps), 1829, 1831, 1833 (perhaps), 1845, 1916, December 1984 through March 1985, 1987 through July 1991, and possibly in April 1994. Many of these eruptions involved a central vent eruption, a flank vent eruption, and a phreatic (steam) explosion. Ruiz is the second-most active volcano in Colombia after Galeras.|$|E

He began his university studies at Amherst College, but when traditions preventing Jews from joining clubs or fraternities drastically curtailed his social life, he transferred to Harvard University after the first year.

5|$|The Sumerian King List (SKL) records a dynasty of six kings from Mari enjoying hegemony {{between the}} dynasty of Adab and the dynasty of Kish. The {{names of the}} Mariote kings were damaged on the early copies of the list, and those kings were {{correlated}} with historical kings {{that belonged to the}} second city. However, an undamaged copy of the list that date to the old Babylonian period was discovered in Shubat-Enlil, and the names bears no resemblance to any of <b>the</b> <b>historically</b> attested monarchs of the second city, indicating that the compilers of the list had an older and probably a legendary dynasty in mind, that predate the second city.|$|E
5|$|The {{borders of}} the Empire evolved {{significantly}} over its existence, as it went through several cycles of decline and recovery. During the reign of Justinian I (r. 527–565), the Empire reached its greatest extent after reconquering much of <b>the</b> <b>historically</b> Roman western Mediterranean coast, including North Africa, Italy, and Rome itself, which it held for two more centuries. During the reign of Maurice (r. 582–602), the Empire's eastern frontier was expanded and the north stabilised. However, his assassination caused the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628, which exhausted the Empire's resources and contributed to major territorial losses during the Early Muslim conquests of the seventh century. In a matter of years the Empire lost its richest provinces, Egypt and Syria, to the Arabs.|$|E

At a distance of 80km from Varanasi, Ghazipur is famous {{not only for its}} Ghats on the Ganges but also for the tomb of Lord Cornwallis, the 18th-century Governor of East India Company ruled Bengal Presidency.
