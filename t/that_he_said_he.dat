He said Laura had been trying to take the rifle away from her son when it was fired.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 45 {{per cent}} of {{institutional}} investors thought that better oversight by the SEC {{could have prevented}} the Madoff fraud. Harry Markopolos complained to the SEC's Boston office in 2000, telling the SEC staff they should investigate Madoff because {{it was impossible to}} legally make the profits Madoff claimed using the investment strategies <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> used.|$|E

He complained that he had been forced into hiding because of harassment from the secret police, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> and his family were being followed, that his staff were being harassed, and that the SBU were spreading a rumor that he was wanted on a murder charge.|$|E

25|$|Experts at the Johns Hopkins Center for Civilian Biodefense Strategies (CCBS) {{concluded}} {{that one of}} the nineteen 9/11 hijackers, Ahmed al-Haznawi, had likely been exposed to anthrax. al-Haznawi and another man arrived in the emergency room of a Fort Lauderdale, Florida, hospital presenting an ugly, dark lesion on his leg <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> developed after bumping into a suitcase two months earlier. Christos Tsonas thought the injury was curious, cleaned it and prescribed an antibiotic. After September 11, federal investigators found the medicine prescribed by Tsonas among the possessions of al-Haznawi.|$|E
25|$|A {{currently}} familiar depiction {{is that on}} the Shroud of Turin, whose records go back to 1353. Controversy {{surrounds the}} shroud and its exact origin remains subject to debate. The Shroud of Turin is respected by Christians of several traditions, including Baptists, Catholics, Lutherans, Methodists, Orthodox, Pentecostals, and Presbyterians. It {{is one of the}} Catholic devotions approved by the Holy See, that to the Holy Face of Jesus, now uses the image of the face on the shroud as it appeared in the negative of the photograph taken by amateur photographer Secondo Pia in 1898. The image cannot be clearly seen on the shroud itself with the naked eye, and it surprised Pia to the extent <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> almost dropped and broke the photographic plate when he first saw the developed negative image on it in the evening of 28 May 1898.|$|E
25|$|There {{was now a}} tumult arisen at Alexandria, {{between the}} Jewish {{inhabitants}} and the Greeks; and three ambassadors were chosen out of each party that were at variance, who came to Gaius. Now one of these ambassadors from the people of Alexandria was Apion, (29) who uttered many blasphemies against the Jews; and, among other things <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>he</b> charged them with neglecting the honors that belonged to Caesar; for that while all who were subject to the Roman empire built altars and temples to Gaius, and in other regards universally received him as they received the gods, these Jews alone thought it a dishonorable thing for them to erect statues in honor of him, {{as well as to}} swear by his name. Many of these severe things were said by Apion, by which he hoped to provoke Gaius to anger at the Jews, as he was likely to be. But Philo, the principal of the Jewish embassage, a man eminent on all accounts, brother to Alexander the Alabarch, (30) and one not unskillful in philosophy, was ready to betake himself to make his defense against those accusations; but Gaius prohibited him, and bid him begone; he was also in such a rage, that it openly appeared he was about to do them some very great mischief. So Philo being thus affronted, went out, and said to those Jews who were about him, that they should be of good courage, since Gaius's words indeed showed anger at them, but in reality had already set God against himself.|$|E

500|$|Despite his {{successful}} media career, Icke wrote that 1989 {{was a time}} of considerable personal despair, and it was during this period <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> began to feel a presence around him. He often describes how he felt it while alone in a hotel room in March 1990, and finally asked: [...] "If there is anybody here, will you please contact me because you are driving me up the wall!" [...] Days later, in a newsagent's in Ryde, he felt a force pull his feet to the ground, he wrote, and heard a voice guide him toward some books. One of them was Mind to Mind (1989) by Betty Shine, a psychic healer in Brighton. He read the book, then wrote to her requesting a consultation about his arthritis.|$|E
500|$|In May 1974, the Church {{asked the}} Navy Department to supply {{seventeen}} medals {{that he was}} said to have been awarded, including the Purple Heart and Navy Commendation Medal, many of them with bronze service stars denoting participation in military campaigns or multiple bestowals of the same award. The Navy sent only four medals, noting, [...] "The records in this Bureau fail to establish Mr. Hubbard's entitlement to the other medals and awards listed in your response." [...] Hubbard responded by circulating to Scientologists a photograph of 21 medals and palms <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> had been awarded and explained that he had actually won 28, but that the missing seven had been awarded to him in secret because the naval high command was embarrassed that he had sunk two Japanese submarines in the United States' [...] "back yard". A 1994 biography published by the Church of Scientology states that he was awarded 29 medals and awards.|$|E
500|$|The work at Siding Spring was rewarding, but {{it could}} also be dangerous. During construction, Gascoigne {{constantly}} warned colleagues to take care on the elevated catwalks around the telescope. However, Gascoigne himself was almost killed when, while working one night around the telescope structure, he fell seven metres {{to the floor of the}} observatory, narrowly missing [...] "a massive steel structure with long protruding bolts". He survived, and was the first to take a photograph using the telescope, on 26 or 27 April 1974. Gascoigne was so pleased with the quality of the optics <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> wanted a number describing the hyperboloid shape of the mirror (1.1717) engraved on his headstone. The site quickly became one of the world's most important astronomical observatories and was for many years home to world-leading astrophotographer David Malin. The successes of the AAT have been documented in annual reports by its Board, while a 2008 analysis of the relative impacts of astronomical observing facilities placed the AAT in the top three, coming after only the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the W. M. Keck Observatory (both telescopes built more than two decades later). For Gascoigne, it was [...] "a wonderful thing to be associated with – the high point in my life." ...|$|E

2500|$|A Midrash {{compared}} Noah to Moses {{and found}} Moses superior.

2500|$|Ironside {{himself was}} sent to France in May 1940 to liaise with the BEF and the French {{in an attempt to}} halt the German advance. He was not well-qualified for this task, having a deep dislike and {{distrust}} for the French, whom he considered [...] "absolutely unscrupulous in everything". At a conference in Lens he clashed with the French Generals Billotte and Blanchard, whom he considered defeatists. He wrote: [...] "I lost my temper and shook Billotte by the button of his tunic. The man is completely defeated." [...] Although Billotte was supposed to be co-ordinating the British, French and Belgian armies' operations in Belgium, Ironside took over the job himself, ordering Gort and Blanchard to launch a counter-attack against the Germans at Arras. This attack achieved some local success, but the German onslaught proved unstoppable. The French Commander-in-Chief, General Weygand, so resented Ironside's actions <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> would [...] "like to box Ironside's ears."
