50|$|<b>Tantalum</b> <b>boride</b> films can be {{deposited}} from a {{gas mixture}} of TaCl5-BCl3-H2-Ar in the temperature range 540-800 °C. TaB2 (single-phase) is deposited at a source gas flow ratio (BCl3/TaCl5) of {{six and a}} temperature above 600 °C. TaB (single-phase) is deposited at BCl3/TaCl5 = 2-4 and T = 600-700 °C.|$|E
40|$|A {{precursor}} of a ceramic adhesive {{suitable for use}} in a vacuum, thermal, and microgravity environment. The {{precursor of}} the ceramic adhesive includes a silicon-based, preceramic polymer and at least one ceramic powder selected from the group consisting of aluminum oxide, aluminum nitride, boron carbide, boron oxide, boron nitride, hafnium boride, hafnium carbide, hafnium oxide, lithium aluminate, molybdenum silicide, niobium carbide, niobium nitride, silicon boride, silicon carbide, silicon oxide, silicon nitride, tin oxide, <b>tantalum</b> <b>boride,</b> tantalum carbide, tantalum oxide, tantalum nitride, titanium boride, titanium carbide, titanium oxide, titanium nitride, yttrium oxide, zirconium boride, zirconium carbide, zirconium oxide, and zirconium silicate. Methods of forming the ceramic adhesive and of repairing a substrate in a vacuum and microgravity environment are also disclosed, as is a substrate repaired with the ceramic adhesive...|$|E
