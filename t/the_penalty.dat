5|$|A {{technical}} foul {{requires that the}} defenceman who fouled a player on the opposing team be placed in <b>the</b> <b>penalty</b> box for 30 seconds. As with a personal foul, until <b>the</b> <b>penalty</b> time expires, no replacement for the player is allowed and the team must play one man short. The player (or a replacement) is allowed to reenter the game once the time in <b>the</b> <b>penalty</b> box is over and the team is thus once again at full strength.|$|E
5|$|Two laps {{from the}} finish of the 1998 British Grand Prix, Schumacher {{was leading the}} race when he was issued a stop-and-go penalty for {{overtaking}} a lapped car (Alexander Wurz) during the early moments of a Safety Car period. This penalty involves going into the pit lane and stopping for 10 seconds, and the rules state that a driver must serve his penalty within three laps of <b>the</b> <b>penalty</b> being issued. On the third lap after receiving <b>the</b> <b>penalty,</b> Schumacher turned into the pit lane to serve his penalty, but as {{this was the last}} lap of the race, and as Ferrari's pit box was located after the start/finish line, Schumacher technically finished the race before serving <b>the</b> <b>penalty.</b> The stewards initially resolved that problem by adding 10 seconds to Schumacher's race time, then later rescinded <b>the</b> <b>penalty</b> completely due to the irregularities in how <b>the</b> <b>penalty</b> had been issued.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> death <b>penalty</b> {{has been}} an issue of debate for decades and it is of great {{relevance}} at present. Different reasons have emerged that make recourse to <b>the</b> death <b>penalty</b> appear necessary, such as, that {{it serves as a}} deterrent, it meets the need for retribution and that public opinion demands its imposition. Conversely, more convincing arguments have been raised for its abolition, amongst which is the argument that it is a violation of human rights. Africa is seen as one of <b>the</b> “death <b>penalty</b> regions” in <b>the</b> world, as most African states still retain <b>the</b> death <b>penalty</b> despite <b>the</b> growing international human rights standards and trends towards its abolition. Further, the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights makes no mention of <b>the</b> death <b>penalty.</b> <b>The</b> death <b>penalty</b> in Africa is therefore an issue that one has to be particularly concerned about. During the 36 th Ordinary Session (2004) of the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights, for the first time, <b>the</b> death <b>penalty</b> was one of the issues discussed by the Commission. Commissioner Chirwa initiated debate about the abolition of <b>the</b> death <b>penalty</b> in Africa, urging the Commission to take a clear position on the subject. In view of this and the international human rights developments and trends on <b>the</b> death <b>penalty,</b> discourses on <b>the</b> abolition of <b>the</b> death <b>penalty</b> in Africa are much needed. Accordingly, this study examines <b>the</b> death <b>penalty</b> in Africa from a human rights perspective. It seeks to determine why African states retain <b>the</b> death <b>penalty,</b> <b>the</b> ways in which the current operation of <b>the</b> death <b>penalty</b> in African states conflicts with human rights, what causes obstructions to its abolition in Africa, and whether it is appropriate for African states to join the international trend for the abolition of <b>the</b> death <b>penalty.</b> <b>The</b> current status and operation of <b>the</b> death <b>penalty</b> in Africa is first examined. The historical background to <b>the</b> death <b>penalty</b> in Africa from a traditional and western perspective is also discussed. Subsequently, the main arguments advanced by Africans (including African leaders, writers, priests and government officials) for the retention of <b>the</b> death <b>penalty</b> in Africa are evaluated. The study goes further to examine <b>the</b> death <b>penalty</b> in African states {{in the light of the}} right to life, the prohibition of cruel inhuman and degrading treatment and fair trial rights at both the international and national levels. After examining <b>the</b> death <b>penalty</b> in African states, the study arrives at the conclusion that it is appropriate for African states to join the international trend for the abolition of <b>the</b> death <b>penalty,</b> considering that <b>the</b> death <b>penalty</b> in Africa conflicts with human rights, the justifications for its retention are fundamentally flawed, and that alternatives to <b>the</b> death <b>penalty</b> in Africa exist. A number of recommendations are then made, which are geared towards the abolition of <b>the</b> death <b>penalty</b> in Africa. Thesis (LLD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2006.
