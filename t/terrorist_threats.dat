5|$|Carney was {{appointed}} U.S. Ambassador to Sudan on 27 June 1995 {{during a period}} of turmoil in U.S.-Sudan relations. Osama bin Laden had fled Saudi Arabia for the safe confines of Khartoum a few years earlier, and Sudan's alleged harboring and abetting of Muslim extremists on its soil was attracting attention of counterterrorism experts in the United States and abroad. Carney's tenure as ambassador followed a tumultuous period during which his predecessor, Donald K. Petterson, had been forced to draw down embassy staff by half and send their families back to America when <b>terrorist</b> <b>threats</b> were made against U.S. diplomats stationed in Khartoum.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{the hotel}} {{fell into a}} {{turbulent}} period. <b>Terrorist</b> <b>threats</b> from the Irish Republican Army became the chief concern, and bomb scares were not uncommon. The oil crisis in the early 1970s directly affected business and prompted the Bracewell-Smith family to sell their stake to Trafalgar House on 5 April 1976 for £2.75m. At {{the time of the}} sale, the hotel's occupancy rate was just 45 percent; the Ritz Grill Room had been closed and it had lost quite a bit of money in recent times. In 1984, the Ritz brought back its weekly Sunday tea dances which were popular during the 1920s and 1930s. Because of demand, the hotel considered restricting afternoon tea at the Ritz to hotel guests only, as those staying at the Ritz were often unable to get a table. Many Londoners who would have been barred by this restriction voiced disapproval and the Ritz compromised by requiring reservations for afternoon tea at the hotel. Proper attire for tea is a must; the Ritz once refused to admit Mick Jagger for tea because he was not wearing a jacket and tie.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the ship date back to 4 March 2005, in a {{proposal}} drafted by then-Minister of Justice and Ecclesiastical Affairs (which is now a nonexistent entity), Björn Bjarnason, regarding {{the purchase of a}} new vessel, in order to replace the aging ICGV Óðinn, and aircraft for the Icelandic Coast Guard. The Althing decided that this was an exigent matter, and so a high priority was placed upon the proposal. A needs analysis pertaining to the acquisition of a multi-purpose vessel and aircraft for the ICG was initiated on 31 September 2005. The main demands were that the vessel should be designed for rescue work and patrolling, pollution prevention, fuelling search and rescue helicopters in flight, and meeting civil defence requirements anywhere around the country. In addition, it was to be equipped for response to, and prevention of, <b>terrorist</b> <b>threats</b> and be suitable for operations involving the police or customs authorities, and for all types of rescue and salvage work. The bollard pull of the vessel was to take account of the greatly increased volume of passenger and cargo shipping in Iceland’s economic zone and coastal waters.|$|E
40|$|This article {{hypothesized}} that the possibility to construct intellectual meaning {{of a terrorist attack}} (i. e., whether participants can cognitively understand why the perpetrators did their crime) reduces the negative psychological consequences typically associated with increased <b>terrorist</b> <b>threat.</b> Concretely, the authors investigated the effect of intellectual meaning (induced by providing additional information about potential economic, cultural, and historical reasons for the terrorist attack) on perceived <b>terrorist</b> <b>threat</b> and associated emotional well-being. Study 1 revealed that pictures of terrorist attacks elicited less experienced <b>terrorist</b> <b>threat</b> when they were presented with background information about the terrorists' motives (meaning provided) rather than without additional background information (no meaning provided). Study 2 replicated this effect with a different manipulation of <b>terrorist</b> <b>threat</b> (i. e., newspaper article) and clarified the underlying psychological process: Participants in the high terror salience condition with meaning provided experienced less <b>terrorist</b> <b>threat</b> and thus more emotional well-being in the face of crisis than participants in the high terror salience condition without meaning provided. Theoretical and practical implications in the context of psychological health and mass media effects are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Traditionally, {{research}} has shown that subtle and blatant prejudices are important predictors of out-group discrimination and support for anti-immigration policies. The present paper shows that, when controlling for these types of prejudices and for political conservatism, <b>terrorist</b> <b>threat</b> and perceived Islamic support for terrorism are related to such negative out-group treatment as well. We conducted survey-interviews with a random selection of a representative sample of 775 women and 634 men (age range 16 - 91 years) from 9 different European countries. Across this sample, we first demonstrate that <b>terrorist</b> <b>threat</b> and perceived support for terrorism by Muslims directly and uniquely can predict more personal discrimination of Muslims, higher approval of institutional discrimination against Muslims, and higher endorsement of strict anti-immigration policies. In addition, we show the indirect effects of <b>terrorist</b> <b>threat</b> and perceived support for terrorism by Muslims because they predict traditional determinants of negative out-group treatment (i. e., both subtle and blatant prejudices). Results are discussed in terms of the unique role of <b>terrorist</b> <b>threat</b> and perceived Islamic support for terrorism in relation to traditional prejudices, as determinants of negative out-group treatment...|$|R

25|$|On November 28, 2001, Petrelis and Pasquarelli {{appeared}} before the San Francisco County Superior Court for a hearing on civil harassment suits by two public health officials, and five San Francisco Chronicle editors and reporters who claimed they received threatening phone calls. In the courthouse hallway after the hearing, San Francisco Police Department officers arrested Petrelis and Pasquarelli. The activists were charged with criminal conspiracy, stalking, and making <b>terrorist</b> <b>threats</b> against newspaper reporters and public health officials. Petrelis' bail was set at $500,000; Pasquarelli's bail was set at $600,000. On November 30, 2001, a judge refused the arrestees' request for {{a reduction in the}} unusually high bail. Mark Vermeulen, the attorney representing Petrelis and Pasquarelli, said the activists were abiding by the restraining orders, the matter was being handled by the civil courts, {{and that there was no}} need for criminal prosecution. The twenty-seven counts of criminal conspiracy, stalking, and making <b>terrorist</b> <b>threats</b> carried a possible penalty of up to seventy-eight years in prison.|$|E

40|$|Research on {{evaluations}} of leaders has frequently found that female leaders receive lower ratings {{in times of}} national security crisis. However, less is known about countervailing factors. We contend that partisanship and leadership experience in relevant domains are two factors that can counteract {{the negative effects of}} <b>terrorist</b> <b>threat</b> on {{evaluations of}} female political leaders. To test this expectation, we implemented a national study in 2012 containing <b>terrorist</b> <b>threat</b> and non-threat conditions, and then asked participants to evaluate political leaders. The results show that Republican leaders, including women, are unaffected by terrorist threat; in contrast, Democratic leaders are punished during times of <b>terrorist</b> <b>threat,</b> but this negative effect is smaller for then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton compared to Nancy Pelosi, who lacks similar experience. In short, Republican partisanship is a strong countervailing factor, while leadership experience in national security more modestly countervails...|$|R
