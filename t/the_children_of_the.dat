5|$|The {{spread of}} disease was {{significantly}} more rampant {{in areas of}} poverty. Epidemics ravaged cities, particularly children. Plagues were easily spread by lice, unsanitary drinking water, armies, or by poor sanitation. Children were hit the hardest because many diseases, such as typhus and syphilis, target the immune system, leaving young children without a fighting chance. Children in city dwellings were more affected by the spread of disease than <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wealthy.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the story, Osiris rules Egypt, having {{inherited}} the kingship from his ancestors in a lineage stretching back to the creator of the world, Ra or Atum. His queen is Isis, who, along with Osiris and his murderer Set, is one of <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earth god Geb and the sky goddess Nut. Little information about the reign of Osiris appears in Egyptian sources; the focus is on his death and the events that follow. Osiris is connected with life-giving power, righteous kingship, and the rule of maat, the ideal natural order whose maintenance was a fundamental goal in ancient Egyptian culture. Set is closely associated with violence and chaos. Therefore, the slaying of Osiris symbolizes the struggle between order and disorder, and the disruption of life by death.|$|E

Bran decides to observe a vision without the Three-Eyed Raven. He witnesses a massive army of wights led by the Night King, who touches him whilst in the vision. Bran awakens to find a mark where he was touched, and the Three-Eyed Raven warns that he must leave, as the Night King is now able to find them.|$|E

Landownership by people of all castes is recorded in inscriptions Intercaste marriages in the higher castes were only between highly placed Kshatriya girls and Brahmin boys, but was relatively frequent among other castes.

5|$|During World War I, the interwar {{years and}} World War II, {{widespread}} poverty in Malta prevented <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower classes from pursuing basic education {{in favor of}} staying home to assist parents with agricultural work and other income earning activities. To counteract this phenomenon, education was declared compulsory in 1946. In 1964, Malta became an independent nation, and in 1988 a new Education Act was passed, lowering the compulsory education age to five years, decentralising educational decision making and establishing a right for any person {{to apply for a}} licence to open a school. The Faculty of Arts, Sciences and Theology at the University of Malta was also reinstated.|$|E

On the pace laps, Johnson, after changing his engine, and teammate Earnhardt, who had to move to a back-up car, had to fall behind all the other drivers in the event after doing major changes during practice. At the start, Newman was the leader going through the first corner, but on the same lap Menard, with pushing assistance from Martin, passed him. On the second lap, the first caution was given because Newman spun sideways in the second turn but avoided impacting the wall. During the caution, he drove to pit road for a pit stop.|$|E
5|$|If all edge weights of an {{undirected graph}} are positive, then the minimax {{distances}} between pairs of points (the maximum edge weights of minimax paths) form an ultrametric; conversely every finite ultrametric space comes from minimax distances in this way. A data structure constructed from the {{minimum spanning tree}} allows the minimax distance between any pair of vertices to be queried in constant time per query, using lowest common ancestor queries in a Cartesian tree. The root of the Cartesian tree represents the heaviest minimum spanning tree edge, and <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> root are Cartesian trees recursively constructed from the subtrees of the minimum spanning tree formed by removing the heaviest edge. The leaves of the Cartesian tree represent the vertices of the input graph, and the minimax distance between two vertices equals {{the weight of the}} Cartesian tree node that is their lowest common ancestor. Once the minimum spanning tree edges have been sorted, this Cartesian tree can be constructed in linear time.|$|E

5|$|In one draft, Picard kills Data {{early in}} the film, and the android is later resurrected to help the Captain in the finale. The first two drafts {{featured}} the Romulans as the protagonists, since they had never prominently appeared in a Star Trek film. The second draft was seen by Jonathan Dolgen at the studio; Dolgen was not pleased and Patrick Stewart {{thought that it would}} have been only suitable for a television episode. In the third draft, the Son'a were introduced as <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ba'ku and the alien race that wanted to plunder the planet. That version also included the crew sub-plots, such as the Troi-Riker romance and the regeneration of La Forge's eyes. Stewart, who was concerned that the film was a step back in scope from First Contact, was consulted on the treatments.|$|E
5|$|Later King Shantanu, {{captivated by}} her {{fragrance}} and beauty, {{fell in love}} with Satyavati. She married Shantanu on condition that their children inherit the throne, denying the birthright of Shantanu's eldest son (and crown prince) Bhishma. Satyavati bore Shantanu two children, Chitrangada and Vichitravirya. After Shantanu's death, she and her prince sons with the help of Bhishma ruled the kingdom. Although both her sons died childless, she arranged for her first son, Vyasa, to father <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two widows of Vichitravirya through niyoga. The children, (Dhritarashtra and Pandu) became the fathers of the Kauravas and Pandavas respectively. After Pandu's death, Satyavati went to the forest for penance and breathed her last before witnessing the Kurukshetra War.|$|E
5|$|Louis Octave Uzanne {{was born}} on 14 September 1851 in Auxerre, to a bourgeois family {{originating}} from Savoy. His parents were Charles-Auguste Omer Uzanne, a merchant, and Elisabeth Laurence Octavie; his elder brother Joseph, had been born the previous year. His classical studies began in his home town; he moved to Paris after his father's death to study at the Collège Rollin in Paris—a residential school for <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French upper-class. In Paris he {{became interested in the}} evolution and history of manuscripts and books. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871 he was attached to a school at Richmond in England. Continuing with law studies, he abandoned this line of work when he came into an inheritance in 1872, allowing him to pursue his literary interests.|$|E

When Sharif Hussein's son, Faisal, visited Syria in early 1916, he lodged in the al-Bakris' summer house in Qaboun, outside of Damascus. Prior to this, Nasib and his brothers Fawzi and Sami had joined the budding al-Fatat movement, an underground society advocating Arab independence from the Ottomans. Nasib had become the movement's secretary.|$|E
5|$|Of the {{generation}} of painters that followed Raeburn, David Watson (1767–1837) trained with Reynolds in London before returning home {{to become the first}} president of the Scottish Academy in 1826. The influence of both Reynolds and Raeburn can be seen in his work, including A Girl Drawing (1813) and the large group portrait <b>The</b> <b>Children</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earl of Elgin with their Nurse (c. 1805). He was followed as president of the academy by his nephew John Watson Gordon (1788–1864), who also studied with Raeburn. He painted portraits of leading cultural figures James Hogg and Lady Nairne as part of a series of portraits commissioned by William Blackwood. From the 1840s his work began to be influenced by early photography, with cool light and muted colours, {{as can be seen in}} his full-length portrait of Principal Lee (1847).|$|E
5|$|Only <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> king {{could be}} born inside the Inner Court. Every {{detail of the}} birth of the royal child was recorded, {{including}} the time of birth, which was to be used later by court astrologers to cast his or her horoscope. Ceremonies concerning the birth and the rites of passage of the child was performed within the walls of the Inner Court. The birth of a royal child was first announced by a succession of women who proclaimed the news along the Inner Court's streets. There were two waiting orchestras, one on the inside made of women and one on the outside of men, who would then carry out the official proclamation with conch shell fanfares. If the child was a prince the Gong of Victory was to be struck three times. The children would live with their respective mothers and be educated in special schools within the court.|$|E
